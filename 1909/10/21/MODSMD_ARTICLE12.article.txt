The evii of overconiidence in regard
to the result of the intercollegiate
rugby game is once again infesting
the student body. This feeling always
finds clear expression in small at
tendance at :he daily football prac
tices. Why overconiidence as to a
varsity victory over the Blue and
Gold ever exist.-: is an unexplainable
mystery, tor when Stanford does win,
it is only after a battle for their very
lives against foes who ate fighting
just as desperately as the>. Califor
nia has yet to allow Stanford an easy
triumph in any branch of intercol
legiate sport, and especially is this
true in rugby.
During the early part of the season
ot 190S the same overconiidence per
vaded the undergraduates. Although
the Cardinal won and by a good score,
the victory far from justified the su
perfluous assurance of the student
body, for until five minutes before
the end of the game, the result was
in utter doubt. Similarly, one week
ago to-day the average student was
not predicting a freshman victory, but 1
was placing Hie score at anything !
from twenty points tip. Yet thV< 191:3
fifteen barely succeeded in winning
by a single try. i
precisely three weeks remain before :
the n val varsities face each other on
Stanfora Field. It. is the duty of
every Stum <>i'd man to be a regular
attendant at the intervening prac
tices, to root for the team with ail the ;
spirit there is in him, and to effectually ,
subdue the prevalent feeling of over
coniidence, none of which is justified :
in the least degree. No matter how '
experienced our team, no matter how :
heavy our forwards or how fast our |
backs, the Blue and Gold will never ;
be vanquished with tlie Cardinal sup
porters in a state of listless satislitc
tion.
