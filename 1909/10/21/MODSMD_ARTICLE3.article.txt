# Bishop Spaulding Speaks on Socialism.
## 
### 
"Marxian Socialism and Christian
ity" was the topic of an interesting
and instructive lecture delivered last
night by Right Reverend E. P. Spauld
ing before a gathering of Socialists
and persons interested in that sub
ject.
The bishop explained at length the
anti-christian character of tlie clas
sics of socialism and then proceeded
to trace the means by which these two
apparently opposite ideas could be
brough together to obtain the same
end.
An informal discussion was held at
the end of the lecture,, after which a
vote of thanks was offered by Dr. Jor
dan. Later in the evening an informal
reception was held at the residence
of Dr. Jordan.
