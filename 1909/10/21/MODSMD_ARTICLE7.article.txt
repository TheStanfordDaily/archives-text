# VARSITY GOES SOUTH
## HOLMAN UNABLE TO ACCOMPANY TEAM TO LOS ANGELES. With This Exception Cardinal Will Be Unusually Strong in Game with Castaways. 
### 
An eleventh-hour change in the line
up of the varsity fifteen was an
nounced just before the team left for
Los Angeles this afternoon. J. R.
Holnian, the clever wing, was un
able to make the trip because of the
pressure of college work, and conse
quently Kern will take his place in
the three-quarter line. T. Sanborn
accompanied the fifteen as substitute
wing.
With the exception of Holman the
Varsity will present its full strength
when it faces ihe Castaways i:i the
south on Saturday. The game is sched
uled to take place on Occidental Field
and to commence at 3 o'clock. Coach
Noble, of the Los Angeles High School,
will officiate as referee.
The Castaways team will he com
posed of practically the same players
as were in its line-up when the 10
to 10 tie game with the California
Varsity was contested. The only Stan
ford man at present a member of the
Castaways is L. M. Edwards, '07.
The scoring ability of the Cardinal
should be marked in Saturday's game.
With Reed at half and Captain Mit
chell and his brother Standish at the
five-eighth positions, many more pas
sing rushes should be started than
has been the case in other prelimi
nary games. The Cardinal backfield,
which has been subject to continual
variation throughout the season, has
at last become apparently permanent
and should prove a wonderful scoring
machine henceforth.
The Stanford squad will leave Los
Angeles Saturday, reaching Palo Alto
at 10:55 Sunday morning.
