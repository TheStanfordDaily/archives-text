# BARGE SINKS IN RACE
## HEAVY SEAS SWAMP STANFORD BOAT AT PORTOLA. Crew Rescued by Launch But Barge Is Docked with Difficulty. Alameda Wins Regatta. 
### 
The barge of the Stanford four found
ered after covering a little more than
half of the distance in the race with
the Dophins, the crew of tlie Alameda
Boat Club, and the crew of the South
Side Boat Club last Saturday after
noon 011 San Francisco Bay. The
men, forced to take to the water by
the sinking of their boat were quickly
rescued by a launch, but it. took nearly
two hours' work to get tne barge
back to a place where it could be
docked. The combination of a stiff
off-shore wind and long outriggers
that scooped the water into the boat
was responsible for the mishap to thn
Stanford boat.
From the moment the boat was put
in the water it was evident that a
great deal of water would be shipped
though the men hoped to got
over the course without sinking. The
superiority cf the especially Diiilt salt
water racing barges was clearly de
monstrated in the rough water on
China Basin last Saturday.
Stanford was a popular favorite with
the spectators from the start. The
form of the Four was apparent as the
men rowed around the starting place
to set warmed up, previous to the
start of the race of the flay. The
crews of the other clubs are self
coached and the work that ex-coach
Dan Murphy put on the men last
year to prepare them for the Varsity
and Freshman rowing contests with
the University of California was quite
apparent.
The Stanford crew was not prepared
for the starting signal and in conse
quence the other crews obtained a
good lead at the start, which was,
however, almost overcome when the
half way post was turned. But on
the return the water shipped as the
wave crests were scooped in by the
metal outriggers deluged the barge
and gradually lessened the headway
until Coxswain Guerena bade the men
ease off as be realized the problem had
become one of keeping the barge
afloat.
After a portion of the return was
completed the boat sank completely.
A launch lay-to to assist the crew,
but the tow rope became twistefl
around her propeller and in the mean
time (lie barge floated away and tin
crew were forced to swim after it to
keep it from being smashed against
a wharf. After an hour and a hal"
of work the men succeeded in docking
their boat.
The members of the Stanford Four
are all loud in their praise or the care
and attention shown them by the mem
bers of the other clubs and bv the
Regatta Committee. The men who
composed the crew of the ill-fated
barge were Captain .T. C. Huston, '10.
C. L. Scbaupp. '12, R. R. Gllmore, 'IL\
R. H. Seward, '12, and F. L. Guerena.
