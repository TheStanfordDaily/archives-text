A sermon timely in the subject
dealt with and trenchant in Its sug
gestions of the proper application or

terday in the University Chapel by the
Reverend 1). Charles Gardner. "Chris
tianity and Social Duty" was the
theme of I lie Chaplain's discourse, the
text of which was "Bear ye one an
other's burdens and so fulfill tlie law
of Christ." He said in part:
"Christ's greatest contribution to
social life is the law of brotherhood
based on the law of love. The world
calls you to selfishness and indul
gence, but Christ calls you to service.
The law of love finds its first applica
tion at the fireside. A good husband
is not only a good provider, nut a good
friend.
"Personal sympathy is the most
helpful form of social service. You
cannot pay other people to bear your
brother's burden. The motive of true
charity is love, and this, me great
personal element, is often lost in the
machinery of organized charity.
"The republic needs men and women
to carry on a program of national
righteousness. Whatever your place
or profession in life, it is your duty
to fight for political and economic
.justice. The labor movement, social
ism, the administration of justice, and
the great problems of war and poverty
are subjects which need our sincerest
t vuly.
