# STANFORD WINS FROM CASTAWAYS
## Varsity Easily Defeats Southern Team in Match at Los Angeles.— Score of 41 to 0 Made Largely by Forwards. 
### 
Eleven tries and four conversions
gave the Cardinal a total of 41 points
in the Stanford-Castaway rugby game
on Occidental Field, Los Angeles, last
Saturday afternoon. The Southerners
failed to score. Owing to numerous
recent injuries the Castaways were
in an extremely crippled condition and
consequently were totally unable to
withstand the weight of the Cardinal
pack and the speed of the backfiekl.
It was a distinctly forward game,
the varsity scrum registering the great
majority of the points. Six of the
eleven tries were tallied in the first
half, five in the second. Only four
goals were successfully kicked, two
by Crawford and two by S. Mitchell.
Within five minutes after the open
ing kick-off, Reed secured from a
scrum on the 5-yard line and passed
to M. Mitchell who scored. The sec
ond try was similar to a great number
of those registered in that it was
wholly due to the ability of the
heavy Cardinal pack to force its way
through the opposing scrum. A drib
bling rush of 20 yards ended with
Pemberton getting possession and
scoring. After another dribbling ad
vance, Crawford secured and just
! managed to plough across the line
before being downed by Dills. Craw
ford also went over for the fourth
try, S. Mitchell transferring to him
| close to the line after a spectacular
I 35-yard run. Three more points were
added by the iierce rushes of the var
j siiy pack, Pemberton scoring. Here
! Crawford missed his fifth consecutive

goal. After the drop-out, Cheda was
given the ball on the Castaways' 25-
line, and he succeeded in dashing
through his opponents for the final
try of the first half. S. Mitchell's con
version made the score 21 to 0.
Stanford opened the second half
with a beautiful passing rush, in which
Reed, M. Mitchell, S. Mitchell, and
Sanborn were the prominent figures,
the last-named tallying. The varsity
pack again begun its terrific advances,
and in a few minutes Thorpe and
Pemberton had registered two more
tries. Kern's !0-yar<J run netted
the Cardinal another three points.
Dole then spectacularly blocked Ca
ley's drop-out and rushed across the
line for the last try of the game.

Eleven tries and four conversions
gave the Cardinal a total of 41 points
in the Stanford-Castaway rugby game
on Occidental Field, Los Angeles, last
Saturday afternoon. The Southerners
failed to score. Owing to numerous
recent injuries the Castaways were
in an extremely crippled condition and
consequently were totally unable to
withstand the weight of the Cardinal
pack and the speed of the backfiekl.
It was a distinctly forward game,
the varsity scrum registering the great
majority of the points. Six of the
eleven tries were tallied in the first
half, five in the second. Only four
goals were successfully kicked, two
by Crawford and two by S. Mitchell.
Within five minutes after the open
ing kick-off, Reed secured from a
scrum on the 5-yard line and passed
to M. Mitchell who scored. The sec
ond try was similar to a great number
of those registered in that it was
wholly due to the ability of the
heavy Cardinal pack to force its way
through the opposing scrum. A drib
bling rush of 20 yards ended with
Pemberton getting possession and
scoring. After another dribbling ad
vance, Crawford secured and just
! managed to plough across the line
before being downed by Dills. Craw
ford also went over for the fourth
try, S. Mitchell transferring to him
| close to the line after a spectacular
I 35-yard run. Three more points were
added by the iierce rushes of the var
j siiy pack, Pemberton scoring. Here
! Crawford missed his fifth consecutive

goal. After the drop-out, Cheda was
given the ball on the Castaways' 25-
line, and he succeeded in dashing
through his opponents for the final
try of the first half. S. Mitchell's con
version made the score 21 to 0.
Stanford opened the second half
with a beautiful passing rush, in which
Reed, M. Mitchell, S. Mitchell, and
Sanborn were the prominent figures,
the last-named tallying. The varsity
pack again begun its terrific advances,
and in a few minutes Thorpe and
Pemberton had registered two more
tries. Kern's !0-yar<J run netted
the Cardinal another three points.
Dole then spectacularly blocked Ca
ley's drop-out and rushed across the
line for the last try of the game.
The teams lined up as follows:
Stanford—Fitting, Cheda, Morton,
Minturn, Dole, Thorpe, Pemberton,
Crawford, forwards; Reed, half; M.
Mitchell, S. Mitchell, fives; Roth, San
