This issue of the Daily Palo Alto
contains a report oL' the action of the
Executive Committee in completing
arrangements for the Fotball Show on
the night of ill* 1 Intercollegiate game
by placing the staging of the produc
tion in the hands of the Combined
Clubs and a statement by the Foot
ball Show Committee in which the
members defend themselves against
an implication of inability arising out
of the acceptance of their resignation.
The history of the attempt to stage
a Football Show in Assembly Jlall on
the evening of November 13, from the
date of the resolution of the Execu
tive Committee appointing a commit
tee to manage this production, to the
present time, has been too complicated
to admit of recital here. Nor is the
detail of the arrangement and prepra
ation for this event of any especial
interest to the Student Body. The
undergraduates as a whole are in
terested only in the culmination of
these plans and the staging 01 an
enjoyable and successful production
as a means of celebrating uie varsity
contest —that ii will celebrate a vic
tory is our hope.
The disagreements *n regard to the
method of staging this show have
involved the Executive Committee, the
Football Show Committee and the
Combined Clubs. Without a recital
of these difficulties it is our belief that
the larger part arose out of misun
derstandings by one party or the
other. It is our belief that lliese might
have been obviated by a more concil
iatory and harmonious attitude on the
part of all concerned, but when the
disagreement had arisen, the Execu
tive Committee was forced to ileal
with the situation as it existed.
As representatives of the Student
Body, this committee was responsible
for the presentation of a Football
Show. The time remaining allowed
only the one course—the production
of a vaudeville performance. Two
methods of staging this were pre
sented; it might be done by the Foot
ball Show Committee, or by the Com
bined Musical Clubs. But they re
fused to work in harmonius conjunc
tion. In keeping with the original
resolution that, if posible, the Com
bined Clubs be allowed to stage the
Football Show, the decision of the
Executive Committee was made to

place the staging of the vaudeville in
the hands of the Musical organizations
and itself retain the business man
agement, accepting the resignation oi
tho Show Committee.
it is our opinion that tins action
was not due to any lack of confidenct
in the ability of tbe Show Committee
to stage a suitable performance nor
was it intended as a criticism of the
committee as then constituted. The
Executive Committee was confronted
wilh the problem of securing a Foot
ball Show, and tlie failure of the Show
Commttee and the Combined Clubs
to act in harmony necessitated a
choice between them. That the selec
tion was the performance offered by
the clubs was not due to a belief that
the other was inferior but was in
keeping with the primary idea that
the Combined Clubs produce 1 lie Foot
ball Show, in justice to the members
of the Football Show Committee it
must be said that after reorganization
[their work was done efficiently and
well. Their resignation was accepted
as a matter of expediency, after a
meeting in which both sides of the
case were thoroughly presented to the
Executive Committee.
The argument advanced by the mem
bers of the Football Show Committee
that due courtesy should have entitled
them to a hearing and report of prog
ress before interruption of their plans
and withdrawal of their powers, ap
pears well founded. In this matter
the Executive Committee failed to take
cognizance of the rights of a com
mittee constituted by its own art.
On the other hand tlie ratification of
the previous action after a hearing
of both sides leaves t lie situation un
altered except in so far as the pre
mature action of t lie Executive Com
mittee effected the dispute between
the Show Committee and the Combined
Clubs.
After a survey of Ihe entire situa
tion, it appears that all the misun
derstanding and consequent distaste
ful results might have been obviated
by the maintenance of a more liberal
and tolerent view on the part of some
interested. The emphasis of personal
or selfish motives in a matter which
concerns the Student Body seems
petty and unworthy the actions of
men. Bickering and quarreling over
the degree of control or credit for a
production which is given as a Student
Body performance, as evidenced in the
attitude of the club, should be beneath
the dignity of Stanford men. Such
petty emphasis on matters of pre
cedence or personality as character
ized certain parts of ibis controversy
are inconsistent with any cultivation
of a proper Stanford Spirit in regard
to student activities.

This issue of the Daily Palo Alto
contains a report oL' the action of the
Executive Committee in completing
arrangements for the Fotball Show on
the night of ill* 1 Intercollegiate game
by placing the staging of the produc
tion in the hands of the Combined
Clubs and a statement by the Foot
ball Show Committee in which the
members defend themselves against
an implication of inability arising out
of the acceptance of their resignation.
The history of the attempt to stage
a Football Show in Assembly Jlall on
the evening of November 13, from the
date of the resolution of the Execu
tive Committee appointing a commit
tee to manage this production, to the
present time, has been too complicated
to admit of recital here. Nor is the
detail of the arrangement and prepra
ation for this event of any especial
interest to the Student Body. The
undergraduates as a whole are in
terested only in the culmination of
these plans and the staging 01 an
enjoyable and successful production
as a means of celebrating uie varsity
contest —that ii will celebrate a vic
tory is our hope.
The disagreements *n regard to the
method of staging this show have
involved the Executive Committee, the
Football Show Committee and the
Combined Clubs. Without a recital
of these difficulties it is our belief that
the larger part arose out of misun
derstandings by one party or the
other. It is our belief that lliese might
have been obviated by a more concil
iatory and harmonious attitude on the
part of all concerned, but when the
disagreement had arisen, the Execu
tive Committee was forced to ileal
with the situation as it existed.
As representatives of the Student
Body, this committee was responsible
for the presentation of a Football
Show. The time remaining allowed
only the one course—the production
of a vaudeville performance. Two
methods of staging this were pre
sented; it might be done by the Foot
ball Show Committee, or by the Com
bined Musical Clubs. But they re
fused to work in harmonius conjunc
tion. In keeping with the original
resolution that, if posible, the Com
bined Clubs be allowed to stage the
Football Show, the decision of the
Executive Committee was made to

place the staging of the vaudeville in
the hands of the Musical organizations
and itself retain the business man
agement, accepting the resignation oi
tho Show Committee.
it is our opinion that tins action
was not due to any lack of confidenct
in the ability of tbe Show Committee
to stage a suitable performance nor
was it intended as a criticism of the
committee as then constituted. The
Executive Committee was confronted
wilh the problem of securing a Foot
ball Show, and tlie failure of the Show
Commttee and the Combined Clubs
to act in harmony necessitated a
choice between them. That the selec
tion was the performance offered by
the clubs was not due to a belief that
the other was inferior but was in
keeping with the primary idea that
the Combined Clubs produce 1 lie Foot
ball Show, in justice to the members
of the Football Show Committee it
must be said that after reorganization
[their work was done efficiently and
well. Their resignation was accepted
as a matter of expediency, after a
meeting in which both sides of the
case were thoroughly presented to the
Executive Committee.
The argument advanced by the mem
bers of the Football Show Committee
that due courtesy should have entitled
them to a hearing and report of prog
ress before interruption of their plans
and withdrawal of their powers, ap
pears well founded. In this matter
the Executive Committee failed to take
cognizance of the rights of a com
mittee constituted by its own art.
On the other hand tlie ratification of
the previous action after a hearing
of both sides leaves t lie situation un
altered except in so far as the pre
mature action of t lie Executive Com
mittee effected the dispute between
the Show Committee and the Combined
Clubs.
After a survey of Ihe entire situa
tion, it appears that all the misun
derstanding and consequent distaste
ful results might have been obviated
by the maintenance of a more liberal
and tolerent view on the part of some
interested. The emphasis of personal
or selfish motives in a matter which
concerns the Student Body seems
petty and unworthy the actions of
men. Bickering and quarreling over
the degree of control or credit for a
production which is given as a Student
Body performance, as evidenced in the
attitude of the club, should be beneath
the dignity of Stanford men. Such
petty emphasis on matters of pre
cedence or personality as character
ized certain parts of ibis controversy
are inconsistent with any cultivation
of a proper Stanford Spirit in regard
to student activities.
