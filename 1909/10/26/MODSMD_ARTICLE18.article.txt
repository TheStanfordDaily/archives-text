# WILL PREVENT FRAUD
## STANFORD AND CALIFORNIA MEN TO WATCH CITY POLLS. Over Three Hundred College Men to Aid Good Government League in Coming Election. 
### 
One hundred and fifty-six Stanford
students will co-operate with the Good
Government League of San Francisco
in preventing fraud in the coming
municipal election in that city. Thai
number of men will be made up from
all those who desire to participate,
and who hand in their names to a
campus committee. An equal number
of students will be selected from the
University of California, making a
total of <512 college men to take part
in the election. The Stanford list
already includes over a hundred
names, and the full list, it is expected,
will be completed within a few days.
Tuesday, November 2 being election
day, the men will leave on that after
noon on the 3:03 train for San Fran
cisco, and one will be assigned to each
polling place for the evening during
the vote-counting. San Francisco res
idents will also co-operate with the
students in watching the votes. There
are 312 polling places in the city, and
the other half of this number will be
assigned to California men. Special
rates have been secured for railroad
tickets, and for meals while in the
city. These will probably be arranged
for at the Bismarck Cafe, where the
students will take dinner together
Tuesday night. For all expenses each
student will be paid $5. It is prob
able that a meeting will be called on
the campus a few days before the
election, at which the nature of the
work will be explained by a San Fran
cisco lawyer. All men wishing to take
advantage of this opportunity, and who
have not already handed in their
names, should give them to one of
the following six men as soon as pos
sible: E. M. Leaf, '10, L. C. F. Pick
ering, '09. W. C. Shelton, 'OS, P. J.
Batkin, '10, R. I?. Murphey, 'OS, H. R.
Stolz, '09.
