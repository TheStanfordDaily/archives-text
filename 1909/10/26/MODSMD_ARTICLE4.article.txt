Editor of the"Daily Palo Alto":
The undersigned members of the
football show committee consider that
their resignation with their labors
quite unfinished justifies a defensive
explanation.
The executive committee of the As
sociated Students appointed the foot
ball show committee to produce a
football show on the evening of the
intercollegiate varsity game. Owing
to continued absences from the cam
pus and to his arduous duties as
graduate manager, D. W. Burbank,
who was then chairman, was unable
to devote sufficient time to the foot
ball show. None of the other mem
bers of this committee had authority
to call a meeting, and, according, noth
ing had been accomplished by October
20. On that evening the Executive
Committee of the Associated Students,
at. Mr. Burbank's request, relieved
him of the chairmanship and appointed
W. P. Fuller, Jr. to acr. in his stead.
The thus re-arranged football show
committee within thirty-six hours-com
pleted arrangements with the leaders
of the Combined Musical Clubs to
present a vaudeville performance.
Through a series of misunderstand
ings, however, the executive committee
of the combined clubs refused to rat
ify the plans of their leaders and ap
pealed to the executive committee of
the Associated Students for the sole

and exclusive right to give the vaude
ville performance. The football show
committee was completely ignorant
of the dissatisfaction of the combined
clubs. Unable to procure the attend
ance of the chairman or any member
of the football show committee, never
theless the executive committee of the
Associated Students, less than forty
eight hours after rearranging the foot
ball show committee, without offering
the chairman any opportunity to re
port progress and without hearing
from any member of the committee,
proceeded to pass a resolution giving
the combined clubs complete charge
of the staging of the vaudeville per
formance as a football show, leaving
the football show committee merely
the power to audit the accounts, pay
the bills and advertise the production.
Thereupon the football show commit
tee offered to resign, because —
First—Lack of confidence in the
ability of the football show commit
tee on the part of the executive com
mittee of the Associated Students was
the necessary implication from the
act of the executive committee in pas
sing a resolution which invaded the
domain of the football show commit
tee without- giving that committee a
chance to speak.
Second —The resolution left the
football show committee practically
powerless, and thus it was futile for
the members to remain In office.
The prompt acceptance of the ten
dered resignations strengthens the
implication of fthe executive com
mittee's lack of confidence. The pur
pose of this explanation is to prove

As re-arranged on October 20, the
football show committee was ready,
willing and able to stage a thoroughly

of the executive committee denied the
football show committee a fair oppor

the latter committee merely wish to

would have stated to the executive
committee, if they had ever been given

the combined clubs complete charge
