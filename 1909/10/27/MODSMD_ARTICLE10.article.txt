# ROUNDING INTO FORM
## VARSITY WITH LINE-UP ALMOST INTACT, DEFEATS SCRUBS. Second Team in All Its Strength Cannot Hold Regulars, Who Score 22 Points. 
### 
Practically every man on the foot
ball squad took part in a thirty-minute
set-to on the turf field yesterday after
noon. The varsity, with its line-up
almost intact, put the ball over the
second-team line for six tries, which,
with two conversions, totaled 22 points,
its opponents scoring nine. Roth, at
center, and Cook, at wing, were the
only regulars absent, owing to tem
porary injuries. Their places were
taken by Tow lie and Kern, respec
tively. S. Mitchell, the only other
I Freshman on the first-team line-up,
I seems to have fitted naturally into a
j varsity second five position, and played
well. He alternated with Crawford
jin goal-kicking, the advantage, how
ever, going to the older player. Cap
tain Mitchell figured in many of the
scoring rushes, as did also Holman,
Kern, Crawford, Pemberton and Min
turn. Reed, at half, was unfortunate
in some of his long passes, but was
always sure in securing possession.
Elliott, replacing him, was too eager
to do really good work, The second!
team showed remarkable fight for
their disadvantage In weight, and their
effective resistance during the greater
part of the last period created much
applause.
There will be another line-up simi
lar to this to-morrow afternoon at
3:45.
