The recent controversy over the
eligibility of D. P. Crawford to com
pete in the Intercollegiate rugby
match has pointed out some very ser
ious defects in the present intercol
legiate agreement. That Crawford is
eligible under the present wording is
indisputable, nor was it* Uie intention
of the framers of the present Agree
ment to exclude players who occupied
the present status of the former var
sity captain. Both the letter and spirit
of the agreement warrant the decision
made by the Faculty Athletic Commit
tee —a decision which will be received
with universal satisfaction by the
Stanford Student Body.
But though, in the present instance,
the interpretation of the wording al
lowed a decision consistent with the
equity of the case, the present Agree
ment is far too ambiguous for a docu
ment which governs the relations be
tween two universities. Disputes in
evitably arise and the means of de
ciding these disagreements should not
lie capable of varied constructions.
At a recent meeting of the Agreement
Committee it, was demonstrated that
there are ten different interpretations
which might be construed from the
wording of the existing Agreement,
while under one of these it would be
posible for a player to remain in col
lege eight years, competing every
year, and still be eligible for an in
tercollegiate team.
Such ambiguity can result only in
disputes incapable of satisfactory set
tlement. When the Agreement Com
mittee meets to frame the new docu
ment which will supersede the pres
ent Agreement at the close of this se
mester, attention should be directed
toward the drafting of an Agreement
which will furnish an indisputable
basis for the guidance of the two uni
versities and the settlement of dis
putes arising out of the Intercollegiate
relations.
