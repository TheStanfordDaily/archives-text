# OFFERS MONEY PRIZE
## FIFTY DOLLARS FOR BEST ADDRESS OK WORLD'S PEACE. American Peace Society Establishes Annual Oratorical Contest by Generous Gift. 
### 
An important step in the progress
of forensic contests in the University
has been made by the recent action
of the California Branch of tne Amer
ican Peace Society, in offering a prize
of fifty dollars to the person deliver
ing the best oration on any subject
promoting international peace. It Is
planned to hold a contest, on the eve
ning of November 29, and to limit the
speakers to six in number.
It is felt that this prize will do
much to stimulate the lagging inter
est in oratory, which has ueen dis
countenanced by the predominating
attention paid in Stanford (o debating.
All the addresses must be delivered
without manuscript and each contes
tant will be allowed fifteen minutes
to present his views.
The regulations of the contest were
determined by a committee composed
of G. F. Morgan, '10, and P. J. Batkin,
'10, in conjunction with the Faculty
Committee on Literary Contests, it
will be open to all the students In
the University, but intending contest
ants must register their names not
later than November 15 with the Com
mittee on Literary Contests. If more
than six enter, a preliminary contest
will lie arranged to reduce the number
of speakers in the finals within that
limit. The judges, three in number,
will be chosen from the Faculty, and
the prize will be awarded to that
speaker whose address in the opinion
of the judges, seems most effective in
promoting the cause of International
peace. It is planned to make this
contest as permanent a feature in
forensic activities as the Bonnheim
Dissertation or the Carnot Debate.
