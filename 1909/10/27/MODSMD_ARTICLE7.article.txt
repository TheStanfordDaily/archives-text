# CRAWFORD IS ELIGIBLE
## WILL BE ALLOWED TO PLAY IN VARSITY RIG BY GAME. Athletic Committee Includes Former Captain in Eligible List Sent to California. 
### 
After careful consideration of all
the arguments in the matter, the Fac
ulty Athletic Committee has decided
that D. P. Crawford, '09, is eligible
to play in the Varsity Football game
on November 13. The whole decision
of the question rests on the inter
pretation of the term "college year"
used in the Intercollegiate agreement.
The common acceptance of one of
the clauses is that if any man does
not take part in intercollegiate ath
letics for one college year, that year
| would not count against him in the
consideration of the effects of the four
year rule.
Prior to 1905 this term "college
year" was taken to mean two succes
sive semesters beginning in the fall
of the year. Owing to the insertion of
additional clauses at this time, how
ever, the agreement was so interpreted
as to mean two successive semesters
beginning with either the fall or
spring terms.
As Crawford did not participate in
athletics during the spring term of
his freshman year and the fall term of
his sophomore years, he thus comes
under this ruling. In the dispute over
the clause the Intercollegiate agree
ment committee was evenly divided
in its interpretation, but as they were
not the final arbiters in the ques
tion, their deadlock caused no dif
ference in the final adjustment.
The list sent to California which in
■ eludes the names of fifty-seven men
