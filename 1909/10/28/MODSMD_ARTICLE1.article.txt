# OUTPLAY VANCOUVER
## CALIFORNIA TAKES FIRST GAME FROM NORTHERNERS. Superior Weight and Speed Brings Victory to Blue and Gold. Score, 24-3. 
### 
The first of the Vancouver sanies
on California Field yesterday brought
a decided victory to the California
team. With more speed and weight
they overcame the Northerners by ihe
one-sided score of 24-3. In criticiz
ing the playing, however, it must be
taken into account that this is Van
couver's first contest in the south,
with but two days' practice. Not
withstanding, the northern team this
season cannot be said to equal the
standard of last year. Their forwards
are fast in following up, but this
cannot offset their lightness. The
backs, as shown in yesterday's game,
were slow in kicking, and lost many
chances for gains and consequent
scoring by this means.
The California team came up to ex
pectations and displayed a good
knowledge of the game and cool
headedness. The forwards were good,
but played an individual game, rather
than one in which team work was
predominant. The great criticism oi
the backs centers in their inability to
pass accurately. Their wild throws
discounts the speed they have devel
oped.
Vancouver scored its first and only
try a few minutes after the opening
of the game. California registered <;
tries and 3 conversions, Elliott and
the Freshman Stroud doing the goal
kicking. Besides Stroud, the Ber
keley team used two other first-year
men, Peartt and draff. Captain Byrne,
of Vancouver, was easily the star for
his team.
