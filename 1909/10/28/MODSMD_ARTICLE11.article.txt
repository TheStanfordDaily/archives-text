Considerable comment has been oc
casioned by the growing tendency of
the men on the bleachers at the prac
tice rugby games to laugh at the
blunders or misfortunes of the players
on the field. That such indulgence in
unrestrained appreciation of the
humorous situations of the contests is
meant in any other spirit than per
fect good comradship is not in any
way insinuated. But a loud laugh
from the bleachers when a man fails
in the execution of a difficult play or
when a runner is tackeled unexpect
edly and thrown hard, has the effect
of making the players self-conscious,
thus preventing the most efficient
work in the game. The thought of
their appearance before the bleachers
is forced upon the players and to a
certain degree detracts from their
concentration on the contest. Nor
is a player impressed with the loyalty
of the bleachers when he is ridiculed
upon getting up from a hard fall.
The correction of this tendency does
not necessitate the obviation of all
good-humored enjoyment of the var
sity contests or the conversion of the
rooting section into a Quaker meet
ing. It simply requires that the ex
pression of this enjoyment of hum
orous situations be restrained from
reaching the ears of the men on the
field.
