# "THE CHIMES OF NORMANDY" FRIDAY
## Planquette's Famous Comic Opera Will Be Produced by the Schubert Club Tomorrow Evening in Assembly Hall. 
### 
The second theatrical production of
the college year will be Robert Plan
quette's four-act comic opera, "The
Chimes of Normandy," which will be
heard in the Assembly Hall on Fri
day evening. The performance is I>e
ing staged by the Schubert Club, which
has spared neither expense nor energy
to make the production the most bril
liant and complete operatic success
ever undertaken by Stanford ama
teurs.
The cast comprises ;i large number
of people extremely well known to
college play-goers, while a few prin
ciples of marked ability will make
their debut on the Stanford stage to
morrow night. The women's chorus
is composed of the most talented
singers in the ranks of the Schubert
Club. The chorus of men was selected
only after careful and exhaustive try
outs under the supervision of Director
Bartlett.
Of all the principals none has a
more justly deserved or finer dramatic
reputation than Miss R. A. Roberts,
'Of#, of San Jose, to whom the role
of Germaine has been entrusted. .Miss
Roberts will undoubtedly make the
hit of the piece. Her voice is indeed
unusual for an amateur, and it will
be heard to the best advantage in the
many numbers which Germaine is
called upon to sing. Furthermore,
than Miss Roberts there is no more
talented actress now at Stanford.
As Serpolette, Miss M. G. Herdman,
12, will appear before a university
orchestra for the first time. The
charm of her high, clear soprano is
unmistakable.
Among the men, G. F. Morgan, '10,
will add another triumph to his al
ready long list. The ridiculous Bailli
will give Morgan full opportunity for
his finished comedy. The extremely
intense role of the miser, Gaspard.
will be acted convincingly and snug
artistically by P. F. Pettigrew, '10.
C. A. Christin, '11, will give a pleas
ing portrayal of the difficult part of
Henri, while E. Kobbe, '11, should suc
ceed instantaneously as Jean Gren
icheux, the tenor fisherman. t \V. P.
Fuller, Jr., will be the Notary.

The iiniveraitj orchestra lias been
thoroughly trained by Director Bart
lett and lias appeared at several re
cent rehearsals. The final dress re
hearsal was held to-night.
The tuneful music of the opera is
well known, but a short sketch of
, the plot will not be amiss.
Henri. Marquis of Corneville, who
j has been an exile since childhood, re
! turns to his home on the occasion of
the great annual fair. Gaspard, an
old miser, wishes to marry his niece,


Miss IE A. Roberts as Germaine.
Germaine, to the 1 Ja.illi, the principal
magistrate of the district. This ar
rangement suits neither Germaine nor
Jean Grenicheux, a young fisherman,
who falsely pretends that he once
saved her from drowning. To escape
from the power of old Gaspard, Ger
maine takes advantage of the privi
leges of the fair and becomes the serv
ant ol the Marquis.
Henri determines to find out the
real character of the supernatural
visitors who have long made Ihe
Chateau of Corneville an object of
dread. He discovers that it is all (he
work of the old miser who has con
cealed his treasures in the Chateau.
This discovery drives Gaspard crazy.
At the grand fete given in honor of
the return of Henri to his ancestral

home, Serpolette arrives as the Mar
chioness De Lucenay, for some papers
which were found in the chateau in
dicate that she is the last heiress.
The miser, however, recovering his
reason, proves that Germaine is the
true Marchioness. The reconciliation
of all brings the story to a close.
The curtain will rise promptly at
8:15, and no one will be seated there
after save during the intermissions.

day evening. The performance is I>e
ing staged by the Schubert Club, which
has spared neither expense nor energy
to make the production the most bril
liant and complete operatic success
ever undertaken by Stanford ama
teurs.
The cast comprises ;i large number
of people extremely well known to
college play-goers, while a few prin
ciples of marked ability will make
their debut on the Stanford stage to
morrow night. The women's chorus
is composed of the most talented
singers in the ranks of the Schubert
Club. The chorus of men was selected
only after careful and exhaustive try
outs under the supervision of Director
Bartlett.
Of all the principals none has a
more justly deserved or finer dramatic
reputation than Miss R. A. Roberts,
'Of#, of San Jose, to whom the role
of Germaine has been entrusted. .Miss
Roberts will undoubtedly make the
hit of the piece. Her voice is indeed
unusual for an amateur, and it will
be heard to the best advantage in the
many numbers which Germaine is
called upon to sing. Furthermore,
than Miss Roberts there is no more
talented actress now at Stanford.
As Serpolette, Miss M. G. Herdman,
12, will appear before a university
orchestra for the first time. The
charm of her high, clear soprano is
unmistakable.
Among the men, G. F. Morgan, '10,
will add another triumph to his al
ready long list. The ridiculous Bailli
will give Morgan full opportunity for
his finished comedy. The extremely
intense role of the miser, Gaspard.
will be acted convincingly and snug
artistically by P. F. Pettigrew, '10.
C. A. Christin, '11, will give a pleas
ing portrayal of the difficult part of
Henri, while E. Kobbe, '11, should suc
ceed instantaneously as Jean Gren
icheux, the tenor fisherman. t \V. P.
Fuller, Jr., will be the Notary.

The iiniveraitj orchestra lias been
thoroughly trained by Director Bart
lett and lias appeared at several re
cent rehearsals. The final dress re
hearsal was held to-night.
The tuneful music of the opera is
well known, but a short sketch of

Henri. Marquis of Corneville, who
j has been an exile since childhood, re
! turns to his home on the occasion of
the great annual fair. Gaspard, an
old miser, wishes to marry his niece,


Miss IE A. Roberts as Germaine.
Germaine, to the 1 Ja.illi, the principal
magistrate of the district. This ar
rangement suits neither Germaine nor
Jean Grenicheux, a young fisherman,
who falsely pretends that he once
saved her from drowning. To escape
from the power of old Gaspard, Ger
maine takes advantage of the privi
leges of the fair and becomes the serv
ant ol the Marquis.
Henri determines to find out the
real character of the supernatural
visitors who have long made Ihe
Chateau of Corneville an object of
dread. He discovers that it is all (he
work of the old miser who has con
cealed his treasures in the Chateau.
This discovery drives Gaspard crazy.
At the grand fete given in honor of
the return of Henri to his ancestral

home, Serpolette arrives as the Mar
chioness De Lucenay, for some papers
which were found in the chateau in
dicate that she is the last heiress.
The miser, however, recovering his
reason, proves that Germaine is the
true Marchioness. The reconciliation
of all brings the story to a close.
The curtain will rise promptly at
8:15, and no one will be seated there
after save during the intermissions.
