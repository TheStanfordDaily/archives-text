# FARCE IN GYMNASIUM
## PLACE FOR PLUG UGLY CHOSEN BY COMMITTEE. First Floor of Wrecked Building to Be Used for Presentation of Class Play. 
### 
Arrangements have been finally
made by the Junior Plug Ugly Com
mittee for the securing of a suitable
place for the presentation of the class
farce that is usually given as a part
of the program of the class rush. Per
mission has been obtained by the com
mittee to use the floor of the new
gymnasium, and according to the pres
ent plans of the board that is manag
ing this part of the Plug Ugly, a tem
porary staging and sullicient seating
facilities will soon be erected there.
This situation was secured by the
committee on account of the available
room that they would be able to ob
tain for seating facilities and because
of the fact that the floor of the
gymnasium has a slope that is suffi
cient to allow the entire audience an
uninterrupted view of the stage.
The committee has made a final
selection of the .Juniors who will take
part in the farce as members of the
cast and has asigned the various parts
that they will assume. The cast will
comprise about twenty characters.
The farce has been accepted by the
.Junior Plug Ugly Committete as it
\v;is submitted by the three Juniors
who jointly wrote the ]>lay and pre
paration for the presentation of the
result will l>e begun at once. The
play partakes of the nature of a bur
lesque, and although it resembles in
character the former Plug Ugly farces,
certain features have been eliminated.
