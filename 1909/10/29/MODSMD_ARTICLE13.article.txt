The rugby game between the Reli
ance Club and the second varsity
team to-morrow is a deserved recog
nition of the work of the second-team
players during the present season.
The men on the substitute fifteen have
trained hard throughout the year with
out. an outside game or trip. The op
position furnished by this fifteen has
furnished the best practice for the
varsity and done more ro develop a
strong defensive organization for the
Stanford team than any of the
matches with outside clubs. An op
portunity to play an independent
game is a well-deserved reward for
the efficient services of the second
team players.
