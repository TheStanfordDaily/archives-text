# Trampers Shorten Morning's Walk.
## 
### 
In order that they may be back on
the campus in time to see the Varsity-
Olympic game, the members of the
Stanford Trampers have so arranged
their walk to Woodside that those who
wish may be back before noon. All
will be back by 3 o'clock. The trip
is to be taken under the leadership
of A. M. Bates, '12.
