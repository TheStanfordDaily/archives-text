# VARSITY AND SECOND TEAM PLAY
## Olympic and Reliance Clubs Will Meet the Two Cardinal Fifteens Tomorrow.— First Team Line-up to be Strong. 
### 
The varsity will present its full
strength to the Olympic Club to-iuor
row on Stanford Field when it meets
that team for the third time this sea
son. This contest is scheduled for
3:45, while, as a preliminary, the sec
ond team will meet the Reliance Club
of Oakland at 2:30. Fifty cents admis
sion will be charged for the two
games. The varsity match will afford
followers of the Rugby season an op
portunity for seeing the cardinal team
play with its most efficient line-up.
The backfield will present a solid
front of fast men, for the most part
veterans, Roth and Cook having re
joined the first-team ranks after their
short period of rest. The scrum will
be intact, and the whole fifteen should
prove a wonderful working unit. The
Olympic Club will be weakened ma
terially by the loss of its captain and
J. O. Miller, 'OS, who suffered a broken
wrist in last Saturday's game with the
California varsity. D. Webster will
take bis place in the three-quarter
line. Among the new players in the
winged Mercury line-up is G. C. Faulk
ner, ex-'lO, who played fullback on
the cardinal varsity last year. He is
filling the same position on the visit
ing team to-morrow. In the Reliance
Club, the second team will have a
strong opponent. The Oakland team
made a good showing against the Cal
ifornia Varsity in one of the early
games of the Blue and Gold schedule.
With the Reliance team is Captain El
liott, of the Barbarians, who will be a
powerful addition to his men as one
of the two halves. Farmer, a former

California varsity player, will proba
bly be included in the scrum, and
will add much strength to the fifteen,
it is probable that many substitutes
will be used in the cardinal second
fifteen, and the preliminary contest
promises to be a well-matched strug
gle.
It is possible that several Barbar
ian rugby men may play with the
Olympic team to-morrow, providing
a full line-up cannot be secured, on
account ol the short time in which
the game was arranged for.

Olympic team to-morrow, providing
a full line-up cannot be secured, on
account ol the short time in which
the game was arranged for.
The line-ups:
Varsity—Cheda, Fitting, Horton,
Minturn, Dole, Crawford, Pemberton,
Thorpe, forwards; Reed, half; M.
Mitchell, S. Mitchell, fives; Roth, cen
ter; Cook, Holman, wings; Brown,
full.
Second Team —Nolan, Sanborn, A.,
Acker, Partridge, Swigart, George, C.
Pemberton, Hine, Doron, Bush, for
wards; Elliott, O'Bear, Dickinson,
half; Stolz, Arrell, fives; Towne, St.
John, center; Drew, Mackenzie, Mac
ready. wings; Fletcher, Gore, full.
Olympic Club —Trowbridge, Hickey,
Brown, Bay ley, Aguirre, Skov, Web
ster, Wallfisch, Freeman, forwards;
Erb. half; Briggs, D. Webster, fives;
Goodell, center; Laumeister, Cava
naugh, wings: Faulkner, full.
Reliance Club —Dryeborg, Dalton,
Farmer, Poniroy, Von Helms, Bishop,
Fairbanks, Twitchell, forwards; Ar
nott. Elliott, halves; Von Mander
shied, McElrath, Price, Harris, three
quarters; Jones, full.
The varsity will present its full
strength to the Olympic Club to-iuor
row on Stanford Field when it meets
that team for the third time this sea
son. This contest is scheduled for
3:45, while, as a preliminary, the sec
ond team will meet the Reliance Club
of Oakland at 2:30. Fifty cents admis
sion will be charged for the two
games. The varsity match will afford
followers of the Rugby season an op
portunity for seeing the cardinal team
play with its most efficient line-up.
The backfield will present a solid
front of fast men, for the most part
veterans, Roth and Cook having re
joined the first-team ranks after their
short period of rest. The scrum will
be intact, and the whole fifteen should
prove a wonderful working unit. The
Olympic Club will be weakened ma
terially by the loss of its captain and
J. O. Miller, 'OS, who suffered a broken
wrist in last Saturday's game with the
California varsity. D. Webster will
take bis place in the three-quarter
line. Among the new players in the
winged Mercury line-up is G. C. Faulk
ner, ex-'lO, who played fullback on
the cardinal varsity last year. He is
filling the same position on the visit
ing team to-morrow. In the Reliance
Club, the second team will have a
strong opponent. The Oakland team
made a good showing against the Cal
ifornia Varsity in one of the early
games of the Blue and Gold schedule.
With the Reliance team is Captain El
liott, of the Barbarians, who will be a
powerful addition to his men as one
of the two halves. Farmer, a former

California varsity player, will proba
bly be included in the scrum, and
will add much strength to the fifteen,
it is probable that many substitutes
will be used in the cardinal second
fifteen, and the preliminary contest
promises to be a well-matched strug
gle.
It is possible that several Barbar
ian rugby men may play with the
Olympic team to-morrow, providing
a full line-up cannot be secured, on
account ol the short time in which
the game was arranged for.
