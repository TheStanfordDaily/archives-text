Dr. Jordan will leave the campus
on November 12 for New York City
for the purpose of attending the regu
lar meeting of the Carnegie Founda
tion that is to be held in that city

On account of the resignation of Dr.

The object of this meeting of the or
ganization is the transaction of the
regular business of the Foundation
relative to the granting of pensions to
college professors and teachers of
various ranks.
After this meeting, Dr. Jordan will
go to Washington, D. C., for the pur
pose of conferring with President Taft
and Secretary of State Knox upon
matters relative to his work as a mem
ber of the International Boundaries
Commission. Dr. Jordan has served
for some time upon this board and,
in conjunction with Professor Prince,
of Toronto, who is the British Com
missioner upon the commission, has
been drawing up a series of laws and
regulations relative to the control of
the fisheries in international waters.
These regulations, when completed,
are to be approved and adopted by
Congress as the law of the country
with regard to disputes arising in
those matters.
Dr. Jordan and Professor Prince
will meet at the Arlington Hotel,
Washington, D. C., upon November 23
with the President and Secretary of
State, for this discussion.
Dr. Jordan will return to the west
immediately softer the consummation of
the business that will arise from his
connection with the International
Boundaries Commission, arriving in
California in the latter part of the
month of November.
