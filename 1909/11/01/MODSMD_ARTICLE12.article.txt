# PLUG UGLY ON DIAMOND
## NEW GYMNASIUM DEEMED IN ADEQUATE FOR SHOW. Plug Ugly Will Be Presented on Baseball Diamond.â€”Juniors Vote Money for Stunts. 
### 
A thorough discussion of the plans
for the Plug Ugly extravangaza and
rush next Friday evening was held
at the Junior class meeting to-day
and $25 was voted for the stnnts at
the big game.
The play will be presented on the
Varsity haseiiall diamond instead of
t lie new Gymnasium, as was an
nounced last week. As there is ground
to fear that the ruins might be some
what inadequate for this purpose, the
committee deemed it expedient to
make use of the baseball diamond. A
stage will be erected immediately in
front of tlie west bleachers. Canvas,
which has been purchased from the
1909 class, will be used to wing in ihe
stage and bleachers. The Dudtield
Lumber Compony, of Palo Alto, has
generously donated the use of all the
lumber needed in erecting tlie tem
porary stage. The illumination will
lie accomplished by wiring electricity
from Encina Gymnasium.
[n order to erect the stage the com
mittee has hsued a call for men of
the class to turn out every afternoon
this week and lend a hand. The con
struction will not be so intricate as
to require only engineers. The class
voted to ihe committee the necessary
money to cover the contingent ex
penses.
The Plug Ugly Committee also di
vulged several plans for the rush
which will follow the show. It will
be conducted on lines similar to pre
vious years, the Juniors attempting
to gain the Quadrangle at the tradi
tional stairs, making a rush around
the Inner Quadrangle, and then charg
ing the Seniors massed in the east
arch.
W. S. Porter as chairman of the
auditing committee reported a balance
of $491.87 on the books of last semes
ter, and found them to be correct.
