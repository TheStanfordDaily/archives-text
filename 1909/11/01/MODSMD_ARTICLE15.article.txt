Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Here at Stanford there is a situa
tion to which it would be well for our
anti-graft reformers to turn their at
tention. At almost every show, and
tliis was especially true of the "Chimes
of Normandy," there have been a num
ber of men who have made a practice
(if beating their way. They liave
sneaked in in various ways, and ap
propriated to themselves the same
privileges for which other members
of the community have had to pay
good money.
One of Ihe ticket takers 011 Friday
evening was roughly handled because

be would recognize no free-list. A
number of men with consummate
nerve walked through the unguarded
stage door and took seats in the front
rows of the main floor. One of the
unused gallery doors was secretly
opened and a few went in free t:f
charge in that way.
This practice is all wrong and
ought to be corrected. There is no
good reason why such ungentlemanly
conduct should be tolerated. We
ought to make it generally understood
that the privilege of wearing a bloc c
"S" does not include the privilege of
a free entrance to Assembly Hall pro
ductions, that the men of the Uni
versity are all on the same footing
in this regard, and that when an ad
mission is charged, the right, fail-,
just and gentlemanly thing to do it
to pay it or keep out and away from
the Assembly Hall.
The men who are paid to take
tickets ought not to be compelled to
look with suspicion on Stanford men
and to guard against their fellow stu
dents as they must against the youn;;
hopefuls from Palo Alto.
The important thing is to see that
in the future we have honesty and
gentlemanly conduct. The community
should foster a healthy sentiment in
regard to our own petty grafting.
