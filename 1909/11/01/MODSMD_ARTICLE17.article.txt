# RENDER OPERA WELL
## SCHUBERT CLUB'S PRODUCTION PLEASES AUDIENCE. Difficult Music of "Chimes of Normandy" Tunefully Sung on Friday Evening. 
### 
For amateurs to play Plansuette's
opera "The Chimes ol' Normandy" is
always an ambitions venture. In their
venture on Friday night the Schubert
Club was highly successful. The in
tricate and somewhat diflicult music
was tunefully sung, and the stage
spectacle was artistic and pleasing.
Loking back upon the performance
one must notice lirst the really cap
ital playing of the overture by the
University orchestra. It was admir
ably done, and deserves the highest
praise. The singing of the chorus was
good and hearty. Stanford will not
soon forget the delightful swing of the
"Ding Dong" chorus, or the melody
of "Silent Heroes."
Of the leading parts it is fair to say
that each was well done. But the
laurels go to Germaine, Gaspard and
the Bailli. Miss R. A. Roberts as
"Germaine" was winsome and pretty,
and sang and played like an artist.
The part of "Gaspard" is the star part
of the opera. It is distinctly an act
ing part, and P. F. Pettigrew gave
us an honest and earnest interpre
tation of it. Indeed the histrionic
ability displayed by Pettigrew was ;i
great surprise, llis singing voice i;-
always good, and therefore we could
forgive the failure to sustain an old
man's speaking voice to llie end. G.
F. Morgan as the Bailli looked, acted
and dressed more like a sportine judge
of that period than the sort of fat
witted person we associate with the
office of Bailli. But his business was
well done, the enunciation of his lines
a great comfort, and his dancing much
too professional for a church warden.
The notary and his assistants failed
to make the most of their parts.
Their "get up" was good, but their
comedy restrained.
When we thus distinguish between
Ihe characters, we do not forget I lie
conscientious work of the Marquis, the
Fisher lad or Serpolette. When it is
remembered that both Kobbe and
Christin literally got up from sick
beds to play their difficult parts, ii is
no less than marvellous that they
were so well sustained. And if Ser
polette was not as saucy and as vi
vacious as we might have wished, at
least Miss llerdeman gave her a char
acter all her own. She looked bonnie
as the serving maid and too aristo
cratic as the marchioness.
if we dare to criticize, it must be
one word of regret that Ihe opera was
not staged adequately. Neither the
scenery or the furnishing of the
scenes seemed to fii the dignity of the
opera.
While the Schubert Club is to be
congratulated on the general suc
cess of the difficult undertaking, the
chief credit for the delightful render
ing of the opera must go to W. P..

Bart let t, who as coach and chorus
director was indefatigable in his ef
forts to bring out the finer points in
the stage business as well as the
musical harmony.
