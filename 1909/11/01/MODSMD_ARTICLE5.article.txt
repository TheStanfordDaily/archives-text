# ELIGIBILITY DISPUTE IS CONTINUED
## California Asks for Faculty Board of Arbitration, but Executive Committee Refuses to Consider Continuation of Controversy. 
### 
Not satisfied with the outcome of
the recent controversy over the eligi
bility of players in the coming Inter
collegiate rugby match, the Associated
Students of California have attempted
to reopen the dispute by asking for
the appointment of an arbitration
board to review the decision of the
Faculty Athletic Committees.
In order to secure the appointment
of this arbitration board the Califor
nia Committee secured the interven
tion of the acting president of the
university who wrote to President
Jordan asking that he appoint the
Stanford members of such a board.
Dr. Jordan was of the opinion that
the whole matter was outside of the
jurisdiction of the faculty, as the
agreement was between the two stu
dent bodies. Dr. Angell supported the
president in this view and the coininu
cation from the acting president ol
California was submitted to the Ex
ecutive Committee.
At. a special session of this com
mittee on Saturday afternoon, a com
munication was sent to the Execu
tive Committee of U. C. stating that,
as the matter of eligibility, is under the
agreement, left entirely in the hands
of the respective Faculty Athletic
Committees, the decision made by the
Stanford committee was final and
closed the incident.
The correspondence in (lie matter
shows the attitude of all parties con
cerned and the present status of the
cont roversv.
Following is the letter received by
President Jordan from acting presi
dent Lange of California:
Berkeley, Oct. 29, 1909.
My Dear President Jordan:
The Executive Committee of the As
sociated Students of the University of
Californita has requested me under
Article IX, Section 2 of their Consti
tution, to appoint three men of tin*
board of six provided for in Article
111, Section 2 of the Intercollegiate
Agreement. Our executive committee
believes that the interpretation o
Article 11, Section (> of the Intercol
legiate Agreement should be discussed
by the representatives of both univer
sities before this board of arbitration,
inasmuch as the two faculty athletic
committees have met and have failed
to agree upon the question of the
meaning of Article 11, Section (!. The
members of our faculty athletic com
niitee, Professor Edmond O'Niell, Pro
fessor T. M. Putnam and Professor
R. T. Crawford, have signified their
willingness and wish that the question

be arbitrated before such a board.
I am ready to appoint the three
members of the arbitration board
which will represent the University
of California. May I hear from you
in regard to the three men vvno will
be appointed by Stanford University
for this board? We can then arrange
a time and place of meeting at the
earliest possible moment.
Very sincerely yours,
(Signed) ALEXIS F. LANGE.

Dear Sir:
In reply to your query regarding
the board of arbitration which Acting
President Lange writes of in his com
munication to you dated October 29,
1 beg to say that I do not consider
the formation of such a board lies
within the jurisdiction of this faculty.
I have received no communication
from the Executive Committee of the
Associated Students of Stanford Uni

safe to presume that the Committee
holds the same opinion.

Following is the letter received by
President Jordan from acting presi
dent Lange of California:
Berkeley, Oct. 29, 1909.
My Dear President Jordan:
The Executive Committee of the As
sociated Students of the University of
Californita has requested me under
Article IX, Section 2 of their Consti
tution, to appoint three men of tin*
board of six provided for in Article
111, Section 2 of the Intercollegiate
Agreement. Our executive committee
believes that the interpretation o
Article 11, Section (> of the Intercol
legiate Agreement should be discussed
by the representatives of both univer
sities before this board of arbitration,
inasmuch as the two faculty athletic
committees have met and have failed
to agree upon the question of the
meaning of Article 11, Section (!. The
members of our faculty athletic com
niitee, Professor Edmond O'Niell, Pro
fessor T. M. Putnam and Professor
R. T. Crawford, have signified their
willingness and wish that the question

be arbitrated before such a board.
I am ready to appoint the three
members of the arbitration board
which will represent the University
of California. May I hear from you
in regard to the three men vvno will
be appointed by Stanford University
for this board? We can then arrange
a time and place of meeting at the
earliest possible moment.
Very sincerely yours,
(Signed) ALEXIS F. LANGE.

Dear Sir:
In reply to your query regarding
the board of arbitration which Acting
President Lange writes of in his com
munication to you dated October 29,
1 beg to say that I do not consider
the formation of such a board lies
within the jurisdiction of this faculty.
I have received no communication
from the Executive Committee of the
Associated Students of Stanford Uni
versity in this connection, but it is
safe to presume that the Committee
holds the same opinion.
Sincerely yours,
(Signed) FRANK ANGELL.

Executive Committee of the Univer
sity of California,
Gentlemen:
Your letter from Acting Presi
dent Lange referring to the appoint
ment of an Arbitration Board to con
sider eligibility of candidates has bean
referred to us by Dr. Angell, Chair
man of our Athletic Committee. At
a special meeting of the Executive
Committee, we considered the propo
sition as submitted by President
Lange.
We find, that according to Article
Section I of the Intercollegiate
Agreement, the question of eligibility
of men, with the exception of a <|iies
iton of amateur standing is left en
tirely in the hands of the respective
Faculty Athletic Committees of each
University. Our Faculty Committee
has ruled on the case at band and we
therefore consider their action as
final and the incident closed.

Executive Committtee of L. S. J. U.
Not satisfied with the outcome of
the recent controversy over the eligi
bility of players in the coming Inter
collegiate rugby match, the Associated
Students of California have attempted
to reopen the dispute by asking for
the appointment of an arbitration
board to review the decision of the
Faculty Athletic Committees.
In order to secure the appointment
of this arbitration board the Califor
nia Committee secured the interven
tion of the acting president of the
university who wrote to President
Jordan asking that he appoint the
Stanford members of such a board.
Dr. Jordan was of the opinion that
the whole matter was outside of the
jurisdiction of the faculty, as the
agreement was between the two stu

president in this view and the coininu
