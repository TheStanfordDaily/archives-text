# RELIANCE OUTCLASSED
## VARSITY MAKES RECORD SCORE DEFEATING VISITORS. Oakland Players Unable to Hold Cardinals, Who Mark up 13 Tries. Final Score, 59-0. 
### 
liy the largest score ever totaled on
Stanford Field, the varsity fifteen seal
the Reliance Club team to complete
defeat, 59-0, lust Saturday afternoon.
The Olympic Club had been scheduled
to meet the cardinals, but had been
compelled to cancel the game late
Friday night, owing to the inability
of the captain to secure a full line-up.
The Reliance team, with the original
purpose of meeting ihe second car
dinal fiftten, consented to meet the
varsity instead. The visiting or
ganization was decidedly out of its
class, and, although the Stanford
players performed listlessly, was
scored upon with ease and rapidity.
When the rush of tallies at half time
had been counted, seven tries had been
marked up, with five conversions, a
total of 31 points. Crawford and S.
Mitchell alternated in goal-kicking
with equal success. Twenty-eight
points in the second half made up the
totnl of 59, and of the six tries not
one was registered by the backs, the
forwards alone taking part in prac
tically all of the dribbling rush and
in all of the scoring. The backs, while
gaining much ground in the direction
of the Reliance goal line by passing
rushes, were always forced at the
critical time to release scoring honors
to the scrum men.
One of the most, sensational of the
long succession of tries was made to
wards the end of the first half. From
a scrum on Stanford's 15 yard-line,
Reed gained possession and cross
kicked. Holman caught the ball with
ease and speeded down the field
through a scattered opposition for
fifty yards. M. Mitchell supported
him nicely, and, catching his pass in
the fullback's territory, ran tlie re
maining distance for a try. A passing
rush more generally engaged in bv
the cardinal backs occurred earlier
in (lie game. In this Holman scored
from successive passes from M. Mit
chell, S. Mitchell, and T. Sanborn.
One of the best of the tallies made by
the forwards was the fourth scored
in tlie second half. From midfield the
ball was dribbled by Crawford,
Thorpe and Dole nearly to the Re
liance line. Here Dole was able to
secure and plunge over the line for
the tenth try of the contest.
The two teams lined up as follows:
Varsity — Clieda, Fitting, Morton,
Minium. Dole, Crawford, Pemberton,
Thorpe, forwards; Reed, half; M. Mit
chell, S. Mitchell, fives; T. Sanborn,
center; Cook, Holman, Kern, wings;
Fletcher, full.
Reliance Club —Fryeborg, Dalton,
Farmer, Fairbanks, Watkins, Smith,
McClure, Holm, McElrath, forwards;
Pomeroy, Harris, halves; Lombard,
Fritsch, Van Manderschied, McElrath,
Smith, three-quarters; Holm, Mc-
Elrath. full.
At the conclusion of the Reliance
game the varsity lined up with the
second team, after having nlayed
seventy minutes in the previous con
test. A short half of twelve minutes
was played, with neither fifteen able
to score.
