It is to be hoped that the action
of the Executive Committee in up
holding the decision of the Faculty
Athletic Committee in regard to the
eligibility of players for the varsitj
game, and refusing to consider the at
tempt to carry the matter before the
faculties of the two universities, will
finally put an end to the controversy.
There can be no legitimate reason
for reopening this dispute. The agree
ment makes the decision of the re
spective Faculty Athletic Commit lees
absolute as regards eligibility of their
own players, except in the case of a
charge of professionalism. This
agreement is between the Student
Bodies of the two universities and
does not in any way—except in cer
tifying the elibigle list by the Athletic
Committee —come within th< j juris
diction of the faculty. Any attempt
lu draw the faculty into the dispute
should be discountenanced by the
members of both Student Bodies.
