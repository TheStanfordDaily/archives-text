# TO PLAY VANCOUVER
## VARSITY TO PLAY TEAM FROM BRITISH COLUMBIA. Brown Positive and Roth Possible Absentee from Cardinal Line-up on Wednesday Afternoon. 
### 
Following two decisive defeats, 24
to 3 and 39 to 0, at the hands of the
Blue and Gold varsity, the crippled
Vancouver fifteen is ready for its first
game with the Stanford team, which
will be played on Stanford Field to
morrow afternoon, beginning at 3:30.
The second contest of the series will
be decided on Saturday. Last year
the Northerners won from the Varsity
11 to 3 on the occasion of their first
meeting, while on the Saturday follow
ing the Cardinal turned the tables,
being returned the victor by exactly
the same score. This fall, however,
Vancouver was unable to send south
better than an average team, as,many
of the best Rugby players of British
Columbia found it impossible for them
to be away from home the necessary
length of time. Added to this, the team
suffered severely in both games with
the lilue and Gold. Consequently, the
Vancouver men anticipate merely a
defensive game to-morrow; yet they
are determined to keep the score as
small as it is possible so to do.
If Roth is able to appear at center
three-quarter, the Stanford varsity will
present almost its full strength against
the Northerners on Wednesday. Roth
has not entirely recovered from the
injury incurred in the Castaway game
in Los Angeles and he will not know
before to-morrow morning whether or
not he will play in the afternoon.
Full-back Brown is the only member
of the fifteen who is sure to he an
absentee. Brown has been confined
in the hospital during the last few
days because of a kick which he re
ceived more than a week ago. Al
though he will not play Wednesday,
it is very probable that he will be in
the varsity line-up on Saturday.
With these exceptions the team is
intact. Minturn's sprained ankle has
ceased to trouble him in the slightest
degree, and his presence in the scrum
makes the forward combination pract
ically perfect. Captain Mitchell's
shoulder is once again entirely healed,
and wing three-quarter Cook is back
in the game.
Referee L. S. Redding, who acted
in that capacity at several games early
in the season, will officiate to-morrow.
The line-ups follow:
Varsity—Horton, Cheda, Fitting,
Crawford, Minturn, Pemberton, Dole,
Thorpe, forwards; Reed, half; M.
Mitchell, S. Mitchell, fives; Roth or
Towne, center; Holman, Cook, wings;
Fletcher, full.
Vancouver —Deykin, Smith, Mc-
Lelland. Sachs, Jewett, Schearer,
Gale, McDonald, forwards; Bryne,
Blackmore, halves; Baker, McMillan,
Ellis, McKay, three-quarters; Pickles,
full.
