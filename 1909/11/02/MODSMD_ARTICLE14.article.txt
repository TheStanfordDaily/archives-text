The success and effectiveness of the
rooting at the varsity game a week
from Saturday will depend largely
upon the rooting section becoming
thoroughly familiar with the songs
and yells which are to be used. If the
men 011 the bleachers are only par
tially acquainted with the words or
music, the rooting will be ragged and
will fail to maintain the high stand
ard of previous years.
The Yell-Leaders are working hard
to make tbe rooting this year more
efficient than ever and deserve the
support of the Student Body. With
the varsity contest less than two
weeks distant, it behooves the Sum
ford rooters to devote all available
time to the perfection of their singing
aud yelling. Every man who expects
to sit with the Cardinal rooters at tlie
Intercollegiate contest should attend
the pracices on he bleachers during
this week and next.
