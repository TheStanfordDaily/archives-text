## Stanford Men in Los Angeles Plan for Annual Banquet on Night of Big Game. 
### 
The Stanford Club in Los Angeles
are trying hard to make their annual
banquet a greater success this year
than ever before. As in past years
it will take place on the night of the
Intercollegiate and many will
learn the score for the first time as
they sit about the festal board. The
committee which has charge of these
annual affairs provides a program for
the evening, and the gathering does
not break up until a late hour. This
year they are planning to throw the
pictures of men who have been promi
nent. in University activities in the
past on a screen.
As the alumni association in Los
Angeles is composed of men who have
been members of every class that has
graduated from the University, the pic
tures that will be displayed will not
be limited to any one period of the
history of Stanford, but will be dis
tributed over the different years so as
to cover the whole time that Stan
ford has been in existence.
Last week one of the members of
the southern club visited the campus
and tried to find pictures of some of
the old timers. The southerners by
means of the reflectoscope will be able
to throw pictures on the curtain from
the simple pictures without resorting
to the expenses of making lantern
slides for the occasion.
If any one has pictures of any of
the men who have been prominent
figures in some of the earlier days or
the University, if they will lend them
for this event ihev will be returned
immediately after the bis game. Those
who can furnish pictures should not
ify this office.
