# GRANT LEAVES OF ABSENCE.
## Professor Fairclough to Take Honored Position in Rome.-Durand to Visit Europe. 
### 
The only matter of interest to the
Student Body taken up by the Board
of Trustees yesterday in San Fran
cisco was the granting of leaves of
absence to Professor H. It. Fairclough,
head of the Latin department and Pro
fessor W. F. Durand, head of the
Mechanical Engineering department.
Professor Fairclough takes his de
parture in May to be gone a year,
while Professor Durand will leave in
March and return in September. Pro
fessor Fairclough leaves to take up
the honored position of Professor of
Latin in the American School of Clas
sical Studies in Rome. A professor
ship is annually appointed to this
school from the United States, and
Professor Fairclough's appointment is
the first to fall to any man living west
of Chicago. Mr. Fairclough's work at
Rome does not commence until next
fall, and as a result he will spend
the summer at the University of Ber
lin in Germany. Before returning to
the United States, he will travel in
Egypt and Greece.
Professor Durand will spend most
of his time traveling in Europe.
