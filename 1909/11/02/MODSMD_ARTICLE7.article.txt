# MATHIEU PICKS CAST
## COACH FILLS PARTS OF "THE ROAD TO YESTERDAY" R.H. Seward, W.B. Cohen, and the Misses Ozier, Howell, Wright and Wilson Have Roles. 
### 
The complete cast for"The Road
to Yesterday," which will be produced
by the Masquers on November 19, has
been selected by Coach Mathieu and
comprises the pick of the talent now
at Stanford. In the choice of "The
Road to Yesterday," The Masquers
were peculiarly fortunate in that tlie
women's roles have by far the chief
prominence, and, furthermore, the
members of the society were particu
larly adapted to fill the parts of the
piece.
The lead, Elspeth Tyrrell, has been
given to Miss M. L. Ozier, '10, of Los
Angeles, whose fascinating Gayety
Vance, naive Dolly Coke and vivacious
Maria are among the most pleasant
memories of recent performances in
Assembly Hall. Elspeth is exactly
suited to Miss Ozier's personality and
ability.
As a Malena Leveson of to-day and
a Gypsy of three hundred years ago
Miss M. T. Howell, '10, also of Los
Angeles, will at last have a splendid
opportunity to display her manifold
talents.
Miss A. Wright, '10, another Los
Angelean, will play Eleanor Leveson.
As portrayed by Miss Wright, Eleanor
can not fail to compare favorably with
her Jane Nangle, Stella de (!ex and
Lady Jessica.
Harriet Phelps is just such a role
as Miss M. E. Wilson, '11, will de
light to play. Miss Wilson also reg
isters from Los Angeles, as does Miss
G. D. Workman, '13, who has been
entrusted with the part of Norah Gil
law. Miss Workman conies to Stan
ford with a truly wonderful reputa
tion in dramatics. Miss H. E. Ely, '11,
of Phoenix, will make her debut as
Dolly Foulis.
W. B. Cohen, '12, of Cleveland, is
happily fitted in the role of Kenelm
Paulton, the formerly villainous Lord
Strangavon. R. H. Seward, '12, of
Los Angeles, will have a chance to dis
play his versatility in the juvenile part
of Jack Greatorex. E. Kobbi, '11, and
11. A. Lewis, '12, both of Los Angeles
also have important roles. The com
