# FRESHMEN PLAN FOR BONFIRE.
## Arrangements Discussed and Committee to Collect Class Dues Appointed. 
### 
At the Freshman Class meeting
held this afternoon, the personnel of
the committee which is to collect
the regular class dues was announced
by President Hill. This committee
consists of M. E. Hoffman, F. S. Pratt,
C. if. Heal, J. P. Graff, Miss M. Beach,
Miss J, I. Lakin and Miss E. M. Mc-
Kibben.
The bonfire committee made its re
port and an additional collector's com
mittee of 25 was appointed to raise
the money necessary for the fire and
the stunts for the big game.
The plans for the bonfire were also
discussed. A tower forty feet high
with a square base of fifteen feet is
to lie constructed of rough lumber.
Enough material is already in sight
to cover this and the work of collect
ing is to begin Tuesday, November 9.
Different squads will be detailed to
watch the bonfire during Tuesday and
Wednesday nights.
