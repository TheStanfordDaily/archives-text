# MAY SPEAK ON CHINA
## HON. AMOS P. WILDER TO TALK AT ASSEMBLY. Hon. H. Merou, French Consul General, Will Also Address Students. Third Hour Chosen. 
### 
Despite the fact that no subjects
have been announced, indications are
that, the Assembly to-morrow at 10:10
o'clock with Hon. H. Merou, the
French Consul General, and Hon.
Amos P. Wilder, the United States
Consul at Shanghai, as speakers will
be one of the most interesting of the
semester.
Both men are in close touch with
the momentous questions of the hour
and it is not likely that they will
miss this opportunity of dwelling upon
some of these subjects which are ex
ceedingly interesting to the college
men and women.
Hon. Amos P. Wilder, being the Uni
ted States government official at
Shanghai, has an infinite knowledge
of the great reformation now at work
in China and of the interests now
prevalent there under the direction
of American people and capital. Mr.
Wilder is probably also well informed
of the recent "Crane episode" which
at the present moment is the topic of
great comment at Washington.
Hon. H. Merou, is also a well-known
government official and a man ac
quainted with the present relation
ship of the United States and France.
These relatio.ns are growing stronger
each year and questions regarding
their development are subjects to-day
of great importance.
