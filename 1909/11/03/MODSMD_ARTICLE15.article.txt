There is a possibility that that J. R.
Capabanca, who is easily the greatest
chess player in the United States, may
play a simultaneous match against
the best chess players now in the
University.
Capabanca, who is a Cuban player,
has made a tour of the East where he
successfully played simultaneous
matches with the greatest chess play
ers in that part of the country. He
expects to make a tour of the West
this fall, and if enough interest is
shown, he may arrange for a match at
Stanford. Ii is hoperl by those now
interested in chess that enough en
thusiasm, both among students and
faculty members interested in chess
may be aroused to insure a match
with this master chess player.
The local chess matches for tbe
last week have resulted in R. W.
Poindexter, '10, and E. R. Weaver,
'10. both beating D. A. Butler, M3; and
H. S. Tracy, '11, defeating both L. .T.
Smallpage, '09, and C. T. Dunham, '13.
In score this leaves Tracy and Vaugn
even, and with the highest totals.
