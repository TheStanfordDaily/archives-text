# START PRIZE CONTEST
## QUAD STAFF OFFERS REWARDS FOR BEST MATERIAL. Valuable Remunerations to Be Paid for Story and Designs for Class Pictures. 
### 
The management of the 1911 Quad
has been authorized to inaugurate a
story and art contest in order to
bring out the best possible material
for the Junior Annual. A prize of
$10 is offered as a reward in the
story contest and Davey of Palo Alto
has agreed to give as a prize to the
winner of the art composition twelve
of his best $10.00 a dozen photographs.
The story prize is for fiction and is
offered in the hope that the best writ
ers among the students will be stimu
lated to make the literary department
a feature of the Quad. Short, breezy
stories on any subject of not more
than 3500 words are desired, and
must be in the hands of the judges,
consisting of members of the faculty
and the editor-in-chief, by February
15, 1910. Contestants must write on
but one side of ordinary theme paper.
As the Quad is the record of the
College Year, all stories of merit
which have appeared this year in any
of the University publications, or will
appear before the last of the contest,
will be considered by the judges.
The art prize is for a design to sur
round the class pictures. The staff
wishes an artistic background to the
photographs instead of the usual plain
unadorned framework. Simple, unos
tentatious, elegant designs, 26 inches
long by 16 inches wide, are desired.
All work must be drawn in black and
white on six-ply board and must be
left with Prof. R. B. Harshe of the
Art department before February 1,
1910. Twelve oval spaces 5V 2 inches
high by 4 inches wide must be left in
each design for the photos. These
may be arranged in any order desired
by the contestant, and must be drawn
in the design, but not cut out. Prof.
A. B. Clark has granted permission
to all art students to work on their
designs in the Art department.
Contestants in both competitions
must mark their work with some
sign by which it can be identified,
but must not sign it. Sealed envelopes
containing the contributor's signa
ture and a duplicate mark must ac
company the work. Stories must be
mailed to box 1174 Campus. Further
information if needed may be obtained
from the editor-in-chief, L. L. Hill.
