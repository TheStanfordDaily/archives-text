J. S. Dixon, Zoology '10, recently
discovered two new species of Har
vest mice in fhe salt marshes near
San Francisco Bay. He has named
tlieni Reithrodontomys raviventris and
Reithrodontomys halicoetes. Both
are unusually pretty little mice with
a rusty red pelage of very smooth,
glossy hairs. Full descriptions 'of
the species have appeared in scientific
bulletins. According to Dixon, the
first of these is found in the Salicornia
swamps near Palo Alto. It never
ventures out of the marsh, not even
at high tides, when apparently the
whole population is compelled to
climb up on old dikes and other high
places to keep from being drowned.
