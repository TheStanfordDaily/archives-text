# CARDINAL VARSITY FIFTEEN OVERWHELMS VANCOUVER
## Stanford Players Pile Up 56 Points in First Game with Northerners.--British Columbians Fail to Score. 
### 
During seventy minutes of play the
Cardinal Varsity forced the ball over
the line for fourteen tries in the first
Stanford-Vancouver game decided libs
afternoon. Of these Crawford con
verted seven, making the final score
read f>6 against the Northerner's 0.
The offensive combination of tlie Var
sity, and especially of the backlield,
was not to be resisted by t lie British
Columbians, who sought throughout
merely to fight a defensive battle. The
score plainly tells the story of their
ill success. Only once, and then by
a clever kick, was the Cardinal goal
in any danger whatsoever, and that
was but momentary.
Vancouver's concentrated defence
was quite strong during the first ten
minutes of each half, but thereafter
proved completely ineffective. The
last portion of the second period was
only a Cardinal procession down the
field and over the Northerner's goal.
Five tries were tallied in less than
j fifteen minutes.
A kick in the side incurred during
practice on Tuesday kept S. Mitchell
011 the side-lines, T. Sanborn replac
ing him at second five. Sanborn had
had no practice with the Varsity at
this position, where he was clearly
estranged during a large part of the
first half. During the second period,
however, he regained all his lost con
fidence, rendering the team-play of the
backlield well-nigh perfect. Roth re
appeared in the line-up, and his work
was marked with the usual vim and
dash.
After six minutes of the opening
half had elapsed, Reed received a
severe kick, breaking his ankle. The
injury will prevent him from playing
again this fall. Cass was substituted
at scrum half, where he displayed
real varsity ability. It was practi
cally his first opportunity to work witn
the Cardinal backs, but despite the
fact, his playing was cool and precise.
Despite the obstructive tactics of the
Vancouver defence, Cass got his passes
away quickly and accurately.
Cheda, Crawford and Horton were
at all times prominent in the pack.
Crawford's kicks for touch were bril
liant. The forwards as a whole, how
ever, were not at their best. Although
they succeeded in securing posses
sion with encouraging regularity, they
failed to keep the opposing pack from
interferring with the Cardinal offense
as well as they might have done.
For Vancouver, Deakin was a tower
of strength in the scrum, and H. E.
Erb, '12, was invaluable in the back
division.

The California varsity squad wit
nessed the match from the bleachers.
The two fifteens lined-up as follows:
Varsity — Fitting, Cheda, Horton,
Minturn, Dole, Crawford, Pemberton,
Thorpe, forwards; Reed, Cass, half;
M. Mitchell, T. Sanborn, fives; Roth,
center, Cook, Holman, wings; Flet
cher, full.
Vancouver —Deakin, Shearer, Gale,
.lewett, McClelland, Smith, Sachs, Mc-
Donald, forwards; Blackmore, half;
Hyland, five; McCloud, Erb, McMil
lan, McKay, three-quarters; Pickles,
full.
During seventy minutes of play the
Cardinal Varsity forced the ball over
the line for fourteen tries in the first
Stanford-Vancouver game decided libs
afternoon. Of these Crawford con
verted seven, making the final score
read f>6 against the Northerner's 0.
The offensive combination of tlie Var
sity, and especially of the backlield,
was not to be resisted by t lie British
Columbians, who sought throughout
merely to fight a defensive battle. The
score plainly tells the story of their
ill success. Only once, and then by
a clever kick, was the Cardinal goal
in any danger whatsoever, and that
was but momentary.
Vancouver's concentrated defence
was quite strong during the first ten
minutes of each half, but thereafter
proved completely ineffective. The
last portion of the second period was
only a Cardinal procession down the
field and over the Northerner's goal.
Five tries were tallied in less than
j fifteen minutes.
A kick in the side incurred during
practice on Tuesday kept S. Mitchell
011 the side-lines, T. Sanborn replac
ing him at second five. Sanborn had
had no practice with the Varsity at
this position, where he was clearly
estranged during a large part of the
first half. During the second period,
however, he regained all his lost con
fidence, rendering the team-play of the
backlield well-nigh perfect. Roth re
appeared in the line-up, and his work
was marked with the usual vim and
dash.
After six minutes of the opening
half had elapsed, Reed received a
severe kick, breaking his ankle. The
injury will prevent him from playing
again this fall. Cass was substituted
at scrum half, where he displayed
real varsity ability. It was practi
cally his first opportunity to work witn
the Cardinal backs, but despite the
fact, his playing was cool and precise.
Despite the obstructive tactics of the
Vancouver defence, Cass got his passes
away quickly and accurately.
Cheda, Crawford and Horton were
at all times prominent in the pack.
Crawford's kicks for touch were bril
liant. The forwards as a whole, how
ever, were not at their best. Although
they succeeded in securing posses
sion with encouraging regularity, they
failed to keep the opposing pack from
interferring with the Cardinal offense
as well as they might have done.
For Vancouver, Deakin was a tower
of strength in the scrum, and H. E.
Erb, '12, was invaluable in the back
division.
The play in detail follows:
First 11 n If.
Crawford kicked off to Vancouver,
defending north goal, at .'1:45. Play
remained in Vancouver 25-yard terri
tory for the first five minutes. Erb

The California varsity squad wit
nessed the match from the bleachers.
The two fifteens lined-up as follows:
Varsity — Fitting, Cheda, Horton,
Minturn, Dole, Crawford, Pemberton,
Thorpe, forwards; Reed, Cass, half;
M. Mitchell, T. Sanborn, fives; Roth,
center, Cook, Holman, wings; Flet
cher, full.
Vancouver —Deakin, Shearer, Gale,
.lewett, McClelland, Smith, Sachs, Mc-
Donald, forwards; Blackmore, half;
Hyland, five; McCloud, Erb, McMil
lan, McKay, three-quarters; Pickles,
full.
During seventy minutes of play the
Cardinal Varsity forced the ball over
the line for fourteen tries in the first
Stanford-Vancouver game decided libs
afternoon. Of these Crawford con
verted seven, making the final score
read f>6 against the Northerner's 0.
The offensive combination of tlie Var
sity, and especially of the backlield,
was not to be resisted by t lie British
Columbians, who sought throughout
merely to fight a defensive battle. The
score plainly tells the story of their
ill success. Only once, and then by
a clever kick, was the Cardinal goal
in any danger whatsoever, and that
was but momentary.
Vancouver's concentrated defence
was quite strong during the first ten
minutes of each half, but thereafter
proved completely ineffective. The
last portion of the second period was
only a Cardinal procession down the
field and over the Northerner's goal.
Five tries were tallied in less than
j fifteen minutes.
A kick in the side incurred during
practice on Tuesday kept S. Mitchell
011 the side-lines, T. Sanborn replac
ing him at second five. Sanborn had
had no practice with the Varsity at
this position, where he was clearly
estranged during a large part of the
first half. During the second period,
however, he regained all his lost con
fidence, rendering the team-play of the
backlield well-nigh perfect. Roth re
appeared in the line-up, and his work
was marked with the usual vim and
dash.
After six minutes of the opening
half had elapsed, Reed received a
severe kick, breaking his ankle. The
injury will prevent him from playing
again this fall. Cass was substituted
at scrum half, where he displayed
real varsity ability. It was practi
cally his first opportunity to work witn
the Cardinal backs, but despite the
fact, his playing was cool and precise.
Despite the obstructive tactics of the
Vancouver defence, Cass got his passes
away quickly and accurately.
Cheda, Crawford and Horton were
at all times prominent in the pack.
Crawford's kicks for touch were bril
liant. The forwards as a whole, how
ever, were not at their best. Although
they succeeded in securing posses
sion with encouraging regularity, they
failed to keep the opposing pack from
interferring with the Cardinal offense
as well as they might have done.
For Vancouver, Deakin was a tower
of strength in the scrum, and H. E.
Erb, '12, was invaluable in the back
division.
The play in detail follows:
First 11 n If.
Crawford kicked off to Vancouver,
defending north goal, at .'1:45. Play
remained in Vancouver 25-yard terri
tory for the first five minutes. Erb
