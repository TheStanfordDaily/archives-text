Upon the conduct of the men at the
Plug-Ugly show to-morrow night will
largely rest the future of this Stan
ford tradition. An open air extrava
ganza in which the Juniors hold up
to ridicule the weaknesses of the Sen
iors, while the Seniors good-naturedly
josh and interrupt the actors, is a
custom belonging peculiarly to Stan
ford and far too distinct and unique
an idea to be abolished.
Hut in recent years there has been
a growing tendency which, if con
tinued will result in the abandonment
of the show as a feature of the Plug-
Ugly. For purely financial reasons,
if there were no others, the future
classes will find it Impossible to stage
a show when the spectators find that
the extravaganza is interrupted and
the show broken up before fairly
started. The public is not. going to
pay to see a potato-throwing contest,
especially if the aim is promiscuous.
The idea of joshing the actors and
putting every possible hindrance in
the way of the Juniors is in keeping
with the spirit of the rush, but throw
ing the show into a roughhouse with
out allowing it to approach its ter
mination or preventing the produc
tion of the extravangaza through de
struction of the stage or wire cutting
is going entirely beyond the bounds
of even the most liberal idea of Plug-
Ugly license. In this connection it
might be well for tlie Senior class
to recall the attitude taken by 1910
at the time of the rush and show last
year when a request was sent to 1909
to permit the play to be concluded
without interruption.
There is plenty of opportunity for
a roughhouse during lhe rush, while
Seniors as well as the general public
will enjoy seeing the play through to
the end.
