# H.W. Maloney Falls from Bicycle.

### 
While riding toward the University
last evening, Instructor Maloney of
the Hygienle department, was thrown
from his bicycle. He was not badly
hurt, but he sustained many painful
bruises and scratches that will keep
him from meeting his classes for a
day or two.
