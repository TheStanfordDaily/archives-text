# INJURED MEN ARE GIVEN REST.
## S. Mitchell Is in Hospital with Minor Hurt; Brown Will Play Saturday.â€”No Hope for Reed. 
### 
Coach Presley will take no chances
of losing liis injured players for the
varsity game. He is keeping them
out of contests, though their hurts
are not serious, with the exception
of Reed, halfback. Reed did not, as
was generally thought, break his
ankle in yesterday's game with Van
couver, but suffered a bone-fracture
in his left leg. This injury will oblige
the unfortunate player's permanent
withdrawal from further participation
in football this year, and necessitates
the trying out of another varsity half.
S. Mitchell is in the hospital and out
of matches for this week as the re
sult of a hurt received in Tuesday's
practice. His retention on the in
jured list is more in the nature of a
rest than a serious injury. Brown, at
full, is out of the hospital, and is also
on the resting bench. It is probable
that he will play against Vancouver
next Saturday. Manager McGachen of
the Northern team, has strong hopes
that several of his injured men will
be recovered sufficiently to play in
the second game with Stanford. Cap
tain Byrne may be able to assume his
old uiace in the line-up at half-back.
