# SENIORS EFFECT CAPTURES.
## Several Juniors Connected With Plug-Ugly Are Kidnapped and Taken to Camp in Hills. 
### 
In pursuance of the usual custom
ol' attempting to kidnap members of
the Junior Class who are prominently
connected with the Plug-Ugly, several
Seniors last night succeeded in cap
turing and making away with It. B.
Wheeler, the chairman, and one or
two other Juniors who are cast for
parts in "Steering the Bull." The ex
act number of the prisoners is un
known. The captures were made as
the opportunities offered, that of
Chairman Wheeler being the boldest.
Wheeler niei his doom about 8:30
o'clock, as he was passing the post
office on his way to attend a meeting
of the executive commitee in Encina
Hall, to which he had been decoyed
by a fake telephone message. He was
hand-cuffed, shackled and hurried in
to a waiting surrey before his loud
cries brought hint any assistance. The
Seniors and their prisoners are en
camped in a lonely and mysterious
spot in the hills to the southwest of
the University. They are expected to
return early to-morrow evening.
