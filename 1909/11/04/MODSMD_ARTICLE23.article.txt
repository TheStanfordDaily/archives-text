# TO HOLD TRACK MEET
## CAPTAIN SCOTT URGES MEN TO ENTER CONTEST. Interclass Meet Set for November 20. Entry List. Closes on Fourteenth. 
### 
An Interclass track meet will be
held on Saturday, November 20, In
which every one who intends to take
part in track work during the spring
is urged to enter. Fall training has
been actively followed by a great
many men whom the meet will give
a chance to compete. Captain L.
Scott, '10, states that in order to
start the spring season off with a
rush, it is necessary that every man
should enter the meet, as the exper
ience will prove invaluable. Scott,
desires that not only the new men, but
also all of the old men, enter the meet.
Men intending to enter should start
conditioning immediately, as no one
not in shape will be allowed to com
pete. The entry list will be posted
in the training house on Monday, No
vember 14, which the men must sign
on that day, as entries will be received
no later than that time.
The track will be repaired and a
new coat of cinders put on by the
time of the meet so good performances
should be seen. All the distance
events will probably be shortened as
they would put too much of a strain
on the men not in the best condition.
A large number of new men have
been working out. many of tliem show
ing by their trials that they will make
names for themselves, and when they
come under the direct supervision of
"Dad Moulton" their improvement
should be noticeable.
