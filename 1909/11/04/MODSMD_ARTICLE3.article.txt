# TO ENTER TOURNAMENT
## TENNIS MEN TO PLAY IN BAY COUNTIES EVENTS. Executive Committee Grunts Expenses of Men Entered.â€”Routine Business Transacted. 
### 
To enable the most promising Ten
nis men of the University to enter the
coming Bay Counties tournament, in
which all of the best players in that
vicinity will compete, the Executive
Committee last evening voted ten dol
lars to cover the expenses of the
players. Those who will enter from
the University are H. S. Morgan, '12,
H. Mann, '10, E. Jordan, gr., and C. S.
Grace, '12. The men will compete
as individuals, not representing the
University in any way.
Tennis is rapidly attaining to such
proportions as a collegiate sport that
Ihe committee considered that this
move, giving the men outside compe
tition would result in a great advance
ment in the play.
The exclusive right to sell pen
nants at the Varsity game was granted
to Curry, with the understanding that
he would not operate within the
grounds or on the bleachers, the com
mittee agreeing to prevent him from
suffering any competition in the im
mediate vicinity of the field.
G. F. Morgan, '10, appeared before
the committee and outlined his plans
for the entertainment to lie given to
the Vancouver players on November
6, and requested every one to help to
make it a success. The request of
T. K. Stark, '11, leader of the Stan
ford band, that new coats and caps
lie procured for the musicians, was
granted.
A statement was received from A.
E. Bhrhorn, 10, concerning the work
done by the Stunt Committee, and a
final report handed in by "the Foot
ball Show Committee.
