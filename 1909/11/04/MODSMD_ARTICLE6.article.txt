# HON. H. MEROU SPEAKS
## DELIVERS INTERESTING TALK ON FRENCH RELATIONS. Hon. Amos P. Wilder Fails to Appear. Speaker Delcares Nations Are Similar. 
### 
Hon. H. Merou, French Consul Gen
eral located at San Francisco, was the
only speaker at the Assembly this
morning. Hon. Mr. Wilder, our Con
sul at Shanghai unfortunately missed
the train that would have brought
him to the campus in time to deliver
his address. Keen disappointment
was exemplified when President Jor
dan announced that the distinguished
United States official would not he
present.
President Jordan in a formal man
ner introduced Mr. Merou to the audi
ence who greeted the official in a
cordial way. Mr. Merou at once be
uan liis address referring at first to
his sincere appreciation of the honor
extended him when invited to deliver
ai) address before the students of the
University.
Continuing, Mr. Merou declared that
after observing and investigating a
bit, the conclusion reached would be
that the population of the United
States and France was similar, and
beyond that, the natural products,
climate, and even blood relations of
the United States and France were
janalagous to a great extent, in com
jmenting on this he concluded by say
ing "all what France has you have,
all what you have France has, and
'if it is true, that England deserves
Jto be called your Mother Country,
; then it is not less true that France
I who has already been conceded to be
i
j the God Mother from the time of our
common baptism of blood in the war
of your freedom, France is also, and
not less your Grandmother Country."
Mr. Merou in detail explained this at
titude taken and how it was verified
by historical records from the time of
William the Conqueror, in conclu
sion, Mr. Merou said in part as fol
lows:
"In the commercial relations with
the United States, men versed in sta
tistics know that there could not be a
more healthy balance of those rela
tions, because one side buys exactly
for about the same number of millions
of dollars, as it sells to the other.
So that we may well be entitled to
hope that if in times, there happens
to exist difficulties of tariff, those dif
ficulties will he equitably put aside
by satisfactory arrangements. Our
countries are lands of freedom recog
nizing the right to equal, mutual treat
ment. They are, they must be, they
will always be acting deliberately,
mutually, indue justice to this right
j with a noble and sympathetic feeling
of brotherhood or fraternity."
