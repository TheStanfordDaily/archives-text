# ARE BETTER MATCHED
## VARSITY WILL BE WEAKENED IN SECOND VANCOUVER GAME. Three Cardinal Players off Line-up. Northerners Will Be Aided by Sharpe. 
### 
To-morrow's second game with the
Vancouver fifteen will find the var
sity ranks more depleted than be
fore, Crawford, S. Mitchell and
Brown being off the line-up. This
does not mean however, that these
men have serious injuries in any way,
but simply that Coach Presley intends
to give each man every chance to re
cover his full strength before the in
tercollegiate contest. Crawford is
on the side-lines from Wednesday's
match and will reduce the fighting
power of the scrum to a great extent.
He is in the Guild hospital for a
needed rest. Thorpe may be out of
the play with several dislocated find
ers. In case Thorpe can not play, the
places of these two veterans will be
taken by strong second-team men,
Hubbard, Woodcock or Doron. The
condition of S. Mitchell has not chang
ed; and, contrary to expectations,
Brown will not appear at full, it not
being deemed safe to send him into
the game.
The Vancouver team, on the con
trary, will be much strengthened by
the addition of Sharpe, of the Bar
barian Club, who will play wing.
Sharpe, before joining the ranks of
the San Francisco club, was a clever
player on a Canadian organization,
and to-morrow gives him an oppor
tunity to play with his fellow play
ers. He will be remembered here
by his long runs in contests with the
varsity, when he played in the same
position he will occupy to-morrow.
The Vancouver forwards will be prac
tically the same as on Wednesday,
with one exception. Pickles, formerly
at full back, is to take his place in
the scrum. Erb will be seen again
at full-back, where he did such ef
ficient work in the first game. Black
more will again be a worthy substi
tute for Byrne at. half back, and will
be expected to put a good deal of
life into the northern team.
Cass, who played such a strong
game at half-back after Reed had
been injured, will take the same
place behind the scrum to-morrow.
S. Mitchell's place will be filled*again
by T. Sanborn.
The game will be called at 3:30
and 50 cents will be charged for ad
mission. A referee has not been def
initely chosen, but it is probable that
either Cameron or Redding will act.
The line-ups:
Varsity — Cheda, Fitting, Morton,
Minturn, Dole, Hubbard, Pemberton,
Thorpe, forwards; Cass, hallf; M. Mit
chell, T. Sanborn, fives; Roth, center;

Vancouver —Deykin, Shearer, Gale,
Jewett, McClelland, Smith, Sachs, Mo-
Donald, Pickles, forwards; Blackmore,
half; Ellis, five; McMillan. McCloud,
Baker, Sharpe, three-quarters; Erb,
full.
