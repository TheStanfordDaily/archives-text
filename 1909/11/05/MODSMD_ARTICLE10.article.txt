# MEET TEAM AT JINKS
## ENTERTAINMENT FOR RUGBY PLAYERS FROM NORTH. Opportunity for Faculty and Students to Meet Visitors from Vancouver. 
### 
All arrangements have been com
pleted for the entertainment ol' the
Vancouver team in Encina Clubroom
to-morrow evening by the Y. M. C. A.
Committee on Entertainment. A gen
erous program has been provided
which will be interesting and enter
ttaining to all.
The entertainment, whille primarily
intended for the benefit of the Van
couver visitors, is also intended to be
an opportunity for the faculty and
all the men in the Student Body to
make the acquaintance of the visiting
team.
The hour of seven-thirty has been
announced us the time for the enter
tainment. This is tlie first general
reception and jolly-up since the one
which was given the Freshmen early
in the semester, and it. is hoped that
as many as can attend will be present.
Contrary to the usual custom of
such gatherings the Yell-Leaders re
quest that time be given to getting
acquainted with everyone rather than
that those who attend should imme
diately expect the program to com
mence. The affair will be strictly
informal as other like events in the
past, and those who are present will
sit on the floor during the giving of
the program.
Twenty assistants have been secured
to help serve refreshments at the
conclusion of the interesting program
which has been provided. This will
insure the fact that all will be served
with quickness and dispatch and will
prevent the reoccurrence of the con
fusion which has sometimes been
brought about by the large numbers
to be served.
The program for the evening has
been divided into two parts. Part
one is given over to musical numbers
and a monologue and chalk talk while
the second part will include wrestling,
fencing, boxing, exhibiiton bag-punch
ing, and several other numbers by the
Gym. Club.
In conclusion there will be a song
and yell practice which the yell
leaders hope will be largely attended,
as but few more opportunities remain
for practice before the Varsity game.
The committee which has charge of
the evening's entertainment is com
posed of G. F. Morgan, '10, chairman,
E. R. Purdum, '10, G. W. Wood, '10.
S. H. Smith, '11, H. M. Tennant, '11,
and E. E. Tincher, '12. The commit
tee has again demonstrated its
ability to provide an entertaining pro
gram and should be strongly com
mended for its efficient service.
