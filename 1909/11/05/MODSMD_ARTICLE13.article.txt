The Daily Palo Alto recently re
ceived a letter from a Stanford grad
uate now attending an Kastern uni
versity, containing a comment on the
matter of college songs which is of
particular interest at the present time
when the rooting section is learning
songs for use at the varsity game.
The writer said in part:
"1 noticed in a recent copy of the
paper that the usual prize for a new
song was offered. Now I am not the
one to oppose a custom so long es
tablished. I>ut I have noticed that a
fellow need only be out of Stanford
a year <>r two when he is unable to
join in any Stanford song at a gather
ing of students and alumni. For ex
ample take the meet in Chicago.
None of the old alumni knew the new
yells or songs that were proposed and
none of the younger fellows knew the
old songs. Here in the east, classes
as far back as the fifties are able to
join in when' a song or cheer is given.
The institutions have new songs each
year but they also keep a few of the
older ones and each college genera
tion knows the latter."
This touches upon a point which de
serves more consideration by the Veil-
Leaders here. There is too little con
tinuity in the matter of college songs
and yells, the new songs of each year
practically superseding all others so
that each college generation knows
an entirely different number of songs.
There should be an active movement
to cultivate a tradition which will
perpetuate a number of the best of
Stanford's songs and yells.
