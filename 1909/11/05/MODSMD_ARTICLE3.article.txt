# TICKETS GO ON SALE
## ADMISSION TO FOOTBALL SHOW AT USUAL PRICES. Program Full of Sensational Features, Sale to Begin at 8 o'clock Monday Morning. 
### 
Tickets for the big Football Show
will go on sale at the Bookstore on
Monday morning at 8 o'clock. The
usual prices of fifty, seventy-five cents
and one dollar will prevail.
The show will be replete with novel
features, and the management by en
ergetic work, has collected the best
program of vaudeville ever presented
to a Stanford audience. G. F. Mor
gan, '10, who is staging the produc
tion. will probably appear in a sketch
entitled "It's All in the Draw," writ
ten by Frank Mathieu. the well-known
coach. The combination of Morgan
and 11. A. Lewis, '12, in an Irish
comedy skit should prove an irresist
able fun-maker, while as a burnt cork
artist P. Ward, '12, should not leave
the house in any gloom.
The Billiken rage now affecting the
whole country lias reached Stanford
at last and its first appearance here
will be on the stage Saturday night J
in an acrobatic stunt entitled "The '
Tramp and the Billiken," comical as
is everything in which Billiken enters.
The evening's entertainment will be !
spiced with the continued variety of I
the program, each one of the twelve i
big acts presented being entirely dif- !
ferent from the others. Go and see. !
