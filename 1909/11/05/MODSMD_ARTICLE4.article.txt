# Take Vancouver Players on Trip.
## 
### 
The members of the Vancouver
Rugby team were to-day the guests of
the Student Body on a sight-seeing
tour through the Santa Clara Valley.
Leaving here in automibiles this
morning, the party went directly to
San Jose, where they took a plunge
in the Vendome baths and enjoyed
lunch at the La Molle grill.
From San Jose the party went to
Alum Rock, Los Gatos, and all the
principal points of interest in the
vicinity, returning to the Campus in
time to see the Plug-Ugly performance
and the rush in which they were
greatly interested. The visitors will
remain on the campus until Sunday
when they will leave for the north.
