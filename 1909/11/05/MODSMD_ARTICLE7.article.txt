# NAME DEBATING TEAM
## TEAM CHOSEN TO REPRESENT CLASS IN ANNUAL DEBATE. M.E. Grimes, N.C. Wilson and H.R. Person Selected to Meet Freshmen. 
### 
The Sophomore tryouts for the
annual Freshman-Sophomore debate
were characterized by the unusual
excellence of the speeches as a whole.
Almost without exception the speakers
showed a great amount of hard work
on preparation, and the speeches were
well delivered and interesting. After
a long deliberation, which showed the
difficulty of their decision, the judges
selected M. E. Grimes, N. C. Wilson
and 11. R. Person to represent their
class, wilb E. E. Tincher as alter
nate.
The speakers were divided into two
squads for convenience, the first, arg
uing on a progressive federal inherit
ance tax and the second on a progres
sive income tax.
The speech of M. E. Grimes, arguing
against the income tax was character
ized by convincing argument and ex
cellent delivery. He had an excellent
stage presence and was clear and
forceful.
N. C. Wilson, arguing against the
income tax, won his place principally
by his quick thinking and presence
of mind in difficult circumstances. He
had a large and ready vocabulary and
seemed perfectly at home on the floor.
The speech of H. R. Person, also
arguing against the incame tax, was
notable principally for logical direct
ness and force. He relied more than
any of the others on straight, clear
reasoning.
E. E. Tincher, speaking for the in
heritance tax presented good argu
ments in a forceful and convincing
manner.
G. F. Morgan, '10, of the Interso
ciety Debating League, presided. The
judges were Professors A. M. Cath
eart and C. A. Huston of the Law de
partment, and S. S. Seward, Jr., of
the English department.
