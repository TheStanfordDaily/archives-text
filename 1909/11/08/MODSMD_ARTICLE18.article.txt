Four Stanford tenuis players, in
cluding E. Jordan, gr., H. Mann, '10,
H. S. Morgan, '12, and C. S. Grace, '12,
competed i i the Bay Counties Doubles
Championship Tennis Tournament,
which is being held in San Francisco,
and made an excellent showing. The
teams were composed of Jordan and
Mann, and Morgan and Grace, and
both reached the semi-finals of the
tournament. Although Grace and
Morgan were defeated at this stage
of the games, at the hands of Hunt
and Foley, two veteran players, Jor
dan and Mann have only to win their
semi-final match to take at least a
second place in the tournament, and
have even a fair chance to pull off the
event.
Jordan and Mann won two good
matches, the second a most exciting
three-set contest with Curley and
Tuchs, two very promising Juniors
who annexed the second set at 7-.">.
Here Mann putin some very steady
work, Jordan some very effective
scoring and marking which ended in
a final set to our men at 0-2. Morgan
and Grace had a close match with
F. Adams and Code and won out the
third set from 4-2 against them by
steady work. Adams is a high-class
player, Coast champion five years ago.
Morgan and Grace put up a good light
too against Foley and Hunt, and
though losing 6-3, 6-1, the match was
closer than the scores indicate.
