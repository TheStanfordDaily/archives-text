# VANCOUVER JINKS A SUCCESS.
## Excellent Program Pleases Large Crowd at Informal Entertainment for Northerners. 
### 
The jinks given Saturday evening
in the Encina Clubrooni in honor of
the Vancouver team, was in every way
a success. The attendance was very
large and the program, arranged by
the Y. M. C. A. Committee, one of the
best that has ever been given at an
informal entertainment.
The Mandolin Club rendered a cou
ple of excellent numbers. Songs by
W. P. Fuller, '10, and S. K. Dixon, '12,
made tremendous hits as did the selec
tions of the quartet. E. M. Albright
gave a clever chalk-talk that was one
of the hits of the evening'. The or
chestra among other selections played
for the first time a new march by
W. C. K. Achi, '12. Two of the Van
couver men rendered a clever piano
duet and followed it with another
aqually good as an encore.
The Gym. Club had charge of the
second half of the program. Wrest
ling, boxing, and foil contests together
with some fine bag-punching, tumbling
and pyramid building constituted then
part of the program.
At the conclusion of the program
every One present enjoyed the "dogs"
and other customary smoker dainties.
G. F. Morgan, '10, had the affair in
charge and kept things moving by
announcing the different numbers.
