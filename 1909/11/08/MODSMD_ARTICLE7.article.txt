# VANCOUVER TEAM LOSES TO CRIPPLED VARSITY
## Disabled Cardinal Fifteen Tally 19 Points in Fast Contest.--First Try of Season Scored Against Stanford. 
### 
Four absentees from the varsity
line-up 011 Saturday weakened the of
fense and cripped the defense to such
an appalling extent that the Vancouver
fifteen was defeated hy the relatively
small score of 1!) to .'5 as against the
5(5 to 0 record of the Wednesday be
fore. Crawford, Thorpe, S. Mitchell
and Brown were unable to appear on
the field and Roth retired early. Con
sequently both the back and forward
play was disrupted. Fortunately,
however, none of the injuries to these
men are serious in nature, and all
of them will be in the best of condi
tion by next Saturday afternoon.
Scrum halt Reed will be the only
man missing in the game with the
Blue and Gold.
Vancouver was represented by a
slightly stronger team in the second
contest than in the first. Sharpe, the
Barbarian, was imported to play wing
three-quarter, and he put up a Clevel
and speedy game. Erl) again covered
himself with glory, while Acting Cap
tain McDonald played an effective
game in the pack.
When the Northerners scored in the
second half, the Stanford goal line
was successfully attacked for the first
time this season. Previously, neither
a try nor a goal from the field had
been registered against the Varsity
this fall. Vancouver's tally was fairly
earned by McDonald after a hard ad
vance by the pack. During the first
half the Cardinal goal was seriously
threatened, and, in fact, Sharpe
crossed the line. He hit the flag on
the touch-line, however, thus prevent
ing a try.
It was late in the opening period
before the Cardinal tallied, and the
half closed with the score only 3 to 0.
Before Stanford could register again,
Vancouver tied the score. Condition
then began to tell, and thereafter the
result was never in doubt.
Captain Mitchell and Bolivian were
easily the most valuable members of
the Varsity. Every advance movement
depended upon one or the other of
them, while they were also strongest
on defense. Cass, at half, played a
cool and accurate game, and T. San
born's offense showed much improve
ment. The .absence of Crawford and
Thorpe seemed to rob the scrum of
all unison, and while the individual
work of several of the forwards was
all that could be desired, the com
bination of the pack was woefully
weak.
First llsilfo
Dole kicked off at 4:43. The ball
did not materially change position for
several minutes after Vancouver re
ceived it. Then Stanford, by clever
work, brought the play to their oppo
nent's 10-yard line. From here, how
ever. Sharpe dribbled, single-handed,
to midfleld, relieving the situation.
Not content with this, Vancouver still
further invaded Cardinal territory,
McCloud and Baker dribbling to the

varsity's syard line. Upon a liue-out
there, Horton relieved twice by hard
plunging, after which Hubbard, Peni
berton and Cheda kept up the good
work with a dribbling rush to Van
couver's 15-yard line. Line-outs and
dribbling placed the ball 10 yards
nearer, and a try was imminent. But
the northerners showed their strong
defensive qualities, and from a ruck
formed within a few yards of their
line, Smith and McDonald dribbled
back to lmdlield. Soon alter, however,
(he varsity gathered its forces, and
Dole, Cheda, Woodcock and Pember
ton figured in the first try. Dribbling
by the first three men rushed the ball
35 yards, where Woodcock secured
and passed to Peniberton, who scored.
Dole did not convert. Score, 3-0. Tal
lies were at a premuium for tlie rest of
the period, though Sharpe was very
near to a try near its end. From a
five-yard scrum he secured for Van
couver and plunged the short distance
for the Stanford line. In putting the
ball over, however, lie knocked down
the line-flag and the try was not al
lowed. The pigskin was in neutral
territory when the whistle blew.
Second Hull'.
Deykin kicked off for Vancouver,
and Holman returned 15 yards to the
varsity's 30-yard line. Hubbard and
Cheda dribbled to midfield, where Erb
fumbled, but managed to find touch at
Vancouver's 40-yard mark. The ball
advanced still further into Vancou
ver's end of the field and remained
there for some time. Then Sharpe and
Smith relieved in emphatic fashion by
dribbling 50 yards to Stanford's 25-
yard line. Scrums took the pigskin
15 yards closer to the cardinal goal
and here McDonald secured and passed
to Ellis, who tallied. Ellis missed his
try for goal. Score, 3-3.
After the drop-out Mitchell's touch
kicking and a rush by Sanborn, Mit
chell and Cook took the ball to Van
couver's 25-yard mark. Here Erb re
lieved and Mitchell returned 40 yards.
Then a line-out gave Cheda the ball.
He ran 10 yards and passed to Horton,
who scored. Dole made up the five
points by a conversion from an acute
angle. The next try came with light
ning-like rapidity. After the kick-off
the ball went quickly to midfield, and
here Pemberton started a passing
rush which ended in a tally. Wors
wick, Kern and Sanborn were the
other participants in the scoring, San
born going over the line. Dole did
not convert. Score, 11-3.
Vancouver almost, carried the var
sity oft its feet immediately after the
drop-out, and the northerners, by
quick work, reached Stanford 15-yard
line. The ball did not remain here
long, however, for successive drib
bling rushes by Doron, Hubbard and
Fitting brought the play to within 25
yards of Vancouver's line. But Van

to midfleld, relieving the situation.
Not content with this, Vancouver still
further invaded Cardinal territory,
McCloud and Baker dribbling to the

varsity's syard line. Upon a liue-out
there, Horton relieved twice by hard
plunging, after which Hubbard, Peni

work with a dribbling rush to Van

dribbling placed the ball 10 yards
nearer, and a try was imminent. But
the northerners showed their strong
defensive qualities, and from a ruck

back to lmdlield. Soon alter, however,

five-yard scrum he secured for Van

for the Stanford line. In putting the

Vancouver's 40-yard mark. The ball
advanced still further into Vancou

Smith relieved in emphatic fashion by
dribbling 50 yards to Stanford's 25-

Deykin kicked off for Vancouver,
and Holman returned 15 yards to the
varsity's 30-yard line. Hubbard and
Cheda dribbled to midfield, where Erb
fumbled, but managed to find touch at
Vancouver's 40-yard mark. The ball
