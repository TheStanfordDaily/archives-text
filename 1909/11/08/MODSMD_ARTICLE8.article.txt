8:15 the curtain was pulled aside on
the improvised stage and the Senior
cohorts drenched the actors with a
shower of promiscuous missils des

things which they thought might take
the Junior cast's thoughts away from
their lines.

rush started as soon as possible and
in a few moments the Juniors led
their first charge up the steps against
the Senior class which repulsed this
and many other like attempts on the
part of the Junior men to gain a foot

over an hour and many men were
trampled under foot and forced to
leave the contest temporarily. No one
