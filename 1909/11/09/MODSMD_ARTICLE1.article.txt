# TO PLAY SECOND TEAM
## LAST VARSITY SCRUMMAGE TO OCCUR WEDNESDAY. In To-morrow's Line-up Cardinal Fifteen Will Be Without Brown, Roth and S, Mitchell. 
### 
During the four days remaining be
fore the intercollegiate rugby game
with the University of California the
Cardinal Varsity will practice but
twice, one of these taking the form of
a line-up with the second team. On
Wednesday afternoon at 4:45 the final
preliminary scrummage will occur.
At this time either one long or two
short halves will be played. In tlie
contest to-morrow, however, neither
center three-quarter Roth, full-hack
Brown nor second five-eights S. .Mit
chell will appear. It. is expected that
all of these men will be perfectly fit
by Saturday, and although they are
in fairly good condition at the pres
ent moment, Coach Presley prefers
to take as few chances as possible and
consequently will withhold them on
Wednesday. It is a practical cer
tainty that both Crawford and Thorpe
will play with the fifteen to-morrow.
On Thursday the squad will have
but a light practice in passing, drib
bling and kicking, and Friday will see
the Varsity and substitutes in the
hills. They will spend the day at
Woodside.
At 4:45 Thursday afternoon Coach
Presley will announce the personnel
ol' the varsity fifteen and the names
of the substitutes who will be in read
iness on the side-lines the following
Saturday. Unless unforseen compli
cations arise to prevent one or more
of the recently injured backs from
playing, the make-up of the team will
probably be a matter of little or no
surprise. Should it be necessary to
fill the places of either Brown, Roth
or S. Mitchell, however, the result
would not be subject to certain pre
diction. The exceptional work of 'I'.
Sanborn seems to insure him the first
opportunity at five. Should someone
be needed at center, the coach would
have the alternative of utilizing San
born, if not already placed at five, or
of bringing Cook in from the wing.
Such a shifting of Cook would give
the left wing to a freshman, either
Kern or Worswick, between whom
desperate competition is now waging.
The Varsity, as it will appear to
morrow, follows:
Horton, Fitting, Cheda, Dole, Craw
ford, Pemberton, Thorpe, forwards;
Cass, half; M. Mitchell, T. Sanborn,
fives: Cook, center; Holman and Kern
or Worswick. wings; Fletcher, full.
