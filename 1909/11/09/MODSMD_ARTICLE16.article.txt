# PLANS TWO EVENTS
## GYMNASIUM CLUB TO EXHIBIT AND HOLD CONTEST. Open Meeting to Be Given November 25 and Gymnastic Meet Scheduled for December 2. 
### 
The Gymnasium Club, meeting
last night, decided to give two public
events in the near future, the first of
which is to be an open meeting night,
mid the second an evening of competi
tive gymnastics. These events are to
take the place of the formal exhibi
tion usually given by the club.
November 25 is the date selected
for the open meeting, and the compe
tition will probablly follow a week
later, on December 2. The open meet
ing is not to be an elaborate affair,
and no set program will be offered,
other than the work that is regularly
done at ordinary meetings of the club.
The competition is established
with the idea of its becoming an an
imal affair, open to all members of
the University. This year, however,
as the list of events is, in a way, pro
visional, the entries will be restricted
to the membership of the Gym. Club.
Wooden shields are to be fixed on the
walls of the gymnasium and the names
of event winners and their records
are to be posted yearly. The events
decided upon are fence vault, snap
from vault bar, undershoot from high
bar, eighteen-foot rope climb, high
jump standing and from spring board,
snap from bar for height and general
gymnastics on five pieces of appar
atus.
Such events as dip and pull-ups
which are heavy strength stnnts, have
been omitted from the list because
both Instructor Long and H. V. Poor,
'10, the president of the club, agree
that their inclusion would unneces
sarily prolong the contest and make it
less of a strictly gymnastic affair.
