# Go Out and Yell To-morrow.
## PREPARED FOR CROWD. Double Track from Present Side-Track in County Road Will Help Relieve Congestion Saturday. 
### 
The construction gangs of (he Pen
insular Railway have been actively
engaged in laying a second track from
the County road tc? connect with the
present side-track which lies back of
the Track bleachers. A large force
has been employed at this work and
the work will be completed before
Saturday. This will enable the com
pany to operate their cars on a much
faster schedule on the day of the
big game, as it will do away with
one car waiting on the side-track for
the arrival of the other cars. Event
ually spring switches will be placed
at the ends of this new stretch of
double track, doing away with the
necessity of turning switches.
The company will begin ballasting
its tracks in a few days. The long
delay in this work was occasioned
by the failure of the rock ballast to
arrive. Sunday, however, three cars
of ballast arrived in Palo Alto, and
the work of ballasting will progress
as rapidly as possible after the new
track is completed.
To prevent the possibility of any of
the freight cars which are sometimes
left back of the Engineering depart
ment from getting away and starting
down the track, a derailing switch
lias been installed.
