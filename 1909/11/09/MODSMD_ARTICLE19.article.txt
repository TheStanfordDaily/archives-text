# BIG PROGRAM READY
## SOUVENIR PROGRAM ON PRESSES IS LARGEST EVER. Managers Walker and Thompson Announce Book Will Contain Interesting Innovations. 
### 
The forms were closed yesterday
on the intercollegiate souvenir pro
gram for the big game, and Managers
D. H. Walker, '09, and J. E. Thomp
son, '11, expect the books to arrive
on the campus some time Thursday
or the day following, allowing suffic
ient time for distribution preparatory
to the opening of the gates on Sat
urday.
The book will be the largest of the
kind ever issued by the universities.
It will contain new innovations con
sidered necessary to keep apace witli
the growth of rugby on the coast, and
should prove a valuable reference in
regard to the rules of rugby and
points ol' interest in the history of
football struggles.
The photographs of coaches, cap
tains, trainers, yell-leaders and man
agers as well as striking reproduc
tions of the veterans of both univer
sities in action are included.
The songs for this season and those
of past years which have proven last
ing, have been compiled and placed
conveniently in the program. \ score
card, a chart of the field showing line
ups and a code of intercollegiate rules
are to be found.
The other features which have been
included in past books will be in the
latest edition of the annual publica
tion. Especial attention has been
given to the reproduction of the cuts
of the two squads which will appear
as full-page illustrations.
Stuart Macdonald of the Chaparral
staff has officiated as the artist for
the book and submits an original and
striking cover design in three colors.
The proceeds of this book will be
turned for the greater part into the
student body treasury to be divided
between Stanford and California, and
the managers believe that with a good
day and an average sale the share
which Stanford will realize will ex
ceed that of any past book, as the
advertising space secured is a third
greater than that obtained last year.
In this respect Managers Walker and
Thompson have issued a personal note
in the book calling attention to the
liberality of the advertisers and un
officially state that they believe the
advertising question is one which
should be carefully considered by the
undergraduates. The program will
sell for 25 cents a copy.
