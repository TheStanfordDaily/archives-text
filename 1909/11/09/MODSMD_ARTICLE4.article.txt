# SOUSA'S BAND TOMORROW NIGHT
## Famous Instrumental Organization and Soloists Will Present Program Under Baton of Celebrated Leader. 
### 
Opportunity will be given to-mor
row evening to hear John Philip Sou
sa's Hand in the Assembly Hall. The
band is probably the most famous or
ganization of its kind in the world,
containing as it does fifty master
band-men. Not only is the personnel
of the band complete, but the con
ductor himself is known the world
over, both as a composer and a leader,
well deserving the title of "March
King" which has been bestowed upon
him.
The program will be a varied one.
Not only will the lovers ot' classical
music be amply repaid by attending
the concert, but also those people
who enjoy the better class of light
music will find the program to their
taste.
Besides the regular numbers of
the program, there will be solos b\
all of the great artists with the band.
First among these is Mr. Herbert
L. Clark, who is without a doubt the
world's first solo cornetist. He has
been with the band for some years
and his position in the musical world
is firmly established. The violinist
that always is heard at a Sousa con
cert is on this tour, Miss Florence
Hardemann, a young southern player,
who is a rising star in the musical
firmament.
One of the principal numbers of the
program will be the suite "The Last
Days of Pompeii," by Sousa. This
suite was inspired by Bulwer Lytton's
novel of the same name, and is de
scriptive in the best musical sense of
the word ol' the fall of Pompeii. The
audience will also have the pleasure
of seeing Sousa conduct one of his
own marches.
Of the classical music, probably the
finest selection will be that from the
Fourth Symphony of Tschaikowsky's.
The allegro movement will be played.
Of the very modern Romanic school,
the selection by Rachmaninoff, the
greatest of the younger Russian com-

I posers, will be an excellent example.
Taken as a whole it is a better
musical program, with the possible
exception of that given last year by
the New York Symphony, than has
been presented for a Stanford audi
! ence.

The program to be rendered to
morrow night will be as follows:
[Meditation on Sacred Melodies,
"Songs of Grace and Glory"..
Sousa
Cornet solo, "Shower of Gold"
(new) Clarke
Mr. Herbert Clarke.
Suite, "The Last Days of Pompeii"
Sousa
Vocal duet, "Barcarolle" from
"Contes D'Hoffman" ...Offenbach
