# WILL BE HIT OF SHOW
## W.P. FULLER. ’10, ASSISTED BY CHORUS WILL SING. Songs Are New and Catchy.—Costumes and Scenery to Be Made Especially for This Act. 
### 
What will, in all probability, be
i one of the biggest hits of the Foot
j ball Vaudeville Show, is an act by
; W. P. Fuller, '10, assisted by six pop
ular women of the University. These
j include the Misses M. T. Howell. '10,
J A. L. Perring, '10, A. C. Huntsberger,
10. M. L. Ozier, 10, R. llaslett, '11,
and H. Neal, "12. Fuller needs no in
troduction as his ability is well known
by every Stanford play-goer. Every
member of his chorus lias taken part
in the operas and plays of the last
I year. Several catchy and new songs
will be suny in this act, and with
the special costumes, scenery and
I lighting effects which have been pro
: vided for, can not fail to make a big
! hit. The singing will be accompanied
by the Orchestra in its entire strength.
Within the next few days posters,
in imitation of t lie usual professional
vaudeville bills, will be scattered over
the campus, and banners will be dis
played on the street cars. A feature
of the show will be the local color
that is to be introduced, including hits
at many of the prominent undergrad
uates.
As a special concession the railroad
company has granted an extra car
service for the night of the show, cars
leaving Palo Alto for the Campus in
time for the show, and returning at its
conclusion.
From to-day on rehearsals will be
held in the Assembly Hall under the
direction of G. F. Morgan, '10. who
is staging the production, and this will
enable the actors to become well ac
quainted with the stage before the
final night.
Seats for the show have sold with
remarkable rapidity and the supply
is very nearly exhausted at the Hook
store. A number of good seats still
remain for sale at the Stanford Pharm
acy in Palo Alto, however, and any
one desiring to secure them should
do so at once.
