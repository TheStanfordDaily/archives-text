# Put Some Life into the Yells.
## California Varsity Practices Here. 
### 
This afternoon the turf field was
given over to the California varsity
rugby team, in order that the Blue
and Gold players might become ac
customed to the peculiarities of the
ground in preparation for the intercol
legiate contest next Saturday. Coach
Schaeffer directed the practice of the
California fifteen and gave them every
opportunity to make themselves at
home on the field. Arriving at 3:20
this afternoon the Berkeley men left
in the evening at the conclusion of
the work.
