# FINAL LINE-UP IS OVER
## VARSITY DEFEATS SECOND TEAM IN A SHORT HALE. Roth, S. Mitchell and Brown Being Given Rest by Coach Presley. 
### 
The last varsity line-up before the
California game brought no surprises
and no casualties this afternoon. The
short 15-minute half against the sec
ond team resulted in a 10-O score.
The two tries made were converted
neatly by Crawford. The varsity play
ing was satisfying, though no bril
liant work was shown. The scrum as
made up for practically the entire
season, was intact, Crawford and
Thorpe playing in a scrummage for
the first time since their injury a week
ago. S. Mitchell, Roth, and Brown
were absent from the backfield, Coach
Presley not considering it wise for
them to enter a scrummage until they
are completely rested. Of these three
men who may be said to be upon in
jured list, the condition of S. Mitchell
alone can be thought to be doubtful.
He is recovering rapidly however, and
should be in shape to play before
Saturday. Roth and Brown are prac
tically in condition, and were kept off
the line-up this afternoon simply
through danger of further injury.
The final make-up of the varsity
fifteen will probably be announced
sometime to-morrow and the team will
appear on the turf for a short prac
tice in the new suits recently ordered
for them.
The two tries made this afternoon
were the results of good work by both
scrum and backs. The first, came
when Minturn secured within 10 yards
of the scrub's line and passed to Craw
ford. He in turn transferred to Mit
chell, who scores. The second score
was made by Dole after a scrum on
the 5-yard line. Crawford kicked both
goals.
The teams lined up as follows:
Varsity — Cheda, Fitting, Horton,
Minturn, Dole, Crawford, Pemberton,
Thorpe, forwards; Cass, half; M. Mit
chell, T. Sanborn, fives: Cook, center;
Holman, Worskick, wings; Fletcher,

Acker, Partridge, Hubbard, Doron,
lline. Woodcock, forwards; Elliot,
