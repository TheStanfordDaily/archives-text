To-morrow night will be the last
opportunity for the Student Body to
show ihe team the spirit which will
be behind them on Saturday. In

it may engender a spirit which will
encourage and urge the varsity to a
victory Saturday, it devolves upon
each individual to be present and put
every bit oL enthusiasm and spirit he
possesses into the occasion. Make
every yell the loudest and every sonti
the best, and wind it up with the big
gest serpentine in Stanford history.
