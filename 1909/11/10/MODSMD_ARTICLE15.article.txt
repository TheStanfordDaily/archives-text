Each fraternity should make a spe
cial effort to assist in carrying out
the plans outlined by the Yell-Lead
ers for to-morrow's rally by procur
ing red fire for the illumination on
the Flow previous to adjournment to
Assembly Hall. The idea is a new
one and if carried out unanimously
will in a unique and effective manner,
add to the spirit and enthusiasm of the
occasion.
