## 
### 
There are still ten Freshman col
lectors for the fund for the stunts
at the biff game who have not been
heard from as yet. The money is
needed immediately and President
Hill requests that the following men
get busy and collect their part:
Warden, Gregg, Bradford, Vickery,
Boyd, Leahman, Lair, Reed, Thobiirn
and Black.
