# QUARTETTE WILL SING
## VENETIAN STREET SINGERS TO BE "HEADLINER" IN SHOW. Spanish Dance Will Be Introduced in This Act.â€”Mathieu Pleased with Cast of Skit. 
### 
Among the novel features which
are being planned for the Football
Vaudeville Show, is a quartet of Vene
tian street singers, who will appear
in appropriate costumes and sing
characteristic Spanish and Italian
music. The quartet will include Miss
E. J. Davis, '09, Miss D. G. Slawson,
'12, P. F. Pettigrew, '10, and H. Mc-
Guire, '13. Both Miss Davis and Miss
Slawson are well-known soloists in
choral work, the former singing so
prano and the latter contralto.
The costumes for this act are of
bright colors and Spanish in char
acter. A Spanish dance will be intro
duced in which castinets, tambourines
and streamers will be used. The mu
sic has been especially orchestrated
for this act and the accompaniment
will lie carried by the flute, violin,
cello and piano.
Roland Roberts, the well-known
music teacher, lias very kindly don
ated his services to coach this act.
With the excellent voices that make
up the quartet and with Roberts as
coach, it is assured of having a place
among the "headliners" of the Vaude
ville Show.
Mr. Mathieu conducted another re
hearsal of the skit "It's All in the
Draw," of which he is the author,
and expressed himself as being more
than satisfied with the cast. The
scene of the play is laid in San Fran
cisco shortly after the fire and earth
quake of 190G. There are four char
acters in the skit, all of whom are of
equal importance. These include a
Chinaman, butler, a tough chauffeur
and a scape-goat.
