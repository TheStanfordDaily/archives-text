# FOOTBALL "CHAPPIE" TOMORROW
## Largest Issue of Stanford's Comic Ever Published Will Feature Coming Contest. 
### 
The largest number of the Chapar
ral ever published, comprising a total
of forty-four pages pages, will lie on
sale to-morrow morning on the Quad.
The issue will be given over to foot
ball for the most part, and contains
an unusual number of interesting fea
tures.
The art will be unusually good.
V. F. Bellows, '09, contributes a lull
page drawing, "My Rosary," which is
even above the usual standard of his
work. Two attractive pages by Stuart
Macdonald depict lively moments in
the Plug-Ugly rush and the big game.
Chappie writes up the game in a page
by E. M. Albright, '12, which shows
each of the men on the team in a
characteristic stunt. There are sev
eral drawings by Nelly Peterson, ex
'o9, and the remainder of the art work
by Salisbury, King, Smith and others
is excellent.
Miss Alice M. Richards, gr., has
contributed the first-page poem, "A
Junior Toast." In "Who'll Make the
Biggest Show?" a condensed melo
drama by E. C. Matthias, '11, and
"The Committee Resigns," by B. O.
Bliven, '11, Chappie takes a fling at
the men who caused the recent fracas
about the Football Show. G. F. Mor
gan. 10, and Bliven have written a
lively resume of the last opera, called
"The Crimes of the Rhubarb Club,"
while E. .1. Hopkins, '11, contrib
utes another of his "Sonnets of a Ruf-
Nekk." R. L. Duffus, '10, tells about
the Stanford Dos and has written
some clever verse.
The editorials deal with the big
game, conduct of the rooters, and
plagiarism.
