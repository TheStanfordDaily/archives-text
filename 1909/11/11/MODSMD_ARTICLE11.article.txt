In order that the team may go into
the game Saturday in the best pos
sible condition it. is imperative that tlie
men have an opoprtunity for undis
turbed rest these remaining nights
before the contest. After tlie rally to
night and all of to-morrow night,
there should be absolute quiet upon
the Campus. To the underclassmen
who will be on guard during these
nights a word of especial warning is
given lest the spirit of the occasion
result in a lapse of care in this re
gard. It is for each individual to
maintain quiet himself and be prompt
to suppress any semblance of a dis
turbance. Give the team a chance.
In this morning's issue of a San
Francisco newspaper appeared an ar
ticle dealing with the recently deter
mined eligibility of a Stanford var
sity player, which was so grossly false
and so flagrantly a misrepresentation
as to call forth reluctant notice. That
a metropolitan daily should lend its
columns to an article so obviously
actuated by malice and in which facts
are omitted and truth distorted in a
vain endeavor to appear logical, is a
poor reflection upon the type of jour
nalism which this particular paper
represents.
In all it appears very evident, to
even the most casual observer, that
the incident was a disgraceful case of
a paper bartering the use of its news
columns for a "scoop." Or to get
at the matter from the other end, a
case of giving out exclusive news in
return for the privilege of dictating
a "roast." Such tactics are con
demned by newspaper ethics and
should lnive been considered beneath
the dignity of either the sport writer
or the person furnishing the news.
