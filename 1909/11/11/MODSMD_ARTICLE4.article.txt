John Raymond Holnian Right Wing Three-quarter
Aliuoii Edward Roth Left Wing Three-quarter
Floyd Cromwell Brown Full

These are the fifteen men whom
Coach Presley has selected as the
Stanford Varsity team for 1909. The
surprises are few. Sanborn's excep
tional ability so recently demonstrated
won him a position, which necessitated
the shifting of Roth to left wing. The
latter place was the most doubtful of
the fifteen. Otherwise, the final an
nouncement merely fulfilled general
expectations. Presley will have ten
substitutes on the side-lines, although
the rules permit the use of but three.
The ten are G. McGregor, '09, H. L.
Hubbard, '12, C. E. Woodcock, '11,
.T. W. Doron, '12, J. E. Elliott, '11,
H. R. Stoltz, '09. A. 1?. Cook, '10, G. D.
Worswick, '13, E. Kern, '13, W. D.
Fletcher, '11.
M. M. Mitchell.
M. M. Mitchell, '10, of Los Angeles,
will captain the fifteen and play first
five-eights. This is Mitchell's third
season as varsity five. In 1906 he
appeared at that position on his fresh
man team. He is cool, heady, reliable,
speedy, an accurate passer and never
downed with the ball in his posses
sion. Mitchell can boast of every qual
fication essential to a Rugby back.
During the present season he has suf
fered extremely bad luck, as an in
jured shoulder kept him on the field
for more than a month. He is in per
fect shape now, however, and on both
offense and defense he will be the key
stone of the Cardinal backfield. Mit
chell weighs IC6 pounds, measures
ft., 11 in., and is 23 years old. He
majors in Economics and belongs to
she Quadrangle Club and the Zeta Psi
fraternity. Mitchell is also well
known on the diamond. As a Soph
omore he caught for the Varsity nine,
while last spring he played third base.
Horton.
H. L. Horton, '09, of Ukiah, will be
the third man in the front rank. Al
though Horton not only played on his
freshman team but also made the var
sity eleven his first year, previous to
tliis season he could not be persuaded
to become a Rugby candidate. From
the beginning he proved himself a
valuable forward, however, and now
he is as steady and reliable as any
man in the [tack. Horton possesses
an enviable reputation in track ath

letics as well as in football. In the
intercollegiate meet of 1905 he cap
tured 9 points; in 1907 he did not
compete; in 1908 he won 7 points;
and in 1909 restricted to the shot
put only by an injured leg, he took
second place in that event. Horton
has twice represented Stanford at the
Western Conference, being a point
winner in each instance. He cap
tained this year's track team. Hor
ton is a member of the Quadrangle
Club, Encina Club and Skull and
Snakes. He majors in Civil Engineer
ing, weighs 200 pounds, is 6 ft., 1
in., in height and 24 years old.
Clieda.
G. E. Cheda, '10, will be in the mid
dle position of the front rank. Than
Cheda there is no more consistent
or fiercer player on the fifteen. He
undertakes to be right on the ball
from the opening kick-off until the
final call of time. His dribbling is
clever and bis tackling unfailing and
reliable. He is always the first for
ward down on a free kick or drop
out. This will be Cheda's second
season as a member of the original
varsity team, as he played in the 1906
scrum. Also he was substituted in
the rear rank during the second half
of the 1908 intercollegiate game. He
also played with the 1910 Freshmen.
Cheda registers from San Luis Obispo
in the department of Geology and Min
ing and is a member of Encina Club.
He is 24 years of age, weighs 185
pounds and is 5 ft., BV£ in. tall.
FiHing.
Alongside of Cheda in the front
rank will be .J. W. Fitting, '10. Fit
ting has been continually ineligible
since his freshman year, when lie
played on his first-year team which
was defeated 3 to 0. Had he been
eligible, it. is probable that Fitting
would have been varsity material as
early as his Sophomore year. He is
a heavy man, tipping the scales at
190, and essentially a fighter. In the
front row he has developed into a
clever hooker and an especially strong
defensive forward. Fitting is 5 ft.,
11V 2 in.in height and 22 years of
age. He registers from San Fran
cisco in the Civil Engineering depart
ment. He belongs to Encina Club.
Fitting has also been prominent in
boating. He stroked the Varsity ibis
spring and occupied the same posi
tion on his freshman crew. He rowed
with tlie Cardinal eight against Wash
ington in 1907.
Mint urn.
L. R. Minturn, '09, will be in one
of the middle-rank positions. Min
turn has twice before participated in
a varsity game with California, play
ing lock in both 1906 and 1907. In
eligibility alone kept him off the team
last fall. He is also a star at the
old game, which he learned at Bel
mont under the tutelage of W. T.
Reid, Jr., of Harvard. Minturn was a
guard on his freshman eleven. He
is as strong as any man on the fif
teen and thoroughly understands every
trick of the forward play. He is sel
dom spectacular but always depend
able. Minturn hails from San Fran
cisco and majors in the department
of Electrical Engineering. He is 22
years old, 0 ft., IV2 in.in height and
weighs 200 pounds. He is a member
of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity.
Dole.
The second man in the middle rank
will be K. L. Dole, '11, of Riverside.
Dole played lock on his freshman
lit'teen and was placed at that posi
tion on the 1909 varsity a few days be
fore the game with California after
a close struggle for the place, which
continued throughout the season.
Dole is a continuously fierce player
who is always on top of the ball.
In securing possession on the line-out
he has 110 peer. Dole is a member of
the Heta Theta Pi fraternity and maj
ors in Systematic Botany. He is 21
years old, weighs 190 pounds and
measures H ft., 1 in. Dole has also
won bis "S" in boating. He rowed
on the 1909 varsity and the 1911
freshman crew.
Cm »lord.
111 the rear rank will be D. P.
Crawford. '09, the captain of the 190S
Varsity and probably the best Rugby
forward in North America. Experts
are unanimous in their opinion that
Crawford could win himself a position
on any fifteen in the world. His 210
pounds, coupled with his knowledge
of the game, his speed and enormous
strength, renders him indispensable
in every department of forward play.
Added to this he is a remarkable pun
ter and i)lace kicker. Crawford played
right tackle on his freshman eleven
and on the Varsity his first year.
Ineligible in 190(5, he appeared at
side rank in both 1907 and 190S, being
captain of last year's victorious fif
teen. Crawford is as famous on the
track as 011 the gridiron. in his
Sophomore year he took first place
in the shot-put in the intercollegiate
meet. The following spring he failed
to compete, while in April of this year
lie won both the hammer and shot
from California, and in June joined
with Miller in winning the individual
medals at the Conference Meet at
Chicago. Here Crawford was first in
both the weight events. He registers
from Cupertino in Civil Engineering
and is a member of Encina Club, the
Quadrangle Club and Skull and
Snakes, lie is 22 years of age and
»i ft.. 2'l-4 in.in height.
Peniberton.
J. R. Pemberton, '08, of Palo Alto,
will appear in the middle of the rear
rank. He is a powerful and dangerous
player, especially formidable in the
loose. Petuberton is always liable to

spring a sensation at any minute of
the game. He as a member of the
fifteens which won from the Blue and
Gold 6 to I], 21 to 11, and 12 to 3.
Consequently, lie will this year attain
four stars. In 1906, 1907 and 1908
Pemberton rowed 011 the varsity crew
and he also pulled an oar in the Port
land four that took second in the in
ternational regatta of 1900. Pember
ton is 6 ft., 2V 2 in. tall, weighs 190
pounds and is 20 years of age. He
registers in Geology and Mining and
belongs to Kappa Alpha and Skull and
Snakes.
Thorpe.
C. A. Thorpe, '09, will be the eighth
man in the scrum. Thorpe played
in the rear rank of the 1900 and 1907
Varsity, being ineligible in 1908. He
was also a member of the scrum of the
1910 freshman llfteen. Like Minturn,
Thorpe was a man of exceptional value
in intercollegiate football, having been
taught the game at Belmont by Reid.
In Rugby he is clever 011 both offense
and defense. He dribbles well, tack
les surely and understands every de
tail of the play of the pack. Thorpe
claims loamosa as his home. He
registers in the department of Math
ematics and belongs to Skull and
Snakes and the Beta Theta Pi fra
ternity. He measures 5 ft., 11V 2 in.,
is 23 years old and weighs ISO pounds.
Cass.
One of the two Freshmen 011 the !
fifteen will be L. Cass, who is slated
for the position of scrum half. Al
though Cass played right wing three
quarter 011 the 1913 team last month,
he received not a little practice at
half during the freshman season and
was shifted back 1o that position im
mediately after joining the varsity
squad. When Reed was injured in
the first, game with the Vancouver
fifteen, Cass replaced him and made j
good in the position at once. He pos- ,
sesses all the qualifications necessary |
for a half: speed, coolness, cleverness '
and accuracy. Cass registers from j
i,os Angeles in Economics and belongs j
to Zeta Psi. He weighs 150 pounds,
is 19 years old and 5 ft., 10 in.in
height.
S. I, Mitchell.
The second five-eights will be S.
L. Mitchell, '13, a brother of Captain
and Kirst Five-eights M. M. Mitchell.
As captain and second five of the 1913
freshman, S. L. Mitchell was the main
stay of the backfield. He was the key
stone player 011 the offense and the
most reliable man 011 defense. Im
mediately after the freshman game
with California be was placed at five
011 the Varsity, where he has since
been kept, save when injuries pre
vented him from playing. Mitchell
is only now recovering from a severe

kick, but should be in suitable con
dition by Saturday. He belongs to the
/eta Psi fraternity and majors in
Economics from Los Angeles. He is
21 years of age, weighs 180 pounds
and measures 5 ft., 10 x /> in.
Sanborn.
T. Sanborn, '12, will be the center
three-quarter. Two weeks ago San
born was not considered even as a
possibility for the Varsity. During
j the last few games of the season,
however, he was substituted at second
five and center for S. Mitchell and
Roth, respectively, and his playing
was so exceptional that the announce
ment of his success in earning a place
is anything but a surprise. Sanborn
jis fast and sturdy. In the second
! Vancouver game he seemed to have
| completely overcome his one bad tend
ency, that of holding on to the ball
j until downed. Sanborn majors in
Civil Engineering, hails from Red
lands and is a member of the Phi
Delta Theta fraternity. He is 20
years of age, weighs 102 pounds and
| measures 5 ft., 10 in.
llolmnii.
For the fourth time in as many
! years J. R. Holman, '09, of Portland,
will be the right wing three-quarter.
There is 110 speedier or more clever
; man 011 the team. In each of the three
j intercollegiate games in which be has
participated, Holman has been the
' sensational offensive player. Once
started, he is almost impossible to
stop, and his store of unexpected
"tricks of the trade" is well-nigh in
exhaustible. He knows the backfield
tactics in detail, and his coaching is
a source of constant aid to his less
experienced colleagues. Holman was
captain and quarter of the 1909
freshman eleven. On the track lie
took third place in both the sprints
j in 1907, and second place in the same
| events in 1908. Last, spring a recent
I breakdown forced him to retire shortly
'after the start of his heat in the 100.
Holman belongs to Quadrangle Club
and the /eta Psi fraternity and reg
isters in the department of Electrical
Engineering. He is G ft. in height,
weighs 102 pounds and is 22 years
old.
Itotli.
The left wing three-quarter will
be A. E. Roth, '09. of Redlands. The
late shifting of Roth from center to
wing was made in order to give San
born a position 011 the fifteen. Of the
two, Roth is the more versatile, and
accordingly lie was moved. He was
substitute on last year's varsity fifteen
and was in the original Cardinal line
up in the games with Vancouver dur
ing the Christinas holidays, when his
work was of so brilliant a nature that
from i lie first of this season he has
been a practicable certainty. Although
effective on defense, his cleverness is
more marked in advancing the ball.
Roth's swerving runs through a scat
tered lieid have been tlie prettiest bits
of play seen on Stanford Field this
fall. Injuries have kept him out of
the line-up during the past two weeks.
Roth is now Student Advisor and last
year was president of the Associated
Students. He is a member of Phi
Delta Phi, Encina Club, Quadrangle
Club and Skull and Snakes. He is
2!> years old, weighs IGS pounds and
is 5 ft., 10 in.in height.
Brown.
F. C. Brown, '11, will be the full
back. Brown's sensationally spec
tacular work as full on the vanquished
1911 freshman fifteen earned him, on
the 1907 Varsity, the position of sub
stitute to Cadwalader, whom lie re
placed during the progress of the
game. He was not registered in tlie
university last fall, but this year he
has been assured of his place from
the beginning of the season. Besides
being a long and accurate punter,
Brown is a certain tackier. No mat
ter how speedy or slippery, an oppo
nent never gets by him. Brown was
injured in Los Angeles and as a result
has been out of the game for the past
two weeks. He will be in excellent
shape for Saturday, however. Brown
hails from Selma, majors in Electri
cal Engineering and belongs to Skull
and Snakes and Encina Club. He is
5 ft., 10 in.in height, 21 years of
age and weighs 170 pounds.
The Substitutes.
G. McGregor, '09, of Benecia lias been
chosen as substitute for front rank.
He registers in the Civil Engineering
department, and is a member of En
cina Club.
The middle rank second man will be
represented by H. L. Hubbard, '12, who
majors in Economics. He lives in
Redlands and is an Encina Club mem
ber.
Two men have been listed to take
the place of injured rear rankers.
These are J. W. Doron, '12, of Carona,
and C. E. Woodcock, '11, of Portland,

Ore. Doron is a Chemistry major, and
Woodcock registers in Electrical En
gineering. Both men are members of
Encina Club.
J. E. Elliott, '11, will take the place
of Cass at half back, in case the lat
ter is hurt. Elliott, registering from
Pacific Grove, is a Geology major. He
is numbered among Encina Club mem
bers.
The positions of first and second
five-eights will be well substituted for
by 11. R. Stoltz, '09, who is a resident
of Redlands. He is listed in the Phys
iology department and is a member
of Delta Upsilon fraternity.
A. B. Cook, '10, of Santa Barbara,
will substitute for T. Sanborn at cen
ter three-quarters, if need should
arise. Cook is a Civil Engineering
major, and is an Encina Club member.
Roth and Ilolman will be seconded
by G. D. Worswick, '13, and E. Kern,
'13. Worswick lives in San Jose and
registers as an Economics major. The
Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity claims
him as a member. Kern is a resident
of Berkeley, majoring in Economics.
He is a member of Beta Theta Pi fra
ternity.
W. I). Fletcher, '11, of Palo Alto,
will substitute for F. C. Brown at
full-back. He is an Encina Club man
and registers in the Civil Engineering
department.

T. Sanborn, '12, will be the center
three-quarter. Two weeks ago San
born was not considered even as a
possibility for the Varsity. During
j the last few games of the season,
however, he was substituted at second
five and center for S. Mitchell and
Roth, respectively, and his playing
was so exceptional that the announce
ment of his success in earning a place
is anything but a surprise. Sanborn
jis fast and sturdy. In the second
! Vancouver game he seemed to have
| completely overcome his one bad tend
ency, that of holding on to the ball
j until downed. Sanborn majors in
Civil Engineering, hails from Red
lands and is a member of the Phi
Delta Theta fraternity. He is 20
years of age, weighs 102 pounds and
| measures 5 ft., 10 in.
llolmnii.
For the fourth time in as many
! years J. R. Holman, '09, of Portland,
will be the right wing three-quarter.
There is 110 speedier or more clever
; man 011 the team. In each of the three
j intercollegiate games in which be has
participated, Holman has been the
' sensational offensive player. Once
started, he is almost impossible to
stop, and his store of unexpected
"tricks of the trade" is well-nigh in
exhaustible. He knows the backfield
tactics in detail, and his coaching is
a source of constant aid to his less
experienced colleagues. Holman was
captain and quarter of the 1909
freshman eleven. On the track lie
took third place in both the sprints
j in 1907, and second place in the same
| events in 1908. Last, spring a recent
I breakdown forced him to retire shortly
'after the start of his heat in the 100.
Holman belongs to Quadrangle Club
and the /eta Psi fraternity and reg
isters in the department of Electrical
Engineering. He is G ft. in height,
weighs 102 pounds and is 22 years
old.
Itotli.
The left wing three-quarter will
be A. E. Roth, '09. of Redlands. The
late shifting of Roth from center to
wing was made in order to give San
born a position 011 the fifteen. Of the
two, Roth is the more versatile, and
accordingly lie was moved. He was
substitute on last year's varsity fifteen
and was in the original Cardinal line
up in the games with Vancouver dur
ing the Christinas holidays, when his
work was of so brilliant a nature that
from i lie first of this season he has
been a practicable certainty. Although
effective on defense, his cleverness is
more marked in advancing the ball.
Roth's swerving runs through a scat
tered lieid have been tlie prettiest bits
of play seen on Stanford Field this
fall. Injuries have kept him out of
the line-up during the past two weeks.
Roth is now Student Advisor and last
year was president of the Associated
Students. He is a member of Phi
Delta Phi, Encina Club, Quadrangle
Club and Skull and Snakes. He is
2!> years old, weighs IGS pounds and
is 5 ft., 10 in.in height.
Brown.
F. C. Brown, '11, will be the full
back. Brown's sensationally spec
tacular work as full on the vanquished
1911 freshman fifteen earned him, on
the 1907 Varsity, the position of sub
stitute to Cadwalader, whom lie re
placed during the progress of the
game. He was not registered in tlie
university last fall, but this year he
has been assured of his place from
the beginning of the season. Besides
being a long and accurate punter,
Brown is a certain tackier. No mat
ter how speedy or slippery, an oppo
nent never gets by him. Brown was
injured in Los Angeles and as a result
has been out of the game for the past
two weeks. He will be in excellent
shape for Saturday, however. Brown
hails from Selma, majors in Electri
cal Engineering and belongs to Skull
and Snakes and Encina Club. He is
5 ft., 10 in.in height, 21 years of
age and weighs 170 pounds.
The Substitutes.
G. McGregor, '09, of Benecia lias been
chosen as substitute for front rank.
He registers in the Civil Engineering
department, and is a member of En
cina Club.
The middle rank second man will be
represented by H. L. Hubbard, '12, who
majors in Economics. He lives in
Redlands and is an Encina Club mem
ber.
Two men have been listed to take
the place of injured rear rankers.
These are J. W. Doron, '12, of Carona,
and C. E. Woodcock, '11, of Portland,

Ore. Doron is a Chemistry major, and
Woodcock registers in Electrical En
gineering. Both men are members of
Encina Club.
J. E. Elliott, '11, will take the place
of Cass at half back, in case the lat
ter is hurt. Elliott, registering from
Pacific Grove, is a Geology major. He
is numbered among Encina Club mem
bers.
The positions of first and second
five-eights will be well substituted for
by 11. R. Stoltz, '09, who is a resident
of Redlands. He is listed in the Phys
iology department and is a member
of Delta Upsilon fraternity.
A. B. Cook, '10, of Santa Barbara,
will substitute for T. Sanborn at cen
ter three-quarters, if need should
arise. Cook is a Civil Engineering
major, and is an Encina Club member.
Roth and Ilolman will be seconded
by G. D. Worswick, '13, and E. Kern,
'13. Worswick lives in San Jose and
registers as an Economics major. The
Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity claims
him as a member. Kern is a resident
of Berkeley, majoring in Economics.
He is a member of Beta Theta Pi fra
ternity.
W. I). Fletcher, '11, of Palo Alto,
will substitute for F. C. Brown at
full-back. He is an Encina Club man
and registers in the Civil Engineering
department.

Aliuoii Edward Roth Left Wing Three-quarter
Floyd Cromwell Brown Full

These are the fifteen men whom
Coach Presley has selected as the
Stanford Varsity team for 1909. The
surprises are few. Sanborn's excep
tional ability so recently demonstrated
won him a position, which necessitated
the shifting of Roth to left wing. The
latter place was the most doubtful of
the fifteen. Otherwise, the final an
nouncement merely fulfilled general
expectations. Presley will have ten
substitutes on the side-lines, although
the rules permit the use of but three.
The ten are G. McGregor, '09, H. L.
Hubbard, '12, C. E. Woodcock, '11,
.T. W. Doron, '12, J. E. Elliott, '11,
H. R. Stoltz, '09. A. 1?. Cook, '10, G. D.
Worswick, '13, E. Kern, '13, W. D.
Fletcher, '11.
M. M. Mitchell.
M. M. Mitchell, '10, of Los Angeles,
will captain the fifteen and play first
five-eights. This is Mitchell's third
season as varsity five. In 1906 he
appeared at that position on his fresh
man team. He is cool, heady, reliable,
speedy, an accurate passer and never
downed with the ball in his posses
sion. Mitchell can boast of every qual
fication essential to a Rugby back.
During the present season he has suf
fered extremely bad luck, as an in
jured shoulder kept him on the field
for more than a month. He is in per
fect shape now, however, and on both
offense and defense he will be the key
stone of the Cardinal backfield. Mit
chell weighs IC6 pounds, measures
ft., 11 in., and is 23 years old. He
majors in Economics and belongs to
she Quadrangle Club and the Zeta Psi
fraternity. Mitchell is also well
known on the diamond. As a Soph
omore he caught for the Varsity nine,
while last spring he played third base.
Horton.
H. L. Horton, '09, of Ukiah, will be
the third man in the front rank. Al
though Horton not only played on his
freshman team but also made the var
sity eleven his first year, previous to
tliis season he could not be persuaded
to become a Rugby candidate. From
the beginning he proved himself a
valuable forward, however, and now
he is as steady and reliable as any
man in the [tack. Horton possesses
an enviable reputation in track ath

letics as well as in football. In the
intercollegiate meet of 1905 he cap
tured 9 points; in 1907 he did not
compete; in 1908 he won 7 points;
and in 1909 restricted to the shot
put only by an injured leg, he took
second place in that event. Horton
has twice represented Stanford at the
Western Conference, being a point
winner in each instance. He cap
tained this year's track team. Hor
ton is a member of the Quadrangle
Club, Encina Club and Skull and
Snakes. He majors in Civil Engineer
ing, weighs 200 pounds, is 6 ft., 1
in., in height and 24 years old.
Clieda.
G. E. Cheda, '10, will be in the mid
dle position of the front rank. Than
Cheda there is no more consistent
or fiercer player on the fifteen. He
undertakes to be right on the ball
from the opening kick-off until the
final call of time. His dribbling is
clever and bis tackling unfailing and
reliable. He is always the first for
ward down on a free kick or drop
out. This will be Cheda's second
season as a member of the original
varsity team, as he played in the 1906
scrum. Also he was substituted in
the rear rank during the second half
of the 1908 intercollegiate game. He
also played with the 1910 Freshmen.
Cheda registers from San Luis Obispo
in the department of Geology and Min
ing and is a member of Encina Club.
He is 24 years of age, weighs 185
pounds and is 5 ft., BV£ in. tall.
FiHing.
Alongside of Cheda in the front
rank will be .J. W. Fitting, '10. Fit
ting has been continually ineligible
since his freshman year, when lie
played on his first-year team which
was defeated 3 to 0. Had he been
eligible, it. is probable that Fitting
would have been varsity material as
early as his Sophomore year. He is
a heavy man, tipping the scales at
190, and essentially a fighter. In the
front row he has developed into a
clever hooker and an especially strong
defensive forward. Fitting is 5 ft.,
11V 2 in.in height and 22 years of
age. He registers from San Fran
cisco in the Civil Engineering depart
ment. He belongs to Encina Club.
Fitting has also been prominent in
boating. He stroked the Varsity ibis
spring and occupied the same posi
tion on his freshman crew. He rowed
with tlie Cardinal eight against Wash
ington in 1907.
Mint urn.
L. R. Minturn, '09, will be in one
of the middle-rank positions. Min
turn has twice before participated in
a varsity game with California, play
ing lock in both 1906 and 1907. In
eligibility alone kept him off the team
last fall. He is also a star at the
old game, which he learned at Bel
mont under the tutelage of W. T.
Reid, Jr., of Harvard. Minturn was a
guard on his freshman eleven. He
is as strong as any man on the fif
teen and thoroughly understands every
trick of the forward play. He is sel
dom spectacular but always depend
able. Minturn hails from San Fran
cisco and majors in the department
of Electrical Engineering. He is 22
years old, 0 ft., IV2 in.in height and
weighs 200 pounds. He is a member
of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity.
Dole.
The second man in the middle rank
will be K. L. Dole, '11, of Riverside.
Dole played lock on his freshman
lit'teen and was placed at that posi
tion on the 1909 varsity a few days be
fore the game with California after
a close struggle for the place, which
continued throughout the season.
Dole is a continuously fierce player
who is always on top of the ball.
In securing possession on the line-out
he has 110 peer. Dole is a member of
the Heta Theta Pi fraternity and maj
ors in Systematic Botany. He is 21
years old, weighs 190 pounds and
measures H ft., 1 in. Dole has also
won bis "S" in boating. He rowed
on the 1909 varsity and the 1911
freshman crew.
Cm »lord.
111 the rear rank will be D. P.
Crawford. '09, the captain of the 190S
Varsity and probably the best Rugby
forward in North America. Experts
are unanimous in their opinion that
Crawford could win himself a position
on any fifteen in the world. His 210
pounds, coupled with his knowledge
of the game, his speed and enormous
strength, renders him indispensable
in every department of forward play.
Added to this he is a remarkable pun
ter and i)lace kicker. Crawford played
right tackle on his freshman eleven
and on the Varsity his first year.
Ineligible in 190(5, he appeared at
side rank in both 1907 and 190S, being
captain of last year's victorious fif
teen. Crawford is as famous on the
track as 011 the gridiron. in his
Sophomore year he took first place
in the shot-put in the intercollegiate
meet. The following spring he failed
to compete, while in April of this year
lie won both the hammer and shot
from California, and in June joined
with Miller in winning the individual
medals at the Conference Meet at
Chicago. Here Crawford was first in
both the weight events. He registers
from Cupertino in Civil Engineering
and is a member of Encina Club, the
Quadrangle Club and Skull and
Snakes, lie is 22 years of age and
»i ft.. 2'l-4 in.in height.
Peniberton.
J. R. Pemberton, '08, of Palo Alto,
will appear in the middle of the rear
rank. He is a powerful and dangerous
player, especially formidable in the
loose. Petuberton is always liable to

spring a sensation at any minute of
the game. He as a member of the
fifteens which won from the Blue and
Gold 6 to I], 21 to 11, and 12 to 3.
Consequently, lie will this year attain
four stars. In 1906, 1907 and 1908
Pemberton rowed 011 the varsity crew
and he also pulled an oar in the Port
land four that took second in the in
ternational regatta of 1900. Pember
ton is 6 ft., 2V 2 in. tall, weighs 190
pounds and is 20 years of age. He
registers in Geology and Mining and
belongs to Kappa Alpha and Skull and
Snakes.
Thorpe.
C. A. Thorpe, '09, will be the eighth
man in the scrum. Thorpe played
in the rear rank of the 1900 and 1907
Varsity, being ineligible in 1908. He
was also a member of the scrum of the
1910 freshman llfteen. Like Minturn,
Thorpe was a man of exceptional value
in intercollegiate football, having been
taught the game at Belmont by Reid.
In Rugby he is clever 011 both offense
and defense. He dribbles well, tack
les surely and understands every de
tail of the play of the pack. Thorpe
claims loamosa as his home. He
registers in the department of Math
ematics and belongs to Skull and
Snakes and the Beta Theta Pi fra
ternity. He measures 5 ft., 11V 2 in.,
is 23 years old and weighs ISO pounds.
Cass.
One of the two Freshmen 011 the !
fifteen will be L. Cass, who is slated
for the position of scrum half. Al
though Cass played right wing three
quarter 011 the 1913 team last month,
he received not a little practice at
half during the freshman season and
was shifted back 1o that position im
mediately after joining the varsity
squad. When Reed was injured in
the first, game with the Vancouver
fifteen, Cass replaced him and made j
good in the position at once. He pos- ,
sesses all the qualifications necessary |
for a half: speed, coolness, cleverness '
and accuracy. Cass registers from j
i,os Angeles in Economics and belongs j
to Zeta Psi. He weighs 150 pounds,
is 19 years old and 5 ft., 10 in.in
height.
S. I, Mitchell.
The second five-eights will be S.
L. Mitchell, '13, a brother of Captain
and Kirst Five-eights M. M. Mitchell.
As captain and second five of the 1913
freshman, S. L. Mitchell was the main
stay of the backfield. He was the key
stone player 011 the offense and the
most reliable man 011 defense. Im
mediately after the freshman game
with California be was placed at five
011 the Varsity, where he has since
been kept, save when injuries pre
vented him from playing. Mitchell
is only now recovering from a severe

kick, but should be in suitable con
dition by Saturday. He belongs to the
/eta Psi fraternity and majors in
Economics from Los Angeles. He is
21 years of age, weighs 180 pounds
and measures 5 ft., 10 x /> in.
Sanborn.
T. Sanborn, '12, will be the center
three-quarter. Two weeks ago San
born was not considered even as a
possibility for the Varsity. During
j the last few games of the season,
however, he was substituted at second
five and center for S. Mitchell and
Roth, respectively, and his playing
was so exceptional that the announce
ment of his success in earning a place
is anything but a surprise. Sanborn
jis fast and sturdy. In the second
! Vancouver game he seemed to have
| completely overcome his one bad tend
ency, that of holding on to the ball
j until downed. Sanborn majors in
Civil Engineering, hails from Red

years of age, weighs 102 pounds and
| measures 5 ft., 10 in.
llolmnii.
For the fourth time in as many
! years J. R. Holman, '09, of Portland,
will be the right wing three-quarter.
There is 110 speedier or more clever
; man 011 the team. In each of the three
j intercollegiate games in which be has
participated, Holman has been the
' sensational offensive player. Once
started, he is almost impossible to
stop, and his store of unexpected

isters in the department of Electrical
Engineering. He is G ft. in height,

The left wing three-quarter will
be A. E. Roth, '09. of Redlands. The
late shifting of Roth from center to

Brown.
F. C. Brown, '11, will be the full
back. Brown's sensationally spec
tacular work as full on the vanquished
1911 freshman fifteen earned him, on
the 1907 Varsity, the position of sub
stitute to Cadwalader, whom lie re
placed during the progress of the

cisco and majors in the department
of Electrical Engineering. He is 22
years old, 0 ft., IV2 in.in height and
weighs 200 pounds. He is a member
of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity.
Dole.
The second man in the middle rank
will be K. L. Dole, '11, of Riverside.
Dole played lock on his freshman
lit'teen and was placed at that posi
tion on the 1909 varsity a few days be
fore the game with California after
a close struggle for the place, which
continued throughout the season.
Dole is a continuously fierce player
who is always on top of the ball.
In securing possession on the line-out
he has 110 peer. Dole is a member of
the Heta Theta Pi fraternity and maj
ors in Systematic Botany. He is 21
years old, weighs 190 pounds and
measures H ft., 1 in. Dole has also
won bis "S" in boating. He rowed
on the 1909 varsity and the 1911
freshman crew.
Cm »lord.
111 the rear rank will be D. P.
Crawford. '09, the captain of the 190S
Varsity and probably the best Rugby
forward in North America. Experts
are unanimous in their opinion that
Crawford could win himself a position
on any fifteen in the world. His 210
pounds, coupled with his knowledge
of the game, his speed and enormous
strength, renders him indispensable
in every department of forward play.
Added to this he is a remarkable pun
ter and i)lace kicker. Crawford played
right tackle on his freshman eleven
and on the Varsity his first year.
Ineligible in 190(5, he appeared at
side rank in both 1907 and 190S, being
captain of last year's victorious fif
teen. Crawford is as famous on the
track as 011 the gridiron. in his
Sophomore year he took first place
in the shot-put in the intercollegiate
meet. The following spring he failed
to compete, while in April of this year
lie won both the hammer and shot
from California, and in June joined
with Miller in winning the individual
medals at the Conference Meet at
Chicago. Here Crawford was first in
both the weight events. He registers
from Cupertino in Civil Engineering
and is a member of Encina Club, the
Quadrangle Club and Skull and
Snakes, lie is 22 years of age and
»i ft.. 2'l-4 in.in height.
Peniberton.
J. R. Pemberton, '08, of Palo Alto,
will appear in the middle of the rear
rank. He is a powerful and dangerous
player, especially formidable in the
loose. Petuberton is always liable to

spring a sensation at any minute of
the game. He as a member of the
fifteens which won from the Blue and
Gold 6 to I], 21 to 11, and 12 to 3.
Consequently, lie will this year attain
four stars. In 1906, 1907 and 1908
Pemberton rowed 011 the varsity crew
and he also pulled an oar in the Port
land four that took second in the in
ternational regatta of 1900. Pember
ton is 6 ft., 2V 2 in. tall, weighs 190
pounds and is 20 years of age. He
registers in Geology and Mining and
belongs to Kappa Alpha and Skull and
Snakes.
Thorpe.
C. A. Thorpe, '09, will be the eighth
man in the scrum. Thorpe played
in the rear rank of the 1900 and 1907
Varsity, being ineligible in 1908. He
was also a member of the scrum of the
1910 freshman llfteen. Like Minturn,
Thorpe was a man of exceptional value
in intercollegiate football, having been
taught the game at Belmont by Reid.
In Rugby he is clever 011 both offense
and defense. He dribbles well, tack
les surely and understands every de
tail of the play of the pack. Thorpe
claims loamosa as his home. He
registers in the department of Math
ematics and belongs to Skull and
Snakes and the Beta Theta Pi fra
ternity. He measures 5 ft., 11V 2 in.,
is 23 years old and weighs ISO pounds.
Cass.
One of the two Freshmen 011 the !
fifteen will be L. Cass, who is slated
for the position of scrum half. Al
though Cass played right wing three
quarter 011 the 1913 team last month,
he received not a little practice at
half during the freshman season and
was shifted back 1o that position im
mediately after joining the varsity
squad. When Reed was injured in
the first, game with the Vancouver
fifteen, Cass replaced him and made j
good in the position at once. He pos- ,
sesses all the qualifications necessary |
for a half: speed, coolness, cleverness '
and accuracy. Cass registers from j
i,os Angeles in Economics and belongs j
to Zeta Psi. He weighs 150 pounds,
is 19 years old and 5 ft., 10 in.in
height.
S. I, Mitchell.
The second five-eights will be S.
L. Mitchell, '13, a brother of Captain
and Kirst Five-eights M. M. Mitchell.
As captain and second five of the 1913
freshman, S. L. Mitchell was the main
stay of the backfield. He was the key
stone player 011 the offense and the
most reliable man 011 defense. Im
mediately after the freshman game
with California be was placed at five
011 the Varsity, where he has since
been kept, save when injuries pre
vented him from playing. Mitchell
is only now recovering from a severe

kick, but should be in suitable con
dition by Saturday. He belongs to the
/eta Psi fraternity and majors in
Economics from Los Angeles. He is
21 years of age, weighs 180 pounds
and measures 5 ft., 10 x /> in.
Sanborn.
T. Sanborn, '12, will be the center
three-quarter. Two weeks ago San
born was not considered even as a
possibility for the Varsity. During
j the last few games of the season,
however, he was substituted at second
five and center for S. Mitchell and
Roth, respectively, and his playing
was so exceptional that the announce
ment of his success in earning a place
is anything but a surprise. Sanborn
jis fast and sturdy. In the second
! Vancouver game he seemed to have
| completely overcome his one bad tend
ency, that of holding on to the ball
j until downed. Sanborn majors in
Civil Engineering, hails from Red
lands and is a member of the Phi
Delta Theta fraternity. He is 20
years of age, weighs 102 pounds and
| measures 5 ft., 10 in.
llolmnii.
For the fourth time in as many
! years J. R. Holman, '09, of Portland,
will be the right wing three-quarter.
There is 110 speedier or more clever
; man 011 the team. In each of the three
j intercollegiate games in which be has
participated, Holman has been the
' sensational offensive player. Once
started, he is almost impossible to
stop, and his store of unexpected
"tricks of the trade" is well-nigh in
exhaustible. He knows the backfield
tactics in detail, and his coaching is
a source of constant aid to his less
experienced colleagues. Holman was
captain and quarter of the 1909
freshman eleven. On the track lie
took third place in both the sprints
j in 1907, and second place in the same
| events in 1908. Last, spring a recent
I breakdown forced him to retire shortly
'after the start of his heat in the 100.
Holman belongs to Quadrangle Club
and the /eta Psi fraternity and reg
isters in the department of Electrical
Engineering. He is G ft. in height,
weighs 102 pounds and is 22 years
old.
Itotli.
The left wing three-quarter will
be A. E. Roth, '09. of Redlands. The
late shifting of Roth from center to
wing was made in order to give San
born a position 011 the fifteen. Of the
two, Roth is the more versatile, and
accordingly lie was moved. He was
substitute on last year's varsity fifteen
and was in the original Cardinal line
up in the games with Vancouver dur
ing the Christinas holidays, when his
work was of so brilliant a nature that
from i lie first of this season he has
been a practicable certainty. Although
effective on defense, his cleverness is
more marked in advancing the ball.
Roth's swerving runs through a scat
tered lieid have been tlie prettiest bits
of play seen on Stanford Field this
fall. Injuries have kept him out of
the line-up during the past two weeks.
Roth is now Student Advisor and last
year was president of the Associated
Students. He is a member of Phi
Delta Phi, Encina Club, Quadrangle
Club and Skull and Snakes. He is
2!> years old, weighs IGS pounds and
is 5 ft., 10 in.in height.
Brown.
F. C. Brown, '11, will be the full
back. Brown's sensationally spec
tacular work as full on the vanquished
1911 freshman fifteen earned him, on
the 1907 Varsity, the position of sub
stitute to Cadwalader, whom lie re
placed during the progress of the
game. He was not registered in tlie
university last fall, but this year he
has been assured of his place from
the beginning of the season. Besides
being a long and accurate punter,
Brown is a certain tackier. No mat
ter how speedy or slippery, an oppo
nent never gets by him. Brown was
injured in Los Angeles and as a result
has been out of the game for the past
two weeks. He will be in excellent
shape for Saturday, however. Brown
hails from Selma, majors in Electri
cal Engineering and belongs to Skull
and Snakes and Encina Club. He is
5 ft., 10 in.in height, 21 years of
age and weighs 170 pounds.
The Substitutes.
G. McGregor, '09, of Benecia lias been
chosen as substitute for front rank.
He registers in the Civil Engineering
department, and is a member of En
cina Club.
The middle rank second man will be
represented by H. L. Hubbard, '12, who
majors in Economics. He lives in
Redlands and is an Encina Club mem
ber.
Two men have been listed to take
the place of injured rear rankers.
These are J. W. Doron, '12, of Carona,
and C. E. Woodcock, '11, of Portland,

Ore. Doron is a Chemistry major, and
Woodcock registers in Electrical En
gineering. Both men are members of
Encina Club.
J. E. Elliott, '11, will take the place
of Cass at half back, in case the lat
ter is hurt. Elliott, registering from
Pacific Grove, is a Geology major. He
is numbered among Encina Club mem
bers.
The positions of first and second
five-eights will be well substituted for
by 11. R. Stoltz, '09, who is a resident
of Redlands. He is listed in the Phys
iology department and is a member
of Delta Upsilon fraternity.
A. B. Cook, '10, of Santa Barbara,
will substitute for T. Sanborn at cen
ter three-quarters, if need should
arise. Cook is a Civil Engineering
major, and is an Encina Club member.
Roth and Ilolman will be seconded
by G. D. Worswick, '13, and E. Kern,
'13. Worswick lives in San Jose and
registers as an Economics major. The
Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity claims
him as a member. Kern is a resident
of Berkeley, majoring in Economics.
He is a member of Beta Theta Pi fra
ternity.
W. I). Fletcher, '11, of Palo Alto,
will substitute for F. C. Brown at
full-back. He is an Encina Club man
and registers in the Civil Engineering
department.

Aliuoii Edward Roth Left Wing Three-quarter
Floyd Cromwell Brown Full

These are the fifteen men whom
Coach Presley has selected as the
Stanford Varsity team for 1909. The
surprises are few. Sanborn's excep
tional ability so recently demonstrated
won him a position, which necessitated
the shifting of Roth to left wing. The
latter place was the most doubtful of
the fifteen. Otherwise, the final an
nouncement merely fulfilled general
expectations. Presley will have ten
substitutes on the side-lines, although
the rules permit the use of but three.
The ten are G. McGregor, '09, H. L.

.T. W. Doron, '12, J. E. Elliott, '11,
H. R. Stoltz, '09. A. 1?. Cook, '10, G. D.

Fletcher, '11.
M. M. Mitchell.
M. M. Mitchell, '10, of Los Angeles,
will captain the fifteen and play first
five-eights. This is Mitchell's third
season as varsity five. In 1906 he
appeared at that position on his fresh
man team. He is cool, heady, reliable,
speedy, an accurate passer and never
downed with the ball in his posses
sion. Mitchell can boast of every qual
fication essential to a Rugby back.
During the present season he has suf
fered extremely bad luck, as an in
jured shoulder kept him on the field
for more than a month. He is in per
fect shape now, however, and on both
offense and defense he will be the key
stone of the Cardinal backfield. Mit
chell weighs IC6 pounds, measures
ft., 11 in., and is 23 years old. He
majors in Economics and belongs to
she Quadrangle Club and the Zeta Psi
fraternity. Mitchell is also well
known on the diamond. As a Soph
omore he caught for the Varsity nine,
while last spring he played third base.
Horton.
H. L. Horton, '09, of Ukiah, will be
the third man in the front rank. Al
though Horton not only played on his
freshman team but also made the var
sity eleven his first year, previous to
tliis season he could not be persuaded
to become a Rugby candidate. From
the beginning he proved himself a
valuable forward, however, and now
he is as steady and reliable as any
man in the [tack. Horton possesses
an enviable reputation in track ath

letics as well as in football. In the
intercollegiate meet of 1905 he cap
tured 9 points; in 1907 he did not
compete; in 1908 he won 7 points;
and in 1909 restricted to the shot
put only by an injured leg, he took
second place in that event. Horton
has twice represented Stanford at the
Western Conference, being a point
winner in each instance. He cap
tained this year's track team. Hor
ton is a member of the Quadrangle
Club, Encina Club and Skull and
Snakes. He majors in Civil Engineer
ing, weighs 200 pounds, is 6 ft., 1
in., in height and 24 years old.
Clieda.
G. E. Cheda, '10, will be in the mid
dle position of the front rank. Than
Cheda there is no more consistent
or fiercer player on the fifteen. He
undertakes to be right on the ball
from the opening kick-off until the
final call of time. His dribbling is
clever and bis tackling unfailing and
reliable. He is always the first for
ward down on a free kick or drop
out. This will be Cheda's second
season as a member of the original
varsity team, as he played in the 1906
scrum. Also he was substituted in
the rear rank during the second half
of the 1908 intercollegiate game. He
also played with the 1910 Freshmen.
Cheda registers from San Luis Obispo
in the department of Geology and Min
ing and is a member of Encina Club.
He is 24 years of age, weighs 185
pounds and is 5 ft., BV£ in. tall.
FiHing.
Alongside of Cheda in the front
rank will be .J. W. Fitting, '10. Fit
ting has been continually ineligible
since his freshman year, when lie
played on his first-year team which
was defeated 3 to 0. Had he been
eligible, it. is probable that Fitting
would have been varsity material as
early as his Sophomore year. He is
a heavy man, tipping the scales at
190, and essentially a fighter. In the
front row he has developed into a
clever hooker and an especially strong
defensive forward. Fitting is 5 ft.,
11V 2 in.in height and 22 years of
age. He registers from San Fran
cisco in the Civil Engineering depart
ment. He belongs to Encina Club.
Fitting has also been prominent in
boating. He stroked the Varsity ibis
spring and occupied the same posi
tion on his freshman crew. He rowed
with tlie Cardinal eight against Wash
ington in 1907.
Mint urn.
L. R. Minturn, '09, will be in one
of the middle-rank positions. Min
turn has twice before participated in
a varsity game with California, play
ing lock in both 1906 and 1907. In
eligibility alone kept him off the team
last fall. He is also a star at the
old game, which he learned at Bel
mont under the tutelage of W. T.
Reid, Jr., of Harvard. Minturn was a
guard on his freshman eleven. He
is as strong as any man on the fif
teen and thoroughly understands every
trick of the forward play. He is sel
dom spectacular but always depend
able. Minturn hails from San Fran
cisco and majors in the department
of Electrical Engineering. He is 22
years old, 0 ft., IV2 in.in height and
weighs 200 pounds. He is a member
of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity.

The second man in the middle rank
will be K. L. Dole, '11, of Riverside.

in the rear rank of the 1900 and 1907
Varsity, being ineligible in 1908. He
was also a member of the scrum of the
1910 freshman llfteen. Like Minturn,

though Cass played right wing three
quarter 011 the 1913 team last month,
he received not a little practice at

Sanborn.
T. Sanborn, '12, will be the center
three-quarter. Two weeks ago San
born was not considered even as a
possibility for the Varsity. During
j the last few games of the season,
however, he was substituted at second
five and center for S. Mitchell and
Roth, respectively, and his playing

These are the fifteen men whom
Coach Presley has selected as the
Stanford Varsity team for 1909. The
surprises are few. Sanborn's excep
tional ability so recently demonstrated
won him a position, which necessitated
the shifting of Roth to left wing. The
latter place was the most doubtful of
the fifteen. Otherwise, the final an
nouncement merely fulfilled general
expectations. Presley will have ten
substitutes on the side-lines, although
the rules permit the use of but three.
The ten are G. McGregor, '09, H. L.
Hubbard, '12, C. E. Woodcock, '11,
.T. W. Doron, '12, J. E. Elliott, '11,
H. R. Stoltz, '09. A. 1?. Cook, '10, G. D.
Worswick, '13, E. Kern, '13, W. D.
Fletcher, '11.
M. M. Mitchell.
M. M. Mitchell, '10, of Los Angeles,
will captain the fifteen and play first
five-eights. This is Mitchell's third
season as varsity five. In 1906 he
appeared at that position on his fresh
man team. He is cool, heady, reliable,
speedy, an accurate passer and never
downed with the ball in his posses
sion. Mitchell can boast of every qual
fication essential to a Rugby back.
During the present season he has suf
fered extremely bad luck, as an in
jured shoulder kept him on the field
for more than a month. He is in per
fect shape now, however, and on both
offense and defense he will be the key
stone of the Cardinal backfield. Mit
chell weighs IC6 pounds, measures
ft., 11 in., and is 23 years old. He
majors in Economics and belongs to
she Quadrangle Club and the Zeta Psi
fraternity. Mitchell is also well
known on the diamond. As a Soph
omore he caught for the Varsity nine,
while last spring he played third base.
Horton.
H. L. Horton, '09, of Ukiah, will be
the third man in the front rank. Al
though Horton not only played on his
freshman team but also made the var
sity eleven his first year, previous to
tliis season he could not be persuaded
to become a Rugby candidate. From
the beginning he proved himself a
valuable forward, however, and now
he is as steady and reliable as any
man in the [tack. Horton possesses
an enviable reputation in track ath

letics as well as in football. In the
intercollegiate meet of 1905 he cap
tured 9 points; in 1907 he did not
compete; in 1908 he won 7 points;
and in 1909 restricted to the shot
put only by an injured leg, he took
second place in that event. Horton
has twice represented Stanford at the
Western Conference, being a point
winner in each instance. He cap
tained this year's track team. Hor
ton is a member of the Quadrangle
Club, Encina Club and Skull and
Snakes. He majors in Civil Engineer
ing, weighs 200 pounds, is 6 ft., 1
in., in height and 24 years old.
Clieda.
G. E. Cheda, '10, will be in the mid
dle position of the front rank. Than
Cheda there is no more consistent
or fiercer player on the fifteen. He
undertakes to be right on the ball
from the opening kick-off until the
final call of time. His dribbling is
clever and bis tackling unfailing and
reliable. He is always the first for
ward down on a free kick or drop
out. This will be Cheda's second
season as a member of the original
varsity team, as he played in the 1906
scrum. Also he was substituted in
the rear rank during the second half
of the 1908 intercollegiate game. He
also played with the 1910 Freshmen.
Cheda registers from San Luis Obispo
in the department of Geology and Min
ing and is a member of Encina Club.
He is 24 years of age, weighs 185
pounds and is 5 ft., BV£ in. tall.
FiHing.
Alongside of Cheda in the front
rank will be .J. W. Fitting, '10. Fit
ting has been continually ineligible
since his freshman year, when lie
played on his first-year team which
was defeated 3 to 0. Had he been
eligible, it. is probable that Fitting
would have been varsity material as
early as his Sophomore year. He is
a heavy man, tipping the scales at
190, and essentially a fighter. In the
front row he has developed into a
clever hooker and an especially strong
defensive forward. Fitting is 5 ft.,
11V 2 in.in height and 22 years of
age. He registers from San Fran
cisco in the Civil Engineering depart
ment. He belongs to Encina Club.
Fitting has also been prominent in
boating. He stroked the Varsity ibis
spring and occupied the same posi
tion on his freshman crew. He rowed
with tlie Cardinal eight against Wash
ington in 1907.
Mint urn.
L. R. Minturn, '09, will be in one
of the middle-rank positions. Min
turn has twice before participated in
a varsity game with California, play
ing lock in both 1906 and 1907. In
eligibility alone kept him off the team
last fall. He is also a star at the
old game, which he learned at Bel
mont under the tutelage of W. T.
Reid, Jr., of Harvard. Minturn was a
guard on his freshman eleven. He
is as strong as any man on the fif
teen and thoroughly understands every
trick of the forward play. He is sel
dom spectacular but always depend
able. Minturn hails from San Fran
cisco and majors in the department
of Electrical Engineering. He is 22
years old, 0 ft., IV2 in.in height and
weighs 200 pounds. He is a member
of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity.
Dole.
The second man in the middle rank
will be K. L. Dole, '11, of Riverside.
Dole played lock on his freshman
lit'teen and was placed at that posi
tion on the 1909 varsity a few days be
fore the game with California after
a close struggle for the place, which
continued throughout the season.
Dole is a continuously fierce player
who is always on top of the ball.
In securing possession on the line-out
he has 110 peer. Dole is a member of
the Heta Theta Pi fraternity and maj
ors in Systematic Botany. He is 21
years old, weighs 190 pounds and
measures H ft., 1 in. Dole has also
won bis "S" in boating. He rowed
on the 1909 varsity and the 1911
freshman crew.
Cm »lord.
111 the rear rank will be D. P.
Crawford. '09, the captain of the 190S
Varsity and probably the best Rugby
forward in North America. Experts
are unanimous in their opinion that
Crawford could win himself a position
on any fifteen in the world. His 210
pounds, coupled with his knowledge
of the game, his speed and enormous
strength, renders him indispensable
in every department of forward play.
Added to this he is a remarkable pun
ter and i)lace kicker. Crawford played
right tackle on his freshman eleven
and on the Varsity his first year.
Ineligible in 190(5, he appeared at
side rank in both 1907 and 190S, being
captain of last year's victorious fif
teen. Crawford is as famous on the
track as 011 the gridiron. in his
Sophomore year he took first place
in the shot-put in the intercollegiate
meet. The following spring he failed
to compete, while in April of this year
lie won both the hammer and shot
from California, and in June joined
with Miller in winning the individual
medals at the Conference Meet at
Chicago. Here Crawford was first in
both the weight events. He registers
from Cupertino in Civil Engineering
and is a member of Encina Club, the
Quadrangle Club and Skull and
Snakes, lie is 22 years of age and
»i ft.. 2'l-4 in.in height.
Peniberton.
J. R. Pemberton, '08, of Palo Alto,
will appear in the middle of the rear
rank. He is a powerful and dangerous
player, especially formidable in the
loose. Petuberton is always liable to

spring a sensation at any minute of
the game. He as a member of the
fifteens which won from the Blue and
Gold 6 to I], 21 to 11, and 12 to 3.
Consequently, lie will this year attain
four stars. In 1906, 1907 and 1908
Pemberton rowed 011 the varsity crew
and he also pulled an oar in the Port
land four that took second in the in
ternational regatta of 1900. Pember
ton is 6 ft., 2V 2 in. tall, weighs 190
pounds and is 20 years of age. He
registers in Geology and Mining and
belongs to Kappa Alpha and Skull and
Snakes.
Thorpe.
C. A. Thorpe, '09, will be the eighth
man in the scrum. Thorpe played
in the rear rank of the 1900 and 1907
Varsity, being ineligible in 1908. He
was also a member of the scrum of the
1910 freshman llfteen. Like Minturn,
Thorpe was a man of exceptional value
in intercollegiate football, having been
taught the game at Belmont by Reid.
In Rugby he is clever 011 both offense
and defense. He dribbles well, tack
les surely and understands every de
tail of the play of the pack. Thorpe
claims loamosa as his home. He
registers in the department of Math
ematics and belongs to Skull and
Snakes and the Beta Theta Pi fra
ternity. He measures 5 ft., 11V 2 in.,
is 23 years old and weighs ISO pounds.
Cass.
One of the two Freshmen 011 the !
fifteen will be L. Cass, who is slated
for the position of scrum half. Al
though Cass played right wing three
quarter 011 the 1913 team last month,
he received not a little practice at
half during the freshman season and
was shifted back 1o that position im
mediately after joining the varsity
squad. When Reed was injured in
the first, game with the Vancouver
fifteen, Cass replaced him and made j
good in the position at once. He pos- ,
sesses all the qualifications necessary |
for a half: speed, coolness, cleverness '
and accuracy. Cass registers from j
i,os Angeles in Economics and belongs j
to Zeta Psi. He weighs 150 pounds,
is 19 years old and 5 ft., 10 in.in
height.
S. I, Mitchell.
The second five-eights will be S.
L. Mitchell, '13, a brother of Captain
and Kirst Five-eights M. M. Mitchell.
As captain and second five of the 1913
freshman, S. L. Mitchell was the main
stay of the backfield. He was the key
stone player 011 the offense and the
most reliable man 011 defense. Im
mediately after the freshman game
with California be was placed at five
011 the Varsity, where he has since
been kept, save when injuries pre
vented him from playing. Mitchell
is only now recovering from a severe

kick, but should be in suitable con
dition by Saturday. He belongs to the
/eta Psi fraternity and majors in
Economics from Los Angeles. He is
21 years of age, weighs 180 pounds
and measures 5 ft., 10 x /> in.
Sanborn.
T. Sanborn, '12, will be the center
three-quarter. Two weeks ago San
born was not considered even as a
possibility for the Varsity. During
j the last few games of the season,
however, he was substituted at second
five and center for S. Mitchell and
Roth, respectively, and his playing
was so exceptional that the announce
ment of his success in earning a place
is anything but a surprise. Sanborn
jis fast and sturdy. In the second
! Vancouver game he seemed to have
| completely overcome his one bad tend
ency, that of holding on to the ball
j until downed. Sanborn majors in
Civil Engineering, hails from Red
lands and is a member of the Phi
Delta Theta fraternity. He is 20
years of age, weighs 102 pounds and
| measures 5 ft., 10 in.
llolmnii.
For the fourth time in as many
! years J. R. Holman, '09, of Portland,
will be the right wing three-quarter.
There is 110 speedier or more clever
; man 011 the team. In each of the three
j intercollegiate games in which be has
participated, Holman has been the
' sensational offensive player. Once
started, he is almost impossible to
stop, and his store of unexpected
"tricks of the trade" is well-nigh in
exhaustible. He knows the backfield
tactics in detail, and his coaching is
a source of constant aid to his less
experienced colleagues. Holman was
captain and quarter of the 1909
freshman eleven. On the track lie
took third place in both the sprints
j in 1907, and second place in the same
| events in 1908. Last, spring a recent
I breakdown forced him to retire shortly
'after the start of his heat in the 100.
Holman belongs to Quadrangle Club
and the /eta Psi fraternity and reg
isters in the department of Electrical
Engineering. He is G ft. in height,
weighs 102 pounds and is 22 years
old.
Itotli.
The left wing three-quarter will
be A. E. Roth, '09. of Redlands. The
late shifting of Roth from center to
wing was made in order to give San
born a position 011 the fifteen. Of the
two, Roth is the more versatile, and
accordingly lie was moved. He was
substitute on last year's varsity fifteen
and was in the original Cardinal line
up in the games with Vancouver dur
ing the Christinas holidays, when his
work was of so brilliant a nature that
from i lie first of this season he has
been a practicable certainty. Although
effective on defense, his cleverness is
more marked in advancing the ball.
Roth's swerving runs through a scat
tered lieid have been tlie prettiest bits
of play seen on Stanford Field this
fall. Injuries have kept him out of
the line-up during the past two weeks.
Roth is now Student Advisor and last
year was president of the Associated
Students. He is a member of Phi
Delta Phi, Encina Club, Quadrangle
Club and Skull and Snakes. He is
2!> years old, weighs IGS pounds and
is 5 ft., 10 in.in height.
Brown.
F. C. Brown, '11, will be the full
back. Brown's sensationally spec
tacular work as full on the vanquished
1911 freshman fifteen earned him, on
the 1907 Varsity, the position of sub
stitute to Cadwalader, whom lie re
placed during the progress of the
game. He was not registered in tlie
university last fall, but this year he
has been assured of his place from
the beginning of the season. Besides
being a long and accurate punter,
Brown is a certain tackier. No mat
ter how speedy or slippery, an oppo
nent never gets by him. Brown was
injured in Los Angeles and as a result
has been out of the game for the past
two weeks. He will be in excellent
shape for Saturday, however. Brown
hails from Selma, majors in Electri
cal Engineering and belongs to Skull
and Snakes and Encina Club. He is
5 ft., 10 in.in height, 21 years of
age and weighs 170 pounds.
The Substitutes.
G. McGregor, '09, of Benecia lias been
chosen as substitute for front rank.
He registers in the Civil Engineering
department, and is a member of En
cina Club.
The middle rank second man will be
represented by H. L. Hubbard, '12, who
majors in Economics. He lives in
Redlands and is an Encina Club mem
ber.
Two men have been listed to take
the place of injured rear rankers.
These are J. W. Doron, '12, of Carona,
and C. E. Woodcock, '11, of Portland,

Ore. Doron is a Chemistry major, and
Woodcock registers in Electrical En
gineering. Both men are members of
Encina Club.
J. E. Elliott, '11, will take the place
of Cass at half back, in case the lat
ter is hurt. Elliott, registering from
Pacific Grove, is a Geology major. He
is numbered among Encina Club mem
bers.
The positions of first and second
five-eights will be well substituted for
by 11. R. Stoltz, '09, who is a resident
of Redlands. He is listed in the Phys
iology department and is a member
of Delta Upsilon fraternity.
A. B. Cook, '10, of Santa Barbara,
will substitute for T. Sanborn at cen
ter three-quarters, if need should
arise. Cook is a Civil Engineering
major, and is an Encina Club member.
Roth and Ilolman will be seconded
by G. D. Worswick, '13, and E. Kern,
'13. Worswick lives in San Jose and
registers as an Economics major. The
Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity claims
him as a member. Kern is a resident
of Berkeley, majoring in Economics.
He is a member of Beta Theta Pi fra
ternity.
W. I). Fletcher, '11, of Palo Alto,
will substitute for F. C. Brown at
full-back. He is an Encina Club man
and registers in the Civil Engineering
department.

jis fast and sturdy. In the second
! Vancouver game he seemed to have
| completely overcome his one bad tend
ency, that of holding on to the ball
j until downed. Sanborn majors in
Civil Engineering, hails from Red
lands and is a member of the Phi
Delta Theta fraternity. He is 20
years of age, weighs 102 pounds and
| measures 5 ft., 10 in.
llolmnii.
For the fourth time in as many
! years J. R. Holman, '09, of Portland,
will be the right wing three-quarter.
There is 110 speedier or more clever
; man 011 the team. In each of the three
j intercollegiate games in which be has
participated, Holman has been the
' sensational offensive player. Once
started, he is almost impossible to
stop, and his store of unexpected
"tricks of the trade" is well-nigh in
exhaustible. He knows the backfield
tactics in detail, and his coaching is
a source of constant aid to his less
experienced colleagues. Holman was
captain and quarter of the 1909
freshman eleven. On the track lie
took third place in both the sprints
j in 1907, and second place in the same
| events in 1908. Last, spring a recent
I breakdown forced him to retire shortly
'after the start of his heat in the 100.
Holman belongs to Quadrangle Club
and the /eta Psi fraternity and reg
isters in the department of Electrical
Engineering. He is G ft. in height,
weighs 102 pounds and is 22 years
old.
Itotli.
The left wing three-quarter will
be A. E. Roth, '09. of Redlands. The
late shifting of Roth from center to
wing was made in order to give San
born a position 011 the fifteen. Of the
two, Roth is the more versatile, and
accordingly lie was moved. He was
substitute on last year's varsity fifteen
and was in the original Cardinal line
up in the games with Vancouver dur
ing the Christinas holidays, when his
work was of so brilliant a nature that
from i lie first of this season he has
been a practicable certainty. Although
effective on defense, his cleverness is
more marked in advancing the ball.
Roth's swerving runs through a scat
tered lieid have been tlie prettiest bits
of play seen on Stanford Field this
fall. Injuries have kept him out of
the line-up during the past two weeks.
Roth is now Student Advisor and last
year was president of the Associated
Students. He is a member of Phi
Delta Phi, Encina Club, Quadrangle
Club and Skull and Snakes. He is
2!> years old, weighs IGS pounds and
is 5 ft., 10 in.in height.
Brown.
F. C. Brown, '11, will be the full
back. Brown's sensationally spec
tacular work as full on the vanquished
1911 freshman fifteen earned him, on
the 1907 Varsity, the position of sub
stitute to Cadwalader, whom lie re
placed during the progress of the
game. He was not registered in tlie
university last fall, but this year he
has been assured of his place from
the beginning of the season. Besides
being a long and accurate punter,
Brown is a certain tackier. No mat
ter how speedy or slippery, an oppo
nent never gets by him. Brown was
injured in Los Angeles and as a result
has been out of the game for the past
two weeks. He will be in excellent
shape for Saturday, however. Brown
hails from Selma, majors in Electri
cal Engineering and belongs to Skull
and Snakes and Encina Club. He is
5 ft., 10 in.in height, 21 years of
age and weighs 170 pounds.
The Substitutes.
G. McGregor, '09, of Benecia lias been
chosen as substitute for front rank.
He registers in the Civil Engineering
department, and is a member of En
cina Club.
The middle rank second man will be
represented by H. L. Hubbard, '12, who
majors in Economics. He lives in
Redlands and is an Encina Club mem
ber.
Two men have been listed to take
the place of injured rear rankers.
These are J. W. Doron, '12, of Carona,
and C. E. Woodcock, '11, of Portland,

Ore. Doron is a Chemistry major, and
Woodcock registers in Electrical En
gineering. Both men are members of
Encina Club.
J. E. Elliott, '11, will take the place
of Cass at half back, in case the lat
ter is hurt. Elliott, registering from
Pacific Grove, is a Geology major. He
is numbered among Encina Club mem
bers.
The positions of first and second
five-eights will be well substituted for
by 11. R. Stoltz, '09, who is a resident
of Redlands. He is listed in the Phys
iology department and is a member
of Delta Upsilon fraternity.
A. B. Cook, '10, of Santa Barbara,
will substitute for T. Sanborn at cen
ter three-quarters, if need should
arise. Cook is a Civil Engineering
major, and is an Encina Club member.
Roth and Ilolman will be seconded
by G. D. Worswick, '13, and E. Kern,
'13. Worswick lives in San Jose and
registers as an Economics major. The
Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity claims
him as a member. Kern is a resident
of Berkeley, majoring in Economics.
He is a member of Beta Theta Pi fra
ternity.
W. I). Fletcher, '11, of Palo Alto,
will substitute for F. C. Brown at
full-back. He is an Encina Club man
and registers in the Civil Engineering
department.

Aliuoii Edward Roth Left Wing Three-quarter
Floyd Cromwell Brown Full

These are the fifteen men whom
Coach Presley has selected as the
Stanford Varsity team for 1909. The
surprises are few. Sanborn's excep
tional ability so recently demonstrated
won him a position, which necessitated
the shifting of Roth to left wing. The
latter place was the most doubtful of
the fifteen. Otherwise, the final an
nouncement merely fulfilled general
expectations. Presley will have ten
substitutes on the side-lines, although
the rules permit the use of but three.
The ten are G. McGregor, '09, H. L.

.T. W. Doron, '12, J. E. Elliott, '11,
H. R. Stoltz, '09. A. 1?. Cook, '10, G. D.

Fletcher, '11.
M. M. Mitchell.
M. M. Mitchell, '10, of Los Angeles,
will captain the fifteen and play first
five-eights. This is Mitchell's third
season as varsity five. In 1906 he
appeared at that position on his fresh
man team. He is cool, heady, reliable,
speedy, an accurate passer and never
downed with the ball in his posses
sion. Mitchell can boast of every qual
fication essential to a Rugby back.
During the present season he has suf
fered extremely bad luck, as an in
jured shoulder kept him on the field
for more than a month. He is in per
fect shape now, however, and on both
offense and defense he will be the key
stone of the Cardinal backfield. Mit
chell weighs IC6 pounds, measures
ft., 11 in., and is 23 years old. He
majors in Economics and belongs to
she Quadrangle Club and the Zeta Psi
fraternity. Mitchell is also well
known on the diamond. As a Soph
omore he caught for the Varsity nine,
while last spring he played third base.
Horton.
H. L. Horton, '09, of Ukiah, will be
the third man in the front rank. Al
though Horton not only played on his
freshman team but also made the var
sity eleven his first year, previous to
tliis season he could not be persuaded
to become a Rugby candidate. From
the beginning he proved himself a
valuable forward, however, and now
he is as steady and reliable as any
man in the [tack. Horton possesses
an enviable reputation in track ath

letics as well as in football. In the
intercollegiate meet of 1905 he cap
tured 9 points; in 1907 he did not
compete; in 1908 he won 7 points;
and in 1909 restricted to the shot
put only by an injured leg, he took
second place in that event. Horton
has twice represented Stanford at the
Western Conference, being a point
winner in each instance. He cap
tained this year's track team. Hor
ton is a member of the Quadrangle
Club, Encina Club and Skull and
Snakes. He majors in Civil Engineer
ing, weighs 200 pounds, is 6 ft., 1
in., in height and 24 years old.
Clieda.
G. E. Cheda, '10, will be in the mid
dle position of the front rank. Than
Cheda there is no more consistent
or fiercer player on the fifteen. He
undertakes to be right on the ball
from the opening kick-off until the
final call of time. His dribbling is
clever and bis tackling unfailing and
reliable. He is always the first for
ward down on a free kick or drop
out. This will be Cheda's second
season as a member of the original
varsity team, as he played in the 1906
scrum. Also he was substituted in
the rear rank during the second half
of the 1908 intercollegiate game. He
also played with the 1910 Freshmen.
Cheda registers from San Luis Obispo
in the department of Geology and Min
ing and is a member of Encina Club.
He is 24 years of age, weighs 185
pounds and is 5 ft., BV£ in. tall.
FiHing.
Alongside of Cheda in the front
rank will be .J. W. Fitting, '10. Fit
ting has been continually ineligible
since his freshman year, when lie
played on his first-year team which
was defeated 3 to 0. Had he been
eligible, it. is probable that Fitting
would have been varsity material as
early as his Sophomore year. He is
a heavy man, tipping the scales at
190, and essentially a fighter. In the
front row he has developed into a
clever hooker and an especially strong
defensive forward. Fitting is 5 ft.,
11V 2 in.in height and 22 years of
age. He registers from San Fran
cisco in the Civil Engineering depart
ment. He belongs to Encina Club.
Fitting has also been prominent in
boating. He stroked the Varsity ibis
spring and occupied the same posi
tion on his freshman crew. He rowed
with tlie Cardinal eight against Wash
ington in 1907.
Mint urn.
L. R. Minturn, '09, will be in one
of the middle-rank positions. Min
turn has twice before participated in
a varsity game with California, play
ing lock in both 1906 and 1907. In
eligibility alone kept him off the team
last fall. He is also a star at the
old game, which he learned at Bel
mont under the tutelage of W. T.
Reid, Jr., of Harvard. Minturn was a
guard on his freshman eleven. He
is as strong as any man on the fif
teen and thoroughly understands every
trick of the forward play. He is sel
dom spectacular but always depend
able. Minturn hails from San Fran
cisco and majors in the department
of Electrical Engineering. He is 22
years old, 0 ft., IV2 in.in height and
weighs 200 pounds. He is a member
of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity.
Dole.
The second man in the middle rank
will be K. L. Dole, '11, of Riverside.
Dole played lock on his freshman
lit'teen and was placed at that posi
tion on the 1909 varsity a few days be
fore the game with California after
a close struggle for the place, which
continued throughout the season.
Dole is a continuously fierce player
who is always on top of the ball.
In securing possession on the line-out
he has 110 peer. Dole is a member of
the Heta Theta Pi fraternity and maj
ors in Systematic Botany. He is 21
years old, weighs 190 pounds and
measures H ft., 1 in. Dole has also
won bis "S" in boating. He rowed
on the 1909 varsity and the 1911
freshman crew.
Cm »lord.
111 the rear rank will be D. P.
Crawford. '09, the captain of the 190S
Varsity and probably the best Rugby
forward in North America. Experts
are unanimous in their opinion that
Crawford could win himself a position
on any fifteen in the world. His 210
pounds, coupled with his knowledge
of the game, his speed and enormous
strength, renders him indispensable
in every department of forward play.
Added to this he is a remarkable pun
ter and i)lace kicker. Crawford played
right tackle on his freshman eleven
and on the Varsity his first year.
Ineligible in 190(5, he appeared at
side rank in both 1907 and 190S, being
captain of last year's victorious fif
teen. Crawford is as famous on the
track as 011 the gridiron. in his
Sophomore year he took first place
in the shot-put in the intercollegiate
meet. The following spring he failed
to compete, while in April of this year
lie won both the hammer and shot
from California, and in June joined
with Miller in winning the individual
medals at the Conference Meet at
Chicago. Here Crawford was first in
both the weight events. He registers
from Cupertino in Civil Engineering
and is a member of Encina Club, the
Quadrangle Club and Skull and
Snakes, lie is 22 years of age and
»i ft.. 2'l-4 in.in height.
Peniberton.
J. R. Pemberton, '08, of Palo Alto,
will appear in the middle of the rear
rank. He is a powerful and dangerous
player, especially formidable in the
loose. Petuberton is always liable to

spring a sensation at any minute of
the game. He as a member of the
fifteens which won from the Blue and
Gold 6 to I], 21 to 11, and 12 to 3.
Consequently, lie will this year attain
four stars. In 1906, 1907 and 1908
Pemberton rowed 011 the varsity crew
and he also pulled an oar in the Port
land four that took second in the in
ternational regatta of 1900. Pember
ton is 6 ft., 2V 2 in. tall, weighs 190
pounds and is 20 years of age. He
registers in Geology and Mining and
belongs to Kappa Alpha and Skull and
Snakes.
Thorpe.
C. A. Thorpe, '09, will be the eighth
man in the scrum. Thorpe played
in the rear rank of the 1900 and 1907
Varsity, being ineligible in 1908. He
was also a member of the scrum of the
1910 freshman llfteen. Like Minturn,
Thorpe was a man of exceptional value
in intercollegiate football, having been
taught the game at Belmont by Reid.
In Rugby he is clever 011 both offense
and defense. He dribbles well, tack
les surely and understands every de
tail of the play of the pack. Thorpe
claims loamosa as his home. He
registers in the department of Math
ematics and belongs to Skull and
Snakes and the Beta Theta Pi fra
ternity. He measures 5 ft., 11V 2 in.,
is 23 years old and weighs ISO pounds.
Cass.
One of the two Freshmen 011 the !
fifteen will be L. Cass, who is slated
for the position of scrum half. Al
though Cass played right wing three
quarter 011 the 1913 team last month,
he received not a little practice at
half during the freshman season and
was shifted back 1o that position im
mediately after joining the varsity
squad. When Reed was injured in
the first, game with the Vancouver
fifteen, Cass replaced him and made j
good in the position at once. He pos- ,
sesses all the qualifications necessary |
for a half: speed, coolness, cleverness '
and accuracy. Cass registers from j
i,os Angeles in Economics and belongs j
to Zeta Psi. He weighs 150 pounds,
is 19 years old and 5 ft., 10 in.in
height.
S. I, Mitchell.
The second five-eights will be S.
L. Mitchell, '13, a brother of Captain
and Kirst Five-eights M. M. Mitchell.
As captain and second five of the 1913
freshman, S. L. Mitchell was the main
stay of the backfield. He was the key
stone player 011 the offense and the
most reliable man 011 defense. Im
mediately after the freshman game
with California be was placed at five
011 the Varsity, where he has since
been kept, save when injuries pre
vented him from playing. Mitchell
is only now recovering from a severe

kick, but should be in suitable con
dition by Saturday. He belongs to the
/eta Psi fraternity and majors in
Economics from Los Angeles. He is
21 years of age, weighs 180 pounds
and measures 5 ft., 10 x /> in.
Sanborn.
T. Sanborn, '12, will be the center
three-quarter. Two weeks ago San
born was not considered even as a
possibility for the Varsity. During
j the last few games of the season,
however, he was substituted at second
five and center for S. Mitchell and
Roth, respectively, and his playing
was so exceptional that the announce
ment of his success in earning a place
is anything but a surprise. Sanborn
jis fast and sturdy. In the second
! Vancouver game he seemed to have
| completely overcome his one bad tend
ency, that of holding on to the ball
j until downed. Sanborn majors in
Civil Engineering, hails from Red
lands and is a member of the Phi
Delta Theta fraternity. He is 20
years of age, weighs 102 pounds and
| measures 5 ft., 10 in.
llolmnii.
For the fourth time in as many
! years J. R. Holman, '09, of Portland,
will be the right wing three-quarter.
There is 110 speedier or more clever
; man 011 the team. In each of the three
j intercollegiate games in which be has
participated, Holman has been the
' sensational offensive player. Once
started, he is almost impossible to
stop, and his store of unexpected
"tricks of the trade" is well-nigh in

I breakdown forced him to retire shortly
'after the start of his heat in the 100.
Holman belongs to Quadrangle Club

Brown.
F. C. Brown, '11, will be the full
back. Brown's sensationally spec
tacular work as full on the vanquished
1911 freshman fifteen earned him, on
the 1907 Varsity, the position of sub
stitute to Cadwalader, whom lie re

tion on the 1909 varsity a few days be
fore the game with California after
a close struggle for the place, which
continued throughout the season.
Dole is a continuously fierce player
who is always on top of the ball.
In securing possession on the line-out
he has 110 peer. Dole is a member of
the Heta Theta Pi fraternity and maj
ors in Systematic Botany. He is 21
years old, weighs 190 pounds and
measures H ft., 1 in. Dole has also
won bis "S" in boating. He rowed
on the 1909 varsity and the 1911
freshman crew.
Cm »lord.
111 the rear rank will be D. P.
Crawford. '09, the captain of the 190S
Varsity and probably the best Rugby
forward in North America. Experts
are unanimous in their opinion that
Crawford could win himself a position
on any fifteen in the world. His 210
pounds, coupled with his knowledge
of the game, his speed and enormous
strength, renders him indispensable
in every department of forward play.
Added to this he is a remarkable pun
ter and i)lace kicker. Crawford played
right tackle on his freshman eleven
and on the Varsity his first year.
Ineligible in 190(5, he appeared at
side rank in both 1907 and 190S, being
captain of last year's victorious fif
teen. Crawford is as famous on the
track as 011 the gridiron. in his
Sophomore year he took first place
in the shot-put in the intercollegiate
meet. The following spring he failed
to compete, while in April of this year
lie won both the hammer and shot
from California, and in June joined
with Miller in winning the individual
medals at the Conference Meet at
Chicago. Here Crawford was first in
both the weight events. He registers
from Cupertino in Civil Engineering
and is a member of Encina Club, the
Quadrangle Club and Skull and
Snakes, lie is 22 years of age and
»i ft.. 2'l-4 in.in height.
Peniberton.
J. R. Pemberton, '08, of Palo Alto,
will appear in the middle of the rear
rank. He is a powerful and dangerous
player, especially formidable in the
loose. Petuberton is always liable to

spring a sensation at any minute of
the game. He as a member of the
fifteens which won from the Blue and
Gold 6 to I], 21 to 11, and 12 to 3.
Consequently, lie will this year attain
four stars. In 1906, 1907 and 1908
Pemberton rowed 011 the varsity crew
and he also pulled an oar in the Port
land four that took second in the in
ternational regatta of 1900. Pember
ton is 6 ft., 2V 2 in. tall, weighs 190
pounds and is 20 years of age. He
registers in Geology and Mining and
belongs to Kappa Alpha and Skull and
Snakes.
Thorpe.
C. A. Thorpe, '09, will be the eighth
man in the scrum. Thorpe played
in the rear rank of the 1900 and 1907
Varsity, being ineligible in 1908. He
was also a member of the scrum of the
1910 freshman llfteen. Like Minturn,
Thorpe was a man of exceptional value
in intercollegiate football, having been
taught the game at Belmont by Reid.
In Rugby he is clever 011 both offense
and defense. He dribbles well, tack
les surely and understands every de
tail of the play of the pack. Thorpe
claims loamosa as his home. He
registers in the department of Math
ematics and belongs to Skull and
Snakes and the Beta Theta Pi fra
ternity. He measures 5 ft., 11V 2 in.,
is 23 years old and weighs ISO pounds.
Cass.
One of the two Freshmen 011 the !
fifteen will be L. Cass, who is slated
for the position of scrum half. Al
though Cass played right wing three
quarter 011 the 1913 team last month,
he received not a little practice at
half during the freshman season and
was shifted back 1o that position im
mediately after joining the varsity
squad. When Reed was injured in
the first, game with the Vancouver
fifteen, Cass replaced him and made j
good in the position at once. He pos- ,
sesses all the qualifications necessary |
for a half: speed, coolness, cleverness '
and accuracy. Cass registers from j
i,os Angeles in Economics and belongs j
to Zeta Psi. He weighs 150 pounds,
is 19 years old and 5 ft., 10 in.in
height.
S. I, Mitchell.
The second five-eights will be S.
L. Mitchell, '13, a brother of Captain
and Kirst Five-eights M. M. Mitchell.
As captain and second five of the 1913
freshman, S. L. Mitchell was the main
stay of the backfield. He was the key
stone player 011 the offense and the
most reliable man 011 defense. Im
mediately after the freshman game
with California be was placed at five
011 the Varsity, where he has since
been kept, save when injuries pre
vented him from playing. Mitchell
is only now recovering from a severe

kick, but should be in suitable con
dition by Saturday. He belongs to the
/eta Psi fraternity and majors in
Economics from Los Angeles. He is
21 years of age, weighs 180 pounds
and measures 5 ft., 10 x /> in.
Sanborn.
T. Sanborn, '12, will be the center
three-quarter. Two weeks ago San
born was not considered even as a
possibility for the Varsity. During
j the last few games of the season,
however, he was substituted at second
five and center for S. Mitchell and
Roth, respectively, and his playing
was so exceptional that the announce
ment of his success in earning a place
is anything but a surprise. Sanborn
jis fast and sturdy. In the second
! Vancouver game he seemed to have
| completely overcome his one bad tend
ency, that of holding on to the ball
j until downed. Sanborn majors in
Civil Engineering, hails from Red
lands and is a member of the Phi
Delta Theta fraternity. He is 20
years of age, weighs 102 pounds and
| measures 5 ft., 10 in.
llolmnii.
For the fourth time in as many
! years J. R. Holman, '09, of Portland,
will be the right wing three-quarter.
There is 110 speedier or more clever
; man 011 the team. In each of the three
j intercollegiate games in which be has
participated, Holman has been the
' sensational offensive player. Once
started, he is almost impossible to
stop, and his store of unexpected
"tricks of the trade" is well-nigh in
exhaustible. He knows the backfield
tactics in detail, and his coaching is
a source of constant aid to his less
experienced colleagues. Holman was
captain and quarter of the 1909
freshman eleven. On the track lie
took third place in both the sprints
j in 1907, and second place in the same
| events in 1908. Last, spring a recent
I breakdown forced him to retire shortly
'after the start of his heat in the 100.
Holman belongs to Quadrangle Club
and the /eta Psi fraternity and reg
isters in the department of Electrical
Engineering. He is G ft. in height,
weighs 102 pounds and is 22 years
old.
Itotli.
The left wing three-quarter will
be A. E. Roth, '09. of Redlands. The
late shifting of Roth from center to
wing was made in order to give San
born a position 011 the fifteen. Of the
two, Roth is the more versatile, and
accordingly lie was moved. He was
substitute on last year's varsity fifteen
and was in the original Cardinal line
up in the games with Vancouver dur
ing the Christinas holidays, when his
work was of so brilliant a nature that
from i lie first of this season he has
been a practicable certainty. Although
effective on defense, his cleverness is
more marked in advancing the ball.
Roth's swerving runs through a scat
tered lieid have been tlie prettiest bits
of play seen on Stanford Field this
fall. Injuries have kept him out of
the line-up during the past two weeks.
Roth is now Student Advisor and last
year was president of the Associated
Students. He is a member of Phi
Delta Phi, Encina Club, Quadrangle
Club and Skull and Snakes. He is
2!> years old, weighs IGS pounds and
is 5 ft., 10 in.in height.
Brown.
F. C. Brown, '11, will be the full
back. Brown's sensationally spec
tacular work as full on the vanquished
1911 freshman fifteen earned him, on
the 1907 Varsity, the position of sub
stitute to Cadwalader, whom lie re
placed during the progress of the
game. He was not registered in tlie
university last fall, but this year he
has been assured of his place from
the beginning of the season. Besides
being a long and accurate punter,
Brown is a certain tackier. No mat
ter how speedy or slippery, an oppo
nent never gets by him. Brown was
injured in Los Angeles and as a result
has been out of the game for the past
two weeks. He will be in excellent
shape for Saturday, however. Brown
hails from Selma, majors in Electri
cal Engineering and belongs to Skull
and Snakes and Encina Club. He is
5 ft., 10 in.in height, 21 years of
age and weighs 170 pounds.
The Substitutes.
G. McGregor, '09, of Benecia lias been
chosen as substitute for front rank.
He registers in the Civil Engineering
department, and is a member of En
cina Club.
The middle rank second man will be
represented by H. L. Hubbard, '12, who
majors in Economics. He lives in
Redlands and is an Encina Club mem
ber.
Two men have been listed to take
the place of injured rear rankers.
These are J. W. Doron, '12, of Carona,
and C. E. Woodcock, '11, of Portland,

Ore. Doron is a Chemistry major, and
Woodcock registers in Electrical En
gineering. Both men are members of
Encina Club.
J. E. Elliott, '11, will take the place
of Cass at half back, in case the lat
ter is hurt. Elliott, registering from
Pacific Grove, is a Geology major. He
is numbered among Encina Club mem
bers.
The positions of first and second
five-eights will be well substituted for
by 11. R. Stoltz, '09, who is a resident
of Redlands. He is listed in the Phys
iology department and is a member
of Delta Upsilon fraternity.
A. B. Cook, '10, of Santa Barbara,
will substitute for T. Sanborn at cen
ter three-quarters, if need should
arise. Cook is a Civil Engineering
major, and is an Encina Club member.
Roth and Ilolman will be seconded
by G. D. Worswick, '13, and E. Kern,
'13. Worswick lives in San Jose and
registers as an Economics major. The
Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity claims
him as a member. Kern is a resident
of Berkeley, majoring in Economics.
He is a member of Beta Theta Pi fra
ternity.
W. I). Fletcher, '11, of Palo Alto,
will substitute for F. C. Brown at
full-back. He is an Encina Club man
and registers in the Civil Engineering
department.

John Raymond Holnian Right Wing Three-quarter
Aliuoii Edward Roth Left Wing Three-quarter
Floyd Cromwell Brown Full

These are the fifteen men whom
Coach Presley has selected as the
Stanford Varsity team for 1909. The
surprises are few. Sanborn's excep
tional ability so recently demonstrated
won him a position, which necessitated
the shifting of Roth to left wing. The
latter place was the most doubtful of
the fifteen. Otherwise, the final an
nouncement merely fulfilled general
expectations. Presley will have ten
substitutes on the side-lines, although
the rules permit the use of but three.
The ten are G. McGregor, '09, H. L.
Hubbard, '12, C. E. Woodcock, '11,
.T. W. Doron, '12, J. E. Elliott, '11,
H. R. Stoltz, '09. A. 1?. Cook, '10, G. D.
Worswick, '13, E. Kern, '13, W. D.
Fletcher, '11.
M. M. Mitchell.
M. M. Mitchell, '10, of Los Angeles,
will captain the fifteen and play first
five-eights. This is Mitchell's third
season as varsity five. In 1906 he
appeared at that position on his fresh
man team. He is cool, heady, reliable,
speedy, an accurate passer and never
downed with the ball in his posses
sion. Mitchell can boast of every qual
fication essential to a Rugby back.
During the present season he has suf
fered extremely bad luck, as an in
jured shoulder kept him on the field
for more than a month. He is in per
fect shape now, however, and on both
offense and defense he will be the key
stone of the Cardinal backfield. Mit
chell weighs IC6 pounds, measures
ft., 11 in., and is 23 years old. He
majors in Economics and belongs to
she Quadrangle Club and the Zeta Psi
fraternity. Mitchell is also well
known on the diamond. As a Soph
omore he caught for the Varsity nine,
while last spring he played third base.
Horton.
H. L. Horton, '09, of Ukiah, will be
the third man in the front rank. Al
though Horton not only played on his
freshman team but also made the var
sity eleven his first year, previous to
tliis season he could not be persuaded
to become a Rugby candidate. From
the beginning he proved himself a
valuable forward, however, and now
he is as steady and reliable as any
man in the [tack. Horton possesses
an enviable reputation in track ath

letics as well as in football. In the
intercollegiate meet of 1905 he cap
tured 9 points; in 1907 he did not
compete; in 1908 he won 7 points;
and in 1909 restricted to the shot
put only by an injured leg, he took
second place in that event. Horton
has twice represented Stanford at the
Western Conference, being a point
winner in each instance. He cap
tained this year's track team. Hor
ton is a member of the Quadrangle
Club, Encina Club and Skull and
Snakes. He majors in Civil Engineer
ing, weighs 200 pounds, is 6 ft., 1
in., in height and 24 years old.
Clieda.
G. E. Cheda, '10, will be in the mid
dle position of the front rank. Than
Cheda there is no more consistent
or fiercer player on the fifteen. He
undertakes to be right on the ball
from the opening kick-off until the
final call of time. His dribbling is
clever and bis tackling unfailing and
reliable. He is always the first for
ward down on a free kick or drop
out. This will be Cheda's second
season as a member of the original
varsity team, as he played in the 1906
scrum. Also he was substituted in
the rear rank during the second half
of the 1908 intercollegiate game. He
also played with the 1910 Freshmen.
Cheda registers from San Luis Obispo
in the department of Geology and Min
ing and is a member of Encina Club.
He is 24 years of age, weighs 185
pounds and is 5 ft., BV£ in. tall.
FiHing.
Alongside of Cheda in the front
rank will be .J. W. Fitting, '10. Fit
ting has been continually ineligible
since his freshman year, when lie
played on his first-year team which
was defeated 3 to 0. Had he been
eligible, it. is probable that Fitting
would have been varsity material as
early as his Sophomore year. He is
a heavy man, tipping the scales at
190, and essentially a fighter. In the
front row he has developed into a
clever hooker and an especially strong
defensive forward. Fitting is 5 ft.,
11V 2 in.in height and 22 years of
age. He registers from San Fran
cisco in the Civil Engineering depart
ment. He belongs to Encina Club.
Fitting has also been prominent in
boating. He stroked the Varsity ibis
spring and occupied the same posi
tion on his freshman crew. He rowed
with tlie Cardinal eight against Wash
ington in 1907.
Mint urn.
L. R. Minturn, '09, will be in one
of the middle-rank positions. Min
turn has twice before participated in
a varsity game with California, play
ing lock in both 1906 and 1907. In
eligibility alone kept him off the team
last fall. He is also a star at the
old game, which he learned at Bel
mont under the tutelage of W. T.
Reid, Jr., of Harvard. Minturn was a
guard on his freshman eleven. He
is as strong as any man on the fif
teen and thoroughly understands every
trick of the forward play. He is sel
dom spectacular but always depend
able. Minturn hails from San Fran
cisco and majors in the department
of Electrical Engineering. He is 22
years old, 0 ft., IV2 in.in height and
weighs 200 pounds. He is a member
of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity.
Dole.
The second man in the middle rank
will be K. L. Dole, '11, of Riverside.
Dole played lock on his freshman

a close struggle for the place, which
continued throughout the season.
Dole is a continuously fierce player

though Cass played right wing three
quarter 011 the 1913 team last month,
he received not a little practice at

Economics from Los Angeles. He is
21 years of age, weighs 180 pounds

Sanborn.
T. Sanborn, '12, will be the center
three-quarter. Two weeks ago San
born was not considered even as a
possibility for the Varsity. During
j the last few games of the season,
however, he was substituted at second
five and center for S. Mitchell and
Roth, respectively, and his playing

tional ability so recently demonstrated
won him a position, which necessitated
the shifting of Roth to left wing. The
latter place was the most doubtful of
the fifteen. Otherwise, the final an
nouncement merely fulfilled general
expectations. Presley will have ten
substitutes on the side-lines, although
the rules permit the use of but three.
The ten are G. McGregor, '09, H. L.
Hubbard, '12, C. E. Woodcock, '11,
.T. W. Doron, '12, J. E. Elliott, '11,
H. R. Stoltz, '09. A. 1?. Cook, '10, G. D.
Worswick, '13, E. Kern, '13, W. D.
Fletcher, '11.
M. M. Mitchell.
M. M. Mitchell, '10, of Los Angeles,
will captain the fifteen and play first
five-eights. This is Mitchell's third
season as varsity five. In 1906 he
appeared at that position on his fresh
man team. He is cool, heady, reliable,
speedy, an accurate passer and never
downed with the ball in his posses
sion. Mitchell can boast of every qual
fication essential to a Rugby back.
During the present season he has suf
fered extremely bad luck, as an in
jured shoulder kept him on the field
for more than a month. He is in per
fect shape now, however, and on both
offense and defense he will be the key
stone of the Cardinal backfield. Mit
chell weighs IC6 pounds, measures
ft., 11 in., and is 23 years old. He
majors in Economics and belongs to
she Quadrangle Club and the Zeta Psi
fraternity. Mitchell is also well
known on the diamond. As a Soph
omore he caught for the Varsity nine,
while last spring he played third base.
Horton.
H. L. Horton, '09, of Ukiah, will be
the third man in the front rank. Al
though Horton not only played on his
freshman team but also made the var
sity eleven his first year, previous to
tliis season he could not be persuaded
to become a Rugby candidate. From
the beginning he proved himself a
valuable forward, however, and now
he is as steady and reliable as any
man in the [tack. Horton possesses
an enviable reputation in track ath

letics as well as in football. In the
intercollegiate meet of 1905 he cap
tured 9 points; in 1907 he did not
compete; in 1908 he won 7 points;
and in 1909 restricted to the shot
put only by an injured leg, he took
second place in that event. Horton
has twice represented Stanford at the
Western Conference, being a point
winner in each instance. He cap
tained this year's track team. Hor
ton is a member of the Quadrangle
Club, Encina Club and Skull and
Snakes. He majors in Civil Engineer
ing, weighs 200 pounds, is 6 ft., 1
in., in height and 24 years old.
Clieda.
G. E. Cheda, '10, will be in the mid
dle position of the front rank. Than
Cheda there is no more consistent
or fiercer player on the fifteen. He
undertakes to be right on the ball
from the opening kick-off until the
final call of time. His dribbling is
clever and bis tackling unfailing and
reliable. He is always the first for
ward down on a free kick or drop
out. This will be Cheda's second
season as a member of the original
varsity team, as he played in the 1906
scrum. Also he was substituted in
the rear rank during the second half
of the 1908 intercollegiate game. He
also played with the 1910 Freshmen.
Cheda registers from San Luis Obispo
in the department of Geology and Min
ing and is a member of Encina Club.
He is 24 years of age, weighs 185
pounds and is 5 ft., BV£ in. tall.
FiHing.
Alongside of Cheda in the front
rank will be .J. W. Fitting, '10. Fit
ting has been continually ineligible
since his freshman year, when lie
played on his first-year team which
was defeated 3 to 0. Had he been
eligible, it. is probable that Fitting
would have been varsity material as
early as his Sophomore year. He is
a heavy man, tipping the scales at
190, and essentially a fighter. In the
front row he has developed into a
clever hooker and an especially strong
defensive forward. Fitting is 5 ft.,
11V 2 in.in height and 22 years of
age. He registers from San Fran
cisco in the Civil Engineering depart
ment. He belongs to Encina Club.
Fitting has also been prominent in
boating. He stroked the Varsity ibis
spring and occupied the same posi
tion on his freshman crew. He rowed
with tlie Cardinal eight against Wash
ington in 1907.
Mint urn.
L. R. Minturn, '09, will be in one
of the middle-rank positions. Min
turn has twice before participated in
a varsity game with California, play
ing lock in both 1906 and 1907. In
eligibility alone kept him off the team
last fall. He is also a star at the
old game, which he learned at Bel
mont under the tutelage of W. T.
Reid, Jr., of Harvard. Minturn was a
guard on his freshman eleven. He
is as strong as any man on the fif
teen and thoroughly understands every
trick of the forward play. He is sel
dom spectacular but always depend
able. Minturn hails from San Fran
cisco and majors in the department
of Electrical Engineering. He is 22
years old, 0 ft., IV2 in.in height and
weighs 200 pounds. He is a member
of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity.
Dole.
The second man in the middle rank
will be K. L. Dole, '11, of Riverside.
Dole played lock on his freshman
lit'teen and was placed at that posi
tion on the 1909 varsity a few days be
fore the game with California after
a close struggle for the place, which
continued throughout the season.
Dole is a continuously fierce player
who is always on top of the ball.
In securing possession on the line-out
he has 110 peer. Dole is a member of
the Heta Theta Pi fraternity and maj
ors in Systematic Botany. He is 21
years old, weighs 190 pounds and
measures H ft., 1 in. Dole has also
won bis "S" in boating. He rowed
on the 1909 varsity and the 1911
freshman crew.
Cm »lord.
111 the rear rank will be D. P.
Crawford. '09, the captain of the 190S
Varsity and probably the best Rugby
forward in North America. Experts
are unanimous in their opinion that
Crawford could win himself a position
on any fifteen in the world. His 210
pounds, coupled with his knowledge
of the game, his speed and enormous
strength, renders him indispensable
in every department of forward play.
Added to this he is a remarkable pun
ter and i)lace kicker. Crawford played
right tackle on his freshman eleven
and on the Varsity his first year.
Ineligible in 190(5, he appeared at
side rank in both 1907 and 190S, being
captain of last year's victorious fif
teen. Crawford is as famous on the
track as 011 the gridiron. in his
Sophomore year he took first place
in the shot-put in the intercollegiate
meet. The following spring he failed
to compete, while in April of this year
lie won both the hammer and shot
from California, and in June joined
with Miller in winning the individual
medals at the Conference Meet at
Chicago. Here Crawford was first in
both the weight events. He registers
from Cupertino in Civil Engineering
and is a member of Encina Club, the
Quadrangle Club and Skull and
Snakes, lie is 22 years of age and
»i ft.. 2'l-4 in.in height.
Peniberton.
J. R. Pemberton, '08, of Palo Alto,
will appear in the middle of the rear
rank. He is a powerful and dangerous
player, especially formidable in the
loose. Petuberton is always liable to

spring a sensation at any minute of
the game. He as a member of the
fifteens which won from the Blue and
Gold 6 to I], 21 to 11, and 12 to 3.
Consequently, lie will this year attain
four stars. In 1906, 1907 and 1908
Pemberton rowed 011 the varsity crew
and he also pulled an oar in the Port
land four that took second in the in
ternational regatta of 1900. Pember
ton is 6 ft., 2V 2 in. tall, weighs 190
pounds and is 20 years of age. He
registers in Geology and Mining and
belongs to Kappa Alpha and Skull and
Snakes.
Thorpe.
C. A. Thorpe, '09, will be the eighth
man in the scrum. Thorpe played
in the rear rank of the 1900 and 1907
Varsity, being ineligible in 1908. He
was also a member of the scrum of the
1910 freshman llfteen. Like Minturn,
Thorpe was a man of exceptional value
in intercollegiate football, having been
taught the game at Belmont by Reid.
In Rugby he is clever 011 both offense
and defense. He dribbles well, tack
les surely and understands every de
tail of the play of the pack. Thorpe
claims loamosa as his home. He
registers in the department of Math
ematics and belongs to Skull and
Snakes and the Beta Theta Pi fra
ternity. He measures 5 ft., 11V 2 in.,
is 23 years old and weighs ISO pounds.
Cass.
One of the two Freshmen 011 the !
fifteen will be L. Cass, who is slated
for the position of scrum half. Al
though Cass played right wing three
quarter 011 the 1913 team last month,
he received not a little practice at
half during the freshman season and
was shifted back 1o that position im
mediately after joining the varsity
squad. When Reed was injured in
the first, game with the Vancouver
fifteen, Cass replaced him and made j
good in the position at once. He pos- ,
sesses all the qualifications necessary |
for a half: speed, coolness, cleverness '
and accuracy. Cass registers from j
i,os Angeles in Economics and belongs j
to Zeta Psi. He weighs 150 pounds,
is 19 years old and 5 ft., 10 in.in
height.
S. I, Mitchell.
The second five-eights will be S.
L. Mitchell, '13, a brother of Captain
and Kirst Five-eights M. M. Mitchell.
As captain and second five of the 1913
freshman, S. L. Mitchell was the main
stay of the backfield. He was the key
stone player 011 the offense and the
most reliable man 011 defense. Im
mediately after the freshman game
with California be was placed at five
011 the Varsity, where he has since
been kept, save when injuries pre
vented him from playing. Mitchell
is only now recovering from a severe

kick, but should be in suitable con
dition by Saturday. He belongs to the
/eta Psi fraternity and majors in
Economics from Los Angeles. He is
21 years of age, weighs 180 pounds
and measures 5 ft., 10 x /> in.
Sanborn.
T. Sanborn, '12, will be the center
three-quarter. Two weeks ago San
born was not considered even as a
possibility for the Varsity. During
j the last few games of the season,
however, he was substituted at second
five and center for S. Mitchell and
Roth, respectively, and his playing
was so exceptional that the announce
ment of his success in earning a place
is anything but a surprise. Sanborn
jis fast and sturdy. In the second
! Vancouver game he seemed to have
| completely overcome his one bad tend
ency, that of holding on to the ball
j until downed. Sanborn majors in
Civil Engineering, hails from Red
lands and is a member of the Phi
Delta Theta fraternity. He is 20
years of age, weighs 102 pounds and
| measures 5 ft., 10 in.
llolmnii.
For the fourth time in as many
! years J. R. Holman, '09, of Portland,
will be the right wing three-quarter.
There is 110 speedier or more clever
; man 011 the team. In each of the three
j intercollegiate games in which be has
participated, Holman has been the
' sensational offensive player. Once
started, he is almost impossible to
stop, and his store of unexpected
"tricks of the trade" is well-nigh in
exhaustible. He knows the backfield
tactics in detail, and his coaching is
a source of constant aid to his less
experienced colleagues. Holman was
captain and quarter of the 1909
freshman eleven. On the track lie
took third place in both the sprints
j in 1907, and second place in the same
| events in 1908. Last, spring a recent
I breakdown forced him to retire shortly
'after the start of his heat in the 100.
Holman belongs to Quadrangle Club
and the /eta Psi fraternity and reg
isters in the department of Electrical
Engineering. He is G ft. in height,
weighs 102 pounds and is 22 years
old.
Itotli.
The left wing three-quarter will
be A. E. Roth, '09. of Redlands. The
late shifting of Roth from center to
wing was made in order to give San
born a position 011 the fifteen. Of the
two, Roth is the more versatile, and
accordingly lie was moved. He was
substitute on last year's varsity fifteen
and was in the original Cardinal line
up in the games with Vancouver dur
ing the Christinas holidays, when his
work was of so brilliant a nature that
from i lie first of this season he has
been a practicable certainty. Although
effective on defense, his cleverness is
more marked in advancing the ball.
Roth's swerving runs through a scat
tered lieid have been tlie prettiest bits
of play seen on Stanford Field this
fall. Injuries have kept him out of
the line-up during the past two weeks.
Roth is now Student Advisor and last
year was president of the Associated
Students. He is a member of Phi
Delta Phi, Encina Club, Quadrangle
Club and Skull and Snakes. He is
2!> years old, weighs IGS pounds and
is 5 ft., 10 in.in height.
Brown.
F. C. Brown, '11, will be the full
back. Brown's sensationally spec
tacular work as full on the vanquished
1911 freshman fifteen earned him, on
the 1907 Varsity, the position of sub
stitute to Cadwalader, whom lie re
placed during the progress of the
game. He was not registered in tlie
university last fall, but this year he
has been assured of his place from
the beginning of the season. Besides
being a long and accurate punter,
Brown is a certain tackier. No mat
ter how speedy or slippery, an oppo
nent never gets by him. Brown was
injured in Los Angeles and as a result
has been out of the game for the past
two weeks. He will be in excellent
shape for Saturday, however. Brown
hails from Selma, majors in Electri
cal Engineering and belongs to Skull
and Snakes and Encina Club. He is
5 ft., 10 in.in height, 21 years of
age and weighs 170 pounds.
The Substitutes.
G. McGregor, '09, of Benecia lias been
chosen as substitute for front rank.
He registers in the Civil Engineering
department, and is a member of En
cina Club.
The middle rank second man will be
represented by H. L. Hubbard, '12, who
majors in Economics. He lives in
Redlands and is an Encina Club mem
ber.
Two men have been listed to take
the place of injured rear rankers.
These are J. W. Doron, '12, of Carona,

Ore. Doron is a Chemistry major, and
Woodcock registers in Electrical En
gineering. Both men are members of
Encina Club.

of Cass at half back, in case the lat
ter is hurt. Elliott, registering from
Pacific Grove, is a Geology major. He
is numbered among Encina Club mem
bers.
The positions of first and second
five-eights will be well substituted for
by 11. R. Stoltz, '09, who is a resident
of Redlands. He is listed in the Phys
iology department and is a member
of Delta Upsilon fraternity.
A. B. Cook, '10, of Santa Barbara,
will substitute for T. Sanborn at cen
ter three-quarters, if need should
arise. Cook is a Civil Engineering
major, and is an Encina Club member.
Roth and Ilolman will be seconded
by G. D. Worswick, '13, and E. Kern,
'13. Worswick lives in San Jose and
registers as an Economics major. The
Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity claims
him as a member. Kern is a resident
of Berkeley, majoring in Economics.
He is a member of Beta Theta Pi fra
ternity.
