These are the fifteen men whom
Coach Presley has selected as the
Stanford Varsity team for 1909. The
surprises are few. Sanborn's excep
tional ability so recently demonstrated
won him a position, which necessitated
the shifting of Roth to left wing. The
latter place was the most doubtful of
the fifteen. Otherwise, the final an
nouncement merely fulfilled general
expectations. Presley will have ten
substitutes on the side-lines, although
the rules permit the use of but three.
The ten are G. McGregor, '09, H. L.
Hubbard, '12, C. E. Woodcock, '11,
.T. W. Doron, '12, J. E. Elliott, '11,
H. R. Stoltz, '09. A. 1?. Cook, '10, G. D.
Worswick, '13, E. Kern, '13, W. D.
Fletcher, '11.
M. M. Mitchell.
M. M. Mitchell, '10, of Los Angeles,
will captain the fifteen and play first
five-eights. This is Mitchell's third
season as varsity five. In 1906 he
appeared at that position on his fresh
man team. He is cool, heady, reliable,
speedy, an accurate passer and never
downed with the ball in his posses
sion. Mitchell can boast of every qual
fication essential to a Rugby back.
During the present season he has suf
fered extremely bad luck, as an in
jured shoulder kept him on the field
for more than a month. He is in per
fect shape now, however, and on both
offense and defense he will be the key
stone of the Cardinal backfield. Mit
chell weighs IC6 pounds, measures
ft., 11 in., and is 23 years old. He
majors in Economics and belongs to
she Quadrangle Club and the Zeta Psi
fraternity. Mitchell is also well
known on the diamond. As a Soph
omore he caught for the Varsity nine,
while last spring he played third base.
Horton.
H. L. Horton, '09, of Ukiah, will be
the third man in the front rank. Al
though Horton not only played on his
freshman team but also made the var
sity eleven his first year, previous to
tliis season he could not be persuaded
to become a Rugby candidate. From
the beginning he proved himself a
valuable forward, however, and now
he is as steady and reliable as any
man in the [tack. Horton possesses
an enviable reputation in track ath

letics as well as in football. In the
intercollegiate meet of 1905 he cap
tured 9 points; in 1907 he did not
compete; in 1908 he won 7 points;
and in 1909 restricted to the shot
put only by an injured leg, he took
second place in that event. Horton
has twice represented Stanford at the
Western Conference, being a point
winner in each instance. He cap
tained this year's track team. Hor
ton is a member of the Quadrangle
Club, Encina Club and Skull and
Snakes. He majors in Civil Engineer
ing, weighs 200 pounds, is 6 ft., 1
in., in height and 24 years old.
Clieda.
G. E. Cheda, '10, will be in the mid
dle position of the front rank. Than
Cheda there is no more consistent
or fiercer player on the fifteen. He
undertakes to be right on the ball
from the opening kick-off until the
final call of time. His dribbling is
clever and bis tackling unfailing and
reliable. He is always the first for
ward down on a free kick or drop
out. This will be Cheda's second
season as a member of the original
varsity team, as he played in the 1906
scrum. Also he was substituted in
the rear rank during the second half
of the 1908 intercollegiate game. He
also played with the 1910 Freshmen.
Cheda registers from San Luis Obispo
in the department of Geology and Min
ing and is a member of Encina Club.
He is 24 years of age, weighs 185
pounds and is 5 ft., BVÂ£ in. tall.
FiHing.
Alongside of Cheda in the front
rank will be .J. W. Fitting, '10. Fit
ting has been continually ineligible
since his freshman year, when lie
played on his first-year team which
was defeated 3 to 0. Had he been
eligible, it. is probable that Fitting
would have been varsity material as
early as his Sophomore year. He is
a heavy man, tipping the scales at
190, and essentially a fighter. In the
front row he has developed into a
clever hooker and an especially strong
defensive forward. Fitting is 5 ft.,
11V 2 in.in height and 22 years of
age. He registers from San Fran
cisco in the Civil Engineering depart
