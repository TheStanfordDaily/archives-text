# GIVES FINE PROGRAM
## SOUSA PLEASES AUDIENCE IN ASSEMBLY HALL. Band Renders Excellent Concert, Showing Perfect Organization. Gives Many Encores. 
### 
In spite of the inclemency of the
weather last evening, a large and en
thusiastic audience turned out to hear
Sousa's Hand. The Assembly Hall
was packed except for a few seats in
the front ot' the house.
The evening opened with a "Medi
tation on Sacred Melodies" by Sousa.
Although this did not differ materially
from the general run of such potpor
ris, yet the slow movements gave the
audience an excellent idea of the won
derful tone quality of the band. As
encore the well-known "El Capitan"
was played. The second number was
a cornet solo by Mr. Herbert L. Clark,
"Showers of Gold." Mr. Clark's play
ing needs no comment; he is the solo
cornetist, perfect in tone and tech
nique.
The fifth selection, by Racliminoff
was probably the linest single bit of
the evening.
Further numbers were by Tschai
kowsly, Bizet, Sousa, Gounod and
Friedman. Miss Florence Hardemann
gave a brilliant and callable rendition
of the Gounod-Alard "Fantisie on
Romeo and Juliet." As encores she
played the MacDowell "Wild Rose"
and a "Hungarian Dance." Her play
ing throughout was marked by bril
liant execution and excellent tone to
gether with mature interpretation.
The program was well chosen, and
the Band and its leader as perfect as
it is possible for such an organization
to be. It was a decided musical treat
for a Stanford audience.
