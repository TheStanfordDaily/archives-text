Tomorrow will decide the outcome
of an intercollegiate Rugby contest:
either one game more will lie added
to the long line of Stanford's victories
or California will serpentine at the
first varsity game in seven years.
Every indication is that the strug
gle will be close and the victory a
narrow one.
In the fifteen men who will wear
the Cardinal we have entire confi
dence. Perfectly trained and careful
ly coached, the team is prepared for
a battle to the end, and the result will
be a Stanford victory. Put do not
minimize the efficiency of our oppo
nents. The team will need every bit
of support which can be accorded it.
The responsibility for the outcome of
the game rests no less upon the
bleachers than upon the team. It is
for each individual to do his share in
the rooting section. Buck up the yd!
leaders ami net behind the team.
