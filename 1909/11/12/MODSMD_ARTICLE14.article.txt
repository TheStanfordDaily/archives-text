The outcome of the game tomor
row will be justification for a cele
bration on the part of the student
body. But in the jollification and en
thusiasm which will follow a Stan
ford victory it will he well for each
individual to remember that loyalty
to hi- university should prevent this
celebration from taking a form which
oversteps the bounds of respectability
or gentlemanliness. Stronger than
any university regulation should be
the spirit of regard for the name or
the university.
