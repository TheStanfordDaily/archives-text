# RALLY IS SPIRITED
## UNSURPASSED ENTHUSIASM IS FEATURE OF RALLY. Large and Frantic Crowd Packs Assembly Hall at Final Send-off to Varsity. 
### 
With every sent filled find it large
number of fanatics utilizing the uisles
for standing room, the Cardinal var
sity fifteen and substitutes accom
panied by Coach Presley and Trainer
Moult on were accorded a prolonged
and lustily vociferous greeting as they
entered Assembly Hall last evening
on tlie occasion of the annual Rugby
rally. The undergraduates, packed in
the orchestra seats, yelled themselves
hoarse, while the young women
launched paper streamers from the
balcony, which encircled and entwined
the men as they marched down to their
front-row seats with "Dad" Mouiton
at their head. The noise continued
long, and quiet was at last restored
only to allow the frenzied roters an
opportunity for even more frenzied
shouting, as the varsity heroes were
cheered, one by one. In the midst of
the ovation to (he team, the rising
of the curtain disclosed the familial
red banner upon which are inscribed
the oft-repeated legend, "Stanford
wins again." This was a signal tor
the rooters to double their already
frantic noise.
In accordance with tlie previous ar
rangement, red fire in generous
amounts was burned before the be
ginning of the rally, and the spas
modic- shouting that accompanied this
merely put tbe undergraduates in a
proper humor for the largest, best ami
most enthusiastic football rally ever
held at Stanford.
The speeches of the evening were
made by Coach Presley. Trainer Moui
ton. Professor F. C. Woodward, Dean
of the Law School. "Champ" Craw
ford, '06, the record-breaking hammer
thrower, and "Babe" Burnett, '00. a
former varsity center-rush.
"Dad" Mouiton said, in part:
"It is almost impossible to get fif-
teen men into really perfect condition.
Two are now slightly lame, but the
team, as a whole, is in good shape,
ami its staying powers are better than
any other team that has ever played
for Stanford. Thanks are due the
substitutes for their line work. More
men remained out until the end of the
season than ever before."
Profesosr Woodward spoke as fol
lows:
"Once more we are 011 the eve of
Berkeley's annual funeral. With live
successive victories and an unblem
ished record for sportsmanlike con
duct, the past is secure. We entrust
the immediate future to these fifteen
men . Do not mind the hard luck and
injuries you have had. There is some
thing more than that —fighting spirit.
Stanford has at least one tradition,
and that is that a Stanford man fights
to the very last ditch. I saw my first
Rugby intercollegiate game two years
ago. In the second half of that game
the realization was brought to me that
Stanford had developed a fighting
spirit never surpassed by any Univer
sity in the country. We expect the
men Saturday to maintain Stanford
ideals. They have had the best
coaching in the land. They have been
trained by an incomparable trainer.
The second team has served faithful
ly. it is now up to the fifteen men.
They will play as true sportsmen play
and will fight as Stanford men have
fought before them. If they so play,
we shall be proud of them; if they so
fight, they shall most certainly win."
Crawford said in part:
"Out. in the world 1 have heard that
the Stanford Spirit is dead, but on
coming back here, 112 found that it was
just as much alive as ever. Satur
day's game is going to be a hard fight,

I but the harder the fight, the greater
the glory. 1 do not see how you can
lose, and while you are wining, we
will ail be behind you."
Burnett concluded with the follow
j ing remarks:
"Players come and players go, but
the Stanford Spirit goes 011 forever.
With this, with a fine coach, witli a
fine trainer, you can not lose. Next
Saturday, if you are true to Stanford
ideals and traditions, you are going to
| win that game just as sure as you are
sitting there."
Coach Pressley, who was the final
speaker, said:
"1 want to thank (lie second (cam.
They have worked harder than any
bunch of fellows I have ever seen.
The game is going to be the hardest
i one we have ever had. .'Dad' Moulton
has the men in perfect condition, and
they are prepared to tight two forty
minute halves to the very end."
The rally concluded with a parting
injunction by Trainer Moulton, who
warned the student body to preserve
quiet and give the men 011 the team
I a chance for a good sleep Friday night.
To the tune of a stirring march
rendered by the band the undergrad
uates then serpentined the inner quad
and soon proceeded to the baseball
field, where the tremendous bonfire
erected by the freshmen was already
emitting huge flames. The seemingly
endless serpentine of yelling students
continued to circle the blaze until the
tall structure fell tottering in a dy
j ing heap.

"Once more we are 011 the eve of
Berkeley's annual funeral. With live
successive victories and an unblem
ished record for sportsmanlike con
duct, the past is secure. We entrust
the immediate future to these fifteen
men . Do not mind the hard luck and
injuries you have had. There is some
thing more than that —fighting spirit.
Stanford has at least one tradition,
and that is that a Stanford man fights
to the very last ditch. I saw my first
Rugby intercollegiate game two years
ago. In the second half of that game
the realization was brought to me that
Stanford had developed a fighting
spirit never surpassed by any Univer
sity in the country. We expect the
men Saturday to maintain Stanford
ideals. They have had the best
coaching in the land. They have been
trained by an incomparable trainer.
The second team has served faithful
ly. it is now up to the fifteen men.
They will play as true sportsmen play
and will fight as Stanford men have
fought before them. If they so play,
we shall be proud of them; if they so
fight, they shall most certainly win."
Crawford said in part:
"Out. in the world 1 have heard that
the Stanford Spirit is dead, but on
coming back here, 112 found that it was
just as much alive as ever. Satur
day's game is going to be a hard fight,

I but the harder the fight, the greater
the glory. 1 do not see how you can
lose, and while you are wining, we
will ail be behind you."
Burnett concluded with the follow
j ing remarks:
"Players come and players go, but
the Stanford Spirit goes 011 forever.
With this, with a fine coach, witli a
fine trainer, you can not lose. Next
Saturday, if you are true to Stanford
ideals and traditions, you are going to
| win that game just as sure as you are
sitting there."
Coach Pressley, who was the final
speaker, said:
"1 want to thank (lie second (cam.
They have worked harder than any
bunch of fellows I have ever seen.
The game is going to be the hardest
i one we have ever had. .'Dad' Moulton
has the men in perfect condition, and
they are prepared to tight two forty
minute halves to the very end."
The rally concluded with a parting
injunction by Trainer Moulton, who
warned the student body to preserve
quiet and give the men 011 the team
I a chance for a good sleep Friday night.
To the tune of a stirring march
rendered by the band the undergrad
uates then serpentined the inner quad
and soon proceeded to the baseball
field, where the tremendous bonfire
erected by the freshmen was already
emitting huge flames. The seemingly
endless serpentine of yelling students
continued to circle the blaze until the
tall structure fell tottering in a dy
j ing heap.
With every sent filled find it large
number of fanatics utilizing the uisles
for standing room, the Cardinal var
sity fifteen and substitutes accom
panied by Coach Presley and Trainer
Moult on were accorded a prolonged
and lustily vociferous greeting as they
entered Assembly Hall last evening
on tlie occasion of the annual Rugby
rally. The undergraduates, packed in
the orchestra seats, yelled themselves
hoarse, while the young women
launched paper streamers from the
balcony, which encircled and entwined
the men as they marched down to their
front-row seats with "Dad" Mouiton
at their head. The noise continued
long, and quiet was at last restored
only to allow the frenzied roters an
opportunity for even more frenzied
shouting, as the varsity heroes were
cheered, one by one. In the midst of
the ovation to (he team, the rising
of the curtain disclosed the familial
red banner upon which are inscribed
the oft-repeated legend, "Stanford
wins again." This was a signal tor
the rooters to double their already
frantic noise.
In accordance with tlie previous ar
rangement, red fire in generous
amounts was burned before the be
ginning of the rally, and the spas
modic- shouting that accompanied this
merely put tbe undergraduates in a
proper humor for the largest, best ami
most enthusiastic football rally ever
held at Stanford.
The speeches of the evening were
made by Coach Presley. Trainer Moui
ton. Professor F. C. Woodward, Dean
of the Law School. "Champ" Craw
ford, '06, the record-breaking hammer
thrower, and "Babe" Burnett, '00. a
former varsity center-rush.
"Dad" Mouiton said, in part:
"It is almost impossible to get fif-
teen men into really perfect condition.
Two are now slightly lame, but the
team, as a whole, is in good shape,
ami its staying powers are better than
any other team that has ever played
for Stanford. Thanks are due the
substitutes for their line work. More
men remained out until the end of the
season than ever before."
