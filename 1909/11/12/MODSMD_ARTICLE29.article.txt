## LARGEST SOUVENIR PROGRAM TO BE SOLD TOMORROW. Student Body Enterprise Managed by Walker and Thompson Promises to Set Mark. 
### 
In keeping with the game, which is
expected to be one of the best and
largest attended in history, the sou
venir programs that will be placed
011 the bleachers tomorrow are in a
class by themselves. The books pre
sent a striking appearance. Printed
011 heavy white stock with a poster
front page by Stuart Macdonald '10,
as keep-sakes of the struggle as well
as valuable references during the
game, they are unexcelled. More
space has been devoted to cuts and
reading matter and charts and ex
planations that has been the case in
the past. In fact, the managers, D.
H. Walker Jr. '09, and J. E. Thomp
son '11, have compiled the record with
the idea of making in invaluable to
rooters and visitors alike'.
Taking the book in order, there is
an interesting article on the moment
of the struggle, being a resume of
football 011 the Coast, and a compari
son of the teams. This foreword will
make clear in a few sentences just
what the visiting spectator wants to
know.
An absolutely new and striking pose
of each captain has been secured and
reproduced as a full page illustration,
together with a record of the men
who will lead the rival fifteens.
Coaches Presley, Schaeffer and
"Mother" Howe will be included, as
well as "Dad" Moulton and Trainer
Christie, Managers Burbank and Mer
ritt. The write-ups in every case are
complete and accurate and offer an
equally good opportunity for under
graduate and visitor to become well
versed.
Of especial importance is the fact
that two full pages have been de
voted to the compilation of new and
old songs of both universities. This
listing of the songs is a feature which
past managers have dismissed with
but scant attention making it very
difficult for visiting partisans to keep
apace with yells and songs they have
not heard before.

The two teams are listed according
to position and in the squad picture
the size of the reproduction permits
of individual idenification.
The yell leaders have been given
customary attention. Stanford's three
directors and the trio from Berkeley
are reproduced in action.
The peculiar team formations by
Coaches Presley and Schaeffer are
carefully charted and a rooter or out
sider can tell at a glance just where
each player will be seen. This is a
decided innovation and the book con
tains in addition a score card which
permits a chart of the plays beink
kept. Opposite the score card is an
abbreviated code of rules which ful
ly takes up every point in the scor
ing which is liable to come up and
cause confusion to anyone who does
not know the intricacies of the new
game.
Purchasers of the football souvenir
program will also obtain the complete
and official programs of both shows.
The common details of such books
are also included, suHi as cuts of the
veterans, account of the freshman
game, record of past games, etc., mak
ing a 50-page volume which is larger
by several pages than the largest, big
gest program publlshd up to date.
A noteworthy fact in connection
with the book is that it contains more
advertisements than any other in
spite of the fact that the managers
have eliminated all liquor advertise
ments and have been obliged to con
tend with the Portola Festival in San
Francisco and organized boycotts of
all programs by Berkeley, Oakland
and San Jose merchants.
With a good bleacher sale the man
agers expect, to turn into the student
body a considerable sum. The book
sells for 25 cents.

body a considerable sum. The book
sells for 25 cents.
In keeping with the game, which is
expected to be one of the best and
largest attended in history, the sou
venir programs that will be placed
011 the bleachers tomorrow are in a
class by themselves. The books pre
sent a striking appearance. Printed
011 heavy white stock with a poster
front page by Stuart Macdonald '10,
as keep-sakes of the struggle as well
as valuable references during the
game, they are unexcelled. More
space has been devoted to cuts and
reading matter and charts and ex
planations that has been the case in
the past. In fact, the managers, D.
H. Walker Jr. '09, and J. E. Thomp
son '11, have compiled the record with
the idea of making in invaluable to
rooters and visitors alike'.
Taking the book in order, there is
an interesting article on the moment
of the struggle, being a resume of
football 011 the Coast, and a compari
son of the teams. This foreword will
make clear in a few sentences just
what the visiting spectator wants to
know.
An absolutely new and striking pose
of each captain has been secured and
reproduced as a full page illustration,
together with a record of the men
who will lead the rival fifteens.
Coaches Presley, Schaeffer and
"Mother" Howe will be included, as
well as "Dad" Moulton and Trainer
Christie, Managers Burbank and Mer
ritt. The write-ups in every case are
complete and accurate and offer an
equally good opportunity for under
graduate and visitor to become well
versed.
Of especial importance is the fact
that two full pages have been de
voted to the compilation of new and
old songs of both universities. This
listing of the songs is a feature which
past managers have dismissed with
but scant attention making it very
difficult for visiting partisans to keep
apace with yells and songs they have
not heard before.

The two teams are listed according
to position and in the squad picture
the size of the reproduction permits
of individual idenification.
The yell leaders have been given
customary attention. Stanford's three
directors and the trio from Berkeley
are reproduced in action.
The peculiar team formations by
Coaches Presley and Schaeffer are
carefully charted and a rooter or out
sider can tell at a glance just where
each player will be seen. This is a
decided innovation and the book con
tains in addition a score card which
permits a chart of the plays beink
kept. Opposite the score card is an
abbreviated code of rules which ful
ly takes up every point in the scor
ing which is liable to come up and
cause confusion to anyone who does
not know the intricacies of the new
game.
Purchasers of the football souvenir
program will also obtain the complete
and official programs of both shows.
The common details of such books
are also included, suHi as cuts of the
veterans, account of the freshman
game, record of past games, etc., mak
ing a 50-page volume which is larger
by several pages than the largest, big
gest program publlshd up to date.
A noteworthy fact in connection
with the book is that it contains more
advertisements than any other in
spite of the fact that the managers
have eliminated all liquor advertise
ments and have been obliged to con
tend with the Portola Festival in San
Francisco and organized boycotts of
all programs by Berkeley, Oakland
and San Jose merchants.
With a good bleacher sale the man
agers expect, to turn into the student
body a considerable sum. The book
sells for 25 cents.
