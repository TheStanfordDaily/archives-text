# Cardinal and Blue and Gold Fifteens Will Clash in Nineteenth Annual Football Contest, on Stanford Field.
## 
### 
Following the most uncertain sea
son on record; after the noisest foot
ball rally in history; before the larg
| est crowd ever assemled on Stanford
! Field; the best varsity team that has
ever battled for the Cardinal will
either wrest from the desperate hosts
of the University of California an elev
enth intercollegiate football victory
or will suffer the fifth defeat which
has fallen to the lot of a Stanford
varsity team. The nineteenth annual
struggle and the fourth Rugby battle
between the rival fifteens of the two
universities is scheduled for decision
on Stanford Field to-morrow after
noon. commencing at 2:30 o'clock.
Ten times has the Cardinal triumphed;
four times has the Blue and Cold been
victorious; and on four occasions
a drawn conflict resulted. Not since
the fall of 1902 has a Stanford Var
sity been vanquished. A single tie
and five successive triumphant ser
pentines is an achievement seldom
accomplished and yet. more rarely ex
tended. Nevertheless, the sole aim
and purpose of the 1909 Cardinal fif
teen is to give to Stanford a sixth
consecutive victory and to the root
ing undergraduates still another elated
serpentine. That the team will suc
ceed in its ambitious design is not
I only the partisan belief of every Stan
ford student, but is also the sincere
prediction of a majority of the Rugby
experts of San Francisco and vicinity.
To-morrow the tale will be told.
Early in September Coach Presley
held the first practice of the Rugby
squad. Veterans were numerous,
available substitutes were many and
formidable, and the rumors from the
enemy's camp across the bay were
profoundly encouraging to the hope*
of the Cardinal supporters. Assurance
as to the outcome of the intercollegiate
game was unbounded. Eight mighty
veterans composed a "200-pound
scrum." The cool fttid nervy Mit
chell was at first five. Holman, the

cleverest three-quarter on the Pacific
Coast, was on the wing. Roth was
playing a matchless center, and the
speedy Reed was rivalling Holman.
Scott was making himself perfectly
at home at half, while Freshman Mit
chell loomed up as a wonderful suc
cessor to Ganong. How could the Car
dinal lose? At last, the ugly MO to 0
score was to be wiped from memory.
Of these sentiments the entire campus
partook.
The doctor ordered Scott off the
field. Reed, shifted to half, was play
ing the position better than well, when
an accident forced him to retirement.
After being incapacitated for over a
month. Captain Mitchell returned, and
the backfield combination was just be
ginning to show superior efficiency
when Roth and S. Mitchell were dis
abled and required to absent them
selves from the squad for at least two
weeks. This was but a fortnight ago,
and the disruption has counted tre
mendously. Furthermore, on Satur
day. Brown will play his first game
since October 23.
Hopes have been shattered. Ideals
have been changed. It is no longer.
"How can Stanford lose?" The 30 to
0 record has been conceded a longer
lease of life. A victory, however
small, however scant, will now satisfy
all but the unreasonably optimistic.
And the entire situation seems to just
ify the assertion that Stanford should
win by a small margin gained, not
through luck, but by a shade of su
periority which the Cardinal can
rightly claim over her Mine and Gold
opponents.
In other columns of this issue there
will be found partisan and none-parti
san accounts of the chances of the
respective teams. No matter how th- 1
writers differ on other points, they are
one on the closeness and fierceness
of the fight. The struggle will with
out a doubt be the hardest-fought
