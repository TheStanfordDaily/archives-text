# Cardinal and Blue and Gold Fifteens Will Clash in Nineteenth Annual Football Contest, on Stanford Field.
## 
### 
Following the most uncertain sea
son on record; after the noisest foot
ball rally in history; before the larg
| est crowd ever assemled on Stanford
! Field; the best varsity team that has
ever battled for the Cardinal will
either wrest from the desperate hosts
of the University of California an elev
enth intercollegiate football victory
or will suffer the fifth defeat which
has fallen to the lot of a Stanford
varsity team. The nineteenth annual
struggle and the fourth Rugby battle
between the rival fifteens of the two
universities is scheduled for decision
on Stanford Field to-morrow after
noon. commencing at 2:30 o'clock.
Ten times has the Cardinal triumphed;
four times has the Blue and Cold been
victorious; and on four occasions
a drawn conflict resulted. Not since
the fall of 1902 has a Stanford Var
sity been vanquished. A single tie
and five successive triumphant ser
pentines is an achievement seldom
accomplished and yet. more rarely ex
tended. Nevertheless, the sole aim
and purpose of the 1909 Cardinal fif
teen is to give to Stanford a sixth
consecutive victory and to the root
ing undergraduates still another elated
serpentine. That the team will suc
ceed in its ambitious design is not
I only the partisan belief of every Stan
ford student, but is also the sincere
prediction of a majority of the Rugby
experts of San Francisco and vicinity.
To-morrow the tale will be told.
Early in September Coach Presley
held the first practice of the Rugby
squad. Veterans were numerous,
available substitutes were many and
formidable, and the rumors from the
enemy's camp across the bay were
profoundly encouraging to the hope*
of the Cardinal supporters. Assurance
as to the outcome of the intercollegiate
game was unbounded. Eight mighty
veterans composed a "200-pound
scrum." The cool fttid nervy Mit
chell was at first five. Holman, the

cleverest three-quarter on the Pacific
Coast, was on the wing. Roth was
playing a matchless center, and the
speedy Reed was rivalling Holman.
Scott was making himself perfectly
at home at half, while Freshman Mit
chell loomed up as a wonderful suc
cessor to Ganong. How could the Car
dinal lose? At last, the ugly MO to 0
score was to be wiped from memory.
Of these sentiments the entire campus
partook.
The doctor ordered Scott off the
field. Reed, shifted to half, was play
ing the position better than well, when
an accident forced him to retirement.
After being incapacitated for over a
month. Captain Mitchell returned, and
the backfield combination was just be
ginning to show superior efficiency
when Roth and S. Mitchell were dis
abled and required to absent them
selves from the squad for at least two
weeks. This was but a fortnight ago,
and the disruption has counted tre
mendously. Furthermore, on Satur
day. Brown will play his first game
since October 23.
Hopes have been shattered. Ideals
have been changed. It is no longer.
"How can Stanford lose?" The 30 to
0 record has been conceded a longer
lease of life. A victory, however
small, however scant, will now satisfy
all but the unreasonably optimistic.
And the entire situation seems to just
ify the assertion that Stanford should
win by a small margin gained, not
through luck, but by a shade of su
periority which the Cardinal can
rightly claim over her Mine and Gold
opponents.
In other columns of this issue there
will be found partisan and none-parti
san accounts of the chances of the
respective teams. No matter how th- 1
writers differ on other points, they are
one on the closeness and fierceness
of the fight. The struggle will with
out a doubt be the hardest-fought
intercollegiate battle since the game
of Rugby was inaugurated. In the
first place, the teams are most evenly
matched. Then California, spurred
and goaded by constant defeat, has
exerted her every ounce of mental
and physical energy to send forth a
conquering fifteen. On the other hand,
recent misfortunes have brought the
Stanford student body to a full reali
zation of the real closeness of the
game, and, as a result, undergraduate
spirit has been doubly aroused. On
the bleachers to • morrow the Cardinal
rooters will fight their hardest for the
team. It is unquestionably true —the
clash will be a mighty one.

A special article in this issue tolls
in detail of the ability of the thirty
men who have been selected for posi
tions on the two varsities. Suffice it
here to say that with relatively a
minimum of experienced men, Coaches
Howe and Schaeffer have suceeded in
perfecting the best and strongest fif
teen that lias ever represented Cali
fornia. Although abundantly supplied
with veterans, Coach Presley lias had
to centend with so much discouraging
ill-luck that his good fortune in pos
sessing such valuable material has
been effectively counterbalanced. For
experience, however, the Cardinal fif
teen is incomparable. Three men,
Crawford, Holnmn and Pemberton, will

play on the varsity for the fourth
time, while Captain Mitchell, Miu
turn, Thorpe and Cheda will make
their third appearance. For Horton,
Dole and Brown this will be the second
occasion of its kind, while Saturday's
game will be the debut of Fitting,
Cass, S. Mitchell, Sanborn and Roth,
although the last-named player was in
the varsity line-up during the Van
couver series last Christmas.
A glance at the appended tables will
show that California is outweighed
both forward and back, the average
deficiency of the entire team being
approximately five pounds to the man.
The scores of the two varsities in
their preliminary games are mislead
ing and confusing. The apparently
poor work of the Blue and Gold
against the Castaways is at least par
tially explained, when it is remem
bered that Stanford faced an entirely
different and far weaker team on the
occasion of its southern trip. Further
more, the 56 to 0 score against Van
couver in the first game reflects no
more glory on the Cardinal Varsity
than does the 39 to 0 result on the
Blue and Gold fifteen, for Vancouver
was immeasurably less effective in
the contest on Stanford Field. Simi
larly, the meager 19 points of the
second game is almost meaningless,
for on that day the Stanford team was
completely disorganized and quite
justifiably discouraged. Judged from
a comprehensive viewpoint, the pre
liminary scores form but another link
in the already exhaustive chain of evi
dence which pi'oves the evenness of
the coming conflict.
0. Jenkinson, of Vancouver, will
referee the battle. This will be Jenk
inson's third appearance as head of
ficial of an intercolleigate varsity
game, and he has but to live it]) to
his previous reputation to give thor
ough satisfaction to all. E. Elliott,
captain of the Barbarians, and F.
Blair, a local referee, will hold the
touch flags, and the time will be kept
by the Brown brothers, E. J., U. C.,
•97, and D. E„ '97.
To conclude, nothing remains but
the game. The sixth straight victory
or the first defeat in seven years!
Which will it. be?

"How can Stanford lose?" The 30 to
0 record has been conceded a longer
lease of life. A victory, however
small, however scant, will now satisfy
all but the unreasonably optimistic.
And the entire situation seems to just
ify the assertion that Stanford should
win by a small margin gained, not
through luck, but by a shade of su
periority which the Cardinal can
rightly claim over her Mine and Gold
opponents.
In other columns of this issue there
will be found partisan and none-parti
san accounts of the chances of the
respective teams. No matter how th- 1
writers differ on other points, they are
one on the closeness and fierceness
of the fight. The struggle will with
out a doubt be the hardest-fought
intercollegiate battle since the game
of Rugby was inaugurated. In the
first place, the teams are most evenly
matched. Then California, spurred
and goaded by constant defeat, has
exerted her every ounce of mental
and physical energy to send forth a
conquering fifteen. On the other hand,
recent misfortunes have brought the
Stanford student body to a full reali
zation of the real closeness of the
game, and, as a result, undergraduate
spirit has been doubly aroused. On
the bleachers to • morrow the Cardinal
rooters will fight their hardest for the
team. It is unquestionably true —the
clash will be a mighty one.

A special article in this issue tolls
in detail of the ability of the thirty
men who have been selected for posi
tions on the two varsities. Suffice it
here to say that with relatively a
minimum of experienced men, Coaches
Howe and Schaeffer have suceeded in
perfecting the best and strongest fif
teen that lias ever represented Cali
fornia. Although abundantly supplied
with veterans, Coach Presley lias had
to centend with so much discouraging
ill-luck that his good fortune in pos
sessing such valuable material has
been effectively counterbalanced. For
experience, however, the Cardinal fif
teen is incomparable. Three men,
Crawford, Holnmn and Pemberton, will

play on the varsity for the fourth
time, while Captain Mitchell, Miu
turn, Thorpe and Cheda will make
their third appearance. For Horton,
Dole and Brown this will be the second
occasion of its kind, while Saturday's
game will be the debut of Fitting,
Cass, S. Mitchell, Sanborn and Roth,
although the last-named player was in
the varsity line-up during the Van
couver series last Christmas.
A glance at the appended tables will
show that California is outweighed
both forward and back, the average
deficiency of the entire team being
approximately five pounds to the man.
The scores of the two varsities in
their preliminary games are mislead
ing and confusing. The apparently
poor work of the Blue and Gold
against the Castaways is at least par
tially explained, when it is remem
bered that Stanford faced an entirely
different and far weaker team on the
occasion of its southern trip. Further
more, the 56 to 0 score against Van
couver in the first game reflects no
more glory on the Cardinal Varsity
than does the 39 to 0 result on the
Blue and Gold fifteen, for Vancouver
was immeasurably less effective in
the contest on Stanford Field. Simi
larly, the meager 19 points of the
second game is almost meaningless,
for on that day the Stanford team was
completely disorganized and quite
justifiably discouraged. Judged from
a comprehensive viewpoint, the pre
liminary scores form but another link
in the already exhaustive chain of evi
dence which pi'oves the evenness of
the coming conflict.
0. Jenkinson, of Vancouver, will
referee the battle. This will be Jenk
inson's third appearance as head of
ficial of an intercolleigate varsity
game, and he has but to live it]) to
his previous reputation to give thor
ough satisfaction to all. E. Elliott,
captain of the Barbarians, and F.
Blair, a local referee, will hold the
touch flags, and the time will be kept
by the Brown brothers, E. J., U. C.,
•97, and D. E„ '97.
To conclude, nothing remains but
the game. The sixth straight victory
or the first defeat in seven years!
Which will it. be?

Ten times has the Cardinal triumphed;

a drawn conflict resulted. Not since
the fall of 1902 has a Stanford Var

and five successive triumphant ser

accomplished and yet. more rarely ex

and purpose of the 1909 Cardinal fif

consecutive victory and to the root

prediction of a majority of the Rugby
experts of San Francisco and vicinity.
To-morrow the tale will be told.
Early in September Coach Presley
held the first practice of the Rugby
squad. Veterans were numerous,
available substitutes were many and
formidable, and the rumors from the
enemy's camp across the bay were
profoundly encouraging to the hope*
of the Cardinal supporters. Assurance
as to the outcome of the intercollegiate
game was unbounded. Eight mighty
veterans composed a "200-pound
scrum." The cool fttid nervy Mit
chell was at first five. Holman, the

cleverest three-quarter on the Pacific
Coast, was on the wing. Roth was
playing a matchless center, and the
speedy Reed was rivalling Holman.
Scott was making himself perfectly
at home at half, while Freshman Mit
chell loomed up as a wonderful suc
cessor to Ganong. How could the Car
dinal lose? At last, the ugly MO to 0
score was to be wiped from memory.
Of these sentiments the entire campus
partook.
The doctor ordered Scott off the
field. Reed, shifted to half, was play
ing the position better than well, when
an accident forced him to retirement.
After being incapacitated for over a
month. Captain Mitchell returned, and
the backfield combination was just be
ginning to show superior efficiency
when Roth and S. Mitchell were dis
abled and required to absent them
selves from the squad for at least two
weeks. This was but a fortnight ago,

approximately five pounds to the man.
The scores of the two varsities in
their preliminary games are mislead
ing and confusing. The apparently
poor work of the Blue and Gold
against the Castaways is at least par
tially explained, when it is remem
bered that Stanford faced an entirely
different and far weaker team on the
occasion of its southern trip. Further
more, the 56 to 0 score against Van
couver in the first game reflects no
more glory on the Cardinal Varsity
than does the 39 to 0 result on the
Blue and Gold fifteen, for Vancouver
was immeasurably less effective in
the contest on Stanford Field. Simi
larly, the meager 19 points of the
second game is almost meaningless,
for on that day the Stanford team was
completely disorganized and quite
justifiably discouraged. Judged from
a comprehensive viewpoint, the pre
liminary scores form but another link
in the already exhaustive chain of evi
dence which pi'oves the evenness of
the coming conflict.
0. Jenkinson, of Vancouver, will
referee the battle. This will be Jenk
inson's third appearance as head of
ficial of an intercolleigate varsity
game, and he has but to live it]) to
his previous reputation to give thor
ough satisfaction to all. E. Elliott,
captain of the Barbarians, and F.
Blair, a local referee, will hold the
touch flags, and the time will be kept
by the Brown brothers, E. J., U. C.,
•97, and D. E„ '97.
To conclude, nothing remains but
the game. The sixth straight victory
or the first defeat in seven years!
Which will it. be?


('upturn "Mow" Mitchell,
Following the most uncertain sea
son on record; after the noisest foot
ball rally in history; before the larg
| est crowd ever assemled on Stanford
! Field; the best varsity team that has
ever battled for the Cardinal will
either wrest from the desperate hosts
of the University of California an elev
enth intercollegiate football victory
or will suffer the fifth defeat which
has fallen to the lot of a Stanford
varsity team. The nineteenth annual
struggle and the fourth Rugby battle
between the rival fifteens of the two
universities is scheduled for decision
on Stanford Field to-morrow after
noon. commencing at 2:30 o'clock.
Ten times has the Cardinal triumphed;
four times has the Blue and Cold been
victorious; and on four occasions
a drawn conflict resulted. Not since
the fall of 1902 has a Stanford Var
sity been vanquished. A single tie
and five successive triumphant ser
pentines is an achievement seldom
accomplished and yet. more rarely ex
tended. Nevertheless, the sole aim
and purpose of the 1909 Cardinal fif
teen is to give to Stanford a sixth
consecutive victory and to the root
ing undergraduates still another elated
serpentine. That the team will suc
ceed in its ambitious design is not
I only the partisan belief of every Stan
ford student, but is also the sincere
prediction of a majority of the Rugby
experts of San Francisco and vicinity.
To-morrow the tale will be told.
Early in September Coach Presley
held the first practice of the Rugby
squad. Veterans were numerous,
available substitutes were many and
formidable, and the rumors from the
enemy's camp across the bay were
profoundly encouraging to the hope*
of the Cardinal supporters. Assurance
as to the outcome of the intercollegiate
game was unbounded. Eight mighty
veterans composed a "200-pound
scrum." The cool fttid nervy Mit
chell was at first five. Holman, the

cleverest three-quarter on the Pacific
Coast, was on the wing. Roth was
playing a matchless center, and the
speedy Reed was rivalling Holman.
Scott was making himself perfectly
at home at half, while Freshman Mit
chell loomed up as a wonderful suc
cessor to Ganong. How could the Car
dinal lose? At last, the ugly MO to 0
score was to be wiped from memory.
Of these sentiments the entire campus
partook.
The doctor ordered Scott off the
field. Reed, shifted to half, was play
ing the position better than well, when
an accident forced him to retirement.
After being incapacitated for over a
month. Captain Mitchell returned, and
the backfield combination was just be
ginning to show superior efficiency
when Roth and S. Mitchell were dis
abled and required to absent them
selves from the squad for at least two
weeks. This was but a fortnight ago,
and the disruption has counted tre
mendously. Furthermore, on Satur
day. Brown will play his first game
since October 23.
Hopes have been shattered. Ideals
have been changed. It is no longer.
"How can Stanford lose?" The 30 to
0 record has been conceded a longer
lease of life. A victory, however
small, however scant, will now satisfy
all but the unreasonably optimistic.
And the entire situation seems to just
ify the assertion that Stanford should
win by a small margin gained, not
through luck, but by a shade of su
periority which the Cardinal can
rightly claim over her Mine and Gold
opponents.
In other columns of this issue there
will be found partisan and none-parti
san accounts of the chances of the
respective teams. No matter how th- 1
writers differ on other points, they are
one on the closeness and fierceness
of the fight. The struggle will with
out a doubt be the hardest-fought
intercollegiate battle since the game
of Rugby was inaugurated. In the
first place, the teams are most evenly
matched. Then California, spurred
and goaded by constant defeat, has
exerted her every ounce of mental
and physical energy to send forth a
conquering fifteen. On the other hand,
recent misfortunes have brought the
Stanford student body to a full reali
zation of the real closeness of the
game, and, as a result, undergraduate
spirit has been doubly aroused. On
the bleachers to • morrow the Cardinal
rooters will fight their hardest for the
team. It is unquestionably true —the
clash will be a mighty one.

A special article in this issue tolls
in detail of the ability of the thirty
men who have been selected for posi
tions on the two varsities. Suffice it
here to say that with relatively a
minimum of experienced men, Coaches
Howe and Schaeffer have suceeded in
perfecting the best and strongest fif
teen that lias ever represented Cali
fornia. Although abundantly supplied
with veterans, Coach Presley lias had
to centend with so much discouraging
ill-luck that his good fortune in pos
sessing such valuable material has
been effectively counterbalanced. For
experience, however, the Cardinal fif
teen is incomparable. Three men,
Crawford, Holnmn and Pemberton, will

play on the varsity for the fourth
time, while Captain Mitchell, Miu
turn, Thorpe and Cheda will make
their third appearance. For Horton,
Dole and Brown this will be the second
occasion of its kind, while Saturday's
game will be the debut of Fitting,
Cass, S. Mitchell, Sanborn and Roth,
although the last-named player was in
the varsity line-up during the Van
couver series last Christmas.
A glance at the appended tables will
show that California is outweighed
both forward and back, the average
deficiency of the entire team being
approximately five pounds to the man.
