# TO CELEBRATE GAME
## TWELVE BIG VAUDEVILLE ACTS IN FOOTBALL SHOW. Catchy Music and Keen Humor Characterize To-morrow Evening's Program. 
### 
An evening of exceptional vaude
ville, replete with catchy music and
keen humor, will serve as a fitting
climax for the great Rugby battle that
will be waged tomorrow afternoon.
The program that will hold the boards
in Assembly Hall tomorrow evening
rivals the offerings of the best vaude
ville houses, not only in its rich va
riety and its excellence as a whole,
but in the unusual merit of each in
dividual number. Bright songs, clever
monologue, graceful dances and
sketches abounding with humor will
follow each other in rapid succession.
A spirit of hilarity most appropriate
for a football show will characterize
the entire program, and the under
graduates will be given an opportun
ity to give expression to their own
exuberant spirits.
Local color and Stanford hits have
been introduced into the program at
every point. New and appropriate
verses have been written for the
songs, Stanford music will be ren
dered by both band and orchestra and
the numerous monologues and skits
are replete with humorous allusions
to local conditions! and characters.
The artists who will present the va
rious numbers need no introduction
to the Stanford theater-goers, hav
ing already achieved success in past
productions.
In addition to the large number of
Thespians who will apear the entire
(ilee and Mandolin Clubs and (he
Stanford Orchestra and Band will
participate in the program.
The show has been planned and is
being produced under the direction
of the Combined Musical Clubs which
deserve great credit for the unusual
elaborateness of tlie program that will
be offered tomorrow evening. No
pains or expense have been spared in
' the preparation of the program. The
i services of professional coaches have
! been secured to direct the rehearsals
for the sketches and musical num
bers. Elaborate scenic effects have
been planned in connection with many
of the numbers. Special attention has
been paid to the light effects in the
i musical numbers, the stunts that have
been planned being both unique and
j beautiful. The costuming of the acts
lias not been slighted, special cos
; tumes having been secured from San
' Francisco for lhe occasion, with a
j view to making the stage pictures as
gorgeous as possible. A great amount
iof labor has been expended on the
musical selections, several orchestra
and band parts having been written
especially for this occasion. By this
means both the band and orchestra
J will be able to render not only the
! Stanford songs but many other new
! selections as well.
The management announces that
I the curtain will rise promptly at 8:1")
! and no one will be admitted there
j after except during intermissions. The
j stage direction of the show has been
, undertaken by G. F. Morgan, '10, to

The grand finale which will cl •
the program will consist of the si
ing of Stanford songs by the at
enco. The Stanford Band will t,
the stage and lead the singing.
An evening of exceptional vaude
ville, replete with catchy music and
keen humor, will serve as a fitting
climax for the great Rugby battle that
will be waged tomorrow afternoon.
The program that will hold the boards
in Assembly Hall tomorrow evening
rivals the offerings of the best vaude
ville houses, not only in its rich va
riety and its excellence as a whole,
but in the unusual merit of each in
dividual number. Bright songs, clever
monologue, graceful dances and
sketches abounding with humor will
follow each other in rapid succession.
A spirit of hilarity most appropriate
for a football show will characterize
the entire program, and the under
graduates will be given an opportun
ity to give expression to their own
exuberant spirits.
Local color and Stanford hits have
been introduced into the program at
every point. New and appropriate
verses have been written for the
songs, Stanford music will be ren
dered by both band and orchestra and
the numerous monologues and skits
are replete with humorous allusions
to local conditions! and characters.
The artists who will present the va
rious numbers need no introduction
to the Stanford theater-goers, hav
ing already achieved success in past
productions.
In addition to the large number of
Thespians who will apear the entire
(ilee and Mandolin Clubs and (he
Stanford Orchestra and Band will
participate in the program.
The show has been planned and is
being produced under the direction
of the Combined Musical Clubs which
deserve great credit for the unusual
elaborateness of tlie program that will
be offered tomorrow evening. No
pains or expense have been spared in
' the preparation of the program. The
i services of professional coaches have
! been secured to direct the rehearsals
for the sketches and musical num
bers. Elaborate scenic effects have
been planned in connection with many
of the numbers. Special attention has
been paid to the light effects in the
i musical numbers, the stunts that have
been planned being both unique and
j beautiful. The costuming of the acts
lias not been slighted, special cos
; tumes having been secured from San
' Francisco for lhe occasion, with a
j view to making the stage pictures as
gorgeous as possible. A great amount
iof labor has been expended on the
musical selections, several orchestra
and band parts having been written
especially for this occasion. By this
means both the band and orchestra
J will be able to render not only the
! Stanford songs but many other new
! selections as well.
The management announces that
I the curtain will rise promptly at 8:1")
! and no one will be admitted there
j after except during intermissions. The
j stage direction of the show has been
, undertaken by G. F. Morgan, '10, to
whose efforts is due a large share of
j the credit for the excellence of the
j program. Sword and Sandals will
