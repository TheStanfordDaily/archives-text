# Expert and Undergraduate Opinion
## ARE EVENLY MATCHED PREDICTS CLOSE CONTEST WITH CARDINAL VICTORIOUS. San Francisco Expert Relies on Stanford's knowledge of Game Turning Balance. 
### "Bobs 
The supremacy of the Cardinals
since the introduction of Rugby as an
intercollegiate sport three years ago
has not in any way diminished the
interest in the annual struggle, and
the game this year promises to sur
pass its predecessors from a stand
point of undergraduate rivalry. To
attempt to forecast the result of to
morrow's game with any accuracy is
a stupendous task, as the fortunes of
football will cut a large figure in the
ultimate score. Both varsities have
shown up exceptionally well in the
preliminary games of the season, but
in estimating the compartive strength
of the two varsity fifteens these
games must not be taken too seri
ously. The coaches look upon these
early contests in the light of prac
tice for the various members of their
squad of aspirants and the line-up is
accordingly changed beyond recogni
tion time and again.
Whatever the result of the hi.;
struggle it is certain that the occu
pants of the bleachers will witness th >
best exhibition of Rugby ever played
on the Pacific Coast and those who
are still of the opinion that the old
game is the better of the two, should
be on hand to give the open game a
fair chance under idea! conditions. !
have no hesitation in saying that
either of the opposing teams this year
could take the Cardinal of last season
into camp by a respectable margin.
Fumbles are very rare and the gen
eral knowledge of the rules evinced
by the men on the field is the finest
tribute that can be paid to Presley,
Howe and Schaeffer.
The mid-season adoption of the 3-
12-3 scrum has been criticised by
many local experts who believe that
the forwards with the old formation
are able to get the ball to their backs
more expeditiously.
In commenting on the strength of
the California fifteen a word of praise
is due to both Schaeffer and Howe for
their prowess in developing such a
formidable Rugby machine. The for-
wards not on (lie heavy side are full
of fight, clever in the loose, and use
every ounce of their poundage to
good advantage, and what is more, do
not know what it is to qiut. In past
years the California team has snapped
suddenly somewhere about the middle
of the second half hut there is no in
dication of such a possibility this
year. The fight for places has also
been keener than ever, some of the
positions being in doubt until the last
sute. In the loose Northcroft,
'h eger and Graff show up exception
well, the first named player be
the best dribbler in the pack,
iptain Cerf occupies the import
:)!. role of half-back which is (he
cuunecting link between the scrum
and backfield. Cerf has improved
wonderfully since the season started
as a feeder for passing movements
and has no peer as a breaker-up of
opposing combination . Whether he
will be able to shine as conspicuously
against the fast Stanford backs her
alded by their 200-pound brigade as
he did against the teams met. in
earlier competition is another story,
however, and this will be settled final
ly tomorrow.
Elliott and Allen have been doing
wonderful work in attack all the sea
son at five-eighths and on their
showing tomorrow much of Califor
nia's hopes depend.
Elliott is a clever all-round player
who has yet, however, to show to good
advantage in an important struggle,
while Allen has not. impressed the
f ms as a defense man.
The California wings, Watt} and
ohns, are at their best right nov;
id have easily outstripped their
vals in making good their claims
â€¢r position,? on Ihe team. Both of

them are at least 50 per cent better
than they were twelve months ago
and they are very dangerous when
given an opportunity close lo the line.
Dwiggins is one of the headiest play
ers on the team, an excellent punter
and quick to size up an situation no
matter how complicated, but his lack
of weight will certainly tell against

him when he is called upon to stop
Messrs. Crawford and Co. close to ihe
line.
The Cardinal pack needs no intro
duction. Every man selected to do
scrum duty has been conceded a place

from the first hour he donned uniform
i his year. Averaging 200 pounds per
man, they have simply toyed with
their opponents in previous games,
and keyed up to the top notch as
they will be tomorrow it is hard to
imagine a lighter pack stopping their
progress when once under way.
"Babe" Crawford is considered by
most Rugby fans on the Coast to be
the peer of forwards in these parts.
He works like a trojan in the scrum,
uses his head and long reach in the
line out and is never many yards
away from the ball in the loose. The
other forwards are all fast, honest
workers in pack formation, and none
of them know what, it is to let. up.
Rarely, if ever in the history of Rug
by, has such a monster pack shown
such speed as that which represents
the Cardinal tomorrow.
Coach Presley has had his troubles
in developing a half-back this year.
First Erb was unable to qualify for
scholarship reasons, next Scott was
ordered by the doctor to give up foot
ball and then just as Reed seemed
specially suitable for the position
misfortune overtakes him in the shape
ol a broken leg. But despite this
chapter of accidents, a clever, heady
player was lying handy in Louis Cass,
the Los Angeles freshmen, and Pres
ley broke all records for last minute
development. Cass is now worthy of
being enrolled in the list of Cardinal
heroes, having mastered most of the
line points of the game in quick or
der.
Captain Mitchell and his brother,
Stan, form a five-eighth battalion
that will prove a valuable asset for
Stanford against her rival, not only in
offense but in defense, and most of
the Cardinal scores will be made via
the "fraternal" route.
Sanborn's recent showing against

Vancouver and the second team in
practice lias entitled him to a place
011 the tetam. He is a very useful
J asset in a combination machine, rare
i ly failing to set the ball to his wings
I when given possession. "Dutch"
! Roth is a strong runner, capable of
! holding up his own end at wing three
quarter, as he is one of those never-
I failing tacklers who transform many
a certain try into a checked move
ment. Jasper Holman is the best
three-quarterback playing Rugby in
America today and will surely score
at least once tomorrow.
To sum up California will make ;i
tremendous bid for victory tomorrow
and will be represented by a formid
able fifteen. In her favor may be
mentioned the accuracy of Elliott's
goal kicking, this player having
shown wonderful prowess in this de
partment. The Stanford field also
favors the Hlne and Gold, accustomed
as they are to heavier going and the
change from heavy uniforms to light
Rugby apaprel will work in their fa
vor. Notwithstanding these advan
tages the Stanford fifteen figures to
win handily and the writer will not
be surprised to see the Cardinal vic
torious by a number of points dou
ble its adversary's. The Stanford
forwards will carry the play into the
California territory and the superior
ity of the Cardinal defense will pre
vent California from annexing many
points although they figure to cross
the line on at least one occasion. The
weak tackling of half the California
backfield will be their undoing.

good advantage, and what is more, do
not know what it is to qiut. In past
years the California team has snapped
suddenly somewhere about the middle
of the second half hut there is no in
dication of such a possibility this
year. The fight for places has also
been keener than ever, some of the
positions being in doubt until the last
sute. In the loose Northcroft,
'h eger and Graff show up exception
well, the first named player be
the best dribbler in the pack,
iptain Cerf occupies the import

cuunecting link between the scrum
and backfield. Cerf has improved
wonderfully since the season started
as a feeder for passing movements
and has no peer as a breaker-up of
opposing combination . Whether he
will be able to shine as conspicuously
against the fast Stanford backs her
alded by their 200-pound brigade as
he did against the teams met. in
earlier competition is another story,
however, and this will be settled final
ly tomorrow.
Elliott and Allen have been doing
wonderful work in attack all the sea
son at five-eighths and on their
showing tomorrow much of Califor
nia's hopes depend.
Elliott is a clever all-round player
who has yet, however, to show to good
advantage in an important struggle,
while Allen has not. impressed the
f ms as a defense man.
The California wings, Watt} and
ohns, are at their best right nov;
id have easily outstripped their
vals in making good their claims
â€¢r position,? on Ihe team. Both of

them are at least 50 per cent better
than they were twelve months ago
and they are very dangerous when
given an opportunity close lo the line.
Dwiggins is one of the headiest play
ers on the team, an excellent punter
and quick to size up an situation no
matter how complicated, but his lack
of weight will certainly tell against

him when he is called upon to stop
Messrs. Crawford and Co. close to ihe
line.
The Cardinal pack needs no intro
duction. Every man selected to do
scrum duty has been conceded a place

from the first hour he donned uniform
i his year. Averaging 200 pounds per
man, they have simply toyed with
their opponents in previous games,
and keyed up to the top notch as
they will be tomorrow it is hard to
imagine a lighter pack stopping their
progress when once under way.
"Babe" Crawford is considered by
most Rugby fans on the Coast to be
the peer of forwards in these parts.
He works like a trojan in the scrum,
uses his head and long reach in the
line out and is never many yards
away from the ball in the loose. The
other forwards are all fast, honest
workers in pack formation, and none
of them know what, it is to let. up.
Rarely, if ever in the history of Rug
by, has such a monster pack shown
such speed as that which represents
the Cardinal tomorrow.
Coach Presley has had his troubles
in developing a half-back this year.
First Erb was unable to qualify for
scholarship reasons, next Scott was
ordered by the doctor to give up foot
ball and then just as Reed seemed
specially suitable for the position
misfortune overtakes him in the shape
ol a broken leg. But despite this
chapter of accidents, a clever, heady
player was lying handy in Louis Cass,
the Los Angeles freshmen, and Pres
ley broke all records for last minute
development. Cass is now worthy of
being enrolled in the list of Cardinal
heroes, having mastered most of the
line points of the game in quick or
der.
Captain Mitchell and his brother,
Stan, form a five-eighth battalion
that will prove a valuable asset for
Stanford against her rival, not only in
offense but in defense, and most of
the Cardinal scores will be made via
the "fraternal" route.
Sanborn's recent showing against

Vancouver and the second team in
practice lias entitled him to a place
011 the tetam. He is a very useful
J asset in a combination machine, rare
i ly failing to set the ball to his wings
I when given possession. "Dutch"
! Roth is a strong runner, capable of
! holding up his own end at wing three
quarter, as he is one of those never-
I failing tacklers who transform many
a certain try into a checked move
ment. Jasper Holman is the best
three-quarterback playing Rugby in
America today and will surely score
at least once tomorrow.
To sum up California will make ;i
tremendous bid for victory tomorrow
and will be represented by a formid
able fifteen. In her favor may be
mentioned the accuracy of Elliott's
goal kicking, this player having
shown wonderful prowess in this de
partment. The Stanford field also
favors the Hlne and Gold, accustomed
as they are to heavier going and the
change from heavy uniforms to light
Rugby apaprel will work in their fa
vor. Notwithstanding these advan
tages the Stanford fifteen figures to
win handily and the writer will not
be surprised to see the Cardinal vic
torious by a number of points dou
ble its adversary's. The Stanford
forwards will carry the play into the
California territory and the superior
ity of the Cardinal defense will pre
vent California from annexing many
points although they figure to cross
the line on at least one occasion. The
weak tackling of half the California
backfield will be their undoing.


Coach George J. Presley
The supremacy of the Cardinals
since the introduction of Rugby as an
intercollegiate sport three years ago
has not in any way diminished the
interest in the annual struggle, and
the game this year promises to sur
pass its predecessors from a stand
point of undergraduate rivalry. To
attempt to forecast the result of to
morrow's game with any accuracy is
a stupendous task, as the fortunes of
football will cut a large figure in the
ultimate score. Both varsities have
shown up exceptionally well in the
preliminary games of the season, but
in estimating the compartive strength
of the two varsity fifteens these
games must not be taken too seri
ously. The coaches look upon these
early contests in the light of prac
tice for the various members of their
squad of aspirants and the line-up is
accordingly changed beyond recogni
tion time and again.
Whatever the result of the hi.;
struggle it is certain that the occu
pants of the bleachers will witness th >
best exhibition of Rugby ever played
on the Pacific Coast and those who

have no hesitation in saying that
either of the opposing teams this year
could take the Cardinal of last season
into camp by a respectable margin.
Fumbles are very rare and the gen
eral knowledge of the rules evinced
by the men on the field is the finest
tribute that can be paid to Presley,
Howe and Schaeffer.
The mid-season adoption of the 3-

many local experts who believe that
the forwards with the old formation
are able to get the ball to their backs
more expeditiously.
In commenting on the strength of
the California fifteen a word of praise
is due to both Schaeffer and Howe for
their prowess in developing such a

from the first hour he donned uniform
i his year. Averaging 200 pounds per
man, they have simply toyed with
their opponents in previous games,
and keyed up to the top notch as
they will be tomorrow it is hard to
imagine a lighter pack stopping their
progress when once under way.
"Babe" Crawford is considered by
most Rugby fans on the Coast to be
the peer of forwards in these parts.
He works like a trojan in the scrum,
uses his head and long reach in the
line out and is never many yards
away from the ball in the loose. The
other forwards are all fast, honest
workers in pack formation, and none
of them know what, it is to let. up.
Rarely, if ever in the history of Rug
by, has such a monster pack shown
such speed as that which represents
the Cardinal tomorrow.
Coach Presley has had his troubles
in developing a half-back this year.
First Erb was unable to qualify for
scholarship reasons, next Scott was
ordered by the doctor to give up foot
ball and then just as Reed seemed
specially suitable for the position
misfortune overtakes him in the shape
ol a broken leg. But despite this
chapter of accidents, a clever, heady
player was lying handy in Louis Cass,
the Los Angeles freshmen, and Pres
ley broke all records for last minute
development. Cass is now worthy of
being enrolled in the list of Cardinal
heroes, having mastered most of the
line points of the game in quick or
der.
Captain Mitchell and his brother,
Stan, form a five-eighth battalion
that will prove a valuable asset for
Stanford against her rival, not only in
offense but in defense, and most of
the Cardinal scores will be made via
the "fraternal" route.
Sanborn's recent showing against

Vancouver and the second team in
practice lias entitled him to a place
011 the tetam. He is a very useful
J asset in a combination machine, rare
i ly failing to set the ball to his wings
I when given possession. "Dutch"
! Roth is a strong runner, capable of
! holding up his own end at wing three
quarter, as he is one of those never-
I failing tacklers who transform many
a certain try into a checked move
ment. Jasper Holman is the best
three-quarterback playing Rugby in
America today and will surely score
at least once tomorrow.
To sum up California will make ;i
tremendous bid for victory tomorrow
and will be represented by a formid
able fifteen. In her favor may be
mentioned the accuracy of Elliott's
goal kicking, this player having
shown wonderful prowess in this de
partment. The Stanford field also
favors the Hlne and Gold, accustomed
as they are to heavier going and the
change from heavy uniforms to light
Rugby apaprel will work in their fa
vor. Notwithstanding these advan
tages the Stanford fifteen figures to
win handily and the writer will not
be surprised to see the Cardinal vic
torious by a number of points dou
ble its adversary's. The Stanford
forwards will carry the play into the
California territory and the superior
ity of the Cardinal defense will pre
vent California from annexing many
points although they figure to cross
the line on at least one occasion. The
weak tackling of half the California
backfield will be their undoing.


Coach George J. Presley
The supremacy of the Cardinals
since the introduction of Rugby as an
intercollegiate sport three years ago
has not in any way diminished the
interest in the annual struggle, and
the game this year promises to sur
pass its predecessors from a stand
point of undergraduate rivalry. To
attempt to forecast the result of to
morrow's game with any accuracy is
a stupendous task, as the fortunes of
football will cut a large figure in the
ultimate score. Both varsities have
shown up exceptionally well in the
preliminary games of the season, but
in estimating the compartive strength
of the two varsity fifteens these
games must not be taken too seri
ously. The coaches look upon these
early contests in the light of prac
tice for the various members of their
squad of aspirants and the line-up is
accordingly changed beyond recogni
tion time and again.
Whatever the result of the hi.;
struggle it is certain that the occu
pants of the bleachers will witness th >
best exhibition of Rugby ever played
on the Pacific Coast and those who
are still of the opinion that the old
game is the better of the two, should
be on hand to give the open game a
fair chance under idea! conditions. !
have no hesitation in saying that
either of the opposing teams this year
could take the Cardinal of last season
into camp by a respectable margin.
Fumbles are very rare and the gen
eral knowledge of the rules evinced
by the men on the field is the finest
tribute that can be paid to Presley,
Howe and Schaeffer.
The mid-season adoption of the 3-
12-3 scrum has been criticised by
many local experts who believe that
the forwards with the old formation
are able to get the ball to their backs
more expeditiously.
In commenting on the strength of
the California fifteen a word of praise
is due to both Schaeffer and Howe for
their prowess in developing such a
formidable Rugby machine. The for-
wards not on (lie heavy side are full
of fight, clever in the loose, and use
every ounce of their poundage to
good advantage, and what is more, do
not know what it is to qiut. In past
years the California team has snapped
suddenly somewhere about the middle
of the second half hut there is no in
dication of such a possibility this
year. The fight for places has also
been keener than ever, some of the
positions being in doubt until the last
sute. In the loose Northcroft,
'h eger and Graff show up exception
well, the first named player be
the best dribbler in the pack,
iptain Cerf occupies the import
:)!. role of half-back which is (he
cuunecting link between the scrum
and backfield. Cerf has improved
wonderfully since the season started
as a feeder for passing movements
and has no peer as a breaker-up of
opposing combination . Whether he
will be able to shine as conspicuously
against the fast Stanford backs her
alded by their 200-pound brigade as
he did against the teams met. in
earlier competition is another story,
however, and this will be settled final
ly tomorrow.
Elliott and Allen have been doing
wonderful work in attack all the sea
son at five-eighths and on their
showing tomorrow much of Califor
nia's hopes depend.
Elliott is a clever all-round player
who has yet, however, to show to good
advantage in an important struggle,
while Allen has not. impressed the
f ms as a defense man.
The California wings, Watt} and
ohns, are at their best right nov;
id have easily outstripped their
vals in making good their claims
â€¢r position,? on Ihe team. Both of

them are at least 50 per cent better
than they were twelve months ago
and they are very dangerous when
given an opportunity close lo the line.
Dwiggins is one of the headiest play
ers on the team, an excellent punter
and quick to size up an situation no
matter how complicated, but his lack
of weight will certainly tell against

him when he is called upon to stop
Messrs. Crawford and Co. close to ihe
line.
The Cardinal pack needs no intro
duction. Every man selected to do
