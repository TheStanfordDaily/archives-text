hard season's training lias proved most
fitted to wear the Blue of their col

edge of the Rugby game, in physical

victory that pervades every man, and
in the machine-like precision of it

strongest aggregation California has
sent against the Cardinal for many
years.

will run on Stanford field to-morrow

are t lie best team the Blue and

a long time, lias been demonstrated
