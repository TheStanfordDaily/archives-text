## CALIFORNIA CONFIDENT OF A VICTORY TO-MORROW. Adherents of Blue and Gold Anticipate Serpentine on Stanford Field. 
### H.H. Krueger. C.C. '11 
California sends her best to Stanford
to-morrow, the fifteen men whom a
hard season's training lias proved most
fitted to wear the Blue of their col
lege on Stanford Field. In its knowl
edge of the Rugby game, in physical
condition, in the individual spirit of
victory that pervades every man, and
in the machine-like precision of it
work, the 1909 varsity is the
strongest aggregation California has
sent against the Cardinal for many
years.

will run on Stanford field to-morrow

are t lie best team the Blue and
Gold has had to represent it for
a long time, lias been demonstrated

time and again during the season
which ends to-day. In a series of
eleven preliminary games, only once
has the varsity team been on the short
end of the score. Coach Schaeffer's
fighting spirit and "Mother" Howe's
technical knowledge of the game have
turned out a winning team this year;
California's rooters believe that the
record of the season's victories will
be unbroken to-morrow.
Captaining the team and taking the
gruelling hard knocks at half, is
Cedric S. Cerf, hero of three varsity
games, and one of the best loved men
011 the campus. At five-eighths, El
liott and Allen are stationed, the for
mer having won his place by his
heady playing, his speed in getting
away with the ball and his ability to
convert; the latter is a varsity base
ball man whose speed has proved him
a fitting mate for Elliott. At three
quarters are Johns, Harris, and Watts,
the speediest men on the team. Des
pite the fact that the two latter men
have been out of the game for several
weeks with injured legs, they will be
in condition for to-morrow's contest,
and California looks to them for pas
sing rushes that will eat up ground
in Cardinal territory. Dwiggins at
full is easily the finest Rugby player
011 the team. Not even his lack of
weight has proved a handicap to the
clever full; his kicking to touch and
his speed have fitted him for the im
portant position of guardian of Cali
fornia's goal line.
In the scrum, California's front
rank will be taken care of by Carpen
ter, C. Phleger and Markwart; Ashley
and Hardy will be placed in the side
rank; Jordan, Graff and Northcraft
will complete the scrum at rear rank.
The California team totals 2,652
pounds, an average of 17(5 pounds to
the man. The scrum averages 190
nounds.
