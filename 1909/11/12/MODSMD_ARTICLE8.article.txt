# RELIES ON DEFENSE
## SUPERIOR WORK OF BACKFIELD SHOULD WIN GAME. Stanford Not Overconfident But Expects to Capture Hardfought Match. 
### W.P. Fuller. Jr., '10 
The preliminary games are over;
the fifteens have been chosen; the
question of supreme moment now is
what will be the result, Three weeks
ago Stanford clearly had considerably
more than an even chance to win.
Early season injuries had healed, and
lhe team remained intact, ready for
;i series of hard practices previous
(o I lie intercollegiate game. The stu
dent body al once began to overesti
mate its very good fortune, and just
when the feeling of sublime over
confidence was at its height, every
thing went wrong. Scrum half Reed
suffered a broken ankle and was
forced to retire from the squad. Five
eighths .Mitchell, Three-cpiarter Roth
and Fullback I'rown had to remain
off the held fur approximately two
weeks because of various injuries in
curred. Facli of these three men will
L'o into the struggle on Saturday
without having participated in a line
up for practcally a fortnight. The re
cent ill-luck has indeed been dis
couraging, but it has not proved whol
ly disastrous.
With the exception of Reed, the
Cardinal will be represented by the
strongest set of backs available. That
their lack of practice together during
the late season will militate against
their combination can not be disputed.
But, although not as good as it would
have been, the team work of the back
field is, in the writer's opinion, good
enough and far from inferior to that
of its rivals.
In one respect the Stanford backs
have had a decided advantage over the
Blue and Gold. The fives and three
quarters of the Cardinal second team
have been able to put forth an effect
ive defense even against, their varsity
opponents, while at California the
substitute backs have been woefully
weak. Consequently, the Cardinal is
well prepared by the experience of an
entire season to meet, the not entirely
satisfactory defense of the California
backfield, while the Blue and Gold
are much less ready to meet the rug

j;ed and splendidly sturdy defense of
the Stanford backfield.
The game, however, should he es
sentially a forward battle. No doubt
the men behind the packs will do most
of the scoring, and off this there
should be quite a little. But the bulk
and brunt of the play will be on the
forwards. They will take the ball
well down into the territory of one
or the other teams and thus make
possible the tallying of the backs.
Against the weight, experience and
individual brilliancy of the Cardinal
pack will be placed the wonderful
unification of the Blue and Gold for
wards, as developed by "Mother"
Howe. In the scrums Stanford should
prove the better, and a similar pre
diction as to the line-outs will proba
bly find justification. It is in the
loose that the real battle will occur,
for here the combination will have
the largest value. But despite argu
ments, prophesies and comparisons to
the contrary, the writer feels, like
every other member of the Stanford
student, body, that he will have to be
shown before he will believe that, a
pack composed of the eight able vet
erans who will compose the Cardinal
pack is going to be bested in a game
with California.
Thus, the favorable chances of three
weeks ago have been minimized but
not destroyed. On Saturday, the op
posing packs should be almost, on a
par; there is little or no choice be
tween the backflelds as regards their
scoring ability ;but on the defense
the Cardinals backs must be conceded
a slight superiority. On this scant
margin is based the prediction of a
narrow Stanford victory.
