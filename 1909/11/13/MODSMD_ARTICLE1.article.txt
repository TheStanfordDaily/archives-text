The apparent and continued inferi
ority of the Cardinal backfleld's de
fense, coupled with the complete de
moralization and helplessness of this
department during the last fifteen min
utes of the first half, won for the Cal
ifornia Varsity the nineteenth annual
intercollegiate football game, which
was sturdily fought on Stanford
Field this afternoon. The final score
was 19 to 13. And the best team won.
The Blue and Gold fifteen did not
exceed, but fully lived up to its envi
able reputation. It was the best Rug
by team that has ever represented
California. The Stanford fifteen fell

below the expectations of its admir
ers only in the defensive play of (he j
backs, which was disappointingly
weak. The attack of the tennis which
the Cardinal Varsity has met in the
preliminary games was not such as to

I require a strong defense for effective
repulsion, and consequently none de
veloped. To this alone is the defeat
due.
The combination of the Cardinal
backs when on the offensive was pre
cise and accurate, slightly excelling
that, of our opponents. The advantage
j was partially counterbalanced, how
ever, by the superior ease with which
the Blue and the Gold fives and three
quarters, considered individually,
handled the ball.
All praise to the Stanford forwards
With the remainder ot the fifteen play
ing a losing game, the Cardinal pack
continued mighty and plucky until the
end. Between the opposing packs it
is impossible to choose. All of tin 1
sixteen forwards were constantly on
the ball, lighting for a gain with vig
orous force. Crawford was clearly
the best man of either scrum, but
such individual brilliancy was offsei
by the irresistible attack off several
members of the Blue and Gold for
ward division. The Cardinal pack was
consistently successful in heeling out
to the half.
The first few minutes of play were
all in favor of the Cardinal. S. .Mit
chell scored so early in the period
that the hopes of Stanford rooters
soared high. Two goals from penalty
kicks, honestly earned by California,
soon turned the tide, however, and al
though S. Mitchell lost little time in
registering again, the fortunes of the
battle had changed and this was but
a momentary rally. Neither backfield
was entirely adequate throughout the
first half, but during the last portion
of that period the resisting ability of
the Stanford five and three-quarter
line was absolutely nil. The backs
were not on the man with the ball,
and when they were, their tackling
was ineffective. On one occasion the
Cardinal had a blind side defense
against an open side attack, and a try
was the necessary result, it. should
lie mentioned that Captain Mitchell
was an exception. His work can not
he criticised. But. the demoralization
was rampant and his single-handed
attempts were pitifully vain. Fur
thermore, Holman had but little
chance at this juncture in defensive
play, for the P.lue and Gold backs
during the disastrous closing of the
first half, usually found it unnecessary
to pass as far as the wing. S. Mit
chell's old wound was opened early
in the struggle, and. although not a
serious injury, it was enough to pre
vent the doing of himself justice. lie
should have been retired long before
the interval.
Stanford sustained her reputation
for "coming back" by her strong play
throughout the second half. The first
period ended. 10 to 10, after a hope
less exhibition. Nevertheless, the
Cardinal fifteen fought, so desperately

after half-time that not only was Oal-1
ifornia prevented from tallying, but
Stanford secured three additional
points. Although atariingly even, the
Cardinal team may claim a slight ad
vantage in the final period.
I)\viggins, Cerf and Blliott were
the California wonders in the hack
field. Never have more accurate kicks

touch, and his careful judgment as
regards the wind in handling kicks
was a feature. Brown, on tlie other
hand, often missed touch completely
and also allowed the wind to twice
carry the ball far over his head.
Among the Blue and (lold forwards,
it is difficult to express a preference.
They worked splendidly in perfect
unison.
Every man in the Cardinal scrum
played his game. Most in evidence
were Crawford and Dole. Holman and
Captain Mitchell were bulwarks
among the backs, and S. Mitchell was
formidable on (he attack.

has ever arbitrated a Rugby contest
on Stanford Field.
California well deserved to win
this, lier first varsity Rugby victory
in the history of the sport and her
first varsity football victory in seven
years. Her rooters serpentined Stan
ford field for the lirst time in a cele
bration of a varsity conquest, because
those rooters were represented by a
stronger fifteen than the team which
represented the root res who remained
surrounding their big red "S" across
the turf.
The game in detail follows:
First Hall.
Stanford won the toss and Craw
ford kicked off at 2:38. The kick was
short and the forwards were down
quickly, the bull being forced into
touch at California's 40. Jordan
broke through a nick, but Mitchell
kicked nearly to the side lines. A
scrum was called on California's 47.
Cass' fumble gave the Blue and Gold
15 yards: but Mitchell made up the
loss by another clever touch-finder.
Thorpe broke through in the hmse and
smothered a California passing rush.
The Cardinal pack followed quickly
and heeled out to the backs. The ball

was on the 6-yard line before the Blue
and Gold defense awoke to the situa
tion. Slight punts to Harris and Al
len caused a short delay. Cass re
ceived a clean heel-out from the en
siling scrum and passed to S. Mit
chell, who easily eluded the Blue and
Gold second five and just managed to
dive across the line for a try. A
slightly angular goal was accurately
converted by Crawford. Score: Stan
ford 5; California, 0.
Harris' kick-off re-commenced th> j
game. Holman found touch on Stan
ford's ,">(). A California passing rally
failed to gain, but Crawford unassist
ed netted the Cardinals 10 yards.
Rucking followed and Mitchell's boot
soon sent the oval out of bounds at
midfield. Two line-outs were inde
cisive. Watts marked on the visitors'
45. Captain Mitchell was slightly
liurt. Another mark was followed by
Dwiggins finding another 30 yards of
the Cardinals' goal. Crawford scrum
ed in the loose and passed lo Horton.

that she trot those lirst ten
points. It was only llarrV in

mi their line, but California stopped
any great damage. Dwiggins was
forced to touch down. Haffey went in
for Mark wart and Morris replaced
Harris. Once more an over-zealous
punt carried Dwiggins to a touch
down. Crawford returned the drop
out to California's 15. The Blue and
Cold forced a line-out on their 30.
California's stalwart defense broke up
a hackfleld advance. The forwards

marked and Dwiggins relieved beau
tifully to Stanford's 30. The Blue and
Gold's forwards gained 15. Crawford
dribbled but Dwiggins, as usual, man
aged to get his kick in. Carpenter
was injured. By several successive
line-outs, the Stanford scrum gained

The apparent and continued inferi
ority of the Cardinal backfleld's de
fense, coupled with the complete de
moralization and helplessness of this
department during the last fifteen min
utes of the first half, won for the Cal
ifornia Varsity the nineteenth annual
intercollegiate football game, which
was sturdily fought on Stanford
Field this afternoon. The final score
was 19 to 13. And the best team won.
The Blue and Gold fifteen did not
exceed, but fully lived up to its envi
able reputation. It was the best Rug
by team that has ever represented
California. The Stanford fifteen fell

below the expectations of its admir
ers only in the defensive play of (he j
backs, which was disappointingly
weak. The attack of the tennis which
the Cardinal Varsity has met in the
preliminary games was not such as to

I require a strong defense for effective
repulsion, and consequently none de
veloped. To this alone is the defeat
due.
The combination of the Cardinal
backs when on the offensive was pre
cise and accurate, slightly excelling
that, of our opponents. The advantage
j was partially counterbalanced, how
ever, by the superior ease with which
the Blue and the Gold fives and three
quarters, considered individually,
handled the ball.
All praise to the Stanford forwards
With the remainder ot the fifteen play
ing a losing game, the Cardinal pack
continued mighty and plucky until the
end. Between the opposing packs it
is impossible to choose. All of tin 1
sixteen forwards were constantly on
the ball, lighting for a gain with vig
orous force. Crawford was clearly
the best man of either scrum, but
such individual brilliancy was offsei
by the irresistible attack off several
members of the Blue and Gold for
ward division. The Cardinal pack was
consistently successful in heeling out
to the half.
The first few minutes of play were
all in favor of the Cardinal. S. .Mit
chell scored so early in the period
that the hopes of Stanford rooters
soared high. Two goals from penalty
kicks, honestly earned by California,
soon turned the tide, however, and al
though S. Mitchell lost little time in
registering again, the fortunes of the
battle had changed and this was but
a momentary rally. Neither backfield
was entirely adequate throughout the
first half, but during the last portion
of that period the resisting ability of
the Stanford five and three-quarter
line was absolutely nil. The backs
were not on the man with the ball,
and when they were, their tackling
was ineffective. On one occasion the
Cardinal had a blind side defense
against an open side attack, and a try
was the necessary result, it. should
lie mentioned that Captain Mitchell
was an exception. His work can not
he criticised. But. the demoralization
was rampant and his single-handed
attempts were pitifully vain. Fur
thermore, Holman had but little
chance at this juncture in defensive
play, for the P.lue and Gold backs
during the disastrous closing of the
first half, usually found it unnecessary
to pass as far as the wing. S. Mit
chell's old wound was opened early
in the struggle, and. although not a
serious injury, it was enough to pre
vent the doing of himself justice. lie
should have been retired long before
the interval.
Stanford sustained her reputation
for "coming back" by her strong play
throughout the second half. The first
period ended. 10 to 10, after a hope
less exhibition. Nevertheless, the
Cardinal fifteen fought, so desperately

after half-time that not only was Oal-1
ifornia prevented from tallying, but
Stanford secured three additional
points. Although atariingly even, the
Cardinal team may claim a slight ad
vantage in the final period.

touch, and his careful judgment as
regards the wind in handling kicks
was a feature. Brown, on tlie other
hand, often missed touch completely
and also allowed the wind to twice
carry the ball far over his head.
Among the Blue and (lold forwards,

They worked splendidly in perfect

Every man in the Cardinal scrum
played his game. Most in evidence
were Crawford and Dole. Holman and

has ever arbitrated a Rugby contest
on Stanford Field.
California well deserved to win
this, lier first varsity Rugby victory
in the history of the sport and her
first varsity football victory in seven
years. Her rooters serpentined Stan
ford field for the lirst time in a cele
bration of a varsity conquest, because
those rooters were represented by a
stronger fifteen than the team which
represented the root res who remained
surrounding their big red "S" across
the turf.
The game in detail follows:
First Hall.
Stanford won the toss and Craw
ford kicked off at 2:38. The kick was
short and the forwards were down
quickly, the bull being forced into
touch at California's 40. Jordan
broke through a nick, but Mitchell
kicked nearly to the side lines. A
scrum was called on California's 47.
Cass' fumble gave the Blue and Gold
15 yards: but Mitchell made up the
loss by another clever touch-finder.
Thorpe broke through in the hmse and
smothered a California passing rush.
The Cardinal pack followed quickly
and heeled out to the backs. The ball

was on the 6-yard line before the Blue
and Gold defense awoke to the situa
tion. Slight punts to Harris and Al
len caused a short delay. Cass re
ceived a clean heel-out from the en
siling scrum and passed to S. Mit
chell, who easily eluded the Blue and
Gold second five and just managed to
dive across the line for a try. A
slightly angular goal was accurately
converted by Crawford. Score: Stan
ford 5; California, 0.
Harris' kick-off re-commenced th> j
game. Holman found touch on Stan
ford's ,">(). A California passing rally
failed to gain, but Crawford unassist
ed netted the Cardinals 10 yards.
Rucking followed and Mitchell's boot
soon sent the oval out of bounds at
midfield. Two line-outs were inde
cisive. Watts marked on the visitors'
45. Captain Mitchell was slightly
liurt. Another mark was followed by
Dwiggins finding another 30 yards of
the Cardinals' goal. Crawford scrum
ed in the loose and passed lo Horton.

utes of the first half, won for the Cal
ifornia Varsity the nineteenth annual
intercollegiate football game, which
was sturdily fought on Stanford
Field this afternoon. The final score
was 19 to 13. And the best team won.
The Blue and Gold fifteen did not
exceed, but fully lived up to its envi
able reputation. It was the best Rug
by team that has ever represented
California. The Stanford fifteen fell

below the expectations of its admir
ers only in the defensive play of (he j
backs, which was disappointingly
weak. The attack of the tennis which
the Cardinal Varsity has met in the
preliminary games was not such as to

I require a strong defense for effective
repulsion, and consequently none de
veloped. To this alone is the defeat
due.
The combination of the Cardinal
backs when on the offensive was pre
cise and accurate, slightly excelling
that, of our opponents. The advantage
j was partially counterbalanced, how
ever, by the superior ease with which
the Blue and the Gold fives and three
quarters, considered individually,
handled the ball.
All praise to the Stanford forwards
With the remainder ot the fifteen play
ing a losing game, the Cardinal pack
continued mighty and plucky until the
end. Between the opposing packs it
is impossible to choose. All of tin 1
sixteen forwards were constantly on
the ball, lighting for a gain with vig
orous force. Crawford was clearly
the best man of either scrum, but
such individual brilliancy was offsei
by the irresistible attack off several
members of the Blue and Gold for
ward division. The Cardinal pack was
consistently successful in heeling out
to the half.
The first few minutes of play were
all in favor of the Cardinal. S. .Mit
chell scored so early in the period
that the hopes of Stanford rooters
soared high. Two goals from penalty
kicks, honestly earned by California,
soon turned the tide, however, and al
though S. Mitchell lost little time in
registering again, the fortunes of the
battle had changed and this was but
a momentary rally. Neither backfield
was entirely adequate throughout the
first half, but during the last portion
of that period the resisting ability of
the Stanford five and three-quarter
line was absolutely nil. The backs
were not on the man with the ball,
and when they were, their tackling
was ineffective. On one occasion the
Cardinal had a blind side defense
against an open side attack, and a try
was the necessary result, it. should
lie mentioned that Captain Mitchell
was an exception. His work can not
he criticised. But. the demoralization
was rampant and his single-handed
attempts were pitifully vain. Fur
thermore, Holman had but little
chance at this juncture in defensive
play, for the P.lue and Gold backs
during the disastrous closing of the
first half, usually found it unnecessary
to pass as far as the wing. S. Mit
chell's old wound was opened early
in the struggle, and. although not a
serious injury, it was enough to pre
vent the doing of himself justice. lie
should have been retired long before
the interval.
Stanford sustained her reputation
for "coming back" by her strong play
throughout the second half. The first
period ended. 10 to 10, after a hope
less exhibition. Nevertheless, the
Cardinal fifteen fought, so desperately

after half-time that not only was Oal-1
ifornia prevented from tallying, but
Stanford secured three additional
points. Although atariingly even, the
Cardinal team may claim a slight ad
vantage in the final period.
I)\viggins, Cerf and Blliott were
the California wonders in the hack
field. Never have more accurate kicks

touch, and his careful judgment as
regards the wind in handling kicks
was a feature. Brown, on tlie other
hand, often missed touch completely
and also allowed the wind to twice
carry the ball far over his head.
Among the Blue and (lold forwards,
it is difficult to express a preference.
They worked splendidly in perfect
unison.
Every man in the Cardinal scrum
played his game. Most in evidence
were Crawford and Dole. Holman and
Captain Mitchell were bulwarks

formidable on (he attack.

has ever arbitrated a Rugby contest
on Stanford Field.
California well deserved to win
this, lier first varsity Rugby victory
in the history of the sport and her
first varsity football victory in seven
years. Her rooters serpentined Stan
ford field for the lirst time in a cele
bration of a varsity conquest, because
those rooters were represented by a
stronger fifteen than the team which
represented the root res who remained
surrounding their big red "S" across
the turf.
The game in detail follows:
First Hall.
Stanford won the toss and Craw
ford kicked off at 2:38. The kick was
short and the forwards were down
quickly, the bull being forced into
touch at California's 40. Jordan
broke through a nick, but Mitchell
kicked nearly to the side lines. A
scrum was called on California's 47.
Cass' fumble gave the Blue and Gold
15 yards: but Mitchell made up the
loss by another clever touch-finder.
Thorpe broke through in the hmse and
smothered a California passing rush.
The Cardinal pack followed quickly
and heeled out to the backs. The ball

was on the 6-yard line before the Blue
and Gold defense awoke to the situa
tion. Slight punts to Harris and Al
len caused a short delay. Cass re
ceived a clean heel-out from the en
siling scrum and passed to S. Mit
chell, who easily eluded the Blue and
Gold second five and just managed to
dive across the line for a try. A
slightly angular goal was accurately
converted by Crawford. Score: Stan
ford 5; California, 0.
Harris' kick-off re-commenced th> j
game. Holman found touch on Stan
ford's ,">(). A California passing rally
failed to gain, but Crawford unassist
ed netted the Cardinals 10 yards.
Rucking followed and Mitchell's boot
soon sent the oval out of bounds at
midfield. Two line-outs were inde
cisive. Watts marked on the visitors'
45. Captain Mitchell was slightly
liurt. Another mark was followed by
Dwiggins finding another 30 yards of
the Cardinals' goal. Crawford scrum
ed in the loose and passed lo Horton.

by team that has ever represented
California. The Stanford fifteen fell

below the expectations of its admir
ers only in the defensive play of (he j
backs, which was disappointingly
weak. The attack of the tennis which
the Cardinal Varsity has met in the
preliminary games was not such as to

I require a strong defense for effective
repulsion, and consequently none de
veloped. To this alone is the defeat
due.
The combination of the Cardinal
backs when on the offensive was pre
cise and accurate, slightly excelling
that, of our opponents. The advantage
j was partially counterbalanced, how
ever, by the superior ease with which
the Blue and the Gold fives and three
quarters, considered individually,
handled the ball.
All praise to the Stanford forwards
With the remainder ot the fifteen play
ing a losing game, the Cardinal pack
continued mighty and plucky until the
end. Between the opposing packs it
is impossible to choose. All of tin 1
sixteen forwards were constantly on
the ball, lighting for a gain with vig
orous force. Crawford was clearly
the best man of either scrum, but
such individual brilliancy was offsei
by the irresistible attack off several
members of the Blue and Gold for
ward division. The Cardinal pack was
consistently successful in heeling out
to the half.
The first few minutes of play were
all in favor of the Cardinal. S. .Mit
chell scored so early in the period
that the hopes of Stanford rooters
soared high. Two goals from penalty
kicks, honestly earned by California,
soon turned the tide, however, and al
though S. Mitchell lost little time in
registering again, the fortunes of the
battle had changed and this was but
a momentary rally. Neither backfield
was entirely adequate throughout the
first half, but during the last portion
of that period the resisting ability of
the Stanford five and three-quarter
line was absolutely nil. The backs
were not on the man with the ball,
and when they were, their tackling
was ineffective. On one occasion the
Cardinal had a blind side defense
against an open side attack, and a try
was the necessary result, it. should
lie mentioned that Captain Mitchell
was an exception. His work can not
he criticised. But. the demoralization
was rampant and his single-handed
attempts were pitifully vain. Fur
thermore, Holman had but little
chance at this juncture in defensive
play, for the P.lue and Gold backs
during the disastrous closing of the
first half, usually found it unnecessary
to pass as far as the wing. S. Mit
chell's old wound was opened early
in the struggle, and. although not a
serious injury, it was enough to pre
vent the doing of himself justice. lie
should have been retired long before
the interval.
Stanford sustained her reputation
for "coming back" by her strong play
throughout the second half. The first
period ended. 10 to 10, after a hope
less exhibition. Nevertheless, the
Cardinal fifteen fought, so desperately

after half-time that not only was Oal-1
ifornia prevented from tallying, but
Stanford secured three additional
points. Although atariingly even, the
Cardinal team may claim a slight ad
vantage in the final period.

touch, and his careful judgment as

Among the Blue and (lold forwards,

has ever arbitrated a Rugby contest
on Stanford Field.
California well deserved to win
this, lier first varsity Rugby victory
in the history of the sport and her
first varsity football victory in seven
years. Her rooters serpentined Stan
ford field for the lirst time in a cele
bration of a varsity conquest, because
those rooters were represented by a
stronger fifteen than the team which
represented the root res who remained
surrounding their big red "S" across
the turf.
The game in detail follows:
First Hall.
Stanford won the toss and Craw
ford kicked off at 2:38. The kick was
short and the forwards were down
quickly, the bull being forced into
touch at California's 40. Jordan
broke through a nick, but Mitchell
kicked nearly to the side lines. A
scrum was called on California's 47.
Cass' fumble gave the Blue and Gold
15 yards: but Mitchell made up the
loss by another clever touch-finder.
Thorpe broke through in the hmse and
smothered a California passing rush.
The Cardinal pack followed quickly
and heeled out to the backs. The ball

was on the 6-yard line before the Blue
and Gold defense awoke to the situa
tion. Slight punts to Harris and Al
len caused a short delay. Cass re
ceived a clean heel-out from the en
siling scrum and passed to S. Mit
chell, who easily eluded the Blue and
Gold second five and just managed to
dive across the line for a try. A
slightly angular goal was accurately
converted by Crawford. Score: Stan
ford 5; California, 0.
Harris' kick-off re-commenced th> j
game. Holman found touch on Stan
ford's ,">(). A California passing rally
failed to gain, but Crawford unassist
ed netted the Cardinals 10 yards.
Rucking followed and Mitchell's boot
soon sent the oval out of bounds at
midfield. Two line-outs were inde
cisive. Watts marked on the visitors'
45. Captain Mitchell was slightly
liurt. Another mark was followed by
Dwiggins finding another 30 yards of
the Cardinals' goal. Crawford scrum
ed in the loose and passed lo Horton.

veloped. To this alone is the defeat
due.
The combination of the Cardinal
backs when on the offensive was pre
cise and accurate, slightly excelling
that, of our opponents. The advantage
j was partially counterbalanced, how
ever, by the superior ease with which
the Blue and the Gold fives and three
quarters, considered individually,
handled the ball.
All praise to the Stanford forwards
With the remainder ot the fifteen play
ing a losing game, the Cardinal pack
continued mighty and plucky until the
end. Between the opposing packs it
is impossible to choose. All of tin 1
sixteen forwards were constantly on
the ball, lighting for a gain with vig
orous force. Crawford was clearly
the best man of either scrum, but
such individual brilliancy was offsei
by the irresistible attack off several
members of the Blue and Gold for
ward division. The Cardinal pack was
consistently successful in heeling out
to the half.
The first few minutes of play were
all in favor of the Cardinal. S. .Mit
chell scored so early in the period
that the hopes of Stanford rooters
soared high. Two goals from penalty
kicks, honestly earned by California,
soon turned the tide, however, and al
though S. Mitchell lost little time in
registering again, the fortunes of the
battle had changed and this was but
a momentary rally. Neither backfield
was entirely adequate throughout the
first half, but during the last portion
of that period the resisting ability of
the Stanford five and three-quarter
line was absolutely nil. The backs
were not on the man with the ball,
and when they were, their tackling
was ineffective. On one occasion the
Cardinal had a blind side defense
against an open side attack, and a try
was the necessary result, it. should
lie mentioned that Captain Mitchell
was an exception. His work can not
he criticised. But. the demoralization
was rampant and his single-handed
attempts were pitifully vain. Fur
thermore, Holman had but little
chance at this juncture in defensive
play, for the P.lue and Gold backs
during the disastrous closing of the
first half, usually found it unnecessary
to pass as far as the wing. S. Mit
chell's old wound was opened early
in the struggle, and. although not a
serious injury, it was enough to pre
vent the doing of himself justice. lie
should have been retired long before
the interval.
Stanford sustained her reputation
for "coming back" by her strong play
throughout the second half. The first
period ended. 10 to 10, after a hope
less exhibition. Nevertheless, the
Cardinal fifteen fought, so desperately

after half-time that not only was Oal-1
ifornia prevented from tallying, but
Stanford secured three additional
points. Although atariingly even, the
Cardinal team may claim a slight ad
vantage in the final period.

touch, and his careful judgment as

hand, often missed touch completely

Among the Blue and (lold forwards,

has ever arbitrated a Rugby contest
on Stanford Field.
California well deserved to win
this, lier first varsity Rugby victory
in the history of the sport and her
first varsity football victory in seven
years. Her rooters serpentined Stan
ford field for the lirst time in a cele
bration of a varsity conquest, because
those rooters were represented by a
stronger fifteen than the team which
represented the root res who remained
surrounding their big red "S" across
the turf.
The game in detail follows:
First Hall.
Stanford won the toss and Craw
ford kicked off at 2:38. The kick was
short and the forwards were down
quickly, the bull being forced into
touch at California's 40. Jordan
broke through a nick, but Mitchell
kicked nearly to the side lines. A
scrum was called on California's 47.
Cass' fumble gave the Blue and Gold
15 yards: but Mitchell made up the
loss by another clever touch-finder.
Thorpe broke through in the hmse and
smothered a California passing rush.
The Cardinal pack followed quickly
and heeled out to the backs. The ball

was on the 6-yard line before the Blue
and Gold defense awoke to the situa
tion. Slight punts to Harris and Al
len caused a short delay. Cass re
ceived a clean heel-out from the en
siling scrum and passed to S. Mit
chell, who easily eluded the Blue and
Gold second five and just managed to
dive across the line for a try. A
slightly angular goal was accurately
converted by Crawford. Score: Stan
ford 5; California, 0.
Harris' kick-off re-commenced th> j
game. Holman found touch on Stan
ford's ,">(). A California passing rally
failed to gain, but Crawford unassist
ed netted the Cardinals 10 yards.
Rucking followed and Mitchell's boot
soon sent the oval out of bounds at
midfield. Two line-outs were inde
cisive. Watts marked on the visitors'
45. Captain Mitchell was slightly
liurt. Another mark was followed by
Dwiggins finding another 30 yards of
the Cardinals' goal. Crawford scrum
ed in the loose and passed lo Horton.

All praise to the Stanford forwards
With the remainder ot the fifteen play
ing a losing game, the Cardinal pack
continued mighty and plucky until the
end. Between the opposing packs it
is impossible to choose. All of tin 1
sixteen forwards were constantly on
the ball, lighting for a gain with vig
orous force. Crawford was clearly
the best man of either scrum, but
such individual brilliancy was offsei
by the irresistible attack off several
members of the Blue and Gold for
ward division. The Cardinal pack was
consistently successful in heeling out
to the half.
The first few minutes of play were
all in favor of the Cardinal. S. .Mit
chell scored so early in the period
that the hopes of Stanford rooters
soared high. Two goals from penalty
kicks, honestly earned by California,
soon turned the tide, however, and al
though S. Mitchell lost little time in
registering again, the fortunes of the
battle had changed and this was but
a momentary rally. Neither backfield
was entirely adequate throughout the
first half, but during the last portion
of that period the resisting ability of
the Stanford five and three-quarter
line was absolutely nil. The backs
were not on the man with the ball,
and when they were, their tackling
was ineffective. On one occasion the
Cardinal had a blind side defense
against an open side attack, and a try
was the necessary result, it. should
lie mentioned that Captain Mitchell
was an exception. His work can not
he criticised. But. the demoralization
was rampant and his single-handed
attempts were pitifully vain. Fur
thermore, Holman had but little
chance at this juncture in defensive
play, for the P.lue and Gold backs
during the disastrous closing of the
first half, usually found it unnecessary
to pass as far as the wing. S. Mit
chell's old wound was opened early
in the struggle, and. although not a
serious injury, it was enough to pre
vent the doing of himself justice. lie
should have been retired long before
the interval.
Stanford sustained her reputation
for "coming back" by her strong play
throughout the second half. The first
period ended. 10 to 10, after a hope
less exhibition. Nevertheless, the
Cardinal fifteen fought, so desperately

after half-time that not only was Oal-1
ifornia prevented from tallying, but
Stanford secured three additional
points. Although atariingly even, the
Cardinal team may claim a slight ad
vantage in the final period.

touch, and his careful judgment as
regards the wind in handling kicks

>1 Mitchell Shnit'ord (npluici.
has ever arbitrated a Rugby contest
on Stanford Field.
California well deserved to win
this, lier first varsity Rugby victory
in the history of the sport and her
first varsity football victory in seven
years. Her rooters serpentined Stan
ford field for the lirst time in a cele
bration of a varsity conquest, because
those rooters were represented by a
stronger fifteen than the team which
represented the root res who remained
surrounding their big red "S" across
the turf.
The game in detail follows:
First Hall.
Stanford won the toss and Craw
ford kicked off at 2:38. The kick was
short and the forwards were down
quickly, the bull being forced into
touch at California's 40. Jordan
broke through a nick, but Mitchell
kicked nearly to the side lines. A
scrum was called on California's 47.
Cass' fumble gave the Blue and Gold
15 yards: but Mitchell made up the
loss by another clever touch-finder.
Thorpe broke through in the hmse and
smothered a California passing rush.
The Cardinal pack followed quickly
and heeled out to the backs. The ball

was on the 6-yard line before the Blue
and Gold defense awoke to the situa
tion. Slight punts to Harris and Al
len caused a short delay. Cass re
ceived a clean heel-out from the en
siling scrum and passed to S. Mit
chell, who easily eluded the Blue and
Gold second five and just managed to
dive across the line for a try. A
slightly angular goal was accurately
converted by Crawford. Score: Stan
ford 5; California, 0.
Harris' kick-off re-commenced th> j
game. Holman found touch on Stan
ford's ,">(). A California passing rally
failed to gain, but Crawford unassist
ed netted the Cardinals 10 yards.
Rucking followed and Mitchell's boot
soon sent the oval out of bounds at
midfield. Two line-outs were inde
cisive. Watts marked on the visitors'
45. Captain Mitchell was slightly
liurt. Another mark was followed by
Dwiggins finding another 30 yards of
the Cardinals' goal. Crawford scrum
ed in the loose and passed lo Horton.

have been a change in the
score.
Coach Howe—The best side
won, as I prophesied. I said
California would win and she
did. It was lucky for Stanford
that she trot those lirst ten
points. It was only llarrV in
