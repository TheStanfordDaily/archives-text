# RIVAL ROOTING GOOD
## ENTHUSIASTIC SONGS AND YELLS CHEER TEAMS. Stanford Field Presents Gay Color Picture as Players Battle for Supremacy. 
### 
t.ayiy displaying the colors of ilie
rival colleges the largest crowd that
ever assembled on Stanford Field
gathered today to witness the annual
Rugby struggle, almost fifteen thou
sand partisans being present when the
teams trotted on the field. The intense
rivalry that had developed over this
contest, together with favorable
weather conditions accounted for the
record attendance.
The opposing rooting sections pre
sented a. spectacular apearance and
the whole stadium was bright with
banners and pennants. The Califor
nia rooters, with their Mine and Gold,
megaphones and hats, made a bril
liantly colored picture.
The Stanford rooting section was
undoubtedly the most effective of the
two, however, the white block "S"
showing to splendid advantage
against the background of red. In
the second half the colors were re
versed, the figure being red against a
background of white.
The cheering was probably the best
in the history of the rival colleges,
each side trying to outdo the other,
the entrance ol the teams upon the
field being the signal for an uproar
that lasted for several minutes.
Simultaneous with the entrance of
the Cardinal fifteen the Stanford root-
I ing section was almost hidden by the
cloud of red confetti thrown into the
air by the men on the bleachers. On
the California side a, pleasing effect
was produced by the colored stream
ers which were thrown into the air
by the Berkeley rooters. The or
ganized yelling was snappy and vig
orous, neither college showing any
advantage in this respect.
At the beginning of the second half
the Cardinal bleachers again filled
the air with red confetti and at the
same lime changed the appearance
of the big "S" by reversing the col
ors and outlining a red letter against;
a white ground. Following the game
the California hosts poured on the the
field and quickly formed a serpentine
which wound itself around and be
tween the two goal posts. This was
followed by the singing of the Cali
fornia anthem, after which the crowd
dispersed, with the exception of the
Stanford supporters who remained in
their places until after the singing
of "Hail, Stanford. Hail."
