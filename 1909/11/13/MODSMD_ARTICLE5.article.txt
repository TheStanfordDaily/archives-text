Today for the first time in its his
tory Stanford Field saw the Califor
nia rooters serpentine after the var
sity game. Defeat is a new idea to
the members of the Stanford Student
Body, long accustomed to victory. Nor
have these new sensations proven
pleasant. Stanford men have held an
enviable name for being sportsmen
who could take a victory modestly. It
is now for us to maintain a reputa
tion for being good losers. The latter
is much the better test of sportsman
ship.
At close range it is hard to discover
any good or benefit to be derived from
the outcome of the day, but in the
long run the indomitable Stanford
Spirit will rise out of the defeat
stronger and more invincible than
ever. The common purpose of mak
ing the Cardinal again victorious next
year will result in a harmonious and
unified Student Body. And if this may
be anticipated as a result of the game
today the outcome is not without re
deeming features.
To our opponents we offer the hon
ors of the day so meritoriously won.
For the men on the team who fought
so splendidly in defense of the Car
dinal we have but praise. The honor
and respect of the Student Body goes
to the players of our varsity fifteen.
