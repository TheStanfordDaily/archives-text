# VAUDEVILLE IS GOOD
## FOOTBALL SHOW TAKES WELL WITH AUDIENCE. Clever Program Produced by Musical Clubs,—Fuller and Chorus Score a Hit. 
### 
If tuneful music, bright humor and
excellent variety constitute a good
vaudeville show, the program pre
sented in Assembly Hall on Saturday
evening can be said to have been en
tirely satisfactory. .Judging the show
even by professional standards, both
the individual numbers and the pro
gram as a whole compare most fa
vorably with the offerings of the larger
vaudeville circuits. And the more
praise is due those who participated
in the program in view of the fact
that they had but a very short time
in which to prepare their numbers.
Probably the most valid criticism
that could be made of the show is
that there was too much delay be
tween the numbers of the program.
A wait of several minutes occurred be
tween every turn with the result that
the performance dragged out to a late
hour and the audience became uneasy
and in consequence interest in the
show waned perceptibly. The pro
gram was also somewhat too long, but
this objection would have had less
weight had the numbers been run off
in rapid succession.
The musical act presented by W. P.
Fuller, Jr., '10, and the chorus was
one of the most delightful numbers
on the program. "Cupid's Telephone"
and "Hello People," the two songs
featured in this turn made an in
stantaneous hit with the audience, the
chorus being recalled repeatedly. The
members of the chorus made a charm
ing picture in their dainty costumes,
and their dancing and acting was on
a par with the best professional work.
Fuller again his versatility
by the able manner in which he car
ried out his part in this act..
The sketch entitled, "It's All in the
Draw," which was written by Frank
L. Mathieu, of San Francisco, and
presented under his personal super
vision, proved to be unusually inter
esting. The sketch is well written, the
plot holding one's interest first to
last, and the acting was entirely sat
isfactory in every respect.
J. B. Beman, '12, and B. Hly, '13, com
bined clever acrobatic work with brisk
humor in their specialty, "The Tramp
and the Billikin." A feature of this
act was the original and unique way
in which Beman was made tip to
represent "Billikin," the little heathen
god of mirth. The presence of this
odd figure on the stage furnished an
element of humor, while Bly's gym
nastic work was exceptionally clever.
Bly holds the title of amateur state
champion gymnast and fully lived up
to his reputation as a premier athlete.
The Venetian Quartet entertained
most acceptably with their singing
and dancing. Several quaint Spanish
airs were sung and the art ended with
the "ca chuca" dance which met with
great favor with the audience.
The musical numbers given by the
Glee and Mandolin clubs were well
received, both organizations perform
ing in excellent style. The Glee Club
sang a medley composed of the re
frains of the latest popular songs
which was specially arranged for tlie
occasion. The Mandolin Club played i

a Hawaiian medley arranged by W.
('. Achi. '12, which included some of
the most beautiful of the Hawaiian
airs. The selection was well rendered
and added not a little to the general
effectiveness of the program.
Three humorous turns served to in
fuse life and brightness into the pro
gram. P. Ward. '12, in a black-face
specialty, drew many laughs from hi:
auditors while P. .1. Forest, '12, won

favor by his humorous monologue and
clever dancing. G. F. Morgan, '10,
and H. A. Lewis, '12. proved them
selves to lie capital comedians, their
dialogue being replete with snappy
stories and witty repartee.
The Orchestra is deserving of com
mendation for its contribution to the
evening's entertainment. The selec
tions were new,—some of them being
written for the occasion,—and were
exceptionally well rendered.
