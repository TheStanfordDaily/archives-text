# ELOQUENT SERMON HEARD.
## Reverend J. Wilmer Gresham Preaches on Subject of Great Significance in University Chapel. 
### 
"The Program of Christianity us
Set Forth by Jesus Christ," was the
subject of the sermon of the eloquent
Reverend Wilmer Gresham, rector
of Trinity Church, Sail Jose, in the
University Chapel yesterday morning.
"The essential thing for us to re
member," said the preacher, "is that
our life is a thought of God anil that
it should lie our natural disposition to
live in harmony with the Almighty."
The sermon in part is as follows:
"It is not enough to have stately
services, impressive ceremonies, and an
educated ministry. Our worship must
be translated into a motive power for
the progress of the weak. True Chris
tianity makes for efficiency and ef
ficiency depends upon certain great
spiritual principles. If we realize
this, we will not feel a remoteness
in religion, but we shall see that re
ligion is essentially a social and scien
tific success.
"The task immediately before us is
to apply Chirstianity, for at present,
there is a wide separation between its
teaching and our daily lives. Essen
tially, Christianity is intended to ex
press a close relation to material suc
cess and temporal hapipness."
