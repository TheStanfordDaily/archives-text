# Stolen Auto Is Recovered.

### 
The Pierce Arrow runabout which
was stolen from in front of the foot
ball field Saturday while the game was
in progress, was recovered yesterday.
It had been deserted in the hills be
tween Palo Alto and San Francisco
by the sixteen year-old boy who had
stolen it.
C. Heeger, '13, of Redwood City,
owner of the car, received a message
from a San Mateo garage man, that
he had seen a boy driving the ma
chine. The youngster lived in San
Mateo and was easily found. He vol
unteered the information that he had
become tired of watching the game
and decided to take a friend for a spin.
The machine was then located and
found to be uninjured except for a
smashed tail-lamp.
