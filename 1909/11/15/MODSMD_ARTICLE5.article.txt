# TO HOLD TRACK MEET
## ANNUAL FALL MEET WILL TAKE PLACE SATURDAY. Scarcity of New Material.- Captain Scott Urges Men to Turn Out For Track Work. 
### 
The annual fall track meet will be
| held next Saturday afternoon at 2:30.
•Vow thai the football season is over
Trainer Moulton can devote more of
his time to the development of the
track men. There are already Quite
I u few men doing work on the track,
but not the number that Captain Scott
and "Dad" would like to see working
out.
This fall meet will be an especial
opportunity for new men to show
their ability and Scott is very em
phatic in his statement that all the
, men capable of a good showing on
i the track are not turning out. He
wishes to urge particularly upper
! classmen, who have undoubted ability
i along this line, but who for some rea
! son or other refrain from contesting
in these meets, to enter Saturday.
Many of the old men have signified
their intention of competing, and the
meet should give an opportunity to
observe the work of the veterans, and
to watch several likely looking Fresh
men who have been showing up well
in their fall work.
The track is being watered and put
in good shape for Saturday, and more
cinders will probably be put on. The
meet will be an interclass affair, and
from the names of the men entered
competition should be keen.
Entry blanks are already posted in
the training house and any one wish
ing to enter is requested to sign im
mediately, giving his name, class and
the event he wishes to enter.
In order to overcome stiffness and
get into condition Trainer Moulton
wants all the men entering to begin
work at once. If they can not come
out. at the usual training time between
4:30 and 6, they should endeavor to
work at some other hour of the day
as from now on either "Dad" or one of
the more experienced men will be
around the training house continually
to help the novices in any way pos
sible. All the distance events will be
shortened materially on Saturday, as
the time is insufficient for the con
ditioning of the men to stand the
heavy strain.
The annual fall track meet will be
| held next Saturday afternoon at 2:30.
