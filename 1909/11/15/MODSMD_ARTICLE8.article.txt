The (all track meet which has been
planned by Captain Scott should re
ceive more attention than has been
evinced so far by the members of the
Freshman class. For men who ex
pect to go out for track work in the
spring the training and experience to
be gained by participation in this meet
will prove invaluable. At present
"Dad" can give much more individual
attention than when he is occupied
with the direction of a large squad
next semester and the benefit of this
personal coaching will mean much in
starting the spring training season.
Not alone for the Freshmen, but for
all those who lack experience in track
competition, this meet offers an oppor
tunity which should not be disre
garded. There is any amount of good
track material among the members of
the Student Body which has never
been developed simply because the
men would riot come out and give
"Dad"" a chance to size tlieni up. We
need " a larger arid stronger track
squad tiext semester and Ihe tiine lor
the men to try themselves out and
gain a litlle'vidu&ble experience is in
the ' meet on Saturday.
