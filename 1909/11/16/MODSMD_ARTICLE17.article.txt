At the football rally last Thursday
evening, one of the principal speakers
was seriously interrupted and an
noyed by persons leaving the Hall
during the progress of his remarks.
So serious was the disturbance for a
time that the address could be heard
only by those immediately near the
platform.
Those who were guilty of this breach
of etiquette were spectators in the
gallery and for the most part people
from Palo Alto who had come out to
witness the rally. In the light of the
attitude taken toward the members of
the Student Body by many of the
Palo Alto citizens, (he action of our
visitors on Thursday was scarcely
consistent. When a disturbance is
created at a public entertainment in
Palo Alto at which Stanford students
are in attendance we find the local
press filled with innumerable columns
of denunciating communications char
acterizing the students as rowdies be
reft of all gentlemanly instincts. But
these same citizens attend as specta
tors a purely undergraduate function
in Asembly Hall and seriously annoy
a speaker during his address by a
disturbance absolutely unnecessary.
Few were so greatly in haste to
return home but that it would have
been impossible to remain seated until
the close of the speech. Ordinary
politeness would call for at least that
degree of courtesy.
It is not our idea to intimate that
our friends from Palo Alto are not
desired at such student functions as
rallies, for we welcome their pres
ence and appreciate their interest; but
we would also appreciate a proper
degree of courtesy to the speakers
who are the guests of the Student
Body. That the lapse on this occa
sion was inadvertent we know, and

this consideration might further be
urged as a reason for a little more
tolerance and a little less antagonism
on the part of the Palo Alto citizens
toward the good-natured fun of the
undergraduate when it happens to
be expressed at a public entertainment
in Palo Alto.
