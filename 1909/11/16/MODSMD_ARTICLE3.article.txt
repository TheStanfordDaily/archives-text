# Will Play off Tie.
## 
### 
The question in regard to playing
off the football tie between Santa
Clara and Palo Alto High Schools was
settled yesterday at a meeting of foot
ball representatives from Santa Clara.
Palo Alto and Mountain View schools.
It was agreed that Palo Alto and Santa
Clara teams should play on Novem
ber 20. The game will probably be
played on the Stanford Field.
