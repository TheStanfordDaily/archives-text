# California Meets Vancouver Christmas.
## 
### 
As the result of the intercollegiate
contest, California this year has the
privilege of going north during the
Christmas holidays to meet the Van
couver team in competition for the
Cooper-Keith cup, and for the inter
national championship. Previous to
this year Stanford had met the North
erners in three successive years, so
that this is California's first trip to
British Columbia under similar aus
pices. Captain Byrne has already
made Ihe formal offer to the Blue and
Gold team, and without doubt the
series will be played. Stanford has
captured the cup but once, while Van
has won it twice. On this account the
series this season will be watched
with the more interest.
