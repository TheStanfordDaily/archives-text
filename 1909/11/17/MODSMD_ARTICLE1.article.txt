# PLAYERS WELL CAST
## LEADING CHARACTERS STRONG IN "ROAD TO YESTERDAY." Seward, Cohen, Lewis and Misses Ozier, Howell, Wright and Wilson to Essay Difficult Roles. 
### 
Seldom has a dramatic piece been
produced at Stanford in which the
players were as fittingly cast as is
the case with the seven actors and
actresses who are essaying the lead
ing roles in"The Road to Yesterday,"
the t'anatastic drama by the Misses
Dix and Sutherland, which will be
presented by the Masquers in Assem
bly Hall next Friday evening.
As Jack Greatorex of to-day and
Reformado Jack of the seventeenth
century, R. 11. Seward is excellently
suited. Seward's splendid physique,
professional stage presence and in
tensely dramatic voice will make the
part consistently interesting.
In the modern scenes, W. B. Co
hen's Kenelm Paulton is thoroughly
acceptable, but if is as the villainous
Strangeron of 300 years ago that he
is conspicuously good.
H. A. Lewis, as Adrian Tompkins
and Tompkins the Tapster, will add
refreshing and whimsical comedy to |
the play. His second-act scenes with
Miss M. E. Wilson, as Goody Phelps i
of the Red Swan Inn, are laughably j
clever. Miss Wilson has never been J
seen in a role that will so admirably [
convey her whole-souled humor.
Yet another success will be scored |
by Miss M. L. Ozier in the part of |
Elspeth Tyrrell, ihe "dream girl" of j
the play. Miss Ozier has the longest
feminine role of any recently written !

As Malena Leveson. Miss M. T. i
Howell is clever, and as the Gypsy !
of 1603, her dramatic intenseness and
detailed technique will lend grace
and subtleness to an unusually dif
ficult interpretation.
Miss A. Wright, the president of the j
Masquers and business manager of the
present production, will be the Elea
nor. By her diligent application
throughout the long period of rehears
ing, Miss Wright has succeeded in
winning merited praise for her rendi
tion of a relatively thankless char
acter.
The half of the house alloted to
the Bookstore has been practically
sold out since yesterday morning.
Some desirable tickets still remain,
however, at the Stanford Pharmacy.
