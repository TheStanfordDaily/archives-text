# VARSITY WILL SUFFER
## BUT FORMER VETERANS AND SUBSTITUTES STRONG. Many Members of 1909 Cardinal Fifteen to Leave.—California Team Will Lose Cerf. 
### 
With the confidence inspired by re-
I cent victory, the California student
body, assured of a largely veteran
fifteen for the season of lt> 10, is al
ready prophesying an easy and de
cisive conquest on the Rugby field
| next fall. Their greatest loss will be
('erf, while they figure that the suf
i ferings of the Cardinal team will,
j numerically, be far more material.
Ii is tine that Stanford will lose
several of her most valuable, players,
but the damag; will not be so ir
reparable as a casual observer might
expect. The Cardinal second team of
1909 was an unusually strong fifteen,
and many of this year's substitutes,
during the fall of 1910, will step into
the vacant places with surprising
adaptability.
First, the Stanford team will be
without Holnian, Crawford and Pem
berton, who leave via the four-star
route. It would be a grevious mistake
to endeavor to minimize the loss of
ihis trio. Holman is admittedly the
cleverest wing in these parts, while
Crawford holds the enviable title of
premier forward of this hemisphere.
Furthermore, the team on which Pem
-1 erton could not win a position would
indeed be a formidable one. To con
tinue, Captain Mitchell, Horton,
Thorpe and Mint urn will probably
be absent from the Cardinal line-up,
while Cheda is in doubt as to whether
he will return. In seriousness, the
loss or' Captain Mitchell fully equals
that of Crawford and Holman. Mit
chell i unquestionably the best live
eighths on the coast.
Accordingly, Brown, T. Sanborn, S.
Mitchell, Cass Dole, Fitting, and pos
siblly Cheda, may be counted on for
next season, unless unforseen circum
stances arise. Among the substitutes,
Hubbard, Woodcock, Doron and Part
ridge will be strong candidates for
the four vacancies in the middle and
rear rows, while another season's ex
perience should make the Freshmen,
Frank and Fyfe, capable varsity front
rankers. Two more Freshmen, Kern
and Worswick, should be fighting hard
for places in the backfield.
But the most encouraging fact in
estimating the prospects of the team
is the almost ecrtain eligibility and
re-appearance of scrum-half Brb, five
eighth Ganong and forward Evans—
all powerfiU members of the 1908 var
sity. it is difficult to choose among
these three men, but Erb is perhaps
the most valuable to a fifteen. At
half he has few equals.
With six or seven veterans of 1909,
and three of the season before, and
with the best second team that has
ever been formed, the student body
may feel sure of a strong fifteen for
1910. And from this calculation we
have omitted all reference to the un
deniable probability of finding good
varsity material in the class of 1914.

and three of the season before, and
with the best second team that has

1910. And from this calculation we
have omitted all reference to the un
deniable probability of finding good
varsity material in the class of 1914.
