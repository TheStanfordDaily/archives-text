# Terrace Clubs Practising Rugby.
## 
### 
Last evening on Stanford Field the
Breakers (Mul) of the Terrace played
a practice game of Rugby with the
Palo Alto High School. The result
was a lie, 3-3. On next Tuesday the
Breakers will play the Coyote Club
for a turkey dinner. Much interest
will be shown, for such men as Craw
ford, Cheda, Horton, and Brown will
participate.
