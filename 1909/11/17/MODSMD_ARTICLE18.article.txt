hi another column is an article
which demonstrates that, unless some
unforeseen situation should arise,
Stanford will have ample available
material for a strong rugby team next
season despite the anticipated loss
of some of the most capable players
of this year's varsity.
Thus at the outset the prospect is
bright for a good rugby season in 1910
and the chances good that we will
possess a team capable of wresting
a victory from California. Of the men
necessary to make up such a team
we are practically assured. Hut there
are are other factors which are fully
as requisite for a Cardinal victory as
are the men on the team or the train
ing of the team as a whole.
For no matter how good is the team
there must be a strong student spirit
and enthusiasm behind the players
or their efforts are severely handi
capped. Our greatest need in order
to insure a winning team next fall
is not good players but good support
of the players by the general Student
Body. And the time to develop the
sort of sentiment which results in
strong and loyal spirit is the present.
If we begin this semester to culti
vate and develop a strong unified
Student Body, to eliminate factional
disputes, abolish "knocking" which
has 110 useful purpose and each in
dividual work with all his endeavor
centralized 011 the one idea of the crea
tion of a spirit of unequalled loyalty,
we will have aroused, by the time of
the game next year, a Stanford Spirit
before which the California rooters
win he put to shame. And if we do
our share the men on the team will
do theirs. Right now is the time to
get together.
