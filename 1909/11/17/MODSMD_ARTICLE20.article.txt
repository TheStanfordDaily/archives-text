Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Will you kindly help to bring the
fact to the notice of those students
who have not been here in former
years, that (here is a rare opportunity
at Palo Alto of enjoying the best
organ musicâ€”Sundays at 4 p. m., at
the Congregational Church, Wednes
day at 4:30 at All Saints?
These free Public Organ Recitals
are given under the auspices of the
Organ Recital Association which is
now entering the third year of its
organization, and which has again
been fortunate in securing the serv
ices of one of the best organists and
musical scholars of this country, Dr.
1!. C. Hlodgett.
In order to make these free con
certs still more attractive and of a
direct educational value, Dr. Hlodgett
is planning for this winter a series
of eight biographical concerts, begin
ning with 15ach and ending with mod
ern masters.
The first of these concerts was given
last Sunday. The program was such
as is rarely enjoyed on this coast.
Yours very truly,
Ewald Flugel,
Chairman Organ Recital Ass'n.
