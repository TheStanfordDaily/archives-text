# Barge Returned to Boat House.
## 
### 
The nine sophomores that composed
last year's Freshman crew carried the
four-oared barge from Palo Alto to
the boat house on Lake Lagunita the
other night. The boat was used by
the four that represented Stanford in
the regatta which was held on the
last day of the Portola Festival, and
since its return from San Francisco
has been stored in Palo Alto.
