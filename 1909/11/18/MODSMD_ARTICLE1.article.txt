# TO CHANGE PLUG UGLY
## JUNIOR CLASS FAVORS SOME NEEDED REFORMS. Would Alter Character of Farce and Rush.â€”Committee to Consider Plans. 
### 
By a unanimous vote, the Junior
class at its meeting this afternoon,
declared itself in favor of changing
the general character of the annual
Plug Ugly farce and rush and ap
pointed a committee of three to con
fer with a like committee from the
present Sophomore class and the Stu
dent Advisory Committee to draw up
the necessary plans for the proposed
change.
This unanimity of sentiment is the
direct result of the public opinion of
the campus that the farces as they
have been presented for the last, lew
years have been inadequate and that
the rush is inhumane and dangerous.
It seemed also to be the sentiment
of the class that the Plug Ugly either
be held after the Pig Game or at
least a month before it. As present
constituted, it is felt that the upper
class rivalry, having such intense ex
pression so shortly before the annual
intercollegiate Rugby battle, detracts
from the spirit and support which
should be shown toward the varsity
team.
R. B. Wheeler, as chairman of the
Plug Ugly Committee, rendered the
financial report which showed the ex
penses to be $341.12 and the receipts
$21 i>.87, leaving a deficit of $12.j.2r>.
The report was accepted by the class
and a vote of thanks was given to the
committee for its efficient labors.
President W. M. Wyman has ap
pointed R. J. Miller, R. B. Wheeler,
and (}. A. Ditz, chairman, as the com
mittee to consider needed changes in
next year's Plug Ugly.
