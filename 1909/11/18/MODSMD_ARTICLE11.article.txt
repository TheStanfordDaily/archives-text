The action of the Junior class to
day in initiating a movement for the
correcting of abuses which have ap
peared at recent Plug-Ugly perform
ances is one which can not fail to be
productive of beneficial results. The
method proposed—that of an agree
ment between the two classes inter
ested in the next production—is the
most efficient and feasible manner of
getting at the problem and (Here
should be little difficulty in the formu
lation of a set of regulations which
will so govern the Plug Ugly next
year that the objectional features will
be eliminated and the tradition re
stored to. its original basis.
There is no logical excuse for a set
rush between upperclasstnen and the
aim of the joint committee should lie
to eliminate this feature. Nor is the
show a feature worthy of perpetuation
unless an extravaganza or burlesque
is produced which has some real
merit and will afford amusement to
the spectators. As such a show is
Impossible if the the actors are to be
showered with missies, it is impera
tive that the recent custom of rough
housing the show should be discon
tinued.
The original and only reasonable
purpose of the Plug Ugly was to fur
nish an evening of good-natured fun
in a unique and novel manner, at the
same time providing for the initiation
of the Junior Plugs. It is contrary to
the idea of the Plug Ugly and detri
mental to the interests of the Student
Body when class rivalry reaches such
a point that the occasion develops
into a struggle for class supremacy
and the incident of personal conflicts.
Certain features which tend to develop
this undesirable spirit are kidnapping,
breaking up the show and the set
rush on the steps to decide the ques
tion of supremacy. With these fea
tures eliminated and the two classes
striving harmoniously to secure the

enforcement of the regulations adop
ted, we anticipate a production which
will do much to restore the Plug
Ugly to its former place among Stan
ford traditions and make the evening
the scene of a good-natured clash be
tween the two upper classes which
will be a source of enjoyment to the
participants as well ns amusement to
the University public.
