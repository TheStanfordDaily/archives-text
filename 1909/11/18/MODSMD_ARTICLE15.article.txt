granting of insignia to players of the
recent varsity and Freshman football
seasons. Sixteen varsity "S" emblems,
nine German "S's," sixteen Freshman
numerals, and three sets of four
star insignia were allowed.
W. D. Fletcher, '11, reported to the
committee that 3GB rooters' hats had
been sold this year, with a net profit
of $105, part of which sum, however,
represents money received from hats
on hand from last year. It was de
cided by the meeting last night that
in the future the hiring and paying
of men for rubbing purposes in the
training house should be under the
direct supervision of the Executive
Committee. Heretofore the trainer
has had this as part of his duties.
The Committee took action also in the
matter of the wearing of second track
team insignia, passing a resolution
that it be the sense of the committee
that hereafter the German "S" is to
be worn only on track uppers.

The business of chief importance
carried out by the Executive Com
mittee last night was the official
granting of insignia to players of the
recent varsity and Freshman football
seasons. Sixteen varsity "S" emblems,
nine German "S's," sixteen Freshman
numerals, and three sets of four
star insignia were allowed.
W. D. Fletcher, '11, reported to the
committee that 3GB rooters' hats had
been sold this year, with a net profit
of $105, part of which sum, however,
represents money received from hats
on hand from last year. It was de
cided by the meeting last night that
in the future the hiring and paying
of men for rubbing purposes in the
training house should be under the
direct supervision of the Executive
Committee. Heretofore the trainer
has had this as part of his duties.
The Committee took action also in the
matter of the wearing of second track
team insignia, passing a resolution
that it be the sense of the committee
that hereafter the German "S" is to
be worn only on track uppers.
Cooper-Keith, the donor of the in
ternational rugby cup, will be com
municated with to ascertain what dis
position shall be made of the trophy,
now in the possession of Stanford. It
is not known whether the cup should
be sent to Vancouver immediately, or
until after the winner or" the Califor
nia-Vancouver series has been deter
mined.
