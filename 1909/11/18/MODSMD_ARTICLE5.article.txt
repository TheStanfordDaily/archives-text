lii Assembly Hall Friday evening
at. 8:15, the curtain will rise on the
fourth and last dramatic production
of the present semester, a sumptuous
presentation of the .Misses Dix and
Sutherland's modern four-act play,
"Tlie Road to Yesterday." The piece
is being staged by The Masquers, and
will doubtless lie a successful vehicle
to laudably present that organization
to the college public. Although The
Masquers ably assisted Sword and
Sandals with "His Excellency the
Governor" last December, this will l e
their first appearance as tin l sole pro
ducers of a play. In"The Road to
Yesterday,"the women's roles are by
far the more important, and, conse
quently, is just such ii. piece as The
Masquers desired.
As the performance will consume
almost three hours, the curtain will
go up exactly at 8:1i>, and although
I a ie corners will he seated at once
without being made to await the con
clusion of the first act, it is hoped
that as small a number as possible
will arrive after the play has once
begun.
Coach F. L. Mathieu will hold the
final dress rehearsal to-night. This
will lie devoted exclusively to the de
tailed completion of (lie scenic and
lighting effects and the incidental
music, as the characters are all thor
oughly trained and could have given
an extremely creditable performance
without more rehearsing several days
ago.
Two new drops have been painted
by (!. E. Lyon, of San Francisco, and
the same artist has spent the past
week in \ssemblv Hall, repainting
and touching up the quantity of old
. The costumes of the secom*
and their acts, which are laid early
in the seventeenth century have re
ceived special attention, and a strong
new "spot" has been secured by Elec
trician L. 11. Cochran for the produc
tion.
As for the play, it is at once novel
•ml interesting. The opening i -ccne
discloses an artist's studio in Ken
sii.gton in the year 1903. At the con
clusion of this act, a short tableau
depicts the beginning of Elspeth Tyr
rell's dream, which lasts throughout
the second and third acts. The former

of these shows the Red Swan Inn in
1603, while during the latter there is
seen Lady Elizabeth's chamber in
Strangevon Castle but a day later.

Another tableau vividly pictures the
climax of the dream, and the fourth
act finds the characters back in tl
sett ins and period of the first. The
cleverness of the theme is especially
apparent and the action intenro dur
ing ihe scenes of 300 years a'?o, when
the modern twentieth-century people
are carried back to their characters
of long ago. Ml of them really be
lieve themselves living in the olden
days, with the exception of Elspeth
who is merely dreaming and know:
the others and herself only as sue
knew them in ihe Kensington studio.
The authors take every advantage of
the exceptional opportunities offered
them by this unique plot and situa
tion.
Practically the entire cast is al
ready well known to and well liked
by Stanford playgoers. Miss Ozier
who will play the lead, has appeared

in nearly every performance of the
past eight months. As Jane in"The
Manoenvers of Jane," and as Lady
Jessica in"The Liars," Miss Wright
lias scored distinctly. Miss Wilson's
performance in "7-20-8" will long be
remembered, and Miss Howell's Mrs.
Wentworth-Bolingbroke was a tre
mendous character success. R. 11.
Seward is unquestionably as good in
straight, parts as any amateur ever
seen here, while W. B. Cohen never
tails to convincingly portray the heavy
roles. H. A. Lewis has the comedy
character, and E. Kobbe will make
his debut, in the legitimate drama.
The seat sale has been large, in
suring a crowded house. Tickets may
still be secured at the Stanford Phar
macy and the University Bookstore.
The prices are, as usual, $1.00, 75 and
r>o cents.

lii Assembly Hall Friday evening
at. 8:15, the curtain will rise on the
fourth and last dramatic production
of the present semester, a sumptuous
presentation of the .Misses Dix and
Sutherland's modern four-act play,
"Tlie Road to Yesterday." The piece
is being staged by The Masquers, and
will doubtless lie a successful vehicle
to laudably present that organization
to the college public. Although The
Masquers ably assisted Sword and
Sandals with "His Excellency the
Governor" last December, this will l e
their first appearance as tin l sole pro
ducers of a play. In"The Road to
Yesterday,"the women's roles are by
far the more important, and, conse
quently, is just such ii. piece as The
Masquers desired.
As the performance will consume
almost three hours, the curtain will
go up exactly at 8:1i>, and although
I a ie corners will he seated at once
without being made to await the con
clusion of the first act, it is hoped
that as small a number as possible
will arrive after the play has once
begun.
Coach F. L. Mathieu will hold the
final dress rehearsal to-night. This
will lie devoted exclusively to the de
tailed completion of (lie scenic and
lighting effects and the incidental
music, as the characters are all thor
oughly trained and could have given
an extremely creditable performance
without more rehearsing several days
ago.
Two new drops have been painted
by (!. E. Lyon, of San Francisco, and
the same artist has spent the past
week in \ssemblv Hall, repainting
and touching up the quantity of old
. The costumes of the secom*
and their acts, which are laid early
in the seventeenth century have re
ceived special attention, and a strong
new "spot" has been secured by Elec
trician L. 11. Cochran for the produc
tion.
As for the play, it is at once novel
•ml interesting. The opening i -ccne
discloses an artist's studio in Ken
sii.gton in the year 1903. At the con
clusion of this act, a short tableau
depicts the beginning of Elspeth Tyr
rell's dream, which lasts throughout
the second and third acts. The former

of these shows the Red Swan Inn in
1603, while during the latter there is
seen Lady Elizabeth's chamber in
Strangevon Castle but a day later.

Another tableau vividly pictures the
climax of the dream, and the fourth
act finds the characters back in tl
sett ins and period of the first. The
cleverness of the theme is especially
apparent and the action intenro dur
ing ihe scenes of 300 years a'?o, when
the modern twentieth-century people
are carried back to their characters
of long ago. Ml of them really be
lieve themselves living in the olden
days, with the exception of Elspeth
who is merely dreaming and know:
the others and herself only as sue
knew them in ihe Kensington studio.
The authors take every advantage of
the exceptional opportunities offered
them by this unique plot and situa
tion.
Practically the entire cast is al
ready well known to and well liked
by Stanford playgoers. Miss Ozier
who will play the lead, has appeared

in nearly every performance of the
past eight months. As Jane in"The
Manoenvers of Jane," and as Lady
Jessica in"The Liars," Miss Wright
lias scored distinctly. Miss Wilson's
performance in "7-20-8" will long be
remembered, and Miss Howell's Mrs.
Wentworth-Bolingbroke was a tre
mendous character success. R. 11.
Seward is unquestionably as good in
straight, parts as any amateur ever
seen here, while W. B. Cohen never
tails to convincingly portray the heavy
roles. H. A. Lewis has the comedy
character, and E. Kobbe will make
his debut, in the legitimate drama.
The seat sale has been large, in
suring a crowded house. Tickets may
still be secured at the Stanford Phar
macy and the University Bookstore.
The prices are, as usual, $1.00, 75 and
r>o cents.
