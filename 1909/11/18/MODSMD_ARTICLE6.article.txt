## SOPHOMORE COMMITTEE SELECTS "SECRET SERVICE." William Gillette's Stirring Story of the Civil War to Be Presented February 
### 
"Secret Service," perhaps the moot
successful Civil wiir time pla\ ever
written, has been selected by the Soph
omore play committee for presentation
by the members ol I!UU nexi Fe'o
ruary. This choice was reached after
a thorough reading and discussion of
plays which has lasted since the be
ginning of the present semester.
William Gillette, the author and
creator of the leading role of "Secret
Service.'' has brought many success
ful productions upon the American
stage Inn none have achieved more
of a lasting success than has this stir
ring drama of the South. So success
ful has it been and so valuable has
its copyright become that tlie privi
lege of producing it lias been confined
to but few stock companies, outside
of the original one, and the presenta
tion at Stanford will be the first time
that it has been put upon the boards
by amateur players.
The story of the play deals with the
adventures and romance of a Northern
spy in the Southern lines and gives
many opoprtunities for thrillinsr and
critical situations. The scene in the
telegraph office in the second act, in
which the hero is detected and his
message to the Federal army, tel-1-
ing of the Confederates' doings, inter
cepted, is one of the most tense and
well drawn that, has ever been con
ceived of by an American playwright.
Tryouts for parts in "Secret Serv
ice" will be conducted by the commit
tee members and Coach Frank Math
ieu, on whose hearty recommendation
the play was first considered, as soon
as manuscript parts can be obtained
from the east. This will probably be
about December 1.
