# TRACK MEN COMPETE
## TRYOUT OF NEW MATERIAL TOMORROW AFTERNOON. Trainer Moulton Dissatisfied With Number of Freshman Entries. Distance Events Shortened. 
### 
The annual fall track meet will be
held to-morrow afternoon at 2:30 and
the mile run, the first event, will he
run off promptly al lliis time. Up
to the present time only fourteen
Freshmen have signed up to compete
in the contest and Trainer Moulton
is far from being pleased with the
evident lack of interest shown by the
class of 1913. In a statement made
ihis afternoon he said, "We need men
to win from California this year and
depend on the Freshman class to give
us some good track athletes. If the
Freshmen do not turn out in the fall,
they will lose valuable experience for
ihe spring season."
All of the track events from the
440-yard dash upward will he short
ened on account of the lack of condi
tion of the men. The quarter will be
shortened to 3f>2 yards, the half mile
to OfiO yards, the mile to three laps,
and the two mile will he reduced to
live laps. The high and low hurdles
will each only be run over five hurdles.
The meet is primarily for new men
and besides the Freshmen, quite a
number of upperclassmen, new to this
branch of athletics have entered. Cap
tain Scott is anxious to have these
new men continue to work out on the
track so as to be in readiness for an
early start next semester. The meet
will start promptly at the time set and
all entrants should be on hand at
that time.
