accomplished in the way of class or
ganization unless there is a more gen
eral interest in its progress.
The present condition of the class
treasury presents a problem which

of every member of the class in
condition calls for the united sup
port of every member of the class in
order to enable 1910 to put the activi
ties of the spring semester 011 a sound
basis.
The responsibility for these ar
rangements should not be left with a
few who, because of their loyalty, are
allowed to shoulder all the work. As
a first step it behooves each member
to attend every class meeting and
accept his share of the duties de
volving from class government.
