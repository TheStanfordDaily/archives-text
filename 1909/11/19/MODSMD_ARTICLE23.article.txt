# Yale and Harvard Play To-morrow.
## 
### 
Yale and Harvard will decide this
year's football supremacy in the Har
vard Stadium at Cambridge to-mor
row. Yale is a slight favorite, due in
part to the repeated assurances of
the coaches that Captain Coy, the
most powerful member of the Blue
team, will play. It is probable, also,
that Fish, the Crimson captain, who
for a while was thought to be out of
the game, will be able to play.
Yale has a small advantage, over
Harvard in comparative scores, but
is not in any degree over-confident.
This, coupled with the fact that the
Harvard team has performed con
sistently strong the whole season, will
make what critics claim the best exhi
bition of modern football seen in
America. About forty thousand peo
ple will see the game.
