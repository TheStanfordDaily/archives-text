Word has been received from New
York telling of the sudden death of
Mrs. Frederick H. Bartlett, on .Mon
day last. Both Mr. Bartlett and bis
wife, Eleanor Pearson, were members
of the English department eight years
ago. Miss Pearson was in a sense
a pioneer Stanford woman, coining to
the coast in 1891, to help establish
a girls' school near the University.
The story of the beginning of the
school at the old Atlanta Villa has
been interestingly told in the chapter
Mrs. Bartlett contributed to "The First
Year at Stanford." After several
changes of management the school
now continues under the name of
Castilleja School. Upon leaving the
University in 1902, .Miss Pearson was
married to Dr. Bartlett, who had
meantime removed to New York City
to engage in the study and practice
of Medicine. Mrs. Bartlett leaves two
children, a daughter about four years
of age and an infant son.
