### 
Nine men have signified their inten
tion to Professor R. M. Alden, chair
man of the Faculty Committee on Lit
erary Contests, of entering the Peace
Prize Oratorical Contest to be held
on Monday evening, November 29. All
of the men have had considerable ex
perience in forensic work and are well
versed in the art of public speaking.
A close contest is expected by all
who are acquainted with the abilities
of various speakers and realize the
oratorical possibilities of such a sub
ject as "World's Peace." Fifty dol
lars will be awarded the winner by
the American Peace Society.
Those who will deliver orations are
P. J. Batkin, '10, F. H. Hilton, '11, G.
Holcomb, '11, .1. W. Houser, '10, R.
J. Miller, '11, W. R. Pittinger, '11.
W. S. Porter, '11, E. E. Tincher, '12,
and W. .1. Rockwell, '13. Batkin, the
first named, was a member of the last
intercollegiate debating team and of
his Sophomore debating team. Hilton,
Miller, and Porter have all served
upon 1911 class teams, Hilton being
a member of both his Freshman and
Sophomore teams. All three are pro
minent members of Nestoria Literary
Society. Houser was the winner of
last, year's Bonnheim.
Owing to the fact that the rules
of the contest will allow only six to
enter, it will be necessary to hold a
preliminary contest to reduce the
speakers to the proper number. The
Intersociety Debating League will
soon determine upon the proper time
for the preliminary and will have full
charge of its conduction as well as
that, of the final meeting.
