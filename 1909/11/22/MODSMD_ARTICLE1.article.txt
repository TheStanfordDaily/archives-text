# SENIORS PLAY RUGBY
## REAL AND BURLESQUE GAMES SCHEDULED FOR DEC. 4. Interclass Champions to Play Chosen Fifteen.—Ludicrous Contest Will Follow. 
### 
Two rugby games, one a real exhi
bition and the other an absurd bur
lesque, will replace the Senior Circus
as a suitable method of raising funds
to assist the Class of 1910 in meet
ing the many expenses which it must
necessarily incur during its eighth and
last semester in college. The con
tests are scheduled for decision on
Stanford Field on the afternoon of
Saturday, December 4.
In the first game, 1910 will face all
comers. A fifteen selected from the
graduates as well as from the three
other classes will he pitted against
the interclass champions. All the best
rugby players in college have con
sented to appear in the line-up, assur
ing an exciting and close struggle.
The football men in the classes of
1908 and 1909 will be used on both
teams, the object being to secure two
evenly matched-fifteens. The aid of
Coach Presley will be enlisted in an
endeavor to so arrange the line-ups
that a battle royal will be witnessed.
The second "game" will be of a dif
ferent character. Burlesque will
reign supreme. Thirty picked veterans
—if not of rugby—will participate.
The score and a half of lusty heroes
will be escorted to the field in huge
tally-hos and thus saved the long
walk in order that they may be the
stronger for the clash, which will be
to the death. The contending hosts
will be led on to glorious victory or
ignominious defeat by two notable
warriors, whose valiancy is matchless
and not to be described by sordid
words. They are none other than the
Messrs. G. F. Morgan and F. L. Guer
ena. These fearless generals assem
bled but to-day in a council of war,
and with the lofty courtesy which be
tokens a bloody struggle, grimly dis
cussed the strife in a manner befitting
the Hague Tribunal. One detail the
brave officers were hours in conclud
ing. Even in the face of dire threats
of physical violence officiously prom
ised him by General Guerena. Gen
eral Morgan bravely insisted that four
"halves" of three minutes each should
constitute the battle. Not so Gen
eral Guerena. Four halves of two
minutes each was his rigorous ulti
matum. Skilfully scenting fear in his
adversary, General Morgan gave in
not. And so it was agreed. One army
will engage in the eight-minute con
flict, while the other will battle for
the full twelve.
