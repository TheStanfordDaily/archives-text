The election of Kenneth Dole as
captain of the 1910 varsity rugby team
is a well merited reward for the
services which he has rendered Stan
ford athletics. Two years on the
varsity fifteen have demonstrated his
ability as a player while as a fighter
he has few equals. Enjoying the re
spect of his team-mates and the confi
dence of the entire Student Body, he
is eminently qualified to lead the Car
dinal to a victory in 1910.
