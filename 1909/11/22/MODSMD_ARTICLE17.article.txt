# PLAY WELL RECEIVED
## "CALL OF BOHEMIA" STAGED BY SOCIAL DRAMATIC CLUB. Professor H.D. Gray Scores Success With Local Production of His Emotional Drama. 
### 
On the evening of Saturday, Novem
ber 20, at the Playhouse in Palo Alto,
the Social Dramatic Club presented a
play entitled "The Call of Bohemia,"
by Professor H. 1). Gray, of the Eng
lish department. In subtlety of char
acterization. size of cast, and com
plexity of staging, the play was far
more ambitious than the average
drama chosen for amateur production;
yet in spite of its inherent difficulties
the performance passed off with a
smoothness and consistent finish that
reflected great credit on Professor
Gray, who coached as well as wrote
the play.
The interest of the play centers
about Mr. and Mrs. Philip King, the
former a man of volatile, romantic
disposition, who seeks in dangerous
flirtation for sympathy that he does
not think his wife completely supplies;
the latter a woman with capacity for
intense feeling and scope of emotional
feeling quite unsuspected by her hus
band. The wife leaves her home to
live out under an assumed name, the
artistic side of her nature, pretending
to her associates and to her husband,
who follows her, that she is exhibit
ing a morbid case of dual personality.
From the vantage ground of this sec
ond personality she brings her hus
band to a realization of the possi
bilities in their wedded life, and pre
pares him for their restoration to each
other at the end of the play.
The exacting role of Alice, Mrs.
King, was admirably sustained by
Mrs. Matzke, and Mr. Bonnell played
the difficult part of Philip King with
marked sympathy and power. Singu
larly finished was the acting of Mrs.
S. B. Mitchell in the part of Myrtle
Langford. Dr. Hemingway was sym
pathetically interpreted by Mr. Mur
ray. and Richard Storey by Mr. Se
ward. Mrs. Rend tor ff and Miss Helen
Campbell portrayed most acceptably
the newly rich mother and daughter
at the coming-out. ball.
