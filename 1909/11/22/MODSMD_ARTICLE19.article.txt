# PLAY A HUGE SUCCESS
## "ROAD TO YESTERDAY" BETTER THAN PREDECESSORS. Consistently Clever Acting and Exceptionally Unique Piece Is Winning Combination. 
### 
"Variety is the spice of life," —even
in drama; for the tremendous success
of "The Road to Yesterday"was due as
much to the unique idea upon which
the play was based as to the extremely
clever and convincing acting of pract
ically the entire cast. Unanimous
opinion places the performance at the
top of the long line of Stanford pro
ductions.
In the hands of amateurs, the second
and third acts were dangerous ex
periments. Whether the scenes of
It! 03 were to be characterized as
cheaply melodramatic or tensely emo
tional depended wholly upon the work
of the cast. The fact that none of the
audience even thought of them as the
former is the highest compliment that
can be payed to the ability of the
players. The scenes were convin
cingly atmospheric.
To Miss Ozier, Miss Howell, W. B.
Cohen and R. H. Seward the individual
laurels must go. In a part at once
the longest, most versatile and most
highly emotional which has ever been
essayed by a Stanford actress, Miss
Ozier gave a performance which would
do credit to a professional of more
than ordinary renown. Her Elspeth
Tyrrell will long remain a wonderful
interpretation of an excessively dif
ficult role.
With few opportunities as Mrs. Leve
son of 1903, Miss Howell concentrated
her efforts on the Gypsy of three hun
dred years ago. As Black Malena. she
was the finished actress, artistic and
true to the part in every detail. Her
voice was beautifully strong and ac
curately characteristic. In her every
gesture she was the real Gypsy. The
handling of the dagger was but an
instance of Miss Howell's studious at
tention to minor points.
\V. B. Cohen's performance was a
revelation, totally eclipsing his pre
vious efforts. As the villainous and
quite melodramatic Lord Strangevon,
Cohen was absolutely convincing, and
yet never once did he overdo the part.
On the other hand, his humanely ten
der portrayal of the role of Kenelm
Paulton was equally convincing.
As the big and handsome Refor
mado Jack, R. H. Seward's work easily
ranked with that of the stars of the
piece. In the second and third acts
he was delightfully thrilling and fin
ished. Seward was too restrained in
the fourth act, however, and his clos
ing scene with Elspeth was thoroughly
lacking in the necessary tenderness.
As Eleanor, a difficult role utterly
unsuited to her personality and such
as she had never before attempted,
Miss Wright gave a creditable per
formance.
Miss Wilson's Harriet Phelps and
Goody Phelps were the best things
she has yet done. Not one of her
lines failed to "get over." Miss Wil

son was especially effective in the first
act.
Miss Workman was excellent as the
witch. In her every scene she dis
played true dramatic genius.
Adequate as Will Leveson, E. Kobbe
was cleverly subtle as Will wi' the
Feather. His second-act scene with
Miss Howell was tensely dramatic and
one of the best in the play.
Although very good as Tomkin the
Tapster, H. A. Lewis failed to grasp
the real meaning of the part of
Adrian.
"The Road to Yesterday"was given
by The Masquerers, who mounted the
play in a complete and detailed man
ner. F. L. Mathieu, who coached the
piece, once more demonstrated his
ability to stage an artistic, convincing,
finished and smooth amateur perform
ance. The comparatively small house
was largely due to the fact that a
cantata was given by the public
schools of Palo Alto on the same
evening. But despite its size, no more
appreciative and responsive audience
ever greeted a college production.

As the big and handsome Refor
mado Jack, R. H. Seward's work easily
ranked with that of the stars of the
piece. In the second and third acts
he was delightfully thrilling and fin
ished. Seward was too restrained in
the fourth act, however, and his clos
ing scene with Elspeth was thoroughly
lacking in the necessary tenderness.
As Eleanor, a difficult role utterly
unsuited to her personality and such
as she had never before attempted,
Miss Wright gave a creditable per
formance.
Miss Wilson's Harriet Phelps and
Goody Phelps were the best things
she has yet done. Not one of her
lines failed to "get over." Miss Wil

son was especially effective in the first
act.
Miss Workman was excellent as the
witch. In her every scene she dis
played true dramatic genius.
Adequate as Will Leveson, E. Kobbe
was cleverly subtle as Will wi' the
Feather. His second-act scene with
Miss Howell was tensely dramatic and
one of the best in the play.
Although very good as Tomkin the
Tapster, H. A. Lewis failed to grasp
the real meaning of the part of
Adrian.
"The Road to Yesterday"was given
by The Masquerers, who mounted the
play in a complete and detailed man
ner. F. L. Mathieu, who coached the
piece, once more demonstrated his
ability to stage an artistic, convincing,
finished and smooth amateur perform
ance. The comparatively small house
was largely due to the fact that a
cantata was given by the public
schools of Palo Alto on the same
evening. But despite its size, no more
appreciative and responsive audience
ever greeted a college production.
"Variety is the spice of life," —even
in drama; for the tremendous success
of "The Road to Yesterday"was due as
much to the unique idea upon which
the play was based as to the extremely
clever and convincing acting of pract
ically the entire cast. Unanimous
opinion places the performance at the
top of the long line of Stanford pro
ductions.
In the hands of amateurs, the second
and third acts were dangerous ex
periments. Whether the scenes of
It! 03 were to be characterized as
cheaply melodramatic or tensely emo
tional depended wholly upon the work
of the cast. The fact that none of the
audience even thought of them as the
former is the highest compliment that
can be payed to the ability of the
players. The scenes were convin
cingly atmospheric.
To Miss Ozier, Miss Howell, W. B.
Cohen and R. H. Seward the individual
laurels must go. In a part at once
the longest, most versatile and most
highly emotional which has ever been
essayed by a Stanford actress, Miss
Ozier gave a performance which would
do credit to a professional of more
than ordinary renown. Her Elspeth
Tyrrell will long remain a wonderful
interpretation of an excessively dif
ficult role.
With few opportunities as Mrs. Leve
son of 1903, Miss Howell concentrated
her efforts on the Gypsy of three hun
dred years ago. As Black Malena. she
was the finished actress, artistic and
true to the part in every detail. Her
voice was beautifully strong and ac
curately characteristic. In her every
gesture she was the real Gypsy. The
handling of the dagger was but an
instance of Miss Howell's studious at
tention to minor points.
\V. B. Cohen's performance was a
revelation, totally eclipsing his pre
vious efforts. As the villainous and
quite melodramatic Lord Strangevon,
Cohen was absolutely convincing, and
yet never once did he overdo the part.
On the other hand, his humanely ten
der portrayal of the role of Kenelm
Paulton was equally convincing.
