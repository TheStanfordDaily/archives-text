# SECURE FAMOUS PLAY
## SWORD AND SANDALS ID GIVE "THE MAN FROM HOME." Tarkington and Wilson's Comedy Will Receive First Performance Out Eastern Cities. 
### 
The first time on any stage save in
the principal cities of the East and
the first, performance by any hut the
original company headed by William
Hodge: such will be the distinction
of "The Man From Home," the four
act play which Sword and Sandals
will produce early in the spring se
mester. The staging of the piece at
Stanford is made possible only through
the generous permission of the auth
ors, Booth Tarkington and Harry Leon
Wilson, and their managers, Liebler
& Co., who, by personal intercession,
were persuaded to allow the produc
tion. They also kindly forwarded the
"working manuscript" to Sword and
Sandals in order to insure a detailed
and accurate performance of the play
which ran for one full year in Chi
cago and then opened at the Astor
Theatre, New York, where it packed
the house for more than fifteen months.
The first Chicago performance oc
curred on September 29, 1907, the
closing New York performance early
in the present month. The company
remained almost intact during the
whole of this practically continuous
run, and among the many successful
productions on Broadway during the
season of 1908-9. "The Man from
Home" was generally conceded pre
eminence.
The piece is now playing the prin
cipal cities east of Chicago. This tour
will consume at least one year. In
all probability, several months at least
will elapse before the play will be
come available for stock production,
and consequently great good fortune
attended Sword and Sandals in its
ability to procure the right of per
formance.
"The Man From Home" is a spark
ling comedy of Hoosier wit with an
Italian background. The scenes are
laid in picturesque Sorrento, and the
plot primarily concerns the always in
teresting question of an international
marriage. The central figure is Dan
iel Voorhees Pike, of Kokomo, In
diana. Booth Tarkington, one of the
authors, owes his fame chiefly to
the realistically true and quaintly
humorous Hoosier characters which
lie lias created in his widely read
novels, notably "The Gentleman from
Indiana" and"The Conquest of Ca
naan." And Pike is but another hu
man picture from this finished wri
ter's pen. Tarkington is also the au
thor of "Monsieur Beaucaire," the
dramatization of which gave the late
Richard Mansfield one of his most
successful vehicles.
Although Pike is the most impor
tant character, the other leading roles
are not minimized in an endeavor to
make him stand out the more promin
ently, as is the case with the average
modern play. On the contrary, each
character, irrespective of its relative
importance, is as vividly portrayed.
In the only company which has ever
produced the piece William Hodge was
the Indianan and Miss Olive Wynd
hani. of Broadway fame, was the lead
ing woman.
