# TO START NEW CUSTOM
## SENIOR MEN TO INAUGURATE SENIOR SMOKERS. Committee Appointed to Conduct Rugby Games.â€”Quads to Be Disposed Of. 
### 
The Seniors took an important step
to-day towards inaugurating a new
custom at Stanford when at the meet
ing of the class held this afternoon,
the president of the class, H. E. Reed,
'10, appointed a committee of five to
look into the matter of establishing
Senior Smokers. This idea is not a
new one as class smokers are already
an established custom at some uni
versities. The idea in establishing
this new custom here is that informal
gatherings of this knid will enable
the men to get better acquainted with
each other and will be instrumental
in forging stronger bonds of friend
ship among the men of the class. The
committee named for the purpose of
launching Senior Smokers was com
posed of L. H. Cochran, '10, B. W.
Upson, '10, J. E. Shelton, '10, H. C.
Warren, '10, and E. M. Leaf, '10,
chairman. This new gathering to
gether of the Senior men will not in
terfere with the custom inaugurated
last year by the Senior class of Sen
ior singing by the men of the class.
Committees were named to take
charge of the Rugby revival which has
been set for December 4, when, under
the auspices of the Senior class, n
substitute for the Senior Circus of
past years will be presented in the
form of a rugby game between a
picked team and the Senior team
which carried off the interclass lau
rels. Following this will be a bur
lesque game in which most of the
well-known campus comedians and
wags will appear in low comedy roles
for the amusement of the crowd on
the bleachers.
Emphasis was placed on the neces
sity of the members of the class
getting behind this new departure in
money-raising stunts if it is to be a
success and doing all they can to
advertise and help the affair along.
Four young ladies: Miss M. L. Ozier.
'10, Miss M. T. Howell, '10, Miss F. P.
Metzner, '10. and Miss M. H. James
have been asked to cooperate with a
committee composed of W. P. Fuller.
Jr., '10, T. C. Henry, '10, H. Rittigstein.
'10. M. M. Mitchell, '10, and K. L. Mac
kenzie, '10, chairman in taking charge

The class authorized the Quad
Board to dispose of 70 volumes of
the 1910 Quad that remain unsold
from the edition of SOO issued las'
spring in whatever way appears most
advantageous to them for the benefi'
of the class.
