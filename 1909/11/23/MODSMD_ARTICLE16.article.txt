# TRAINING TO CONTINUE ON TRACK
## "Dad'" Moulton to Be at the Training Quarters the Greater Part of Day. 
### 
From now on until the end of the
semester "Dad" Moulton will be at
the track from 11 to 12 o'clock in the
morning and from 2:30 to (! in the
afternoon to oversee the work of the
men. This will be a great advan
tage to the Freshmen and other new
track aspirants, for since a few of the
old men will be out, "Dad" can give
his undivided attention to the others.
Training will continue until the mid
dle of December if the weather per
mits, the men being given the benefit
of careful attention on the part of
Moulton and Captain Scott. These
opportunities should induce quite a
number of men to continue training.
