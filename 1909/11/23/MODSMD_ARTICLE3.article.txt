# PLUG UGLY TRADITION RETAINED
## Under Regulations Proposed by Advisory Committee Custom Will Continue, with Certain Objectionable Features Eliminated. 
### 
That the Plug—Ugly will continue as
a tradition at Stanford and not be
abolished as a result of the objection
able features of the recent production,
has been assured by the Student Af
fairs Committee in a communication
recently received by the Advisory
Committee of the University Confer
ence. In the future, however, the
: Plug-Ugly will be conducted under
regulations which have been drawn
up by the Advisory Committee with a
view of eliminating the features
which have proven a tendency to di
vert the Plug-Ugly from its original
purpose.
Previous to the last production
there was considerable discussion as
to the best means of preventing the
recurrence of incidents of the year
before and the entire control of both
poster and show was turned over to
the Advisory Committee as being best
able to direct the production.
The Plug-Ugly as produced, how
ever, was not such as to receive the
approbation of the Student Body and
there was a strong sentiment in some
quarters favoring the abolition as a
j custom.
As the body is responsible for the
control of the Plug Ugly, the Advisory
Committee then submitted a report
which advocated the continuance of
the tradition and proposed a set of
regulations which it was believed
would make future productions an oc
casion of general enjoyment devoid of
the objectionable features of recent
Plug-Ugly. Under these regulations
the Faculty Committee has expressed
its willingness to allow the continu
ance of the Plug Ugly.
The report of the Advisory Commit
tee is embodied in the following:
Stanford University, Cal.
Mr. A. B. Clark,
Chairman Faculty Student Affairs
Committee.
Dear Sir:
Having assumed entire control of
the Junior Plug-Ugly, and feeling re
sponsible for the future regulation of
this college custom, we wish to make
the following statement:
While the Plug-Ugly this year was
wholly unsatisfactory and entirely dif
ferent from the original idea of this
tradition, yet we feel that the custom
is worthy of perpetuation if properly
conducted. The Plug-Ugly was orig
inally the occasion of an evening of
merriment and good-natured rivalry
and not. as recently developed, an
excuse for a set rush between the
upper classes.
Fn order to restore the traditional
; Plug-Ugly and place the custom upon
a proper basis by eliminating the ob
jectionable features which have devel
oped within the last few years, we
deem the following regulations neces
sary :
First: Before permission will be
granted for the production of either

poster or show the Student Advisory
Committee must be assured that both
are worthy of production. In order
to ascertain this it will be necessary
for the Junior Committee to submit
both manuscripts for inspection. The
productions of the past few years have
been far below the standard originally
set, and unless a more creditable bur
lesque is staged, there is no justifica
tion for the continuance of this fea
ture.
Second: The show must proceed
without interruption by the Seniors.
The growing tendency toward "rough
housing" the show culminated this
year in a most distasteful exhibition,
and unless this feature is entirely
eliminated, it will be impossible to
stage a burlesque worthy of produc
tion. The Senior class will be held
responsible for the execution of this
regulation.
Third: The feature of one class at
tempting to prevent the other from
effecting an entrance upon the Quad
should be discontinued. This custom
is a recent development, and, in addi
tion to being dangerous, tends to
change the plug smashing into a set
rush.
Fourth: The practice of kidnapping
is so entirely unjustifiable that it is
unequivocably condemned. Such an
incident takes time from college
work, results in constantly increasing
retaliation and develops ill feeling
which tends to embitter the class
rivalry at the time of the Plug-Ugly.
Fifth: The Student Advisory Com
mittee reserves the right to call off
the Plug-Ugly at any time the regula
tions are violated or the committee
feels that circumstances have arisen
which would make the production un
desirable. We beileve that the ob
jectionable features of this year's show
and rush were the result of conditions
and tendencies for which no individ
ual or individuals were directly re
sponsible, and we feel that with the
above regulations we would be able
to control the situation in the future.
Respectfully,
Student Advisory Committee.
The following letter from Profes
sor Clark to the Advisory Committee
in answer to the above communica
tion, sets forth the position of the Stu
dents Affairs Committee and gives as
surance of the continuance of the
Plug-Ugly as a custom under the pro
posed regulations:

set, and unless a more creditable bur
lesque is staged, there is no justifica
tion for the continuance of this fea
ture.
Second: The show must proceed
without interruption by the Seniors.
The growing tendency toward "rough
housing" the show culminated this
year in a most distasteful exhibition,
and unless this feature is entirely
eliminated, it will be impossible to
stage a burlesque worthy of produc
tion. The Senior class will be held
responsible for the execution of this
regulation.
Third: The feature of one class at
tempting to prevent the other from
effecting an entrance upon the Quad
should be discontinued. This custom
is a recent development, and, in addi
tion to being dangerous, tends to
change the plug smashing into a set
rush.
Fourth: The practice of kidnapping
is so entirely unjustifiable that it is
unequivocably condemned. Such an
incident takes time from college
work, results in constantly increasing
retaliation and develops ill feeling
which tends to embitter the class
rivalry at the time of the Plug-Ugly.
Fifth: The Student Advisory Com
mittee reserves the right to call off
the Plug-Ugly at any time the regula
tions are violated or the committee
feels that circumstances have arisen
which would make the production un
desirable. We beileve that the ob
jectionable features of this year's show
and rush were the result of conditions
and tendencies for which no individ
ual or individuals were directly re
sponsible, and we feel that with the
above regulations we would be able
to control the situation in the future.
Respectfully,
Student Advisory Committee.
The following letter from Profes
sor Clark to the Advisory Committee
in answer to the above communica
tion, sets forth the position of the Stu
dents Affairs Committee and gives as
surance of the continuance of the
Plug-Ugly as a custom under the pro
posed regulations:
Stanford University, Cal.
To the Student Advisory Committee.
Stanford University.
Gentlemen:
The Committee on Student Affairs
is willing that the Plug-Ugly Show
shall be held next year under the
regulations adopted by the Student
Advisory Committee.
Very truly yours,
A. B. Clark.
Chairman Student Affairs Committee.
That the Plug—Ugly will continue as
a tradition at Stanford and not be
abolished as a result of the objection
able features of the recent production,
has been assured by the Student Af
fairs Committee in a communication
recently received by the Advisory
Committee of the University Confer
ence. In the future, however, the
: Plug-Ugly will be conducted under
regulations which have been drawn
up by the Advisory Committee with a
view of eliminating the features
which have proven a tendency to di
vert the Plug-Ugly from its original
purpose.
Previous to the last production
there was considerable discussion as
to the best means of preventing the
recurrence of incidents of the year
before and the entire control of both
poster and show was turned over to
the Advisory Committee as being best
able to direct the production.
The Plug-Ugly as produced, how
ever, was not such as to receive the
approbation of the Student Body and
there was a strong sentiment in some
quarters favoring the abolition as a
j custom.
As the body is responsible for the
control of the Plug Ugly, the Advisory
Committee then submitted a report
which advocated the continuance of
the tradition and proposed a set of
regulations which it was believed
would make future productions an oc
casion of general enjoyment devoid of
the objectionable features of recent
Plug-Ugly. Under these regulations
the Faculty Committee has expressed
its willingness to allow the continu
ance of the Plug Ugly.
The report of the Advisory Commit
tee is embodied in the following:
Stanford University, Cal.
Mr. A. B. Clark,
Chairman Faculty Student Affairs
Committee.
Dear Sir:
Having assumed entire control of
the Junior Plug-Ugly, and feeling re
sponsible for the future regulation of
this college custom, we wish to make
the following statement:
While the Plug-Ugly this year was
wholly unsatisfactory and entirely dif
ferent from the original idea of this
tradition, yet we feel that the custom
is worthy of perpetuation if properly
conducted. The Plug-Ugly was orig
inally the occasion of an evening of
merriment and good-natured rivalry
and not. as recently developed, an
excuse for a set rush between the
upper classes.
Fn order to restore the traditional
; Plug-Ugly and place the custom upon
a proper basis by eliminating the ob
jectionable features which have devel
oped within the last few years, we
deem the following regulations neces
sary :
First: Before permission will be
granted for the production of either

poster or show the Student Advisory
Committee must be assured that both
are worthy of production. In order
to ascertain this it will be necessary
for the Junior Committee to submit
both manuscripts for inspection. The
productions of the past few years have
been far below the standard originally
set, and unless a more creditable bur
lesque is staged, there is no justifica
tion for the continuance of this fea
ture.
Second: The show must proceed
