# BATTLE TO BE FIERCE
## SENIOR RUGBY GAME TO BE CONTEST OF STRONG MEN. Captains Announce Line-up of Teams Which Are to Meet in Burlesque Strife December 4. 
### 
After great deliberations and a
careful picking over of the entire ath
letic portion of the student body,.
Captains Morgan and Guerena have
announced the names of the men who
are to struggle for victory in the exhi
bition rugby match to be given by the
Senior class December 4. Stanford
Field has been the place of many a
fierce conflict, and many a mighty
athlete has fought upon it, but none
of these compare with the strenuous
strife which will be waged or the
superb bunches of muscle which will
caper on its sod a week from Satur
day.
A glance at the list of names will
show the wise choice of the captains,
for not a man lias been omitted who
might by his presence lend strength
and dignity to the occasion. Captain
Morgan will lead his men to victory
attired as "Tottie Twinkle Toes," while
his formidable opposing leader, Guer
ena, will meet the onslaught in the
dress of "Buster Brown." Backing
up these men will be Harry Robert
son and Chas. Leach, who are said to
fear nothing but graduation, and with
them will appear Will Pemberton and
W. P. Fuller, Jr., hand in hand.
The affair is not to be an extem
poraneous one for all the players will
carefully prepare their parts. Wood
ville and Lewis have planned skits
and Cochran and Cohen are said to
have arranged a play which, figura
tively speaking, will bring down the
bleachers. Among other humorous
stunts will be a discussion of the
boating question by J. Huston, the
drawing of a crowd by Virg Bellows,
and a public writing of an editorial
by Hails. The whole game is expected
to last for half an hour and between
the halves, Rittigstein will give in
structions to the umpire.
The names of the players, chosen
so far are as follows:
G. F. Morgan, F. L. Guerena, R.
Woodville, P. N. Leach, H. Robert
