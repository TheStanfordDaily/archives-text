The plan proposed at the Senior
class meeting to-day for the institu
tion of Senior Smokers is one which
should be adopted with the approval
of the entire class. The idea fur
nishes an excellent means of bringing
the Seniors together and enabling the
cultivation of a closer acquaintance
between the members. As a means of
fostering class spirit and promoting
friendship, the Smokers offer an ex
cellent opportunity and the inaugu
ration oi* the custom should be at
tended with marked success.
