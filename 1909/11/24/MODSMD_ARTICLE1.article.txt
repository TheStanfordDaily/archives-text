# ROWING CLUB ACTIVE
## MEMBERSHIP TO BE THROWN OPEN FRIDAY. Racing Dates Procured for Next Semester with Washington and Southern Crews. 
### 
From the time that rowing was abol
ished by the Executive Committee
early in October little has been said
of the plans of the crew squad for the
ensuing year, but with the formation
of the Lake Lagunita Boat Club the
men who are interested in seeing row
ing continued as a sport have gone
ahead perfecting their plans for next
season.
The boating club will admit as mem
bers any member of ihe Student Body
011 or after Friday until December I.
when an initiation fee will be charged
all those who after that time desire
to become members of the new organ
ization. Every one who joins will be
given an opportunity to row as it will
be arranged so that all will have their
chance to get out on the water.
The club already anticipates adding
at least two more boats to their pres
ent fleet in order that more people at
one time can get out on he lake. As
soon as the boating season begins
next semester and the new members
of the club have been taught how to
handle an oar the club will be divided
up into a large number of crews
which will compete with each other
at. monthly regattas which the club
intends to hold. This will let every
one get a chance to show what he
can do and it will be from the showing
made at these races that the crew will
be picked to represent the whole club
in any contests which the club may
enter.
As a result of their effort to secure
an annual regatta the Lake Lagunita
Rowing Club became an official mem
ber of an association composed of the
San Diego Rowing Club and the Los
Angeles Athletic club by the accept
ance of an offer which has been ex
tended to the Lagunita Club by the
southern clubs. Negotiations have also
been in progress between Victor Zed
nick. graduate manager of the Uni
versity of Washington, and the local
club with the prospect of a race with
the northern crew next season.
As things stand at present, these
races are practically an assured fact.
The race with the southern club will
be rowed during Easter vacation when
the picked eight from the ranks of
the Lagunita club will go south to
meet the crews of the other clubs in
the association. The southern clubs
have arranged so that the financial
burden of the trip will fall on their
shoulders rather than on the local
club.
The date which has been chosen for
the northern race will not conflict in
any way with university work, as the
event is at present scheduled for May
27. The University of Washington
will guarantee a sufficient sum to
cover the expenses of the trip and
while our men will be in Seattle the
fraternities the University of Wash
ington's campus have agreed to pro
vide for them.
