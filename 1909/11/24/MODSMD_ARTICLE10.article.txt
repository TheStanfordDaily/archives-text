### 
Manager Burbank has received a
communication from the University of
Oregon requesting a. baseball date for
next, spring, as that university ex
pects to make a southern trip for the
purpose of meeting Stanford. Califor
nia. Santa Clara and other institutions
around the Bay. The Chicago "White
Sox." who played here last year, also
wish a date this season, but as that
game was not a financial success last
year the prospect of one this year is
doubtful.
