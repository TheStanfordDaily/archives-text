Every member of the Senior class
should give his heartiest support to
the committee in charge of the bur
lesque Rugby contest in order to make
the affair an unqualified success. A
pointed reason for promoting the pro
ject is the fact that several hundred
dollars must be raised by 1910 in
order to pay Commencement Week
expenses and that the burlesque, if
properly patronized, promises to nei
a sum which will go a long way to
ward meeting The anticipated outlay.
But aside from any mercenary mo
tives the plan should be encouraged
because it has many possibilities as
a student body custom. The aboli
tion of the Senior Circus deprived the
University of an institution which has
a considerable place in the college
life of other universities, and if this
burlesque can be made sufficiently
successful there is no reason why it
should not replace the Circus as a reg
ular custom. Such an affair should
furnish an occasion of much whole
some sport and enjoyment for the
whole college and would be a de
cided addition to Stanford tradition
Whether or not the game will prove
worthy of becoming a university cus
tom will depend on the support the
plan receives and consequently it is
the duty of every Senior to give the
project liis most enthusiastic aid.
