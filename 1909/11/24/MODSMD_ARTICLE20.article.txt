# MAY HOLD TRYOUTS NEXT WEEK.
## Competition for Parts in Sophomore Play "Secret Service," Planned for Near Future. 
### 
As the manuscript of "Secret Serv
ice," the recently selected Sophomore
Play, is expected to arrive from the
east some time during Thanksgiving
vacation, tryouts for parts in the play
will probably be held toward the last
of next week. When the date has
been definitely settled, announcement
will be made in time for those who in
tend to try out to prepare for the
competition.
Every member of the class is urged
and expected to show interest in the
class production by trying for a part,
and, as there are many characters in
the play of widely different types,
every one has an equal opportunity
to secure a role. The cast or charac
ters includes young men and old men,
ingenues and elderly ladies, soldiers,
colored servants, and others typical
of a war-time play, and gives splendid
opportunity for the manifestation of
hitherto unknown talent.
Coach Frank L. Mathieu has sug
gested that those who intend to try for
dialect parts practice some dialect
work for use in the tryout.
