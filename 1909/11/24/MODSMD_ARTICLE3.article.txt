## STUDENTS MAY APPEAR IN BUT ONE PLAY A SEMESTER. Student Affairs Committee Bars Reappearance of Thespians During Same College Session.

"No student shall he allowed to ap
pear itt more than one dramatic per
formance in one semester."
Stanford dramatics were seriously
affected by the above resolution which
was passed by the Faculty Committee
on Student Affairs in the regular
weekly session of that body that wa>
held this morning. This ruling is to
take effect immediately although Ihe
action will apply more specifically to
next semester, as no more theatri
cals will be presented during the
remainder of the present semester.
With reference to the action of his
committee, Chairman A. B. Clark says:
"The purpose of this resolution is to
protect some members of the Student
Body who are in danger of having
too great demands made upon them.
These demands are such that they
seriously affect the scholarship of
those who take part in more than one
performance. This ruling will also
allow many who have not heretofore
taken part in dramatics to enter the
atricals."
This action, according to the inter
pretation of Chairman Calrk, will ap
play only to those plays and operas
that will be staged in Assembly Hall.
The action applies particularly to any
productions that will necessitate ex
tensive preparations and a period of
continued rehearsing. This does not
include small productions that may
be given by any club or group of play
ers as an evening's entertainment in
private residences.
As plans have already been made for
the presentation of several plays dur
ing the coming semester this action
by the Student Affairs Committee
means that all thespians who con
template trying out for any produc
tions must make a choice as to which
one they wish to appear in. To ap
pear in any capacity in the cast of
one play, will bar the performer
from taking part in any theatrical
production that may be given during
the remainder of the semester.
The Student Affairs Committee, be
sides their regular routine work, gave
permission to the Eneina Club to
hold a dance in the "Play House"in
Palo Alto on next Friday evening.
