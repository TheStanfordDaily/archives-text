The Sophomore Cotillion Committee
is hard at work perfecting and com
pleting their plans for the annual
second-year dance, which will be held
on the evening of December 3 in En
cina Hall. The limited number of
tickets are selling rapidly and all
intending purchasers are urged to buy
theirs at once in order to be sure of
them. Tickets may be obtained any
morning at. the Law steps between the
hours of 11:15 and 12:15.
The decorative scheme to be em
ployed in beautifying the hall is be
ing kept a profound secret and is said
to be something entirely original
which is expected to far surpass any
thing ever attempted in this line at
Stanford. The programs are to be in
keeping with the decorations and are
exceedingly attractive in appearance.
The cover design is very clever and is
handsomely painted.
The music for the evening will be
furnished by a full orchestra under
the leadership of Brohaska of San
Jose which insures its excellence. The
program of dances will include the
latest popular music as well as some
of the older favorites.
The Student Affairs Committee has
granted permission to the Cotillion
Committee to hold two afternoon
practices in Encina Hall between the
hours of 4:30 and 0. Monday and
Wednesday afternoons of next week
have been selected as the dates on
which the dances may become familiar
with the mazes of the German figures.
