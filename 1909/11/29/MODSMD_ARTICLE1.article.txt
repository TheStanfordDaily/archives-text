With the exception of a few minor
parts the cast is now complete for
Swords and Sandals' production of
Tarkington and Wilson's famous tour
act comedy, "The Man from Home."
The personnel of the players insures
a thoroughly adequate and finished
presentation of the most ambitious
piece ever attempted here, every part
being filled by an actor who has
achieved signal success in past pro
ductions. With a comedy which lias
met with phenomenal success in the
East, with a cast of experienced and
talented players and with a coach
of proved ability, "The Man from
Home" promises to be. t>y far, the
most notable dramatic production in
the history of the Stanford stage.
Daniel Vorhees Pike, the title role
of "The Man from Home," will be
assumed by W. P. Fuller, '10, who has
already scored many times in Stan
ford dramatics. Pike's character is
powerfully drawn and is one of the
most delightful of Tarkington's In
dianians. A true Hoosier, placed in
an Italian atmosphere, in the midst
of aristocrats he still maintains his
native characteristics and the part af
fords many splendid opportunities for
humorous situations. Fuller is emi
nently fitted to give an artistic inter
pretation of the part, having demon
strated his ability in many former
producions.
R. IT. Seward, '12, will take the role
of the Grand Duke Vasili, who is
traveling through Italy incognito.
Seward has taken a prominent part in
dramatics during the time he has been
in college. He has demonstrated his
versatility and. is well qualified to
play the part of the polished man of
the world.

will be taken by R. Woodville, 11.
Woodville is well-known for his work
in the parts of Mr. Rargess in '7-20-8,"

be depended upon to give a satisfac
tory interpretation of the part of the
titled English adventurer.
G. F. Morgan. '10, who will appear
as the Honorable Almeric St. Aubyn,
needs no introduction to Stanford
theatre-goers, having taken leading
roles in many of the recent produc
tions. Almeric is a foppish, inane,
young Englishman, who is seeking an
alliance with an heiress and this dif
ficult part will be well taken care
of by Morgan.
L. N. George, '10. will be seen as
Tvanoff, the betrayed convict, while
T. A. De Molt will appear as Horacr
f!ranger-Simpson. Roth actors have
appeared to advantage in former pro
ductions. Mariano, the Italian, maitrc
d'hote], is a part that is eminently
suited to C. A. Christin. As Tam
borini in "7-20-8," and Feste in
"Twelfth Night," Christin lias shown
unusual ability in the Interpretation
of the characters of foreigners.
Miss M. L. Ozier, *10, will appear
in the role of Ethel Granger-Simps<.n,
nu American heiress who is seeking
a European title. Miss Ozier's tri
umphs on the Stanford stage have

movt finished pieces of acting ever
seen here.

French adventuress, will be taken by
Miss M. T. Howell, '10. Miss Howell
