ill the Daily Palo Alto oL' Wednes
day last was published a rule adopted
by the Student Affairs Committee
which prohibits any person from par
ticipation in more than one dramatic
production in a semester. The rule
as issued is inflexible and absolute in
its wording.
Such a rigid rule seems entirely un
necessary in dealing with the dram
atic situation. If, as the Committee
evidently believes, there are features
in the conduct of local dramatics
which need revision, it would have
been much more productive of satis
factory results if the committee had
conferred with those interested in
dramatics before making such an ar
bitrary decision. Such a conference
would undoubtedly have suggested to
the committee some more feasible
method of correcting the objectionable
features it sought to obviate, if not
demonstrating that part, at least, of
these objections were more imagin
ary than real.
If too active a participation in
dramatics affects the scholarship of
individual thespians it does not seem
just to exclude all others from partici
pation in more than one production.
Such a rule is manifestly unfair as il
holds the most callable down to the
standard of the person of the de
ficient scholarship. It would seem
that the application of tlie probation
rule which prohibits participation in
Stanford activities while under schol
arship restrictions would be sufficient
to correct any possible tendency to
ward a neglect of university work,
without the promulgation of a special
rule for this particular activity. Mere
overwork caused by too frequent ap
pearances in dramatics on the part of
an individual is not logical ground for
lessening the activity of those who are
able to do the additional work. Such
cases call for individual attention.
The application of such a rule can
not fail to materially effect the char
acter of the productions staged in
Assembly Hall, and will result in a
lower standard of both plays and
talent on the Stanford stage. For
none of those of recognized ability ca;:
be expected to accept a minor part in
a play, thereby ending any oppor
tunity to assume a leading role in a

subsequent production. The situation
will thus resolve into a series ol
plays with one or two stars witii
mediocre supporting talent instead of
the well balanced casts which have
achieved the present high standard or
our amateur siage. This failure to
differentiate between leading parts and
minor .characters seems one of the
most glaring defects of the rule. In
its working out it forces the plays
coming last in a semester to be staged
with entirely new talent if the earlier
ones have already made their selec
tions.
Another point is that participation
in more than one play, ii the two were
separated by any considerable length
of time, would not affect the time or
the strength of the actor as if the
productions were produced in close
succession. But in the rule there Is
no provision in regard to (he lack or
proximity of the performances.
A consideration which should bear
weight in a discussion of this ques
tion is the advantage to the individ
ual of participation in dramatics.
There is good reason to argue that
the time spent in rehearsal and study
of a play, such as is produced here
under the direction of a competent
coach, is fully as beneficial to the
participant as is the work in a course
in the English department on dramatic
interpretation or history which would
require much more time. For the ac
tual time spent, it would seem that the
beneficial results are fully as great
as in any other activity or a univer
sity course.
Thus it appears that the rule as
published is unnecessarily harsh in
view of the situation. Believing that
the Committee took this action without
a full appreciation of is effects and
possibly with an exaggerated idea of
the need for regulation we would urge
reconsideration. It is our opinion
that a conference between the Student
Affairs Committee and those interested
in dramatics would result in a rule
which would be effective without being
stringent to the point of injustice.

just to exclude all others from partici
pation in more than one production.
Such a rule is manifestly unfair as il
holds the most callable down to the
standard of the person of the de
ficient scholarship. It would seem
that the application of tlie probation
rule which prohibits participation in
Stanford activities while under schol
arship restrictions would be sufficient
to correct any possible tendency to
ward a neglect of university work,
without the promulgation of a special
rule for this particular activity. Mere
overwork caused by too frequent ap
pearances in dramatics on the part of
an individual is not logical ground for
lessening the activity of those who are
able to do the additional work. Such
cases call for individual attention.
The application of such a rule can
not fail to materially effect the char
acter of the productions staged in
Assembly Hall, and will result in a
lower standard of both plays and
talent on the Stanford stage. For
none of those of recognized ability ca;:
be expected to accept a minor part in
a play, thereby ending any oppor
tunity to assume a leading role in a

subsequent production. The situation
will thus resolve into a series ol
plays with one or two stars witii
mediocre supporting talent instead of
the well balanced casts which have
achieved the present high standard or
our amateur siage. This failure to
differentiate between leading parts and
minor .characters seems one of the
most glaring defects of the rule. In
its working out it forces the plays
coming last in a semester to be staged
with entirely new talent if the earlier
ones have already made their selec
tions.
Another point is that participation
in more than one play, ii the two were
separated by any considerable length
of time, would not affect the time or
the strength of the actor as if the
productions were produced in close
succession. But in the rule there Is
no provision in regard to (he lack or
proximity of the performances.
A consideration which should bear
weight in a discussion of this ques
tion is the advantage to the individ
ual of participation in dramatics.
There is good reason to argue that
the time spent in rehearsal and study
of a play, such as is produced here
under the direction of a competent
coach, is fully as beneficial to the
participant as is the work in a course
in the English department on dramatic
interpretation or history which would
require much more time. For the ac
tual time spent, it would seem that the
beneficial results are fully as great
as in any other activity or a univer
sity course.
Thus it appears that the rule as
published is unnecessarily harsh in
view of the situation. Believing that
the Committee took this action without
a full appreciation of is effects and
possibly with an exaggerated idea of
the need for regulation we would urge
reconsideration. It is our opinion
that a conference between the Student
Affairs Committee and those interested
in dramatics would result in a rule
which would be effective without being
stringent to the point of injustice.
ill the Daily Palo Alto oL' Wednes
day last was published a rule adopted
by the Student Affairs Committee
which prohibits any person from par
ticipation in more than one dramatic
production in a semester. The rule
as issued is inflexible and absolute in
its wording.
Such a rigid rule seems entirely un
necessary in dealing with the dram
atic situation. If, as the Committee
evidently believes, there are features
in the conduct of local dramatics
which need revision, it would have
been much more productive of satis
factory results if the committee had
conferred with those interested in
dramatics before making such an ar
bitrary decision. Such a conference
would undoubtedly have suggested to
the committee some more feasible
method of correcting the objectionable
features it sought to obviate, if not
demonstrating that part, at least, of
these objections were more imagin
ary than real.
If too active a participation in
dramatics affects the scholarship of
individual thespians it does not seem
just to exclude all others from partici
pation in more than one production.
