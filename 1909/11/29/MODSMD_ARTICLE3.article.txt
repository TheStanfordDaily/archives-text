# 1910 WILL START TRADITION.
## First of Series of Smokers This Year Set for Next Thursday Evening at 9. 
### 
The class of 1910 will inaugurate
a new epoch in Senior Class history
when it holds the first of series of
class smokers next Thursday evening
at 9 o'clock. Senior smokers have
played a large part in the life of
other universities, and it is with a
desire to start the same tradition here,
and to foster a strong class spirit that
the coming smoker is to be held. The
Senior men of Phi Delta Theta fra
ternity have offered to entertain the
1910 classmen at this smoker and the
gathering will be held at their house.
A program of especially interesting
numbers has been made out. including
musical skits, monologues and other
vaudeville acts, after which the as
sembled classmen will partake of in
viting refreshments.
Smokers such as the one planned
are to be held at least once a month,
and it is hoped that this year will
see the tradition firmly established.
