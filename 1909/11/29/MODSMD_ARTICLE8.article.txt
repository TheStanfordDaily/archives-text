# UNDECIDED ABOUT DIAMOND.
## Whether Stanford Field or Varsity Grounds Will Be Used for Baseball Is Uncertain. 
### 
On what field the games of the ap
proaching baseball season will be
played is as much an uncertainty this
year as it was last fall. Two alter
natives are open to the manager,
either to lay out a diamond on the
turf of Stanford Field, as was at
tempted last spring, or again make
use of the old varsity diamond. In
the latter case very extensive improve
ments will have to be made to get
the grounds in shape for play. The
field will have to be laid out anew to
conform more closely with the regu
lations of the game, since this was
a matter of some discussion follow
ing the intercollegiate series with
California last April. The base lines,
as the diamond now exists, are too
close to the bleachers, and will have
to be changed materially. It will be
necessary also to build new stands
to replace those now on the field,
these being judged unsafe. Stanford
Field was not a success last spring
as a diamond, since the ground could
not be put into condition during the
rainy season, when the majority of
the contests are scheduled, and it is
doubtful whether it can be used this
year. Definite plans will be made next
week, when the Faculty Athletic Com
mittee meets Manager Burbank. Some
field will be decided upon and put into
condition for the opening of the sea
son about January 15.
