# BURLESQUE PLANS COMPLETE.
## Rugby Teams Show Enthusiasm at Meeting.â€”Palo Alto Merchants Will Give Prizes. 
### 
The Burlesque Rugby Teams met last
Wednesday and were given the plans
of the Burlesque Rugby Committee.
From the enthusiasm shown at the
meeting it appears that much inter
est is being taken in the game.
The management has announced that
prizes ranging from one to ten dol
lars in value will be given by Palo
Alto merchants for the most unique
stunts and ludicrous costumes. This
has aroused much competition and
the game should deselose some very
humorous stunts.
President Reed has appointed a com
mittee composed of Miss Metzner, Miss
Ozier, Miss .lames and Miss Howell,
chairman. The girls are now work
ing on which should be quite a sensa
tion, when sprung at the game.
"Dutch" Roth the student body ad
visor and Gym. Instructor Maloney
have been added to the squad of the
burlesquers. Captain Guerena and
Morgan say they will announce the
line-up of their teams in a few days.
