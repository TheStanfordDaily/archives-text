# RESTRICTS FUNCTIONS
## NEW REGULATION LIMITS SOCIAL EVENTS TO WEEK END. Student Affairs Committe Seeks to Prevent Infringement on University Work. 
### 
"After this date the hours scheduled
for lectures, recitations, and labora
tory work, and evenings afters
o'clock except Friday and Saturday
must he kept free from all student
social functions, formal or informal,
including dances, banquets and enter
tainments."
"Health and scholarship are the two
factors that caused the Student Af
fairs Committee to take this action.
1 believe that health is probably tlie
more significant of the two. This reg
ujation does not affect rallies as they
do not take great preparation. Meet
ings of departmental societies or honor
organizations generally are also not
included. Investigation before this
rule was passed by the Committee dis
closed little or no opposition to such
a regulation. In fact the sentiments
of the students seemed to be in favor
of this move. This idea is not a new
one and, although never a written law
before, has always been considered in
force. The reason of this action be
ing taken at this time is because the
social events this semester have been
held more than ever before during
the mid-week. Our hope is that this
regulation will leave four nights a
week absolutely free for study."
The above regulation was issued to
day by the Student Affairs Committee
after being considered at. several meet
ings of that body. In effect it makes
no radical change on the present con
duct of student activities as it includes
only such events as are purely social
and does not interfere with the reg
ular meetings of departmental organ
izations or honor societies. The mid
week dances and banquets will be
practically the only events which are
directly prohibited.
The wording is general and its ap
plication will be largely a matter of
interpretation, but Professor Clark has
expressed his opinion that the regula
tion was to prevent the mid-week so
cial functions and not to interfere
with the meetings of organizations or
societies. As worded, however, the
rule will exclude afternoon functions
as well as dances or banquets. It is
understood that the former have prov
en more objectionable even than tiie
mid-week dances and that one of the
primary objects of the rule was to
eliminate the afternoon receptions and
teas which have become quite fre
quent.
When interviewed upon the subject
of the rule and the reasons for its
adoption. Professor Clark was reti
cent. but in answer to questions, spoke
as follows:
"In the interpretation of the rule
Ihe evenings before holidays will be
considered the same as week-ends and
will be open for social events. This
also applies to the evenings before
vacations.
The meetings of department organ
izations are considered as semi-educa
tional and are not included in the
restrictions, while the meeting of
honor societies and similar clubs will
not be interfered with unless some
further action is deemed necessary.

It is not the intention to class ral
lies as social functions and Professor
Clark has stated that Smokers to
visiting teams and such other acts of
courtesy to visitors would not. be pro
hibited under this regulation.
As arrangements for the Senior
Smoker on Thursday night had been
completed before this publication of
the rule, there will be no objection
offered to this event."

before, has always been considered in
force. The reason of this action be
ing taken at this time is because the
social events this semester have been
held more than ever before during
the mid-week. Our hope is that this
regulation will leave four nights a
week absolutely free for study."
The above regulation was issued to
day by the Student Affairs Committee
after being considered at. several meet
ings of that body. In effect it makes
no radical change on the present con
duct of student activities as it includes
only such events as are purely social
and does not interfere with the reg
ular meetings of departmental organ
izations or honor societies. The mid
week dances and banquets will be
practically the only events which are
directly prohibited.
The wording is general and its ap
plication will be largely a matter of
interpretation, but Professor Clark has
expressed his opinion that the regula
tion was to prevent the mid-week so
cial functions and not to interfere
with the meetings of organizations or
societies. As worded, however, the
rule will exclude afternoon functions
as well as dances or banquets. It is
understood that the former have prov
en more objectionable even than tiie
mid-week dances and that one of the
primary objects of the rule was to
eliminate the afternoon receptions and
teas which have become quite fre
quent.
When interviewed upon the subject
of the rule and the reasons for its
adoption. Professor Clark was reti
cent. but in answer to questions, spoke
as follows:
"In the interpretation of the rule
Ihe evenings before holidays will be
considered the same as week-ends and
will be open for social events. This
also applies to the evenings before
vacations.
The meetings of department organ
izations are considered as semi-educa
tional and are not included in the
restrictions, while the meeting of
honor societies and similar clubs will
not be interfered with unless some
further action is deemed necessary.

It is not the intention to class ral
lies as social functions and Professor
Clark has stated that Smokers to
visiting teams and such other acts of
courtesy to visitors would not. be pro
hibited under this regulation.
As arrangements for the Senior
Smoker on Thursday night had been
completed before this publication of
the rule, there will be no objection
offered to this event."
