The regulation published to-day by
the Student Affairs Committee is not
one which should meet with any op
position on the part of the Student
Body. In general it only makes def
inite what has been understood and
for a large part observed in the eon
duct of student activities. It does
not interfere with organization or so
ciety meetings or rallies and there
can be little logical objection to the
elimination of the mid-week dance or
reception which interrupts university
work and is of 110 benefit to the par
ticipant. The week-ends and the eve
nings before holidays and vacations
should be suflicient for such occa
sions.
