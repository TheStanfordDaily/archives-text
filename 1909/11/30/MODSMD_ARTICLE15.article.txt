# INTERESTED IN PLAY
## MANY SOPHOMORES TO TRYOUT FOR "SECRET SERVICE." 139 Men and Women Sign Up for Competition for Parts in 1912 Production. 
### 
That the class is greatly interested
in "Secret Service," 1912's Sophomore
play, was shown to-day, when one
hundred and thirty men and women
signified their intention of trying out
for parts. As to-day Avas the first
time that the members of the class
have been asked to list their names
in the competition, it is probable that
before the day of the tryouts, this
number will be greatly increased. As
it now stands, however, it is a greater
number than has ever come out for
any previous plays.
The Sophomores who signed up
listened to a discussion of the roles
and a brief summary of the play given
by some of the Play Committee mem
bers to-day in room 214, in order that
they might decide for which parts
they deemed themselves best suited.
The ingenue part of "Caroline Mit
ford," and the man's juvenile role of
"Wilfred Varney," proved the most
popular as twenty-nine names were
submitted as candidates for each.
As soon as mimeograph copies or
the parts can lie obtained for use in
the tryouts. Coach Mathieu will be
gin the work of selecting the cast.
The time of this will be determined
as soon as possible and will be an
nounced in these columns.
All who were not present at the
discussion of the play to-day but who
wish to try out, are asked to hand
their names to C. L. Schaupp, '12, at
the Phi Gamma Delta house.
