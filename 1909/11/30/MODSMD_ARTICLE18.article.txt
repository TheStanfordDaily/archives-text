# MILLER WINS CONTEST
## STRONG ADDRESSES GIVEN FURTHERING CAUSE OF PEACE. Five Speakers Give Orations for Edward Berwick, Jr. Peace Prize of $50. 
### 
It is doubtful if there has ever been
a more even contest on the Campus
than was the "Edward Berwick, Jr.,
Peace Prize Contest," held last eve
ning in the chapel. Each of the live
speakers presented a carefully ar
ranged and well prepared address
furthering the cause of international
peace. It was a most auspicious and
promising opening for a new contest.
R. J. Miller, '11, was declared the
winner. The other speakers did not,
in the opinion of the judges, present
such strong orations so vitally im
bued with the cause of peace, and so
suggestive as to the means of obtain
ing international pacification.
G. F. Morgan, '10, representing the
Intersociety Debating League presi
ded. After a few remarks explaining
the nature of the contest, its scope and
the general plan of the donor, he
called on the first speaker, 11. J. Mil
ler, '11.
After a few introductory words Mil
ler outlined his plan of action. He
showed that both disarmament and in
ternational arbitration of disputes
were futile; that disarmament would
not be successful, and that no nation
could abide by the decisions of a board
of foreign judges. He then advanced
the opinion that peace could only be
accomplished by the proper education
of the people in order that they them
selves may act as judges. He said
further that a new standard of pat
riotism. one of ideality rather than
carnage, must be instilled into the
people. After the education in the
home we must have the education or
the press and the church to higher
standards of ideal patriotism. In clos
ing he showed that if this could be
accomplished, the nations of the
world would inevitably merge and
then international peace would be a
reality.
The next speaker was W. R. Pit -
tinger. '11. He pointed out that from
the time of Alexander to the present
day, war was invariably the result or
the striving for commercial suprem
acy. Pittinger advocated the widening
ot the powers of the International
Board of Arbitration through national
arbitration agreements.
The third speaker was F. H. Hilton,
'11. He showed in a clear, concise
way that the evils of war are con
stantly on the increase. But he an
nounced it as his belief that the liar
to peace in the past, due to the lack
of understanding between the nations,
was fast disappearing, and that in
the near future, if not now, arbitra
tion was possible.
The fourth speaker was J. D. Hau
ser. '10. He showed in a clear way
tha r mutual aid has been a factor in
evolution from earliest pre-historic
times, and that on era of universal
neace would follow as a. result ot in

ternational rather than individual
harmony. He closed by showing that
true patriotism involves a sane serv
ice, rather than the wild service of
war, and that mutual support rather
than any struggle is the greatest evo
lutionary factor in the growth of man.
G. Holconib, '11, the last speaker,
went deeply into the work of The
Hague Conferences. He explained
their organization, and showed what
had been done since IS9S by The
Hague Tribunal.
The judges of the contest were Pro
fessor Young of the Economics de
partment, Professor Bonnell of the
English department and Professor
Shaw of the History department.
