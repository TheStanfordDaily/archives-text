and the opposing aggregation the "All
Stars" is composed of the best foot
ball talent in the three lower classes,
and should be able to make the first
game a close and interesting rugby
battle.
The two burlesque teams as picked
by Captains Morgan and Guerena con
tain the names of all the well-known
fun-makers in college and these are
surety enough that the clash will be
as clever and humorous as has been
claimed, and that fun will not be con
spicuous by its absence.

offered prizes which are to be dis
tributed to the burlesque players
whose costumes and stunts bring the
most laughs from the bleachers.
