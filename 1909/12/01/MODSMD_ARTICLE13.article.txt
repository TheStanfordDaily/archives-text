The amendment to the previous
ruling on dramatics which is published
to-day by the Student Affairs Commit
tee is the result of a conference yes
terday between ihe Committee and rep
resentatives of the two dramatic socie
ties. it is not a permanent retraction
of the original regulation, but a tem
porary provision passed in order to
assist the Senior play next semester
which would be seriously handicapped
by.the enforcement of the rule after
plans were so far under way for the
dramas of the spring semester.
The amendment will materially as
sist in the production of a creditable
senior play and for this concession we
are duly grateful. We do not, how
ever, alter our opinion that, ihe rule
is unwarranted in dealing with tlie
dramatics situation and that a regula
tion more equitable would at the same
time eliminate what the committee
deems the evils of the present con
duct of local dramatics.
The temporary concession will re
lieve the situation next semester, if
the petitions are granted as intimated,
but there seems small cause for so
round-about a method of accomplishing
this end. In view of the reasons which
actuated the committee in adopting
the regulation, as advanced at the
conference yesterday, it appears that
the action is far more stringent than
is demanded under existing conditions.
