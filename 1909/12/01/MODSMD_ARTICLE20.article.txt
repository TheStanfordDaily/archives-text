# TRYOUTS ON SATURDAY
## TO BEGIN SELECTION OF CAST FOR "SECRET SERVICE." Competitors to Be Given Sections of Roles To-morrow for Use in Tryouts. 
### 
That the first preliminary tryouts
for the cast of "Secret Service," the
coming Sophomore play, should be
held next Saturday morning, was the
decision reached by the Play Commit
tee at a meeting held last night.
Mimeograph copies of certain sec
tions of all the roles are being pre
pared and these will be given to those
who have already handed in their
names for the completion as well as
those who now wish to do so in room
214 at 1:15 to-morrow.
Candidates will be expected to learn
or thoroughly familiarize themselves
with these parts so that on Saturday
morning, Coach Mathieu can conduct
the work of choosing the cast as rap
idly and efficiently as possible. As
such a great number of sophomores
are out for parts it is possible that,
all the preliminary work can not be
done Saturday morning and so some
may be postponed until the early part
of next week. Further details of the
tryouts will be given at the meeting
to-morrow.
The Committee has announced that
for the sake of fairness, no one who is
trying for a part in the play, will be
allowed to privately read the manu
script.
