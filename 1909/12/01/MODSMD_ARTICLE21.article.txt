The result of the last week's play
in the Fall Chess Tournament which
has been in progress for the last two
months, has shown that R. L. Vaugn,
'12, is considerably in the lead in his
record of games. He has played five
games and lost uone. Next in line
is H. S. Tracy, '11, who has played
three games without losing any, and
third is R. W. Poindexter, '10, who
has only lost one out of a total of
three games. Vaugn who is in the
lead lias developed appreciably this
semester and will be in good line as
Varsity material when the final try
outs occur next semester.
It is urged by those in charge of
this tournament that all who have
not paid their assessment do so im
mediately, for if it. is not paid they
will he disqualified from entering the
varsity tryouts in the spring. This
assessment can either he paid to E.

W. M. Davidson, '10, at .".49 Cowper
