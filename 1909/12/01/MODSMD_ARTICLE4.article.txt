## TEMPORARY EXCEPTION MADE TO DRAMATIC RULE. To Assist Senior Play Committee Will Allow Two Appearances in Individual Cases. 
### 
The Committee on Student Affairs
is coin inced tlnit Hie regulation lim
iting participation in dramatics to one
event per semester, will work to the
advantage of all the interests con
cerned better tiiau any substitute that
has been suggested. In view, however,
of certain special considerations
which have been presented, the Com
mittee is prepared to make exceptions
in favor of the senior play of next
semester.
After February I, 1909, applications
for waiving the rule in the case of
particular individuals will he con
sidered.
A. B. CLARK, Chairman.
Snch was the result of a conference
between the Student Affairs Commit
tee, the Student Advisory Committee
and representatives of the dramatic
societies. The practical effect of this
concession will be that those who
participate in"The Man from Home,"
the Sword and Sandals' play, may
petition the committee for permission
to appear in the senior production.
Although the committee makes no
promise as to the number of such
petitions which will be granted, Pro
fessor Clark states that the action
is merely for the benefit of the 1910
play and intimates that, a reasonable
conclusion to be drawn from the state
ment is that a large proportion of
the cast of "The Man from Home"
would be allowed to accept roles in
the esenior production, should they
be needed, and provided that no un
foreseen circumstances arise to make
it inadvisable to grant such permis
sion in certain individual instances.
In short, the action will permit, bot.ii
the Sword and Sandals and the senior
play to i>e presented with practically
the best casts available.
The discussion of the rule took
place yesterday afternoon. The Mas
querers were represented by Miss M.
T. Howell, '10, and Miss M. L. Ozier,
'10, while T. A. De Bolt, '10, and
W. P. Fuller, Jr., '10, appeared on
behall of Sward and Sandals. Several
modifications of the present rule were
promulgated, but none seemed to meet
the ideas of the Student Affairs Com
mittee, the members of which are of
the firm belief that the present ruling
is the most efficacious one possible.
The present concession was granted
only after it was pointed out that be
cause of dramatic plans already made
for next semester, the effect of the
restriction, passed so late, would be
unduly harsh.
