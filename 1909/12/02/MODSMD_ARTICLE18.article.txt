# DRAW FOR ORDER IN TRYOUT.
## Sophomores Draw Lots for Turn to Tryout for "Secret Service," Saturday Morning. 
### 
Copies of certain sections of all the
roles of "Secret Service" were dis
tributed to-day to the large number
of Sophomores who are out for parts.
These are to be learned for use in the
preliminary tryouts which Coach
Mathieu is to conduct Saturday morn
ing.
In order that the candidates might
not have to wait for any length of
time for their turn to tryout, numbers
were drawn at the meeting to-day for
order of precedence. Those holding
numbers between one and twenty arc
to show their ability at 9:00 Saturday
morning in room 214. Numbers be
tween twenty and forty are asked to
be on hand at 10:00, and numbers
between forty and sixty will be ex
pected at 11:00. Those holding num
bers above sixty are to come at 12:00.
Every one holding a number must
be on hand in his order, or his turn
will lie lost. All who have signified
their intention of trying out but who
were not at the meeting to-day may
be on hand any time Saturday morn
ing and take their chance of there
being an opportunity to tryout then,
and if there is not, they will have to
wait until next week. These may get
copies of their parts from any one
of the following persons: C. L.
Schaupp. B.J.O'Dounell, J.W.Howell.
