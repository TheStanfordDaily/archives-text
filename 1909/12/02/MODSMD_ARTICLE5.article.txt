# Encina Hall to Present Festive March Starts Interclass Debate Postponed.
## 
### 
On petition of the two teams, the
Intersociety Debating League this
afternoon granted a postponement of
the Freshman-Sophomore debate. Ow
ing to the near approach of the final
examinations, the underclass teams
felt that they could not put the proper
time in preparation for their argu
ments, and for this reason asked for
a postponement. The debate will
probably be held the tirst week of
next semester.
