## CARNIVAL PROMISES ROUND OF FUN. Wit of Rittigstein and Henry Humorously Advertises Ludicrous Festival on Stanford Field. 
### 
Mini esq ue reigns supreme. Gen
erals Morgan ami Guerena preserve
a stolid silence, haughtily refusing to
reveal their dire secrets of attack and
defence. Adjutant Rittigstein contin
ues to humorously epitomize the battle
with tlie radiant wit of his gaudy post
ers. Quartermaster Mackenzie smiles
and scowls according as the sun or
clouds triumph in the heavens. Pub
licity Manager I fails busily utilizes
the near-humorists of liis staff in an
endeavor to get out. the customary
five issues of the Daily during a dull
December week. Lieutenant-Colonel
Henry alone is satisfied with the sit
uation. for he has at last found his
vocation in tlie writing of a brilliantly
witty burlesque bogey, which will he
generously distributed 011 the cam
pus to-night.
This forenoon the management se
cured a broken-down wagon, a starved
horse, four signs, a ragged bass drum,
two freshmen and a cow-bell to more
widely advertise the carnival. This
rare combination was uniquely suc
cessful in causing no less than five
professors to dismiss their classes,
only to suffer the deep humiliation of
being requested by Treasurer C. G.
Lathrop to leave the campus.
The list of prizes for grotesque
costumes grows steadily larger. J. B.
Wideman has consented to give a
credit of five dollars toward a suit of
clothes.
