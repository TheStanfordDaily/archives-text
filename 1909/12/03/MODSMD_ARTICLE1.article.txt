# BURLESQUE TOMORROW
## RUGBY CARNIVAL ON STANFORD FIELD BEGINS AT 2. Senior All-Star Game Promises Excitement While Burlesque Will Feature Laughter. 
### 
All is ready, and Rugby, real ami
riotous, will hold sway on Stanford
Field to-morrow afternoon. It will
be exactly 2 o'clock when the All-
Stars and the champion Senior fifteen
line up for the kick-off of the game
which, on paper, figures to be as
close and exciting as any seen this
year. The effort to arrange the men
in such a way that, the two teams
would be evenly balanced has been
apparently successful. Consequently,
every person on the bleachers should
have obtained the worth of his money
even before the participants in the
main attraction of the afternoon ap
peal*.
The Senior All-Star game is over.
An ominous silence hushes the bleach-
Even the peanut butchers cease
"stinging" the many manly students
who dare not refuse the merest re
quest of the Cardinal Beauties in their
endeavors to rid themselves of the
108 C bags of popcorn and candy which
Manager Rittigstein induced the Fair
Oaks merchants to donate to the cause.
Quartermaster Mackenzie nervously
surveys the field of battle, a look of
worried expectancy upon his grizzled
visage. Not, a sound can be heard,
save the steady tramping of the mobs
of people who madly jostle one an
other in an attempt to secure the few
seats remaining empty at the far ends
of the bleachers. For the day is bright
and the amphitheatre full. Humorist
Henry, in his usual conservative man
ner, sagely estimates that the crowd
at the Big Game closely approached
numerically that which now overflows
the stands.
But lo! staid, sombre and sober,
as is his wont, General Morgan steps
majestically forth from "Dad" Moul
ton's palace and with haughty pace
strides onward o'er the turf. In brave
confusion, his followers cluster round
him, boldly and blindly confident of
the prowess of their chieftain. Fore
most among them are Barnum and
Bailey Rittigstein, Bogey-writer Henry
and that rascal, Tad Deßolt.
Instantaneously with the mighty ap
pearance of General Morgan comes

row you all can see it for yourselves.
