### 
An important meeting of the Ham
mer and Coffin Society was held last
night for the purpose of electing a
new editor-in-chief of the Chaparral
and for the addition of several names
to the editorial board of that maga
zine.
The resignation of H. S. Fisk, '09,
who. lias served in the capacity of
editor-in-chief during the past semes
ter was received and accepted. Al
though it has been customary for the
editor of the Chaparral to continue in
office throughout the year, Fisk was
unable to do so on account of his
coming graduation at Christmas time,
and of his inability to return next
semester.
G. F. Morgan, '10, was chosen by the
board to fill the place left vacant by
Fisk. Morgan's election is well de
served, for the editor-elect has shown
his marked literary ability and has
been prominently identified with lit
erary work throughout his course
here. Morgan has been associated
with the Chaparral since his fresh
man year, is a member of the editorial
board of the Sequoia, president of
Nestoria Literary Society, and a mem
ber of the Phi Alpha Tau Debating
fraternity. Morgan was a member of
the intercollegiate and the Carnot de
bating teams last year, while he has
been prominently identified with
draamtics at Stanford during the past
two years. The new editor Is a mem
ber of Sword and Sandals.
E. J. Hopkins, '11, H. E. Salisbury,
'12, and A. T. King. '12, were elected
to take places upon the editorial
board.
Hopkins is a member of the Sequoia
editorial board, a member of the 1911
Quad Board, Euphronia Debating So
ciety and of the English Club.
King and Salisbury have both been
closely identified with the Chaparral
in the work that they have been suc
cessful in having accepted by that
magazine.
