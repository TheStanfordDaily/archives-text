# TURF FOR DIAMOND
## STANFORD FIELD WILL BE USED BY BASEBALL MEN. Board of Control Takes This Action Rather Than Go to Large Temporary Expense. 
### 
Stanford Field will be used as a
diamond for the baseball team this
spring, as decided by the Board of
Control at its meeting yesterday af
ternoon. A different plan of laying
out the grounds is to be used this
year, however. The diamond will not
be scraped clear, or "skinned" as*
last season, but the grass will be
cut short and well rolled. The corner
Of the turf to be used was especially
graded and levelled last season, but
could not be played upon on account
of the heavy rains rendering the
ground too muddy. A grass diamond,
however, will prevent this condition.
The field will be mulcted and put into
shape until needed next semested.
The Board did not deem it worth
while to put the old varsity diamond
into condition, since the new arrang
ing of the grounds and the building
of new bleachers would require an
expense of nearly $3,000. At best
this field would be but a temporary
one since it was made primarialy for
the use of the gymnasium and must
sooner or later be given over to the
latter's purposes. In case the utiliz
ing of the turf is not satisfactory, a
complete new field must be found and
laid out. The supplementary grounds
just south of Stanford Field may l)e
used by the squad for practice, during
the early weeks of the season.
The meeting yesterday also author
ized the painting of the track bleach
ers. The color will be the same as
for the football stands, a dark green.
