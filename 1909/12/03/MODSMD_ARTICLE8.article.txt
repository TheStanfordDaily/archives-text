# PRESIDENT TO SPEAK
## LAST ASSEMBLY OF THE YEAR MONDAY AT 11:15. Wililam eKnt of Kentfield will Be Heard on the Subject of Social Economics. 
### 
The last Assembly of the semester
will be held at 11:15 o'clock on Mon
day morning, instead of at 10:15 as
announced on the bulletin board, ac
cording to Professor B. E. Howard,
Chairman of the Faculty Entertain
ment Committee.
Dr. Jordan and William Kent, of
Kentfield will be the speakers and an
interesting talk is anticipated from
each, as both men have taken as their
themes subjects that are at this pres
ent age entertaining the thoughts of
more than half the people of the
world.
Mr. Kent has chosen the subject or
social Economics and will spend his
share of the period explaining and
commenting on the problems of that
study. At this time, England is faced
with one of the greatest labor
problems that has ever been con
fronted by a single nation, and it is
thought that Mr. Kent may spend a
few moments in depicting the essen
tial causes of this poverty struggle.
Mr. Kent as a man is well known
by the economist of the day, and is a
welcome visitor to such meetings as
the Assembly.
Dr. Jordan's topic will be "John
Brown and Fifty Years After."
Brown's anniversary is now one of
the listed items on the calendar and
this lecture is opportune.
