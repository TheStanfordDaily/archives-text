# MATHIEU PICKS CAST
## COACH SELECTS PLAYERS FOR "SECRET SERVICE." Miss Workman, Miss Wendling, Seward and Cohen to Speak Principal Lines of Sophomore Play. 
### 
Coach Frank L. Mathieu has selec
ted the entire cast for "Secret Serv
ice," the Sophomore play which is to
be presented next February and has
included in the list the names of prac
tically all of the second-year people
who have achieved successes on the
Stanford stage. With these carrying
the roles in such a thoroughly strong
and splendid drama as "Secret Serv
ice," is known to be, an excellent pre
sentation and a decided success is as
sured for the piece.
Miss G. D. Workman, who though
only in college one semester lias al
ready figured in two local productions,
"The Road to Yesterday"and Profes
sor Gray's "The Call of Bohemia,"
has been chosen for the part of "Mrs.
Varney," the strongest woman's role
in the play. Miss Workman's work in
the tryouts was far above that of
any one else, and so consequently
Coach Mathieu picked her to speak
the most difficult, lines.
"Edith Varney," the part of a true
and loyal daughter of the South, will
be portrayed by Miss F. Wendling,
who has been seen in several smaller
parts of plays given here both this
and last semester. The more digni
fied and reserved character of her
part will make her stand in contrast
to the lively and vivacious "Caroline
Mitford," which Miss G. J. Sipes is
to present.
Miss H. Sobey, who was in the
chorus of last year's Junior Opera
and who had a small part in "Twelfth
Night," will speak the lines of "Miss
Kittredge," and Miss A. M. Bates
will have the difficult character
of the old servant "Martha" to por
tray.
11. H. Seward and W. B. Cohen
whose part successes are too well
known to need recalling, will play
the leading roles of "Captain Thorne"
and "Mr. Arrelsford." Coach Mathieu
has said that if these parts had been
written for the two men, they could
not have suited them better than they
do, for both are of the type that best
befits their tempermanents and per
sonalities.
H. W. Lewis, another Sophomore
who is well known behind the Stan
ford footlights, has been given the
juvenile part of "Wilfred Varney."
Lewis is also splendidly fitted for the
assumption of this character.
C. L. Schaupp has been selected to
portray the gruff old Major-General
Randolph.
The short but difficult part o!
"Henry Dumont" was earned by E. R.
Knowlin, and the portrayal of the
old colored man. "Jones," was made
by E. M. Albright. G. Larkin has
tlie few lines of "Lieutenant Maxwell'
to speak and.1. J. Argabright. and A.
Bowen will represent the telegraph
operators in the third act. H. Person
will play the part of the "Corporal"
and R. C. Hamilton and P. Ward
will act as messengers.
A complete list of under studies
was also selected to substitute for
any of those on the first list, who
might fail to return to college next
semester.
