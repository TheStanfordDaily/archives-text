### 
The Southern Pacific Company an
nounced definitely that no special
rates are to l>e granted to Stanford
students during the Christmas vaca
tion. The matter has been pending
in the lej;al department of tlie com
pany for some days, and the news of
the withholding of rates will doubtless
be received with surprise on the cam
pus, as they have usually been granted
in years past. A special rate of one
third off will be granted to groups of
fifteen or more but these tickets are
good for thirteen days only.
