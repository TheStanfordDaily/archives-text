# ABLE DIVINE PREACHES
## REV. A.W. PALMER DELIVERS STRONG SERMON. Fluent Oakland Preacher Pleases Congregation with Beautiful and Strengthening Sentiments. 
### 
The best sermon delivered this se
mester by outside ministerial lalcnt
was preached yesterday morning in
the University Chapel by the Reverend
A. W. Palmer of the Plymouth Con
gregational Church, Oakland. "The
Lessons of a Mountain Trail" was
l lie subject upon which he spoke, and
in developing his theme, he expressed
analogies in the experiences of the
mountain climber to those of our own
every-day life which were at the same
time trenchantly suggestive in their
high spiritual message and truly ex
pressive of one blessed with a pure
eloquence and a noble diction.
In telling of the lessons of a moun
tain trail, he painted a beautiful word
picture of the sylvan path as it winds
its way up through ihe precipitous
canon and he spoke of how it, in its
ascendancy, pointed to a higher life
which leads to the ideal and seeks the
greater end. "The men who accept
the call of the range and leave the
valley of comfort, ease and luxury are
those who blaze the trail for the
progress of the world." As we are
indebted to those who explored the
woods and cut, out the path, so are we
indebted to those humanitarian lead
ers and those civilizing and enlight
ening institutions which have brought
light to us. And, as we improve these
passage-ways in all respect to those
who blazed the trail, so do we better
our laws, our state, and our church
indue reverence to those who strug
gled Â«tnd died that these institutions
might be established in the first place.
"The standards of life in the moun
tain are different from that of the
valley with its dusty wastes and its
crowded streets, in the former, the
leader of men is the one who in all
willingness contributes to the com
mon good, seeks those who are lost,
and is a cordial brother to all. He
lias time to saunter through the hills
and dales of existence, letting all
those sweeter and more subtle things
enter into the sinews of his life, and
then, finally ascending the trail to
those crystal fountains where all our
dreams come true."
