### 
The Sophomore Cotillion held last
Friday evening in Encina Hall was a
decided success in all ways and will
remain well qualified to be remem
bered as one of the best class dances
ever given at Stanford. The cotillion
was attended by the largest crowd
that has ever participated in a like
University function, about 180 couples
being on the Moor. In spite of this
large number there was no contusion
of any kind in carrying out the in
tricacies of the German figures.
The Grand March led by President
N. C. Wilson of the Sophomore Class
started promptly at 8:15. The figures
were danced during the middle of the
evening and formed a pleasing diver
sion from the regular order of dances.
The figures consisted of a large block
twelve formed by the dancers which
reached from one end of the hall to
the other. The favors for the first
figure were balloons, while those for
the second consisted of riding whips
for the ladies and red ribbon reins for
the gentlemen. In tine last figure the
gentlemen were driven by their part
ners producing the prettiest effect of
the evening.
The hall was artistically decorated
with long strings of sniilax stretched
from the central chandalier to the
walls and thickly dotted with vivid
poinsettias. The fireplace at the end
of the hall was completely covered by
a large twelve formed of poinsettias
on a background of evergreens.
The programs were very pleasing
in make-up and contained as a cover
design one of V. F. Bellow's beautiful
girl's heads. The music was catchy
and was ably rendered by Brohaska's
orchestra.
