# LAST ASSEMBLY HELD
## PRESIDENT JORDAN AND WILLIAM KENT MAKE ADDRESSES. Dr. Jordan Depicts the Life of John Brown and His Influence.â€”Kent Speaks on Economics. 
### 
The last Assembly of the semester
was held this morning during the
fourth period with President Jordan
and William Kent of Kent field as the
speakers. President Jordan was the
first speaker and spoke on the sub
ject of "John Brown and Fifty Years
After." Dr. Jordan in delivering this
theme not only depicted to a limited
extent the character of John Brown
and his activity in the abolition move
ment, but dwelt upon the influence
Brown's death had on Thoreau, the
great writer and lover of nature. In
emphasizing this phase of his subject,
Dr. Jordan concluded by reading Tho
reau's great oration on John Brown,
and termed it as one of the most strik
ing addresses ever delivered.
William Kent in opening his speech
declared his topic one that dealt with
the economic and social conditions of
the time. He recited the various
economic theories that are prevalent,
and how they are favored and con
demned. The keynote of his address
was that anti-social tactics are waste,
and that unrestricted individualism is
anarchy and warfare.
Both men addressed the assembled
body for twenty-five minutes each, and
Dr. Jordan in relating his subject
told at first that a trait akin to the
one which is at the present time
called graft was prevalent at the time
of Brown's life. That men at that time
absolutely opposed such principles is
true, said Dr. Jordan, and they were
outspoken about it. He further stated
that a man who will kill himself over
such a principle set people to think
ing. Continuing. President Jordan
told of Brown's activities in the aboli
tion movement and how he got to
gether slaves and gave them work on
his farm, and how the hanging of
Brown at Harper's Ferry caused much
comment, throughout the states, and
gave much impetus not only to the
abolition movement, but to the men
who soon came to look upon John
Brown as a character who once fig
ured as a man, and whose acts would
not be soon lost to the world.
Dr. Jordan then related how Tho
reau. at Concord, Mass, was greatly
impressed with the Brown episode.
Thoreau fifty years ago last Sun
day sent out word in Concord that he
wanted to speak on the Brown case,
but even the abolitionists and politi
cians advised him not to as Brown
had been convicted of treason. Tho
reau replied that, lie had not asked to
speak, but was going to. President
Jordan read the spcech Thoreau deliv
ered on that day and termed it one of
the most striking in history.
Mr. Kent spoke at once on the eco
nomic. phases of his subject. In brief,
jhe declared the fallacies of many eco
nomic writings are that they treat
humans mechanically. He believed
I that most of the economic theories
now present exemplify the relation
ship of the two classes. The men who
are getting control of the coal and
timber lands are builders, but have
anti-social tendencies, said Mr. Kent,
and that the theories we have now are
unsatisfactory because they were con

structed on too individualistic princi
ples. He believes the greater good to
the greater number the idea to be
cherished.
