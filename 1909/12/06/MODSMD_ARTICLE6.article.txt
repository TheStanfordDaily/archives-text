# GAME PROVES SUCCESS
## BURLESQUE RUGBY SUPPORTED ENTHUSIASTICALLY. Large Crowd Witness Introduction of Senior Class Institution in Amusing Game. 
### 
Burlesque has come and gone, the
teams have broken training and the
Senior class is enriched by some
two hundred dollars, but judging from
the success that attended the presen
tation of the vaudeville, this innova
tion promises to become a permanent
institution with the Senior classes.
The large crowd that, braved the wea
ther were well entertained by the
stunts and the program that the mem
bers of the opposing varsities offered
as burlesnuers, despite the fact that,
there was no evidence of the Wallaby
standard of playing that Captain Mor
gan and Guerena predicted in their
prospective statements.
As a game, the contest on Saturday
can be criticized for its lack of Rugby
organization, and the absence of nec
essary team work. Among the indi
vidual players can be mentioned Mor
gan and Sam who played up to their
usual standard in the open, while
Montgomery and Bellows were towers
of strength in the pack.
Professor B. E. Howard, as chair
man of the committee of judges who
awarded the various prizes that were
offered, announced that the follow
ing players will receive awards: T.
Bly, '13, pair of five-dollar shoes from
Thoits Shoe Store; J. B. Beman, '12,
stick pin from the Regent; P. Ward,
'12, five-pound box of candy from
Wilson's; F. L. Guerena, '11, three
dollar sweater coat from the Toggery;
H. C. Warren, '10, $5.00 on a new suit
by Kelly; S. Bellah. '10, $3.50 pillow
from the Stanford Bookstore; O. F.
Montgomery, '10, $5.00 on a new suit
by Wideman; V. F. Bellows, '09, cap
from Fraser and Company; C. N.
Leach , '09, pocket knife from The
Peninsula Hardware Company; G. F.
Morgan, '10, box of fancy apples from
Earle and Company; Sam, '10, box of
cigars from Larkin's; T. C. Henry,
'10, a "feed" at the Stanford Delicates
sen and Catering Company; and H.
Rittigstein, '10, a box of hosiery from
Simpson's. The other members of
the committee that made these ueci
sions were Dr. F. Angell and H. E.
Reed, '10.
The sum of $257.65 was the gross
amount realized from the game. This
sum includes the $40 that the con
cessionaries were enabled to secure
from the unsuspecting upon the
bleachers. As the expenses that, were
incurred by the management were very
slight, the net profits will be large for
the Senior Class.
A tie game was played between the
All-Stars and the champion Senior fif
teen. the contest resulting in an 8 toS
score. Throughout, the game can be
said to have been close and exciting
and was above the average of many
of the exhibitions of Rugby that have
been presented upon the turf. An ef
fort was made to play off the tie but
twenty minutes' play failed to register
a score and referee Presley called the
game in order to start the burlesque.
