At some of the dramatic productions
in Assembly Hall this semester there
have been instances of rowdyism on
the part of individuals in the audience
which should not be tolerated in a
college audience. Twice catcalls and
other disturbances have interrupted
emotional incidents on the stage and
seriously cheapened the dramatic ef
fect of the entire scene.
There is no excuse for such conduct
at a production staged before an audi
ence of college people. No milder
term than rowdyism can be applied
to such acts; no more generous de
scriptive than vulgar be used in the
characterization of the spirit which
prompts them. There should be no
toleration of acts by an individual
who rellects discredit on an entire
Student Body. A healthy student sent
iment on the subject would cause any
individual disposed to become boist
erous. to hesitate before incurring the
ill-will of his fellow-students.
If the responsibility for the dis
turbances rests on the Palo Alto
youth, though it is our opinion that
these loyal Stanford supporters re
ceive much more blame than is de
served, we would suggest summary
action when any one is detected caus
ing disturbances in Assembly Hall.
If the ushers, and spectators as well,
make it a point to remove from the
audience the guilty youngster there
will soon be an end to the complaint.
