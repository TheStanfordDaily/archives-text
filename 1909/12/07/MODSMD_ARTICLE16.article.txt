is maintaining a steady increase of
about 1200 volumes a month. Of
the new books recently listed, there
are several sets which Dr. Clark has
recommended as especially important
additions to the library.
The Athanaeum, perhaps the best
of all the English weekly reviews de
voted to literature and the fine arts,
has been practically completed by the
addition of the volumes for the years
1830-1890. Users of Poole's Index will
now be able to secure many refer
ences they had formerly to do with
out.
Other important accessions are the
"Transactions of the Institutions of
Mining and Metallurgy" and the "Spec
ifications of the IT. S. Patent Office,
1894-1905." This latter is a gift from
the IT. S. Government, and will be
placed in the Mechanical Engineering
Museum for the benefit of those in
search of recent information. Scheib
le's "Das Klorten," another new ar
rival, is chiefly important because it
contains the Faust papers and the
"Annals de la Societe Entomolgique
de France."
