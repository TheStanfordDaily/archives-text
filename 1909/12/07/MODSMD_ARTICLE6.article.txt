# PROSPECTS ARE GOOD
## STANFORD WILL HAVE STRONG TENNIS TEAM. Personnel of the Tennis Squad Will Be Almost the Same as Last Year. 
### 
Tennis prospects for next spring
are brighter than they have been
since (lie spring of 1907, the date of
the last Stanford victory in intercol
legiate tennis. In that year Stanford
won in both singles and doubles, T.
C. Henry, '10, capturing the singles
and P. P. Delans, 'OS, and Henry win
ning the doubles.
With the exception of H. ,1. Cowan,
'00, Stanford's tennis team will be the
same next spring as last, year. E.
Jordan, 'OS, who played in the inter
collegiate match last year, H. Mann,
'10, who has twice been a member of
varsity tennis teams, in '07 and 'On,
T. C. Henry, '10, who won his "S"
twice in '07 and has played every year
since then, and H. S. Morgan, '12, a
member of last year's team, will all
be in college next semester. Jordan's
eligibility may possibly be questioned,
but it is expected that the matter can
easily be cleared up. In addition to
these veteran players, there are two
very promising freshmen in college,
R. L. Murray and W. M. Argabrite,
who have made excellent showings in
recent, handicap tournaments. Both
of these men will press the veteran
players hard for positions on the var
sity team.
Melville Long, who has been the
mainstay of the California tenls team
for the past few years is now in Aus
tralia where he is competing for the
world's championship and is not ex
pected back for several months. His
brother, Herbert Long, will be eligible
next spring, however, and will be a
dangerous man in both the singles
and doubles. Powell and Rogers are
the most promising material for Cali
fornia after him. It has been stated
that McLaughlin, the well-known
Coast player, intends to register at
California this coming spring, but
there is nothing definite about this
statement.
At present there is a movement
among the tennis men of the Univer
sity in favor of increasing the size
of the tennis team that meets Califor
nia in the annual contest. In all
probability the matter will be brought
before the Executive Committee at its
next, meeting.
The tennis men state that, under
present conditions, it is impossible to
develop champion players here because
of the geographical location of the
University. They say that Stanford
has, and is. developing first-class ten
nis men, but in order to attain real
championship form, continuous prac
tice with the top-notchers is neces
sary. This practice it is impossible to
secure here. There are more men that
play tennis here than there are at
California, which is shown by the
greater interest and larger entry lists
in the handicap tournaments and these
tournaments have been the means of
developing many of the best players.
Those who are starting the movement
say that by increasing the size of the
tennis team, the one-sidedness of the
contest will be removed, and the
chances will be more equalized be
tween the two colleges.
