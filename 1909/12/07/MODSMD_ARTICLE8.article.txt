# GYM. CLUB CONTEST THURSDAY.
## First Annual Indoor Competition to Take Place in Encina Gymnasium This Week. 
### 
Next Thursday night Encina Gym
nasium will be the scene of the Gym.
Club's first regular contest and the
various men interested in ihe indoor
work will compete in a number of
events. Wooden shields are to be
placed on the walls of the gymnasium
and the names of the winners of each
event are to be inscribed with their
classes and their records, on these.
As this contest is planned to be re
peated every year, the shields will
become permanent fixtures and a
means for comparing the gymnasium
work of the present with that, of the
past.
Among the events to be contested
one snaps for distance from vault
bar and high horizontal, eighteen-foot
rope climb, high jump from spring
board, fence vault and team jumps.
As some of the gymnasts have been
practicing on these a close competi
tion with resultant record work is
expected.
The affair will be informal and not
intended as an exhibition, but all who
found interest in the contest for the
gymnastic championship which was
held last Thursday night and any
one else that might be interested in
the work are invited to be present.
