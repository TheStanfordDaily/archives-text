An instance of carlessness which a
little thought would correct is fur
nished by the appearance of the
walks and adjacent grounds for some
distance on either side of the Post
office where the ground is strewn and
littered with the waste paper from
discarded paper wrappers and circu
lars.
These bits of paper blown about by
the wind cause anything but a favor
able impression and detract greatly
from the general neat aspect of the
campus grounds.
It would not require an undue
amount of labor or exertion for those
opening mail to carry the waste paper
to a waste basket or Are and tTie
trouble would be amply repaid by the
improved appearance of the grounds
between the Post-oflice and the Quad.
The placing of a receptacle for waste
and rubbish convenient to this walk
might assist in the change.
