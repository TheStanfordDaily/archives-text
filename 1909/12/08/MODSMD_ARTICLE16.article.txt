Hockey will be played by the co

The freshman-sophomore flag rush
at the College of the City of New York
ended in a free for all fight, in which
one sophomore had two ribs broken
and one freshman was badly used up.
About 300 boys engaged in the melee
and black eyes, bleeding noses and
torn clothing were principal features.
The freshmen were unable to capture
the flag and the fight following the
rush was caused by the argument
which arose as to some of the methods.
