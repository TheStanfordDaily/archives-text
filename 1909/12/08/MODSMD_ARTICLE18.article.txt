## 
### 
The Daily Californian of Monday
last gives the plans of a proposed
men's dormitory to be built on the
Berkeley campus. The building is to
be of steel frame, six stories high and
with a frontage of 130 feet. There will
be billiard rooms, bowling alleys, a
cigar stand and a barber shop on the
first floor. The dining-room, kitchen,
grill and library will make up the
second floor.
The rooms will be completely fur
nished and may be had in suits of
convenient size for fraternities or
house clubs.
The dormitory is projected by a
private concern and will not be a part
of the university.
