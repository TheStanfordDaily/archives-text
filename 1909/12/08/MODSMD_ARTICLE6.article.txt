# CREW OUTLOOK BRIGHT
## BOAT CLUB WILL HAVE OLD MEN BACK. Training to Commence Soon After Registration Day.â€”Lake Will Be Filled About Feb. 1. 
### 
With all the men on both last year's
Varsity and Freshman crews in the
University, the outlook for rowing
next semester is particularly bright.
Regardless of the fact that rowing
as an intercollegiate sport has been
abolished, much interest is being taken
in boating not only by the members
of last year's crew, squad but also by
members of the Freshman class.
The Lagunita Boat Club will put
the men and old men to work at the
training house on the lake as soon as
possible alter registration day next
semester. The popularization of the
sport by giving every one an equal
chance to row will bring out many
who have never handled an oar and
the result will he that next year's
squad will be larger than any for sev
eral years past.
As there will be no professional
coach, it. devolves on the old men to
instruct the new candidates for hon
ors in the shell. Provision has been
made by the club for this by ap
pointing a committee which will have
active charge of the actual Instruction.
The large number of former crew
members who will be out again next
spring will lessen the task of the
coaching committee in showing the
form and stroke which Stanford crews
have found so effective in the past.
As soon as the new men have been
taught the theoretical side of the work
they will be placed in the boat with
the old men and in this way they will
rapidly acquire rowing form.
Although the Lagunita Boat Club
has made no particular efforts to in
crease the membership of the club by
extending the club membership to
any man in the University whether he
cares to row or not, it has been grat
ifying to the crew men of last year to
see the way the individual members of
the Student Body are coming to the
support of boating now that the finan
cial support of the last two years has
been cut off. At present boating oc
cupies the same position as it did
when the Stanford Boat Club main
tained the sport up to the time it was
taken over by the Student Body two
years ago.
Lake Lagunita will not be tilled un
til the first of February, training will
begin much sooner as the Coaching
Committee will give every one a
chance to do indoor training on row
ing machines.
The University of Washington is
making an effort, to keep in touch with
the progress in boating the club has
made here and at the request of the
Washington Daily J. C. Huston will
contribute an article explaining the
present rowing situation here for the
benefit of the northern university.
There will be two picked crews
chosen from the ranks of the Lagunita
Boat Club which will correspond to
the Varsity and Freshman crews of
last year. The Boating -tub at the
I'niversity of California has done the
same thing and several races are
planned for the spring. Other races
have been aranged for so trips and
of sport will be furnished the men
who take up boating next semester.
The Boating Club still is admitting
new members and any person who
would like to avail himself of the op
portunity to learn to row should com
municate with F. L. Guerena, '11, who
is taking the names of those wno are
coming out for boating.

next semester is particularly bright.
Regardless of the fact that rowing
as an intercollegiate sport has been
abolished, much interest is being taken
in boating not only by the members
of last year's crew, squad but also by
members of the Freshman class.
The Lagunita Boat Club will put
the men and old men to work at the
training house on the lake as soon as
possible alter registration day next
semester. The popularization of the
sport by giving every one an equal
chance to row will bring out many
who have never handled an oar and
the result will he that next year's
squad will be larger than any for sev
eral years past.
As there will be no professional
coach, it. devolves on the old men to
instruct the new candidates for hon
ors in the shell. Provision has been
made by the club for this by ap
pointing a committee which will have
active charge of the actual Instruction.
The large number of former crew
members who will be out again next
spring will lessen the task of the
coaching committee in showing the
form and stroke which Stanford crews
have found so effective in the past.
As soon as the new men have been
taught the theoretical side of the work
they will be placed in the boat with
the old men and in this way they will
rapidly acquire rowing form.
Although the Lagunita Boat Club
has made no particular efforts to in
crease the membership of the club by
extending the club membership to
any man in the University whether he
cares to row or not, it has been grat
ifying to the crew men of last year to
see the way the individual members of
the Student Body are coming to the
support of boating now that the finan
cial support of the last two years has
been cut off. At present boating oc
cupies the same position as it did
when the Stanford Boat Club main
tained the sport up to the time it was
taken over by the Student Body two
years ago.
Lake Lagunita will not be tilled un
til the first of February, training will
begin much sooner as the Coaching
Committee will give every one a
chance to do indoor training on row
ing machines.
The University of Washington is
making an effort, to keep in touch with
the progress in boating the club has
made here and at the request of the
Washington Daily J. C. Huston will
contribute an article explaining the
present rowing situation here for the
benefit of the northern university.
There will be two picked crews
chosen from the ranks of the Lagunita
Boat Club which will correspond to
the Varsity and Freshman crews of
last year. The Boating -tub at the
I'niversity of California has done the
same thing and several races are
planned for the spring. Other races
have been aranged for so trips and
of sport will be furnished the men
who take up boating next semester.
The Boating Club still is admitting
new members and any person who
would like to avail himself of the op
portunity to learn to row should com
municate with F. L. Guerena, '11, who
is taking the names of those wno are
coming out for boating.
