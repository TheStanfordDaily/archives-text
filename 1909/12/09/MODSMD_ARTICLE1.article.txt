This petition, as it has been inter
preted by the Tennis Club, asks for
the elimination of the element of cer
tainty that at the present time charac
terizes the intercollegiate matches that
are played with the University of Cal
ifornia. it would create a greater
chance for closer matches, as more
players would be required, which in
turn, would open an opportunity for
those who at. the present time have
no chance of competing against the
one or two champions in the I nt
versity.
It would also allow a larger num
ber of players to participate in inter
collegiate contests who under the
present ruling are not given the chance
to play against opposing teams. This
petition aims to give to the average

man more of an opportunity to show
his ability and to compete against
California.
Under the present ruling, men are
chosen from competive tryouts for
two single and one double matches,
while under the plan that has been
proposed by the local tennis enthu
siasts, three single and two double
contests would be held and if the
material warranted the action, the
captain could select men for all the
matches.
