The resolution of the Executive
Committee last, evening condemning
the practice of placing advertising bill
boards on the Quad came as a tardy
official cognizance of an act which
has been unanimously decried by the
members of the Student Body. The
usual window-cards furnish an ample
advertising medium without resorting
to the use of placards which convert
the Quad into a semblance of the bill
board corner of a street in the
suburbs.
In connection with this resolution
it is not amiss to call attention to a
previous resolution of the Executive
Committee, passed about a year ago,
which withdrew official sanction from
all advertising solicitation among
Palo Alto merchants except for the
regular Student Body publications, the
"Daily Palo Alto," the "Sequoia," the
"Chaparral," and the "Quad."
This prevented the financing of play
programs by securing advertising to
appear in the program but the regu
lation has not been strictly observed.
One method of evasion has been the
plan of having a merchant donate the
entire program, with a prominent ac
knowledgment of the courtesy. This
is a breach of the spirit, if not the
letter, of the rule and should be dis
countenanced in the publication of
future programs. The merchants of
Palo Alto may be expected to give
more substantial support to the reg
ular Student Body publications and

interests if they are not harassed for
contributions to every program or
handbill issued by a class or organi
zation.
