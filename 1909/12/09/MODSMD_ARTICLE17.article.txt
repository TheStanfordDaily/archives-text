# DEBATERS TO BE BUSY
## THREE FORENSIC CONTESTS NEXT SEMESTER. Outlook Encouraging for Successful Semester's Work.â€”Many Will Try for Intercollegiate Teams. 
### 
With the close of a successful se
mester's work in forensics in which
the programs of both Nestoria and
Euphronia Literary societies have been
of a high order and in which many new
debaters have shown more than ordin
ary ability, the outlook for next se
mester's work which culminates in
the Carnot and Intercollegiate de
bates with the University of Califor
nia, is very encouraging. Although
but three of the six varsity debaters
who competed in these big contests
last, year are eligible for the 1910
debates, the large number of men
who have shown their calibre in the
ihterclass debates and intercollegiate
tryouts can fully make up for the loss
of those ineligible.
The season will open with the Fresh
man-Sophoinore debate which will be
held the opening of next semester.
This will be followed on February 4
by the Cftrnot, when the general ques
tion, "The Present Distribution of the
Powers of Government, in France,"
will be discussed at Berkeley. The
Intercollegiate will be held on the
evening of the intercollegiate track
meet in Assembly Hall.
W. C. Shelton, '08, and J. E. Shel
ton, '10, the two present Carnot win
ners in colleges are both ineligible
for the 1910 Carnot, and G. F. Mor
gan is the only member of the 1909
trio who can make a place on the
team. Several able Junior and Soph
omore debaters should make strong
bids for these vacant positions. Not
able among these are R. J. Miller, '11,
F. H. Hilton, '11, and N. C. Wilson, '12,
who was an alternate on last year's
team.
Morgan is also eligible for the inter

collegiate team, but has declared his
intention of not trying for a place.
P. J. Batkln, '10, a member of (lie
last team, should make a good show
ing, as should several others who
have been equally as active in society
debating. A. C. Stelle, '09, who de
bated against California in 1909 is not
in college.
The new members who have been
voted to membership in Euphronia
and Nestoria this semester are taking
an active interest in forensics and
this combined with their large number
augers well for the future standing
of the University in the intercollegiate
debates. The Freshman debating so
ciety was an exceptionly lively or
ganization and many debaters were
recruited from its ranks into the Uni
versity societies.
