Editor Daily Palo Alto:
The Guild Board wishes to make
a strong appeal to students who have
enjoyed the privilege of the Guild
Hospital during illness to pay the bills
incurred while there. The Guild is
organized by students for students, and
it is by the prompt payment of obliga
tions that the hospital is able to ex
ist. Every month the settling of bills
has become less and less frequent,
and this fact has handicapped the
Board to a great and deplorable ex
tent. Aside from the moral help
which every student should give the
Guild there is a very strict Faculty
ruling concerning delinquents. If the
Guild bills are not paid next semester
registration in the University will be
denied. W. A. Morrison, '10.
