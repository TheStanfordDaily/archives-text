# OBTAIN CELEBRATED BOOKS.
## A 						Limited Number of Copies of a Rare Issue Can Be Obtained Now at Bookstores. 
### 
The bookstores of Palo Alto and the
University Bookstore will soon have
for sale an edition de lux of a book
which was in great demand around
the University some time ago. It was
only after extreme difficulty that a
number of upperclassmen. working in
conjunction, were able to put the cop
ies on sale and as no money will
be made by them from the project,
they thus disinterestedly gave their
time and efforts for the advancement
of culture.
The books themselves are master
pieces of art. containing classic ex
amples of the printers' craft. Turn
ing the illuminated leaves of the first
part of the book one will come across
things of interest to every member of
the Stanford Student Body, even to
the most conscientious student who
may, after leaving college, desire to
learn what happened during his four
years' stay there.
in other words for only one dollar
and fifty cents, can be secured one of
the few remaining copies of the 1910
Quad, a suitable Chrsitinas present
for any one.
