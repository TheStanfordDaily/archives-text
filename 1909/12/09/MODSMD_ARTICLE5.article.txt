# MANY PLAYS PLANNED
## FIVE DRAMATIC PRODUCTIONS FOR NEXT SEMESTER. Minstrel Show to Begin Series of Performances of Splendid Possibilities. 
### 
Despite the fact that the recent rul
ing of ilie Student Affairs Committee
lias a tendency to put a slight damper
on college theatricals, dramatics for
next year show every indication of lie
ins up to the high standard that such
plays as "Twelfth Night" and"The
Road to Yesterday" set this semester.
No less than live productions are
scheduled to take place in Assembly
Hall and every one of these lias pos
sibilities of being a record perform
ance.
The first event will come on Jan
uary 28, when the Combined Clubs
will present their Minstrel Show, an
attraction which will be unique in
the history of Stanford stage produc
tions. End men have already been
chosen for this and the wit of these
combined with the musical ability of
the men in the Glee and Mandolin clubs
and the humorous stunts which are
to be given by some of the best known
fun makers ought to make the eve
ning a thoroughly enjoyable one.
Sword and Sandals will come next
on February 5, with the play "The
Man From Home." The cast of this
play is well known and of undoubted
dramatic ability, and is sure to make
the performance as pleasing in the
eyes of its audience as past Sword
and Sandals' plays have been.
1912 will make a departure from
the usual line of sophomore plays
when on February 25 It stages "Se
cret Service," William Gillette's fa
mous sensational comedy of the Civil
War time. The cast of this play has
already been picked and contains the
names of some of the' best-known
undergraduate players.
The Junior Opera and the Senior
Farce are, of course, unknown quan
tities at present, but with the known
available talent in college, there is no
reason why these pieces should not
be so successful as their companion
plays of the semester. Some of those
who have made past Junior Operas
splendid productions, will not have
been rendered ineligible for 1911's
performance by participation in pre
vious plays, and these should make
the Junior's cast a good one, and, as
the Student Affairs Committee has
professed its willingness to consider
the players in"The Man From Home."
as special exceptions to the new rul
ing, the Senior Farce should not want
from a lack of clever players to speak
its lines.
