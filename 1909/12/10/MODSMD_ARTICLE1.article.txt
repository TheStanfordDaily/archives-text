# LOSE POINT-WINNERS
## STILL MAINTAIN NUCLEUS OF STRONG TEAM. Development of Winning Aggregation Will Depend on Discovery of New Material. 
### 
The possibility of again turning out
a victorious track team to follow the
lead begun by the 1909 team will from
now on be of supreme interest to the
student body. Unfortunately, men who
took about one-half of the points won
in the last meet, will not compete next
semester as they either will not re
turn to college or will not be eligible
on account of having competed the full
four years allowed.
The places of the men will have to
be filled by the new material devel
oped from the Freshman class and
although several of the Freshmen,
particularly Ruddick and Argabrite,
have shown up well during the fall
season, the men have not turned out
to train as consistently as would
please Captain L. Scott and Trainer
Moulton.
It has been rumored that J. O.
Miller would return to college in the
spring semester, but it is not likely
that such will be the case and "Dad"
Moulton will have to develop another
half-miler to take his place. A. John
son, '10, who showed up so well in
this event last year, should give a
good account of himself during the
coming season.
The loss of D. P. Crawford, '10. will
be sorely felt in the weight events,
although E. Woolley, '12, should easily
capture first in the hammer, while H.
Horton can be counted on for five
points in the shot-put if he competes.
The weakest place in the team will
probably be in the hurdle events, as
at present it seems we have no men
who are able to win from the Cali
fornia delegation although the spring
training may develop some good men.
W. D. Fletcher, '11, and J. P. Hemp
hill, '09, will be the mainstays in the
mile although there are several Fresh
men and Sophomores who will prob
ably show up well.
With \V. H. Newman, '12. back, the
two-mile run will add at least five
points to the Stanfrod score, and W.
M. Wyman, "11, will be in the lead rn
the quarter. Fast time will be made
in the sprints by T. L. Coleman. '12.
who with Reed and Holman will be
the mainstay in those events. The
return of S. H. Bellah, '10, will ma
terially strengthen the team in the
jumps and pole-vault. With P.ellah
Argabrite and other new men in ad
dition to the men who participated last
year in these events, this will be the
strongest department of the team.
With so many excellent jumpers. Cap
tain Scott may exercise his versatile
abilities in other branches, as in the
sprints in which he took part in his
Freshman year, holding the Freshman
Intercollegiate record of 10:1 for the
100 yards.
There thus remains an excellent
nucleus around which to build a win
ning team although it will require
work from every one and this is what
"Dad" Moulton wishes to impress upon
all the men intending to sign up for
track and upon the Student Body. In
order to accommodate those students
who will remain here during the holi
days and wish to do some training,

"Dad" will be at. the Track every
morning from 10 to 12.
