With this issue the present volume
of the Daily Palo Alto is brought to
a close. In this last number the edi
tor wishes to make acknowledgement
of the services of the associate and
assistant staff during the past semes
ter to which may be attributed what
ever degree of efficiency the paper has
maintained.
The efforts of these men in the ser
vice of the paper have been ceaseless,
and though the sacrifice of time has
often been a hardship, the editor has
never yet heard a man request to be
relieved from a part of his work. The
keenest regret is felt hv the present
editor that the expiration of this term
forces him to sever relations with the
men on the staff, who by their un
selfish and unrewarded endeavors In
the loyal service of the paper and
the interest of the Student Body
which it represens furnish one of tne
best examples of a practical applica
tion of the true Stanford spirit.
Under Mr. Fuller, who succeeds to
the editorial position, the Dally Palo
Alto should witness a most progres
sive semester. Seldom has the editor
ship fallen to a man who is so quali
fied for leadership both in the matter
of journalistic ability and knowledge
and appreciation of conditions and
needs in the Student Body and its
affairs. In relinquishing the chair to
him, the editor predicts a successful
future for the paper and a harmon
ious and pleasant regime for the new
editor in his relations with the staff
of the paper and the members and
organizations of the Student Body.
