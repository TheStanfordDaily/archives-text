Editor Daily Palo Alto:
The Senior Finance Committee
wishes to express their appreciation
of the commendable class spirit shown
by the Roble Seniors. Because of a
reception on December 4, they were
unable to attend the Burlesque Rugby
game, but they have sent a check for
$11.50 to cover the price of their ad
missions.
