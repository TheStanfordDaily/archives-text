# SUCCESS ASSURED QUAD.
## Many Juniors Pay Assessment.â€”Large Edition to Contain 450 Pages. Contracts Signed. 
### 
The contract for 'making the art
cuts and half-tones for the 1911 Quad
has been given to the Sierra Art
Company of San Francisco. This firm
is well known and the quality of their
work is of a very high order. The
printing contract has not as yet been
let. Four well-known publishing
houses are after the work but a satis
factory price has not as yet been
agreed upon.
The paper to be used in this year's
Annual is white and of a lighter
weight than that used in former
Quads. This lighter weight is made
necessary by the large number of
pages which will make up the book.
Four hundred and fifty pages comprise
the book; thus making it a larger
edition than any Quad which has pre
viously appeared. The paper contract
has been signed and the stock ordered
in the East.
That the Junior class as a whole is
supporting their Quad is shown by
the number who have paid their as
sessments. Nearly every member of
the class has paid up which is a bet
ter record than has been attained by
previous classes. The few delinquents
are urged to pay up at once in order
that their photographs may be taken
now. None will be taken after this
semester.
