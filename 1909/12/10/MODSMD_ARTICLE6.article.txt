# OUTLOOK NOT HOPEFUL
## BASEBALL TEAM MUST BE FORMED WITH BUT THREE VETERANS. Varsity Looked upon to Be Weak in Several Departments to Start the Coining Season. 
### 
When the baseball men are called
out on January 1!3 of next semester
Coach Presley will be confronted with
the problem of filling seven places on
the nine, much the same condition that
the California coaches had to face last
spring. The Stanford difficulty is the
more acute when it is reported on first
hand information from Berkeley that
the Blue and Gold winning team o"
last season is practically intact, with
the strong Freshman battery, which
met Stanford, unimpaired.
The cardinal last spring, however,
witnessed a veteran squad, and their
consistent good playing throughout
the schedule rather discounted many
strong second-team men who will be
depended upon to fill several of the
largest holes in the line-up this year.
The bases will be well taken care of by
these men, while behind the bat there
is a strong hope that E. R. Canter
bury, '12, who filled that position in
the California series last April, may
return after Christmas, making a nu
cleus of three veterans with which to
form a team. But it is in the search
form a team.
But it is in the search for a
pitcher and a short stop that the
perienced men of several year's stand
ing. For the box it. is possible that
M. M. Mitchell, '10, the cardinal third
baseman of 1909 may be developed
into a dependable factor. He showed
excellent form in several games with
Santa Clara last season, when taking
the place of the regular varsity pit
chers. S. W. Gillillan, '12, or H. E.
Reed, '10, the strong pitcher of the
championship Junior team, who were
out of the 1909 season because of the
probation rule, may also be of suffi
cient caliber to fill that important
place. The outlook is almost barren,
however, for a varsity short-stop, al
though there is always hope that one
of the class team men of last year
may prove reliable.
The chances for a strong out
field are also very low. The over
flow of experienced candidates for
the infield may, however, be enough
to fill at least two of the field
positions, B. L. Ball, '11, and G. Mc-
Gregor, '09, being aspirants for the
initial sack, but having served the
nine in the outfield during several
past season games, could be used there
again. C. F. Ganong, '10, the veteran
right-fielder, while signing up this
year for first base, might, if neces
sary, be used in the outer territory
once more.
The entering class is especially rich
in players who have very glowing
preparatory school records. Such reo
cords are not borne out in college ex
perience in many cases, but, neverthe
less, the belief is well-founded that
more than the usual number of good
men may be gleaned from the Fresh
men, sufficient, at least to somewhat
lighten the task of the Coach. More
over, there is sure to be an extra
ordinary number of players signing
up for the team, as was evidenced by
the long fall practice list. The out
look, therefore, is by no means wholly

discouraging, despite the very few
former team men available for the
nine in January. The election of a
captain may he delayed for several
weeks after the opening of the sea
son, in order that the choice of a
leader shall he more free and the re
ward of superior ability. Election
by mail may he resorted to, with votes
taken from the members of last year's
nine not 011 the campus, and from
those still in college. Only partici
pants in the California series las:
spring are eligible to vote.
C. E. Sampson, '09, the 1009 base
ball captain, is forming a team o?
veteran players from Stanford, Cali
fornia. St. Mary's and Santa Clara.
This team will have at least three
games with the Cardinal varsity, and
will be able to fill any mid-week's
dates cancelled unexpectedly. The
importance of this is great, since it
will assure the varsity plenty of hard
practice with strong players.
