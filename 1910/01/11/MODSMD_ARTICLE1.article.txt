# SCHOLARSHIP IS POOR
## LAST SEMESTER'S COLLEGE WORK NOT UP TO STANDARD. Forty-two Students Suspended and Forty-one Placed on Probation by Committee. 
### 
Forty-two members of last semes
ter's student body will be unable to
re-register for college work this se
mester and forty-one more will have
to re-enroll on strict probation be
cause of past delinquent scholarship.
In addition to ;hese a number of stu
dents Mill be compelled to undergo a
semester of minor probation because
of their work being too near the dan
ger mark.
"College work of last semester,"
said Profesor Gilbert, the chairman of
the faculty committee on scholarship,
"was generally poorer than it has
been for many terms and probably
was second in deficiency only to the
year when so many failures resulted
from troubles in connection with the
parade. I have not looked into the
matter sufficiently to suggest a cause
for this, but 1 am under the impres
sion that too great interest in student
activities was the reason as much as
anything else."
As dramatics and football were the
principal activities of last semester,
these are probably the ones referred
to.
The actual figures do not show that,
last semester's grade of scholarship
was poorer than in past years be
cause of the new system of suspen
sion and probation, which was putin
vogue only last May. Under this a
first failure only results in probation
and not a semester of enforced ab
sence as under the old method of
treating unsatisfactory scholarship.
If the old system were now in effect
eighty-three of last year's residents
would be absent from the campus
this semester, and a number of others
would be on strict probation and not
minor probation as at present. Minor
probation differs from strict in that a
failure while under it does not result
in permanent suspension.
As the names of those who failed
in their work are withheld it is not
known at present how the Scholar
ship Committee's ruling will elf'ct
this spring's activities. It is probable,
however, that many well-known peo
ple are included in the list of those
rendered temporarily or permanently
inactive.
