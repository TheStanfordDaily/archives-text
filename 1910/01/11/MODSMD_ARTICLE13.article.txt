' The 'Inside' of Stanford Politics,"
the featured article of the current "Se
quoia," pictures an utterly corrupt
and unscrupulous political ring in con
trol of the Stanford student body.
According to an editorial note, the au
thor has endeavored to "maintain an
unbiased, impartial and fairmindcd
point of view," and the ro-idor is left
to "judge of the desirability or unde
sirability of the conations set forth."
That such conditions actualiy in ex
istence, would l>e abhorrently unde
sirable is patent. In the preseni ar
ticle, however, little or no detailed
proof is offered in substantiation oi'
the statements made, the author mere
ly voicing those facts, the truth of
which a "careful investigation" has
led him to strongly believe. The edi
tor has asserted that another article
on the same subject is to follow, and
that the statements made in ihe Jan
uary number will then be affirma
tively authenticated by positive and
incontrovertible evidence. Till such
evidence is offered and examined, fur
ther comment is impracticable.
A "muckraker" should either prove
or keep still. If the "Sequoia" later
proves its recent assertions, it will be
rendering an incalculable service to
the student body. But we must await
such proof. Until then we express ab
solutely no opinion as to the truth or
falsity of "The 'Inside' of Stanford
Politics."
