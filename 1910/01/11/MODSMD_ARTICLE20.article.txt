# " SEQUOIA " CRITICIZES
## FEATURED ARTICLE CHARGES CORRUPT POLITICS. Editor Leaf Announces Vigorous Campaign Against Leaders of the Alleged Machine. 
### 
The first issue of the Stanford "Se
quoia-' for the spring semester ap
peared on the campus this morning
and in it Editor Leaf has produced one
of the best editions of the monthly in
years. Not since the days of "Bill"
Herron has any issue of the "Sequoia"
aroused so much interest in the uni
versity reading public, probably be
cause of the generally critical char
acter of the contents. Particularly
does the leading article, "The 'Inside'
of Stanford Politics," launch charges
against, an alleged secret society, com
posed of prominent men, that are cal
culated to create a stir throughout the
Student Body. The existence of such
an organization, if the allegations of
the author can be proven, comes as
a distinct surprise to at least a ma
jority of the Student Body. The ar
ticle goes no further than to call at
tention to the presence of an exclusive
political machine and to trace its sin
ister influence in college politics in
the last few years. However, Editor
Leaf promises disclosures of a more
startling and specific nature in the
coming numbers of his magazine in
the form of facts, names, events and
dates. That he is in possession of
such material is indicated by the edi
torial comment in the current "Se
quoia." Leaf today took occasion to
state that the aggresive atitude as
sumed against the "Scariboea" would
be continued in the future against
some of the more flagrant abuses that
tend to interfere with a wholesome
Student Body spirit. He said:
"In furtherance of the 'Sequoia's'
avowed policy of exposing undesirable
conditions the magazine published to
day the first of the series of articles
dealing with student body politics.
This first instalment was purposely
made general with the intention of
awakening the unsuspecting majority
of students to a realization of certain
evils that lurk nearby, unmolested.
A second instalment will follow, sub
stantiating by facts and instances the
charges made in the more or less in
troductory article. Other articles
which are in course of preparration
will deal with the need of reform in
other branches of student activities."
The remaining contributions in the
monthly are of more than ordinary
merit. "Historic Peerades" recalls the
forerunners of a now historic event.
Valuable suggestions are offered in
"The Need for a Department, of Jour
nalism" and "A Student Calendar —Its
Benefits." Manager Thompson re
ports a large sale today on the quad.
