# COMPLETE SHOW PLANS
## MINSTREL MATERIAL NOW READY FOR REHEARSAL. Return to College of Principals Insures Successful Presentation of Production. 
### 
All the details of the minstrel show
to be given under the auspices of the
Combined Musical Clubs have been
completed and rehearshals will com
mence at once. The music has all
been selected and the end-men's gags
and jokes arranged and written. G.F.
Morgan, MO, is now engaged in dis
tributing solos and end-man materials
to those who have been chosen to take
part.
The music offered will include solos
for tenor and bass, new comic songs,
quartettes and choruses. R. H. Brown,
'10, the leader of the Glee club, has
made a special arrangement of pop
ular songs which will be used for the
opening and closing choruses of the
first part. One of the striking num
bers of the program will be a song and
dance turn participated in by the
whole black face section.
The place of W. R. Pittinger, '11,
who has left college in order to en
gage in business wil be filled by W. S.
Porter, *11, a prominent member of
Encina club and Nestoria Literary So
ciety. The fact that all the other
principals and soloists returned to
college insures the success of the
show.
About thirty-five men will take part
in the first half of the program.
Eighteen of these will comprise the
humorists and soloists who will form
the first semi-circle while the rest will
form a second circle and will act as a
reinforcing chorus.
Many acts have been prepared for
the olio which will conclude the per
formance. From these acts the best
will be selected by try-out and will
form the second part of the program.
The olio will consist of musical and
comedy sketches and sleight of hand.
Some of the cleverest entertainers in
college will be seen in entirely new
acts in this part.
The University orchestra is engaged
in practicing new music for this pro
duction which will mark its first ap
pearance this semester.
Designs are now being prepared for
an advertising poster which promises
to be different from anything hitherto
seen on the campus. Novel photo
graphic pictures of the principals will
also be used in advertising the show.
