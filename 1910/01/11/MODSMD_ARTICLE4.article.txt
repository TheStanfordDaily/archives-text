# TO OPEN BALL SEASON
## CANDIDATES WILL SIGN UP ON NEXT THURSDAY. First Practice of Year Will Be Held aturday Afternoon on Supplementary Field. 
### 
Coach Presley has anounced that
the baseball season for 1910 will be
opened next Thursday afternoon at
1:30, when all those who anticipate
competing for places upon the class
teams or upon the Varsity will sign
up for work. At that time Coach Pres
ley will give a general outline of his
plans and a synopsis of his system of
training for the season. This signing
of candidates for positions upon the
teams will enable the coach to esti
mate the strength of the material that
is to be used in forming this year's
team and will also give a preliminary
prospect of the Varsity's eventual
strength.
The first practice of the season will
be held on Saturday afternoon, Jan
uary 15, at 3:00 o'clock on the sup
plementary field adjoining Stanford
field. All those who anticipate com
peting for positions upon these teams
will appear at that time in suits ready
for their first regular practice of the
season.
Twe men who have been members
of former Varsity teams and who
played against the California Varsity
last year are now in college and are
eligible to compete in the champion
ship series of this season. These are
M. M. Mitchell, '10, and C. F. Ganong,
"10. But besides these Varsity veter
ans there are members of former
squads who will be present at the
first practice of the season and who
will help to augment the small nucleus
with which the coach starts his work
this year. To offset this lack of ex
perienced men, there are indications
that the competition for positions up
on the team will be strong and that the
number of those signing up for work
next Thursday will be very large.
Coach Presley anticipates an early
selection of the class teams and the
playing of the interclass series at
some date before February 15, provid
ing that the weather will permit prac
tice during that time. Class teams
will be selected in the near future in
order that, the various teams will be
allowed to practice for the coming
series. It has not been definitely de
cided yet as to whether men who have
competed upon Varsity teams will be
alowed to play upon their class teams
or not.
