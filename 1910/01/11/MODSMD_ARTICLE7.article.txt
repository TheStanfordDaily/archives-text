# TO BEGIN TRAINING
## BOAT CLUB WILL COMMENCE ACTIVE WORK AT ONCE. Cardinal Oarsmen Invited to Compete In Many Regattas.â€”Lake is Filling Rapidly. 
### 
From the plans perfected by the
iioat Club the coming semester prom
ises to be one of the most successful in
the history of the sport at Stanford.
Many offers have already been re
ceived from outside clubs and a large
number of good contests are thus as
sured.
All preparations have been made for
the training season and active work
will begin at. once. The work for first
two weeks will be confined to the use
of the rowing machines and to cross
country running. As soon as the lake
is filled, however, the candidates will
be given an opportunity to train in the
barges. Water is now running into
the lake and it will probably be filled
within two weeks.
In addition to the equipment which
the Boat Club received from the Stu
dent Body it has been given the use of
a four-handed racing barge which is
owned by the South End Boat Club of
San Francisco. This club, through its
manager, D. W. Scully, kindly volun
teered to give the Stanford oarsmen
the use of the boat for an indefinite
period of time. With the acquisition
of his barge the Boat Club has suffi
cient equipment to carry on train
ing most satisfactorily.
To supply the place of a coach the
Boat Club has appointed a Coaching
Committee which will have supervis
ion of the men. This committee which
consists of Captain J. C. Huston, '10
and Coxwains F. L. Guerena, '11 and
J. W. Howell, '12, will undertake to
prescribe the work to be done and will
be responsible for the choosing of the
crews.
"According to the plans made by
these men every member of the Boat
Club will be given abundant oppor
tunity to train both on the machines
and on the lake as well. Class crews
will be organized at. once and frequent
races held in order to stimulate in
terest in the sport. Provision is ilso
made that any particular group of
men will be allowed to organize a
crew to race with other groups simi
larly organized. Membership in the
Boat Club is still open to any under
graduate or faculty member upon thp
payment, of a fifty-cent initiation fee
and monthly dues of twenty-five
cents. Membership in the organiza
tion carries with it. all the privileges
of the use of the boat house and equip
ment. together with the personal su
pervision of the Coaching committee.'
A communication has been received
from the University of Washington in
viting the Cardinal Varsity and fresh
men crews to participate in the spring
regatta on Lake Washington and offer
ing Stanford a guarantee of $600 to
cover the expenses of the trip. If but
one crew enters the contest the North
erners agree to advance $-100. An in
vitation has also been received from
the San Diego Boat Club asking the
Stanford oarsmen to participate in the
annual regatta held at Naples by the
southern boatmen. This event will
take place during the Easter vacation.
In addition to these races it is also
probable that contests will be ar

ranged with the South End Boat Club
of San Francisco as that organization
has expressed its desire of competing
with the Cardinal crews.
The Boat Club is also arranging ac
comodations at the boat, house for
swimmers. Lockers are being con
structed for the use of the members of
the club and a spring board has been
erected for the benefit of 'he swim
mers. These privileges will not be
confined to the members of the club
but wfl open to all the men of the
Universi
