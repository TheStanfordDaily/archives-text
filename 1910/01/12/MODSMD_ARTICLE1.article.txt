### 
Forensic activity for the present se
mester will open next Tuesday even
ing, January 18, in the University
Chapel, when ilie two teams repre
senting the Freshman and Sophomore
classes will meet in the annual under
class debate. The following Tuesday
January 23, the Chapel will again be
tht- scene of a lively contest, when the
try-outs for places on the Carnot de
bating team will be held.
i'.c.tli o: these debates should prove
of more than ordinary interest as able
men will 'appear on both occasions.
The freshman-Sophomore debate was
postponed from last semester, so as to
,i;ive tlie teams more time to prepare
the question to be argued. During the
Christmas vacation the six contestants
have been exhaustively studying the
direct primary system which they are
to discuss, and are thoroughly con
versant with its important features.
The specific question to be argued is,
"Resolved —That the states should
nominate all candidates for elective
offices by the direct primary system."
The Sophomore team is composed
of M. E. Grimes, N. C. Wilson, and H.
R. Person, with E. E. Tincher, as al
ternate. This trio will uphold the
negative in the coming debate. The
first year team is composed of W. E.
Simpson, K. E. Leib and A. G. Brad
ford, with J. P. Gregg as alternate.
The Freshmen chose the affirmative
side of the primary question, when it
was submited to them by the Sopho
mores.
The judges for the debate have not
been chosen as yet, but will be an
nounced later. Nestoria and Euphro
nia Literary Societies will not hold
their regular metings next Tuesday
evening in order to allow the mem
bers to atend the debate.
President Shelton, '10, of the As
sociated Students will preside.
The general subject which will be
argued at the Carnot tryout is, "The
Present Distribution of the Powers ot
Government in France." From this,
will be chosen it specific question by
the faculty committed two hours be
fore the tryout, and it is upon this
subject that the candidates for the
team inusi speak extemporaneously.
If an unusually large number of
men sign up for the tryout, it will be
necesnry to hold a preliminary con
test. Professor R. M. Alden, chair
man of t'ne Faculty Committee on in
