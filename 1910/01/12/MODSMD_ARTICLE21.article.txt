## First Meeting of Semester to be Addressed by Dr. J.W. Cochran in Chapel at 7:30. 
### 
The first monthly meting of the
Y. M. C. A. this year will be held at
7:30 in the chapel. The speaker will
be Dr. J. W. Cochran who played a
prominent part in the recent Assoc
iation Conference at Carmel-by-the-
Sea. His subject will be one which
will interest all University men.
Dr. Cochran has been selected by
the general assembly of the Presby
terian church to engage in this field
of work because of his intimate
knowledge of college men and their
work. He comes here after having
recently visited the universities of
the middle west, including Illinois,
Minnesota, Nebraska, and Kansas Uni
versities. His work brings him in
contact with the larger universities
and colleges of the country.
The Association specially invites
the attendance of all the new men of
the University as well as the old men
who are interested.
The Y. M. C. A. Conference held at
Carmel during tlie Christmas vacation
was a decided success. About ninety
men were present including fifteen
from Stanford. Among the many
speakers were Dr. W. F. Patchall of
San Jose, and J. L. Kennedy, a promi
nent lawyer of San Francisco. These
two men are to give courses in Bible
and mission study'work in the Uni
versity this semester.
