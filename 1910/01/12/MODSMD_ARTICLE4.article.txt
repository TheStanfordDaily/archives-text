lege, Santa Clara College, Ireland's
Independents, The White Sox and the
All Stars team, which is made up of
a strong aggregation of players from
the northern section ot the state.
The first two games with Saint Vin
cent will be held in Los Angeles, while
the return contests will be played up
on the campus in March. The first
game of the intercollegiate series will
be played upon the campus on April
2 and the second contest will occur
in Berkeley the following week, on
Saturday, April 9. According to this
schedule, there will be a game every
Wednesday and Saturday during the
season if the weather will permit,
while the majority of these will be
played upon the campus.
Tomorrow, at 1:15 in room 50, all
candidates for positions upon the var
ious teams will sign up for the sea
son's work and will receive prelimi
nary instructions from Coach Pres
ley.
The schedule for the season is as

Wednesday, January 26, Ireland's

Saturday, January 29, Saint Mary's

The situation in track has assumed
a different aspect since the closing of
college last, semester. Several men
upon whom Trainer Moulton rested
some of his strongest, hopes for next
April will either be out of college or j
out of the competition through schol
arship conditions. The mile run re
ceives the greatest, blow in this in
stance. \V. D. Fletcher, 11, and J. P.
Hemphill. '09, the two reliable run
ners in that distance will not be in
college the coming season. There is
some margin of doubt in regard to
Hemphill, but he is at present al
most sure of entering the government
service. The loss of these two men
strips the mile of veterans, but a ray
of hope appears in the ranks of the
underclassmen. K. L. Lee. '12. is
looked upon as a pointwinner and,
with other possibilities,' may keep
this event from going to the Blue and
Gold in the final meet next spring.
The quarter-mile and the relay
events will suffer by the inability of
VV. M. Rawles, '09, to compete. This
will leave the relay team in a much
depleted condition, but there are sev
eral men who can be trained for the
quartette race.
Trainer Moulton promises that with
the co-operation of the whole Student
Body, which track as a sport deserves,
he will mould a team to maintain the
standard of the Cardinal in coming
meets. Opportunity on the squad was
perhaps never better, and a long list
of men should respond to the needs of
this major branch of athletics. Any
one is absolutely free to come out on
the track and avail himself of "Dad"
Moulton's training. No definite call
for candidates will be made, but the
trainer and Captain Scott have set
Saturday as the best time to appear,
from 10-12 in the morning and from
3-5 in the afternoon. Some sort of a
rally will be held next week, in order
to start the season in the right way.
Definite details of this will be printed
later.
The following schedule has been an
nounced for the track team. It is
practically the same as last year, the
only difference being in the actual
dates set with the various teams. The
interclass meet will occur March 5.
The schedule: —

The situation in track has assumed
a different aspect since the closing of
college last, semester. Several men
upon whom Trainer Moulton rested
some of his strongest, hopes for next
April will either be out of college or j
out of the competition through schol
arship conditions. The mile run re
ceives the greatest, blow in this in
stance. \V. D. Fletcher, 11, and J. P.
Hemphill. '09, the two reliable run
ners in that distance will not be in
college the coming season. There is
some margin of doubt in regard to
Hemphill, but he is at present al
most sure of entering the government
service. The loss of these two men
strips the mile of veterans, but a ray
of hope appears in the ranks of the
underclassmen. K. L. Lee. '12. is
looked upon as a pointwinner and,
with other possibilities,' may keep
this event from going to the Blue and
Gold in the final meet next spring.
The quarter-mile and the relay
events will suffer by the inability of
VV. M. Rawles, '09, to compete. This
will leave the relay team in a much
depleted condition, but there are sev
eral men who can be trained for the
quartette race.
Trainer Moulton promises that with
the co-operation of the whole Student
Body, which track as a sport deserves,
he will mould a team to maintain the
standard of the Cardinal in coming
meets. Opportunity on the squad was
perhaps never better, and a long list
of men should respond to the needs of
this major branch of athletics. Any
one is absolutely free to come out on
the track and avail himself of "Dad"
Moulton's training. No definite call
for candidates will be made, but the
trainer and Captain Scott have set
Saturday as the best time to appear,
from 10-12 in the morning and from
3-5 in the afternoon. Some sort of a
rally will be held next week, in order
to start the season in the right way.
Definite details of this will be printed
later.
The following schedule has been an
nounced for the track team. It is
practically the same as last year, the
only difference being in the actual
dates set with the various teams. The
interclass meet will occur March 5.
