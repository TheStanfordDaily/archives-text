# REGISTRATION LARGE.
## 1429 Old and Now Students Start College Work Yesterday. 
### 
The semester whs started yesterday
with a lirst day's registration as large
as the total regis tradon for the entire
corresponding semester of last year.
946 men and 483 women enrolled mak
ing a total of 1429, and. as many late
arrivals are coming in.the number
is constantly increasing.
Fifty-eight, names are those of new
students and forty-seven are those of
old students who have been out of
college for a semester or longer. The
number of new freshmen is greater
than entered at the same time last
year but no definite comparison can
be made as the figures of a year ago
were greatly affected by the vaccina
tion rule.
