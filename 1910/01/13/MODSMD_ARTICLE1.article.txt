# PLENTY OF MATERIAL
## SEVENTY-FIVE MEN SIGN UP FOR BASEBALL WORK. Saturday Will See Opening of Season. — Captaincy not Yet Decided Upon. 
### 
That baseball material for the com
ing season will be abundant was
shown this afternoon when seventy
five men signed up for the Varsity
and class nines in Room 50. Coach
Presley did not speak to the men to
any length at the meeting, but made
it especially emphatic that all should
be at the field known as the supple
mentary diamond, on the north side
of the football bleachers, at 3 o'clock
sharp on Saturday afternoon. The
first practice of the season will take
place at this time, and all should be
in suits, if possible. Coach Presley
will take charge of the men and will
organize the squad immediately. One
week of work will be available before
the first game of the schedule, that
with Santa Clara one week from Sat
urday, on January 22. Some sort of
an idea can be made of the abilities
of the digerent men by that time, and
a Varsity organized to go against the
collegians.
The election of a captain can not
take place until the season has pro
gressed somewhat, and a varsity
squad formed eligible to vote. The
class series will probably be started
within a few weeks, in order to get
that part of the season's work and the
championship of rhe university out of
the way.
Owing to the new ruling of the Fac
ulty, all mid-week games on the
schedule must begin a half-hour later
than last year, at 4:30, and this
will probably reduce the number of
iunings possible to be played.
