# Encina Suffers Monetary Loss
## 
### 
Encina Club had the misfortune
during the Christmas holidays to lose
a portion of the sum which it is sav
ing to pay for the new billiard table,
recently acquired. Nearby the table
a small metal bank is kept, and each
player pays into its coffer a small
sum according to the number of
games he plays. During the lull of
the vacation, when but few were
frequenting the table, some of the
light-fingered gentry "lifted" the
money repository, and no trace as
yet has been found of it. A newbank
has been ordered and the raising of
the needed funds will be started anew.
