# WILL RUSH QUAD WORK
## EDITORIAL BOARD BUSY COMPILING ANNUAL. Much Progress Made During Holidays. Excellent Art Work and Engraving Completed. 
### 
The semester's work of compiling
the 1911 "Quad" will be formally
launched next Monday evening when
a meeting of the "Quad" Board will
he held at the Walden Club. A full
attendance is desired as it is the wish
of the editor to have the plans for the
next annual considered by all mem
bers of the staff. The meeting will be
held at 9 o'clock.
Much of the important "Quad" work
has been finished during the Christmas
vacation. Practically all of the Col
lege Year and Athletic engraving has
been done, and a large part of the art
work, which is of unusually high ov
der, has been submitted by the local
artists. Considerable work along this
line yet remains to be completed, how
ever, and Art Editor F. E. Hill wishes
his assistants to submit their copy as
soon as possible.
The management of the "Quad" is
also desirous of having the organiza
tion pictures taken at the earliest
possible date in order to expedite the
work of the engravers. The Sierra
Art and Engraving Company is mak
ing the cuts, and their work is prov
ing to be exceptionally good. The con
tracts for the printing and binding of
the book will be let next week and
then the work of submitting copy will
he rushed as rapidly as possible, so as
to insure the early publication of the
big 450 page annual.
