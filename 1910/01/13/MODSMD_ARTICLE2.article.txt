# BARON KIKUCHI ADDRESSES WELL-ATTENDED ASSEMBLY
## Famous Japanese Educator and University President Tells Students About His Native Country and Its People. 
### 
If President Tal't ever exonerated
one Achilles Hal linger, Secretary of
the Interior, for the acts considered
unfair by any of the common people,
when a public servant, Baron Bairoku
Kikuchi, president of the Imperial
University at Kyoto, and a prominent
and well known educator of the Far
East, this morning before the students
at the first extra assembly of the year
utterly succeeded in using the white
wash brush in covering up all fac
tors that would indicate in any way
that the United States and Japan
would ever clash over dignities or
commercial enterprises of any
sort.
Baron Kikuchi, emphatically de
clared that the people of the United
States, and all North America were
venerated and respected by all the
classes of Japan, from the autocrat
to lhe plebeian, because of the attitude
taken by them in Oriental affairs, and
the characteristics inevitably dis
played by the American man. Yet
the speaker proclaimed that the des
tinies of the East and the West are
doomed eventually to meet and em
brace one another.
Baron Kikuchi, in explaining whal
he believed to be the future relation
of the United States and Japan, de
clared that the idea of Japan going
to war with another nation at the ter
mination of the Russo-Japanese war
was always considered absurd by all
who knew conditions, and that the
idea of the United States and Japan
fighting within the next few decades
was still weaker. The Japanese edu
cator said that his nation had to fight
Russia when it did, or become a mere
cipher upon the chess board of inter
national games.
"Japan holds the peace record,"
said Baron Kikuchi and Ave hope to
continue to be the bearer of it. Japan
was shut up to all nations during
more than two centuries and had pro
found peace until 1853."
The Japanese educator here dwelt
upon the god phases of the "Closed
Door" policy. He explained in detail
this period in Japan; and told of how

the Country of the Rising Sun, during
the two centuries of so-called "sleep"
by the progressive western nations,
actually prepared itself for the trials
and tribulations which it had to meet
to become a factor of any importance
among the nations of the world.
"The Japanese were busy," said
Baron Kikuchi. "Shut up tightly by
the 'Closed Door' legislation, we were
absolutely free from all the trouble
arising out of any of the complica
tions due to foreign negotiation, and
combined international interest.
"The results were," said Kukuchi,
"that we improved our educational
systems, embraced the practicability
of industry, and when Commander
Peary arrived from the United States
to make a treaty for trade and com
mercial enterprises, we were ready to
make a definite reply."
That Japan has never deliberately
interfered or protested against the
"Open Door" policy was one of the
many interesting statements made by
Mr. Kikuchi.
In commenting on the criticism and
the antagonistic attitude taken by
some western people, Kikuchi stated
that the Japanese severely protest
against all wholesale condemnation.
"These critics nearly universally jeer
and sneer at our national character
istics," complained the speaker, "and
you will find," he continued," that the
majority of these are generally mis
informed, or fail to comprehend.
Kukuchi then paused to elucidate
some of the Japanese natural char
acteristics and whims, in comparison
with the nervous energy and ambition
so thoroughly imbued in American
people.
Self-sacrifice and self-control were
the two attributes he chose to speak
upon, and he sincerely expressed his
approval of such natures in an em
phatic manner.
In conclusion, Baron Kikuchi spoke
of the rapid evolution of educational
and industrial work in Japan, and of
rhe sudden declaration for the rights
of free public opinion and common
privilege of all classes.
