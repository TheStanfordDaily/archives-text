# LAGUNITA BOAT CLUB ACTIVE
## Crew Men Progressing with Work of Preparation for Coming Season's Work. 
### 
As fast as Lake Lagunita is filling:
the men of the Boat Club are contin
uing their work of preparation for
the season's activities. The old four
oared barge is being sand-papered and
scraped, while the pair will soon be
soaking in the waters to close the
cracks made by the dryness of the
past summer. The blades of the oars
will no longer be red, as was the case
when rowing was an intercollegiate
sport, but will be painted in white and
blue, the colors of the Lagunita Row
ing Club.
As the new barge from the South
End Boat Club is to be brought to the
campus Saturday and oars will be
brought up from Redwood Sunday,
actual rowing can be begun in a short
time. All the old and new men who
intend joining the club are asked to
do so immediately so that plans can
be arranged for putting a definite num
ber on the water.
