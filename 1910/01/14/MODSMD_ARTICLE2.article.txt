# QUADRANGLE CLUB MAKES REPLY
## Honor Society Justifies Action In Regard to Certain Officers of Student Body and Condemns Policy of "Sequoia." 
### 
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Dear Sir: The members of the
Quadrangle Club desire to comuiun
cate certain tacts to tlie general un
dergraduate public through the col
umns of your publication believing
that such publicity is necessary for
the welfare of the Stanford Spirit of
unity and the good of Stanford insti
tutions which it would appear are
being endangered by certain members
oi the community.
We refer to the two recent attacks
directed against honor societies in
one of your contemporary publica
tions. At the first of the college year
the editor of this publication allowed
an anonymous article to appear which,
while not specific, was plainly di
rected to cast these societies into dis
repute. The attempt was laughable
and only answerable' by the organiza
tions on a purely personal basis, as
the charges made it clear that but
two or possibly three men had a griev
ance.
Recently R. Justin Miller has made
general charges which practically re
llect on the honesty and integrity of
all leaders and so-called leaders of
student activities with the exception
of two individuals. He further states
that he intends to prove his general
ities. That he should goes without
saying. That he can is absurd. But
to continue to allow disappointed in
dividuals to take advantage of their
positions and tear down Stanford in
stitutions would be a failure to ob
serve the letter and spirit of the or
ganization of the Quadrang'e Club.
To impartially state certain facts and
present the situation as it really exists
is the object of this organization.
We have avoided this issue as long
as possible because of the reflection —
not on the honor societies and the
Quadrangle Club in particular but on
the instigators.
Happily the Quadrangle Club is
spared the discussion of the personal
ities ol the men involved. We are
obliged only to judge the'r acts. The
organization is a secret one but not
of the order of many others of the so
called secret organizations about col
lege. It was founded in the spring of
1902 by Dr. .Max Farrand, at that time
head of the History department, Dr.
Frank Angel 1 and the senior men at
that time accepted as leaders in col
lege affairs. For the benefit of those
who aspire to membership and for
the purpose of allowing the student
body to judge whether we members
have been right in repeatedly refus
ing to elect the men to whom refer
ence was made to membership we feel
that we can afford to quote from the
purpose of our organization as drawn
up by the founders.
The declaration of purpose of the
Club reads:
"Seeking to bring together men who,
through service to the University,
have shown that they represent the
various interests and activities of the
student life, but who have never done
anything that would hurt the good
name of Stanford, we unite to work
for Stanford interests."

I Considering the case oi the editor
I to whom the "Sequoia" reference is
| patent we would state that in our
opinion this editor has never shown
himself to be "representative of the
| various interests and activities." He
! has been but a subordinate on the
Daily Palo Alto since the second se
! mester of his freshman year. He
| reached his present position of editor
| of a student publication through
efforts, ilie only purpose oi which
was to prevent the magazine from
falling into the hands of an unreason
able radical who was the only possi
ble alternate candidate. In the past,
precedent has not shown that editors
of this publication are necessarily ac
tive men nor have they been considered
eligible to membership in the Club
I
for the mere title. At the present
time we believe that the gentleman's
editorial policy is grossly inconsis
| tent; and that he is bent on creating
j discord and internal strife because
I of his failure to secure personal ag
grandizement. To our best judgment,
heis undermining that which he pro
fesses to support: a unified Stanford
spirit. We consider that the gentle
man can not enter the Quadrangle
' Club because we are sworn to elect
ionly those "who have never done any
thing thai would hurt the god name of
iStanford."
i The second gentleman referred to,
the president of the student body, can
never belong to the Quadrangle Club.
I He has made himself ineligible. Un
der no circumstances is the student
body president eligible to membership
ipso facto in the Quadrangle Club.
In the present case, the gentleman
i under consideration was not, we feel,
the actual choice of the majority of
the student body for the position, but
was elected to it through the side
tracking of another very available
and popular candidate by means of
questionable political manipulation.
Under these conditions we do not
feel that the position of student body
[president in any way entitles him to
consideration as a possible member
I of the Quadrangle Club.
The Quadrangle Club feels that the
two articles above referred to, as pub
lished in the "Sequoia," reflect very
| seriously upon the characters and in
tentions of those who are known as
leaders of Stanford life. If the honor
and integrity of the Stanford institu-
I tions and traditions are to be attacked,
lit is only right that an adequate de
; fense should be presented. The mat
ter is too serious, too far-reaching, too
imperative of immediate consideration
l to permit of allowing it to drag on
through several issues of a monthly
publication. The matter has gone so
far now that the University public is
entitled to an immediate final proof
or final refutation of the charges
brought, The Quadrangle Club feels
that those bringing the charges should
come forward at once with the actual
facts which thev promise for the fu
ture, so that they may be met and
j la.ved at rest or proven once for all.
A continuation of the controversy
through several issues of the "Se

quota" would look more like a scheme
to sell the magazine than like a digni
fied attempt to right a wrong condi
tion of affairs in the student body.

of the order of many others of the so
called secret organizations about col
lege. It was founded in the spring of
1902 by Dr. .Max Farrand, at that time
head of the History department, Dr.
Frank Angel 1 and the senior men at
that time accepted as leaders in col
lege affairs. For the benefit of those
who aspire to membership and for
the purpose of allowing the student
body to judge whether we members
have been right in repeatedly refus
ing to elect the men to whom refer
ence was made to membership we feel
that we can afford to quote from the
purpose of our organization as drawn
up by the founders.
The declaration of purpose of the
Club reads:
"Seeking to bring together men who,
through service to the University,
have shown that they represent the
various interests and activities of the
student life, but who have never done
anything that would hurt the good
name of Stanford, we unite to work
for Stanford interests."

I Considering the case oi the editor
I to whom the "Sequoia" reference is
| patent we would state that in our
opinion this editor has never shown
himself to be "representative of the
| various interests and activities." He
! has been but a subordinate on the
Daily Palo Alto since the second se
! mester of his freshman year. He
| reached his present position of editor
| of a student publication through
efforts, ilie only purpose oi which
was to prevent the magazine from
falling into the hands of an unreason
able radical who was the only possi
ble alternate candidate. In the past,
precedent has not shown that editors
of this publication are necessarily ac
tive men nor have they been considered
eligible to membership in the Club
I
for the mere title. At the present
time we believe that the gentleman's
editorial policy is grossly inconsis
| tent; and that he is bent on creating
j discord and internal strife because
I of his failure to secure personal ag
grandizement. To our best judgment,
heis undermining that which he pro
fesses to support: a unified Stanford
spirit. We consider that the gentle
man can not enter the Quadrangle
' Club because we are sworn to elect
ionly those "who have never done any
thing thai would hurt the god name of
iStanford."
i The second gentleman referred to,
the president of the student body, can
never belong to the Quadrangle Club.
I He has made himself ineligible. Un
der no circumstances is the student
body president eligible to membership
ipso facto in the Quadrangle Club.
In the present case, the gentleman
i under consideration was not, we feel,
the actual choice of the majority of
the student body for the position, but
was elected to it through the side
tracking of another very available
and popular candidate by means of
questionable political manipulation.
Under these conditions we do not
feel that the position of student body
[president in any way entitles him to
consideration as a possible member
I of the Quadrangle Club.
The Quadrangle Club feels that the
two articles above referred to, as pub
lished in the "Sequoia," reflect very
| seriously upon the characters and in
tentions of those who are known as
leaders of Stanford life. If the honor
and integrity of the Stanford institu-
I tions and traditions are to be attacked,
lit is only right that an adequate de
; fense should be presented. The mat
ter is too serious, too far-reaching, too
imperative of immediate consideration
l to permit of allowing it to drag on
through several issues of a monthly
publication. The matter has gone so
far now that the University public is
entitled to an immediate final proof
or final refutation of the charges
brought, The Quadrangle Club feels
that those bringing the charges should
come forward at once with the actual
facts which thev promise for the fu
ture, so that they may be met and
j la.ved at rest or proven once for all.
A continuation of the controversy
through several issues of the "Se

to sell the magazine than like a digni
fied attempt to right a wrong condi
tion of affairs in the student body.
THE QUADRANGLE CLUB
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Dear Sir: The members of the
Quadrangle Club desire to comuiun
cate certain tacts to tlie general un
dergraduate public through the col
umns of your publication believing
that such publicity is necessary for
the welfare of the Stanford Spirit of
unity and the good of Stanford insti
tutions which it would appear are
being endangered by certain members
oi the community.
We refer to the two recent attacks
directed against honor societies in
one of your contemporary publica
tions. At the first of the college year
the editor of this publication allowed
an anonymous article to appear which,
while not specific, was plainly di
rected to cast these societies into dis
repute. The attempt was laughable
and only answerable' by the organiza
tions on a purely personal basis, as
the charges made it clear that but
two or possibly three men had a griev
ance.
Recently R. Justin Miller has made
general charges which practically re
llect on the honesty and integrity of
all leaders and so-called leaders of
student activities with the exception
of two individuals. He further states
that he intends to prove his general
ities. That he should goes without
saying. That he can is absurd. But
to continue to allow disappointed in
dividuals to take advantage of their
positions and tear down Stanford in
stitutions would be a failure to ob

fesses to support: a unified Stanford
spirit. We consider that the gentle
man can not enter the Quadrangle
' Club because we are sworn to elect
ionly those "who have never done any
thing thai would hurt the god name of
iStanford."
i The second gentleman referred to,
the president of the student body, can
never belong to the Quadrangle Club.
I He has made himself ineligible. Un
der no circumstances is the student
body president eligible to membership
ipso facto in the Quadrangle Club.
In the present case, the gentleman
i under consideration was not, we feel,
the actual choice of the majority of
the student body for the position, but
was elected to it through the side
tracking of another very available
and popular candidate by means of
questionable political manipulation.
Under these conditions we do not
feel that the position of student body
[president in any way entitles him to
consideration as a possible member
I of the Quadrangle Club.
The Quadrangle Club feels that the
two articles above referred to, as pub
lished in the "Sequoia," reflect very
| seriously upon the characters and in
tentions of those who are known as
leaders of Stanford life. If the honor
and integrity of the Stanford institu-
I tions and traditions are to be attacked,
lit is only right that an adequate de
; fense should be presented. The mat
ter is too serious, too far-reaching, too
imperative of immediate consideration
l to permit of allowing it to drag on
through several issues of a monthly
publication. The matter has gone so
far now that the University public is
entitled to an immediate final proof
or final refutation of the charges
brought, The Quadrangle Club feels
that those bringing the charges should
come forward at once with the actual
facts which thev promise for the fu
ture, so that they may be met and
j la.ved at rest or proven once for all.
A continuation of the controversy
through several issues of the "Se

quota" would look more like a scheme
to sell the magazine than like a digni
fied attempt to right a wrong condi
tion of affairs in the student body.
