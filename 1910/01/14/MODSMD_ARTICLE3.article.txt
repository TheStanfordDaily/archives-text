# EQUIPMENT INCREASED
## BOAT CLUB CAN TRAIN MORE MEN THIS SPRING. Formal Call for Candidates not to Be Made Until Next Week, When Lake Fills. 
### 
One of the greatest advantages that
will be derived from the formation
of the Lagunita Boat Club, which
takes the place of the regular Stan
lord Crew Organization, is the in
creased facility with which candidates
for the Club can be given systematic
training on the lake. It is expected
that eighty men can be taken care of
during the training hours of the after
noon, with experienced coaching.
This is a great improvement over last
year, and is the result of added equip
ment. Two four-oared boats and a.
two-cared shell will be in commission,
as last; year, and in addition the Club
has received from the South End
Boat Club of San Francisco another
four-oared shell, for use during the
spring. This will make room for the
.trying-out of 14 men at a time, and
will be a marked advantage. Eight
rowers only at a time were accomo
dated last season. The eight-oared
shell will be left at Redwood City for
the present, and will be used only
after the work has continued for some
time.
The Club will make a definite call
for candidates on Monday or Tuesday
of next week, when it is expected that
the lake will be full enough to make
some sort of a start in embarking
crews. Training will begin when the
shells are put on the water, this being
much earlier than was the case last
spring. The expenses of the seasoi
will be much reduced because of the
fact that the greatest drain on the
treasury, the hiring of a professional
coach, is not necessary this year. The
Club has a complete equipment and
the only expense will be for minor de
tails, such as repairs. Most of this
expense can be met by the revenue
derived from the entrance fee of $1.00
required of all new members, and the
monthly dues of 25 cents from each
member. The Club's season should
be a victorious one, since six of the
victorious Seattle crew are in college,
besides several oarsmen who did not
go north, but who helped to win from
California last April. Coxswain ma
terial is abundant for the first crew.
It is not entirely decided, but the
Club's plans may arrange for two
first crews, an eight and a four, and a
crew made up of Freshmen.
Definite announcement of a call for
candidates will be made sometime
next week.
