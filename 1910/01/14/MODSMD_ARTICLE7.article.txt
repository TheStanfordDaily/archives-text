Every thinking' member of the stu
dent body should read and absorb tHe
communication from the Quadrangle
Club, which appears in another col
umn of i his issue. This society takes
ihe lead in condemning certain state
ments which -directly reflect upon honor
societies, their methods and members.
The "Sequoia" asserted that many
people would like to know why cer
tain "editors and the student body
president failed to be elected into
purely honorary societies." Today
the Quadrangle Club, rightfully as
suming itself to be "a purely honor
ary" body, undertakes to give the an
swer. The case of the student body
president and the case of the only
editor, who is not a member of the
club and at the same time has been
in office long enough to even presume
to membership, are considered spe
cifically. The reasons for the exclus
ion, if true, are adequate. The men
enrolled in the club assert that to the
best of their judgment the reasons
are as stated. Some may dispute
their judgment. That is only human
nature. But the honest belief of the
members in the actual existence of
thoroughly adequate reasons must be
accepted as a justification.
The Daily Palo Alto, however, feels
that the most important part of the
Quadrangle Club's communication is
that which both suggests and requests
an immediate settlement of the entire
question raised by the "Sequoia" ar
ticle. To permit this, the editor of
the "Sequoia" must present his facts
now. No benefit whatever can come of
delay. May the editor in question rea
lize Ibis and act accordingly.
