We print today two communica
tions, from Mr. Theile and Mr. Lin
dauer, respectively, which take issue
with certain assertions made hy the
Quadrangle Club in its communica
tion of last Friday.
Mr. Theile gives us a dignified and
straightforward statement of his
knowledge of those dealings to which
the Quadrangle Club is presumed to
have referred as "questionable politi
cal manipulation." With Mr. Theile's
account as his basis, Mr. Lindauer
comes to the natural conclusion that
the argument of the Quadrangle Club
is fallacious. We say "natural con
clusion," for no other end can be
reached, once we assume that Mr.
Theile's statements contain all the
facts connected with the subject. We
do not in the slightest degree mean to
insinuate that anything which that
gentleman has said is untrue or that
he has withheld anything within his
knowledge. But did he know all ?
Does his communication contain every
material fact pertinent to the subject?
If it does, the Quadrangle Club is ut
terly in the wrong with regard to the
"questionable political manipulation."
If it does not, it is for the Quadrangle
Club to substantiate its statements
with proof; and the same should be
done with all possible celerity. The
editor of the "Sequoia" has promised
to rush the coming issue of the mag
azine in order that the entire affair
may be cleared up the sooner. The
Quadrangle Club requested haste.
Should it now have positive proof to
adduce, it should take its own advice
and avoid all delay.
We dislike urging further public
statements, which can not fail to in
crease the factional strife. But we
believe that matters have already pro
ceeded I of) far to be stopped short of
an absolute settlement of the case
one way or the other.
