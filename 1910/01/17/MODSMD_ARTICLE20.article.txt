### 
Taking for his text, the nineteenth
verse of the eighth chapter of Acts,
"(Jive me also this power," Dr. J. W.
Cochran, of Philadelphia, preached a
remarkably strong sermon yesterday
morning in the University Chapel.
The central theme of his thoughtful
address was an appeal for all men to
realize their possibilities and to store
their resources for active work in the
world.
He said in part: "There is no more
power or truth to-day than there was
four hundred years ago, only at the
present time, it is dynamic rather
than static. Search for this power
and truth, and if you find it, you stand
out and above the crowd.
"Don't be afraid to be peculiar and
eccentric. Peculiarity and eccentric
ity are not disgraceful qualities, for
they only indicate a discovery of truth
and a dislike to ape ability and follow
fashion. To discover your difference
from everybody else is to discover
Life."
