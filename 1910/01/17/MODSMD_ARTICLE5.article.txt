# STUDENTS ANSWER COMMUNICATION
## Theile and Lindauer Write Replies Strongly Disputing Statements In Recent Letter of Quadrangle Club. Communication from W.C. Theile. 
### 
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
In its communication to the Daily
Palo Alto in the issue of Friday last.
the Quadrangle Club, in offering to
explain why J. E. Shelton, President
of the Student Body, has never been
elected to membership in that organi
zation, states that "he has made him
self ineligible through the sidetrack
ing of another very available and
popular candidate by means of politi
cal manipulation." Realizing that
such a statement, coming as it does
from such an influential organization
as the Quadrangle Club, would, unless
answered and explained, unjustly
condemn the highest officer of the
Student Body and place him in a po
sition of contempt in the eyes of the
faculty and students generally, I beg
leave, in justice to Mr. Shelton, to
submit the following facts in order
that the university public may judge
for itself whether or not the Quad
rangle Club's attack on Mr. Shelton's
character was justifiable.
If the reader will recall the politi
cal situation near the close of last
year, it will be remembered that the
candidates for the three leading
offices were: ,T. E. Shelton, for Presi
dent; D. \V. Burbank and P. W. Tur-j
ner, for Graduate Manager; and C. H.
Hails, for Editor of the Daily Palo
Alto. This situation remained un
changed until the afternoon preceding
the day on which the student body
officers for the ensuing year were to
be nominated. When it became known
that afternoon that, owing to pressure
being brought to bear upon Hails, by
the same clique who were supporting
Burbank for Graduate Manager, to
shift his' candidacy for Editor of the
Daily Palo Alto, a position to which
lie aspired, to candidacy against Shel
ton for President, it was apparent that
this clique were attempting to gain
absolute control of Student Body of
fices. Upon Hails' announcement as
candidate for President, I decided to
do my utmost to prevent the success
ful culmination of the above scheme.
Thereupon, I announced my candidacy
for Graduate Manager.
Now conies the facts of the "politi
cal manipulation" which the Quad
rangle Club attributes to Shelton.
That evening D. W. Burbank, accom
panied by A. E. Roth, came to my
room at the Delta Upsilon house and
asked to have a conference with me.
After some discussion and in the
presence of Roth, Cortex Shelton and
myself, Burbank. unsolicited by Shel
ton or me. in substance advanced the
following proposition: "If I can as
sure you that Hails will not run for
President of the Student Body, will
you withdraw as a candidate against
me ?" 112 answered that this assurance
would have to be definite before I
would entertain the proposition. Bur
bank thereupon went to the Phi Delta
Theta house and talked with Hails.
He then returned to my room, and in
the presence of the above parties as
sured me definitely that Hails would
not run for the presidency. Upon this
assurance, I withdrew my candidacy.

feeling that I had accomplished that
which 1 had set out to do, namely, the
prevention of absolute control of Stu
| dent Body offices by one clique or
element.
The above stated proposition was
made to me without my solicitation
and without the knowledge of Presi
dent Shetlon, and my acceptance of it
was likewise without his knowledge.
In making the above explanation, 1
wish it distinctly understood that my
purpose is merely to exonerate Presi
dent Shelton, and that this article is
not written with the intention of
casting reflection upon the Quad
rangle Club or upon the above men
tioned individuals who participated
in the so-called "questionable politi
cal manipulation."
