Editor Daily Palo Alto:
The recent letter of the Quadrangle
I Club concerning the reputation and
character of certain prominent stu
dents seems scarcely calculated to
promote that harmony and unity of
the Student Body which the club itself
claims to advocate. In bitter, unmis
takable and harsh language it has nn
j deavored to discipline two unfortu
nate students, who by force of sheer
ability have attained to leadership
in several branches of student activ
ity, but who, in the unflinching per
formance of their duty, have incurred
I the displeasure of the self-constituted
guardians of the Stanford Spirit. At
the risk, however, of still further
widening the breach which has been
created, 1 should like, as an humble
member of the Student Body, to take
issue with certain statements made by
the Quadrangle Club. 1 am fully
aware that the Quadrangle Club
counts in its membership many of the
real, loyal leaders of student, opinion
and 1 wish it distinctly understood
that, in employing the name "Quad
rangle." 1 refer only to those members
who, at the expense of a united Stan
ford Spirit, are venting their per
sonal spleen under the thin cloak of a
club name.
The Quadrangle Club has gracious
ly revealed its qualifications for mem
bership and it is plain that neither
social, nor personal attributes enter
into such eligibility. To quote, "the
president of the Student Body can
never belong to the Quadrangle Club.
He has made himself ineligible." Now,
according to the published declara
tions of the club's principles, in order
to make himself ineligible President
Shelton must have done something
which "would hurt the good name of
Stanford." Let us see, then, what ar
guments the Quadrangle Club adduces
to support this accusation. The sole
charges made are found in the follow
ing lines: "The gentleman under
consideration was not, we feel, the ac
tual choice of the majority of the
Student Body for the position, but
was elected to it through the side
tracking of another very available
and popular candidate by means of
questionable political manipulation."
In brief. President Shelton is charged
with being guilty of "questionable po
litical manipulation." The letter of
\V. C. Theile in another part of this
issue clearly indicates that, whatever
political manipulation may have ex
isted, was neither instigated nor par
ticipated in by Shelton, but on the
contrary, by our friends, the conser
vitors of Stanford morality, Ihe final
judges of what constitutes hurting
the good name of Stanford. Thus, Hie
only argument advanced by the Quad
rangle Club fails of proof and falls
dismally to the ground. Surely, it
cannot be that Shelton has hurt the
good name of Stanford merely be
cause lie has persisted in demanding
punctual and accurate reports from
§tudent Body officers, and in every
possible way insuring a businesslike
administration of student finances.
Therefore, we can only interpret the
response of the Quadrangle Club as
either a personal attack upon these
members of our Student Body, which
we are loathe to believe, since con
geniality does not seem to be a pre
requisite, or else, as a preeminent ex
ample of the influences alluded to in
a recent "Sequoia" article. It is
hardly necesasry to support the in
ference from the Quadrangle article
that Shelton has qualified as a leader.
Yet, I cannot forbear calling attention
to the fact that the record of this
man, whom the Student Body and his
class have seen fit to place in almost
every position requiring executive
ability and moral responsibility, and
who has participated in every form of
student activity from athletics to the
winning of the highest intercollegiate
debating honors, will compare favor
ably with the records of the members
of the Quadrangle Club. Plainly, he
has more than qualified under the
rules published by that organization.
The reflections on Editor Leaf
scarcely deserve notice further than
to call attention to the fact that of all
the men who fitted the term eligible
"editors", he alone was singled out
for attack for no other reason than
that he had dared through his maga
zine to oppose the machinations of
selfish men. "Dug" Perry, "Hi" Fisk,
"Geoff" Morgan rapidly come to mind.
Were and are they not leaders of
student interests ? Did they ever hurt
the good name of Stanford further
than to incur the displeasure of cer
tain self-appointed generalissimos in
Stanford life ?
The Quadrangle Club is entitled to
its belief as to the wishes of the Stu
dent Body in the matter of the last
election, even though this belief is
readily explainable by the exclusive
circle in which the membership there
of moves. The facts, however, tend to
deny the truth of this belief. For
every means was exhausted by certain
members of the Quadrangle Club in a
frantic effort to defeat the incumbent.
The failure to find a receptive candi
date conipellingly disproves the valid
ity of the belief. I have taken the
trouble to demonstrate President
Shelton's undeniable eligibility ac
cording to the published qualifica
tions, not that he would consider
membership in such an organization,
but to show that the Quadrangle
Club's explanation was based either
on a deliberate or an ignorant false
hood. That the charge of "question
able political manipulation" on the
part of President Shelton is false can
riot he disputed. That at least one
member of the sacred Quadrangle
Club was cognizant of its falsity is

likewise true. That he was at least a
silent sponsor of the bargain referred
to is evident. Under these circum
stances, is the earnest solicitation of
the Quadrangle Club for the welfare
of Stanford above suspicion ?
To an unbiased observer it must
seem as if the "Sequoia" attacked, not
the honor societies as such, but the
very limited clique which controls
their elective policies. In view of
this, the virulent outburst of the
Quadrangle Club can only be inter
preted as the child of a guilty con
science, as eloquent external evidence
that the clique alluded to is even
strong enough to shape the published
sentiments of the organization.
It has been intimated that no out
sider should have the temerity to crit
cise the elective policy of the Quad
rangle Club. No one would deny that
the Press Club, or Skull and Snakes,
or any other club of a similar nature,
in which congeniality and fellowship
are important factors, should he free
to elect only such men as are not per
sonally obnoxious to some of the
members. . Hut the Quadrangle Club
professes to be composed wholly of
leaders, personalities being secondary,
and, in excluding the official leader
of the Student Bodjv. it exposes itself
to the condemnation of the humblest
member of the Student Hody. If the
Quadrangle Club is merely a social or
private organization, let it sail under
its true colors and no outsider can
then question its policy. Meanwhile,
let it cease to presume, either collect
ively or individually, to dictate the
college destinies of college men.

To an unbiased observer it must
seem as if the "Sequoia" attacked, not
the honor societies as such, but the
very limited clique which controls

Editor Daily Palo Alto:
The recent letter of the Quadrangle
I Club concerning the reputation and
character of certain prominent stu
dents seems scarcely calculated to
promote that harmony and unity of
the Student Body which the club itself
claims to advocate. In bitter, unmis
takable and harsh language it has nn
j deavored to discipline two unfortu
nate students, who by force of sheer
ability have attained to leadership
in several branches of student activ
ity, but who, in the unflinching per
formance of their duty, have incurred
I the displeasure of the self-constituted
guardians of the Stanford Spirit. At
the risk, however, of still further
widening the breach which has been
created, 1 should like, as an humble
member of the Student Body, to take
issue with certain statements made by
the Quadrangle Club. 1 am fully
aware that the Quadrangle Club
counts in its membership many of the
real, loyal leaders of student, opinion
and 1 wish it distinctly understood
that, in employing the name "Quad
rangle." 1 refer only to those members
who, at the expense of a united Stan
ford Spirit, are venting their per
sonal spleen under the thin cloak of a
club name.
The Quadrangle Club has gracious
ly revealed its qualifications for mem
bership and it is plain that neither
social, nor personal attributes enter
into such eligibility. To quote, "the
president of the Student Body can
never belong to the Quadrangle Club.
He has made himself ineligible." Now,
according to the published declara
tions of the club's principles, in order
to make himself ineligible President
Shelton must have done something
which "would hurt the good name of
Stanford." Let us see, then, what ar
guments the Quadrangle Club adduces
to support this accusation. The sole
charges made are found in the follow
ing lines: "The gentleman under
consideration was not, we feel, the ac
tual choice of the majority of the
Student Body for the position, but
was elected to it through the side
tracking of another very available
and popular candidate by means of
questionable political manipulation."
In brief. President Shelton is charged
with being guilty of "questionable po
litical manipulation." The letter of
\V. C. Theile in another part of this
issue clearly indicates that, whatever
political manipulation may have ex
isted, was neither instigated nor par
ticipated in by Shelton, but on the
contrary, by our friends, the conser
vitors of Stanford morality, Ihe final
judges of what constitutes hurting
the good name of Stanford. Thus, Hie
only argument advanced by the Quad
rangle Club fails of proof and falls
dismally to the ground. Surely, it
cannot be that Shelton has hurt the
good name of Stanford merely be
cause lie has persisted in demanding
punctual and accurate reports from
§tudent Body officers, and in every
possible way insuring a businesslike
administration of student finances.
Therefore, we can only interpret the
response of the Quadrangle Club as
either a personal attack upon these
members of our Student Body, which
we are loathe to believe, since con
geniality does not seem to be a pre
requisite, or else, as a preeminent ex
ample of the influences alluded to in
a recent "Sequoia" article. It is
hardly necesasry to support the in
ference from the Quadrangle article
that Shelton has qualified as a leader.
Yet, I cannot forbear calling attention
to the fact that the record of this
man, whom the Student Body and his
class have seen fit to place in almost
every position requiring executive
ability and moral responsibility, and
who has participated in every form of
student activity from athletics to the
winning of the highest intercollegiate
debating honors, will compare favor
ably with the records of the members
of the Quadrangle Club. Plainly, he
has more than qualified under the

I the displeasure of the self-constituted
guardians of the Stanford Spirit. At
the risk, however, of still further
widening the breach which has been
created, 1 should like, as an humble
member of the Student Body, to take
issue with certain statements made by
the Quadrangle Club. 1 am fully
aware that the Quadrangle Club
counts in its membership many of the
real, loyal leaders of student, opinion
and 1 wish it distinctly understood
that, in employing the name "Quad
rangle." 1 refer only to those members
who, at the expense of a united Stan
ford Spirit, are venting their per
sonal spleen under the thin cloak of a
club name.
The Quadrangle Club has gracious
ly revealed its qualifications for mem
bership and it is plain that neither
social, nor personal attributes enter
into such eligibility. To quote, "the
president of the Student Body can
never belong to the Quadrangle Club.
He has made himself ineligible." Now,
according to the published declara
tions of the club's principles, in order
to make himself ineligible President
Shelton must have done something
which "would hurt the good name of
Stanford." Let us see, then, what ar
guments the Quadrangle Club adduces
to support this accusation. The sole
charges made are found in the follow
ing lines: "The gentleman under
consideration was not, we feel, the ac
tual choice of the majority of the
Student Body for the position, but
was elected to it through the side
tracking of another very available
and popular candidate by means of
questionable political manipulation."
In brief. President Shelton is charged
with being guilty of "questionable po
litical manipulation." The letter of
\V. C. Theile in another part of this
issue clearly indicates that, whatever
political manipulation may have ex
isted, was neither instigated nor par
ticipated in by Shelton, but on the
contrary, by our friends, the conser
vitors of Stanford morality, Ihe final
judges of what constitutes hurting
the good name of Stanford. Thus, Hie
only argument advanced by the Quad
rangle Club fails of proof and falls
dismally to the ground. Surely, it
cannot be that Shelton has hurt the
good name of Stanford merely be
cause lie has persisted in demanding
punctual and accurate reports from
§tudent Body officers, and in every
possible way insuring a businesslike
administration of student finances.
Therefore, we can only interpret the
response of the Quadrangle Club as
either a personal attack upon these
members of our Student Body, which
we are loathe to believe, since con
geniality does not seem to be a pre
requisite, or else, as a preeminent ex
ample of the influences alluded to in
a recent "Sequoia" article. It is
hardly necesasry to support the in
ference from the Quadrangle article
that Shelton has qualified as a leader.
Yet, I cannot forbear calling attention
to the fact that the record of this
man, whom the Student Body and his
class have seen fit to place in almost
every position requiring executive
ability and moral responsibility, and
who has participated in every form of
student activity from athletics to the
winning of the highest intercollegiate
debating honors, will compare favor
ably with the records of the members
of the Quadrangle Club. Plainly, he
has more than qualified under the
rules published by that organization.
The reflections on Editor Leaf
scarcely deserve notice further than
to call attention to the fact that of all
the men who fitted the term eligible
"editors", he alone was singled out
for attack for no other reason than
that he had dared through his maga
zine to oppose the machinations of
selfish men. "Dug" Perry, "Hi" Fisk,
"Geoff" Morgan rapidly come to mind.
Were and are they not leaders of
student interests ? Did they ever hurt
the good name of Stanford further
than to incur the displeasure of cer
tain self-appointed generalissimos in
Stanford life ?
The Quadrangle Club is entitled to
its belief as to the wishes of the Stu
dent Body in the matter of the last
election, even though this belief is
readily explainable by the exclusive
circle in which the membership there
of moves. The facts, however, tend to
deny the truth of this belief. For
every means was exhausted by certain
members of the Quadrangle Club in a
frantic effort to defeat the incumbent.
The failure to find a receptive candi
date conipellingly disproves the valid
ity of the belief. I have taken the
trouble to demonstrate President
Shelton's undeniable eligibility ac
cording to the published qualifica
tions, not that he would consider
membership in such an organization,
but to show that the Quadrangle
Club's explanation was based either
on a deliberate or an ignorant false
hood. That the charge of "question
able political manipulation" on the
part of President Shelton is false can
riot he disputed. That at least one
member of the sacred Quadrangle
Club was cognizant of its falsity is

likewise true. That he was at least a
silent sponsor of the bargain referred
to is evident. Under these circum
stances, is the earnest solicitation of
the Quadrangle Club for the welfare
of Stanford above suspicion ?
To an unbiased observer it must
seem as if the "Sequoia" attacked, not
the honor societies as such, but the
very limited clique which controls
their elective policies. In view of
this, the virulent outburst of the
Quadrangle Club can only be inter
preted as the child of a guilty con
science, as eloquent external evidence
that the clique alluded to is even
strong enough to shape the published
sentiments of the organization.
It has been intimated that no out
sider should have the temerity to crit
cise the elective policy of the Quad
rangle Club. No one would deny that
the Press Club, or Skull and Snakes,
or any other club of a similar nature,
in which congeniality and fellowship
are important factors, should he free
to elect only such men as are not per
sonally obnoxious to some of the
members. . Hut the Quadrangle Club
professes to be composed wholly of
leaders, personalities being secondary,
and, in excluding the official leader
of the Student Bodjv. it exposes itself
to the condemnation of the humblest
member of the Student Hody. If the
Quadrangle Club is merely a social or
private organization, let it sail under
its true colors and no outsider can
then question its policy. Meanwhile,
let it cease to presume, either collect
ively or individually, to dictate the
college destinies of college men.

Editor Daily Palo Alto:
The recent letter of the Quadrangle
I Club concerning the reputation and
character of certain prominent stu
dents seems scarcely calculated to
promote that harmony and unity of
the Student Body which the club itself
claims to advocate. In bitter, unmis
takable and harsh language it has nn
j deavored to discipline two unfortu
nate students, who by force of sheer
ability have attained to leadership
in several branches of student activ
ity, but who, in the unflinching per
formance of their duty, have incurred
I the displeasure of the self-constituted
guardians of the Stanford Spirit. At
the risk, however, of still further
widening the breach which has been
created, 1 should like, as an humble
member of the Student Body, to take
issue with certain statements made by
the Quadrangle Club. 1 am fully
