Editor Daily Palo Alto:
The recent letter of the Quadrangle
I Club concerning the reputation and
character of certain prominent stu
dents seems scarcely calculated to
promote that harmony and unity of
the Student Body which the club itself
claims to advocate. In bitter, unmis
takable and harsh language it has nn
j deavored to discipline two unfortu
nate students, who by force of sheer
ability have attained to leadership
in several branches of student activ
ity, but who, in the unflinching per
formance of their duty, have incurred
I the displeasure of the self-constituted
guardians of the Stanford Spirit. At
the risk, however, of still further
widening the breach which has been
created, 1 should like, as an humble
member of the Student Body, to take
issue with certain statements made by
the Quadrangle Club. 1 am fully
aware that the Quadrangle Club
counts in its membership many of the
real, loyal leaders of student, opinion
and 1 wish it distinctly understood
that, in employing the name "Quad
rangle." 1 refer only to those members
who, at the expense of a united Stan
ford Spirit, are venting their per
sonal spleen under the thin cloak of a
club name.
The Quadrangle Club has gracious

bership and it is plain that neither
social, nor personal attributes enter
into such eligibility. To quote, "the
president of the Student Body can
never belong to the Quadrangle Club.
He has made himself ineligible." Now,
according to the published declara
tions of the club's principles, in order
to make himself ineligible President
Shelton must have done something
which "would hurt the good name of
Stanford." Let us see, then, what ar
guments the Quadrangle Club adduces
to support this accusation. The sole
charges made are found in the follow
ing lines: "The gentleman under
consideration was not, we feel, the ac
tual choice of the majority of the
Student Body for the position, but
was elected to it through the side
tracking of another very available
and popular candidate by means of
