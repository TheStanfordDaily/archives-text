### 
The date of the monster track rally
which will inaugurate the season of
1910 has been definitely set, and next
Friday evening, in the Encina club
rooms, all those who desire to take up
track work during the spring will
sign up, after which training rules
will go into effect. The program for
the rally has not as yet .been arranged,
but, it, is probable that Dr. Angrill and
Captain Scott will address the men
on the prospects for a victory while
"Dad" Moulton will enliven the occa
sion with a few of his usually facte
ious remarks.
As most of the men who have com
peted in the past on track and field
have signified their intention of again
taking part in this branch of athletics,
an especial attempt will be made to
bring out, new material. On account
of the prospective dearth of men is
many of the events, "Dad" wishes
everyone who possibly can to come
out and begin work immediately.
There is all the opportunity in the
world, according to Trainer Moulton,
for a new man to make the team this
year, and particularly he desires more
Freshmen than ever to train, as Cal
ifornia usually outnumbers Stanford
in the Freshman meet by more than
two to one.
About forty men were on the track
Saturday doing light work, and if the
rain holds off during the week a
much larger number is expected to
turn out. Regular training will not
begin until after the rally when the
men will be expected to do daily
work.
There is a. possibility of the return
of H. E. Heed, '10, the sprinter, to the
track this year. Reed had not in
tended to train for the cinder path
this spring, but is now undecided as
to the course which he will pursue.
H. L. Horton, '09. the Cardinal giant
representative in the shot and the
hurdles, will be back in college some
time this week, according to the best
information. Some misgiving had
arisen as to bis return, but this can
be safely set aside, and his points will
be available in April.
