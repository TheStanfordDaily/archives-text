Editor "Daily Palo Alto:"
Demand having been made by the
Quadrangle Club in its communica
tion in last Friday's "Daily Palo Alto"
for an immediate substantiation of the
charges made in the last issue of the
"Sequoia," I desire to point, out the
impossibility of such an action since
lack of space would prevent the pub
lication of such an article in the col
umns of the"Daily Palo Alto," and it
is manifestly impracticable to issue
a special edition of the "Sequoia" for
this purpose. Work on the next "Se
quoia" will, however, be rushed and
the magazine will appear earlier than
would otherwise be the case.
