The abuse of a harmlessly amusing
custom should not be tolerated in
silence. Therefore, the Daily Palo
Alto believes itself justified in offer
ing a suggestion in regard to public
initiations 011 the campus. Laugh
able and diverting, such public initia
tions are of themselves altogether to
be desired, but there have been a few
specific instances of a not too careful
discrimination as to the tone and
character of portions of the ceremony.
It must be borne in mind that by
scheduling the performances for the
quad or post-office, the presence of
every passer-by, man or woman, is
impliedly requested. The "stunts"
can not fail to be witnessed by a large
number of university women. The
Daily Palo Alto does not believe that
comedy of a low or questionable order
is ever sought intentionally and pre
ineditatively by the neophytes or the
members of the initiating organiza
tion. On the contrary, we believe that
the occasional breaches are due to
natural excitement attendant upon the
event. But this does not jusify even
their spasmodic occurence. Surely,
there is enough fun of the right sort
left in the world to supply the demand.
