To the Students' Guild:
Owing to the inability of the Guild
Board to obtain a suitable location
for an isolation hospital within Uni
versity territory all patients with con
tagious diseases will hereafter be
quarantined in their dwellings.
The State laws and the health re
quirements of the town of Palo Alto
strictly forbid the moving of any con
tagious cases within the town limits.
The Peninsula Hospital also refuses
to care for such cases.
Moreover the Board of Trustees of
the University has not seen fit to
grant permission for the establish
ment of such a hospital within camp
us boundaries. Consequently the only
alternative will be to quarantine all
future contagious cases within the
patient's dwelling, or such portion of
it as the health authorities may deem
necessary.
