# INSTALL TELEPHONE EXCHANGE.
## Campus Service Improved by the Establishment of New Station In Post Office. 
### 
A new telephone exchange is being
installed on the campus by the Pa
cific States Telephone Company to
handle the calls from the Campus and
the immediate vicinity. The exchange
which consists of two switch-boards,
under the charge of one operator, will
he located in the Post Office building
in the room formerly occupied by
the Telegraph Company.
As about seventy-five per cent of the
calls received from the campus are
for other houses located nearby, the
installation of the exchange will re
lieve a severe tax on the Palo Alto
office of the company and result in a
great improvement of the service. The
officials of the Telephone Company
have not yet decided as to who is to
take charge of the station, but there
is a possibility of its management
being placed in the hands of students.
