matters of importance were decided
upon. It was voted to tender a re
ception to the faculty similar to the
one held in the spring semester of
1909, and President A. F. Meston, '10,
appointed a committee composed of
J. P. Hemphill, '09, W. S. Porter, '11,
and G. F. Morgan, '10, chairman, to
take charge of the affair.
J. E. Thompson, '11, brought up the
matter of re-opening the old fire place
in the clubroom, and his suggestions
were favorably acted upon by the club.
Although the club has tried unsuc
cessfully to secure the use of the old
fire place on several other occasions,
hope has not been entirely abandoned.

and ,T. E. Thompson, '11, chairman,
compose the committee which will en
deavor to secure this much needed
improvement, for the club.

America, addressed the men at the
conclusion of the business meeting on
the work of the Volunteers.
