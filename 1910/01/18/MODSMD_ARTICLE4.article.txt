# BASEBALL MEN NOW TOTAL SO.
## No Squads Formed Yet, and Will Not Be Until Later Worswick Hurt. 
### 
With eighty men working every
day on the supplementary diamond
the cardinal baseball season shows
promise of being an unusually suc
cessful one. Coach Presley has not
attempted to separate the players into
squads, and will not do so for some
time. A varsity squad cannot be or
ganized for two weeks at least,
since every man is being given a
thorough tryout in batting and lield
ing, with the view to finding out the
best of his ability. Several of the
difficult infield positions may be filled
with greater ease than was first
thought possible, and there will be
keen competition for places among
the new and old men. Promising
material is developing for short-stop.
Eligible pitchers will be scarce.
Two new names have been added to
the list of candidates. They are: J.
T. Cooper, '12, and 11. E. Reed, '10
This is Reed's first appearance on the
field. He will be one of the strongest
available men on the pitching staff.
S. D. Worswick, '18, twisted his
knee yesterday afternoon while play
ing second-base. It is the recurrence
of an old injury received during the
recent rugby season.
Forty-three men have signed up for
baseball at California, under Captain
Lewis, the short-stop.
