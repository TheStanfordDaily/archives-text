# CONSIDER NEW PLANS
## QUAD BOARD HOLDS HOLDS IMPORTANT BUSINESS MEETING. Junior Editors to Feature Many Clever Ideas in Annual. New Appointments Made. 
### 
A most successful meeting was
participated in by the full membership
of the 1911 "Quad" Board and Board
of Control yesterday evening at. the
Walden Club, at which progress of
the past semester was reported upon
and final plans for the completion
of the Junior annual were discussed.
As the business manager, C. A.
Christin has let the contract for the
printing of the book to the well
known H. S. Crocker Company, of San
Francisco, Editor L. L. Hill spoke of
the necessity of the early submitting
of copy to the printer so as to hurry
the publication of the "Quad." The
printing firm stands out in its reputa
tion of being the largest and mobt
complete establishment on the Pacific
Coast and the manager and editors
feel that it is fully competent to un
dertake the work. This same com
pany printed Volume 1, the '96 "Quad,"
and several others among the early
annuals, ft was prevented from the
publication of the '07 "Quad" by the
earthquake.
In outlining his plans. Editor Hill
spoke of the need of enlivening the
present overabundance of statistical
matter in the book by clever pen
pnd ink work and of his desire to fill
til) the large number of blank pages
with appropriate matter. It is felt
that the "Quad" as now constituted
excels rather in its bulk than in its
quality.
The "Quad" Board wishes all the
various organizations and societies to
hurry the taking of their pictures, so
that, the cats can be made early this
semester. As the engraving is of
unusually high order, only the late
submitting of the cuts to the printer
can prevent ihe book from being an
artistic success. A large number of
new and interesting pictures of col
lege life, which have never been
I thought possible to photograph before
have been secured by the editors of
i the "Quad" and will, together with
j the beautifully tinted art work, be the
jfeature of the book.
The appointment c>f two new mem
bers of the editorial board has been
j announced by Editor Hill. F. H. Hil
ton. who has been assisting in the
photographic work, has been given
charge of the Organization and Honor
Society departments, left vacant by
the failure of W. H. McConnell to
return to college. Miss H. Park has
been appointed to the Art department
and the excellence of her work will
undoubtedly be a valuable asset to
the annual.
The editorial Board will have its
picture taken at Davey's studio, Fri
day afternoon at one o'clock.
