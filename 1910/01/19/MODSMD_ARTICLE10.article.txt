Every able-bodied man in the stu
dent. body, who can spare the time,
and, especially, every such able-bodied
underclassman, should sign up as a
member of the 1910 track squad in an
endeavor to give Trainer Moulton
every possible opportunity to develop
a team which will vanquish California
on track and field next April. True,
many will fail to qualify as members
of the varsity team, but it is equally
true that a quantity of unknown and
valuable material would be found. No
one, who has not tried, knows what he
can or can not do on the cinder path
or in the jumps and weights. The
meet with the Blue and Gold can be
won only by the Cardinal displaying
a vast superiority in the matter of
second and third-place men. Stan
ford possesses a few "star" athletes.
In all probability, Stanford also pos
sesses an abundance of men, each of
whom could secure one, two or three
points. The appearance of an un
usually large number of candidates is
the only practicable method by which
these minor, but nevertheless highly
important, point-winners can be found
and utilized. Come out, and give
"Dad" Moulton a fair chance.
