# FRESHMAN TEAM WINS
## SOPHOMORES ARE WORSTED ANNUAL CONTEST. Strong Arguments of 1913 Representatives Offset Superior Delivery of Second-Year Men. 
### 
For the first time almost in the his
tory of the university the Freshmen
were declared the winners of the an
nual underclass debate which was
held last evening in the Chapel. Al
though the Sophomores had clearly
the advantage in delivery the Fresh
men made up for their deficiencies in
this line by the strength and excel
lence of their argument. At every
stage of the debate they successfully
refuted the arguments of their oppo
nents and brought forward facts that
could not be refuted. The vote of
the judges however, was not unani
mous.
The question debated was: "Re
solved â€”That the State should nomi
nate all candidates for elective of
fices by the direct primary system."
The Freshmen, W r . E. Simpson, A. G.
Bradford, and K. E. Leib, upheld the
affirmative, while the negative was
supported by M. E. Grimes, H. R.
Person and N. C. Wilson. Each
speaker had ten minutes in which to
advance his arguments and the af
firmative had three minutes for re
buttal. The presiding officer was J.
E. Shelton, '10; the judges, Prof. H.
L. Smith of the Law department, and
Profs. B. E. Howard and J. M. Mot
ley of the department of Economics.
The first speaker of the evening
was W. E Simpson He showed first
the importance of the question and
its relation to the welfare of the
nation, and then traced the history
of the system that now prevails, the
convention system. He then pointed
out in detail its principal evils. Mr.
Simpson's delivery was a little ner
vous but the facts and arguments ad
vanced were sound and to the .point.
The first speaker of the negative
was INI. E Grimes He showed that in
the two strongest direct primary
states. Wisconsin and Oregon, a
strong political machine had been
built up by the supporters of the
system. His style of address was
forceful and was marked by strong,
virile gestures, but the arguments
advanced did not clash with those
of the first speaker.
The second speaker on the affirma
tive was A. G. Bradford. He pointed
out that the arguments of the opposi
tion regarding the cities controlling
tiie county and state were fallacious,
and in conclusion showed the true
conditions in Oregon which had been
in dispute throughout the evening.
The next speaker was H. R. Person.
He interpreted the conditions in Wis
consin as seen by the opponents of
the direct primary, and said further
that a poor man was prevented from
running for office because of the
enormous expenses of the direct pri
mary campaign. His delivery was
good and his gestures expressive, but

his treatment of the subject was
rather superficial.
K. E. Leib was the third speaker
on Ihe affirmative. He showed that
the corruption of the present system
of itself demanded a change, and to
support his statements cited the ex
ample of the corruption in Missouri
during the time of Folk's graft in
vestigations. His debate was - clear
and kept closely to the subject in
hand.
N. C. Wilson closed for the nega
tive. He quoted from the favorable
comment of the San Francisco bosses
on the law after the recent election,
and showed that whereas cities have
controlled a portion of the field in
the past, under the proposed change
they would all oltices. His speech
was marked by a remarkable facility
and ease.
Simpson's refutation was forceful
and pertinent.
