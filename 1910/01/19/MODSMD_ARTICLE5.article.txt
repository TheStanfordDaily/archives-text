# DR. J.W. COCHRAN SPEAKS ON THE IDEALS OF COLLEGE MEN
## Urges Students to Work for Civic Good and Declares This Period an Age of Duty and Social Service Work. 
### 
Whether Dr. J. W. Cochran, who
spoke this morning before the stud
ents at the first regular Assembly is
an optimistic man is not actually
known, but he obviously placed him
self in that class when lie declared
that the present is not an age
predominated by materialism nor
commercialism, but is an age imbued
with the sense ol" duty. He believes
we have our rights now, and it is our
duty to act on them.
The speech made by Dr. Cochran
was on the subject, "The Ideals of a
College Man," and was listened to by
an appreciative audience, which show
ed its interest in what he had to say
by enthusiastic applause.
Dr. Cochran was introduced by
President Jordan, and at once com
menced his subject by briefly com
menting on the favorable reception he
lias been given here, and declared thai
if he should remain 011 the campus a
few days longer, he believed he could
become a good local politician as well
as a social "lion."
That the college graduate is a good
man, and should "make good," in the
world was a conviction s; orglx
emphasized by the speaker. He be
lieves that the college man. who fails
to become a man in all senses of that
word, should never have entered aca
demic life, but instead should have
joined the ranks of the street laborers
and dish washers.
Dr. Cochran, declared also, that a
university was not a place merely to

obtain an education, but a place where
an education plus a good character
should be secured. The speaker dwelt
long 011 this phase of his lecture, and
explained lhat he believed the first
thing a student learned was to be
economically efficient. This, the Pliil
adelphian branded as an excellent ac
complishment, but condemned it when
it excluded all other purposes and
aims in life.
"Men in all professions can steal in
a subtle way," said Dr. Cochran, "and
still live in a respectable community."
To bring out this idea more clearly he
told in a dramatic manner about
the erection of the State Capital build
ing in Philadelphia, and the graft and
greed that figured in its construction.
Continuing, he declared that there
are two classes at Stanford. The class
interested in life at large, and a sec
ond class which thinks only of their
own material welfare. The latter, he
declared, always strives to wear the
wreath of victory but the first are
willing, if necessary, to don a thorned
crown.
In conclusion, Dr. Cochran urged
fhe students to attack the forces of
corruption at work on the Pacific
("oust, and take an active part in so
cial service.
Professor Sisson, of the Washington
State University, was present at the
Assembly, and said a. few words just
previous to Dr. Cochran's speech, in
regard to the impression the Univer
sity buildings made upon him.
