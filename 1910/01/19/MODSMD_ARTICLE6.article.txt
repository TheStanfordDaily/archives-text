# DIVIDES SQUAD FOR PRACTICE.
## Presley Makes Two Sections of Baseball Men for Greater Ease in Handling. 
### 
Because of the difficulty of handl
ing an unwieldy squad of eighty men,
Coach Presley this afternoon divided
the number into two sections. This
separation is merely a temporary one,
and is to enable the coach to better
judge of the merits of the men, with
the advantage of the smaller grouping.
The older men and a few of the new
will continue to practice batting and
fielding on the supplementary dia
mond. The others were this after
noon engaged in short practice games
on one of the other available diamonds
on the campus. They will remain
here but a short time, howerer, since
more mature plans of the coach will
be carried through in the near future
regarding the outline of the season's
work. The more important series of
games for the class championship can
not be started for two or three weeks.
A full schedule will be announced
at the end of that time.
Yesterday afternoon the pitchers
were given a chance for a short prac
tice in the l>ox against a chosen squad
of players. Balls and strikes were
called, and some sort of an organiza
tion was made preparatory to the
game with Santa Clara on Saturday.
Several catchers were also given an
opportunity to get into form.
