# DISCUSSES AGREEMENT
## ARTICLES OF INTERCOLLEGIATE COMPACT CONSIDERED. Executive Committee Also Names Dole to Succeed Fletcher.â€”Arrange For Loans. 
### 
The coming meeting of the com
mittee chosen to reframe the inter
collegiate agreement was the princi
pal topic of discussion at the meeting
of the executive committee last night.
As the members of the Agreement
Committee will go to San Francisco
uninstructed, the chief interest lay in
pointing out those paragraphs ol the
old agrement which need revision.
An unfortunate source of difficulty
and one which leads to much contus
ion relative to the agreement is the
i net that the printed copies in the pos
session of the universities differ one
with the other and also with the origi
nal text, it was suggested that uni
formity in the printed copies of the
new agreement be secured.
As the present agreemnt reads, it is
necessary for a person receiving
money from the university for doing
other than manual labor to be at
least of Junior standing before he is
allowed to lake part in intercollegiate
athletics. This clause was the subject
of much consideration, and it is be
lieved it will be modified so as to only
require an attendance of one year
prior to entering competition. Stu
dents who have transferred from
other universities are at present in
eligible for intercollegiate contests
for a period of one year after their
registration. To replace this, it has
been suggested that the clause be
made to read so that a period of one
year must elaspe since the student left
the college in which he was first reg
istered before he is allowed to enter
competition here. This would allow
men who have remained out of col
lege a year to register here and bo
considered eligible.
rt, is not yet known what changes
California advocates in the agreement,
as a new plan was adopted by both
universities in the matter of the agree
ment. The members of the com
mittees will be uninstructed and when
they have reached what appears to be
a working plan will report it back to
the executive committees of their re
spective institutions, which must
sanction on each clause before it will
be regarded as finally accepted.
The matter of rearranging the ten
nis contests with California was taken
up, and E. Jordan, gr.. explained the
position of the Stanford tennis men in
the matter. It was decided to author
ize Presiden Shelton to appoint a com
mittee of two to consult a similar from
California in regard to the proposed
changes, when they would be referred
back to the executive committees and
if acceptable incorporated in the In
tercollegiate Agreement.
The new agreement will in all prob
ability be limited to three or four
years as a present college generation
consists of this length of time. An
other agreement expiring at this time
is that regarding debating which will
be considered by the executive com
mittee later.
K. L. Dole, '11, was chosen to fill
the vacancy in the representation of
the Junior Class on the committee.

caused by the resignation of W. I).
Fletcher who is not registered this
semester. It was decided to pay $1">00
to the Hoard of Control as part of the
fund for the tip-keep of the athletic
fields, and to invest $2000 with the
Homestead Building and Loan Asso
ciation of Palo Alto, if six per cent
interest can he obtained on the money.
The advisability of granting medals
to the track men was also debated al
though no decision was finally reached.

of furnishing no supplies to track

adhered to, with the usual exception
that the varsity men will receive their
track suits.
