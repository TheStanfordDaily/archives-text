With this issue of the Daily Palo
L. L. Hill, '11, and J. C. Thomas, '12,
are advanced to associate editors,
both of these men having served dur
ing several semesters on the assist
ant staff. We also announce the ap
pointment as assistants of I. I. In
graham, '13, of Bristol, Conn., and P.
Eliel, '13, of Pasadena.
It is with sincere regret that we ac
cept the resignations of L. L. Frank,
'10, A. Taylor, '11, and F. M. Johnson,
'12.
As pointed out yesterday, the sign
ins up of a large number of men for
work on the track is a necessity. We
also wish to state that the attendance
of a large number at the rally to
morrow evening is an equal neces
sity. Do not delay becoming enthu
siastic until the day before the meet
with California. Begin now. If a Car
dinal team ever needed all the support
which Stanford has to give, it is the
1910 track team. Those who sign up
will do their best on the field. Those
who do not should do their best on the
bleachers and at the rallies.
