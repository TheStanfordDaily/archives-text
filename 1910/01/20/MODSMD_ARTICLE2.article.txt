# TO HAVE NEW TRAINING HOUSE.
## Board Of Control Authorizes Erection Of Track House On Western End of Field. 
### 
A track training house is the wel
come addition to Stanford athletic
equipment, which the Hoard of Con
trol announced last evening. The new
quarters are planned to relieve the
congested situation arising when sev
eral hundred men are training for the
different sports at the same time.
It was intended to erect them some
time during the past fall but owing to
a scarcity of funds the project was
postponed.
The site chosen for the building is
the western end of the varsity tracks,
and according to plans the new quar
ters will be up-to-date in every detail.
A broad veranda facing the tracks is
especially included in the plans to
give the athletes not in competition an
opportunity to view the events.
The situation of the house on the
western end of the field will destorv
the effect of the wind sweeping up
the straightaway and will be of im
mense advantage in protecting the
course. A hedge of eucalyptus and
Monterey cypress will be planted on
the northwest side of ihe tracks for
a similar purpose.
Plans for the training house are in
preparation by .T. M. Wadsworth, '10,
under the supervision of Professor C.
I?. Wing, and it is expected that ac
tual construction will soon commence, j
