# PLAN ROUSING RALLY
## FOURTH ANNUAL TRACK GATHERING TOMORROW NIGHT. Strong Speakers Will Address Enthusiastic Meeting in Encina Clubroom. 
### 
A rally to start the season right and
to convince prospective track men of
the necessity of signing up and taking
part in that sport this spring is sched
uled for tomorrow night at 7:30 in
Encina Hall Clubroom. Alhough the
team this year is fortunate in having
an encouraging number of depend
able first place men. yet. to make up
a strong group of track athletes, tliere
must be second and third place repre
sentatives to fill out the score. For
that reason the rally tomorrow even
ing will especially emphasize such a
condition, and convincing speakers
are slated to make an urgent appeal
for any and all men who have the
least idea of taking parr in the train
ing season.
Four well-known and enthusiastic
speakers will set the points at issue
before the audience. These are Train
er "Dad" Moulton, who will explain
his instructions for the spring's work,
especially several new rules made
this year for the first time in regard to
training. When the rules are to go
into effect, and what is to be required
of the men wil be spoken of. Follow
ing him' Captain L. S. Scott. '10, of the
track team, will make a personal ap
peal to the student body for support.
Other addresses will be heard from
Dr. F. Angel 1. chairman of the Faculty
Athletic Committee, who has been
present ai many previous rallies, and
Student Adviser A. E. Roth, '09. Songs
and yells will keep up the interest of i
the evening under the leadership of
yell-leaders A. E. Ehrhorn, '10, T. A.
De√üolt. '10, and ,T. E. Thompson, '11.
Immediately following the speeches
slips of paper will be given to the
men upon which they can sign up,
giving name and the event for which
they wish to train.
This is the fourth annual track
rally, and it has been a decidedly live
institution during the three years in
which it lias been held. An atten
dance from the students at large, com
fortably filling the ball, has been the
order in past years, and the same
may be expected at Encina Friday
night.
