# ST. VINCENT GAMES CANCELLED.
## Southern College Unable To Play On Campus on March 11 and 12, As Planned. 
### 
Saint Vincent will not meet the
Varsity on the local diamond on
March 11 and 12, as was planned in
t lie original schedule. Graduate
Manager Burbank received news yes
terday from the Southern college's
management that owing to the fact,
that games could not be satisfactorily
arranged with the University of Cali
fornia, the team could not make the
Northern trip.
The Varsity will, however, cross
bats with the Saint Vincent nine in
l.os Angeles on February 24 and 25, as
now scheduled, unless something un
foreseen occurs, and the dates made
vacant by the cancelation of the cam
pus games will probably be filled with
some of the many local teams that are
anxious to meet the Varsity.
