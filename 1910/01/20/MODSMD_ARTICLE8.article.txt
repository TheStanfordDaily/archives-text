# TENNIS OUTLOOK BRIGHT.
## All The Veterans Have Returned To College and Will Participate In Spring Try-outs. 
### 
Greater interest than has been man
ifested for some years in tennis is
expected this semester, especially if
the Intercollegiate Tennis Agreement
is amended so as to increase the
number of men on the opposing
teams.
It is planned to hold four singles
tournaments and possibly a doubles
tournament in order to select the
team. The four singles tournaments
will he played in succession. The first
three will be open to any member of
the University without entrance fees,
being Varsity tryouts. The winners
of these tourneys will play each other
in a fourth and the two players with
the best score will compose the
singles team.
All of the promising tennis men
have returned to college and are
eligible for the Varsity. This insures
as good a team as Stanford has had
during the past three years. Among
those who will play are: E. Jordan,
gr., T. C. Henry, '10. H. Mann, '10, H.
S. Morgan, '12, R. L. Murray, '13, and
W. M. Argabrite, '13.
