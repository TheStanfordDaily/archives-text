WILSON
>old Candies on the University Campus in a little
store where the Inn now stands.
Ever since then lie has been trying to make
better candies than any one else.
EXTRAVAGANCE in the use of fine materials
has been his hobby. It's an expensive hobby, but
it's a wonderful help in making good candies.
Try Wilson's delicious Cream Caramels next
time you're down town. They're a good example
of Wilson quality.
