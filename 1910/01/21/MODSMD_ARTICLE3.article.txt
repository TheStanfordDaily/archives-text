## CARDINALS MEET SANTA CLAIM CHAMPIONS TOMORROW. Varsity Will Be Changed Twice During the Course of Play.--Game Called at 3:00. 
### 
The Cardinal's first game to open
the baseball season this year is
against the very strong championship
Santa Clara College team, tomorrow
afternon at 3:00 o'clock, on the old
varsity diamond in case it does not
rain. Play will be transferred to the
supplementary diamond with wet
weather conditions prevailing. As
usual in the opening contest the line
up for the home team will suffer re
peated changes during the course of
play. Coach Presley intends to try
out three pitchers and as may catch
ers, with an entire new infield and
outfield, completely altering the list
given below. This team, which may
virtually be called the varsity, in
cludes men whose abilities are by no
means of an unknown quantity. In
the line-up are veterans, second-team
men, and strong class nine players of
last year. The only wholly new figure
is S. L. Mitchell, '13, who will handle
the receiving end of the battery.
The visiting nine is an unusually
formidable one this season, with al
most the whole make-up of last year's
winning organization. The mission
team's string of pitchers make a pow
erful combination with Carterfielu be
hind the plate. Agneu is the prize
twirler of the three on the list, and
should he be in the box tomorrow, it
is certain that the Cardinals will have
a sufficently stiff opportunity for
practice in batting.

er, M. Mitchell; first base, Ganong;
second base, McFadden; short-stop,
