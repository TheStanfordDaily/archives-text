# Communication from Professor Clark.

### 
Since a few students have assumed
that a calendar is now compulsory
and have recorded dates for social
events with me with that in mind, As
sistant Registrar McDowell, at my re
quest, has consented to keep a uni
versity calendar for the convenience
of those who may care to avail them
selves of its benefits.
Public events and entertainments
will be recorded and announced by
him, and the dates of social affairs
will be given to those who are seek
ing to avoid conflicts with their own
entertainments.
This arrangement is entered into in
this informal manner at this time that
its benefits may be realized this
semester. The recording of proposed
events will be entirely voluntary and
it is not intended in any way to fore
stall any better arrangement which
may be devised by the various student
and faculty committees interested, but
only to get something into working
order at once.
(Signed) A. B. CLARK.
