# SECURE SEATS MONDAY
## TICKETS FOR MINSTREL SHOW TO GO ON SALE. Beginning Monday Seats May Be Procured at Campus Bookstore and Stanford Pharmacy. 
### 
Next Monday morning at 8 o'clock
all seats for the Minstrel Show are io
go on sale. Although the scale of
prices will remain the same as on pre
vious occasions, one dollar, seventy
five and fifty cents, far less than the
usual number of seats will be held at
higher figures. Tickets may be se
cured throughout the week, begin
ning at the time above noted, at the
the University Bookstore on the
campus and at the Stanford Pharmacy
in Palo Alto. The Minstrel Show will
lie held in Assembly Hall under the
auspices of the Combined Musical
Clubs and is scheduled for the evening
of Friday, January 28.
There is no doubt that the preten
tiousness of the show and the ex
treme cleverness of the individual
performers will make the present
ministrel entertainment eclipse all of
its predecessors. There is an abun
dance of black-face talent now in col
lege, and under the able tutelage of G.
F. Morgan, the production can not
fail to be smooth and finished. Mor
gan has complete supervision and acts
in the capacity of general stage di
rector, a position which he has suc
cessfully filled in many previous ill
stances, notably with regard to the
1909 football show.
The different numbers of the olio
have been so arranged that there
will be little or no delay for the shift
ing of scenery, and consequently the
performance should conclude at an
early hour.
