# WILL TRY OUT TUESDAY
## CHANCES FOR STRONG CARNOT TEAM ARE EXCELLENT. Many Prominent and Experienced Debaters Will Contest for Places on Team. 
### 
The outlook for a successful team
in the Carnot debate this year is very
good. It. is seldom that so many ex
perienced and capable debaters have
signified their intention of going into
the try-out. All of the men have
either represented the University or
their classes on debating teams and at,
least one of them has represented the
University on an Intercollegiate and a
Carnot team.
The following men have signified
their intention of entering the try
outs: G. F. Morgan, '10; P. ,T. Batkin,
'10; R. .1. Miller, '11; F. H. Hilton, '11;
E. .1. Hopkins, '11: G. Holcomb, '11; E.
E. Tieher, '12; N. C. Wilson, '12; and
M. E. Grimes, '12.
Of these men Morgan has undoubted
ly had the most experience. Last
year he was on both the Intercollegi
ate and Carnot teams and the experi
ence that he gained should undoubted
ly make him a strong contestant for a
place in this year's contest. Morgan
is a member of Nestoria Literary so
ciety and is also a member of Phi
Alpha Tau.
Batkin will undoubtedly put up a
strong fight for a place on the team
and his experience as a of
last year's Intercollegiate team will
stand him in god stead. Batkin is also
a member of Phi Alpha Tau and
Euphronia Literay Socitey.
By winning the Bonnheim disserta
lio and the Berwick Peace Prize this
year R. J. Miller has placed himself as
one of the men to be watched in the
coming try-outs. Miller was also a
member of both his class teams. He
is a member of Nestoria and Phi Alpha
Tau.
F. H. Hilton is another likely con
tender for a place on the team. Hil
ton was a member of both his class
teamsa nd last year won the Nestoria
Sophomore Medal contest from a large
field. He is a member of Nestoria and
Phi Alpha Tail.
E. .T. Hopkins is one of the "dark
horses." In his Freshman year he did
not enter college in time to try-out
for the Freshman team, but made his
Sophomore class team. Since that
time he has steadily improved and was
one of the strong contenders for the
recent Bonnheim. He is a member of
Euphronia Literary Society.
G. Holcomb is another man who has
to be reckoned with. In this years
Berwick Peace contest he was a
strong speaker and clearly showed his
abitlity. Holcomb is a member of
Nestoria.
E. E. Tincher, of the Sophomore
class has had considerable debating
experience at the University. He was
alternate on his Freshman team and
was the winner of the Sophomore
Nestoria Medal for 100 ft. He was al
ternate on the Sophomore team. Tin
cher is a memer of Nestoria.
N. C. Wilson, has probably had more
debating experience than any other '12
man. He was a member of both his
class teams and was alternate on the
1910 Carnot team. Wilson. is a mem-
