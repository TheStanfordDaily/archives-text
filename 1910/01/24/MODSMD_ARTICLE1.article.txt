# AGREEMENT DISCUSSED
## INTERCOLLEGIATE COMMITTEES SUGGEST CHANGES. Many Plans for Revision of Existing Relations To Be Submitted To Executive Committee. 
### 
The Agreement Committees of Stan
ford and the University of California
met last Saturday evening at the Pal
ace Hotel in San Francisco and
thorougly discussed the agreement
now existing between the two univer
sities. Lack of time prevented the
completion of the work and so a final
meeting has been set for next Friday.
Both committees favov the plan of
beginning the baseball reason on the
last Saturday of March instead of on
the first Saturday of April as now
planned, and of scheduling the final
game of the series on some date pre
vious to that of the Intercollegiate
Trackmeet. The advantageous fea
tures of such a change are that the
unduly long season would be short
ened by one week and the final game
would not have to be played at a time
when final examinations are being
given at the University of California.
Such a change would, however, neces
sitate changing the date of the Fresh
man Meet from March 20 to March Ift.
The plan of holding the preliminary
trials of the field events in the morn
ings of the days of the trackmeets was
also favorably discussed, as (he adop
tion of such a scheme would mater
ially shorten of the contests
and would prevent them from being
interrupted by darkness as often hap
pens. In addition to this discussion
the committee members advocated the
restriction of the number of men en
tering an event to six and not seven as
under the present agreement, and the
exclusion of al. persons except the
captains of the tv.o teams from the
oval while race;? are being run on.
Basket-ball, as a possible intercol- ■
legiate sport, was brought up for dis
cussion. but was not considered fav
orably, as neither of the universities
show enough interest in it to warrant
its adoption.
These changes in the existing agree
ment which were favored by the com
mittees, will be brought up before the
Executive Committees of the two col
leges for rejection or ratification dur
ing the present week and, if adopted,
will be put into effect at once. What
ever further changes are brought
about at the meeting of the Agreement
Committee next Friday will be con
sidered next week.
