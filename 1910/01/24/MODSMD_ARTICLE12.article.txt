# DEFENDS LIBRARY SERVICE.
## Hopkins Refutes College Journalists Who Continue To Attack Current Conditions. 
### 
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Now that it lias become the custom
for the college journals to attack the
library service, it ought to be known
to the students exactly where the
fault in that service lies. It is no ex
aggregation to state lha seven-eighths
of the confusion at the loan desk is
caused directly by the students them
selves. The way in which the library
is abused by those who use it would
he incredible to me if I had not seen
it for myself. The only way to im
prove the service is to improve the
students so thai they will be accom
modating instead of abusive in their
general attitude.
in the first place, no assistant can
find a book unless be is told what that
book is,—author, title, and usually
number. Not one card in five that is
passed over the loan desk has the
number on it. Frequently, of course,
the assistant can locate the book even
without the number; but he has to
hunt for it, and hunting takes time and
occasions delay. There are over 127,-
000 volumes in the library, and to look
for one book, unguided by the number,
is a doubtful and difficult task.
But even the title of the book is very
often entirely wrong on the cards
made out by the student. White's
"Making of the English Constitution"
is likely to be called anything from
"The Making of History" to "The
Making of Laws." Mitchell's "History
of tlie Greenbacks" is variously known
as the "History of the Gold Standard,"
the "History of Paper Money and the
Gold Standard in U. 5..," or simply
"Money." When a title like that is
passed over to the assistant, he doesn - '
know but what Mitchell may have
written a dozen books. This occasions
delay.
Or the title is perhaps omitted alto
gether. Last Saturday a student hand
ed me three cards containing the
single words "Defoe," "Luther," and
"Gibbon." Each of these men has
written a shelf of volumes. This
thing happens dozens of times every
day, and causes delay.
The frequency of these inconsider
ate errors on the part of the users of
the library will be realized when 1
state that about one card in twenty
that is passed over the loan desk is
correctly filled out. The other nine
teen are lacking in some essential—
number, author, title, volume or even
signature—and must be filled in,
where possible by the assistant. This
occasions delay.
Rut the greatest abuse of all, far
harder to remedy than t lie one just
discussed, is the stealing of books.
Not, a night goes by without finding a
bunch of small cards, "For Library
Use Only." left undischarged because
the books have been taken home. The
average for the past nine days was 17
books a day thus abstracted. The
library has not cared to pursue a
rigorous policy of fining or depriving
of privileges, so the abuse goes on
unchecked. The books taken and kept
out on small cards are usually refer
ences in constant demand. They are
often held out for days, if not sent
for. Time and again I have had to go
to the Hall or to some house on the
Row to recover some much-needed
reference, when my assistance was
needed at the loan desk. Last week
two books were thus recovered from
the room of a man that, had flunked
out. Before vacation a certain fra

ternitv was confronted with a large
bill, payment, being demanded for
books lost by its members. In order
to cut down the cost, one of the men
made the rounds of his house, looking
for library books. He found fourteen,
lying around in disuse, through sheer
j neglect. When students had called for
iliese books at the loan desk, they had
been fold, "This book is out," and had
accordingly cursed the service.
These, and the keeping of hour
books over time, are the most con
stant abuses. They all cause delay.
The library is easily disorganized, but
a little common-sense and considera
tion by those who use its privileges is
tlie only way to help matters. This
being furnished, if the service does not
improve, the journals will then have
cause to criticize.
