# ALMOST TWO HUNDRED SIGN UP
## Track Rally Brings Out Splendid Material for 1910 Season. — Noisy Enthusiasm Rules Gathering Friday Night. 
### 
"We have enough first-place men to
will the meet. What we need is second
and third-place men to bring up the
score." CAPTAIN SCOTT.
The track season of 1910 was usher
ed in by an enthusiastic crowd at the
annual rally in Encina last Friday
night. Cheer after cheer greeted each
speaker and after the termination of
the addresses of 195 men signed up for
training, this list not including the
names of several prominent trackmen
who will begin work soon.
Captain Scott opened the program
with an appeal for more men to come
out for track, stating that this year
training rules would be less rigorous
than ever before.
Instead of going into strict training
in the middle of the season as in the
past, light training will be in effect
until approximately three weeks prior
to the Intercollegiate meet. Up to
that, time there will be no restrictions
on the men attending dances, with the
exception that every man who does so
must report either to Captain Scott or
"Dad" Moulton.
As to the Freshman meet Captain
Scott stated that all the 191H men
were wanted on the track, and a win
ning team could be developed if there
was a sufficient number of men with
which to work.
Doctor Angell indulged in some
reminisences of the old days when the
track was the only place where more
than thirty men were wanted on the
squad, and as an instance of how per
severance wins out quoted the of
two men here some years ago. These
men after training four successive
seasons finally came through, one win
ning the mile, the other the two-mile
run.
The importance of second and third
places in winning a meet was shown
by A. E. Roth, Student Adviser, in an
address in which, by quoting tho
scores of past contests, he showed
where, in many instances, meets have
been won or lost by a margin of two
or three points.
"Discrimination by the coaches, on
the track," the speaker said, "was an
unknown thing, as it was up to every
man individually to show what he
could do. As a matter of fact the
coach can not see everyone personal
ly, owing to the size of the squad, so a
new man should not feel discouraged
by seeming inattention. All of the
older men will only be too willing to
assist the new candidates if they will
ask them.
In closing. Roth stated that in order
to make the preent track season a
success it was necessary to stop
"knocking" and that everyone get to
gether and "boost."
That every man was needed for a
strong team was the statement of
"Dad" Moulton, the last speaker, who
in a short, earnest talk, requested
everyone to sign up. He said: "There
is a chance for 112 men to compete in
a. track meet, an opportunity which
presents itself in no other sport.
The customary light training rules
are now in effect and every man who

signed up is expected to do some work
each day. If classes interfere with
any person coming out at the usual
|hours, then L will make special ar
rangements to suit the individual."
Instead of the sprinters running the
risk of breaking down by training on
the track, ihe turf will be rolled and
preliminary work done there.
An unexpected addition to the track
squad was made known at the rally
when Caesar Moulton was introduced
by "Dad" as a future holder of world's
records.
