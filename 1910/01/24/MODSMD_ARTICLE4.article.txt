# SEASON NOT OPENED
## SANTA CLARA TEAM UNABLE TO PLAY ON SATURDAY. If Weather Permits, First Game Will Be Against Ireland's Independents Wednesday. 
### 
The Santa Clara baseball nine was
unable to make satisfactory train con
nections from the college town to the
campus, and as a result the Stanford
team was unable to open its season on
the diamond last Saturday. This
same will be dropped entirely from
the schedule, since a date missed can
not be made up in any way. Manager
' Burbank, however, will endeavor to
j have the full twenty-six games played,
by substituting other teams for those
whose dates have been cancelled.
With anywhere near favorable weather
next Wednesday, Coach Presley will
get a nine organized to meet the Ire
land's Independents from San Fran
cisco. This game should be an inter
esting one from the standpoint of the
bleachers, since the visiting organiza
tion is composed of star base-ballists
from all over the country, wintering
in or near San Francisco.
There will also be several Stanford
and California veterans in the line-up,
and Ireland, the captain, is the able
; leader of the aggregation.
A squad of about two dozen men had
j been called out by Coach Presley last
Saturday for the Santa Clara game.
News being received of the impossibil
ity of playing ihe contest, the men
were given a very short base-running
practice, after which work was called
| off for the day.
The men who composed the squad
were:
Catchers.—S. Mitchell, Cochran,
ißeecher; pitchers.—M. Mitchell, Kel
| ley, Van Dyke. Gilfillan: first-base.—
| Ganong, Ball: second-base. —McFad-
deu. Levy; short-stop. — Tallant,
