# WHO IS FRESHMAN SECRETARY?
## No one Can Assist the Class of 1913 In Answering The Difficult Question. 
### 
Although the class of 1913 completed
its election at, today's meeting, but
one name being mentioned for each
office, yet through ? curious circum
stance. the identity or numercial
quantity of the holder or holders of
the office of secretary is an enigma
impossible of solution. The member
who nominated another member for
that office was so careless as to desig
nate that second member merely as
"Miss Long." There being three
Freshman to whom the appellation is
applicable, the present quandary has
resulted. The other new officers are:
W. A. Simpson, president; E. P. Illy,
vice-president: C. H. Beal, treasurer:
A. P. Hill, sergeant-at-arms.
The executive committee is now
composed of TT. Thoburn, H. C. Boyd,
and Miss J. I. Lakin. K. E. Leib, C. H.
Marvin and A. P. Hill were appointed
a committee to secure pins for the de
bating team.
