"After weighing and comparing the
available evidence, the 'Chaparral' is
forced to decide" that certain charges
"recently made had no adequate foun
dation in fact." In finding any evi
dence to weigh and compare, ihe
"Chaparral" has met with far more
success than has crowned the re
searches of the Daily Palo Alto. "Hon
est beliefs" we have collected in abun
dance; "unbiased points of view" and
"impartial comments" have surround
ed us on every side; the "best judg
ment" of various persons has received
public hearing; but as for real evi
dence, we are still waiting. Mr.
Theile's statement, the only evidence
worthy of the name, referred to but a
single incident of an entire campaign.
Evidence is a reason for knowledge
or a fact upon which a judgment is
based. Reasons for absolute knowl
edge we have none; irrefutable facts
for a sound belief we have few—far
too few to justify the formation or ex
pression of an opinion as to the mer
its of the case. Evidence, real evi
dence, and sufficient of it, has not as
yet been adduced. An editor promi
nent in tlie argument has promised to
submit his case in the near future.
The continued silence of a certain or
ganization, also prominent in one
phase of the argument, will soon bring
us to the opinion that that organiza
tion is willing, without further state
ments on its part, to allow the public
to decide the controversy.
Meanwhile, the Daily Palo Alto is
earnestly endeavoring, and we trust
successfully, to view the situation fair
ly and conservatively, expressing no
belief one way or another until the
actual facts before us patently justify
the existence of a positive belief.
