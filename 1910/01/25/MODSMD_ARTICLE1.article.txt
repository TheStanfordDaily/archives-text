# WILL PLAY TOMORROW
## IRELAND'S INDEPENDENTS TO MEET VARSITY NINE. Aggregation of Stars of National Reputation Compose Visiting Team. 
### 
In case the Varsity nine does not
again meet hard luck in the shape of
rain tomorrow it will encounter Ire
land's Independents at 4:15 in the
supplementary diamond, for the open
ing contest of the year. The visiting
aggregation is an interesting one from
all points of view.
The team, with headquarters in San
Francisco, numbers among its line-up
players of national reputation. These
include members of leagues from all
over the country and state. One of the
best drawing cards on the list is ".Toe"
Nealon, acknowledged for some time to
he second only to "Hal" Chase of Phil
adelphia as a first baseman. Nealon is
an old Pittsburg player of the National
League, having been a member of that
team for two years. He was also an
initial sack man for the Sacramento
nine of the State League. "Dick"
Egan. a former Triangle League star,
is another of the picturesque names on
the score card. P. C. Ireland, the
promoter of the organization, takes his
place in one of the garden positions,
and will be an able captain of the
whole. Behind the bat will be seen .T.
Byinjs. nlso of the Sacrament team
of the State League, and a member of
the 1907 Philadelphia nine. To handle
the delivery the bleachers will see
"Doc" Moskimon, of the Oakland State
and the Louisville Southern Leagues.
Second base will be taken care of by
"Al" Webber, a very strong all-around
player, of the Monogram team of Port
land and other organizations. Spen
cer of the Coast League is slated to
hold down third base. The three gar
den places on the line up are divided
between "Heine" Heitmuller. Stanford.
'07. left, Swayne, of the Northwestern
League, at center, and Ireland at right.
This game, besides being a pictur
esque one, will be a decidedly difficult
one for the Cardinals. Ireland's men
display all that is essential to a strict
ly professional team. Last year the
Stanford Varsity, with practically a
veteran line-up, was defeated 5-4. in a
contest marked by distinctly good ball
playing.
Captain Ireland will probably bring
down Perrine. a powerful box artist,
who. however, is out of the team tem
porarily on account of an injury. It is
possible that he will do the umpiring.
Admission to the field has been set
at 25 cents.
The line-ups are:
Varsity—Catcher. S. L. Mitchell;
pither. M. M. Mitchell; first base. Gan
ong: second base. McFadden; short
stop, Tallant; third base, Soper: left
field, Jordan: center field. McGregor;

"Al" Webber, a very strong all-around
player, of the Monogram team of Port
land and other organizations. Spen
cer of the Coast League is slated to
hold down third base. The three gar
den places on the line up are divided
between "Heine" Heitmuller. Stanford.
'07. left, Swayne, of the Northwestern
League, at center, and Ireland at right.
This game, besides being a pictur
esque one, will be a decidedly difficult
one for the Cardinals. Ireland's men
display all that is essential to a strict
ly professional team. Last year the
Stanford Varsity, with practically a
veteran line-up, was defeated 5-4. in a
contest marked by distinctly good ball
playing.
Captain Ireland will probably bring
down Perrine. a powerful box artist,
who. however, is out of the team tem
porarily on account of an injury. It is
possible that he will do the umpiring.
Admission to the field has been set
at 25 cents.
The line-ups are:
Varsity—Catcher. S. L. Mitchell;
pither. M. M. Mitchell; first base. Gan
ong: second base. McFadden; short
stop, Tallant; third base, Soper: left
field, Jordan: center field. McGregor;
ritrht field. O'liear.
Ireland's Independents — Catcher.
Byrnes: pitcher. Moskimon: first base.
Nealon: second base. Webber; short
stop. Eagen; third base, Spencer: left
field, Heitmuller: center field, Swayne;
right field, Ireland.
