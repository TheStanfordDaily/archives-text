Every cent of the net profits of the
minstrel show is to be turned over
either to the track team for its eastern
trip or to the Stanford Union. Ac
cordingly. every person who purchases
a ticket to the show is aiding one of
two worthy enterprises. Thus far the
seat sale has been somewhat below the
average, but with the announcement of
the praiseworthy purposes to which
the proceeds are to be devoted, we
trust lbat the disposition of tickets
may continue with more rapidity. The
audience will not only get its money's
worth, but it will be giving material
assistance to a good cause.
