### 
In a paper entitled "The Problem
of the Assistant Professor," by Pro
fessor Guide Marx, of the Mechanical
Engineering department, delivered
recently before the Association of
American Universities, is contained
some interesting statements. Eighty
per cent of the assistant professors in
American universities must supple
ment. their salaries by outside work in
order to "make both ends meet" and,
he says they receive, on an avern
just enough to suffice for a*i unmar
ried man, and seventy-four per cent
of them are married and have families
to support.
