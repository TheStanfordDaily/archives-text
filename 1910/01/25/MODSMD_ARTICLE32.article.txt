## 
### 
The three new tennis courts which
are being constructed below the pres
ent tennis courts, will be completed
in the near future and if finished in
time will greatly faciliate the progress
of the try-outs for the Varsity Tennis
Team.
The courts will be constructed on
a slight angle, making them as nearly
self draining as possible. The ground
for these courts was filled over a year
ago, so little trouble is anticipated
from further settling. Prof. Wing, of
the Civil Engineering Department has
charge of the work, which insures
first-class work in every detail.
