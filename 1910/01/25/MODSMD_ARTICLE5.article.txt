Forty-one members of the Lagunita
Rowing Club signed up for crew prac
tice yesterday afternoon at the boat
house. Twelve of this number are
freshmen. The list of oarsmen, who
will train this season is by no means
complete as many who have signified
their intention of rowing have not as
yet signed up for work. Freshmen
particularly are urged to come out.
Many more are needed in order that a
strong first-year crew may be devel
oped.
