Special arrangements have been
made by Stage Director Morgan to se
cure unique and attractive lighting
and scenic effects in the coming show.
In addition to the ordinary electrical
devices a calcium spot-light will be
made use of in many of the songs and
stunts and some very new and pleasing
effects will be produced in this way.
The costumes are, for the most part,
entirely different than are usually seen
in minstrel shows and were especially
designed for this occasion.
Several changes have been made in
the program as last announced. The
most prominent of these changes is
the addition to the Olio of a blackface
turn that will be put on by D. B.
Stuart, '12 and P. J. Forrest, '13. The
feature of this act will be a number of
clever parodies on local conditions
which the two will sing.
Several new songs have been added
to the program while a few have been
dropped. The songs are almost with
out exception late eastern hits which
will be heard here for the first time.
The complete list of songs for the
show is as follows: "Keep Your Foot
on the Soft, Soft el'dal," "Why Don't
You," "When the Bell in the Light
house Rings," Alexander Jones,"
"Night and Day," "How Do You Do,
Miss Josephine," "By the Light of the
Silvery Moon," "The Love Bug," "The
Belle of the Barber's Ball," "Fooling,"
"A Monkey Honeymoon," "Good Luck,
Mary," "Under the Orange Blossom
Tree," "Moontime."
Unique and attractive posters have
been placed about the Quad to adver
tise the show. These posters which
were designed by E. M. Albright, '12,
are different from any that have ever
been used here and display to good ad
vantage the pictures of the leading
minstrels.
Tickets are still on sale in Palo Alto
and at the Bookstore and many desir
able seats may still be secured at these
two places.
