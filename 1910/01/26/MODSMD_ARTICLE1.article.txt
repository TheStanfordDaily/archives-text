# PLEDGING REGULATED
## FRATERNITIES MAKE PLANS CONCERNING PREPS. Organizations Agree To Eliminate Spiking of Men During Time of Interscholatsic Track Meet. 
### 
No more pledging by the fraternities
during the visit of prep, school ath
letes to the campus at the time of the
Interscholastic Meet, was the decision
reached this afternoon in a joint meet
ing between the Board of Governors
of the Intel-scholastic Association and
representatives of the different fra
ternities. Quite a number of com
plaints have been received from pre
paratory schools by the officials of the
association concerning this feature of
the annual meet and several schools
have signified their intention of with
holding the entry of teams until the
objection is obviated.
It seems as if the authorities of the
preparatory schools complain of a
falling off in the scholastic standing
of athletes who have participated in
the Intel-scholastic events and claim
that this deficiency is especially no
ticeable in those who have become
pledged to some fraternity during
their stay upon the campus. As a
consequence of these complaints, the
Hoard of Intel-scholastic governors
called the meeting which was held
this afternoon, in the hope of making
some amicable arrangement with the
fraternities.
The matter under consideration was
easily adjusted at the meeting, all of
the fraternities concurring in the
scheme to remove the objection of the
preparatory schools in this detail.
The Board of Governors is now con
sidering the names of men who are
eligible to till several vacancies that
have occurred in the controlling body
of the organization and the Board
promises to make known the nominees
in a few days.
