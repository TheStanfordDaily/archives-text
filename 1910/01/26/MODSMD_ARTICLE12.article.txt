The forty-one men who began the
crew season yesterday afternoon need
and deserve all the support which can
and will he accorded them. They are
working in ihe face of difficulties
which seldom beset men who under
take to compete in some branch of
college athletics. The abandonment
of boating as an intercollegiate sport
has thrown the rowing enthusiasts
upon their own resources, and still
their energy and courage seem such
as to insure success. Although it is
impossible for the student body, col
lectively, to furnish financial assis
tance, it is not at all impossible for
every member of the student body,
individually, to be enthusiastic in his
support. Men who are unselfish
enough to seek to perpetuate rowing in
the face of the present discouraging
prospects and hardships should be
aided and commended from start to
finish.
