To allow individual organizations
to interfere in any manner whatsoever
with so desirable an institution as the
interscholastic meet would be an in
excusable error, and consequently the
Daily Palo Alto rejoices in the aboli
tion of a practice which, in its very
nature, is contrary to the best inter
ests of the interscholastic, and would
in time, have caused its death. The
opportunities offered were too attrac
tive to be resisted by the fraternities
save by a collective movement, similar
to that which has just been begun.
To render the new agreement effective,
however, it is imperate that every
fraternity obey in detail the spirit, as
well as the letter, of the pact. Each
party to the agreement must bear this
vital fact firmly in mind.
