# College Resolutions.
## 
### 
Resolutions to do better work in the
class rooms are keptâ€”sometimes.
Another good resolution is to buy a
box of Geo. Haas & Sons' delicious
candies when in San Francisco.
Four stores: Phelan Building, Fill
more at Ellis, Van Ness at Sutter and
28 Market St. (near Ferry.)
