# COLLEGES ENTER AVIATION.
## Aero Club of the University of Pennsylvania Challenges College Aeronauts to Fly in Meet. 
### 
The aeroplane, "Pennsylvania I" is
being built by several graduates of the
University of Pennsylvania under the
direction of L. J. Lesh, an expert on
heavier than air flying machines. The
aeroplane when completed will be
turned over to the Areo Club of that
university.
The craft is of bi-plane design, being
forty-five feet over-all, and several
new ideas are featured in its design.
It will be driven by twin screws and
will be a chainless machine, thus be
ing the only model of this type of
aeroplane in existence.
As soon as the "Pennsylvania I" is
completed, which the club hopes will
be in less than a month, and has been
successfully "tried-out" the Aero Club
will endeavor to form an "Air League"
with other colleges having aeronautic
organizations.
The Aero Club now challenges to
meet in a matched contest any air boat,
air craft, or dirigible of any descrip
tion owned and operated by an aero
nautic organization of any other col
lege in the United States.
