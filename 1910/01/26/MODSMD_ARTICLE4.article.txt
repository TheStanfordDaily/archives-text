# 1910 CARNOT TEAM IS CHOSEN
## Morgan, Miller and Batkin Will Represent Stanford in Coming Intercollegiate Debating Contest.—Hopkins is Alternate. 
### 
When the University of California
and Stanford University meet 111 the
sixteenth annual Carnot Debate in
Harmon Gymnasium on the evening of
February 2, the trio which will uphold
the Cardinal in this important forensic
contest will be composed of Geoffrey
Francis Morgan, '10, of Los Angeles,
Paul Jay Batkin, '10, of Riverside,
and R. Justin Miller, '11, of Hanford,
with Ernest Jerome Hopkins, '11, of
San Jose, as alternate.
This is the team as it was selected
by the judges as a result of the try-out
in the University Chapel last evening
which nine able speakers and debaters
contested in as evenly matched and
logically interesting a try-out as has
ever been held in the Chapel. The
judges, who were Professors F. C.
Woodward and C. A. Huston, of the
Law School, and R. M. Alden, of the
Department of English, were in con
ference some time before reaching
their decision.
The specific question for debate as
selected by Professor A. L. Guerard,
of the Department of Romanic Lan
guages, and Professor E. B. Krehbiel,
of the History Department, two hours
before the debate was: "Resolved —
That the election of the President of
the French Republic by Congress is
preferable to election by the people."
Of the nine speakers, four took the
affirmative and five the negative.
Morgan, Miller, Batkin, and Hopkins
all spoke on the latter side of the
question, as did F. H. Hilton. '11. who
presented an unusually strong argu
ment. The affirmative speakers were
N. C. Wilson, '12, G. Holcomb, '11, M.
E. Grimes, '12. and E. E. Tincher, '12.
who delivered excellent debates and
spoke in the order named. Of the
affirmative, the work of N. C. Wilson.
'12 is worthy of special mention, as is
that of Hilton's 011 the negative.
The main contentions of the affirma
tive speakers were: that in electing a
president themselves, the French peo
ple would be setting up a dictator,
that owing to the naturally irrational
and volatile character of the people.
;i popularly controlled government
would plunge itself into war with
Germany, that an efficient system of
local self-government is more desir

able than national self-government,
that the popular election of the presi
dent would develop the spoils system,
that the present system of government
has proven more worthy and substan
tial than any other, and finally, that
in reality, nothing of material ad
vancement would result from univer
sal suffrage in the presidental election.
The negative speakers, as a whole,
marshalled the following main argu
ments: the popular election will unite
the two great tendencies in the French
government, of centralization in the
national government and universal
suffrage, that the present legislative
dominance is much worse than any
possible presidential dictatorship, that
the participation in the elections by all
the people would unite the several
petty parties, thereby developing a
strong, healthy, party-controlled gov
ernment, that a people's president not
only would maintain the stability of
the nation, but would stand for the
great, national issue and direct the
general tendencies as he should, and
that popular elections would once
more interest and enthuse the people
111 national affairs and make their
public officials directly responsible
and amenable to their constituency.
The team as selected by the judges
is probably as experienced a one as
could have been picked. Morgan was
a member of both the 1909 Carnot and
Intercollegiate Debating teams. Hat
kin debated with Morgan 011 the In
tercollegiate team, while Miller has
established a splendid reputation as
a member of his Sophomore team and
as winner of both the Bonnheim Dis
cussion and the Edward Berwick, Jr.
Peace Prize.
All three men are prominent in
local debating societies, Batkin being
the retiring president of Euphronia,
and Morgan, the newly elected presi
dent of Nestoria. Miller is also a
Nestoria man, and with his two team
mates is Phi Alpha Tail. The three
are members of Encina Club, Miller
and Batkin are Delta Chi. Morgan and
Miller are members of the "Sequoia"
staff, and Morgan, besides being prom
inent in dramatics, is editor of the
"Chaparrall" and a member of the
1 Press Club.
