# "QUAD" EXTENDS TIME
## STORY AND ART PRIZES TO BE AWARDED MARCH 1. Ten Dollars Offered For Best Fiction and Photographic Prize For Art Work. 
### 
As the offer of the 1911 "Quad" of
pirzes for the best short story sub
mitted and the best design drawn for
the decoration of the Junior Class
photographs, has as yet met with in
sufficient response, Editor L. L. Hill
has extended the time during which
stories and designs may be submitted
to March 1. If, at that time, copy is
not submitted from which available
matter may be selected, it will be im
possible to recognize the literary in
terests in the student body in the
.Junior annual and the art design for
the photographs will have to be se
cured from outside sources.
A prize of $10 is offered for the best
short story submitted. The only con
ditions of the contest are that the
stories must not be over 3500 words in
length, and must be typewritten on
but one side of the copy paper. The
stories may be left with Mrs. T. P.
Russell of the English Department or
mailed to Box 1174 campus. A faculty
committee will pass upon the stories
and award the prize.
By way of improving the appearance
of the class photographs, the "Quad"
Board has decided to place but twelve
photographs on a page instead of
sixteen as has been the custom in the
past, and to surround the pictures with
a simple yet pleasing design. It has
been thought best to have the pictures
cut oval shape, so the artists in draw
ing their design must leave open
spaces for twelve ovals each 5% inches
high and 4 inches wide. The full
page design, as a whole should be
drawn 26 inches high and 16 inches
wide on six ply board. The designs
around all the pictures should be as
nearly uniform as possible and carry
an atmosphere of simplicity and ele
gance. Florid and elaborate designs
are not desired. The openings for the
pictures must not be cut out, but sim
ply outlined by the artists.
The winner of the art prize will
be announced in the"Daily Palo Alto"
as soon after March 1 as possible. The
prize takes the shape of a dozen of
i Davey's best photographs. The de
signs must be submitted to Professor
Harshe of the Art Department. Pupils
in the Art Department will be allowed
to work on designs.
