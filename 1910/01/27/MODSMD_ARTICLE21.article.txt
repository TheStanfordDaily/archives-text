Plans for the various class activi
ties that are to be pursued by the
Juniors during the present semester
were discussed and, in part, acted
upon by that class at a meeting that
was held this afternoon. The object
of the early consideration of Junior
week was to allow the various com
mittees that will be in charge of the
activities at that time to make com
plete arrangements at an early date.

meeting was the decision of the class
to authorize the expenditure of $75
for a manuscript suitable for a Junior
Opera, to be used either as a prize for
a student's manuscript, or as a royalty
upon a professional play should the
committe decide to adopt some out
side work. The committee however,
has the power to select either a man
uscript by a student or to go into the
professional field for an opera.
