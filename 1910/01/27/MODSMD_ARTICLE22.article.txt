# CHANGE IN SCHEDULE
## BASEBALL TRIPS TABOOED UNTIL SEASON MATURES. Varsity May Be Able to Play St. Mary's on Saturday if Weather Is Good. 
### 
Owing to the small amount of prac
tice that the varsity nine has had,
none at all against an opposing team,
Manager Burbank will try to put off
for a while any off-the-campus trips of
the local ball players. As has been
the custom in the compiling of former
schedules such a contest is usually on
the card for the first week in Febru
ary, this year's date being set for next
Wednesday with Santa Clara on the
mission town diamond. A journey to
a match away from home at this time
of the year, with the season still bare
of any scores, would compel the tak
ing of a squad extremely unwieldy
in view of numbers, and would be
decidedly impracticable. Coach Pres
ley will again try for the opening of
the schedule, which has been tightly
closed twice consecutively, with a
crossing of bats next Saturday after
noon against the St. Mary's College
men of Oakland. The match with the
Ireland's Independents, which was
lost last Wednedsay because of a sea
of mud on the diamond, is to be made
up in some way, so that the three
games originally dated with this popu
lar aggregation may still be played.
California has not yet begun the
serious work on their list of dates.
The first game scheduled is with the
"All-Star" varsity veterans, of which
(\ E. Sampson, '07, is captain. Feb
ruary 5 is the time laid down for this
match.
