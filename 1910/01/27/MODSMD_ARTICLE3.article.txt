# STANFORD MINSTRELS WILL OPEN DRAMATIC SEASON
## Combined Musical Clubs Will Present Elaborate Entertainment In Assembly Hall Tomorrow Evening. 
### 
Originality will be the keynote of
the Minstrel Show which will be given
by the Combined Musical Clubs in As
sembly Hall tomorrow evening.
Neither expense nor ingenuity has
been spared in the endeavor to make
this the most elaborate and entertain
ing affair of its kind ever produced at J
Stanford. New and attractive cos- 1
tumes. unique and beautiful lighting
and scenic effects, witty and humor
ous jests, catchy song hits, novel and
original stunts and turns—all these
will tend to raise the performance far
above the level of the ordinary stereo
typed minstrel entertainment. In the
production of the show the Musical
C'lnbs have placed the stage direction
in the hands of G. F. Morgan, '10, and 1
have had the benefit of his varied ex- j
perience in the production of shows i
of this type.
| The arrangement of the minstrels
on the stage will be as different as'
possible from that usually seen. In
the first row nineteen men will appear, j
nine singers being seated on each side I
of the interlocutor. Three end men 1
will be placed on each wing and next ;
to them will be the members of the |
black quartet. Next in line and |
flanking the interlocutor there will be j
a double quartet. The cosuimes fo
these three divisions will be entirely
different, the double quartet appear
ing in attractive white sailor suits
while the others will wear the typical
bright-lined minstrel garb. The
chorus of twelve men will take their
places in the second row and will J
wear an attractive costume especially j
designed for this occasion.
I This arrangement of the minstrels '
will prevail throughout the first part
of the show during which time op
portunity will be afforded for mono
logues, jests and the singing of the |
many clever song hits that have ueen j
prepared. The Olio which will foilow |
a short intermission, will consist of
five new and clever vaudeville acts.
These acts have been so arranged that
they may be put on without causing
Ihe tiresome delays which are occa
sioned in the changing of the stage
setting, every effort having been made
to introduce life and "snap" into the
show at every point.
The University Orchestra has se
cured new music to be rendered dur
ing the intermission and as overtures
and exit march. The accompani
ments to the songs will be played by
P. D. Fawcett, '12.
The complete program as it will

will pive a "Chalk Talk"' as ihe second
number has already demonstrated his
cleverness along this line to Stanford

its turn, including several selections
that are new to the Coast. P. P.
Ward, '12, will appear in black face
monologue and will also sing some
new "Coon" songs. The musical stunt

The curtain will rise on the perfor

Originality will be the keynote of
the Minstrel Show which will be given
by the Combined Musical Clubs in As
sembly Hall tomorrow evening.
Neither expense nor ingenuity has
been spared in the endeavor to make
this the most elaborate and entertain
ing affair of its kind ever produced at J
Stanford. New and attractive cos- 1
tumes. unique and beautiful lighting
and scenic effects, witty and humor
ous jests, catchy song hits, novel and
original stunts and turns—all these
will tend to raise the performance far
above the level of the ordinary stereo
typed minstrel entertainment. In the
production of the show the Musical
C'lnbs have placed the stage direction
in the hands of G. F. Morgan, '10, and 1
have had the benefit of his varied ex- j
perience in the production of shows i
of this type.
| The arrangement of the minstrels
on the stage will be as different as'
possible from that usually seen. In
the first row nineteen men will appear, j
nine singers being seated on each side I
of the interlocutor. Three end men 1
will be placed on each wing and next ;
to them will be the members of the |
black quartet. Next in line and |
flanking the interlocutor there will be j
a double quartet. The cosuimes fo
these three divisions will be entirely
different, the double quartet appear
ing in attractive white sailor suits
while the others will wear the typical
bright-lined minstrel garb. The
chorus of twelve men will take their
places in the second row and will J
wear an attractive costume especially j
designed for this occasion.
I This arrangement of the minstrels '
will prevail throughout the first part
of the show during which time op
portunity will be afforded for mono
logues, jests and the singing of the |
many clever song hits that have ueen j
prepared. The Olio which will foilow |
a short intermission, will consist of
five new and clever vaudeville acts.
These acts have been so arranged that
they may be put on without causing
Ihe tiresome delays which are occa
sioned in the changing of the stage
setting, every effort having been made
to introduce life and "snap" into the
show at every point.
The University Orchestra has se
cured new music to be rendered dur
ing the intermission and as overtures
and exit march. The accompani
ments to the songs will be played by
P. D. Fawcett, '12.
The complete program as it will

these three divisions will be entirely
different, the double quartet appear
ing in attractive white sailor suits
while the others will wear the typical
bright-lined minstrel garb. The
chorus of twelve men will take their
places in the second row and will J
wear an attractive costume especially j
designed for this occasion.
I This arrangement of the minstrels '
will prevail throughout the first part
of the show during which time op
portunity will be afforded for mono
logues, jests and the singing of the |
many clever song hits that have ueen j
prepared. The Olio which will foilow |
a short intermission, will consist of
five new and clever vaudeville acts.
These acts have been so arranged that
they may be put on without causing
Ihe tiresome delays which are occa
sioned in the changing of the stage
setting, every effort having been made
to introduce life and "snap" into the
show at every point.
The University Orchestra has se
cured new music to be rendered dur
ing the intermission and as overtures
and exit march. The accompani
ments to the songs will be played by
P. D. Fawcett, '12.

Originality will be the keynote of
the Minstrel Show which will be given
by the Combined Musical Clubs in As
sembly Hall tomorrow evening.
Neither expense nor ingenuity has
been spared in the endeavor to make
this the most elaborate and entertain
ing affair of its kind ever produced at J
Stanford. New and attractive cos- 1
tumes. unique and beautiful lighting
and scenic effects, witty and humor
ous jests, catchy song hits, novel and
original stunts and turns—all these
will tend to raise the performance far
above the level of the ordinary stereo
typed minstrel entertainment. In the
production of the show the Musical
C'lnbs have placed the stage direction
in the hands of G. F. Morgan, '10, and 1
have had the benefit of his varied ex- j
perience in the production of shows i
of this type.
| The arrangement of the minstrels
on the stage will be as different as'
possible from that usually seen. In
the first row nineteen men will appear, j
nine singers being seated on each side I
of the interlocutor. Three end men 1
will be placed on each wing and next ;
to them will be the members of the |
black quartet. Next in line and |
flanking the interlocutor there will be j
a double quartet. The cosuimes fo
these three divisions will be entirely
different, the double quartet appear
ing in attractive white sailor suits
while the others will wear the typical
bright-lined minstrel garb. The
chorus of twelve men will take their
places in the second row and will J
wear an attractive costume especially j
designed for this occasion.
