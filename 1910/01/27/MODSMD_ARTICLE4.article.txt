### 
The arrangement for the holding of
conferences with representatives of
the University of California concern
ing agreements and the adoption of a
design for the track trophy to be pre
sented to last year's team consumed
most of the time of the executive com
mittee at the meeting last evening.
A commission consisting of P. J.
Hatkin, '10, G. P. Morgan, '10, and J.
E. Shell on, 'id, all prominent, debaters,
was named to take charge of the re
arrangement of the debating agree
ment. A meeting between the dele
gates of the two universities will prob
ably be held on February 13, the day
after the Carnot at California. When
an agreement has been reached be
tween the committees it will be re
ported back to the executive com
mittee for final action as is usual.
A design for the trophies which are
to be presented to members of the
1909 Track team submitted by H. V.
Poor, '10, was accepted. The trophies
are in the shape of small bronze medal
lions having a symbolic figure of a
Grecian athlete on one side, sur
mounted by the words "Stanford Uni
versity" in Roman letters, while below
is the inscription, "Intercollegiate
Track Team." On the reverse will be
the name and class of the man to
whom the medallion is presented.
It was also decided to have a pic
ture of the members of the University
Conference, as a representative stu
dent organization, taken for the 1911
Quad. Following out the custom of
sending copies of the Daily Palo Alto
to preparatory schools throughout the
Coast, Manager Burbank was instruct
ed to make the expenditure for this
purpose.
President Shelton has announced
the appointment of H. Mann, '10, and
E. Jordan, gr. as delegates to meet
the California representatives, con
cerning the changes in the tennis
agreement of the two universities as
authorized at the last meeting of the
executive committee. Shelton also has
filled the vacancy in the position of
chairman of the Stanford â€¢ Union,
caused by the resignation of H. R.
