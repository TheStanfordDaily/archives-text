The practicing of politics in student
affairs, we suppose, a necessary evil.
Yet we regret that any Stanford man
is so lacking in balance and so cow
ardly as to descend to the methods
yesterday used by a certain individual
in regard to the Sophomore campaign.
This incident in itself is too childishly
absurd to warrant attention, save for
the fact, that it might be a precedent
for similar abuses in the future. We
trust, however, that the circumstance
will be regarded only as the inane and
vacuous attempt of a weak and
cowardly mind. Such an anonymous
writer, concealing his identity by the
use of a mimeograph for his letters
and a disguised handwriting for his
envelopes, would be deserving of some
severity, were it not that the ludi
crousness of his attempt evokes pity
for a distorted mind.
