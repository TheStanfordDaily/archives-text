## FACULTY COMMITTEE AND CONFERENCE MEET TOGETHER. Hazing Problem Considered by Assembled Professors and Students. Clark Makes Significant Speech.

it is doubtful if the representatives
of the faculty and of the Student Body
ever came into more friendly and
intimate relations than did the Stu
dent Affairs Committee and the Uni
versity Conference at their joint meet
ing in the Council room yesterday
evening between the hours of 4:1." and
6. A full attendance of both of these
bodies was present and all of the lead
ing spirits of the assembled organi
zations frankly expressed their indi
vidual opinions on matters of perti
nent interest to the Student Body.
The meeting was first called to order
by President S. A. Lindauer, '10. of the
Conference, who spoke, on behalf of
the students, their appreciation of the
willingness of the faculty to meet them
on such a common footing, and ex
pressed his desire that these meetings
might be frequent and fruitful of
tangible results.
Lindauer was followed by Chairman
A. 15. Clark of the Student Affairs
Committee who spoke especially of
the common purpose of both his com
mittee and the Conference, and of'his
sincere hope that they might work in
the best of harmony and cordiality to
ward the truest development of the
real Stanford Spirit and clean stu
dent activities. He pointed out how it
was possible for the Conference to
take a fatherly interest in all the un
derclassmen and encourage and in
spire them to engage in college activi
ties. He said that the Faculty Com
mittee was willing to do all it could
toward this same end. In this con
nection he stated that at present all
student activities are directed by too
few students, and that the Conference
should try and shift some of the re
sponsibility from those competent
leaders who are at present necessar
ily overworked. He also called atten
tion to the University calendar being
maintained by Assistant Registrar .1.
E. McDowell and asked the public to
support it. it' it wished to.
After the talk by Professor Clark
several matters were taken up in
common for informal discussion. That
which evoked the greatest interest
was a discussion of the hazing prob
lem. It seemed to be the unanimous
opinion of the Conference that the
system of hazing as now in vogue in
Stanford is not harmful but a positive
benefit and that as it is conducted
under careful upperclass supervision
it should be maintained as a helpful
institution. This attitude, as it was
strongly voiced by the Conference, was
endorsed by the Student Affairs
Committe, if hazing could be so con
ducted as not to bring on bodily injury,
and not to overburden those Freshmen
who were in need of discipline. Chair
man Clark said that he had no doubt
that some newcomers were in need of
training, but that "tubbing" in the
Hall was not supervised as it should be
by the upperclassmen. Student Ad
visor Roth also expressed a like opin
ion and declared that some of the
Sophomores who did the "tubbing"
were more in need of it than their
victims.
The Conference as a whole seemed
to take this same attitude in the mat
ter; and the sense of the whole meet
ing seemed to be that underclass disci
pline in Encina should lie put on the
same basis as it is conducted in the
various fraternity houses, and that no
one not a resident of Encina should be
brought there to be hazed.
A meeting of the Seniors of Encina
was held yesterday evening for a gen
eral discussion of the same matter.

ties. He said that the Faculty Com
mittee was willing to do all it could
toward this same end. In this con
nection he stated that at present all
student activities are directed by too
few students, and that the Conference
should try and shift some of the re
sponsibility from those competent
leaders who are at present necessar
ily overworked. He also called atten
tion to the University calendar being
maintained by Assistant Registrar .1.
E. McDowell and asked the public to
support it. it' it wished to.
After the talk by Professor Clark
several matters were taken up in
common for informal discussion. That
which evoked the greatest interest
was a discussion of the hazing prob
lem. It seemed to be the unanimous
opinion of the Conference that the
system of hazing as now in vogue in
Stanford is not harmful but a positive
benefit and that as it is conducted
under careful upperclass supervision
it should be maintained as a helpful
institution. This attitude, as it was
strongly voiced by the Conference, was
endorsed by the Student Affairs
Committe, if hazing could be so con
ducted as not to bring on bodily injury,
and not to overburden those Freshmen
who were in need of discipline. Chair
man Clark said that he had no doubt
that some newcomers were in need of
training, but that "tubbing" in the
Hall was not supervised as it should be
by the upperclassmen. Student Ad
visor Roth also expressed a like opin
ion and declared that some of the
Sophomores who did the "tubbing"
were more in need of it than their
victims.
The Conference as a whole seemed
to take this same attitude in the mat
ter; and the sense of the whole meet
ing seemed to be that underclass disci
pline in Encina should lie put on the
same basis as it is conducted in the
various fraternity houses, and that no
one not a resident of Encina should be
brought there to be hazed.
A meeting of the Seniors of Encina
was held yesterday evening for a gen
eral discussion of the same matter.
it is doubtful if the representatives
of the faculty and of the Student Body
ever came into more friendly and
intimate relations than did the Stu
dent Affairs Committee and the Uni
versity Conference at their joint meet
ing in the Council room yesterday
evening between the hours of 4:1." and
6. A full attendance of both of these
bodies was present and all of the lead
ing spirits of the assembled organi
zations frankly expressed their indi
vidual opinions on matters of perti
nent interest to the Student Body.
The meeting was first called to order
by President S. A. Lindauer, '10. of the
Conference, who spoke, on behalf of
the students, their appreciation of the
willingness of the faculty to meet them
on such a common footing, and ex
pressed his desire that these meetings
might be frequent and fruitful of
tangible results.
Lindauer was followed by Chairman
A. 15. Clark of the Student Affairs
Committee who spoke especially of
the common purpose of both his com
mittee and the Conference, and of'his
sincere hope that they might work in
the best of harmony and cordiality to
ward the truest development of the
real Stanford Spirit and clean stu
dent activities. He pointed out how it
was possible for the Conference to
take a fatherly interest in all the un
derclassmen and encourage and in
spire them to engage in college activi
ties. He said that the Faculty Com
mittee was willing to do all it could
toward this same end. In this con
nection he stated that at present all
student activities are directed by too
