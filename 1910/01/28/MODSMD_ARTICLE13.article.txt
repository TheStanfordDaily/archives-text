Editor Daily Palo Alto:
A University workman recently lost
his leg by amputation. He needs a
new one. The only decent sort of a
cork leg will cost $XO. Stanford men
and women are always keen about
doing practical things. One man sug
gests that "a subscription might well
be started among the students." And
like a good man he starts it with $;>.OO
which has since been increased by sub
scription to $26.00. Will others fol
low with larger or smaller amounts
by way of thank offering for their own
good understandings ? Subscriptions
may be paid to the "Charity Fund" at
the Bank of Palo Alto, to Miss Helen
Green at the Kappa Alpha Theta
house, G. B. Bush at Encina, to Miss
Shirley Hyatt, at Roble, or to
