# TRACK TRIALS TO BEGIN SOON.
## Moulton Will Hold Watch On Candidates Next Week.â€”Preliminary Meet February 5. 
### 
Thus far the candidates for the var
sity track team have merely spent
their time in warming up on the cin
der path or in easy practice in the field
events. Beginning sometime during
the coming week, however, "Dad"
Moulton will hold preliminary trials
in an endeavor to obtain a better line
on the abilities of the unknown aspi
rants. On Saturday, February 5, it is
probable that a regular meet will be
held.
The Freshmen are improving in an
encouraging manner, and "Dad" has
already succeeded in finding several
exceptional pole-vaulters among the
first-year men.
