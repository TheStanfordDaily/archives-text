# WILL MEET ST. MARY'S
## OPENING GAME OF SEASON TO BE PLAYED TOMORROW. Visiting Team Has Unusually Strong Line-up, Including Six Veterans of Last Year. 
### 
Unless the elements again interfere,
the baseball season, the opening of
which has twice been postponed on ac
count of a muddy field, will begin to
morrow, when Stanford is scheduled
to meet the St. Mary's College nine.
Tomorrow's game should prove an
interesting one from the standpoint of
the spectators, as the St. Mary's team
is an unusually strong aggregation
this year, six of the nine players being
veterans. Simpson and Leonard, the
crack 1909 battery, will be seen in ac
tion again and without doubt will
make it interesting for the Cardinal
players when they come to the bat.
The other veterans of the Oakland
team who will be on the field are
Sheehy, who will relieve Leonard in
the box, Wilkinson, who will play
second-base, Wallace at third, and
Leonhardt. Against these clever
pitchers, good fielders, and heavy bat
ters the local team will have its hands
full.
H. E. Reed is to take McGregor's
place at center, but with this one ex
ception the Stanford team is to be the
same as scheduled for the two pre
vious games. Many changes will be
made before the end of the game,
however, to give the different men a
chance.
The game will be called on the gym
nasium field at 2:30, and the price of
admission will be 25 cents.
The line-ups follow:
Varsity—catcher, S. Mitchell; pitch
er, M. Mitchell; first base, Ganong;
second base, Mc Fadden; short-stop,
Tallant; third base, Soper; left field,
Jordan; center field. Reed; right field.
Obear.
St. Mary's—catcher, Simpson; pitch
ers, Leonard, Wilcox, Sheehy; first
base, Finnigan; second base, Wilkin
son : short-stop, Fitzsimmons and
Uiugini; third base, Wallace; left field,
Ross; center field. Leonhardt; right
field, Bonneti; substitutes, Miller and
Hughes.
