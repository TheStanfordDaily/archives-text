# OARSMEN IN TRAINING
## CREW CANDIDATES OUT IN FORCE AT LAKE. More Men Urged to Join Club So That Rowing May Be Placed On Firm Financial Basis. 
### 
Active training among the crew can
didates is in full swing under the
direction of the coaching committee
composed of J. C. Huston, '10, .1. W.
Roberts, '10, F. L. Guerena, '11, and .J.
W. Howell, '12. Cross-country run
ning, calisthenics, work on the ma
chines and in the boats compose the
afternoon's work. The fact that one of
i
the barges has been out of commis
sion undergoing repairs has handi
capped the men on the water and has
prevented a large number being at
work at once. Next week it is expect
ed that a greater number may be ac
comodated.
The new men are receiving special
' attention at the hands of the old
oarsmen and are showing up very well.
Under the new coaching system every
one receives an equal share of atten
tion which was not possible under the
old regime. Candidates for the crews
may still sign up any afternoon at the
boat house between 4 and G o'clock.
About sixty-five men are enrolled in
the Lagunita Boat Club at the present
i time, and it is hoped that this number
will be greatly increased before the
j season is very far advanced. More
; men are urged to join the club, as it
lis only with, a large number of stu
dents showing their interest in the
sport that rowing may be placed on
a strong financial basis.
No definite arrangements have been
made as yet for any races, as much de
pends on what the California oars
men decide to do.
