# TEAM TO BE HITTERS
## WITH TOTAL OF 9 HITS CARDINALS DEFEAT PHOENIX. Saturday's Game Opens the Season and Reveals Surprising Strength in Nine. 
### 
The Cardinal baseball season has
opened finally, with a decidedly rosy
outlook for its finish, the tally book
showing a victory over St. Mary's
college last Saturday, 5-3. The re
sult is gratifying, for probably never
has a team with but two veterans
knocked the ball around the lot as
did the Stanford nine in its opener
of the year. With an array of nine
hits, as many as three smashes in one
inning, the fourth, two of them
doubles, it begins to look as though
Stanford would have a hitting and a
winning team for the rest of the
schedule. Due allowance must be
made for the opposing box representa
tive, for he was obviously not the
Phoenix prize twirler, but, all things
considered, the Cardinals batted well.
McFadden was the star in this re
spect. He laid a good foundation for
a batting average with three marks in
the hit column out of four times up.
For all around fine playing, however,
i he palm must go to S. L. Mitchell. '13,
whose work was a pleasure to watch.
Especially is this true when it is re
corded how he retired Leonhardt at
the plate in the second chapter, when
the latter tried to steal home behind
M. Mitchell's wind-up. The Phoenix
nine was a fine one on all counts, and
with a better pitcher the tale might
have been different. Leonard, who
had his toe in the rubber for the vis
itors, received almost faultless sup
port. Wallace was the particular
shining mark among the ixifielrt and
garden positions. His handling of the
intrircate corner was a marvel.
Coach Presley kept, the original
nine men in for the Cardinal firing
line for five chapters, at the end of
which time this semi-veteran team
had acquired a comfortable margin of
3-0 on the score board. After this
almost every place on the diamond
was changed at least twice, right and
center gardens and the box men three
times. McFadden and Tallant alone
played the entire game. Freshmen
who made a good impression, besides
S. Mitchell, were L. Childs and L.
Cass.
The game:
The fourth inning was a history
making one. McFaddeti's clean hit
over second brought reward when
Gaming carried him over the platter
with a double. Jordan completed the
good work with another single while
Ganong finished his round trip of the
bases for the second tally. Score, 2-0.
The fifth chapter added more his
tory. M. Mitchell drew a ticket to
first, accepted Obear's sacrifice and
marked up bis score on McFadden's
hit. Score, 3-0.
Meanwhile, in the sixth. Wilkenson
for Phoenix bad bingled safely, made
second on Child's error, third on a
passed ball and home on a sacrifice
by Simpson. Wallace's story was
nearly thp same: first on an error,
second and third on a wild pitch and
home on sacrifice. Score, 3-2.
In the eighth Hall got life at first on
