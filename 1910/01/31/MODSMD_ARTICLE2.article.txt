# SHOW WINS APPLAUSE
## STANFORD MINSTRELS PLEASE APPRECIATIVE CROWD. Director Morgan Couches Finished Entertainment. — Musical Numbers Attractive. 
### 
That tuneful melodies, bright jest
and monologue, and original stunts—
when properly combined and skill
fully adminsistered—are the ingredi
ents from which to produce a most
enjoyable enteretainment, was amply
demonstrated by the Combined Musi
cal Clubs on Friday evening, when
they presented their Minstrel Show in
Assembly Hall. From the time when
the Minstrels made their dashing en
trance upon the stage until the con
clusion of the last act. in the olio the
audience was entertained with a suc
cession of songs, humorous stories
and vaudeville turns so arranged and
varied that the program did not be
come monotonous but proved inter
esting from first to last. Many of the
songs were new and all were well
rendered; the olio stunts were on the
whole entirely creditable and while
many of the jokes were somewhat the
worse for wear, they were so well dis
guised by local references and allu
sions that they hardly ever failed to
win a generous laugh from the audi
ence.
The mechanical details of the per
formance tveve well worked out and
the seating arrangement of the Min- j
strels was very effective. The cos
tume effect was good, the white sailor j
suits of the double quartette forming
a pleasing contrast to the brightly j
colored costumes of the blackface
singers.
The most valid criticism that could
be made of the show is that while the
beginning of the entertainment was
brisk and snappy, the end was lame
owing to the lack of a closing chorus J
by the whole company. Although the
last act in the olio was clever and orig
inal, it could not supply the place of a j
strong finale by all the singers and in j
consequence a show which started
bravely ended rather tamely.
Among the songs deserving special
mention are "The Rosary" which was j
beautifully rendered by the quartette:
"Night and Day," a tenor solo, by H
B. McGuire, '13, "By the Light of the
Silvery Moon" by P. P. Ward, '12. and
the bass solo, "When the Bell in the ;
Lighthouse Rings," which was sung
by P. F. Pettigrew, '10, accompanied I
by the double quartette. "Keep your i
Foot on the Soft, Soft Pedal," as siing
by E. F. Kern, '13. also met with a de
cidedly favorable response from the '
audience, as did the catchy song,
"Casey Jones," which was rendered by
the six endmen.
The pronounced bit among the olio
acts was undoubtedly the "Chalk
Talk" given by E. M. Albright, '12,
during which the artist drew some
unusually clever local sketches. Al
bright's act, both as regards bis car
toons and his monologue, was easily
on a par with the best professional
work. His drawings met with instant
favor, (he illuminated lake scene in
particular bringing an exceptionally
hearty outburst of applause.
The skit by P. J. Forest, '3 and D.
P.. Stuart, '12 proved entertaining,
Forrest's clog dancing being much

better than the usual amatuer per
formance. P. P. Ward, '12 appeared in
a blackface turn which was well re
ceived as was the musical act, pre
sented by 11. E. Reed, '10. W. S. Wil
son. '13 and H. R. Spence, '13.
The entire management of the per
formance was in the hands of G. F.
Morgan, who again demonstrated his
ability as a theatrical director.
