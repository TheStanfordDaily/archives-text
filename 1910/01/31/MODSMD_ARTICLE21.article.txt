# CRITICIZES OLD GAME.
## Dr. Angell Condemns American Football and Describes Rugby at Stanford in "Independent." 
### 
Dr. F. Angell, of the Faculty Com
mittee on Athletics, has contributed a
complete and interesting survey of the
introduction and the development of
the game of English Rugby at Stan
ford to the last number of the "In
dependent" Magazine. Professor An
gell gives a very clear account of the
manner in which the British sport was
considered as a substitute for the old
American game, and also shows to
what extent the new form of football
has obtained a hold upon the Univer
sity athletics.
In commenting upon the old game,
Dr. Angell remarks: "It was evident
that the game had ceased to be a sport
in any sense of the word; it was
never played for fun; it was played by
a chosen few, and the few selected
were necessarily big and muscular."
One of the results of the introduc
tion of the new game is summed up by
Dr. Angell as follows: "The increase
in football skill has been remarkable;
for every man who could punt 45
yards four years ago we now have ten,
and the number of good drop-kickers
is increasing rapidly."
