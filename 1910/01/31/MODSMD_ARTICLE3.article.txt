# WORK IS UNFINISHED
## REVISION OF INTERCOLLEGIATE AGREEMENT INCOMPLETE. Settlement of Important Question of Eligibility Postponed Until Thursday, February 
### 
Although the second meeting of the
Intercollegiate Agreement Committees,
held last Friday night at the Palace
Hotel in San Francisco, resulted in
several important changes in the ex
isting agreement, the real work of the
conference—the work of settling the
eligibility question—could not be
brought to a satisfactory conclusion
and so was postponed until the coming
Thursday evening. As was shown
last fall, when D. P. Crawford's eligi
bility was disputed, both Stanford and
California have different ideas on the
subject and so, although the committee
members have spent much of their
time at previous meetings in discus
sing the matter, their ideas still clash
strongly enough to necessitate their
convening again.
If was decided that in future track
meets one starter should do the work
that has always been done by two in
contests of the past, and that this
starter, as well as the referee and
clerk of the course, should be a man
who has never been closely assoo
ciated with either university. This de
cision does away with any possibility
of •>n official favoring his own team.
Students in affiliated colleges such
as Hastings Law School and Cooper
Medical institute, to enter which col
-1 legiate examinations are not required,
will hereafter be rated as "specials,"
and as such will not be eligible for
! varsity teams until credited with ten
hours of work. If this ruling had been
in effect last year several of Califor
nia's best players would not have been
able to compete.
The suggestion that the preliminary
trials of the field events of the coming
track meets should be held in the
mornings of the days of the contests,
which was favorably received by the
committees a week ago, was unfav
orably reconsidered Friday night, as
was the plan that the tennis men of
the universities draft the tennis agree
ment. The graduate managers are to
confer with the racquet enthusiasts of
their respective colleges and to carry
out, if possible, the ideas suggested by
them.
The last work of Hie meeting was
the mutual agreement that students
registering more than twenty-five days
after the official opening of a semester,
and those holding remunerative offices
of an elective character in either stu
dent body, should be considered ineli
gible as varsity athletes.
Both Stanford and California's rep
resentatives at this last meeting were
the same as previously.
