# HOLD MEET SATURDAY
## INTERCLASS TRACK CONTEST WILL START SEASON. Freshmen Hare Promising Quartermilers.â€”Horine and Miller Will Make Good Vaulters. 
### 
An interclass track meet which is
scheduled to be held next Saturday
morning will give contenders for
honors on the track their first chance
to compete this semester. Captain
Scott has not yet decided whether to
have each class enter the meet indivi
dually or have the Seniors and Sopho
mores oppose the Juniors and Fresh
men.
This meet will be an excellent op
portunity for "Dad" Moulton to obtain
a line on the new men and he de
sires everyone now working on the
track to prepare for his events. From
Wednesday until Saturday trials will
be run in order to gain some idea of
the condition of the athletes and to
place the novices in the events to
which they are most adapted natural
ly. Particular attention is being given
to Freshmen in this matter, and "Dad"
is spending much time in deciding in
which races to run them.
The list of quarter-milers has been
considerably strengthened by the ad
dition of R. E. Millsap, '12, who made a
creditable showing in this event last
year but was unfortunately prevented
from competing with California on
account of illness. Millsap is show
ing good form and should rapidly
round into condition. The Freshman
class has also some good 440 men, and
it would not be surprising if a varsity
man was developed from the lot.
G. L. Horine, '13, and J. A. Miller,
'13, appear to be the mainstays of the
Freshmen in the pole-vault although
several others are performing credit
ably. Horine has cleared the bar at.
11 feet, while Miller has been recorded
as doing 10 feet (> inches.
