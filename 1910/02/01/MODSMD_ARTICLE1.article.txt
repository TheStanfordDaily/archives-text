# TO PLAY SANTA CLARA
## VARSITY TO MEET CHAMPIONS ON LOCAL DIAMOND. Canterbury to Appear on Third and Jones to Be in the Box For Cardinals. 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon The first base
ball game of the season with Santa
Clara which before had to be post
poned on account of unfavorable
weather, is to be played, when the two
teams will cross bats on the local
diamond, instead of in the mission
town as was planned. This change
was deemed advisable because a trip
at ibis time of the year, only one game
having been played, was consideicd
unwise as Coach Presley wishes to try
out several men for each of the posi
tions which would make the scpuul too
unwieldy for an outside game.
The game tomorrow should be in
teresting and hard fought, for the vis
itors have a classy aggregation of ball
players, practically the whole team
being veterans. The Cardinal batters
will doubtless be kept busy with
Agnew, the prize twirler, in the box,
and Carterfield behind the plate.
Two new men are to appear in the
Cardinal line-up at the beginning of
the game. J. .T. .Tones, the former
Santa Clara pitcher, is to be in the box
against his one-time team-mates. E.
R. Canterbury, '12, who caught for
the 1909 varsity, and who has recently
returned to college, is to be on third.
It is understood that Canterbury will
lie eligible to play in the intercolle
giate series this year.
The game is to begin at 4:15 on the
old diamond, and the admission is i°
be 2i> cents.
The line-ups follow:
Varsity—Catcher, S. Mitchell; pitch
er, Jones; first base, Ganong: second
base, McFadden ; short, stop, Tallant;
third base, Soper; left field, Jordan;
center field, Reed; right field, Obenr.
