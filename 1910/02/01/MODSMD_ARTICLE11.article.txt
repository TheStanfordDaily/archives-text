Seldom does a year go by without a
fatality on the waters of Lake Lagun
ita. Mindful of tragic occurrences in
the past, we would recall an old ad
age concerning "an ounce of preven
tion." At present, numerous young
sters of varying sizes and ages are in
the habit of spending the afternoon
playing around the boat house. Minor
accidents are constantly happening,
and only yesterday two of the careless
enthusiasts were pulled out of the
lake by members of the rowing squad.
It is for the parents of the children to
keep their offspring away from tlie
danger, for the crew men do not aspire
to permanent occupation as rescuers.
Furthermore, the preventive remedy
should be administered at once. Some
day soon it may be too late.
