# WILL TRAIN ON TURF
## TRACK MEN WILL MAKE USE OF FOOTBALL FIELD. Efforts to Be Made by These In Charge to Prevent Recurring Annual Break-downs. 
### 
In order to prevent the unnecessary
accidents and breakdowns among the
sprinters, which has characterized
track seasons in the past, the south
side of the turf held is to be prepared
for their exclusive use. A path about
twenty feet wide, the entire length of
the field, will be rolled and all chuck
holes tilled so that the short-distance
men will be able to train on a soft
track. This move on the part of the
officials was made with the intention
of keeping the 100 and 220 yard men
in the prime of condition throughout
the season and of doing away with the
annual accident list which the student
body has grown to expect each year.
H. E. Reed, '10, the sprinter, will
probably be seen on the new training
path about three weeks before the
Varsity meet. The presence of Reed
in the sprints with T. L. Coleman, '12,
will make doubly sure a Stanford
victory in these races, which until
last year, had been California's strong
hold.
A considerable part of the prelimi
nary training of the crew men this
season lias been done in practicing the
weight events and several of the oars
men have shown great promise.
Among them, K. L. Dole, '11, has done
the best work. Dole is capable of
putting the shot close to forty feet and
with a little more experience, will do
equally well in the hammer.
The Freshmen are working con
sistently, but as yet. they have not
been training long enough to get into
any sort of condition. "Dad" Moul
ton has been caused extreme annoy
ance by the fact that the majority of
the new men go on the track without
reporting to him, consequently he does
not obtain the names of many of them.
To do away with this, the following
notice has been posted at the training
liouse: "All track-team Freshmen
must report to me before working out.
Trainer Moulton."
