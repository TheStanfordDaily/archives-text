### 
Manager G. F. Morgan of the Com
bined Musical Club's Minstrel Show,
which was given last Friday evening
in the Assembly Hall, announces that
the net profits amount to $170. Al
though iliis is not as large an amount
as lias been made by other productions
given on the campus, the fact, can he
accounted for. by the large expense*
for the elaborate costuming of the
performance.
The club will use the money either
in aiding the track team in their an
nual trip to the Conference Meet in
Chicago, or in swelling the fund for
the Stanford Union. Should it be de
cided that the track team is not to
make the trip next summer, the money
will then lie turned over 1o the Stan
ford Union.
