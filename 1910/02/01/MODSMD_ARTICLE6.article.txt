# CREW MEN PLAN RACES
## TO ROM ON LAKE MERRITT AND AT SAN DIEGO. Reynolds To Assist In Coaching.-Squad Increased By Four New Candidates. 
### 
Lake Merritt will be the scene of an
inter-club regatta in March when
four-oared barges representing the
leading rowing clubs of the bay re
gion will contest for supremacy.
Crews from the Lagunita Boat Club,
Alameda Boat Club, South End Row
ing Club, and the Dolphins are entered
in the race which promises to be an
exciting one, judging from the strength
of the respective fours in past sea
sons.
The local club will probably be
represented by the same four which
competed for Stanford in the Portola
Regatta on San Francisco Bay last
semester. The men forming this crew
were J. C. Huston, '10, C. L. Schaupp.
'12, R. R. Gilmore, '12, K. H. Seward,
'12, and F. L. Guerena, '11. In this
race, which was won by Alameda, the
barge rowed by the Stanford men
foundered during the last half-mile,
thus preventing the crew from finish
ing. The men will use the new barge
in the coming regatta.
During the mid-semester vacation
the club plans to send a Senior and a
Junior crew south to row in the San
Diego regatta.
Plans for the inter-club regatta with
California are still undecided owing to
the fact that the men of that club are
■ not as yet completely organized. It is
I hoped that something definite will be
arranged in the near future.
The crew squad has been increased
| by the signing up of four promising
j candidates, namely: C. E. Bee, '10, It.
M. Rounds, '13, S. Griep, '13, and 1.
Turpin, '13. The coaching squad will
] be materially strengthened by the ad
j dition of last year's Varsity captain.
;R. H. Reynolds, '10. The advice of
ibis veteran will be of great help in
developing the new men.
