# AERO CLUB ORGANIZED
## STANFORD ENTHUSIASTS PLAN AERONAUTIC EXPERIMENTS. Forty Men Join New Organization Which Is First of Its Kind In West. 
### 
Aeronautics received recognition at
Stanford last night by the formation of
an Aero Club. Over fifty men attend
ed the meeting, forty of whom joined
the club. It was expected that Pro
fessor W. F. Durand of the Mechanical
Engineering department would be
present and address the gathering, but
as he was unable to attend, J. A. Mil
ler, '13 opened the meeting.
Arrangements were made to meet
every other Tuesday evening at 7:45
in room 268 and meetings are to be
addressed by some authority on aero
planes or by two or three of the club
members upon some interesting topic
relating to aerial navagation.
Next semester something may be
done towards building an aeroplane,
and it is possible that experiments
may lie conducted with a glider this
semester. The glider was built here
last year and is now the property of
one of the members of the club.
At the next meeting it is hoped that
Professor Durand will be present and
will give a talk upon aerial navaga
tion. If he is unable to do so the
meeting will be addressed by C. It.
Ransom, '10, B. W. Lee, Jr., '11, and
R. L. Murray, '13, upon "Dirigible
Balloons."
Aero clubs are successful in the
eastern colleges and intercollegiate

these organiaztions. Stanford is the
first college in the west to start an
Aero club. All those who are interest

present and address the gathering, but
as he was unable to attend, J. A. Mil
ler, '13 opened the meeting.
Arrangements were made to meet
every other Tuesday evening at 7:45
in room 268 and meetings are to be
addressed by some authority on aero
planes or by two or three of the club
members upon some interesting topic
relating to aerial navagation.
Next semester something may be
done towards building an aeroplane,
and it is possible that experiments
may lie conducted with a glider this
semester. The glider was built here
last year and is now the property of
one of the members of the club.
At the next meeting it is hoped that
Professor Durand will be present and
will give a talk upon aerial navaga
tion. If he is unable to do so the
meeting will be addressed by C. It.
Ransom, '10, B. W. Lee, Jr., '11, and
R. L. Murray, '13, upon "Dirigible
Balloons."
Aero clubs are successful in the
