# TOO COLD FOR TRACK
## SATURDAY'S MEET POSTPONED UNTIL LATER. 1913 Track Men Sure of Three Strong Hurdlers.â€”Outlook Brightens in Consequence. 
### 
The cold weather of the past week
has caused the postponement of the
track meet planned for Saturday morn
ing as Trainer Moulton is unwilling to
have his men run the risk of a break
denvn so early in tlie season and the
cold weather doubles the chances of
injury in starting and running the
shorter distances. A meet will lie
held, however, on February 12, if the
weather is favorable.
A number of trials will be held at
11 rj'clock Saturday morning but it
will be merely fe>r determining what
condition some of the men are in and
where to place some newcomers.
"Dad" has only allowed the men to
indulge in light training as yet, wish
ing to get them in better condition be
fore putting the athletes through their
regular paces. The sprinters and
hurdlers devote most of their time in
jogging around the track and the
latter will not be allowed to go over
the sticks until the weather becomes
warmer.
Trials in the low and high hurdles
are awaited with considerable interest
as the Freshman contingent in these
events contains several men who have
made reputations for themselves in
preparatory school meets. E. V. Rud
dick, E. Kern and H. B. McGuire are
looked upon as the mainstays of 1913
over the sticks and are expected to
make things hum when they ceime to
gether. Ruddick, the versatile Ukiah
athlete, was easily the best hurd
ler in the schools around the bay, de
feating Fteeson on every occasion they
have met. Kern made a fine showing
in the south and at Berkeley, while
McGuire, who hails from Portland was
considered invincible in that legality.
Captain Scott, announces a change
In the training regulations in that on
Saturdays on which a baseball game
is played on the Campus, all track
men should de> their training in the
morning if possible.
