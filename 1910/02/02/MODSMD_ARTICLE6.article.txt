# MONEY APPROPRIATED
## STUDENT BODY SETS ASIDE $4000 FOR IMPROVEMENTS. Burbank Rearranges Track and Baseball Schedules.â€”No Trips For Nine This Season. 
### 
The splendid condition of the Student
Body's finances was clearly brought
out in the semester's report of the
graduate manager which was printed
in the Daily Palo Alto some days ago,
but. the fact that in the last few weeks
$3,500 has been put into permanent
improvements in the athletic equip
ment emphasizes this even more
strongly. $2,000 of this money has
been placed at interest as a sinking
fund, which is to be increased yearly,
and which will ultimately be used for
the restoration of the bleachers on
Stanford Field and the remaining
$1,500 has been turned over to the
Board of Control to help meet, the ex
penses of the construction of the new
track training house.
This training house which will cost
in all about $1,000, will embody all the
latest, improvements for buildings of
its character. It is being designed by
S. M. Wadsworth, '10, with the aid
and suggestions of Professor Wing
and "Dad" Moulton.
Besides being actively engaged in
planning for the future, Manager Bur
bank is busy with the exigencies of the
present. The recent decision of St.
Vincent's College to abandon all inter
collegiate athletics has disturbed the
baseball schedule and made it im
possible for the Varsity nine to have a
southern trip this season. There is a
possibility of the team going to Nevada
but finances render such a journey
improbable.
The track schedule has also been
subjected to changes which have been
caused by the Agreement Committee's
decision to play the second intercol
legiate baseball game on the day on
which the Freshman Meet, was to have
been held. The new schedule is as
follows: March 5, Varsity-TT. S. C., at
Los Angeles; March 12, Varsity-Olym
pic. campus; March 19, Freshman
Meet, Berkeley; March 22, Varsity-U.
S. C., campus; April 5, Tnterclass;
April 10, Intercollegiate, campus.
