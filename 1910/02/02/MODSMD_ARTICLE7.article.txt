The tipping of a canoe on Lake Ln
gunita was the cause of another fatality
this afternoon when Long, one of the
Chinaman employed at the Kappa
Sigma house was drowned while row
ing with two companions. None of
them could swim and had it not been
for the prompt action of ,T. F. Part
ridge, '12, and R. H. Reynolds, '10, who
were practicing in the two-oared shell
near by all three would have drowned.
Wong and Yen, the two who were
saved are both employed at the Phi

dents are at work dragging the lake
but as yet the body has not been
recovered.
