Not so very long ago the daily paper
at the University of Nebraska, cham
pioning the cause of the undergradu
ate, published a short list containing
the names of those few professors who
made it a habit to dismiss their classes
immediately upon the expiration of
the scheduled period. Were we to
publish such a list, several well
known professors would not be en
rolled thereon. But we have decided
to forego so personal an attack, not
because we deem it too severe on the
offending or too complimentary to
ward the righteous, but because we
would fear for the security of some ol
our hours, should we omit certain
professors, whom our conscience
would justly prevent us from includ
ing. Accordingly, we will merely state
that the failure to dismiss classes on
time is being overdone by some few
instructors. Such a practice is mani
festly unfair to the student and to-the
professor in whose class he will be
during the following period. If a
four-hour course should be a five
hour one, make it so. But let us cease
to gain the extra unit by a daily ten
minute excess.
