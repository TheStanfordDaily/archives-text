WILSON
sold Candies on the University Campus in a little
store where the Inn now stands.
Ever sinee then he has been trying to make
better candies than any one else.
EXTRAVAGANCE in the use of (ine materials
has been his hobby. It's an expensive hobby, hut
it's a wonderful help in milking good candies.
Try Wilson's delicious Cream Caramels next
time you're down town. They're a good example
of Wilson quality.
