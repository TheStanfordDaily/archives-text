# DISCUSSION OF GAME
## FRESHMAN RUGBY CONTEST IS FULLY CONSIDERED. Faculty Athletic Committee and Student Executive Board Arrive at No Definite Decision. 
### 
Last evening the Executive Com
mittee consumed most of the time of
the meeting in a discussion with the
Faculty Athletic Committee in regard
to the future status of the Freshman
Rugby game. There is considerable
feeling among the Faculty Committee
that the game as played now between
Stanford and California should not be
permitted to continue. After argu
ing both sides of the question, how
ever, it was decided to postponed any
definite action until some future date.
IT. V. Poor, '10, whose design for a
track medal was accepted at the
meeting one week ago reported that
the design for the new crew medal was
almost finished and would be ready
for inspection at the next meeting of
the Committee.
Graduate Manager Burbank report
ed that the $2000 of the building and
loan fund, which had been turned over
to him had been deposited, and was
now in safe keeping until such time as
it should be needed.
The Committee appointed two new
rubbers for the track season. The men
whose names have been added to the
rubbing assistants, and who will help
condition the track team for the Inter
collegiate contest are S. H. Bellali. 10,
and K. I>. Dole, '11.
Last semester the Committee an
nounced that it was the sense of that
body that in future no shows given by
Stanford students should solicit adver
tising of any kind for the printed
program to be used at the perfor
mance. Since this action by the Com
mittee shows have been given, but ad
vertising appeared on the program. It
was found that the students in charge
of the productions had not solicited ad
vertising but had solicited for firms to
print the program with the privilege
of space to announce the fact. It was
decided that in future the management
should not be allowed to solicit for
advertising matter as such or for
firms to print Ihe programs gratuitous
ly with the advertising privilege.
The regular funds for the Rugby
Union for the current year were re
ported paid by Manager Burbank.
The other item of interest discussed
was that, of the method and time for
electing the baseball captain, this posi
tion having been left open by the fail
ure of T. A. Cadwalader, ex-'O9. to
return to college. Tt was decided that
the captain should be elected by the
team and substitutes as soon as these
were chosen.
