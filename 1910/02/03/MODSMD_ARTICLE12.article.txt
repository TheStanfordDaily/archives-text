Once again we must hark back to
(hat old, old topicâ€”our sidewalks.
Much has been said, but apparently
not enough. Much has been done, but
just as apparently, not enough. And
we desire to know why, in the name
of common sense, several loads of
gravel are dumped near the quad at a
point frequented by relatively few
people, and not even a grain of sand
placed between the Inn and the Ro
manic Languages Building , where
hundreds of students are forced to
wade several times daily, whenever
we have a slight rain. A trip from the
Inn to the quad on an inclement night
is at preseut an exceedingly brave un
dertaking. The perils are many, and
the comforts none.
