# MAN FROM HOME HAS TO WALK.
## Permission to Use Real Automobile Denied Sword and Sandals By Powers That Be. 
### 
The hard toil of the enlarged stage
crew was for naught. The automobile
was put upon the Assembly Hall stage
only to be hastily and abruptly re
moved by the imperial and imperative
edict of Treasurer C. G. Lathrop. And
despite the length and perils of the
journey, the "Man from Home" is
doomed to come on foot. By means of
forced marches and unceasing zeal,
however, he will be able to reach
Stanford in time for the performance
of Saturday night. Meanwhile, Sword
and Sandals is doing its utmost to
provide the Indianan with a suitable
imitation, once he reaches the campus.
The sale of seats at the Bookstore
and the Stanford Pharmacy has reach
ed the high figure of $900.
