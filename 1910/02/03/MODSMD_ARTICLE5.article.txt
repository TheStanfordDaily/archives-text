## 
### 
The body of Long, the Chinaman who
was drowned in Lake Lagunlta yester
day afternoon, was recovered today
about 2:30 o'clock by S. L. Mitchell
and L. Cass. Students in several
boats had been dragging the lake with
grappling hooks the entire day, three
boats being at work at the time Cass
and Mitchell brought the body to the
surface.
The body was immediately turned
over to his celestial friends, many of
whom were present at the lake at the
time of the recovery.
