# COMMITTEES SET DATE
## JUNIOR FESTIVITIES FROM MARCH 17 to 19. Prom Committee Requests That Use of Carriages and Flowers for Dance Be Abolished. 
### 
Actual work upon preparations for
Junior Week festivities was com
menced lust night by two of the com
mittees that were appointed to take
charge of the class activities during
that time. Both the Junior Opera and
ihe Prom Committees held busi
ness sessions, and definite steps were
taken by the two boards toward the
final completion of the plans for these
events. Early preparations have been
instituted upon the part of the com
mittees so as to have all plans com-
I ifiete at the earliest possible date.
The Junior Opera will usher in
Junior Week 011 Ihe evening of Thurs
day, March 17. while Friday, March
IS. will be declared a holiday by the
University authorities so that this
day may be used by the class as Jun
ior Day. The annual Prom will be
held in Encina Hall upon ihe evening
of Junior Day. These dates were
chosen by the committees in charge in
view of the fact that the following
week, in which the Junior events have
generally been held in the past, hap
pened to be Holy Week. The present
date will also allow those track men
who desire to attend the Junior Opera
and Prom to do so as March 17 is
four weeks previous to the intercol
legiate meet. Strict training rules do
not go into effect until three weeks be
fore the Varsity meet.
The Prom Committee requests that
all those who attend the Prom dis
pense with the use of carriages for
transportation to and from Encina, and
that, the custom of sending flowers be
done away with. This is desired by
the conjmittee in view of the fact that
this custom was abolished during the
past two Junior Proms and also be
cause of the fact that there are many
who are not able to attend the dance
on account of the extra expense en-
I tailed by these accessories.
Immediate action is to be undertaken
| by the Junior Opera Committee with
! reference to the choice of a play for
j t lie Junior Opera. In order to start
upon the actual technical work of
producing the play at an early date,
: t he committee has set Wednesday, Feli
j ruary 10, as the last day upon which
I manuscripts may be handed to that
| board for their approval or rejection.
With $7Â« r > at their disposal, the com
mittee have the power to choose either
a manuscript written by a student or
to go into the professional field for the
score, although the sense of the Juni
ors is to give the preference to one
that is handed in by a student attend
ing college. At. the present time, there
are several in the Student Pody who
are now at work upon the comple
tion of original manuscripts dealing
primarily with Stanford life contain
ing liberal dashes of local color.
Chairman R. Woodville and R. J.
Miller, of the Opera Comittee, will
visit. San Francisco next. Monday for
the purpose of making preliminary ar
rangements for the retaining of a
professional coach, who will have
charge of the technical part of the
opera.
