# COMMITTEES TO MEET AGAIN.
## Intercollegiate Agreement To Be Discussed For Third Time This Evening. 
### 
What is hoped to be the last meet
ing of the Intercollegiate Agreement
Committees will he held this evening
at the Palace Hotel in San Francis >.
Twice before the representatives of
Stanford and California have come to
gether and worked on the thorough re
vision of the old unsatisfactory agree
ment, and, although they have mater
ially bettered many of its points, the
one of most interest—the settlement of
the period of athletic eligibility—still
remains to he decided to the satisfac
tion of the parties.
At both of the previous meetings the
representatives have spent much time
in discussing the ambiguous "four
year rule" which was so differently
interpreted by the two colleges during
the last, football season, but their
points of view were so different that
the subject will have to be entirely
thrashed over again tonight. Califor
nia is rather luke warmly in favor of
ruling that an athlete could only be
eligible for intercollegiate contests for
four years after the date of his matri
culation, even though he may have
left college for some time. The Stan
ford representatives have shown them
selves to be heartily against such a
plan and in favor of allowing partici
pation for eight, semesters. Something
approaching the latter plan is ex
pected to be decided upon tonight.
