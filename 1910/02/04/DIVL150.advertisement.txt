WILSON
sold Candies on the University Campus in a little
store where the Inn now stands.
Ever sinee then he has been trying to make
better eandies than any one else.
EXTRAVACANCE in the use of fine materials
has been his hobby. It's an expensive hobby, but
it's a wonderful help in making good eandies.
Try Wilson's delicious Cream Caramels next
time you're down town. They're a good example
of Wilson quality.
