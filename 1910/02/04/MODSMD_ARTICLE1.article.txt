# COMMITTEES DISAGREE
## ELIGIBILITY QUESTION DELAYS REVISION OF AGREEMENT. Representatives of Stanford and California Unable to Settle Disputed Point 
### 
So thoroughly was the work of revis
ing the old Intercollegiate Agreement
carried on last night by the represen
tative committees of Stanford and
California, that the document as it
now stands is a disagreement. In fact
no athletic agreement now exists be
tween the two colleges, for the settle
ment of the much mooted eligibility
question proved even more of a stumbl
ing block than was anticipated, and
caused the committee members to call
their whole work off, and the meet
ing to break up in despair after five
hours of useless argument.
At first California wanted the rule
to so read that students would be
eligible for intercollegiate contests for
a period of four years after the date
of their matriculation. The Stanford
representatives urged that such a rule
would be obviously unfair to their
college where a system of probation,
a thing unknown at California, was in
effect and where many of the under
graduate courses required five years
of work.
Then, after a long discussion Stan
ford expressed a willingness to make
a six-year rule, but California's ob
jections to this were firm in the ex
treme. Another protracted argument
followed which was finally ended by
the state university's representatives
offering to compromise on a five-year
agreement. But Presley, Burbank and
Barrett could not see the advantages
of such a ruling and the meeting was
adjourned indefinitely.
Another meeting of the committee
will necessarily be called, for inter
collegiate athletics without an agree
ment would be as impossible as a
national government under a system
of anarchy. When this meeting is to
be is not known now, but as the
Freshman meet is impending, it will
probably be called within a week.
