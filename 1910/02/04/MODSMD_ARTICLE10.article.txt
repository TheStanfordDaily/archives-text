We thoroughly and heartily agree
with Professor Murray, when he
states that "one may fairly protest
against interference with one's right
to be religious." But we vigorously
disagree with Dr. Gardner, when he
states that the wholesale taking of
pictures on Sunday morning is a
reason for non-attendance at Sunday
services. It is not a reason at all.
It is a consequence. Would such a
time for photographs ever be set if
even a few members of the various or
ganizations which had announced
meetings for the Sabbath would, but
for that, go to church? We think not.
Would the habit of holding meetings
of any sort on Sunday morning have
ever grown up, if the habit of going
to church had not died out ? We
think not. We deplore the current
conditions, but their presence can not
be denied. Let no pictures be taken;
let no meetings be held; let each
member of the student body schedule
absolutely nothing for Sunday. Would
the attendance at church be in
creased? We think not.
We praise Dr. Gardner in his sin
cere efforts to remedy this existing
evil, and we hope that he will be suc
cessful. It is a difficult problem to
find the real cause, for it. lies fax
deeper than the practice of making
photographic appointments on Sun
day or any other similar custom But
the real seed from which the lack of
reverence has sprung must be found
before a crusade to better conditions
will be a possibility.
