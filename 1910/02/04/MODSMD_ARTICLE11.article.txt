Any dissatisfaction with the severity
of the penalty inflicted upon the two
students who infringed the quarantine
rules is completely ill-founded. Regu
lations made for the greatest good of
the greatest number must be adhered
to, and such adherance must be sh'iet
ly enforced. The prevention of in
'rscf'nns by physical force is, in the

I majority of instances, either impractic
able or impossible. Consequently, the
task of living up to the law is left to
each individual himself. Under this
method, it is, we regret to say, abso
lutely necessary to pronounce seem
ingly harsh sentences in order that
the number of infringements may be
j reduced to a minimum and the import
ance of the problem adequately real
ized. Had the present undergraduate
body been in attendance at Stanford
during the severe epidemics which
loom up so darkly in the University's
history, the advisability of such strin
gent action would doubtless be fully
appreciated. Mindful of the past, Pro
fessor Gilbert is proceeding wisely in
the present.
