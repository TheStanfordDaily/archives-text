# URGE STRONG PROTEST
## INTERFERENCE WITH SUNDAY DEPRECATED. Dr. Gardner and Prof. Murray Argue Forcibly Against Infringement of Sabbath. 
### 
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Sunday is a day set apart by law and
common usage for the conservation of
three principles of vital worth to the
individual citizen and the nation; viz,
rest, recreation and religion.
In a university one may reasonably
expect educated men and women to
guard these principles — if not for
themselves, at least for others, yet
Sunday study is common, and Sunday
rest and recreation, therefore, neg
lected.
More than eighty per cent, of the
present student body are members of,
or express preference for some church.
Sunday is the recognized day for pub
lic worship. What proportion of the
eighty per cent attend public worship,
either in church or college chapel ?
1 hear many excuses for non-atten
dance, much debate about the question
"why don't young men go to church?"
The answers are many and varied, the
reasons generally poor. Now appears
a new reason! In your paper of last
evening no less than seven student or
ganizations of men announce meetings
for Sunday morning, at or near the
hour of worship, to have photographs
taken ! !
Sir, I feel jealous for the good name
of Stanford. I feel very deeply the
irreverance which prevails among us.
I dread the materialism which hangs
like a blight over many a student's
mind. For these reasons, therefore, I
am sorry to see the one day which
may be used for higher interests and
serious duties devoted to such triviali
ties as the taking of pictures. It. robs
students of the opportunity for church
attendance, and imposes upon men of
business unnecessary work. I know
that, this apparent conspiracy to keep
men away from public worship is an
accident, but it is a glaring example
of our carelessness and thoughtless
ness.
As the Chaplain of the University 1

plead against our common disregard
of the Sabbath. I plead with Stanford
men to throw off the habit of Sunday
study. Let us preserve Sunday, both
for our own sakes, and for the sake of
others, as a day consecrated to rest,
recreation and religion. Let the spirit
of Stanford express itself, not merely
in terms of self-gratification and self
glorification, but also in terms of self
sacrifice and self- denial.
And I beg your co-operation, and
the co-operation of every loyal son and
daughter of the University, in the
creation of a sensitive corporate con
science, and a sane public opinion in
this and kindred matters.
Yours faithfully,
(Signed) D. CHARLES GARDNER
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
No one will question the fact that
the era of constraint in matters of
religious observance is past and gone,
and few would wish to recall it; but,
while recognizing the right of the in
dividual to be as indifferent as he
pleases in such matters, one may fairly
protest against interference with one's
right to be religious, if one sees fit.
1 note in last night's issue of your
paper that a number of student organi
zations have fixed upon Sunday morn
ing at practically the hour of church
service as a time for meeting for the
purpose of having photographs taken.
Surely this amounts to a certain con
straint tending to interfere with the
individual's right to attend a place of
worship; which right is as sacred as
that of another to be indifferent in
matters of Sunday observance.
May 1 not suggest that a little
thought on the part of those who make
these appointments would lead to the
selection of some other hour than
10:30 Sunday morning ?

three principles of vital worth to the
individual citizen and the nation; viz,
rest, recreation and religion.
In a university one may reasonably
expect educated men and women to
guard these principles — if not for
themselves, at least for others, yet
Sunday study is common, and Sunday
rest and recreation, therefore, neg
lected.
More than eighty per cent, of the
present student body are members of,
or express preference for some church.
Sunday is the recognized day for pub
lic worship. What proportion of the
eighty per cent attend public worship,
either in church or college chapel ?
1 hear many excuses for non-atten
dance, much debate about the question
"why don't young men go to church?"
The answers are many and varied, the
reasons generally poor. Now appears
a new reason! In your paper of last
evening no less than seven student or
ganizations of men announce meetings
for Sunday morning, at or near the
hour of worship, to have photographs
taken ! !
Sir, I feel jealous for the good name
of Stanford. I feel very deeply the
irreverance which prevails among us.
I dread the materialism which hangs
like a blight over many a student's
mind. For these reasons, therefore, I
am sorry to see the one day which
may be used for higher interests and
serious duties devoted to such triviali
ties as the taking of pictures. It. robs
students of the opportunity for church
attendance, and imposes upon men of
business unnecessary work. I know
that, this apparent conspiracy to keep
men away from public worship is an
accident, but it is a glaring example
of our carelessness and thoughtless
ness.
As the Chaplain of the University 1

plead against our common disregard
of the Sabbath. I plead with Stanford
men to throw off the habit of Sunday
study. Let us preserve Sunday, both
for our own sakes, and for the sake of
others, as a day consecrated to rest,
recreation and religion. Let the spirit
of Stanford express itself, not merely
in terms of self-gratification and self
glorification, but also in terms of self
sacrifice and self- denial.
And I beg your co-operation, and
the co-operation of every loyal son and
daughter of the University, in the
creation of a sensitive corporate con
science, and a sane public opinion in
this and kindred matters.
Yours faithfully,

No one will question the fact that
the era of constraint in matters of
religious observance is past and gone,
and few would wish to recall it; but,
while recognizing the right of the in
dividual to be as indifferent as he
pleases in such matters, one may fairly
protest against interference with one's
right to be religious, if one sees fit.
1 note in last night's issue of your
paper that a number of student organi
zations have fixed upon Sunday morn
ing at practically the hour of church
service as a time for meeting for the
purpose of having photographs taken.
Surely this amounts to a certain con
straint tending to interfere with the
individual's right to attend a place of
worship; which right is as sacred as
that of another to be indifferent in
matters of Sunday observance.
May 1 not suggest that a little
thought on the part of those who make
these appointments would lead to the
selection of some other hour than
10:30 Sunday morning ?
