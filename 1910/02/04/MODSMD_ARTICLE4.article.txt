## Sword and Sandals to Produce Drama In Assembly Hall With Strong Cast and Incomparable Mounting. BY E.M. LEAF. 
### 
Despite the fact that he has been
denied the use of an automobile and
has, perforce, been compelled to re
sort. to a more plebian vehiehle, "The
Man From Home," with characteristic
Yankee ingenuity, has solved the

transportation problem and will ap
pear in Assembly Hall tomorrow even
ing. Promptly at 8:15 the curtain
will rise on the Sword and Sandal?
production of Tarkington and Wilson's
great comedy-drama which has scored
a phenomenal triumph in New York
and Chicago. This play has until this
year never been produced on (he Coast.
This is the first time that it has ever
been released for amateur production,
and it was only through a personal
favor from the authors that the local
thespians were given the right to pre
sent, it.
"The Man From Home" is probably
the most ambitious piecc that has
ever been attempted at Stanford, and
no possible detail has been overlooked
that would add to (he effectiveness of
the production. Coach F. L. Mathieu

who has pre-eminently demonstrated
his ability to direct a finished produc
tion has had charge of the prepara
tions for the play and has devoted un
limited time and attention to perfect
ing the work of the cast. New scenery
has been secured from (J. E. Lyon in
San Francisco and will be used in
three of the acts. One drop will pic
ture the Hay of Sorrento while another
scene will depict the hills back of the
picturesque Italian town of Sorrento.
Unusually extensive properties are
demanded by the production, and these
have been carefully provided with
the exception of a real automobile
which fell under the imperial ban.
To insure an adequate interpreta
tion of the piece one of the members of
the cast journeyed to New York during
the Christmas recess and attended
three performances given by the orig
inal company. Opportunity was also
secured to meet William Hodge, the
leading man, and many valuable sug
gestions were obtained from him,
which have been utilized in preparing
the local performance.
While "The Man From Home" lacks
the emotionalism which characterized
"The Road to Yesterday,"it has an
unusually absorbing plot and contains
many powerful dramatic situations.
The characters are drawn in masterly
fashion and interest never lags from
the first moment until the curtain goes
down on the last act. The scene is
laid in the Italian village of Sorrento
where Lord Hawcastle and his party
are staying. The attempt of the un
scrupulous Earl to marry his son to
Ethel, the American heiress, and thus
secure her fortune furnishs the motive
of the play. Thr> whole plot centers
about. Pike, who, as Ethel's guardian,
interferes with the Earl's designs.
The title role, Daniel Voorhees Pike,
of Kokomo, Indiana, "The Man From
Home" will be assumed by W. P. Ful
ler Jr.. '10. Pike is a typical Indianan,
somewhat crude and indifferent as to
the customs of "polite" society but
possessing true Yankee shrewdness
and ingenuity. He carries with him
into every situation his peculiar man
nerisms and his conversation is mark
ed at. all times with the real middle
west twang and humor. Fuller has
made a critical study of this part and
