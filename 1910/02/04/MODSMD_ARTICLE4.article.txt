# “THE MAN FROM HOME" SATURDAY
## Sword and Sandals to Produce Drama In Assembly Hall With Strong Cast and Incomparable Mounting. BY E.M. LEAF. 
### 
Despite the fact that he has been
denied the use of an automobile and
has, perforce, been compelled to re
sort. to a more plebian vehiehle, "The
Man From Home," with characteristic
Yankee ingenuity, has solved the

transportation problem and will ap
pear in Assembly Hall tomorrow even
ing. Promptly at 8:15 the curtain
will rise on the Sword and Sandal?
production of Tarkington and Wilson's
great comedy-drama which has scored
a phenomenal triumph in New York
and Chicago. This play has until this
year never been produced on (he Coast.
This is the first time that it has ever
been released for amateur production,
and it was only through a personal
favor from the authors that the local
thespians were given the right to pre
sent, it.
"The Man From Home" is probably
the most ambitious piecc that has
ever been attempted at Stanford, and
no possible detail has been overlooked
that would add to (he effectiveness of
the production. Coach F. L. Mathieu

who has pre-eminently demonstrated
his ability to direct a finished produc
tion has had charge of the prepara
tions for the play and has devoted un
limited time and attention to perfect
ing the work of the cast. New scenery
has been secured from (J. E. Lyon in
San Francisco and will be used in
three of the acts. One drop will pic
ture the Hay of Sorrento while another
scene will depict the hills back of the
picturesque Italian town of Sorrento.
Unusually extensive properties are
demanded by the production, and these
have been carefully provided with
the exception of a real automobile
which fell under the imperial ban.
To insure an adequate interpreta
tion of the piece one of the members of
the cast journeyed to New York during
the Christmas recess and attended
three performances given by the orig
inal company. Opportunity was also
secured to meet William Hodge, the
leading man, and many valuable sug
gestions were obtained from him,
which have been utilized in preparing
the local performance.
While "The Man From Home" lacks
the emotionalism which characterized
"The Road to Yesterday,"it has an
unusually absorbing plot and contains
many powerful dramatic situations.
The characters are drawn in masterly
fashion and interest never lags from
the first moment until the curtain goes
down on the last act. The scene is
laid in the Italian village of Sorrento
where Lord Hawcastle and his party
are staying. The attempt of the un
scrupulous Earl to marry his son to
Ethel, the American heiress, and thus
secure her fortune furnishs the motive
of the play. Thr> whole plot centers
about. Pike, who, as Ethel's guardian,
interferes with the Earl's designs.
The title role, Daniel Voorhees Pike,
of Kokomo, Indiana, "The Man From
Home" will be assumed by W. P. Ful
ler Jr.. '10. Pike is a typical Indianan,
somewhat crude and indifferent as to
the customs of "polite" society but
possessing true Yankee shrewdness
and ingenuity. He carries with him
into every situation his peculiar man
nerisms and his conversation is mark
ed at. all times with the real middle
west twang and humor. Fuller has
made a critical study of this part and

from his previous dramatic experience
is well qualified to undertake this dif
ticult character, upon the interpreta
tion of which the entire success of the
production depends. Fuller has ap
peared to advantage in"The Manoeu
vres of Jane," "The Butterfly Isle,'
"Twelfth Night" and other local pro
ductions in the last three years.
G. F. Morgan, '10, will he seen as the
Hon. Almeric St. Aubyn, son of the
Earl of Hawcastle, a foppish, egotis
tical and brainless specimen of the
English nobility. Morgan needs no in
troduction to the Stanford public as he
has been seen in practically every
production in the last two years and
can be depended upon to adequately
interpret any role which he may as
sume.
The character of the Earl of Haw
castle, a typical penniless fortune
hunting nobleman will be assumed by
R. Woodville, '11. Woodville made his
first appearance in his Sophomore
comedy, "7-20-8," and since that time
has taken roles in other productions,
including "In Tangiers," "The Liars"
and "Twelfth Night."
Miss M. L. Ozier, who scored so
pronounced a success in the role of
Elspeth in"The Road to Yesterday"
will appear as Ethel Granger-Simpson,
the American heiress. Miss Ozier has
taken a prominent part in Stanford
dramatics, having appeared in "Twelfth
Night," "The Liars" and other pieces.
Her acting has a finished quality rare
ly found in an amatuer. The Comtesse
de Champigny will be played by Miss
M. T. Howell who also holds a formost
position among the local thespians.
Miss Howell's acting in "His Excell
ency the Governor," "In Tangiers" and
"The Road to Yesterday" will be re
membered for its unusual excellence,
and her appearance tomorrow evening
assures a finished presentation of the
adventuresome countess. Miss M. E.
Wilson , '11. has been given the part of
Lady Creech, the designing sister of
Lord Hawcastle. Miss Wilson's dra
matic successes have been many since
she has been at Stanford. She has
appeared in nearly all the productions
of the past two years and is particu
larly well qualified from her exper
ience to undertake the role of Lady
Creech.
M. W. Strong, '11, will be seen as
Horace, Ethel's brother. While this is
his first appearance on the Stanford
stage he has already demonstrated his
ability 1o successfully assume the part
of the young American.
The Grand Duke Vasili will be
played by P. F. Pettigrew, '10, who will
be remembered for his effective acting
in"The Chimes of Normandy" and"In
Tangiers."
T. A. Deßolt who has taken roles in
many shows during the past, three
years has the part of Tvanoff, the Rus
sian convict. His work in this diffi- j
cult character will be one of the pletis
ant surprises of the evening.
Of the remaining roles, G. Gassaway,
'12, will be Ihe Ribiere, A. L. .Tacobi.
'11, the Mariano and B. TT. Laskv, '12
ihe Michele. W. E. Dunn, '09, and L.

Miss M. L. Ozier, who scored so
pronounced a success in the role of
Elspeth in"The Road to Yesterday"
will appear as Ethel Granger-Simpson,
the American heiress. Miss Ozier has
taken a prominent part in Stanford
dramatics, having appeared in "Twelfth
Night," "The Liars" and other pieces.
Her acting has a finished quality rare
ly found in an amatuer. The Comtesse
de Champigny will be played by Miss
M. T. Howell who also holds a formost
position among the local thespians.
Miss Howell's acting in "His Excell
ency the Governor," "In Tangiers" and
"The Road to Yesterday" will be re
membered for its unusual excellence,
and her appearance tomorrow evening
assures a finished presentation of the
adventuresome countess. Miss M. E.
Wilson , '11. has been given the part of
Lady Creech, the designing sister of
Lord Hawcastle. Miss Wilson's dra
matic successes have been many since
she has been at Stanford. She has
appeared in nearly all the productions
of the past two years and is particu
larly well qualified from her exper
ience to undertake the role of Lady
Creech.
M. W. Strong, '11, will be seen as
Horace, Ethel's brother. While this is
his first appearance on the Stanford
stage he has already demonstrated his
ability 1o successfully assume the part
of the young American.
The Grand Duke Vasili will be
played by P. F. Pettigrew, '10, who will
be remembered for his effective acting
in"The Chimes of Normandy" and"In
Tangiers."
T. A. Deßolt who has taken roles in
many shows during the past, three
years has the part of Tvanoff, the Rus
sian convict. His work in this diffi- j
cult character will be one of the pletis
ant surprises of the evening.
Of the remaining roles, G. Gassaway,
'12, will be Ihe Ribiere, A. L. .Tacobi.
'11, the Mariano and B. TT. Laskv, '12

W. S. Wilson. '13.
Despite the fact that he has been
denied the use of an automobile and
has, perforce, been compelled to re

production of Tarkington and Wilson's
great comedy-drama which has scored
a phenomenal triumph in New York
and Chicago. This play has until this
year never been produced on (he Coast.
This is the first time that it has ever
been released for amateur production,
and it was only through a personal
favor from the authors that the local
thespians were given the right to pre
sent, it.
"The Man From Home" is probably
the most ambitious piecc that has
ever been attempted at Stanford, and
no possible detail has been overlooked
that would add to (he effectiveness of
the production. Coach F. L. Mathieu

who has pre-eminently demonstrated
his ability to direct a finished produc
tion has had charge of the prepara
tions for the play and has devoted un
limited time and attention to perfect
ing the work of the cast. New scenery
has been secured from (J. E. Lyon in
San Francisco and will be used in
three of the acts. One drop will pic
ture the Hay of Sorrento while another
scene will depict the hills back of the
picturesque Italian town of Sorrento.
Unusually extensive properties are
demanded by the production, and these
have been carefully provided with
the exception of a real automobile
which fell under the imperial ban.
To insure an adequate interpreta
tion of the piece one of the members of
the cast journeyed to New York during
the Christmas recess and attended
three performances given by the orig
inal company. Opportunity was also
secured to meet William Hodge, the
leading man, and many valuable sug
gestions were obtained from him,
which have been utilized in preparing
the local performance.
While "The Man From Home" lacks
the emotionalism which characterized
"The Road to Yesterday,"it has an
unusually absorbing plot and contains
many powerful dramatic situations.
The characters are drawn in masterly
fashion and interest never lags from
the first moment until the curtain goes
down on the last act. The scene is
laid in the Italian village of Sorrento
where Lord Hawcastle and his party
are staying. The attempt of the un
scrupulous Earl to marry his son to
Ethel, the American heiress, and thus
secure her fortune furnishs the motive
of the play. Thr> whole plot centers
about. Pike, who, as Ethel's guardian,
interferes with the Earl's designs.
The title role, Daniel Voorhees Pike,
of Kokomo, Indiana, "The Man From
Home" will be assumed by W. P. Ful
ler Jr.. '10. Pike is a typical Indianan,
somewhat crude and indifferent as to
the customs of "polite" society but
possessing true Yankee shrewdness
and ingenuity. He carries with him
into every situation his peculiar man
nerisms and his conversation is mark
ed at. all times with the real middle
west twang and humor. Fuller has
made a critical study of this part and

from his previous dramatic experience
is well qualified to undertake this dif
ticult character, upon the interpreta
tion of which the entire success of the
production depends. Fuller has ap
peared to advantage in"The Manoeu
vres of Jane," "The Butterfly Isle,'
"Twelfth Night" and other local pro
ductions in the last three years.
G. F. Morgan, '10, will he seen as the
Hon. Almeric St. Aubyn, son of the
Earl of Hawcastle, a foppish, egotis
tical and brainless specimen of the
English nobility. Morgan needs no in
troduction to the Stanford public as he
has been seen in practically every
production in the last two years and
can be depended upon to adequately
interpret any role which he may as
sume.
The character of the Earl of Haw
castle, a typical penniless fortune
hunting nobleman will be assumed by
R. Woodville, '11. Woodville made his
first appearance in his Sophomore
comedy, "7-20-8," and since that time
has taken roles in other productions,
including "In Tangiers," "The Liars"

"The Road to Yesterday,"it has an
unusually absorbing plot and contains
many powerful dramatic situations.
The characters are drawn in masterly
fashion and interest never lags from
the first moment until the curtain goes
down on the last act. The scene is
laid in the Italian village of Sorrento
where Lord Hawcastle and his party
are staying. The attempt of the un
scrupulous Earl to marry his son to
Ethel, the American heiress, and thus
secure her fortune furnishs the motive
of the play. Thr> whole plot centers
about. Pike, who, as Ethel's guardian,
interferes with the Earl's designs.
The title role, Daniel Voorhees Pike,
of Kokomo, Indiana, "The Man From
Home" will be assumed by W. P. Ful
ler Jr.. '10. Pike is a typical Indianan,
somewhat crude and indifferent as to
the customs of "polite" society but
possessing true Yankee shrewdness
and ingenuity. He carries with him
into every situation his peculiar man
nerisms and his conversation is mark
ed at. all times with the real middle
west twang and humor. Fuller has
made a critical study of this part and

from his previous dramatic experience
is well qualified to undertake this dif
ticult character, upon the interpreta
tion of which the entire success of the
production depends. Fuller has ap
peared to advantage in"The Manoeu
vres of Jane," "The Butterfly Isle,'
"Twelfth Night" and other local pro
ductions in the last three years.
G. F. Morgan, '10, will he seen as the
Hon. Almeric St. Aubyn, son of the
Earl of Hawcastle, a foppish, egotis
tical and brainless specimen of the
English nobility. Morgan needs no in
troduction to the Stanford public as he
has been seen in practically every
production in the last two years and
can be depended upon to adequately
interpret any role which he may as
sume.
The character of the Earl of Haw
castle, a typical penniless fortune
hunting nobleman will be assumed by
R. Woodville, '11. Woodville made his
first appearance in his Sophomore
comedy, "7-20-8," and since that time
has taken roles in other productions,
including "In Tangiers," "The Liars"
and "Twelfth Night."
Miss M. L. Ozier, who scored so
pronounced a success in the role of
Elspeth in"The Road to Yesterday"
will appear as Ethel Granger-Simpson,
the American heiress. Miss Ozier has
taken a prominent part in Stanford
dramatics, having appeared in "Twelfth
Night," "The Liars" and other pieces.
Her acting has a finished quality rare
ly found in an amatuer. The Comtesse
de Champigny will be played by Miss
M. T. Howell who also holds a formost
position among the local thespians.
Miss Howell's acting in "His Excell
ency the Governor," "In Tangiers" and
"The Road to Yesterday" will be re
membered for its unusual excellence,
and her appearance tomorrow evening
assures a finished presentation of the
adventuresome countess. Miss M. E.
Wilson , '11. has been given the part of
Lady Creech, the designing sister of
Lord Hawcastle. Miss Wilson's dra
matic successes have been many since
she has been at Stanford. She has
appeared in nearly all the productions
of the past two years and is particu
larly well qualified from her exper
ience to undertake the role of Lady
Creech.
M. W. Strong, '11, will be seen as
Horace, Ethel's brother. While this is
his first appearance on the Stanford
stage he has already demonstrated his
ability 1o successfully assume the part
of the young American.
The Grand Duke Vasili will be
played by P. F. Pettigrew, '10, who will
be remembered for his effective acting
in"The Chimes of Normandy" and"In
Tangiers."
T. A. Deßolt who has taken roles in
many shows during the past, three
years has the part of Tvanoff, the Rus
sian convict. His work in this diffi- j
cult character will be one of the pletis
ant surprises of the evening.
Of the remaining roles, G. Gassaway,
'12, will be Ihe Ribiere, A. L. .Tacobi.

W. S. Wilson. '13.
Despite the fact that he has been
denied the use of an automobile and
has, perforce, been compelled to re
sort. to a more plebian vehiehle, "The
Man From Home," with characteristic
Yankee ingenuity, has solved the

transportation problem and will ap

production of Tarkington and Wilson's
great comedy-drama which has scored
a phenomenal triumph in New York
and Chicago. This play has until this
year never been produced on (he Coast.
This is the first time that it has ever
been released for amateur production,
and it was only through a personal
favor from the authors that the local
thespians were given the right to pre
sent, it.
"The Man From Home" is probably
the most ambitious piecc that has
ever been attempted at Stanford, and
no possible detail has been overlooked
that would add to (he effectiveness of
the production. Coach F. L. Mathieu

who has pre-eminently demonstrated
his ability to direct a finished produc
tion has had charge of the prepara
tions for the play and has devoted un
limited time and attention to perfect
ing the work of the cast. New scenery
has been secured from (J. E. Lyon in
San Francisco and will be used in
three of the acts. One drop will pic
ture the Hay of Sorrento while another
scene will depict the hills back of the
picturesque Italian town of Sorrento.
Unusually extensive properties are
demanded by the production, and these
have been carefully provided with
the exception of a real automobile
which fell under the imperial ban.
To insure an adequate interpreta
tion of the piece one of the members of
the cast journeyed to New York during
the Christmas recess and attended
three performances given by the orig
inal company. Opportunity was also
secured to meet William Hodge, the
leading man, and many valuable sug
gestions were obtained from him,
which have been utilized in preparing
the local performance.
