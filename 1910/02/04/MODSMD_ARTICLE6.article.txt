# WILL MEET ST. MARY'S
## CARDINAL AND PHOENIX NINES TO PLAY IN OAKLAND. McFadden Unable to Accompany Team. Wilcox To Pitch For Collegians. 
### 
The second game between the St.
Mary's and the Cardinal nines is to
take place on the St. Mary's diamond
in Oakland tomorrow afternoon at
2:15. With several important changes
in their line-up the Phoenix team feels
confident that they can wipe out their
defeat of last Saturday. "Chuck"
Wilcox, one of last season's prize
pitchers is to be in the box for the
Oaklanders at the beginning of the
game, and it is proposed to relieve him
after a few innings by putting in Ross,
the star southpaw of the Phoenix team.
The Stanford team will suffer from
the loss of McFadden, who has been so
effective with the stick this season, as
he will be unable to go on the trip.
Mow Mitchell will be in the box again
tomorrow. About nine extra men are
to accompany the team in order that
the policy of trying out several men
for each of the positions may be fol
lowed again tomorrow.
