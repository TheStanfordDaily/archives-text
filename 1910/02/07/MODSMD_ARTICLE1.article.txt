# MAN FROM ROME WINS
## SWORD AND SANDLES PRESENTS FINISHED PRODUCTION. Professor Seward's Review Gives High Praise To Acting of Players In Tarkington Drama. 
### 
The following 1 review of "The Man
From Home," which Professor Seward
several days ago consented to write
for the Daily Palo Alto, is reprinted
from 1 lie author's manuscript without
any change whatsoever.
HY S, S. SEWARD, .IH.
However skeptical we may have
been on hearing the advance notices
of "The Man From Home," we of the
audience came, saw, and were con
vinced, and to write of it now is not
so much an attempt at criticism as
pleasant act of acknowledgment. But
a responsive audience makes itself felt
the other side of the footlights, and I
fancy that the actors need no other
sign of appreciation than the absorbed
silence of the house, in which no tell
ing line, no matter how quietly spoken,
was lost. Yet out of the pleasure of
the actual performance rise certain
definite impressions, and these it may
be appropriate to express.
It is indeed a noteworthy thing that
only as we pause to consider do we
realize how good the performance
really was. In the general excellence
of the whole we might, for example,
easily overlook the difficulty of the
part of Ivanoff, and fail to appre
ciate the convincing quality of voice
with which Mr. De Dolt depicted the
broken, unnerved pleadings of the
escaped convict. And we might also
fail to notice the smoothness and pre
cision of the stage business, in which
was to be detected the practiced hand
of Mr. Mathieu.
Specially noteworthy was the finish
of the performance in small but im
portant details. One of the last
points that the amateur actor masters
is the art of listening while the other
person talks. Miss Ozier's role was
particularly exacting in this regard,
and the way in which she met the re
quirements of her part was the more
admirable because so difficult. But
this "passive acting" was carried 10
its highest success in Mr. Fuller's
latest scenes, wherein he showed the
subtlest mastery of his part. The com
bined strength and subtlety of Mr. Ful
ler's acting was indeed throughout ■»
notable achievement. Probably no
Stanford audience has seen so ambit
ious a role sustained with such even,
finished skill. It, took courage to rely
wholly on subtly quiet ways of making
bis lines tell, and without the most
skilful use of voice Mr. Fuller's suc
cess would have been impossible.
Scarcely less satisfying in its way
was Miss Ozier's acting as Miss Ethel
Granger-Simpsor\ She was handi
capped at first by the nature of her
part, but the charm she threw into her
business triumphed over this, and
when her opportunity came later she
displayed most happily the reverse
power she had saved for her best
scene. Miss Howell, as the Countess,
succeeded admirably in infusing a for
eign flavor into her acting, and rose
well to her climax scene with Ivanoff.
Lady Creech was a difficult role, and
Miss Wilson, though inclined to overdo
the chaperon's agitation, carried her
part with spirit and vivacity.
Of the men not already mentioned,
Mr. Pettigrew did perhaps the most
evenly satisfying work in the role of
the genial and generous Russian. In
spite of the constant invitation to
burlesque in the lines of the Honorable
Almeric, Mr. Morgan kept for the
most part within the bounds of legiti
mate acting, yet brought out fully the
comedy in his speeches. Mr. Wood
ville's Earl was done with poise and
adequate force, though imperfect
phrasing gave a somewhat artificial ef
fect to some of his earlier scenes. The
other roles were well sustained, with
occasionally some admirable bits of
character acting.
Of the staging too much apprecia
tion can hardly be expressed. The
spontaneous applause that greeted
Ihe rise of the curtain on the third
act testified clearly as to that. And
the admirable work of the orchestra
should be especially mentioned, as
contributing to the pleasure of the
evening.
Perhaps mention of the curtain does
not come within the scope of this re
view. but to speak appreciation of the
dignified, rich beauty of the gift is too
much of a pleasure to be missed.
Stanford audiences will long be grate
ful to Sword and Sandals for this
latest contribution to dramatic inter
ests in the university, but in the first
surprise of seeing the unexpected
gift, ours was a special and peculiar
privilege.
