# Palace Hotel Makes Student Rate.
## 
### 
The management of the Palace Hotel
in San Francisco, has evidently de
cided to make a bid for the large Stan
ford patronage which the hostelry
enjoyed in the days before the fire,
when the old Palace was the head
quarters of Stanford men. Tn writing
to D. W. Burbank, Manager Rich
promises a reasonable rate to stu
dents.
