# Illlinois Protests Prematurely.

### 
According to "Dad" Moulton, the
protesting by Illinois of the eligibility
of Horton, Crawford and Miller for
the Conference Meet at Chicago was
merely a case "of yelling before be
ing hurt."
"We had no intention of entering
those three men," said Moulton. "It
is Dr. Angell who decides the eligi
bility of a Stanford athlete, and we all
know that if he allows an ineligible
man to compete, it will be after he is
dead."
