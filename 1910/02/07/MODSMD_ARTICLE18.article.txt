### 
R. J. Miller, '11, prominent debator
and orator, was rendered unconcious
by an unfortunate accident at Encina
Gymnasium this morning. For a time
it was thought that the accident might
interfere with the Carnot debate in
which Miller is to take part, and which
is to be held at California next Satur
day evening. It is certain now that
this will not in any way effect the
debate as Miller was well on the road
to recovery this afternoon.
