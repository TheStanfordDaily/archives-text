# EPIDEMIC OF MEASLES THREATENED
## Four Encina Men and Two Residents of 19 Lasuen Are Now Under Quarantine.â€” Dr. Williams Pessimistic. 
### 
A possible epidemic of measles
served to scare the campus over the
week-end, five known cases of the
disease having been reported at noon
today. Two of the patients R. R.
Rowatt, '12, and E. A. Butler, '13, are
confined in their rooms at 19 Lasuen,
while the other three men C. C. Mar
chant, '10, C. F. Van Dyke, '12, and
E. A. Smallpage, '09, are isolated in a
remote part of Encina Hall directly
above the clubroom. Although much
excitement and anxiety was caused the
other residents of Encina by tho
quarantine of the sufferers there, it is
not likely that any cases will result
from the situation of the temporary
hospital, as the disease is only trans
mittable through close association or
personal contact.
All of the present cases of the dis
ease are supposed to be directly trace
able to infection from Rowatt and as
the latter has been quarantined for the
past two weeks all persons directly in
fected by him would have shown symp
toms of the malady by this time. Ac
cording to Dr. Williams there is no
certainty that the spread of the dis
ease will be confined to those persons
now suffering, as Van Dyke was only
quarantined yesterday and prior to
that time may have transmitted the
disease to a great many persons.
The Guild Association has taken
complete charge of the situation and at
a meeting held this morning decided
on its action in the event that new

| cases arise. All persons suffering
i from measles will be quarantined in
j their rooms and a portion of Encina
will not be made a detention hospital.
Measles Scare Increases.
Another case of measles was dis
covered in Encina late this afternoon,
' making the fourth person living in the
| big dormitory who is now suffering
from the disease. The patient, W. P.
Green, '11, rooming at. 94, Encina, was
immediately quarantined in his quar
; ters and placed under the care of a
trained nurse.
When seen this afternoon Dr. Wil
liams stated that he would not be sur
! prised to see several more cases de
velop in the next day or so, as a
I great many people have been exposed
!to the disease. The danger of infec
; tion is not so great at Encina or other
j places where students room as at the
boarding houses where they come into
I very close personal contact. As it
| is now, there is no reason for not at
j tending classes on account of fearing
to contract measles, as in the present
case one person is as dangerous as
another, for there is no means of fore
telling who has come into contact
with persons suffering from the dis
ease before they were placed in quar
antine. In conclusion, Dr. Williams
says that it seems to him like the only
I fellows it is safe for the women to al
low to "Queen" them now are resi
dents of the row.
