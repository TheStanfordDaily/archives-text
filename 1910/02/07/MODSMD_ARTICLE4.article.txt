# Dance To Be Held In Armory.
## 
### 
The Armory in Palo Alto has been
chosen as the place In which to hold
the Skull and Snakes dance instead of
at the Play-House, as was first plan
ned. This will more than double the
floor space and will make the dancing
far more pleasent than it would have
been in the smaller hall. The Skull
and Snakes dance is proving itself

exceedingly popular and more people
will now be given the opoprtunity co
attend.
