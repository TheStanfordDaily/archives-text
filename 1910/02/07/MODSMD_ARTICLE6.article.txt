## ST. MARY'S CAPTURES SECOND GAME WITH VARSITY. Phoenix Uses A-1 Battery and Is 10-1 Victor At End of Contest.—Cardinals Make Errors. 
### 
The Cardinal varsity couldn't un
tangle the kinks in the ball as served
11 ]> the St. Mary's best article in
the battery line, Wilcox and Simpson,
and lost to the Phoenix College at
| Oakland, Saturday, 10-1. Stanford
' came very near to a shut-out, since it
was only in the ninth chapter that the
home team was able to secure a round
trip ticket for a man to the home
station, and he started on his journey
on the only error in the opposing
nine's column. The inability to find
the combination in Wilcox's delivery,
coupled with poor base-running and a
bad succession of errors made up the
one-sided contest. St. Mary's nia'le
I several large dents in the horticultur
| al region. A home run by the man with
i the toe-plate, two three baggers, a
double sacker, and three singles at
opportune times were gleaned from
M. Mitchell, who was on the mound
for the Varsity. S. Mitchell injured
one of the fingers of his receiving
hand in the middle of the game, and
that, was partly responsible for a
weakening in the line. Stanford had a
particularly bright outlook in the
opening session, and it looked as
though a tally was practically certain.
The Varsity had succeeded in getting
I a full house, three men having resi
dences on first, second and the intri
cate corner. But Wilcox tightened up
like a clam and the chapter ended m
quick order. St. Mary's had been
badly frightened by this near-scoring
exhibition put up by the Cardinal bat
tle front, and they immediately came
out on the double quick. With seven
"at bats," a triple and a single, Phoe
nix soared up to a safe place at the
top of the ladder with three runs. U
must be recorded that the outfield
ground much resembled the bad lands.
Harmless little singles often carromed
on a six-inch hump in the turf and
acquired the alarming proportions (if
atriple-plated bingle, and fattened
the batting reputation of several St.
Mary's men.
Stanford's only run was squeezed in.
in the primary half of the ninth. Bee
ger, first up, was looked upon kindly
by the tall short -stop, Fitzsimmons,
who promptly made the only error for
his team, and passed the Cardinal
center-fielder to the initial sack.
Prom there Beeger settled in the in
tricate corner on Ball's left flank
bingle, and tapped the rubber flatiron
at home with Jordan's sacrifice as a
vehicle. This made up the total, 10-1.
Wilcox's beautiful homer hoodooed
right garden in the seventh. Although
the relay in from the brush was per
fect, yet Wilcox had heen going like
an express train and he had easily
twenty-five feet to spare before the
horse-hide settled in Mitchell's glove
at the platter.
