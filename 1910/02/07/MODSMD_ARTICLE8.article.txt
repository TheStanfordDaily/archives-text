Stanford's lack of an isolation hos- j
pital for the care of patients suffering i
from a contagious disease is becom- i
ing alarmingly serious. Cases of meas- |
les are being constantly reported, and |
we may soon be in the grip of a real
epidemic. Palo Alto rightfully re
fuses to accept patients from the
campus, and the Board of Trustees
has failed to provide adequately or
sensibly for such patients. Conse
quently, a few instances of the disease
may put the whole Hall under quaran
tine, and not many more would be
needed to isolate the entire univer
sity. What an unnecessary and
troublesome proceeding to suspend
the college schedule should that be
come advisable, when a little fore
thought on the part of the authorities
would have changed the now serious
situation into an unimportant, though
unfortunate, incident.
Mrs. Stanford wished no isolation
camps near the university, yet what
will Encina be if the disease continues
to spread ? A place for the proper
care of campus residents with con
tagious diseases is a necessity. Sena
tor Stanford said, "The children of
California are my children." Surely,
he did not mean only when well and
healthy.
