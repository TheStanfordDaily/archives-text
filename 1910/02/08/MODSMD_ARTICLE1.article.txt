## LATHROP OFFERS COTTAGE IN SAN MATEO COUNTY. Permission of Officials Necessary.- Plan To Aid Stanford Union.â€” Hine and Malone Chosen. 
### 
The solution of the problems arising
out of the present measles epidemic
on the campus was the principal mat
ter of business coming before the
University Conference at its meeting
tiiis afternoon and definite steps were
taken toward their solution. The
power to confer with the Guild Board
and the Committee on Public Health
and in co-operation with them to bring
the matter before the proper officials
was delegated by the Conference to
the Student Advisory Committee. This
committee will begin action at once
and endeavor to secure a permanent
solution of the entire question of iso
lation of contagious diseases.
A temporary amelioration of the
present grave state of affairs has been
offered by Treasurer Lathrop who has
offered the use of the Cedro Cottage,
property belonging to him in San
Mateo County, for the use of measles
patients, if the San Mateo County of
ficials will grant the necessary per
mission.
Tt was the expressed wish of the
Conference that the student body as a
whole should more fully understand
the relation of the Guild Board to the
students and to the Peninsula Hospi
tal, and toward this end President S
A. Lindauer, '10, appointed a com
mittee composed of T. B. Hine, chair
man, A. F. Meston, '10, and E. H. Stal
er, '10, to confer with the Guild Board
and render a full report.
When interviewed this afternoon,
Dr. T. 11. Williams said that it would
be from nine days to two weeks be
fore the campus would know whether
it is past the danger of a serious
epidemic or whether in the throes of
continued illness. He reported the
patients in the Hall as doing nicely,
and that. Marchant is the only one
who has been seriously ill. No new
cases have been reported today.
The matter of raising funds and in
creasing student interest in the Stan
ford Union was also discussed by the
Conference, and the lateness of the
hour only prevented definite action by
the body. It.was stated by Student
Body President J. E. Shelton that an
active campaign for funds was to be
inaugurated shortly by the committee
having the matter in charge and that
it was the duty of nil Stanford men to
get in and give the worthy undertak
ing all the support that it deserves.
It was the unanimous sentiment of
all those who spoke that the Confer
ence as a body surely considered
the Union as the one project which
should receive the united support of
all.
T. B. Hine, '10, and M. Y. Malone,
'10, were elected by the Conference to
fill the positions on the Student Ad
visory Committee left, vacant by the
failure of C. H. Hails, '10, and H. C.
Fisk, '09, to return to college. Tt was
also decided that owing to the lack of
a quorum in the recent election of p
representative from the English and
allied departments, that this election
be held attain. Such an election will
be held within a week.
