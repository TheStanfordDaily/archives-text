# DISLIKES DISCRIMINATION.
## "An Encina Man" Expresses Grave Dissatisfaction With Dr. William's Suggestion To Women. 
### 
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Not since the days "when knight
hood was in flower" has the faithful
gallant been handed, figuratively
speaking, such a lemon as was gratu
itously conveyed to him last evening
through the columns of your esteemed
publication, viz: "In conclusion, Dr.
Williams says that it seems to him
like the only fellows it is safe for the
women to allow to 'queen' them now
are residents of the row." Unques
tionably, this statement is calculated
to arouse the vengeful ire of all loyal
Encina men, whom the context would
indicate were specifically aimed at, to
spur the ancient "family skeleton" into
renewed activity, and, finally, from its
very nature, to unceremoniously cur
tail the anticipated pleasures of the
present season. Think of the countless
"dates" that must inevitably become
nullities ! Sir, we feel constrained
to enter a dignified protest to the wide
publicity accorded the aforesaid dis
criminatory statement. Not content
with making a provisional pest house
out of Encina, the learned health au
thorities would stigmatize its inof
fensive "queeners" as social pariahs.
Incidentally, and by inference, a de
cided reflection is cast, upon the "oc
casional offenders" from Palo Alto,
San Jose and other inland student
centers. They are completely ignored.
They receive a lemon, too, with in
terest. They are not even listed as
"also rans."
In conclusion, we urge the medicos
not, to invade the realms of "queening"
prerogatives. Let them confine then
attention to more serious matters. Let
the young ladies themselves deter
mine the eligibility of their admirers.
