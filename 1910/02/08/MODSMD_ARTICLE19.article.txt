# Y.M.C.A. STAG ON SATURDAY.
## Entertaining Program, Consisting of Many Musical Numbers, Provided By Christian Association. 
### 
Plenty to eat and an interesting
program is planned for the Y. M. C. \.
reception and "jolly-up" at Encina
next Saturday night. The conflict of
this date with the Carnot Debate was
unavoidable because of the late change
in the date of the Intercollegiate evenl.
The program will consist of eight
numbers. There will be a solo by P.
M. Jones, '13, who made a hit in the
recent Minstrel Show. The Mandolin
Club, under the direction of L. J. Hart,
'10, will render some popular selec
tions, while a quartet, consisting of
P. W. McNulty, '10, L. Y. Mattes, '09. R.
H. Brown, '10, and P. F. Pettigrew, '10,
have promised a song. H. B. Mc-
Guire, '13, remembered by his excel
lent singing in the Minstrel Show, will
sing a solo assisted by the quartet.
W. Wilson, '13, will feature a Hu
mantone solo, which he will follow by
a duet with E. E. Chase, '11. IT. A.
Lewis, '12, will render one of his
comic readings.
The performance will start sharply
at 7:30 and a cordial invitation is ex
tended to students of all classes and
the faculty to lie present.
