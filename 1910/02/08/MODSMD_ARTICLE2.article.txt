### 
The receipt of a letter from the
Boating Association of the University
of California yesterday by President
J. C. Huston, '10, of the Lagunita Boat
Club, concerning the possibility of
having an inter-club regatta this
spring, makes the holding of a number
of races probable. The California men
suggest an eight-oared shell race or :t
four-oared race, or both.
President L. McSpaden, of the Cali
fornia oarsmen, expresses the senti
ment of his club as follows: "We
should be pleased to co-operate with
you in any action which would be of
benefit to the sport."
In his reply last night President
Huston said that races between Senior
eights and Senior fours could be ar
ranged with the possibility of a race
between Junior fours. He suggested
that the course be about three miles in
length, and that the races should be
held on the Oakland Estuary or at
Sausalito towards the end of the
season.
This action means that, rowing will
be placed on a firmer basis at the two
universities. Inter-club rivalry will do
more than anything else to keep the
sport alive. Interest in aquatics is
increasing and the membership roll of
the Lagunita Club is growing rapidly.
In the event, that, suitable arrange
ments can be made with the San Diego
Club the winner of the Senior four
oared race will go south to row for the
State championship.
The large number of veteran oars
men turning out for practice daily at
the lake assures" the local club of a
strong Senior eight and four. Presi
dent Huston last, night was very opti
mistic over the possibility of winning
crews.
He also hopes to arrange several
races between the Junior fours of the
South End and Lagunita Club but
I nothing definite has been done as yet.
