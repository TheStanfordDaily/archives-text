# "DAD" SPEAKS A WORD
## TRAINER GOES TO THE ROOT OF TRACK SITUATION. In Personal Comment He Considers the Chances For a Team Worthy of Victory. 
### 
Trainer "Dad" Moulton has made
some very timely comments upon the
status of track, drawing his conclu
sions from the showing, more or less
good, made by early season trials held
on the oval last Saturday afternoon,
j lint, two months are left on the calen
dar in which "Dad" can find out the
quality of his embryonic team. He
says:
"The results of the trials on the
track Saturday last were satisfactory
in regard to those who came out, but
one-third of the men did not appear.
Hereafter all men must report unless
they are at home or are doing college
work. In that case they must report
the day before to Captain Scott or
Coach Moulton. Our time is short and
with bad weather and all we will have
to work regularly and hard to get into
shape. Our trials show that in the
100-yards only two men made 10.4.
One made it, in 11: the others in 11.1
and 11.2. So it will take some good
work to get down to 10.1 or 10.2. In
the 440, 880 and the 3-lap event
the trials were better in comparison.
No long distances were tired. On
track, the best work was done by Por
ter, Coleman, Lee, Millsap, King,
| Smitherum, Morrison, Snyder, Leaman,
Taylor, Andrews, and Scholefield. In
field events no special work or try
-outs were given. Horine is doing good
in the high jump. All the other men
did fairly well for the condition they
iwere in. But the full squad must get
lout and work from now on, and report
to the trainer on the track for special
work. The loss to the track of Roth,
Miller, Crawford, Hemphill, Bradford,
Rawles, Fletcher, Adams, Sweet, Mor
ris, McGregor, Worthington, Coonan,
of last year's team, and some others,
makes it hard to get a strong team to
gether unless everybody that can lends
a band. There are a good many men
signed up who have not come out.
This should not be so. No one out of
condition will be allowed to compete.
A meet is to be held next Saturday,
i when all must, come out and take part.
There are some men who intend to
sign up later on. Rut now is the time.
We want all men intending to help on
track to sign up this week."
