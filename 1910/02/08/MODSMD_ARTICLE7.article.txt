### 
I
J. W. Howell, of Los Angeles, was
! the sole nominee for the editorship of
jllie 1912 "Quad" at the Sophomore
] meeting today, while J. W. Doron, of
Jorona, and B. .T. O'Donnell. of San
Francisco, will contest the office of
manager. A contract, which had been
drawn up in committee, was consid
ered by the class. The agreement is
similar to that under which the 1011
' Quad" is being published and calls
'or a Hoard of Control, consisting of
five members to be appointed by the
president of the class.
Howell is an extremely well-known
underclassman. He is a member of

the Daily Palo Alto staff and he was
coxswain of his Freshman crew.
Should no other nominations he made
by Thursday afternoon, Howell will
lie unanimously chosen on Friday, at
which time the members of the class
will probably be called upon to ex
press their preference for the man
agership.
At the conclusion of the meeting
the collection books were distributed
to the different parties appointed by
Treasurer Enderle, and it is urged
that, all dues be paid as soon as possi
ble, as this is a prerequisite for voting,
in the "Quad" election.
