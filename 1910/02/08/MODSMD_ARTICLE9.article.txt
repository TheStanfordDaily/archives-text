# VARSITY vs. ST. MARY'S
## THIRD GAME WITH OAKLANDERS TO BE PLAYED TOMORROW. S. Mitchell Unable to Play.â€”Gilfillan to Pitch and Canterbury to Catch for Cardinals. 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon the third game
of the series between the Varsity nine
and the baseball artists from St.
Mary's is to be played. In the first of
the two games already played, the
Varsity came out the victor by a score
of 5-3, but in the second the Ooklaiul
ers wiped out this defeat by coming
out on the long end of a 10-1 score.
Although the entire line-up of the Car
dinal team has not yet been an
nounced, it is understood that there
will be several changes in the team.
Gilfillan is to be in the box for the
first, part of the game at least. On
account of an injured arm S. Mitchell
will lie unable to handle the receiv
ing end of the battery, and Cochran,
who has been alternating with him in
this position, is at present too ill to be
in the game. Canterbury, last year's
catcher who has been playing on third,
will therefore be behind the bat.
The St. Mary's line-up is to be prac
tically the same as last Saturday, al
though it is not yet known definitely
whether Leonard or Wilcox, who3e
benders proved so puzzling to the Var
sity team in the game Saturday, will
be in tlie box.
The game is to start at 4:15 on the
gymnasium field, and an admission of
2~) cents is to be charged.
Coach Presley is not yet. prepared to
announce the Cardinal team.
The St. Mary's team will line-up as
follows: Catcher, Simpson: pitchers,
Wilcox and Leonard; first, base, Fin
nigan; second base, Wilkenson; short
stop, Fitzsfimmons and Guigni; third
base, Wallace; left, field, Ross; center
field, Leonard; right field, Bonnetti.
