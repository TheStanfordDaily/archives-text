## GUILD SECURES PERMISSION TO REMOVE PATIENTS. Cedro Cottage Will Probably Be Used. S. Butler, '13, the Latest Victim of Disease. 
### 
A telegram received by Dr. Williams
this afternoon from the office of the
State Board of Health in Sacramento
authorizes the use of the Cedro Cot
tage as a detention hospital. Treas
urer Lathrop donated the use of the
cottage to the Guild, but as it is on the
west side of San Francisquito Creek
in San Mateo County the sanction of
the Health Board had to be obtained
before the patients could be trans
ferred across the county line. This
was made necessary by a State law
which prohibits the transfer of
patients having infectious diseases
from one county to another.
The Guild Board will investigate
the practicability of using the cottage
for the accomodation of the patients,
and until their inspection is complete
no arrangements can be made for the
removal of the students.
S. Griffith, '13, at 19 Lasuen, is the
latest addition to the list of sufferers
from measles. The symptoms of the
disease developed unmistakably in
Griffith this morning, and he was im
mediately placed in quarantine with
E. D. Butler, '13, at. the latters room.
According to the officials Griffith is
believed to have contracted the disease
from Butler with whom he associated
before the quarantine of the latter.
Although several persons around (lie
campus have complained of poor
health within the last few days and by
the free play of their h'gh imagina

that they ar"! victims oi' the epidemic,
