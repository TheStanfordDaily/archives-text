The matter of abolishing Freshman
Intercollegiate Rugby was brought be
fore the Executive Committee at its
last meeting aiul may again be called
to its attention in the future. The
Daily Palo Alto believes that the an
nual first-year contest should be re
tained. The objections, we under
stand, are three: first, that the schol
arship of participants is lowered; sec
ond, that the general playing of Rugby,
•which is so much desired, is inter
fered with by a Freshman season; and
third, that an intercollegiate event is
added to an already crowded calendar.
Actual statistics prove that, relative
ly speaking, the scholarship of Fresh
man players can not be criticized. The
first-year season brings out number
less men who otherwise would never
don a Rugby suit, and consequently
just so many more students, having
learned the game, are enabled to latp"
participate in inter-organization and
other similar contests. Lastly, would
the dropping of the Freshman game
have any appreciable effect upon the
alleged over-crowded calendar ? The
excitement attendant upon the match
is neither great nor long-continued.
Save for the few people directly and
personally interested, no undergradu
ate is discommoded further than to
actually attend the battle. Further
more, without arguing the point as to
whether or not the entire intercolleg
iate calendar is too lengthly, we are of
the firm opinion that during the lirst
semester the schedule is sufficiently
limited in scope. We feel that we
have met the objections offered, and we
would remind those who doubt the
efficacy of the institution that many a
football hero would probably never
have appeared on the field but for the
existence of an Intercollegiate Fresh
man game.
