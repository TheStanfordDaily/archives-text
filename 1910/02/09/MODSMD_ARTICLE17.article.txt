# MATHIEU IS RETAINED
## THE
						JUNIOR OPERA COMMITTEE CHOOSES COACH. Preliminary Tryouts For Men and Women's Choruses Will be Held Next Friday Afternoon. 
### 
In selecting Mr. Frank Mathieu, of
San Francisco, to conduct the Junior
Opera through its various vicissitudes
of development afe stage director, the
Junior Opera Committee has taken an
important step in the completion or tho
preliminary work attendant upon thd
production of the piece. Mr. Mathieu's
services have been retained by the
committee in accordance with a defi
nitely outlined plan that the board has
adopted for the development of the
opera, in reference to the question ot
the division between the stage and
musical coaching. The newly engaged
stage director will concentrate his
efforts upon the training of the prin
cipals in the cast in their stage work
alone, without reference to the musical
coaching that they are to receive.
The Junior Opera Committee is
specially fortunate in their ability to
retain Mr. Mathieu as a coach for the
coming opera. He has ably proved
his ability to manage the staging and
to develop a thoroughly finished type
of acting in a college production. The
quality of Mr. Mathieu's work has been
evidenced several times at Stanford
during the past year and a half. Under
Mr. Mathieu's care, the coming Junior
Opera promises to present a more
finished aspect than any play of its
kind that has been presented in the
past.
The names of several musical direc
tors are now being considered by the
Junior Opera Committee and they ex
pect within the next, few days to make
a final selection. The musical direct
or will have charge of the training of
the chorus and the presentation of the
musical numbers alone, as distinct
from any coaching from the view
point of the acting.
The committee announces that try
outs for members of the various chor
uses will begin next Friday afternoon
in the Chapel at a time to be an
nounced later. All those who intend
competing for places in the women's
or men's choruses are expected to re
port at that time. According to the
present plans of the committee, the
choruses this year will be larger and
more complete than any that have ap
peared in the Junior Operas heretofore

and for this reason there will be a
better chance for a successful try-out
for those who desire to appear in the
chorus of the opera and who show
ability.
