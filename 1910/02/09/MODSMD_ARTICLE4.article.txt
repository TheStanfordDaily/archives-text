# BRILLIANT SPEECH BY ROWELL
## Editor Gives Interesting Address on Vital Problems and Prospects of the Present Generation. 
### 
Chester H. Rowell, editor of the
Fresno "Republican" and President
of the Lincoln-Roosevelt. League, is an
Insurgent. He is not only a political
Insurgent, but also a social Insur
gent. When he appeared in Assembly
Hall this morning to deliver his speech
on "The University Man and Public
Service," the members of the audience
realized that they were gazing on one
of the most practical and consistent
political and social workers of the
Pacific Coast, but they were not aware
of the fact that Rowell was an out
and out Insurgent, a man who is not
satisfied, who is not in sympathy with
the causes of the old "stand patter,"
the old school of Republicanism or
Democracy.
When Rowell, in the midst of his
subject, declared that we were on the
edge of a new political era, a time
when some of our leading periodicals
and statesmen would vehemently state
that the Republican party is busted,
and the Democratic donkey is dead,
some of the conservative members of
the Student Body and Faculty took on
a cynical expression. Some of these
were thinking of the grand old parties,
some were wondering what a man who
was going to figure in the coming
campaign in California was thinking
of, when he gave vent to these opin
ions. Yet there were many who saw
the gleam in that remark and smiled.
The editor, however, believes that
the old poltical school which has
handled the reins of our nation for the
last few decades was inaugurated by
Abraham Lincoln, but culminated with
j the retirement of Mark Hanna, and
| frizzled out with Hitchcock, now Post
| master-General, but formerly cam
paign manager for William Howard
I Taft.
In bringing the context of his sub
ject before the assembly, Editor Ro
well, who after being introduced by
; Dr. D. Charles Gardner as a "con
i spieious example of his subject," com
! mented on the great magnitude this
world had grown to during the last few
generations. He enumerated how all
the elements of Nature had been con
quered by the boldness and assiduous
ness of man, and why it is now the
task, of this age' to facilitate these
captured phenomena. "We are on the
frontier, we have reached the end of
the old age," continually iterated the
editor.
In elucidating the phases of this

remark he proclaimed the veritable
conditions of this age were largely
commercial and mechanical; that the
life of women was not to be a purely
domestic one as in the past century; j
and that individualism as a criterion
of business was not passing away, but
had gone. Editor Howell believes that !
it is up to this century to advance the i
social and political standard as far as
our forefathers advanced the problems
of their period, so that we can be
termed progressive people by the fu-j
lure generation. He said that if we
do advance, no one can act. just as we
have; they will have to do different
things.
One of the features of his speech
was the interesting manner in which
lie dealt with our present vital factor
â€”civilization. Rowell stated that we
were on the brink of a new civilization
and one which will be shaped and pro
duced by the present American people.
It was at. this point of his talk that he
made a reference to the Republican
and Democratic parties, and concluded
by saying that he hoped the Republi
cans were busted and the Democrats
dead so that out. of the rubbish a new
political life can evolve. What names
were attached to the new faction, the
editor admitted he cared little.
"The Insurgent movement was de
fined by your venerable President,"
|continued Rowell. "He said it was due
to the influx of college men into poli
tics."
Editor Rowell's sense of practica
bility was exemplified when, in conclu
sion he spoke upon the benefits of a
college education, and how it was of
advantage to the student in the world.
He emphasized the fact, that we must
always remember that it is our prob
lem which is to be solved first. After
once we succeed in subduing our own
temptations, be believes we are ready
to commence on others. He paused
for a time in depicting what he thought
the educational institutions were doing.
"They are not. turning out men ex
actly fitted for the world," he said,
"but if they only instill judgment, so
that a man will know when he is
right and when he is wrong, an educa
tion will certainly be worth while."
In closing he warned the student
not to let the practical man injure his
ideals.
"Take his practical knowledge, buf
do not let. his contempt for ideals
make you desert them.
