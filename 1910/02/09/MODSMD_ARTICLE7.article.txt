Mr. John Z. While, of Chicago, who
has made a life study of political
science, delivered a very eloquent lec
ture last evening on Ihe subject of
"Direct Legislation." Mr. White made
(he statement that the people of tin-
United States are not and never have
been self-governing in the true sensn
of the word. He went on to show bow
popular vote, when given a fair trial,
had always shown settled, solid con
victions. and that government by a
part of the people had always failed.
Mr. White believes that the simples*,
(leanest, and best way to retain the

ideals so close to thp American heart,
is to place the power in the hands of
all the people by means of direct legis
lation.
