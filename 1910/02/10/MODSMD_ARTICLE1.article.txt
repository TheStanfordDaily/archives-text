# EXPOSE IS CONTINUED
## "SEQUOIA" PUBLISHES SECOND ACCUSATION. Monthly Magazine, Which Will Appeal Tomorrow Morning On the Quad, Is Interesting Throughout. 
### 
The much anticipated second issue
of the "Sequoia" will make its appear
ance tomorrow morning when Man
ager Thompson will place the maga
zine on sale upon the Quad. As has
been promised by the editor, the "Se
quoia" has followed up the matter oi
the treatment of the various honor
societies in college with reference tc
one class and has expanded upon the
stand already taken by the magazine
R. J. Miller, '11, again is the author
of the leading article, which is headed
"The Scaraboea Controversy." He
sets forth at length in this stage of Un
expose what the present position o!
the "Sequoia" is upon the question
and developes the stand of the maga
zine from an argumentative stand
point. The article exhaustively treats
with the position that the book as ;i
factor in Stanford has taken against
the organization that is being attacked
and then justifies the stand that the
"Sequoia" has assumed in this contro
versey. Miller explains fully the rea
sons for the editing of the original
article and justifies the motive of the
recent alleged exposures. He gives in
detail the position that the "Sequoia"
has claimed to have assumed in the
argument that, has arisen, and ex
plains fully the attitude that the maga
zine has taken in presenting this ma
terial to the Student Body.
This subject has also been chosen
by the editor for his leading editorial,
although this may be regarded as a
more sweepiug and condemnatory
writing than the article upon the first
page. The editor justifies the posi
tion of his periodical in regard to the
discussion that was started in his
magazine last month. At the same
time, the editor strongly condemns all
organizations that exist for the same
purpose as he alleges the Scaraboeas
do and also all those who attempt at
any time to defend the existence of
such societies.
The editor has been fortunate in
securing for this number some of the
best cuts that have ever been pub
lished in the "Sequoia." These are il
lustrations connected with the critical
advance review of the Sophomore
comedy, "Secret Service," which is
submitted by J. W. Howell, '12.
The sixth installment of the "Snap
shot Series," by G. F. Morgan, '10, ap
pears with a full delineation of the
faults and foibles of the University
"queener."
In the editorial division the maga
zine advocates stronglly the continu
ance of Senior singing and the reten
tion of the custom of holding Senior
smokers during the coming semester.
The editor also makes the announce
ment that Judge Ben B. Lindsey and
Senator Robert M. La Follette have
both promised to contribute articles
for publication in the "Sequoia"
The tardiness of the magazine is due
to the fact that the foreman or the
Palo Alto Times printing establish
ment was seriously ill and unable to
print the book.
The magazine will be on sale at the
regular price.
