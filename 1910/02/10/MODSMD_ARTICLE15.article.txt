Credit upon almost- any character
of merchandise may be still obtained
at less than reasonable prices from the
management of the 1910 "Quad."
Trade advertisements against firms
dealing in goods that range in descrip
tion from typewriters to clothing are
still available to those who desire to
secure unusual bargains in these var
ious commodities. These purchases
may be made from J. 15. Bubb, '10, who
is now in charge of ibis division of the
work connected with the final settle
ment of the finances of last year's
"Quad."
