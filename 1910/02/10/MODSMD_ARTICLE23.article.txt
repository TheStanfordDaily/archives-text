# SOCIETY ELECTS PETTIGREW.
## Talented Actor and Singer Is Chosen For Membership By Sword and Sandals. 
### 
The election to membership of P. F.
Pettigrew, MO, was the most impor
tant business transacted at the meet
ing of the Sword and Sandals Dramat
ic Society. By his work in the 1910
Junior opera, "In Tangiers," in the
Schubert Club's "Chimes of Nor
mandy," and in the recent production
of "The Man From Home," Pettigrew
has eminenetly qualified for member
ship in the organization.
Although no accurate figures are
obtainable so soon after the perfor
mance, it is evident that after paying
all expenses of the show and curtain,
a small amount will still remain in
the Sword and Sandals treasury.
