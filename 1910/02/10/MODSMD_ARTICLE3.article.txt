### 
Plans for the coming Junior Prom
are being rapidly developed into the
form in which they will be presented
on the evening of March 18. The var
ious features that are to make the
Prom distinctive have been considered
by the committee that has charge of
this event of the Junior Week and.it
the committee meeting last evening
these various innovations were thor
oughly developed in detail. Early
consideration of the original stunts
and ideas for the dance is necessary
upon the part of the committee to
make complete preparations indue
time on account of the extensive char
acter of the plans.
Fourteen dances will be placed upon
the program this year, in view of the
satisfaction that the same number
gave at the last Prom, There. will lie
two intermissions contained in this
number for the purpose of allowing
the supper dance to be held with the
greatest, possible convenience and
despatch. The first intermission will
occur between llie eighth and ninth
dances, while those who are to have
supper later in the evening, will eat
between the eleventh and twelfth
numbers. This will allow faster ser
vice than could otherwise be main
tained and according to the present
plans of the Committee, the supper
dances will be materially shortened
from what they were last year. Sup
per will lie served in Encina Hall this
year as this situation presents a more
convenient, and commodious place
for holding a supper dance than could
be obtained outside the Hall. Various
new ideas are to be incorporated in
the serving and the composition of the
supper, which promise to make the
dance distinctive in itself.
During the supper dances, extra
numbers will be provided for by the
orchestra and dancing may be engaged
iu by those who are not being served.
Special features are then promised
by the committee.

The Junior Prom committee again
wishes to announce that, it requests
that no carriages be used this year
in going to and from the Hall and that
no flowers be used during the dance.
The committee wishes to make this
emphatic for various obvious reasons
and they hope that those who attend
the Junior Prom this year will re
spect their request in the spirit in
which it. is asked.
