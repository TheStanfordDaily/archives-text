# POWER GIVEN BARRETT
## THE 						EXECUTIVE BODY EMPOWERS INTERCOLLEGIATE CHAIRMAN. Agreement Committee Can Be Called at Any Time in Future at Discretion of Chairman. 
### 
Because of the fact that the inter
collegiate Agreement Committee had
arrived at no definite decision in re
gard to eligibility of contestants from
California and Stanford, it was de
cided by the Executive Committee at
the meeting last evening to empower
Chairman Barrett to call a meeting of
the entire Committee at any time he
should see fit. AVith this power in his
hands it. seems that another meeting
of the committee will be called in the
near future, and the entire matter
arranged at the time. At present there
is no definite opinion among the mem
bers of the committee as to what the
final arrangements of the eligibility
clause will be.
Graduate Manager Burbank was in
structed by the Executive Committee
to investigate the terms upon which a
professional rubber could be secured
for the track men. It is thought that
the services of such a man, providing
that the salary to be paid was not
much higher than that now paid to the
regular rubbers, would be of enough
additional value to make up for what
ever little extra expense might be in
curred.
In order to obviate any trouble in
regard to rubbers such as may have
arisen in the past, it was decided to
pay the rubbers the regular rate of
fifty cents per hour, with the time
vouchers for the number or hours put
in, signed by the captain. In this way
it is believed that it will be impossible
for anyone to receive wages for work
but partly done.
The only other business transacted
was the voting of $100 to the Women's
Athletic Association to cover travel
ling and other expenses for prelim
inary and intercollegiate games. It
was further voted that all vouchers
for the expenses should be handled by
Graduate Manager Burbank.
