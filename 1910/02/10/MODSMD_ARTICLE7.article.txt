### 
Cedro Cottage, the site donated to
the Guild for a temporary detention
hospital, was inspected today by the
members ot' the oui 1(1 Board, accom
panied by Dr. Williams. According
to reports the cottage is admirably
situated for the purpose in view and
can easily be changed into a quaran
tine hospital. No decision will be
reached in the matter, however, until
the meeting of the Board tomorrow
morning when it is expected that, the
whole plan will lie definitely settled.
Apparently the epidemic of measles
is not to be as serious as was feared
when the appearance of the contagious
disease was first noted upon the camp

physicians today.
