# FIRST MEET SATURDAY
## ENTIRE SQUAD WILL CONTEST ON TRACK AND FIELD. Double Meet Will Be Held, Veterans and Novices Conpeting In Separate Events. 
### 
Everyone will be given a chance at
the early season meet tomorrow,
whether he be at the bottom of the
track ladder, or at the top. Novices of
mile run for the Varsity squad, will
ially, will be under the watchful eye
of Trainer "Dad" Moulton, who will
be ready and glad to discover any hid
den genius in the track line. Both the
trainer and Captain Scott emphasize
that all men should take part in the
trials tomorrow — everyone, unless
they are unable to enter the lists
through unavoidable circumstances,
or because university work on Satur
day morning, surveying especially,
prevents them. In this case such men
are to see the trainer or captain just
before or just after the meet to explain
their absence from the entries. Other
wise, and "Dad" wishes this made de
cisive, "their names will be removed
from the list of candidates, since we
have no time to bother with people
unless they come out." Freshmen and
untried men are asked to appear,
above all.
The first pistol shot will start, the
mile-run at 11 o'clock sharp, intsead
of 10:30 as previously announced. The
events are to go through their order
alternately. That is, following the
mile run for the aVrsity squad, will
come the same race for the Freshmen
and novices, the two grades of ath
letes being separated in this way, and
all being given a fair chance. The
distance runs will he cut down— the
mile from four to three laps.
