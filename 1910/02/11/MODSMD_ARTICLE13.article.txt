That the silence of the party at
tacked demonstrates the truth of the
charges of the party attacking is a
novel doctrine, and in adopting such a
contention the "Sequoia" displays
striking ingenuity, to say the least.
The magazine also departs from com
monly accepted rules and theories in
asserting that the burden of proving
themselves not guilty rests upon the
members of the Scaraboea society.
Upon these two assumptions the
present article is based. We do not
believe that the assumptions are
sound. Indeed, we can not conceive
how any one can say that the mere
failure to reply condemns him who
has been charged. It neither proves
nor disproves. Nor can we believe
that, to avoid being declared guilty,
the defendant must take it upon him
self to speak, before a single iota of
proof has been adduced to show him
in the wrong. It has been, is, and al
ways will be, for the prosecution to
prove its case. We have been given
no reason, although we have asked for
the same, why an exception to the in
variable rule should be made in the
present instance.
Where it. not for Mr. Leaf's state
ment in this issue of the Daily Palo
Alto, we might have assumed that he
was not in possession of sufficiently
complete facts to substantiate his
charges. For just one month ago to
day Editor Leaf made the following

statement to the editor of the Daily
Palo Alto: "A second instalment
will follow, substantiating by facts
and instances the charges made in the
more or less introductory article."
And yet, in the face of this promise,
no such "facts and instances" were
brought forth. Mr. Leaf says that
these were not necessary, because
the "Bugs" failed to answer. No such
condition prerequisite was attached to
that gentleman's statement of a month
ago, however. His words were posi
tive and unmistakable. They were
uttered after he had been informed
that the Daily Palo Alto could see no
good in such a crusade as he was in
itiating, unless absolute proof were
adduced. And Mr. Leaf then promised
absolute proof. We would suggest
that in the future the gentleman edit
the proofs of his magazine with more
prudence and care and thus avoid the
necessity of correcting erroneous im
pressions by using the columns of the
Daily Palo Alto.
Technically speaking, the "Sequoia"
having proven nothing, the presump
tion of innocence remains with Scara
boea, but the controversy has pro
ceeded so far that we would like to
see the whole matter cleared up by
facts, not by technicalities. The op
portunity is now offered by the editor
of the magazine. Scaraboea must
merely say that the society is not
guilty. If the "Bugs" are innocent,
they should not be forced to turn a
finger to refute the false accusations,
yet the Daily Palo Alto believes that
they would be aiding in a good cause
if they brought the discussion to a
square issue. A formal denial is now
the simplest way.
The "Sequoia" announces that it
omits "facts and instances" in an
endeavor to avoid internal strife, and
because the magazine has accom
plished its purpose by arousing the
Student Body to a realization of the
existing evils. It is a bit too late for
the "Sequoia" to talk about avoiding
internal strife, and as for the "exist
ing evils," our contemporary begs the
question. That is exactly what we
and everybody else wants to know.
Do such evils exist, or are they merely
the fancies of a piteously misguided
zealousness ? We are told that the
Student. Body has been put upon in
quiry. Against what ? If against
corruption, the undergraduates would
be far more benefited if they were
shown its details. If no corruption
exists, however, it is unfair to charge
the Scaraboea with it and unfair to
put the Student Body "upon inquiry"
against the Scaraboea. The "Sequoia"
started the turmoil. The "Sequoia"
ought to finish it.
Meantime, the stigma of a promise
unfulfilled remains upon the editor of
that magazine.
