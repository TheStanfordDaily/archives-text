# TO SETTLE AGREEMENT.
## Stanford and California Debating Committees to Meet Saturday and Arrange New Rules. 
### 
The Stanford Intercollegiate De
bating Agreement Committee, com
posed of J. E. Shelton, '10, P. J. Bat
kin, '10, and G. F. Morgan, '10, will
confer with a like committee from the
University of California this week and
will endeavor to arrange the condi
tions under which Intercollegiate de
bating will be conducted for the next
debating season. The meeting will be
held Saturday afternoon February 12,
preceeding the Carnot debate, and it
is expected that definite arrange
ments will be made at this time by
the two bodies so that they may be
ratified by the Executive Committees
of the respective Universities immed
iately.
It is not expected that any radical
changes will be made in the agree
ment as it now stands, unless the Cal
ifornia committee has more impor
tant permutations in mind than the
Stanford Committee. Although the
local trio has not definitely mapped
out its plans it will undoubtedly try
to have the time of the Intercollegiate
Debate changed and to broaden the
eligibility rules to include first yea>
postgraduates among those who ma?i
be placed upon Intercollegiate and
Carnot teams. The committee will
attempt to have the Intercollegiate
Debate in the future held on the night
preceeding the Intercollegiate Track
Meet so as to give the debaters them
selves a chance to attend and enjoy
the meet. The debate heretofore has
been held on the evening of the meet.
