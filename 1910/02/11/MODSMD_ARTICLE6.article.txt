# TO STRIVE FOR MEDAL
## CARNOT DEBATE AT BERKELEY TOMORROW. Batkin, Morgan, and Miller To Represent, Stanford in Important Forensic Contest. 
### 
Judging from the personnel of the
Stanford Carnot Debating Team, the
prospects are bright indeed for the
blossoming forth of the fourth Carnot
Medal in as many years upon the Car
dinal campus Sunday morning. And if
one of either R. J. Miller, '11, P. J.
Batkin, '10, or G. F. Morgan, '10 sue-1
ceeds in annexing the sixteenth annual
debate in Harmon Gymnasium Satur
day evening, the total Carnot score
will be a tie, for then Stanford will
have had eight victories as has Cali
fornia at the present time. Saturday
evening will tell the tale.
In Morgan, Miller, and Batkin, Stan
ford sends up her best forensic war-1
riors. A more experienced team of j
eligible intercollegiate debaters could
not have been selectea. These men
will have as their Blue and Gold op
ponents an equally experienced trio. |
composed of C. Kash, '11. N. B. Drury. I
'12. and F. M. Shipper, '12. The win-!
ning of the medal then is a matter of
quality. Those who have studied the!
relative merits of the two teams he-J
lieve that the local debaters excel! in :
this essential. However, this is a !
matter for the judges to decide and
those who have attended many debates
know that judges frequently seemingly
take a particular delight in passing j
out decisions contrary to popular opin
ion.
The general question for debate is:
"The division of the powers of gov
ernment in France," The particular
subject for the evening's discussion
will be announced two Hours before
the debate and the six speakers must
speak on two hours preparation. The
one showing the best understanding of
the question and marshalling his argu
ments in the clearest and most logical
manner is awarded the coveted Carnot
medal. Each debater has fifteen min
utes on the floor and he may divide
his time between two speeches, pro
viding that he speakes at. least four
minutes each time. He may choose
either side of the question that he de
sires. and in this way, he may have a
California man as a. team-mate al
though the respective team-mates do
not confer with each other during the
debate.
The Stanford contingent Has not been
able to ascertain who will act as
judges of the debate as the California
facultv committee on the Carnot De
lia fp bns not as yet sent, its choice to
the Stanford Committee. The specific
question will be selected Saturday
afternoon by these two committees
wh°" they meet, in joint, conference.
Pmfeooor Charles Galey of California
