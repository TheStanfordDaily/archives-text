# MEASLES EPIDEMIC UNLIKELY.
## Rapid Improvement, of Those Afflicted With the Disease Renders Its Spread Improbable. 
### 
All the students suffering from
measles are recovering rapidly and
are now entirely out of danger, al
though a few of the patients were in
rather a precarious condition for a
day or so. The possibility of a fur
ther spread of the disease grows more
remote as the days go by and if in
the next week no further cases are re
ported, all danger of an epidemic will
be over.
The Guild Board and a committee
representing the University Confer
ence, will meet Ibis afternoon to de
termine the financial practicability of
using tlie Cedro Cottage as a deten
tion hospital. The Guild is allowed
but temporary possession of the cot
tace and, according to the permission
received from the State Board of
Health, only cases of measles can be
treated in it. Thus it is likely that
unless more cases develop in the
next few days, no use will be made of
the house. A proposition for the
erection of a permanent hospital on
the campus will also be taken up at
the joint, meeting of the University
Conference committee and the Guild
Board.
