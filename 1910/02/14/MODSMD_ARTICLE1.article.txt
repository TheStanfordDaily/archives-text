# ALL-STARS ARE FAST
## VARSITY TAKEN INTO CAMP BY SCORE OF 5 TO 1. Presley Inaugurates New Line-up In the Infield, and Varsity Team Improves. 
### 
The Varsity was laid 011 the shelf
by the All-Stars nine last Saturday
afternoon to the tune of 5-1. The
game was played on the turf of Stan
ford Field, this being the first use
made of that diamond since it was
determined to hand it over to the ball
tossers about a year ago. Altogether
the contest Saturday was not a poor
one from the standpoint of the Varsity.
The infield quartet was much
strengthened by the changing and
substituting of several men, though
there is still room for improvement.
M. Mitchell had charge of the short
position; McFadden was at the key
stone, and Tallant at third, for the
greater part of the game. H. E. Reed,
'10, held down the mound for the
first time this year, and did fairly
well for his initial appearance. At the
end of six innings he handed over the
box to Jones, who was also efficient.
He allowed but one hit in the remain
ing three chapters. Ten Varsity bat
wielders were unable to connect with
the offerings of Theile and Emerson,
assisted by Rutledge and Earle as the
masked half of the battery. In the hit
line only two Cardinals got the cor
bination, M. Mitchell for a single and
McFadden for a double and one-sacker.
Peters and Friene marked up two
tallies for the All-Stars in the opening
chapter, assisted by sacrifices and very
opportune hits.
They added another in their half of
the fourth, when Sampson was trans
ported, stole the keystone, and crossed
the platter behind Jordan's hit and
the subsequent play. Score, 3-0.
Beeger saved the day for the Cardi
nals in the same inning. He was look
ed upon kindly by Peters, who fought
his little grounder, and gave him first
base. He took second on Orr's error,
third on a passed ball and home by
beating in the fielding of Child's
grounder to Sampson. Score, 3-1.
