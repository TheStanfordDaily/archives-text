# ADVOCATES AMATEUR OPERA.
## Professor Woodward Is In Favor of Production By Home Talent If Practicable.

Editor Daily Palo Alto:
In a recent issue of your paper it
was stated that the Junior Opera com
mittee had been authorized by the
class "either to select a manuscsript
by a student or to go into the profes
sional field for an opera." I hope that
I may be pardoned if I take the lib
erty of saying that in my judgment a
large part of the theatre-going public
of the community will be disappointed
if a professional libretto is selected.
The chief purpose of dramatic and
operatic productions by the students
is two-fold: first, to afford oppor
tunities for the development and dis
play of student talent; and second, to
provide entertainment for the Univer
sity community. Both ends would be
better served, it seems to me, by the
selection of an opera written by a
member of the student body, than by
going into the professional field. For
not only would the door of opportunity
be opened to our writers as well as
to our actors and singers, but the
pleasure of the audience would cer
tainly be enhanced by the knowledge
that the opera had been written by a
member of the University family. If
the other classes or the dramatic or
ganizations were giving us plays of
amateur authorship, the matter would
be unimportant. But since the Seniors
have adopted the policy of presenting
the work of professional playwrights,
the only hope for our amateurs lies
with the Junior Opera committee.
It may be, of course, that no ama
teur manuscript of merit will be sub
mitted. If so, a professional one ob
viously must be chosen. But when
one thinks of the literary and musical
talent at present in the student body,
one is reluctant to believe that the
committee will not receive a manu
script better than the average comic
opera or musical comedy of the day.
Furthermore, there are many of us
who would more thoroughly enjoy a
fairly clever opera of "home produc
tion" than a better one imported from
the professional stage.
Thanking you for the use of your
columns.
I am, Yours very truly,
(Signed) F. C. WOODWARD.
