# NOT TO USE CEDRO COTTAGE.
## Necessiates Too Large Expenditure, Case Reported In Mayfield. Rowatt Released. 
### 
Since the use of the Cedro Cottage
can be secured from the University
authorities for the present epidemic
only, the Guild Board has finally given
up the hope of converting it into a
hospital. An additional obstacle lies
in the fact that the State Health offi
cials have simply granted permission
for the transfer of patients suffering
from measles across the county line,
and it is unlikely that they would
sanction the use of the cottage as a
pest-house to roof all cases of in
fectious diseases arising on the camp
us, especially as residents in adjacent
parts of San Mateo county are al
ready complaining of the prospective
immigration of measles patients
across the border.
It is estimated that the total cost of
oufltting the house and transferring
the patients there, along with their
necessary living expenses lor a period
of three weeks, would exceed $1,000,
and it is felt that this expendditure
would be unjustifiable for the use of
the hospital for so short a time.
Another case of measles was dis
covered in Mayfield a few days ago.
W. H. Patterson, '10, a student in the
Law department, is the sufferer from
the disease and is now under quaran
tine in his room. R. Rowatt, '12,
whose case marked the appearance of
the epidemic, is reported as being per
fectly well and was released from
quarantine yesterday.
rt, is the present intention of the
Guild to continue the temporary hos
pital at Encina for three weeks, by
which time it is expected that all the
patients can be released from deten
tion.
