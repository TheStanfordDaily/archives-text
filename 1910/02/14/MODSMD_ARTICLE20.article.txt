# SOPHOMORES BEST FRESHMEN.
## Second Year Men Win By 9-5> Score Hard Fight for the Ball Follows Game. 
### 
So far did the interest in the fight
for possession of the ball overshadow
the interest in the game played be
tween the Sophomores and the Fresh
men that play was stopped at the be
ginning of the ninth inning with the
score 9 to 5 in favor of the second
year men. Then ensued a wild rush, a
fight, in which the use of fists and
strangle holds was not uncommon.
Peculiarly enough, several balls ap
peared in the crowd, and who suc

ceeded in escaping with the prize one
is an unanswerable problem.
The game itself was not a remark
ably good exhibition of the national
sport, both the pitchers and the field
ers seeming to be rattled by the jeers
of the rival rooting sections.
Following is the summary:
R. H. E.
Sophomores 9 7 3
Freshmen 5 5 5
