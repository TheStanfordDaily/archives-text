# CALIFORNIA WINS CARNOT DEBATE
## Unanimous Vote of Judges Awards Medal for 1910 to N.B. Drury, '12, After Close Contest Saturday Evening. 
### 
The sixteenth link in the chain of
Intercollegiate Carnot Debates will
not be welded by Stanford University.
This was decided upon Saturday even
ing in Harmon Gymnasium, at the
State University, when after the great
audience had listened to one of the
closest, most vigorous and finished de
bates 011 record, Joseph S. Tobin, of
San Francisco, 011 behalf of the judges,
declared Newton Bishop Drury, '12, of
the University of California, winner of
the Carnot Medal for the year 1910.
The opinion of the judges was unan
imous and quickly agreed upon when
in conference.
In Drury, the Blue and Gold possess
es one of the ablest debaters ever to
represent, her. Although only a Soph
omore, he has been on two Carnot
teams and one Intercollegiate team,
has developed in this short time from
an average debater of the usual type
to a distinctive and vigorous speaker
with a highly impressive delivery and
incisive rendition of argument. It was
because of his polished delivery and
the general atmosphere of complete
ness created by his furtherance of the
argumentative points, that he was
awarded the much-sought medal Sat
in day.
Before the judges went into con
ference, the audience knew that the
award rested between Drury and G. F.
Morgan, '10, of Stanford. The two
men were seemingly on a par. Morgan
had excelled in bis rebutatory argu
ment and in bis general readiness of
debate, while Drury had excelled as a
finished speaker and as a creator of
the so-called "favorable impression."
Morgan spent practically all of his
time as a speaker on the negative in
tying the affirmative arguments one
after another in hard knots and rush
ing on in a veritable whirlwind or'
logic, analogy, and inference to the
following points, to accord them like
treatment. In this he succeeded all
along the line, but his wonderful pow
ers of rebuttal did not outweigh
Drury's constructive plan of argument
and finished delivery in the eyes of the
judges, who were Joseph S. Tobin and
Sheldon G. Kellogg, of San Francisco
and Rev. Edward L. Parsons, of Ber
keley,
The specific question for debate
which was selected for extemporane
ous argument two hours before the
debate was: "Resolved, That, the
French Departments should be given
substantial legislative and executive
powers." Of this question, Batkin of
Stanford and Drury of California took
the affirmative while Morgan and Mil
ler of Stanford and Kasch and Ship
per of California took the negative.
Each debater spoke fifteen minutes in
all, usually dividing his time with an
eleven minute opening address and a
four minute rebuttal. Professor
Chauncey Wells, of the California De
partment of English, presided.

P. J. Batkin, '10, opened up the de
bate for the affirmative in a clear log
ical style in which he outlined the
question to be discussed and brought
out the contentions that the granting
of powers to the departments was a
logical step in the transformation of
France into a full Democracy, that
the government officials in the depart
ments are out of sympathy with the
people, and that the French govern
ment at present is a rancorous ami
unsettled one since it is a compromise
between royalistic and republican ten
dencies. Batkin in his rebuttal did
truly remarkable work, and his speci
fic quotations from authorities and the
compelling force of his argument made
his rebuttal the strongest of the even
ing.
The negative was also opened by
Stanford. R. J. Miller, '11 in his usual
brilliant and engaging manner pre
sented the first arguments of the op
posite side. His main point was that
the present system of government is
a desirable one, in that the well
trained prefects and the local councils
acted as an ideal check and balance 011
each other, and that it is econo
nomical. Miller seemed to show a sup
erior grasp of the details of the ques
tion, and he excelled in ease of man
ner and stage presence.
Kasch. of California, followed Miller,
and in a vigorous manner made a
passionate plea for a continuance of
the Third Republic in that it had prov
en the most successful form of gov
ernment yet tried in France, and that
it would be an outrage to disrupt the
: government while yet in its infancy.
Drury, as second affirmative, de
clared that a centralized form of gov
ernment was a relic of despotism, that
all the movements in France had been
toward decentralization, and that the
ultimate success of the French de
pended on republicanism, that central
ization was a foreign element in the
French system and that it made for a
dictatorship.
G. F. Morgan, '10. of Stanford, as
third negative, with few preliminary
remarks quickly took up the affirma
tive arguments and made mince meat
out of them in rapid succession. He
| showed how decentralization would
1 lead to innumerable small local gov
ernments which would destroy all
unity in France, how centralization
was not a foreign element, as Drury
had maintained, and that the French
legislatures represented the people
sufficiently.
Shipper, of California, in closing
the debate declared in his straight
forward manner that the affirmative
advocated a, form of government far
j in advance of French possibility and
that there is absolute need of such a
! centralized form as France has today.
The medal won by Drury is the first
' one awarded to a California man in
â– 
four years.

toward decentralization, and that the
ultimate success of the French de
pended on republicanism, that central
ization was a foreign element in the
French system and that it made for a
dictatorship.
G. F. Morgan, '10. of Stanford, as
third negative, with few preliminary
remarks quickly took up the affirma
tive arguments and made mince meat
out of them in rapid succession. He
| showed how decentralization would
1 lead to innumerable small local gov
ernments which would destroy all
unity in France, how centralization
was not a foreign element, as Drury
had maintained, and that the French
legislatures represented the people
sufficiently.
Shipper, of California, in closing
the debate declared in his straight
forward manner that the affirmative
advocated a, form of government far
j in advance of French possibility and
that there is absolute need of such a
! centralized form as France has today.
The medal won by Drury is the first
' one awarded to a California man in
â– 
four years.
The sixteenth link in the chain of
Intercollegiate Carnot Debates will
not be welded by Stanford University.
This was decided upon Saturday even
ing in Harmon Gymnasium, at the
State University, when after the great
audience had listened to one of the
closest, most vigorous and finished de
bates 011 record, Joseph S. Tobin, of
San Francisco, 011 behalf of the judges,
declared Newton Bishop Drury, '12, of
the University of California, winner of
the Carnot Medal for the year 1910.
The opinion of the judges was unan
imous and quickly agreed upon when
in conference.
In Drury, the Blue and Gold possess
es one of the ablest debaters ever to
represent, her. Although only a Soph
omore, he has been on two Carnot
teams and one Intercollegiate team,
has developed in this short time from
an average debater of the usual type
to a distinctive and vigorous speaker
with a highly impressive delivery and
incisive rendition of argument. It was
because of his polished delivery and
the general atmosphere of complete
ness created by his furtherance of the
argumentative points, that he was
awarded the much-sought medal Sat
in day.
Before the judges went into con
ference, the audience knew that the
award rested between Drury and G. F.
Morgan, '10, of Stanford. The two
men were seemingly on a par. Morgan
had excelled in bis rebutatory argu
ment and in bis general readiness of
debate, while Drury had excelled as a
finished speaker and as a creator of
the so-called "favorable impression."
Morgan spent practically all of his
time as a speaker on the negative in
tying the affirmative arguments one
after another in hard knots and rush
ing on in a veritable whirlwind or'
logic, analogy, and inference to the
following points, to accord them like
treatment. In this he succeeded all
along the line, but his wonderful pow
ers of rebuttal did not outweigh
Drury's constructive plan of argument
and finished delivery in the eyes of the
judges, who were Joseph S. Tobin and
Sheldon G. Kellogg, of San Francisco
and Rev. Edward L. Parsons, of Ber
keley,
The specific question for debate
which was selected for extemporane
ous argument two hours before the
debate was: "Resolved, That, the
French Departments should be given
substantial legislative and executive
powers." Of this question, Batkin of
Stanford and Drury of California took
the affirmative while Morgan and Mil
ler of Stanford and Kasch and Ship
per of California took the negative.
Each debater spoke fifteen minutes in
all, usually dividing his time with an
eleven minute opening address and a
four minute rebuttal. Professor
Chauncey Wells, of the California De
partment of English, presided.

P. J. Batkin, '10, opened up the de
bate for the affirmative in a clear log
ical style in which he outlined the
question to be discussed and brought
out the contentions that the granting
of powers to the departments was a
logical step in the transformation of
France into a full Democracy, that
the government officials in the depart
ments are out of sympathy with the
people, and that the French govern
ment at present is a rancorous ami
unsettled one since it is a compromise
between royalistic and republican ten
dencies. Batkin in his rebuttal did
truly remarkable work, and his speci
fic quotations from authorities and the
compelling force of his argument made
his rebuttal the strongest of the even
ing.
The negative was also opened by
Stanford. R. J. Miller, '11 in his usual
brilliant and engaging manner pre
sented the first arguments of the op
posite side. His main point was that
the present system of government is
a desirable one, in that the well
trained prefects and the local councils
acted as an ideal check and balance 011
each other, and that it is econo
nomical. Miller seemed to show a sup
erior grasp of the details of the ques
tion, and he excelled in ease of man
ner and stage presence.
Kasch. of California, followed Miller,
and in a vigorous manner made a
passionate plea for a continuance of
the Third Republic in that it had prov
en the most successful form of gov
ernment yet tried in France, and that
it would be an outrage to disrupt the
: government while yet in its infancy.
Drury, as second affirmative, de
clared that a centralized form of gov
ernment was a relic of despotism, that
all the movements in France had been
toward decentralization, and that the
ultimate success of the French de
pended on republicanism, that central
