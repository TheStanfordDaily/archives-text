# MEET BRINGS RESULTS
## SEVERAL FRESHMEN PERFORM LIKE VETERANS. Varsity Men Also Make Good Showing and a Track Victory is More Hopeful. 
### 
Trainer "Dad" Moulton is smiling
over the results. A good number of men
were enticed out on the cinders and
field by the perfect weather, and the
first track meet of the season last
Saturday morning has left everyone
with a strongly favorable impression
of the qualities of the prospective Car
dinal oval representatives. "Dad"
says that, "011 the average the tryouts
were the best recorded in past years
so early on the calendar." R. B. An
drews, '13, was one of the several
startling novices, capturing the cen
tury and the 220 in splendid early
season time. The 100 yards he negoti
ated in 10:4, the furlong in 24 flat.
This is unusually good when it is
taken into consideration that his star
has but recently risen above the track
horizon. The two much-heralded
Freshmen in the high-jump also show
ed their mettle, although Argabrite
did not do as well as expected be
cause of a bad ankle. Horine, how
ever, made sure of an intercollegiate
point close to the top by clearing the
bar at 6 feet, V 2 inch. Argabrite and
Poor, the Varsity jumpers, tied for
second place at Varsity men
made satisfactory showings in the 100
and 220-yard dashes, the pole vault,
and in the two-mile, reduced to 5 laps.
Smitherum came out ahead in the 100,
with the watches ticking up to 10:3,
and soon after made a 23:1 dash in the
220; Rellah, with an exhibition of
form that was an art, vaulted 11 feet,
7 x /4 inches, a mere early season show
ing for him; and Newman ran ahead
of Templeton in the 5-lap "two mile,"
at the rate of 6:15 2-5. Dole and Wool
ley, while not making any very notice
able impressions on the tape, yet dem
onstrated that, they were good for a
respectable increase in distance be
fore the season nears its end, in their
events, the shot-put and hammer
throw, respectively. H. L. Horton, '09,
and D. P. Crawford, '09, did not com
plete in the shot or hammer; many
Varsity squad men, including Captain
Scott, did not take part in the meet.
