Professor Woodward speaks for a
large number when he states that a
"fairly clever opera of home produc
tion" would he more enjoyed than a
better one imported from the profes
sional stage. And should a "fairly
clever" libretto be obtainable, we
would heartily endorse its presenta
tion as a Junior opera. But the adop
tion of a third book as insipid as the
last two would be a little too much of
an imposition upon the college public.
Furthermore, in reference to Dr.
Woodward's communication, we be
lieve that we speak for the entire
Student Body when we say that such
evidence of a live interest in under
graduate affairs on the part of so
prominent a member of the faculty is
keenly appreciated and warmly ap
plauded. Too few professors resem
ble him in his desire to be of service
to the Student Body.
