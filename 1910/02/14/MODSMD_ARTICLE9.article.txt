Although the gymnasium soccer
team was defeated 2 to 0 by the Bar

team made a very creditable showing.
The individual work of the players
was excellent, but they were outclas

structor Maloney was very well
pleased with the work of the men, and
expects to organize a strong team be
fore the end of the season.
The gymnasium team lined-up as
follows: Forwards—Maloney, Hig
gins, Doran, Hubbard, (captain), Mac
ready; halves—Hamilton, Lacey, Oak
ley; full —Clyde, Williams, Erb; goal

On next Saturday at 4:30, the sec
