Once again we are forced to criti
cise the injudiciousness of the chair
men of various committees and the
presidents of various organizations in
choosing meeting dates. In the col
umns of the present issue of this
paper we find several breaches for
which we can conceive no valid ex
cuse. Two committees are to convene
during Dr. Jordan's famous Matter
horn lecture. A club has scheduled a
meeting for the same time. Another
committee conferred during the Var
sity baseball game today. A Palo Alto
organization has advertised a session
for Saturday afternoon, when, weather
permitting, there seldom fails to be an
athletic attraction of merit. We are
confident that each and all of these
conflicts could be avoided. Assuming
it impracticable to alter the day de
cided upon, which it is not save in a
very few instances, another remedy
still exists. Dr. Jordan's lecture do3s
not begin until 8 o'clock; mid-week
baseball contests commence no earlier
than 4:15; and Saturday's games in
variably conclude by 4:30. A little
forethought on the part of those re
sponsible will thoroughly eradicate
the evil.
