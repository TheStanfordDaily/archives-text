# Writes About Stanford Union.

Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Now that the "Chaparral" is urging
students to take greater interest in
the Stanford Union, would it not be
well for those who have charge of the
project to give some general informa
tion to the public ? Many of us would
be willing enough to take interest if
we had anything tangible upon which
to work. At present the popular con
ception of the Union is hazy in the
extreme, the common belief being that
it is a matter of only remote interest,
in which the present generation can
have 110 part. In order to focus at
tention on the matter, I should like
to offer a few questions, in the hope
that those who have charge of the
Union will give us specific details:
1. Where is the proposed building
to be situated ? Has any definite or
general site been chosen ?
2. What are to be some of the fea
tures of the building ? Is it to be
modeled 011 a city club, with ball
room, club-room, office, etc ? What
amusement features will be provided ?
To whom, and upon what terms,
will the privileges of the Union be
open ? Will there lie membership
fees, dues, etc. ?
4. Exactly how much money must
be raised before the work of con
struction is begun ?
5. What is the earliest date at
which we may reasonably hope to see
the cornerstone laid ? How soon after
that; ought the building to be finished ?
I believe that information along
these lines will be of genuine interest
to the student, body.
