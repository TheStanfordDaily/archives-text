# ANNOUNCE TRACK MEET
## TO SELECT FRESHMAN TEAM FOR ST. MARY'S CONTEST. All Varsity Men Will Enter Saturday. H.B. Stolz Covers Hundred In Fast Time. 
### 
A preliminary track meet on next
Saturday morning at 11 o'clock was
announced by Captain Scott today.
This meet will be similar to the one
last week, in the division of the con
testants into classes according to their
experience, but it is not expected that
any of the races, with the exception
of the two-mile run, will he short
ened.
The results of this contest will
probably determine the men who will
compose the Freshman team, which is
scheduled to go to Oakland on Friday
26 to meet the track athletes of St.
Mary's College. This is the only trip
away from the campus which the 1913
team will take.
Trainer Moult on wants all Varsity
men to enter their respective events
on Saturday, as the team which will
leave for its southern trip on March 3.
is to be picked from the men maklne
the best t!me in this meet and in the
trials to be had during the following
week. Tl is expected that about four
teen men and the trainer will he
taken south, but Captain Scott, when
seen today, stated emphatically tha*
anyone who does not participate in
the try-outs Saturday will not even be
considered for the trip: and that this
was a warning to several Varsity
men w ho seemed to be shirking work.
In the face of a bitter cold wind
yesterday afternoon H. E. Stolz, '09.
ran the fastest 100 yards of the sen
son. Stolz ran perfectly in his trial,
coming faster with each stride and
broke the tape in just a shade over
10:2. This is remarkable time in
which to cover the distance at, this
period of training. To show his ver
satility Stolz made one attempt at the
broad jump immediately afterwards,
chalking up a mark of 20 ft, (> in. as
a result.
Another sprinter who has improved
wonderfully since last season is IT.
Smitherum, '11, who took first place
in the dashes on Saturday.
Due to "Dad's" coaching, Smither
um has changed his style in running
and is now covering the ground in
bounding strides entirely unlike the
form which he previously used.
Snyder, the Freshman quarter-miler,
who was expected to make a showing
in this event did not do as well as
usual in the meet, finishing third in 57
seconds, although in trials he has
run well under that time. Although
entirely new to the game, Snyder has a
lone: ,easy stride, being built on the
same plan as John O. Miller, and pos
sesses every qualification for a good
quarter man. By the end of the sea
son, when he has developed endur
ance, some fast time can be expected
of him.
