# VARSITY HAS DECISIVE GAME.
## Fourth Contest of St. Mary's Series at Oakland Wednesday. Gilfillan Will Pitch. 
### 
The Varsity plays its second game
off the campus tomorrow afternoon at
Oakland, meeting St. Mary's for the
fourth time this season. This game
might be looked upon as a decisive
one, since St. Mary's have won two
and the Varsity one out of a series of
five contests. While in former years
Stanford has not looked upon the out
come of the series as being important
one way or the other, yet the Phoenix
men are always careful to win what
might be called the championship con
test. This applies even more strongly
to the Santa Clara series, and they
usually come out ahead with three
games out of five to their credit.
Should the Cardinal Varsity get the
worst side of the score at Oakland to
morrow the nine might be considered
to be out of the running.
Gilfillan toes the rubber against
Phoenix, with B. L. Ball to do the
signal work. Gilfillan pitched very
creditably against the same team
a week ago, and should be depended
upon tomorrow. It is almost a sure
thing that Wilcox will cover the
mound for the college men across
the bay, with the fast Simpson as his
battery mate.
The Varsity is to leave for the game
on the 11 :34 train from Palo Alto, tak
ing lunch on the ferry and arriving in
time for play at 2:30, probably on ihe
