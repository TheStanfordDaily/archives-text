The writer of the communication in
another column of this issue has de
sired that his name be withheld from
the public. We can assure the Stu
dent Body, however, that he is, as he
states, "a plain Stanford man who has
not been in a position to know much
about Stanford politics." The opinion
of such a man is valuable. It is by
the class which he represents that the
controversy will be decided. The con
clusion finally reached by the un
biased onlooker will be the important
one.
We are wholly of the belief that the
writer of the present communication
speakes for a vast majority when he
insists that the "Sequoia" "lay open
the inside of Stanford politics as
promised." We repeat that the simpl
est way of bringing about such a dis
closure is a formal denial by the Bugs.
By thus demanding the facts in the
possession of the magazine, Scaraboea
will be rendering the Student Body a
commendable service.
As regards the statement of "A
Stanford Man" that certain things led
him to believe in the truth of the
charges made, the position of the
Daily Palo Alto remains the same as
on January 11, the date of the com
mencement of the controversy. We
await proof.
