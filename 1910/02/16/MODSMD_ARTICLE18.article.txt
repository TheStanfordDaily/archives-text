# DISAPPOINTED WITH "SEQUOIA."
## "A Stanford Man" Expresses Opinion That Magazine Should Disclose Its Information. 
### 
Since I am a plain Stanford man
who has not been in a position to
know much about Stanford politics
and am only interested in Stanford
affairs as any student has the right to
be, I feel that I can write the follow
ing with perfect fairness to all sides
concerned. I feel that I am voicing
the sentiments of a large mass of stu
dents.
At last that stupendous issue of the
"Sequoia" has burst upon us in all its
terror. And how much has it added to
our information ? The man who was
to substantiate the charges made in
an earlier issue has figuratively hop
ped to one side and attempted to sneak
up behind the Bug and slay it without
the danger which might arise, should
he face it like a man. The author of
the article on the "Inside of Stanford
Politics" led us to believe that he
knew something about a certain thing
vitally important to Stanford men.
He also led us to believe that he was
going to lay that information before
us. Why did he not do it ? We do not
care a rap what the Bug did not say.
What we want to know is what the
writer of the article promised to say
and did not.
The blind of "laying down his hand,"
of weakening his cause by specific
charges, and worst of all, the idea that
the burden of proof is upon the ac
cused society is ridiculous. He should
remember that we are living in an
age now,, when the burden of proof is
upon the accuser.
We do not mean to say that we be
lieve his charges are wrong. Certain
things led us to believe them to be
true.
But we do insist that he lay open the
inside of Stanford politics as he
promised, else he has shown himself
to be doing just what he insists that
the Bugs are doing, "crawling out of
the issue."
