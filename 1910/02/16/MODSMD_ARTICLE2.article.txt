A novel method of announcing the
results of field events will be seen in
operation at the track during the lat
ter part of the present season. Posts
are to be set up near the places where
the events are customarily held and on
these posts will be hung cards show

tance, which has just been made, and
to what team the contestant belongs.
This will prove to be a groat con
venience to the spectators at the Var
sity meet as in the past it was impos
sible to secure any knowledge of what
the team was doing in the field events
until the official announcement had
been made.
The track is not in the best condi
tion now for thn men to work upon, as
the covering of cinders if almost en
tirely worn off. Steps to improve it
have been taken, however, and a coal
ing of cinders is to be placed on the
inside paths, each nbrht until the track
is a'rain in good shape. To keep the
ground soft, in order not to cause any
break-downs. the whole course is to
be harrowed twice a week.
