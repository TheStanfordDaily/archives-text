# MANY ATTEND LECTURE
## DR. JORDAN TELLS OF CLIMBING THE MATTERHORN. He Holds the Record Of Being the Heaviest Man To Scale That Formidable Peak. 
### 
A large audience listened to Dr.
Jordan's interesting lecture on "An
Ascent of the Matterhorn" in the As
sembly Hall last night. Dr. Jordan
holds the record of being "the heav
iest man who ever had the honor of
pulling himself up the Matterhorn."
Besides Dr. Jordan, two other Stan
ford men were in the party, Professor
Gilbert of the Zoology department
and Professor Anderson of the English
department. Many lantern slides made
the lecture doubly interesting.
Dr. Jordan told of other high moun
tains having heads rounded by gla
ciers, but said that none has ever
worn the angles of the Matterhorn
into curves. Its slopes are too steep
for snow to cling to, and all the snow
that falls upon them rolls down its
sides and lies in three great glaciers
at the bottom. These conditions made
the Matterhorn the last peak in the
Alps to be climbed, and this was not
until many lives had been lost. Dr.
Jordan's party made the ascent on
August 10, 1 SSI. being among
earliest scalers of this peak
The start was made from Zermatt
at 1:30 a.m. After sunrise every step
was on the edge of a precipice, mak
ing it necessary for the members of
the party to be tied together with
ropes. The last five hundred feet was
a ragged wall of rock, the steepest of
all. This was finally surmounted and
the summit reached a little after I
noon. The top is a little crest about i
twenty feet, long and from one to J
three feet wide. The descent was the j
most trying. At times the party felt ;
the full force of the tourment, a wind
peculiar to high mountains. "One of
our company," said Dr. Jordan, "wore •
a hat drawn down tightly over hi- '
ears; the tourment took it and ;
whirled it high in the air. The learned
professor fell fiat on the ground, while
every hair in his head caught the
rotary motion and stood straight out "
One of the loose rocks which gave
way struck Professor Gilbert, giving
him a severe wound in the head. It.
was only with the utmost difficulty
that he was taken the remaining dis
tance. During this episode, an im
mense avalanche hardly missed th?
party.
