# OPERA IS NOT CHOSEN
## COMMITTEE MAKES CONCESSION TO HOME TALENT. Juniors Giving Every Opportunity To Students Who Are Writing Scores For Annual Opera. 
### 
Up to the present writing, the Jun
ior Opera Committee has been forced
0 inaction upon the work of actually
developing the material that is to be
used in the opera on account of (lie
utter impossibility upon the part of
the committee to select a vehicle for
Ihe players. This hindrance to the
progress of the committee has been
occasioned so far by the efforts that
ire being made by that board to se
cure, if possible, a satisfactory stu
dent production.
The scores that have been submitted
have not been of a quality required by
those in charge of the Opera. But in
order to allow the student body every
opportunity to show what can be done
in local talent, the board of Juniors
decided to give the various play
wrights another chance to submit
manuscripts for a second considera
tion upon the part of the committee.
If any possibility presents itself
whereby the board can justify the
adoption of a score, that committee
has signified its intention to patronize
home talent. Hut in view of the fact
that the time for the presentation of
the Opera is so near at hand, this de
lay upon the part of the committee is
a considerable concession, as this de
lay means additional work in the pro
duction of the show.
Within ihe next, few days, the stu
dent productions will be returned to
the committee and they will at that
time decide finally between an ama
teur and professional opera.
