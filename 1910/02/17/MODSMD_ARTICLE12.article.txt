The "Palo Alto Tribune", copying
an alleged news article which appears
in the Berkeley "Independent," in
forms ns that, contrary to all rules,
"G. F. Morgan, a member of the Stan
ford Carnot team, was found in his
room before the debate Saturday night
receiving assistance from .T. E. Shel
ton." This incident, it is claimed, oc
curred during the two hours elapsing
between the announcement of the
question and the beginning of the de
bate. The "Tribune" states that Pro
fessor Flaherty, of California, on mak
ing his round of visits to the debaters,
surprised Morgan in the company of
Shelton, ordered the latter from the
building "and offered to throw him oui
if he did not move quickly."
The article also states that guards
were then stationed, fearing a renewed
attempt; that Morgan proclaimed him
self unfamiliar with the rules and
"had not thought he was cheating;"
and that "following the award of the
medal Morgan stepped across to the
California team and apologized for his
actions."
We are convinced that there is no!
a single word of truth in the entire
tale. The allegations are most emphat
ically denied by Professor Flaherty as
well as by Messrs. Morgan and Shel
ton, who did not see each other from
the moment that the specific question
was given the debaters until the con
clusion of the contest. Furthermore,
the"Daily Californian" states that
the "Independent" was not in posses
sion of the facts.
The incident is merely a scurri
lous attempt at, scandal on the part of
two papers who care more for sensa
tionalism than for truth. Such an at
tempt on the part of the "Tribune,"
which manifestly aims to have the in
terests of Stanford at heart, is dis
gusting in the extreme and will serve
only to degrade its already low repu
tation among the Student Body.

A professor who, in accordance with
a suggestion recently offered by the
Daily Palo Alto, has been endeavoring
to dismiss his classes promptly upon
the ringing of the first bell, complains
that the members of his courses have
not been endeavoring to reach the
class-room promptly upon the ringing
of the second bell. To that professor
we would say thÂ»t he may keep his
students as long after the hour ex
pires as he pleases without fear of
criticism from us.
