# MORE ABOUT "SEQUOIA."
## S.J. Talbot. Suggests That Student Hotly Investigate Charges Against Scaraboea. 
### 
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Last evening you published a letter
from a "plain Stanford Man" who is
dissatisfied because the editor of the
"Sequoia" has not disclosed the speci
fic facts upon which the recent charges
have been based. There seems to be a
difference of opinion as to just what
the duty of the editor of the "Sequoia*
may be. There are others upon whom
there devolves some duty and respon
sibility in the matter.
The editor of a college publication is
not to be expected to act as if he alone
were responsible for what concerns
the whole of the Associated Students.
Tlie "Sequoia" has pointed out certain
evils and abuses in Student. Body poli
tics and finances. Prominent men of
our Student Body have been attacked.
The charges made are not such that
the Student Body can afford to pass
them by without investigation. Some
students say they don't believe the
charges. Others are morally certain
that the charges are (rue. Whether
the charges are true or false, it seems
astonishing that the Student Body as a
whole does not show itself sufficiently
concerned to make an investigation
into the charges.
We have bad enough waiting and
inaction. Let us have a thorough in
vestigation which will take the matter
out of the hands of the "Sequoia"
editor. Let the Stdent. Body assume
the responsibility which rightfully be
longs to the whole body. The charges
made are serious ones. Ts not the
Quadrangle Club enough interested m
seeing that nothing be done to "hurt
the name of Stanford" to look into
the matter ? Is our claim to the right
of student self-government so slightly
founded that our University Confer
ence has not stamina and back-bone
enough to set to the bottom of the
charges ? There is a responsibility
attaching to more parties than the
"Sequoia" editor. If the charges are
true, the conditions here are a dis
grace to the Student Body. If they are
false, we ought to know about it. Now
is the time to settle the matter. Have
a closed session of the Student Body
if there is fear of open scandal. But
in any case, let us make it. a Student
Body affair and not a personal one.
The attitude of standing back and
waiting to see what turns up is not a
proper one at this time. Let the af
fair be settled now to the satisfac
tion of the Student Body. Let the
fight in p: be out in the open. If a
"plain Stanford man" wants open and
frank conduct from the "Sequoia",
does he act consistently when he has
the termerity to publish his letter
without his name ? Does the Student
Body want to know the facts yet stand
around waiting and not shouldering
its own responsibility ?
The Student Body can show up
either the Scaraboea or the "Sequoia"
editor. Both cannot lie right. Tf the
members of the Student. Body really
care how their affairs are run the best
way to show it is by looking into the
"Sequoia" charges and branding them
;is true or false. But if they don't
care, let us stop talking about it lest,
we hurt our chances in the next ath
letic contest.

Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Last evening you published a letter
from a "plain Stanford Man" who is
dissatisfied because the editor of the
"Sequoia" has not disclosed the speci
fic facts upon which the recent charges
have been based. There seems to be a
difference of opinion as to just what
the duty of the editor of the "Sequoia*
may be. There are others upon whom
there devolves some duty and respon
sibility in the matter.
The editor of a college publication is
not to be expected to act as if he alone
were responsible for what concerns
the whole of the Associated Students.
Tlie "Sequoia" has pointed out certain
evils and abuses in Student. Body poli
tics and finances. Prominent men of
our Student Body have been attacked.
The charges made are not such that
the Student Body can afford to pass
them by without investigation. Some
students say they don't believe the
charges. Others are morally certain
that the charges are (rue. Whether
the charges are true or false, it seems
astonishing that the Student Body as a
whole does not show itself sufficiently
concerned to make an investigation
into the charges.
We have bad enough waiting and
inaction. Let us have a thorough in
vestigation which will take the matter
out of the hands of the "Sequoia"
editor. Let the Stdent. Body assume
the responsibility which rightfully be
longs to the whole body. The charges
made are serious ones. Ts not the
Quadrangle Club enough interested m
seeing that nothing be done to "hurt
the name of Stanford" to look into
the matter ? Is our claim to the right
of student self-government so slightly
founded that our University Confer
ence has not stamina and back-bone
enough to set to the bottom of the
charges ? There is a responsibility
attaching to more parties than the
"Sequoia" editor. If the charges are
true, the conditions here are a dis
grace to the Student Body. If they are
false, we ought to know about it. Now
is the time to settle the matter. Have
a closed session of the Student Body
if there is fear of open scandal. But
in any case, let us make it. a Student
Body affair and not a personal one.
The attitude of standing back and
waiting to see what turns up is not a
proper one at this time. Let the af
fair be settled now to the satisfac
tion of the Student Body. Let the
fight in p: be out in the open. If a
"plain Stanford man" wants open and
frank conduct from the "Sequoia",
does he act consistently when he has
the termerity to publish his letter
without his name ? Does the Student
Body want to know the facts yet stand
around waiting and not shouldering
its own responsibility ?
The Student Body can show up
either the Scaraboea or the "Sequoia"
editor. Both cannot lie right. Tf the
members of the Student. Body really
care how their affairs are run the best
way to show it is by looking into the
"Sequoia" charges and branding them
;is true or false. But if they don't
care, let us stop talking about it lest,
we hurt our chances in the next ath
letic contest.
