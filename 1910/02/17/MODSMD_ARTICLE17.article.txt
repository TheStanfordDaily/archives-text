# RECORDS ARE GRANTED
## EXECUTIVE BODY RECOGNIZES NEW MARKS AT MEETING. Woolley and Argabrite Are Each Credited With New Mark.â€”Ditz Appointed. 
### 
Two new Stanford records were
recognized officially by the Executive
Committee at their regular meeting
held last evening. The men to whom
these honors fall are J. E. Woolley,
'12, and A. M. Argabrite, '13. Woolley
is credited with a record in the ham
mer-throw of 140 feet, 3 inches, made
last year in the class-meet. The new
record for Stanford which will stand
opposite Argabrite's name, is that of
6 feet, 1 1-5 inches, in the high jump,
made at the first preliminary meet of
last semester. As a further idea in
this line it was the sense of the Com
mittee that in future in order to over
come the lengthly investigation that
has been necessary in the past when a
new record has been made, the cap
tain of the track team upon such an
occasion, shall sign a paper to tlrvt
effect, stating the man to be credited
with the new mark, the mark itself,
and any other necessary data, and
have the same countersigned by the
officials at the meet, or the judges of
the event in which the new record was
made.
As is the custom, the three men
representing the University in the
Carnot debate for 1910, instead of be
ing presented with a letter, were given
a gold medal suitably inscribed. The
men to receive the medal for partici
pating in this year's debate were G.
F. Morgan, '10, P. J. Patkin, '10, and
R. J. Miller, '11.

At a meeting held some time ago three
men were appointed from the tennis
enthusiasts of the University, to meet
a similar committee from the Univer
sity of California, and draw up a new
agreement to cover future intercol
legiate tennis contests. Owing to some
difficulties in the meeting of these
committees, it was decided last even
ing to revoke the powers of the origi
nal committee and place the tennis
clauses of the Intercollegiate Agree
ment in the hands of the regular com
mittee which is handling the agree
ment.
Because of the failure of C. H. Hails
to return to the University this sem
ester, it was necessary to fill the posi
tion of student representative on the
Hoard of the Stanford Union held by
him last semester. G. A. Ditz, '11, was
the man chosen by the Committee last
evening to fill that position.
