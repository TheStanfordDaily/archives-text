# Explosion Kills Five.
## 
### 
The sudden shock which was felt on
the campus this morning during the
10:15 hour and which was mistaken
by many for an earthquake, was
caused by the explosition of the ex
tensive powder works on Robert's Is
land, near San Lorenzo, a small town
across the bay. Five workmen were
known to be killed.
