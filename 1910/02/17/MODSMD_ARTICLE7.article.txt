# Warrick To Build Glider.
## 
### 
The task of drawing plans for the
glider which the Aero Club is to build
will fall upon G. F. Warrick, '12, of
Santa Monica, and not upon J. A.
Miller, as announced last night. The
plans will be entirely original, and it
will be possible to steer the glider.
The club will hear Prof. Durand
lecture in room 268, next Monday
evening at 8 o'clock.
