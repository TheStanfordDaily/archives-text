# TEAM MAKES HISTORY
## VARSITY SHOWS ITS METTLE IN 12-INNINGS AT ST. MARY'S Contest Is Lost, and 1910 Championship Out Of Possibilities. Tying Run in Ninth. 
### 
Anyone who would have said that
the Stanford baseball spirit was nil
yesterday at Oakland would have been
away off bis reckoning. The Cardinal
Varsity ga.ve the St. Mary's team a
battle that was a joy to watch. The
Phoenix men brought out their whole
fire department, from the hook and
ladder down, to win the game. And
when it came to a show-down, withthe
score 5-4, it was found that Ihe St.
Mary's cards were high. Gilfillan, on
the Varsity mound, after the seventh
inning, tightened up like a frozen
icicle, and was as cool as one, not
allowing a hit. He returned twelve
men to the bench on strikes and in the
twelve chapters reeled off, held Phoe
nix to six scant, singles, all of which
came in the first seven sessions. The
college men in the tenth were forced
to take Sheehy from the game and
substitute the awe-inspiring Wilcox.
The Varsity showed its hitting mettle
with a decided emphasis. Two
smashes for three sacks and five
pretty singles tell the story. McFad
den was again at the top of the list
here. One of the triples was marked
with his trade-mark, and his liner for
one bag in the eighth started the
merry-go-round that, put Stanford
two rungs higher on the ladder and
in the lead by one tally.
The contest, was easily the best
ball-playing that a Cardinal Varsity
has been able to show for two years,
with the exception of the seventeen
ining California game last, spring. Tt
is unfortunate that the deciding con
tests with St. Mary's came within the
first, three weeks of the Cardinal sea
son, and that the series with them is
now over. With two weeks more
practice it is difficult to say what
would have happened to the five-game
list with Phoenix. The Oakland men
realized wholly what was at stake
yesterday, and they played to win the
game as they seldom are forced to
perform. The five matches next year
should be more scattered through the
schedule, in order to give the Varsity
a fair chance for the championship.
This would be the case with both St.
Mary's and Santa Clara, in order that
the Cardinal may have three distinct
championship series instead of one.
The two Catholic College teams have
always fought hard and won the decid
ing game and have boasted of it. Four
more games are left, in the Santa
Clara series, one having already been
won by them. The Cardinal Varsity
promise to be an unusual one, and it
should at. least be able to even up
matters with the mission town players.

came in the first seven sessions. The
college men in the tenth were forced
to take Sheehy from the game and
substitute the awe-inspiring Wilcox.
The Varsity showed its hitting mettle
with a decided emphasis. Two
smashes for three sacks and five
pretty singles tell the story. McFad
den was again at the top of the list
here. One of the triples was marked
with his trade-mark, and his liner for
one bag in the eighth started the
merry-go-round that, put Stanford
two rungs higher on the ladder and
in the lead by one tally.
The contest, was easily the best
ball-playing that a Cardinal Varsity
has been able to show for two years,
with the exception of the seventeen
ining California game last, spring. Tt
is unfortunate that the deciding con
tests with St. Mary's came within the
first, three weeks of the Cardinal sea
son, and that the series with them is
now over. With two weeks more
practice it is difficult to say what
would have happened to the five-game
list with Phoenix. The Oakland men
realized wholly what was at stake
yesterday, and they played to win the
game as they seldom are forced to
perform. The five matches next year
should be more scattered through the
schedule, in order to give the Varsity
a fair chance for the championship.
This would be the case with both St.
Mary's and Santa Clara, in order that
the Cardinal may have three distinct
championship series instead of one.
The two Catholic College teams have
always fought hard and won the decid
ing game and have boasted of it. Four
more games are left, in the Santa
Clara series, one having already been
won by them. The Cardinal Varsity
promise to be an unusual one, and it
should at. least be able to even up
matters with the mission town players.

Anyone who would have said that
the Stanford baseball spirit was nil
yesterday at Oakland would have been
away off bis reckoning. The Cardinal
Varsity ga.ve the St. Mary's team a
battle that was a joy to watch. The
Phoenix men brought out their whole
fire department, from the hook and
ladder down, to win the game. And
when it came to a show-down, withthe
score 5-4, it was found that Ihe St.
Mary's cards were high. Gilfillan, on
the Varsity mound, after the seventh
inning, tightened up like a frozen
icicle, and was as cool as one, not
allowing a hit. He returned twelve
men to the bench on strikes and in the
twelve chapters reeled off, held Phoe
nix to six scant, singles, all of which
came in the first seven sessions. The
college men in the tenth were forced
to take Sheehy from the game and
substitute the awe-inspiring Wilcox.
