## Student Points Out That Stanford Union Is Mutter of Immediate Interest. 
### 
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
As a student who is deeply inter
ested in the establishment of a Stan
ford Union upon the campus, I wish
to answer a communnication that ap
peared previously in the columns of
your paper and to explain to the writer
of the same in what position the Union
now stands.
The Union is not a "matter of re
mote interest," as has been insinuated.
At the present time almost enough
money is in the hands of R. M. Barrett,
permanent secretary of the institution,
to warrant, the final drawing of plans
for the building and the letting of the
contract for the erection of the samp.
Approximately $21,500 has been sub
scribed toward this fund already, but
before operations can be actually com
menced those in charge of the estab
lishment of this institution feel that
they must have in their possession
$25,000 at least.
The Alumni and the faculty have
subscribed over $20,000 of the amount
on hand and the actual progress only
depends upon the interest that is to
be taken by the Student Body.
This interest must net the govern
ing committee enough to make up the
$25,000 before operations will be
started upon the building of the club
itself. As the students are interested,
this "matter of remote interest" is not
so remote as it may seem at first
glance. Definite plans for the govern
ing of the Union have already been
formulated and a constitution pre
pared in anticipation of the future
running of the institution. This was
published in the columns of the Daily
Palo Alto semester before last, and
may be found in the files of that paper
in full.
Such matters as the introduction of
facilities for dancing and the installing
of a complete restaurant are subjects
for future consideration. The present
pressing necessity that presents itself
before a Union can be started, is the
reducing of the deficiency in funds,
that now exists. This can be done
only through Student Body interest
and activity.
A STANFORD STUDENT.
