The Bugs have denied the charges.
It is now for the "Sequoia" to offer its
proof. Possibly, the magazine could
refuse and still live up to the exact
letter of its promise of February 11
by arguing that a statement signed

society is not "a statement signed by
its members." So technical an avoid
ance of the issue, however, would
heap criticism on the "Sequoia," and
the editor must now substantiate his
charges or let the undergraduates as
sume what they will from his per
sistent refusal to show his hand.
