# NOWELL REFUTES TALBOT
## "The Plain Stanford Man" Explains Position and Again Calls On "Sequoia" To Speak. 
### 
Editor "Daily Palo Alto:"
1 see from an article published by
a certain Mr. Talbot, that he has
either failed to read more of my ar
ticle than the heading and the signa
ture, or else overlooked my point.
This much I will say, Mr. Talbot,
you have advanced one step on your
way toward Salvation; a little more
Light and the Truth is yours. I agree
with you perfectly in that "the Stu
dent Body should assume the re
sponsibility which rightfully belongs
to the whole body." It was as a
member of that Student Body that I
spoke in my recent article. The
author of that article in the "Sequoia"
is upon the witness stand at his own
choosing. Let him either prove what
he has suggested and thus assist in
the work which he has begun, or
acknowledge that his articles were
for the benefit of the "Sequoia's" cir
culation. Otherwise, on account of
his silence, so far as he is concerned,
if. there be a Bug society, it stands
unconvicted for want of evidence;
and thus in all justice to it, the Stu
dent Body should regard it as inno
cent of the charges made. Thus the
controversy will be settled so far as
he is concerned. My remarks were
directed toward the author of the ar
ticles in the "Sequoia," who assumed
the responsibility of laying open to
view the "Inside of Stanford Politics,"
1 think I need not repeat that he
failed to do so. This writer made as
sertions which if proved true, mean
that we have among us certain men
who are a menace to the best in
terests of Stanford. Their names
should be made public, in order that
they may be kept out of the various
offices of the Student Body by the
votes thereof.
The writer of the "Sequoia" articles
shouldered the responsibility on his
own free will and accord so far as I
know. Then why does the respon
sibility of hunting out the members of
the Scaroboea society devolve upon
all the members of the Student Body ?
It is an old saying, but a true one,
that "Everybody's business is nobody's
business."
I for one pledge to him all the sup
port within my power when lie proves
his assertions true, and I think there
is more than one other "plain Stan
lord man" who will do the same.
I would like to make one remark
about the idea of "a scandal." It" you
undertake to sweep out a room which
has been accumulating dirt for some
time, you naturally expect ihe air to
lie filled with dust for a short time;
but when the dust settles the room is
clean. Just so with our politics. If
there is dirt to be cleaned out, de
pend upon it, there will be dust in the
air. but when we finish our labor we
can have the satisfaction of knowing
that we have clean politics.
Therefore, Stanford men, if you
know anything which will be of use In
cleaning up this muddle, make it
common property. Let us shoulder
this business like men should and
have it done with.
But again I repeat; let us hear from
the man of the "Sequoia" article.

clean. Just so with our politics. If
there is dirt to be cleaned out, de
pend upon it, there will be dust in the
air. but when we finish our labor we
can have the satisfaction of knowing
that we have clean politics.
Therefore, Stanford men, if you
know anything which will be of use In
cleaning up this muddle, make it
common property. Let us shoulder
this business like men should and
have it done with.
But again I repeat; let us hear from
the man of the "Sequoia" article.

Editor "Daily Palo Alto:"
1 see from an article published by
a certain Mr. Talbot, that he has
either failed to read more of my ar
ticle than the heading and the signa
ture, or else overlooked my point.
This much I will say, Mr. Talbot,
you have advanced one step on your
way toward Salvation; a little more
Light and the Truth is yours. I agree
with you perfectly in that "the Stu
dent Body should assume the re
sponsibility which rightfully belongs
to the whole body." It was as a
member of that Student Body that I
spoke in my recent article. The
author of that article in the "Sequoia"
is upon the witness stand at his own
choosing. Let him either prove what
he has suggested and thus assist in
the work which he has begun, or
acknowledge that his articles were
for the benefit of the "Sequoia's" cir
culation. Otherwise, on account of
his silence, so far as he is concerned,
if. there be a Bug society, it stands
unconvicted for want of evidence;
and thus in all justice to it, the Stu
dent Body should regard it as inno
cent of the charges made. Thus the
controversy will be settled so far as
he is concerned. My remarks were
directed toward the author of the ar
ticles in the "Sequoia," who assumed
the responsibility of laying open to
view the "Inside of Stanford Politics,"
1 think I need not repeat that he
failed to do so. This writer made as
sertions which if proved true, mean
that we have among us certain men
who are a menace to the best in
terests of Stanford. Their names
should be made public, in order that
they may be kept out of the various
offices of the Student Body by the
votes thereof.
The writer of the "Sequoia" articles
shouldered the responsibility on his
own free will and accord so far as I
know. Then why does the respon
sibility of hunting out the members of
the Scaroboea society devolve upon
all the members of the Student Body ?
It is an old saying, but a true one,
that "Everybody's business is nobody's
business."
I for one pledge to him all the sup
port within my power when lie proves
his assertions true, and I think there
is more than one other "plain Stan
lord man" who will do the same.
I would like to make one remark
about the idea of "a scandal." It" you
undertake to sweep out a room which
has been accumulating dirt for some
time, you naturally expect ihe air to
lie filled with dust for a short time;
but when the dust settles the room is
clean. Just so with our politics. If
there is dirt to be cleaned out, de
pend upon it, there will be dust in the
air. but when we finish our labor we
can have the satisfaction of knowing
that we have clean politics.
Therefore, Stanford men, if you
know anything which will be of use In
cleaning up this muddle, make it
common property. Let us shoulder
this business like men should and
have it done with.
But again I repeat; let us hear from
the man of the "Sequoia" article.
