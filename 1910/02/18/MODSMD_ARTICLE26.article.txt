# Final Date for "Quad" Copy Set.
## 
### 
Although most of the organiza
tions on the campus have submitted
their copy to the 1911 "Quad" there
yet remain a few which have failed to
do so. Monday evening has been set
by the editor of the Quad as the last
date when copy will be received. The
lists of officers and members can
either be mailed to the "Quad" or
given to F. H. Hilton.
