## Local Writers Fail to Resubmit Manuscripts To Junior Committee. Sampson Will Appear. 
### 
The failure of any of the local opera
writers to resubmit their manuscripts
to the Junior committee caused that
board this afternoon to decide to pro
duce a professional opera. The exact
choice will be announced on Monday,
and the cast and chorus will be select
ed Tuesday. TJie committee has now
under consideration Gilbert and Sulli
van's "Pirates of Penzance." Chair
man Woodville left for San Francisco
today to endeavor to secure a musical
director who will take charge of 11u>
chorus early in the coming week.
The committee has succeeded in in
ducing C. E. Sampson, '09, the Varsity
ball player, to take part in the opera.
Sampson has a rich, deep bass, but
heretofore has had no time to devote
to dramatics. L. Y. Mattes, '09, will
probably have a tenor role.
