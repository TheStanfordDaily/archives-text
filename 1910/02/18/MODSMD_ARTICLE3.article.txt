# "BUGS" DENY CHARGES
## SOCIETY SAYS "SEQUOIA" ATTACK WHOLLY GROUNDLESS. Scaraboea Gives Reasons For Not Answering Sooner and Purpose of Present Reply. 
### 
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
We, the so-called "Rag Society,"
hereby absolutely deny each and every
charge that, lias been brought against
ns in the recent numbers of the
"Sequoia,"
This society has not made the denial
sooner for two reasons:
1. We have not cared to make our
selves a party to a controversy which
future Stanford men will look upon ay
the most childish and petty political
effort in the history of the University.
2. Knowing that all these charges
are groundless in fact, we have fell
certain that when the "evidence" was
brought forth, the entire Student
Body would realize the fallacy and in
consistency of the "Sequoia's" position.
The "Sequoia's" futule and ludicrous
attempt in its second article to escape
the enigma in which it lias placed it
self has confirmed us in the belief that
had the "Sequoia" offered its "proof,"
it would have been unnecessary for
us to make any statement.
We now make this denial for the
following reason:
The editor of the "Sequoia" stated
in the Daily Palo Alto on February 11
that "should the Scaraboea society, in
a statement signed by the member*,
deny the charges as made, he would
present his evidence in substantia
tion of the assertions of the 'Sequoia'
attacking that organization." In or
der that the editor may proceed with
his "expose", we lend this necessary
assistance.
The statements made impeaching
the integrity of practically all leaders
in Stanford activities for the past
three years are of such a serious na
ture that they should be either re
tracted or proven. We agree with the
"Sequoia" when it says:"This har
monious spirit will never prevail as
long as political rings are allowed to
exist," and we therefore hope that in
clearing up this controversy we may
be of some assistance to that publi
cation and to the Student Body in dis
covering and suppressing any political
rings which may exist but which the
"Sequoia" has not yet pointed out.
The further prolongation of this
affair will only result in continued un
rest and the expenditure of much
time and thought which should be
given to University work. We con
sequently urge that the proofs be
brought forth at once.
"Sequoia"-called Bug Society.
