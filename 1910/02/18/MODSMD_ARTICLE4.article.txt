# STUDENTS BLAMELESS
## MORGAN AND SHELTON FULLY EXONERATED. Editor, Reporter, Professors and Debaters Brand Charges As Unqualified Lie. 
### 
Completely exonerated in every de
tail, G. F. Morgan, '10, and J. E. Shel
ton, '10, returned to the campus from
Berkeley this morning after tracing
the scurrilous tale about them to its
source and compelling the editor of
the Berkeley "Independent" to admit
the lie. it appears that there is abso
lutely no foundation for Ihe charges
that Shelton and Morgan wilfully
broke the Carnot rules by consulting
together after the question had been
announced. The story seems to have
been ludicrously enlarged by an un
balanced reporter from a slight and
unimportant discussion over some
rule, which lasted but a moment and
was then settled to the satisfaction of
all concerned. Hearing of this in
cident, one Van Becker, a California
student who works for the "Oakland
Tribune," and the "San Francisco
Call," proceeded to draw upon his
apparently fertile imagination to such
an alarming extent that, the recent
unmitigated fabrication resulted. Van
Becker gave his startling tale to a re
porter of the "Independent" and the
"Oakland Tribune," who proceeded to
write the article. He has promised to
investigate the charges and publish
retraction in the latter paper.
Editor Danforth, of the "Indepen
dent," at the request of Morgan and
Shelton, signed a statement to the
effect that the entire story was a lie
from beginning to end.
Before the two Stanford men
reached Professor Flaherty, he had al
ready branded the tale as false in the
columns of the"Daily Californian."
As chairman of the faculty committee,
Flaherty gave a similar signed state
ment. to Shelton and Morgan.
Durry, who won the debate, affixed
his name to a paper in which he said
that Morgan had made no apology,
and that none had been expected be
cause no one had done anything on
account of which an apology might be
forthcoming.
Professor Wells, who presided over
the Carnot contest last Saturday, de
sired to know if the story were pos
sibly to be traced to a student, as in
that case he wished to take the matter
before the proper university authori
ties.
Durry and Kasch, two of the Blue
and Gold debaters, assisted Morgan
and Shelton in every way in solving
the entanglement and expressed the
greatest, regret that the incident had
occured.
In its issue of February 17. the
Palo Alto "Tribune" publishes a letter
from Drury, stating that there was no
foundation to the "Independent" ar
ticle which the "Tribune" had copied
the previous evening.
