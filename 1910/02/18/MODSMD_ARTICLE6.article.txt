# TO HOLD SECOND MEET
## VARSITY AND FRESHMAN TRACK MEN TO CONTEST. Meet Will Start At 11 O'clock Saturday. .All Races Will Be Over Full Distance. 
### 
On Saturday morning the nimble
footed athletes, and others who may
enter, will be given another oppor
tunity to show their worth upon the
cinder path. It is not expected that
any of the contestants will equal
Duffy's records for the dashes nor
show SmitUson's ability in the hur
dles, and, strange to say, "Dad''
modestly declines to admit his belief
that any of the old marks will be
shattered beyond repair, yet enough
close contests are assured to make
the meet an interesting one for the
spectators.
The starting gun for the first event
will be fired promptly at 11 o'clock
and will not be delayed beyond that
time for any reason. Instead of the
novices and old men running in sep
arate heats as in the last meet, to
morrow 110 distinction will be made,
except possibly in the sprints. If
enough Freshmen enter the dashes,
Captain Scott intends to divide the
men as before.
As the first Freshman meet will be
held one week from Saturday the full
distance will be traveled in all the
races in order to give the first-year
runners an idea of what it means to
cover the ground. No fear of the men
breaking down in the longer races is
entertained by Trainer Moulton as a
sufficient length of time has been
spent in training to put the majority
of the candidates in fairly good shaper
for the trials.
The members of the 1913 track team
scheduled to meet St. Mary's next
week are to be picked from the Fresh
men making the best showing tomor
row. Since final heats are to be run
in all events, it is probable that the
results of the races will have consid
erable weight in determining the com
position of the Varsity team which is
to take the Southern trip.
