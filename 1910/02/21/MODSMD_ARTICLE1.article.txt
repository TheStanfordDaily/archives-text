# ASSEMBLY ON FRIDAY
## EXERCISES UNDER AUSPICES OF STUDENT COMMITTEE. Local Board That Is Managing Stanford Union On Campus Secures Assembly For 10:15 
### 
The date of the next Assembly has
been set by the Committee on Public
Exercises, although the gathering it
self is not to be under the auspices,
or the program arranged by the fac
ulty committee. This coming Assem
bly, which has been set for Friday
morning at 10:15, will be under the
management of the student committee
that was appointed last semester for
the purpose of collecting funds upon
the campus for the benefit of the Stan
ford Union. This board requested the
Faculty Committee on Public Exer
cises that an Assembly be granted to
them at that hour and the result has
been that the students will conduct
and control the coming gathering.
This makes it essentially a student As
sembly in the interests of the Stanford
Union.
The students who have this project
in charge upon the campus felt, that
there were many in the Student Body
who were not intimately cognizant
with the prospects and the plans of
the Union and who have not realized
that already the Union is a reality.
This board of students has also an
nounced that there are many in the
University who are willing to sub
stantially assist, this movement if they
were given an opportunity. For this
reason the committee has planned to
meet all the requests that have been
made with reference to the Union.
This effort to increase the interest
that is taken by the students in the
institution follows the successful re
sults that have attended the raising
of funds among the Alumni and the
faculty. Although the building of the
Stanford Union is directly for the
benefit of the students in the Univer
sity, they do not seem to realize the
importance of the club, according to
the opinion of the student committee,
and the present Assembly is to be con
ducted primarily for the purpose of
rousing the interest, that should be
taken in the movement.
Being a student Assembly and a
movement that has been started by the
students themselves, the committee in
charge of the exercises anticipates
an unusually large attendance in tne
Assembly Hall at that hour.
Various speakers, who are intimate
ly acquainted with tlie importance and
the progress of the plans for the
Union, are to be secured by the com
mittee and an exceptionally interest
ing Assembly is promised.
