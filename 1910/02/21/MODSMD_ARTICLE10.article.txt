# HORINE SETS RECORD
## ARGABRITE'S MARK IN HIGH JUMP BEATEN. Second Try-outs Of Season In Track Are Successful.— More Varsity Men Appear. 
### 
As far as sensational results went
the second preliminary meet of the
year on the Stanford oval was a suc
cess. The bleachers had the oppor
tunity of seeing the Stanford record
in the high jump give place to another
for the second time since the opening
of college last August. G. L. Horine,
'13, erased the mark made by W. M.
Argabrite, '13. in the fall, and set up
his own record of 6 feet 1% inches,
within 71-100 of an inch of the Pacific
Coast record made three years ago by
Channing Hall, of the University of
California. This latter mark should
also go by the board in the near
future, since Horine is approaching
perfection in handling himself, in the
jump. Argabrite did not take part in
the meet Saturday, since lie is still
suffering from a bad ankle. The
names of more Varsity men appeared
in the lists in this second meet than
in the initial one. Wyman circled
the path in very good time in the 440,
53 1-5 seconds; Horton appeared in
the shot put, making a tape showing
of 40 feet 6 inches. Captain Scott
competed for the first time this semes
ter in the vault. He (lid not try for
any appreciable height, however. Sev
eral veterans were not in suits, dis
appointing the onlookers, who ex
pected them io get into trim in this
meet.
The broad jump brought to light a
condition that is extremely rosy for
the future. C. H. Tallant., '11, on his
first leap in the finals of the event,
made 21 feet, 6 inches. Previous to
this he has been doing around 20
feet. His jump Saturday places him
in varsity class immediately, and
raises tip the Cardinal's hopes for
next April one more notch.
Several of the Freshmen who made
such good time in the competition of
a week ago were not on the track, and
consequently the showing of the
novices is not as emphatic as before.
The meet was handled in fast time,
the officials carrying out their work
with few delays. Even better work is
assured in the future, according to
plans now maturing.
