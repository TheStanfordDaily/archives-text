# WOMEN GET THE MEASLES.
## Miss H. Park and Miss A. Guthrie Are Under Quarantine, Suffering With Disease. 
### 
Not to be outdone by the masculine
element, iu the University the women
can now boast of two full-fledged cases
of measles. The first case was re
ported on Saturday when Miss H.
Park, '11, was quarantined in Roble.
Miss Park had been ill for about six
days but did not deem it necessary to
discontinue her work in the Univer
sity until Friday. Previous to that the
infection may have spread alarmingly.
Miss A. Guthrie, '11, was discovered
to be a victim of the epidemic this
morning and was immediately iso
lated in her room at Madrona. The
Guild has taken charge of the new
cases but it is greatly handicapped in
its work through the lack of hospital
facilities.
