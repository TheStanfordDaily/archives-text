# Relay Race Is Stirring.
## 
### 
The ghost of last St. Patrick's Day
Marathon would have turned green
with envy if it, had hut seen the relay
carnival on Saturday after the track
meet. A certain eatinu; club, called
the Breakers, brought home the bacon,
but teams representing Dolt:'. Upsilon
and Beta Theta Pi are reported as hav
ing finished later in the day.
