# JUNIOR OPERA CHOSEN
## PROFESSIONAL FIELD WILL SUPPLY CLASS PLAY. Gilbert and Sullivan's "Iolanthe" Selected By Committee.â€” Herman Perlet Retained. 
### 
After an exhaustive and careful con
sideration of various light operas,
both amateur and professional, the
Junior Opera Committee has finally
selected a play that will meet all the
requirements of that board. Gilbert
and Sullivan's successful light opera,
"lolanthe," has been chosen by the
committee.
The Juniors were compelled to go
into the professional field for a satis
factory play, but their action was only
taken after the most careful consider
ation and study of the student produc
tions that were submitted for the re
view of the committee. Among the
professional operas that were con
sidered by the committee, "lolanthe"
was the only vehical that was entirely
satisfactory for a production with
student material.
Herman Perlet, who comes to the
Coast with an enviable musical rec
ord and who has succeeded in estab
lishing an excellent reputation in the
West in the musical world will act in
conjunction with Coach Matliieu in
developing and finishing the opera.
Mr. Perlet's services were retained by
the committee for the purpose of
directing the singing and the musical
part of the opera exclusively. His
work will be distinct from that done
by Mathieu, who is to direct the acting
of the principals alone.
The newly engaged director has had
an extensive experience in the train
ing of casts for various productions
and is ably fitted to handle the work
for which he has been secured. Perlet
has occupied the position of musical
director in New York for the past
twenty-five years, ten of which he has
spent as musical director of the Schu
bert Syndicate. He has not only
coached light operas, but lie has devel
oped grand opera also.
The Junior committee has been very
fortunate in securing the services of
Perlet, as he has retired from pro
fessional work of this nature since
his advent upon the Coast.
