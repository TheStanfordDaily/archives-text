# QUESTION SUBMITTED
## INTERCOLLEGIATE DEBATE WILL BE ON SUFFRAGE QUESTION. Stanford Speakers To Determine Which Side They Wish To Uphold. Try-outs Begin Soon. 
### 
Women of the University in general
anil the Equal Suffrage League in par
ticular kindly take notice ! The Uni
versity of California has submitted the
following question for the Intercol
legiate Debate: "Resolved, That in
the United States the suffrage should
be extended to women." If the women
of the University wish to be identified
with debating activities, now is the
time of times to try-out for the Inter
collegiate team. By so doing, they will
not only be rendering service to their
Alma Mater, but will be bringing wom
ankind in general just that much near
er to the goal of Equal Rights and
that through their own efforts, too.
The only qualification to this splen
did chance is the possibility that the
University Debating Society, which
has the choosing of the side which
the Cardinal will uphold may be so
horrid as to choose the negative. How
ever, let there be hope for the best,
for it v/iil bo more than a week before
the final decision is made. The try
outs will be held after this and then
the selected team has until the night
before the Intercollegiate track meet
to work upon the question. The de
bate will be held upon that evening in
Assembly Hall.
The members of the Intersoeiety De
bating League who have the try-outs
in charge desire those who are going
to try for the team to hand in their
names to them immediately. If a large
number enter a preliminary try-out
will be held.
