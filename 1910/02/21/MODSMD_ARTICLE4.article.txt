# ERRORS DEFEAT TEAM
## TWO INNINGS SEE VARSITY'S TOTAL MISTAKES. Reed Pitches Good Ball First Five Chapters, But Weakens In Sixth and Seventh. 
### 
Two bad innings gave Santa Clara
its second victory over the Varsity on
Saturday by the score of 7-4, on the
turf of Stanford Field. During the
two chapters Ave errors, all that were
made by the Varsity in the game, and
I four hits, of which one was a quad
j rtiple-sacker played the role than
| found the Cardinal team at the end of
i the play one game less in the "won"
column. Up to the sixth frame the
Varsity was at the head of the pro
cession with a worry-dispelling lead
jof three runs, while the Santa Clara
I side of the board was free of chalk.
| The sixth and seventh chapters devel
! oped into two very emphatic Water
i loos for the university men, however,
and the line of tallies for the visitors
j assumed the alarming proportions of
seven, their total for the contest.
There was no reason for it, except that
Reed, after handling five sessions on
the mound like a leaguer, weakened
and allowed the mission men two hits
in succession at a critical time. This,
assisted by a carnival of errors, start
ed the parade around the bases that
didn't end until fifteen players had
held a bat over the plate, and made
sure of the game with their seven
runs. For four innings previously
Santa Clara had been retired one, two.
three, and the Varsity seemed too
much for them. Agneu was very much
in evidence in the strike-out column,
having eleven Cardinal victims there.
He did not transport a single Varsity
player, and was efficient all the way
around, with the exception of hits.
Here Stanford displayed a batting
eye in accordance with the reputation
of the past six games, and five easy
singles and a triple-sacker made up
the total.
Ball showed a slight improvement in
his throws to the rectangular can
vases, and performed satisfactorily
behind the platter.
How the Varsity runs were scored:
Beeger, first up in the second had a
short story. Hit by Agneu he tore
home when Ganong clouted to the
next county for three. Score, 1-0.
The second saw Reed's hit. He made
the keystone and third on McGovern's
error, when S. Mitchell's grounder
was booted by the mission short-stop.
Both came home when McFadden
singled. Score, 3-0.
Reed tallied again in the eighth on
his second hit. Salberg tried to re
tire him on fielder's choice on McGreg
or's grounder, but the ball went into
j the brush on the throw, the two men
taking an extra base. McFadden again
| used the right judgment on an Agneu
j twister and brought in Reed, McGreg
! or being caught out at the last station.

the mound like a leaguer, weakened
and allowed the mission men two hits
in succession at a critical time. This,
assisted by a carnival of errors, start
ed the parade around the bases that
didn't end until fifteen players had
held a bat over the plate, and made
sure of the game with their seven
runs. For four innings previously
Santa Clara had been retired one, two.
three, and the Varsity seemed too
much for them. Agneu was very much
in evidence in the strike-out column,
having eleven Cardinal victims there.
He did not transport a single Varsity
player, and was efficient all the way
around, with the exception of hits.
Here Stanford displayed a batting
eye in accordance with the reputation
of the past six games, and five easy
singles and a triple-sacker made up
the total.
Ball showed a slight improvement in
his throws to the rectangular can
vases, and performed satisfactorily
behind the platter.
How the Varsity runs were scored:
Beeger, first up in the second had a
short story. Hit by Agneu he tore
home when Ganong clouted to the
next county for three. Score, 1-0.
The second saw Reed's hit. He made
the keystone and third on McGovern's
error, when S. Mitchell's grounder
was booted by the mission short-stop.
Both came home when McFadden
singled. Score, 3-0.
Reed tallied again in the eighth on
his second hit. Salberg tried to re
tire him on fielder's choice on McGreg
or's grounder, but the ball went into
j the brush on the throw, the two men
taking an extra base. McFadden again
| used the right judgment on an Agneu
j twister and brought in Reed, McGreg
! or being caught out at the last station.
