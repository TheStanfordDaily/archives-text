## APRIL 2 TO WITNESS INTER-CLUB REGATTA. California and Lagunita Will Row On Estuary.â€”Probable Contest With Washington. 
### 
A letter received by President J. C.
Huston, '10, of the Lagunita Boat Club,
from the University of California Boat
ing Association practically assures the
holding of a four-oared shell race be
tween crews representing the two
clubs. The race will probably be
rowed on April 2, the day of the sec
ond intercollegiate baseball game ai
Berkeley, over a mile and a half
straight-a-way course on the Oakland
Estuary. Plans for an eight-oared
race have not been abandoned, and it
is possible that one may be arranged
for the same day.
Washington University has written
concerning the possibility of an eight
oared crew going north to row against
their eight and one from Wisconsin
University on May 20 over the Lake
Washington course. As this date is
only one day after the last final ex
aminations of the semester here, it
will be impossible for the local crew
to compete unless the race is post
poned at least a week. President Hus
ton in his reply will suggest that this
be done. With this postponement the
Lagunita crew would scarcely have
time in which to train over the course
before the day of the race.
Nothing definite has been done as
yet concerning the offer received from
the San Diego club for a regatta to bo
held during the Easter vacation.
