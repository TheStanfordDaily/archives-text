# TO PLAY ALL-STARS TOMORROW.
## Third Game With Santa Clara Wednesday. â€”Junior-Sophomore Game Is Postponed. 
### 
Manager Burbank has managed to
secure amusement, for Washington's
Birthday, the All-Stars being sched
uled to cross bats with the Varsity
tomorrow afternoon. The game will
be called at. 2:30 on the turf field.
Because of the fact that the Varsity
needed the field for practice this after
noon, the final game of the inter-class
series, which was to have been played
this afternoon, has been postponed
until Wednesday, when it will be
played on the turf at 4:15.
The third game of the series with
Santa Clara is to be played next Wed
nesday afternoon, when the Varsity
nine is scheduled to meet the Jesuites
in the mission town. Unless the Var
sity succeeds in winning, the series
will then go to Santa Clara, which
has already won two of the games.
Gilfillan, Kelly and Jones will take
turns in the box for the Cardinal.
