# PLANS NOVEL EVENTS
## JUNIOR DAY FESTIVITIES TO BE NEW AND NUMEROUS. Singing On Lake, Water Polo and Inter-class Marathon Race Will Be Among the Features. 
### 
Numerous innovations have been in
troduced into the program that the
Junior Day Committee has prepared
for the final festivities of Junior Week
this year, including not only various
new athlethic events, but also plans
for a musical evening at Lake Lagu
nita.
The Junior activities will be inaug
urated this year by an evening of
music on Wednesday, March 16. For
this purpose the committee has se
cured the services of the Mandolin and
the Guitar Clubs, who have promised
to render a number of selections dur
ing the evening. To augment this
music, the Junior Day Committee has
requested that all Juniors be at the
lake upon that evening to assist in the
singing. This is a distinct innovation
and the Junior board earnestly de
sires that the class will assist them in
establishing this new event as a cus
tom to be permanently incorporated
in Junior Week festivities.
Besides the usual swimming, high
diving and canoe races that are to be
held upon the morning of Friday,
March IS, the committee has included
a water-polo game, tight-rop* walking
contests, tilting exhibitions under var
ious conditions and circumstances,
while the canoe races this year are to
be varied by introducing double and
single-manned canoes into the races.
This series of events will be exclusive
of the regular four oared interclass
crew races that are held upon the
lake every year at this time. All those
who desire to try out for the polo team
are requested by the committee to sub
mit their names to W. S. Porter. K. L.
Dole. W. M. Wyman, J. D. Rutledge or
F. C. Brown within the next few days,
as arrangements must be made for
practice for the coming game.
Any student anticipating going into
the various racing events or into any
of the contests that have been ar
ranged for, must submit their names
to the above committee at an early
date. The committee has secured
numerous prizes, which will! be given
to the winners of the different contests
during the day.
The University Band has signified
its willingness to be present during
the morning and to give their services
during that. time.
It is highly probable that the annual
interclass relay race, will be held upon
the afternoon of Friday, March IS,
serving as a final event of the athletic
features of Junior Week. The Quad
rangle Club has signified its willing
ness to have the event occur at that
time. Being held upon March 18 will
exclude those in the Freshman Class
who are upon the track, as the Inter
collegiate track meet occurs the fol
lowing day. but with a team from the
hold-overs, who are still in evidence,
the meet, -will furnish four fairly
matched teams.
