# WILL NOT USE DISGUISES.
## Base Report Spreads As To Purpose of Many Costumes Secured For "Secret Service." 
### 
The Sophomore play committee
wishes to state through the columns
of the Daily Palo Alto that there is
absolutely no truth in the report that
they are obtaining costumes in San
Francisco to disguise the members of
the cast. It is strenuously asserted
that the Sophomore actors need no dis
guise, their conduct being above re
proach. as is also their presentation of
"Secret Service."
The members of the committee feel
deeply injured at the baseless rumors
in circulation concerning the where
fores of their purchase of costumes
and are much concerned over the way
in which the Student Body will inter
pret the matter. They feel assured,
however, that the histrionic abilities of
the members of the class of 1912 can
not. be hidden by any device whatso
ever.
The identity of the culprit who origi
nated the story is not known but he
evidently manufactured it out of whole
cloth, a yard wide. Although it is
meanly hinted by some that the mem
bers of the cast, might be glad to hide
behind something, let not this fore
boding disturb the hearts of those
gentle souls who have already pur
chased tickets, as the actors will all
be on the stage, or near it. when the
curtain rises Friday night.
