The Stanford Union Assembly on Fri
day is distinctly a student's meeting,
designed to instruct the undergradu
ates as to the plans and purposes of
the Stanford Union. That actual build
ing is not a matter of the distant fu
ture we have been assured, and ac
cordingly the present student is di
rectly interested in the institution and
most of us will receive its benefits be
fore we leave. Material aid from the
Student Body is the sole remaining
necessity. The Alumni have already
done more than their share, anil the
speakers at Friday's Assembly will
endeavor to show the undergraduates
how they will get more than their
money's worth in return for any as
sistance given.
