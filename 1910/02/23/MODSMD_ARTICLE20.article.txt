# NESTORIA HEARS WOODWARD.
## Head Of Law School Gives Views On Reform Measures.â€”Recall Question Debated. 
### 
Despite the fact that yesterday was
a holiday, Nestoria Literary society
held an enthusiastic meeting last
evening. The feature of the evening's
program was an address by Prof. F. C.
Woodward, of the Law School, who
gave an exceedingly interesting talk
upon late legislative tendencies, par
ticularly the initiative, referendum,
and recall. The speaker was of the
opinion that these radical measures
would be entirely unnecessary if the
American people would change their
methods of choosing their public of
ficials. He held that the best way to
secure a competent public service in
city and state affairs would be to elect
only the chief executive and allow him
to select all of his department lieuten
ants. In this way it would be possible
for the people to know exactly the
merits of the man who was to stand
primarily responsible for the govern
ment. and having this knowledge, they
would also know the character and
abilities of the subordinates in the
administrative forces.
Preceding Prof. Woodward's ad
dress. a lively debate was held upon
the subject: "Resolved, That the re
call should be invoked upon Mayor
McCarthy of San Francisco." A. C.
Bradford. '13, and M. Y. Malone, '10,
held that the Mayor should be re
moved from office, while C. A. Christin,
'11. and F. H. Hilton, '11, maintained
that he should be allowed to retain
his office.
