# Utah Will Meet Stanford.
## 
### 
Preparations are being made for the
Stanford track delegation to take part
in the annual Great Western Confer
ence meet which is held at Chicago
this spring. As usual, the local men
are arranging to meet the University
of Utah, and Colorado on their way
east, and in this way partially pay
their expenses.
The University of Utah on Februrav
10. heartily sanctioned the repetition
of these plans and agreed to make
preparations for a competitive meet
for approximately May 24.
