# STRONG DEBATERS TO CONTEST.
## Stanford Will Have Formidable Team In Coming Annual Intercollegiate Debate. 
### 
Now that the Intercollegiate debat
ing question has been submitted and
the try-outs planned, the chances of
Stanford are prepossessingly bright.
Four veterans of former Intercollegiate
teams are to enter the lists, as well as
numerous speakers of less fame. From
this field an extremely able trio will be
selected. The veterans who will enter
include J. E. Shelton, '10, P. J. Bat
kin, '10, G. F. Morgan, '10, and R. J.
Miller, '11. Of these Shelton has by
far the most enviable record, as he has
himself captured the Carnot medal
and* been a member of another vic
torious Carnot and a winning Inter
collegiate team.
Other well-known speakers who will
try out are F. H. Hilton, '11, G. Hol
comb, '11, W. S. Porter, '11, N. C. Wil
son, '12, M. E. Grimes, '12, and F. E.
Hill, '11. All of these men have had
much experience and may surprise
their veteran opponents.
