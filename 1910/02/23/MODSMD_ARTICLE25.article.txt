### 
The benefit dance given last Monday
night by Skull and Snakes was a tre
mendous success in every way. Ap
proximately two hundred people
danced to the strains of Brohaska's
orchestra over the smooth floor of the
new Armory. The hall was found to
be excellent for large dances and
should prove an incentive towards the
holding of more informals of this
character. Exact figures are not ob
tainable as yet, but it is expected that
a substantial sum will be added to the
Stanford Union fund as a result of the
dance.
