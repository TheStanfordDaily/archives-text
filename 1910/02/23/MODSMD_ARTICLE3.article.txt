# REED'S RECORD TO BE ALLOWED.
## Utah Officials Certify As To Correctness of Cardinal Sprinter's Time At Provo. 
### 
'"Dad" Moulton has the papers but
he denies being a villian. They ar
rived a few days ago from Utah and
prove conclusively that H. E. Reed. '10,
in a meet with the University of Utah,
at Provo, last May, covered the 100-
yard dash in the even time of 10 flat.
The documents consist of affidavits
from the timers and other officials at
the meet certifying that the Stanford
man was timed correctly and ran the
race over a full measured course.
The evidence has been submitted to
the Executive committee which will
probably give Reed the Stanford rec
ord at the meeting tonight. The old
mark was 10:1, held jointly by H. L.
Hamilton, '04, J. R. Holman, '09, H. E.
Reed, '10, and T. L. Coleman, '12.
Reed has signified his intention of
again taking up track work this spring
and will begin steady training the lat
ter part of March. He is at present on
the baseball squad and is also taking
part in cross-country runs so only a
few weeks of training will be required
to put the speedy sprinter in condi
tion for the Intercollegiate contest.
