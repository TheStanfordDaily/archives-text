# IRELAND TO BE HERE
## HIS INDEPENDENTS WILL PLAY VARSITY TOMORROW. Several Changes Among Cardinal's. Gaming and Gilfillan For Battery. Ball at First. 
### 
The jovial Ireland will bring his
band of leaguers to the campus to
morrow for the second time this sea
son. A week ago the Independent's
shelved the Varsity, 10-9, and a good,
stiff game is always forthcoming for
the Cardinals from these super-stars,
with "15. C." at the tiller. The visit
ing nine will have the usual headliners
as stimulators of the box-office, and
jokes will run riot along the first base
line with the San Francisco captain in
the coaching box. There will "Dick"
Eagon, the Tri-State Leaguer; "Doc"
Moskimon, of the California State
League and the American Association;
Spencer from the Coast League lists;
Swayne. of the Northwestern League;
"Jimmy" Byrnes, from Sacramento
State League and the 1907 Philadel
phia team; "Bull" Perrine, the pitch
er; and the gladiator mound-artist,
Goslinsky.
The Varsity is to present a changed
battle-front to the student fans. Gan
ong has been shifted to the rear-plat
ter position, and his fine throwing arm
promises to reduce the chalk marks
in the "stolen base" column of oppos
ing players. This position is one that
Ganong has become thoroughly ac
quainted with in past years, and he
should be able to unravel the kinks in
the opponent's strategy with ease.
Ball takes Ganong's old place at the
initial sack, and here he is sure to
show some form worth seeing. Gil
fillan will make out the menu to be
served up to the Independents to
morrow, and since he has not been in
the box for a week he should make
even the veterans of Captain Ireland
look to their batting laurels. Other
mound men from the string at Coach
Presley's disposal may be put into the
game later in the day. The rest, of the
infield will be the same as usual, and
with Ball the quartet will be a fast
one. The outer grass positions are
not as yet very stable. Probably six
men will cover the ground out there
at different, times.
The contest will be on the turf at
4 :15, admission 25 cents.
