# Annual Parade Enlivens Holiday.

### 
The custom of holding a ludicrous
parade of queerly costumed students
on the morning of Washington's Birth
day was continued yesterday when
somewhat less than 100 undergradu
ates, crazily clad, marched around the
campus to the accompaniment, of dis
couragingly discordant "music."
