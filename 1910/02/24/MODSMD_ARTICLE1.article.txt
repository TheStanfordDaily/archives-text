# WILL ADVANCE UNION
## STUDENT ASSEMBLY TOMORROW MORNING AT 10:15. Development Of Movement For Anticipated Club House Will Be Discussed At Gathering. 
### 
Tomorrow morning at 10:15, one of
the most unique Assemblies that have
ever heen held in Assembly Hall, will
take place under the auspices of the
student committee that is raising
funds for the Stanford Union. This is
a student Assembly, asked for by the
students and managed entirely by
them, for the purpose of advancing
the interests of the building of this
clubhouse upon the campus. The
Stanford Union plans have shown re
markable progress within the past,
few months, but a new definite impe
tus is to come from the Student Body
tomorrow, according to the opinion of
the committee that has this Assembly
in charge.
Three speakers have been secured
by the students for the Assembly, in
cluding one professor and two stu
dents who have consented to address
the Student Body upon this subject.
Professor C. D. Marx, head of the De
partment of Civil Engineering and
chairman of the larger committee that
is now carrying on a campaign for
the raising of money for this project,
has agreed to speak to the Assembly,
while Student Advisor, A. E. Roth, '09,
and Student Body President J. E.
Shelton, '10, will also talk upon this
topic. The three speeches will deal
especially with the importance of a
Union of this nature at Stanford and
the uses that an institution of this
kind can be put to under the manage
ment of the student members of the
club. Also the possibility of estab
lishing special features in the club
will be discussed by the various
speakers.
The student committee that has
charge of the Assembly has requested
that the various classes occupy dis
tinctive places in the Assembly Hall.
All hold-overs have been asked to
take seats in the front of the hall
upon the right, while men in the
Senior class have been apportioned
places directly behind these older men.
The Junior class will be seated upon
the left front of the hall and the class
of 1013 will occupy the seats directelv
behind the Junior class. The Sopho
mores will be assigned seats in the
rear of the Seniors. The committee
has made an urgent request that this
seating arrangement be strictly ob
served by the various classes, as a
part of the program of the Assembly
will depend upon the observance of
this plan.
