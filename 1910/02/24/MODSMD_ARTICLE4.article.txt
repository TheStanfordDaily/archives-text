# SOPHOMORES IN "SECRET SERVICE"
## Gillette's Tense Drama of the Civil War Will Be Played to Packed House In Assembly Hall Friday Evening. 
### 
Stanford will be
transported tomorrow evening from
the sunny terraces of Sorrento as
pictured in"The Man from Home" to
the storm center of a great civil war,
where the discouraged forces of the
Confederacy make their last desperate
stand against the victorious Northern
ers. In "Secret Service" William Gil
lette has utilized a somewhat hack
neyed theme in such a way as to pro
duce a drama of exceptional strength
and interest. The old elements of love
and war, secret intrigue, plot and
counterplot have been woven by him
into a fascinating and absorbing story
which is all the more delightful he
cause of the distinctive and original
manner in which the plot is developed.
While "Secret Service" is radically
different in style from the plays for
merly produced by the Sophomore
class it should be all the more wel
come for that reason since it serves
to add to the variety of the local pro
ductions, no drama of this character
having been produced at Stanford for
some years. While the play does not
savor of the melo-drama it presents a
series of powerful dramatic situations
which command an intense interest at
all times.
A competent cast, sumptuous scenic
effects and expert coaching preseage
a production tomorrow evening which
will be on a par with even polished
performances that, have recently been
seen in Assembly Hall. Great care
has been exercised in securing both
costumes and scenery in order that a
genuine war-time atmosphere might
be created. Special drops have been
painted by Lyon of San Francisco to
represent the Varney home in Rich
mond and the telegraph office at the
Confederate headquarters, the action
of the play being confined to these
two places.
R. H. Seward will take the lead, ap
pearing as Cajitain Varney. He is
peculiarly well fitted both by natural
abilities and experience to undertake
this role, which protrays a northern
soldier in the character of a spy oper
ating within the Confederate lines.
Seward is one of the most prominent
thespians of his class having appeared
in practically every performance since
he entered college and his polished

acting will add not a little to the ex
cellence of tomorrow evening's pro
duction.
While H. Person makes his first ap
pearance on the Stanford stage in this
play he has shown a marked aptitude
for his part and his portrayal of "Mr.
Arrelsford" is convincing in every de
tail. H. A. Lewis who is cast for the
role of "Wilfred Varney" is well
known through his former successful
appearances in local dramatics. Lewis
has been confined to the hospital for
the past week as a result of an opera
tion but is expected to be sufficiently
recovered to appear tomorrow even
ing. Should his condition not permit


!{. H. Seward As Cuptain Tborne.
