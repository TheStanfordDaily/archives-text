The probability of a general epide
mic of measles is now reduced to a
minimum. But the need of a detention
hospital for campus patients is just
as imperative as ever. The fortunate
termination of the recent scare will
not excuse present or future remiss
ness on the part of the Board of Trus
tees. On the contrary, it should
cause that Board to render thanks for
one lucky escape and to protect Use
University from the undue danger to
which campus residents may become
exposed under current conditions.
The wilful neglect of the Trustees has
continued long enough. Common
sense proves the folly of their atti
tude. Give us action and immediate
action at that.
