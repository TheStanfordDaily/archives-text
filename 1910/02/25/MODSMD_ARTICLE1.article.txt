Present total $30000
Enthusiastically endeavoring, each
to outdo the other, the four classes and
hold-overs subscribed $13,900 to the
Stanford Union fund at the conclusion
of the Assembly this morning, while
the Associated Students added another
thousand. With the $21,000 previously
assured by the faculty, H. C. Hoover
and other alumni, the grand total is
brought up to $36,000.
Individual students subscribed the
unexpected sum through the medium
of life memberships at fifty dollars
each, the date of the first payment be
ing determined by the donor, with the
provision that all the installments
will be completed in sums of not less
than five dollars within two years
after the initial payment. Under this
method 278 life memberships were
procured.
As the above tabulated statement
shows, the Juniors succeeded in cap
turing first place, but the chief honor
must go to the limited unmber of hold
overs, twenty-three of whom aspired
to become life members. The arrange
ments were clever, inducing the keen
est class rivalry which materially
swelled the fund.
The call for subscriptions was pre
ceded by a detailed explanation as
to what the Stanford Union is to be.
Professor C. T). Marx, chairman ol the
Board of Trustees of the Union, A. E.
Roth, a member of the board, and J.
E. Shelton, president of the Student
Body, presented the various ideas.
In explaining the plans, Shelton
told how the alumni and the faculty
bad done more than their share, while
Ihe students themselves had "not done
enough to hurt anyone." This neglect,
the speaker believed, was due to the
fact that Ihe proposition had not been
placed before them. Shelton then de
scribed similar buildings at other in
stitutions, dwelling upon the Huston
Club at the University of Pennsylva
nia. the thresholds of which 7000 peo
ple crossed daily. He spoke of il as
the "common ground and meeting

place of all the students." The Rey
nolds Cluh at the University of Chica
go was also described. Shelton stated
that this institution makes a univer
sity out of a series of graduate schools.
He concluded by saying:
"Encina Club-room does for the
members of Encina just what the
Union will do on a more effective
scale for ihe entire University. The
Union will be a place where everyone
can meet without one being host and
the other guest. In subscribing fifty
dollars, you are not. donating it. You
are getting life privileges in a club.
"The purpose of this meeting is to
explain the proposition and then to
ask you what you want to do about it."
Professor Marx said in part:
"In the olden days the faculty and
students knew one another, but this
has now been changed by our growth
and the increase in various college
activities. The students should know
the faculty, for the value of univer
sity training is not so much in the ac
tual knowledge which you take away
with you, as in the influence which
men with whom you come in contact
exert over you during that growing
period. I believe that the Union will
accomplish this end and I trust you
will lend your aid in its establishment."
Roth explained that the title to the
property would be held by a Board of
Trustees, composed of alumni, faculty
and students, who would also attend
to the details of construction; that
once built, the Union would be run by
a Board of Governors, largely students,
on the same basis as an ordinary ath
letic or commercial club; that, stu
dents, alumni and facutly would be
eligible upon the payment of small
annual dues, which the life members,
however, would not, have to pay; and
that, the location of the Union would
probably be on a site near the post
office or opposite the gymnasium. The
speaker continued:
"Ground can be broken as soon as
we have $25,000 cash. We will call
for life memberships this morning,
and later smaller individual amounts
will be solicited."
On behalf of the Student Body, G. A.
Ditz, '11, then donated $1000. He was
immediately followed by 27S others
with their fifty dollars each.
It is now expected that actual build
ing can be begun in the fall.
H. G. Ferguson, '11, chairman of the
local committee, presided over the
well-attended meeting.

the faculty, for the value of univer
sity training is not so much in the ac
tual knowledge which you take away
with you, as in the influence which
men with whom you come in contact
exert over you during that growing
period. I believe that the Union will
accomplish this end and I trust you
will lend your aid in its establishment."
Roth explained that the title to the
property would be held by a Board of
Trustees, composed of alumni, faculty
and students, who would also attend
to the details of construction; that
once built, the Union would be run by
a Board of Governors, largely students,
on the same basis as an ordinary ath
letic or commercial club; that, stu
dents, alumni and facutly would be
eligible upon the payment of small
annual dues, which the life members,
however, would not, have to pay; and
that, the location of the Union would
probably be on a site near the post
office or opposite the gymnasium. The
speaker continued:
"Ground can be broken as soon as
we have $25,000 cash. We will call
for life memberships this morning,
and later smaller individual amounts
will be solicited."
On behalf of the Student Body, G. A.
Ditz, '11, then donated $1000. He was
immediately followed by 27S others
with their fifty dollars each.
It is now expected that actual build
ing can be begun in the fall.
H. G. Ferguson, '11, chairman of the
local committee, presided over the
well-attended meeting.

Enthusiastically endeavoring, each
to outdo the other, the four classes and
hold-overs subscribed $13,900 to the
Stanford Union fund at the conclusion
of the Assembly this morning, while
the Associated Students added another
thousand. With the $21,000 previously
assured by the faculty, H. C. Hoover
and other alumni, the grand total is
brought up to $36,000.
Individual students subscribed the
unexpected sum through the medium
of life memberships at fifty dollars
each, the date of the first payment be
ing determined by the donor, with the
provision that all the installments
will be completed in sums of not less
than five dollars within two years
after the initial payment. Under this
method 278 life memberships were
procured.
As the above tabulated statement
shows, the Juniors succeeded in cap
turing first place, but the chief honor
must go to the limited unmber of hold
overs, twenty-three of whom aspired
to become life members. The arrange
ments were clever, inducing the keen
est class rivalry which materially
swelled the fund.
The call for subscriptions was pre
ceded by a detailed explanation as
to what the Stanford Union is to be.
Professor C. T). Marx, chairman ol the
Board of Trustees of the Union, A. E.
Roth, a member of the board, and J.
E. Shelton, president of the Student
Body, presented the various ideas.
In explaining the plans, Shelton
told how the alumni and the faculty
bad done more than their share, while
Ihe students themselves had "not done
enough to hurt anyone." This neglect,
the speaker believed, was due to the
fact that Ihe proposition had not been
placed before them. Shelton then de
scribed similar buildings at other in
stitutions, dwelling upon the Huston
Club at the University of Pennsylva
nia. the thresholds of which 7000 peo
ple crossed daily. He spoke of il as
the "common ground and meeting

place of all the students." The Rey
nolds Cluh at the University of Chica
go was also described. Shelton stated
that this institution makes a univer
sity out of a series of graduate schools.
He concluded by saying:
"Encina Club-room does for the
members of Encina just what the
Union will do on a more effective
scale for ihe entire University. The
Union will be a place where everyone
can meet without one being host and
the other guest. In subscribing fifty
dollars, you are not. donating it. You
are getting life privileges in a club.
"The purpose of this meeting is to
explain the proposition and then to
ask you what you want to do about it."
Professor Marx said in part:
"In the olden days the faculty and
students knew one another, but this
has now been changed by our growth
and the increase in various college
activities. The students should know
the faculty, for the value of univer
sity training is not so much in the ac
tual knowledge which you take away
with you, as in the influence which
men with whom you come in contact
exert over you during that growing
