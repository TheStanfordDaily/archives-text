In reverence to the memory of Mrs.
Jane Lathrop Stanford, who died five
years ago next Monday, a memorial
service will be held in Ihe Chapel on
that day. Save for the few members
of the Class of 1908 who still remain
in attendance at the University none
of the present college generation had
the good fortune to know Mrs. Stan
ford. But any tribute which we can
pay the memory of the noble woman
who gave her all for us should lie
rendered unhesitatingly, and attend
ing the services on Monday would be a
slight, but sincere, token of our deep
feelings of respect and reverence.
