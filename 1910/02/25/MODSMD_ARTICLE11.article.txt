The results of the Stanford Union
Assembly were gratifying as to far
eclipse the ardent hopes of the most
highly optimistic. The response of
the Student Body, collectively and in
dividually, is not only conclusive evi
dence of the prevalent interest in the
movement but is a fitting expression
of the true appreciation which is due
chiefly to H. C. Hoover and incidently
to the many generous alumni who,
concerned only indirectly and with
nothing but memories of the past to
prompt their action, rendered boun
teous assistance to the movement
while only in its infancy. Just as the
alumni did more than their share, so
the students outdid themselves today,
and now we are practically assured
of a Stanford Union which, in the
words of President Shelton, "will do
for the entire University what the
Encina Club-room does for the mem
bers of Encina." We believe that this
is so and therefore believe in the un
qualified efficiency of the institution.
The spirit of the Hall permeating the
Student Body as a whole is a boon
which can not be too highly prized.
