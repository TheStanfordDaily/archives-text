# PICK FRESHMAN TEAM
## NAME TRACK MEN WHO WILL COMPETE AT OAKLAND. Varsity Candidates To Have Meet On Campus.â€”Captain Scott Suffers A Break-down. 
### 
The Freshman track team will enter
its first contest of the year tomorroy
when it meets the athletes of St.Mary's
College on the cinder path. The men
will leave for Oakland on the 9:IG
train and will be accompanied by Cap
tain Scott and A. E. Roth, '09. Un
fortunately, the team will be weakened
by the absence of H. Morrison in the
broad-jump and A. H. Frank in the
weight events.
Morrison injured his foot last even
ing while attempting to vault, and in
consequence will not be able to com
pete for some time. Frank who has
been setting some good marks in the
shot-put is suffering from a severe
strain sustained in practice.
The composition of the team which
will make the trip is as follows:
E. F. Kern, G. L. Horine, R. P. Stev
ens, J. A. Miller, A. P. Hill, (J. L.
Lawrence, R. F. Andrews, L. R. Lam
bert, G. K. Snyder, W. D. Lewis, C. S.
Turpin, R. W. Wilcox, J. B. Lehman,
N. R. Ferguson, L. H. Price and F. S.
Pratt.
A meet will also be held on the Var
sity track at 10:30 on Saturday morn
ing in which all other candidates for
track laurels are expected to enter.
H. L. Horton, captain of last year's
team, will supervise the meet, while
"Dad" Moulton will give all his time
to coaching the men. The results of
this meet will in a great measure
determine what men are to be taken
on the southern trip.
Captain Scott has probably sprinted
his last 100, as yesterday afternoon
while running a trial heat he tore
loose a tendon in his leg. The acci
dent will keep Scott off the track for
a couple of weeks at least and may
prove a serious hindrance to his
vaulting. Prior to the mishap Scott
had been clearing the bar at 11 feet. 6
inches consistently and by the ease in
which Ihe vaults were made it was
predicted that he could have passed
the 12-foot, mark in competition.
