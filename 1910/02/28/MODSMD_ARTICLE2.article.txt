# SHOW UP TO STANDARD
## "SECRET SERVICE" RANKS WITH FORMER SOPHOMORES. Misses Wendling and Workman, and R.H. Seward Largely Responsible for Success of Play. 
### 
The delicious charm of Miss AVend
ling, the artistic poise of Miss Work
man, the dramatic "finish" of Mr.
Seward; these are the most pleasant
memories which remain with us who
witnessed "Secret Serivce" last Fri
day evening, and these were tho
touches which ranked the performance
high up in the category of Sophomoric
successes. Some there were in the
audience who doubted the advisability
of selecting a piece which so closely
verged upon the melodramatic; yet
more were glad enough to see a good
play of that character, and "Secret
Service" is the best of its kind, because
its presentation rounded out an ex
tended cycle, ranging from farce to
Shakespeare, and proved the adapt
ability and versatility of Stanford
actors.
The smooth performance of so tricky
a play by people for the most part in
experienced. is in itself a rare tribute
to the efforts of Mr. Mathieu, the
coach. The play ran on at high speed
without a hitch, but this the college
public has come to expect and accept.
Seldom, however, has a piece been
presented here in which there was an
act possessing the intricacies of the
third scene of "Secret Service." And
yet it was done with polish as well us
snap.
The melodramatic tone o fthe perfor
mance was minimized by the repressed
methods of Mr. Seward who, despite
the exciting temptations of his role,
not once exceeded the realms of legiti
mate drama. Striking in presence,
dramatic in pose, convincing in his
naturalness, and clear in delivery, Mr.
Seward again proved his unequalled
efficiency as a "straight lead."
A surprise, however, is always more
interesting than the realization of a
long anticipated pleasure. That ?*Tr.
Seward would be excellent we all
knew. Miss AVendling, on the con
trary, was preceded by no glorifying
reputation, and consequently her tri
umph was all the more delightful. The
true girl of the South, with grace,
beauty, and a rich, melodious voice
withal. "Edith Varney" was pictured
with sincerity and realism.
Largely wasted in the ungrateful
part of "Mrs. Varney," Miss AVork
man's diginfied presence, natural
noise, and convincing pathos only
served to make us intensely eager to
-ee her in a role of big dramatic pos
sibilities. Miss AVorkman is an artist
and deserves better material.
A brilliant sketch was Mr. Knolin's
small, but. difficult and intense role,
"Henry Dumont." Also, we wish that
the"Telegraph Operator" of Mr. Arga
bright might have had more to do.
The "Jonas" of Mr. Albright was real
istic. especially in the cartridge scene.
Miss Bates was true to life as the con
ventional negro mammy.
Here ends the unqualified praise.
Miss Hiller succeeded in making
every comedy point tell. But her
enunciation, though clear, was a trifle
forced ,and she inclined to an un
necessary loudness of voice.
Mr. Person was at all times the dis
tasteful character which he played.
His lines were spoken with force and
rapidity, and yet with distinctness.
For a beginner. Person succeeded en
couragingly with the most trying part
of the play. 'Mr. Arresford" is an
unsympathetic role and works to a
climax merely to give the stage (o
"Captain Thorne." A little stiffness
was noticeable in Person's perfor
manc but with more experience he will
he a valuable "heavy."
Mr. Lewis left the hospital after a
week's illness to appear as "Wilfred
Varney," a rather negative juvenile
which he played with sincerity.
Mr. Scliaupp's "Major General" was
scarcely a major general at all.
The messengers and soldiers pro
vided entertainment for their friends,
although they overdid the "tramping
feet" as often as circumstances al
lowed.

experienced. is in itself a rare tribute
to the efforts of Mr. Mathieu, the
coach. The play ran on at high speed
without a hitch, but this the college
public has come to expect and accept.
Seldom, however, has a piece been
presented here in which there was an
act possessing the intricacies of the
third scene of "Secret Service." And
yet it was done with polish as well us
snap.
The melodramatic tone o fthe perfor
mance was minimized by the repressed
methods of Mr. Seward who, despite
the exciting temptations of his role,
not once exceeded the realms of legiti
mate drama. Striking in presence,
dramatic in pose, convincing in his
naturalness, and clear in delivery, Mr.
Seward again proved his unequalled
efficiency as a "straight lead."
A surprise, however, is always more
interesting than the realization of a
long anticipated pleasure. That ?*Tr.
Seward would be excellent we all
knew. Miss AVendling, on the con
trary, was preceded by no glorifying
reputation, and consequently her tri
umph was all the more delightful. The
true girl of the South, with grace,
beauty, and a rich, melodious voice
withal. "Edith Varney" was pictured
with sincerity and realism.
Largely wasted in the ungrateful
part of "Mrs. Varney," Miss AVork
man's diginfied presence, natural
noise, and convincing pathos only
served to make us intensely eager to
-ee her in a role of big dramatic pos
sibilities. Miss AVorkman is an artist
and deserves better material.
A brilliant sketch was Mr. Knolin's
small, but. difficult and intense role,
"Henry Dumont." Also, we wish that
the"Telegraph Operator" of Mr. Arga
bright might have had more to do.
The "Jonas" of Mr. Albright was real
istic. especially in the cartridge scene.
Miss Bates was true to life as the con
ventional negro mammy.
Here ends the unqualified praise.
Miss Hiller succeeded in making
every comedy point tell. But her
enunciation, though clear, was a trifle
forced ,and she inclined to an un
necessary loudness of voice.
Mr. Person was at all times the dis
tasteful character which he played.
His lines were spoken with force and
rapidity, and yet with distinctness.
For a beginner. Person succeeded en
couragingly with the most trying part
of the play. 'Mr. Arresford" is an
unsympathetic role and works to a
climax merely to give the stage (o
"Captain Thorne." A little stiffness
was noticeable in Person's perfor
manc but with more experience he will
he a valuable "heavy."
Mr. Lewis left the hospital after a
week's illness to appear as "Wilfred
Varney," a rather negative juvenile
which he played with sincerity.
Mr. Scliaupp's "Major General" was
scarcely a major general at all.
The messengers and soldiers pro
vided entertainment for their friends,
although they overdid the "tramping
feet" as often as circumstances al
lowed.
The delicious charm of Miss AVend
ling, the artistic poise of Miss Work
man, the dramatic "finish" of Mr.
Seward; these are the most pleasant
memories which remain with us who
witnessed "Secret Serivce" last Fri
day evening, and these were tho
touches which ranked the performance
high up in the category of Sophomoric
successes. Some there were in the
audience who doubted the advisability
of selecting a piece which so closely
verged upon the melodramatic; yet
more were glad enough to see a good
play of that character, and "Secret
Service" is the best of its kind, because
its presentation rounded out an ex
tended cycle, ranging from farce to
Shakespeare, and proved the adapt
ability and versatility of Stanford
actors.
The smooth performance of so tricky
a play by people for the most part in
experienced. is in itself a rare tribute
to the efforts of Mr. Mathieu, the
coach. The play ran on at high speed
without a hitch, but this the college
public has come to expect and accept.
