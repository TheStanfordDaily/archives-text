# Join The Graduate Club.
## 
### 
On Thursday afternoon a meeting
of graduate students was held for the
purpose of organizing a "Graduate
Club." About fifty were present, and
to these Dr. Flngel explained the pur
pose of the club. The idea was enthu
siastically received by those present,
but owing to the fact, that all the
graduates were not present, only a
temporary organization was effected.
Further plans and a permanent organ
ization. including the election of offi
cers, will be effected at the meeting to
be held Tuesday at 4:30, in room 202
of the History building. Every gradu
ate student is urged to be present.
