# CUTS OFF OLD RECORD
## T.L. COLEMAN, '12, CUTS TIME FOR FURLONG. Cardinal Athletes Make Good Showing. After Running Mile Johnston Wins the Half. 
### 
Each Saturday morning meet brings
out in black and white evidence; the
steady, encouraging progress made by
the Cardinal track men. Each week
takes off another second, or adds an
inch, or even a foot, in the events on
the path and field. The third of the
preparatory meets, completed in an
hour last Saturday morning, was
wholly satisfying and revealed just
how much true gold there is under the
Cardinal-hued running suits. T. L.
Coleman, '12, won the century and
the furlong dashes for the first time
this year, in remarkable time, faster
than has been done in any of the try
out meets. The 100 he ran in 10:2,
the 220 in the record figures of 22:1.
This is bettering the Stanford record
set. in 1908 by 11. E. Reed. *30, at 22:2.
Every watch held on Coleman Satur
day had the same story to tell. H.
Smitherum. 11. was performing well,
but was not up to his usual form. C.
H. Tallant, '11, is keeping up his splen
did work in the broad jump with con
sistent excellence, doing 21 ft. 2in.
Saturday. The mile and the 880 also
showed what their exponents were
good for. A. Johnston. '10, ticked off
on the watches the time of 2:03 1-5 in
the 880, not more than 50 minutes
after he had run the mile, when he
seconded W. S. Porter, '11, who made
that distance in the noteworthy time
of 4:40 4-5. Johnston is in good con
dition and both races were good.
With the urging of a fast man behind
in the first quarter of the 880 he
covered the distance in 57 seconds,
and finished his full number of yards
in strong shape.
All the events were worth putting
up on the bulletin board of achieve
ments, among them H. L. Horton's 43
feet 4 inches in the shotput, the quar
ter mile dash won by Millsap in 53:4.
Captain L. Scott, '10, was absent, be

190 ft Captain H. L. Horton took his
place in the direction of the meet.

Each Saturday morning meet brings
out in black and white evidence; the
steady, encouraging progress made by
the Cardinal track men. Each week
takes off another second, or adds an
inch, or even a foot, in the events on
the path and field. The third of the
preparatory meets, completed in an
hour last Saturday morning, was
wholly satisfying and revealed just
how much true gold there is under the
Cardinal-hued running suits. T. L.
Coleman, '12, won the century and
the furlong dashes for the first time
this year, in remarkable time, faster
than has been done in any of the try
out meets. The 100 he ran in 10:2,
the 220 in the record figures of 22:1.
This is bettering the Stanford record
set. in 1908 by 11. E. Reed. *30, at 22:2.
Every watch held on Coleman Satur
day had the same story to tell. H.
Smitherum. 11. was performing well,
but was not up to his usual form. C.
H. Tallant, '11, is keeping up his splen
did work in the broad jump with con
sistent excellence, doing 21 ft. 2in.
Saturday. The mile and the 880 also
showed what their exponents were
good for. A. Johnston. '10, ticked off
on the watches the time of 2:03 1-5 in
the 880, not more than 50 minutes
after he had run the mile, when he
seconded W. S. Porter, '11, who made
that distance in the noteworthy time
of 4:40 4-5. Johnston is in good con
dition and both races were good.
With the urging of a fast man behind
in the first quarter of the 880 he
covered the distance in 57 seconds,
and finished his full number of yards
in strong shape.
All the events were worth putting
up on the bulletin board of achieve
ments, among them H. L. Horton's 43
feet 4 inches in the shotput, the quar
ter mile dash won by Millsap in 53:4.
Captain L. Scott, '10, was absent, be

190 ft Captain H. L. Horton took his
place in the direction of the meet.
