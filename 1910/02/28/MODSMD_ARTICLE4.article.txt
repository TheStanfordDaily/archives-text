# VARSITY NINE WINS
## PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC TEAM DEFEATED BY 2-0 SCOORE. Reed Has Perfect Control and Puzzles the Mechanics.—Varsity Makes Only Two Errors. 
### 
With a score of 2-0 in its favor, the
Varsity Saturday defeated the Pacific
Gas and Electric nine of San Francis
co, in a close and exciting, if not an
exceptionally well-played game. Reed,
who was on the slab for the Cardinals
passed out a puzzling lot of benders,
allowing the visitors to make only
one hit, and giving only one man a
ticket to first on balls. The other men
on the team backed up the pitcher in
excellent style, having only two errors
credited to them at the end of the
game. Until the end of the seventh
inning no one had crossed the plate
for either team, when, with two men
down, "Stan" Mitchell came to the bat
and got a little hit over short. The
mechanic in the left garden got the
ball tangled up in his legs and before
he could recover it from the long
grass Mitchell had crossed the plate.
This started the fireworks, and McFad
den and Ball coming to the bat next
both obtained hits, McFadden scoring
McGregor, who was next up, flew out
to right, leaving the score at 2-0,
where it remained until the end of the
game.
Scanlon, the pitcher for the Mechan
ics, had difficulty in locating the plate,
giving seven men walks to first. When
he did manage to get them over the
Varsity had little difficulty in getting
the wood on them, as he had seven
hits credited against him.
