The Palo Alto youngster has often
been guilty of disturbing the peace
during a college performance, and he
has always received his full share of
blame, even in instances when per
haps he was not the offender. But
whatever he has done in an endeavor
to batter down the doors of Assembly
Hall or in violently rushing the gal
lery stairs during the progress of a
play, he has seldom displayed the
puerile ungentlemanliness of the Stan
ford students who proceeded without
provocation to josh the most dramatic
scenes of "Secret, Service." Had the
acting been so poor as to make the
performance absurd, the ruffianly
tactics would have been, to say the
least, discourteous. But in the face of
the convincing rendition of Mr. Sew
ard, the rowdyism was worthy only of
hoodlums, who, unable to enjoy or ap
preciate anything good themselves,
undertake to spoil it for everyone else.
Such persons want even the common
sense to stay away from a decent per
formance and apparently relish their
own lack of intelligence. And amaz
ing as it seems, the Sophomore Class
itself was well represented in the ob
jectionable quarter.
A continuance of such proceedings
will soon forbid the attempting of ser
ious plays at Stanford.
