The semi-annual mid-semester ex
aminations are practically concluded,
and we do not blame a student for
heaving a satisfied sigh of pleasurable
relief, for the present method of con
ducting these examinations imposes
the heaviest possible burden upon the
undergraduate. Are the tests scat
tered so as not to enforce an undue
amount of work within a given space
of time. We should say not. Is any
effort made which will lighten the
load ? We should say not. Instruct
ors, entirely independent of even their
departmental colleagues, announce ex
aminations as they see fit, and fortu
nate is the student who has no more
than one on any single day. As the
written tests usually extend over a
period of approximately two weeks, it
seems to us that with a little cohesion
among the gentlemen who ask ques
tions the student could receive kindlier
treatment without lessening the al
leged efficiency of the system. Such
cohesion is relatively infrequent, how
ever, and the hardships accordingly
continue. As a member of the faculty
has said: "In this regard we never
work together."
