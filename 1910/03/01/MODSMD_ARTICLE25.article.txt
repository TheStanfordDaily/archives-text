# New Crane In Foundry Shop.
## 
### 
A new electric traveling crane has
been set up and is now in use in the
foundry shop. The new piece of ma
chinery obviates the old method of
handling by hand large quantities of
molten iron and heavy castings. When
tested five tons of pig iron was lifted
by the new crane.
