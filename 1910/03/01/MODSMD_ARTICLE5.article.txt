# USES NEW SHELL AS TARGET.
## Vandal Fires Bullets Into Racing Craft.—Interclass Crew Training Hard For Race. 
### 
The discovery was made Sunday bj
the members of last year's Varsity
crew that the eight-oared shell pur
chased last season from Cornell Uni
versity had been used as a target by
some miscreant possessed of a
calibre riHe. Several holes were punc
tured in the shell by bullets of this
size, making it unsafe for use until [
they are plugged up. The shell is j
1 r> • ■
City, which makes it seem probable
that the firing was done with the ma
licious intent of injuring the craft.
The Varsity men happened to journey
to Redwood for the purpose of having
their picture taken for the 1911
"Quad."
The crew candidates are training
hard at present for the interclas«
four-oared barge race on Junior Day.
The Senior. Junior, and Sophomore
fours will lie particularly strong, be
ing composed of veterans of former
Varsity and class crews. Some good
time is expected.
