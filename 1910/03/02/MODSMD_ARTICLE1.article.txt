# OPERA PROMISES WELL
## NEW COACHING SYSTEM SHOWS EXCELLENT RESULTS. Annual Junior Play Being Rapidly Formulated In Preparation For Its Production On March 17. 
### 
With the full selection of the cast
for "lolanthe," the Junior Opera, hav
ing been made, active work upon the
training of the various principals and
especially the choruses has been
pushed forward at a very rapid pace.
Under the new system of coaching the
two elements in the play separately,
excellent results have been already
gained by those who are in charge of
this part of the work attendant upon
the production of the opera.
Chairman Woodville of the com
mittee, has just received from New
York a full orchestration for the use
of the orchestra upon the evening of
the production of the opera. With this
on hand, the musicians will begin to
practice the songs and the accompani
ments immediately. Special music has
been promised by the committee, in
addition to the number of excellent
songs that are included in the score of
"lolanthe."
Scene painter Lyon, who has been
engaged by various organizations in
college to build and plan the scenery
that has been used in many of the
plays that have been produced, has
outlined and is starting progress at
this time upon the drops and wings
that are to make up the spectacular
scenes that are included in the opera.
Plans are now contemplated by the
committee for securing special trans
portation from San Jose and return
during the evening of March 17 so
that a large number of residents from
that, city could come to the campus to
see the opera and return to San Jose
that, evening. As the electric cars are
scheduled to make trips at that time
from San Jose to Palo Alto, it has
been hoped by the committee in charge
of this venture, that they may be able
to secure transportation for those who
will care to visit the campus and who
will desire to return to San Jose that
evening.
