rn addressing the University Con- j
ference Dr. Jordan decried the ••rattl
ing" of visiting pitchers during the
progress of Varsity baseball games.
As the statement was general in scope,
we are unable to tell just how far the
President meant his condemnation to
extend. Too great restriction is dis
tinctly not to be desired. Yelling is j
nearly as much a part of a hall game '
as the eighteen men and the umpire.'
Save on the Stanford campus, a game
is never played without an abundance
of noise and shouting. Here, however,
continual attempts to exterminate any
"rattling" of the pitcher have been so
successful that now, when anyone on
the bleachers makes so bold as to let
out a shout, he attracts more atten
tion than the contesting teams. In
baseball, organized rooting is impossi
ble. Every man has to yell for him
self, if there is to lie any cheering at
all. Any slight noise may "rattle" the
pitcher, but is, we think, nevertheless
desirable. A Stanford student knows
the difference between legitimate noise
and "muckerism," and he will draw
the line. Believing this, we strongly
advocate real baseball enthusiasm on
the bleachers.
