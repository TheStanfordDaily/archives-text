At last, common sense is about to
prevail, and a detention hospital for
campus students suffering from con-|
tagious diseases is to become a reality.
The initiation and probable success of
the movement came from the Univer
sity Conference itself an active and
able organization. And for this we are
duly thankful. Any Student Body needs
such a board, but after struggling
in vain to make a useful institution out
of the impotent President's Confer

euce, the undergraduates were fully
justified in doubting, at the beginning,
the ultimate efficiency of the present
organization. The Conference is doing
its work well, however, as attested bj
the business transacted at yesterday's
meeting.
