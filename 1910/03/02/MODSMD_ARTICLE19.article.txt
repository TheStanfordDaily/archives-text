# VARIOUS MATTERS DISCUSSED.
## Seniors Decide To Preserve Singing Custom and Accept "Quad" Board Report. 
### 
Four questions of interest were
brought up for discussion at the con
ference held by the members of the
Senior Class this afternoon in room 6S
immediately following the noon hour.
President Scott called the assembly to
order and announced that the most
urgent question to be considered was
the matter of sanctioning the report
of the "Quad" Board of Directors,
which had during the Junior year of
the class the supervision of the man
agement of the 1910 "Quad."
J. B. Bubb, chairman of this board
read his report, which stated all the
bills had now been settled, but at the
present time a number of trade ads
amounting to several hundred dollars
were still to be disposed of. The fig
ures of the report showed, that the
balance of money now in the hands of
the board was twenty-seven cents, but
that ihere was still due to this board
$19.7f> from various booksellers.
The second proposition placed be
fore the body was the question of con
tinuing the Senior men's Smoker. J.
E. Shelton stated that arrangements
were being made for such an event
next week, to be held under the
auspices of three fraternities. The
idea of the Seniors is to hold three
more smokers this semester, the last
of which may be held in the foothills.
Whether the class should preserve
the custom of Senior singing at Lake
Lagunita this semester was the third
subject considered. The class ap
proved this idea and a committee
consisting of T. A. Deßolt, N. Taylor,
and A. E. Ehrhorn, chairman, was ap
pointed to take charge. It was decided
that the singing should be held on
Sundays at 4:30 o'clock.
Just before adjourning R. C. McFad
den brought up the question of wheth
er the class should settle the expenses
incurred by those who took part, in
the Plug Ugly episode last, semester.
The matter was laid on the table until
certain if the payment of these bills
would give cause for an assessment.
