# VARSITY PLAYS AGAIN.
## Cardinal Nine Faces Men From St. Ignatius On Stanford Field At 4:15 Today. 
### 
The Cardinal Varsity met the St. Ig
natius nine this afternoon on Stan
ford Field for the first time this sea
son. The visitors are much stronger
than last year and should give the
Carsity a good proposition. Gilfillan
took the mound for two innings, with
.Tones following. Ganong received the
delivery in both cases. Mouille did
the box work for St. Ignatius, with
Miller as his battery mate. Reed.
Obear and McGregor make tip the
three outer grass positions.
Sixth Timing.
