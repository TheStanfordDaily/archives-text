# LECTURES ON DARWIN.
## Dr. Jordan Tolls About The Emancipator of Thought To Interested Audience. 
### 
An audience, which taxed the ut
most capacity of room 640 ot' the
Botany department, listened to Dr.
Jordan's interesting lecture on Charles
Darwin yesterday afternoon. "Dar
win", said Dr. Jordan, "was born 101
years ago on the same day as Lincoln,
and both were to be great emancipat
ors, one of thought and the other of
bondsmen."
As a school boy, Darwin was nick
named "Gas" by his fellows, because
of his inordinate fondness for the
natural sciences. Dr. Jordan attrib
uted the great naturalist's success to
three causes: first, to the Darwin
heredity, that is, because he was Dar
win; second, his contact with realities,
because he studied flowers etc.: third,
because he walked with Henslow.
Henslow was an enthusiastic natural
ist.
When Darwin was twenty-three or
four he obtained the position of natur
alist to accompany a government ex
pedition on the "Beagle" to chart the
harbors of the world. On this ex
pedition he obtained the material
which led to his "Origin of Species."
When his writings first appeared
they created a great storm of adverse
criticism. Today it is possible to dis
cuss Darwin's theories and still be
orthodox. The microscope of Darwin's
day was far from being satisfactory,
but today it opens up many new fields
which were then closed.
