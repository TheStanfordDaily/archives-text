## CARDINAL TO BE REPRESENTED BY FOURTEEN MEN. Expect No Trouble In Winning Victory, Coleman's Record For Furlong To Be Considered. 
### 
Fourteen men,representing the pick
of the Cardinal track athletes, 'vill
leave for Los Angeles tomorrow after
noon on the Sunset Express. The
team will meet the University of
Southern California on Saturday, and
will be back on the campus the next
day. No difficulty is expected in ad
ministering a trouncing to the south
ern team, as close contests are con
sidered possible in only a few events.
In the sprints the Los Angeles insti
tution has several fast men, Martin
and Trotter having records of 10:1.
Lennox is a dangerous competitor in
the hurdles, and Kern, the Cardinal
representative in this event, will have
his hands full in breasting the tape in
front of him. The injuries to Scott
and Bellah will give Richardson of U.
S. C. an excellent opportunity to carry
off first place in the vault, as he is
credited with doing 11 feet 6 inches al
ready this season.

have had considerable difficulty in
choosing the team for the southern
