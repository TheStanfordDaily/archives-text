# BOARD STATES FACTS
## GUILD MANAGEMENT TENDERS COMPLETE REPORT. Explains To University Conference Relations Of Hospital and Student Body. 
### 
Owing to the general misunder
standing on the part of the Student
Body concerning the relation between
the Guild Board and the students, the
University Conference submits the
following statement from the Guild
Board. Since the receipt of this com
mutation, members of the Board of
Trustees have evinced a desire to aid
the Guild Board in the establishment
of an isolation hospital and develop
ments are expected in the next few
days. The Conference has decided to
defer any further action in the matter
until the Trustee's attitude is more
clearly shown at their next meeting.
At the present time, however, the Con
ference feels that the chances of
getting the right to build a hospital
are exceedingly good. The report of
the Guild Board follows:
To The University Conference:
The Student's Guild was established
in the fall of 1894 for the purpose of
advancing money to sick students who,
up to this time, had been dependent
for care upon professors and fellow
students.
In 1899 it was found that so few
students paid their Guild fee, that, the
board declared to extend aid only to
the students who were members of
the organization. In 1903 the Univer
sity was visited by a typhoid epidemic
and during this epidemic aid was
given to all students regardless of
membership. One of the houses in
Palo Alto which had been used in tak
ing care of the typhoid patients was,
the following year, fitted as a per
manent hospital under management
of the Guild Board. This made neces
sary a reorganization of the Guild,
which secured recognition from the
Board of Trustees, with authority to
collect a membership fee (not to ex
ceed $2.50 per semester! from all
matriculating students. It still re
mained a student organization, its
Board of Directors consisting of five
students, appointed by the Executive
Committee, together with three faculty
members who act in an advisory capa
city.
Since 1904 the Guild has maintained
a well equipped hospital. Buildings
and grounds have been acquired and
with added improvements have cost,
about. $15,000. The greater part of
the purchase funds have been secured
from Building and Loan Associations,
or on notes given by the Guild. This
indebtedness has now been decreased
to about $9,000, the annual charge on
which is $1099.20 in addition to taxes
and other minor expenses incident to
care of property. During the opera
tion of the hospital, the guild fee has
been maintained at $2.00 per semester
Members have been entitled to free
nursing (unless in severe cases a
special nurse is required) and the use
of stock drugs and return to the
Guild the sum of one dollar a day dur
ing the time they are in the hospital.
In order to operate the hospital on
the desired scale, it was necessary to
admit outside cases, from whom a fee
of four dollars a dav was exacted
