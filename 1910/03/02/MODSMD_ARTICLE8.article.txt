# BOARD STATES FACTS
## GUILD MANAGEMENT TENDERS COMPLETE REPORT. Explains To University Conference Relations Of Hospital and Student Body. 
### 
Owing to the general misunder
standing on the part of the Student
Body concerning the relation between
the Guild Board and the students, the
University Conference submits the
following statement from the Guild
Board. Since the receipt of this com
mutation, members of the Board of
Trustees have evinced a desire to aid
the Guild Board in the establishment
of an isolation hospital and develop
ments are expected in the next few
days. The Conference has decided to
defer any further action in the matter
until the Trustee's attitude is more
clearly shown at their next meeting.
At the present time, however, the Con
ference feels that the chances of
getting the right to build a hospital
are exceedingly good. The report of
the Guild Board follows:
To The University Conference:
The Student's Guild was established
in the fall of 1894 for the purpose of
advancing money to sick students who,
up to this time, had been dependent
for care upon professors and fellow
students.
In 1899 it was found that so few
students paid their Guild fee, that, the
board declared to extend aid only to
the students who were members of
the organization. In 1903 the Univer
sity was visited by a typhoid epidemic
and during this epidemic aid was
given to all students regardless of
membership. One of the houses in
Palo Alto which had been used in tak
ing care of the typhoid patients was,
the following year, fitted as a per
manent hospital under management
of the Guild Board. This made neces
sary a reorganization of the Guild,
which secured recognition from the
Board of Trustees, with authority to
collect a membership fee (not to ex
ceed $2.50 per semester! from all
matriculating students. It still re
mained a student organization, its
Board of Directors consisting of five
students, appointed by the Executive
Committee, together with three faculty
members who act in an advisory capa
city.
Since 1904 the Guild has maintained
a well equipped hospital. Buildings
and grounds have been acquired and
with added improvements have cost,
about. $15,000. The greater part of
the purchase funds have been secured
from Building and Loan Associations,
or on notes given by the Guild. This
indebtedness has now been decreased
to about $9,000, the annual charge on
which is $1099.20 in addition to taxes
and other minor expenses incident to
care of property. During the opera
tion of the hospital, the guild fee has
been maintained at $2.00 per semester
Members have been entitled to free
nursing (unless in severe cases a
special nurse is required) and the use
of stock drugs and return to the
Guild the sum of one dollar a day dur
ing the time they are in the hospital.
In order to operate the hospital on
the desired scale, it was necessary to
admit outside cases, from whom a fee
of four dollars a dav was exacted
Without the profit derived from out
side cases, it would have been neces
sary to materially lessen the service
to the students or to have increased
the charge made them.
One of the hospital buildings was
especially planned to facilitate the
isolation of contagious cases and until
1908-9, such cases were freely taken to
the hospital. But in the year mentioned
the Board of Health of Palo Alto for
bade the entrance of such cases within
the city, and as no other site has been
made available on the campus, the
Guild has since been unable satisfact
orily to perform one of its most im
portant functions â€”the isolation and
care of such cases.
With the opening of the Peninsula
Hospital, it was to lie expected that
the Guild Hospital would lose its
highly remunerative outside patients
and would operate with difficulty, ft
was therefore determined to enter into
an arrangement with the Peninsula
Hospital for care of all students, ex
cepting those having contagious dis
eases, at the rate of $2.50 per day, and
such additional charges for special
services as are common in all hospi
tals. The charge to members of the
Guild remains the same as under the
old arrangement. The Guild pays the
entire hospital bill and in turn charges
the patient at the rate of $1.00 a day.
paying the remainder out of the gen
eral fund.
The state laws do not permit mov
ing contagious case off from the camp
us, so the Guild could not care for
such cases even at. its hospital in Palo
Alto.
During the last two months the
Guild has established and maintained
four isolation hospitals the combined
running expenses of which is about
$185.00 a week.
The Guild realizes approximately
$6,000.00 each year from the student
fees. Of this amount about $3,000.00 is
paid to the Peninsula Hospital and
about $1,000.00 interest and principal
on mortgages. This leaves about
$2,000.00 to cover many minor expen
ses and for a reserve fund for epidem
ics.
The recent, epidemc of measles has
been an expensive affair. It is seen
from the above that a continued epi
demic would soon place the Guild in
grave financial straits, if it assumed
the entire cost of each student's quar
antine. The board therefore, consid
ers it best to pay all expenses of the
quarantine and make the best possi
ble financial arrangements with each
group of students held under the var
ious quarantines.
