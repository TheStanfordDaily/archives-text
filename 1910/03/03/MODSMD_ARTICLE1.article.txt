# DR. JORDAN TO RETIRE IN SIX YEARS
## Stanford President Will Accept Benefits of Carnegie Pension Fund and Pursue Study of Biology of War. 
### 
The statement which Doctor David
Starr Jordan made to the University
Conference at its last meeting to the
effect that at the end of six years
from now it was his intention to re
tire from tiie presidency of Stanford
University and accept the benefits of
tlie Carnegie Foundation for the Ad
vancement of Learning was made pub
lic today by Dr. Jordan. In speaking to
a representative of the Daily Pa'.)
Alto this morning he reiterated the
statement which he made to the Con
ference that he had definitely decided
to retire because he thought that it
best for all professors to resign from
active work after reaching the age of
sixty-five.
In making this step the President is
not only acting on his own volition in
the matter but is carrying into direct
effect a policy which the Board of
Trustees favors. When the Carnegie
Pension project was first broached the
Trustees made application that all
Stanford professors be included in the
benefit. This has been granted to the
local faculty.
A desire to be relieved from active
administrative work is not Doctor
Jordan's only motive in retiring from
the Presidency. For many years he
has wished for the opportunity of
carrying on research work of his lik
ing which the pressing duties of his
office have prevented. The President
is very desirous of spending the latter
part of his life in carrying into effect
and working for those ends in which
he is primarily interested. When
asked as to what special line of work
he would enter, he stated that he could
give no definite answer as his plans
for the future were entirely unsettled
and that he would wait to see what

the coming six years would bring
forth. However, he stated that the
subject which interested him most at
the present time was a study of the
biology of war and that he might
make an exhaustive study of this,
traveling in Europe if neccessary.
Doctor Jordan wishes to establish to
the best of his ability the direct and
indirect effects of war upon mankind
and upon the conduct and develop
ment of the nations.
The Carnegie Foundation for the
Advancement of Learning was estab
lished by Andrew Carnegie for the pur
pose which its name signifies, but its
immediate benefit is the pension fund
which it provides for the support of
University instructors and professors
who have reached the age of sixty-five
and who have been many years en
gaged in educational work. It is de
signed not only to support those who
deserve to retire from active work, but
to benefit them at a time in life when
they are yet able to make an intensive
study of their particular branch of re
search.
An educator to be eligible for a pen
sion must have had not less than fif
teen years of service as a professor or
not less than twenty-five years of ser
vice as an instructor and professor,
and who is at the time a professor or
instructor in an accepted institution.
Xo retiring allowance is permitted to
exceed $4,000 and for active pay great
er than $1200 dollars the retiring al
lowance shall equal $1,000 increased
by $50 for each $100 of active pay in
excess of $1200. For an active pay of
$1,200 or less, an allowance of $1,000
is made, provided no retiring allow
ance shall exceed ninety per cent of
the active pay.

The statement which Doctor David
Starr Jordan made to the University
Conference at its last meeting to the
effect that at the end of six years
from now it was his intention to re
tire from tiie presidency of Stanford
University and accept the benefits of
tlie Carnegie Foundation for the Ad
vancement of Learning was made pub
lic today by Dr. Jordan. In speaking to
a representative of the Daily Pa'.)
Alto this morning he reiterated the
statement which he made to the Con
ference that he had definitely decided
to retire because he thought that it
best for all professors to resign from
active work after reaching the age of
sixty-five.
In making this step the President is
not only acting on his own volition in
the matter but is carrying into direct
effect a policy which the Board of
Trustees favors. When the Carnegie
Pension project was first broached the
Trustees made application that all
Stanford professors be included in the
benefit. This has been granted to the
local faculty.
A desire to be relieved from active
administrative work is not Doctor
Jordan's only motive in retiring from
the Presidency. For many years he
has wished for the opportunity of
carrying on research work of his lik
ing which the pressing duties of his
office have prevented. The President
is very desirous of spending the latter
part of his life in carrying into effect
and working for those ends in which
he is primarily interested. When
asked as to what special line of work
he would enter, he stated that he could
give no definite answer as his plans
for the future were entirely unsettled
and that he would wait to see what

the coming six years would bring
forth. However, he stated that the
subject which interested him most at
the present time was a study of the
biology of war and that he might
make an exhaustive study of this,
traveling in Europe if neccessary.
Doctor Jordan wishes to establish to
the best of his ability the direct and
indirect effects of war upon mankind
and upon the conduct and develop
ment of the nations.
The Carnegie Foundation for the
Advancement of Learning was estab
lished by Andrew Carnegie for the pur
pose which its name signifies, but its
immediate benefit is the pension fund
which it provides for the support of
University instructors and professors
who have reached the age of sixty-five
and who have been many years en
gaged in educational work. It is de
signed not only to support those who
deserve to retire from active work, but
to benefit them at a time in life when
they are yet able to make an intensive
study of their particular branch of re
search.
