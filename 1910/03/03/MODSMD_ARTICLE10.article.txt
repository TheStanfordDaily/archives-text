Dr. Jordan today makes his first
definite announcement as to the date
of his retirement from the presidency
of this University. Despite the differ
ences of opinion which have at times
existed between the President and
some or all of the students and despite

educators and most brilliant scientists
in the world today, and his successor
will find a discouragingly high criter
ion confronting him.
