The offer of George J. Presley to
act as Rugby coach during the fall of
1910 solves a problem which otherwise
might have proved exceedingly pre
plexing, for we have no doubt as to the
acceptance of the offer. Mr. Presley's
decision, however, leaves open the less
onerous, but nevertheless important,
office of baseball coach, which should
he filled at the earliest convenient op
portunity. Many available men know
the game well enough, but compara
tively few possess, in addition, that
peculiar ability necessary to a suc
cessful coach. The Executive Com
mittee would be fortunate in the ex
treme to discover a candidate in whom
the combination exists so intensively
as in Mr. Presley.
Notwithstanding Mr. Presley's state
ment to the contrary, we feel that he
is making a sacrifice even to under
take Rugby. If so, we know that the
Student Body is not lacking in appre
ciation.
