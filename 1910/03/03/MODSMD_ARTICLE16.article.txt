# QUADS" FOR A DOLLAR
## 120 COPIES OF 1910 ANNUAL TO GO ON SALE. Treasurer Rittigstein Will Conduct Proceedings At Law Steps on Tuesday, March 8. 
### 
For the first time in the history of
the University the Senior class lias de
cided to take charge of the surplus
volumes of the 1910 "Quad" and place
them on sale on March S, at tlie ex
ceedingly low price of one dollar per
copy. This decision was reached yes
terday, when the final report of the
â€¢ Quad" Board of Directors stated to
the class that there was still in their
hands 120 copies of the year book. As
the present Senior Class in its Junior
year, contrary to the custom of the
past, inaugurated a new system of
managing its year book, it now has
the power of dispensing with the bus
iness of the publication. The result
is that the class has taken over the
direction of the sale of these extra
volumes, and has place ! the super
vision of their disposition under the
direction of the class treasurer, H.
Rittigstein, who has arranged for the
books being placed on sale at the
Law steps on * the outer quadrangle
next Tuesday.
Because this is the last semester
that the class of 1910 will be in a
position to settle all accounts pertain
ing to the publication, it is impera
tive that the dispensing of the extra
numbers of the book be made at once.
No reservations for the book will
be made, and the only time and place
the volume will be offered to the pub
lic will be on Tuesday at the Law
steps.
