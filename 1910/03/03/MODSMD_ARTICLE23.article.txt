# CHANGES FOR MINERS
## PROF. NEW SOM RESIGNS AS HEAD OF MINING DEPARTMENT. D.M. Folsom To Fill Position,â€”Four Years Work Required For Graduation With A.B. Degree. 
### 
With a new professor at the head of
the department, and with four instead
of five years of work required for
graduation the students in the de
partment of Geology and Mining will
find their course from now on some
what changed in character. Prof. .1.
F. Newson, who has been the Mining
head of the department for a number
of years, has resigned his position in
order to better take charge of his
private interests, and to be able to de
vote more of his time to a position
which he holds with a large private
company.
D. M. Folsom has been appointed
to succeed Prof. Newsom. Prof. Fol
som was formerly a student at Stan
ford, going from here to Columbia,
where he took the degrees of A. B. and
E. M. Besides his academic work he
has had a wide practical experience in
mining in different parts of the
country.
In an informal address to the up
perclassmen of the department this
morning the incoming professor out
lined the policy that will be followed
in regard to the work required of the
mining engineers in the future. The
most radical change will be that in
the future only four years of work will
be required for graduation, with the
degree of A. 8., and for an additional
year's work the degree of E. M. will
be given.
Much confusion has been occasioned
among the men in the department by
the change made recently from the
four to the five year's course, and
there are many of them who do not
know how near they are to graduation,
nor just what work will be required
of them. Prof. Folsom this morning
made an effort to clear the matter up,
and is to make a point of doing all
that he can to obviate confusion about
the standing of students in going back
to the former system.
