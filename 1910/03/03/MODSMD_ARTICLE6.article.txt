# PRESLEY OFFERS TO COACH RUGBY
## Cardinal Athlete Declares His Willingness to Direct 1910 Fifteen But Declines to Supervise Baseball In 1911. 
### 
The meeting of the Executive Com-,
mittee of the Student Body last even
ing will probably go down in Stanford
history as one of the most important
meetings of the year. The athletic
standing of the University, in so far
as football and baseball constitutes
athletics, was the matter of moment
that the committee had under consid
eration. Coach Presley announced that
he would entertain a proposition al
lowing him to remain as coach during
the Rugby season, but that it would be
impossible for him to stay at the Uni
versity during the baseball season of
1911.
It will be remembered that at a
meeting of the committee last semes
ter, the position of graduate coach
was offered to Presley for the com
plete season of 1910-1911, at the same
salary as that received by him during
the year now drawing to a close. At
that time it was not known what
Presley's attitude toward the matter
was, as it was feared that in the near
future he intended to commence the
professional practice of law. It was
with this idea in mind that, the com
mittee called in Presley last evening
and learned the facts as given above.
This, then, was the problem that
faced the committee: to procure the
best possible coach under the circum
stances from the graduate material
at. hand in the University. In this re
gard, Presley gave his opinion as to
the advisability or necessity of em
ploying an assistant coach during the
football season, in order to work him
up to the fine points in the coaching
of the team. He said that he consid
ered such a course of procedure en
tirely unnecessary, because certain
men, either captains of previous

teams, or prominent players, were
well fitted at the present time, be
cause of their intimate association
with Presley and his methods, to take
up the work without serving as as
sistant or advisory coach. The com
mittee considered that student dis
cussion of the question should be
taken before any definite action on the
part of the committee itself.
In relation to this, there was, of
course, the salary that the coach
should receive for the football season
alone, to consider. This point was
thrashed out at considerable length by
the committee and it was at last de
cided that the proper apportioning of
the salary, was $1">00 for the football
season, which is by far the heavier
portion of the coaching. This divis
ion is also relatively equal to the
amount of importance that the stu
dents themselves place on the two
sports.
The com mi tee wishes it clearly un
derstood by the students in general,
that the question of salary, as a de
ciding factor in the retention of the
present coach through the next foot
ball season, did not enter into the dis
cussion in any way other than the
one mentioned above. They wish it
further understood that the division
of the salary as indicated, was deemed
by all the members of the committee
to be absolutely fair and not in the
least exorbitant or beyond the services
rendered by the coach during the foot
ball season.
Before the question is decided at
the next meeting of the committee, it
is hoped that the students, in general,
will take an active interest in the dis
cussion of the question and in this
way let the committee know what the
belief of the majority is. in regard to
the question of a new graduate coach
to succeed Presley whenever it is evi
dent that he will no longer he able to
control the athletic destines of the
University.
Having disposed in this way of the
football problem, the next thing to he
considered was that of a baseball
coach. It was decided that at the next
meeting, applications and suggestions
as to an available coach for baseball
would be received, and that definite
action would be taken at that time.
The only other business that the
committee acted upon was in regard
to the appointment of two new rubbers
to take their places next Monday af
ternoon. The men appointed were .T.

of the salary as indicated, was deemed
by all the members of the committee
to be absolutely fair and not in the
least exorbitant or beyond the services
rendered by the coach during the foot
ball season.
Before the question is decided at
the next meeting of the committee, it
is hoped that the students, in general,
will take an active interest in the dis
cussion of the question and in this
way let the committee know what the
belief of the majority is. in regard to
the question of a new graduate coach
to succeed Presley whenever it is evi
dent that he will no longer he able to
control the athletic destines of the
University.
Having disposed in this way of the
football problem, the next thing to he
considered was that of a baseball
coach. It was decided that at the next
meeting, applications and suggestions
as to an available coach for baseball
would be received, and that definite
action would be taken at that time.
The only other business that the
committee acted upon was in regard
to the appointment of two new rubbers

The meeting of the Executive Com-,
mittee of the Student Body last even
ing will probably go down in Stanford
history as one of the most important
meetings of the year. The athletic
standing of the University, in so far
as football and baseball constitutes
athletics, was the matter of moment
that the committee had under consid
eration. Coach Presley announced that
he would entertain a proposition al
lowing him to remain as coach during
the Rugby season, but that it would be
impossible for him to stay at the Uni
versity during the baseball season of
1911.
It will be remembered that at a
meeting of the committee last semes
ter, the position of graduate coach
was offered to Presley for the com
plete season of 1910-1911, at the same
salary as that received by him during
the year now drawing to a close. At
that time it was not known what
Presley's attitude toward the matter
was, as it was feared that in the near
future he intended to commence the
professional practice of law. It was
with this idea in mind that, the com
mittee called in Presley last evening
and learned the facts as given above.
This, then, was the problem that
faced the committee: to procure the
best possible coach under the circum
stances from the graduate material
at. hand in the University. In this re
gard, Presley gave his opinion as to
the advisability or necessity of em
ploying an assistant coach during the
football season, in order to work him
up to the fine points in the coaching
of the team. He said that he consid
ered such a course of procedure en
tirely unnecessary, because certain
men, either captains of previous

teams, or prominent players, were
well fitted at the present time, be
cause of their intimate association
with Presley and his methods, to take
up the work without serving as as
sistant or advisory coach. The com
mittee considered that student dis
cussion of the question should be
taken before any definite action on the
part of the committee itself.
In relation to this, there was, of
course, the salary that the coach
should receive for the football season
alone, to consider. This point was
thrashed out at considerable length by
the committee and it was at last de
cided that the proper apportioning of
the salary, was $1">00 for the football
season, which is by far the heavier
portion of the coaching. This divis
ion is also relatively equal to the
amount of importance that the stu
dents themselves place on the two
sports.
The com mi tee wishes it clearly un
derstood by the students in general,
that the question of salary, as a de
ciding factor in the retention of the
present coach through the next foot
ball season, did not enter into the dis
cussion in any way other than the
one mentioned above. They wish it
further understood that the division
of the salary as indicated, was deemed
by all the members of the committee
to be absolutely fair and not in the
least exorbitant or beyond the services
rendered by the coach during the foot
ball season.
