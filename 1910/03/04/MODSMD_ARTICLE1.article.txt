# MARATHON ARRANGED
## CLASSES WILL COMPETE IN LONG RELAY RACE. Quadrangle Club Plans For St. Patrick's Day Event To Be Held on March 18. 
### 
The Quadrangle Club has decided to
perpetuate the custom of holding an
annual Irish Marathon on St. Patrick's
Day which was started last year. At
a meeting of the organization held
today plans were laid for a carnival
of athletics much greater and more
important than any attempted prev
iously. Instead of holding the race on
the holiday of St. Patrick, however,
the Quadrangle Club has decided to
conform with the request of the Jun
iors and will hold the event on the
day following, March IS. which is
Junior Day.
While the Quadrangle Club intends
to make the Marathon a more impor
tant event than was possible last year
the same ideas which made the former
race so popular will be adhered to.
All of the undergraduate classes will
be represented and the "hold-overs"
have signified their intention of en
tering a strong team of runners who
should make some of the other aggre
gations look well to their laurels.
All of the details of the affair have
not been made public since several
are undecided upon and more are to
be added during the next week. It
is certain that the race will consist of
five teams composed of twenty-four
men each. Of these teams each man
will run a quarter mile instead of the
half mile distance used last yearj
It was found in the 13 mile Marathon
run last year that the gaps became too
great as the race progressed. Tbis
was due to unconditioned novices and
detracted from the interest of the
race. It is believed that with men
running but half the distance the
race will present more distinct com
petition throughout.
The teams in entering the race will
be required to pay a nominal entrance
fee as was exacted last year. The
names of competing individuals are
to be handed in by the respective class
captains in time to be placed on the
official program and numbered for the
sake of identification of the individu
als and to count the number of laps
run. The particulars of these ar
rangements will be made public later.
In addition to the Marathon the
Quadrangle Club intends to have three
or four unique "stunts." The nature
erf these numbers will also be an
nounced at a later date.
At the present time the members of
the club wish to call attention to the
necessity of the classes forming teams
at once. Captains should be elected
andt he candidates trained sufficiently
to be able to stand the race without
injury.
