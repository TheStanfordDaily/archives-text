Each published review of dramatic
attractions in Assembly Hall seldom
fails to evoke criticism. Some com
ment adversely upon ihe opinions ex
pressed. This is but natural, for the
ideas of all will never coincide. The
Daily Palo Alto always endeavors to
secure the services of a competent
critic, whose dramatic judgment is
assured, and in withholding the name
of the writer we assume full respon
sibility for the opinions expressed.
That some will disagree is of neces
sity a foregone conclusion. Tf none
did, the independent thinking of Stan
ford students would be at a low ebb.
But so long as the writer's reasona
bleness and honesty of purpose is not
to be questioned, we can see no reason
for communications on the subject,
which, at best, only demonstrate in
dividual opinions, as did the review it
self.. And in the majority of instan
ces, the original critic's right to crit
icise will be far more legitimate than
that of the later contributor.
But there are some who dislike the
kind of review which the Daily Palo
Alto prints. They are easily answered.
The great majority of Stanford people,
who are active in dramatics, and it is
they who are directly concerned, do
not hesitate to choose a real criticism,
in which praise means something, in
preference to a vacuous eulogy, in
which praise means nothing.
