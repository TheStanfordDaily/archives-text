# "QUAD" WANTS STORIES
## LITERARY INTERESTS ARE NOT INTERESTED. Editor Requests Contributions and Sets Final Date At March 12. Art Work Attractive. 
### 
Owing to the fact that very few con
tributions to the 1911 "Quad" prize
story contest have been received,
Editor L. L. Hill of the Junior Annual
has granted an extention of time dur
ing which stories may be received to
March 12. If at that time no more
interest in the contest is shown by the
literary interests of the University,
that department of the "Quad" will be
eliminated.
A literary department has been one
which has been neglected to a con
siderable extent in the past, but in so
far as a "Quad" is a final record book
of all the different student activities,
the present editor has felt that' all
interests should be represented. How
ever, this representation depends en
tirely on the active interest of those
vitally concerned. A prize of $10 will
be given for the best story submitted,
provided it is not more than 3500
words in length. All published liter
ary efforts of the college year will be
considered, however, to fully carry
out the policy of the "Quad."
The work of collecting copy for the
annual is now in its final stages, and
printing will commence within a
week. The last copy will record the
events of Junior Day. The greater
part of the art work is finished and
under the able supervision of F. E.
Hill it has attained an unusually high
standard. Many of the full-page post
ers have been done in oil by the local
artists, prominent among whom are
H. Rosse, 11, Miss H. Park. '11. and
H. V. Poor, '10. A. P. Hill. 13. un
doubtedly is the most voluminous con
tributor in the Art department, bis
exceedingly finished and clever pen
and ink work adorning and embellish
ing many pages of the "Quad." A.
King. '12. is well represented by some
excellent work in crayon, while Miss
H. Thompson. '10. has submitted sev
eral fine pages in work. The alumni
are represented among the artists by
R. J. Slerrett. '02. who as one of the
best of the earlier days has contri
buted a very original full-page poster.
