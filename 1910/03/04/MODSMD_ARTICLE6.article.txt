# TO HOLD UNUSAL MEET
## RESULTS WILL GIVE LINE ON FRESHMAN CHANCES. Several Good First-Year Men Develop In Weight Events.â€”Meet Begins Promptly At 10:45. 
### 
The Freshman and Varsity track
candidates will again mingle in a pre
liminary meet. Saturday morning. As
this is one of the last try-outs for the
1913 men before the Intercollegiate
contest on March 19, the results will
be watched with interest, for they are
expected to give a line on the chances
of the Cardinal team against their
adversaries from across the bay.
During the first of the season the
Freshman team has appeared weakest
in the weight events, but has since
been strengthened by the develop
ment of several promising men. A
L. Frank has been sending the shot
about 38 feet and is a good, consist
ent worker, if in the next two weeks
he makes any improvement whatever
his class will be able to count on him
for some points.
Without any doubt, however, the
palm for persistent work and untiring
effort goes to E. L. Peck. This man
was scarcely able to throw the ham
mer 80 feet at the outset of training,
but by working every day, he has now
succeeded in getting the weight out
over 120 feet. Wilcox is another
Freshman who has proved a surprise.
Until the St. Mary's meet he had not
shown much ability, but on last Sat
urday he overturned the dope and was
the first Stanford man to cross the
line in the hundred.
As for the Varsity, if E. C. Temple
ton, '10, keeps up the pace he has se 1
for himself, the Cardinal may again
stow away at least eight points in ("no
two-mile run. All eason Templet on
has closely pressed Newman, winner
of the event in the last Intercollegiate
meet, and last week bested that ster
ling runner in a shortened race. How
Templeton can travel the full dis
tance is a problem, but predictions
are freely made that he will figure
prominently in the scoring this spring.
Late yesterday afternoon Trainer
Moulton decided to take Templeton
south with the track team. The ath
lete left for Los Angeles in the even
ing on the 8:53 train, having been tin
able to catch the Sunset Express,
which conveyed the rest of the team
to the southland.
Everyone is expected to enter the
meet tomorrow and those who cannot
do so should report to A. E. Roth.
The first race will be tsarted at 10:45
instead of at 11 o'clock as has been
previously announced.
