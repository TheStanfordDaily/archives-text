# GAME MAY END SERIES
## SANTA CLARA AND VARSITY TO PLAY TOMORROW. Two Games Have Been Won By Opponents.—Varsity Is Strong.—Game Off Campus. 
### 
The Varsity will tomorrow play
I what may be the deciding game of the
| Santa Clara series on the mission
town diamond. This contest may de
cide the championship, as the college
j nine won the first two maches of the
season by the respective scores of 6-0
and 7-4. Should the Cardinals win
| from the collegians tomorrow they
will still have a fighting chance for
the best three out of the five-game
series. Santa Clara has been showing
more strength in every game played,
and has several shut-out games to her
credit. But the Cardinal Varsity has
succeeded in getting together hitters
worthy the mettle of a winning team,
and should make the pitching arm of
Allegart, the crack Santa Clara box
| performer, the center of interest
I during the nine innings. Batting aver
ages have taken on new proportions
j the past two weeks, and a formidable
array of bat-wielders will face the op
; posing mound representative. Gil
fillan and Reed are to do the honors
for the Cardinal men, and both should
j give a good account of themselves in
the box position. Ganong and Cochran
are slated for the place behind the
bat. These two batteries at Coach
j Presley's disposal will be looked upon
to enter the firing line in good shape
j and should make large holes in the
Santa Claran hopes of victory. The
Varsity infield seems to be pretty
stable at present, and the usual lialf
; dozen men are on the tapis in making
up and substituting for the outfield
trio.
The team will leave on the 12:43
train for the college town, in prepara
tion for an early game.
The two line-ups are:
Varsity—Catcher, Ganong and Coch
ran; pitcher. Gilfillan and Reed; first
base, Ball; second base. McFadden;
short-stop. M. Mitchell; third base, S.
Mitchell; outfielders, Obear, Beeger,
Childs, McGregor and Gragg.
Santa Clara—Catcher. Trilary;
pitcher. Allegart, Aquen. or Barry;
first, base, Thornton; second base,
Salsberg; short-stop, McGovern;
I third base. Porterfield: fielders, Tram
jutolo. Dooling and Jacobs.
