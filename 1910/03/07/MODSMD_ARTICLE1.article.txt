# REED CONQUERS STRONG ENEMIES
## Ends Santa Clara's Long List of Successes by Pitching Cardinal Varsity to Victory In Eleven Inning Game. 
### 
The Cardinal Varsity showed its
fighting colors last Saturday when it
came out at the head of the list in
an eleven inning battle with the Santa
Clara nine, 4-3 on the latter's field.
With the score tied twice, and the
mission players having to do the tying
in both instances, Stanford finally
affixed a run to the total in the
eleventh that Santa Clara could not
duplicate in its last half of the chap
ter. and ihe game went to the Varsity.
This, by the way, is the first time that
the crack collegians have been de
feated since the prehistoric days on
their schedule. Stanford was fortun
ate enough to break a line of fourteen
consecutive victories. And there is
plenty of honor in the winning. Sev
eral times a college player was hold
ing down the intricate corner with a
teammate on the keystone, both ready
to come home behind a safe hit or an
unlucky error. But just at that time
the Stanford Varsity performed like
time-proven veterans and both base
runners were "left on bases" at the
end of the session. And no small
amount of the credit is due to Reed,
the Varsity pitcher. At the most crit
ical periods of the nerve-destroying
contest he would either mark up a
strike-out or allow an easily fielded
bingle when anything but these two
contingencies would put the game in
Santa Clara's "won" column. Base
stealing and hit-and-run plays to the
plate were decidedly out of fashion.
The Varsity's throws were sure and
the put-outs in practically every case
were a joy to see. The umpire. Towns
end, must here be given his share of
the honor. His decisions on both
sides did not swerve to right or left
by the smallest margin. Everyone
was satisfied, and there was a feeling
of surety that a good and close play
would be rewarded by a fair judg
ment. Varsity hits were scarce, but
they counted, and in three out of four
times hits brought runs. Three-bag
gers were rather common, two being
marked tip by Santa Clara, though one
was caused by the position of the sun,
on a high fly to Beeger. Reed's list of
thirteen "fanned" is imposing.
A few details:
Shut-outs until the fifth, when both
teams hung up a tally. Ball walked,
was pushed to third on easy sacrifices
by Beeger and Childs. and scored on
M. Mitchell's bingle.
Tromutolo got first on S. Mitchell's
error, stole the key-stone, and tore

home on Porterfield's slam. Score,
1-1.
McFadden hit in the sixth. He went
to third and Ganong to second on
error of Reams. Ball was hit. making
full house. Beeger equal to occasion
and scored McFadden and Ganong
with nice tingle. Score, 3-1.
Santa Clara followed with one in the
same chapter. The story is short:
walk by McGovern. tripled over the
platter by Reams. Score 3-2.
Ninth frame saw the game already
Stanford's. But Alligart's transporta
tion, keystone on M. Mitchell's error,
and home on Zarick's slam increased
the total tale by two chapters. Score.
3-3.
The eleventh. McFadden hit.
pushed to second when Ball was hit
by Alligart, and tallied when the ball
thrown by McGovern hit Ball running
between the initial sack and second.
Final score, 4-3.

The Cardinal Varsity showed its
fighting colors last Saturday when it
came out at the head of the list in
an eleven inning battle with the Santa
Clara nine, 4-3 on the latter's field.
With the score tied twice, and the
mission players having to do the tying
in both instances, Stanford finally
affixed a run to the total in the
eleventh that Santa Clara could not
duplicate in its last half of the chap
ter. and ihe game went to the Varsity.
This, by the way, is the first time that
the crack collegians have been de
feated since the prehistoric days on
their schedule. Stanford was fortun
ate enough to break a line of fourteen
consecutive victories. And there is
plenty of honor in the winning. Sev
eral times a college player was hold
ing down the intricate corner with a
teammate on the keystone, both ready
to come home behind a safe hit or an
unlucky error. But just at that time
the Stanford Varsity performed like
time-proven veterans and both base
runners were "left on bases" at the
end of the session. And no small
amount of the credit is due to Reed,
the Varsity pitcher. At the most crit
ical periods of the nerve-destroying
contest he would either mark up a
strike-out or allow an easily fielded
bingle when anything but these two
contingencies would put the game in
Santa Clara's "won" column. Base
stealing and hit-and-run plays to the
plate were decidedly out of fashion.
The Varsity's throws were sure and
the put-outs in practically every case
were a joy to see. The umpire. Towns
end, must here be given his share of
the honor. His decisions on both
sides did not swerve to right or left
by the smallest margin. Everyone
was satisfied, and there was a feeling
of surety that a good and close play
would be rewarded by a fair judg
ment. Varsity hits were scarce, but
they counted, and in three out of four
times hits brought runs. Three-bag
gers were rather common, two being
marked tip by Santa Clara, though one
was caused by the position of the sun,
on a high fly to Beeger. Reed's list of
thirteen "fanned" is imposing.
A few details:
Shut-outs until the fifth, when both
teams hung up a tally. Ball walked,
was pushed to third on easy sacrifices
