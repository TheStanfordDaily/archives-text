Dr. Angell reports that no list of
eligibles for (he Intercollegiate Fresh
man track meet has been forwarded
by either Stanford or California to the
other university. Under the old agree
ment which still remains in force,
such lists should have been received
by both institutions three weeks prior
to the date of the meet, which now is
but twelve days distant. Such neglect
is in direct violation of the existing
pact. The transmission of the names
of prospective participants is a highly
advisable protection, and the chair
man of each faculty committee should
not be rushed for time in which to
pass upon the candidates submitted.
