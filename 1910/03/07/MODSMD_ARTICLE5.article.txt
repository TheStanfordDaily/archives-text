# BREAKS COAST RECORD
## SCOTT VAULTS 12. FEET 6 INCHES BESTING LANAGAN'S MARK. Stanford Team Piles Up 74 Points While University of Southern California Totals 47. 
### 
The event that stands out with
greatest prominence in the Cardinal's
track team's overwhelming victory
over the University of Southern Cali
fornia in Los Angeles last Saturday
is the sensational vaulting of Captain
L. S. Scott, '10. With ease he broke
the Pacific Coast record in the event,
: held by F. R. Lanagan, '08, the new
'mark standing at 12 feet. C inches.
| which betters the old score by 1U
inches. Scott was vaulting in splen
i did form, and had he been less care
| ful of taking risks would easily have
topped the 12-6 record. Ft is not at
all beyond the bounds of possibility
that he might have made history with
a new world's mark. His ankle, how
ever. was in such condition as to
make higher going a dangerous thing,
for the future as well as for the
present.
When the fourteen events in the
meet were over it was found Stanford
had a total of 74 points, with the
southern university far in the rear,
possessing only 47 counting marks.
! These points for the opposing team
| were totalled by the efforts of a
i small cluster of versatile athletes
comprising the southern representa
tives. This was especially evident in
the sprints and hurdles. Very good
time was made in several races: the
100 was negotiated in 10 (lat. and the
220 in the fast time of 22:2. Throop,
of the opponents, was too much for
Coleman in the century, and captured
| that event. Coleman, however, re
versed matters in the 220 and won it
in good form. Porter's time in the
mile was good, 4:35 3-5, as was A.
Johnston's in the halif: 2:01 3-5.
Trotter made a showing in the shot
put. taking the event by a hurl of
43 feet. 10 inches. The two-mile run
was cut to seven laps through an
unfortunate mistake of the judges
and comparative time can not be set
down. Horine continued his remark
able consistency in the high jump bv
