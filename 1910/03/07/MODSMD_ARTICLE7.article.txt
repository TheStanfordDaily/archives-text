# ANNUAL REGATTA ARRANGED.
## California and Stanford Oarsmen to Race Over Sausalito Course On April 16. 
### 
As a result of a conference held
yesterday between the representatives
of the Stanford and California Hoat
Clubs arrangements were made to
hold an eight-oared race and possibly
a four-oared Freshman contest this
spring. April 16 was settled upon as
the date for the Regatta and the
Sausalito course was selected by the
oarsmen as being the most suitable
place to hold the races.
No definite action was taken re
garding the Freshman contest but
from present indications it is probable
that such a race will be arranged.
In case the first-year men row the
course will be shortened from the
regular length, two and one-half miles
to one and a quarter miles.
The Lagunitfe Boat Club has invited
the California oarsmen to enter a
four-oared barge in the Junior Day
Regatta on March IS. The plan which
was proposed contemplates a pursuit
race between the two crews, the
course to be three times around the
lake. While no answer has been re
ceived from the California boatmen it
is probable that the race will be ar
ranged as the Californians are in
favor of the proposition.
