## IRISH MARATHON RACE WILL BE SIX-MILE EVENT. Quadrangle Club Will Give Cup to Winning Team.-Medals Also To Be Awarded. 
### 
More definite plans were made to
day for the Irish Marathon race to he
held by the Quadrangle Club as a part
of the Junior Day festivities of Friday,
i March 18. The details of the principal
|event of the afternoon, the six-mile
relay race to be competed in by teams
of twenty-four men were fixed. Each
class will be expected to enter a team
j and the presidents of the various
classes have been notified. An en
trance fee of $5 will be levied to de
fray the costs of printing and prelim
inary expenses. This fee will be pay
able to L. Scott at once and not later
than Tuesday, March 15. At this
same time the names of the twenty
four men and three substitutes must
be turned In to D. H. Walker. Jr., in
order to facilitate in the compilation
: of a suitable program for the occasion.
The Quadrangle Club will give med
als and a handsome silver cup as
trophies for the event. The class team
[winning the event will be awarded
[the silver cup. while a gold medal
in the shape of a bar such as was
awarded last year will be given to the
track man making the fastest time.
Two other medals will be given to
novices. One will be a silver and
the other a gold, the best time maker
of the novices getting the gold and the
second best time the silver. By novi
ces the Quadrangle wants it distinctly
understood that it is meant to in
j elude only men who have never com
peted on a Stanford team against any
! outside opponents. This eliminates
all runners who have competed on
| local teams against the Olympic Club,
i r. S. C.. Pomona, the University of
California, or in similar meets. The
i big interclass meet is expected as are
the trial meets of the semester. The
I Quadrangle Club has made this stipu
lation to carry out the spirit of the
I meet which is essentially to promote
track athletics among such men who
might never under ordinary condi
tions come out for track and who may
possess ability which would otherwise
have been lost to the Cardinal.
The various classes, including the
hold-overs, are expected to meet dur
ing the present week and elect cap
tains and in some manner, such as
followed last year, select teams. It is
especially urged by the Quadrangle
Club that the various classes attend
to this phase of the situation at once
in order to avoid confusion next
week.
The other features of the program
for the afternoon have not been de
cided, but it is likely that this portion
of the program may be turned over to
members of the Stanford Gym Club.
This will be decided on in the near
future.
