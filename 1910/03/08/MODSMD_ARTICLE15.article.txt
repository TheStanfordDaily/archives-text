Seldom does a semester pass with
out the suspension of several students
for cheating in their University work.
We believe that the installation of an
honor system, such as is in vogue in
the Law School, would tend to mini
mize the number of these offenses, if
not to eliminate them entirely. Every
undergraduate knows that question
able methods are employed far more
often when the instructor is watch
fully present, than when he absents
himself. Accordingly, why not in
augurate throughout the University
that system which has withstood the
must severe tests in a single depart
ment ? We are convinced that many
a student who now stands convincted
of a despicable practice would still
possess a stainless name, if an ap
peal had been made to his honor.
