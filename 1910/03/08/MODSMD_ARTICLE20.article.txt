Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Ninety dollars have come to my
hands in response to my appeal for
the man who lost his leg. I cannot
hope to thank the subscribers individ
ually, therefore I beg permission to
do so through your columns. Espec
ially [ wish to acknowledge the un
selfish labors of the few who collected
the subscriptions. And you, sir, for
so kindly "taking up your pen to
write a few lies"; and "Chappie,"
whose hammer for a moment became
a quill, i wish also to thank for your
good offices in the matter.
I have paid the hospital bill, over
$100; I have enough to buy a new
limb; there remains still the obliga
tion to good Tom Williams, a man
who interprets the Stanford spirit in
terms of self-sacrifice and unselfish
devotion, and his assistant, Dr. Peek.
These we cannot pay in currency, but
Ihey may be assured of the thanks of
the University.
.(Signed) D. CHARLES GARDNER.
