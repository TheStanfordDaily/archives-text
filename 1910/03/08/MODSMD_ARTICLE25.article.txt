# VARSITY TO MEET CITY TEAM.
## Olympic Club To Send Down Strong Aggregation For Next Saturday's Contest On Stanford Oval. 
### 
The Olympic Club's contingent of
star track performers will endeavor
to take the Cardinal team into camp
next Saturday. Usually this meet is
the closest preliminary contest of the
season, as the wearers of the winged
"O" are the classiest bunch of track
men on the Coast. Among the new
faces with the city team this year will
be Macau lay. formerly of Alameda
High school, and Mollis, the Cogswell
sprinter. The clubmen bank on the
Alameda boy to give Wyman a hard
tustle in rhe quarter and state that
Hollis will never be headed in the cen
tury.
The old mainstays "Billy" Powell
and Herbert Cheek, who won so many
points from Stanford in Intercolleg
iate meets of the past will once more
run against their old rival, and if the
two hurdles are in a semblance of
former condition they should have
no trouble in annexing first in both
events. With the privilege of picking
men from the whole Bay region, it is
certain that the club will send down a
strong, well-balanced aggregaton.
