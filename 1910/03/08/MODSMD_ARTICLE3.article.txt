# COMMITTEES STILL DEADLOCKED
## New Intercollegiate Agreement Remains In the Making.-Additional Representatives Requested. 
### 
The Intercollegiate Agreement
Committee met in San Francisco last
night and adjourned with the ques
tion of eligibility still in dispute. In
order that the committee may reach
some definite decision in the near fu
ture. it was decided to ask the execu
| tive committees of the two universi
i ties to each appoint two representa
j tives to meet with the Agreement
Committee and vote on the eligibility
rule. To insure that the men chosen
shall not be biased in any way the
provision was made that the represen
tatives selected shall not lie enrolled
students in either institution and
I shall have power to vote on this
question only.
The Stanford representatives will
] be chosen tomorrow night by the Ex
| ecutive Committee at their regular
j weekly meeting.
The Intercollegiate Committees will
meet again next Monday evening in
San Francisco when it is expected
that a final settlement of the diffi
culty will be reached.
