# SENIORS WILL HOLD SMOKER.
## Men of 1910 To Hold Bonfire Repast In Hills Tuesday Evening. March 15. 
### 
The men of the Senior class will
gather on Tuesday, March 15. for the
first smoker of the semester. This
affair is heing arranged in further
ance of the policy adopted by the
class last semester which calls for
several of these events during the
year. The smoker will be entirely
different from the former affair, the
committee in charge having arranged
for a bonfire supper in the hills which
will be followed by games and con
tests of various sorts.
The arrangements are not fully
complete as yet but it is probable that
the men will leave the corner of the
Engineering building at and proceed
to the place selected for the spread.
Definite plans, including the program,
will be announced later.
