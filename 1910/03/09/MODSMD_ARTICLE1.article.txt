# SHERER MAKES SPEECH
## DECLARES NEW POLITICS DUE TO EVOLUTION. Speaker Lands Roosevelt and Other Politicians for Progressive Policies. 
### 
After numerous postponements and
reannouncements the annual Assembly
in honor of Mr. and Mrs. Stanford,
founders of the University was held
this morning during the last period.
President .T. A. B. Sherer, of Throop
Polytechnic Institute of Pasadena, who
was the speaker of the event, arrived
after being carried through this sec
tion of the state by automobiles, due
to wrecks and landslides.
"The New Politics." the subject in
terpreted by Hi-, Sherer this morning,
was one which not only proved to be
of exceptional interest to the auditors,
but one which gave the audience an
insight to what ground the southern
educator was really t reading* himself
in respect to the new politics, which
is at the present, time giving so much
concern to the thinking public of this
country.
According to Dr. Sherer, the new
politics of this country is one not of
sudden spontaneous creation by a few
fanatic personalities, but a phenomena
due to the advancement of society as n
Hvhole. This evolution of political
science is not so rapid and indiscreet
as declared by many, believes the
Founders' Day speaker, but a move
ment which began in the initial days of
this Union, when the people of the
thirteen colonies banded together to
throw off the rule of Mother England.
This was Our first veritable act of
insurgency, but it was due to a far
different spirit than is now surging
through the insurgents of the present
day, explained Sherer. in depicting the
first, obvious phase that affected this
country, namely factionalism. "Fac
tionalism." said Sherer. "was the first
interest that caused any mutual feel
ing in this country, then came section
alism with the uprising of the anti
slavery movement. Following closely
on the heels of this propaganda came
Nationalism which first exemplified it
self in the administration of Lincoln."
The speaker, in bringing the point
of factionalism before his audience
went into detail and lucidly explained
what part sectionalism played up to
the time of President Lincoln, and the
conclusion of the rebellion.
"Factionalism was prevalent during
the revolution in 1775. It was obvious
during the enactment of the greatest
composition ever created—the con
stitution," proclaimed Sherer. Con
tinuing. he stated that sectionalism
became a fact between 1770 and 1790.
and that Nationalism was impossible
until the administration of the great
emancipator.
ft was at this point of his speech
that the southern gentleman played
the card which clearly showed that
political history which in his opinion
was of great, significance. He said
that Cleveland disrupted the Demo
cratic party, T. Roosevelt raised havoc
with the Republican organization, and
that, this generation would see the
strict and arbitrary principles of the
Southern States broken. In speaking
of Cleveland, the speaker eulogized the
Democratic President, and emphati
cally announced that he believed him
the man who took it upon himself to
raise the Southern states to a higher
standard.
The present status of political condi
tions as interpreted by Dr. Sherer are
deserving of the progressive movement
inaugurated by Roosevelt, and now so
well launched by the wide-awake
members of Congress. He believes in
men who work for the rights of the
masses and defends them. In remark
ing upon this belief lie cited Roose
velt, Pichot. La Follette and others
as men who are now entering upon the
political field with the idea of fair
play, integrity, and common good '<>
all. not persons or definite party in
terest.
The Hague Conference movement,
an idea due to the United States was
one of the many features mentioned
by the speaker as a cause that is mak
ing this government not only great
within its own boundaries, but inter
nationally a factor which is receiv
ing universal comment. Dr. Sherer
expects that some day the date of the
first Hague Conference will be cele
brated with enthusiasm, not far ex

celled by the spirit now shown in this
country on the fourth of July.
rii conclusion the speaker dwelt
upon Ihe significance of a college edu
cation. "College education facilitated
on I \ to look upon the less fortunate
with scorn is a curse," he declared.
"Politics is a science and means great
service. There is no call today louder
than ihe call for statesmen. Roose
velt, ;i Harvard man, has been there,
and Pinchot has shown his hand. The
best sign of the times is that college
men make good statesmen.
The failure of ihe Schubert Club to
appear was due to the various post
ponements and announcements made
in regard to the Assembly.

The failure of ihe Schubert Club to

in regard to the Assembly.
After numerous postponements and
reannouncements the annual Assembly
in honor of Mr. and Mrs. Stanford,
founders of the University was held
this morning during the last period.
President .T. A. B. Sherer, of Throop
Polytechnic Institute of Pasadena, who
was the speaker of the event, arrived
after being carried through this sec
tion of the state by automobiles, due
to wrecks and landslides.
"The New Politics." the subject in
terpreted by Hi-, Sherer this morning,
was one which not only proved to be
of exceptional interest to the auditors,
but one which gave the audience an
insight to what ground the southern
educator was really t reading* himself
in respect to the new politics, which
is at the present, time giving so much
concern to the thinking public of this
country.
According to Dr. Sherer, the new
politics of this country is one not of
sudden spontaneous creation by a few
fanatic personalities, but a phenomena
due to the advancement of society as n
Hvhole. This evolution of political
science is not so rapid and indiscreet
as declared by many, believes the
Founders' Day speaker, but a move
ment which began in the initial days of
this Union, when the people of the
thirteen colonies banded together to
throw off the rule of Mother England.
This was Our first veritable act of
insurgency, but it was due to a far
different spirit than is now surging
through the insurgents of the present
day, explained Sherer. in depicting the
first, obvious phase that affected this
country, namely factionalism. "Fac
tionalism." said Sherer. "was the first
interest that caused any mutual feel
ing in this country, then came section
alism with the uprising of the anti
slavery movement. Following closely
on the heels of this propaganda came
Nationalism which first exemplified it
self in the administration of Lincoln."
The speaker, in bringing the point
of factionalism before his audience
went into detail and lucidly explained
what part sectionalism played up to
the time of President Lincoln, and the
conclusion of the rebellion.
"Factionalism was prevalent during
the revolution in 1775. It was obvious
during the enactment of the greatest
composition ever created—the con
stitution," proclaimed Sherer. Con
tinuing. he stated that sectionalism
became a fact between 1770 and 1790.
and that Nationalism was impossible
until the administration of the great
emancipator.
ft was at this point of his speech
that the southern gentleman played
the card which clearly showed that
political history which in his opinion
was of great, significance. He said
that Cleveland disrupted the Demo
cratic party, T. Roosevelt raised havoc
with the Republican organization, and
that, this generation would see the
strict and arbitrary principles of the
Southern States broken. In speaking
of Cleveland, the speaker eulogized the
Democratic President, and emphati
cally announced that he believed him
the man who took it upon himself to
raise the Southern states to a higher
standard.
The present status of political condi
tions as interpreted by Dr. Sherer are
deserving of the progressive movement
inaugurated by Roosevelt, and now so
well launched by the wide-awake
members of Congress. He believes in
men who work for the rights of the
masses and defends them. In remark
ing upon this belief lie cited Roose
velt, Pichot. La Follette and others
as men who are now entering upon the
political field with the idea of fair
play, integrity, and common good '<>
all. not persons or definite party in
terest.
The Hague Conference movement,
an idea due to the United States was
one of the many features mentioned
by the speaker as a cause that is mak
ing this government not only great
within its own boundaries, but inter
nationally a factor which is receiv
ing universal comment. Dr. Sherer
expects that some day the date of the
first Hague Conference will be cele
brated with enthusiasm, not far ex

celled by the spirit now shown in this
country on the fourth of July.
rii conclusion the speaker dwelt
upon Ihe significance of a college edu
cation. "College education facilitated
on I \ to look upon the less fortunate
with scorn is a curse," he declared.
"Politics is a science and means great
service. There is no call today louder
