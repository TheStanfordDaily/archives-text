The Lagunita Boat. Club needs more
candidates for places on the Freshman
crew. Under present circumstances
it would be quite impossible for th< j
Club to send a first-year eight against
California, and consequently, unless
immediate enthusiasm is displayed
among the Freshmen, the annual In
tercollegiate race will have to be a
four-oared event, although both clubs
would greatly prefer the larger num
ber. As the regatta is now less than
a month in the distance, it is requisite
that any additions to the squad be
madf* at once.
The Lagunita Boat Club has under
taken a discouraging task. In so far
as the spirit of the members can ac
complish it, success will be theirs.
They deserve support, and we urge
every able-bodied Freshman who can
spare the time to take a chance upon
the water.
