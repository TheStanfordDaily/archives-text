# Lindauer on Woman Suffrage.
## 
### 
A highly entertaining and instruc
tive address upon "Woman's Suffrage
in Arozina,' as delivered by S. A.
Lindauer, '10, was received with much
favor and great applause by Nestoria
Literary Society yesterday evening.
Lindauer made an exhaustive analysis
of the subject and presented the facts
in a virile and vivid manner. Prof.
B. E. Howard, who was to have spoken
on "Woman Suffrage," was unable to
be present.
The regular debate was upon the
subject "Resolved, That an amend
ment to the constitution should be
adopted extending the franchise to
women." The negative ,as upheld by
P. Eliel, '13, and S. L. Sayer, '13, won
the debate. H. C. Loud, '13, and W. C.
Porterfield, '13, were the affirmative
speakers.
