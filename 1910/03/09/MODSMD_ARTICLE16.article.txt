# ONLY EIGHT MORE DAYS
## "IOLANTHE" WILL BE STAGED THURSDAY, MARCH 17. Despite Short Time for Preparation of Play, Juniors to Present Excellent Opera. 
### 
Despite the limited time that the
Junior Opera Committee has had in
which to whip the coining play of
"lolathe" into shape, the prospective
results are more than encouraging
and the promise of a finished produc
tion is good. The coaches, Mathieu
â€¢uid Perlet, have been in a large part
responsible for the rapid progress that
has been made within the past few
weeks in the development of the
opera and with their undivided atten
tion from now on until March 17, the
Junior Class should present a re
markably well fiished production.
Rehearsals are now being held in
the Assembly Hall for the purpose of
enabling the various members of the
cast to And the pitch in their voices
most suitable in a hall of that size,
while the choruses are becoming
rapidly proficient in the different
dancing numbers which the piece calls
for. In these rehearsals, both the
principals and the men's and women's
choruses are appearing at the same
time upon the stage in anticipation of
the final ensembles that are to be
made.
At one time during the progress of
the opera a grand ensemble of seven
ty-live persons will appear upon the
stage.
Costume pictures of the cast have
been secured and have been arranged
in poster form. These depictions of
various parts of the opera will be
seen upon (lie campus tomorrow
morning, and will present a graphic
idea of the nature of "lolanthe" and
the elaborate accessories that are to
be used in the make-up of Ihe opera.
The character of the book this year
calls for a complete set of the most
elaborate costumes that can be ob
tained, and not lying within the usual
province of light operas, they will
necessarily have to be specially or
dered.
Roth Coach Perlet. and F. Mathieu
will take charge of the rehearsal this
evening.
