# WILL BREAK RECORD
## SO CLAIM THE ADHERENTS OF SPRINTER WOOD. Olympic Club Will Enter Phenomenal Runner in Meet.-Weather Man Favors Training. 
### 
Yet another Stanford track record
may be relegated to the rear in the
near future. The mark in especial
danger is that for the 100-yard dash,
and ihe time for erasing it from the
Stanford log-book is next Saturday
afternoon. The man who is expected
to do ibis is Wood, from Berkeley
High School, who covered the century
in even time a few weeks ago in San
Francisco.
Although Wood is touted as a won
der, the busy Stanford student will
have to lÂ»e shown a great, deal before
he believes that this phenom will
leave Coleman, Smitherum, et al, very
may yards in the rear.
Ollie Snediyar, football player and
all-round athlete, will be one of the
entries in the weight, events and may
also sign up for the broad-jump. Al
though the former California man does
not now participate in many athletic
contests, he delights in donning a
track suit and testing his ability
against Stanford's representatives.
With this array of talent opposed to
them, the wearers of the Cardinal
will have to exert themselves to land
a victory. The ideal weather for
training which has prevailed during
the past week, however, has filled the
track men with energy and "Dad"
Monitor) with optimism. According to
the veteran trainer, if the men im
prove as much in the next few weeks
as they have in the past fourteen days.
Stanford will be able to give a good
account of itself when it meets the
Blue and Gold.
The work of A. Johnston, '10, in the
meet with the University of Southern
California last week, has placed a
broad smile on the face of Captain
Scott. After taking third in the mile
run, finishing close pu, Johnston came
back with a rush i the half, clipping
off the distance to the tune of 2:01:3.
Being an extremely easy runner, never
staining himself. Johnston should at
least repeat this performance against
California.
A. T. King, '12, who in the past year
has developed into a promising quar
ter-miler, met with an unfortunate
accident a few days ago, severly
wrenching his ankle, and it is prob
able that the injury will keep him on
crutches for some time.
