# 1913 Will Enter Marathon.
## 
### 
Although the Freshman Intercolleg
iate meet on March 19 will eliminate
the most prominent track men of the
Class of 1913 from the Irish Marathon
the preceding day, nevertheless the
first-year men are planning to enter
a team, and urge that a sufficiently
large number sign up. Names should
lie handed in to H. C. Boyd, R. W. Wil
cox, C. H. Beall. R. B. Andrews, or W.
M. Argabrite.
