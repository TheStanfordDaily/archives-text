# MANY STARS ON TEAM
## OLYMPIC CLUB HAS FORMIDABLE ARRAY OK ATHLETES. Suedigar, Gerhardt, Macaulay, Craig, Rose, Gilmore and Possibly Miller Will Appear. 
### 
The Olympic Club, which is to send
a track team down to meet the Cardi
nal runners on Saturday, has high
hopes of winning the meet, and with
the number of promising athletes that
they number on their team it indeed
would appear that the Stanford men
will meet foemen worthy of their
steel, and that they Mill be kept busy
from the first crack of the gun. The
Olympic Club possesses some of the
best, athletes around the bay on its
team, and some indication of what
they can do can be gained from the
mere mention of such names as Rose,
j. o. Miller. Macau lay, Suedigar and
Hartwell.
The pole vault and the high jump
are the only events in which they ex
pect that Stanford will win without
some lively competition for first
places, and in the high they have one
man, Bressi. who is good for 5 feet 11
inches.
Ralph Rose, the Healdsburg wonder,
needs no introduction to make known
his ability in the shot put and throw
ing the hammer. Besides Rose, Gil
more and Suedigar. the former Cali
fornia athlete, will be in both these
events, and in addition, Coolidge, for
merly of Healdsburg and an inter
scholastic record holder, will throw
the hammer.
In the 100 and the 220 the Olymp
ians have some exceptionally good
men. R. Hollis and P. Gerhardt both
having records of 10.1. and Dickson
and Suedigar have been making some
fast time recently in both these
sprints.
The Winged O is scarcely less well
represented in the 440-vard dash, hav
ing Leo Meyer, formerly of Lowell
High School. Claude Moss, Gerhardt
and E. Macaulay all of whom are able
to cover the distance in ">2 or less, to
look after its interests.
John O. Miller will very probably be
seen in the half, with E. Craig, who
is good for about 2:01:3 as his team
mate.
Craig, who is credited with some fast
time in the four-lap events, will be
seen in the mile, along with Mason
Hartwell. the wonder from Oakland.
Newman will be kept moving in the
two mile, as he will have \\. Garvin,
Hoberg and Woods, all of whom can
cover the distance in 10:15 or
better.
In the hurdles they have Beeson,
the speedy lad from Healdsburg. F.
Bressi and Kendricks, who should be
able to land two places in these events
if they are running in anything like
their usual form.
Suedigar, Baumbaugh and Little
page. the first two of whom are good
for 22 feet, will represent them in the
broad jump, where they will doubtless
be able to make a good showing.
Nor will they lack a relay team able
to cover the ground in rapid time, for
thf five will be picked from the follow
ing bunch of speedy sprinters: Mac
aulay. Miller, Gerhardt. Craig. Bee
son. Meyer. Moss. Dickson and
Hollis.
