Founders' Day is past. As usual, it
occasioned but little deviation from
the daily routine and but few fully
realized its importance. The "cere
monies," meaning the Assembly, were
as far from being suited to or com
memorative of our Founders as hu
man ingenuity could conceive. Simi
lar days at other institutions are in
variably celebrated in a manner be
fitting their meaning, but here ar
Stanford the tendency of recent years
has been precisely the opposite. In
190t>, Founders' Day was last observed
in a worthy fashion. On March 9 of
that year Assembly was addressed
by Professors Anderson and James
and by Dean Hodges, all of whom
spoke on topics pertinent to the event,
fn 1907 a special gathering of students
was omitted. The announcement was
made that the Rev. .T. M. McLeod
would speak at the regular Sunday
services on March 10 and that "he
would probably make some recogni
tion of the day." His subject was
"Truth and Its Influence on Charac
ter." The 1908 Assembly heard the
Rev. Jenkin Lloyd Jones make some
incidental reference to Senator Stan
ford whiile telling of the "Power of
Poetry"; and then it was that Dr.
Jordan read a short letter written by
the Senator. In 1909 the President's
eulogizing of Mrs. Stanford was coun
teracted by the address of a visiting
professor upon "Ideals in Business

Life." "The New Politics" served to
commemorate the occasion in 1910.
A mere Assembly is a sufficiently
ordinary manner in which to celebrate
the day of our Founders. But if 110
better method can lie devised, at least
that short hour should lie devoted to
a proper and meaningful observance.
