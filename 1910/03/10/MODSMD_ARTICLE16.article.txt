The Junior Class in regular meeting
today decided to give all members of
that class the opportunity to become
better acquainted and to arouse a
more intense class enthusiasm than
that organization already possesses.
To accomplish this end, the Juniors
have adopted the plan of holding a
"jolly-up," at which all third-year
students will have the chance to meet
and know personally other members
of the class. This rally will be held
tomorrow evening and all members of
the class of 1911 are cordially invited
by the committee that has charge of
the arrangements for the evening to
attend. The committee is not pre
pared to announce the definite de
tails.
W, S. Porter, Jr., was selected by the
class to lead the 1911 Marathoners on
Junior Day in the six-mile endurance
test and as the teams must be sub
mitted within the next few days, Cap
tain Porter has requested that all
Juniors anticipating trying out for
the team hand in their names to him
at the earliest possible date.
Reports from the chairman of the
various committees that have charge
of the Junior Week festivities were
also heard by the class. Chairman
Porter of the Junior Day Committee
made an especial appeal to the mem
bers of the class to assist the com
mittee in the inauguration of Junior
singing on the evening of March 1(i,
when the committee has planned to
hold a special musical fete at Lake
Lagunita. This innovation will intro
duce the third-year activities and
Chairman Porter is very desirous to
.start the week in the most successful
manner possible. To make this event
a success the class will necessarily
have to support the committee in its
work upon that evening.
Class sweaters were awarded to the
