## Executive Committee Retains Present Director. Theile Will Supervise Baseball in 1911. Lanagan and Brown Appointed. 
### 
The retention of Presley as coach
for the next Rugby season, the ap
pointment of W. Theile, '08, as
graduate coach to supervise baseball,
and the appointment of D. E. Brown,
'97 and J. F. Lanagan. '00, as gradu
ate members of the Intercollegiate
Agreement Committee, were t lie prin
cipal items of business transacted a<
the regular session of tlie Executive
Committee last evening.
The offer of Graduate Coach G. L.
Presley to coach the football team
through the next Rugby season, as re
ported in ilie Daily Palo Alto of one
week ago. was the main item of dis
cussion. It was generally considered
by the members of the Committee, that
the retention of Presley in the posi
tion of Graduate Coach as long as
possiible, was the only thing that,
could lie done in justice to the Univer
sity as a whole. So much of the ath
letic standing of the University de
pends upon the football season's suc
cessful culmination that Presley's
presence as coach next year was con
sidered as the only outcome by the
college public in general. With this
in mind as well the University's ath
'etic status during 1910-11 the com
mittee decided to retain Presley for
the first semester of the season at a
salary of $1500 for the semester.
Graduate Manager Burbank was furth
er instructed to draw up a contract
with Presley in these terms.
This action left the position of
baseball coach for the second semester
still open. Applications were re
ceived and considered from various
sources. After a careful consideration
of all the available candidates for the
position, the Committee finally de
cided that the man best fitted to fill
the position was W, C. Theile. 'o,>.
Theile held down the position of pit
cher for the Varsity for three years,

and has also had considerable ex
perience in the realm of professional
baseball. There is no man among th. j
available graduates in the University,
so well fitted for the position as
Theile. He is graduate student in the
Law School, a member of Delta Upsi
lon fraternity, of Delta Chi, and of
Skull and Snakes. The salary de
cided upon by the Committee was
$500 for the semester. As in the case
of Preseley, Manager Burbank was in
structed to draw up a contract with
Theile.
Because of the difficulty of arriving
at a conclusion in regard 10 eligibiility
rules, ihe Intercollegiate Agreement
Committee, as reported in the Daily
Palo Alto, decided at their last meet
ing to have the executive committees
of the two universities, appoint men
from among their graduates, to act
with the regnlf.i committee in clear
ing up the eligibility question. These
men were appointed last evening They
are D. E. Brown, '97. ,T. F. Lanagan,
'00. Brown has acted as timer at the
Intercollegiate football for
many yea.-sand is one of the alumni
most activelv interested in athletics
in the University. Lanagan, as every
one know", +he football and base
ball coach immediately preceding
Presley. It was he who instilled the
great fighting spirit into our teams, and
inaugurated the "Lanagan Regime. '
Both of these men are well acquainted
! with the conditions and are capable of
! taking care of the interests of the
I University to the best advantage of
all concerned. California has appoint
ed two graduates to her committee,
and (he joint committee will, in all
probability, meet next Monday evening
at the Palace Hotel, and settle, once
and for all. the question of eligibility
and the interpretation of the four
year clause.
