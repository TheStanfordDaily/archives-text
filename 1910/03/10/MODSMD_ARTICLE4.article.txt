Roble has been favored with the sec
ond and probably the last, appearance
of measles this semester. The latest
sufferer from the disease is Miiss P.
Williams, *10, who was taken ill a few
days ago. Neither Miss Williams nor
Miss Park are seriously sick and it is
probable that the latter will soon be
released from detention.
