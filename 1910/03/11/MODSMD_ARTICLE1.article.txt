While it is has not been authoritivo
ly announced, the young ladies of the
campus may be interested in knowing
that probably J. O. Miller will be seen
in competition. Admission to the
meet will be twenty-five cents.

of the meet tomorrow as have con

dueled the preliminary contests and,

persons not participating, are re
quested to keep off the field.
The classiest congregation of track
athletes seen around these parts for
some time can be viewed tomorrow af
ternoon at 3 o'clock on the Varsity

the Cardinal are in fine fettle, the
marks made in tomorrow's contest
will probably outshine the records of
any other campus meet of the year,
not excluding the Intercollegiate. It
is admitted that only by the greatest
effort will the club men be defeated.
