One week from tomorrow comes the
Freshman meet, and five weeks hence
the Varsity contests. These will draw
near quickly enough, and in the
meantime we are confronted with to
morrow, when the Cardinal team is
to participate in the first track meet
with a visiting team on the Stanford
oval. With discouraging prospects at
the outset, the 1910 team has fought
an np-hi 11 battle until now we feel
justified in predicting a victory over
the Blue and Gold. In view of the
game struggle which the men have
been making and the relatively few
preliminary meets on the schedule,
the Student Body should loyally sup
port the team by appearing tomorrow
at the first and perhaps the best meet
prior to the Intercollegiate.
