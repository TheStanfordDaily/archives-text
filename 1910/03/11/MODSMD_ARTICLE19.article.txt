# HOLD-OVERS ENTER MARATHON
## "Cap" Bee Elected to Captain Famous Veterans of the Distant Past. 
### 
The Hold-Overs met this afternoon
at the Engineering Corner and held an
enthusiastic meeting. The chief topic
of conversation was the Quadrangle
Club's Marathon to be held next Fri
day. "Cap" Bee, because of his rec
ords in the past, was elected to lead
the two dozen speedy men who will
run for the sake of their Alma Mater
and their dear departed fellow class
men.
The plans of the Hold-Overs are
fixed as to the campaign which the,\
will follow in the course of the race
and feel confident of carrying off all
of the medals and the cup to boot.
Such runners as Harry Robertson,
Harry Horton, Cortez Shelton, and
"Dutch" Roth have signed the training
list and will begin work for the big
race.
"Cap" Bee has the training list and
lacks a complete team. He announces
that the vacancies on the team may
be filled by application and try-out.
The Hold-Overs will have no speed
limit. It is desired that the team be
made up as soon as possible in order
that Bee can arrange the runners in
the order of classes.
The plans for the Marathon are pro
gressing rapidly and from the amount
of enthusiasm shown it is expected
that, the meet this year will draw a
larger crowd than in the past. The
meet will be held early in the after
noon. 2 o'clock has been set for the
time, and the race will be run off in
rapid order to admit of all partici
pants and spectators attending other
affairs of the day.
