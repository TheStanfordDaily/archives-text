# EVERYONE CAN SEE THE GAME.
## Varsity and Independents Play Tomorrow and Usual Admission Eliminated. 
### 
In order to let the majority of the
University know that there is a Var
sity baseball team and that this nine
is playing regular games on its sched
ule. absolutely no admission is to be
charged tomorrow afternoon when the
Cardinal team lines up with Ireland's
Independents. The only reason, and
a very important one it is, for this
special determination on the part of
Graduate Manager Hurbank comes
from the fact that not more than one
eighth of the entire total of Stanford
students have ever appeared ar one
time on the grandstand to see their
Varsity team play its contests. Games
come and go and a scant 200 people
spend twenty-five cents each for a
seat and a chance to see how this
typical college game is getting on it
their own university. The play to
morrow begins at 1:30 sharp, in order
that interest in the Olympic Club-Var
sity track meet may be transferred
from the diamond.
The teams playing tomorrow will be
worth seeing. The Varsity will have
its regular outfield trio and infield
quartet and on the mound is to have
Reed, who defeated Santa Clara a
week ago. Ganong is to receive his
delivery. It should be worth twenty
five cents to see these nine men per
form, when the attractiveness of the
game is increased by the men whom
B. C. Ireland will bring from San
Francisco to make up his aggregation.
Among his new names will be "Joe"
Nealon, who is a former Pittsburg
and Sacramento State League player.
He is slated for first base. Goslinsky,
the giant California player is to pitcli
for the Independents.
The opposing teams will be:
