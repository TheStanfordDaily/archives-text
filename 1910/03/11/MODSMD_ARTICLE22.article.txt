# ALL-STARS TAKE SECOND GAME.
## In a Twenty-three Hit Contest the Varsity Loses To Visiting Nine. 
### 
By scoring one run in the ninth
inning the All-Stars won from the
Varsity for the second time this sea
son, with a tally of 7-5. The Varsity
reduced a 6-2 lead by three runs in the
eighth, but sacrifices and hits brought
a runner across the platter for the
visitors, which the Cardinal men
could not duplicate.
A total of twenty-three hits during
the nine chapters shows the character
of the play. The Varsity scored its
three tallies in the eighth on three
hits, two doubles and one single.
