# ANOTHER CHANCE TO DANCE.
## Boat Club Will Raise Funds By Giving Informal in Palo Alto Armory on April 30. 
### 
The Lagunita Boat Club is to hold
a benefit dance on Saturday evening
April 30. Permission was granted the
club to hold the affair today by the
Student Affairs Committee. The dance
which will be strictly informal is to
be held in the new Armory in Palo
Alto. Tickets will be placed on sale
at $2 each.
The purpose of the dance is to raise
money to defray the expenses of the
oarsmen. Rowing is an expensive
sport to keep up and one in which no
returns are received in the form of
admission fees to regattas and the
like. With several trips in prospect,
the club is in great need of money.
The dance will be conducted along
the same lines as the one given by
Skull and Snakes for the benefit of
the Stanford Union, which was
thoroughly enjoyed by all who attend
ed. In going to the dance in large
numbers the members of the student
body will not only show that they are
behind the club in their endeavor 1o
keep rowing alive at Stanford, but will
enjoy an extremely pleasant evening
as well. The date comes at a time
when there is a distinct lull in stu
dent body activities, so that no other
diversion will interfere. Coming as it
does after training season and several
weeks before final examinations, no
one will be barred from attending the
dance for these reasons.
The date on which the tickets go on
sale and full particulars will be an
nounced later, but now is the time *o
make your date.
