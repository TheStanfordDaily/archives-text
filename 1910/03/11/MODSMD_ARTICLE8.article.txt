# WILL VIEW SUNRISE
## SWAINS MIST RISE EARLY TO SECURE "IOLANTHE" SEATS. Junior Opera Tickets Will Go on Sale Monday Morning.â€”Brilliant Singe Effects Promised. 
### 
Those who venture abroad betimes
on Monday morning will no doubt dis
cover a considerable group apparently
mounting guard in front of the Hook
store. Nor should this group be mis
taken for Sun worshippers gathered
for an early glimpse of their patron

deity. Quite otherwise. It will be
composed of anxious swains bent on
securing the most desirable seats for
"lolanthe" the Junior Opera, which
will be presented by the 1911 Class on
the evening of Thursday, March 17.
The admissions, which go on sale at
both the Bookstore and the Stanford
Pharmacy will bring, the usual prices
of $1.00, 75 and 50 cents. The sale
will begin at S. and according to the
accepted custom each purchaser will
be allowed to secure but ten seats.
No opera that has ever been given at
Stanford has possessed the possibili
ties that are to be found in "lolanthe."
The scenes are laidi in Arcadia where
the fairies and all the other elves
hold sway. Most elaborate stage set
tings are required to depict the above
scenes and these have been fully pro
vided for under the able direction of
(}. 10. Lyon of San Francisco. The
chorus is the largest ever seen on the
Stanford stage, being composed of
about seventy people. The girls will
be garbed in the showiest of fairy
costumes which will display all the
hues of the rainbow.
Under the efficient tutelage of
Coaches Mathieu and Perlet both the
cast and chorus are developing a
marked degree of proficiency in then
respective parts. With less than a
week intervening before the perform
ance every available period of time
will be spent in rehearsals and, with
the progress already made, a thorough
ly finished opera is assured.
