# WORLD MARK IN PERIL
## SCOTT THREATENS BEST RECORD IN POLE VAULT. Narrowly Misses at 12 Feet Inches.—Olympics Fall Before Cardinal Team 78 2-3 to 43 1-3. 
### 
The Stanford track came very near
being the scene of a new world's rec
ord in the pole vault during the Var
sity-Olympic Club track meet last
Saturday afternoon, when Captain L
S. Scott barely scraped the bar off the
uprights at the height of 12 feet, 10V 4
inches. Had he cleared the crosspiece
safely he would have bested the high
est mark made by any athlete in the
world, a mark which now stands at
12 feet. 9% inches, held by ex-Captain
Walter Dray of Yale. As it is, how
ever, Scott is still the possessor of the
world's Intercollegiate record in this
event, his clearing the bar at 12 feet.
0 inches in the southern meet last
week being ahead of the performance
of Dray's intercollegiate height which
was 12 feet. inches. Scott only
took four tries at the new world's
mark, but it is probable that before
many weeks the Stanford campus will
have the coverted record within irs
borders.
Although somewhat overshadowed
by the pole-vaulting, yet the new Stan
ford record which D. P. Crawford's
sturdy hammer-throwing placed on
the lists during the afternoon is still
able to be noted. His hurl of 14TI
feet, '» inches passes the distance re
corded by J. W. Woolley. '12, last year.
It was the individual performance that
drew interest in the meet, not the
actual number of points made by the
competing teams. Stanford's total of
78 2-3 shows a decisive superiority
over the Olympic Club, whose men
were able to assemble but 43 1-3
points. The Varsity's nine first places
and the relay makes a very respect
able summary at first hand, and re
veals to some extent just what th°
Cardinal athletes are capable of. In
those track events in which the Stan
ford runners had looked forward to i
hard struggle for supremacy there
was little difficulty in keeping the
winning points on the Cardinal side
of the tally-board. Both Coleman and
Smitherum bested Snedigar in the
final heat of the 100. Coleman doing
10-1. The two Varsity sprinters also
had no trouble in conquering the
"Winged O" men in the 220. In the
mile, L. H. Price, '13, deserves all the
honor. As a complete surprise he
easily ran ahead of the two San Fran
cisco club men in the back stretch of
the race, and crossed the line the win
ner in 4: 48 2-5. His running is full
of promise and is an encouraging help
to both Varsity and Freshman pros
pects. The two-miler, Garvin, Olymp
ic Club, came up to expectations and,
with his team-mate, Woods, captured
the eight-lap event, winning over
both Templeton and Newman, the
Stanford runners. Newman was not
doing up to his record form. A John
ston's 880, Horton's shot-putting, and
the relay men all deserve notice. The
Cardinal high-jumpers were not up to
standard. Snedigar was the shin
ing light for the Olympics. His
table of achievements reads: first in
the broad jump, with emphasis on his
