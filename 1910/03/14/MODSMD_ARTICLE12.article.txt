A week ago we expressed the de
sire that an honor system in all ex
aminations might be inaugurated
throughout the various departments of
the University. The suggestion has
aroused some little comment. We
think that the idea is at least worthy
the arguing, and consequently we
would gladly have it argued. Student
and professor alike are interested.
We would ask that each express his
views. The columns of the Daily Palo
Alto are open to a discussion of the
system, pro and con, and we crave
opinions on the subject. As already
stated, we think that the installation
of such a plan would be of extreme
benefit. If we are right, the telling b\
others would naturally give us great
joy. If wrong we would equally ap
preciate the knowledge of it, as furth
er labor on the subject would then be
spared us.
