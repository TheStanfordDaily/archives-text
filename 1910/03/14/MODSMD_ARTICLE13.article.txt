"If ever there was a team deserv
ing the support of a Student Body, ii
is the 1910 Varsity baseball nine."
These words, uttered by a prominent
alumnus of San Francisco who has
witnessed several recent games, ex
press with precision ihe sentiments of
the Daily Palo Alto. And yet seldom
has a team been accorded weaker sup
port. Only a few of the most enthu
iastic fans appear on the bleachers at
the various contests.
Twelve days remain before the first
game with the Blue and Gold. Take
advantage of them. Help the Varsity
nine to grasp its brilliant opportunity
of winning the series of 1910.
