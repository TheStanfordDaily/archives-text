# TO PRESENT BLIVEN'S FARCE.
## English Club Will Produce "The Eternal Girl," a Playet by a Prominent Member. 
### 
At the next meeting of the English
Club, on Wednesday, March 23, the
dramatic section of the club is prepar
ing to present a one-act play of local
production. The piece will probably
be a short farce, entitled "The Eternal
Girl," which appeared originally in
the 1909 English Club Year Book, and
of which B. O. Bliven, '11. is the auth
or. Neither the scene of the produc
tion nor the participants have been
selected as yet. This is the first of a
series of meetings planned for the
production of amateur plays written
by members of the club. The dra
matic section is under the charge of
G. F. Morgan, '10. Alternating with
these meetings will be Round Table
evenings when stories and poems pro
duced in the club will be read and
discussed. Two of these metings have
already been held, and have proved
highly successful.
