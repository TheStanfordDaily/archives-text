That a great deal of interest is be
ing taken iu the coming production of
"lolanthe" by the Junior class is
shown by the first day's sale of tickets
which amounted to about $650. This
figure is a trifle less than that recorded
on the first day of "The Man from
Home" sale which broke all previous
records. The best seats are practical
ly all sold out at the Bookstore, but
some choice ones are still left at the
Stanford Pharmacy in Palo Alto. The
usual prices of $1, 75 and 50 cents
prevail.
