### 
That the Stanford Soccer players
are fast learning the finer points ol
the game was demonstrated again last
Saturday when the Grays held down
the crack Burns team to a 3 to 3 score.
Although playing a lifeless game in
comparison to those earlier in the sea
son the local team was easily the
equal of the San Francisco aggrega
tion and had it not been for the superb
defense of the Burns backfield the
score would tell a different story. All
through the game the Stanford men
were the aggressors, and time and
again the ball would be in shooting
distance of the Burns goal when by
clever dribbling and long punts the
backs would shatter any chances of a
Stanford score.
Forwards —Hubbard, Doron, Erb,
Fyfe. and Williams; halfs —Hamilton,
Reynolds, and Humphrey; fulls —Mc-
Cann. and Higgins, goal—Stuart.
