# HITS COVER DIAMOND
## VARSITY BINGLES THIRTEEN OUT OF TWENTY-ONE TOTAL. Ireland's Independent's Are Swamped by a 14-3 Score.- Reed Allows His Share of Smashes. 
### 
A good, old-fashioned "slug-fest"
was indulged in last Saturday after
noon on Stanford Field when the Var
sity overwhelmed the Ireland's In
dependents team, 14-3. Twenty-one
hits in seven innings was the record
made, and the Cardinal batters came
out ahead in the race with a total of
thirteen bingles, of which eight were
put on the books in the opening chap
ter. S. Mitchell's long homer took the
prize, and the other hits trailed along
in the rear; a triple, three doubles,
and eight singles making up the whole
story. Reed very surprisingly let the
visitors line out three smashes for
the first three men up ar the plate,
one for three bases, a double and a
respectable single. Then he tightened
up and the next three Independents
went out in order. Goslinsky was out
of his usual running in the first, only
much more so than Reed. The first
five Cardinal wielders of the bat all
added a little more percentage to their
season's averages. As a run-getter
Obear was easily the star. On two
hits, a walk, and a hit by pitcher he
registered at home four times. He
helped himself around the circuit also
by two pretty steals. In general, the
Varsity players showed a gratifying
ability to hit, and also revealed the
degree of patience which is required
to wait for four wide ones from the
mound, to get a gift of free transport
ation to the initial sack.
The first frame furnished far and
away the most picturesque array of
happenings put together on the turf
this year. The Independents started
off with O'Connor, who hit for three.
He scored when Sheehan followed
with a bingle for two more. Moski
mon in turn hit and brought in Shee
han. This was the end, and Kennedy,
Bliss and Goslinsky were down, one.
two. three.
Obear, S. Mitchell, Ganong. Rail, and
Beeger bingled very nicely, and these
slams, with McFadden's walk sand
wiched in, netted a neat half-dozen
runs, M. Mitchell bringing in Beeger
and finishing up the round of nine men
up. Then Obear started in all over
again, and duplicated his previous ex
hibition. He singled, stole second, and
tallied on McFadden's hit. exactly as
he had done ten minutes before, with
the exception that it was S. Mitchell's
home-run that sent him to the plate.
S. Mitchell, after Obear's second up,
was transported to first and scored on
a hit and Pemberton's error. First
inning score: 9-2; hits, S-3.
