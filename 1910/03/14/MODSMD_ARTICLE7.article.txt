# MUCH HUMOR LITTLE SPEED.
## Hold-Overs Will Enter Burlesque Team in Coming Marathon.--Claim Fifth Place With Ease. 
### 
One of the features which made the
Marathon race of last year so popular,
the burlesque of the "Hold.Overs."
will be repeated in the Quadrangle
Club's event scheduled for this week.
The Hold-Overs have decided upon a
stunt which will add greatly to the
interest in the race. Their plans are
being kept secret as to detail, but it is
understood that the men who will rep
resent by-gone days will make an at
tempt to add humor to the situation
rather than speed to the laps.
The various class captains have all
announced thar trials will be run and
those intending to try jtor places
should attempt to qualify at the earl
iest possible time. The entry list will
close tomorrow night unless further
rains make it advisable to stretch the
time until Wednesday at noon. All
names should be handed to D. H.
Walker, Jr., not later than Tuesday
evening at which time the entrance
fee will also be payable.
A souvenir program for the occasion
will be arranged, and the various
teams will be entered in the book.
This program will contain also the
rules of the race, particularly of the
prizes, and purposes of the meet.
