# TEAM HAS A CHANCE
## SANTA CLARA SERIES STILL WITHIN VARSITY'S GRASP. Gilfillan Will Work To Bring a Victory to the Cardinals Tomorrow.—Game Will be Close. 
### 
Tomorrow at Santa Clara the Cardi
nal nine will endeavor to turn its
fighting chance for the Varsity-Santa
Clara championship into a real live
prospect. Having snatched the third
contest of the series from out of the
very hopeful hands of the mission
town men, the fighting chance is still
operating for the fourth game. Win
ning this match, the Varsity will even
up matters all around, and will make
"the final game of the five on the list
decidedly interesting. And this fifth
struggle, should it develope into a
battle for the championship, will fur
nish followers of the Cardinals with
plenty of diversion, since the game
will be brought to Stanford Field, next
Tuesday being set for the date. The
two best exhibitions of baseball that
the Varsity has made this year were
both off the campus, and the Univer
sity in general is far from being
aware of what the team can do under
stress. Gilfillan is slated to give the
Varsity another chance for the cham
pionship tomorrow, by making the
games in the series read two for each
team. He has been resting for the
past ten days, having slightly torn a
muscle in his pitching arm. He is,
however, in fine fettle at present, and
it is within the range of probabilities
that he will be very difficult to find in
the matter of hits tomorrow. More
over, Santa Clara is not a record
breaking team when bingles are
needed; at least, the advantage be
tween the two nines is pretty even.
Should the Stanford players also
carry through as good a fighting
game as in last Saturday's contest,
an almost errorless one, it will be
hard for the mission men to get a run
over the last station.
Coach Presley keeps the infield
personnel the same, and every man of
the four deserves his place. M. Mitch
ell has improved his shortstop per
formance by a vast degree. His throw
to the initial sack has not been
equalled on the turf this year, and
the runner who gets ahead of him
must be fast. S. Mitchell has taken
and executed with ease some very
difficult chances. McFadden is as
cool and sure on second as one of
the old guard, while Rail has demon
strated over and over again his adapt
ability to the responsibility of the
initial sack. The outfield men are, as
usual, numerous. Childs, Obear and
Reeger are on the tapis for the open
ing chapter, with McGregor, Cochran,
Cass and Tallant ready to take their
places. To receive Gilfillan the vet
eran Ganong. or Cochran, will do the
part. Ganong will keep to a narrow
limit the achievements of the oppos
ing team in the "stolen base" column.
Whether Alligart or Agneu will
take charge of the mound is unknown.
The Stanford team is to leave on
Ihe 12:40 train, and the game will
begin at 2:30.
Varsity—Catcher, Ganong or Coch
ran; pitcher, Gilfillan; first base,
Rail; second base, McFadden; short
stop, M. Mitchell: third base, S. Mit

chell: outfielders. Childs. Obear, Ree
ger. McGregor, Tallant. Cass, or
Cochran.
Santa Clara—Catcher. Jacobs;
pitcher. Alligart or Agneu; first base,
Thornton; second base, Salsberg;
short-stop, McGovern: third base,
Reams; left field. Zarwick; center
field. Porterfield: right field. Tromu

Three games only are left in which
the Varsity may prepare itself for the
California series. These are: Santa
Clara, tomorrow; Ireland's Indepen
dents Friday, and Santa Clara again
on Tuesday. This leaves the team
four days in which to put on the
finishing touches to their playing
since the first Intercollegiate match
comes the following Saturday, March
2fi. The Santa Clara game will be in
the nature of a good discipline for the
Cardinals, and it is more than lucky
that the two hardest contests of the
year comeat the end of the season.

Three games only are left in which
the Varsity may prepare itself for the
California series. These are: Santa
Clara, tomorrow; Ireland's Indepen
dents Friday, and Santa Clara again
on Tuesday. This leaves the team
four days in which to put on the
finishing touches to their playing
since the first Intercollegiate match
comes the following Saturday, March
2fi. The Santa Clara game will be in
the nature of a good discipline for the
Cardinals, and it is more than lucky
that the two hardest contests of the
year comeat the end of the season.
There will be no baseball on or off
the campus for the Stanford team
either next Saturday or Wednesday.
Tomorrow at Santa Clara the Cardi
nal nine will endeavor to turn its
fighting chance for the Varsity-Santa
Clara championship into a real live
prospect. Having snatched the third
contest of the series from out of the
very hopeful hands of the mission
town men, the fighting chance is still
operating for the fourth game. Win
ning this match, the Varsity will even
up matters all around, and will make
"the final game of the five on the list
decidedly interesting. And this fifth
struggle, should it develope into a
battle for the championship, will fur
nish followers of the Cardinals with
plenty of diversion, since the game
will be brought to Stanford Field, next
Tuesday being set for the date. The
two best exhibitions of baseball that
the Varsity has made this year were
both off the campus, and the Univer
sity in general is far from being
aware of what the team can do under
stress. Gilfillan is slated to give the
Varsity another chance for the cham
pionship tomorrow, by making the
games in the series read two for each
team. He has been resting for the
past ten days, having slightly torn a
muscle in his pitching arm. He is,
however, in fine fettle at present, and
it is within the range of probabilities
that he will be very difficult to find in
the matter of hits tomorrow. More
over, Santa Clara is not a record
breaking team when bingles are
needed; at least, the advantage be
tween the two nines is pretty even.
Should the Stanford players also
carry through as good a fighting
game as in last Saturday's contest,
an almost errorless one, it will be
hard for the mission men to get a run
over the last station.
Coach Presley keeps the infield
personnel the same, and every man of
the four deserves his place. M. Mitch
ell has improved his shortstop per
formance by a vast degree. His throw
to the initial sack has not been
equalled on the turf this year, and
the runner who gets ahead of him
must be fast. S. Mitchell has taken
and executed with ease some very
difficult chances. McFadden is as
cool and sure on second as one of
the old guard, while Rail has demon
strated over and over again his adapt
ability to the responsibility of the
initial sack. The outfield men are, as
usual, numerous. Childs, Obear and
Reeger are on the tapis for the open
ing chapter, with McGregor, Cochran,
Cass and Tallant ready to take their
places. To receive Gilfillan the vet
eran Ganong. or Cochran, will do the
part. Ganong will keep to a narrow
limit the achievements of the oppos
ing team in the "stolen base" column.
Whether Alligart or Agneu will
take charge of the mound is unknown.
The Stanford team is to leave on
Ihe 12:40 train, and the game will
begin at 2:30.
