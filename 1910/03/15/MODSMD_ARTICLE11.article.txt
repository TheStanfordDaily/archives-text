The end is in sight. Soon the moon
light strolls through the arboretum to
Palo Alto will be but dim memoies.
The procuring of a sundae will no
longer necessitate a two-mile tramp
and an hour's conversation, for on
next Thursday Wilson's campus candy
store will be thrown open to the pub
lic, just in time to care for the big
rush which is sure to occur on Junior
Day. Wilson is endeavoring to fit the
new building with all the conveniences
of Ills Palo Alto establishment, but as
some of the interior decorations are
yet to arrive, the store will scarcely
present its best appearance until latter
in the season. The management in
tends to carry a full line of cakes and
pastries, as well as candies and ice
cream. As in Palo Alto, light lunches
will be served.
