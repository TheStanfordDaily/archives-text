Dr. D. Charles Gardner announces
that the short chapel services in the
vestry room each morning at 8 o'clock
have proven so successful and have
been so well attended, that a general
request has gone forth that they he
continued until the Easter vacation at
least. At the service Wednesday
morning, those present will he asked
to decide the matter.
