Topical verses dealing in a humor
ous fashion with local individuals and
conditions have been written by E. J.
Hopkins, '11, for the production of the
comic opera, "lolanthe," which will be
produced by the Junior Class next
Thursday evening. These verses have
been introduced at every possible
point and should add a distinct touch
of local color to the piece.
With the arrival of the scenery,
which reached the campus today, pre
parations are practically complete for
the production. The two new sets,
which were designed by Lyon of San
Francisco, depict the forest of Arca
dia and the exterior of the House of
Parliament.
Realizing that much of the success
of an opera depends on the skill of the
orchestra in interpreting the musical
score and in view of the fact that the
Stanford musicians could not be al
lowed a sufficient length of time in
which to master the difficult music of
the piece, the committee in charge has
arranged for a professional orchestra
from San Francisco. These musicians
have been preparing the score under
the personal supervision of Coach
Perlet and will be under his direction
during the performance. This action
will assure absolute co-ordination and
harmony between the musicians and
the singers, and will add greatly to
the finish of the opera.
