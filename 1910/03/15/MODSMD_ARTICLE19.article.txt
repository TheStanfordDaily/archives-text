# Registrar Makes Few Changes.
## 
### 
The list of fifty-four eligible Fresh
men for the Intercollegiate track meet
next. Saturday passed through the
hands of the Registrar practically
without change. Only a very few
names were taken from the list be
cause of unsatisfactory scholarship,
and the erasures will have little or no
effect upon the chances of Stanford.
