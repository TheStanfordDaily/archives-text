# SENIOR TRIALS FAST
## CLASSES TRAINING FOR IRISH RELAY RACE. 1910 Stands Good Chance of Again Winning .Marathon.â€”Captain Bee-is Optimistic. 
### 
That the Marathon to be held by
the Quadrangle Club on Friday after
noon will be a fast and interesting one
with competition between the indivi
duals and classes is evidenced by the
trials which have been run off so far
in the course of the selection of the
teams. The average times made by
the runners of the four regular classes
are practically on a par and are well
under 60 seconds. This means that
the quarter-mile races will be fast
events in which the outcome of the
race will constantly be in doubt.
The Seniors ran off their trials yes
terday afternoon, and while Captain
Scott and Rellah are not making pub
lic the times it is understood that 1910
will stand a good show to win the cup
offered this year. 1910 will be remem
bered as the winner of the cup last
year. Captain Coleman has been
busily engaged in preparing the Soph
omores for the race. W. S. Porter, '11.
has signed up on his team a fast set
of Juniors. The Freshmen are heavily
handicapped by the nearness of the
1913 Intercollegiate meet, which will
mean the exclusion of the best run
ners from the interclass affair.
Captain Bee is not saying much
about the prospects of the Hold-Overs.
"Cap" does admit that he has signed
up all the men necessary and that
should his men run up to past records
the cup will for his men to admire.
"Cap" has not run any trials as sev
eral of his best men do not believe
that they would be equal to more than
one race this semester.
The preparations for the meet are
complete and with the entering of the
teams tonight the Quadrangle Club as
sures the public that the entertaining
event will be run off promptly at 2
o'clock Friday afternoon. The regular
admission of 25 cents will be charged.
The officials for the meet and the
rules which will govern will be an
nounced tomorrow.
