# QUESTION STILL UNDECIDED.
## Eligibility Rule Remains in Dispute Committee Adjourns to Meet on March 21. 
### 
With the eligibility question still
as much in dispute as before, the In
tercollegiate Agreement Committees
adjourned their meeting last evening
until next Monday night, March 21.
Besides the regular members of the
committee there were present 1). E.
Brown,. '97, and J. F. Lanagan, '00,
representing Stanford, and State Sen
ator Earl and W. Olney, Jr., represent
ing California.
The only new solution of the diffi
culty discussed was a proposal made
by Olney that an althlete's four years
of competition might extend over an
unlimited period, provided his schol
arship was up to a certain standard of
excellence. Nothing definite was
agreed upon, so that the rule remains
as undecided as before.
The next meeting will be held as
usual at the Palace Hotel in San Fran
cisco. At this time it is hoped to settle
the question finally.
