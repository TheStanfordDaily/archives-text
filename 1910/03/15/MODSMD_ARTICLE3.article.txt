# TO CHOOSE CLUB SITE
## UNION MEMBERS WILL HOLD BUSINESS MEETING. Subscribers to Discuss Situation for Erection of Their Home Next Thursday Afternoon. 
### 
Prospective life members, or those
who have signified their intention of
becoming charter members of the
Stanford Union, have been requested
to meet in the University Chapel
Thursday afternoon at 1:15 for the
purpose of discussing matters per
taining to the affairs of that institu
tion. This gathering has been asked
for by ihe Roard of Trustees of the
club in order that a consensus of
opinion upon certain topics that will
be brought up at that time might be
secured from those most directly in
terested in the Union upon the campus.
Most important among these is the
subject of the choice of a suitable site
for the location of the clubhouse
that is to be the home of the Union.
The trustees have made the request
that the actual subscribers who have
signified their intention of becoming
closely identified with this institution,
should give that board some site upon
the campus that would be considered
by the majority of students as the
most suitable for the location of this
building. After the Union Trustees
are aware of this selection, they will
be enabled to ask for land from the
Roard of Trustees of the University
for the Union upon the same basis as
the athletic fields stand. They will
then have the authority to make the
request for some particular section of
University land, knowing that that
selection meets with the approval of
the men who are furnishing funds for
the erection of the building.
The section of land incldued be
tween Encina Gymnasium, the present
electric car tracks and Alvarado, has
been submitted as one site for the
club-house, while land between the
University post-office and the Quad
has been suggested as another spot.
The latter site would be closely ad
jacent to the post-office, as the Union
cannot be placed in any section where
University buildings are planned for
the future.
Every subscriber is urgently re
quested to putin an appearance
Thursday afternoon by the Board of
Trustees, as this first business meet
ing will probably decide the all-im
portant problem.
Student Rody President. J. E. Shel
ton, '10, will preside over the meeting.
