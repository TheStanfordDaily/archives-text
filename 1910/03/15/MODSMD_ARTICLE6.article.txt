# 1913 HAS HARD TASK
## CHANCES FOR VICTORY FAVOR CALIFORNIA FRESHMEN. Stanford Track Team Will Have Plenty of Fight in Intercollegiate Meet. 
### 
The Cardinal Freshmen journey to
the country of the Blue and Gold
next Saturday in an effort to win at
least one first-year track contest.
Chances for victory in this meet, as
usual, favor the California men, es
pecially since the contest will be
upon their home grounds, hut the
same spirit that won the 1913 Rugby
for them should make the wearers of
the Stanford colors aggressive con
tenders for the honors.
In the track events the Stanford
men will be the more strongly repre
sented, although our pole-vaulters
and high-jumpers may turn the tide
of the field contests.
California has several dangerous
men in the sprints particularly Con
nolly and Allen, the former being
credited with 10:2 in the 100, while
Allen, the captain of the Blue and
Gold team, has a reputation from
Berkeley High School as a consistent
sprinter. B. W. Wilcox. R. B. An
drews and L. R. Lambert will be the
Cardinal mainstays in these events.
Considering the recent work of Wil
cox, he should come very close to
winning the 100 while Andrews will
probably have no trouble in annexing
the furlong.
If J. B. Leaman is entered in the
quarter-mile, five points will be added
to the Stanford score without ques
tion, and if this great little runner
is kept for the 880 event, G. K. Snyder
and H.Thoburn will have to be reck
oned with. Both are good for about
53:3 and the runners from across the
bay will have to extend themselves to
gain points in this event.
Smith the Blue and Gold represen
tative in the 880, and Leaman should
make the half the most hotly contest
ed event of the day. Both have good
records and are game to the core.
Giving the California men all credit
for their ability Stanford places all
its confidence in Leaman to bring
home five tallies in any event he
enters.
The mile event will undoubtedly
add another scalp to the belt of the
Stanford team, if L. H. Price can keep
up the pace he set for himself last
Saturday, but it is likely that the Cal
ifornia men will annex the other two
places.
Unfortunately it looks as if nine
points will be lost to Stanford in the
two-mile run, as none of the first-year
men has shown any ability in this
event. California boasts a Varsity
candidate by the name of Sproul, in
the long race and claim that already
he is their best man in the eight-la])
event.
Although conceding the two-mile to
California, chances for a killing in the
two hurdle events look good for the
Cardinal team. E. T. Kern, L. V.
Ruddick, H. G. McGuire and J. H.
Harrigan. composing the 1913 squad
of stick-toppers, appear rather classy.
They should capture the greater part
of the eighteen points.
