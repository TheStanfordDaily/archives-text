The inability of the Intercollegiate
Agreement Committees of the two
universities to reach a decision in re
gard to the formation of a new com
pact still continues. To some, the
many postponements of the final set
tlement may bespeak undue stubborn
ness on the part of the members of
the committees. Stanford, however,
is fortunate to possess a trio of repre
sentatives who will fight unceasingly
for that which they, and we, believe
to be absolutely just and right. The
addition of Mr. Brown and Mr. Lana
gan will strengthen the committee's
power of resistance. Accordingly, we
feel assured that when the agreement
is finally drafted, the eligibility clause,
while being equally fair to either in
stitution, will work no rank injustice
in individual cases by unduly shorten
ing the period by which an athlete's
four years of competition is limited.
