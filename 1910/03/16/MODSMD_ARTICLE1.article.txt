# Opera, Prom, Marathon and Water Carnival Scheduled by Juniors
## DECORATIONS ARRIVE ACCESSORIES FOR JUNIOR PROM RECEIVED FROM EAST. Annual Dance Will Assume Character of Most Elaborate Function Ever Given in Encina Club-Room. 
### 
Wells Fargo delivered the final ship
ment of decoration material from the
East to the Junior Prom Committee
yesterday, and with this on hand, that
board of Juniors will commence actual
work upon preparing Encina club,
room for next Friday night for the
1911 Junor Prom. Decorations this
year will constitute one of the features
of the festivity, not only being of the
highest artistic quality, but also of a
much more extensive nature than any
decorations that have ever been put up
in Encina club-room. All the elements
of the dance are to conform with the
character of the decorations, both in
quality and plan.
Possibly one of the most interesting
and pleasing of the extra features to
be introduced will be an additional
element in the music that is to be
rendered during the evening. Alth jugh
the committee is very reticent upon
the subject, it is surmised that there
will be musical features exclusive of
those which Brohaska's Orchestra
will offer for the program. Despite
the fact that the committee refuses to
divulge the nature of this added at
traction, they maintain that it is an
absolutely new departure as far as
dances in P]ncina Hall are concerned
and that it will not only be appreciat
ed by those who have admittance, but
will be enjoyed by those who are to
occupy seats of advantage in the sec
ond balcony.
On account of the elaborate supper
that is to he served and the time that
the serving of the same will consume,
the Prom this year will start at 7:30
sharp. The Junior committee has
given its assurance that no time will
be spent in waiting and that if there
are only ten collides upon the floor at
that hour the first dance will be called.
Again the committee wishes to make
the request that no flowers be taken
to Encina Hall, both for the reasons
advanced when the Juniors first re
quested that, these accessories be dis
pensed with and because of the con
sideration that should be shown to
ward Encina Club. It has been re
quested by various members of the
club that, no flowers be brought be
cause of the damage that they do to
the floor when dropped upon and
tramped into the hard wood. The
presence of such gifts would, there
fore, not be relished by those who are
considerate enough to give the use of
the hall to the Juniors.
Tickets may still be secured from
H. <!. Ferguson, at the Delta Kappa
Epsilon house, and it is desired by the
chairman of the committee that all
admittances be obtained as early as
possible so as to enable the, committee
to notiry the caterer.
