## LONG AWAITED PROOF PROMISED IN MARCH NUMBER. Magazine Will Appear Tomorrow. Miller Writes "The Case Against The Scaraboea." 
### 
Actual political agitation com
mences tomorrow morning with the
appearance of the March edition of
the "Sequoia," which will be placed on
sale upon the Quad at that time. The
magazine is full of interesting mater
ial and contains, among other things,
the "dope" that has been anticipated
for the past two months. The whole
magazine assumes a political tinge
this month.
The third installment of the accusa
tions against organizations formed for
the purpose of political manipulations,
by R. J. Miller, '11, makes its appear
ance in this edition and gives more
actual proof than any of the previous
articles. Miller's accusation, "The
Case Against the Scaraboea", is a de
tailed and extensive condemnation of
that society for certain political man
ipulations that the writer alleges that
organization has engaged in and has
practiced for some time.
The prosecutor accuses certain
members of the Student Body with
specific acts of an unsavory character
and in his accusations, gives the
names of the alleged offenders with
the time at which they committed
these deeds. The case is an exten
sive one and deals at great length with
the details of the specific charges
made.
G. F. Morgan, '10, has again enliv
ened the magazine with another of his
humorous sketches of Stanford life,
the article submitted this time being
a caricature on the University politi
cian, setting forth his foibles and his
ambitions.
"Hearts and Votes" is the name of
a clever story by L. D. Suminerfield.
'12, which appears as the only fiction
in this number of the magazine.
Editor E. M. Leaf has devoted much
of the space in the volume to his edi
torials. dealing with several import
ant questions before the Student Body.
His most interesting comments are
upon the "Sequoia's" attitude toward
the disclosures that have been made
through the columns of his magazine
concerning the "Scaraboea" and its
various alleged shady machinations.
Leaf gives the position of the maga
zine and shows how the "Sequoia" has
maintained the original purpose of the
accusations that were made early in
the controversy. The editor explains
also that the "Sequoia" at first made
general charges, implicating no in
dividual, and that only after they were
forced did they resort to personal
accusations to maintain their position.
The Stanford Union, the retirement
of Dr. Jordan in the future and the
building of the new tennis courts are
all treated editorially.
