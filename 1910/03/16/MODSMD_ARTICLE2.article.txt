# Fairies and Peers of "Iolanthe" Will Entertain Large Audience by Sumptuous Presentation of Gilbert and Sullivan Opera.
## 
### 
As a special feature of the Junior
Week festivities the class of 1911 has,
at great difficulty and expense, im
ported direct from Fairyland, the
Queen of Fairies and all her attend
ants. Nor were they satisfied with
this spectacular feat. Arrangements
were also made whereby the Lord
Chancellor of England and the repre
sentatives of many of the noblest fam
ilies of that realm should be present.
Opportunity will be afforded to see
these unusual and distinguished visi
tors tomorrow evening when the Juni
or class presents Gilbert and Sulli
van's comic opera, "lolanthe," in As
sembly Hall.
This opera is one of the best of Gil
bert and Sullivan's productions, the
plot being fascinating throughout, the
music uniformly pleasing and catchy,
and the chorus effects brilliant. The
plot concerns itself with the love story
of a young shepherdess, the ward of
the Lord Chancellor, and an Arcadian
shepherd, who is half Fairy and half
human. His mother, the Fairy lolan
the. endeavors to aid him in winning
the girl from the Chancellor and the
Peers who are themselves in love with

her and who tv> to secure her mar
riage to one of their own number.
The possibilities of the piece as re
gards scenic and chorus effects are
almost unlimited and tinder the direc
tion of Messrs. Mathieu and Perlet, no
opportunity has been slighted whereby
the opera might be made more attract
ive. Costuming, scenery and electri
cal effects, all of which so materially
affect the success of a production of
this character, have received tl^r 1
most painstaking and minute attention
from the committeemen in charge.
The brilliant vari-colored fairy cos
tumes. contrasted with the rich garb
of the Peers and Lords, together with
the forest setting, give promise of
some of the most beautiful and strik
ing stage effects ever seen in Assembly
Hall.
The principals in the cast have with
out exception proven their adaptabil
ity for their roles as well as their
ability to render the difficult music of
the piece. Miss H. M. Clift, '11. will
appear as the Queen of Fairies, while
Miss (1. V. Lacey, '11. will sing the role
of Iolanthe. the banished fairy. The
