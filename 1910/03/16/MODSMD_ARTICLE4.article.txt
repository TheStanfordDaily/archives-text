# EVENTS BEGIN TONIGHT
## SINGING ON LAKE INAUGURATES JUNIOR FESTIVITIES. Committee Announces Long List of Sports for Friday.â€”Entries Close Tomorrow. 
### 
That the festivities planned for
Junior Week by the committee in
charge, will he among the hest ever
given at the University, is evidenced
by the plans announced by the com
mittee last evening. Commencing
with the singing and other music at
the lake this evening, and ending with
the Marathon on Friday afternoon,
the program presents the most varied
and widely differing aspects.
The "jinks" will commence with the
musical program at the lake this even
ing. The committee has decided, he
cause of the request of Chairman A.
B. Clark, of the Student Affairs Com
mittee. to start the program almost
immediately after dinner. The idea
that they have is to make the whole
thing as informal and pleasant as
possible. "With this object in view, a
huge bonfire will be kindled as soon
as it grows sufficiently dark, and then
the program proper will commence.
The University Glee Club, led by R.
H. Prown, '10, will be the first number.
This will be followed by selections by
the Mandolin Club under the direction
of A. H. Crary, '11. A couple of num
bers will then be rendered by a quar
tet. from among the members of the
Glee Club, and this will be followed by
what should prove the most attrac
tive number of the evening. A spec
ially fitted barge will be moored near
the shore and on this the quintet from
the Mandolin Club will render ap
propriate music. After this all will
join around the fire in singing popu
lar and college songs, led by the full
Glee Club, and accompanied by the
members of the Mandolin Club.
The Committee has also announced
the program for the water sports on
Junior Day. The first of these events
will be the interclass crew races. Tn
the* past, these have always proved
among the most interesting of the
events, and there is every reason to
suppose that this year's will, if any
thing, be above the average. The per
sonnel of the crews has not been an
nounced as yet but will be given out
tomorrow. One of the many innova
tions that the 1911 Committee have
planned is the four-oared pursuit
race, in which crews from Stanford
and the University of California will
contest. The spirit of University ri
valry in the class exercises will
materially enliven the events of the
morning. Following this will come
the canoe races. All the men who
have spoken of signing up for these
events, have not done so officially, as
yet, so no announcement as to the
number of entries can be made. The
fun-making part of the program, con
sisting of the tilting bouts, will be
enlivened this year by the introduction
of class teams, with either four or six
men to the side. Another innovation
of an entirely new character will be
the "canoe climbing contest," as it has
been officially dubbed. This will con
sist of a contest in which each entry
will, at a given signal, jump from his
canoe and attempt to climb in again
from the water. The man making
the quickest time will be adjudged
the winner. Two strong teams of the
best swimmers in the University, one
representing the upperclassmen and
the other the Sophomores and Fresh
men, will play a water polo game.
The high dive for form will follow this
event, and the final swimming con
test will be the 100-yard free-for-all
race. Another event which will cause
a great deal of merriment is the tight
rope walking contest over the water.
Other distance surprises can be ex
pected.
All those wishing to enter any of
these events, and who have failed to
hand in their names, should do so at
once to any of the following Juniors:
W. S. Porter, W. M. Wyman, F. C.
Brown, J. D. Rutledge, or K. C. Dole.
In the water polo, contestants for
places on the team should hand their
names, if upperclassmen, to Captain
F. H. Hilton, if underclassmen, to
Captain J. W. Howell.

race. Another event which will cause
a great deal of merriment is the tight
rope walking contest over the water.
Other distance surprises can be ex
pected.
All those wishing to enter any of
these events, and who have failed to
hand in their names, should do so at
once to any of the following Juniors:
W. S. Porter, W. M. Wyman, F. C.
Brown, J. D. Rutledge, or K. C. Dole.
In the water polo, contestants for
places on the team should hand their
names, if upperclassmen, to Captain
F. H. Hilton, if underclassmen, to
Captain J. W. Howell.
That the festivities planned for
Junior Week by the committee in
charge, will he among the hest ever
given at the University, is evidenced
by the plans announced by the com
mittee last evening. Commencing
with the singing and other music at
the lake this evening, and ending with
the Marathon on Friday afternoon,
the program presents the most varied
and widely differing aspects.
The "jinks" will commence with the
musical program at the lake this even
ing. The committee has decided, he
cause of the request of Chairman A.
B. Clark, of the Student Affairs Com
mittee. to start the program almost
immediately after dinner. The idea
that they have is to make the whole
thing as informal and pleasant as
possible. "With this object in view, a
huge bonfire will be kindled as soon
as it grows sufficiently dark, and then
the program proper will commence.
The University Glee Club, led by R.
H. Prown, '10, will be the first number.
This will be followed by selections by
the Mandolin Club under the direction
of A. H. Crary, '11. A couple of num
bers will then be rendered by a quar
tet. from among the members of the
Glee Club, and this will be followed by
what should prove the most attrac
tive number of the evening. A spec
ially fitted barge will be moored near
the shore and on this the quintet from
the Mandolin Club will render ap
propriate music. After this all will
join around the fire in singing popu
lar and college songs, led by the full
Glee Club, and accompanied by the
members of the Mandolin Club.
The Committee has also announced
the program for the water sports on
Junior Day. The first of these events
will be the interclass crew races. Tn
the* past, these have always proved
among the most interesting of the
events, and there is every reason to
suppose that this year's will, if any
thing, be above the average. The per
sonnel of the crews has not been an
nounced as yet but will be given out
tomorrow. One of the many innova
tions that the 1911 Committee have
planned is the four-oared pursuit
race, in which crews from Stanford
and the University of California will
contest. The spirit of University ri
valry in the class exercises will
materially enliven the events of the
morning. Following this will come
the canoe races. All the men who
have spoken of signing up for these
events, have not done so officially, as
yet, so no announcement as to the
number of entries can be made. The
fun-making part of the program, con
sisting of the tilting bouts, will be
enlivened this year by the introduction
of class teams, with either four or six
men to the side. Another innovation
of an entirely new character will be
the "canoe climbing contest," as it has
been officially dubbed. This will con
sist of a contest in which each entry
will, at a given signal, jump from his
canoe and attempt to climb in again
from the water. The man making
the quickest time will be adjudged
the winner. Two strong teams of the
best swimmers in the University, one
representing the upperclassmen and
the other the Sophomores and Fresh
men, will play a water polo game.
The high dive for form will follow this
event, and the final swimming con
test will be the 100-yard free-for-all
race. Another event which will cause
a great deal of merriment is the tight
rope walking contest over the water.
Other distance surprises can be ex
pected.
