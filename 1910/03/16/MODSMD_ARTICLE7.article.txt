After struggling.along for a twelve
month as misbehaving Freshmen;
after entertaining the college public
through the medium of a clever farce:
after astounding all sane and con
servative persons with startling ad
vertising, such as never before and
never since has been conceived: after
attracting numberless ardent youth
to a gay and festive cotillion; and
â€¢ifter finally annexing a championship
by capturing the 1910 interclass base
ball series; now comes the Class of
1911 to the joys and jes(3 of Junior

the faculty committee, we offer the
.Tunors the freedom of the farm.
