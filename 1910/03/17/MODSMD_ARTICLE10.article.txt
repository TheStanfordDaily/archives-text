With this issue we drop the name of
Mr. E. M. Leaf, our former managing
editor, from the staff of this paper.
A man who, in his own magazine,
knowingly prints malicious falsehoods
and deliberate misconstructions has
110 place upon the Daily Palo Alto.
Mr. H. G. Ferguson succeeds to the
position of managing editor. We ex
aggerate not at all when we say that
Mr. Ferguson is as faithful and inter
ested a worker as the Daily Palo Alto
has ever had the good fortune to
boast in its ranks. The news editor
ship will henceforth be filled by Mr.
B. F. Bickel.
Under the heading, "The Case
Against the Scaraboea," the March
"Sequoia" prints a motley conglomer
ation of lies, distortions and facts.
Even assuming the absolute truth of
every one of the novel collection of
statements, the Daily Palo Alto is at
a loss to discover adequate proof or
the original charge that the "Bugs"
aimed at and secured political control
of the Student Body. We congratulate
the editor of the magazine and author
of the article on their surprising in
genuity in concocting the unique array
of alleged evidence. We congratulate
them for their amazing boldness in
daring to conclude such an assortment
of talk with the words: "We feel that
the facts are conclusive and that the
chain of evidence is complete."
But when we assume every state
ment true, we give too much justice to
the "Sequoia" article. Many real
facts it does present. On the other
hand, a number of occurrences have
been wilfully misconstrued in an en
deavor to substantiate the original

charges. And, furthermore, we do not
hesitate to brand some of their state
ments as base, unqualified, malicious
lies.
We are now convinced that the ar
ticles in the February and March num
bers were but the feeble, helpless and
impotent attempts of the editor and
author to "finish" that which they
started in a moment of rash temerity
when their foresight reached no fur
ther than the ends of their noses. Leaf
and Miller are clever, but not suffi
ciently so to crawl out of the deep pit
into which they foolishly cast them
selves. A dirtier piece of scandalous
and unavailing muckraking we heart
ily hope we shall never be called upon
to witness.
