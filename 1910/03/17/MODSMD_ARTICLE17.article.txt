# BEGIN WAREFARE ON MERCHANTS
## Inroads of Palo Alto Pirates to be Repelled by Combination of Campus House Managers. 
### 
To protect themselves from the ra
pacious maw of the Palo Alto mer
chants, the various fraternity and
sorority house managers have banded
together into an offensive and defen
sive alliance. As in all weighty and
important matters there arose much
debate before the organization waa
perfected; but on the successful cul
mination of this part of the program,
however, an ultimatum was delivered
the sellers of goods, stating, in no
gentle terms, that the price of beans
and other essentials of life, must be re
duced or the association would deal
directly with San Francisco whole
salers.
In their turn the village store-keep
ers fulminated against those rash per
sons who would dare question the
beneficent rule of the aforesaid store
keepers and made dire threats of ven
geance against the members of the or
ganization. Not to be frightened by
mere words, the handful of campus
patriots fired the first shot in defense
of hearth and table by ordering a car
load of coal directly from San Fran
cisco.
In dividing the valuable commodity
among the houses, accurate weighing
was found to be a necessity; but the
city scales were in possession of the
enemy. After long parleying, it was
decided to charge the patriots twenty
five cents a load for the use of the
scales. The campus warriors, how
ever, are not gloating over any victory
as they claim according to State
statute, the maximum charge forweigh
ing at a city scales is only fifteen cents
a load and consequently they feel
themselves stung.
Notwithstanding the apparent re
pulse, the rebels swear that the tables
will soon be turned and are as lively
as ever. They assert that no quarter
will be given in the sanguinary con
test and the war will be continued
until the Palo Alto mercenaries are
driven back to their lair. Meanwhile,
college proceeds.
