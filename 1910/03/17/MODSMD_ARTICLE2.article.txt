## MORGAN. SHELTON AND BATKIN ON DEBATING TEAM. Representative Speakers Will Contest Against Blue and Gold.â€” Hopkins is Alternate. 
### 
There were one or two distinct sur
prises at the try-out for places on
the Intercollegiate team, but as a
whole things came out as was gener
ally expected. After a most interest
ing and finished try-out, the following
team was chosen: P. J. Batkin, '10,
G. F. Morgan, '10, and J. E. Shelton,
'10. with E. ,T. Hopkins, '11, as alter
nate. The failure of R. J. Miller, '11,
to make the team was rather a sur
prise to those who had picked him to
win a place, but in view of the little
time that he has had in the immediate
past, it was not altogether unexpected.
The debaters were divided up into
two squads; those on the first squad
had never represented the University,
while those on the second had repre
sented the University at some time in
the past.
The first squad was divided as fol
lows: affirmative, M. M. Fogel, '12,
and E. E. Tincher, '12; negative, F. H.
Hilton. '11, and K. E. Leib, '13. In the
second squad were: affirmative, P. J.
Batkin, '10 J. E. Shelton, '10, and R.
J. Miller, '11; while the supporters of
the negatives were, G. F. Morgan, '10,
and E. J. Hopkins, '11.
Each speaker was allowed 'ten min
utes in which to advance his argu
ments, to be divided into lots of seven
and three minutes each. The judges
were Professor R. M. Alden, of the
English department, Professor A. M.
Cathcart, of the department of Law,
and Professor E. B. Krehbiel, of the
History department.
The question under debate was the
same as the Intercollegiate question
submitted by California a short time
ago. It was: Resolved, That in the
United States the suffrage should be
granted to women.
At the close of the debate Profes
sors Alden and Krehbiel discussed the
question in the light of the debate and
presented their views as to the best
way of attacking the question.
The team which will represent Cal
ifornia was chosen recently after a
spirited try-out in which twelve stu
dents contested. The team as finaily
selected consists of N. B. Drury, '12,
J. J. Miller, '13, and F. M. Shipper, '12.
Both Drury and Shipper were mem
bers of the California Carnot team for
1910, in which Drury won the coveted
medal. The debate should be very
close this year, as both of the teams
are exceptionally strong.
