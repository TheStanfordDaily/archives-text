# STAGG INTERPRETS RULES.
## Affording to Chicago Coach Stanford Will Sillier Severely in Coining Conference Meet. 
### 
In preparation for the sending of a
Varsity track team to the Conference
meet at Chicago next June Dr. Angel 1
has been making some inquiries con
cerning the eligibility rules of the
Eastern association. According to a
reply received from Alonzo Stagg, of
the University of Chicago, any man is
debarred from participation in the
meet who has competed for his col
lege for a period of three years. By
Stagg's interpretation an athlete is
considered to have competed for one
year when he has been a member of a
Varsity team during either semester of
the college year.
As the reply does not take cogniz
ance of the fact that the Coast univer
sities allow freshmen to take part in
Varsity athletics, it is not known how
the Stanford Athletes will be affected
by the rule. If the construction, as
given by Stagg. is rigidly observed,
several prominent track men, includ
ing Scott and Horton. will be inelig
ible. It is possible that exceptions
may be made by the Conference Com
mittee in favor of Stanford and Cali
fornia.
