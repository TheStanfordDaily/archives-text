# ALLOW COLEMAN'S TIME
## 1912 SPRINTER GRANTED RECORD IN 220-YARD DASH. Executive Committee Passes Upon Time of 22 Flat.â€”Class Sweaters to be Uniform. 
### 
At the Executive Committee meet
ing held last evening, the points that
stand out from among the minor de
tails were the granting of the Stanford
record in the 220-yard dash to T. L.
Coleman, '12, the time being 22 sec
onds flat; the accepting of the report
of the "stunt" committee for the Var
sity football game; and the prescrib
ing of definite colors and sizes of
the numerals for the interclass
sweaters.
On the morning of February 26.
Coleman, with an extraordinary burst
of speed, covered the furlong in what
was then announced as 22:1. The
facts in the case were that out of six
watches which were set to catch Cole
man's time, five of them registered
22 flat and the sixth one the time men
tioned above. The man holding the
sixth watch was a stranger to the
Stanford track, and had never timed
here before, so that his time was less
to be relied on than that of the other
five. It was decided last evening to
take the time caught by the majority
of the watches and grant to Coleman
a record of 22 flat. The previous
record was held by H. E. Reed, '10,
who was credited on the books with a
mark of 22:2. Coleman's time is with
in four-fifths of asecoiul of the world's
record. Coleman is a member of Delta
Kappa Epsilon fraternity, and regis
ters in the pre-legal course.
In order that there might be abso
lute uniformity in the sweaters
granted for interclass events, the Ex
ecutive Committee has prescribed a
regulation style. In the past, men
wearing inter-class sweaters have
never taken into consideration the
color of the sweater, the color of the
numerals themselves, or their size or
position. Under the new ruling all
interclass sweaters granted for foot
ball, baseball, or track, shall be red
for a background, with white numer
als. The numerals shall be four
inches high. For sweaters won in
interclass tennis matches or in the
nterclass regatta, the colors shall
be white, with red numerals. These,
as before, are to be exactly four
inches high. In this way it is hoped
that all the sweaters worn on the
campus will present a uniform aspect
instead of the patch-work effect that
is the style at the present time.
The long-delayed report of the
"stunt" committee for the big game
was submitted last evening by Chair
man Ehrhorn, and accepted as pre
sented by the committee.
