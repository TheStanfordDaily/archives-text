# Steel Arming Almost Daily.
## 
### 
As fast as steel for the Memorial
Church is ready it is being shipped
from the foundry in San Francisco
directly to the campus. Accordingly,
carloads of steel-work are arriving al
most every day. The contractor in
charge states that only a small
amount of the material has been re
ceived as yet, and consequently no
statement can be made in regard to
the date of the beginning of the re
construction.
