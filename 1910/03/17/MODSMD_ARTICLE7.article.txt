# CARNIVAL AT THE LAKE
## JUNIOR DAY WILL COMMENCE WITH AQUATIC SPORTS. Interclass Crew Contests and Intercollegiate Pursuit Race are Among Morning's Events. 
### 
Tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock
sharp Announcer Pemberton will call
the first event to order which will
open the schedule of the Junior Day
sports. This will be the interclass
crew races in which all the classes
will be represented by four-oared
crews. Following this in rapid suc
cession will be a series of other
aquatic sports. The first of these will
be a burlesque crew race entitled
Vassar vs. Stanford. Following this
will be the much discussed pursuit
race, in which crews representing the
University of California and Stanford
will participate. This will not be a
real pursuit race in the general ac
ceptance of the term, for instead of
rowing until one team overtakes the
other, as is the usual course in a pur
suit race, the teams will row three
times around the lake and the one
crossing its own starting line first will
be declared the winner.
The next event will be the canoe
races with two entries in each canoe.
The entries are: S. H. Sherfy, gr.,
and S. B. Bee, '09: 'A. C. Meston, '10,
and H. V. Poor, '10; F. H. Hilton, '11,
and T. E. Gore, '11; J. H. Wiggins, '10,
and O. E. Utzinger, '10; H. K. Hunts
berger, '12, and W. E. Ferguson, '12;
C. H. Marvin, '13, and S. J. Talbot, '10.
The next event will be the tilting con
test in which, practically the same
crews will contest. After the individ
ual tilting contests will come the class
contests in which each class will
enter four canoes. The entries for
this event are not quite complete.
The canoe climbing contest will
then occupy the attention of the spec
tators. The entries in this event are:
A. S. Meston, '10, A. Hagerman, '13, K.
L. Dole, '11, G. Holcomb, '11, J. L.
Andrews, '11, and F. H. Hilton, '11.
Following this will be one of the best
of the innovations introduced by the
Class of 1911. The water polo game
will be played by a team representing
the upperclassmen, their opponents
being picked from the Sophomores
and Freshmen. The upperclass team
will be : F. H. Hilton, '11, K. L. Dole,
'11, P. W. Dickson. '11, C. E. Wood
cock. '11. and B. W. Lee,' 11. The
underclassmen will be represented by
J. B. Beman, '12, H. L. Dietterle, '12,
A. H. Frank, '13. A. J. Scholl, '13, and
A. Hagerman, '13.
Following this will be the high-dive,
open to all entries in any of the
aquatic events. This event will be
judged on form rather than distance
or any other consideration. The var
ious classes will again be represented
in the 100-yard swim in which class
teams only will be the contestants.
The final event of the morning will be
the tight rope walking contest over
the water.
The committee in charge announces
that the University Band will dispense
sweet music during the entire morn
ing. They also announce that if the
ground is still damp from the recent
rain, they will attempt to have canvas
spread over the various available
slopes to protect the new Junior Day
garb of those present.
The officials will be: starter, G. J.
Presley; timers, Professor G. D. Marx,
Instructor H. W. Maloney, and "Dad"
Moulton; judges, Professor S. S. Sew
ard, M. Y. Malone, '10, L. S. Scott, '10,
and G. A, Ditz, '11. The announcer
will be Bill Pemberton, whose sten
torian voice should be plainly heard
all over the lake. The class teams as
finally chosen are as follows:
1910—bow, C. H. Benson; 2, R. H.
Reynolds; 3, J. C. Huston; stroke, J.
W. Pitting; coxswain, J. W. Roberts.
1911—bow, J. A. Killian; 2, K. L.
Dole; 3, N. M. Day; stroke, K. L.
Chamberlain;coxswain, F. L. Guerena.
1912 —bow, R. H. Seward; 2, C. L.
Schaupp; 3. H. L. Dietterle; stroke,
J. F. Partridge; coxswain, J. W.
Howell.
1913 —bow, R. W. Olmsted; No. 2, R.
F. Duryea; No. 3, C. H. Beal; stroke,
L. Hofer; coxswain, S. W. Guthrie.
The position of coxswain on the
Freshman crew was filled by tossing a
coin to decide who should have the
place. S. W. Guthrie and S. P. Wing,
the two contestants, were both qual
ified to fill the seat and this method
was the only one in which a fair choice
could be made.
The pursuit race crew will be:
Lagnnita—bow, J. F. Partridge, '12;
No. 2, H. L. Dietterle, '12; No. 3, J. C.
Huston, '10; stroke, J. W. Fitting, '10;
coxswain, F. L. Guerena, '11. Cali
fornia—not announced.
Contrary to expectations the Cali
fornia crew will not arrive until to
morrow morning. They will land at
Cooley's Landing from their special
launch about 9 o'clock, and will be
brought to the campus in automobiles.
Junior Day Game Against Ireland's.
As a further Junior Day diversion
the Cardinal Varsity will tomorrow
meet the famous Ireland's Indepen
dents team on the turf at 3 o'clock.
The visitors are to be there in all their
regalia, and actual playing and side
line remarks should keep the crowd in
humor. Reed is to occupy the Varsity
mound, with Ganong or Cochran be
hind the bat. The rest of the team's
make-up is unchanged, the infield be
ing the same, as well the six or seven
men slated for the outfield. Admis
sion, 25 cents.
l'rom Closes Festivities.
Tomorrow night sees the most im
portant gathering of Stanford society
at the greatest social event of the year,
the Junior Promenade, on the Encina
Hall floor. Rrohaska's orchestra will
start the first of the fourteen memor
able dances at 7 :30, when the one hun
dred and twenty-five couples, led by
Chairman Ferguson, of the Prom Com
mittee will enter into the spirit of the
evening. This year's event, the cul
minating feature of the long-looked-for
Junior Week, will be as attractive and
as novel in its new details as any that
have gone before.
