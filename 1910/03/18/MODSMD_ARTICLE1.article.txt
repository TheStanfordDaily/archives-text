### 
Canoes, racing shells and swimmers
mingled in the 1911 Junior Day sports
on Lake Lagunita this morning. Rain
was threatening, but it did not serve
to dampen the enthusiasm of the half
thousand people assembled on the
shore to the left of the boathouse.
The Stanford band .was in commis
sion in the center of the crowd, and
kept the race finishes lively.
The interclass regatta was captured
by the Sophomores in record-breaking
time. With a stroke never lower than
35 the second-year racers came out
winners in the time of 4:31:3, a
record 23 2-5 seconds ahead of the
1910 Junior crew's championship last
year. This fomrer mark, however,
was beaten by every four in the race
today. The Seniors were second, Jun
iors third, and Freshmen fourth. The
crews and times were: 1912 —Bow,
R. H. Seward; No. 2. C. L. Schaupp;
No. 3, H. L. Dietterle: stroke, J. F.

water in the doubles canoe race was
negotiated by H. V. Poor, '10 and A.
F. Meston, '10, in the easily winning
time of 52:3. T. Gore, '11, and F. H.
Hilton, '11. crossed the line second.
After meeting all comers in the
tilting contest, three pairs being elim
inated in the preliminaries, Poor and
Meston went overboard, vanquished
by F. H. Hilton and T. Gore, who were
easy victors.
The burlesque features of the pro
gram was furnished by the "Oxford"
and "Vassar" crews of four. As in
the previous races a new record was
set. The long, gruelling course across
the Lake was passed over in the an
nounced record time of 15 minutes,
the "Vassar girls" winning by inches
only. The two "Varsities" were:
Vassar —Bow. Guerena: No. 2. New

coxwain, "Jay" Huston. Oxford—
Bow, Walker; No. 2. Mathias; No.
Nunan; stroke, Mitchell: coxswain.

The half dozen or so contestants in
the high diving exhibition displayed
very good form, and the judges had
difficulty' in deciding who deserved
the palm. .1. B. Beman, '12. finally
came out in the lead, with K. L. Dole.
'11, second; and R. E. McNeely, '13.
third.
The water polo match of ten min
utes length was a close one, and went
down in history as a 1-1 tic. Captain
Beman's men were: J. W. Howell,
'12; A. Hagerman, "13, A. ,T. Scholl, '13.
