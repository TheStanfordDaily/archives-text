## SCORE, CHORUS AND MOUNTING BRING SUCCESS. Experienced Critic Comments in Retail Upon Junior Class' Production of "Iolanthe." 
### 
That the production of the Junior
opera, "lolanthe", in Assembly Hall
last night was a success was due to
the charming score, the excellent
chorus and the adequacy of the pre
sentation as a whole. The Fairies
were very good to look upon and
sang well, while the Freshmen and
others disguised as Peers were ex
cruciatingly funny enough to make
the audience overlook the fact that
they did not rise always to the mus
ical demands of the situation.
Some of the principals were very
good, but in the aggregate with th?
sort of support they received from
both orchestra and chorus they would
hardly have carried the opera to any
great degree of success. The great
est fault among ihe men was their
failure to get their songs over the
footlights, which was particularly un
fortunate in the case of the topical
verses. The audience really wanted to
hear these and vociferously applauded
the word or two that managed to wan
der its way. This enthusiasm over
any sign of local flavor argues well
for the success of producing an orig
inal opera: but of this we hope to
hear more later on.
To return to the principals—P. P.
Ward as the Lord Chancellor made a
great hit on his appearance, his first
song being an unqualified success,
and though he did not quite live up
to his beginning, his characterization
was humorous throughout and de
served the applause it received. Miss
R. E. Robertson made a vivacious,
graceful and very pretty Phyllis. Her
acting was more consistently accept
able than her singing, which though
exquisite at times did not maintain
the same quality throughout the even
ing.
The fairy queen was most imposing.
Miss H. M. Clift was excellently fitted
for the part and her clear, true so
prano made her songs a delight. Miss
G. V. Lacey looked beautiful as
"lolanthe" and sang sweetly, but her
acting of the part was entirely color
less. Miss G. M. Mattingly's ethereal
appearance and evident delight in the
part made an attractive combination.
Miss Mattingly managed to put a great
deal of fancy spirit into the small
role of Lelia. Miss S. 11. Starr and
Miss R. Haslett as Celia and Fleta,
the other fairy attendants of the
queen, both added beauty to the pic
ture.
If the Strephin of E. E. Chase had
been a fairy from the waist down his
dance in the last acl might have been
less ludricrous, but the gallery would
have been deprived of one of the
greatest pleasures of the evening. We
cannot help hoping that Strephin is
more at. home among his flocks than
he was on ihe stage. but it is hardly
fair to judge one who was laboring
under such a frightful disadvantage—
to be only half fairy must be worse
than to be a whole bug at the present
moment. H. E. Reed gave a consist

ent portrayel of the Earl Tolloler, his
accent being particularly good. The
small amount of singing he did made
one sorry there was not more of it.
The Earl Mount Arrarat of C. E.
Sampson was not so successful. Mr.
Sampson had made little attempt at
characterizing his part and his evi
dently fine voice failed to carry be
yond the footlights, through a lack of
training undoubtedly. K. Chamber
lain as Private Willis made a great
deal out of a very small part, his facial
expression being particularly good.
Another hit was made by F. L. Guer
ena as the Page in bis all-too-brief
appearance.
The orchestra gave an entirely sat
isftctory rendering of the score, and
its share in the success of the opera
can hardly be over estimated.
The committee deserves a great
deal of praise for the way in which
the opera was put on; the costumes
and scenery were both unusually ef
fective, the whole scheme of the form
er being most attractive. Mr. Perlet
is to be congratulated for the smooth
ness of the production musically and
Mr. Mathieu's excellent stage manage
ment was shown especially in the
ensemble scenes, which were beau
tiful and most professional in effect.

training undoubtedly. K. Chamber
lain as Private Willis made a great
deal out of a very small part, his facial
expression being particularly good.
Another hit was made by F. L. Guer
ena as the Page in bis all-too-brief
appearance.
The orchestra gave an entirely sat
isftctory rendering of the score, and
its share in the success of the opera
can hardly be over estimated.
The committee deserves a great
deal of praise for the way in which
the opera was put on; the costumes
and scenery were both unusually ef
fective, the whole scheme of the form
er being most attractive. Mr. Perlet
is to be congratulated for the smooth
ness of the production musically and
Mr. Mathieu's excellent stage manage
ment was shown especially in the
ensemble scenes, which were beau
tiful and most professional in effect.
That the production of the Junior
opera, "lolanthe", in Assembly Hall
last night was a success was due to
the charming score, the excellent
chorus and the adequacy of the pre
sentation as a whole. The Fairies
were very good to look upon and
sang well, while the Freshmen and
others disguised as Peers were ex
cruciatingly funny enough to make
the audience overlook the fact that
they did not rise always to the mus
ical demands of the situation.
Some of the principals were very
good, but in the aggregate with th?
sort of support they received from
both orchestra and chorus they would
hardly have carried the opera to any
great degree of success. The great
est fault among ihe men was their
failure to get their songs over the
footlights, which was particularly un
fortunate in the case of the topical
verses. The audience really wanted to
hear these and vociferously applauded
the word or two that managed to wan
der its way. This enthusiasm over
any sign of local flavor argues well
for the success of producing an orig
inal opera: but of this we hope to
hear more later on.
To return to the principals—P. P.
Ward as the Lord Chancellor made a
great hit on his appearance, his first
song being an unqualified success,
and though he did not quite live up
to his beginning, his characterization
was humorous throughout and de
served the applause it received. Miss
R. E. Robertson made a vivacious,
graceful and very pretty Phyllis. Her
acting was more consistently accept
able than her singing, which though
exquisite at times did not maintain
the same quality throughout the even
ing.
The fairy queen was most imposing.
Miss H. M. Clift was excellently fitted
for the part and her clear, true so
prano made her songs a delight. Miss
G. V. Lacey looked beautiful as
"lolanthe" and sang sweetly, but her
acting of the part was entirely color
less. Miss G. M. Mattingly's ethereal
appearance and evident delight in the
part made an attractive combination.
Miss Mattingly managed to put a great
deal of fancy spirit into the small
role of Lelia. Miss S. 11. Starr and
Miss R. Haslett as Celia and Fleta,
the other fairy attendants of the
queen, both added beauty to the pic
ture.
If the Strephin of E. E. Chase had
been a fairy from the waist down his
dance in the last acl might have been
less ludricrous, but the gallery would
have been deprived of one of the
greatest pleasures of the evening. We
cannot help hoping that Strephin is
more at. home among his flocks than
he was on ihe stage. but it is hardly
fair to judge one who was laboring
under such a frightful disadvantage—
to be only half fairy must be worse
than to be a whole bug at the present
moment. H. E. Reed gave a consist

ent portrayel of the Earl Tolloler, his
accent being particularly good. The
small amount of singing he did made
one sorry there was not more of it.
The Earl Mount Arrarat of C. E.
Sampson was not so successful. Mr.
Sampson had made little attempt at
characterizing his part and his evi
dently fine voice failed to carry be
yond the footlights, through a lack of
training undoubtedly. K. Chamber
lain as Private Willis made a great
deal out of a very small part, his facial
