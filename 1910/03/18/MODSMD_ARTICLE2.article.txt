# CELEBRATE BY VICTORY
## JUNIORS CAPTURE MARATHON. SOPHOMORES SECOND. Relay Race is Close and Exciting. Stolz Covers Quarter in 51:1, Fastest Time of Contest. 
### 
The great Marathon race is over
and Doraiulo Wyman, by crossing the
tape in front of Cartel-, the Sopho
more's representative, won the classic
event for the Junior Class. Shortly
after two o'clock the Junior team made
its appearance on the track, garbed in
track suits and hooligan hats. Soon
thereafter the audience was treated
to the sight of the Mold-Overs decked
out in dress clothes, and led by Cap.
Bee and Harry Horton. A preparatory
circuit of the oval was safely made by
the has-beens.
The runners were lined at the mark
ready for the starting signal, which
sounded at 2:30. For the first fifteen
laps the Hold-Overs maintained a good
lead, due partly to cuttng acrosSi
corners and partly to the fact that
each runner traversed only 220 yards.
The real contest of the day lay bo
twee the Junior and Sophomore
teams. After alternating in their
positons all during the race, by the
twentieth lap the 1911 team had
gained a good lead of thirty yard?
over the Sophomores. But in the next
three laps the running of Coleman.
K. L. Lee, and Millsap reduced this
lead to a bare two or three yards. In
the last lap R. B. Carter. '12, and W.
M. Wyman, '11, were pitted against
each other, and a magnificent race re
sulted: Wyman just nosing out Carter
at the finish.
The winning team averaged well
under 56 seconds for the quarter and
the Seniors and Sophomores came
around that mark. The Freshmen
were handicapped by the fact that
none of their track men were allowed
to compete, and as a result their team
finished last.
The best time of the day was made
by H. R. Stolz, '10, who succeeded in
covering the last Senior lap in 51:1.
Ths will give Stolz the gold medal of
fered by the Quadrangle Club to the
Varsity man making the best time.
Through an error, the announcer
stated that T. L. Coleman equalled
this performance, but it was found
later that Colemen's time was one
fifth of a second slower.
The medals for the novices go
provisionally to K. L. Lee. '12. and.1.
E. Thompson, '11. The gold medal
will become the property of Lee, if
his time of 53 is accepted. Thompson
covered the distance in 53:1 and will
be awarded the silver trophy.
