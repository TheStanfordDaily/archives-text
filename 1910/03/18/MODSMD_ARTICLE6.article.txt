# FRESHMEN ARE READY
## INTERCOLLEGIATE MEET WILL BE DECIDED TOMORROW. California Oval Will be Scene of Track and Field Contests.—Entries and Officials. 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon on the campus
across the bay, the first-year men of
Stanford will endeavor to snatch the
laurels of victory from the grasp of
the California youngsters. This will
he the fifth annual Freshman meet
and undoubtedly will be the closest
contest of all those in which the first
year teams of the universities have
contended.
The Blue and Gold entries as usual
outnumber the wearers of the Cardi
nal, but as "Dad" Moulton expresses
it, "If it comes to fighting for the vic
tory, we have them. The 1913 men
are the gamest bunch I've trained."
The team will have a difficult task, but
their spirit gives them a fair chance or
winning.
Although many of the California
entries in the dashes are credited
with good time, several having 10:2
chalked up against them in the cen
tury, it is rather difficult to believe
that in such a short period of train
ing Christie could have developed this
speed in new men. However, if any
of the Blue and Cold entries are cap
able of doing that time the points in
the short dash will go across the bay.
Leaman in the quarter-mile will
capture that event without question
and by running him in the relay, Cap
tain Scott has greatly increased the
Cardinal chances in the five-man
event. The prettiest contest of toe
day will be the half-mile run, the five
points going to California or Stanford
according to whether Smith or Fergu
son has the better finish.
L. H. Price will make a good show
ing in the mile, but the much-touted
Sproule of California will have little
difficulty, in annexing the longer race,
if his record of 10:15 is any criterion.
The hurdles will give Eugene Kern
an excellent opportunity to score more
points than any other man in the
meet, as in both events he will easily
distance his nearest competitors, Red
mond and Whitney. As Kern, Mc-
Guire and Ruddick can all do 17 or
better, in the high hurdles, and the
best time the Blue and Gold men can
make is a shade slower than this,
nine points will probably be added to
the Cardinal score after this race is
concluded.
The high jump is the only field
event in which victory is absolutely
assured: and Horine and Argabrite
should have no excuse for not
capturing the first two places,
if class counts for anythng, although
Hill of California will give them a
rub. In the other field events, it is a
toss-up as to which team will gather
the most points.
On account of the inexperience of
many of the men entered, a few
changes in the rules governing the
meet were made by Captains Johns
of California and Scott of Stanford.
No one will be set back in cither of
the hurdles for false starting, but
two false breaks will disqualify. In
all other events a penalty of one yard
will be inflicted for each false start
and the entry will be disqualified on
the third. In the sprints, if the gun is
fired once there will he no recall.
The team will go to San Francisco
on the 9:10 train tomorrow morning
and, after having lunch in the city,
will immediately cross the bay. Ac
cording lo schedule, the track events
will start at 2:15 sharp on California
field; the hammer-throw, one-quarter
of iin hour earlier on the old baseball
diamond. The admission to the games
will lie 50 cents.
