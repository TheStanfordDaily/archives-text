# LAGUNITA WINS RACE
## BEATS RIVALS FROM CALIFORNIA BY 45 SECONDS. Time Contest Rowed on Hough Lake. Accident Prevents Holding of Pursuit Event. 
### 
Rowing in a strong wind, the La
gunita four beat, the California crew
in a race against time late yesterday
afternoon by 45 seconds. The course
was a short one, the crews rowing
around the lake but once. In spite of
the rough water the local men covered
the distance in the fast time of 4
minutes flat, while California made
the round n 4:45. This event con
cluded the athletic program arranged
for Junior Day.
The contest started as a pursuit race
at 5:10 o'clock, but an accident to the
barge necessitated the change to a
race against time. California started
in the shell, while Lagunita used the
barge. Both crews were well under
way, when suddenly the post of the
barge rudder broke, rendering the
craft unmanageable. The crews were
recalled, and the time race substitut
ed, the shell being used by both crews.
California was the first to start, and
rowed a good race considering the
adverse conditions under which they
competed. The personnel of their
four was changed at the last minute,
owing to the fact that Davidson, their
best man, was obliged to take an early
train back to the city. This circum
stance, added to the California men's
unfamiliarity with the course makes
it impossible to draw a comparison
between the two crews. That the race
would have been closer under more
ideal conditions is the opinion of the
local men.
The Lagunita men followed their
rivals, and maintained a fast pace
around the lake, rowing in excellent
form. Fitting started out with a
speedy stroke and kept it up through
out the race.
The inability of the California men
to disembark from their launch at
Cooley's Landing before noon made
the 1 hange in the time of the event
necessary. The crew arrived on the
campus in the early afternoon, after
being met at the dock with an auto
mobile.
This race was the first in which a
crew representing another organiza
tion has competed on Lake Lagunita.
The event will probably be included
as a feature of Junior Day sports
hereafter.
The crews were composed as fol
lows: California—bow. McSpadden:
No. 2, Colt; No. 3, Ball: stroke, Blake,
coxswain, Kelley.
Lagunita—bow, H. L. Dietterle, '12;
No. 2, J. F. Partridge, '12: No. 3, J.
C. Huston. '10: stroke, J. W. Fitting,
'10; coxswain, J. W. Howell, '12.
