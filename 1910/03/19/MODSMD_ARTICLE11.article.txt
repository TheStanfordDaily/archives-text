# HOTCHKISS TO SPEAK
## PROMINENT MISSIONARY WILL TELL OF AFRICA. Layman's Movement Will Also be Conversed Upon by Noted Social Worker. 
### 
Probably one of the most interest
ing sermons ever delivered in the
University Chapel will be given to
morrow by Willis R. Hotchkiss, a
prominent leader of the Layman's
Missionary movement, and one who
has spent a great deal of his life in
the cause of the African native. The
hour of Mr. Hotchkiss' sermon will be
as usual, cermonies beginning at 11
o'clock. The topic upon which he will
speak will include the propaganda
now on foot called the Layman's Mis
sionary Movement, and also some of
the interesting history of Mr. Hotch
kiss' activity in the dark continent.
The later phase mentioned of his sub
ject should be of exceptional concern,
as it covers a great deal of the terri
tory visited by ex-President Roosevelt
during his recent hunting trip.
Colonel Roosevelt day before yester
day in a speech at Khartoum, referred
to the work of the missionaries in that
vicinity in a commendable manner,
the result being that the members of
the Layman's Missionary convention
which is at the present time convening
in San Francisco, sent a message of
appreciation to him.
The Layman's Missionary movement
is gigantic in scope. It has like all
other great factors that are becoming
so prominent in this age, a strong
oragnization, and the well known ben
efit derived from such systems are be
ing absolutely bestowed upon only
such things that are believed by these
benevolent men, in its service, will
tend to uplift mankind. One of the
most remarkable phases of this move
ment is that it is not only phenominal
in strength in one secluded corner of
the world, but that it is evolving into
enormous power everywhere through
out the world, in both progressive and
apthetic nations. The result is that
it is a common conjecture that the
world is upon the eve of a new relig
ious upheaval.
