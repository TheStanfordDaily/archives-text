# EXHIBIT NEXT WEEK
## BLASHFIELD'S WORK ON EXHIBIT IN OLD STUDIO. Work of Pennell, the Famous American Etcher Will Also Be Shown. 
### 
The collection of original drawings
and studies by M. Blashfleld, which
Ihe Stanford Art Club will exhibit to
the public for the week beginning
March 21, at the Old Studo, is of
unusual interest, showing as it does,
the method and manner of this emi
nent artist.
The walls and ceilings of public
buildings in many of the large cities
of this country are adorned with his
work, his fame resting chiefly on his
rural paintings.
The decoration of the dome of
Congressional Library at Washing
ton representing "The Progress of
Civilization"is possibly bis best known
work and is one in which all Ameri
cans justly take great pride.
The collection which will be ex
hibited at the Old Studo includes large
photographs of the completed works
with the extensive group of large orig
inal drawings or studies of figures
and heads, which the painter made.
Among the most important decora
tions represented are those for the
Great Hall of the College of the City
of New York, the Senate chamber of
the State Capitol of Minnesota, court
house of the city of Baltimore, the
Appelate court of New York City, the
ceiling in the ball room in the Hotel
Waldorf Astoria.
In the same exhibition will be
shown a fine collection of etchings and
drawings by Joseph Pennell, the fore
most American etcher, who has been
the first to realize the artistic pos
sibilities of the sky-scapers of New
York and our great cities.
The exihbit will be run from the
21st to the 28th of March. An admis
sion of 25 cents will be charged.
