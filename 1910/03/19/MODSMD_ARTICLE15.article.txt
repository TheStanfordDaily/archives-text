inning of what had appeared a hope
less game from the beginning of the
second inning. Stanford yesterday de
feated Ireland's Independents of San
Francisco hv a score of 8-7. In the
second inning, the visitors in getting
two hits, and in walking two men
managed to bring four tallies across
the plate, thereby obtaining a lead of
three over the Cardinal which they
kept until the last inning. In the
Cardinal's half of the ninth the score
was 7-5 against them. The first three
men up got on bases, two by hits and
one by being hit by a pitched ball.
Reed got a walk which scored M.
Mitchell. Obear came to the plate
next with the bases full, and caught a
fat one square on the nose for a long
drive over the head of Captain Ireland
in the right garden, and Cochran and
Cass romped over the plate with time
to spare.
The game as a whole was marked by
good playing by both teams, hits off
both pitchers being frequent, but with
less errors than usual.
