# PROM IS MERRY DANCE
## BEAUTIFUL DECORATIONS ARE PRINCIPAL FEATURE. Almost 250 People Enjoy Animal Junior Function in Encina Hall Friday Evening. 
### 
Approximately six score couples
glided smoollily over Encina's pol
ished floors to the gentle strains of
Brohaska's orchestra at the Junior
Promenade last night. Everyone was
there, or on the second floor, and those
gentlemen occupying the latter posi
tion were wont to wistfully gaze with
longing eyes upon the happiness of
their more fortunate fellow-students.
The decorations were such as had
never before been seen at a class func
tion. On his entrance to the hall,
one imagined himself in the midst of
some liugh conservatory rather than
in the usually bare corridors of En
cina. The decorative scheme could
not fail to please even the most fas
tidious. and, as a matter of fact, the
tall men's club alone felt justified in
remonstrating. It seems that, the
Class President in presiding over and
supervising the mode and method of
arraying the Club-room had directed
that the foliage should be draped on
a wire netting suspended about pre
cisely three feet above him. And not
to speak ill of the stature of the Class
President, many gentlemen of six feet,
and especially those with pomjadours,
became ungracefully entangled in the
springlike skein.
A sumptuous supper was served
with ease and celerity, not a moment
being unnecessarily lost. The entire
affair was voted a tremendous suc
cess by the gallery, as well as by the
participants, because the committee
was thoughtful enough to have many
suppers left in the larder after all had
been served.
The Junior Prom was an exceeding
ly pleasant dance, planned with taste
and managed with skill.
