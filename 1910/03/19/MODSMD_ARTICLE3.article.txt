# WILL PREPARE REPRINT.
## English Club Undertaking to Publish New Edition of "First Year at Stanford. 
### 
The English Club is at present en
gaged in work preparatory to the re
printing of the volume called the
"First Year at Stanford," which they
hope to issue next month. The book
was originally published ni 1904. Tt
was speedily sold out, and there has
been a steady and urgent demand for
a reprint ever since. The new book
will be an exact reproduction of the
first, issue, with the exception of some
new and interesting matter which will
be contributed by persons competent
to throw light on the picturesque
phases of the early days. The illus
trations of the book are rare old
photographs of the pioneer times.
The English Club is anticipating a
large sale for the reprint when it goes
on the market. A committee consist
ing of Miss M. L. Horton, '11, Miss F.
Williams, '11, F. E. Hill, '1.1, and B. O.
Bliven, '11, chairman, has been ap
pointedl to take charge of the new
edition.
