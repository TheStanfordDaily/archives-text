# DETAILS OF 1913 MEET
## CALIFORNIA HAS FAR SUPERIOR FRESHMAN TEAM. Kern is Highest Individual Point-winner for Cardinal.—Weather Works Hardships. 
### 
"The fellows put up a hard tight.
Wo scarcely expected a victory hut
knew the men would tight hard. There
are some tine trackmen in the Fresh
man Class, although we did not hare
enough second and third-place win
ners to rapture the meet."
Captain Scott.
Owing to an error in the telephonic
report of the Freshman meet last Sat
urday the score of the Stanford team
was announced as 44y 2 , when in fact'
the Cardinal's total was but 41%. The
discouraging smallness of Stanford's
score was due, in large part, to the
strange track made all the more
strange by the disheartening weather
conditions, and by the force of sheer
numbers. California had by far the
better team, and her men made the
most of every opportunity. To the
Cardinal supporters, on the other
hand, many disappointments came.
California captured the meet with a
well-balanced team, composed of few
stars but having many men capable of
annexing the second and third places.
The Cardinal contenders gamely
struggled throughout the contest, but
they were not only fightng a super
ior team but also contending against
adverse weather conditions. The
track events decided the day, as the
teams broke even in the field.
Almost continuous rain marred the
meet, the half-mile distance being
run in a blinding storm which pre
vented the spectators on the Stanford
bleachers from viewing the opposite
side of the field. The weather, and
the execrable condition of the track,
played havoc with the Cardinal
chances in many events.
In the quarter-mile dash .T. R. Lea
man, who was counted on to bring
down five points for the Stanford team,
was so hindered by the slippery track
and sharp turns that, after leading the
field for over three hundred yards,
be weakened at the finish and failed to
place. Thoburn was the sole Stanford
man to count, and crossed the line
with a rush closely following the two
Berkeley runners.
The surprise of the day was the de
feat of Kern, in the low hurdles by the
comparatively unknown Redmond and
Havens. After handily winning tho
120-yard event the Stanford captain
was confidently expected to duplicate
this performance in the longer race,
but the strain told on the big hurdler
and he only succeeded in tying for
third position.
The victories of L. H. Price n the
mile and N. R. Ferguson in the half
were especially commendable. Price
duplicated his performance of a week
ago by finishing the mile in 4:4S which
considering the disadvantages of the
day was equal to 4:40. or better, on a
dry track. Perhaps the best, time of
the meet was made by Ferguson in the
half-mile run. In the fiercest, down
pour of a stormy day this classy run
ner finished the distance some twenty
yards in front of Foulke of California
who captured second place.
The tale of the sprints and the two
mile run is short and sorrowful. One
point out of the three events is the
most that. Stanford could secure.
Fighting hard all the way, Wilcox and
Andrews were no match for the Ber
keley men in the sprints, while the
two-mile run was a walk-over for
Sproule, the lanky Californian, whose
powers of endurance seem unlimited.
Not a Stanford man was able to com
plete the distance, although Price, the
winner of the mile, would probably
have done so had not "Dad" Moulton
taken him out in the middle of the
race.
Wind and rain made the work of the
pole-vaulters both difficult and danger
ous, the slippery poles more than
once causing the men to fail in their
attempts to clear the bar. R .P.
Stevens easily defeated the California
van Iters and showed himself to be a
possible successor to Scott, and Bellah.
E. V r . Ruddick, although unable to do
anything over the hurdles, lived up to
his preparatory school records by
carrying off first honors in the shot.
In the high jump Horine and Argabrite
performed consistently, doing just
what was expected of them. Argabrite
undoubtedly would have taken second
place if he had been in the best of
condition.

"The fellows put up a hard tight.
Wo scarcely expected a victory hut
knew the men would tight hard. There
are some tine trackmen in the Fresh
man Class, although we did not hare
enough second and third-place win
ners to rapture the meet."
Captain Scott.
Owing to an error in the telephonic
report of the Freshman meet last Sat
urday the score of the Stanford team
was announced as 44y 2 , when in fact'
the Cardinal's total was but 41%. The
discouraging smallness of Stanford's
score was due, in large part, to the
strange track made all the more
strange by the disheartening weather
conditions, and by the force of sheer
numbers. California had by far the
better team, and her men made the
most of every opportunity. To the
Cardinal supporters, on the other
hand, many disappointments came.
California captured the meet with a
well-balanced team, composed of few
stars but having many men capable of
annexing the second and third places.
The Cardinal contenders gamely
struggled throughout the contest, but
they were not only fightng a super
ior team but also contending against
adverse weather conditions. The
track events decided the day, as the
teams broke even in the field.
Almost continuous rain marred the
meet, the half-mile distance being
run in a blinding storm which pre
vented the spectators on the Stanford
bleachers from viewing the opposite
side of the field. The weather, and
the execrable condition of the track,
played havoc with the Cardinal
chances in many events.
In the quarter-mile dash .T. R. Lea
man, who was counted on to bring
down five points for the Stanford team,
was so hindered by the slippery track
and sharp turns that, after leading the
field for over three hundred yards,
be weakened at the finish and failed to
place. Thoburn was the sole Stanford
man to count, and crossed the line
with a rush closely following the two
Berkeley runners.
The surprise of the day was the de
feat of Kern, in the low hurdles by the
comparatively unknown Redmond and
Havens. After handily winning tho
120-yard event the Stanford captain
was confidently expected to duplicate
this performance in the longer race,
but the strain told on the big hurdler
and he only succeeded in tying for
third position.
The victories of L. H. Price n the
mile and N. R. Ferguson in the half
were especially commendable. Price
duplicated his performance of a week
ago by finishing the mile in 4:4S which
considering the disadvantages of the
day was equal to 4:40. or better, on a
dry track. Perhaps the best, time of
the meet was made by Ferguson in the
half-mile run. In the fiercest, down
pour of a stormy day this classy run
ner finished the distance some twenty
yards in front of Foulke of California
who captured second place.
The tale of the sprints and the two
mile run is short and sorrowful. One
point out of the three events is the
most that. Stanford could secure.
Fighting hard all the way, Wilcox and
Andrews were no match for the Ber
keley men in the sprints, while the
two-mile run was a walk-over for
Sproule, the lanky Californian, whose
powers of endurance seem unlimited.
Not a Stanford man was able to com
