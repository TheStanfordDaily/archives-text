# Pennsylvania Glider Flies.
## 
### 
A flight, of 150 yards, rising 15 feet
in the air, was the result of the first
flight in a glider by a member of the
Aero Club of the University of Penn
sylvania.
Work is being rushed on the
"Pennsylvania I" even so far as to
run night shifts as well as day shifts,
in order to have the aeroplane ready
to exhibit at the first Intercollegiate
Aviation Convention.
