With but one dance remaining on
the program the Junior Prom was
abruptly concluded on the minute of
twelve last Friday night by the switch
ing off of the lights in the Club-room.
The necessary ten minutes could not
possibly be granted the committee in

The orders were imperative, and the
representative of the Business Office
could not choose but obey. The inci
dent was merely one of many ex
amples of the inconceivable pettiness
which at times possesses the admin
istrative powers of our fair institution.
