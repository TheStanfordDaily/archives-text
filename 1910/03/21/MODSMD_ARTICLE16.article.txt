# JUNIORS ADVISE SOPHOMORES.
## As Suggested by Daily Palo Alto, 1911 Opera Committee Recommends Earlier Apopintment. 
### 
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Having this year departed from the
usual custom of staging a locally pro
duced opera, the Junior Opera Com
mittee desires to state that in so doing,
it had no intention either of discredit
ing local writers, or of establishing a
new precedent in college dramatics.
The sentiment of the class generally,
and of at least a majority of the Com
mittee was distinctly in favor of the
continuance of the old custom. In the
six weeks time, however, which re
maned after the appointment of the
Committee, and before the night for
the production of the opera, it was
deemed impossible to secure and adapt
a suitable local opera. In making the
attempt, the Committee entertained
only the most forlorn hope, and acted
rather from a desire to exhaust all
possible means, than from an expecta
tion of success.
We believe that a suitable Junior
Opera can be locally produced, and
hope that an effort will be made in
time, next year, to secure one. In
furtherance of this object, we .would
suggest that the Opera Committee be
appointed in September, and that th<;
opera be decided upon, and the cast
chosen at least by the end of the fall
semester.
In any event, whether in future
local or professional operas are
chosen, in justice to the opera, the
cast, the Committee, and to everyone
else concerned, not excluding the pub
lic, preparations should be commenced
considerably longer than six weeks
before Junior Day.
We speak from immediate experi
ence, and wish to emphasize these
facts while they are still of general
interest.
