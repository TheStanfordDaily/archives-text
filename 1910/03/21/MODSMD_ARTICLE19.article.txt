# DR. JORDAN TALKS ON POLITICS.
## Gves a Live Address Before the Common wealth Club in San Francisco on Saturday. 
### 
"How to Get Politics Out of Politics"
was the subject of Dr. Jordan's ad
dress before the Commonwealth Club
at a luncheon at the St. Francis in
San Francisco on Saturday.
"The average politician is only a
politician for the purpose of picking
our pockets," said Dr. Jordan. "Tam
many Hall, a great co-operative in
stitution for pocket picking, stands
for that kind of politics and that kind
of politics ought to be done away
with."
"I used to compare the Republican
party to a lot of fat pigs, each with
one foot in the trough, with the other
driving away the Democrats. Every
public man who is paid for what he
does not do or who does not do his
work well is a pig and represents the
kind of politics that picks our pockets."
Besides politics, Dr. Jordan spoke
of the hookworm as being a momen
tous Question and as vital a one as
those upon which the government
scientists are now dealing with, such
as conservation, and pure food. At an
expense of $2 apiece he said that the
government can rid a million people
in the Southern states of this dread
disease.
"The saloon is a monstrosity," he
told his audience, "and inevitably must
go." He then traced the path from
the saloon to broken homes and the
divorce court.
