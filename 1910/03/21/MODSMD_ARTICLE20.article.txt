# Exhibit of Maps and Atlases.
## 
### 
The attention of students and mem
bers of the Faculty is called to the
exhibit of maps and atlases loaned to
the University by the American Geo
graphical Society. The collection,
comprising some fifty aliases and sixty
maps, represents the finest grades of
school wall maps and atlases pro
duced in Europe. The German wall
maps, for example, are among those in
use not only in middle and higher
schools, but also in the university lec
ture courses. Among the more not
able of the maps are those represent
ing geological, economic, and racial
features of the various countries of
central Europe, especially Germany
and Belgium.
The collection will be on exhibit
every afternoon during the coming
week. The maps are in room 214 and
231; the atlases in room 215.
