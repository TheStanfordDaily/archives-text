# "Iolanthe" Nets Average Amount.
## 
### 
The total amount realized from the
sale of seats for the Junior Opera,
"lolanthe," amounted to the sum of
$957, whit-h constitutes an average
sale for that character of a produc
tion. As the legitimate expenses of
the opera this year were above thi
ordinary, this amount will probably
only cover the cost of staging the
piece, according to the Junior Opera
Committee.
