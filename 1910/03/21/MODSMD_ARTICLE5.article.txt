# Hotchkiss Speaks at Services.
## 
### 
Willis R. Hotchkiss spoke upon Af
rican missionary work at the regular
morning services in the chapel lasl
Sunday. Hotchkiss has lived in East
Africa for over fourteen years, and he
told interestingly of the many diffi
culties encountered by the mission
aries in that Country. The task of
learning the language of the natives
without the aid of an interpreter was
of itself almost superhuman, while
the attacks of wild animals keep one
in constant fear of serious injury
and possible death.
