# AVERAGES FOR SEASON
## BATTING AND FIELDING PERCENTAGES COMPILED. McFadden Has Remarkable Hitting Average of 444, Far Eclipsing all His Teammates. 
### 
The Stanford Varsity boasts a batter
in its ranks who out-Wagners the
mighty Hans Wagner himself, accord
ing to the batting averages printed be
low. This sturdy batsman is R. C.
McFadden, '10, whose position in prac
tically all his sixteen games this sea
son has been at the keystone sack. He
is as well, the biggest man in size on
the team. His splendid record as
shown below, is .444 and he is the
only ".300" man on the Cardinal nine.
McFadden's phenominal batting of 2S
hits out of 63 times up is away ahead
of anything that has been done here.
For the sake of a long range compari
son and to see just what is what, it
can be set down that, the best decimal
made by the great Hans Wagner at
the end of the 1909 championship
series, including the whole National
League season, was .399. "Ty" Cobb
in the American League for the same
time batted .377. McFadden's mark
should be engraved heavily, with un
derlining, on the Skull and Snakes
batting cup, which will be awarded in
the near future. It is safe to predict
just where this cup will be found for
the Stanford 1910 baseball season.
The other marks on the list are fairly
respectable. Cochran has and
Jones, who, although not eligible for
the Varsity this year, has played a
good many games, has the same deci
mal. The team average of .233 is un
usually good, and is far ahead of last
year's record, which was an excep
tionally poor one. The Varsity has
ten men this year who have done .200
or better. Scott's mark was the best
last season, and he won the cup at .270.
The year before K. L. Fenton, ex-OS,
was at the head of the list with .278.
Ball's record among the fielding
averages is not one to pass over light
ly. Out of 141 total chances he made
I but two errors for the whole 16 games
in which he played, his mark going
ii]) to .955, which compares well with
all recorded decimals. It is a very
good record. His position has been
in over two-thirds of his games at. thi
, initial sack, a corner of the diamond
I which takes an expert to handle.
Obear in center field has a .929 figure
out of seventeen games, the total play
ed by the team this year. The Mitch
lells have done well, considering the
difficulty of their respective positions,
at third base and short-stop. Their
decimals are .878 and .849,, respective
ly. The records below include the
total games played thus far. The
California series begins next Satur
day. A practice game with the San
.Tose State League team is set for
Wednesday at San Jose.

ten men this year who have done .200

good record. His position has been

Obear in center field has a .929 figure

The Stanford Varsity boasts a batter
in its ranks who out-Wagners the
mighty Hans Wagner himself, accord
ing to the batting averages printed be
low. This sturdy batsman is R. C.
McFadden, '10, whose position in prac
tically all his sixteen games this sea
son has been at the keystone sack. He
is as well, the biggest man in size on
the team. His splendid record as
shown below, is .444 and he is the
only ".300" man on the Cardinal nine.
McFadden's phenominal batting of 2S
hits out of 63 times up is away ahead
of anything that has been done here.
For the sake of a long range compari
son and to see just what is what, it
can be set down that, the best decimal
made by the great Hans Wagner at
the end of the 1909 championship
series, including the whole National
League season, was .399. "Ty" Cobb
in the American League for the same
time batted .377. McFadden's mark
should be engraved heavily, with un
derlining, on the Skull and Snakes
batting cup, which will be awarded in
the near future. It is safe to predict
just where this cup will be found for
the Stanford 1910 baseball season.
The other marks on the list are fairly
respectable. Cochran has and
Jones, who, although not eligible for
the Varsity this year, has played a
good many games, has the same deci
mal. The team average of .233 is un
