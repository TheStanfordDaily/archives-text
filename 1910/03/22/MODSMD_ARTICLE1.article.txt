# INTERCOLLEGIATE RELATIONS MAY BE SEVERED AT ONCE
## Agreement Committees Adjourn Without Breaking Deadlock.â€”Merritt Recommends Abolition of Athletics Until September. 
### 
The severance of Intercollegiate re
lations for the remainder of the pres
ent college year is imminent. For
such was Graduate Manager Merritt's
recommendation at the conclusion of
a stormy gathering of the Intercol
legate Agreement, committees at the
Palace Hotel last evening. Chairman
Richard Barrett explained that the
power of the delegates did not include
the determination of such a recom
mendation, and consequently an ad
journment was taken, Merritt declar
ing that he would call upon the Cali
fornia executive committee to act on
his proposition. Should that body en
dorse the position taken by Merritt,
all Intercollegiate relations will be
non-existant until September, 1910.
That such an action will be ratified
by the Blue and Gold committee is
not at all unlikely, and in fact the
"Daily Californian" believes "that un
less Stanford agrees to the proposal
of the California members for the in
stitution of a rule permitting com
petition for only five years after mat
riculation, athletic relations between
the two universities should be sus
pended."
Six Meetings Without Result.
Last night's session of the commit
tees was the sixth meeting held since
the first of the year in an endavor to
formulate a regulation as regards eli
gibility, which would be satisfactory
to both institutions. Originally, Cali
fornia desired that a student's four
years of competition be limited to the
four years immediately following
matriculation with no allowance for
any time during which that student
might failed to be registered in col
lege. Stanford, on the other hand,
wished that the four years might be
scattered over an unlimited period,
but finally consented to a maximum
term of six years, California at the
same time signifying her acquiescence
in a five-year limitation. Thereafter
neither side would give ground and a
deadlock ensued. Several meetings
brought no results, and finally, for the
purpose of deciding the eligibility
question only, the committees were
augmented by the appointment of two
new delegates by each university.
Warren Olney, ,li\, who was then
chosen by California proposed a rule
which would make an athlete's schol

arship the basis for determining hi.s
eligibility, irrespective of the number
of years which had elapsed since his
original matriculation. Such a rule
was wholly satisfactory to the Cardi
nal delegates, but the Blue and Gold
representatives would not entertain
this proposition as submitted by one
of their own colleagues. Time was
taken, however, for more detailed con
sideration, and yesterday the Califor
-1 nians reported that their faculty ob
j jected to Olney's recommendation,
j while Burbank announced that the
Stanford faculty would give hearty
j endorsement to the adoption of such
ia regulation.
Old Agreement Continues iti Force.
From the recent meetings it was
quite evident the committees were
indefinitely deadlocked, and conse
quently last evening the Stanford dele
gates moved an adjournment and a
report to the two executive committees
that an agreement was impossible.
It was then that the California speak
ers offered their amendment to the
effect that relations should be severed
until September, 1910. Upon Barrett's
explanation that the delegates were
powerless to proceed so far, the meet
ing was adjourned. It is highly im
probable that the present committees
will have anything further to do with
the matter, as at the termination of
yesterday's session the majority of
the members declared themselves
through with the entire question.
In the meantime, through the opera
tion of a clause in the old agreement
that compact continues in force until
the formation of a new agreement,
unless, of course, either Executive
j Committee chose to abandon Intercol
. legiate athletics entirely, in which
j event the pact would be a nullity.
President Shelton of the Associated
Students when seen today said:
"The proposition made by the Stan
ford representatives on the Intercol
legiate Agreement. Committee was em
inently fair and they were justified in
not agreeing to the limitations sug-
I gested by the California representa
tives in the absence of a new agree
ment. between the universities. The
natural thing to do now would be to
continue athletic relations under the
old agreement, as provided for under

From the recent meetings it was
quite evident the committees were
indefinitely deadlocked, and conse
quently last evening the Stanford dele
gates moved an adjournment and a
report to the two executive committees
that an agreement was impossible.
It was then that the California speak
ers offered their amendment to the
effect that relations should be severed
until September, 1910. Upon Barrett's
explanation that the delegates were
powerless to proceed so far, the meet
ing was adjourned. It is highly im
probable that the present committees
will have anything further to do with
the matter, as at the termination of
yesterday's session the majority of
the members declared themselves
through with the entire question.
In the meantime, through the opera
tion of a clause in the old agreement
that compact continues in force until
the formation of a new agreement,
unless, of course, either Executive
j Committee chose to abandon Intercol
. legiate athletics entirely, in which
j event the pact would be a nullity.
President Shelton of the Associated
Students when seen today said:
"The proposition made by the Stan
ford representatives on the Intercol
legiate Agreement. Committee was em
inently fair and they were justified in
not agreeing to the limitations sug-
I gested by the California representa
tives in the absence of a new agree
ment. between the universities. The
natural thing to do now would be to
continue athletic relations under the
old agreement, as provided for under
t hat. agreement.'
The severance of Intercollegiate re
lations for the remainder of the pres
ent college year is imminent. For
such was Graduate Manager Merritt's
recommendation at the conclusion of
a stormy gathering of the Intercol
legate Agreement, committees at the
Palace Hotel last evening. Chairman
Richard Barrett explained that the
power of the delegates did not include
the determination of such a recom
mendation, and consequently an ad
journment was taken, Merritt declar
ing that he would call upon the Cali
fornia executive committee to act on
his proposition. Should that body en
dorse the position taken by Merritt,
all Intercollegiate relations will be
non-existant until September, 1910.
That such an action will be ratified
by the Blue and Gold committee is
not at all unlikely, and in fact the
"Daily Californian" believes "that un
less Stanford agrees to the proposal
of the California members for the in
stitution of a rule permitting com
petition for only five years after mat
riculation, athletic relations between
the two universities should be sus
pended."
Six Meetings Without Result.
Last night's session of the commit
tees was the sixth meeting held since
the first of the year in an endavor to
formulate a regulation as regards eli
gibility, which would be satisfactory
to both institutions. Originally, Cali
fornia desired that a student's four
years of competition be limited to the
four years immediately following
matriculation with no allowance for
any time during which that student
might failed to be registered in col
lege. Stanford, on the other hand,
wished that the four years might be
scattered over an unlimited period,
but finally consented to a maximum
term of six years, California at the
same time signifying her acquiescence
in a five-year limitation. Thereafter
neither side would give ground and a
deadlock ensued. Several meetings
brought no results, and finally, for the
purpose of deciding the eligibility
question only, the committees were
augmented by the appointment of two
new delegates by each university.
Warren Olney, ,li\, who was then
chosen by California proposed a rule
which would make an athlete's schol

arship the basis for determining hi.s
eligibility, irrespective of the number
of years which had elapsed since his
original matriculation. Such a rule
was wholly satisfactory to the Cardi
nal delegates, but the Blue and Gold
representatives would not entertain
this proposition as submitted by one
of their own colleagues. Time was
taken, however, for more detailed con
sideration, and yesterday the Califor
-1 nians reported that their faculty ob
j jected to Olney's recommendation,
j while Burbank announced that the
Stanford faculty would give hearty
j endorsement to the adoption of such
ia regulation.
