The women of the University of
Washington are now in active training
for the annual Women's Interclass
Regatta, which takes place in the
spring on Lake Washington. A dis
patch from the Northern University
states that the Freshman crew of
women is at this time in excellent
shape, while the sophomores are con
fident of carrying off first honors.
