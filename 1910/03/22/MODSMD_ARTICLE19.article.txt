### 
As was announced some time ago. a
Senior Smoker was t.o have been
held tomorrow evening, in some suit
able spot outdoors, similar to tho
smokers held in the past at fraternity
houses. Owing, however, to the in
clemency of the weather, and the prob
ability that if it is not actually rain
ing tomorrow evening, it will be so
wet in the vicinty of the University,
that an outside event would be im
practicable, and almost impossible
to hold, the committee in charge of the
smoker announced today that it would
be postponed until after the Easter
vacation.
It is not definitely known as yet
where or when the smoker will be
held at that time, but the committee
has announced a tentative date and
will make any further announcements
after the University opens following
the recess. The tentative date as set
by the committee is the first Wednes
day of the week that the University
opens, April G. There is nothng final
about this, and the definite date will
be set by the committee at the first op
portunity.
