# Prom Expenses Unusually Heavy.
## 
### 
The financial results of the Junior
Prom will be discussed, and if all
bills are presented to the Junior com
mittee having charge of the hop before
tomorrow evening, the results may be
ready for report at that time. To make
this feasible, the Junior Prom Com
mittee earnestly desires that, all those
holding bills against that board would
present them immediately so that all
expenses can be totalled. Because of
the various extra features of an un
usual type that were introduced in the
annual Junior dance this year, the ex
penses have been more than the .aver
age, according to the committee, at

the present time there is small hope of
the class netting any amount from the
Prom.
