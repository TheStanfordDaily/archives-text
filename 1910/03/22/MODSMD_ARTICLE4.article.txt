# POSTS RUBBING LIST
## TWENTY-SEVEN TRACK MEN ARE NAMED ON FIRST ROLL. Strict Training for Varsity.â€”Captain Scott Requests Marathon Racers to Continue Work. 
### 
Strict training is now in order for
Varsity track men, and with today
begins the strenuous endeavor to
prepare the athletes for the annual
contest with California. The first
move in this direction was made this
morning in posting a rubbing-list con
taining the names of twenty-seven of
the most promising candidates for
Varsity honors. Those who comprise
the list, are as follows:
W. M. Argabrite, '13, S. H. Bellah,
'10, T. L. Coleman, '12, H. L. Horton,
'10, G. S. Horine, '13, A. Johnston, '10,
E. F. Kern, '13, J. B. Leaman, '13, H.
McGuire, '13, R. E. Millsap, '12, W. IL
Newman, '12, A. \V. Peake, '12, H. V.
Poor, *10, L. H. Price, '13, W. D. Peas
lee, '10, \V. S. Porter, '11, E. V. Riul
dick, '13, H. R. Stolz, '10, H. Smither
um, '11, V. Stevens, '13. L. Scott, '10, C.
H. Tallant, '11, E. C. Templeton, '10,
W. M. Wyman, '11, C. C. Whitney, '12,
G. E. Woolley, '12, C. A. Waring, '11,
As other men show their ability on
track or field they will be added to the
list. It is not known whether a train
ing table will be provided for -the
track men this year, but if the Execu
tive Committee decides Lo allow Train
er Moulton the advantage of this
means of conditioning his athletes.
"Dad" will probably gather the Var
sity men around one table during the
last two weeks of the training season.
The phenominal marks made by
many of the contestants in Friday's
Marathon race has led Captain Scott to
request the men who took part in that
affair to train for the Varsity team.
Several of the men went into the race
on Junior Day with scarcely any train
ing at all and still reeled off the quar
er mile at speeds less than 54 seconds.
An excellent chance lies open this
year for a good quarter-miler to make
the relay team, as after the 440-yard
dash is run off in the Intercollegiate
meet, many of the best, men will be
too tired to enter the relay.
