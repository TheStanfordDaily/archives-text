## Large Number of Veterans Fighting for Places on Senior Eight.â€”Little Freshman Material. 
### 
With the interclass race decided, the
crew men will devote their energies
from now on to the formation of a
winning eight for their race against
California on April 9. The squad this
year is stronger than ever before and
competition for places in the shell is
exceedingly keen. With such oarsmen
as J. C. Huston, '10, J. W. Fitting, '10,
C. H. Benson, '10, N. M. Day, '11, .T.
A. Killian, '11, K. L. Chamberlain, '11,
K. L. Dole, '11, F. L. Guerena, '11, H.
L. Dietterle, '12, J. F. Partridge, '12, C
L. Schaupp, '12, R. H. Seward, '12, and
R. R. Gilmore, '12, in active training,
a strong crew should be picked with
out much difficulty.
Work in the eight-oared shells com
menced this afternoon on the bay
near Redwood City. The members of
the Senior squad under the direction
of the coaching committee took out

the shells for short rows over thy
course.
The California men are strongly in
favor of including a Freshman eight
race in the regatta program. If an
eight cannot be formed by the Lag
unita men, a four-oared race will be
substituted.
Under favorable weather conditions
the course selected on the Oakland
Estuary is an ideal one. The finish
point will be at one of the draw
bridges from which an uninterrupted
view of the course may be obtained.
