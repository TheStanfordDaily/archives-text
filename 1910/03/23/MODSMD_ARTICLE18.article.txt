# TO MAKE DEPARTURE
## INTERSCHOLASTIC ASSOCIATION TO HOLD TENNIS TOURNEY. Matches to be Played at Same Time as Annual Track Meet.â€”Many New Schools Enter. 
### 
Beginning with the present year an
Interscholastic tennis tournament will
be a feature of the annual gathering
of high-school athletics on the Stan
ford campus. Almost immediately on
the receipt of the query sent out by
the Board of Governors, as to whether
they would regard such an inovation
with favor, the schools composing the
association dispatched favorable re
plies. In response to this demand the
Board last night decided to institute
a Stanford Interscholastic tennis tour
nament to be held annually at the
same time as the field meet.
The matches will be run off under
the supervision of the Stanford Ten
nis Club, which is to have complete
control under the supervision of the
Board of Governors of the Association.
As only two singles and a doubles
match will be played, it has been
thought advisable to limit the team
from any one school to four men.
The winners of the matches will be
presented with gold trophies and the
runners-up will be awarded silver
medals as mementos. A nominal en
trance fee of fifty cents will be charged
to defray the necessary expenses.
The school from the northern part
of the state and the bay region will be
strongly represented in the tourna
ment but the Ojai Valley contest,
which is to be played at the same
time, will prevent most of the south
ern schools entering tennis men in
this year's tourney.
Hill Military Academy of Portland,
Oregon, has ugain signified its inten
tion of entering a strong track team in
the Interscholastic meet. Together
with the old members of the associa
tion who are to take part in the con
test this year, as usual, applications
have been received from twelve
schools which have heretofore taken
no part in track athletics.
