# INTERCOLLEGIATE EVENTS MAY BE CANCELLED IMMEDIATELY
## 
### 
The Associated Students of the Uni
versity of California at a large meet
ing early this afternoon decided to try
once more the Stanford representa
tives on the Intercollegiate Agreement
committee before severing all athletic
relations between the two institutions.
Another meeting of the two committees
will be held before Saturday. If Stan
ford will agree to the five-year rule of
eligibility, the same to go into effect
in August, 1910, then all will be well,

and the events of the present Spring
will proceed uninterrupted under the
old agreement. If Stanford persists in
adhering to the six-year plan, how
ever, then all Intercollegiate relations
will be severed at once, and the first
Varsity event, the baseball game
scheduled for Saturday, will be the
. first contest to be declared off, and a
I similar fate will come upon the other
games and the Intercollegiate track
meet.
