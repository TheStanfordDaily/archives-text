# "QUAD" GOES TO PRESS
## EVENTS OF JUNIOR WEEK TO BE INSERTED. Press Work Will be Rapidly Completed to Allow Ample Time for Process of Binding. 
### 
With the last copy relating the glad
some events of Junior Week handed in
today by Editor E .C. Matthias of the
College Year department the 1911
"Quad" closes its record of the activ
ities of the University for the last
twelve months and officially goes to
press. Dating from March 19, the
1912 "Quad" will be kept on the alert
to make a like record for the coming
year.
The present Junior annual augurs
well to come off the press in a few
weeks, the most complete and elabor
ate book yet published by a Junior
Class. It has been the policy of the
editor and his corps of assistants to
fully cover every activity of the Uni
versity and to do this in the most at
tractive manner possible. Conse
quently, more new and exclusive pic
tures, more art work for the decora
tion of pages heretofore unembellished
and fuller reports of the various activ
ities will appear in this year's book.
The book as a whole will contain
480 pages, with 450 pages of reading
matter. The forms are now being
locked up and printed in rapid succes
sion, and an endeavor will be made to
speedily finish the press work so as
to give the book plenty of time to
dry in the bindery. The printing and
binding are both being handled by
the H. S. Crocker Co., of San Fran
cisco, while the engraving is rapidly
being completed by the Sierra Art and
Engraving Co., of the same city.
The excellence of the art work and
the novel athletic and college year
pictures will undoubtedly be the fea
ture of the book. No pains have been
spared to make these departments
preeminently successful, since thfiy
give stamp and character to the whole
volume. The art work and half-tonos
of the dramatic department is of an
unusually high character. The work
of A. P. Hill, '13, in this department
is as good as can be secured in the
professional field, none of which of
course appears in the book.
Manager C. A. Christin, '11. reports
that under no consideration will the
"Quad" be sold at any time less than
the original price of $2.50. A more
limited number will be placed on sale,
since many volumes will be sold at
the Cooper Medical College. The pres
ent book owing to the great cost of its
increased size and number of engrav
ings cannot be sold for less than $2.50.
