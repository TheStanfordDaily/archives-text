# COACH TO PICK TEAM
## PRESLEY WILL ANNOUNCE NINE FRIDAY AFTERNOON. Varsity Will Then Elect Captain to Fill Vacancy.â€”Rooters Wanted on Friday. 
### 
The Cardinal Varsity nine which
will take the field against California
in the first of the Intercollegiate ser
ies, is to be chosen by Coach G. J.
Presley on Friday afternoon. The
men will get together at that time
also to elect a captain to lead them.
The team appeared in their new suits
at the San Jose game this afternoon
on the turf field, the object of wearing
them today being to get the men used
to the strange uniforms. The choice
of the suits goes back several years.
They are practically the same as used
by Cardinal Varsities in 1907 and
The color is steel gray, the jerseys
having a gray body with cardinal
sleeves, and the shirt of regular style
with a small "S" on the pocket. Cans,
shoes, but not the regulation jacket
are added, and the whole makes a neat
appearance. Twelve men were grant
ed the privilege of wearing them for
the series.
The California squad of about
twenty players will come to the camp
us early tomorrow afternoon, prob
ably about 1 o'clock, in order to get
preliminary practice on the grass of
Stanford Field. Their diamond at
Berkeley is situated on the football
field, which is bare of turf. The Blue
and Gold men will therefore try to get
used to the kinks and peculiarities of
the Stanford turf.
