# U.S.C. MEET SATURDAY
## SOUTHERN ATHLETES TO ARRIVE FRIDAY NOON. Meet Scheduled For Saturday Morning Unless Intercollegiate Game in Afternoon Cancelled. 
### 
The University of Southern Califor
nia track team which is to meet the
Varsity team on the Stanford oval
Saturday will arrive on the campus
next Friday noon. The southern ath
letes are to be scattered among the
various houses on the campus for en
tertainment.
Graduate Manager Burbank stated
this morning that inasmuch as there
was a strong possibility that Califor
nia would cancel the baseball game
scheduled for Saturday afternoon be
could not say definitely when the meet
would be held. In case California did
suspend Intercollegiate relations at
the meeting held this afternoon, the
meet, he said, would be held on Sat
urday afternoon; otherwise it would
be held on Saturday morning as prev
iously announced. The action of the
University of California student body
this afternoon has, subsequent to this
| morning's interview with Burbank,
definitely decided the time of holding
J the meet.
During its northern trip the team is
to be in charge of Warren Bovard. the
son of the president of the southern
institution.
Saturday morning may witness the
first defeat of the Varsity track team
this year. The athletes from the Uni
versity of Southern California, who
are to meet the Cardinal men at. that
lime, have been performing so well m
! the last few weeks that they may
spring a surprise on Stanford by
securing a victory, but at any rate a
| contest worth seeing will result when
iho two teams hook up.
Perhaps the fastest man on the
Coast, will be entered by the southern
institution in the dashes. Throop
is the wizard, and from his record of
19:4 for the short dash, made last Sat
jurday, he evidently has (lie class on
lanything around the bay. In the long
er sprint Coleman will take the ma;;
| from the south into can]), ')Ut 'be
that, is predicted for the lanky Card'-
inal sprinter in the hundred is a sec
iond place. In fact, in nil the event -
except (be -1 '0-yard da:h the Cardinal
runners will do well in finishing
ahead of their southern adversaries.
Walton and Cower will be entered
iin the 880-yard run, and \. Johnston
'10, will have bis hands full with the
two of them. The Stanford half-miler
• barelv defeated Walton in this evenr

at the meet in Los Angeles. The two
classiest exhibitions of the day, out
side of the sprints, will he in the shot
put and pole-vault. Trotter shoved
the weight a distance of 45 feet 4
inches at the Southern Conference
meet, last week and should easily cap
ture this event Saturday as the
that has been done on the campus
this year is barely over 44 feet, if
competition will cause an athlete to
break a record, Lee Scott should
surely set a new world's mark in the
coming meet, for Richardson, who will
oppose him in the vaulting, is credited
with making a lea]) of 12 feet, 3 inches
already this season.
Taking into consideration the men
entered in the various events, the
Southern California meet will prob
ably result in the best marks of the
season. Captain Scott, today added
the name of R. R. Carter, '12, to the
rubbing list, the quarter-miler bavin ;•

The University of Southern Califor
nia track team which is to meet the
Varsity team on the Stanford oval
Saturday will arrive on the campus
next Friday noon. The southern ath
letes are to be scattered among the
various houses on the campus for en
tertainment.
Graduate Manager Burbank stated
this morning that inasmuch as there
was a strong possibility that Califor
nia would cancel the baseball game
scheduled for Saturday afternoon be
could not say definitely when the meet
would be held. In case California did
suspend Intercollegiate relations at
the meeting held this afternoon, the
meet, he said, would be held on Sat
urday afternoon; otherwise it would
be held on Saturday morning as prev
iously announced. The action of the
University of California student body
this afternoon has, subsequent to this
| morning's interview with Burbank,
definitely decided the time of holding
J the meet.
During its northern trip the team is
to be in charge of Warren Bovard. the
son of the president of the southern
institution.
Saturday morning may witness the
first defeat of the Varsity track team
this year. The athletes from the Uni
versity of Southern California, who
are to meet the Cardinal men at. that
lime, have been performing so well m
! the last few weeks that they may
spring a surprise on Stanford by
securing a victory, but at any rate a
| contest worth seeing will result when
iho two teams hook up.
Perhaps the fastest man on the
Coast, will be entered by the southern
institution in the dashes. Throop
is the wizard, and from his record of
19:4 for the short dash, made last Sat
jurday, he evidently has (lie class on
lanything around the bay. In the long
er sprint Coleman will take the ma;;

that, is predicted for the lanky Card'-
inal sprinter in the hundred is a sec
iond place. In fact, in nil the event -
except (be -1 '0-yard da:h the Cardinal
runners will do well in finishing
ahead of their southern adversaries.
Walton and Cower will be entered
iin the 880-yard run, and \. Johnston
'10, will have bis hands full with the
two of them. The Stanford half-miler

at the meet in Los Angeles. The two
classiest exhibitions of the day, out
side of the sprints, will he in the shot
put and pole-vault. Trotter shoved
the weight a distance of 45 feet 4
inches at the Southern Conference
meet, last week and should easily cap
ture this event Saturday as the
that has been done on the campus
this year is barely over 44 feet, if
competition will cause an athlete to
break a record, Lee Scott should
surely set a new world's mark in the
coming meet, for Richardson, who will
oppose him in the vaulting, is credited
with making a lea]) of 12 feet, 3 inches
already this season.
Taking into consideration the men
entered in the various events, the
Southern California meet will prob
ably result in the best marks of the
season. Captain Scott, today added
the name of R. R. Carter, '12, to the
