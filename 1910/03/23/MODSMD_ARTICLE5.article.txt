# HOWE WANTS CHOICE
## CALIFORNIA COACH PLANS FOR AN AUSTRALIAN TOUR. California, Stanford and Nevada Men Would Go, but Varsities do Not Favor Howe Ticking Team. 
### 
"Mother" Howe, who coached the
California Rugby team last fall, wants
the All-Star Pacific Coast Rushy team,
chosen hy him, and composed of Stan
ford, California, and Nevada players to
tour Australia this summer for a spec
ial schedule of games with the teams
of the Antipodes. This invitation was
sent by J. Hill, secretary of the New
South Wales Rugby Union, in a tele
gram to Ralph Merritt, the California
graduate manager. Howe wants
twenty players sent to the southern
islands, and his choice last fall, in
cluding two substitutes, were nine
California, five Stanford, and three Ne
vada players.
This arrangement, however, is not
agreeable to either the Stanford or
California managers. D. W. Burbank,
'09. the Cardinal representative, wants
the team, provided it is agreed to
send one, to be chosen by a conference
between the respective coaches of the
three fifteens interested, rather than
that the whole choice should remain
with Howe. Merritt, in turn desires
that the party of Varsity men be in
creased to thirty, contending that
twenty men could not carry through a
strenuous program such as scheduled
by the Wales Hugby Unoin.
Stanford desires further that mem
bers of the Cardinal fifteen be sent
who would derive practical benefit for
the future good of the game as played
at the University. That is, that the men
sent, should be those who have still
one or two years in prospect on Var
sity teams, rather than those who
leave college at the close of this year.
The former men, if sent, would get
some very live experience, to help out
coach and team.
The proposition is at present at
loggerheads and no solution is as yet
in sight.
