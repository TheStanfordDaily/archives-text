The action of the California student
body in deciding to make Stanford
concede or to call off all Intercolle
giate relations at once is an unjust
and coercive measure unworthy the
name of sportsmanship. If California
will accept none but the five-year
clause and Stanford none but the six,
ultimate severance of relations is a
necessity. But the cancellation of the
events of the present Spring is unwar
ranted and inadvisable. To hold them
under the old agreement would harm
no one, while their abolition would
work extreme hardship upon the ath
letes directly concerned. California's
attitude lias for its basis neither com
mon sense nor ordinary prudence.
