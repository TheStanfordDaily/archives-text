# McCann Elected to Conference.
## 
### 
E. G. McCaun, 'JO, was chosen this
afternoon to represent the Electrical
Engineers in the University Confer
ence. McCann will lill the vacancy
caused by the resignation of C. 11. Tal
lant, '11. The new delegate hails from
Los Angeles and is a member of En
cina Club.
The yell-leaders want every man,
woman and child in the University to
come out on the bleachers on Friday
afternoon to make up a live prelimin
ary cheering section in order to show
the Stanford nine that not they alone
want to see the championship in base
ball come to the Cardinal campus. All
three yell-leaders are to be present to
lead the rooters and it is a sure thing
that the team will receive open-heart
ed support in their final practice of
the week. The send-off will be a
royal one.
