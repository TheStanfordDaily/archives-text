# ARE GETTING READY
## CALIFORNIA NINE PRACTICES ON TURF FIELD TODAY. Last Stanford Fraction Tomorrow. Admission to Game Set by Burbank at 50 Cents. 
### 
D. W. Burbank, Graduate Manager,
has set the price of admission to the
first game of the California baseball
series next Saturday at 50 cents. This
has been the prevailing price in past
years. The California students will
form a rooting section of several hun
dred, including their cadet band. In
just what bleachers they will sit has
not yet been decided upon. The con
test to decide the championship is to
start at 2:30, when the two rival Var
ities will show their mettle.
Fifteen wearers of the Blue and Gold
invaded the Cardinal campus this
morning on the 11:40 train, beginning
their practice on the turf at about 1
o'clock, with several dozen students
as onlookers. The squad of fifteen in
cluded Coach Z. Smith and Captain
Lewis, second baseman. Batting and
fielding were opened up freely for
the men, and they were made familiar
with the turf diamond. Pitchers
Smith and Harris were warmed up
slightly, but no hard work was in
dulged in by the team. The Coach
had the nine lined up in the following
fashion, and this line-up will un
doubtedly be the first to take their
positions on the field for the Blue and
Gold on Saturday: Catcher, Stoner
or Moulton; pitcher, Smith or Harris;
first base, Greenlaw; second base.
Lewis (captain); short-stop, O'Kelly;
third base. Allen; left field, Coane;
center field. Elliott; right field, Salis
bury. Harris is a right-hander, while
Smith does the southpaw work, a con
dition similar to the Stanford mound
men. The Ireland's Independents
were defeated by this team yesterday
afternoon at Berkeley by the score of
6-1. This is the third game the Cali
fornia nine has won this season.
The Stanford yell-leaders want every
man, woman and child in the univer
sity to appear on the bleachers to
morrow afternoon to give the Cardi
nal team a proof of full-hearted en
couragement, which they will remem
ber when they take their places on
the field Saturday afternoon. The
team practices at 4:30, and the yell
leaders wish to form a preliminary
rooting section to show the nine that
not they alone are interested in bring
ing the baseball championship to the
campus.
