Every Stanford student is asking the
question, "What shall we do about
Intercollegiate athletics ?" The Daily
Palo Alto finds itself hard put to an
swer the question. In determining the
most expedient plan for Stanford to
r
pursue, many considerations confront
us; and of these the most disappoint
ing is California's senselessly stub
horn and highly unsportmanlike man
date. So infantile an outburst reminds
us only of the back-yard bickerings of
childhood, which are prone to include
such declarations as that pronounced
by California, for, in effect, the Blue
and Gold ultimatum is merely, "If
you won't play my way, you can't play
with me at all."
As for the course which Stanford
should pursue, it largely depends upon
California's stand tonight al the joint
session of the executive committees.
Should the continuation of athletics
until August be found practicable
without the formation of any Agree
ment to cover future relations, the
problem would find temporary solu
tion. But if California stands upon her
mandate of yesterday, the Stanford
representatives will have to choose be
tween absolute concession and (he
immediate cancellation of Intercolle
giate activities. In adopting the latter
alternative they would be wholly jus
tified. for their contentions are just,
while the attitude of the Blue and Gold
is distinctly unjut. Should the dele
gates, howevei*, deem it wiser to yield
than to sacrifice athletics, they could
do so with good grace, knowing the
reasonableness of their demands and
the unreasonableness of the stand
which forced them to the action. In
this event, the Stanford men alone
could boast of their deeds as those of
gentlemen and sportsmen.
