# Owen Chosen To Load Orchestra.
## 
### 
The University orchestra last night
elected H. D. Owen, '11, as leader to
fill the vacancy caused by the resig
nation of R. M. Ford, '09. Owen has
been prominent in musical organiza
tions, having directed the band last
year, and is fully capable of filling
the position to which he has been
elected.
The members of the orchestra also
decided to temporarily disband hut
will reorganize later to rehearse for
the Senior play, the last production of
the semester.
