# Vaughn and Dunham Excell In Chess.

### 
At present the round robin chess
tournament is practically half played
and the two men who have shown the
most Varsity calibre are R. L. Vaughn,
'12, and C. T. Dunham, '13. Many of
the games of this first half have been
closely contested and if the rivalry of
the second half continues to be as
spirited, the picking of the seven men
to defend Stanford will be no easy mat
ter. Those in charge hope to have the
tournament finished by the end of the
Easter vacation so that the men who
will compose the team may have the
two weeks following for practice. Cal
ifornia is to have a far stronger team
than last year and the Stanford men
in anticipation of this are doing all in
their power to gather together an
equally formidable aggregation. The
games as played the last two weeks
show the following results:
W. M. Davidson, '10, won from H.

Mann, '10: R. 1,. Vaughn, '12; won
from C. T. Dunham, '13; also from 11.
Rosse, '10. E. R. Weaver, '10, and IJ.
A. Butler, '13.
