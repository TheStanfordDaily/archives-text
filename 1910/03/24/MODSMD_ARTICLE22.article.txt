# VARSITY NINE IS IMPROVING.
## San Jose Leaguers Are Defeated in Fastest Game of Season.—Obear Good With Stick. 
### 
The Cardinal nine yesterday cele
brated the first wearing of their new
suits by defeating the San Jose state
league team by a 1-0 score in the pret
tiest exhibition of the national game
that has been seen on the campus this
year. "Jimmie" Obear was probably
the hero of the contest. Coming to
the bat three times and getting three
hits, one of which scored Ganong,
the only man to cross the plate during
the game. On both sides a good grade
of ball was put up, the leaguers play
ing an errorless game and the Cardinal
men making only three errors.
Reed, Gilfillan and Theile all took a
shift in the box, and were uniformly
successful in puzzling the leaguers
from the Garden City with their bend
ers. Until the first of the seventh the
visitors had been unable to hit the ball
safely, but in this and the following
inning they managed to get two little
singles off Theile. Goodwin did the
twirling for the artists from San Jose
for the first six frames, when he was
relieved by Logan.
First base on balls —Off Reed, 1; off
Gilfillan 0; off Thiele 1; off Goodwin,
1; off Lagan, 1. Struck out—By Reed,
1; by Gilfillan, 3; and by Theile, 3; by
Goodwin, 1; by Logan, 0. Left on
bases, Stanford 3; San Jose 1. Time of
game—l hour and lo minutes. Um
pire—Dashwood.
