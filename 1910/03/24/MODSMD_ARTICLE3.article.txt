# TWO EXECUTIVE COMMITTEES WILL ATTEMPT SETTLEMENT
## By Joint Agreement Tonight Stanford Delegates Hope To Prevent Immediate Severance of Intercollegiate Relations. 
### 
Tonight should see the final deter
mination of the dispute over the eligi
bility rule of the Intercollegiate
Agreeement. The Stanford Executive
Committee yesterday evening decided
to make one more endeavor to pre
vent the cancellation of the various
events of the current semester, and,
in accordance with this idea, the exe
cutive committees of the Blue and Gold
institution and of this University will
convene tonight in joint session at the
California Club in San Francisco. The
entire matter will then be considered
in detail. Whatever the result of this
meeting, it should be in every respect
final for the two committees in this
instance are courts of iast resort, from
which no appeal can be taken. In
large part it is for this reason that the
matter has been taken out of the hands
of the Intercollegiate Agreement com
mttees, for even if those bodies were
able to come to a conclusion, such an
action would have to receive the rati
fication of the executive boards of the
universities before going into effect.
Should tonight's meeting be productive
of any settlement, however, it will be
lasting and conclusive, for no ratifica
tion of any kind will then be needed.
The Stanford Executive Committee
suggested the joint session because
its members are unable to see the
advisability or necessity of cancelling
the approaching Intercollegiate events,
even though the formation of a new
and permanent agreement to govern
future athletic relations be proven an
utter impossibility. By consenting to
the continuation of the old compact
until August, provided that her eligi
bility rule takes effect at that date.
California is presumed to have ad
mitted that no particular harm or
damage will be imposed, should tennis.

baseball and track be decided for 1910
under the existing pact. If no injus
tice will result from such a course,
the Stanford committee believes that
those events should be held indepen
dently of the formation of a new agree
ment which, even according to Califor
nia's demands, will not go into effect
before next Fall. Consequently, the
local committee went to San Francisco
this afternoon with the avowed and
primary purpose of insuring the oc
curance of the Intercollegiate events
of this Spring if such were possible.
The men were far less concerned with
the final determination of future re
lations, for this, they knew, was a
matter which would ill bear hasty
consideration.
But according to the stand assumed
by California at yesterday's meeting
of the student body, the continuation
of athletics during the next month was
made absolutely dependent upon Stan
ford's willingness to yield the Blue and
Gold men their point by agreeing to
the five-"year eligibility rule, the same
to be binding after August 1. Tho
Stanford committee intends to do its
utmost to cause theCaliforniamembers
to treat and settle the two matters of
present and future relations separately
and independenly.. Failing in this.
President Shelton and his confrers
would give no intimation as to what
course they would then pursue.
The Executive Committee will as
suredly endeavor to carry out the
wishes of the Student Body, but in the
absence of a general mass meeting,
those wishes are extremely difficult,
if not absolutely impossible, of deter
mination. Arguments pro and con are
heard on every side, many methods of
procedure being advocated by the un
dergraduates at large.
