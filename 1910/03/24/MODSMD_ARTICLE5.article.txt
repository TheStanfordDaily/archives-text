# F.S.C. TEAM LEAVES SOUTH.
## Students Expect a Victory From Stanford. Predict Taking at Least Seven First Places. 
### 
A telegram from Los Angeles this
evening announced the departure of
the southern athletes for Stanford
Amidst the plaudits of the assembled
student body, the track athletes repre
enting the University of Southern Cal
ifornia left the Arcade depot at 7:30
this evening, on their northern trip.
The team, which goes to Palo Alto
to meet the Stanford University husk
ies, is composed of the best athletes in
Southern California and it is believed
that, they will be more tha- :i match
for their northern adversaries. Firsi
places are counted for U. S. C. in the
hundred-yard dash, the half-mile, the
mile-run, both hurdle events, the shot
put and broad jump wit.i a good chance
with Richardson in the vault to at
least tie for the premier position. The
men will arrive at .'alo Alto at. 11: Ir,
Friday morning, and will spend the
remainder of the day in resting for
their contest. They will return to Los
Angeles on Sunday.

On account of the troubles between
the two bis; institutions from around
the bay, Leland Stanford may hence
forth make its annual meet with U. S
0. the big event of its athletic year.
