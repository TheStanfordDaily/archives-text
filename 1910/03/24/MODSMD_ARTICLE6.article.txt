# HAMMER THROWN FAR
## J.E. WOOLLEY, '12, SENDING OUT WEIGHT IN OLD STYLE. Fast Time Made by Coleman Places Him Among Quarter-Miters.-â€”Stolz A Versatile Athlete. 
### 
A great weight has been lifted from
"Dad" Moulton's mind during the past
week. The veteran trainer was be
coming somewhat nervous over the
apparent inability of any of our
weight men to hurl the hammer more
than 130 feet and J. E. Woolley, '12,
who last year was counted on as good
for close to 150 feet, seemed to have
reached his limit at 25 feet less than
that distance. However, Woolley re
gained his form, and now his throws
never fall below 140 feet; consequent
ly the care-free look on "Dad's" count
enance.
The work of T. L. Coleman, '12, in
the Marathon last Friday has added
another possibility to the list of quar
ter-milers and relay men. The speedy
sprinter proved a decided surprise to
everyone, and most of all to himself,
when he encircled the track in the fast
time of 51:2. If competition in the
sprints does not exhaust him too much,
Coleman may cause California some
worriment in the 440-yard event on
the day of the Intercollegiate meet.
Probably H. R. Stolz, '10, is the
most versatile man on track and field
registered in the University. Not
alone is Stolz a sprinter of ability, but
he is a broad-jumper, a quarter and
half-miler of worth. In the broad
jump he is the only man in the Uni
versity looked on to do more than 22
feet, while the time of 51:1 for the
quarter places the stocky athlete
among the best of them. Last, but not
least, is the fact that Stolz is able to
cover the half-mile in close to 2:03.
