### 
Carl Field Gaiiong, '10, of
Oregon City. Ore., was this af
ternoon unanimously chosen by
the Varsity squad to lead the
1010 Baseball Team. .The elec
tion was held in the training
house at about five o'clock.
Ganong has been on the Cardi
nal Varsity squad for his entire
four years of college life. Last
year he made his emblem in
the California series, playing
right field. .His natural posi
tion, however, is behind the hat,
where he will direct the tenia's
firing line tomorrow afternoon.
Ganong prepared for college sit
Portland High, and is a mem
ber of the Tlietn Delta Chi fra
ternity, majoring in Civil Engi
neering. .He is also a football
player of note, being a member
of the victorious 1000 Varsitj
Fifteen. .Skull and Snakes
claims him as a member.

Stanford will tomorrow afternoon
set in action the Varsity team that is
to fight the good fight to wrest from
California the baseball* championship
of 1910 and to capture the first series
since 1907. This, the first game of the
two or three game series, as the case
may be, will lie played on Stanford
Field at 2:30 o'clock, if the weather
gods permit. If not the struggle will
be postponed one week.
There is no reason for doubting that
the first victory will come to the Car
dinal Varsity, providing the team
plays as it has played and as it has
shown it can play the past two months.
The men have lined up in contests
with as formidable amateur players
as will be found on the Coast, and
have acquitted themselves with credit
in every instance where a little more
than ordinary was at stake. In those
instances they have shown that, they
can play together, and that their team
is a mighty good machine. If I hey
play as the past season has seen them
