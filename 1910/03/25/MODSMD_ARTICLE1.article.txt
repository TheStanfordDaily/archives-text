# RIVAL TEAMS READY
## COACHES CHOOSE VARSITIES FOR TOMORROW'S GAME. Stanford is the Favorite and if the Nine Shows Full Strength Will Win Easily. 
### 
Carl Field Gaiiong, '10, of
Oregon City. Ore., was this af
ternoon unanimously chosen by
the Varsity squad to lead the
1010 Baseball Team. .The elec
tion was held in the training
house at about five o'clock.
Ganong has been on the Cardi
nal Varsity squad for his entire
four years of college life. Last
year he made his emblem in
the California series, playing
right field. .His natural posi
tion, however, is behind the hat,
where he will direct the tenia's
firing line tomorrow afternoon.
Ganong prepared for college sit
Portland High, and is a mem
ber of the Tlietn Delta Chi fra
ternity, majoring in Civil Engi
neering. .He is also a football
player of note, being a member
of the victorious 1000 Varsitj
Fifteen. .Skull and Snakes
claims him as a member.

Stanford will tomorrow afternoon
set in action the Varsity team that is
to fight the good fight to wrest from
California the baseball* championship
of 1910 and to capture the first series
since 1907. This, the first game of the
two or three game series, as the case
may be, will lie played on Stanford
Field at 2:30 o'clock, if the weather
gods permit. If not the struggle will
be postponed one week.
There is no reason for doubting that
the first victory will come to the Car
dinal Varsity, providing the team
plays as it has played and as it has
shown it can play the past two months.
The men have lined up in contests
with as formidable amateur players
as will be found on the Coast, and
have acquitted themselves with credit
in every instance where a little more
than ordinary was at stake. In those
instances they have shown that, they
can play together, and that their team
is a mighty good machine. If I hey
play as the past season has seen them
perform there is no doubt as to who
will win tomorrow. If the Stanford
men go on the field understanding
that they must play together to get
the victory they will get it. They
must put every ounce of that strength
which they revealed so freely in the
St. Mary's twelve-inning game and in
the eleven-inning contest with Santa
Clara into the California match Sat
urday. Once they develop tomorrow
the team work which they were call
able of in those two games the out
come of the first match will no longer
be in danger. Championship contests
often tip the scales in queer directions.
The California supporters are proph
esing that when the teams actually
face each other that no amount of
past records will have any weight.
That is true only as far as one nine
is too confident of itself. The Cardi
nal men are not over confident. They
know that they have hitters and field
ers among them who far surpass any
among the Blue and Gold; that the
team average with the hickory and
with the glove is superior almost
twice over to California's best show
ing. Their work is not, however, de
moralized by being too sure of them
selves. They will therefore, fight as
they have fought in other games with
much at stake, and the winning should
be easy.
California has won but three games
out of eleven played. These three
contests have been with doubtful
teams. Berkeley High and Pensacola,
with Wednesday's victory over Ire
land's Independents. The sum total
of this is: they are nothing to be
afraid of. Stanford on the other hand,

has come very close to putting the
scalps of the two Catholic College
teams on her belt, and in every game
deciding the championship has never
lost the quality of cool-headedness
necessary to the nervous situations
created in decisive matches. Stanford
has had this year that indefinable
spirit of tight known to the student
world as "pep"—a spirit far ahead of
last year although not in as rull
hearted a quantity as is always needed.
"King" Brady, the former St.
Mary's and California first baseman,
will hold the indicator on the diamond
tomorrow afternoon.

the eleven-inning contest with Santa
Clara into the California match Sat
urday. Once they develop tomorrow
the team work which they were call
able of in those two games the out
come of the first match will no longer
be in danger. Championship contests
often tip the scales in queer directions.
The California supporters are proph
esing that when the teams actually
face each other that no amount of
past records will have any weight.
That is true only as far as one nine
is too confident of itself. The Cardi
nal men are not over confident. They
know that they have hitters and field
ers among them who far surpass any
among the Blue and Gold; that the
team average with the hickory and
with the glove is superior almost
twice over to California's best show
ing. Their work is not, however, de
moralized by being too sure of them
selves. They will therefore, fight as
they have fought in other games with
much at stake, and the winning should
be easy.
California has won but three games
out of eleven played. These three
contests have been with doubtful
teams. Berkeley High and Pensacola,
with Wednesday's victory over Ire
land's Independents. The sum total
of this is: they are nothing to be
afraid of. Stanford on the other hand,

has come very close to putting the
scalps of the two Catholic College
teams on her belt, and in every game
deciding the championship has never
lost the quality of cool-headedness
necessary to the nervous situations
created in decisive matches. Stanford
has had this year that indefinable
spirit of tight known to the student
world as "pep"—a spirit far ahead of
last year although not in as rull
hearted a quantity as is always needed.
"King" Brady, the former St.

Carl Field Gaiiong, '10, of
Oregon City. Ore., was this af
ternoon unanimously chosen by
the Varsity squad to lead the
1010 Baseball Team. .The elec
tion was held in the training
house at about five o'clock.
Ganong has been on the Cardi
nal Varsity squad for his entire
four years of college life. Last
year he made his emblem in
the California series, playing
right field. .His natural posi
tion, however, is behind the hat,
where he will direct the tenia's
firing line tomorrow afternoon.
Ganong prepared for college sit
Portland High, and is a mem
ber of the Tlietn Delta Chi fra
ternity, majoring in Civil Engi
neering. .He is also a football
player of note, being a member
of the victorious 1000 Varsitj

claims him as a member.

Stanford will tomorrow afternoon
set in action the Varsity team that is
to fight the good fight to wrest from
California the baseball* championship
of 1910 and to capture the first series
since 1907. This, the first game of the
two or three game series, as the case
may be, will lie played on Stanford
Field at 2:30 o'clock, if the weather
gods permit. If not the struggle will
be postponed one week.
There is no reason for doubting that
the first victory will come to the Car
dinal Varsity, providing the team
plays as it has played and as it has
shown it can play the past two months.
The men have lined up in contests
with as formidable amateur players
as will be found on the Coast, and
have acquitted themselves with credit
in every instance where a little more
than ordinary was at stake. In those
instances they have shown that, they
can play together, and that their team
is a mighty good machine. If I hey
play as the past season has seen them
perform there is no doubt as to who
will win tomorrow. If the Stanford
men go on the field understanding
that they must play together to get
the victory they will get it. They
