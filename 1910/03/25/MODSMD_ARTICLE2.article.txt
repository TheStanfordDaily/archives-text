# Student Body Votes to Continue Season's Athletics with California
## Baseball and Track Events Will Take Place. Motion to Sever Relations Defeated in Meeting Today, 413-370. 
### 
Stanford will continue her athletic
relations with the University of Cali
fornia during the coming spring and
fall seasons. This decision was
reached this afternoon in a record
breaking Assembly when the members
of the Student Body agreed to accept
the ultimatum issued by the represen
tatives of California at the last meet
ing of the Intercollegiate Agreement
Committee.
At that meeting of the representa
tives of both universities at the Palacc
Hotel last evening, the California
members of the committee submitted
the five year rule as the only rule
upon which they would assent to the
continuance of Intercollegiate athletic
activities.
It was made plain that this five year
rule must be unconditionally accepted
by Stanford this afternoon or athletic
relations would be immediately sev
ered by :he University of California
The meeting was called by Student
Rody President J. E. Shelton for the
purpose of determining the sentiment
of the students upon this question.
Various expressions of opinion were
given by prominent members of the
Student Body both in favor of accept
ing and of rejecting the ultimatum is
sued by California.
Student Advisor A. E. Roth urged
the acceptance of the five year rule,
inferring that the loss sustained by
accepting the ultimatum would not be
as great as the injury done by I he
severance of all Intercollegiate ath
letic relations. According to Roth, the
main difficulty has arisen over the
question of the inequality in the schol
astic, qualifications of athletes in the
two universities and there may be
opportunities in the future of alleviat
ing this unequal position that the
competing teams are placed in by
these qualifications.
Coach G. .T. Presley expressed him
self as unwilling to give his personal
opinion upon a decision as, "After
arguing for seven nights with Califor
nia I am in no sane frame of mind to
discuss this question." Presley gave
the Student Body the history of the
negotiations as carried on by the Inter
collegiate Agreement Committee and
expressed himself as certain that in

fiuence has been used in railroading;
certain resolutions through the Uni
versity of California Student Body.
"The five year rule is not a bad rule.
It will not affect as many men in
twenty years as the severance of all
athletic relations with California."
This was the opinion of H. R. Stolz,
'09, who spoke at length upon the ad
visability of accepting the ultimatum.
He considered the question of swal
lowing pride and accepting the dic
tates of California of small impor
tance compared with the injury that
would result from the discontinuance
of Intercollegiate sports. He was of
the opinion that the California Student
Body had not fully considered the
question and that the ultimatum was
not wholly a product of their initia
tive and sentiment.
Among those who talked upon the
topic before the students, were Grad
uate Manager I). \Y. Burbank, '09, for
mer captain, M. M. Mitchell. '10, \V.
P. Fuller, Jr., '10, Captain L. S. Scott,
'10, M.Y. Malone, '10, and G.A. Ditz, '11.
Immediately following the discus
sion by the above speakers H. L. Hor
ton, '08, introduced a motion that, "We
reject unconditionally the ultimatum
of Berkeley." A division was called
I for in the voting upon this question
.with the result that the motion was
J lost by the close vote of 41.1 to 370.
This amounts to the acceptance of the
five year rule advocated by Califor
nia's representatives and means that
athletic relations will continue during
the coming track and baseball seasons.
An athlete under this ruling will be
eligible to compete for five years com
mencing from the date of matricula
tion of the student.
It was moved by H. R. Stolz that a
committee be appointed by President
Shelton for the purpose of compiling
] resolutions to send to California in
j forming them of Stanford's action ,md
explaining the position that Stanford
lias assumed in this matter. Follow
ing is the resolution:
Resolved, That Stanford unqualified
refuse the ultimatum sent, by 'he
University of California. The proposi
tion made by the University of Cali
fornia was, that unless Stanford
agreed to the rule, that no students
should compete in any athletic con
test later than five years from the date
of his matriculation, California would
at once sever all athletic relations
with Stanford. This motion was lost
by a vote of 413 to 370. After this
meeting the executive committee de
cided to accept the proposition
amended by California, the same to
go into effect January 1, 1911.
The Stanford student body took this
action for the following reasons:
We feel that the hasty action taKen
by the students at the University of
Calfornia was due to a misapprehen
ion as to the attitude of the Stanford
Student Body. Our executive com
mittee has never placed itself on
record as saying that we would or
would not accept any specific rule, and
have hence sent our delegates to the
agreement committee uninstructed.
We believe that the rule suggested by
California is not the fairest rule which
could be adopted, due to the difference
in the scholarship conditions at the
two universities, Stanford will heartily
cooperate in any movement which will
tend to raise the standard of athletics,
or exclude from competition any men
who are not in every sense bonafide
students. It is for this reason that
the Stanford men were unwilling that
the relations of the two universities
should come to an end as the result of
too hasty actions, where one had al
most, precipiated it. The limitation of
competition to five years is not .lie?
vital question in the relations between
the universities. The point wherein
the inequality lies, is in the different
scholarship requirements enforced by
the two universities, not as to the
period of competition. The severing
of athletic relations, effecting as it
does, the students and alumni of the
two universities should not be lightly
dealt with. Relations once interrupt
ed, are not easily resumed and our
many mutual interests would suffer
severely. For these reasons, we ac
ceded to the demands of California,
and have accepted the rule above
stated, which we feel works some in
justice. but which does not strike at
the serious inequality between the
two student bodies.
On this question of equal scholar
ship requirements we feel very strong
ly. Until the two universities are m
der the same rules in this respect
there can never lie fairness and equal
ity as a basis for competition. At
Stanford in order to be elegible a man
must make at least, two thirds of the
work which he has taken for the first
time. The average course is fifteen
hours and the minimum thirteen hours.
At the University of California a
man is required to make eight hours,
irrespective of the amount of work
carried and work which be is taking
for the second time may be included
in these eight, hours.
University of California lias no pro
bation rules and hence a man is elig
ible to compete if he is registered in
the university. At Stanford probation
rules prevent a large nubmer of men
from competing.
Because of the above stated in
equalities thr> Stanford Student, Body
feels very strongly that some rule
which would equalize the standard of
scholarship eligibility and which
would insure a high standard of
scholarship for athletes should be
adopted, and Stanford will make every
effort to secure the adoption of some
such rule at, the next, and at. every
subsequent suitable opportunity.
Stanford will continue her athletic
relations with the University of Cali
fornia during the coming spring and
fall seasons. This decision was

It will not affect as many men in
twenty years as the severance of all
athletic relations with California."
This was the opinion of H. R. Stolz,
'09, who spoke at length upon the ad
visability of accepting the ultimatum.
He considered the question of swal
lowing pride and accepting the dic
tates of California of small impor
tance compared with the injury that
would result from the discontinuance
of Intercollegiate sports. He was of
the opinion that the California Student
Body had not fully considered the
question and that the ultimatum was
not wholly a product of their initia
tive and sentiment.
Among those who talked upon the
topic before the students, were Grad
uate Manager I). \Y. Burbank, '09, for
mer captain, M. M. Mitchell. '10, \V.
P. Fuller, Jr., '10, Captain L. S. Scott,
'10, M.Y. Malone, '10, and G.A. Ditz, '11.
Immediately following the discus
sion by the above speakers H. L. Hor
ton, '08, introduced a motion that, "We
reject unconditionally the ultimatum
of Berkeley." A division was called
I for in the voting upon this question
.with the result that the motion was
J lost by the close vote of 41.1 to 370.
This amounts to the acceptance of the
five year rule advocated by Califor
nia's representatives and means that
athletic relations will continue during
the coming track and baseball seasons.
An athlete under this ruling will be
eligible to compete for five years com
mencing from the date of matricula
tion of the student.
It was moved by H. R. Stolz that a
committee be appointed by President
Shelton for the purpose of compiling
] resolutions to send to California in
j forming them of Stanford's action ,md
explaining the position that Stanford
lias assumed in this matter. Follow
ing is the resolution:
Resolved, That Stanford unqualified
refuse the ultimatum sent, by 'he
University of California. The proposi
tion made by the University of Cali
fornia was, that unless Stanford
agreed to the rule, that no students
should compete in any athletic con
test later than five years from the date
of his matriculation, California would
at once sever all athletic relations
with Stanford. This motion was lost
by a vote of 413 to 370. After this
meeting the executive committee de
cided to accept the proposition
amended by California, the same to
go into effect January 1, 1911.
The Stanford student body took this
action for the following reasons:
We feel that the hasty action taKen
by the students at the University of
Calfornia was due to a misapprehen
ion as to the attitude of the Stanford
Student Body. Our executive com
mittee has never placed itself on
record as saying that we would or
would not accept any specific rule, and
have hence sent our delegates to the
agreement committee uninstructed.
We believe that the rule suggested by
California is not the fairest rule which
could be adopted, due to the difference
in the scholarship conditions at the
two universities, Stanford will heartily
cooperate in any movement which will
tend to raise the standard of athletics,
or exclude from competition any men
who are not in every sense bonafide
students. It is for this reason that
the Stanford men were unwilling that
the relations of the two universities
should come to an end as the result of
too hasty actions, where one had al
most, precipiated it. The limitation of
competition to five years is not .lie?
vital question in the relations between
the universities. The point wherein
the inequality lies, is in the different
scholarship requirements enforced by
the two universities, not as to the
period of competition. The severing
of athletic relations, effecting as it
does, the students and alumni of the
two universities should not be lightly
dealt with. Relations once interrupt
ed, are not easily resumed and our
many mutual interests would suffer
severely. For these reasons, we ac
ceded to the demands of California,
and have accepted the rule above
stated, which we feel works some in
justice. but which does not strike at
the serious inequality between the
two student bodies.
On this question of equal scholar
ship requirements we feel very strong
ly. Until the two universities are m
der the same rules in this respect
there can never lie fairness and equal
ity as a basis for competition. At
Stanford in order to be elegible a man
must make at least, two thirds of the
work which he has taken for the first
time. The average course is fifteen
hours and the minimum thirteen hours.
At the University of California a
man is required to make eight hours,
irrespective of the amount of work
carried and work which be is taking
for the second time may be included
in these eight, hours.
University of California lias no pro
bation rules and hence a man is elig
ible to compete if he is registered in
the university. At Stanford probation
rules prevent a large nubmer of men
from competing.
Because of the above stated in
equalities thr> Stanford Student, Body
feels very strongly that some rule
which would equalize the standard of
scholarship eligibility and which
would insure a high standard of
scholarship for athletes should be
adopted, and Stanford will make every
effort to secure the adoption of some
such rule at, the next, and at. every
subsequent suitable opportunity.
Stanford will continue her athletic
relations with the University of Cali
fornia during the coming spring and
fall seasons. This decision was
reached this afternoon in a record
breaking Assembly when the members
of the Student Body agreed to accept
the ultimatum issued by the represen
tatives of California at the last meet
ing of the Intercollegiate Agreement
Committee.
At that meeting of the representa
tives of both universities at the Palacc
Hotel last evening, the California
members of the committee submitted
the five year rule as the only rule
upon which they would assent to the
continuance of Intercollegiate athletic
activities.
It was made plain that this five year
rule must be unconditionally accepted
by Stanford this afternoon or athletic
relations would be immediately sev
ered by :he University of California
The meeting was called by Student
Rody President J. E. Shelton for the
purpose of determining the sentiment
of the students upon this question.
Various expressions of opinion were
given by prominent members of the
Student Body both in favor of accept
ing and of rejecting the ultimatum is
sued by California.
Student Advisor A. E. Roth urged
the acceptance of the five year rule,
inferring that the loss sustained by
accepting the ultimatum would not be
as great as the injury done by I he
severance of all Intercollegiate ath
letic relations. According to Roth, the
main difficulty has arisen over the
question of the inequality in the schol
astic, qualifications of athletes in the
two universities and there may be
opportunities in the future of alleviat
ing this unequal position that the
competing teams are placed in by
these qualifications.
Coach G. .T. Presley expressed him
self as unwilling to give his personal
opinion upon a decision as, "After
arguing for seven nights with Califor
nia I am in no sane frame of mind to
discuss this question." Presley gave
the Student Body the history of the
negotiations as carried on by the Inter
collegiate Agreement Committee and
expressed himself as certain that in

fiuence has been used in railroading;
certain resolutions through the Uni
versity of California Student Body.

test later than five years from the date
of his matriculation, California would
at once sever all athletic relations
with Stanford. This motion was lost
by a vote of 413 to 370. After this
meeting the executive committee de
cided to accept the proposition
amended by California, the same to
go into effect January 1, 1911.
The Stanford student body took this
action for the following reasons:
We feel that the hasty action taKen
by the students at the University of
Calfornia was due to a misapprehen
ion as to the attitude of the Stanford
Student Body. Our executive com
mittee has never placed itself on
record as saying that we would or
would not accept any specific rule, and
have hence sent our delegates to the
agreement committee uninstructed.
We believe that the rule suggested by
California is not the fairest rule which
could be adopted, due to the difference
in the scholarship conditions at the
two universities, Stanford will heartily
cooperate in any movement which will
tend to raise the standard of athletics,
or exclude from competition any men
who are not in every sense bonafide
students. It is for this reason that
the Stanford men were unwilling that
the relations of the two universities
should come to an end as the result of
too hasty actions, where one had al
most, precipiated it. The limitation of
competition to five years is not .lie?
vital question in the relations between
the universities. The point wherein
the inequality lies, is in the different
scholarship requirements enforced by
the two universities, not as to the
period of competition. The severing
of athletic relations, effecting as it
does, the students and alumni of the
two universities should not be lightly
dealt with. Relations once interrupt
ed, are not easily resumed and our
many mutual interests would suffer
severely. For these reasons, we ac
ceded to the demands of California,
and have accepted the rule above
stated, which we feel works some in
justice. but which does not strike at
the serious inequality between the
two student bodies.
On this question of equal scholar
ship requirements we feel very strong
ly. Until the two universities are m
der the same rules in this respect
there can never lie fairness and equal
ity as a basis for competition. At
Stanford in order to be elegible a man
must make at least, two thirds of the
work which he has taken for the first
time. The average course is fifteen
hours and the minimum thirteen hours.
At the University of California a
man is required to make eight hours,
irrespective of the amount of work
carried and work which be is taking
for the second time may be included
in these eight, hours.
University of California lias no pro
bation rules and hence a man is elig
ible to compete if he is registered in
the university. At Stanford probation
rules prevent a large nubmer of men
from competing.
Because of the above stated in
equalities thr> Stanford Student, Body
feels very strongly that some rule
which would equalize the standard of
scholarship eligibility and which
would insure a high standard of
scholarship for athletes should be
adopted, and Stanford will make every
effort to secure the adoption of some
such rule at, the next, and at. every
subsequent suitable opportunity.
Stanford will continue her athletic
relations with the University of Cali
fornia during the coming spring and
fall seasons. This decision was
reached this afternoon in a record
breaking Assembly when the members
of the Student Body agreed to accept
the ultimatum issued by the represen
tatives of California at the last meet
ing of the Intercollegiate Agreement
Committee.
At that meeting of the representa
tives of both universities at the Palacc
Hotel last evening, the California
members of the committee submitted
the five year rule as the only rule
upon which they would assent to the
continuance of Intercollegiate athletic
activities.
It was made plain that this five year
rule must be unconditionally accepted
by Stanford this afternoon or athletic
relations would be immediately sev
ered by :he University of California
The meeting was called by Student
Rody President J. E. Shelton for the
purpose of determining the sentiment
of the students upon this question.
Various expressions of opinion were
given by prominent members of the
Student Body both in favor of accept
ing and of rejecting the ultimatum is
sued by California.
Student Advisor A. E. Roth urged
the acceptance of the five year rule,
inferring that the loss sustained by
accepting the ultimatum would not be
as great as the injury done by I he
severance of all Intercollegiate ath
letic relations. According to Roth, the
main difficulty has arisen over the
question of the inequality in the schol
astic, qualifications of athletes in the
two universities and there may be
opportunities in the future of alleviat
ing this unequal position that the
competing teams are placed in by
these qualifications.
Coach G. .T. Presley expressed him
self as unwilling to give his personal
opinion upon a decision as, "After
arguing for seven nights with Califor
nia I am in no sane frame of mind to
discuss this question." Presley gave
the Student Body the history of the
negotiations as carried on by the Inter
collegiate Agreement Committee and
expressed himself as certain that in

fiuence has been used in railroading;
certain resolutions through the Uni
versity of California Student Body.
"The five year rule is not a bad rule.
It will not affect as many men in
twenty years as the severance of all
athletic relations with California."
This was the opinion of H. R. Stolz,
'09, who spoke at length upon the ad
visability of accepting the ultimatum.
He considered the question of swal
lowing pride and accepting the dic
tates of California of small impor
tance compared with the injury that
would result from the discontinuance
of Intercollegiate sports. He was of
the opinion that the California Student
Body had not fully considered the
question and that the ultimatum was
not wholly a product of their initia
tive and sentiment.
Among those who talked upon the
topic before the students, were Grad
uate Manager I). \Y. Burbank, '09, for
mer captain, M. M. Mitchell. '10, \V.
P. Fuller, Jr., '10, Captain L. S. Scott,
'10, M.Y. Malone, '10, and G.A. Ditz, '11.
Immediately following the discus
sion by the above speakers H. L. Hor
ton, '08, introduced a motion that, "We
reject unconditionally the ultimatum
of Berkeley." A division was called
I for in the voting upon this question
.with the result that the motion was
J lost by the close vote of 41.1 to 370.
This amounts to the acceptance of the
five year rule advocated by Califor
nia's representatives and means that
athletic relations will continue during
the coming track and baseball seasons.
An athlete under this ruling will be
eligible to compete for five years com
mencing from the date of matricula
tion of the student.
It was moved by H. R. Stolz that a
committee be appointed by President
Shelton for the purpose of compiling
] resolutions to send to California in
j forming them of Stanford's action ,md
explaining the position that Stanford
lias assumed in this matter. Follow
ing is the resolution:
Resolved, That Stanford unqualified
refuse the ultimatum sent, by 'he
University of California. The proposi
tion made by the University of Cali
fornia was, that unless Stanford
agreed to the rule, that no students
should compete in any athletic con
test later than five years from the date
of his matriculation, California would
at once sever all athletic relations
with Stanford. This motion was lost
