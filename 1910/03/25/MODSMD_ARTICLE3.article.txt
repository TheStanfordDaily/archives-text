# MEET SOUTHERN TEAM
## GOOD PERFORMANCE EXPECTED AT TOMORROW'S MEET. Southern Team Contains Stars In Many Events.—J.E. Thompson, '11 a Prominent Quarter-miler. 
### 
By tomorrow evening the followers
of track athletics will be able to com
pare the teams which may represent
the two universities on April l(i. The
result of the Olympia-Cajlifornia
! meet should give a line on the condi
! tion of the Blue and Gold trackmen,
j while the contest with the University
lof Southern California tomorrow
I morning will demonstrate whether the
| wearers of the Cardinal have made
I any improvement during the past few
weeks.
Considering the records of the men
whom the Southern institution is send
ing up, fast time will be the usual
j thing throughout the contest. Al
though neither Captain Scott nor
Trainer Moulton expect Stanford to be
defeated, yet they say the meet will
be too close for comfort and every
Cardinal point-winner pressed for his
I position. The speedy sprinters from
| the south, Martin and Throop, are
liable to make present track records
look cheap, while Captain Lennox will
experience no difficulty in annexing
| both hurdles. A battle royal will oe
seen in the shot-put between Trotter
jof U. S. C. and H. L. Horton. The
southern man is credited with a put of
a foot more than Morton's best mark
this year, but conditions on the Stan
ford oval may be somewhat different
than they were in the south, where
Trotter made his phenomenal heave
of 4f> feet 4 inches.
The U. S. C. entries in the various
events are as follows: Sprints,
Throop and Martin; quarter-mile dash,
Walton and Wallace; half-mile run,
Walton and (lower; mile-run, Hall;
[two-mile run, Wheelan; 120-yard hur
jdles, Lennox and Goodsell; 220-yard
j hurdles, Lennox and Stine; broad
jump, Goodsell and Martjn; high
jjump, Walberg; pole-vault and hatn
nier-throw, Richardson: shot-put.
! Trotter.
All the men training for the Varsity
will be given a chance in tomorrow's
contests, and "Dad" Moulton expects
several surprises to be sprung by new
| men. One of the most promising of
the new candidates, J, E. Thompson.
'11, is on the string of quarter-milers.
This is the first year that Thompson
has trained for the Varsity, but as he
made a great record for himself while
attending preparatory school, "Dad"
expects to develop a good relay man.
Thompson lias plenty of endurance as
he holds the position of assistant yell
leader.
The meet is scheduled to start at
10:30 o'clock but if there is a break in
relations with the University of Cali
fornia it will be held at. 2:30 in the
afternoon. Admission will be »Ift>
cents as usual.
