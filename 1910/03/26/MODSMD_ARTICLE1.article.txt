It is pretty cold for a championship.
The turf, from the rain several hours
ago, is dangerously slippery, and it is
unfortunate, since luck in that case
may play its little part in the contest.

campus at 12:40 and appeared on the
field at 2 o'clock. They as well as
the Cardinal representatives, are re
splendent in new uniforms, white suits
with blue and gold striped jerseys and
stockings make up their color scheme.
The two universities each hold down
a rooting section. Stanford has the
north bleachers, while th° Bin? ard
Gold occupy the east stands. The Cali
fornia band is in the center of their
supporters.
