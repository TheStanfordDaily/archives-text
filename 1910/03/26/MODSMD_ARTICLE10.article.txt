have maintained an administration
which has sanctioned or overlooked
graft. This statement is absolutely
false as will be proven.
The "Sequoia" attempts to prove its
charge of graft by the "Bugs" in the
fact that training table bills have not
been paid. This is an evil which has
existed for over ten years at Stanford
and should be corrected. The fact of
itsexistence and continuance can hard
ly be called "Bug Graft" however, b.\
any one who will take the pains and be
honest enough to enquire into the fi.cts
concerning it. Mr. Miller and Mr.
Leaf have made no attempt to find 'lit
facts. They have deliberately discred
ited men who have paid their bills, in
an effort to boost Mr. Sheiton's ad
ministation, and to discredit Mr. Roth's
administration, for political purpose:,,
they have compared honest men with
San Francisco grafters and told de
liberate lies.
Here are the facts: Judge for your
selves the seriousness, the injustice
which has been deliberately done to
some of the most sincere and honest
men who have ever attended Stanford.
Men who have given much of their
time and thought to the service of tb.>
University and to the securing of a
better business administration in tne
Student Body.
To begin with, Mr. Miller and Mr
Leaf made no attempt, to find out what
men had paid their training table hi "is
after the time when Mr. Burbank .set
tled with Shelton Bros. They never
consulted Burbank or made any effort
to see his training table account. As
a result, we find that of the nine men
who are charged with a failure to pay
for last fall, five have paid their bills.
Included in the men who have paid
are Mr. Morton and Mr. Holman. Mr.
Horton has always paid his training
table bills. When we consider the
fact that Holman, Bellah, and Miller
are not "Bugs", that there are few
"Bugs" in the lists and tnat two
"Mugs", Horton and Roth, have always
paid all such bills, we realize that th.
proposition, that this graft has been
sanctioned for the benefit of "Bugs",
is untenable.
As an instance for disregard for fact,
it. may be well to notice that Mr. Mc-
Gregor, whose name is printed in ital
ics, is E. A. McGregor, the track man.
G. McGregor, whom the author evi
dently intended to list with the "Bugs."
has never eaten on the spring table. It
is charged that Mr. Roth's administra
tion made no effort to secure the pay
ment of training table bills, and that
this sanction of the evil amounted to
graft.
As before stated, this is a false ac
cusation. When Mr. Roth took office,
he took the trouble to talk over the
problem of collecting training tabio
bills wth Dr. Angell and Mr. McDowell.
He estimated that the Student Body
had lost, several thousand dollars and
presented the problem to the Execu
tive Committee. The advisability of
holdng back the sweaters was suggest
ed. It was finally decided tha the plan
of making the men personally liable to
Shelton Bros., and having Shelton
Bros., rather than the manager, col
lect the bills, should lie adopted. This
plan did not prove effective, so the Ex- '
ecutive Committee passed a resolution
that no fobs or medals should be
granted to any man who had not paid |
his training table bill. The simple act i
of looking at the minutes of the Execu- j
tive Committee's meetings would have J
revealed the above fact to the writer, i
With the hope of getting old bills paid, !
iv was also further provided that any!

money which could be collected troiii
old training accounts was to be turned
over to the Crew and Track Trip
Funds. That this plan did help is evi
denced by the fact that all crow mm
paid their bills, and Captain Horlou
succeeded in collecting several old
bills.
The present administration has done
no more than the former along these
lines. Mr. Burbank has been more
strenuous in his efforts, however, to
secure his payments, and yet the Roth
administration, including Mr. Burbank
is branded as a graft administration.
What more conclusive evidence could
be found of a disregard for truth, and
the attempt to do politics, by discredit
ing some men and praising others
B. Rubbing Jobs.
To begin with the whole treatment
of this subject shows an utter disre
gard of facts. Mr. Miller has cleverly
twisted figures in an attempt to show
that certain men have grafted from
the Student Body. The men accused
are most of them athletes, who, like
Mr. Crawford, have sacrificed, for sev
eral years, their own time and chances
of earning money, in order to give
their services to the Student Body
Anyone who lias ever had anything to
do with track knows that it requires a
large number of rubbers, who work
intensively while working, in order
that the men on the teams be not com
pelled to wait until a late nour. Otic
also feels that probably our coaches
have been better qualified than Mr.
Miller on the question of how many
men are required to do the work as it
should be done.
The facts in regard to this question
are as follows:
For many years the rubbers havo
been hired on a basis of a
month, working such houra as the
coaches have thought necessary. At
some parts of the season the work h: -;
been heavier than others and balanc
ing the whole season former Execu
tive Committees have thought that
$15.00 per month was a fair compensa
tion. The vouchers have been mace
out on this basis and not upon the
basis of the number of actual working
hours as Mr. Miller would have you
believe.
The present Executive Committee
thought that the system should be
changed and that the men .should l e
paid at the rate of fifty cents per hour.
It has not yet been seen whether the
new system will save any money 01
not. In fact it now appears that the
money spent for rubbing this year wi".
amount to practically the same as it j
has in former years. The only change i
will therefore lie this; the giving of 1 1: e (
jobs is taken from the hands of th? I
manager and "Dad", and placed in the j
hands of the Executive Committee ,
In this method there will be the same j
chance for politics as in the former, i
so that no appreciatable benefit has '
been derived. The ability of the men
appointed in the past and the fact
that they have been deserving men
cannot be denied.
The argument, that this was a graft
maintained by Roth's administration
and the "Bugs," will hardly hold when
we see that misstatements are the
basis of the whole contention, and that
Mr. Roth, Mr. Wheeler and Mr. Bur
bank last year favored the system
which is now being tried. In fact Mr.
Wheeler made the motion for the
change, feeling that it was unfair to
cast the burden of selection upon
"Dad." The rubbing system and its
change indicates no proof for the
charges made by Mr. Miller.
