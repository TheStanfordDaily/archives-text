# II. Direct Personal Attacks Upon Individuals.

### 
1. Attack Upon "Dad" Mouiton.
Of the many irrelevent facts pre
sented none are more unjustifiable and
inexcusable than the following state
ment: "Anyone who Is at all ac
quainted with conditions knows that
'Dad's* continuance at Stanford de
pends upon his standing in with the
gang." It hardly seems possible that
there should be a man in the Stanford
Student Body who would dare make
such a statement in the face of the
facts. Up to the time "Dad" became
trainer in 1903 Stanford had never
won a track meet from California.
Since he has been coach we have won
four meets and have lost two only.
His success is all the more note
worthy when we remember that his
material has not been as good as that
received by our rival. He has taken
Freshmen teams which have shown,
by their scores, marked inferiority to
Berkeley's team and with four years
of training, has turned them into win
ning Varsities. "Dad's" reputation, for
clean sportsmanship, clean training
rules, and for ability as a coach, Is
national. The "Sequoia" was surely
hard pressed for material for its ar
ticle.
2. Attack I'pon Mr. Kotli and His Ad
ministration.
Mr. Roth's record in this Student
Body is well known. As Student Body
President he gave much time and
thought to the improvement of Student
Body administration. To charge him
with graft is something which would
never occur to anyone except men
who are inspired with unprincipled
political ambition. It is clearly an at
tempt to draw a false contrast between
Mr. Roth's administration and Shel
ton's, with the intention of gaining po
litical strength for the two members of
Leaf's clique, who, throughout the
article, have been held before the
Student Body as the personification of
all those laudable virtfles which are to
be desired in the ideal Student Body
Manager and Student Body Presidenr.
Mr. Roth's administration was "ree
from any sanctioning of graft, but
more than that it accomplished much
positive work. In fact it has alreadv
shown that it began the reforms for
which the present administration has
been so highly praised. The facts al
ready stated and a mention of some <h
the actions taken by the last years
Committee would seem sufficient evi
dence that the charges of a "Bug" ul
ministration having existed for the
purpose of maintaining graft are un
founded.
The action on training table bills has
already been noted. The abolition of
a regular assistant. Graduate Manager
at a salary of $25.00 per month, and
of an official ticket-taker at a salary
of $15.00 per month, are clear in
stances of the efforts made to save
Student Body money. Former Grad
uate Managers had used these posi
tions as political plums. It would
have lieen easy for the Committee to
have allowed their existence to con
tinue and for Mr. Burbank to have
done as former Managers had in the
past.
The assistant-coaching syestem was
discontinued at. a time when a "Bug,"
Mr. Crawford, was the logical heir to
the $1000.00 salary which former Com
mittees had provided for that position.
The incident of Mr. Scott's election
as Track Captain, as related in the
"Sequoia", would on its face be very
circumstantial evidence of politics.
Mr. Miller and Mr. Leaf had been in

formed by disinterested parties chat
there was absolutely no politics in the
incident and that Mr. Roth had gone
out of his way to be honest and square.
They needed material badly and so
proceeded to deliberately misconstrue
this incident in the same manner as
they had every other incident given in
support of their charges.
Mr. Holman and Mr. Scott will both
testify to Mr. Roth's Integrity In this
affair. When the "Sequoia" learned
this it printed the meaningless foot
note in an endeavor to cover Its delib
erate perversion of truth.
Mr. Scott asked Mr. Roth to nomin
ate him for captain. Mr. Roth thought
that Mr. Holman was the man for the
place, and expected to vote for him,
as he has frankly told Mr. Scott. He
told Scott that he would not nominate
him but that he thought it was only
fair that Scott's name should be placed
in nomination, and that he would
speak to Captain Horton about the
system of voting without nominations.
Roth spoke to Horton, who, as Cap
tain, was to conduct the election at rhe
time when the picture was taken.
Horton misunderstood Roth's sugges
tion and called for nominations. Mr.
Roth realizing that there had been a
mistake, felt bound by his promise to
Scott that he would see that his name
came up, although he had not promised
to nominate him, and rose to his feet,
proposing the name of Scott for Track
Captain. Now Mr. Holman is not a
"Bug," but had there been any clique
politics in the affair it is apparent to
everyone that Roth would have kept
his seat, and Hplman, being the only
other nominee, would have been elect
ed.
The Ditz incident has already been
stated. How Mr. Miller and Mr. Leaf
can knowingly misstate these facts end
deliberately attempt to defame Mr.
Roth's character as they have done in
their article, when they personally as
sure him of their faith in his honesty
and sincerity, can not be readily under
stood. The men who have done this in
a University publication while Mr.
Roth is a University officer, working
for the best interests of the students
themselves, are guilty of a serious of
fense.
We can hardly blame Mr. Roth for
continuing bound by the ties of friend
ship to the men who have been broad
enough not to allow differences of
opinion on possible occasions to ef
fect that, friendship, in preference to
going over to men who, while feigning
friendship, have attempted to dis
credit. him in his position. Some men
are broadminded enough not to allow
differences of opinion to interfere with
friendship. Others are so narrow and
puerile that they have evidently mis
construed a failure to actively fall in
line with their own selfish plans of
self-advancement as an attempt to
"play a double game."
The statement concerning Mr. Bur
bank's humorous remark as to his
knowledge of the existence of the
"Bugs" is an attempt to place Mr. Bur
bank in the position of being either a
knave or a fool.
"We might wonder at the statement
made by the present Graduate Man
ager, that he never knew of the ex
istence of any 'Bug' society, that he
had often wondered why some of these
men had supported him so strongly, as
there had never been any particular
bond of friendship between them be
fore, and that if there was such a so
ciety he must be its tool."
The frequent endeavor to connect
him with offenses charged to the
"Bugs", when the "Sequoia" itself ad

inits that llurbank is not a "Bug;", to
gether with the failure to make any
recognition of his good work in ridding
the Student Body of a $2500,00 debt
and giving it a large surplus, con
firms one's belief that the last article
was the effort of political pirates.
When we have examined the articles
several things stand out prominently.
(1) the direct personal attacks for
the purpose of discrediting certain men
and the eulogizing of other men; (2)
the failure of the writers to investi
gate their grounds for believing that
the "Scaraboea" or any other clique
was in control; (3) the utter disregard
for the truth by stating facts which
clearly have no bearing on the issue,
and no significance in proving charges;
(4) the dishonesty in misleading peo
ple that facts exist which do not (That
the "many instances which might be
stated" are not stated even though the
writer had to go to a dangerous ex
treme and use things aside from the is
sue, is good evidence of this dis
honesty.) ; (5) the absolute misstate
ment of many facts; (G) the incon
sistency of the articles themselves
and some of the arguments presented;
(7) the insincerity of the writers and
the editor in attacking men in whom
they themselves confess to have the
utmost faith; (8) the fact that the
men who have supported the"Sequola",
the men who have written the com
munications, the men who have de
fended the authors, and the men eulo
gized by the articles are members of
the same fraternity.
These noticeable features of the ar
ticles together with the political ef
forts, throughout this year, of the
men behind the articles have led us to
believe, as we stated at the beginning
of our reply, that the "Sequoia's" ob
ject in waging the campaign was pure
ly political. We believe that when all
the facts are considered our inference
has been a logical one. The "Se
quoia's" contention that its motives are
solely those of reformers and in line
with the best interests of Stanford are
hardly reconcilable with the nature of
the last article. The cloak of reform
must fit illy on the shoulders of men
who are guilty of the greatest crime
of Stanford Journalism.
The editor of the "Sequoia", in refer
ring to the "Bugs" has said, "We fee!
that the chain of evidence is complete.
Men have been hanged for murder on
a chain of evidence not nearly so com
plete." We would remind the accus
ers that men have received harsh
treatment at the hands of their fellow
men and by legal process for articles
much less libelous and false than the
ones which have appeared in the
"Sequoia."
The fact, that the men wrongly ac
cused and pictured to the public as
grafters, have made little reply and
have taken the results calmly, is the
best evidence of their faith in the Stu
dent Body's ability to finally arrive at
the real facts and vindicate this so
ciety and individuals attacked.
Throughout this entire controversy
we have refrained from giving our list
of membership. We have ielt that un
less our existence can be shown to be
detrimental to the best interests of the
University, our purposes and member
ship are as much our own affair as
they are in any secret organization.
The "Sequoia" has failed to prove that
our purposes or motives can be im
pugned. Many prominent members,
including Mr. Roth, freely admitted
membership to members of the Faculty
and to students from the time the first
artircle was printed. It is little won
der that they have refused to admit

membership to Mr. Leaf under the
circumstances. He had stated that he
had all the facts and figures to support
his charges. Surely the membership of
the organization was the most funda
mental fact. That, he did not have the
facts has become apparent. Can the
"Bug" be blamed for not assisting
Leaf in his frantic efforts to secure
the names of enough to enable him to
construct a fabrication of circum
stances which might support his
charges.
Under the circumstances we, as an
organization, do not feel called upon
to reveal our purposes or to give a list
of membership. Mr. Miller's con
tention that a refusal to give a list of
of membership is proof of the repre
hensible character of the society, is in
no wise tenable in view of the facts
that the membership of the organiza
tion openly wear their pins. The
character of- the men who have admit
ted membership is further proof that
the organization is not a boozing so
ciety, and that it does not stand for
ideals or principles which are subver
sive to the best interests of Stanford
University.

men who have supported the"Sequola",
the men who have written the com
munications, the men who have de
fended the authors, and the men eulo
gized by the articles are members of
the same fraternity.
These noticeable features of the ar
ticles together with the political ef
forts, throughout this year, of the
men behind the articles have led us to
believe, as we stated at the beginning
of our reply, that the "Sequoia's" ob

the facts are considered our inference
has been a logical one. The "Se

solely those of reformers and in line
with the best interests of Stanford are
hardly reconcilable with the nature of
the last article. The cloak of reform
must fit illy on the shoulders of men
who are guilty of the greatest crime
of Stanford Journalism.
The editor of the "Sequoia", in refer
ring to the "Bugs" has said, "We fee!
that the chain of evidence is complete.
Men have been hanged for murder on
a chain of evidence not nearly so com
plete." We would remind the accus
ers that men have received harsh
treatment at the hands of their fellow
men and by legal process for articles
much less libelous and false than the
ones which have appeared in the
"Sequoia."
The fact, that the men wrongly ac
cused and pictured to the public as
grafters, have made little reply and
have taken the results calmly, is the
best evidence of their faith in the Stu
dent Body's ability to finally arrive at
the real facts and vindicate this so
ciety and individuals attacked.
Throughout this entire controversy
we have refrained from giving our list
of membership. We have ielt that un
less our existence can be shown to be
detrimental to the best interests of the
University, our purposes and member
ship are as much our own affair as
they are in any secret organization.
The "Sequoia" has failed to prove that
our purposes or motives can be im
pugned. Many prominent members,
including Mr. Roth, freely admitted
membership to members of the Faculty
and to students from the time the first
artircle was printed. It is little won
der that they have refused to admit

membership to Mr. Leaf under the
circumstances. He had stated that he
had all the facts and figures to support
his charges. Surely the membership of

facts has become apparent. Can the
"Bug" be blamed for not assisting
Leaf in his frantic efforts to secure
the names of enough to enable him to
construct a fabrication of circum
stances which might support his
charges.
Under the circumstances we, as an
organization, do not feel called upon
to reveal our purposes or to give a list
of membership. Mr. Miller's con
tention that a refusal to give a list of
of membership is proof of the repre
hensible character of the society, is in
no wise tenable in view of the facts
that the membership of the organiza

1. Attack Upon "Dad" Mouiton.
Of the many irrelevent facts pre
sented none are more unjustifiable and
inexcusable than the following state
ment: "Anyone who Is at all ac
quainted with conditions knows that
'Dad's* continuance at Stanford de
pends upon his standing in with the
gang." It hardly seems possible that
there should be a man in the Stanford
Student Body who would dare make
such a statement in the face of the
facts. Up to the time "Dad" became
trainer in 1903 Stanford had never
won a track meet from California.
Since he has been coach we have won
four meets and have lost two only.
His success is all the more note
worthy when we remember that his
material has not been as good as that
received by our rival. He has taken
Freshmen teams which have shown,
by their scores, marked inferiority to
Berkeley's team and with four years
of training, has turned them into win
ning Varsities. "Dad's" reputation, for
clean sportsmanship, clean training
rules, and for ability as a coach, Is
national. The "Sequoia" was surely
hard pressed for material for its ar
ticle.
2. Attack I'pon Mr. Kotli and His Ad
ministration.
Mr. Roth's record in this Student
Body is well known. As Student Body
President he gave much time and
thought to the improvement of Student
Body administration. To charge him
with graft is something which would
never occur to anyone except men
who are inspired with unprincipled
political ambition. It is clearly an at
tempt to draw a false contrast between
Mr. Roth's administration and Shel
ton's, with the intention of gaining po
litical strength for the two members of
Leaf's clique, who, throughout the
article, have been held before the
Student Body as the personification of
all those laudable virtfles which are to
be desired in the ideal Student Body
Manager and Student Body Presidenr.
Mr. Roth's administration was "ree
from any sanctioning of graft, but
more than that it accomplished much
positive work. In fact it has alreadv
shown that it began the reforms for
which the present administration has
been so highly praised. The facts al
ready stated and a mention of some <h
the actions taken by the last years
Committee would seem sufficient evi
dence that the charges of a "Bug" ul
ministration having existed for the
purpose of maintaining graft are un
founded.
The action on training table bills has
already been noted. The abolition of
a regular assistant. Graduate Manager
at a salary of $25.00 per month, and
of an official ticket-taker at a salary
of $15.00 per month, are clear in
stances of the efforts made to save
Student Body money. Former Grad
uate Managers had used these posi
tions as political plums. It would
have lieen easy for the Committee to
have allowed their existence to con
tinue and for Mr. Burbank to have
done as former Managers had in the
past.
The assistant-coaching syestem was
discontinued at. a time when a "Bug,"
Mr. Crawford, was the logical heir to
the $1000.00 salary which former Com
mittees had provided for that position.
The incident of Mr. Scott's election
as Track Captain, as related in the
"Sequoia", would on its face be very
circumstantial evidence of politics.
Mr. Miller and Mr. Leaf had been in

formed by disinterested parties chat
there was absolutely no politics in the
incident and that Mr. Roth had gone
out of his way to be honest and square.
They needed material badly and so
proceeded to deliberately misconstrue
this incident in the same manner as
they had every other incident given in
support of their charges.
Mr. Holman and Mr. Scott will both
testify to Mr. Roth's Integrity In this
affair. When the "Sequoia" learned
this it printed the meaningless foot
note in an endeavor to cover Its delib
erate perversion of truth.
Mr. Scott asked Mr. Roth to nomin
ate him for captain. Mr. Roth thought
that Mr. Holman was the man for the
place, and expected to vote for him,
as he has frankly told Mr. Scott. He
told Scott that he would not nominate
him but that he thought it was only
fair that Scott's name should be placed
in nomination, and that he would
speak to Captain Horton about the
system of voting without nominations.
Roth spoke to Horton, who, as Cap
tain, was to conduct the election at rhe
time when the picture was taken.
Horton misunderstood Roth's sugges
tion and called for nominations. Mr.
Roth realizing that there had been a
mistake, felt bound by his promise to
Scott that he would see that his name
came up, although he had not promised
to nominate him, and rose to his feet,
proposing the name of Scott for Track
Captain. Now Mr. Holman is not a
"Bug," but had there been any clique
politics in the affair it is apparent to
everyone that Roth would have kept
his seat, and Hplman, being the only
other nominee, would have been elect
ed.
The Ditz incident has already been
stated. How Mr. Miller and Mr. Leaf
can knowingly misstate these facts end
deliberately attempt to defame Mr.
Roth's character as they have done in
their article, when they personally as
sure him of their faith in his honesty
and sincerity, can not be readily under
stood. The men who have done this in
a University publication while Mr.
Roth is a University officer, working
for the best interests of the students
themselves, are guilty of a serious of
fense.
We can hardly blame Mr. Roth for
continuing bound by the ties of friend
ship to the men who have been broad
enough not to allow differences of
opinion on possible occasions to ef
fect that, friendship, in preference to
going over to men who, while feigning
friendship, have attempted to dis
credit. him in his position. Some men
are broadminded enough not to allow
differences of opinion to interfere with
friendship. Others are so narrow and
puerile that they have evidently mis
construed a failure to actively fall in
line with their own selfish plans of
self-advancement as an attempt to
"play a double game."
The statement concerning Mr. Bur
bank's humorous remark as to his
knowledge of the existence of the
"Bugs" is an attempt to place Mr. Bur
bank in the position of being either a
knave or a fool.
"We might wonder at the statement
made by the present Graduate Man
ager, that he never knew of the ex
istence of any 'Bug' society, that he
had often wondered why some of these
men had supported him so strongly, as
there had never been any particular
bond of friendship between them be
fore, and that if there was such a so
ciety he must be its tool."
The frequent endeavor to connect
him with offenses charged to the
"Bugs", when the "Sequoia" itself ad

inits that llurbank is not a "Bug;", to
gether with the failure to make any
recognition of his good work in ridding
the Student Body of a $2500,00 debt
and giving it a large surplus, con
firms one's belief that the last article
was the effort of political pirates.
When we have examined the articles
several things stand out prominently.
(1) the direct personal attacks for
the purpose of discrediting certain men
and the eulogizing of other men; (2)
the failure of the writers to investi
gate their grounds for believing that
the "Scaraboea" or any other clique
was in control; (3) the utter disregard
for the truth by stating facts which
clearly have no bearing on the issue,
and no significance in proving charges;
(4) the dishonesty in misleading peo
ple that facts exist which do not (That
the "many instances which might be
stated" are not stated even though the
writer had to go to a dangerous ex
treme and use things aside from the is
sue, is good evidence of this dis
honesty.) ; (5) the absolute misstate
ment of many facts; (G) the incon
sistency of the articles themselves
and some of the arguments presented;
(7) the insincerity of the writers and
the editor in attacking men in whom
they themselves confess to have the
utmost faith; (8) the fact that the
men who have supported the"Sequola",
the men who have written the com

Captain. Now Mr. Holman is not a
"Bug," but had there been any clique
politics in the affair it is apparent to
everyone that Roth would have kept
his seat, and Hplman, being the only
other nominee, would have been elect
ed.
The Ditz incident has already been
stated. How Mr. Miller and Mr. Leaf
can knowingly misstate these facts end
deliberately attempt to defame Mr.
Roth's character as they have done in
their article, when they personally as
sure him of their faith in his honesty
and sincerity, can not be readily under
stood. The men who have done this in
a University publication while Mr.
Roth is a University officer, working
for the best interests of the students
themselves, are guilty of a serious of
fense.
We can hardly blame Mr. Roth for
continuing bound by the ties of friend
ship to the men who have been broad
enough not to allow differences of
opinion on possible occasions to ef
fect that, friendship, in preference to
going over to men who, while feigning
friendship, have attempted to dis

are broadminded enough not to allow
differences of opinion to interfere with
friendship. Others are so narrow and
puerile that they have evidently mis
construed a failure to actively fall in
line with their own selfish plans of
self-advancement as an attempt to
"play a double game."
The statement concerning Mr. Bur
bank's humorous remark as to his
knowledge of the existence of the
"Bugs" is an attempt to place Mr. Bur
bank in the position of being either a
knave or a fool.
"We might wonder at the statement
made by the present Graduate Man
ager, that he never knew of the ex
istence of any 'Bug' society, that he
had often wondered why some of these
men had supported him so strongly, as
there had never been any particular
bond of friendship between them be
fore, and that if there was such a so
ciety he must be its tool."
The frequent endeavor to connect
him with offenses charged to the
"Bugs", when the "Sequoia" itself ad

inits that llurbank is not a "Bug;", to
gether with the failure to make any
recognition of his good work in ridding
the Student Body of a $2500,00 debt
and giving it a large surplus, con
firms one's belief that the last article
was the effort of political pirates.
When we have examined the articles
several things stand out prominently.
(1) the direct personal attacks for
the purpose of discrediting certain men
and the eulogizing of other men; (2)
the failure of the writers to investi
gate their grounds for believing that
the "Scaraboea" or any other clique
was in control; (3) the utter disregard
for the truth by stating facts which
clearly have no bearing on the issue,
and no significance in proving charges;
(4) the dishonesty in misleading peo
ple that facts exist which do not (That
the "many instances which might be
stated" are not stated even though the
writer had to go to a dangerous ex
treme and use things aside from the is
sue, is good evidence of this dis
honesty.) ; (5) the absolute misstate
ment of many facts; (G) the incon
sistency of the articles themselves
and some of the arguments presented;
(7) the insincerity of the writers and
the editor in attacking men in whom
they themselves confess to have the
utmost faith; (8) the fact that the
men who have supported the"Sequola",
the men who have written the com
munications, the men who have de
fended the authors, and the men eulo
gized by the articles are members of
the same fraternity.
These noticeable features of the ar
ticles together with the political ef
forts, throughout this year, of the
men behind the articles have led us to
believe, as we stated at the beginning
of our reply, that the "Sequoia's" ob
ject in waging the campaign was pure
ly political. We believe that when all
the facts are considered our inference
has been a logical one. The "Se
quoia's" contention that its motives are
solely those of reformers and in line
with the best interests of Stanford are
hardly reconcilable with the nature of
the last article. The cloak of reform
must fit illy on the shoulders of men
who are guilty of the greatest crime
of Stanford Journalism.
The editor of the "Sequoia", in refer
ring to the "Bugs" has said, "We fee!
that the chain of evidence is complete.
Men have been hanged for murder on
a chain of evidence not nearly so com
plete." We would remind the accus
ers that men have received harsh
treatment at the hands of their fellow
men and by legal process for articles
much less libelous and false than the
ones which have appeared in the
"Sequoia."
The fact, that the men wrongly ac
cused and pictured to the public as
grafters, have made little reply and
have taken the results calmly, is the
best evidence of their faith in the Stu
dent Body's ability to finally arrive at
the real facts and vindicate this so
ciety and individuals attacked.
Throughout this entire controversy
we have refrained from giving our list
of membership. We have ielt that un
less our existence can be shown to be
detrimental to the best interests of the
University, our purposes and member
ship are as much our own affair as
they are in any secret organization.
The "Sequoia" has failed to prove that
our purposes or motives can be im
pugned. Many prominent members,
including Mr. Roth, freely admitted
membership to members of the Faculty
and to students from the time the first
artircle was printed. It is little won
der that they have refused to admit

membership to Mr. Leaf under the
circumstances. He had stated that he

"Bug" be blamed for not assisting

Under the circumstances we, as an
organization, do not feel called upon
to reveal our purposes or to give a list
of membership. Mr. Miller's con

Of the many irrelevent facts pre
sented none are more unjustifiable and
inexcusable than the following state

'Dad's* continuance at Stanford de

there should be a man in the Stanford
Student Body who would dare make
such a statement in the face of the
facts. Up to the time "Dad" became
trainer in 1903 Stanford had never
won a track meet from California.
Since he has been coach we have won
four meets and have lost two only.
His success is all the more note
worthy when we remember that his
material has not been as good as that
received by our rival. He has taken
Freshmen teams which have shown,
by their scores, marked inferiority to
Berkeley's team and with four years
of training, has turned them into win

clean sportsmanship, clean training

hard pressed for material for its ar

2. Attack I'pon Mr. Kotli and His Ad
ministration.
Mr. Roth's record in this Student
Body is well known. As Student Body
President he gave much time and
thought to the improvement of Student
Body administration. To charge him
with graft is something which would
never occur to anyone except men
who are inspired with unprincipled
political ambition. It is clearly an at
tempt to draw a false contrast between
Mr. Roth's administration and Shel
ton's, with the intention of gaining po
litical strength for the two members of
Leaf's clique, who, throughout the
article, have been held before the
Student Body as the personification of
all those laudable virtfles which are to
be desired in the ideal Student Body
Manager and Student Body Presidenr.
Mr. Roth's administration was "ree
from any sanctioning of graft, but
more than that it accomplished much
positive work. In fact it has alreadv
shown that it began the reforms for
which the present administration has
been so highly praised. The facts al
ready stated and a mention of some <h
the actions taken by the last years
Committee would seem sufficient evi
dence that the charges of a "Bug" ul
ministration having existed for the
purpose of maintaining graft are un
founded.
The action on training table bills has
already been noted. The abolition of
a regular assistant. Graduate Manager
at a salary of $25.00 per month, and
of an official ticket-taker at a salary
of $15.00 per month, are clear in
stances of the efforts made to save
Student Body money. Former Grad
uate Managers had used these posi
tions as political plums. It would
have lieen easy for the Committee to
have allowed their existence to con
tinue and for Mr. Burbank to have
done as former Managers had in the
past.
The assistant-coaching syestem was
discontinued at. a time when a "Bug,"
Mr. Crawford, was the logical heir to
the $1000.00 salary which former Com
mittees had provided for that position.
The incident of Mr. Scott's election
as Track Captain, as related in the
"Sequoia", would on its face be very
circumstantial evidence of politics.
Mr. Miller and Mr. Leaf had been in

formed by disinterested parties chat
there was absolutely no politics in the
incident and that Mr. Roth had gone
out of his way to be honest and square.
They needed material badly and so
proceeded to deliberately misconstrue
this incident in the same manner as
they had every other incident given in
support of their charges.
Mr. Holman and Mr. Scott will both
testify to Mr. Roth's Integrity In this
affair. When the "Sequoia" learned
this it printed the meaningless foot
note in an endeavor to cover Its delib
erate perversion of truth.
Mr. Scott asked Mr. Roth to nomin
ate him for captain. Mr. Roth thought
that Mr. Holman was the man for the
place, and expected to vote for him,
as he has frankly told Mr. Scott. He
told Scott that he would not nominate
him but that he thought it was only
fair that Scott's name should be placed
in nomination, and that he would
speak to Captain Horton about the
system of voting without nominations.
Roth spoke to Horton, who, as Cap
tain, was to conduct the election at rhe
time when the picture was taken.
Horton misunderstood Roth's sugges
tion and called for nominations. Mr.
Roth realizing that there had been a
mistake, felt bound by his promise to
Scott that he would see that his name
came up, although he had not promised
to nominate him, and rose to his feet,
proposing the name of Scott for Track
Captain. Now Mr. Holman is not a
"Bug," but had there been any clique
politics in the affair it is apparent to
everyone that Roth would have kept
his seat, and Hplman, being the only
other nominee, would have been elect

Body administration. To charge him
with graft is something which would
never occur to anyone except men
who are inspired with unprincipled
political ambition. It is clearly an at
tempt to draw a false contrast between
Mr. Roth's administration and Shel
ton's, with the intention of gaining po
litical strength for the two members of
Leaf's clique, who, throughout the
article, have been held before the
Student Body as the personification of
all those laudable virtfles which are to
be desired in the ideal Student Body
Manager and Student Body Presidenr.
Mr. Roth's administration was "ree
from any sanctioning of graft, but
more than that it accomplished much
positive work. In fact it has alreadv
shown that it began the reforms for
which the present administration has
been so highly praised. The facts al
ready stated and a mention of some <h
the actions taken by the last years
Committee would seem sufficient evi
dence that the charges of a "Bug" ul
ministration having existed for the
purpose of maintaining graft are un
founded.
The action on training table bills has
already been noted. The abolition of
a regular assistant. Graduate Manager
at a salary of $25.00 per month, and
of an official ticket-taker at a salary
of $15.00 per month, are clear in
stances of the efforts made to save
Student Body money. Former Grad
uate Managers had used these posi
tions as political plums. It would
have lieen easy for the Committee to
have allowed their existence to con
tinue and for Mr. Burbank to have
done as former Managers had in the
past.
The assistant-coaching syestem was
discontinued at. a time when a "Bug,"
Mr. Crawford, was the logical heir to
the $1000.00 salary which former Com
mittees had provided for that position.
The incident of Mr. Scott's election
as Track Captain, as related in the
"Sequoia", would on its face be very
circumstantial evidence of politics.
Mr. Miller and Mr. Leaf had been in

formed by disinterested parties chat
there was absolutely no politics in the
incident and that Mr. Roth had gone
out of his way to be honest and square.
They needed material badly and so
proceeded to deliberately misconstrue
this incident in the same manner as
they had every other incident given in
support of their charges.
Mr. Holman and Mr. Scott will both
testify to Mr. Roth's Integrity In this
affair. When the "Sequoia" learned
this it printed the meaningless foot
note in an endeavor to cover Its delib
erate perversion of truth.
Mr. Scott asked Mr. Roth to nomin
ate him for captain. Mr. Roth thought
that Mr. Holman was the man for the
place, and expected to vote for him,
as he has frankly told Mr. Scott. He
told Scott that he would not nominate
him but that he thought it was only
fair that Scott's name should be placed
in nomination, and that he would
speak to Captain Horton about the
system of voting without nominations.
Roth spoke to Horton, who, as Cap
tain, was to conduct the election at rhe
time when the picture was taken.
Horton misunderstood Roth's sugges
tion and called for nominations. Mr.
Roth realizing that there had been a
mistake, felt bound by his promise to
Scott that he would see that his name
came up, although he had not promised
to nominate him, and rose to his feet,
proposing the name of Scott for Track
Captain. Now Mr. Holman is not a
"Bug," but had there been any clique
politics in the affair it is apparent to
everyone that Roth would have kept
his seat, and Hplman, being the only
other nominee, would have been elect
ed.
The Ditz incident has already been
stated. How Mr. Miller and Mr. Leaf
can knowingly misstate these facts end
deliberately attempt to defame Mr.
Roth's character as they have done in
their article, when they personally as
sure him of their faith in his honesty
and sincerity, can not be readily under
stood. The men who have done this in
a University publication while Mr.
Roth is a University officer, working
for the best interests of the students
themselves, are guilty of a serious of
fense.
We can hardly blame Mr. Roth for
continuing bound by the ties of friend
ship to the men who have been broad
enough not to allow differences of
opinion on possible occasions to ef
fect that, friendship, in preference to
going over to men who, while feigning
friendship, have attempted to dis
credit. him in his position. Some men
are broadminded enough not to allow
differences of opinion to interfere with
friendship. Others are so narrow and
puerile that they have evidently mis
construed a failure to actively fall in
line with their own selfish plans of
self-advancement as an attempt to
"play a double game."
The statement concerning Mr. Bur
bank's humorous remark as to his
knowledge of the existence of the
"Bugs" is an attempt to place Mr. Bur
bank in the position of being either a
knave or a fool.
"We might wonder at the statement
made by the present Graduate Man
ager, that he never knew of the ex
istence of any 'Bug' society, that he
had often wondered why some of these
men had supported him so strongly, as
there had never been any particular
bond of friendship between them be
fore, and that if there was such a so
ciety he must be its tool."
The frequent endeavor to connect
him with offenses charged to the
"Bugs", when the "Sequoia" itself ad

inits that llurbank is not a "Bug;", to
gether with the failure to make any
recognition of his good work in ridding
the Student Body of a $2500,00 debt
and giving it a large surplus, con
firms one's belief that the last article
was the effort of political pirates.
When we have examined the articles
several things stand out prominently.
(1) the direct personal attacks for
the purpose of discrediting certain men
and the eulogizing of other men; (2)
the failure of the writers to investi
gate their grounds for believing that
the "Scaraboea" or any other clique
was in control; (3) the utter disregard
for the truth by stating facts which
clearly have no bearing on the issue,
and no significance in proving charges;
(4) the dishonesty in misleading peo
ple that facts exist which do not (That
the "many instances which might be
stated" are not stated even though the
writer had to go to a dangerous ex
treme and use things aside from the is
sue, is good evidence of this dis
honesty.) ; (5) the absolute misstate
ment of many facts; (G) the incon
sistency of the articles themselves
and some of the arguments presented;
(7) the insincerity of the writers and
the editor in attacking men in whom
they themselves confess to have the
utmost faith; (8) the fact that the
men who have supported the"Sequola",
the men who have written the com
munications, the men who have de
fended the authors, and the men eulo
gized by the articles are members of
the same fraternity.
These noticeable features of the ar
ticles together with the political ef
forts, throughout this year, of the
men behind the articles have led us to
believe, as we stated at the beginning
of our reply, that the "Sequoia's" ob
ject in waging the campaign was pure
ly political. We believe that when all
the facts are considered our inference
has been a logical one. The "Se
quoia's" contention that its motives are
solely those of reformers and in line
with the best interests of Stanford are
hardly reconcilable with the nature of
the last article. The cloak of reform
must fit illy on the shoulders of men
who are guilty of the greatest crime
of Stanford Journalism.
The editor of the "Sequoia", in refer
ring to the "Bugs" has said, "We fee!
that the chain of evidence is complete.
Men have been hanged for murder on
a chain of evidence not nearly so com
plete." We would remind the accus
ers that men have received harsh
treatment at the hands of their fellow
men and by legal process for articles
much less libelous and false than the
ones which have appeared in the
"Sequoia."
The fact, that the men wrongly ac
cused and pictured to the public as
grafters, have made little reply and
have taken the results calmly, is the
best evidence of their faith in the Stu
dent Body's ability to finally arrive at
the real facts and vindicate this so
ciety and individuals attacked.
Throughout this entire controversy
we have refrained from giving our list
of membership. We have ielt that un
less our existence can be shown to be
detrimental to the best interests of the
University, our purposes and member
ship are as much our own affair as
they are in any secret organization.
The "Sequoia" has failed to prove that
our purposes or motives can be im
pugned. Many prominent members,
including Mr. Roth, freely admitted
membership to members of the Faculty
and to students from the time the first
artircle was printed. It is little won
der that they have refused to admit

membership to Mr. Leaf under the
circumstances. He had stated that he
had all the facts and figures to support
his charges. Surely the membership of
the organization was the most funda
mental fact. That, he did not have the
facts has become apparent. Can the
"Bug" be blamed for not assisting
Leaf in his frantic efforts to secure
the names of enough to enable him to
construct a fabrication of circum
stances which might support his
charges.
Under the circumstances we, as an
organization, do not feel called upon
to reveal our purposes or to give a list
of membership. Mr. Miller's con
tention that a refusal to give a list of
of membership is proof of the repre
hensible character of the society, is in
no wise tenable in view of the facts
that the membership of the organiza
tion openly wear their pins. The
character of- the men who have admit
ted membership is further proof that
the organization is not a boozing so
ciety, and that it does not stand for
ideals or principles which are subver
sive to the best interests of Stanford
University.

1. Attack Upon "Dad" Mouiton.
Of the many irrelevent facts pre
sented none are more unjustifiable and
inexcusable than the following state
ment: "Anyone who Is at all ac
quainted with conditions knows that
'Dad's* continuance at Stanford de
pends upon his standing in with the
gang." It hardly seems possible that
there should be a man in the Stanford
Student Body who would dare make
such a statement in the face of the
facts. Up to the time "Dad" became
trainer in 1903 Stanford had never
won a track meet from California.
Since he has been coach we have won
four meets and have lost two only.
His success is all the more note
worthy when we remember that his
material has not been as good as that
received by our rival. He has taken
Freshmen teams which have shown,
by their scores, marked inferiority to
Berkeley's team and with four years
of training, has turned them into win
ning Varsities. "Dad's" reputation, for
clean sportsmanship, clean training
rules, and for ability as a coach, Is
national. The "Sequoia" was surely
hard pressed for material for its ar

cused and pictured to the public as
grafters, have made little reply and
have taken the results calmly, is the
best evidence of their faith in the Stu
dent Body's ability to finally arrive at
the real facts and vindicate this so
ciety and individuals attacked.
Throughout this entire controversy
we have refrained from giving our list
of membership. We have ielt that un
less our existence can be shown to be
detrimental to the best interests of the
University, our purposes and member
ship are as much our own affair as
they are in any secret organization.
The "Sequoia" has failed to prove that
our purposes or motives can be im
pugned. Many prominent members,
including Mr. Roth, freely admitted
membership to members of the Faculty
and to students from the time the first
artircle was printed. It is little won
der that they have refused to admit

membership to Mr. Leaf under the
circumstances. He had stated that he
had all the facts and figures to support
his charges. Surely the membership of
the organization was the most funda
mental fact. That, he did not have the
facts has become apparent. Can the
"Bug" be blamed for not assisting
Leaf in his frantic efforts to secure
the names of enough to enable him to
construct a fabrication of circum
stances which might support his
charges.
Under the circumstances we, as an
organization, do not feel called upon
to reveal our purposes or to give a list
of membership. Mr. Miller's con
tention that a refusal to give a list of
of membership is proof of the repre
hensible character of the society, is in
no wise tenable in view of the facts
that the membership of the organiza
tion openly wear their pins. The
character of- the men who have admit
ted membership is further proof that
the organization is not a boozing so
ciety, and that it does not stand for
ideals or principles which are subver
sive to the best interests of Stanford
University.
