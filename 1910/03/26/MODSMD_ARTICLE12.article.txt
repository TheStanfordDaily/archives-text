# U.S.C. LOSES ON TRACK
## MEET WITH VARSITY ENDS IN SCORE OF 93 TO 29. Cold Weather and Wind Prevent Record Performances.—Johnston Runs Fast Half. 
### 
The Stanford track team easily
downed the game little group of ath
letes from U. S. C. this morning 011 the
oval by the score of 93-29. The smaller
university men have a nifty aggrega
tion, but were unable to withstand the
superior numbers and average better
performances of the bigger Varsity.
The southern team was also slightly
crippled by having several good men
on the injured list, whose work would
have helped them out somewhat in the
final reckoning.
The wind and cold weather marred
the hopes of those who looked for
record exhibitions here and there in
the events. There was no brilliant
work today. The Stanford athletes
went their way in the usual strong
fashion, and showed another proof of
their worth. Throop, the U. S. C.
Mercury, had the wind against him
and could not make any breath-taking
time. Coleman made it decidedly in
teresting for him in both races. The
century, which was the southern
sprinter's main stronghold, was won
by only eight or a dozen inches. Smith
erum was also close up 011 the finish.
The 220 seemed for (he last twenty
yards to be going to Coleman, but
Throop maintained his speed at. the
same time (hat Coleman brought out
his greatest effort, and the five points
were put out of reach of the Cardinal.
The middle distances had their turn
also. A. Johnston recalled the days of
John O. Miller, when he made the half
mile round in 2 minutes, 3-5 seconds.
It is true that he did not stake out his
claim on the south side of the two
minute mark, but nevertheless it is
mighty consistent improvement over
his work in each succeeding meet of
the past season. Leaman came in also
for a good third place, and he looms
up still higher as a possibility in the
big meet three weeks from today.
Walton, for U. S. C., made a splendid
spurt but could not get ahead of the
Stanford runner.
The Cardinal men fell down a little
in the two-mile, but here again there
are outside influences to be accounted
for. The twin Stanford leaders in the
race were not pushed by opponents,
and had only themselves to do the urg
ing in the spurts. They ran evenly,
however, but Templeton had stored
up his streng(h better for the finish
and passed Newman 011 the back
stretch. Wheelan, the southern Var
sity racer, could not take his place j
among the starters in the long grind.
He is on the repair list with a bad
foot. He is recorded with almost
record time in the southland a week
ago, and it is probable that the Cardi
nal two-milers would have had to show
a good part of what was in them to
win today.
Crawford turned the tables on Trot
ter in the shot after the Los Angeles
weight man had beaten him two weeks
ago on the visit which the Varsity
made to the U. S. C. track. Crawford
went 44 feet, 6% inches this morning.
Crawford also captured the hammer,
but not by any noteworthy throwing.
Twelve feet was not reached in the
pole vault, but the big thing to note
here is that "Sam" Bellah, the old
veteran, is coming back to his old
form. While not making the dozen
feet, yet he came very close to it,

within a half-inch, in fact. This
simply goes to show how sure the Car
dinal is of having two men go twelve
feet or over in the struggle with Cali
fornia. Captain Scott did not attempt
any thrilling tries for a record. He
and Richardson of U. S. C., tied for
second place, doing only 11 feet, 6Vfc
inches. It was not (he kind of a day to
record a new world's record or any
performance of (hat nature.
The five Stanford racers took (he re
lay handily in the red-letter time of
3:21. The running was pretty, and U
S. C. was far in the rear.
Smitherum, the deserving little run
ner for the Cardinal, injured a muscle
in his right leg on the tsart, of the 220-
yard dash this morning. "Dad" is
not at all sanguine about his chances
of recovering, but promises that he will
have (he best of care from a physician.
