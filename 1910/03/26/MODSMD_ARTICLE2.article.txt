# SCARABOEA CONDEMNS "SEQUOIA"
## Society Issues Detailed Refutation of Many Charges Preferred by R.J. Miller and E.M. Leaf In the Stanford Magazine. 
### 
Certain mistatements of facts
have been made in recent issues
of the "Sequoia." The object of this
article is to acquaint the members of
the Student Body with these per
versions of truth and to show the
purpose of the author's muckraking
campaign.
To begin with, it must be apparent
to everyone that Mr. Miller and Mr.
Leaf have made out no case against
the "Bugs" society. They have in
dulged in an inexcusable personal at
tack upon four or five individuals in
an attempt to free themselves from
the difficult position which they them
selves chose to assume. By this pro
cedure they have hoped to further
political interests of their own clique
which is the only one which has been
doing politics during the last two
years.
First let us examine the inconsist
ency of the "Sequoia's" statements
concerning its own position and tin'
purpose of the article written.
The first, article was clearly an at
tack upon the so-called "Bug" societv,
notwithstanding the Editor's state
ment in the last issue. From the last
issue of the "Sequoia" we quote the
following extract from the last ar
ticle: "....our purpose is not to con
vict either organization or individual,
but to acquaint the Student Body wil.'i
existing conditions...."
That the first article was however a
direct attack upon an organization is
best evidenced by the following quota
tions from Mr. Leaf. We quote fron
the editorial of the January issue of
the current year: "We believe it can
not be gainsaid that the very existence
of such an organization is subversive
of the best interests of this Student
Body." We quote again, "The fact
that the Scariboea society has ap
parently reached this stage of develop
ment, makes it a constant menace to
the Student Body." Quoting again
from the same editorial, " we
strongly believe that the best interests
of Stanford demand that this organiza
tion should be suppressed."
The charges were so serious that the
Student Body demanded that Mr. Leaf
produce facts to prove them. In a
public statement in the Daily Palo
Alto Mr. Leaf promised to submit his
proofs. But upon looking over his
material he soon learned that his ac
cusation was false. In gathering their
material Mr. Leaf and Mr. Miller had
overlooked the fact that it was quite
essential to know the membership of
the "Bug" society. They found tliat
they were reasonably sure of only five
or six men whom they had placed or>
their original list of twenty or more
members. They discovered that many
men whom they had implicated in
their charges were not "Bugs." They
also learned that many of the instan
ces upon which their conclusions were
based gave no evidence of political

manipulation. The question which
confronted Miller and Leaf was, "How
can we prove our charges without
facts, and when we do not even know
who the "Bugs" are?" Realizing the
impossibility of the situation, they
looked about them for an avenue of
escape from their own trap.
Close friends of Mr. Miller urged
Mr. Roth to save Mr. Miller from fu>
ther contempt and disgrace, ft was
suggested that this be done by a refu
tation of the charges or by an explana
tion of the character of the "Bug'
society. Mr. Leaf went to Mr. Roth
and asked him to make some reply for
the "Bugs" in the "Sequoia." Mr.
Roth informed Mr. Leaf that he d : d
not see how any reply was calle.'
for.and that knowing as he did that,
the charges were absolutely ground
less, he believed that the "Bugs" need
say nothing.
It, is now evident that no one was
willing to come forward and assist
the writers to escape from their diffi
cult position. Being convinced of their
own folly they prepared their ridicu
lous "crawl" which appeared in the
second issue of the "Sequoia." Most
of the author's labor was spent in try
ing to prove the proposition, "that
men are guilty, when charged, and
until they prove themselves innocent '
Considerable space was devoted to a
side issue arising from a communica
tion of the Quadrangle Club. It might
be well to state that there are only
three "Bugs" in the Quadrangle Cluo.
That only one of these was in the
state at the time the communication
was written, and that his attitude to
ward Mr. Shelon has been remarkably
fair when all the circumstances of
the past year are considered.
In this second article the "Sequoia'
attempted to ridicule the "Bugs" for
not having answered. A formal de
nial was therefore submitted at; the
request of Mr. Leaf, and he found
that, be had only crawled a little deep
er into the hole to which his lack of
foresight, and political aspirations
had led him. Mr. Leaf and Mr. Mil
ler and the small clique of men who
had been making such a noise over
the Quadrangle article, now realised
that their carefully laid plan to use a
University publication for political
purposes was about to be frustrated
I because of the inconsistency of their
I own statements. That this official or
gan is being used as a political bogie
is evidenced in the cleverly arranged
series of articles which have appeared
The first, was the anonymous attack
upon the honor societies in the Sep
tember issue of the "Sequoia." This
has been followed by a chain of arti
cles, the political meaning of which
has become more and more apparent
as the climax, the spring elections
has drawn near. A protest must be
entered against a prostitution of a
