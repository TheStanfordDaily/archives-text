# SCARABOEA CONDEMNS "SEQUOIA"
## Society Issues Detailed Refutation of Many Charges Preferred by R.J. Miller and E.M. Leaf In the Stanford Magazine. 
### 
Certain mistatements of facts
have been made in recent issues
of the "Sequoia." The object of this
article is to acquaint the members of
the Student Body with these per
versions of truth and to show the
purpose of the author's muckraking
campaign.
To begin with, it must be apparent
to everyone that Mr. Miller and Mr.
Leaf have made out no case against
the "Bugs" society. They have in
dulged in an inexcusable personal at
tack upon four or five individuals in
an attempt to free themselves from
the difficult position which they them
selves chose to assume. By this pro
cedure they have hoped to further
political interests of their own clique
which is the only one which has been
doing politics during the last two
years.
First let us examine the inconsist
ency of the "Sequoia's" statements
concerning its own position and tin'
purpose of the article written.
The first, article was clearly an at
tack upon the so-called "Bug" societv,
notwithstanding the Editor's state
ment in the last issue. From the last
issue of the "Sequoia" we quote the
following extract from the last ar
ticle: "....our purpose is not to con
vict either organization or individual,
but to acquaint the Student Body wil.'i
existing conditions...."
That the first article was however a
direct attack upon an organization is
best evidenced by the following quota
tions from Mr. Leaf. We quote fron
the editorial of the January issue of
the current year: "We believe it can
not be gainsaid that the very existence
of such an organization is subversive
of the best interests of this Student
Body." We quote again, "The fact
that the Scariboea society has ap
parently reached this stage of develop
ment, makes it a constant menace to
the Student Body." Quoting again
from the same editorial, " we
strongly believe that the best interests
of Stanford demand that this organiza
tion should be suppressed."
The charges were so serious that the
Student Body demanded that Mr. Leaf
produce facts to prove them. In a
public statement in the Daily Palo
Alto Mr. Leaf promised to submit his
proofs. But upon looking over his
material he soon learned that his ac
cusation was false. In gathering their
material Mr. Leaf and Mr. Miller had
overlooked the fact that it was quite
essential to know the membership of
the "Bug" society. They found tliat
they were reasonably sure of only five
or six men whom they had placed or>
their original list of twenty or more
members. They discovered that many
men whom they had implicated in
their charges were not "Bugs." They
also learned that many of the instan
ces upon which their conclusions were
based gave no evidence of political

manipulation. The question which
confronted Miller and Leaf was, "How
can we prove our charges without
facts, and when we do not even know
who the "Bugs" are?" Realizing the
impossibility of the situation, they
looked about them for an avenue of
escape from their own trap.
Close friends of Mr. Miller urged
Mr. Roth to save Mr. Miller from fu>
ther contempt and disgrace, ft was
suggested that this be done by a refu
tation of the charges or by an explana
tion of the character of the "Bug'
society. Mr. Leaf went to Mr. Roth
and asked him to make some reply for
the "Bugs" in the "Sequoia." Mr.
Roth informed Mr. Leaf that he d : d
not see how any reply was calle.'
for.and that knowing as he did that,
the charges were absolutely ground
less, he believed that the "Bugs" need
say nothing.
It, is now evident that no one was
willing to come forward and assist
the writers to escape from their diffi
cult position. Being convinced of their
own folly they prepared their ridicu
lous "crawl" which appeared in the
second issue of the "Sequoia." Most
of the author's labor was spent in try
ing to prove the proposition, "that
men are guilty, when charged, and
until they prove themselves innocent '
Considerable space was devoted to a
side issue arising from a communica
tion of the Quadrangle Club. It might
be well to state that there are only
three "Bugs" in the Quadrangle Cluo.
That only one of these was in the
state at the time the communication
was written, and that his attitude to
ward Mr. Shelon has been remarkably
fair when all the circumstances of
the past year are considered.
In this second article the "Sequoia'
attempted to ridicule the "Bugs" for
not having answered. A formal de
nial was therefore submitted at; the
request of Mr. Leaf, and he found
that, be had only crawled a little deep
er into the hole to which his lack of
foresight, and political aspirations
had led him. Mr. Leaf and Mr. Mil
ler and the small clique of men who
had been making such a noise over
the Quadrangle article, now realised
that their carefully laid plan to use a
University publication for political
purposes was about to be frustrated
I because of the inconsistency of their
I own statements. That this official or
gan is being used as a political bogie
is evidenced in the cleverly arranged
series of articles which have appeared
The first, was the anonymous attack
upon the honor societies in the Sep
tember issue of the "Sequoia." This
has been followed by a chain of arti
cles, the political meaning of which
has become more and more apparent
as the climax, the spring elections
has drawn near. A protest must be
entered against a prostitution of a
public trust reposed in Mr. Leaf by
the Student Body.
From statements made by Mr. Miller
at this time it was quite evident that
he would gladly have admitted his
mistake, could he have done so grace
fully. In fact his second aritcle was
a futile attempt to do this very thing.
The powerful infiuencers, however,
were not willing to come out like men
and say, "We have misjudged an in
nocent organization." This would not
accomplish the object for which the
articles were written. No political
strength or support could be gained by
such an honest proceeding.
Mr. Miller in a conversation wi h
Mr. Roth assured Roth that he had al
ways believed in him, that he knew
him to be absolutely honest and sin
cere and that it hurt him greatly to
involve Mr. Roth at all. He neverthe
less proceeded to smother his con
science and prepared the infamous,
false and absolutely unscrupulous per
sonal attacks which appeared in tne
last issue of the "Sequoia." Disin
terested parties warned the authors
that some of their statements of in
cidents were false, that the personal
atacks were absolutely unjustifiable.
But the authors were in a desperate
situation and closing their eyes to all
principles of fairness and honesty they
printed an article which is a disgrace
to Stanford University. The Staden*
Body can judge for itself lie moral
caliber of men who will write, and
men who will support such an artic.e.
The weakness of the "Sequoia's"
position must be apparent when ih n
three articles have been compared.
The first charges the "Bug" soeietv
with being a great political machine
controlling practically all college ac
tivities. The author then promises
facts and figures to prove his ac<,u«a
tions. The second article fails to pi o
duce these figures and is nothing mor«
than an excuse for having written tne
first. The third does not attempt to
prove the original charges but con
sists of muckraking personal attacks.
Let us now examine the articles «nd
the facts which they set forth as
proofs of the organizations.
.. I., Examination of the charges which
were set forth in the original article
but which have not been proven.
.. A..Charges concerning the control
which the "lings'' have oier Student
Body organizations.
The original article states, "Fx
pressed in general terms it (Bug So
ciety) practically controls through its
membership and affiliations. (1 > Tin*
Student Conference, (2) .Tin 1 Execu
tive Committee, (8) The Engineering
Societies and (4) The Honor Societies.
(1) If we accede to the statement that
the "Sequoia" has so oft repeated tha*:
it has proven all its charge:;, then we
must admit that the Executive Com
mittee is controlled by "Bugs", for
this is clearly one of the charge-s
above quoted. It Mr. Miller will admit
that he has proven this charge, the i
all his talk about present reforms, all
bis attempt to boost Mr. Shelton's ad
ministration, falls to the ground for a
committee controlled by the "Bugs" is
working out the reforms which the
"Bugs" are pictured as opposing. If
Mr. Miller denies that, the Executive
committee is controlled by the "Bugs"
as he stated in his first article, then he
is refuting one of his own charges.
He may take his choice. It would .»e
impossible to boost Mr. Shelton or
give him credit for much good work
by Mr. Roth's administration and by
Mr. Burbank, if it were admitted that

the present Executive Committee is
controlled by "Bugs." The last article
therefore attempts to adjust the in
consistency by stating that the per
sonnel of the Committee has charged.
We would remind Mr. Miller that the
personnel is exactly the same as it was
at the time the original charge was
made.
University Conference.
The only evidence which is present
ed on this point is the fact that M:\
Crawford, Mr. Roth and Mr. Tallant
are "Bugs" and are members of the
Conference. To quote the "Sequoia,"
"Among the members are to be found
the well known names of Roth, Craw
ford, Tallant, as well as numerous
sympathizers."
It might be well to mention the facc
that the only occasion arising in the
Conference this year, on which the
"Bugs" were accused of making their
powerful influences felt was the in
cident when Mr. Morgan's election was
protested and Mr. Malone was elected
to the Student Advisory Board. On
that occasion Mr. Crawford and Mr.
Tallant were absent. Mr. Roth sug
gested that a constitutional point be
stretched in order that Mr. Morgan
might be declared elected even tho >t;li
there had been no semblance of an
election. It is difficult to see where
the "powerful" control exists or lias
been exercised in the Conference.
There has been a clique in the Confer
ence however, consisting of the men
who have backed Mr. Miller in his
campaign. The members of the Con
ference can relate the peevish and
childish attitude which the men of tuis
clique have displayed on several oc
casions, and especially on tho partic i
lar occasion just mentioned.
Engineering Societies.
No attempt whatever is made to
prove that these are controlled by the
"Bugs" despite the fact that this state
ment was made in both of the first two
articles.
Honor Societies.
Practically no proof is offered on
this charge. None of the instances of
poorly qualified men (who are "Bilks'*
or sympathizers) being elected are
given. None of the instances "when
members threatened to pull out if
these men were elected to member
ship" are pointed out.
As a matter of information on th's
point it is now stated that Mr. Ro' l.
Mr. Crawford and Mr. Horton are tLe
only •'lings." who are members of an?
of the honor societies. Two of the
honor societies have no "Bugs" in
cluded in their memberships, none ap
pearing in either the Press Club or li e
debating honor society, Phi Alpha
Tan. None of the "Bugs", have ai y
hopes of making the latter soeietv
since it has been created, fostered and
controlled by the "clique" who haw
conducted the campaign against the
"Bugs." Anyone doubting the above
statements may take a list of mem
bers of the honor societies and sub
stantiate them.
It is impossible to see how the
"Sequoia" has proven its charges that
the "Bugs" control practically all the
college organizations, when the
"proofs" submitted have been con
sidered. One thing however is ap
parent. There has been a deliberate
attempt to mislead people into bc'.ie-. -
ing that facts exist which vio not ex
'st. This is shown by the instances
whose existence are hinted at but not
shown.
B. Charges concerning tne methods
used by the "Bugs" in "brow-beating".

"shelving" and adopting underclass
men.
I..Closing of Nominations.
It is repeatedly asserted that one of
the methods used by the "Bugs" in
gaining control and placing its men
in positions of influence, is the closing
of nominations before everyone has
been given a fair opportunity to place
men in nomination.
>o instances are given although
there is an attempt to mislead people
to believe that they have occured. It
is a matter of common information
that all Student Body nominations are
kept open until the day before the
election. This clearly could not there
fore occur in Student Body elections.
The voting in the Conference elec
tions is without nominations. Mr
Roth, the one "Bug" above all otheis,
who could have sanctioned and carried
on such undesirable methods has a'-
ways been a strong advocate of the
system of voting without nominationi,
and it is at his instance that this emi
nently fair method has been intro
duced in the elections for the Confer
ence and the election of athletic cap
tains. The implication that this meth
od is used is clearly not suslainei'.
(2). Boosting of Underclassmen Into
Positions. The only instance of this
evil is the Porter incident mentioned
in the last issue. In this Mi. Porter
"relates very vividly the fatherly way
which he was taken in hand and
boosted forward by some of the lead
ing members during his Freshman
year, the intention evidently having
been to take him into the fold."
The facts of Mr. Porter's case are
these. Mr. Roth and Mr. Burbank
believed Porter to be a capable Fresh
man. Mr. Roth probably did treat him
in a "fatherly way", to use the "Se
quoia" expression, as he has treated
many other Freshmen who have not
impugned his motives. Mr. Burbank
gave Mr. Porter a position as assist
ant laundry agent. At this time,
however, neither Mr. Roth nor Mr
Burbank were members of the "Bug"
society, and Mr. Burbank is not a
member at present. It is difficult to
see how Porter was adopted under
these' circumstances. It. would seem
ihat. influences have been Drought to
bear on Mr. Porter which have led him
to misconstrue acts of friendship, and
to forget the elementary principle o"
gratitude. The closing sentence of
the paragraph concerning Porter
shows the same repeated attempt to
deceive the readers as to the existence
of facts which do not exist. To quote,
"While it did not work in Porter's
case, a glance will show many other
instances where it has succeeded "
Mr. Miller has a wonderful faculty for
glancing at facts. The readers how
ever, have been led to expect that in
stances be at least pointed out. It
would have required little spae? to
mention them.
(3). Browbeating .Hen Who Attempt an
Investigation or Reform.
Two instances are given in supp irt
of this charge. It is pointed out that
the opposition to Mr. Shelton's elec
tion, and the fact that he is not a pop
ular idol is due to the fact that he
stands for reforms and principles
which are distasteful to the "Bugs."
It is impossible to deal with this pom 4
without being personal. Suffice to sa>
that all the facts of the Theile-Hails
incident have not been stated; that the
account printed in the Daily Palo Alto
by Mr. Theile was grossly incomplete
and misleading; and that the only rca
son that Mr. Roth has never given out
a public statement of facts which
would put Mr. Theile's and Mr. Cor
tez Shelton's actions in a much diff
erent. light, is that he has refused to
become a party to the controversy.
Mr. Theile has often openly mentioned
his cleverness in pulling off a political
manouver, whereby Mr. Hails was
placed in the disagreeable position of
either withdrawing and allowing Mr.
Shelton to enter the field unopposed
or continuing as a candidate and
thereby endangering the chances 01' a
very close friend and opening up a
legal fraternity fight. The men who
forced the deal to have Mr. Shelton go
into office unopposed, when many
students who can * not possibly be
classed as "Bug" sympathizers we.e
clamoring for a candidate to oppose
him, were desperate. They needed the
Student Body presidency in order to
give the clique which is now waging
its political campaign a good footing
to work from. They succeeded in their
ambitions but they also succeeded in
giving the Student Body the most dis
cordant factional period in its exis
tence. The Pittenger incident in
which Mr. Horton is alleged to have
told Pittenger "that he would get his"
is a mis-statement. When Pittemjer
came to Horton and asked that Horton
vote for him when the manager of the
Daily Palo Alto was to be appointed,
Horten did not make the remark above
mentioned. What he told Pittenger
was that he strongly disapproved of
his tactics in making a personal can
vas in the Hall for votes 011 the presi
dency, when it had always been under
stood that. Encina electors were to be
free from such political efforts. The
only other incident mentioned is the
alleged shelving of Mr. Ditz. The l'.ieis
of that incident are these: Some un
derclassmen went to Mr. Roth and
asked him what he thought of Mr.
Ditz as a candidate for the Executive
Committee. At that time Mr. Ditz wan
not well known and had as ;;et shown
no such great executive ability as to
lead Mr. Roth to believe him a suitable
man for the position. He so informed
the underclassmen and dismissed the
incident from his mind.
Later, Mr. Roth learned that Mr.
Miller was "hanging out a red rag to
the fraternities." At that time Mr.
Miller was a non-fraternity man and
was loudly advocating anti-fratei nitj
politics. This is a well known fact
among the Juniors and was evidence 1
in his participation in the Christian
and the Matthias election. Upon
learning of Miller's attitude on the
question of the relation of the frater
nitnes and tlie Hall in politics, Mr
Roth spoke to him upon the subject.
From the attitude which Mr. Mille:
was assuming at this time and from
the position of friendliness which Mr.
Roth has always assumed 011 tnis
question, it is very probable that Mil
ler did not assent to Roth's stat >-
ment as heartily as the last "Sequoia"
article would have us believe.
It is easy to see why Miller should
be careful to now state that lie has no
political objections to fraternity men.
He has during this year become a
member of the Greek letter fraternity
of Delta Chi which is soon lo take its
real place among the other fraternities
by occupying a chapter house 011 the
"Row" and to abandon its former quar
ters in the West end of the second
iloor of Encina.
Tn order to show how Inconsistent
Miller has been in his statement of th •
Ditz incident we quote the statements
which appeared in the first article and
in the last article concerning it. Com
pare the statements and see if they
seem to mean the same thing. Tne

following is an extract from the first
article: "I recall one particular :n
-stance where a certain man, rather
prominent in class affairs, felt him
self getting the shady side of the deal,
as he was gently sidetracked to lit
the plans of the growing 'Powers That
Be.' Only recently has another plum
been graciously handed out to him.
with the object of quieting his wrath,
and silencing any particular animosity
in that direction. For the "Bug" Ins
not yet crawled into complete power,
and it is necessary that minor spirits
be pacifiedand that the rebelious among
the common herd be quelled :is quietly
as possible. In this particular in
stance it is doubtful if the man re
ferred to, connected up the 'schmear'
and the salve, and even if he had, he
would probably continue to raise a
little ruction."
This is taken from the last article:
"Last Chirstmas when he announced
his candidacy again at the suggestion
of the present. Student Body President,
he stated that he intended to fight the
bunch, prominent upperclassmen or no.
As a. consequence he went in unop
posed, and apparently even with the
sanction of the 'Bug.' "
Two very inconsistent propositions
are here presented, First —that DLz s
nomination at. Christmas was done b"
the "Bugs" to hand Ditz a plum a.iu
salve and smear over his hard feelings
toward the "Bugs" for having shelved
him.
Second—That the "Bugs" did not
have anything to do with Ditz's noin.-
nation, but that he was asked to run
by Mr. Shelton.
There are three logical conclusions
which may be drawn. First, Mr. Snei
ton has become a "Bug" and so repre
sented the "Bugs" in handing M.\
Ditz the plum. Second, the "Bugs"
and the clique which Mr. Shelton rep
resented have fused and have become
one political organization. Third, The
inference of fact drawn from the Diu
incident does not in any way support
the charges against the "Bugs." The
latter is obviously the only correct
conclusion and is verified .vhen we
consider the facts which transpired
between the time when Miller wrote
the first article and the last.
Miller's ground for believing that
the "Bugs" had shelved Ditz and later;
handed him a plum based on the faci
that R. B. Wheeler had nominate;!
Ditz at the last election. Miller im
mediately concluded that since Wheel
er was a "Bug" the "Bugs" were hand
ing the "plum" by the nomination.
After his article appeared however,
Mil lei 1 learned from Ditz that Shelton
had suggested his candidacy and that
Wheeler had nominated Ditz at the re
quest. of Ditz himself. With these facto
in mind it is easy to see why Miller at
tempted to change the color of the in
cident. It is one of the clearest in
stance of what characterizes the entire
three articles, that is, the deliberate
attempt to distort facts, to make no
effort to investigae the truth of facts
and instances given in support of
these charges.
To summarize the proof given as to
the methods used by the "Bugs" we
find the same faults existing as were
noticed in the charges of control
First, 110 facts have been given in
proof. Second, deliberate mis-state
ments of facts for the purpose of mis
leading the readers. Third, shocking
inconsistencies.
Let ns proceed to examine the facts
which the "Sequoia" contained in its
last number and which have nothing
to do with the real issue.
First, It is charged that the "Hues"
