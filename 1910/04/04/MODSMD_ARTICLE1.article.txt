# CALIFORNIA EVENS UP SERIES SHUTTING OUT CARDINAL NINE
## Blue and Gold Team, Playing Errorless Ball, Scores Three Runs, While Stanford Cannot Tally In Contest Saturday. 
### 
California had little difficulty in an
nexing the second game of the Varsity
series at Berkeley last Saturday, by
the shutout score of 3-0. The Blue and
Gold team played good hall, and it is
strange, in view of their preliminary
season record. But such a reversal of
form is seen often in championship
contests. The Cardinal Varsity made
a strong enough showing, but did not i
seem to have the necessary vim and go
needed to take ihe victory. Gilfillan
and Reed were not effective, and the
cold weather may have had something
to do with this. Let the weather gods
deal out a warmer clay next Saturday \
for the deciding match of the chain- j
pionship and it is not hard to predict
that the Stanford twirlers will hold
their own. The errorless playing done
by the Blue and Gold men helped Hat-!
ris, the California mound artist, to |
stand out with a steady record to his j
credit. His pitching was not, how
ever, brilliant. He walked no one, but j
on the other hand he struck out no I
more than four wearers of the Cardi
nal. His team-mates fielded so well,
that the nine as a whole must be
given the medal and not to him alone.
He was not responsible for the shut
out. Only four men in all were walked
during the nine innings, two by each j
of the Stanford pitchers. Together
they struck out seven men. Tn hits the
two nines are not so far apart, Start-
I
ford marking up but one less than
California. The latter team's bingles,
however, came at times when they
were needed, and in the cases of each
run put across the platter its motive
power was a safe slam, the last two
tallies being made on doubles. Three
singles and a double-plated bingle
gleaned from Gilfillan, who toed the
rubber for four innings; two singles
and a hit for two is the contribution
of Reed, who managed the delivery
four chapters also, the ninth frame
not being utilized by the Blue and
Gold.
Captain Ganong, the Cardinal cap
tain, and Obear, the center garden
player, were the most consistent fight
ers for Stanford. Ganong found the
combination for two nifty singles from
the arm of Harris, while Obear made
practically the same number, but
could be given credit for only one,
since Reed was retired at the key
stone directly after Obear's popfly
had landed in short center in the
eighth. Both Obear and Ganong field
ed perfectly and with steadiness.
Stanford had a chance to tally twice,
but hits were scarce at the time. In
the opening session, Obear hit the
first ball over for a safe one and rode
to third on McFadden's sacrifice.
There he stopped, however, when
Ganong made the third out, O'Kelly to
Greenlaw.
The fifth seemed extremely rosy,
with two men on bases as the result
of two bingles close together. Ball
came first with a hit. S. Mitchell flew
to Coane; Cochran hit safely. Reed
could not straighten out Harris' curve,

and went out weakly, Lewis to Green
law. McGregor, up to bat for the
first time, went out on a fly to Salis
bury, and Stanford's chance was over.
California started in to score with
the first man, Allen. He got the initial
sack miraculously on M. Mitchell's
error, rested on the keystone a brief
space when Salisbury was walked, and
put a run on the board with Lewis',
single as a vehicle. Gay in the fourth 1
did his duty for the second tally. On
a safe one he was sacrificed to secoivl
by O'Kelly, and raced home behind
Greenlaw's two-bagger to left. Score, i
2-0.
The final tally appeared on the!
board in the sixth. Reed transported
Stoner, who, after Gay had fanned,
came home on O'Kelly's double, mis
judged unfortunately by McGregor in
left field. Score, 3-0.

California had little difficulty in an
nexing the second game of the Varsity
series at Berkeley last Saturday, by
the shutout score of 3-0. The Blue and
Gold team played good hall, and it is
strange, in view of their preliminary
season record. But such a reversal of
form is seen often in championship
contests. The Cardinal Varsity made
a strong enough showing, but did not i
seem to have the necessary vim and go
needed to take ihe victory. Gilfillan
and Reed were not effective, and the
cold weather may have had something
to do with this. Let the weather gods
deal out a warmer clay next Saturday \
for the deciding match of the chain- j
pionship and it is not hard to predict
that the Stanford twirlers will hold
their own. The errorless playing done
by the Blue and Gold men helped Hat-!
ris, the California mound artist, to |
stand out with a steady record to his j
credit. His pitching was not, how
ever, brilliant. He walked no one, but j
on the other hand he struck out no I
more than four wearers of the Cardi
nal. His team-mates fielded so well,
that the nine as a whole must be
given the medal and not to him alone.
He was not responsible for the shut
out. Only four men in all were walked
during the nine innings, two by each j
of the Stanford pitchers. Together
they struck out seven men. Tn hits the
two nines are not so far apart, Start-
I
ford marking up but one less than
California. The latter team's bingles,
however, came at times when they
were needed, and in the cases of each
run put across the platter its motive
power was a safe slam, the last two
tallies being made on doubles. Three
singles and a double-plated bingle
gleaned from Gilfillan, who toed the
rubber for four innings; two singles
and a hit for two is the contribution
of Reed, who managed the delivery
four chapters also, the ninth frame
not being utilized by the Blue and
Gold.
Captain Ganong, the Cardinal cap
tain, and Obear, the center garden
player, were the most consistent fight
ers for Stanford. Ganong found the
combination for two nifty singles from
the arm of Harris, while Obear made
practically the same number, but
could be given credit for only one,
since Reed was retired at the key
stone directly after Obear's popfly
had landed in short center in the
eighth. Both Obear and Ganong field
ed perfectly and with steadiness.
Stanford had a chance to tally twice,
but hits were scarce at the time. In
the opening session, Obear hit the
first ball over for a safe one and rode
to third on McFadden's sacrifice.
There he stopped, however, when
Ganong made the third out, O'Kelly to
Greenlaw.
The fifth seemed extremely rosy,
with two men on bases as the result
of two bingles close together. Ball
came first with a hit. S. Mitchell flew
to Coane; Cochran hit safely. Reed
could not straighten out Harris' curve,

and went out weakly, Lewis to Green
law. McGregor, up to bat for the
first time, went out on a fly to Salis
bury, and Stanford's chance was over.
California started in to score with
the first man, Allen. He got the initial
sack miraculously on M. Mitchell's
error, rested on the keystone a brief
space when Salisbury was walked, and
put a run on the board with Lewis',
single as a vehicle. Gay in the fourth 1
did his duty for the second tally. On
a safe one he was sacrificed to secoivl
by O'Kelly, and raced home behind
Greenlaw's two-bagger to left. Score, i
2-0.
The final tally appeared on the!
board in the sixth. Reed transported
Stoner, who, after Gay had fanned,
came home on O'Kelly's double, mis
judged unfortunately by McGregor in
left field. Score, 3-0.

California had little difficulty in an
nexing the second game of the Varsity
series at Berkeley last Saturday, by
the shutout score of 3-0. The Blue and
Gold team played good hall, and it is
strange, in view of their preliminary
season record. But such a reversal of
form is seen often in championship
contests. The Cardinal Varsity made
a strong enough showing, but did not i
seem to have the necessary vim and go
needed to take ihe victory. Gilfillan
and Reed were not effective, and the
cold weather may have had something
to do with this. Let the weather gods
deal out a warmer clay next Saturday \
for the deciding match of the chain- j
pionship and it is not hard to predict
that the Stanford twirlers will hold
their own. The errorless playing done
by the Blue and Gold men helped Hat-!
ris, the California mound artist, to |
stand out with a steady record to his j
credit. His pitching was not, how
ever, brilliant. He walked no one, but j
on the other hand he struck out no I
more than four wearers of the Cardi
nal. His team-mates fielded so well,
that the nine as a whole must be
given the medal and not to him alone.
He was not responsible for the shut
out. Only four men in all were walked
during the nine innings, two by each j
of the Stanford pitchers. Together
they struck out seven men. Tn hits the
two nines are not so far apart, Start-
I
ford marking up but one less than
California. The latter team's bingles,
however, came at times when they
were needed, and in the cases of each
run put across the platter its motive
power was a safe slam, the last two
tallies being made on doubles. Three
singles and a double-plated bingle
gleaned from Gilfillan, who toed the
rubber for four innings; two singles
and a hit for two is the contribution
of Reed, who managed the delivery
four chapters also, the ninth frame
not being utilized by the Blue and
Gold.
Captain Ganong, the Cardinal cap
tain, and Obear, the center garden
player, were the most consistent fight
ers for Stanford. Ganong found the
combination for two nifty singles from
the arm of Harris, while Obear made
practically the same number, but
could be given credit for only one,
since Reed was retired at the key
stone directly after Obear's popfly
had landed in short center in the
eighth. Both Obear and Ganong field
ed perfectly and with steadiness.
Stanford had a chance to tally twice,
but hits were scarce at the time. In
the opening session, Obear hit the
first ball over for a safe one and rode
to third on McFadden's sacrifice.
There he stopped, however, when
Ganong made the third out, O'Kelly to
Greenlaw.
The fifth seemed extremely rosy,
with two men on bases as the result
of two bingles close together. Ball
came first with a hit. S. Mitchell flew
to Coane; Cochran hit safely. Reed
could not straighten out Harris' curve,

and went out weakly, Lewis to Green
law. McGregor, up to bat for the
first time, went out on a fly to Salis
bury, and Stanford's chance was over.
California started in to score with
the first man, Allen. He got the initial
sack miraculously on M. Mitchell's
error, rested on the keystone a brief
space when Salisbury was walked, and
put a run on the board with Lewis',
single as a vehicle. Gay in the fourth 1
did his duty for the second tally. On
a safe one he was sacrificed to secoivl
by O'Kelly, and raced home behind
Greenlaw's two-bagger to left. Score, i
2-0.
The final tally appeared on the!
board in the sixth. Reed transported
Stoner, who, after Gay had fanned,
came home on O'Kelly's double, mis
judged unfortunately by McGregor in
left field. Score, 3-0.
