Editor Daily Palo Alto:
In these days of accusations and
counter accusations I am not at all
sure that a flat denial on my part of
a recent statement made about me in
both the Daily Palo Alto and the "Se
quoia" will be of any purpose.
When the first mention of the name
McGregor was made in Ihe "Sequoia,"
I paid no attention to the fact as, be
lieving myself not concerned, I took it
that a McGregor other than myself
must have been implied. When how
ever, in Saturday's issue of the"Daily"
it was stated that it was E. A. McGreg
or who had not paid his training
table bill, I made immediate efforts to
assure myself of the truth or untruth
of ihe statement.
I find that I was correct in believing
that I had paid my training-table bill
and wish to state that., if my word is
doubted in the matter, T will gladly ex
hibit Ihe receipted bill for the same.
(Signed) E. A. McGREGOR.
