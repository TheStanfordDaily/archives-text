The Women's League is in charge of
a large Women's Club-house rally to
be held in the Chapel on Wednesday
afternoon at 4:30. The meeting will
be a student affair entirely, although
it will receive the hearty support of
the alumnae and faculty members of
the League. The rally is largely l'or
the purpose of acquainting the women
of the University with the plans of the
permanent committee in regard to the
Club-house. There will be a very short
and interesting program, consisting of
reports and talks on the venture.
There will probably bo two speakers
from the Student Body, and Miss
Mary Hutchins, secretary of Y. W. C.
A., will be the third speaker. Thore
will lie a short resume of all the work
already done, and a report of all sub
scriptions made up to date.
The members of the Ruble Club, who
are more familiar with tho plans than
the rest of the women at the Univer
sity, have already subscribed $1,300
which has come spontaneously from
members of the club. For this reason
the committee in charge wish to ac
quaint. the other women of the col
lege with plans in order that the fund
may grow more rapidly, and the Club
house become a reality sooner. All
faculty, students and alumnae are
urgently requested to attend.
