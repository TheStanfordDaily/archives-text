# BIG BLOW FOR SALOON MEN.
## Court Upholds Lower Tribunal and Places Boundary of Campus at San Francisquito Creek. 
### 
The second trial of Barney Burke
the Menlo Saloon keeper, who is
charged wth violating the state law
prohibiting the sale of liquor within a
mile and a half of any university with
a registration of 1000 students, ."00 of
whom live upon the campus, was con
cluded last Tuesday, when Judge Stur
tevant of San Francisco, sitting in
Judge Buck's court in Redwood City,
rendered a decision upholding the
lower court. The latter tribunal hand
ed down a decision that held that the
University campus extended to San
Francisquito Creek.
This decision places the saloon of
Burke, and all others of Menlo Park
within the territory prohibited from
selling liquor. The decision also
settles all points of the law and can
not be made subject to appeal.
The only other move that can be
made by the attorneys for the defense
is to appeal to the supreme court for :Â»
writ of habeas corpus for the defen
dant. If the writ is granted the Su
preme Court will pass upon the consti
tutionality of the law.
