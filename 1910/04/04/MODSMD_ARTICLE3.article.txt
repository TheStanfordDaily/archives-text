# CREWS RACE SATURDAY
## INTER-CLUB REGATTA TO BE HELD ON ESTUARY. Senior Eights and Freshman Fours From Lagunita and California Clubs to Compete. 
### 
Next Saturday morning will witness
the inter-club regatta between the
Lagunita and University of California
Boat Club crews. The races are
scheduled to start promptly at 10:30
and will be two in number, a Senior
eight, and a Freshman four. The
course is on the Oakland Estuary and
spectators may view the contest from
vantage points on both the Oakland
and Alameda shores.
The course selected is as near an
ideal one as can be found on San Fran
cisco Bay. The finish point will be at
the Park street bridge, which may be
reached by the Alameda electric cars
running through East Oakland. The
Senior race will be over a two-mile
course, while the first-year event will
last for one mile. Provided the weath
er continues as it is at present, the
regatta will not be marred by rough
water as in previous years. The
course is very well sheltered and is
usually smooth during the morning.
The Lagunita men have beeu train
ing hard over the Redwood City
course during the last week and will
be in excellent condition next Satur
day. The two crews are practically
selected and will be announced in a
few ciSys.
California will in all probably be
represented by a crew containing six
veteran oarsmen of last year's varsity
eight, which fact promises well for a
fast crew.
Emblems of suitable design will be
awarded the men comprising the
crews.
