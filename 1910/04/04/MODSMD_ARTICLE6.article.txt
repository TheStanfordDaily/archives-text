# CLASS MEET TOMORROW
## ANNUAL CONTEST WILL BE LAST CHANCE TO SEE MEN WORK. Senior Team Expected to Capture Greatest Number of Points.â€”Establish Track Training Table. 
### 
The last contest before the red letter
day on the track calendar will be held
at 4 o'clock tomorrow afternoon. The
inter-class meet will be run off at that
time, and inasmuch as this is the sole
remaining class contest of the present
year, strenuous efforts will bo made to
retrieve honors lost on other fields.
Only men who have trained continu
ously during the entire season will be
allowed to enter. With all of the
athletes in the pink of condition, the
winning or losing of any race will
be a mere matter of inches.
The struggle will be between the
Senior and Sophomore teams, with the
odds in favor of the 1910 men, al
though if the second-year athletes are
bested it will only be after record per
formances are chalked up. The mark
in greatest danger is in the hammer
tossing event, and D. P. Crawford, '09,
is the man who has been making the
threats. While taking after-dinner ex
ercise last week the big weight throw
er hurled the iron ball an estimated
distance of 160 feet. If Crawford can
duplicate this feat tomorrow, Stan
ford's "Hall of Fame" should order an
enlarged picture of this athlete.
Interesting things may be expected
in the sprints, as H. R. Stolz is cred
ited with covering the century in 10:1
a few days ago. With this speedy
sprinter and H. E. Reed, '10, the record
holder in this event, the Seniors will
be well represented in the short races,
but T. S. Coleman, '12, has more than
an even chance to negotiate the dis
tance a shade faster than either.
The meet is scheduled to start at 4
o'clock and as only 25 cents admission
will be charged, a large crowd is ex
pected, especially since the contest
with California is only a little over a
week away.
Tn order to better condition the ath
letes for the task of downing the Blue
and Gold, the Varsity men will hence
forth be gathered around the training
table at the Inn for two meals a day.
Twenty-seven names comprise the
list, as originally made out by Captain
Scott, but others will probably be
added during the week. The men woh
were selected are as follows: W. M.
Argabrite, '13, S. H. Bellah, '10, T. S.

though if the second-year athletes are
bested it will only be after record per
formances are chalked up. The mark
in greatest danger is in the hammer
tossing event, and D. P. Crawford, '09,
is the man who has been making the
threats. While taking after-dinner ex
ercise last week the big weight throw
er hurled the iron ball an estimated
distance of 160 feet. If Crawford can
duplicate this feat tomorrow, Stan
ford's "Hall of Fame" should order an
enlarged picture of this athlete.
Interesting things may be expected
in the sprints, as H. R. Stolz is cred
ited with covering the century in 10:1
a few days ago. With this speedy
sprinter and H. E. Reed, '10, the record
holder in this event, the Seniors will
be well represented in the short races,
but T. S. Coleman, '12, has more than
an even chance to negotiate the dis
tance a shade faster than either.
The meet is scheduled to start at 4
o'clock and as only 25 cents admission
will be charged, a large crowd is ex
pected, especially since the contest
with California is only a little over a
week away.
Tn order to better condition the ath
letes for the task of downing the Blue
and Gold, the Varsity men will hence
forth be gathered around the training
table at the Inn for two meals a day.
Twenty-seven names comprise the
list, as originally made out by Captain
Scott, but others will probably be
added during the week. The men woh
were selected are as follows: W. M.
Argabrite, '13, S. H. Bellah, '10, T. S.
Coleman, '12, H. L. Horton, '10, G. S.
Horine, '18, A. Johnston. '10, W. IT.
Newman, '12, H. V. Poor, '10, L. H.
Price, '13, W. D. Peaslee, '10, W. S.
Porter, '11, H. R. Stolz, '10. H. Smith

The last contest before the red letter
day on the track calendar will be held
at 4 o'clock tomorrow afternoon. The
inter-class meet will be run off at that
time, and inasmuch as this is the sole
remaining class contest of the present
year, strenuous efforts will bo made to
retrieve honors lost on other fields.
Only men who have trained continu
ously during the entire season will be
allowed to enter. With all of the
athletes in the pink of condition, the
winning or losing of any race will
be a mere matter of inches.
The struggle will be between the
Senior and Sophomore teams, with the
odds in favor of the 1910 men, al
though if the second-year athletes are
bested it will only be after record per
formances are chalked up. The mark
