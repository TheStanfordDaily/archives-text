# R.J. MILLER CONDEMNS SCARABOEA
## Author of "Sequoia's" Political Articles Attacking "Bug" Society Writes Exhaustive Refutation of Recent Communication. 
### 
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
I desire as briefly as possible to
correct the false impressions whicn
the "Bug" Society attempted to create
by its article in the March 26th issue
of the Daily Palo Alto. The "Sequoia"
warned the Student Body in advance
that these men would try to avoid the
issue and cloud the facts advanced,
and they have made a long and sophis
tical attempt to do so. Their methods
in so doing have been three:
A By deliberately impugning the
motives of the "Sequoia" editors, ami
attempting to create a wholly false
impression that the articles were in
spired solely by the desire to advance
the political interests of an alleged
clique,
it By n tissue of fabrications which
they allege to be refutations of the
"Sequoia's" charges and proof.
C By ignoring some facts, by evad
ing others, and by glossing over the
points of political corruption and graft
which are the main issues.
Absurd Charges Made by the "Bugs."
A Consider now the first method
adopted by the "Bugs" in their at
tempt to evade the responsibility for
their misdeeds.
I The "Bugs" charge that the arti
cles were written for the purpose of
gaining political power. The absolute
absurdity of this charge appears upon
its very face. How could anyone for a
moment, imagine that two or three men
could be seeking to advance their own
prestige and to increase their political
power by attacking a whole system of
Student Body administration in a mari
ner which could only be expected to
antagonize the athletic element of the
University, which is recognized as the
powerful controlling part of the Stu
dent Body. Had we desired to make
political stock of the "Bugs" and their
organized political control, it would
have been a simpler matter to adopt
the underhand methods of these mas
ter politicians, to "talk things up,"
and to go around remarking, "Well I
want to know about these things"
which method is supposed to show
great, learning, and to indicate fore
sight at least "as long as their noses '
—to use the words of Mr. Fuller. We
have done none of this. We have pub
lished our charges, submitted our
proof, and signed our names thereto.
We have invited the ridicule, scorn,
and abuse of the indiscriminate ele
ments that, we have antagonized. We
have made no effort to compromise.
We have not tried to save anyone,
with such exceptions as Mr. Roth. We
have criticized wherever the "Bugs'
has showed its head, and we have
come out into the open and signed our
names. Can anyone say that by such
a method we were seeking to advance
our own interests? Our charges were
calculated to antagonze, but at the
same time to bring home a realization
of the need of a reform.
It is therefore obvious that we have
never at any time been acting with .»
view to political aggrandizement. In

proof of this we offer the following
further facts:
1. At the time of the commencement
of the controversy, Mr. Leaf was In
line for no other honor at the hands of
the Student Body than that of Editor
of the Daily Palo Alto. Mr. Leaf re
fused to run against Mr. Fuller who
was then an unpopular candidate.
Certainly it cannot be urged that he
had anything to gain by these articles.
2. Mr. Shelton already occupied the
office of Student Body President. The
only other office which it would be
possible for him to have in considera
tion would be that of graduate mana
ger. Mr. Shelton has repeatedly stated
to Mr. Burbank and others, that he has
never had any desire or intention to
run for this office.
3. No political motives were urged
against me in the Daily article. As a
matter of fact I was the only one of the
three who had been actively suggested
as a candidate. I have never had any
intention of running for any Student
Body office at the coming election.
Last December at the tme these arti
cles were planned, Mr. Leaf warned
me that I was giving up all chance of
Honor Societies and Student Body
offices by writing them. T realised thi«.
but was not only willing but anxious o
go ahead with them. I have never been
under any undue influence in the mat
ter, as the "Bugs" have falsely alleged.
I have never regretted my part in thp
controversy.
In view of the above facts which
were known by the men who wrote
the reply of the "Bugs", there is abso
lutely no ground for charging us with
a desire for political gain. The ef
forts of the gentlemen in this direction
have very evidently been with the idea
of clouding the issue, of turning at
tention away from the real points of
consideration. It is only another very
good example of their underhand
methods. As Judge Lindsey expresses
it."the beast has turned polecat" only
in this case it. is the Scaraboea that
has turned stink-bug, and has attempt
ed to save itself by besmirching others
By trying to show political manipula
tion on our part, by deliberately lying
about my motives and wishes in the
matter, they have hoped to hide the
unclean visage of the "Bug."
"Sequoia" is Not Inconsistent.
H. The "Bugs" also devote consid
erable space to an attempt to point
ou<; inconsistencies in the position of
the "Sequoia." The absolute jugglery
and sophistry of their attempts arc
barefaced in the extreme,
a. There is nothing inconsistent in
i the statements: 1. That the "Scara
boea Society is a menace to the Stu
dent Body and the best interests of
Stanford demand that it. be sup
pressed," and 2. "Our purpose is not
to convict either organization or in
dividual. but to acquaint the Student
Body with existing conditions, in order
that they may know what to expect,
and what to demand of their officers,"
The "Bugs" carefully omitted the
blackfaced part of the latter state
ment. We have repeatedly stated our
belief that the Scaraboea society and
others of life nature were undesirable,
but have also continually pointed out
that it was for the Student Body to do
any necessary convicting and to take
whatever action it desired in tho
premises. We believe that the
Scaraboea Society is undesirable and
that it stands convicted.
b. The Ditz incident is cited as an
other example of inconsistency. Con
sider the facts. Ditz desired to run
for the Executive Committee in the
election of one year ago. Mr. Roth
impressed upon me, and as I have later
discovered upon other 1911 men the
fact that Mr. Ditz was undesirable to
a certain group of upperclassmen. I.
as well as other 1911 fellows notified
Mr. Ditz of this fact. He withdrew
but in December again decided to run
Incidentally he was urged to run by Mr
Shelton who respected his ability, an 1
knew him as a man who opposed the
machine. At that time Mr. Elliott
"Bug," had been talked of as a candi
date for the same office. Mr. Elliott
dropped out. Mr. Ditz was nominated
by Mr. Wheeler, "Bug." Mr. Ditz'
bluff had worked. The "Bug" had
been afraid to oppose him in view of
the fight he had made against them
The plum was forced upon them, and
consisted in withdrawing the "Bug''
candidate and in nominating Ditz under
the auspices of the "Bug." The only
possible point of inconsistency won I '.'
be that 1 thought Mr. Ditz had turned
"Bug." I have never at any time sug
gested such a thing. The whole of
column two of page five of Hie
"Daily Palo Alto" is devoted to th< j
most childish and foolish prattle aboii*
"inconsistency." Mr. Shelton did not
have anything to do with Mr. Ditz
nomination or election. He merely
urged him to run. The part played b}
the "Bugs" consisted in withdrawing
their own candidate and nominating
Ditz. I'njugglcd, the whole matter is
perfectly clear.
c. The other alleged inconsistency
relates to my attitude toward Mr. Roth
I have always told Mr. Both and any
one else who took the pains to inquire
that I have always had the greatest
respect for him and that it was th"
most regrettable feature of the con
troversy to me that he had so associat
ed himself with the undesirable ele
ment at Stanford that his name hal
to be brought into discussion. I be
lieve that Mr. Roth has done a great
deal of good at Stanford and that he
can do more. But he has done thes«
things in spite of the men with whom
he associates. He has himself told me
that when a moral issue is involved h r
often found himself aligned against the
whole group. He has further told me
that the trouble at Stanford was the
attitude taken by these same men who
believe that Stanford can never
amount to anything without booze.
Now while he may influence these men
to some extent, on the other hand, they
exercise an influence over him. So
when he hears the men with whom he
most closely associates criticise an
other man, it is perfectly natural that
lie should forget his own ideas in th«
matter and take steps to let that man
know he is an undesirable —as in the
Ditz incident.
"Bugs" Hide Behind Mr. Both.
The "Bug" society is indeed fortu
nate in having a man of Mr. Roth's
character to hide behind. If he stood

alone as the "Bug" society—and the
evident intention of the reply of the
"Bugs" was to convey this impression
—then perhaps we would have noth
ing to fear. The "Bugs" exist however,
in spite of him and often succeed in
inveigling him into exceedingly diffi
cult situations. Take the incident of
the track captain nomination which
the "Bugs" endeavored so frantically
to juggle into the appearance of an
entirely harmless affair. Whether Mr.
Roth told Mr. Scott before that he did
not favor him is a matter of doubt but
it is immaterial anyway. If he did not
favor Mr. Scott for track captain it
was evident because he thought that
the latter was undesirable. His duty
then to Stanford required that he never
should have nominated Scott. Mr. Both
however, would have us believe that
he was over-flowing with the milk of
human kindness and that he nominated
Mr. Scott because he feared the latte;
would not otherwise get a proper
chance. Why then did Mr. Both ar
range a deal with Horton whereby no
nominations should be made ? Cer
tainly if it was so necessary to Mr.
Scott that he be nominated by the
enemy, he would not have had a fair
show where everyone voted without
nominations. If Mr. Scott was so un
popular that no one wanted to nomi
nate him then it was a very small trick
in Mr. Both to attempt to bury him by
not having any nominations, when he
had already promised to nominate
him. As a matter of fact, Mr. Scott
was elected and this would seem to
show that it would have been easy for
him to have secured another spokes
man and that it was extremely unlikely
that he would have consented to have
had Mr. Both nominate him if he had
known that the latter favored Holman.
By far the most logical conclusion is
that Mr. Both was as usual trying to
stand in with both sides.
Mr. Both and Mr. Wheeler pose as
the authors of this system of voting
without nominations. It, seems aston
ishing that two men would admit such
a thing. The admission was probably
made in order to avoid being accused
of it when the thing appeared in its
true light. This method of election,
which was apparently first suggested
in order to hell) Mr. Both out of th 3
bad fix at the time of Mr. Scott's elec
tion, is one of the most barefaced of
the tricks of the "Bugs." By this
means the gang can previously agree
on some man and vote straight for
him. As no men are up and as no
other slates are prepared, the rest of
the vote will be scattered and the ma
chine can easily elect its candidate
even without a majority of votes. Then 3
can be little doubt that this was the
method used in placing Mr. Crawford
at. the head of the advisory committee
of the University Conference.
(Summarizing briefly then we see flint
the "Bugs" have deliberately proceeded
by accusations which they knew to be
false, to attempt to discredit the mo
tives of the "Sequoia" in the hope that
they might thereby destroy the effect
of the absolute facts presented by us.
The alleged inconsistencies, which
they could make out only by deliber
ate and knowing perversions of the
facts constitute all the proof they ad
vance to show that, we were animated
by political motives.
Reply of "Bugs" Is Tissue of Lies.
It. The "Bug's" second method of
evading the issue consisted in the con
st ruction of a tissue of fabrications
which they try to palm oil" as answers
and refutation to the "Sequoia's"
charges. We point out herewith six
teen deliberate mis-statements in (lie
"reply of tlie "Bugs."
1. The statement that we "were
reasonably sure of only five or dx
men whom they had placed on the
original list of twenty or more mem
bers," is a deliberate falsehood. The
gentlemen know nothng about the na
ture or extent of our information on
this point. As a matter of fact since
the articles were planned the "Se
quoia" has had in its possession a list
of the members secured indirectly from
one of the "Bugs." The "Bugs" have
denied that certain men whom we have
charged with being "Bugs", are mem
bers. We are "reasonably sure," to
use their own expression that these
men are members. Moreover, the men
whom the "Hugs" have admitted to be
members are suftieient to indicate the
guilt of the organization.
2. Mr. Leaf never "went to Mr. Roth
and asked him to make some reply for
the "Bugs" in the 'Sequoia.'" Thip
statement is a deliberate perversion of
the facts, and is merely another il
lustration of the mis-statements thai
characterize the whole article. He
told Mr. Roth that he desired to be
perfectly fair to everyone and there
fore the "Sequoia" was open to him or
the "Bug" society in case they desire!
to make any reply.
2. To the best of my knowledge no
close personal friend of mine ever
went to Mr. Roth with any pleas that
I should be "saved from contempt an'
disgrace."
4. The February issue of the "Se
quoia" did not attempt to prove the
proposition, "that men are guilty when
charged, and until they prove them
selves innocent." The February "Se
quoia" insisted that if the Scaraboea
society was innocent or beneficial its?
best and logical answer would be *c
deny the charges and to state its pur
pose. Why has not the Scaraboea sit
any time stated its purpose? Why doe*
it persistently circulate rumors of
"drinking society," "lover's knot be
tween Row and Hall," only to deny
them in print later? .It is a creature
existing here at Stanford, interfering
very decidedly with our internal affairs.
Why have we not a right to know
what it is for? Why do not the mem
bers dure to make known their pur
poses?
5. The gentlemen submit that the
"Sequoia" is being used as a political
bogie, and as evidence suggest, "the
cleverly arranged series of article!-
which have appeared." They evidently
refer to three articles which I wrot' 1
and which had absolutely no connec
tion with the anonymous article
which appeared in September. The
articles were, "Dramatic Criticism."
"The Stanford Union," and "Does the
Student Body Think." Here again 'he
Scaraboea society have attempted to
mislead the Student Body by inten
tionally juggling the facts. Tf the gen
tlemen can find anything political in
the articles, they are indeed marvels
of political shrewdness. Their own in
consistency is shown here because they
contend on the one hand that I was
inveigled into writing the Scaraboea
articles and at the same time contend
that, I was a party to a preconceive'!
general plot all last semester.
6. r wish to brand as absolutely
false the assertion that, "From state
ments made by Mr. Miller at this tim«s
it is quite evident that be would gladly
have admitted his mistake, could be
have done so gracefully." T never at
any time made any statements that
could be so construed. lam absolute
ly certain that T have made no mistak"
in charging the Scaraboea society with

being an agent of political manipula
tion. I would at any time be glad to
admit that I had made a mistake if I
j am shown wherein i have been wrong
The continued refusal of the "Bugs"
to come out and state their purposes
and the desperate attempts to smother
the issue, have only convinced me the
more fully that they are guilty.
7. The statement that I luive ever
acted under any "powerful influencers"
is absolutely unfounded. The gentle
men have been misled by the fact that
I have been fighting on principle rath -
er than against individuals, and that !
was sorry Mr. Roth should be placed in
a difficult position when his main fault
has been in his temporizing tactics. I
have never smothered my conscience
in this whole matter and have never
knowingly written anything "infamous,
false, or unscrupulous."
8. No "disinterested party" ever
"warned" us that any of our published
statements were false. Some very in
terested parties hinted at libel suits
and faculty action with the very evi
dent intention of bulldozing us into
suppressing the article. The Daily
Palo Alto also suggested punishment
by means of a libel suit. We would
suggest to the gentlemen that the
courts in which the law of libel is en
forced, are still in .operation and it
would seem scarcely consistent for
them to avoid taking advantage of
them. These fireworks were very evi
dently exploded with the idea of giving
weight to the rather shaky statements
which the gentlemen had previously
made.
9. I have never expressed to Mr.
Roth or to anyone else a desire to get
out of writing the last articles. I
would even have preferred that tin
third article should have come in Feb
ruary, and was restrained by the mor-j
conservative reasoning of Mr. Leaf. !
overheard Mr. Roth in Encina Club
room, telling a crowd that I was de
sirous of getting out of writing the
facts, and told him that I had never
expressed any such sentiment. Where
upon he left the room in some haste.
10. I have never at any time "waved
the red flag to the fraternities" as
falsely alleged by the "Bugs." Anyone
who has ever heard me express an
opinion on the subject, knows that I
have always stood for an equal balance
of power between the Row and til?
Hall. I voted for Wheeler, Lee and
Wyman, and supported them during
their administrations as presidents of
1911. I insisted all the way through
the Hill-Matthias campaign that it
should be made a fight on men, not on
boarding places. The statement that
1 have ever "waved the red flag to the
fraternities" is the foolish phantasy of
a diseased imagination. Moreover, it
has absolutely no point in this discus
sion. and has been brought in as a
"grandstand play" to cloud the issue.
11. Mr. Roth did not suggest, that a
"constitutional point be stretched in
order that. Mr. Morgan might be de
clared elected a member of the Univer
sity Conference, even tho there had
been no semblance of an election." In
his usual manner of standing in with
both sides, Mr. Roth remarked that
"while nobody would sooner see 'Jeff"
in the Conference than he, still there
had been no election, and a new elec
tion should be called," or words t'i
that effect. The real purpose of the
holding of a new election was evident
ly to get another "Bug" into the Con
ference. For Mr. Wheeler, "Bug", ran
against Mr. Morgan next, time, and
despite strenuous campaigning among
tho English and Latin majors, was
beaten.

12. The "Bugs" state that no Instan
ces are given where men who are
poorly qualified have been elected to
the Quadrangle Club. This is a delib
erate falsehood. We pointed out the
case of Mr. Fuller. Absolutely no an
swer has been made to this. We could
point out further cases if it were not
for the fact, that we would be entering
into unnecessary personalities.
13. The "Bugs" state that "the per
sonnel of the Executive Committee is
exactly the same as it was at the time
the original charge was made." This
is untrue. Mr. Dole has taken Mr.
Fletcher's place, and since the article
was written Mr. Ditz has succeeded
Mr. Wheeler. I wish to point out once
more to the apparently failing intel
lects of the legal advisers of th.i
"Bugs" that it is not necessary that
they should have an actual majority in
order to succeed. One in a socitey is
enough to exercise a blackball, and
two or three in the Executive Commit
tee or in the Conference, especially if
they are athletic heroes, can dictate
policies.
14. Another misrepresentation is
found in the statement "that all Ihe
facts of the Theile-Hails incident have
not been stated; that the account
printed by Mr. Theile was grossly 'n
complete and mis-leading." This is
entirely unjustified in view of the fail
ure of the Quadrangle Club to make
any reply to Mr. Fuller's statement
editorially in the January 17th issue of
the Daily Palo Alto to the following
effect: "Mr. Theile gives us a dignified
and straightforward statement of lm
knowledge of those dealings. * * *
Does his communication contain every
material fact, pertinent to the subject?
* * * If it does not, it is for the
Quadrangle Club to substantiate bis
statements with proof." INCONSIST
ENCY!!!!! Why do not the genlle
men give the facts, if they have not all
been given?
15. The statement that "Mr. Miller
and Mr. Leaf made no attempt to find
out what men had paid their training
table bills, after the time when Mr.
Burbank settled with Shelton Bros." is
false. His books were carefully con
sulted a few days before the articles
were written, while they were in the
hands of Mr. Shelton for the purposes
of being audited. Some of these men,
notably Mr. Holman, have paid their
training table bills after this contro
versy began.
16. We did not state that Mr. Roth's
administration made no effort to se
cure the payment of training tablo
bills. We stated that no "EFFECTUAL
STEPS WERE TAKEN TO ERADI
CATE THE EVILS."
Tims it will be seen that the com
munication of the "Bugs" is honey
combed with lies, ami that, it is on the
basis of these that their conclusions
are reached.
"Bugs" Try to (iloss Over Graft.
C. The thrd method employed by the
"Bug" was that of ignoring some facts,
evading others, and glossing over the
points of political corruption ami graft
which are the main issues.
I—The point that Crawford,' a man
unqualified for the position, occupies
the office of chairman of the Advisory
committee, is absolutely ignored. Tho
point that Mr. Fuller, a man unquali
fied for membership in the Quadrangle
Club, according to the self-avoweJ
standards of that organization, was
elected to membership therein was
ignored. They have persistent'/
failed to show why J. E. Shelton —Stu-
dent Body President—was not taken
into the Quadrangle Club, a purely
honorary society.
The Rubbiig List Graft.
11. They have evaded some points
and have attempted to slide by them
without meeting the issue.
1. Take the matter of the rubbing
list. This was one of the most Impor
tant points to be considered. The
method employed to sidetrack the
whole matter is ridiculous. The fig
ures which I gave were for last fall.
It is absolutely immaterial in consider
ing them whether or not the system
previously in use was to pay by the
month or the hour. The point is that
the lists banded in wore fraudulent.
It was practically impossible that Mr.
Horton and Mr. Crawford could do
more than five of ten minutes rubbing
per night, because they could not have
the time to do it in. It is concentrated
work —yes—but the point is that con
centrated or uneoncentrated it is paid
for at the rate of fifty cents per hour,
and time was paid for that was not
put in.
2. Again consider the matter of the
training table. In a note at the bottom
of page 158 of the "Sequoia" I pointed
out the fact that some of the men
may have paid later. It is not neces
sary that "Bugs" alone should fail to
pay their bills. It is natural that
others should follow their lead, and as
long as the "Bugs" hold enough con
trol of Student Body administration to
avoid difficulties, it is a safe proposi
tion. In fact this method of passing
out small favors is one of the best
ways of securing followers. The mem
bers of the "Bug" are the field gener
als—the dictators —receiving worship
from the smaller fry, passing out small
favors and receiving support in return.
In the case of Mr. G. McGregor th*
"Bugs" have tried to shelve the respon
sibility by laying the blame on Mr. E.
A. McGregor. The name appears so
frequently that it is one of the most
familiar in the list of delinquencies.
The reference in each case except the
spring of 1909 is to Mr. G. McGregor,
"Bug." I should have thought that
gentleman, if he had anything to do
with the "Bug" communication, would
have been ashamed to have had the
matter brought up.
3. Consider the honor societies. Here
the gentlemen attempted to sidestep
with a little humor directed at Phi
Alpha Tan. Tn he honor societies
again it. is evidently necessary to 10-
peat that the majority of members do
not need to be "Bugs." As one man
can keep out any other candidate by
means of the black-ball, a very small
group can control an honor society.
If that, group of men happen to be
"Bugs" or sympathizers, the "Bugs '
can and do very effiectually control the
honor societies.
"Grandstand Plays" by "lings."
111. They have attempted to gloss
over and avoid the issues of political
manipulation by questioning our mot
ives, and by playing off some clever
"grand-stands."
1. They make a great deal of t.h°
fact that Delta Chi has considered go
ing into a house. Now what that ha*
to do with the issue is certainly hard
to imagine. Certain members of Phi
Delta Phi have consistently endeavor
ed to make out a law fraternity figh'.
The fact, however, that the men we
have attacked in the main are not.
members of Phi Delta Phi ought to be
proof enough that it. has not, been a
fight against that fraternity. "When

Mr. Leaf and I planned these articles,
I had not even been bid Delta Chi.
Several members of the fraternity have
not been in sympathy with the contro
versy. That those of us who are most
active in trying to eradicate the evil.-;,
are united, lam glad to say. We have
never attempted to conceal the fact. I
have already exploited the idea that
we had any political motives in view.
We have congratulated ourselves on
the fact that we have not been in the
thing for political gain.
2. The fact that Mr. Roth has done
a great deal for Stanford is also used
to the limit. I have already explained
our position in regard to Mr. Roth.
The gentlemen have certainly done
well to hide behind him.
3. The "Bugs" have made a great
deal of the fact that under Mr. Bur
bank's management, the Student Body
has a larger cash balance than usual.
When we consider that the great ex
pense of boating has been removed,
that, the salary of assistant coach and
assistant manager have also been re
moved, and that several leaks have
been closed up under this administra
tion, the real cause for Student Body
prosperity becomes evident.
4. "Dad" Moulton has also come in
for an extensive eulogy. However, de
spite the material that, has been made
of this question, the facts concerning
him, which we stated in the "Sequoia"
still remain unaffected.
Now in conclusion T would like to
point, out one further fact:
The men who have been taken in
hand and boosted around here are so
well known that we felt it was no use
to publish their names. Wheeler, El
liott, Tallant. and Adams are notable
examples. F. A. Adams was the first
1910 man who was taken into Phi
Delta Phi, he was made a member
the Press Club and Skull and Snakes,
and the only thing he ever did was to
be elected editor of the 1910 "Quad",
to putin bills amounting to about $100
before he had done any work whatever
on the book and then to quit college.
Reply of "Rugs" Falls Utterly.
Thus to review the points which we!
have brought out. we find the "Rug"
communication, (1) is dependent large
ly on the contenton that we have Inid
political motives in this matter; (2)
This T have shown to be absolutely un
founded; (3) as the contention is base
less, the weight of the whole article is
lost. .However, we have gone farther
iind have shown (4) that the entire
article is a collection of evasions and
misstatements; (.">) that the "Bugs"
have carefully and deliberately avoided
the real issues, and have attempted to
gloss over the important facts set out
in order to deceive the Student Body.
As T have already pointed out, the;
logical answer for Ihe Scaraboea to
make if it is a benefical or innocent
organization is for it to come out. and
state its purpose. That would certain
ly be a clear refutation of our charges'
if they are unjustified. None would
admit a mistake sooner than T if it
can be shown that. I am wrong. Bui
why does not this society state its
purpose? Its existence is known, its
members are known, but its purpose.-;!
have been questioned—certainly it-; !
objects could not be impaired by coming :
forward at this time and stating them.
Evidently the "Bug" is afraid. The re
port. was spread at. first that it.was a j
drinking society. This has been denied j
—although the denial consisted in th«
statements that the character of the
men showed that, it was not a drinking
society. It is obvious that such a con
clusion does not follow. It, has been

suggested that, it is for the purpose of
keeping the Row and Hall on good
terms. But of course the "Bug" couH
not admit that because that would lie
an admission of political manipulation.
WE are now at the point where the
issue is to he decided. The "Bug" is
fighting and will fight desperately f o
keep in power and to continue the Stan
ford of booze and graft. It is flic Sln
ili'i't Hoily's iiulit. What are yon going
1o ilo about it?
