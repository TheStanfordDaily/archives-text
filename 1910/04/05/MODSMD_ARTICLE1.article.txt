# R.J. MILLER CONDEMNS SCARABOEA
## Author of "Sequoia's" Political Articles Attacking "Bug" Society Writes Exhaustive Refutation of Recent Communication. 
### 
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
I desire as briefly as possible to
correct the false impressions whicn
the "Bug" Society attempted to create
by its article in the March 26th issue
of the Daily Palo Alto. The "Sequoia"
warned the Student Body in advance
that these men would try to avoid the
issue and cloud the facts advanced,
and they have made a long and sophis
tical attempt to do so. Their methods
in so doing have been three:
A By deliberately impugning the
motives of the "Sequoia" editors, ami
attempting to create a wholly false
impression that the articles were in
spired solely by the desire to advance
the political interests of an alleged
clique,
it By n tissue of fabrications which
they allege to be refutations of the
"Sequoia's" charges and proof.
C By ignoring some facts, by evad
ing others, and by glossing over the
points of political corruption and graft
which are the main issues.
Absurd Charges Made by the "Bugs."
A Consider now the first method
adopted by the "Bugs" in their at
tempt to evade the responsibility for
their misdeeds.
I The "Bugs" charge that the arti
cles were written for the purpose of
gaining political power. The absolute
absurdity of this charge appears upon
its very face. How could anyone for a
moment, imagine that two or three men
could be seeking to advance their own
prestige and to increase their political
power by attacking a whole system of
Student Body administration in a mari
ner which could only be expected to
antagonize the athletic element of the
University, which is recognized as the
powerful controlling part of the Stu
dent Body. Had we desired to make
political stock of the "Bugs" and their
organized political control, it would
have been a simpler matter to adopt
the underhand methods of these mas
ter politicians, to "talk things up,"
and to go around remarking, "Well I
want to know about these things"
which method is supposed to show
great, learning, and to indicate fore
sight at least "as long as their noses '
—to use the words of Mr. Fuller. We
have done none of this. We have pub
lished our charges, submitted our
proof, and signed our names thereto.
We have invited the ridicule, scorn,
and abuse of the indiscriminate ele
ments that, we have antagonized. We
have made no effort to compromise.
We have not tried to save anyone,
with such exceptions as Mr. Roth. We
have criticized wherever the "Bugs'
has showed its head, and we have
come out into the open and signed our
names. Can anyone say that by such
a method we were seeking to advance
our own interests? Our charges were
calculated to antagonze, but at the
same time to bring home a realization
of the need of a reform.
It is therefore obvious that we have
never at any time been acting with .»
view to political aggrandizement. In

proof of this we offer the following
further facts:
1. At the time of the commencement
of the controversy, Mr. Leaf was In
line for no other honor at the hands of
the Student Body than that of Editor
of the Daily Palo Alto. Mr. Leaf re
fused to run against Mr. Fuller who
was then an unpopular candidate.
Certainly it cannot be urged that he
had anything to gain by these articles.
2. Mr. Shelton already occupied the
office of Student Body President. The
only other office which it would be
possible for him to have in considera
tion would be that of graduate mana
ger. Mr. Shelton has repeatedly stated
to Mr. Burbank and others, that he has
never had any desire or intention to
run for this office.
3. No political motives were urged
against me in the Daily article. As a
matter of fact I was the only one of the
three who had been actively suggested
as a candidate. I have never had any
intention of running for any Student
Body office at the coming election.
Last December at the tme these arti
cles were planned, Mr. Leaf warned
me that I was giving up all chance of
Honor Societies and Student Body
offices by writing them. T realised thi«.
but was not only willing but anxious o
go ahead with them. I have never been
under any undue influence in the mat
ter, as the "Bugs" have falsely alleged.
I have never regretted my part in thp
controversy.
In view of the above facts which
were known by the men who wrote
the reply of the "Bugs", there is abso
lutely no ground for charging us with
a desire for political gain. The ef
forts of the gentlemen in this direction
have very evidently been with the idea
of clouding the issue, of turning at
tention away from the real points of
consideration. It is only another very
good example of their underhand
methods. As Judge Lindsey expresses
it."the beast has turned polecat" only
in this case it. is the Scaraboea that
has turned stink-bug, and has attempt
ed to save itself by besmirching others
By trying to show political manipula
tion on our part, by deliberately lying
about my motives and wishes in the
matter, they have hoped to hide the
unclean visage of the "Bug."
"Sequoia" is Not Inconsistent.
H. The "Bugs" also devote consid
erable space to an attempt to point
ou<; inconsistencies in the position of
the "Sequoia." The absolute jugglery
and sophistry of their attempts arc
barefaced in the extreme,
a. There is nothing inconsistent in
i the statements: 1. That the "Scara
boea Society is a menace to the Stu
dent Body and the best interests of
Stanford demand that it. be sup
pressed," and 2. "Our purpose is not
to convict either organization or in
dividual. but to acquaint the Student
Body with existing conditions, in order
that they may know what to expect,
and what to demand of their officers,"
