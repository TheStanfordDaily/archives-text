Graduate Manager Burbank to play
with the nine from St. Mary's College,
but yesterday word was received that
the president of the college had re
fused to allow the nine to leave the
Oakland campus and the Santa Clar.i
game was secured.
The fact that this will be the last
chance to see the Cardinal team in
action on the campus this year, as well
as the nearness of the field, should be
potent factors in inducing the mem
bers of the Student Body to contribute
the twenty-five cents necessary to ad
mission.

ably be the same as in the game played
