### 
R. R. Cowles, captain of the 1909
California track team and 11. S. Johns,
leader of the Blue and Gold team for
the present season, were on the camp
us yesterday afternoon. The two Blue
and Gold athletes had stop-watches
with them and gave close attention to
the performances of the men in the
Interclass meet. In discussing the
Varsity contest, Cowles stated that it
would, in his estimation, be one of the
finest exhibitions ever seen on the
Coast, and only by a narrow margin
would the winning team secure a vic
tory. Perhaps a third place would de
cide the day.
The two visiotrs wished it to be
understood that they believed the re
lay would be the event which would
turn the tide in favor of one side or
the other.
