# BURBANK MAKES RATE
## STUDENTS MUST ASSIST TO PREVENT LOSS. Graduate Manager Arranges Special Train for Benefit of Rooters Next Saturday. 
### 
A practical application of the inter
state commerce act which will bring
home to Stanford students in a prac
tical way the theoretical knowledge
gained in the department of economics
has recently been discovered, and is at
present causing Graduate Manager
Burbank no little thought. According
to notice recently given by the South
ern Pacific Railroad Company it is un
lawful for them to give the $1.10 stu
dents' excursion rate to San Francisco
at the time of a game, or on any other
occasion, unless it is guaranteed that
over 100 tickets will be sold for one
particular train.
In order that the members of the
Student Body may be allowed as
cheaply as possible to see the last
game of the baseball series which is
to be played in Berkeley Saturday af
ternoon, Graduate Manager Burbank
has guaranteed that 100 tickets will be
sold and lias made arrangements for a
special train, leaving Palo Alto at 10
o'clock Saturday morning, to carry
the Stanford contingent to the game.
The $1.10 rate is good on only this
one train going up, but the return
tickets are good until Monday morning
as in the past. It has been necessary
for the manager to advance a cash
guarantee for the amount necessary to
purchase the tickets and unless 100
students take this train the money
will have to come out of the pocket of
the Student Body. Naturally enough
under the circumstances Burbank de
sires that as many as possible leave on
the special so that the rate may be
secured without loss. Xo stops will
be made between Palo Alto and San
Francisco, which will lie reached by
11 o'clock, so that there will be plenty
of time to get to Berkeley
In addition to the special train at ten
o'clock there is to be a special car
service between the campus and Palo
Alto, two or three extra cars running
every fifteen minutes. Also there is
to be p. car waiting for 1 theatre
train to bring those arriving at this
time to the campus.
