# Morgan Resigns Chairmanship.
## 
### 
Because of the resignation of G. F.
Morgan, as chairman of the Senior
Play Committee, W. P. Fuller, Jr., has
been appointed by President Scott, to
direct the annual production. Morgan
found it difficult to remain at the head
of the committee and do justice to
other pressing work, and consequent
ly he submitted his resignation. The
new chairman will at once take mat
ters in hand, and push the arrange
ments for the production, so that no
delay will become evident because of
the change.
Morgan, however, will become a
member of the Senior Week Commit
tee, filling the vacancy caused by the
absence of T. C. Henry.
