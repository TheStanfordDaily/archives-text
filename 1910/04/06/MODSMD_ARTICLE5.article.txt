Those are the fourteen men who
will endeavor next Saturday morning
to duplicate the double victory of
Stanford student crews over the Cali
fornia rowers. That the choice of the
above men would be made has been
known for some time, but the an
nouncement was not issued definitely
until today. The coxswain for the
Freshman boat has not. been selected
and the choice rests between two men,
Guthrie and Marks. One of these two
will be picked tomorrow afternoon, in
order that he may go up with his
crew in company with the big eight on
Firday morning to Oakland, where, at
the California boat-house, the rowers
will get into final t) im for the strain
of the race the next day.
The oarsmen above are the members
of the Lagunita Boat Club which,
freely translated, means the Stanford
Varsity crew organization. Techni
cally, however, the oarsmen cannot be
called the Varsity, since they are not
officially recognized this year by the
University. The picking of the Boat
Club's crews this year has had to be
in the hands of the coaching com
mittee, composed of President J. C.
Huston, '10, and the three Coxswains
on the squad. J. W. Roberts, '10, F. L.
Guerena, Ml, and J. W. Howell, '12.
In the absence of a regular coach for
the lack of which the Club has ad
mirably shown its ability to substi
tute its own men. the crews have been
chosen by this coaching committee.
The Freshman fours are to have the
first race in the Saturday regatta.
They start at 10:15 for a one-mile
course, just half last year's distance.
The two big eights will set out on
their two-mile stretch as soon after
10:30 as is possible. The eights have
a shorter distance also, rowing but
two miles instead of three as last
year. The shortening of the courses
was mutually agreed upon by the two
boat clubs. In order that as large a
crowd as cau oe attracted to the race
may be at the estuary Saturday, the
club has made out. complete and very
detailed instructions as to the easiest
way to get to the scene of the struggle.
The full coui.se and these details will
lie published in tomorrow's issue of
I the Daily Palo Alto. A comparison of
| the four crews involved, with full
1 statistics as to their respective
weights, heights, and ages is to be
printed on Friday.
The California crews will be com
posed as follows:
Senior light—Bow, S. P. Colt, '10,
No. 2, B. B. Blake. '11; No. 3, I. G.
Markwart, '10; H. H. Ashley, '10; No.
