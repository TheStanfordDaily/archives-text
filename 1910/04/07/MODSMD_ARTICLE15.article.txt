# GIVES AID TO SOCCER
## EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE WILL ENCOURAGE NEW SPOUT. Men Appointed to Discuss Amendments, Boating Situation Considered, and Crawford's Mark Allowed. 
### 
A short meeting of the Executive
Committee last evening considered the
soccer situation, the amendment com
mittee for the Constitution of the Stu
dent Body, the crew prospects and sit
uation, and Crawford's record in the
hammer throw.
It was the opinion that soccer was
such a good foundation for Rugby and
would undoubtedly aid so effectively
in the future success of Rugby teams
representing the University, that it
was the duty of the Committee to offer
some material aid to the soccer teams
which are at present so creditably rep
resenting Stanford. It.was voted
therefore, that a sum of $40 be given to
cover the running expenses for the
past semester, and to encourage the
men for their work in the future.
The custom in the past has been to
make certain needed amendments to
the constitution of the Student Body
at the annual spring election. A com
mictee of three was appointed last
evening to look into and frame for that
election whatever amendments they
deem the situation demands, and re
port on the additions to the constitu
tion that are needed.
Since the abolition of boating as an
Intercollegiate sport there has been
considerable comment as to the suc
cess that the Boat Club was having in
handling the situation. This question
was thoroughly discussed at the meet
ing last evening, and although no defi
nite action was taken or official opin
ion expressed, it was the opinion of
the Committee that the status of boat
ing as carried on by the Lagunita Club
was almost all that could be desired.
It is not known whether the Committee
will take any definite action in regard
to boating in the fututre or not.
Another Stanford record has been
changed. The man to chalk up the
new mark is D. P. Crawford, '09, and
the event in which the record has been
granted is the hammer throw. At the
meet of March 26, Crawford threw the
hammer a distance of 149 feet and 5
inches surpassing the previous record
held by J. E. Wooley, '12, by a distance
of nine feet. This record was official
ly recognized by the Committee last
evening and will go down in the book
as a new Stanford mark.
