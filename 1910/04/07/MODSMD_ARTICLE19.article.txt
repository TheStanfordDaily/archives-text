# TEAM TO TRAIN HERE
## CALIFORNIA TRACK MEN TO WORK OUT ON STANFORD OVAL. H. Smitherum, '11, Recovering Rapidly From Injury.â€”Another Quarter-Miler Added to Training Table. 
### 
A delegation of the best that Cali
fornia has in the line of track and field
athletes will arrive here tomorrow
morning to make themselves acquaint
ed with the Stanford oval. Probably
it will be a little difficult for the Blue
and Gold contingent to become accus
tomed to the long straightaways of the
Stanford track after having been
educated to run continuously on a
curve. The Blue and Gold aggrega
tion will make the trip once again be
fore the Intercollegiate meet.
It will be good news to those who
have been watching the work of H.
Smitherum, '11, in the sprints, to know
that the speedy little runner will be in
first-class condition for the Varsity.
Although compelled to drop out of the
furlong in the U. S. C. meet, Smither
um did not suffer a breakdown and is
training now as hard as ever. C. C.
Taylor, '11, was added to the training
table yesterday on account of the good
showing he made in the 440-yard dash
in the Interclass meet.
A welcome innovation to the specta
tors at the big contest on April 16 will
be the change in location of the shot
put. Instead of taking place at the
farther end of the field as heretofore,
it will be held directly in front of the
grand stand in order to give everyone
an opportunity to view the work of the
men.
