# DR. JORDAN TO SPEAK
## PRESIDENT WISHES TO MEET UPPERCLASSMEN TUESDAY. Meeting to be Held in ('impel at 4 p.m. Important Matters Will be Considered. 
### 
Under the auspices of the University
Conference a meeting of all Juniors,
Seniors, Graduates, and Hold-overs,
both men and women, will be held in
the University Chapel on next Tues
day afternoon at 4 o'clock, on which
occasion they will have an opportunity
to hear from President D. S. Jordan
about a subject which is of great im
portance to the welfare of the Univer
sity. Both the Conference and Dr.
Jordan are desirous of a large atten
dance, as the matter which will be out
lined by the President is one which
everyone should understand thorough
ly. The matter is one which has been
brought forward informally to the
Conference but is of such a character
that all Upperclassmen should know
Although Dr. Jordan at present is
not ready to intimate the character of
the talk which he will make, it is un
derstood that he will deal exhaustively
with the purpose, the plans and the
workings of the University since its
founding and will show how intimately
all these considerations are bound to
the future well-being and existence of
the institution. It is a subject on which
he has been seriously thinking for
several years but it. has only been dur
ing the past few months that he has
thought it necessary to bring it before
the students. Although it is not abso
lutely imperative that he should take
the Upperclassmen into his confidence
in the matter, he believes that it is by
far the wiser policy so that there may
be absolutely no misunderstanding,
and so that the Student Body as a
whole will cooperate in the successful
working out of the plans to be dis
cussed.
