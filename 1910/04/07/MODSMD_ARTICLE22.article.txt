be given on the night of April 16 are
rapildly nearing completion. J. B.
Beaman, '12, and S. Brown, '13, will
appear in a skit, local in character,
which promises to be one of the suc
cesses of the evening. There will be
a musical number given by Miss M. L.
Ozier, '10, H. E. Reed, '10, and H.
Forbes, '13. The Football Show sex
tett will reappear, with the exception
of Miss A. Huntsberger, '10, who has
left college, but her place will be

New costumes have been ordered, and
pictures which will soon appear were
taken today. In this instance, how
ever, the sextette will appear alone, as
W. P. Fuller, Jr., '10, who was seen
with them last November, has been
denied permission to take part by the
Committee on Student Affairs.
Miss M. T. Howell, '10, will give
several monologues, at least one of
which will be local. There will also
be a short farce, " 'Op-o'my-Thumb,"
in which Maude Adams has appeared.
The farce is a very clever one, and is
rarely produced by amateurs. A. F.
Meston, '10, E. P. Bly, '13, and J. H.
Wiggins, '10, will be seen in an ex
hibition given by the Gym Club.
The program also includes a fancy
Butterfly dance given by Miss L. Cor

dance effective, as special costumes

There will probably be one additional
number on the program, the nature of
which has not yet been definitely de
cided.
Tickets for the vaudeville go on sale
at the usual places on Tuesday morn
