# ALTER COURSE OF RACE
## FINISH OF 1910 IS STARTING POINT OF 1901). Complete Details as to Method of Saturday's Boat Races on Estuary. Many Points of Vantage. 
### 
The big Inter-Club boat race of Cal
ifornia and Stanford eights and fours
on the Estuary next Saturday is to be
over an entirely different course from
that over which the rowers went last
spring. The Oakland Estuary straigh
away is to be used as usual, but the
finish is to be this year at the bridge
where the start was made in 1909. The
two-mile course, three -miles last year,
is to begin at the Berkeley boat-house,
the old ferry-boat "Amador," which is
opposite the Clinton Street station of
the S. P. railroad. The finish is at the
Park street bridge on the side nearest
the start. That is, the shell's how
that first passes the line of the bridge
toward Clinton Street wins. Specta
tors can secure splendid vantage
points at the edge of the bridge and
can thus tell to a fraction of a second
what crew is the victor. Other good
places for onlokers would be at each
end of the bridge along the banks of
the Estuary. The Boat Club has also
made out instructions for the easiest
method of getting to the scene of the
battle. To get to the finish point in
the quickest possible way, the S. P.
Oakland or Alameda train from the
mole station should be taken. Getting
off at 23rd Street, take the "Alameda"
trolley, a car with a white dial and
green star. This car goes directly to
the finish. It is probable that the $1.10
rate to Berkeley will be in effect for
all going to the races.
The 8:00 or the 8:36 trains are the
latest times for leaving Palo Alto in
order to reach the Estuary in time for
the first race, the Freshman, at 10:15.
The Boat Club sent the shells to the
Estuary today, so that they will be
ready to be used by both Lagunita
crews tomorrow. The two squads
leave the campus in the morning, stay
ing over until after the races.
