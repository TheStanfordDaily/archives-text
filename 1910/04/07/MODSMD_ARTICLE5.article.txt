# Track Men Ineligible For Conference.
## 
### 
A telegram was received this after
noon from Chicago announcing that L
Scott, '10, and H. L. Horton, '10, were
ineligible for the Conference meet this
summer. This, however, is not looked
upon as final and after our eligibility
rules are explained to the Eastern in
stitutions Scott may be reinstated.
