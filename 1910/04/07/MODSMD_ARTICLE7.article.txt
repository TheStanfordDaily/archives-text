Harris Weinstock, merchant, social
•worker, and economic student, de
livered his address on "The People's
Claim on the College Man" this morn
ing in the Assembly Hall. Professor
B. E. Howard introduced the speaker
as not only an interesting and pleasing
lecturer, but a public benefit.
All those who attended the assembly
were exceptionally interested auditors,
and this was due not only to the fact
that Mr. Weinstock had information to
give, .but that he assumed the position
of a personal friend, who was merely
here to explain something, and not to
create intense enthusiasm or be the
perpetrator of a sensation. In bring
ing his subject before the audience,
Weinstock declared that the people's
claim on the college man was purely a
matter of viewpoint. He elaborated
011 this phase of his topic by telling
two stories, which exemplified the
viewpoint of two classes of people, the
people interested in the welfare of
society and those interested only in
special interest, respectively. The
man who believes that dance halls for
immoral purposes should not be in
terfered with by law, because they
were built for no other purpose, and
consequently would be a loss to their
owner, was an example given by the
speaker to illustrate the latter view
mentioned. Continuing on the this
point, he included the college man. By
some he is considered a great factor in
life, by others a nonenity; it all de
pends on the viewpoint taken by the
person.
Mr. Weinstock, believes the real test
of the college man is what he accom
plishes after going into the world. If
he is a good citizen, he believes he has
accomplished much, as our democracy
is pivoted upon good citizenship, "but,"
declared Weinstock, "he is not neces
sarily a success if he is educated, as
morality and education are not always
found together."
"Courage, unselfishness, action, are
the qualities admired by the public,"
continued Weinstock, "and a univer
sity is the best place to get them.
There you get conceit knocked out of
you and are taught to respect."
In conclusion, the speaker made a
plea for good citizenship. "It is your
chief end, it is imperative in all walks
of life, and if you are such, many will
follow your action."
