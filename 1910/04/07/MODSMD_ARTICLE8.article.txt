# Beal Captain and Marks Coxswain.
## 
### 
C. H. Ileal who is stroking the Fresh
man four was this afternoon selected
by his team-mates to captain them in
the race against the Freshman four of
the University of California Saturday
morning. Other things being equal,
L. 11. Murks was chosen Freshman
coxswain because he was considerably
lighter than S. W. Guthrie, the other
aspirant for the position.
