# Athletes Will Strive for Supremacy
## OARSMEN WILL RACE ON ESTUARY Senior Eights and Freshman Fours, Representing Lagunita and California Clubs, Will Row Saturday Morning. 
### 
The Cardinal oarsmen are uncertain
as to who will carry off first honors in
the big inter-club boat races tomor
row. Up to a few days ago it seemed
that Lagunita was on the slate to
win by a good margin. This forcast
has changed materially, however, and
the probabilities are now even. In
the matter of rowers of the old guard
the Stanford Club has the worst of the
bargain. Captain J. C. Huston is the
only member of the eight who can
boast of a Varsity letter of the old
days when crew was a recognized
University sport. But the ease with
which the Sophomores took the Junior
Day race leads to putting a heavy
mark under the names of these four
men on the eight this year, together
with their two other class-mates. They
make up a fine machine, and, with
Hofer, the Freshman, at No. 2, and
the dependable Roberts to guide the
destinies of the shell, it is hard to see
why the Stanford crew hasn't a little
more than a fighting chance. Califor
nia's Rowing Club have four oarsmen
and coxswain who are veterans. These
include Captain Ashlev, Hardy, Mark
wart, Davidson and Coxswain McSpad
den. The stroke, Malatesta, is a Soph
omore of last year's Freshman eight.
Colt. Blake, and Ball were substitutes
in the season last spring. This crew
makes a very respectable enemy and,
unless some catastrophy similar to
last April ruins the struggle, there
should be some red-letter work on the
Estuary tomorrow morning. The first
race coming at 10:15 and the last
scheduled for finishing before 11
o'clock, the Estuary waters will be
calm and ready for a pretty race for
both crews.
The eight oarsmen and coxswain
who will take the Senior crew through
the race tomorrow are:
J. C. Huston, '10. captain of the crew
and President of the Lagunita Boat
Club. Three strong years on Stanford
Varsity crews, including his Freshman
year, when he rowed No. 4 on the big

eight, making up his record as an
oarsman. Besides this he has com
peted away from the Bay region, go
ing to Washington last summer, and
making similar trips before. This year
he is the mainstay and by all odds the
premier oarsman of the older crew,
rowing at No. 7. Huston's home is in
Buffalo, N. Y., and he majors in His
tory. He is 23 years old, stands 6
feet, 2V2 inches and weighs 175 pounds.
J. W. Roberts, '10, may almost be
called a member of the old guard.
While he never made his Varsity letter
in previous races, yet he has been
practically on a par with the other
coxswains on the rowing squad. He
led the 1910 Freshmen to victory four
years ago and has always been a hard
worker since. Roberts is from Red
lands, and majors in Economics. His
weight is 110, height 0:4, and age 22.
J. F. Partridge, '12, at stroke, is a
power 011 the eight. He made his 1912
numerals 011 the Freshman eight last
year, which defeated California. Part
ridge lives in San Rafael, and majors
in Civil Engineering.
No. C will be rowed by R. R. Gilmore,
'12, also a Freshman oarsman or' tl o
1909 season. He also made the trip to
the University of Washington regatta
last summer as a member of the Var
sity. Fair Oaks is his home and he is
a major in Electrical Engineering.
H. L. Dietterle, '12, .is another oars
man of the Washington crew, besides
being among the 1912 racers against
California last spring. His position is
No. 5. Dietterle lives in San Fran
cisco, and is a Pre-legal major.
A great aid in the boat is the former
1912 Freshman captain, C. L. Schaupp.
He has shown himself a splendid oars
man and is considered as one of the
strongest men in the boat. His home
is Santa Rosa, and his major Physi
ology.
R. H. Seward, '12, has the No. 3 oar.
He helped win from the Blue and Gold
first-year men in 1909 and has made a
good record. His home is in Los Ang
eles, and Economics is his major.
The only Freshman of the bigger
eight is L. Hofer, '13, who is on the
boards for the No. 2 place. He was
one of the four Freshman who made a
strong showing on Junior Day last.
His major is English and he lives in
Salem, Ore.
Bow position is held by R. R. Hails,
'12. Hails was a substitute for the
1912 eight against California in the
last Intercollegiate regatta, but he has
been doing well this year, and is reck
oned to be good in the bow. Santa
Barbara claims him a native and
Economics is his major.
Captain C. H. Beal, of the Freshman
crew, is understood to be the best
representative of the Freshman class
in the first-year boat, being elected to
lead them yesterday afternoon, lie
strokes the Freshman four. Palo Alto
is his home, and Geology his major.

eight is L. Hofer, '13, who is on the
boards for the No. 2 place. He was
one of the four Freshman who made a
strong showing on Junior Day last.
His major is English and he lives in
Salem, Ore.
Bow position is held by R. R. Hails,
'12. Hails was a substitute for the
1912 eight against California in the
last Intercollegiate regatta, but he has
been doing well this year, and is reck
oned to be good in the bow. Santa
Barbara claims him a native and
Economics is his major.
Captain C. H. Beal, of the Freshman
crew, is understood to be the best
representative of the Freshman class
in the first-year boat, being elected to
lead them yesterday afternoon, lie
strokes the Freshman four. Palo Alto
is his home, and Geology his major.
The Cardinal oarsmen are uncertain
as to who will carry off first honors in
the big inter-club boat races tomor
row. Up to a few days ago it seemed
that Lagunita was on the slate to
win by a good margin. This forcast
has changed materially, however, and
the probabilities are now even. In
the matter of rowers of the old guard
the Stanford Club has the worst of the
bargain. Captain J. C. Huston is the
only member of the eight who can
boast of a Varsity letter of the old
days when crew was a recognized
University sport. But the ease with
which the Sophomores took the Junior
Day race leads to putting a heavy
mark under the names of these four
men on the eight this year, together
with their two other class-mates. They
make up a fine machine, and, with
Hofer, the Freshman, at No. 2, and
the dependable Roberts to guide the
destinies of the shell, it is hard to see
why the Stanford crew hasn't a little
more than a fighting chance. Califor
nia's Rowing Club have four oarsmen
and coxswain who are veterans. These
include Captain Ashlev, Hardy, Mark
wart, Davidson and Coxswain McSpad
den. The stroke, Malatesta, is a Soph
omore of last year's Freshman eight.
Colt. Blake, and Ball were substitutes
in the season last spring. This crew
makes a very respectable enemy and,
unless some catastrophy similar to
last April ruins the struggle, there
should be some red-letter work on the
Estuary tomorrow morning. The first
race coming at 10:15 and the last
scheduled for finishing before 11
o'clock, the Estuary waters will be
calm and ready for a pretty race for
both crews.
The eight oarsmen and coxswain
who will take the Senior crew through
the race tomorrow are:
J. C. Huston, '10. captain of the crew
and President of the Lagunita Boat
Club. Three strong years on Stanford
Varsity crews, including his Freshman
year, when he rowed No. 4 on the big

eight, making up his record as an
oarsman. Besides this he has com
peted away from the Bay region, go
ing to Washington last summer, and
making similar trips before. This year
he is the mainstay and by all odds the
premier oarsman of the older crew,
rowing at No. 7. Huston's home is in
Buffalo, N. Y., and he majors in His
tory. He is 23 years old, stands 6
feet, 2V2 inches and weighs 175 pounds.
J. W. Roberts, '10, may almost be
called a member of the old guard.
While he never made his Varsity letter
in previous races, yet he has been
practically on a par with the other
coxswains on the rowing squad. He
led the 1910 Freshmen to victory four
years ago and has always been a hard
worker since. Roberts is from Red
lands, and majors in Economics. His
weight is 110, height 0:4, and age 22.
J. F. Partridge, '12, at stroke, is a
power 011 the eight. He made his 1912
numerals 011 the Freshman eight last
year, which defeated California. Part
ridge lives in San Rafael, and majors
in Civil Engineering.
No. C will be rowed by R. R. Gilmore,
'12, also a Freshman oarsman or' tl o
1909 season. He also made the trip to
the University of Washington regatta
last summer as a member of the Var
sity. Fair Oaks is his home and he is
a major in Electrical Engineering.
H. L. Dietterle, '12, .is another oars
man of the Washington crew, besides
being among the 1912 racers against
California last spring. His position is
No. 5. Dietterle lives in San Fran
cisco, and is a Pre-legal major.
A great aid in the boat is the former
1912 Freshman captain, C. L. Schaupp.
He has shown himself a splendid oars
man and is considered as one of the
strongest men in the boat. His home
is Santa Rosa, and his major Physi
ology.
R. H. Seward, '12, has the No. 3 oar.
He helped win from the Blue and Gold
first-year men in 1909 and has made a
good record. His home is in Los Ang
eles, and Economics is his major.
