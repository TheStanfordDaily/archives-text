# WILL APPEAR WITH SEXTETTE.
## S. Kennedy, '12, Will be Seen With Original Beauty Chorus in Coming Vaudeville Show. 
### 
The committee in charge ot' the
Field Meet Vaudeville which will he
placed on the boards here on the
evening of the Intercollegiate track
meet has been exceptionally fortunate
in finding a substitute to appear with
the famous Beauty Chorus. This
lucky discovery was made late yester
day afternoon when S. Kennedy, '12,
was found , and after deliberation,

made a favorable reply to the con
tinued overtures made by the commit
tee.
Kennedy recently took part in the
Sophomore Play "Secret Service," and
is known by the college community
for his ability as a soloist. Although
it. is expected that the Sextette will
come up to its previous standard, this
number will be radically different in
some respects than it was on its prev
ious appearance. The two main songs
to be featured are "What Am I Going
to Do to Make You Love," from Jolly
Bachelors," and"The Fishing Song,"
from the "Jay Musicians."
