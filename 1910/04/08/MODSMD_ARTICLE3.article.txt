# DECIDING BALL GAME IN AFTERNOON
## With a Victory Credited to Each, the Cardinal and Blue and Gold Nines Will Battle for Championship of 1910. 
### 
The chances are apparently pretty
even as to which team is slated to win
the deciding game between the Stan
ford and California nines at Berkeley
tomorrow. There is a slight advan
tage on the side of the Blue and Gold,
however, owing to their performance
of last Saturday. Yet the Cardinal
team is, contrary to discouraging ex
pectations lately, unimpared. Gilfil
lan, for whose return the possibilities
had been small, came back to the
campus from the south this morning,
news of his intention to return being
made known to Coach George Presley
in a telegram late last night. He ap
peared at practice this afternoon and
considerably raised the hopes of the
Cardinal, since otherwise Reed would
have had to bear the brunt of the
pitching alone, and, while in his finest
fettle he is capable of carrying off a
victory, yet with only one box man at
the coach's disposal, the position
would have been a hard one. Give the
Stanford team a hot day tomorrow and
they will win. If the twirlers can be
warmed up to the grade of pitching
that, they are capable of, with ordinary
sup; ort from in- and out-field the con
test will be a good one on every count.
The batteries of the two Varsities are
the only departments of the line-up

which may suffer change from last
Saturday. Word comes from Berkeley
training-house that Harris will pitch
only providing that his arm is back in
shape from an injury received this
week. It is safe to say that he is to
toe the rubber. Smith would other
wise take the slab. Whether Reed or
Gilfillan is to take the Stanford mound
will not be announced until tomorrow.
The Cardinals have been doing very
particular practice work the last few
days and will be in a position to make
things interesting at Berkeley.
The team leaves on the 10 o'clock
train tomorrow morning.
Line-ups have been announced by
the two coaches as follows: Stanford
Varsity—Catcher, Ganong (Capt.);
pitcher, Iteed, and Gilfillan; first base,
Ball; second base, McFadden; short
stop, M. Mitchell; third base, S. Mitch
ell; outfielders, Reed, Childs, Obear,
Cochran, McGregor.
California Varsity—Catcher, Stoner;
pitcher, Harris or Smith; first base,
Greenlaw, second base, Lewis; short
stop, O'Kelly; third base, Allen; out
fielders, Coane, Gay, Salisbury.
The game is to begin at 2:30 on the
grounds at Berkeley. "King" Brady,
as usual, is to hold the indicator.
