# Stanford Triumphs Over California
## CARDINAL CAPTURES DECISIVE GAME Sensational Ninth Inning Rally Adds Six Marks to Tallies of Stanford Team.—Final Score Reads 8 to 3. 
### 
After running along for eight chap
ters with practically even playing by
both Varsities, Stanford found Cali
fornia's underhand twirler, Harris, in
the ninth and knocked his reputation
into shreds with two three-bag clouts
and three good, square singles in the
1910 championship game at Berkeley
last Saturday, won by the Cardinal,
S-3. Where the game had been Cali
fornia's in the eighth by a 3-2 score,
the Stanford Varsity came up with
their last chance and made a garrison
finish long to be remembered, the five
hits in the last session, hitched up to
an error, mutilating the plate with six
beautiful tallies. This sum total of
scores, S-3, sent the Blue and Gold
dreams for the 1910 series down to
earth and completely out of sight,
the Cardinal coming off the field In
tercollegiate champions, two games
out of three. The contest was far re
moved from a pitcher's battle. It was
the mettle of nine men matched
against the mettle of nine others. The
pitchers were there on tlio mounds,
but their work was but ordinary. Reed
sent only two men back to the bench
011 strikes, Harris only one, and Gil
fillan, on the Cardinal rubber for Cal
ifornia's last mournful half of the
ninth, retiring none. Reed and Harris
each weakened but once on the base
on balls list; Reed had one wild pitch,
and Harris was guilty of giving one
man the initial sack with the "hit-by
pitcher" trade-mark upon him. In the
eight frame Stanford had considerably
the better of the fielding game, with
one bungle to California's three, while
in stick-work the Blue and Gold had a
shade the advantage, making seven
smashes to the Cardinal's five. But
the California team of the week before
was not in evidence on the diamond
last Saturday. Their errorless exhib
ition of the second match on April 2
was a memory only, and the uncer
tainties of baseball prophecy received
a little heavier underlining. The sit
uations in the two games were com
pletely reversed. Stanford this time
played up to their preliminary season
record, M. Mitchell's single mistake in
the last half of the opening chapter
being the only disturbing mark in the
Cardinal error column. The Blue and
Gold errors were three in number, the
chief performers in their making be
ing Stoner, O'Kelly and Greenlaw.
Of features there were apparently
dozens. Home runs would have had
their place 011 the score book had not
the California field been inclosed by
a high-board fence. Reed's triple in
the ninth and the similar performance
of Salisbury in the third both had to
be chopped off short at the intricate
corner, when the ball in each case
bounded away from the center-garden
wall. The home station was within
speaking distance at the time and
could easily have been reached had
there been no limit to the outfield.

The slam for three by M. Mitchell also
came near to being a homer, but was
not as close as the two previous. Then
there was the Cardinal McGregor's
double head-line nabbing ot' Green
law's fast fly in the second. The
score-keepers had already indented a
three-bagger on the books for the
lanky California man, when the Stan
ford lel't-flelder, making record time,
suddenly forsook the ground, and,
contrary to all laws of gravity, leaped
into the air and stayed there long
enough to lock up the speeding horse
hide in the very center of his glove.
Coane's somewhat similar catch of
Obear's drive in the fifth elicited ap
plause.
As to star work Captain Ganong'ff
play throughout the game, and partic
ularly behind the bat was a whirlwind
exhibition. In a single session he re
tired two men to the bench 011 fouls.
In another he sent McFadden home
for the first run of the Stanford total
with a two-sacker, and came across
the latter a moment later with motive
power furnished by S. Mitchell's one
sack liner to left. Captain Lewis of
California also deserves mention. His
action in the field was faultless and he
chalked up three singles out of four
times up.
Rooting by both universitiy cheer
ing-sections was splendid as far as
volume is concerned. The Stanford
yell-leaders should be given much
credit for their efforts at timely per
iods of the contest. The California
leaders and rooters, however, dis
played very regretable spirit in the
practice interval before the actual
playing began. They applauded and
approved very vigorously the occa
sional errors made by the Stanford
players now and then, while fielding
liners from the bat of Coach Presley
at the plate. This attitude of the Blue
and Gold was extremely unfortunate,
inasmuch as the fundamental princi
ples of sportsmanship require that, if
good playing by the opposing team
cannot be applauded, silence at least
should be kept during the time when
the outcome of the struggle is not at
issue.
Estimates place the number of
spectators present at between four and
five thousand.
The game by eventful innings:
California began their work exactly
as in the April 2 match. Allen tallied
first in both cases, in the opening ses
sion. This time he hit to center, took
the keystone on Reed's wild pitch, ac
cepted Coane's sacrifice to third, and
was sacrificed home by Salisbury's
bunt.
In the third again Salisbury hit for
three, and loped across behind Lewis'
single. Score, 2-0.
Stanford's turn came in the fourth.
McFadden was hit by Harris, and was
sent over the plate by Ganong's double.
Ball sacrificed the Captain to the in
tricate corner, and S. Mitchell brought
him in. Score, 2-2.
Tie until the eighth. Allen was the
chief actor for California again in this
frame. Transported by Reed, sent to
second by Coane's out and clouted to
the platter by Salisbury's hit to center,
is his story. Score, 3-2.
Game apparently lost when the
ninth chapter began. Stanford now
discovered the route usually taken by
Harris' underhander. Ball started
things moving by getting to first on 'i
half-hit, half-error by Gay in center.
This was finally judged to be a hit. He
went to second on S. Mitchell's bingle
to left. Cochran made first, fielder's
choice, Mitchell going out at the key
stone, O'Kelly to Lewis. McGregor
then lined through short, scoring Ball.
Following this, Reed's nifty rap sent
Cochran and McGregor tearing home,
and still Harris' underhand gave
Stanford the upperhand. Obear bunted
along third base line, and Harris, in a
difficult place, used bad judgment and
threw a hard one for Greenlaw to
handle, the runner being declared safe
at first and Reed tallying. But the
tale did not end here. M. Mitchell
made a dent in the left garden fence
with a hard-hit triple, and Obear
romped across. Then, just to empty
the liases, McFadden carried Mitchell
to the plate on a liner to Lewis. Gan
ong fiied out to Salisbury, making the
three.
California tried hard to do the trick
in their half of the ninth. O'Kelly got
to second by a double to left, but there
he stayed watching the plate longing
ly, while Greenlaw, Smith and Allen
futilely went out on popfiys from
Gilfillan's delivery, who had relieved
Reed for these three men. Final score,
8-3.
