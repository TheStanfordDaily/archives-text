# WYMAN AND STOLZ RUN FAST LAP
## Cover Quarter in Almost Even Time in Trial Dash Saturday.—Captains Arrange Entries. Rally Wednesday Night. 
### 
In order to chase away the ennui
caused by repeated rumors from
across the bay concerning the division
of points in the 440-yard dash, Wil
liam M. Wyman, '11, and Herbert. It.
Stolz, '10, set themselves the task on
Saturday afternoon of disabusing the
general public of the idea that the
Stanford quarter men are at all slow.
The trial race came off in an inter
val of the Palo Alto-San Jose field
meet and at the crack of the starter's
gun Wyman took the lead. Although
closely pursued by Stolz for the entire
distance, Wyman kept his lead and
finished a scant yard in front of the
versatile Senior. If California is able
to squeeze Butler or Johns into sec
ond place between this speedy pair of
men, it is certain that the time for the
event will he under the 50 mark.
Stolz' activities in the big meet will
probably be confined to the quarter
mile and relay race, although if he is
feeling especially fit, he may take a
couple of tries in the broad-jump.
The quartet of runners who will
make up the relay team is just as fast
a bunch of runners as can be secured
at any institution in the country, and
if California succeeds in annexing the
final events of the big meet, she will
be entitled to full credit. The four
men who are likely to compose the
team are W. M. Wyman, It. B. Carter,
H. It. Stolz and C. C. Taylor.
The annual send-off for the men
who will defend the Stanford colors
next Saturday will be held in the As
sembly Hall on Wednesday evening.
A rousing meeting is being arranged
for, and it is expected that the Stu
dent Body will lend every effort to
make the final appearance of the Var
sity team worthy of the struggle in
which they will participate.
Captain Scott has made the final
placing of the men who*on Saturday
next will endeavor to boost the Cardi
nal colors above the Gold and Blue.
Friday evening the captains of the
two rival teams met and discussed
mooted points in the rules, reaching a
satisfactory decision in every instance.
After coming to an agreement on the
rules, Scott and Johns, choosing al
ternately, attempted to place their
men most advantageously in the heats
of the shorter races.
Few changes were made in the regu -
lations, but it was decided to rigidly
enforce penalties incurred by attempts
to beat the gun. In the sprints a pen
ally of one yard will be inllicted for
each of the first two breaks, while the
third will disqualify. If the gun is
fired once there will be no recall.
Two false starts will disqualify in the
hurdle races and the knocking down
of three hurdles will bring the same
penalty. The entries in the various
events are as folloys
