# LAGUNITA CREWS WIN BOTH RACES
## Senior Eight Opens Up Gap of Four Lengths Over Rival Oarsmen, While Freshmen Easily Conquer in One-Mile Struggle. 
### 
The efficiency of the old Dan Murphy
stroke was again shown last Saturday
on the Oakland Estuary when the
Stanford Boat Club's Senior and
Freshman crews were at no time
headed by the California men, and
when victory finally came to Stanford
in each race by a lead of from three to
four lengths. The Senior crew, prac
tically know as the Varsity, hurled its
frail shell over the line at the Park
Street eleven seconds ahead of the Cal
ifornia men, a lead equal ling between
two and one-half and three boat
lengths. Stanford, averaging 36
strokes to the minute, went the ap
proximately two-mile course in nine
minutes flat. The rival boat club,
averaging 33 to the minute, were
never dangerous, and were not equal
to the Lagunita men either in endur
ance, form, or in the handling of their
stroke. The Freshmen four averaged
36 and won by 4 lengths. When the
stalwart Stanford rowers in the eight,
averaging pounds in weight, and
6 fiet, 1% inches in height, swept
across the finish mark, it brought
back the old Roman gladiator days as
far as perfect physiques were con
cerned, though it is hardly probable
that Roman gladiators ever met the
Carthaginians in a shell race. The
eight men and coxswain Roberts last
Saturday made up a wonderful sight,
and the few hundred students from
the two universities who took advan
tage of the chance were repaid by a
big margin for their appearance 011 the
scene. The Freshman going was not
as pretty as the Senior shewing. The
two big eights had been nearer perfect
in form. The California first-year men,
on the contrary, made up a sorry
sight. Their pull was uneven and the
oars were not together in that beauti
ful precision that makes a boat-race a
joy to watch. Stanford's Freshman,
while not being up to the form of the
eight, yet gave ample proof of their
hard work on muddy roads and the
icy lake during the long three rainy
months of winter. They had worked
hard and proved it. California had
worked in steady pace also, but did not
have the advantage of the five men
who made up the Stanford coaching
committee. The Freshmen had the
lead the whole one-mile distance,
starting out with a quarter of a length
advantage, equalling about three or
four strokes. In both races the crews
rowed with the tide. The course is
not a straight-away, though being
very nearly one. In the struggle of
eights the oarsmen first appeared, to
the watchers at the finish, at about
the one-mile mark, a point designated
by a ship midway in the course. The
Freshmen were in sight practically the
whole time. A twenty-two knot racing
motor-boat followed the crews in their
work, carrying Referee Dean Witter
of California and Starter "Huskey"
Guerena of Stanford, the former being

the Blue and Gold ex-Captain and
Coach of last year, and the latter hav
ing filled the position of 1909 Varsity
Coxswain in the Cardinal boat last
spring. Two eagle-eyed judges, sta
tioned on a launch about one-hundred
yards from the Bridge, were R. H.
Reynolds, '10, the 1907 and 1909 Stan
ford Varsity Captain, and O.H. Robert
son, of California.
The Senior race:
Sin rt
The crews caught the water at ex
actly the same instant, Stanford row
ing 40 to the minute and California 36.
Even with this disparity in stroke the
eights kept remarkably close together,
neither shell's nose going ahead of
the other for the first three hundred
yards.
The Half Mile.
Stanford, never falling below 36 to
the minute, here maintained their
splendid stroke of between 37 and 39,
and pulled away from California, and
at this stage of the battle laid the
foundation for their winning lead by
here acquiring a two-length advantage.
The Mile.
Strokes of both crews practically
same as before. Stanford's lead a lit
tle increased, though on rounding the
turn at the ship the men splashed a
little. They steadied up again, how
ever, soon after.
The Finish
For the last mile Stanford kept the
same lead, and, going 39 to the minute
took first honors from California, row
ing 37 or 38. The winner's finish was
strong and a lasting monument to en
durance. After posing for a picture
they pulled back over the course with
no apparent diminution in stroke, go
ing finely. Time of race: the mile and
seven-eights in 9 minutes flat. Aver
age stroke: Stanford, 36; California,
33. Highest, point of stroke: Stanford,
40; California, 38.
