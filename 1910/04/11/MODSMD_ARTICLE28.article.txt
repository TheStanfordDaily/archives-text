# FRANK NIETO DROWNS
## ANOTHER VICTIM CLAIMED BY THE WATERS OF LAGUNITA. Companion of Young Man Has Narrow Escape When Canoe is Suddenly Overturned. 
### 
Frank Nieto, a sophomore of Lowell
High School, was drowned in the
waters of Lagunita last Saturday
evening. Young Nieto is the son of
Rabbi Jacob Nieto and had made the
trip with a number of students to
attend the debate held in the Assem
bly Hall on that evening between San
Jose and Lowell.
Early in the evening Nieto, accom
panied by Daniel Honigsberger,
strolled to the lake where they de
cided to take a canoe ride. The
young men had been out for about
half an hour when cries for help were
heard toward the northwest corner of
the lake.
Allan Crary and Gerald Reed, who
were on the shore by the boat-house,
were attracted by the calls, and lost
no time in hastening to the scene.
When they arrived, Honigsberger was
struggling to keep alloat on the over
turned canoe, while Nieto could not
be found. The former was taken to
shore, and the search for young Nieto
begun.
Kenneth Dole, '11, was summoned
and he immediately set to work drag
ging for the body. The remains were
finally recovered, and the young man's
parents were notified.
According to Honigsberger, the
young men had been careless and had
turned over very unexpectedly. They
had not been entangled in weeds as
was reported. Nieto could not swim
at all, and his companion had very
little advantage in this regard. The

parents of young Nieto came to the
campus on Saturday evening and re
turned to San Francisco Sunday
morning with the body.
