defeated Mann, 6-3, 6-4, 7-5; Murray
defeated Mann, 6-4, S-6, 6-4. This
gives Morgan first place, Murray sec
ond and Mann third, and they will
play the California men of their re
spective ranking on next Saturday
morning.
Because of their superior team
work, Murray and Shaul will compose
the other doubles pair.
After a thorough try-out, Morgan
and Mann were selected as the first
doubles team because of their superior
team-work.
Both the singles men and the
doubles team are being materially
strengthened by the coaching of Paul
Hardeman, the formost player of the
Golden Gate Tennis Club of San Fran
sisco and one of the first ten in the
state. Hardeman has spent several
hours each day with the men during
the past week and will continue to
