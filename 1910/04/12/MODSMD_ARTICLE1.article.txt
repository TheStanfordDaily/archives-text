## DR. JORDAN TALKS UPON UNIVERSITY CONDITIONS. At Meeting of Upperclassmen This Afternoon the President Delivers Forceful Address. 
### 
Dr. Jordan's talk with the upper
classmen in the University Chapel this
afternoon dealt primarily with the
present and the future financial status
of the institution, with the standards
that the authorities are striving to at
tain and with the relation that the
alumni bear toward the maintaining of
these standards.
The speaker during the progress of
his talk showed how the University
had reached its limit of expenditures
and how the increase of expenses for
various departures that are needed by
the institution will mean the introduc
tion of one or more of three expedi
ents. Dr. Jordan outlined these as
follows: the disposition of handed
property, ultimately valuable but now
unproductive; aid upon the part of the
students; or the receipt of gifts from
the outside. It was shown that the
disposition of lands held by the Univer
sity and the sale of securities owned
by the Trustees would be inadvisable
from a business point of view.
Concerning the expedient of turn
ing to the students for help in finan
cial matters, Dr. Jordan remarked,
"Stanford has tried to give and will
probably continue to give free tuition
to all non-professional students and to
students in Engineering. It now
charges tuition fees in Law and Medi
cine only." The speaker explained
how one half of the whole amount
received by the Trustees as income is
paid to the teaching staff, while of the
rest, one quarter now goes to the re
storation of earthquake damages, of
which the Memorial Church will claim
a large share for some time. Of the
rest, one quarter goes for books and
equipment, another to taxes and the
rest to miscelaneous expenses.
Dr. Jordan showed how the average
cost per student for teaching and run
ning expenses was $350.00 per year,
which estimate does not include the
expenses attached to the keeping up of
the local grounds and the expenditures
upon the campus which do not yield
any returns to the University.
The needs of the University were
enumerated, including the erection
and the equipment of various labora
tories and the establishment of fellow
ships for advanced research. Dr. Jor
dan said concerning this need, "Most
of these things could be done in three
years if each student were required to
pay back each year what is each year
paid out for him in the matter of mis
cellaneous expenses and appliances,
over and above tuition."
"And in these matters the students
soon to become alumni should look
toward the future. Some day the gov
erning board will be made up of alum
ni. It, will then be your duty to help
the University out."
Dr. Jordan, after making the above
statement, laid special emphasis upon
the fact that at the present time the
Hoard of Trustees "are always ready to
receive, large sums or small, for gen
eral purposes, or for special purposes,
and on its ability to secure new en
dowments the final future of Stan
ford must depend." This readiness
upon the part of the authorities to ac
cept donations of this nature was
shown to arise from the fact that the
University is at the present time en
gaged in a group of scientific and ex
perimental ventures that call for the
expenditure of large sums. To con
duct these investigations and to keep
up this work in the scientific field of
work, additional endowments are at
the present time necessary. "Here we
need the help of the wealthy and phil
anthropic people of California. We
need endowment for Lane Hospital.
We need an endowment for other hos
pitals. We want $300,000.00 to estab
lish a school of tropical medicine for
the investigation of Asiatic diseases.
Stanford University stands for teach
ing and research, for teaching by
means of research and whatever sums
it will receive, it will loyally use for
its highest purposes," said President
Jordan in his concluding remarks.

which estimate does not include the
expenses attached to the keeping up of
the local grounds and the expenditures
upon the campus which do not yield
any returns to the University.
The needs of the University were
enumerated, including the erection
and the equipment of various labora
tories and the establishment of fellow
ships for advanced research. Dr. Jor
dan said concerning this need, "Most
of these things could be done in three
years if each student were required to
pay back each year what is each year
paid out for him in the matter of mis
cellaneous expenses and appliances,
over and above tuition."
"And in these matters the students
soon to become alumni should look
toward the future. Some day the gov
erning board will be made up of alum
ni. It, will then be your duty to help
the University out."
Dr. Jordan, after making the above
statement, laid special emphasis upon
the fact that at the present time the
Hoard of Trustees "are always ready to
receive, large sums or small, for gen
eral purposes, or for special purposes,
and on its ability to secure new en
dowments the final future of Stan
ford must depend." This readiness
upon the part of the authorities to ac
cept donations of this nature was
shown to arise from the fact that the
University is at the present time en
gaged in a group of scientific and ex
perimental ventures that call for the
expenditure of large sums. To con
duct these investigations and to keep
up this work in the scientific field of
work, additional endowments are at
the present time necessary. "Here we
need the help of the wealthy and phil
anthropic people of California. We
need endowment for Lane Hospital.
We need an endowment for other hos
pitals. We want $300,000.00 to estab
lish a school of tropical medicine for
the investigation of Asiatic diseases.
Stanford University stands for teach
ing and research, for teaching by
means of research and whatever sums
it will receive, it will loyally use for
its highest purposes," said President
Jordan in his concluding remarks.
Dr. Jordan's talk with the upper
classmen in the University Chapel this
afternoon dealt primarily with the
present and the future financial status
of the institution, with the standards
that the authorities are striving to at
tain and with the relation that the
alumni bear toward the maintaining of
these standards.
The speaker during the progress of
his talk showed how the University
had reached its limit of expenditures
and how the increase of expenses for
various departures that are needed by
the institution will mean the introduc
tion of one or more of three expedi
ents. Dr. Jordan outlined these as
follows: the disposition of handed
property, ultimately valuable but now
unproductive; aid upon the part of the
students; or the receipt of gifts from
the outside. It was shown that the
disposition of lands held by the Univer
sity and the sale of securities owned
by the Trustees would be inadvisable
from a business point of view.
Concerning the expedient of turn
ing to the students for help in finan
cial matters, Dr. Jordan remarked,
"Stanford has tried to give and will
probably continue to give free tuition
to all non-professional students and to
students in Engineering. It now
charges tuition fees in Law and Medi
cine only." The speaker explained
how one half of the whole amount
received by the Trustees as income is
paid to the teaching staff, while of the
rest, one quarter now goes to the re
storation of earthquake damages, of
which the Memorial Church will claim
a large share for some time. Of the
rest, one quarter goes for books and
equipment, another to taxes and the
rest to miscelaneous expenses.
Dr. Jordan showed how the average
cost per student for teaching and run
ning expenses was $350.00 per year,
which estimate does not include the
expenses attached to the keeping up of
the local grounds and the expenditures
upon the campus which do not yield
any returns to the University.
