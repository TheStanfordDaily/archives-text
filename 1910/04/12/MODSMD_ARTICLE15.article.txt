# URGES LARGE REUNION
## PIONEERS WILL REASSEMBLE ON ALUMNI DAY. Archie Rice, Secreatry of Class of 1895, Writes of Ancient Heroes Who Will Return.

Editor Daily Palo Alto:
It is up to me as secretary (some
how and without my knowledge ap
pointed) of the class of '95 to help
scare up a crowd for alumni day, May
21st. As a class, reassembled on the
old campus that day, we'll have noth
ing to sell, no profit to make. It will
be all outlay, except, perhaps, the in
lay at the noon hour, provided we have
change for the meal.
As I was one of the founders of the
Daily and helped to drag it safely
through the period when a certain or
ganized opposition tried persistently
to kill it as a harmful rival of the
weekly "Sequoia," possibly I might
now, after these eighteen years, be
justified in seeking dividends in the
form of publicity space for the old
class that did so much to make Stan
ford spirit and traditions. But, waiv
ing that, and getting down to news
values, can you not justify yourself in
the eyes of your parishoners by shoot
ing into your colums a little live dope
on the fact that this alumni day will
mark the fifteenth year since the
"Pioneers" poetically paced off the
farm and headed for everywhere in
search of a living?
Without a crowd a reunion is not
worth a whoop, no matter how fanci
ful the planned features; and a tame
commencement week is partly the
fault of a tame graduating class.
We cannot tell you of the present
age how great '95 really was; you are
too full of your own prowess, having
just won a brilliant baseball victory
and swooped well ahead of the Blue
and Gold over a long stretch of water.
There was a little boy named "Jack
Sheehan" in my day on the third
floor front of Encina and a red
cheeked, rotund country chap styled
"Phat" Downing. Both were victor
ious Varsity captains. Also, there
was a mighty man styled "Charlie"
Adams, likewise a Varsity captain.
This Adams was Freshman president
of '95; won seven first places out of
fourteen events in the first Stanford
field-day; was Varsity third base and
captain; and on only three days' no
tice, never having even touched a
football before in his life, he made the
first big Varsity team and played
guard, sitting up all one night to study
the rules and learn the signals! I
may be pardoned in mentioning that
he was "some man," even in those
days of surprises. He stood six feet,
had a biseps that loked like a man's
thigh, was the fastest sprinter in col
lege, and the strongest man too.
"Charlie" Adams and "Phat" Down
ing and "Jack" Sheehan, all Varsity
captains and '95 men, are coming
back with the rest of the '95 class base
ball team to rip things up on the rah
rah reservation next May. Up in Seattle,

as city attorney, is one Scott Calhoun,
as gray now as a badger, but younger
under the gray than any of your pres
ent-day Freshmen. He used to get
more dead-balls than any two other
men, deliberately taking the missile in
the slats whenever Stanford needed a
move and the umpire couldn't detect
the unfortunate dodge; and "Rope"
Calhoun was the greatest long-dist
ance slider ever on a Stanford team.
Then there's a lawyer down in Hono
lulu, Abe Lewis, the man with the
most baseball runs ever scored against
California, twenty-three in all, if that
counts anything in your days of big
ger numbers.
Sheehan is so sure that his old class
team can wallop the faculty or the
Senior nines that he doesn't worry
about that at all. The only thing
that concerns him is by how big a
margin he can hammer out a victory
against your proud Varsity.
Put one of your bright beginners on
this dope and let him hemstitch some
thing nicely censored and prosaically
above reproach for your columns. If
you assimilate this I'll pass you some
more as needed.
