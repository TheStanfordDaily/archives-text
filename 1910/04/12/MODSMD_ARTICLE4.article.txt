### 
Preparations for the Field Meet
Vaudeville have now been concluded
and everything is ready for the raising
of the curtain for the first of the eight
big acts which will be produced by
this company on the evening of Satur
day, April 16. The seat sale this
morning was exceedingly large, over
130 seats being sold in Palo Alto
thirty minutes after the box office had
been opened, while on the campus
this number was doubled before 9
o'clock.
The program of the vaudeville is
not only unique and clever, but it con-

tains many stunts which will take on
a local shade for many of the specta
tors. Messrs. James, and Mathieu
who have charge of the program are
intensely interested in the acts, and
declare each and every one to be a
house raiser.
At the present writing the manner
in which the program will be carried
out has not been decided upon, except,
that it will be divided into two sec
tions, and that the Yell Leaders will
entertain the crowd by leading the
Varsity cheers prior to the raising of
the curtain, and various intermediate
times.
The skit to be played by Beman and
Brown is original and contains some
of the best local knocks, or joshes,
just as you would interpret them,


Miss 31. L. Ozier, '10, in Vaudeville,
that has ever been put on the boards
at Stanford. Without doubt these two
men will keep the audience in a jolly
mood throughout their entire act.
Some of the prominent, semi-promi
nent, and would be prominent students
will again come in for their share of
enlightenment during the skit pro
duced by Miss M. L. Ozier, '10, H. For
bes, '13, and H. E. Reed, '10. This act
also contains a number of original
songs written by Weston Wilson, '13.
Miss M. T. Howell, '10, in "A Tailor
Made Suit" will please the vaudeville
enthusiast, and also the critic. Miss
Howell's act is catchy, and exception
ally entertaining.
The quartette which will appear is
composed of Messrs. Sampson, Mattos,
Pettigrew, and Chase. They will ren
der a number of songs appropriate for
their act, some of which are said to be
extremely localized.
Gymnastic turns will be done by
the Gymnasium Club. The act will
contain largely mat work, and some
dumbell swinging stunts.
The famous beauty chorus will ap
pear again Saturday evening with the
announced change. Two of the latest
songs will be sung.
"Op-O-My Thumb," the famous
Maude Adams farce will be seen. Miss
G. D. Workman, '12, and R. H. Seward,
'12, will appear. The farce is a diffi
cult one, and its presentation is re
markable.
Last, but not least, will be the But
terfly dance by Miss L. Corel la and
eight assistants. This will be the first
time the dance has ever been seen
upon the Assembly Hall stage.
