# LARGE TICKET SALE
## FIELD MEET VAUDEVILLE WILL BE WELL ATTENDED. Preparations For Eight Acts Have Been Completed.â€”Local Hits Will be Featured. 
### 
Preparations for the Field Meet
Vaudeville have now been concluded
and everything is ready for the raising
of the curtain for the first of the eight
big acts which will be produced by
this company on the evening of Satur
day, April 16. The seat sale this
morning was exceedingly large, over
130 seats being sold in Palo Alto
thirty minutes after the box office had
been opened, while on the campus
this number was doubled before 9
o'clock.
The program of the vaudeville is
not only unique and clever, but it con-

tains many stunts which will take on
a local shade for many of the specta
tors. Messrs. James, and Mathieu
who have charge of the program are
intensely interested in the acts, and
declare each and every one to be a
house raiser.
At the present writing the manner
in which the program will be carried
out has not been decided upon, except,
that it will be divided into two sec
tions, and that the Yell Leaders will
entertain the crowd by leading the
Varsity cheers prior to the raising of
the curtain, and various intermediate
times.
The skit to be played by Beman and
Brown is original and contains some
of the best local knocks, or joshes,
just as you would interpret them,
