The Daily Palo Alto is in receipt of
a communication from an undergradu
ate who urges that the Executive
Committee take immediate action in
regard to the renting of canoes on
Lake Lagunita. Beyond a doubt, some
immediate action is necessary. The
indiscriminate hiring of the frail craft
is a custom which has been attended
by evil and sorrowful results.. Scarce
ly do we recover from one shock when
another, still more terrible, overtakes
us. We do not believe that all canoes
need be driven from the lake. Little
harm has come to owners who pre
sumably are able properly to navigate
their own craft. But it must be no
longer possible for anyone and every
one who so desires to rent a canoe and
act as he pleases with it on the waters
of Lagunita.
