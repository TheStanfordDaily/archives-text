# JAMES TO DIRECT MUSIC.
## Rehearsal of Musical Acts Under Professional Direction Proves Big Success. 
### 
Yesterday afternoon the musical acts
of the Field Meet Vaudeville were re
hearsed under the direction of Mr.
Harry James, the professional musi
cal director of San Francisco. All
indications are that the musical fea
tures of the vaudeville will exceed
anything in this line ever offered in
the past at Stanford.
The Sextette which will be led by
S. Kennedy, '12, have arranged to
present two new songs, the names of
which have not been given out for
publication, while the songs to be
rendered by the musical trio consist
ing of Miss M. L. Ozier, '10, H.. E.
Reed, '10, and H. Forbes, '13, will be
largely those written by Weston Wil
son, '13.
Probably there is not an act on the
program that has been receiving as
much favorable comment as the Rut
terfly dance that will be featured by
Miss Lolita Corella. The current in
terest in this number will probably
give it a prominent place on the pro
gram.
The net receipts from the Field Meet
Vaudeville will be donated to the Wo
man's Club-house fund.
