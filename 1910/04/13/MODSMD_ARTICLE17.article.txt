# "OUAD" WILL BE READY
## PRESS WORK ON ANNUAL IS ALMOST CONCLUDED. Printing is Exceptionally Finished. Sale Will Occur May 2.â€”Campus Supply Limited. 
### 
The 1911 "Quad" will be off the
press by a week from today and ready
for the bindery. The rest of the
month will be spent in binding the
book and letting it dry and set. It is
planned then to put it on sale Mon
day, May 2, at the regular price of
$2.50.
The big presses have been steadily
at work for the last three weeks print
ing at the rate of two sixteen-page
forms a day. The last form was sub
mitted by Editor L. L. Hill today and
with this, the work of the "Quad"
Board is entirely completed. Nothing
now remains but to print the last
150 pages and bind the volume.
The quality of printing being fur
nished by the H. S. Crocker Co., is
declared by those who have seen the
work as it has progressed, to be with
out doubt the best appearing in any
"Quad." Not only has this well
known firm maintained its reputation
for the highest grade of work, but it
has seemingly taken special pains to
make the 1911 "Quad" the finest ex
ample possible of the printer's art.
No night work has been done and
fully a month has been spent on the
press, thus assuring an entire ab
sence of rush work. The engravings,
as finished by the Sierra Art and
Engraving Company, were of such a
high grade that it has not been a mat
ter of great difficulty for Crocker &
Co. to do their best. The pressmen, in
order to prevent the slightest smudg
ing or smearing of the ink, have
placed blotting paper between every
sheet printed.
The color work of the frontispiece
and dedication page have also been
finished and are especially pleasing.
Both are the work of A. P. Hill, '13,
and are as good as could be procured
in the professional field. The former
is in three colors and the latter in
two and the harmony scheme as de
vised by Art Editor F. E. Hill, '11, is
exquisite.
Business Manager C. A. Christin
announces that under no considera
tion will the 1911 "Quad" ever be sold
for less than the original price of
$2.50. So much more expensive has
been this Junior annual owing to its
many new and novel features, that it
will be impossible to sell for less.
Each volume costs more than $6.
Only 800 copies have been printed,
of which 75 have been engaged by the
students at Cooper Medical College.
270 copies are paid for by the Junior

class, approximately 100 go to ad
vertisers and the complimentary list,
thus leaving only 355 copies for the
remainder of the Student Body.
