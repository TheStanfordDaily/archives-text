# Good Attendance at Ball Games.

### 
Upon the receipt of advises from the
University of California, Manager D.
W. Burbank was enabled today to an
nounce definitely the attendance at
the three baseball games of the Inter
collegiate series just closed and the
exact amount of Stanford's profits.
The crowd attending the first game
of the series, played here, numbered
729; the attendance at the second
game, played at Berkeley, was 2100,
and the people witnessing the final
game totalled 2892. The comparative
smallness of the attendance here is
due, it is thought, to the inclement
weather which prevailed at the time.
Stanford's share of the gate receipts
amounts to $1390.55.
