### 
The debating - interests of the Uni
versity will join hands with the ath
letic interests this week-end and do
their share in digging still deeper the
Bear's grave. The initial spadeful
will come to the surface at eight
o'clock Friday evening and the job
will be finished by ten when Stanford
receives the decision over California
in the seventeenth annual Intercol
legiate debate.
The Cardinal will be upheld in the
coming contest by as experienced a
trio of veterans as ever represented
Stanford. .T. E. Shelton, '10, a member
of two Carnot teams and one Inter
collegiate, G. F. Morgan, '10, a mem
ber of one Intercollegitte and two
Carnot teams, and P. J. Batkin, '10, a
veteran of one Intercollegiate and one
Carnot will speak in Assembly Hall
upon the affirmative side of the ques
tion: "Resolved, That in the United
States the suffrage should be extended
to Women."
California will be represented upon
the negative by two veterans and a
novice. N. B. Drury, '12, the winner
of this year's Carnot medal will speak
as will F. M. Shipper, '12, a member of
the 1910 Carnot team. The new man
is a Freshman by name, J. J. Miller,
who has a reputation of being an able
debater.
Those having the arrangements of
the debate in charge are in hopes
that the Student Body will support
the Stanford trio in large numbers
and in hearty spirit. Morgan, Batkin
and Shelton have been preparing
faithfully upon the subject to be de
bated for over a month and are well
prepared to put forth their best ef
fort for the University.
Batkin will speak first on the af
firmative and will be followed by
Shelton and Morgan in the order
named. Shelton will give the rebut
tal and judging from his previous per
formances in this capacity, there can
be no doubt of his ability to effectually
curb the arguments of his opponents.
The judges of the debate have not
been fully agreed upon by the two
Intercollegiate committees as yet, but
their names will be announced before
Friday night. President D. S. Jordan
has been asked to preside.
