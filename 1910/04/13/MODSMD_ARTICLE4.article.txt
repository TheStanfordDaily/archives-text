# AVERAGES ARE HIGH
## McFADDEN LEADS SEASON WITH SCORE OF 402. Captain Ganong Hits Best in Intercollegiate Contests With Berkeley. Complete Percentages. 
### 
The Cardinal Varsity's batting and
fielding averages for the California
series and the complete record for the
season, including the big series, given
below represent to the followers of the
Stanford nine just what has been the
ability of the sluggers and the fielders
for the past three months. The per
formances of the team are a bit of
history, and of extremely pleasant
history. An examination of the record
of the games played discloses the fact
that the team was an unusually heavy
bunch of hitters, with a record rarely
equalled by amateurs. McFadden, the
big second baseman, heads the batting
list with an average of .402 to his
credit, out of 77 times at bat having
obtained 31 hits. Captain Ganong is
second with an average of .266 after
his name, having been at the bat 64
times and obtaining 17 hits. Obear
and Childs are tied for third honors,
each having .250.
The record for the Intercollegiate
series is interesting. Childs takes the
head of the batting list. He handled
the hickory twice in the first struggle
with California. He did his duty once
with a sacrifice, and the second time
rapped out a hit, the first in Califor
nia's unlucky thirteenth. This gives
the left-fielder one out of one, or an
average of 1,000. Captain Ganong's
strong stick work is down in heavy
black and white, for the whole three
games. 14 times up and 5 hits made,
averages .357. Reed isn't far behind,
with .333. McFadden, Ball and Coch
ran each have .250. Gllfillan and Mc-
Gregor are at the .200 mark, while the
rest of the eleven men on the Varsity
squad are under that average.
In their fielding the team has not
been so fortunate, none of the fielding
averages being exceptionally good
even for an amateur team. Ball heads
the list of fielding averages with .965
to his credit, with Obear second with
an average of .941.
