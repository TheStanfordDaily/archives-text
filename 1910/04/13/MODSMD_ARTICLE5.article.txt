# SPRINT FAST TRIALS
## COLEMAN AND REED SHOW CLASS IN THE DASHES. Bamboo Poles Secured For Vaulters. Stanford Will Occupy New Training House. 
### 
In his last trial race before the big
meet T. L. Coleman, '12, last evening
reeled oft the century in 10:1. The
speedy sprinter is now in the finest
trim of his life and will merely do
enough work during the next few
days to keep in condition. With Cole
man, Smitherum and Reed, the Cardi
nal has a pretty fast trio of sprinters,
and it is safe to say that the man that
heads them will have to come close
to the 10 second mark. Reed has been
working faithfully during the past few
weeks and shows every evidence of
a return to his old form. While the
record-holder has not as yet covered
the full hundred yards under a watch,
he has run the fifty-one yard dash in
5:3. Evidently Reed has not lost his
old knack of fast starting.
For a time it was feared that our
champion pole-vaulters, Scott and Bel
lah, would be without the advantage
of the use of bamboo poles in the Var
sity meet. Captain Scott, however,
expects some new poles from St.
Louis at any moment, and even if they
do not arrive in time suitable sticks
can be procured in Los Angeles.
Trainer Moulton is gradually dimin
ishing the work of the men and Friday
will be a day of rest for the athletes.
Tapering off work in this manner, the
men will be capable of greater exer
tion on Saturday than if they had
continued their regular training
throughout the week.
Graduate Manager Burbank is us
ing every effort to make the track
ready for the big affair. Several men
have been at work during the past few
days harrowing the cinder path and
getting it into the best of condition.
Although the new training-house will
not be entirely completed by Saturday,
the contractors promise to have sev
eral rooms ready for occupancy by
that time. The Stanford team will
make the new building its head
quarters.
