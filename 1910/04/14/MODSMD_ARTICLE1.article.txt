# WILL DEPEND ON THIRTY-ONE MEN
## Critical Review of Work of Individual Performers Who Will Wear the Cardinal In Saturday's Intercollegiate Track Meet. 
### 
Nightly around a table at the Inn
gather the thirty-one men upon whom
Stanford rests her hopes for victory
next Saturday. Although many good
athletes are not among this number,
it is safe to say that almost all of the
points gathered by the Cardinal team
in the big meet will be the result of
efforts made by the thirty-one.
Seven members of the Freshman
class are counted among the promis
ing athletes. However, no one need
entertain fear that the first-year men
will become nervous, as all have had
considerable experience on track and
field. W. Argabrite and G. S. Horine,
the two Freshman leapers, had envi
able reputations as athletes prior to
their entrance in college. Argabrite,
single-handed, captured second-place
at a Y. M. C. A. track meet held in
Seattle during the recent exposition.
Horine was touted as a wonder while
still attending Palo Alto High School
and has certainly lived up to the repu
tation which preceded him. To this
human grass-hopper a leap of six feet
is a mere trifle.
A young hurdler of great promise
entered Stanford when Eugene Kern
registered in this institution. A record
of 25:2 stands to his credit in the 220-
yard hurdles and the Freshman may
duplicate this feat on Saturday. E. V.
Ruddick is another hurdler enrolled
with the Freshman class. Ruddick
made a name for himself as a wonder
ful all-round athlete during his pre
paratory days, but this year he has
experienced some difficulty in getting
into condition. "Jimmy" Leaman, L.
H. Price and N. R. Ferguson are the
contribution of the class of 1913 to the
middle and long distance events. Lea
man and Ferguson are two likely men
in the half, while Price has astonished
everyone with his running in the mile.
He goes into fast company on Satur
day but may spring a surprise and
score.
The "Old Guard," comprising the
veterans, is led by the captain of the
team, Lee Scott. An expert in his de
partment, Scott is entirely dependable
as was shown by the performance in
his Freshman year, when he won two
Varsity sweaters on the same day by
playing on the Varsity nine and win
ning points in the field meet. Outside
of his individual work as an athlete,
the leader of the track men lias bent
every effort towards the betterment of
the team and if, on Saturday, a win is
scored, a great deal of the credit goes
to him.
A fitting team-mate to Scott in the
pole-vault is S.H. Bellah, '10, erstwhile
Olympian athlete. A pretty contest
for first position will take place be
tween these two men if Bellah does not
save himself for the broad jump-. C. A.
Waring, '11, is the other pole-vaulter
on the list. Waring already has the
honor of wearing a block "S," having
tied for third place in his Freshman
year. He has a good chance to take
the third position again Saturday.
T. L. Coleman, '12, H. E. Reed, MO,
and H. Smitherum, '11, are their names
and they are a wee bit fast in the
sprints. Coleman is a Los Angeleno,

who used to have his name appear
regularly in the papers as conquering
all the local talent in the dashes. Seek
ing new fields to exploit, the lengthy
sprinter accepted Dr. Elliott's invita
tion to register here and again is
back to his old tricks. Reed is a
wonderful sprinter, holding the Stan
ford record for the century, hut acci
dents prevented him from competing
in the last Intercollegiate meet. This
year he has eluded his hoodoo and at
the present writing is safe and sound.
The last of the trio, Smitherum, ac
cording to "Dad" Moulton is the most
concientious athlete whom the veteran
trainer has ever handled. The stocky
little runner has increased his speed
easily one-fifth of a second by hard
training during the present season.
For three years now has W. M. Wy
man showed his heels to California
quarter-men, and with H. R. Stolz, '10,
R. B. Carter, '12, and C. C. Taylor, '11,
forms a quartet of 440-yard men hard
to beat. Stolz needs no introduction
to the college world as his name and
fame are known to all. With the ex
ception of Wyman, the runner who
now shows the greatest possibilities in
the one-lap event is R. B. Carter. Both
Taylor and Carter were unable to com
pete last year on account of illness.
A. Johnston is the half-miler on the
list of veterans. Through a misunder
standing Johnston was prevented from
completing the race in the last big
meet but has often demonstrated his
ability to cover the route. In the mile
run, W. S. Porter, '11, and A. S.
Brown, '12, will be contenders. Porter
captured this event in his Freshman
meet but was not in training last year.
Brown is a new man to Varsity con
tests and promises well. He was a
member of the 1912 Freshman team.
With J. E. Shelton, '10, among their
number, the two-milers should fare the
best of all the boarders at the training
table. Slielton's companions are W. E.
Newman, '12, and E. C. Templeton, '10.
both have had experience in Varsity
contests, Newman last year winning
the event in record time.
The men who deal with the weights
are H. L. Horton, '10, the veteran of
many meets, K. L. Dole, '11, M. P.
Youker, '10, and J. E. Woolley, '12,
This season marks Dole's first appear
ance on the track and though lacking
in form, he is doing remarkably well
with the shot. Points in the hammer
throw depend on the ability of Woolley
and Youker. Woolley took second to
"Babe" Crawford in last year's contest.
Youker has participated in several
Intercollegiate meets but has never
succeeded in getting in a fair throw.
The sole veteran hurdler that Stan
ford possesses is W. D. Peaslee. This
will be Peaslee's fourth and last Var
sity meet. He is one of the holders of
the Intercollegiate record of 15:4 for
the 120-yard hurdles. H. V. Poor, '10,
C. TT. Tallant, '11, and B. Wallace, '12,
are men scheduled to enter the hiE.li
and broad jumps. Poor is an "S" man,
having competed against California
for several years. Wallace and Tal
lant are new to the game, and will
make their how on Saturday.
