"Now, 1 want you to understand thai
the California students are good, clean
sportsmen. When we left three names
off of our track eligible list, and asked
them if we could put three on the list
after it had been sent up, they said.
'Certainly, put them on.'"—Dr. Frank
All gel 1, Chairman Faculty Committee
on Athletics.
.."We ask you to fight hard, to fight
clean, and we know that you will win."
—Student Advisor A. E. Roth, to the
track team.
The track team, Captain Scott,
Trainer Moulton, and the other two
speakers of the evening were cheered
to the echo last night by an Assembly
Hall full of men and women in the an
nual track rally, held in preparation
for.the big dual meet with California
on the Stanford oval next Saturday
afternoon.
When at ten minutes to eight the
track training table men filed into the
hall down the center aisle, led by
Captain L. S. Scott and Trainer Moul
ton, into their seats in the front rows,
the cheers and other noisy proofs of
confidence in the team were continu
ous for a full five minutes. When the
uproar had subsided a "big Varsity"
and the "New Spell" that followed
shamed all the previous efforts from
hundreds of throats. Then "Dad"
Moulton arose, and, in facing the
crowd, said that his being called upon
to make a speech was "rather unex
pected." After the applause and laugh
ter had died away from this sally, the
veteran trainer went straight to the
serious part of the rally, saying, "I
suppose it is my duty to tell you what
the team is, and how it is."
After he had asked that the members
of the team be kept quiet everywhere,
he continued, "The team is coming
through in as good a way as T ever saw
as large a bunch of men. It, seems im
possible that so many men should
have no accidents, but it is true, and
I can see 65 points in this meet."
After the noisy approval of this had
passed, he went on, "In these 63
points for our total, California lias
two chances to better their points,
while Ave have 5. This looks about
5-2, unless their horseshoe is better
than ours and I don't think that it is.
Then, again, we have a game bunch.
We have 15 men near to a Coast
record. One holds a Coast record, and
one holds the Intercollegiate record
of America. Everything looks favor
able to me. We are at home, are led
by a good captain, and we're going
to win."
A "railroad" and an "L. S. J. U."
met the end of "Dad's" talk, and the
building shook with the cheers. Cap
tain Scott and Roth followed. Scott
said, "Whichever way the meet goes
Saturday, the Stanford Student Body
should not be ashamed of its team."
Roth made the big point in his speech
deal with the question of support from
the bleechers, "with cheers of encour
agement, not groans of disappoint
ment when the high-jumper fails to
clear tho bar." He ended with the

words quoted at the head of this col
umn.
Dr. Angell's comments were the best
of the evening. He entertained the
crowd with a few humorous refer
ences, including matrimony, and then
went, to the root of the matter in hand
with, "We've got everything fixed, the
track, the track-house; we have the
best trainer in the United States, and
we have a first class, sympathetic cap
tain. It's up to you track men to
make good, and we expect you to
make good."
He ended with: "When we get to
gether Saturday let us be Stanford
men, not as 'bugs,' or as against
'bugs,' but as Stanford men."
