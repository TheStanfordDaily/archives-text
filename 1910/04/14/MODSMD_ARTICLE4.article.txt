# FORENSICS TOMORROW
## INTERCOLLEGIATE CONTEST IN, ASSEMBLY HALL. Women's Suffrage Question to be Argued in Seventeenth Annual Dehate Between Universities. 
### 
Tomorrow evening at 8 o'clock in
the Assembly Hall will be held the
seventeenth annual Intercollegiate
Debate. If the volume and genuine
ness of the support of the Student
Body will equal that of the ability and
determination of the Stanford team to
win, there can be no question of
result of the judges' decision.
The score as it now stands is a tie.
Each of the rival Universities have
won eight Intercollegiate debates. The
winner of tomorrow night's contest
therefore, will bring up one of the two
institutions as the leader in the gen
eral series. The last Intercollegiate
won by Stanford was in 1908, with a
team composed of J. E. Shelton, '10,
L: Craven, '09, and G. D. Ferreli, '09.
The 1909 debate with G. F. Morgan, '10,
A. C. Stelle, '09, and . J. Batkin, '10,
resulted in a defeat by a very close
margin.
As stated before, Stanford is repre
sented by a thoroughly competent vet
eran team composed of P. J. Batkin.
'10, J. E. Shelton, '10, and G. F. Mor
gan, '10, who will speak in the order
named. They will uphold the affirma
tive side of the question: "Resolved,
That in the United States the suffrage
should be extended to wdmen." Op
posing them will be the Blue and Gold
trio, composed of N. B. Drury, '12, F.
M. Shipper, '12 and J. J. Miller, '13. Tt
will be interesting, in view of the
class numerals of the two teams, to
witness a debate between three Sen
iors and three Underclassmen.
It is understood that a large number
of rooters will accompany the Califor
nia team to the campus, thus adding
much to the excitement of the evening.
Col. Harris Weinstock is the only
judge so far, who has been agreed
upon by California and Stanford. Sev
eral other prominent San Franciscans
have been asked to serve and their
answers are expected at any time.
The three men who will present the
argument for Stanford are all ex
perienced debaters. G. F. Morgan is
a fluent speaker who possesses a ready
ability to present his side of a proposi
tion in the most convincing light. The
"Chaparral" man is well-known to
the calcium, having been a member of
last year's team, and he also has de
bated for the Carnot medal on two oc
casions.
J. E. Shelton, '10, has taken an ac
tive part in debating since his Fresh
man year and has met with great suc
cess in this work. The Carnot medal
was secured by Stanford last year
through the splendid oratorical effort
of this debater. P. J. Batkin, '10, is
the third man on the team. Batkin
was a member of the 1910 Carnot and
the 1909 Intercollegiate teams and is
n forceful speaker. All three of the
debaters are members of Phi AJpha
Tan, the honorary debating fraternity.
The debate will commence promptly
at S o'clock and will conclude at a
comparatively early hour. As the con
test is on the Cardinal campus and
the Assembly Hall conveniently situ
ated, many rooters will surely attend.

should be extended to wdmen." Op
posing them will be the Blue and Gold
trio, composed of N. B. Drury, '12, F.
M. Shipper, '12 and J. J. Miller, '13. Tt
will be interesting, in view of the
class numerals of the two teams, to
witness a debate between three Sen
iors and three Underclassmen.
It is understood that a large number
of rooters will accompany the Califor
nia team to the campus, thus adding
much to the excitement of the evening.
Col. Harris Weinstock is the only
judge so far, who has been agreed
upon by California and Stanford. Sev
eral other prominent San Franciscans
have been asked to serve and their
answers are expected at any time.
The three men who will present the
argument for Stanford are all ex
perienced debaters. G. F. Morgan is
a fluent speaker who possesses a ready
ability to present his side of a proposi
tion in the most convincing light. The
"Chaparral" man is well-known to
the calcium, having been a member of
last year's team, and he also has de
bated for the Carnot medal on two oc
casions.
J. E. Shelton, '10, has taken an ac
tive part in debating since his Fresh
man year and has met with great suc
cess in this work. The Carnot medal
was secured by Stanford last year
through the splendid oratorical effort
of this debater. P. J. Batkin, '10, is
the third man on the team. Batkin
was a member of the 1910 Carnot and
the 1909 Intercollegiate teams and is
n forceful speaker. All three of the
debaters are members of Phi AJpha
Tan, the honorary debating fraternity.
The debate will commence promptly
at S o'clock and will conclude at a
comparatively early hour. As the con
test is on the Cardinal campus and
the Assembly Hall conveniently situ
ated, many rooters will surely attend.
Tomorrow evening at 8 o'clock in
the Assembly Hall will be held the
seventeenth annual Intercollegiate
Debate. If the volume and genuine
ness of the support of the Student
Body will equal that of the ability and
determination of the Stanford team to
win, there can be no question of
result of the judges' decision.
The score as it now stands is a tie.
Each of the rival Universities have
won eight Intercollegiate debates. The
winner of tomorrow night's contest
therefore, will bring up one of the two
institutions as the leader in the gen
eral series. The last Intercollegiate
won by Stanford was in 1908, with a
team composed of J. E. Shelton, '10,
L: Craven, '09, and G. D. Ferreli, '09.
The 1909 debate with G. F. Morgan, '10,
A. C. Stelle, '09, and . J. Batkin, '10,
resulted in a defeat by a very close
margin.
As stated before, Stanford is repre
sented by a thoroughly competent vet
eran team composed of P. J. Batkin.
'10, J. E. Shelton, '10, and G. F. Mor
gan, '10, who will speak in the order
named. They will uphold the affirma
tive side of the question: "Resolved,
That in the United States the suffrage
should be extended to wdmen." Op
posing them will be the Blue and Gold
trio, composed of N. B. Drury, '12, F.
M. Shipper, '12 and J. J. Miller, '13. Tt
