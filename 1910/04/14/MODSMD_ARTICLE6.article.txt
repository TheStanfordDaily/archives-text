The spirit of a highly enthusiastic
rally was noticeably injured last
night by the absence of the University
band, which organization had prom

to gather together his musicians, the
leader gave up in despair when only
six men came upon the scene at the
appointed hour. When we consider
their importance on this particular oc
casion, we feel the more strongly
tempted to censure the inexcusiable
absence of the negligent members.
We had thought them possessed of
sufficient spirit to sacrifice their own
selfish ends for a single evening.
