"The men are ready." A few words
it is true but when uttered by Stan
ford's veteran trainer, "Dad" Moulton,
they convey a world of meaning. This
short sentence expresses the fact that
the men selected to uphold the Stan
ford colors in the Annual Track and
Field Meet are in the pink of physi
cal condition; that these men are
ready to do their utmost to win a vic
tory for their Alma Mater. Never has
Stanford seen a better conditioned
bunch of men than the athletes who
arrive at the goal of three months'
hard training tomorrow afternoon on
the Varsity field.
CJood luck coupled with good train-!
ing has brought the Cardinal Track I
men safely through the preliminary |
season and no one will enter the big j
contest who is not perfectly fit. "Dad" \
feels so confident in the condition of
the men that he states if the wearers
of the Cardinal perform up to their
records, made in the last; few weeks,
we will easily win, but if California
beats us out it will only be after one
of the most sensational meets in ath
letic history. Captain Scott, has tlie
same idea of the condition and capa
city of his men. The skipper of the
team had this to say when speaking of
the chances of his team: "If Califor
nia wins and our men perform up to
their marks, the Blue and Gold will
deserve the victory."
Starting the year handicapped by
the loss of the biggest point-winners
of last season, a team has been devel
oped that would give an argument to
any track aggregation in the country.
Without milers, without half-milers in
September, Porter and Johnston have
been trained to fit the shoes of Brad
ford and Miller. Excepting the hur
dles, in which California is so fortu
nate as to possess a wonderful group
of athletes, Stanford can boast of a
well rounded team and one which for
fighting and staying abilities is hard
to surpass.
It is conceded by everyone that the
1910 Intercollegiate meet is to be
closely contested; but, while not in
the least minimizing the abilities of
Walter Christie's splendid group of

athletes, it is hard to believe they will
down "Dad's" bunch.
Figuring the "dope" on any athletic
contest partakes a good deal of guess
work. This is all the more true in
track meets where a reversal in form
unfortunately is not an uncommon
thing. However, by taking the records
of the men entered by both institutions
and comparing them, some sort of a
prediction may be made. On a con
servative estimate of Stanford's
chances, in which only a minimum
number of points were placed to our
credit in each event, the scoreboard
would read, Stanford —63, California —
59. According to this calculation
Stanford has about six opportunities
to better its score.
In the mile run, the first event on
the program, "Tommy" Smith and L.
H. Saxon are hard nuts to crack.
These men will take at least four
points; Stanford's chances of scoring
residing in W. S. Porter. Allowing for
Smith's undoubted ability the Cardinal
account can be started by taking throe
points from this race. There is a
chance for two more. The sprints
are the hope of the Stanfordites. If
we do not secure the majority of
points in these events it will be
strange. Three men who are aide to
travel the century in 10:1 should al
most be able to shut out the Berkeley
contingent, not one of whom has made
this time. The furlong will undoubt
edly be a repetition of the shorter
race, but allowing for Reed and Smith
erum not being able to place, at least
five points are certain ag Coleman is
a sure winner. Thirteen points is the
least that will come our way from
these two events.
W. M. Wyman and li. R. Stolz are
a pretty team in the quarter mile af
fair. Both negotiated the distance
last Saturday well under 50:3. If
Butler or Johns slip more than one
point out of the nine, it will only be
after a great reversal of form. The
Californians have never yet been able
to go the route in less than 51 seconds.
The scoring combination in the two
mile grind will be W. E. Newman, '1.2,
II C. Templeton, '10, and J. E. Shel
ton, '10. Sproule must show a decided
improvement if he wants to snatch
first place away from Newman, as the
Californian has not nearly approached
the time made by our two-miler. Six
points from this race satisfy Captain
Scott.
The story of the hurdles will be a
bitter one to tell. It is perhaps wise
to give California eighteen points im
mediately. This magnanimous act is
done however, with the mental reser
vation that perhaps Peaslee or Kern
may capture a point in the 220-yard
race. Dozier and Dowd are unques
tionably good half-milers and both are
capable of shaving even time in the
880-yard run. As both these men have
had considerable experience on the

track Johnston may have to be satis
fied with second place and three points
is all that can be expected. However,
a victory for Johnston is not unlooked
for. "Bill" Porter may also capture
a place in this event. The relay, with
Wyman, Stolz, Carter and Taylor
making up the Stanford team, looks
easy. Three of these men are capable
of doing the quarter in 51 or under,
while the fourth, Taylor, is only a
very little over that mark.
Turning to field events Stanford will
secure the greater number of points
without a question. Our one best bet
in the hammer-throw is Woolley and
he should beat his old rival Gabbert,
if form counts for anything. No other
points can be expected from this con
test. unless Youker is able to stay
within the ring. If the veteran can
keep from stepping over the chalkline
he may steal a point. "Harry" Horton
is the "old reliable" when it comes to
ibe shot-put and he will not have to
work hard for first place. This fist full
of points can be reckoned as safely
stored away.
Six points, with a chance for more,
is the prediction for the high jump.
Horine is good for first place 111 any
meet while Argabrite and Poor will
take at least third place between them.
Argabrite has improved immensely in
the last few weeks and is entirely re
covered from his injury. With the ag
gregation of talent entered in the
broad jump one point is certain to be
added to the score as a result of this
contest. If more is added, it will not
be unexpected as Stolz is capable of
doing 22 feet in competition.
The event, which of all the contests
of the day will be watched with the
most interest is the pole-vault. Bel
lah and Scott are the peers of any
van Iters in the world at. the present
time and with Bellah pressing him on.

Out of the sixteen contests which
have taken place between the two
Universities, California has eleven
wins to her credit. In all this time
the Cardinal has only annexed four.
One meet resulted in a tie score.
Captain Scott will probably shatter a
world's record. Eight points are cer
tain from this event, with a possibility
that Waring will annex the sole sur
vivor.
However its outcome may be fig
ured, the meet, is bound to be one of
the grandest athletic exhibitions seen
on the coast for a long time and in
excitement it will not be second to
the "Big" game.
The tarter's pistol will announce
the starting of the mile run promptly
at 2:30, the other events following in
regular order thereafter. Admission
will be the customary price; $1.00.
