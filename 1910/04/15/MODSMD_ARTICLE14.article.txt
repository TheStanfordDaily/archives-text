# WILL RACE ON MAY 25
## LAGUNITA TO MEET WASHINGTON IN NORTH. Strong Eights Will Row Over Luke Washington Course For Coast Championship. 
### 
The race between the big eights of
the Lagunita Boat Club and the Uni
versity of Washington has been set
for May 25. The local crew will leave
the campus on May 20, the day after
the last of the final examinations.
This will allow time for the men to
familiarise themselves with the course.
Lake Washington, on which the re
gatta will be rowed, is admirably
suited for aquatic sports. The lake is
a large one with a long straight-away
stretch.
This race will virtually carry with
it the intercollegiate championship of
the Pacific Coast. Technically it
cannot be said to do so as the Lagun
ita men are not recognized officially by
the Student Body. The right to go
North was won by the local men when
they defeated California last Saturday.
Last year's race was won by Stan
ford after an exciting contest during
the most of which they were behind.
A strong spurt during the last three
quarters of a mile closed the gap and
caused the Cardinal representatives to
win by a narrow margin.
The personnel of the Lagunita eight
will, with the exception of two or
three men, be the same as in the Cal
ifornia regatta. Nothing is known as
yet concerning the strength of the
Northern men. Washington has al
ways turned out a strong crew and
will no doubt have a fast eight on the
water this season.
The four-oared shell used by the
Freshmen in their race against the
California babies has been taken to
the Lake boat-house and will be used
by the men in training for the Seattle
regatta. The men will row on the
Lake every afternoon, the bow and
stern fours alternating in using the
boat. Week-ends will find the men at
Redwood rowing in the eight.
An election for captain of next
year's crew will be held shortly by
the members of this year's eight.
