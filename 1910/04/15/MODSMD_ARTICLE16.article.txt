# English Club Plans Reprint.

### 
Bids have been received by the
English Club for the reprinting of
their "First Year at Stanford," and it
is probable that the contract will be
let within the next few days, in order
to get the volume out this semester.
The club has been fortunate in secur
ing some rare old photographs of
early days at the University, and these
will be used in illustrating the volume,
in addition to the valuable pictures it
already contains, of which new, clear
plates are being made. It is probable
that there will be several Interesting
and valuable additions to the written
matter of the book, comprising new
articles throwing light upon condi
tions of the early days at Stanford.
