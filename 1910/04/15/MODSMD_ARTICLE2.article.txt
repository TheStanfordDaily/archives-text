# BIG SHOW IN EVENING
## FIELD MEET VAUDEVILLE WILL BE PRESENTED. Eight Big Acts Make Up the Program, Consisting of Song, Dance and Farce. 
### 
Conspicuous with local hits, popu
lar songs, dances, gymnastic stunts,
monologues, and two farces, the por
gram of the Field Meet Vaudeville is
anticipated by many to be the most
pleasing entertainments of its nature
ever produced by amateurs at this
University. The eight big acts are
complete and finished products and
will be staged with lightning rapidity
under the direction of the Sword and
Sandal stage crew. During the last
few rehearsals one of the most re
markable features was the smooth
ness and alacrity of the program.
Every act is strongly centralized, and
rapid change of scenery makes delay
an unknown quantity.
Yesterday afternoon the finishing
touches were put on the acts, and the
chorus drilled by an expert dancer
from San Francisco. The two coaches
in charge, Messrs. Mathieu and James,
are very enthuiastic over the Vaude
ville and do not hesitate in saying that
it will create a new standard of vaude
ville for Stanford.
The eight big acts to be produced
are unique and clever, and are being
presented by some of the most ac
complished actors in the Student Body.
The program will commence at 8:15
promptly, and the first act to be pre
sented is "After the Meet," by S.
Brown, '13, and J. B. Beman, '12. "Af
ter the Meet" is an original act and is
a mixture of comedy and pathos, which
contains many local hits of an ex
tremely interesting nature. Brown
will appear as Madame Lazimover,
and Beman as Vivette.
The second number on the program
is the "Butterfly Dance," featured for
the first time in Assembly Hall by
Miss Lolita Corella and eight assist
ants. Probably there is not an act on
the entire bill that, has received as
much comment as this one. Special
music will be played for the dance by
the local orchestra. The eight ladies
who will assist Miss Corella in the
dance are: Misses M. Mitchell B.
Haig, P.. Knapj), M. Judah, C. Keller,
H. Johnson, G. Davis and R. Bennett.
Quartette music by Messrs. C. E.
Sampson, '09, E. E. Chase, '11, P. F.
Pettigrew, '10, and L. Y. Mattes, '09,
will be rendered. The singers are all
well known to the Student Body, and
their numbers will be of a popular
nature. This act will be the third
number on the bill.
"The Florist Shop" will be the last
act, of part one. Miss M. L. Ozier, '10,
H. E. Reed, '10, and H. Forbes, '13, will
be the leaders in this number. They
will feature the two late popular
songs written by Weston Wilson, '13,
entitled, "Arn't You a Friend of a
Friend of Mine," and "That's What
the Time is, Dear."
"Op-o'-My-Thumb," the famous
Maude Adams farce, will be the cur
tain raiser of the second part of the
