Arrangements for the Senior Ball
are again under way, taking it for
granted that no further obstacles and
delays arise that will prevent the com

Yesterday the Student Affairs Com
mittee after deliberating for some time
upon the proposal of the committee
to hold the dance in San Jose granted
the petition of Chairman Levy. Con
sequently the wheels of the committee
at once started to turn again, and
Chairman Levy wih his assistants be
gan veritable preparations for the
grand ball.
The dance will be held in the Ven
dome Hotel in San Jose, and trans
portation to the affair will be looked

granted a most favorable rate by the
local Peninsular railway.
According to the management of the
Vendome Hotel there will be a series
of surprises for the event, and they
will do all in their power to make the
hotel a pleasant place.
The granting by the Student Affairs
Committee of the power for the ball
committee to hold the dance in San
Jose has been received with much
favorable comment, and it makes it
possible for the committee to arrange
for a more complete and finished
program. The ball-room of the hotel
has a magnificent floor and will ac

this year will be new and original,
and no previous color schemes will be
allowed to enter into the plans of the
people who will direct this phase of
the dance.
Probably one of the most difficult,
yet successful features of the ball, will
be the supper. Every effort possible :s

the program, and it is believed that
the food will exceed any ever served
at any previous collegiate function.
