The action of the Student Affairs
Committee and the Student Advisory-
Committee in prohibiting the use of
Lake Lagunita to visitors on the
campus is well-advised and deserves
strict enforcement. Another fatality
and Stanford would probably find her
self minus a lake. The ban should be
placed on all outsiders, without ex
ception. We are also of the belief
that some restrictions applicable to
students would be only reasonable,
and we hope that the promised regula
tions, while not being unduly harsh
toward experienced swimmers and
canoeists, will protect the novice
against the evil consequences of his
own folly.
