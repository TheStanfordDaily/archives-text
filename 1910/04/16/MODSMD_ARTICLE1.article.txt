A calm and beautiful day brought
forth the largest crowd that has ever
witnessed an Intercollegiate Field
meet on the Stanford campus. The
Blue and Gold sent down a formidable
aggregation of rooters who vied with
the Cardinal contingent for suprem-'
acy in noise-making.
The result of the meet was the chief
topic of discussion prior to the run
ning of the first event, and a close,
hard struggle was the general predic
tion.
'"If they beat us, there will be some
fine performing," "Dad" remarked be
fore the meet.
Trainer Christie said, "If they win,
they will beat a good team."
The meet was run off exactly on
schedule time.
Woolley upon whom Stanford de
pended for three points in the first
field event was in very bad shape about
a quarter hour before the meet. He
has just recovered from a severe at
tack of lumbago. He came out of the
hospital this morning. "Dad" speak
ing of him, said, "He will go in, but
he can not do his best."
The Stanford and California vault -
ers have only two bamboo poles be
tween them. Scott, will use the pole
that he has had all season.
"Bunny" Swift, ex-'OB, and former
yell-leader, created enthusiasm by
leading several cheers during the af
ternoon.
The meet proved exciting in the ex
treme. First one team and then the
other forged its way into the lead.
The Cardinal surprised in the hurdles
and the broad jump, while being equal
ly disappointing the half-mile. It was
not until after the final of the 220-
that Stanford became assured of the
successful outcome of the day. With
the relay, pole and high yet to be de
cided the Cardinal had then only to
secure 14 points to cinch the meet, and
this seemed as easy as it proved to he.
Mile Hun.
The mile runners of each Varsity
appeared on the track at 2:30. The
starting gun was fired three minutes
later. Peterson took the lead, but
Davidson suceeeded him before the

end of the half, which was run in
2:11. Porter passed Davidson, but
was caught by Saxon, who passed
him on the backstretch of the last lap
and won the race easily by a margin
of 15 yards.
100-Yard Dash.
Coleman took the lead in the first
ten yards and was never headed, win
ning by one yard. Reed was a couple
of feet in front of Rathbone at the
finish.
Smitherum broke down in the sec
ond heat when about 10 yards from
the tape.
120-Yard Hurdles.
Donald and Edwards tied for the
first, after running together the great
er part of the distance. Peaslee was

a yard behind. The time of 15:4
equals Cowles' Intercollegiate record.
440-Yard Dash.
Wyman took the pole and the lead
at the start. He led the field all the
way. Stolz was second, but weakened
in the stretch and was caught by But
ler, the latter winning by a scant foot.
Wyman made the lap in 50:
breaking his own record of 50:1.
Two-Mile Hun.
The mile was negotiated in 5:10.
On the fifth lap Newman went into
the lead, where he stayed the rest, of
the race. At the beginning of the
eighth circuit, Newman began a tre
mendous sprint which he maintained
all the way around, winning in the
easiest fashion by almost 100 yeards.

He ran a wonderful race. Shelton
was prominent throughout, leading
Brown by about 25 yards. Sproule, the
much-touted California Freshman,
dropped out on the second lap.
880-Yard Dash.
The Stanford supporters were great
ly disappointed in the half-mile.
Johnston, of whom so much was ex
pected, failed to place. The first lap
in 54:3 proved too fast for the Cardi
nal runner, and although he led for a
time in the second round, he was un
able to do anything in the stretch.
220-Yard Hurdles.
Kern ran a wonderful race, finish
ing only four or five feet behind
Cowles who won the race in 25:1.

man broke the former Intercollegiate

ilton and Coleman. He won by t

Carter failed to make up any ground
for Hie Cardinal. Stolz ran a great
lap, finishing several yards ahead.
Wyman had his opponent at his
mercy, winning by 30 yards.
FIELD EVENTS
Woolley's sickness kept him out of
bis usual form in the hammer and he
was able only to take third.
Dole surprised everybody in the
shot. By a put, 10 inches further than
he had ever done before, he gained
second place, Horton having won at
44 ft., 8 inches.
Bellah's jump of 22 ft. 5 in. gave
him a second in the broad, Tallant
taking third with a leap of 21 ft. 4Y 2 in.
Horine attempted to clear the bar
in the high at 6ft. 3in. but was un
successful.
When the pole vault was in pro
gress it was early seen that California
needed eight, of the nine points to
capture the day. As this was an im
possibility, if every one existed, the
meet was already over.

A calm and beautiful day brought
forth the largest crowd that has ever
witnessed an Intercollegiate Field
meet on the Stanford campus. The
Blue and Gold sent down a formidable
aggregation of rooters who vied with
the Cardinal contingent for suprem-'
acy in noise-making.
The result of the meet was the chief
topic of discussion prior to the run
ning of the first event, and a close,
hard struggle was the general predic
tion.
'"If they beat us, there will be some
fine performing," "Dad" remarked be
fore the meet.
Trainer Christie said, "If they win,
they will beat a good team."
The meet was run off exactly on
schedule time.
Woolley upon whom Stanford de
pended for three points in the first
field event was in very bad shape about
a quarter hour before the meet. He
has just recovered from a severe at
tack of lumbago. He came out of the
hospital this morning. "Dad" speak
ing of him, said, "He will go in, but
he can not do his best."
The Stanford and California vault -
ers have only two bamboo poles be
tween them. Scott, will use the pole
that he has had all season.
"Bunny" Swift, ex-'OB, and former
yell-leader, created enthusiasm by
leading several cheers during the af
ternoon.
The meet proved exciting in the ex
treme. First one team and then the
other forged its way into the lead.
The Cardinal surprised in the hurdles
and the broad jump, while being equal
ly disappointing the half-mile. It was
not until after the final of the 220-
that Stanford became assured of the
successful outcome of the day. With
the relay, pole and high yet to be de
cided the Cardinal had then only to
secure 14 points to cinch the meet, and
this seemed as easy as it proved to he.
Mile Hun.
The mile runners of each Varsity
appeared on the track at 2:30. The
starting gun was fired three minutes
later. Peterson took the lead, but
Davidson suceeeded him before the

end of the half, which was run in
2:11. Porter passed Davidson, but
was caught by Saxon, who passed
him on the backstretch of the last lap
and won the race easily by a margin
of 15 yards.
100-Yard Dash.
Coleman took the lead in the first
ten yards and was never headed, win
ning by one yard. Reed was a couple
of feet in front of Rathbone at the
finish.
Smitherum broke down in the sec
ond heat when about 10 yards from
the tape.
120-Yard Hurdles.
Donald and Edwards tied for the
first, after running together the great
er part of the distance. Peaslee was

a yard behind. The time of 15:4
equals Cowles' Intercollegiate record.
440-Yard Dash.
Wyman took the pole and the lead
at the start. He led the field all the
way. Stolz was second, but weakened
in the stretch and was caught by But
ler, the latter winning by a scant foot.
Wyman made the lap in 50:
breaking his own record of 50:1.
Two-Mile Hun.
The mile was negotiated in 5:10.
On the fifth lap Newman went into
the lead, where he stayed the rest, of
the race. At the beginning of the
eighth circuit, Newman began a tre
mendous sprint which he maintained
all the way around, winning in the
easiest fashion by almost 100 yeards.

He ran a wonderful race. Shelton
was prominent throughout, leading
Brown by about 25 yards. Sproule, the
much-touted California Freshman,
dropped out on the second lap.
880-Yard Dash.
The Stanford supporters were great
ly disappointed in the half-mile.
Johnston, of whom so much was ex
pected, failed to place. The first lap
in 54:3 proved too fast for the Cardi
nal runner, and although he led for a
time in the second round, he was un
able to do anything in the stretch.
220-Yard Hurdles.
Kern ran a wonderful race, finish
ing only four or five feet behind
Cowles who won the race in 25:1.
This breaks John's Intercollegiate
record of 25:2.
220-Yard Dash.
In crossing the tape in 22 flat Cole
man broke the former Intercollegiate
record of 22:3, held by Cadogan, Ham
ilton and Coleman. He won by t
yards. The world's record is 21:1.
Helay
Taylor lost the first lap by a yard.
Carter failed to make up any ground
for Hie Cardinal. Stolz ran a great
lap, finishing several yards ahead.
Wyman had his opponent at his
mercy, winning by 30 yards.
FIELD EVENTS
Woolley's sickness kept him out of
bis usual form in the hammer and he
was able only to take third.
Dole surprised everybody in the
shot. By a put, 10 inches further than
he had ever done before, he gained
second place, Horton having won at
44 ft., 8 inches.
Bellah's jump of 22 ft. 5 in. gave
him a second in the broad, Tallant
taking third with a leap of 21 ft. 4Y 2 in.
Horine attempted to clear the bar
in the high at 6ft. 3in. but was un
successful.
When the pole vault was in pro
gress it was early seen that California
needed eight, of the nine points to
capture the day. As this was an im
possibility, if every one existed, the
meet was already over.

A calm and beautiful day brought
forth the largest crowd that has ever
witnessed an Intercollegiate Field
meet on the Stanford campus. The
Blue and Gold sent down a formidable
aggregation of rooters who vied with
the Cardinal contingent for suprem-'
acy in noise-making.
The result of the meet was the chief
topic of discussion prior to the run
ning of the first event, and a close,
hard struggle was the general predic
tion.
'"If they beat us, there will be some
fine performing," "Dad" remarked be
fore the meet.
Trainer Christie said, "If they win,
they will beat a good team."
The meet was run off exactly on
schedule time.
Woolley upon whom Stanford de
pended for three points in the first
field event was in very bad shape about
a quarter hour before the meet. He
has just recovered from a severe at
tack of lumbago. He came out of the
hospital this morning. "Dad" speak
ing of him, said, "He will go in, but
he can not do his best."
The Stanford and California vault -
ers have only two bamboo poles be
tween them. Scott, will use the pole
that he has had all season.
"Bunny" Swift, ex-'OB, and former
yell-leader, created enthusiasm by
leading several cheers during the af
ternoon.
The meet proved exciting in the ex
treme. First one team and then the
other forged its way into the lead.
The Cardinal surprised in the hurdles
and the broad jump, while being equal
ly disappointing the half-mile. It was
not until after the final of the 220-
that Stanford became assured of the
successful outcome of the day. With
the relay, pole and high yet to be de
cided the Cardinal had then only to
secure 14 points to cinch the meet, and
this seemed as easy as it proved to he.
Mile Hun.
The mile runners of each Varsity
appeared on the track at 2:30. The
starting gun was fired three minutes
later. Peterson took the lead, but
Davidson suceeeded him before the

end of the half, which was run in
2:11. Porter passed Davidson, but
was caught by Saxon, who passed
him on the backstretch of the last lap
and won the race easily by a margin
of 15 yards.
100-Yard Dash.
Coleman took the lead in the first
ten yards and was never headed, win
ning by one yard. Reed was a couple
of feet in front of Rathbone at the
finish.
Smitherum broke down in the sec
ond heat when about 10 yards from
the tape.
120-Yard Hurdles.
Donald and Edwards tied for the
first, after running together the great
er part of the distance. Peaslee was

a yard behind. The time of 15:4
equals Cowles' Intercollegiate record.
440-Yard Dash.
Wyman took the pole and the lead
at the start. He led the field all the
way. Stolz was second, but weakened
in the stretch and was caught by But
ler, the latter winning by a scant foot.
Wyman made the lap in 50:
breaking his own record of 50:1.
Two-Mile Hun.
The mile was negotiated in 5:10.
On the fifth lap Newman went into
the lead, where he stayed the rest, of
the race. At the beginning of the
eighth circuit, Newman began a tre
mendous sprint which he maintained
all the way around, winning in the
easiest fashion by almost 100 yeards.

He ran a wonderful race. Shelton
was prominent throughout, leading
Brown by about 25 yards. Sproule, the
much-touted California Freshman,
dropped out on the second lap.
880-Yard Dash.
The Stanford supporters were great
ly disappointed in the half-mile.
Johnston, of whom so much was ex
pected, failed to place. The first lap
in 54:3 proved too fast for the Cardi
nal runner, and although he led for a
time in the second round, he was un
able to do anything in the stretch.
220-Yard Hurdles.
Kern ran a wonderful race, finish
ing only four or five feet behind
Cowles who won the race in 25:1.
This breaks John's Intercollegiate
record of 25:2.
220-Yard Dash.
In crossing the tape in 22 flat Cole
man broke the former Intercollegiate
record of 22:3, held by Cadogan, Ham
ilton and Coleman. He won by t
yards. The world's record is 21:1.
Helay
Taylor lost the first lap by a yard.
Carter failed to make up any ground
for Hie Cardinal. Stolz ran a great
lap, finishing several yards ahead.
Wyman had his opponent at his
mercy, winning by 30 yards.
FIELD EVENTS
Woolley's sickness kept him out of
bis usual form in the hammer and he
was able only to take third.
Dole surprised everybody in the
shot. By a put, 10 inches further than
he had ever done before, he gained
second place, Horton having won at
44 ft., 8 inches.
Bellah's jump of 22 ft. 5 in. gave
him a second in the broad, Tallant
taking third with a leap of 21 ft. 4Y 2 in.
Horine attempted to clear the bar
in the high at 6ft. 3in. but was un
successful.
When the pole vault was in pro
gress it was early seen that California
needed eight, of the nine points to
capture the day. As this was an im
possibility, if every one existed, the
meet was already over.

A calm and beautiful day brought
forth the largest crowd that has ever
witnessed an Intercollegiate Field
meet on the Stanford campus. The
Blue and Gold sent down a formidable
aggregation of rooters who vied with
the Cardinal contingent for suprem-'
acy in noise-making.
The result of the meet was the chief
topic of discussion prior to the run
ning of the first event, and a close,
hard struggle was the general predic
tion.
'"If they beat us, there will be some
fine performing," "Dad" remarked be
fore the meet.
Trainer Christie said, "If they win,
they will beat a good team."
The meet was run off exactly on
schedule time.
Woolley upon whom Stanford de
pended for three points in the first
field event was in very bad shape about
a quarter hour before the meet. He
has just recovered from a severe at
tack of lumbago. He came out of the
hospital this morning. "Dad" speak
ing of him, said, "He will go in, but
he can not do his best."
The Stanford and California vault -
ers have only two bamboo poles be
tween them. Scott, will use the pole
that he has had all season.
"Bunny" Swift, ex-'OB, and former
yell-leader, created enthusiasm by
leading several cheers during the af
ternoon.
The meet proved exciting in the ex
treme. First one team and then the
other forged its way into the lead.
The Cardinal surprised in the hurdles
and the broad jump, while being equal
ly disappointing the half-mile. It was
not until after the final of the 220-
that Stanford became assured of the
successful outcome of the day. With
the relay, pole and high yet to be de
cided the Cardinal had then only to
secure 14 points to cinch the meet, and
this seemed as easy as it proved to he.
Mile Hun.
The mile runners of each Varsity
appeared on the track at 2:30. The
starting gun was fired three minutes
later. Peterson took the lead, but
Davidson suceeeded him before the

end of the half, which was run in
2:11. Porter passed Davidson, but
was caught by Saxon, who passed
him on the backstretch of the last lap
and won the race easily by a margin
of 15 yards.
100-Yard Dash.
Coleman took the lead in the first
ten yards and was never headed, win
ning by one yard. Reed was a couple
of feet in front of Rathbone at the
finish.
Smitherum broke down in the sec
ond heat when about 10 yards from
the tape.
120-Yard Hurdles.
Donald and Edwards tied for the
first, after running together the great
er part of the distance. Peaslee was

a yard behind. The time of 15:4
equals Cowles' Intercollegiate record.
440-Yard Dash.
Wyman took the pole and the lead
at the start. He led the field all the
way. Stolz was second, but weakened
in the stretch and was caught by But
ler, the latter winning by a scant foot.
Wyman made the lap in 50:
breaking his own record of 50:1.
Two-Mile Hun.
The mile was negotiated in 5:10.
On the fifth lap Newman went into
the lead, where he stayed the rest, of
the race. At the beginning of the
eighth circuit, Newman began a tre
mendous sprint which he maintained
all the way around, winning in the
easiest fashion by almost 100 yeards.

He ran a wonderful race. Shelton
was prominent throughout, leading
Brown by about 25 yards. Sproule, the
