# WOMEN LOSE AT TENNIS.
## Stanford Team Defeated by Blue and Gold in Annual Tournament on Encina Courts this Morning. 
### 
In one of the closest tournaments
ever played on a local court the Cali
fornia woman's tennis team won from
Stanford this morning by a score of
5-3. At the beginning of the last
match ihe score stood 2-2, California
having won two of the singles matches
and Stanford having obtained _ one
singles and one doubles match. The
last game was close and well played
by both sides, but the playing of Miss
Hazel Hotchkiss, the United States
champion, was too. consistent and ef
fective for the Stanford women, and
even then the last game was won only
by a single point.
The tournament was well attended,
many enhusiasts crouching on the
ground around the courts to cheer
their teams on to victory, and there
was scarcely a moment when they
were not in suspense as to the ulti
mate result of the tournament.
Miss Allen played perhaps the most
consistent as well as the most bril
liant game for Stanford, and in the
singles match she was defeated by her
more experienced opponent from
across the bay only after a good bit of
playing. Miss Hayward won her
match from Miss Drury by a score of
7-5, and 6-3, clearly outplaying her at
every stage of the game.
Stanford won one other match when
Miss Burrell and Miss Yocli defeated
Miss Davis and Miss Judd, placing the
outcome of the tournament on the last
doubles match which we were unable
to win.
The scores in the different matches
were as follows:
