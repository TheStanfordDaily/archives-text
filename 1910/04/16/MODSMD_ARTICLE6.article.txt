# U.C. WINS IN TENNIS
## DEFEATS STANFORD TEAM BY 5 to 0 SCORE. Murray Wins a Set from Herbert Long But Long Brothers Prove Themselves Invincible. 
### 
The California tennis team won
every match in the nineteenth annual
tennis tournament which was played
on the California courts yesterday
afternoon and this morning. It was
simply a case of a veteran world-fam
ous team against less experienced
adversaries and the former won. Al
though fighting against great odds
and apparent defeat, not one of the
Stanford team showed himself a quit
ter and it was their game fight that
brought forth many plaudits from the
California grand-stand.
The match between Murray and
Herbert Long was the closest and
most interesting. Long won G-4.
At the conclusion of this match the
doubles match between the Long
brothers and Morgan and Mann was
played. The Longs won in straight
6-1, G-3, S-G. In the first set Morgan
and Mann were unable to hit their
stride but in the last two they braced
and almost carried off the last set by
getting a lead of G-5. The Stanford
men had by far the best team work,
but the individual ability of the in
vincible Longs could not be overcome.
In the first match of the morning
between Melville Long and Morgan,
the former won 6-1, 6-3. The match
was much closer than the score in
dicates, Morgan played his usual
steady game and fought every game to
deuce, but Long almost invtriably
captured the vantage points. In the
matches yesterday afternoon between
Mann and Powell and the second
double teams, the California men were
again successful. Powell defeated
Mann 6-2, 6-0, and Trees and Rogers
defeated Murray and Shaul 5-7, 6-2,
G-2, 6-2. In the doubles match Stan
ford started off like a winner by secur
ing the first set 7-5, but the California
men settled down in the next sets and
lobbed with great effect.
The summary of the tournament is
as follows:
First singles—Melville Long (U.C.),
defeated Morgan (S), 6-1, 6-3; second
singles—Herbert Long (U.C.) defeated
Murray (S) 4-6, 6-1, 6-4; Third singles
