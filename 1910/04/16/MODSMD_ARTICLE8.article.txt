# DEFEATED IN DEBATE
## STANFORD LOSES SEVENTEENTH ANNUAL INTERCOLLEGIATE. Judges Give Decision to California by Vote of 2 to 1.â€”Large Audience in Assembly Hall. 
### 
Stanford's veteran team composed
of P. Batkin, '10, J. E. Shelton, '10,
and G. F. Morgan, '10, went down to
defeat yesterday evening in the seven
teenth annual Intercollegiate Debate
before the able team representing the
University of California. This is the
third victory in debating which the
Blue and Gold has won during the
past year, having captured last year's
Intercollegiate and this year's Carnot.
The judges, whose vote stood 2 to 1
for California were Harris Weinstock.
Prof. A. J. Cloud, and Judge Cabanis,
all of San Francisco.
Although the debate was an ex
tremely close one, in which each
speaker's argument clashed with those
of the opposite side, yet it is felt that
California won fairly the decision
which she received. She won it not
so much from the compelling force of
her own arguments, however, but
rather from the failure of the third
speaker on the affirmative to ade
quately rebutt the arguments of the
second speaker on the negative. The
refutation' which was given cancelled
the effectiveness not so much of the
negative's arguments but rather of
those of the second speaker on the
affirmative, Mr. Shelton. By declar
ing Colorado an unrepresentative
state, Mr. Morgan put a damper on his
colleague's arguments which were
based upon Colorado statistics. Con
sidered in the light that California
failed to meet our main contention
that sex is no consideration for suf
frage, Stanford deserved to win. A
decision either way would have been
fair.
