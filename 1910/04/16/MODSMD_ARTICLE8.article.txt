# DEFEATED IN DEBATE
## STANFORD LOSES SEVENTEENTH ANNUAL INTERCOLLEGIATE. Judges Give Decision to California by Vote of 2 to 1.â€”Large Audience in Assembly Hall. 
### 
Stanford's veteran team composed
of P. Batkin, '10, J. E. Shelton, '10,
and G. F. Morgan, '10, went down to
defeat yesterday evening in the seven
teenth annual Intercollegiate Debate
before the able team representing the
University of California. This is the
third victory in debating which the
Blue and Gold has won during the
past year, having captured last year's
Intercollegiate and this year's Carnot.
The judges, whose vote stood 2 to 1
for California were Harris Weinstock.
Prof. A. J. Cloud, and Judge Cabanis,
all of San Francisco.
Although the debate was an ex
tremely close one, in which each
speaker's argument clashed with those
of the opposite side, yet it is felt that
California won fairly the decision
which she received. She won it not
so much from the compelling force of
her own arguments, however, but
rather from the failure of the third
speaker on the affirmative to ade
quately rebutt the arguments of the
second speaker on the negative. The
refutation' which was given cancelled
the effectiveness not so much of the
negative's arguments but rather of
those of the second speaker on the
affirmative, Mr. Shelton. By declar
ing Colorado an unrepresentative
state, Mr. Morgan put a damper on his
colleague's arguments which were
based upon Colorado statistics. Con
sidered in the light that California
failed to meet our main contention
that sex is no consideration for suf
frage, Stanford deserved to win. A
decision either way would have been
fair.
The debate, as a whole, was an ex
tremely interesting one and was at
tended by a large crowd. Both teams
were supported by strong rooting sec
tions and partisan feeling ran high.
All of the speakers were clear, logical,
and easily followed, and this combined
with the nature of the subject de
bated, tended to keep the close atten
tion of the audience.
The star of the California team
proved to be the Freshman, J. J. Mil
ler, who gifted with an incisive men
tality and a forceful delivery, made
California's main contentions. J. E.
Shelton, '10, Stanford's veteran who
has faced California for four times on
the rostrum, again proved himself the
ablest debater that this University has
at the present time. The wonderfully
able and convincing way in which he
assumed the burden of proof shifted
upon the affirmative by Miller, was the
finest piece of individual work in the
evening.
The subject for debate was: "Re
solved, That in the United States the
suffrage should be extended to wom
en." Stanford upheld the affirmative
with Batkin, Shelton, and Morgan
speaking in the order named; Cali
fornia, upholding the negative, was
represented by J. J. Miller, '13, F. M.
Shipper, '12, and N. B. Drury, '12, who
also spoke in the order named. The
affirmative's main contention was that
the right to vote did not rest upon sex
qualifications. The negative refused
to meet Stanford on this basis, de
clairing that the suffrage was a
privilege and not an inalienable right
and shifted the burden of proof on
their opponents by demanding that
they show how this privelege would
work for the general welfare.
Batkin, in opening for the affirma
tive, gave a wonderfully clear and
lucid exposition of the suffrage ques
tion as a whole, bringing each of his
many arguments out in their strong
est light and demanding that the nega
tive prove that sex and sex alone
disqualified a woman from voting. He
stated that mental capacity and moral
fitness were the first qualifications of
suffrage, and then showed how well
women measured up to these quali
fications. He explained how the old
physical force test of voting was ex
ploded, how the change of woman's
position in the world had given her
the leisure and the desire for political
activity, and then asked if there was
anything in the sphere of woman's
activities which militated against her
voting. Batkin's speech was one of
the most finished efforts ever delivered
by a Stanford debater. Miller fol
lowed Batkin for the negative and
spent much of his time, as stated
above, in showing how and why the
affirmative should assume the burden
of proof. He then proceeded to main
tain that the suffrage would not im
prove conditions in that the vote of
married men would only be duplicated,
that economically independent wom

en constitute an unstable state of so
ciety having few permanent interests,
and no time to consider public ques
tions, and finally, that the fallen wom
en of the great cities would hold the
balance of power in municipal elec
tions.
Shelton on taking the floor im
mediately accepted the preceediug
speaker's challenge and quoted in
numerable statistics and authorities
which showed that woman suffrage
had been of incalculable benefit in
passing reform measures. He first
established conclusively the point that
women do take advantage of the suff
rage when it is granted. He proved
that a greater percentage of the worn
tn of Colorado vote than the men, and
that the vote of the scarlet women is
only a small per cent of the total
registration. He raised the point that
women are eminently fitted for suff
rage from an educational and moral
viewpoint, and then proceeded to
name an imposing number of good
statutes passed in suffrage states.
Shelton delivered a wonderfully con
vincing speech and made a splendid
impression.
Shipper in speaking for California
denied that women suffrage had been
an aid to good government, and
pointed to conditions in those states
granting it, to prove his point. He
advised against adding the vote of
foreign-born women to that of for
eign-born men and declared that while
this vote would be solid that of in
telligent women would be divided.
Morgan, as third on the affirmative,
held that the preceeding speaker had
taken only isolated cases to prove his
points. He ably refuted many of
Shipper's statements, but made the
unfortunate point spoken of before,
with regard to the status of Western
suffrage states. The new arguments
which he brought forward were very
good and his final summary of the
affirmative arguments was declared
by Judge A. J. Cloud to be one of the
most masterly he had ever listened to.
He again asked California as had Bat
kin as to why our suffrage laws should
rule out all women and keep all men.
With regard to the opposition to the
vote of foreign women he stated that
our foremost settlement workers,
who best understood the aliens, fav
ored equal rights. He dealt at some
length also on the direct and indirect
benefits of suffrage to women person
ally.
Drury, who has been on every Blue
and Gold team since matriculation,
closed for the negative. He objected
to any reference by the affirmative to
intellectual qualifications for voting,
as aside from the question for debate,
and maintained that other influences
besides those of women had been
primarily responsible for the reforms
mentioned by Shelton. He made much
of the point that the affirmative had
admitted the suffrage states as un
representative.
President D. S. Jordan was the pre
siding officer.

Batkin, in opening for the affirma
tive, gave a wonderfully clear and
lucid exposition of the suffrage ques
tion as a whole, bringing each of his
many arguments out in their strong
est light and demanding that the nega
tive prove that sex and sex alone
disqualified a woman from voting. He
stated that mental capacity and moral
fitness were the first qualifications of
suffrage, and then showed how well
women measured up to these quali
fications. He explained how the old
physical force test of voting was ex
ploded, how the change of woman's
position in the world had given her
the leisure and the desire for political
activity, and then asked if there was
anything in the sphere of woman's
activities which militated against her
voting. Batkin's speech was one of
the most finished efforts ever delivered
by a Stanford debater. Miller fol
lowed Batkin for the negative and
spent much of his time, as stated
above, in showing how and why the
affirmative should assume the burden
of proof. He then proceeded to main
tain that the suffrage would not im
prove conditions in that the vote of
married men would only be duplicated,
that economically independent wom

en constitute an unstable state of so
ciety having few permanent interests,
and no time to consider public ques
tions, and finally, that the fallen wom
en of the great cities would hold the
balance of power in municipal elec
tions.
Shelton on taking the floor im
mediately accepted the preceediug
speaker's challenge and quoted in
numerable statistics and authorities
which showed that woman suffrage
had been of incalculable benefit in
passing reform measures. He first
established conclusively the point that
women do take advantage of the suff
rage when it is granted. He proved
that a greater percentage of the worn
tn of Colorado vote than the men, and
that the vote of the scarlet women is
only a small per cent of the total
registration. He raised the point that
women are eminently fitted for suff
rage from an educational and moral
viewpoint, and then proceeded to
name an imposing number of good
statutes passed in suffrage states.
Shelton delivered a wonderfully con
vincing speech and made a splendid
impression.
Shipper in speaking for California
denied that women suffrage had been
an aid to good government, and
pointed to conditions in those states
granting it, to prove his point. He
advised against adding the vote of
foreign-born women to that of for
eign-born men and declared that while
this vote would be solid that of in
telligent women would be divided.
Morgan, as third on the affirmative,
held that the preceeding speaker had
taken only isolated cases to prove his
points. He ably refuted many of
Shipper's statements, but made the
unfortunate point spoken of before,
with regard to the status of Western
suffrage states. The new arguments
which he brought forward were very
good and his final summary of the
affirmative arguments was declared
by Judge A. J. Cloud to be one of the
most masterly he had ever listened to.
He again asked California as had Bat
kin as to why our suffrage laws should
rule out all women and keep all men.
With regard to the opposition to the
vote of foreign women he stated that
our foremost settlement workers,
who best understood the aliens, fav
ored equal rights. He dealt at some
length also on the direct and indirect
benefits of suffrage to women person
ally.
Drury, who has been on every Blue
and Gold team since matriculation,
closed for the negative. He objected
to any reference by the affirmative to
intellectual qualifications for voting,
as aside from the question for debate,
and maintained that other influences
besides those of women had been
primarily responsible for the reforms
mentioned by Shelton. He made much
of the point that the affirmative had
admitted the suffrage states as un
representative.

Stanford's veteran team composed
of P. Batkin, '10, J. E. Shelton, '10,
and G. F. Morgan, '10, went down to
defeat yesterday evening in the seven
teenth annual Intercollegiate Debate
before the able team representing the
University of California. This is the
third victory in debating which the
Blue and Gold has won during the
past year, having captured last year's
Intercollegiate and this year's Carnot.
The judges, whose vote stood 2 to 1
for California were Harris Weinstock.
Prof. A. J. Cloud, and Judge Cabanis,
all of San Francisco.
Although the debate was an ex
tremely close one, in which each
speaker's argument clashed with those
of the opposite side, yet it is felt that
California won fairly the decision
which she received. She won it not
so much from the compelling force of
her own arguments, however, but
rather from the failure of the third
speaker on the affirmative to ade
quately rebutt the arguments of the
second speaker on the negative. The
refutation' which was given cancelled
the effectiveness not so much of the
negative's arguments but rather of
those of the second speaker on the
affirmative, Mr. Shelton. By declar
ing Colorado an unrepresentative
state, Mr. Morgan put a damper on his
colleague's arguments which were
based upon Colorado statistics. Con
sidered in the light that California
failed to meet our main contention
that sex is no consideration for suf
frage, Stanford deserved to win. A
decision either way would have been
fair.
The debate, as a whole, was an ex
tremely interesting one and was at
tended by a large crowd. Both teams
were supported by strong rooting sec
tions and partisan feeling ran high.
All of the speakers were clear, logical,
and easily followed, and this combined
with the nature of the subject de
bated, tended to keep the close atten
tion of the audience.
The star of the California team
proved to be the Freshman, J. J. Mil
ler, who gifted with an incisive men
tality and a forceful delivery, made
California's main contentions. J. E.
Shelton, '10, Stanford's veteran who
has faced California for four times on
the rostrum, again proved himself the
ablest debater that this University has
at the present time. The wonderfully
able and convincing way in which he
assumed the burden of proof shifted
upon the affirmative by Miller, was the
finest piece of individual work in the
evening.
The subject for debate was: "Re
solved, That in the United States the
suffrage should be extended to wom
en." Stanford upheld the affirmative
with Batkin, Shelton, and Morgan
speaking in the order named; Cali
fornia, upholding the negative, was
represented by J. J. Miller, '13, F. M.
Shipper, '12, and N. B. Drury, '12, who
also spoke in the order named. The
affirmative's main contention was that
the right to vote did not rest upon sex
qualifications. The negative refused
to meet Stanford on this basis, de
clairing that the suffrage was a
privilege and not an inalienable right
and shifted the burden of proof on
their opponents by demanding that
they show how this privelege would
work for the general welfare.

closed for the negative. He objected
to any reference by the affirmative to
intellectual qualifications for voting,
as aside from the question for debate,
and maintained that other influences
besides those of women had been
primarily responsible for the reforms
mentioned by Shelton. He made much
of the point that the affirmative had
admitted the suffrage states as un
representative.
President D. S. Jordan was the pre
siding officer.
Stanford's veteran team composed
of P. Batkin, '10, J. E. Shelton, '10,
and G. F. Morgan, '10, went down to
defeat yesterday evening in the seven
teenth annual Intercollegiate Debate
before the able team representing the
University of California. This is the
third victory in debating which the
Blue and Gold has won during the
past year, having captured last year's
Intercollegiate and this year's Carnot.
The judges, whose vote stood 2 to 1
for California were Harris Weinstock.
Prof. A. J. Cloud, and Judge Cabanis,
all of San Francisco.
Although the debate was an ex
tremely close one, in which each
speaker's argument clashed with those
of the opposite side, yet it is felt that
California won fairly the decision
which she received. She won it not
so much from the compelling force of
her own arguments, however, but
rather from the failure of the third
speaker on the affirmative to ade
quately rebutt the arguments of the
second speaker on the negative. The
refutation' which was given cancelled
the effectiveness not so much of the
negative's arguments but rather of
those of the second speaker on the
affirmative, Mr. Shelton. By declar
ing Colorado an unrepresentative
state, Mr. Morgan put a damper on his
colleague's arguments which were
based upon Colorado statistics. Con
sidered in the light that California
failed to meet our main contention
that sex is no consideration for suf
frage, Stanford deserved to win. A
decision either way would have been
fair.
The debate, as a whole, was an ex
tremely interesting one and was at
tended by a large crowd. Both teams
were supported by strong rooting sec
tions and partisan feeling ran high.
All of the speakers were clear, logical,
and easily followed, and this combined
with the nature of the subject de
bated, tended to keep the close atten
tion of the audience.
The star of the California team
proved to be the Freshman, J. J. Mil
ler, who gifted with an incisive men
tality and a forceful delivery, made
California's main contentions. J. E.
Shelton, '10, Stanford's veteran who
has faced California for four times on
the rostrum, again proved himself the
ablest debater that this University has
at the present time. The wonderfully
able and convincing way in which he
assumed the burden of proof shifted
upon the affirmative by Miller, was the
finest piece of individual work in the
evening.
The subject for debate was: "Re
solved, That in the United States the
suffrage should be extended to wom
en." Stanford upheld the affirmative
with Batkin, Shelton, and Morgan
speaking in the order named; Cali
fornia, upholding the negative, was
represented by J. J. Miller, '13, F. M.
Shipper, '12, and N. B. Drury, '12, who
also spoke in the order named. The
affirmative's main contention was that
the right to vote did not rest upon sex
qualifications. The negative refused
to meet Stanford on this basis, de
clairing that the suffrage was a
privilege and not an inalienable right
and shifted the burden of proof on
their opponents by demanding that
they show how this privelege would
work for the general welfare.
Batkin, in opening for the affirma
tive, gave a wonderfully clear and
lucid exposition of the suffrage ques
tion as a whole, bringing each of his
many arguments out in their strong
est light and demanding that the nega
tive prove that sex and sex alone
disqualified a woman from voting. He
stated that mental capacity and moral
fitness were the first qualifications of
suffrage, and then showed how well
women measured up to these quali
fications. He explained how the old
physical force test of voting was ex
ploded, how the change of woman's
position in the world had given her
the leisure and the desire for political
activity, and then asked if there was
anything in the sphere of woman's
activities which militated against her
voting. Batkin's speech was one of
the most finished efforts ever delivered
by a Stanford debater. Miller fol
lowed Batkin for the negative and
spent much of his time, as stated
above, in showing how and why the
affirmative should assume the burden
of proof. He then proceeded to main
tain that the suffrage would not im
prove conditions in that the vote of
married men would only be duplicated,
that economically independent wom

en constitute an unstable state of so
ciety having few permanent interests,
and no time to consider public ques
tions, and finally, that the fallen wom
en of the great cities would hold the
balance of power in municipal elec
tions.
Shelton on taking the floor im
mediately accepted the preceediug
speaker's challenge and quoted in
numerable statistics and authorities
which showed that woman suffrage
had been of incalculable benefit in
passing reform measures. He first
established conclusively the point that
women do take advantage of the suff
rage when it is granted. He proved
that a greater percentage of the worn
tn of Colorado vote than the men, and
that the vote of the scarlet women is
only a small per cent of the total
registration. He raised the point that
women are eminently fitted for suff
rage from an educational and moral
viewpoint, and then proceeded to
name an imposing number of good
statutes passed in suffrage states.
Shelton delivered a wonderfully con
vincing speech and made a splendid
impression.
Shipper in speaking for California
denied that women suffrage had been
an aid to good government, and
pointed to conditions in those states
granting it, to prove his point. He
advised against adding the vote of
foreign-born women to that of for
eign-born men and declared that while
this vote would be solid that of in
telligent women would be divided.
Morgan, as third on the affirmative,
held that the preceeding speaker had
taken only isolated cases to prove his
points. He ably refuted many of
Shipper's statements, but made the
unfortunate point spoken of before,
with regard to the status of Western
suffrage states. The new arguments
which he brought forward were very
good and his final summary of the
affirmative arguments was declared
by Judge A. J. Cloud to be one of the
most masterly he had ever listened to.
He again asked California as had Bat
kin as to why our suffrage laws should
rule out all women and keep all men.
With regard to the opposition to the
vote of foreign women he stated that
our foremost settlement workers,
who best understood the aliens, fav
ored equal rights. He dealt at some
length also on the direct and indirect
benefits of suffrage to women person
ally.
Drury, who has been on every Blue
and Gold team since matriculation,
closed for the negative. He objected
to any reference by the affirmative to
intellectual qualifications for voting,
as aside from the question for debate,
and maintained that other influences
