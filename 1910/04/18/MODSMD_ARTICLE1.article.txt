# FALSE RUMOR DENIED
## CARNEGIE FOUNDATION AID WILL BE CONTINUED. President Jordan Brands Statement that Fund Would be Withdrawn from Stanford as Untrue. 
### 
The aid of the Carnegie foundation
for the advancement of science to re
tiring college professors is not to be
withdrawn from Stanford professors
because the standards demanded by
the foundation have not been main
tained at this institution, in spite of
the article appearing in the '"San
Francisco Chronicle" of Sunday, April
17, stating that President Pritchett of
the foundation during his recent west
ern tour had found only the University
of California and the University of
Colorado worthy of the aid from the
foundation. According to President
David Starr Jordan who is vice-chair
man of the foundation it was never
proposed to withdraw aid from Stan
ford, which is one of the oldest mem
bers of the Carnegie foundation, and
that the dispatch printed must have
been incomplete, since the purpose of
President Pritchet,t's western tour
was to determine the state universi
ties that were worthy of aid from the
foundation, as state universities have
never before received aid, and that|
never, at any time, was it proposed to
withdraw Stanford from the list.
President Jordan had the following
statement to make in regard to the
article that appeared and to the pur-j
poses of the foundation:
'â€¢Referring to the discussion of the
relation of different Universities to the
Carnegie Foundation arising from an
incomplete dispatch as to a statement
of President Pritchett, I may say
further:
"The Foundation was organized in
April, 1906, with a Board of twenty
five trustees, mostly university presi
dents, selected by Mr. Carnegie, the
Board being afterward made self-per
petuating. Dr. Henry S. Pritchett,
then president of the Institute of Tech
nology, was elected president of the
Foundation, President Eliot of Har
vard was made chairman, and Presi
dent Jordan of Stanford vice-chair
man, President Thwing of Western
Reserve being secretary.
The purpose of the Foundation was
to pension retiring professors in
American institutions. By the terms
of the grant, institutions under denom
inational control were excluded, it
being Mr. Carnegie's belief that edu
cation should stand on its own feet,
not as an aid to development of indiv
idual churches. At the beginning, for
different reasons, the state universities
were not included, it being the thought
of some of the Board that the states
would themselves initiate a pension
system. In 1909, the state universities
were admitted on the same terms as
the others, and the applications of
various state universities, and of other
institutions, for admission to the mem
bership in the Foundation, are now be
ing considered. Stanford University
was one of the original members, and
therefore is not under consideration
at present. A number of institutions,
otherwise satisfactory, are excluded
because of their affiliation with pro
prietory, medical or law schools. The
