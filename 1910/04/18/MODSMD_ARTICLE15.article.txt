# VAUDEVILLE PLEASES
## CAP AND GOWN PRESENTS SUCCESSFUL BILL. Various Numbers of Field Day Vaudeville Meet With Satisfaction of Crowded Assembly Hall. 
### H. G. FERGUSON 
Replete with the histrionic ability
that generally characterizes theatrical
productions at Stanford, the Field
Meet Vaudeville of last Saturday even
ing was a fitting climax to the well
earned victory of the afternoon. With
a few possible exceptions, the bill as
presented by Cap and Gown met with
the satisfaction of the entire audience,
besides introducing to theatre goers
embryonic thespians who may lie able
to supply the deficiency in material
that is to be felt next year under the
operation of the "one play a semester"
rule.
As headliners, lleman and Brown's
"In After the Meet" and the "Florist's
Shop," as presented by Miss M. L.
Ozier, H. E. Reed and J. H. Forbes,
deserves special mention as acts em
inently suitable for the occasion and
also for the excellent manner in which
they were acted. The first mentioned
playlet, composed as it was of local
color and interest was wonderfully
worked out by the irresistible Vivette
and her well gowned mistress.
Miss M. L. Ozier, '10, the mainstay
of the second-named skit, manifested
her ability to handle roles in vaude
ville as well as she has succeeded in
legitimate acting in heavier parts.
Her vicacity and pipuancy as the shop
girl completely captured an appre
ciative audience.
Much credit is due to Miss L. Corel la
and her corps of able assistants for
the novel entertainment that she gave
to the Stanford public. Her individual
effort was a skillful exhibition of an
advanced type of dancing.
Messrs. L. Y. Mattes, '09, C. E. Samp
son, '09, P. F. Pettigrew, '10. and E. E.
Chase, '11, in their close harmony
were specially welcome in their place
upon the program and the only critic
ism that can be advanced is that their
presence upon the stage was not of
long enough duration.
Although "Op-o'-My-Thumb" con
tained a wonderful piece of character
work well executed by Miss G. D.
Workman, '12, the act was not only
out of place in such an entertainment,
but was too lengthy to hold a place
upon a college vaudeville bill. R. H.
Seward, '12, as Horace Greensmith,
gave a vivid impersonation of the low
er type of the English cockney of the
docks and quays.
Miss M. I. Howell, MO, in her usual
able manner gave her monologue, "in
a Tailor-made Suit," and as customary
captured her auditors with her excel
lent presentation of the same.
Messrs. Meston, Wiggins and Blv,
with the assistance of Professor R. R.
Long, gave an athletic exhibition that,
bordered upon the professional stand
ard.
The Beauty Chorus naturally "took,"
although S. Kennedy did not handle
the situation and his many opportuni
ties as well as one might wish.
Credit is due to Cap and Gown for
the excellence of their entire bill and
also to Sword and Sandals for the
rapid fashion in which the program
was completed.
Wanted. â€”A number of students for
educational work during the summer
vacation. Salary and commission.
Address Box 32, campus.
