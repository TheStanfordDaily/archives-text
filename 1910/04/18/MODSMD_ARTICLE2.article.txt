# SENIORS WILL SMOKE
## 1910 ROW MEN WILL CONDUCT SECOND INFORMAL AFFAIR. Huge Bonfire, Athletic Events, and Singing on Program.â€”Informality is Slogan. 
### 
Tomorrow the second of the three
Senior Smokers to be held this semes
ter, will be given in the hills back of
the University. The affair, this time is
in charge of the Seniors on the Row,
and all the details of management are
in their hands. Matters will be re
versed in the last event of this kind
for the semester, when the Hall men
will be the hosts.
The cavalcade will start from the
Post-office for the rendezous at six
o'clock sharp. The place of meeting
is near the dam, and certain men of
the class have been appointed as
guides to lead the way.
There have been no absolutely defi
nite plans as yet but some features
for the evening are assured. Chief
among these is the big bonfire which
will be ready for touching off, when
the party arrives on the scene. Second
only to the bonfire, in magnificence,
and far surpassing it in importance,
will be the feed that has been planned.
This part of the entertainment will
commence promptly at 7 o'clock.
Following this bodily stimulation
will be some events that are planned
to be of a strictly physical character.
These will be in the nature of athletic
contests of a more or less humorous
character. The events as planned will
be open to all, and the committee in
charge announce that the nature of
the "stunts" precludes the possibility
of anyone being more proficient than
his fellows.
Singing will form the next part of
the evening's entertainment. R. H.
Brown, '10, will lead the songs and
will be assisted by members of the
Glee Club. Besides the singing, there
will be selections by members of the
class who will render selections on
the guitar and mandolin, as well as
accompanying the singing.
The entire affair will be in the na
ture of an informal "rough-house
Jolly-up." Informality will be the
slogan of the evening, and in order
that this may be the better carried
out, the committee requests that all
who attend the "jinks" wear their
oldest and most disreputable clothes,
in no other way, they believe, can the
success of the evening be assured.
The committee announces today, the
appointment of R. H. Brown, '10, to
their number to succeed the vacancy
caused by the resignation of J. E.
Shelton.
