# BREAK SEVEN RECORDS
## SCOTT SHATTERS INTERCOLLEGIATE MARK IN POLE VAULT. Credit for Victory Goes to Men Who Unexptededly Captured Second and Third Places. 
### 
The list of Stanford-California
records will have to be entirely re
written now that the story of Satur
day's meet is told. Seven records
smashed and one equalled is a good
day's work in any meet and especially
considering the events in which the
new marks were made.
The premier performance of the day
was that of Captain Scott in the pole
vault. The leader of the Cardinal
team certainly lived up to his record
and by clearing the bar at 12 feet 6%
inches not only broke a Stanford-Cali
fornia record but also wrecked the
Coast mark.
A hoodoo seems to pursue all the
milers who have ever annexed five
points in an Intercollegiate meet. None
of these men have ever been able to
duplicate the feat and "Tommy" Smith,
the much-feared Callfornian, was no
exception to the rule. Saxon, an un
known quantity in this event missed
C. B. Bradford's record just two-fifths
of a second, finishing some yards to
the good. L. H. Price the Freshman
runner, showed up well. Price passed
Porter on the stretch with a fine
burst of speed and was running much
stronger than Saxon at the finish.
As expected, Edwards, the graceful
Blue and Gold hurdler, captured first
in both events. In company with Don
ald, he tied the 120-yard record of
15:4 held by Cowles, while in the low
events the speedy Californian estab
lished a new mark of 25:1. Eugene
Kern easily covered the course in 25:2,
and for a time it seemed as if he
would defeat the veteran Edwards.
W. M. Wyman, '11, and T. L. Cole
man, '12, showed their heels to their
rivals. Both men can win points any
where, and their records established
yesterday will last for some time.
Wyman crossed the line yards in front
of Butler and would have gone under
50 seconds if forced. The final heat
in the 220-yard dash appeared to be
run in two divisions. Coleman had
the first division all to himself and
was in the training house by the time
Rathbone passed the judges.
G. S. Horine did his usual steady,
careful work in the high jump, and
the breaking of the old record was no
matter of surprise. Although jump
ing in fine form Horine was unable to
clear the bar at the record height of
6 feet 3 inches.
One of the finest features of the
meet was the work of Dole, Peaslee
and Kern. Dole was allowed scarcely
a chance in the shot put, yet when it
came to the real test the big football
player heaved the shot almost a foot
beyond his best previous effort. Prior
to the meet W. D. Peaslee, '10, and E.
F. Kern, '13, were conceded the bare
possibility of claiming one point from
both hurdle events. Instead of one
point, however, these men added four
tallies to the score.
