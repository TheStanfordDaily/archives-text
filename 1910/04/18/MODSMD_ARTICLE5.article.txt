# MATHIEU PICKS CAST
## PLAYERS FOR SENIOR COMEDY ARE SELECTED. Miss A. Wright Will Have Role of "Cousin Kate." â€” Fuller and Morgan are Other Leads. 
### 
Coach Frank L. Mathieu, of San
Francisco, has completed the cast of
the Senior play, "Cousin Kate." The
leads will be played by Miss Adaline
Wright, '10, of Los Angeles, W. P.
Fuller, Jr., '10, of San Francisco, and
G. F. Morgan, '10, of Los Angeles.
The title role of Kate Curtis, cousin
of the Spencers, is in the hands of
Miss Wright. The part is exactly suit
ed to' her personality, and she should
give an excellent performance on
May 19. Miss Wright will be especial
ly remembered for her convincing
work in the difficult role of Lady Jes
sica, in"The Liars," the 1909 Senior
production, and for her sparkling
Jane in the 1910 Sophomore play,
"The Manoeuvers of Jane."
The male lead, Heath Desmond,
will be portrayed by W. P. Fuller, Jr.,
who only recently was seen as Dan
iel Voorhees Pike, of Kokomo, Indi
ana, in"The Man from Home." Des
mond will be Fuller's first ambitious
straight part in Stanford dramatics,
character roles having always fallen
to his lot on previous occasions.
James Bartlett, the village clergy
man, will be no other than Geoffrey
F. Morgan. The fascinating comedy
of the part will be made even more
fascinating by the erstwhile Malvolio,
Almeric St. Aubyn, Sergius, etc., etc.
Morgan was never better cast.
Four other characters complete the
list, the piece demanding only seven
players.
Miss J. A. Heartt, '11, of Los Ange
les, who made her Stanford debut in
a minor role in "Op-o'-My-Thumb"
Saturday night, will be the pretty Amy
Spencer.
The mother, Mrs. Spencer, will be
done by Miss Helen Campbell, '11, of
Palo Alto. Although Miss Campbell
had never appeared in the Assembly
Hall before last Saturday, she has had
abundant experience in dramatics out
side the University.
Master Raymond Richardson, of
Stanford University, will be Amy's
brother, Bobby, a lad of thirteen. And
although this will be the youngster's
debut in dramatics, the committee as
sures the theatre-going public that it
will be far from his last appearance,
so finished will be his interpretation.
Jane, the maid, will be Miss A. A.
Shepardson, '10, of Los Angeles, who
was successful in darning many pairs
of socks during the performance of
"Op-o'-My-Thumb.
