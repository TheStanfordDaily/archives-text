The Committee on Student Affairs
has passed a number of resolutions
which restrict the use of Lake Lagu
nita. No matter how much one may
question the advisability or necessity
of such stringent rules, he must ob
serve them. On the whole, we believe
that the restrictions are wise and jus
tified by past and present conditions.
In only one instance do we seriously
doubt the logic of the committee. We
refer to the statement that "no canoes
in addition ta those now on the lake
shall be used." If sufficient danger
will result from the use of canoes un
der the current restrictions to make
their abolition a year or two hence a
reasonable regulation, and such will
be the effect of the above resolution,
surely the danger is sufficient to forbid
their use at once. If, 011 the other
hand, the danger is insufficient to war
rant immediate abolition, we fail to
see in what manner the risk will in
crease so materially as to justify the
action in the comparatively near fu
ture.
As we stated above, however, the
rules are passed and should be ob
served with strictness.
