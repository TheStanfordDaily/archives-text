# ENTERTAINMENT ON APRIL 23.
## Another Vaudeville to be Presented in Honor of Interscholastic Athletes. 
### 
An entertainment and smoker to be
held in the Encina Club-room in honor
of the visiting high school athletes, is
being arranged for Saturday evening,
April 23, the night of the Interscholas
tic track meet.
In order to make the evening the
most entertaining for both the visitors
and the University public and at the
.same- time not to interfere with the
final work of the semester by having
numerous rehearsals, the committee
has arranged to have the most popular
numbers of the Football Show, the
Minstrel show, and the Cap and Gown
Vaudeville. The committee in charge
is sparing no pains to present the
best entertainment of the year and it
is hoped that no other attraction will
be planned for the same evening which
will prevent the visiting men from
attending.
