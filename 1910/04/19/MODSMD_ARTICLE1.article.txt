# OFFICIALS ARE MANY
## MEN IN CHARGE OF SCHOOLBOY MEET ARE NAMED. Interscholastic Association in Meeting Last Night, Draw up Details for Management. 
### 
The Stanford Interscholastic Asso
ciation, in session last night at the
Zeta Psi house, made out a complete
and lengthy list of men who will act
in official positions at the big school
boy meet on the oval next Saturday
morning and afternoon, the only inter
scholastic track and field event on the
Pacific Coast under the auspices of a
university. Yale, Harvard, Princeton
and other of the larger universities in
the East have such meets under their
wings, and the competing schools
come from an extremely wide radius of
country. The Stanford meeting of
preparatory men is, however more
wide-spread in its influence, perhaps,
than any other in the United States.
The Cardinal meet brings men from a
strip of country 1200 miles long by 500
miles wide, practically the entire Pa
cific Slope. Athletes come from Port
land, Oregon, and Los Angeles, on the
north and south, and Tuscon, Arizona,
on the east. Hardly any university
can boast of such a large and general
representation for a scholastic meet.
A full account of the men entered in
the meet Saturday, over 160 in all,
from over thirty schools, with their
entries in the fourteen events, will be
printed tomorrow night.
The meet takes in all the track and
field events, including the discus
throw, but excepting the two-mile run.
The drawing for heats in the races are
scheduled for tonight, the runners
having sent in their records for time.
With these before them, the Inter
scholastic Association officers will
place the men in heats in such a way
as to be fair to all. Some of the
teams to compete are expected to ar
rive on the campus Thursday, others
will come Friday and Friday night.
Nothing is too good for the athletes
Spokane is sending to the big meet.
The Chamber of Commerce of that
progressive community has secured a
private car for the exclusive use of
the boys and they will travel in style.
The northern trackmen are reputed to
be clever performers and may prove a
surprise to their opponents from
around the bay.
Strict rules in regard to rushing will
be enforced by the Board of Governors.
No visiting athletes can be invited to
any house on the row and the preps
must remain where they are placed.
No entertaining of any kind will be
allowed.

The Stanford Interscholastic Asso
ciation, in session last night at the
Zeta Psi house, made out a complete
and lengthy list of men who will act
in official positions at the big school
boy meet on the oval next Saturday
morning and afternoon, the only inter
scholastic track and field event on the
Pacific Coast under the auspices of a
university. Yale, Harvard, Princeton
and other of the larger universities in
the East have such meets under their
wings, and the competing schools
come from an extremely wide radius of
country. The Stanford meeting of
preparatory men is, however more
wide-spread in its influence, perhaps,
than any other in the United States.
The Cardinal meet brings men from a
strip of country 1200 miles long by 500
miles wide, practically the entire Pa
cific Slope. Athletes come from Port
land, Oregon, and Los Angeles, on the
north and south, and Tuscon, Arizona,
on the east. Hardly any university
can boast of such a large and general
representation for a scholastic meet.
A full account of the men entered in
the meet Saturday, over 160 in all,
from over thirty schools, with their
entries in the fourteen events, will be
printed tomorrow night.
The meet takes in all the track and
field events, including the discus
throw, but excepting the two-mile run.
The drawing for heats in the races are
scheduled for tonight, the runners
having sent in their records for time.
With these before them, the Inter
scholastic Association officers will
place the men in heats in such a way
as to be fair to all. Some of the
teams to compete are expected to ar
rive on the campus Thursday, others
will come Friday and Friday night.
Nothing is too good for the athletes
Spokane is sending to the big meet.
The Chamber of Commerce of that
progressive community has secured a
private car for the exclusive use of
the boys and they will travel in style.
The northern trackmen are reputed to
be clever performers and may prove a
surprise to their opponents from
around the bay.
