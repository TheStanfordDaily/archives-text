ments, 480 pages printed on the finest
grade of paper obtainable, and will be
bound so substantially as to make it
a book which will keep its shape a
life time. The poor grade of binding

faction that those in charge of the
present annual have gone out of
their way to get a better grade of
work.
Undoubtedly one of the finest de
partments in the book will be the dra
matic section. Owing to the fact that
the past year has seen the greatest
number of plays in the histronic his

have not appeared in the windows, of
a scene from each play, but a number
of individual poses of leading actors
will be seen. The whole department
has been beautifully decorated by the
professional brush of A. P. Hill. '13,
thus adding greatly to the general
beauty of the book. Altogther 24 half
tones, as well as individual criticisms
of each play, will make up the depart
ment.
A new feature of the art department
