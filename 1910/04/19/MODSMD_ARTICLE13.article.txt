The Lagunita Boat Club, supported
by its own enthusiasm alone and in no
way assisted by the Student Body,
perpetuated rowing as a Stanford
sport during the present year and
sent forth two crews, both of which
triumphed over their rivals of the
Blue and Gold. The same Lagunita
Boat Club is now planning to race
against Washington in the north dur
ing the latter part of May and, to as
sist in defraying the financial deficit
necessarily attendant upon the trip,
intends to give an informal dance in
Palo Alto on April 29. The Student
Body, collectively, has denied its aid to
rowing, but the Student Body, individ
ually, now has an opportunity to ren
der material assistance.
