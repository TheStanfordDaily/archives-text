Anyone who attended the Intercol
legiate track meet last Saturday will
recall the annoying tactics of one of
the Bine and Gold two-milers during
the running of the long race. We saw
no necessity for mentioning the dis
agreeable occurrence, but in justice to
the university across the bay we de
sire to reprint the following statement
which appeared editorially in the
"Daily Californian" yesterday morn
ing:
"There was one incident, however,
which elicited comment exceedingly
unfavorable to California, and which
marred an otherwise splendid contest.
The conduct of one of the Blue and |
Gold entries in repeatedly claiming a
foul in the two-mile run, gave every
appearance of being an unsportsman
like attempt to unfairly disqualify the
Stanford runner who won the race.
That the referee did not allow the
claims of foul, would seem to indicate
that they were groundless, and that
Stanford is justified in making the in
ference that the California athlete was
acting in bad faith. This was the con
struction placed upon the incident by
the majority of the spectators. We are

glad the attempt was unsuccessful. A
victory won by such tactics could give
no satisfaction to a student body whose
athletic standards are so uniformly
high as are California's."
