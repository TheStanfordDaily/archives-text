The "Snapshots of Stanford Life,"
by G. F. Morgan, '10, which have ap
peared from time to time in the "Se
quoia" during the past year, are to be
published in booklet form. These
breezy sketches of the different phases
of life at Stanford are now being re
vised and certain corrections and ad
ditions made. As there is to be no
English Club year-book during the
present semester this clever, though
tiny, volume will doubtless have a
large sale.
