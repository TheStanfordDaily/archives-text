# PRESIDENT JORDAN TO ADDRESS ASSEMBLY TOMORROW MORNING
## 
### 
Tomorrow at the 9:15 period Presi
dent Jordan will speak at the second
regular Assembly of the month on |
"Taking Politics Out of Politics" at
the Assembly Hall. Dr. Jordan has
spoken before on this topic, and ac
cording to press reports this speech
has created great interest whereever
it has been heard.
During the last year, the President
has made public his opinion regarding
political subjects, and consequently
bis remarks have had much influence.

The Assembly tomorrow will be a
timely one in view of the nature of
the speaker's subject, as this is the
year in which the administrators of Cal
ifornia are elected, and at the present
time aspirants for such positions are
proclaiming their opinions to the gen
eral public. As Dr. Jordan's topic
indicates a different method of dealing
with institutions now managed solely
by political organizations, his idea of
their control will be not only interest
ing, but new.
