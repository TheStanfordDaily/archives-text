# JOURNALISTS AT WAR.
## Bitter Struggle Will Oceur on Stanford Oval.â€”"Chaparral" vs. Daily Palo Alto. 
### 
Until today it was an absolute fact
that the Intel-scholastic track meet
next Saturday would be, the last really
great track event to occur on the Stan
ford oval this semester, but plana
have now matured for a later truly
wonderful struggle, a battle that will
equal and probably eclipse any prev
ious single sensation in the athletic
annals of the University. A relay mar
athon between the staffs of the "Chap
arral" and the"Daily Palo Alto" is the
feature of this momentous occasion.
Twelve husky journalists from each of
the aforementioned publications will
enter the lists, prepared for a deadly
fight. Every combatant will be supposed
to traverse 220 yards, although some
doubt has been expressed as to the
possibility of such a laborious feat in
the case of a few of the individuals
concerned. The total distance, if all
goes well, will be, therefore, a mile
and a half. It has been so arranged
that the first furlong will be the most
exciting of the entire race, for it is in
that relay that the respective editors,
G. F. Morgan and W. P. Fuller, Jr.,
will compete one against the other.
The exact date of the contest will be
announced later.
