# GODDESS OF DANCE TO REIGN.
## Terpsichore Will Hold High Carnival in Armory Hall on Night of Boat-club Ball. 
### 
The goddess of dancing will reign
supreme in Armory Hall one week
from next Saturday night, the evening
of the Lagunita Boat Club's big bene
fit. Captivating music, a smooth floor,
and the delightful charm attached to
an informal, should all combine to
make this dance one of the pleasant
est of the season. It will be the last
general college dance before the Sen
ior Ball.
The music is to be furnished by
Brohaska of San Jose, who will be
on hand with an orchestra of at least
eight pieces. The program of waltzes
and two-steps will include all the lat
est song and dance successes, as well
as some of the older favorites.
Sixteen regulars and two extras
will make up the dance card. The
first dance is scheduled to start at
7:30 o'clock. This will allow plenty
of time in which to run in a number
of "offs."
Tickets may be obtained at the Book
store and from members of the club
at the price of $2.
