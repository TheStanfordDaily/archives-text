"Taking Politics Out of Politics"
was the unique subject selected by
President Jordan for his talks in As
sembly Hail this morning. The ad
dress constituted a review of the con
dition that American politics are now
in and also a resume of the various
evils that have arisen within the gov
ernment of the nation within the past
twenty years. Dr. Jordan also sub
mitted his ideas of the direction in
which the reforms for these evils
should take and the manner in which
they should be accomplished.
The speaker condemned politics at
the present time as an opportunity
for men to wave the partisan (lag for
their own interest and aggrandize
ment, with the privilege of ohtianing
personal gain under color of working
for the benefit of the national as a
whole. According to Dr. Jordan, one
of the most important fields from
which politics should be eradicated
and in which there is a strong ten
dency to do so, is that of education.
President Jordan explained the
growth of the system of securing men
for governmental work and the devel
opment of the civil service from the
time when appointees obtained their
synecures by the influence that they
held over congressmen or persons
connected with those in authority. He
also explained the policy of the de
partments of government in sending
out notices to all colleges when men
are wanted and the acceptance of col
lege men from these institutions who
have successfully passed the com
petitive examinations.
"Government of the nation by part
ies is not permanent," said Dr. Jordan,
"there is a tendency to develop na
tional opinions along lines of thought
on national questions. There is no
difference of any significance between
the parties in the United States at the
present time. As has been said, one is
now occupying the trough and the
other is trying to get into the same
place. The consumer represents the
trough and he suffers consequently."
The speaker mentioned the founding
of the Smithsonian Institute by Profes
sor Baird for the purpose of allowing
thinkers and investigators of sinking
their individualities in the institution
to work upon the solution of natural
problems that affect the entire nation
in their application, such as the pure
food question, immigration problem,
etc. This investigation should be
carried on to a greater extent at Wash
ington. according to President Jordan,
and the legislation and administration
upon the same should depend upon the
findings of these thinkers'. Dr. Jordan
believes that the national government
should do everything that the govern
ment could do with benefit to the na
tion.
In speaking of the corporations and
their influence upon the business
world in the United States, President
Jordan said, "the big corporation com
petes with us unfairly. It does not
die and has no vicissitudes. It is very
unfortunate when a corporation goes
into politics to secure its ends. Unfair

competition exists between the cor
poration and the individual."
The speaker in concluding his re
marks, spoke against the protective
tariff system as a violation to equality
before the law and then proceded to
show what advantages the native
would obtain from governmental in
vestigation of immigration, sanitation,
the pure food question, the establish
ment of universal peace and problems
of this nature.
