Stanford is fortunate to possess a
track team which can not make any
but a creditable record, should it be
sent to the annual Western Conference
meet for 1910. Such an opportunity
should not be overlooked, and every
resource should be exhausted in an
endeavor to make the trip a reality.
The Cardinal has twice made a deter
mined bid for first place in the big
meet, and, if figures mean anything,
a similar attempt this year should be
crowned with victory. The team has
earned the right to the journey, and
we hope that the Executive Committee
may see fit to render aid.
