# NOTED SPEAKER ON THURSDAY.
## Rev. Charles R. Brown, of Oakland, to Again appear on Platform in Assembly Hall. 
### 
Rev. Charles R. Brown of the First
Congregational Church of Oakland,
who is to deliver a lecture in the As
sembly Hall on Thursday evening, is
probably one of the best known pulpit
orators and lecturers on the Pacific
Coast. For a number of semesters he
was connected with the Stanford Fac
ulty as lecturer in the Ethics depart
ment and if for no other reason will
be remembered by the people of the
community for his address at the
Mausoleum during the funeral services
of Mrs. Stanford. The lecture for
Thursday evening, entitled "Abraham
Lincoln," is one that Dr. Brown has
used for several years and it has won
him favorable comment wherever de
livered.
On Thursday afternoon at 3:30 Rev
Brown will also address the men of
the University in the Chapel, using as
a subject "The Highest Form of Re
ward." The lecture in the Assembly
Hall is scheduled for 8 o'clock.
