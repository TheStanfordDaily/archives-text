Stanford has few annual institutions
which are of such extereme benefit to
the University as is the Interscholastic
track meet. Each year this event al
lows almost two hundred young ath
letes, the cream of the men in all the
principal high schools of the Pacific
Coast, to view Stanford at close range
under the most favorable circum
stances, and we venture the assertion
that many a visitor then makes up his
mind for the first time that Stanford is
the place for him. Consequently, it is
for our own good that the Interschol
astic be perpetuated. The governing
board states, however, that unless in
the future more support is accorded
the meet by the Student Body than
has been the rule in the past, its in
definite continuation will be an utter
impracticability. Therefore, for the
good of Stanford we urge upon every
one the advisability of assisting mater
ially to prevent an ultimate abandon
ment of the annual Interscholastic.
