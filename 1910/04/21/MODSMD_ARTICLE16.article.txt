# EMBLEMS GRANTED
## CREW, BASEBALL, TENNIS, AND TRACK MEN GET LETTERS. Forty-six Men Given Privileges to Wear Letter.â€”Poor and Scott Given Four Stars. 
### 
At the regular weekly meeting of
the Executive Committee held last
evening, by far the most important
business transacted was the voting of
emblems to all men who have partici
pated in athletic events for the second
semester of 1910. The sports covered
were track, baseball, crew, and tennis.
Besides this, there was active discus
sion of the advisability of awarding a
uniform medal to all men . who are
eligible to wear the block letter; the
possibility of making tennis a minor
sport with a different emblem than that
worn by other varsity teams; the
awarding of the medals to the repre
sentatives of the University in the Car
not and Intercollegiate debates of the
year; and a discussion of the proposed
amendments to the Constitution of
the Student Body.
The awarding of letters to the men
who rowed on the winning crew came
as somewhat of a surprise, to those
who were not strictly informed as to
the attitude of the Committee.
The men who were awarded the
Varsity emblems in crew were: R. R.
Hails, '12, J. C. Huston, '10, J. W. Rob
erts, '10, L. Hofer, '13, R. H. Seward,
'12, C. L. Schaupp, '12, H. L. Dietterle,
'12, R. A. Gilmore, '12, J. F. Partridge,
'12.
The men who played in the Inter
collegiate baseball series and who
were given the emblem were: G. Mc-
Gregor, '09, H. E. Reed, '10, C. F Gan
ong, '10, M. Mitchell, '10, L. H. Coch
ran, '10, B. L. Ball, '11, S. W. Gilflllan,
'12, M. Obear, '12, L. Childs, '13, S.
Mitchell, '13, R. C. McFadden, '10.
Points in the last Intercollegiate
meet were won for the Cardinal by H.
L. Horton, 'OS, H. R. *09, L.
Scott, '10, S. H. Bellah, '10, J. E. Shel
ton, '10, H. E. Reed, '10, H. V. Poor,
'10, W. D. A. Peaslee, '10, W. S. Porter,

W. H. Newman, '12, R. B. Carter,'l2, E.
P. Kern, '13, L. H. Price, '13, G. L.
Horine, '13, W. M. Argabrite, '13.
Four stars were awarded to two
men for work on the track. The men
who have won points for the Cardinal
for four years are: L. S. Scott, '10,
and H. V. Poor, '10. Scott's events
were the pole vault and the sprints,
while Poor won his points in the high
jump.
Emblems for tennis were awarded
to: H. Mann, '10, H. S. Morgan, '12,
R. L. Murray, '13, G. L. Shaul, '13.
There has been considerable talk
among the athletes of the University
about granting a uniform medal to be
given to Varsity athletes. Although
nothing definite was done last evening
the plan most favored seemed to be,
that such a medal be made and that
the athletes have the choice of taking
the medal, or a sweater. In either
case the athlete would have the privi
lege of buying the emblem which he
did not choose.
In other universities where tennis is
recognized as a sport, it is customary
to grant a special emblem denoting
the branch of sports in which the em
blem was won. This would place
tennis on the list of minor but recog
nized sports. It also seems that soc
cer, may, in the near future assume a
similar importance, and at that time
it seems probable that it will be placed
on the same basis as tennis if this ac
tion is passed on favorably.
The men who were voted medals for
work on Intercollegiate debates were:
G. F. Morgan, '10, P. J. Batkin, '10, J.
E. Shelton, '10, and R. J. Miller, '11,
Morgan and Batkin on both the teams
for 1910.
After an active discussion of the
proposed amendments the meeting ad
journed.

Emblems for tennis were awarded

There has been considerable talk
among the athletes of the University
about granting a uniform medal to be
given to Varsity athletes. Although
nothing definite was done last evening
the plan most favored seemed to be,
that such a medal be made and that
the athletes have the choice of taking
the medal, or a sweater. In either
case the athlete would have the privi
lege of buying the emblem which he
did not choose.
In other universities where tennis is
recognized as a sport, it is customary
to grant a special emblem denoting
the branch of sports in which the em
blem was won. This would place
tennis on the list of minor but recog
nized sports. It also seems that soc
cer, may, in the near future assume a
similar importance, and at that time
it seems probable that it will be placed
on the same basis as tennis if this ac
tion is passed on favorably.
The men who were voted medals for
work on Intercollegiate debates were:
G. F. Morgan, '10, P. J. Batkin, '10, J.
E. Shelton, '10, and R. J. Miller, '11,
Morgan and Batkin on both the teams
for 1910.
After an active discussion of the
proposed amendments the meeting ad
journed.
At the regular weekly meeting of
the Executive Committee held last
evening, by far the most important
business transacted was the voting of
emblems to all men who have partici
pated in athletic events for the second
semester of 1910. The sports covered
were track, baseball, crew, and tennis.
Besides this, there was active discus
sion of the advisability of awarding a
uniform medal to all men . who are
eligible to wear the block letter; the
possibility of making tennis a minor
sport with a different emblem than that
worn by other varsity teams; the
awarding of the medals to the repre
sentatives of the University in the Car
not and Intercollegiate debates of the
year; and a discussion of the proposed
amendments to the Constitution of
the Student Body.
The awarding of letters to the men
who rowed on the winning crew came
as somewhat of a surprise, to those
who were not strictly informed as to
the attitude of the Committee.
The men who were awarded the
Varsity emblems in crew were: R. R.
Hails, '12, J. C. Huston, '10, J. W. Rob
