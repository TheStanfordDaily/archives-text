# High School Athletes Meet Saturday
## ATHLETES SUSPENDED HORTON AND CRAWFORD WILL BE ASKED TO LEAVE. Official Announcement of Committee to be Made Monday.â€”"Sequoia" Appears Responsible. 
### 
David Paul Crawford, of Cupertino,
and Harry Leonard Horton, of Ukiah,
will be suspended from the University
for the rest of the semester, the pen
alty to be announced by the Student
Affairs Committee and to take effect
on Monday next. The story leaked out
today, however, and the men in ques
tion admit its truth. They say that the
Student Affairs Committee kindly con
sented to withhold the announcement
until after the Interscholastic in de
ference to them, and that there is no
doubt that the action will be made offi
cially public on Monday.
The grounds for the suspension were
apparently first brought to the notice
of the committee by a recent article in
the "Sequoia," of which R. J. Miller,
'11, of Hanford, was the author.
The affair was then several months
old, and from the inaction of the com
mittee, it is apparent that the matter
had not before been brought to heir
attention. As the charge, if true, was
in direct contravention of the com
mittee's rules, the men who supervise
student affairs had no choice but to
investigate, which they did. Having
satisfied themselves that the real facts
proved a breaking of the rules, suspen
sion was the only course left open to
the committee. The penalty was made
as mild as possible. The "Sequoia's"
charge is very evidently responsible
for the cause of the original undertak
ing of such an investigation.
Seldom have two men done more for
Stanford than have Horton and Craw
ford, both of whom would have re
ceived their degrees next month.
Horton entered college in the fall
of 1904. He was a Varsity tackle in
his Sophomore year and won fame on
the track from the start. He took
many points for the Cardinal in the
shot put and the hurdles, and he cap
tained the track men during the spring
of 1909. Last fall he reappeared on
the gridiron and played front rank in
the Varsity scrum. He belongs to the
Quadrangle Club, Skull and Snakes,
and Encina Club. He was a member
of the Executive Committee] in his
Sophomore year and is now president
of the Interscholastic Association.
Crawford is also a member of En
cina Club, the Quadrangle Club, and
Skull and Snakes. He is a four-star
Varsity football man, captaining the
team in his Senior year. Crawford
also has been a very valuable track
man, holding the Stanford record In
both the hammer throw and the shot
put. He won points at Chicago in 1908
and 1909, in the latter year tying with
,T. O. Miller, for individual honors,
each of them making ten tallies. Craw
ford was president of his class in his
Junior year and is president of the
Student Advisory Committee.
