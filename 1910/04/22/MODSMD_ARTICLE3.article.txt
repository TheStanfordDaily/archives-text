# OVER 150 ENTRIES FOR STRUGGLE
## Track and Field Events of Fifth Interscholastic Will Be Contested On Cardinal Oval.â€”--Almost Forty Schools Represented. 
### 
"To promote good sportsmanship
among the schools of the Pacific
Slope" will tomorrow be the reason
for the gathering of 150 schoolboy
athletes on the Cardinal oval under
the care of the Stanford Interscholas
tic Association. This is the fifth year
of the big meet for secondary schools,
and each new season has seen an
encouraging and noteworthy increase
in the number of athletes and schools
represented. The first meeting of the
preparatory schools five springs ago
boasted of a representation of twenty
three institutions. With between
thirty-six and thirty-nine competing
this year the gain is easy to see. Each
year the circle of representation in the
meet has widened and the interest has
increased rapidly.
To whom will go the victory in the
meet tomorrow? It is difficult to ac
curately judge, because of the great
numbers of men whose performances
and records are known only by hear
say, or known merely by the marks
sent in by the men to the secretary of
the Interscholastic Association, forth a
purpose of giving the men fair places
in heats and for general information.
Healdsburg took first place last year,
with twenty points. Beeson, her ver
satile star, was responsible for nine of
the points and he is not with the team
today. Young, to be depended upon in
the pole vault, is to be here this year
with Scatena, who has a record of 4G
feet, 7 1 /& inches in the 12-lb shot put.
It is hardly probable, however, that
the school will be able to get more
than fourth or fifth place tomorrow.
Looking at the situation from mere
numbers Berkeley High and Oakland
High each have twenty-four entries.
Oakland, however, had as many men
in the meet last year as are entered
now, and yet was not dangerous. But
they will bring down on Saturday
several men who may be classed as
much closer to stars than any of their
men last season, and who may be
looked upon to put Oakland farther up
towards the top in the points, if not
at the very top. They have Todd with
a record of 51:1 in the quarter, Mills

in the mile with the comparatively
good time of 4:47 and Maclise in the
low hurdles doing 26:2.
Berkeley High was fifth last year
with a big list of entries. This year
the team apparently has a better
chance, from comparative records,
leaving out of consideration the num
ber of athletes representing the
school. Berkeley has men doing 10:1
in the century, Wood, 23:2 in the fur
long, Scott and Wood, 52:3 in the 440;
4:42 in the mile 20 ft. 6 inches in the
broad; 160 ft. 8 inches in the hammer;
and 5:9 in the high jump, Ostraiuler
and Steel. These men should be good
for seconds and thirds at least, with
perhaps one or two here and there
for first places, taking into account
what the other teams can do by com
parative records. The mile and the
high jump gold medals will very near
ly go to the preparatory school across
the bay. Alameda has a star here and
there. Cummins in the 440 has a repu
tation for doing 51:1, and 23:1 in the
220. Other men in the high and broad
jumps will possibly bring them a few
more points to get the school a place
at the top. There being more teams
entered this year, the total of points
for the first five places in the meet will
by all laws of the track be reduced
appreciably.
Lowell will be found to be well up in
the list, with a few marks gleaned
from second and third places. The
speedy Meyer, who made a big show
ing last year, will be their mainstay
in the 220 and 440.
Chico Normal School will be a very
strong opponent of any team for the
premier position and the Stanford cup.
It is not improbable also that their
great weight man, Rice, may take the
individual honors and the Encina cup
with the greatest number of points.
Rice is away ahead of anyone in the
hammer and shot. He throws the
12-lb hammer 175 feet, and 4 inches, a
very good record and one that has a
good chance to lower the Stanford in
terscholastic mark. He puts the shot
50 feet, 1 inch, and with any degree of
