Eight records shattered and a con
sistant performance by the high
school athletes in all events from all
teams made the fifth Stanford Inter
scholastic one of the best high school
meets that has ever been held around
the San Francisco Bay in many years.
Not only were the records broken but
some of them were so badly shattered
that they will stand at their pres
ent mark for some time to come.
The day was one of those which
forebodes the breaking of former
marks in the various events especially
in the track contests. Over two thou
sand spectators witnessed the high
school competitors in their annual
struggle for track supremacy and
prominent in the bleachers were the
enthusiastic supporters of the var
ious school aggregations. Oakland
and Berkeley enlivened the quiet
moments by their strenuous and in
teresting vocal encouragement of
their representatives.
Chico with her six entries consist
ently piled up points for her score,
hard pressed by Oakland High School
athletes. The meet was won by the
former institution by her victory in
the pole vault which decided the con
test.
Mile Run.
Hood River, as represented by their
sole entry, Huggins was credited with
establishing a new record in the mile
run, and furnished one of the many
surprises of the day. The sturdy
fighter established a lead in the back
stretch and steadily maintained his
advantage. This new record is within
1-5 of a second of the time made by
K. F. Lee formerly of Harvard Acad
emy of 4:39:1.
100-Yard Dash.
The finals in the 100-yard dash
proved to be as exciting as was ex
pected and furnished one of the best
exhibitions during the meet. The Ber
keley representative was responsible
for much of the excellent showing
made as he ran a wonderful race
finishing strong and pulling away
from Rogers in the final spurt for the
tape.
120-Yard Hurdles.
Ward had the race in the high hur
dles his own way throughout f he
event, while Lee of Chico succeeded in
securing his place during the last ten
yards of his race. Maclise was not
running up to his usual form and was
disqualified by the judges for knock
ing down three hurdles.
440-Yard Hash.
Todd started out in the 440 with
the lead and led up the back stretch
with Cummins pressing the winner
closely for a lead on the second curve.
The finish down the last 100 yards

was very close and the first placed
was won by Todd with the margin of
three yards.
220-Yard Hurdles.
The low hurdles developed a pretty
race between Lee of Chico and Mac
lise of Berkeley down to the last hur
dle where the second place man lost
his stride, stumbled and was beaten
out for first place from the last hur
dle. The Chico man led all the way
down the stretch and was only beaten
by a short distance in the final. This
is clipping almost a second off the
Interscholastic record that was for
merly held by Beeson at 26:2. The
new mark is 25:3.
880-Yard Run.
Although McClure from Los Angeles
High School was upon the outside of
the pack in the start of the half mile,
he soon took the pole as second man
upon the first turn. Upon the second
lap the speedy prep took the lead
and maintained his position all the
way round leading the runners by
five yards, never losing his hold upon
his position. He finished easily.
220-Yard Hash.
In the record breaking 220-yard
dash, Rogers and Thomas ran a close
and exciting race each maintaining a
fast pace all the way down the stretch.
As will be seen by the excellent time
made in the race the running was of
the highest quality for high school
performers.
Relay.
Lowell High drew the pole and
the first lap was a fight between the
San Franciscans and San Jose with
Berkeley third.
On the second round Lowell was
first and Berkeley second with the
ultimate winners third. On the next
circuit San Jose worked into second
place and assumed the lead at the
opening of the final lap. Woods of
Berkeley made a determined effort to
close the gap but was unsuccessful.
Field Events.
The Chico giant Rice succeeded in
adding laurels to his list by annexing
two records to his credit. By the
wonderful heave of 49 ft., 8V& in.this
immense high school athlete wrecked
the mark that was established by
Munn in his remarkable career as an
athlete. The Chico heavy weight is
a prospective record breaker of the
first calibre and should be heard
from in the near future.
The hammer-throw shed another
surprise during the progress of the
meet. The heavy weight, Rice, from
Chico broke the long standing record
that was secured by the Stanford
star track performer Tomasini in his
high school days in 1906. Rice's new
mark was extended to 180 ft, 7 in.
Within one and one-half inches of
the world's Interscholastic record,
the high-jump mark as set by Ward of
Los Angeles Polytechnic was one of
the unexpected surprises of the day.
This shatters the previous record for

the Pacific Coast held by Argabrite of
Ventura which was established by him
at 5 ft., 10 5-8.
Young in the pole vault won the
meet for the Chico representatives,
while he also succeeded in establish
ing a new record of 11 ft., 7 1-2 in.
