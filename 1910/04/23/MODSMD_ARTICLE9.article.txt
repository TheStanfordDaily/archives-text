# TOURNAMENT IS FAST
## FINALS NOW BEING PLAYED ON ENCINA COURTS. Fottrell Brothers and Johnson and Griffith Contesting for Doubles Championship. 
### 
Only the finals in both the singles
and doubles remain to be played in
the first Stanford Interscholastic
tennis tournament and these matches
will be played immediately after the
track meet. The tournament was a
greater success than even the most
sanguine supporters had expected and
there is no doubt that they will be
held every year hereafter. The class
of tennis put up by some of these
high school stars was such that Var
sity men will soon have to look to
their laurels. The work of little
Strachan the Lowell High School
shark was particularly noticeable.
