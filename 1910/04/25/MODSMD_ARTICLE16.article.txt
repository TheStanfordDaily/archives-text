# ALL-STARS WIN, 4 to 1.
## Olympics Lose Slow Game to Stanford Soccer Men on Saw Dust Field Saturday Afternoon. 
### 
In a game full of fouls and decidedly
lacking in the class usually shown, the
Stanford All-Stars won from the
Olympic Club of San Francisco on Sat
urday by a score of 1 to 1. During the
tirst half Stanford negotiated one goal.
In the second period Stanford started
off with a rush and before the time
was half up had added three more
scores to her credit. In the latter part
of the half the Olympics showed a
flash of their old time form and were
able by clever dribbling and passing to
annex one goal, but from here on
neither side could raise their score.
The particular stars of the game
were Erb and McCann, the former by
his clever dribbling and accurate
passes, and the latter by his fine kick
ing in the back field, saved the Stan
l'or goal from many close calls. The
Stanford line-up is as follows;
Forwards—Hubbard, Doron, Erb,
Multatier, and Williams; halves, Ham
ilton, Rannals, and King; fulls, Mc-
Cann and Tucker.
