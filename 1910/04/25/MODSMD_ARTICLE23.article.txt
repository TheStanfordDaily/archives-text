# Programs on Sale at Bookstore
## 
### 
A limited number of the souvenir
programs for the Intercollegiate track
meet last Saturday remained unsold
at the conclusion of the meet, and the
managers have decided to place them
on sale at the Stanford Bookstore,
where they now can be procured for
ten cents a copy. As the demand is
unexpectedly large, the small supply
will be exhausted with little delay .
