# INVITE OARSMEN TO COMPETE.
## Pacific Association Wants Lagunita Boat Club to Enter Crew in Regatta of May 8. 
### 
The Pacific Association of Amateur
Oarsmen through their secretary, A.
G. Bell of San Francisco, has extended
an invitation to the Lagunita Boat
Club to participate in an Interclub
regatta on May 8. The course selected
is at Acquatic Park on San Francisco
bay at the foot of Van Ness avenue.
According to the schedule of events
there will be Junior, Intermediate and
Senior four oared barge races, with
coxswain, and Junior and Senior skiff
races. The course will be a mile and
a half with a turn. The use of one of
the city club's barges has been offered
the local men.
The Lagunita oarsmen will be
classed in this regatta according to
their standing in the University races:
that is, a Junior crew would be one
that had never won a race against
another club or college, an Intermed
iate, one that had won a race against
a Junior opponent, and a crew would
be a Senior if they had won either an
Intermediate or Senior race.
In extending the invitation the sec
retary of the Association said in part:
"We desire very much to have the
University clubs participate in our re
gattas, and the spirit you showed at
the Portola races leads us to believe
that you will join with us."
Arrangements will in all probability
bo made to enter a Senior four in the
regatta. The oarsmen will be the
stern four of the eight.
The inability of all the members of
the victorious eight to go to Redwood
yesterday prevented the holding of the
election for next year's captain.
