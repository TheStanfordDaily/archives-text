# Important Senior Meeting Tuesday.
## 
### 
The Senior Class will meet tomor
row in room 68 at 1:10 o'clock. Pres
ident L. Scott, who has called the
meeting, announces that many matters
of the most extreme importance will
be discussed at this session and that
it is imperative that a large atten
dance be a reality. Scott deems it
best to withhold the precise nature
of the things to be considered, but
states that the opinion of the class os
a whole will be a necessity at tomor
row's meeting and therefore urges
that every Senior be present.
