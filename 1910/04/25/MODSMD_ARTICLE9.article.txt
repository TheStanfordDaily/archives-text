# WILL MAKE RECORDS
## RICE CHICO IS A WONDER IN THE WEIGHT EVENTS Hood River Hugging Will Register in August.â€”J.O. Miller May be Relegated to the Rear. 
### 
Chico with three point-winners cap
tured the most interesting Inter
scholastic meet ever held under the
auspices of the Stanford Association.
Rice, the giant weight man, was the
hero of the day, capturing with con
sumate ease first place in both of his
events. This athlete is a perfect speci
men of manhood and attracted con
siderable wonderment by the grace
with which he performed. Standing
six feet six inches in his stocking feet
and tipping the scales at a point over
200 pounds, this man is a Ralph Rose
and A1 Plaw combined. Talbot, the
Mercersburg hammer-thrower, used
three turns in making his world's In
terscholastic record with the 12 pound
hammer. Rice, taking only one turn,
came within eleven feet of Talbot's
mark. On Friday, Rice attempted to
heave the 1G pound weight and without
any apparent effort, placed it a dis
tance of 146 feet from the ring.
Lee, a teammate of Rice, showed
class in the high and low hurdles. In
both events, he lost first place by ac
cidents and in the 220-yard event was
at least two feet ahead of Maclise up
to the last hurdle. The Chico man
did not gauge his distance in going
over the last obstacle and struck the
hurdle.
As an aftermath of the meet, comes
the announcement that Huggins, the
lone Hood River entry, will register
with the class of 1914. Huggins is a
novice at the game, having had scarce
ly any training, but his running Satur
day showed the greatest possibilities.
One week ago the Oregon man in an
indoor meet at Portland traversed the
distance in 4:39. He has a world of
endurance and under "Dads" watchful
eye should be able to cut many seconds
from this time.
A sprinter whose progress will be
watched with interest is Rogers of C.
S. M. A. When any runner, scarcely
16 years old, in the furlong event, can
cross the tape just 22.2 seconds after
the gun is fired, it is a wonderful per
formance.
The vaudeville performance at En
cina Saturday evening proved to be a
novel treat for the high school boys.
The most enjoyable number of the
whole evening was the presentation of
the trophies by the inimitable John O.
Miller. Heretofore, the veteran run
ner has been considered a fairly good
sized man but when the giant Rice
was called up to receive his individual
trophy, the look of pained surprise on
Miller's face as he glanced up at the
Chico man was startling. Owing to the
fact that Rice and Ward, the Los Ange
les jumper, each scored ten points,
Encina Club decided to present cups
to both of the men; both trophies to be
exactly alike.
