Professor A. B. Clark, chairman of

day posted the following announce
ment:
"The principal information in regard
to the offense in Encina Hall of Nov
ember 20, leading to the suspension of
two students, reached the Committee
on Student Affairs in February and
from sources not connected with the
college journals. The articles pub
lished in these journals in March con
tributed no information as to this of
fense not in the knowledge of the
Committee at that time, and the con
cluding evidence was furnished only
very recently and from sources in no
way connected with the articles in the
college journals.

A. B. Clark, when asked as to the
above announcement, said:
"To one who knows the facts, the
above statement does not in any way
contradict the following statement of
the Daily Palo Alto of April 22:
" 'We' are convinced that had it not
been for the articles of the 'Sequoia',
the Committee on Student Affairs
would never have inaugurated an in
vestigation; but it is rather a fuller
statement of the matters involved.'"
