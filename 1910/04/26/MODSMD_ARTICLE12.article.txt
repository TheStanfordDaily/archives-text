# "QUAD" SELLS MONDAY
## BIG JUNIOR ANNUAL WILL BE SEEN MAY 2. Josh Department Excites Lively Interest.â€”Remarkable Pictures in Athletic and College Year Sections. 
### 
Only six more days remain until the
campus will have in its own hands
that for which it has been looking for
ward to for fully a year, the big, hand
somely printed, firmly bound, 480 page,
1911 "Quad." Manager C. A. Christin,
after noting the progress of the bind
ery for the last three days, states
that without doubt he will place the
Junior annual on sale at 8:15 next
Monday morning at the Law steps.
The price will be $2.50, as in the past,
and the supply limited, so it will be
incumbent upon the Cardinal villagers
to begin saving their spare shekels
immediately. The price of the book
will not be reduced next year.
All who have had the privilege of
seeing portions of the printed book de
clare it to be the most complete and
finished "Quad" as yet published and
are willing to assume all responsibil
ity to those who would buy the volume
on their recommendation.
Fully five hundred dollars more than
has ordinarily been spent for pictures,
cuts and printing has been expended
by the management to make the book
the complete record which the "Quad"
Board wished it to be. Every depart
ment has been enlarged and there is
an average of one engraving for each
page throughout the entire volume.
When the amount of statistical matter
which appears in every "Quad" is con
sidered, this is a high average. Prob
ably the most agreeable change in the
annual will be the tasteful way in
which the faculty list and the Senior
honor record has been embellished by
the wonderful pen and ink work of A.
P. Hill, '13,
Undoubtedly the Josh Department
will prove the most interesting part of
the "Quad." Twenty-four pages of
the clever work of such well known
"Chaparral" men as H. P. Knight and
B. O. Bliven should make most anyone
anxious to part with the necessary
$2.50 to have a look at the last depart
ment in the book. Every josh has a
good point to it, and no person of pop
ularity and prominence has been over
looked. All of the cartoons which
have appeared in past "Quads," which
more properly belong in the "Chap
arral" have been eliminated and pic
tures, cartoons, poems, and other read
ing matter dealing directly with in
dividuals have been inserted in their
place. Some very surprising snap
shots of many well known people in
unusual poses will be seen on every
page. Bliven and Knight have been
"on the job."
The College Year Department will
have as its strongest feature a series
of remarkable flashlights as taken by
the well known Robinson-Crandall
company. These photographers de
clare that their work appearing in the
1911 annual is the best that they have
done, and that the flashlight of the
Varsity Football rally is the most real
istic action flash that they have seen.
Over a dozen exceptionally clear pic
tures of nocturnal festivities appear
throughout this department, and .ill
of them compare favorably with the
rally view. Several campus dances
are exceptional features. All of these
as well as the excellent athletic snaps
have been reserved exclusively by the
"Quad" and will not be placed on sale
by Robinson-Crandall until after the
book comes out.
