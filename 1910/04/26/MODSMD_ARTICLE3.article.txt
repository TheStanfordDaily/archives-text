# VARSITY TRACK TEAM MAY GO EAST
## Executive Committee To Decide Whether Student Body Finances Will Permit Necessary Subscription.â€”Tag Day Planned. 
### 
Whether or not the Cardinal Var
sity track team will go East to com
pete in the great Western Conference
meet at Champlain, Illinois, on June
4, now rests with the Executive Com
mittee. Such was the announcement
made this afternoon by Graduate
Manager D. W. Burbank, who has
completed his portion of the arrange
ments for the journey. Burbank is as
sured of by far the greater part of
the money necessary to the trip . He
needed an additional sum of $400, and
of this $200 has been given him by the
Executive Committee. If that body
decides that the expenditure of an
other $200 would be justified, the
team will go; but if the committee
can not. grant the further amount,
the entire idea will, in all probability,
be abandoned. Burbank is resolved
not to resort to personal subscrip
tions, which have proved so burden
some and productive of such little
profit in the past.
Unfortunately, the transcontinental
railroads this year have so placed the
dates for the sale of special rate
tickets to Eastern points that it will
lie impossible for the Stanford men
to avail themselves of the reduced
prices. Consequently, several hun
dred dollars more are required than
has previously been the case. Through
his conscientious efforts, however,
Burbank is now practically certain of
$1500. For a meet with the Brigham
Young University at Provo, Utah, he
has been guaranteed $300 with an
option of 60 per cent of the gross re
ceipts. The tremendous crowd which
attended the Provo meet last May
leads Burbank to rely upon securing
a total of at least $500 on the above
basis. By the University of Colorado
the Stanford manager has been guar
anteed $200 for a meet at Boulder,
while the Conference Association will
increase the sum by $.'>oo. The min
strel show neeted $170, and miscel
laneous contributions, exclusive of the
$200 from the Executive Committee,
have amounted to $175.
Should the local committee deem il
wise to give the additional $200, the
necessary grand total will be reached
by means of a general "tag day" on
the campus next Monday, May 2. As
on that date the last Assembly of the
semester will occur and the 1911 an
nual will go on sale, practically the
entire Student Body will be on the
Quad between the hours of 8:15 and
12:30, during which period some two
score of the fairest of Stanford under

graduates will attempt to cajole the
modest sum of twenty-five cents out
of all comers.
Burbank has thought it best to per
fect the plans for tag day even before
the Executive Committee acted, not
because it is at all positive that the
extra $200 will be voted, but because
at least a week is necessary for the
perfection of the details of the scheme
and for enlisting the indispensable
aid of the women. Should the com
mittee decline to make the donation,
the tag day venture will be abandoned,
as it alone could not possibly net a
sum sufficient to meet the needs of
the manager.
To assist him in selecting the many
women who will strike terror in the
hearts and pocket-books of the manly
student on Monday next, and to take
charge of the arrangements in gen
eral, Burbank has appointed a com
mittee of three prominent Senior
women, consisting of Miss A. Wright,
'10, Miss M. H. James, '10, and Miss
M. T. Howell, '10, chairman.
The team that Stanford would be
able to send on the eastern trip, if
sufficient funds can be secured to
make the trip assured, would be al
most twice as strong as that sent last
June to the Conference Meet. Last
year the, Cardinal men lost the meet
only through the breaking down of
Reed before the day of competition.
Had he been able to run, the victory
would undoubtedly have come to Stan
ford. With a team of eight or nine
men this year, and with several men
able to go this year who could not
make the journey last year, the Con
ference meet seems more within the
grasp of the Cardinals than it did at
this time last year. Stanford can
enter men sure of making points in
all but two or three of the events.
These events would presumably be the
weights and the high hurdles. The
loss of Horton, of course, would take
away five points. The team, as the
preliminary trials would perhaps
make up its composition, should be
chosen from the following men, Cole
man and Reed in the two dashes;
Newman in the two-mile; Captain
Scott and Bellah in the pole vault
and broad jump, with Bellah also in
the low hurdles; Wyman in the 440
and relay; Porter or K. F. Lee in the
880 and mile, Poor in the high jump,
Horine not being able to go owing to
the Freshman rule; Stolz in the relay
and broad jump; Newman in the two
mile.

anteed $200 for a meet at Boulder,
while the Conference Association will
increase the sum by $.'>oo. The min
strel show neeted $170, and miscel
laneous contributions, exclusive of the
$200 from the Executive Committee,
have amounted to $175.
Should the local committee deem il
wise to give the additional $200, the
necessary grand total will be reached
by means of a general "tag day" on
the campus next Monday, May 2. As
on that date the last Assembly of the
semester will occur and the 1911 an
nual will go on sale, practically the
entire Student Body will be on the
Quad between the hours of 8:15 and
12:30, during which period some two
score of the fairest of Stanford under

graduates will attempt to cajole the
modest sum of twenty-five cents out
of all comers.
Burbank has thought it best to per
fect the plans for tag day even before
the Executive Committee acted, not
because it is at all positive that the
extra $200 will be voted, but because
at least a week is necessary for the
perfection of the details of the scheme
and for enlisting the indispensable
aid of the women. Should the com
mittee decline to make the donation,
the tag day venture will be abandoned,
as it alone could not possibly net a
sum sufficient to meet the needs of
the manager.
To assist him in selecting the many
women who will strike terror in the
hearts and pocket-books of the manly
student on Monday next, and to take
charge of the arrangements in gen
eral, Burbank has appointed a com
mittee of three prominent Senior
women, consisting of Miss A. Wright,
'10, Miss M. H. James, '10, and Miss
M. T. Howell, '10, chairman.
The team that Stanford would be
able to send on the eastern trip, if
sufficient funds can be secured to
make the trip assured, would be al
most twice as strong as that sent last
June to the Conference Meet. Last
year the, Cardinal men lost the meet
only through the breaking down of
Reed before the day of competition.
Had he been able to run, the victory
would undoubtedly have come to Stan
ford. With a team of eight or nine
men this year, and with several men
able to go this year who could not
make the journey last year, the Con
ference meet seems more within the
grasp of the Cardinals than it did at
this time last year. Stanford can
enter men sure of making points in
all but two or three of the events.
These events would presumably be the
weights and the high hurdles. The
loss of Horton, of course, would take
away five points. The team, as the
preliminary trials would perhaps
make up its composition, should be
chosen from the following men, Cole
man and Reed in the two dashes;
Newman in the two-mile; Captain
Scott and Bellah in the pole vault
and broad jump, with Bellah also in
the low hurdles; Wyman in the 440
and relay; Porter or K. F. Lee in the
880 and mile, Poor in the high jump,
Horine not being able to go owing to
the Freshman rule; Stolz in the relay
and broad jump; Newman in the two
mile.
Whether or not the Cardinal Var
sity track team will go East to com
pete in the great Western Conference
meet at Champlain, Illinois, on June
4, now rests with the Executive Com
mittee. Such was the announcement
made this afternoon by Graduate
Manager D. W. Burbank, who has
completed his portion of the arrange
ments for the journey. Burbank is as
sured of by far the greater part of
the money necessary to the trip . He
needed an additional sum of $400, and
of this $200 has been given him by the
Executive Committee. If that body
decides that the expenditure of an
other $200 would be justified, the
team will go; but if the committee
can not. grant the further amount,
the entire idea will, in all probability,
be abandoned. Burbank is resolved
not to resort to personal subscrip
tions, which have proved so burden
some and productive of such little
profit in the past.
Unfortunately, the transcontinental
railroads this year have so placed the
dates for the sale of special rate
tickets to Eastern points that it will
lie impossible for the Stanford men
to avail themselves of the reduced
prices. Consequently, several hun
dred dollars more are required than
has previously been the case. Through
his conscientious efforts, however,
Burbank is now practically certain of
$1500. For a meet with the Brigham
Young University at Provo, Utah, he
has been guaranteed $300 with an
option of 60 per cent of the gross re
ceipts. The tremendous crowd which
attended the Provo meet last May
leads Burbank to rely upon securing
a total of at least $500 on the above
basis. By the University of Colorado
