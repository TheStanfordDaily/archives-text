We wish to call attention to the
two statements of Professor A. B.
Clark, which appear in another col
umn of this issue. The real gist of
his words will be clear to the careful
reader. The first statement relates
to the gathering of the evidence, the
second to the editorial of the Daily
Palo Alto which referred only to the
inauguration of the investigation. We
do not wish to recommence or even to
recall the past events, but in justice to
ourselves, we feel justified in indicat
ing, as does Mr. Clark, that our asser
tion of April 22, which is quoted by
him, remains uncontradicted.
