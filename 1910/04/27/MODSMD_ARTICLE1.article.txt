# TO GIVE NEW COURSE
## EVERETT W. SMITH, STANFORD, '99, TO TEACH JOURNALISM. Instructor Has Had Wide Experience in Newspaper Work and Will Emphasize Practical Needs. 
### 
Everett W. Smith, now employed in
the Office of Publication of the Forest
Service, will come to Stanford next
year to start a course in journalism.
This course will be the first of its
kind ever to be given here, and if suc
cessful may have important develop
ments in future years.
Mr. Smith is admirably fitted for the
position which he is to fill, having had
a far more comprehensive first hand
knowledge of newspaper work than
falls to the lot of most newspaper
men. On the San Francisco "Chroni
cle" he held at various times the posi
tions of reporter, suburban correspon
dent, exchange editor, Coast editor,
and relief news editor; on th-i New
York "Morning News" he was copy
reader, head of the copy desk and "dog
watch" (the last on duty who takes
charge of emergencies); "lobster
trick" (the man who prepares the
first pasres of the afternoon paper-:),
assistant city editor, and relief make
up on the "Evening News;" and on
the New York "Sun" he was a general
reporter and police headquarters man.
Mr. Smith is an alumnus of Stan
ford, having graduated in the English
department with the class of 1899.
The plan that Mr. Smith suggests is
especially adapted to the elective sys
tem here. Students wishing to take
up newspaper work would register in
their major departments as before,
though English, Economics and His
tory would be preferred, and outside
of the requisites of their departments
would be allowed advisory supervis
ion by the instructor in journalism in
the remaining courses taken.
The special courses to be taken in
the English department would be, first,
a development of composition work to
meet the needs of present day journal
ism, and, second, a study of the better
class of newspapers. The composi
tion courses would be designed pri
marily to train the student to write
under the conditions he must meet and
to do the kind of writing he must use
in actual practice. This would include
drill in writing with a time and space
limit, abstracting and condensing, and
later editing "copy" and preparing it
for Hie printer.
The study of newspapers would take
up an explanation of the mechanical
department, in so far as it affects the
news writing, and an explanation of
the work of (he various news men on
the staff. Authorative talks on specific
topics by outside newspaper men are a
part of the plan.
The inauguration of a course in jour
nalism here is in line with the installa
tion of schools of journalism in various
other universities, notable among
which are the University .of Missouri
and Columbia University.
