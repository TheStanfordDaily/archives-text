# SOPHOMORES PLAN JOLLY-UP.
## Men and Women of 1912 Will Hold Big Informal Affair in Armory Hall on May 7. 
### 
The men and women of the Sopho
more class will hold a jolly-up in
Armory Hall, Palo Alto, on Saturday
evening, May 7. The affair will be in
the nature of a very informal dance.
Old clothes and shirt-waists will be in
order.
This will be the first affair of its
kind that the Sophomores have given,
and it is hoped that all the members
of the class will attend and make the
evening a success. It is hoped by this
means to create a stronger class
spirit by making the Sophomores
better known to each other.
7:30 is the time set for the com
mencement of the festivities. "Queen
ing" is strictly tabooed. A pro-rata
assessment will be levied on all who
attend, and special cars will be on
hand to bring the participants back to
the campus.
