# Maud Allen Visiting On Campus.
## 
### 
Miss Maud Allen, the handsome and
charming danseuse, who by her sinu
ous graces, has captivated the entire
civilized world, will be on the campus
tomorrow visiting friends. Miss Allen
has been playing on the coast, and
will start for the east very shortly.
The talented follower of Terpsichore
may possibly consent to give an ex
hibition of her art to the students, if
she is convinced by the committee ap
pointed that Stanford is an educational
institution of the highest, standing.
Miss Allen appears in a garb as
closely resembling that of the an
cient Greeks as possible, and by the
exquisite rhythm and swing of her
lithe body to the cadence of the music
she endeavors to bring out the hidden
meaning of the classical composers.
