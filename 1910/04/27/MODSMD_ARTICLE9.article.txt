dinal teams for 1911 in track, baseball
and rowing have all been elected dur
ing the past week, and in each in
stance the choice presages success for
Stanford next spring. On the track,
S. H. Bellah fully deserves the honor,
as he is at once a conscientious work
er, capable coach and able athlete. H.
E. Reed's achievements have not been
confined to the diamond. His earnest
efforts on the tracks and football
field, together with his work in the
box during the season just concluded,
combine to make the baseball cap
taincy a fitting recognition of his ath
letic attainments. One of the most
enthusiastic of that handful of men
who kept rowing alive is C.L. Schaupp,

not fail to have a strong and fighting
crew.
