The holding of the Senior Ball in

parture from the usual custom which
has prevailed during the past few
years, when the affair, like all the
other class dances, was held in Encina
Hall. In order to allow more divert
ing and attractive features to be in
troduced than would be possible in
the Club-room, the committee thought
it advisable to discover' some new
scene, fitting the occasion, and finally
concluded that the best available place
was the Hotel Vendome, once before
the scene of a Senior Ball. The man
agement was enthusiastic over the
plan and promised to give the com
mittee every aid possible, especially
in regard to the supper and decora
tions, and consequently an unusual
evening should result.
A large crowd is expected to attend,
as the ball is the final event of Com
mencement Week and will mark the
closing of the history of the Class of
1910.
