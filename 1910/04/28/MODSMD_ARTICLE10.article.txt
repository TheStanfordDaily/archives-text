The "tag day"in aid of the Eastern
trip of the Varsity track team should
be supported by everybody. Such a
plan of raising the necessary funds
has the advantage of laying a small
and almost unnoticeable burden upon
all, while under the system of per
sonal subscription a few persons usu
ally bear the entire brunt. More
money is a necessity. Stanford has
few ways of advertising herself better
than the sending of a team to the an
nual Conference Meet. Anyone who
has attended either of the two meets
at which the Cardinal was represented
will testify to the interest and enthu
siasm created by the appearance of a
team from the widely-known institu
tion of the Pacific Coast. We must be
represented this year. If everyone
buys a tag, we will be.
