### 
Other than voting $200 as additional
expense money to insure the presence
ol" the Stanford representatives at the
Conference meet in Chicago, as re
ported in another column of this
paper, the Executive Committee defi
nitely decided on a schedule of major
and minor sports, definite emblems
were voted to the tennis representa
tives, it was decided to inaugurate the
system of granting uniform medals
as reported in the Daily Palo Alto of
last week, money was voted with
which a relay team will he sent to
represent Stanford at he relay car
nival, and certain amendments to the
constitution were discussed.
At the meeting of the "S" men of
the University at the beginning of the
week it.was definitely decided that
sports at he University should be di
vided into major and minor groups.
Football, track and baseball to form
the major group and tennis the minor.
In accordance with this action the
committee last evening decided to
vote the tennismen who represented
Stanford against California this year,
special sweaters, showing a block "S"
in a circle, and that this would be the
insignia for all minor sports, provid
ing soccer or any others were added
to the list.
At the last meeting of the Committee
the question of awarding uniform
medals in place of sweaers if the win
ner of a sweater so desired, was dis
cussed, and at the meeting last even
ing, the question was again brought
up. It was decided that such a medal
should be struck off, and that a com
mittee of three should be appointed,
one whom is to be an alumnus, to re
port on a suitable design and material.
H. V. Poor, '10, is the only man yet
appointed to serve. This medal can
either be purchased by the recipient
of the letter, if a sweater is preferred,
of if the medal is taken from the com
mittee, a sweater may be purchased.
On next Saturday, the 30th, a relay
carnival will be held on the California
oval under the auspices of that univer
sity Stanford will at that time at
tempt to lower the world's five man re
lay record held by a Stanford team,
and made at California during the
meet of 1909. The Committee voted to
the five men who will represent Stan
ford expenses for the trip. California
and the Olympic Club will both enter
last teams, and it is certain that the
time made will eclipse every other
mark. The men who will represent
Stanford are H. R. Stolz, '10, C. C.
Taylor, '11, W. M. Wyman, '11, T. C.
Coleman, '12, and R. B. Carter, '12.
This is the same team that ran for
Stanford at the recent meet, with the
addition of the speedy Coleman.
The only other business of the meet
ing was an active discussion of the
amendments which are to be voted on
at the Student Body meeting next
Monday.
