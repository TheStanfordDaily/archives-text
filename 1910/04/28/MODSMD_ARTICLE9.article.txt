The Daily Palo Alto announces that,
following a custom in vogue at many
of the leading universities all over
the country, the paper will be turned
over to the Freshmen of the staff for
a single issue. The special number
will appear on the afternoon of Mon
day, May 9, and will be edited by I. J.
Ingraham, whose name now stands at
the head of the list of first-year men
on the staff of the Daily Palo Alto.
