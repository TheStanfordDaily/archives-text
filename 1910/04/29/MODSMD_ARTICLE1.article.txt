# TO DANCE TO-MORROW
## MANY TO ATTEND BOAT CLUB'S BENEFIT INFORMAL. Snappy Music to be Played by Brohaska's Orchestra. â€” Programs May be Obtained Now. 
### 
All is now in readiness for the mon
ster informal dance to be given in
Armory Hall tomorrow night by the
Lagunita Boat Club. This affair is
confidently expected to surpass all
previous dances given by Stanford or
ganizations, including that given by
Maud Allen on the Quad yesterday
morning.
The Boat Club men by their record
this season have shown that they are
determined to keep rowing alive as a
sport at Stanford. Without any finan
cial helps from the Student Body they
held a regatta this spring with the
University of California Rowing Club,
which was by far the most successful
in all ways ever contested by crews
from the two Universities. Such spirit
deserves the support of the students
individually and their attendance to
morrow night in large numbers will
materially help the oarsmen in paying
the expenses of their coming Northern
trip, a fitting reward for their season's
work.
Brohaska of San Jose will be on
hand with an orchestra of six pieces to
take care of the program of music.
All the selections will be of the latest
variety. Sixteen dances and two ex
tras are included on the program.
This number will be increased by sev
eral "off" the list, if time permits.
The programs are a distinct innova
tion from any ever seen here before,
and are embellished by a design drawn
by H. V. Poor, '10, which is emblematic
of rowing. These may be obtained
from any of the following men: J. W.
Roberts, '10, F. L. Guerena, '11, and J.
W. Howell, '12.
Dancers should be on the floor at
8 o'clock. Tickets may still be ob
tained at the Bookstore, and can also
be purchased at the Armory Hall on
Saturday night. Special cars will be
operated to the campus at the conclu
sion of the last dance.
