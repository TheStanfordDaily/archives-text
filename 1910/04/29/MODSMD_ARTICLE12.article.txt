# FULLER MAKES STATEMENT.
## Former Editor-in-Chief Submits Communication re His Suspension from Office. 
### 
To whom it may concern:
Having been deposed from the posi
tion of editor-in-chief of the Daily
Palo Alto on rather short notice, the
writer desires to avail himself of this
opportunity of thanking with the
greatest sincerity the staff of this
paper for their unselfish and untiring
efforts in its aid during the present
semester. The Daily Palo Alto has
never possessed a more able, willing
and spirited corps of men. To them
the paper owes all its success, should
any have been achieved.
Especially does the writer, personal
ly, wish to express the deepest grati
tude to Mr. Harold G. Ferguson, who
will succeed to the editorial chair.
During his term as managing editor
Mr. Ferguson has devoted as much
time, energy and interest to the paper
as has the editor himself, and his
career at the head of the Daily can
not fail to be characterized by un
bounded success. He is a man of
sound and conservative judgment, of
high and healthy ideals. He believes
in freedom of speech and will always
fearlessly adopt that course which he
believes to be right. The writer wishes
him better luck in the expression of
his honest beliefs than has fallen to
the lot of the departing editor.
(Signed) W. P. FULLER, Jr., '10.
