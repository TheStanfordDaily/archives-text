By A. B. Clark, Chairman.

The above statement was issued as
an official announcement this morning
by the Faculty Committee on Student
Affairs, as a result of their recent
deliberations and investigations dur
ing the past week. R. H. Reynolds, '10,
W. P. Fuller, '10, E. L. Wilkeson, '12,
and R. E. Sbarboro, '12, were the four
students subjected to University dis
cipline, in three cases the penalty
amounting to suspension and in the
instance of Fuller, the order to vacate
his position as editor of the Daily Palo
Alto was the punishment meted out to
him. In the three cases of Reynolds,
Fuller and Wilkeson the action by the
Committee was the direct result of the
part that each of the foregoing men
took in the recent disturbance at Lake
Lagunita, when E. M. Leaf, '10, was
thrown into the lake as a punishment
for the part that he took in conducting
an alleged campaign against a certain
faction in college. Fuller's conduct in
editing the Daily Palo Alto upon Fri
day, April 22, was characterized a?
inciting the students to riot and dis
sension, while Reynolds and Wilkeson
were suspended for taking part in the
above administration of punishment.
Sbarboro was asked to leave college
because of the use of offensive lan
guage in a lecture to which men only
were admitted.
As in the case of Horton and Craw
ford, few men have sacrificed them
selves for the name of tSanford more
than have the above named students,
notably W. P. Fuller and R. H. Rey
nolds, who, since their registration
here, have been active in various col
lege activities.
Reynolds, since his registration in
1906, has taken an active part in col
lege athletics, having represented
Stanford both upon various Varsity
crews and upon the football field. He
played on his Freshman football team
and was a strong factor in rowing dur
ing his sojourn at Stanford. Reynolds
captained the 1910 Freshman crew and
rowed upon Varsity eights in his Soph

omore and Junior years rowing as cap
tain in the shell in the Intercollegiate
regatta during his tird year. Reynolds
was also president.of (he BoatClubasa
reward for his active interest in that
particular sport. The Varsity football
fifteen in 1907 included this athlete
while he acted as sub to the fifteen in
190$ and played with his class teams
in his Sophomore and Junior years.
Reynolds was a member of the Exe
cutive Committee during his third year
in college. Phi Delta Phi and the
Quadrangle Club both claim his mem
bership. He belongs to the Zeta Psi
fraternity, registering from Pasadena
111 the Pre-legal department.
Dramatics and journalism have oc
cupied most of Fuller's spare time
and energy. He has appeared in one
or more plays in every year since his
registration in 1906, while his partici
pation in the journalistic world here at
Stanford has gained him two editor
ships, those of the "Sequoia" during
the 1909 and the Daily Palo Alto dur
ing the present semester. Fuller was
also a member of the "Quad" Board
that edited the 1910 "Quad." He claims
membership in the Quadrangle Club,
Press Club, English Club, Phi Delta
Phi and is upon the roll of Sword and
Sandals. The Senior Class has in
trusted him with the honor of com
piling the class history. Fuller's ac
tivity in college has been above the
average; the results that he has se
cured have come from his natural and
genuine ability. Fuller registers as a
Pre-legal major from San Francisco.
He is a member of Sigma Alpha Epsi
lon.
L. E. Wilkeson, '12, has been active
ly interested in baseball in his two
years in college, having made a place
upon his class nine during his Fresh
man and Sophomore years. He is a
member of Zeta Psi and registers in
the Geology and Mining department
from Tacoma, Washington.
R. E. Sbarboro, '12, has also shown
his interest in baseball during his
career as an underclassman at Stan

instance of Fuller, the order to vacate
his position as editor of the Daily Palo
Alto was the punishment meted out to
him. In the three cases of Reynolds,
Fuller and Wilkeson the action by the
Committee was the direct result of the
part that each of the foregoing men
took in the recent disturbance at Lake
Lagunita, when E. M. Leaf, '10, was
thrown into the lake as a punishment
for the part that he took in conducting
an alleged campaign against a certain
faction in college. Fuller's conduct in
editing the Daily Palo Alto upon Fri
day, April 22, was characterized a?
inciting the students to riot and dis
sension, while Reynolds and Wilkeson
were suspended for taking part in the
above administration of punishment.
Sbarboro was asked to leave college
because of the use of offensive lan
guage in a lecture to which men only
were admitted.
As in the case of Horton and Craw
ford, few men have sacrificed them
selves for the name of tSanford more
than have the above named students,
notably W. P. Fuller and R. H. Rey
nolds, who, since their registration
here, have been active in various col
lege activities.
Reynolds, since his registration in
1906, has taken an active part in col
lege athletics, having represented
Stanford both upon various Varsity
crews and upon the football field. He
played on his Freshman football team
and was a strong factor in rowing dur
ing his sojourn at Stanford. Reynolds
captained the 1910 Freshman crew and
rowed upon Varsity eights in his Soph

omore and Junior years rowing as cap
tain in the shell in the Intercollegiate
regatta during his tird year. Reynolds
was also president.of (he BoatClubasa
reward for his active interest in that
particular sport. The Varsity football
fifteen in 1907 included this athlete
while he acted as sub to the fifteen in
190$ and played with his class teams
in his Sophomore and Junior years.
Reynolds was a member of the Exe
cutive Committee during his third year
in college. Phi Delta Phi and the
Quadrangle Club both claim his mem
bership. He belongs to the Zeta Psi
fraternity, registering from Pasadena
111 the Pre-legal department.
Dramatics and journalism have oc
cupied most of Fuller's spare time
and energy. He has appeared in one
or more plays in every year since his
registration in 1906, while his partici
pation in the journalistic world here at
Stanford has gained him two editor
ships, those of the "Sequoia" during
the 1909 and the Daily Palo Alto dur
ing the present semester. Fuller was
also a member of the "Quad" Board
that edited the 1910 "Quad." He claims
membership in the Quadrangle Club,
Press Club, English Club, Phi Delta
Phi and is upon the roll of Sword and
Sandals. The Senior Class has in
trusted him with the honor of com
piling the class history. Fuller's ac
tivity in college has been above the
average; the results that he has se
cured have come from his natural and
genuine ability. Fuller registers as a
Pre-legal major from San Francisco.
He is a member of Sigma Alpha Epsi
