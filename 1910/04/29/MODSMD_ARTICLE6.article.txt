# FIRST QUAD IS SEEN
## 1911 BOOK IS ORIGINAL IN MANY DETAILS OF MAKE-UP. "The Row on the Row" is a Feature of the Josh Department.â€”Monday is Day of Sale. 
### 
Monday morning will see the begin
ning of the sale of what is probably
lhe most finished and elaborate "Quad"
that has ever been published by a
Junior Class since the establishment
of the custom of giving to the third
year students the privileges of col
lecting all Stanford records for the
college year. Every department of
the volume is without an equal in the
foregoing books and in reviewing the
entire work, there is no one depart
ment that can be complimented above
another. Each bears out its general
plan in lending to the excellent char
acter of the "Quad"' by being the very
best of its nature.
New feaures call for admiring at
tention from every page, as the leaves
of the book of heaviest print paper
are turned. Practically every de
partment of the annual has been up
side down in the matter of originality,
and the whole attests the hard work,
both literary and mechanical that the
editors and manager have gone
through to make the 1911 publication
a land-mark in college year-books.
The first copy of the big volume was
brought to the campus by Manager
Christin yesterday afternoon from the
printers, the Crocker Company of San
Francisco, but the contents of the book
as a whole have been kept decidedly
secret. To one, how-ever, who had
the privilege of seeing the advance
copy, several features stood out above
the rest. The cuts are real marvels of
the engraver's art, and are finished in
every possible way. Much of the col
oring in the engravings is especially
good, as is the black and white work
done from oil paintings.
There are splendid articles from the
pens of Mrs. E. W. Allan the Dean of
Women, S. A. Lindauer, '10, on the
University Conference, and E. C. Mat
thias, on the Junior Class History,
and from President Jordan on "Stan
ford in the Twentieth Century."
Here and there throughout the book
are placed tiny illusrations of scenes
around the campus, and no space is
left unutilized by a catchy cut. Each
page in the "Quad" has also a neat
seal in one corner, captioned with the
words "1911 Stanford Quad."
"The Row on the Row," is the usual
take-off upon college life, and will be
found in five pages in the College
Year Department. The article is a
clever production, and has very ap
pealing features in its burlesque
make-up. The sixteen fraternities and
seven sororities come in for their
share of the fun.
The "josh" department has been
seen by no one outside of the magical
editorial circle of the "Quad," but
from various reports that portion of
the book can be looked upon to be
worthy a close examination.
