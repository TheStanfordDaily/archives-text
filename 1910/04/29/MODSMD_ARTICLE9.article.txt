In discussing the suspension of
three students from the University and
the removal of a fourth from his offi
cial position in the Student Body for
alleged breaches of University dis
cipline, we must take into considera
tion not only the present circum
stances but also those that have pre
faced and have surrounded the occa
sion of the suspension. In dealing
with this problem, the Student Affairs
Committee seems to have assumed an
inexcusable and apparently unneces
sary partisan view of the affair re
lating to the suspension of students
for participation in the demonstration
against the present editor-in-chief of
the "Sequoia." The penalty of sus
pension was visited upon two mem
bers of the Student Body who were in
a throng of over two hundred, all bent
upon the same purpose, for their
physical participation in the demon
stration. Yet upon evidence presented
to the committee, they are aware of
the fact that a student has been guilty
of the use of firearms with the
avowed purpose of taking a fellow
student's life. When the committee
puts itself upon record as considering
the immersion of a fellow student, who
is in the eyes of the majority of the
Student Body guilty of an inexcusable
offense, it is certainly within their
duty to view the drawing of loaded
weapons as amenable to the same
punishment at least. The same dis
crimination has been shown with re
spect to Editor Fuller's case, although
the instance is somewhat more funda
mental. An editor has a paper taken
from him, after having brought the
standard of that organ up to the high
est level that it has ever attained in
its long continued existence, for "us
ing the public press to incite personal
violence against a fellow student."
An editor of a University magazine
has commenced and conducted a per
sonal campaign within the Student
Body which has been the fundamental
cause of every outbreak of Student
opinion since the publication of the
first article and has done more to in
jure the spirit that should exist among

the students than any one act in the
history of Sanford for many years past.,
In view of these facts and in the
light in which this matter has come
before the Student Body if the com
mittee sees fit to visit such drastic
punishment upon the students in
volved, they must make the penalty
apply in every case where it is ap
plicable or should have mitigated the
punishment given to those who were
so reprimanded by the authorities.
