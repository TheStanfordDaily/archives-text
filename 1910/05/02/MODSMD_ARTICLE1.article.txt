# MAKES WORLD RECORD
## EX-CAPTAIN SCOTT SMASHES THE POLE VAULT MARK. New Record Set, at 12 Feet 10 3-16 Inches. â€”Bellah in Fine Form. 
### 
Again does a Stanford athlete claim
the honor of holding a world's record.
On Saturday afternoon at Berkeley
Lee Scott, '10, the leader of the Cardi
nal team, cleared the bar in the pole
vault just eleven-sixteenths of an inch
higher than any man had ever before
been able ti negotiate. The new record
which will hereafter be placed after
Scott's name is 12 feet 10 3-1G
inches. Made as it.was in the face of
unfavorable weather conditions it is
a certainty that the record will long
stand unless the Cardinal athlete
should himself break it on his eastern
trip.
Although the two Stanford vaulters,
Scott and Bellah, were invited to par
ticipate in the Berkeley relay carnival
for the express purpose of lowering
the pole-vault, record, in view of stiff
winds blowing, few spectators thought
that either men could do the work.
Scott first cleared the bar at 11 feet 5
inches, raising it gradually to 12 feet
5 inches. After safely negotiating
this height the bar was raised five
notches and the trials for a world's
record began. Two unsuccessful at
tempts were made, on the second Scott
barely grazed the bar as he went over
The third try was the lucky one and
the Stanford leader twisted himself
across with inches to spare. When it
was seen that. Scott had cleared the
bar at the record-breaking height the
new champion was given a tremendous
ovation by the spectators. To insure
the acceptance of the mark as a record,
great care was taken in measuring.
There is no doubt that the Amateur
Athletic Union will officially recognizee
Scott's performance.
What is the most remarkable thing
about the establishment of the new
mark is that it was made under such
adverse weather conditions. During the
entire afternoon a breeze was blowing
down the runway. This greatly re
tarded the speed of the men and had
much to do with Scott's failure to
clear the bar at 13 feet. Walter Dray
of Yale, the former champion, created
his record of 12 feet 9V 2 inches on an
ideal afternoon. There was also con
siderable dispute in regard to the ac
ceptance of Dray's record on account
of the unevenness of the ground from
which the take-off was made. It.was
claimed that this gave the Yale man an
advantage of several inches.
S H. Bellah, '10, captain-elect, also
did some wonderful work, barely graz
ing the bar at the record-breaking
height.
