# SATURDAY'S GAME POSTPONED.
## Vampires and Barbarians Fail to Keep Schedule.â€”Greys and Reds Play Practice Game. 
### 
Much to the disappointment of the
enthusiasts who had gathered in the
bleachers to witness the two Soccer
games scheduled for last Saturday,
neither the Vampires or the Barbar
ians putin an appearance and as a
result the two local teams, the Greys
and the Reds played a practice game.
From first to last it was a fast ex
hibition of the English game and
showed the people who had gathered
there that the two Stanford aggrega
tions were well able to give a cred
itable account of themselves.
The Greys had the superior for
ward line and were able during the
hour of play to annex four goals while
the Reds, although putting up a good
defensive game, were only able to tally
once. Gragg for the Reds and Erb for
the Greys were the two particular
stars of the day.
