# Start a Campus Publication.
## 
### 
The "Dippy Dope" is the name of the
latest campus publication. It is issued
weekly, during the school year, by the
students of the Leland Stanford Jun
ior district school. Eight cents per
month is the cost of a subscription,
and the manager reports that forty
people are now receiving the paper
weekly. The paper is printed by the
latest improved mimeograph system.
The proceeds are turned over to the
treasurer of the Campus Athletic Club
of the school for the exclusive use of
that organization.
