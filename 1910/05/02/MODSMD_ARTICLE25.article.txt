# REPRINT ON SALE MAY 9.
## English Club Signs Contract for Printing New Edition of "First Year at Stanford." 
### 
The English Club's reprint of the
"First Year at Stanford" will be ready
for sale May 9. . Contracts were signed
today with the printers, and the exact
reproduction of the former edition,
with valuable additions will be on sale
at. that date.
Owing to the fact that the issuing of
this volume is not stimulated by any
material motives, the books will be
sold at less than the actual printing
cost, at $l.f>o each. Although this
amount does cover the cost of issuing
the volume, the club is willing to
meet the loss incurred, realizing that
it will be a unique and valuable source
of the early history of the University.
The publishers depend upon the public
to do its share in making the sale of
the reprint a success. As only a very
limited edition will be sold of which
many copies have been already re
served, it will be necessary to act
promptly when the sale is begun, or
send applications to the manager B.
O. Bliven, '11.
By means of a special arrangement
the club is able to make an absolutely
unprecedented offer for the first two
or three days of the sale. During that
time they will sell one copy of the
"First Year at Stanford," and one copy
of the "1909 English Club Year-Book,"
the first of which sells for $1.50, and
the second for $1.00; both for only two
dollars. This offer will be of short
duration, as only a few copies of the
"Year Book" are still at hand.
