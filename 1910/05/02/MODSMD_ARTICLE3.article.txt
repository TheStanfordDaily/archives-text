# TREMENDOUS SUCCESS OF DANCE ASSURES CREW'S TRIP NORTH
## 
### 
Approximately $200 was cleared by
the Boat Club on their benefit dance
last Saturday night. There were at
least 150 couples on the floor thus
making this dance the largest ever
held at Stanford. The expenses have
not been totaled as yet, but it is be
lieved that they will run close to $100.
From a social as well as financial
standpoint, the affair was a great suc
cess. Excellent, music was rendered by
an orchestra of six pieces led by Bro
haska. This was pronounced by all
the most successful benefit dance of
the season.
Final arrangements have been made
for the crew men to sail for Seattle
from San Francisco on May 17, on the
steamer "Queen" of the Pacific Coast
Steampsliip Company. The party will

be made up of twelve or fourteen
men. The run up the coast will take
three days, thus allowing plenty of
time for the crew to row over the
course before the race, which is to be
rowed on May 25.
The Washington Student Body has
guaranteed the Lagunita Club $100,
which sum will defray most of the ex
penses of the trip. In Seattle, the men
will live at the various fraternity
houses. The original proposition
made to the two crews in the Lagu
nita-California race was to allow each
crew $200 to pay their expenses North.
Later this was changed so that the
whole amount should go to the win
ning eight.
The personnel of Ihe local crew will
be announced shortly.
