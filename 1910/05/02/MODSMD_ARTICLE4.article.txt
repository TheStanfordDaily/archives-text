# SEVEN HUNDRED "QUADS" SOLD DURING LESS THAN FIVE HOURS
## 
### 
The largest number of books sold on
the first day of sale and perhaps the
best annual published in many years,
is the record to which the 1911 Junior
Class can point after today's issuing
of the Quad. Over 700 copies dis
posed of in less than five hours, with
receipts to Manager Christin amount
ing to over one thousand dollars, are
the principal facts telling of the un
usual rapidity with which the big an
nual went to eager buyers. About
five hundred books were taken by per
sons outside of the Junior Class, while
100 were given to advertisers by the
management. This makes up the total
of 900 that were printed. At two
o'clock this . afternoon there were
about eighty copies available for the
public at large, and it was estimated

that this number would be reduced to
a very small margin, if not entirely
gone by this evening, since the sale
went on during the whole afternoon.
So it is very likely that the first edi
tion of the 1911 "Qual" will be at a
premium very quickly and in the
hands only of individual owners. The
few remaining copies, if any do re
main, will be on sale tomorrow at 9:15
at the same place on the Quadrangle,
for a short time.
Other class annuals at this stage of
their sale were never as near to being
sold out, and this is shown by the fact
that the edition each year was no
more than 800, and yet the other
classes were forced to get rid of their
extra copies by different means for
months afterwards.
