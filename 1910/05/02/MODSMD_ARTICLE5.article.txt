# OVER ONE THOUSAND TAGS SOLD ON THE QUAD THIS MORNING
## 
### 
Although the exact amount realized
is not as yet known, the results of the
tag sale this morning far surpassed all
expectations. One thousand tags
were printed and long before the
morning was over, they were all dis
posed of.
A thousand tags had been thought
sufficient to fill every possible want,
but finding the demand greater than
the supply, the women in charge con
ceived the novel idea of pinning small
pieces of paper on the contributors.
The plan worked very well and several

dollars were collected in this way. It
is safe to say that two hundred and
fifty dollars was taken in, but how
much more will not be known until
the money has been counted.
Graduate Manager Burbank wishes
to take this opportunity to thank the
women through whose efforts such a
large amount, was collected, and espec
ially to thank the committee composed
of Miss M. T. Howell, '10, Miss A.
Wright, '10, and Miss M. H. James, '10,
who had charge of the collection dur
ing the day.
