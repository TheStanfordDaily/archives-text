# CHANGE DATE OF PLAY
## SENIOR CLASS WILL PRODUCE "COUSIN KATE" MAY 18. New Date Insures Larger Audience. Strong Will be Clergyman. Tickets on May 11. 
### 
From May 19, as previously an
nounced, the date of the Senior play,
"Cousin Kate," has been changed to
Wednesday evening, May 18. This will
cause the production to be staged on
the evening of the last day of final ex
aminations, instead of on the evening
following, and consequently it is ex
pected that a far larger number of
college people will still be on the
campus than would have been the
case, had the original date been ad
hered to. The piece is now well re
hearsed, and the cast will have no diffi
culty whatsoever in being completely
prepared for its presentation at the
appointed time, despite the intervening
week of examinations.
M. W. Strong, '11, has been selected
to play the role of the Rev. James
Bartlett. The part had originally been
given to a Senior, as the committee had
resolved to give distinct preference to
fourth-year people in choosing the
cast. The change was found neces
sary, however, and Strong was at. once
requested to take the part. The Com
mittee on Student Affairs generously
gave their permission, which was a
prequisite inasmuch as Strong ap
peared in"The Man From Home." As
the time was short, the role difficult,
and Strong one of the very few persons
suited to undertake the task, the com
mittee quickly acted favorably upon
the Seniors' petition. In"The Man
From Home" Strong played the part
of the young American, Horace Grang
er-Simpson, a rather unpleasant juve
nile role. As the Rev. James Bartlett,
the clergyman of a country parish, he
will be far better cast.
Pictures of scenes of the play were
taken by Frank Davey, of Palo Alto,
last Saturday morning and will be
placed on the Quad probably next
Thursday. An article telling of the
many interesting points of the piece
and ilustrated with several of the best
photographs will appear in the May
"Sequoia."
As usual, George E. Lyon, of San
Francisco, has been engaged to paint
the scenery for the production, all of
which will be ready for rehearsal at
least one week preceding the date set
for the play.
Tickets will go on sale on Wednes
day, May 11, and the customary prices
will prevail.
