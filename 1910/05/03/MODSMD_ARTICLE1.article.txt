# MAY GO TO CARNIVAL
## COMBINED MUSICAL CLUBS TO GIVE SAN JOSE CONCERT. Rose Week Festivities Are Planned to Include a Stanford Day on May 12. 
### 
The Glee and Mandolin Clubs last
night discussed together the possibility
of their going as the Combined Musical
Clubs of Stanford University to the
Annual Rose Carnival at San .Tose for
the purpose of giving a concert on the
night of Thursday, May 12. That date
has been set aside by the committee in
charge of the Carnival as Stanford
Day, and the Clubs, through President
Jordan, were invited to fill in the
evening by a concert to be given in
one of the local theatres. This con
cert is to consist partly of a vaudeville
program to begin at 8 o'clock in the
evening. Inasmuch, however, as the
Rose Carnival and especially Stanford
Day, conflicts with the first week of
final examinations for the semester,
which begin on May 12, it was a very
doubtful question as to whether the
Clubs could give the concert and at
the same time do justice to their ex
aminations. The Glee Club has al
ready voted to go as a body, the mem
bers either not having any very diffi
cult work in preparation for examina
tions, or feeling that they could afford
to do the extra work required to make
the trip. Less than half, however, of
the Mandolin Club are able to spare
the entire evening necessary for the
concert at this extremely critical point
in their college work. To make the
concert a success, a certain amount of
hard rehearsing would be imperative
and the actual time needed for going
to San .Tose and back would call for a
very great sacrifice on the part of the
members of the Combined Clubs in
connection with the taking of ex
aminations.
Should the Clubs go as a Combined
body, this would be the first out-of
town trip that they have taken for two
years, the last trip being to Vancouver
at Christmas, 1907. The Clubs were
offered the unusual opportunity for a
concert tour to Chicago last spring by
the Santa Fe Railroad, but they were
nuable to secure the consent of the
Faculty Committee for making the trip.
The two organizations, Glee and Man
dolin, have been working unusually
hard and faithfully this year, having
given the 1909 Football Show, and the
1910 Minstrel Show. Roth Clubs and
especially the Mandolin Club, have
also appeared innumerable times at
entertainments given to visitors on the
campus. They have never as a body,
however, taken an out-of-town journey.
It is unfortunate that this trip should
have come at the examination season.
The officers of the Combined Clubs
for 1910-11 were elected last night in
the chapel. A. E. Ehrhorn, '10, of San
Francisco, was made president; for
vice-president .T. C. Thomas, '12, of Las
Vegas, New Mexico, was chosen.
