# CLASS MAKES CHANGE
## REARRANGE OF EVENTS OF COMMENCEMENT WEEK. Under New Schedule Ball Will be Final Festivity, Commencement Occurring Monday Morning. 
### 
A distinct rearrangement of many of
the usual events of Commencement
Week is evident in the program of fes-,
tivities compiled and just issued by the j
Senior Week Committee. Profiting by j
the experience of former years, the
Seniors have adopted several new
plans, each of which will correct to a
large extent any previous mistakes in
the schedule of Commencement cere
monies.
The most important change is that
relating 1o the date of Commencement
itself. Heretofore, the giving of
degrees had been the final event, fol
lowing the Prom, Ball and all the
other festivities. This year, however,
the I Jail will be the closing occasion,
coming on Tuesday evening, while
Commencement will occur on Monday
morning, two clays earlier than pre
viously. In order to allow the various
professors and instructors ample time
in which to correct examination papers
and prepare their reports for the
Registrar so that he may have the
data necessary to (he granting or re
fusal of degrees, the Academic Coun
cil consented to have final examina
tions begin and finish one day earlier
than has before been customary, and
the schedule of examinations, as an
nounced, includes this change.
Acting in accordance with the re
arrangement, the Senior Play com
mittee lias decided to present "Cousin
Kate" on May 18 instead of on May 19,
which in passed Commencement
Weeks would have been the regular
date.

A distinct rearrangement of many of
the usual events of Commencement
Week is evident in the program of fes-,
tivities compiled and just issued by the j
Senior Week Committee. Profiting by j
the experience of former years, the
Seniors have adopted several new
plans, each of which will correct to a
large extent any previous mistakes in
the schedule of Commencement cere
monies.
The most important change is that
relating 1o the date of Commencement
itself. Heretofore, the giving of
degrees had been the final event, fol
lowing the Prom, Ball and all the
other festivities. This year, however,
the I Jail will be the closing occasion,
coming on Tuesday evening, while
Commencement will occur on Monday
morning, two clays earlier than pre
viously. In order to allow the various
professors and instructors ample time
in which to correct examination papers
and prepare their reports for the
Registrar so that he may have the
data necessary to (he granting or re
fusal of degrees, the Academic Coun
cil consented to have final examina
tions begin and finish one day earlier
than has before been customary, and
the schedule of examinations, as an
nounced, includes this change.
Acting in accordance with the re
arrangement, the Senior Play com
mittee lias decided to present "Cousin
Kate" on May 18 instead of on May 19,
which in passed Commencement
Weeks would have been the regular
date.
Several other changes of varying
importance will be noted in the com
plete schedule as printed below:
