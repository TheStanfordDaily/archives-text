# READER TO ENTERTAIN
## CAP AND GOWN PRESENT WELL KNOWN IMPERSONATOR. Miss Lucine Finch to Give Readings at Stanford on Evening of May 6. 
### 
It is pretty well known about the
campus that Miss Lucine Finch will
give an entertainment in Assembly
Hall on next Friday evening, May 6,
but many people are asking just what
they will hear there that night. The
performance is under the auspices of
Cap and Gown, which organization as
sures the public that they will not be
disappointed in the reader. She gives
Southern impersonations—tells stories
and sings unpublished songs' —in such
a way that she charms her audiences.
She is a woman of wide experience,
having been in legitimate drama as
well as in impersonations.
Mrs. Allan, Dean of Women, has re
ceived many clippings about Miss
Finch's work, and also a copy of the
January number of the Burr Macin
tosh. which explains her methods and
work. She is the reincarnation of the
old negro mammy, and through her,
the embodiment of the imagination and
superstition of the mysterious African
race. Her interpretations of mammy's
Bible stories, and of songs heard first
from her and afterwards supplement
ed by stories, learned wherever she
could wheedle herself into the con
fidence of negroes, at camp meetings,
weddings, fetes, revivals or any other
gatherings 1 avi, lelighted audiences
all over the country. Her scenes are
lighted only M'ith candles, and her
acting has been called marvellous.
The seats are being sold at the usual
places for popular prices, and the
proceeds will go to swell the fund for
the Women's Club-house.
