# Submit Schedule for All-Star Team
## Itinerary for Greatest Trip Ever Taken by College Athletic Aggregation Is Announced by Those In Charge.--Will Travel 15,000 Miles In Trip This Summer. 
### 
Twenty-four men, chosen from the
universities of Stanford, California,
and Nevada, and known as the All-
American College Rugby team, will
invade Australia and New Zealand this
summer, on a 15,000 mile trip, perhaps
the longest journey that an American
college athletic team has ever taken.
The invitation to bring a powerful
rugby fifteen of college men to the
Antipodes was sent to America by the
followers of the sport there, and after
much discussion, it was determined
among the Stanford, California and
Nevada coaches to organize a team to
be sent to the far-away islands. To
take these twenty-four men on the
long trip, D. W. Burbank, '09, the Car
dinal Graduate Manager, and J. C.
Schael'fer, U. C., '07, the California
Coach last fall, were chosen. Burbank
will manage the trip, and Schaffer is
to act as Coach. The twenty-four men
who will compose the Ail-American
Team have not been selected absolute
ly. The work of choosing has gone on
for some two weeks, and has been
handicapped by the necessity of know
ing whether the players chosen were
able to go or not. Approximately,
twenty of the quad have been notified
of their selection and have accepted
the offer to cross the Pacific. Cali
fornia men have been taken already
to the number of ten, with two more to
be named. Stanford has eight men in
the list, with two more to be chosen.
Nevada has two players from the
scrum. The necessity of holding the
list of the squad until the names were
completed has compelled the holding
back of the definite announcement of
the rugby team. The whole list of

twenty-four will, however, be publish
ed tomorrow or Friday in the Daily
Palo Alto. As far as possible, the
players chosen have been men who
have more than a year to take part
in rugby work in their respective uni
versities, at the same time making the
team as strong a one as possible.
The Australian authorities have for
warded the schedule of games to be
played. It is a hard one, including as
it does twelve struggles, all equal in
tension and nervous strain to the an
nual big match between Stanford and
California. These twelve contests be
gin 011 June 11 and end at Auckland,
New Zealand on July 30, a period of
six weeks. This means, on the aver
age, a very hard program of two games
per week, an unusual one for col
lege men. The full schedule is printed
below. The contests are set for six
different cities, Brisbane, and Sydney,
Australia, and Wellington, Christ
church, Dunedin, and Aukland, New
Zeland.
The teams to be played will include
probably the famous Wallabies, who
toured the world last year, and met
Stanford and California in the fall of
1908; the fast All-blacks, one of the
best known fifteens in Australia; and
the native team of the Maoris, of New
Zealand. This team, according to ex
pert. opinion, is reputed to be the
fastest rugby team in the world for the
first half of a contest. Other organi
zations will undoubtedly face the col
lege men, and these will include prac
tically all the club teams of Austra
lia.
The college team is to have rugby
suits of a very representative kind.

They are to be composed of navy blue

should make a very neat appearance.
These suits will be furnished by the
San Francisco branch of A. G. Spauld

unusual opportunity to see the very
best rugby performers the world has

gles against these star performers
should raise the standard of the rugby
played on the Coast and in America
to an extremely high level. Tt is an
excellent chance for all three universi

from the Australian experts. Both
Stanford and California have sent

They are to be composed of navy blue

should make a very neat appearance.
These suits will be furnished by the
San Francisco branch of A. G. Spauld

be taken for them before May 7, and a
picture of the whole team as it will
go on the 113,000 mile trip, is to be

Manager Burbank ,for the team, has
secured reservations on the Southern
Pacific Shasta Limited train, leaving
San Francisco on May 17, at 11:20 a.m.
The steamer "Makura," sailing from
Vancouver, on May 20, will take them
on the long journey across the water
to the Antipodes. All expenses of the
men for hotel and travel will be paid
for the trip.
The team will be away from the
United States about thirteen weeks,
all returning in time for the opening
of the three universities about Septem
ber 1. The experience gained by this
unusual opportunity to see the very
best rugby performers the world has
to offer and to take pan in Llit smug
gles against these star performers
should raise the standard of the rugby
played on the Coast and in America
to an extremely high level. Tt is an
excellent chance for all three universi
ties to profit by this trip, sending men
as they do to draw new knowledge
from the Australian experts. Both
Stanford and California have sent
to the Antipodes, Coach Presley in the
summer of 1907, and Coach Schaeffer
of California in the summer of 1909.
Twenty-four men, chosen from the
universities of Stanford, California,
and Nevada, and known as the All-
American College Rugby team, will
invade Australia and New Zealand this
summer, on a 15,000 mile trip, perhaps
the longest journey that an American
college athletic team has ever taken.
The invitation to bring a powerful
rugby fifteen of college men to the
Antipodes was sent to America by the
followers of the sport there, and after
much discussion, it was determined
among the Stanford, California and
Nevada coaches to organize a team to
be sent to the far-away islands. To
take these twenty-four men on the
long trip, D. W. Burbank, '09, the Car
dinal Graduate Manager, and J. C.
Schael'fer, U. C., '07, the California
Coach last fall, were chosen. Burbank
will manage the trip, and Schaffer is
to act as Coach. The twenty-four men
who will compose the Ail-American
Team have not been selected absolute
ly. The work of choosing has gone on
for some two weeks, and has been
handicapped by the necessity of know
ing whether the players chosen were
able to go or not. Approximately,
twenty of the quad have been notified
of their selection and have accepted
the offer to cross the Pacific. Cali
fornia men have been taken already
to the number of ten, with two more to
be named. Stanford has eight men in
the list, with two more to be chosen.
Nevada has two players from the
scrum. The necessity of holding the
list of the squad until the names were
completed has compelled the holding
back of the definite announcement of
the rugby team. The whole list of

twenty-four will, however, be publish
ed tomorrow or Friday in the Daily
Palo Alto. As far as possible, the
players chosen have been men who
have more than a year to take part
in rugby work in their respective uni
versities, at the same time making the
team as strong a one as possible.
The Australian authorities have for
warded the schedule of games to be
played. It is a hard one, including as
it does twelve struggles, all equal in
tension and nervous strain to the an
nual big match between Stanford and
California. These twelve contests be
gin 011 June 11 and end at Auckland,
New Zealand on July 30, a period of
six weeks. This means, on the aver
age, a very hard program of two games
per week, an unusual one for col
lege men. The full schedule is printed
below. The contests are set for six
different cities, Brisbane, and Sydney,
Australia, and Wellington, Christ
church, Dunedin, and Aukland, New
Zeland.
The teams to be played will include
probably the famous Wallabies, who
toured the world last year, and met
Stanford and California in the fall of
1908; the fast All-blacks, one of the
best known fifteens in Australia; and
the native team of the Maoris, of New
Zealand. This team, according to ex
pert. opinion, is reputed to be the
fastest rugby team in the world for the
first half of a contest. Other organi
