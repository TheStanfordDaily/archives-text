### 
The Class of 1910, always famed for
its agressiveness and inventive genius,
has again astonished the college world
by branching out into fields hitherto
unknown to class organizations at
Stanford. The Seniors have gone into
the real estate business. For several
months the Class was involved in the
knotty legal problem as to whether it
possessed the necessary power to law
fully engage in the handling of prop
erty. The attention of the many learn
ed barristers of 1910 now at the mercy
of Professors Hohfeld, Bingham and
Huston, was attracted, and after ser
ious and weighty deliberation an af
firmative decision was reached. The
initial step in this novel direction was
the leasing of the rare old homestead
belonging to Book Dispenser Hyde.
The pretentious mansion stands upon
a lot adjoining the wooden studio and
the Campus cyclery and is vulgarly,
though popularly, denominated as the
"old bookstore." It is being used by
the Seniors for rehearsals of "Cousin
Kate" which will be produced in the
Assembly Hall on May 18 as the first
event of Commencement Week.
