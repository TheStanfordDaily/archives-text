# "Quads" on Sale at Bookstore.
## 
### 
Manager C. A. Christin of the 1911
"Quad" announced this afternoon that
the sale of the annual will be discon
tinued on the Quadrangle and that
those still desiring copies may pro
cure them at the Stanford Bookstore
on the campus or at Hyde's Bookstore
in Palo Alto. As only sixty copies re
main unsold, the entire issue will un
doubtedly be exhausted by the close of
the semester. If some copies remain
unsold at that time, it will not be
necessary for Christin to reduce the
price of his books next year, owing to
the exceptionally large sale upon the
Quadrangle during the first sale.
