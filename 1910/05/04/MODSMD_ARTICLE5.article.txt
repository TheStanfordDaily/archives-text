# GIVES TALK ON WAR
## PRESIDENT JORDAN DELIVERS FAMOUS ADDRESS. "War and Manhood" is Topic Chosen by Speaker for Lecture in Regular Assembly. 
### 
"The Human Harvest," or "Man
hood and War," the famous and most
talked of addresses ever written by
President Jordan, was heard this
morning at Assembly hall by the stu
dents of the University, and a large
number of interested people from Palo
Alto and the peninsular cities. Dr.
Jordan was introduced by Professor
B. E. Howard, Chairman of the Fac
ulty Entertainment Committee.
In the course of this lecture, Dr.
Jordan exemplified by his statements
on France that he has not changed his
attitude in regard to the effect
upon the French race. Last spring, it
will be remembered, he created much
discussion throughout the United
States because of this attitude on the
instance of this same topic at Bryn
Mawr college, where he was making
the graduation speech.
President Jordan said in bringing
the subject before the auditors, that
one of the great fallacies of history
is that the modern historian relates
only what has been done, but fails to
1 T
tell what the unborn might do. Be
lieving that the unborn are potent fac
ors which might have and might not
have been vital things. Dr. Jordan told
how the human race could be insured
a mighty factor If we merely resorted
to the theory of the modern plant, and
stock raiser. Continuing on this phase
of his topic, he said we thus could
easily breed a race of tall, red haired
men, or hairless men, simply by elim
inating the others. Dr. Jordan said
we could have an excellent race of
manhood, and that in the long run, the
decadence of any nation is due to the
decadence of its people.
In illustrating this point, President
Jordan gave a short resume of the his
tory of various countries from this
viewpoint, and here brought out the
veritable point of the address, namely,
that war is detrimental to the pros
perity of nations, not because of is
devastating tendencies, but because it
eliminates the best blood of the na
tions. He claimed that the fall of
Rome was due to the lack of good men.
and that her loss of such beings was
due to the fighting of her people. Dr.
Jordan, spoke of Greece in the same
manner. There are still Greeks, de
clared the speaker, but not the old,
grand Greek. They were killed off,
time and time again, and it does not
take long to kill off a good breed of
men. By this same argument, Dr.
Jordan, took up the other countries of
Europe, laying big emphasis upon the
situation in France due to great wars
that country once took part in.
"it is not the economic loss, the sor
row of war that is so vital, it is the
loss of the men that would have made
fathers. They are generally the better
class."
