International Rugby is finally a
reality for college teams upon the
Pacific Coast as well as for the cham
pion fifteens from the Antipodes. The
departure of the twenty-four college
athletes next June will mark the be
ginning of what promises to be a series
of such contests and it is very fortu
nate that such relations should exist.
Not only will the colleges directly con
cerned profit by the coming journey,
but even the Pacific Coast will mater
ially gain its share of the benefit.
Stanford is very fortunate in its repre
sentation upon the team that is to be
sent and her advantage will be fully
realized next November when the ex
perience of the Cardinal members of
the All-Star Rugby Team will add
strength to the 1911 Varsity fifteen.
We wish to congratulate those who
have made such a trip possible and
also to look forward to a continuation
of such schedules in the future.
