# NEW COMMITTEE MET
## MEMBERS-ELECT ATTEND FIRST EXECUTIVE MEETING. Committee Votes on Emblems.—Resolution Passed in Regard to Programs.—Sweaters Called In. 
### 
Last evening, at the regular meeting
of tlie Executive Committee the newly
elected members met for the first time
with the outgoing Committee in order
to become acquainted with the method
of doing business, and the general
course of procedure. A committee was
appointed to look into the matter of
compiling a book containing certain
information about the Student Body;
the sizes of letters to be used as em
blems was also discussed and desig
nated; and a resolution was passed in
regard to the selling of printed pro
grams, such as have been used in the
past, at games and meets, held at Stan
ford.
The new members of the Committee
who took their places with the old
Committee for the first time last even
ing, were: M. Y. Malone, '10, W. M.
Wyman, '11, H.H Smitherum, '11, J. E.
Thompson, '11, J. L. Arrell, '12, and E.
P. Kern, '13. G. A. Ditz, the president
elect, is a member of this year's Com
mittee, representing the Class of 1911.
As It Is customary, for the Student
Body to publish a small pamphlet con
taining the constitution, and by-laws,
governing the Student Body, and also
the Intercollegiate agreement, it is
necessary to also change the handbuok
whenever any of these provisions are
changed. Because such changes have
taken place, a committee of three was
appointed last evening to look into,
and have printed a new handbook, con
taining all necessary material in re
gard to student government at Stan
ford and relations with the Univer
sity of California. This book will be
printed as soon as the work of com
piling is completed, and it does not
seem improbable that the book will be
finished before the close of the sem
ester.
When the sweaters recently ordered
by Graduate Manager Burbank for
men having won them in this spring's
sports arrived, it was found that they
were not uniform, either as to mater
ial or size of letter. The letters were
nearly the same size but there was a
noticeable difference, in the Varsity
sweaters, which are supposed to be
absolutely uniform. Because of this
fact the Committee decided that in the
future block "S's" should be of three
and only three sizes, in order to in
sure absolute uniformity in every kind
of sweater. The letters, according to
the ruling of the Committee, shall
either be nine, six or three, inches in
height, the size to be chosen by the
man winning the letter. As the letters
obtained a few days ago by Burbank,
did not come up to the requirements
made with the firm manufacturing
them, nor were they uniform in size of
letter, Manager Burbank was request
ed by the Committee to call in all
sweaters, distributed so far, return
them to the manufacturers, and see
that when they are returned they are
all of a uniform quality. Burbank has
called in the sweaters.
Because of the fact that so many
hawkers, and fakirs, take to selling
programs at the Intercollegiate games
and track meets, the Committee passed
a resolution, recommending to the next
Committee and all Committees that
follow them, that the privilege to sell
programs at athletic contests be denied
to all applicants for the concession,
and that cheap printed programs, giv
ing all the necessary information he
distirbuted at the contests held at
Stanford in the future. As the big
game and the track meet will both be
held at California next year, there will
be no chance to act on this resolution
until the fall of 1911.

Committee and all Committees that
follow them, that the privilege to sell
programs at athletic contests be denied
to all applicants for the concession,
and that cheap printed programs, giv
ing all the necessary information he
distirbuted at the contests held at
Stanford in the future. As the big
game and the track meet will both be
held at California next year, there will
be no chance to act on this resolution
until the fall of 1911.
Last evening, at the regular meeting
of tlie Executive Committee the newly
elected members met for the first time
with the outgoing Committee in order
to become acquainted with the method
of doing business, and the general
course of procedure. A committee was
appointed to look into the matter of
compiling a book containing certain
information about the Student Body;
the sizes of letters to be used as em
blems was also discussed and desig
nated; and a resolution was passed in
regard to the selling of printed pro
grams, such as have been used in the
past, at games and meets, held at Stan
ford.
The new members of the Committee
who took their places with the old
Committee for the first time last even
ing, were: M. Y. Malone, '10, W. M.
Wyman, '11, H.H Smitherum, '11, J. E.
Thompson, '11, J. L. Arrell, '12, and E.
P. Kern, '13. G. A. Ditz, the president
elect, is a member of this year's Com
mittee, representing the Class of 1911.
As It Is customary, for the Student
Body to publish a small pamphlet con
taining the constitution, and by-laws,
governing the Student Body, and also
the Intercollegiate agreement, it is
necessary to also change the handbuok
whenever any of these provisions are
changed. Because such changes have
taken place, a committee of three was
appointed last evening to look into,
and have printed a new handbook, con
taining all necessary material in re
gard to student government at Stan
ford and relations with the Univer
sity of California. This book will be
printed as soon as the work of com
piling is completed, and it does not
seem improbable that the book will be
finished before the close of the sem
ester.
When the sweaters recently ordered
by Graduate Manager Burbank for
men having won them in this spring's
sports arrived, it was found that they
were not uniform, either as to mater
ial or size of letter. The letters were
nearly the same size but there was a
noticeable difference, in the Varsity
sweaters, which are supposed to be
absolutely uniform. Because of this
fact the Committee decided that in the
future block "S's" should be of three
and only three sizes, in order to in
sure absolute uniformity in every kind
of sweater. The letters, according to
the ruling of the Committee, shall
either be nine, six or three, inches in
height, the size to be chosen by the
man winning the letter. As the letters
obtained a few days ago by Burbank,
did not come up to the requirements
made with the firm manufacturing
them, nor were they uniform in size of
letter, Manager Burbank was request
ed by the Committee to call in all
sweaters, distributed so far, return
them to the manufacturers, and see
that when they are returned they are
all of a uniform quality. Burbank has
called in the sweaters.
Because of the fact that so many
hawkers, and fakirs, take to selling
programs at the Intercollegiate games
and track meets, the Committee passed
a resolution, recommending to the next
Committee and all Committees that
follow them, that the privilege to sell
programs at athletic contests be denied
to all applicants for the concession,
and that cheap printed programs, giv
ing all the necessary information he
distirbuted at the contests held at
Stanford in the future. As the big
