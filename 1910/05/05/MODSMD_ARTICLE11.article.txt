The women of the University are
making a noble effort to erect a club
house. Their efforts have not only
been constant and persistent, but suc
cessful to a great extent. In further
ing this cause Cap and Gown tomor
row evening presents Miss Lucine
Finch, the well known Southern im
personator at Assembly Hall. The
receipts of this entertainment will be
added to the Women's Clubhouse fund.
To show the extent the Student Body
appreciates the ambitions of the wo
men, and to exemplify a spirit equal
to that the women did on the late Tag
Day, the members of the Student Body
should attend this unusually good pro
duction. Cooperation is wise in this
age. Let us all work together and all
our plans for the future Stanford will
be accomplished.
