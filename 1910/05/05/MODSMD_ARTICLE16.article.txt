# PLAYERS ARE OBSTINATE.
## Leading Lady Refuses to Lose Jewels and Press Agent Finds Himself Hard Put for Copy. 
### 
As the leading lady of the cast of
"Cousin Kate" has not lost any jewels
and as none of the other players of
the piece have become entangled in
any of the sundry matrimonial diffi
culties so peculiarly attendant upon
the marital existence of actors and
actresses, it is only with the greatest
difficulty that Press Agent B. F. Bickel
is enabled to compile suitable adver
tising stories for the numberless pub
lications constantly clamoring for
copy. It is not even claimed that the
production will entail "gorgeous cos
tumes," "a chorus of wondrous beauty,"
"unequalled electrical effects," "sumpt
uously expensive scenery," or any of
the other thousand and one superlative
attirbutes so prized by the local writ
ers. But notwithstanding, a long line
is expected at the Bookstore and the
Stanford Pharmacy on next Wednes
day morning when the tickets are
scheduled to go on sale.
