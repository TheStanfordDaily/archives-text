# 10 NEOPHYTES AMUSE
## SKULL AND SNAKES INITIATES PROMINENT MEN. Entertainment Given Students Along Quad and on Postoffice Steps. Many Good Turns. 
### 
On the Quad this morning, twelve
lusty neophytes of Skull and Snakes,
performed various and sundry stunts,
of a more or less humorous character,
for the edification of the assembled
audiences. The scenes enacted by the
men varied from crew races in which
a full eight dragged themselves, de
jectedly around, to marble races in
which the probosces of the initiates
gave the propelling force by which the
little spheres were rolled, and prize
fights on the steps of the Postoffice.
The men who took part in initiation
were R. F. McFadden, '10, M. Y. Ma
lone, '10, G. A. Ditz, '11, H. G. Fergu
son, '11, B. L. Ball, '11, R. B. Carter,
'12, T. M. Sanborn, '12, C. L. Schaupp,
'12, and M. Obear, '12.
On the Postoffice steps, Ball, with
his clothes reversed, acted as an
nouncer, and explained in vivid
speeches the acts that were to follow.
Ditz, the first speaker, as president
elect of the Student Body, outlined his
policies, in a more or loss frenzied
speech. Carter and McFadden fc 1-
lowed with a sketch, full of o.uestion
able hits and rough humor. Then oc
cured a prize fight in which Malone
and Schaupp, depicting Jeffries and
Johnson, fought a frenzied and fast
bout of one and a half ten second
rounds, at the end of which Jeffries
landed a left on the j.w that male it
necessary to wet down the big smoke
with some refreshing water from a
sprinkling can. During this Obear
and Ferguson acted as seconds, while
Carter and McFadden acted as stools
for the two contestants. The last
number in the program was a quartet
composed of Ferguson, Sanborn, Cole
man, and Obear, who rendered topical
songs in a truly pathetic manner.
The secret initiation will take place
this evening.
