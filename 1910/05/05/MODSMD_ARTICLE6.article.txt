# WILL NOT ENTER CREW.
## Lagunita Club Takes Unfavorable Action on Invitation to Row in San Francisco. 
### 
The Lagunita Boat Club has decided
not to enter a crew in the regatta
planned for next Sunday on San Fran
cisco Bay by the Pacific Association of
Amateur Oarsmen. This action was
thought advisable on account of the
proximity of the final examinations.
The crew, which will make the
Northern trip, has been materially
strengthened by the reappearance of
J. W. Fitting, '10, in his old position
as stroke. Fitting is a veteran of
proven ability, and as a stroke ranks
second to none on this Coast.
The men are training hard at Red
wood City every afternoon, and will
be in excellent trim for the race on
Lake Washington on May 25.
