# Ten Players Chosen to Represent Cardinal In International Rugby
## Personnel of College Players Who Will Make Up Squad Sailing from Pacific Coast for Australia Announced by Manager.—--The Fifteen Includes Names of National Athletic Fame. 
### 
The All-American College Rugby
team has been chosen—the team that
is to take the longest trip any college
athletic organization has ever enjoyed,
the monster journey to Australia for a
twelve-game rugby schedule with some
of the world's greatest fifteens, the
teams of the Antipodes. The above

twenty men are the players from the
three universities who are to go un
conditionally and who have finally ac
cepted. Four other men are practical
ly assured of being added to the list,
since only their acceptance of the offer
to go to Australia is needed before they
can be made members of the team.
Two of these men will be recruited
from California, to be announced next
Monday. Two others are to be veteran
supporters of the Stanford Cardinal,
and should be named publicly before
Sunday.
This chosen squad of twenty-four
men, from which tlie resulting selec
tion of fifteen men to go into action
against tbe powerful aggregation of
Australia is very nearly an ideal one,
and is very nearly as strong a group
of men as could be assembled from
rugby stars in tbe United States, ama
teur or professional. Two of the
greatest forwards in America are to
add their giant strength to the scrum.
These are Crawford, the Stanford 1908
captain, who, although it has not yet
been made public that he will be one
of the team, will probably take the
journey; and Northcroft, the Hercu
lean pack man of the California scrum

who won fame last fall. Crawford is
generally conceded to be the best all
around forward, while Northcroft eas
ily carries off the honors for dribbling,
that source of many scores in rugby
struggles. Northcroft is a native of
the Antipodes and will be in his
element among the southern islands.
Both Captains-Elect Will Go.
The Cardinal and Blue and Gold eacn
have their 1910 leaders in the team
that will cross the Pacific —K. L. Dole,
'11, of Stanford, and .T. Dwiggins, '11,
of California. Dole is a strong, all
round scrum player, and has been a
Cardinal mainstay for two years.
Dwiggins is one of the most versatile
backfield men on the Coast. He made
his reputation as a heady full back,
and also, being of small stature and a
fast performer, he can sometimes take
the tiller behind the pack, as scrum
half. Neither of the 1909 Varsity cap
tains are to form a part of the team.

As can be seen by the above line-up,
Stanford has the majority of the for
wards, with two more names to bo
added to the list, and it is evident that
these men are well-known and star

players. California contributes the
greater part of the backfield division,
including the fast Elliott, Allen and
Harris. Nevada has the two scrum
men who have been conspicuous play
ers at the Reno university during the
past season. Both the two men Stan
ford has yet to chose are forwards,
California has a choice from seven
men, four forwards and three backs.
With a substitute list of players such
as this, besides the regular fifteen that
is put into the games, the kind of a
fight that the American college men
will show the Australians should be a
pretty one to watch. It is not at all
doubtful but that, judging by the ex
hibition given by the Australian Wall
abies 011 the Coast in 1908, some rugby
scalps will be hanging from the belts
of the Stanford-California-Nevada
combination when it enters the port at
Vancouver on August 23. Giving the
team a week to get into condition after
reaching Brisbane, and to get acclim-

ated, the Varsity warriors on all
counts would be a close match for the
best that Australia can putin the
field. It will be interesting to watch
the scores of the twelve sames during

the six weeks pf play, as they are
sent across the Pacific to America. It
is almost possible to see even from
this distance from next fall, the stand
ard of rugby as played upon the Coast
going up to a world excellence. It is
not beyond the bounds of possibility
that such a team as this should be in-

vited to England to match its mettle
against the best the English Varsities
have to show, just as Yale and Har
vard are annually sending crews and
sometimes track teams across the At
lantic. This trip of Pacific colleges
to a world field of play should bring
much along with it for the future.
It was argued at the time when the
Stanford and California coaches and
managers could not decide on the
number going to Australia that thirty
men would barely be enough to under
go (he strenuous program arranged for
them by the south sea authorities —that
is, two entire teams. "Mother" Howe,
the Autralian coach who assisted
Coach Schaeffer at California last fall,
wanted to arrange for only twenty
men. Here the matter remained at
deadlock until recently when prepara
tions were begun for sending twenty
four men on the trip. All expenses,
for traveling and hotels, will be paid
by the New South Wales Rugby Union,
the organization that is behind the
nioveipent of inviting the American
team. Several games will be played
with fifteens from the Union. It has
been roughly estimated that the ex

siasts to bring the college team to
their shores should he very nearly
twenty thousand dollars. This amount,
however, will be easily made up from
gate receipts from the twelve contests.
As stated before, D. W. Burbank, '09,
will arrange the long journey, and he
has already made reservations wher
ever needed.
Coach Schaeffer in arranging his
men for the first line-up at Brisbane
would perhaps be in hard position to
decide just which of his stars he would
choose, ut even after he had one
fifteen on the field, he would still have j
nine powerful substitutes waiting on
the side-lines to take their turn at,
battering the Australian line of battle. 1
That is the point where the American ;
Varsiy combination will be strongest.
Twenty-four men, all trained by ex
pert, experienced coaches, ready at any j
time to take the places of their fel- j
lows In the All-American line without i
weakening the fifteen on the field to
any great extent.
