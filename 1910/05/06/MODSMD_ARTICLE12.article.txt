## 
### 
The Commencement number of the
"Sequoia" which appears Monday, will
undoubtedly be the largest and most
entertaining issue of that magazine
produced this year. The two leading
articles are an advance review of the
Senior play "Cousin Kate," and "What
Stanford Needs," by the editor-elect,
F. E. Hill, '11. Dr. Jordan contributes
two articles, "Roosevelt, the Man of
the West," a eulogy to the ex-presi
dent, and "Love and War," a fiction
story of Civil War times. G. F. Mor
gan, '10, contributes his last and best
snapshot, "The Senior." Other con
tirbutors are B. O. Bliven, '11, J. D.
HHouser, '10, E. J. Hopkins, '11, and
L. D. Summerfield, '12.
Editorially, the "Sequoia" deals with
"The Passing of 1910," "The Future of
the Conference," "Letters to Crew
Men." and "A Word About the Maga
zine."
