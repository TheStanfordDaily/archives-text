Acting upon their own initiative and
receiving comparatively no encourage
ment from the Student Body, the men
who are forwarding the game of soccer
and have raised it to such a high
standard here at Stanford, deserve
much consideration and support for
their laudable efforts. Tomorrow they
have scheduled a game against the
best soccer team in California upon the
Stanford Field and as a reward for the
efforts that they have been making,
they deserve more than a casual hope
for success. A further inducement to
assist these workers is the fact that
the proceeds of the game tomorrow
will be turned over to the track team
to help meet their expenses upon their
trip to Illinois. The soccer enthu
siasts have unselfishly done well and
they have much due them and it is
now within the power of the Student
Body to recognize their services by
giving their support tomorrow on the
bleachers.
