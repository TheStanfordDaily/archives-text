# ALL-CALIFORNIA WINS
## STANFORD SOCCER TEAM IS NO MATCH FOR CHAMPIONS. Local Players Make Fine Showing bat are Defeated by a Score of 5 to 0. 
### 
Although defeated by the All-Cali
fornia team last Saturday, Stanford
can well be proud of the showing made
by the soccer team in the final game.
Considering the fact that the former
aggregation are champions of the
Coast, and probably without peers in
this country, it is no small thing for
the Cardinal's practically inexperi
enced players to hold the score down
to 5 to 0. Ten out of the seventeen
men who made up the All-California
squad have in years past competed in
the International series between Eng
land and Scotland.
In the game last Saturday the Stan
ford team were in excellent condition
and were much speedier than their op
ponents; but the perfect passing
rushes of the opposing forwards, to
gether with the stonewall defense of
the backs, proved the veterans to be
far superior. No scoring was done
during the nip and tuck struggle of
the first twenty minutes of play, after
which Pike and Aitken each in turn
drove the ball into the goal, making
two tallies for the visitors. In the sec
ond half Welsh converted twice and
Pike once, making his final score 5 to 0.
That the score was not larger is
due principally to the good kicking of
McCann and Reynolds in the back
field, and the heady work of Erb and
Fyfe on the forward line. Lack of
team work was the great drawback of
the team, and next season, with this
fault overcome, Stanford should put
an excellent team into the field.
Noticeable among the stars of the
All-California team were Perkins,
Pike, Aitken, and Macfarlane, who is
beyond a doubt the best goal-keeper
now playing the English game on the
Coast. These men are familiar with
all the tricks of the game and used
them to good advantage last Saturday.
The new formation in the backfield
was particularly commendable, and
with the wonderful work of Macfar
lane in the goal, the local men found
it. impossible to land the ball into the
net. The teams lined up as follows:
Stanford —Forwards, Hubbard (cap
tain), Erb, Doron, Fyfe, Gregg, halves,
Hamilton, Reynolds, Williams; fulls,
Clyde, McCann; goal, Stuart.
All California —Forwards, Perkins
(captain, Pike, Aitken, Duncanson,
Walters, Welsh; backs, Delkirk, An
derson, Mizen, Watson, Jackson, Mc-
Laughlin, Munroe, Bernard; goal, Mac
farlane.
J. Askham of San Francisco ref
ereed the match, after which the vis
itors were the guests of the local play
ers at a banquet held at the Inn.
