# OLD PLAY IS CHOSEN
## ENGLISH CLUB WILL PRESENT ELIZABETHAN COMEDY. Beaumont and Fletcher's "Knight of the Burning Pestle" is Play Decided On. 
### 
Next semester, the English Club will
present for their annual play, Beau
mont and Fletcher's "Knight of the
Burning Pestle." This is a play of
the Elizabethan period and was pre
sented once before at Stanford by the
English Club in 1903. At that time
the play, coached by Professor Bassett,
was an unqualified success, and there
is no doubt that its second presenta
tion will be as favorably received.
The play is a rollicking comedy in
four acts, and is full of laughable sit
uations and funny speeches. The set
ting of the play will necessitate an
expenditure larger by far than the or
dinary cost of a Stanford production.
The reason for this is that the play
will be presented with a perfect
Elizabethan setting in order to make
the entire performance of the highest
possible class. This setting demands
the construction of an old-fashioned
stage upon the Assembly stage, with
all the accoutrements of boxes, stage
and pit. Such an attempt will be a
distinctly novel one for a Stanford
audience and the ultimate success will
be watched eagerly.
Professor Bassett, who coached the
play at the original production, with
such splendid success, may be called
upon again to see the performance
through to a fitting close, but nothing
definite has as yet been decided about
the coaching.
It has been the custom in the past
to hold the try-outs, for the English
Club plays in the spring semester, to
assign the parts, and have the mem
bers of the cast work on the rough
form of the action, and the committing
of the lines over the summer vacation.
In this way it has been found that
fewer rehearsals are required to com
plete the production. What the course
of the English Club will be in regard
to try-outs for this play has not as yet
been definitely determined, but it
seems probable that the same plan
that has proved so successful in the
past will be used again this year.
Final announcements as to the try
outs will be made in the near future.
The date set for the play is Friday,
September 30, giving the cast four
weeks after college opens in which to
rehearse.
