# FRESHMAN EDITION
## 
### 
The Jolly-Ups in the Armory, as in
augurated this year by the Junior
Class and so successfully followed by
the Sophomores on Saturday night,
are' probably one of the most success
ful ways for the members of a class to
become acquainted. When the col
lege was smaller it was far easier to
become acquainted with one's class
mates, but today it takes such gather
ings for the members of a class to be
come really acquainted and we hope to
see this custom continued. We hope
to see this form of Jolly-Up adopted
by the Freshmen.
