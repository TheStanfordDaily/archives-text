# SOPHOMORES GATHER AT ARMORY FOR CLASS MEETING.
## Men and Women of 1912 Hold Informal Dance and General Jinks on Saturday Night. 
### 
It has long been known to compet
ent authorities around the University
that a girl could catch a man if she
set out to do it, but it was never defi
nitely proved until Saturday evening
that she could al3o catch him, and
pass him too, in an actual running
race. Saturday evening it was proved
that the young ladies of the class of
1912 are second to none in regard to
sprinting abilities. The occasion for
the demonstration was the Sophomore
jolly-up at the Armory, and the event
was a picked relay race between the
best among the men an'l women of the
class. And the young women won by
a distance which the men refused to
divulge, but it was a serious beating.
The affair was absolutely informal.
All kinds of games were played, and
when those present were tired of play
ing games the dancing began. Robber
dances were the order of the day, and
lucky (or unlucky) was the man who
danced more than once around the
hall with the lady whom he stole, or
the one who had stolen him; for there
were ladies' choice, and gentlemen's
choice, and Paul Jones', and all sorts
of other dances. There was a supper
dance, too, with an informal pick-up
supper. Everybody pronounced the
affair a brilliant success.
