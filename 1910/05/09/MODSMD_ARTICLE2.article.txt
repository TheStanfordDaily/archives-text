# Seniors Will Wear Cap and Gown.
## 
### 
It is uncertain whether or not caps
and gowns will be here in time for
Class Day on Friday, May 20, but as
surance has been given that graduat
ing students may secure them for the
last Senior Singing to be held that
evening. In keeping with the recent
decision of the class all will be ex
pected to wear cap and gown at that
time, and it is urgently requested by
President L. S. Scott of the graduat

ing class that Seniors place their
orders for them at the Bookstore as
soon as possible.
