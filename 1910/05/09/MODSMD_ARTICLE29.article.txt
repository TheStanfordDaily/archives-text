# 1913 HOLDS JOLLY-UP
## FIRST GENERAL MEETING OF THE CLASS HELD FRIDAY. Games of All Kinds and a Big Feed Mark the First Freshman Affair. 
### 
On Friday evening the class of
1913 held their first general gathering
of all the members of the class. It
was felt by President Simpson and
others that it was time that the class
become better acquainted, and that
there should be one general meeting
before the close of the first year, at
which all the men and women could
become acquainted. Then this jolly
up was announced, with soft shirts
and old clothes for the men, and what
ever corresponds to this outfit among
the women.
Out behind the football field, the
picnic met. There was a big open
space there, fit for the playing of all
kinds of games. A swing was improv
ised among other things, and the af
fair started at about five.
The majority of the class must have
been represented by the showing that
was made, for there were more pres
ent by many times than had ever at
tended any of the class meetings dur
nig the entire year. In order to do
away with any unnecessary formality,
a system was adopted whereby every
body drew a partner. This gave the
affair a start in the right direction,
and' when the games commenced, with
their laughing and frivolity, the com
mon conventionalities were dropped
on the spot. The games that were
indulged in were all the old fashioned
ones, and a great number of others.
Everybody entered into the spirit of
these amusements.
The dinner following the games was
a masterpiece. What with the salad,
and the fruit, and the sandwiches, and
the coffee and the excitement, the
supper part of the evening was even
more successful than the games, if
that were possible.
Following the supper came a fine,
big bonfire, with the usual accom
paniment of songs and excitement.
This closed the evening, and when on
the way home once more all felt that
a most enjoyable and profitable time
had been had, and looked forward to
the next time that a president should
announce a jolly-up, with the knowl
edge that they would be going to do
something worth while.
