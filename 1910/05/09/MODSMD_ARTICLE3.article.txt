# HUSTON AND FERGUSON WIN.
## Take Final Bouts in Heavy-weight and Welter-weight Events Last Friday Afternoon. 
### 
As a result of the finals rounds last
Friday, J. C. Huston, '10, will hold the
heavyweight title for the coming year,
and N. R. Ferguson, '13, will claim the
championship in the welterweight
class.
As was expected, the Ferguson-Scott
match was an excellent exhibition,
Ferguson being more aggressive and
winning by a fair margin. The heavy
weight bouts were well contested, but
did not prove as scientific as the other
finals. Huston was given the decision
over M. P. Youker, '10.
The winners of the finals in the
other weights, which took place some
time ago, are: Middle-weight, H. R.
Stolz, '09, light-weight, J. M. Hughes,
'13, and feather-weight, J. T. Cooper,
*12.
