# BOOK FAVORABLY CRITICISED.
## Morgan's "Snapshots" Receives Professor Alden's Approval.—Quad Sale Tomorrow Morning. 
### 
Such is the opinion of Professor Al
lien, of the English Department.
"The Preface to Mr. Morgan's little
book explains that the sketches it con
tains are Snapshots in that they are
'hasty, sometimes out of perspective,
and seldom flattering, yet sufficiently
like the originals to be fairly easily
recognized.' There can be little doubt
that this promise is fulfilled, though
the analogy of the snap-shot does not
bring out the fact that the want of
perspective in the portraits i« inten
tional rather than accidental; in other
words, is of the nature of caricature,
so that one is amused not at the ex
pense of the artist but at that of the
subject. While none of the portraits
are altogether flattering, as has been
intimated, the author is not forgetful
of the better elements in his charac
ters, and rarely concludes without
hinting the possibilities which a hope
ful spirit may detect within them. The
Prof, outside the classroom, is
'strangely human;' the co-ed is a
despot, but with no unwilling victims;
the freshman, after all, is 'the hope of
the University.'
"It is clear that no Stanford man
or woman can find the Snapshots un
interesting. Whether serious for the
moment, or wholly in the way of fun,
they deal always with the real ele
ments of undergraduate life. They
also represent very real elements of
undergraduate dialect, so that an out
sider might at times feel the need of
a glossary; but it is only just to add
that the slang used is due not, as so
commonly, to poverty of vocabulary,
but to an evident desire to get the
word that will mean most for the pur
pose in hand. It should also be noted
that the sketches show a literary al
luslveness which is all too rare in
modern college humor, and adds per
ceptibly to its flavor. Not a little of
tliis humor would appeal to any read
er, in or out of college circles; and at
times there are unexpected flashes
which suggest the classic methods of
Hill Nye and Mark Twain."
