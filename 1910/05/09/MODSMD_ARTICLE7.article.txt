## 
### 
Miss Lucine Finch, one of America's
foremost dramatic readers, gave an
entertainment in the Assembly Hall on
Friday night to a most appreciative
and enthusiastic audience. She demon
strated her wonderful genius in her in
terpretation of her negro mammy's
songs, and stories told to her when a
child, and created a lasting impression
of charm and artistic skill upon her
numerous Stanford admirers.
About $140 was realized from ticket
sales, which amount is to be turned
over to the Women's Clubhouse fund.
