# CLUB FUND INCREASES
## STUDENTS CONTRIBUTE TO STANFORD UNION. Prompt Payment by Subscribers to Life Memberships.â€”Over $600 Collected by Student Committee. 
### 
If payments upon life memberships
in the Stanford Union are made with
the same rapidity and willingness with
which they have been made during the
past few months, the thousand dollar
mark will soon be reached here upon
the campus. According to Chairman
H. G. Ferguson, '11, those who have
subscribed toward this movement have
been very prompt in their payments
and this willingness upon the part of
those thus vitally concerned has made
it possible to make such progress.
Over six hundred dollars have been
collected upon subscriptions secured
by the local Student Committee at the
well remembered Stanford Union As
sembly. This money has been for
warded to Permanent Secretary R. W.
Barrett and has been entered to the
account of the Stanford Union.
With such a start as this, the con
tributions that the students will make
toward the supplying of actual cash
for the building of the clubhouse next
fall will play a considerable part and
will greatly aid the Board of Trustees
in their work of erecting the building
during its early stages. Cash on hand
is needed by this committee before any
action is taken toward commencing
operations upon the structure itself.
Before any progress along this line is
made, the Board must be in possession
of $25,000 and at the rate at which this
money is accumulating there is little
doubt but that this sum will be secured
before the summer is over.
According to Chairman Ferguson,
there are many of the subscribers to life
memberships that have overlooked the
fact that they can make more than one
payment in two months. Many of the
subscribers have made only one pay
ment and have not followed this with
additional installments.
Five life memberships have been
paid in full by A. H. Meyer, '10, R. S.
Slade, '11, A. L. Jacob!, '11, W. R.
Chandler, '13, L. H. Price, '13. These
students have received notification
from Secretary Barrett of their life
interest in the Union and have been
credited with the $50 paid by them.
Although no official cards of member
ship have as yet been printed, it is ex
pected that some will be secured dur
ing the next few weeks for those who
have met their obligations at this early
date.
Payments during the summer may
either be made to R. W. Barrett, 502
Humboldt Bank Building, San Fran
cisco, or to H. G. Ferguson, 079 W.
Prospect Ave., Hollywood, California.
H is desired that installments be paid
to the last named collector as all stu
dent accounts are listed with him and
payments made to the permanent sec
retary will give rise to some confu
sion and unnecessary trouble.
