# LAW MEN BANQUET.
## Enthusiastic Gathering at Palace Hotel.â€”President Jordan and District Attorney Fickert Speak. 
### 
The animal meeting and dinner of
the Stanford Law Association was the
occasion of an enthusiastic meeting of
alumni, faculty members and law stu
dents at the Palace Hotel in San Fran
cisco. The affair was an innovation
inasmuch as all former banquets of the
association have been held upon the
campus during Commencement Week.
Many alumni who would not otherwise
have attended were attracted by the
holding of the affair in San Francisco
and this was consequently the largest
and most successful meeting yet held,
about 80 members and guests taking
seats about the table.
The toastmaster was B. P. Oakford,
and those who responded to toasts
were President Jordon, District Attor
ney C. M. Fickert, Professor F. C.
Woodward, F. V. Keesling, Judge Stur
tevant, and City Attorney P. V. Long.
The following officers were elected for
the ensuing year: President, F. V.
Keesling; secretary-treasurer, R. B.
Boiland.
