# TENNIS CHANCES GOOD
## BRILLIANT OUTLOOK FOR NEXT YEAR'S TEAM. Only One Member of 1910 Squad Leaves.—Much New Material Expected. 
### 
For years past,—and this year was
no exception to the rule—Stanford has
gone down to defeat on the tennis
courts, but from present indications,
next year promises to tell a different
story. The granting by the executive
committee, of a minor "S" to the mem
bers of the tennis team has served to
stimulate interest in the sport and
consequently a better grade of tennis
can be expected. The new courts
which are to be putin first class shape
next semester will aid in permitting a
greater number to take part.
Of this year's team who gave the
California veterans such a hard fight,
Mann is the only one who will not re
turn to college. California, however,
will suffer severely from the loss of
Herbert Long and Dewey Powell, both
of whom graduate with tne Class of
1910.
Quite an influx of new material from
both the north and south is expected.
E. Fottrel of St. Ignatius, who won the
Stanford Interscholastic tournament
has signified his intention of entering
the University in the fall. From the
south comes the word that Mace, the
former Interscholastic champion of
Southern California and Hurd of
Throop, the present champion, will
join the Cardinal ranks next Septem
ber. From among these cracks and
some of the lesser lights, who may
develop into stars, a team capable of
taking California's measure can no
doubt be found.
