# LAST NUMBER OF CHAPARRAL IS THE COMMENCEMENT ISSUE
## 
### 
The Commencement number of the
"Chaparral" is now off the press and
will be placed on sale next Thursday.
This is the last issue of this popular
publication for this year and as is
customary in the final number, the
jokes are mostly at the expense of the
Seniors and Commencement Week.
Among the art features are full page
drawings by A. S. Mac Donald, '10, and
A. T. King, '10; sketches by Miss Rible,
'10, A. T. King, '12, E. M. Albright, '12,
B. H. Lasky, '12, E. C. Smith, '13, A. P.
Hill, '13, and J. L. Duff, '13.
The humorous section is particularly
large and is alive with jokes and
stories. The feature of this department
of the magazine is the "Hints to the
Helpless", by H. H. Beall, ex-'ll. This
is by far the best long humorous story
that has appeared this year. Other
amusing pieces are: "A Journalism
Ex," by B. O. Bliven.'ll, which is a
take-off upon the new department that
has been added to the University cur
riculum; "Dilletante," by E. E. Mat

Howell, '12, L. I). Summerfield, '12, A.
J. Hall, '13, and C. F. Paul, '13.
Editorially "Chappie" deals with a
retrospect of the college year, the
Seniors, literary conditions at Stan
ford, and a closing tribute to the
"Chaparral" staff.
As a fitting close to the most suc
cessful year in the history of their or
ganization, Hammer and Coffin will
hold a sumptuous banquet at the Plaza
Restaurant this evening at S o'clock.
G. F. Morgan, the present editor-in
chief, will preside as toastmaster. At
the conclusion of the banquet the his

of the society will be formally placed
in the care of E. C. Matthias, the edi
tor-elect. who will assume Morgan's
