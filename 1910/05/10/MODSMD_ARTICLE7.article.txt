## SENIOR BALL COMMITTEE COMPLETES TASK. Arrangements for Affair Have Been Finished, and Hall Awaits the Dancers. 
### 
All details, ideas and plans that
have entered into the policy of the
senior Hal 1 committee this year have
now been accepted or shunned by the
members, as the final arrangements
have been passed upon, and positively
no change in the slightest will be con
sidered by them. In other words, the
committee has gone the limit in its
effort to make the affair one of the
most gorgeous and successful of its
kind that has ever been the pleasure of
a college set to attend.
From the first dance until the
couples see the morning sun arising
over the Mt. Hamilton range, there
will be continued pleasures and sur
prises for the people in attendance.
The programs are absolutely different
from any other program ever issued at
Stanford, or any other place. It is
original and undoubtedly will be one
of the main sources of current conver
sation 011 the evening of the ball. And
as usual, the supper will be the best
the caterers can produce for any price,
no limit of expense, or worry having
been given an opportunity to obstruct
this feature. The floor of the Vendome
Hotel, where the ball will be held,
will glow in the lights of the hall, as
Sir Walter's lake did, and the ro
mances which will glide over its sur
face can not be surpassed even by
those which glided over the lake of
which it is so symbolical. Further
more, the surprises promised by the
management of the hotel will not fall
below expectation.
Although the affair is guaranteed to
be a record maker, the masculine
members who anticipate attending this
function must not forget that the price
is six dollars, this sum purchases both
the ticket of admittance, and trans
portation of those concerned in the
ticket. It also must be remembered
that the ticket is only good on the cars
leaving the tSanford Bookstore that
evening at 6:30 o'clock sharp and all
those missing this train take their own
chances in getting transportation to
San Jose.
The program and the transportation
tickets may be obtained on the pre
sentation of the ball tickets between
10:15 and 12:15 o'clock, Wednesday,
May 18 and thereafter from J. P.
Levy in room 151, Encina. The ball
tickets may be purchased at the Book
store, and any one expecting to attend
who has not secured his tickets will
confer a favor upon the committee by
obtaining them at once, so that ar
rangements for a definite number can
be prepared.
