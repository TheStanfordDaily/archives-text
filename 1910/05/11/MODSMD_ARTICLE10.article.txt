There has been an exceptionally
large sale of the "Snapshots of Stan
ford Life," by G. F. Morgan, '10, which

were placed on sale upon the Quad this
morning. In all probability the entire
edition will be disposed of before the
end of the week. The sale on the
Quad will be discontinued after today,
but copies can be secured at the Stan
ford Bokstore or at Hyde's Bookstore
in Palo Alto.
