# Prepared for Trip East
## Schedule for Eastern Journey Complete.---First Meet in Provo, Utah, on May 25, in Contest with Brigham Young University. 
### 
Champaign, Illinois, where on June
4, will be decided the track-champion
ship of Western America, is the goal
towards which a team of Cax-dinal
stars will soon be headed. Being with
out a peer on the Pacific Coast, it will
be interesting to see how the Stanford
aggregation stacks up against the
eastern wonders. Twice meeting de
feat by an extremely narrow margin,
due in a great part to the small num
ber of men entered, the third suc
cessive attempt should result in a
victory, as this year, eleven men will
be taken to Illinois.
The men chosen to make the trip
are the best athletes Stanford posseses
and if this aggregation comes to grief
in an even contest, the winning team
will be composed of record-breakers.
The ten men who will travel from Palo
Alto in a body are as follows: L. H.
Scott, '10, S. H. Bellah, '10, H. E.
Reed. '10, W. M. Wyman, '11, C. C.
Taylor, '11, T. L. Coleman, '12, W. H.
Newman, '12, K. F. Lee, '12, and W. E.
Woolley, '12. At the meet with the
University of Colorado, M. Obear, '12,
will compete in the sprints and G.
Perry, '10, in the longer races. The
team will have the services of H. R.
Stolz, '10, in the big conference meet,
but the quarter-miler cannot possibly
take part in any of the preliminary
contests. Perry will also be one of
the competitors at Champaign.
In the conference meets of the past,
Stanford has been unfortunate in that
none of the minor teams were able to
secure points, thus allowing such
teams as Chicago and Illinois, which
enter a large number of men, to pick
up enough second and third places to
win. This year, however, the tale will
be different, for the entrance of the
Blue and Gold team in the meet will
cause a big split in the points. With
her half-milers and hurdlers California
cannot possibly do any harm to Stan
ford, while she can take away enough
points from the eastern institutions to
allow the Cardinal team to nose out a
victory.
Whether or not Stanford will win,
depends on the question of Captain
Scott's eligibility. There is no ques
tion but that Bellah can annex the
first position in the vault if Scott
should be disbarred, but with the
world's champion allowed to compete, j
eight points are certain to be scored
in the Stanford specialty. Scott re-

cently received a letter from an offi
cial of the eligibility committee who
stated that the gentleman who de
clared the Stanford captain ineligible
had 110 authority whatsoever for the
j declaration and made the statement
without waiting for the action of the
committee. The Illinois man went on
to say that in all probability Scott
would be allowed to compete. The
"Daily Illini," the University of Illi
nois publication, states that in pre
paration for the oncoming western
vaulters, new fourteen foot standards
have been built.
Under the leadership of Captain L.
Scott, the team will leave Oakland
mole at 6: 48 on the night of May
21, going direct to Provo, Utah. In
the Mormon country, the team will
meet Brigham Young University in a
dual meet 011 May 25. Leaving Provo
immediately after the contest, the
men will travel to Denver, where the
University of Colorado will be the vic
tim. Finishing this little appointment,
the last laj) of the journey will be en
tered and Chicago will be reached on
the 29th. This will give the men four
days to acclimate themselves. As
there are over 400 entries, the heats
will be run off on the morning of
June 3 so as to give the athletes op
portunity to recuperate for the finals.
Captain Scott has succeded in mak
ing arrangements for the housing of
the men in the D. Iv. E. house at Il
linois. This will do away with the
expenditure of a considerable sum of
money, and besides will be a matter of
great convenience to the men.
TO GO FURTHER EAST.
After the conference meet, Lee Scott,
H. E. Reed, T. L. Coleman and K. F.
Lee will journey to the Atlantic coast,
where they participate in the big
eastern collegiate contests. This
quartet will be heard from in their
travels and should make the wires
hum with news of their victories.
Scott will meet close competition in
only a few places, while Coleman and
Reed will count in any meet in the
country. The furlong in the eastern
conference will give the wonderful
sophomore a chance to show his true
class. Although Lee has not com
peted this ytear, in his trial spins he
has shown marvelous speed and "Dad"
looks on him to do under 4:30 in the
big contests.

be different, for the entrance of the
Blue and Gold team in the meet will
cause a big split in the points. With
her half-milers and hurdlers California
cannot possibly do any harm to Stan
ford, while she can take away enough
points from the eastern institutions to
allow the Cardinal team to nose out a
victory.
Whether or not Stanford will win,
depends on the question of Captain
Scott's eligibility. There is no ques
tion but that Bellah can annex the
first position in the vault if Scott
should be disbarred, but with the
world's champion allowed to compete, j
eight points are certain to be scored
in the Stanford specialty. Scott re-

cently received a letter from an offi
cial of the eligibility committee who
stated that the gentleman who de
clared the Stanford captain ineligible
had 110 authority whatsoever for the
j declaration and made the statement
without waiting for the action of the
committee. The Illinois man went on
to say that in all probability Scott
would be allowed to compete. The
"Daily Illini," the University of Illi
nois publication, states that in pre
paration for the oncoming western
vaulters, new fourteen foot standards
have been built.
Under the leadership of Captain L.
Scott, the team will leave Oakland
mole at 6: 48 on the night of May
21, going direct to Provo, Utah. In
the Mormon country, the team will
meet Brigham Young University in a
dual meet 011 May 25. Leaving Provo
immediately after the contest, the
men will travel to Denver, where the
University of Colorado will be the vic
tim. Finishing this little appointment,
the last laj) of the journey will be en
tered and Chicago will be reached on
the 29th. This will give the men four
days to acclimate themselves. As
there are over 400 entries, the heats
will be run off on the morning of
June 3 so as to give the athletes op
portunity to recuperate for the finals.
Captain Scott has succeded in mak
ing arrangements for the housing of
the men in the D. Iv. E. house at Il
linois. This will do away with the
expenditure of a considerable sum of
money, and besides will be a matter of
great convenience to the men.
TO GO FURTHER EAST.
After the conference meet, Lee Scott,
H. E. Reed, T. L. Coleman and K. F.
Lee will journey to the Atlantic coast,
where they participate in the big
eastern collegiate contests. This
quartet will be heard from in their
travels and should make the wires
hum with news of their victories.
Scott will meet close competition in
only a few places, while Coleman and
Reed will count in any meet in the
country. The furlong in the eastern
conference will give the wonderful
sophomore a chance to show his true
class. Although Lee has not com
peted this ytear, in his trial spins he
has shown marvelous speed and "Dad"
looks on him to do under 4:30 in the
big contests.
Champaign, Illinois, where on June
4, will be decided the track-champion
ship of Western America, is the goal
towards which a team of Cax-dinal
stars will soon be headed. Being with
out a peer on the Pacific Coast, it will
be interesting to see how the Stanford
aggregation stacks up against the
eastern wonders. Twice meeting de
feat by an extremely narrow margin,
due in a great part to the small num
ber of men entered, the third suc
cessive attempt should result in a
victory, as this year, eleven men will
be taken to Illinois.
The men chosen to make the trip
are the best athletes Stanford posseses
and if this aggregation comes to grief
in an even contest, the winning team
will be composed of record-breakers.
The ten men who will travel from Palo
Alto in a body are as follows: L. H.
Scott, '10, S. H. Bellah, '10, H. E.
Reed. '10, W. M. Wyman, '11, C. C.
Taylor, '11, T. L. Coleman, '12, W. H.
Newman, '12, K. F. Lee, '12, and W. E.
Woolley, '12. At the meet with the
University of Colorado, M. Obear, '12,
will compete in the sprints and G.
Perry, '10, in the longer races. The
team will have the services of H. R.
Stolz, '10, in the big conference meet,
but the quarter-miler cannot possibly
take part in any of the preliminary
contests. Perry will also be one of
the competitors at Champaign.
In the conference meets of the past,
Stanford has been unfortunate in that
none of the minor teams were able to
secure points, thus allowing such
teams as Chicago and Illinois, which
enter a large number of men, to pick
up enough second and third places to
win. This year, however, the tale will
be different, for the entrance of the
Blue and Gold team in the meet will
cause a big split in the points. With
