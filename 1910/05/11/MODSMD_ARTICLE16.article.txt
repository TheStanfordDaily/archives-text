# Well Known Comedy Ready for Presentation by Senior Class
## Hubert Henry Davies' Successful Production "Cousin Kate," as Interpreted by College Cast, Is Interesting in Every Line.---Seniors Attain High Standard in Annual Play. 
### 
The tenth and last amateur attrac
tion to be staged in the Assembly Hall
during the present college year will
be the brilliant light comedy, "Cousin
Kate," from the pen of Hubert Henry
Davies. The piece will be presented
by the Class of 1910 as the first event
of their Commencement Week and will
be seen on the evening of Wednesday,
May 18. The play is clean, lively and
pleasing and should form a fitting re
laxation after the trials of the fast ap
proaching final examinations. Judg
ing from the number of seats sold on
the campus and in Palo Alto today, an
extremely large audience from a Senior
play will witness the production.
"Cousin Kate" was the first big suc
cess achieved by its author, Hubert
Henry Davies, who has since won ex
tensive fame as a playwright both in
England and the United States. Miss
Ellis Jeffreys, the celebrated London
comedienne, starred in the original
production of the play which was pre
sented to the public in the British
capital. London's appreciation of the
comedy was so pronounced that its
run was lengthened month after
month until almost a year had elapsed
after the first performance before the
play was finally sent on tour. Only a
few months later Miss Ethel Harry
more essayed the title role in the
American company which opened in
New York and remained an entire sea
son before being sent on the road.
Ethel Barrymore has never attained
greater success than with the play
which the Seniors will produce one
week from tonight.
"Cousin Kate" is neither very dra
matic nor very emotional. Interest
ing types and bright dialogue make it
succeed. The seven characters are all
distinctly and quaintly drawn. The
high-spirited Kate, the whimsical
Heath, the supercilious Bartlett, the
simple Mrs. Spencer, the pretty Amy.

(he noisy Jane, and the not very un
usual boy; they are all different, and
the contrasts will be fully brought out
by the cast of collegians.
An extremely distinguishing feature

THE CAST

of "Cousin Kate" is its rather remark
able second act. As the comedy con
tains but three acts the second is by far

the most important, and yet only three
characters appearand the third but for
a minute or two just before the drop
ping of the curtain. Heath and Kate
are the two people upon whom falls

the burden of making the act and, to a
great degree, the play. A more unique
act is found only in Margaret Illing-

ton's famous drama "The Thief," in
(he second scene of which only the
husband and wife appear.
Frank L. Mathieu, of San Francisco,
who has coached all save the musical

pieces during the past year, has charge
of "Cousin Kate," and from his ac
complishments in the past it is safe
to predict that the Senior Class will
present a play finished and smooth
with every possible dramatic oppor
tunity enhanced to the utmost. In his
knowledge of stage technique and in
his ability to handle beginning ama
teurs, Mathieu is unexcelled. During
his regime at Stanford, local dramat
ics have reached a height hitherto un
dreamed of, and for this the coach de
serves by far the major portion of the
glory.
George E. Lyon, the San Francisco
scene painter, is just concluding his
work on the scenery for the produc
tion, which will be fully adequate to
the demands of the play.
Of the seven people cast in the piece,
Miss A. Wright and W. P. Fuller, Jr.,
have had the greatest experience, and
both of them make their farewell ap
pearance in "Cousin Kate." Miss
right has a role far more suited to
her than any she has heretofore at
tempted and she promises to be ex
cellent in the title part. Fuller at
tempts a straight lead for the first time
in his college career.
Of the other five, four have been
seen before and are sure to be heard
from in the future. Undoubtedly, the
surprise of the piece will be the great
performance which M. W. Strong will
give as the Rev. James Bartlett. Al
though late in taking the part, Strong
will score one of the biggest bits of
the show. Miss Campbell is perfectly
cast and will make the most of her
many chances as Mrs. Spencer, while
Miss J. A. Heartt will win all but the
most adamant as the pretty Amy
Spencer. Master Raymond Richardson
makes his debut in the role of Bobby.
The sale of seats will oc itinue at
the campus Bookstore am ihe Stan-

ford Pharmacy until the afternoon of
the "performance.
The University Orchestra will begin
the overture promptly at 8:15, and the
curtain will he up by 8:30.
