# WASHINGTON REGATTAS.
## 
### 
1907—Won by Washington.
190S—Won by Washington.
1909—Won by Stanford.
Once again to lower the purple and
gold colors of Washington—where the
making of oarsmen comes as second
nature—will be the prime ambition of
Stanford Varsity eight in traveling
1300 miles to the northern state on
May 17, for a race on the 25th. Last
year, the Cardinal boat for the first
time since races were begun between
the two universities, crossed the line
ahead of the Washington shell, the
winner by three lengths. Odds on this
three-mile struggle between the eights
had been three to one in favor of the
Seattle men. Stanford's crew, how
ever, after being several lengths be
hind for the first two miles pulled
ahead with surprising spirit and
strength, overturning completely all
the prophecies of the twenty thousand
or more people who viewed the race

last May. Upon the crew, Washing
ton rests all her fondest athletic am
bitions, and for Stanford to have low
ered her pennant was a distinct tri
umph. Her eight goes to meet the
Badger oarsmen of the University of
Wisconsin at Madison in June, and it

may be assured that it will pull its
hardest against Stanford in order to
carry east a rowing scalp.
The big Varsity struggle this May
comes on the 25th, five days after the
Cardinal crew is due to arrive in Seat
tle. This leaves them only four or five
days in which to get into trim—very
likely four at most, allowing for time
taken in transporting the shell. More
over, the crew has been able to vis!t
Redwood for practice only occasional
ly, and are hence handicapped in that
way. In addition, the stroke has had
to be changed since the middle of last
week, owing to the impossibility of
having J. W. Fitting, '10, occupy the
first seat in the shell. He is to cross
the Pacific with the football men. The
oarsmen, therefore, have had to adapt
themselves to the new stroke, that of
Partridge, for the last few days. Part
ridge stroked in the California race,
and kept his head satisfactorily. He
will be capable of dictating the stroke
on Lake Washington, but the mixing of

the strokes of the two men in the past
two weeks will undoubtedly weaken
the eight. But the power of adapt
ability in the Stanford rowers was
never more at hand, and they can be
trusted to make up the handicap, as
they, themselves, expect.

[ As to this, Coxswain F. L. Guerena,
who is in as good a position as anyone
to judge, says: "We have as sure a
chance of winning against Washington
as we did last year. The crew is going
up against a powerful eight, hut the
same spirit we had in the last race is
still with us, and we should win."
Captain Huston has emphasized the
fact that the men are in good condition
—not the very best, but in good, all
round shape, all that could be expected
at this stage of the college work, and
this period of training. Weights have
gone down to some extent. A few
men are less heavy. The average in
the boat, however, is still 179, as com
pared with the 181 1-8 showing made
by the men against California
But even with the loss of weight the
Stanford crew is still considerably
ahead of the Washington men, who
have to their credit only an average
of 175%. This shows the Cardinals
4% pounds heavier per man. In height
also the crew has a 1-6 inch advan-

tage. The Stanford men are, moreover,
over two years younger per man than
their opponents. Stanford has five
Sophomores and two Freshmen among
the personnel. Washington also num
bers five second-year men, but no
Freshmen in the eight.

Taking everything into account,
Stanford has an apparent advantage
over her northern rivals, and has more
than an even chance to make the vic
tories during the years for each uni
versity number two each. And it Is
safe to say that odds will not be given
at Seattle for the race this May.
Because of the loss of stroke Fitting,
and the irreparable loss of Captain
elect C. L. Scahaupp at Number 4, sev
eral eleventh-hour changes have had to
be made in the eight that took the
shell down the Estuary against the
Blue and Gold in April. Partridge
still strokes, as mentioned above.
Hofer will take Schaupp's place at No.
4; Hails will handle Hofer's oar at
No. 2, Seward going into the bow posi
tion. R. P. Duryea, '13, from the vic
torious Freshman four of last April,
goes in, as a new Varsity rower, at
No. 3, Seward's former seat. J. W.
Roberts, '10, who made his letter this
year against the Blue and Gold, is to
pilot the shell on Lake Washington,

Querena having made the trip last
May. Daryea is the only new man in
the shell. He is, however, absolutely
able to take care of Varsity responsi
bility, and will easily make one of the
strong cogs in the Cardinal machine.
P. V. Acker, '11, will substitute.
