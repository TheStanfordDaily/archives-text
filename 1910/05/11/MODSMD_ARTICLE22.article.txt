# FACULTY WILL PLAY SENIORS.
## Traditional Conflict Between Rival Teams Will Take Place on Saturday, May 21. 
### 
According to custom, the Faculty
and Seniors will cross bats on Satur
day, May 21. The competition is keen
for places on the Faculty team, and the
exact line-up will not be known until
that nine makes its appearance upon
the field. Dr. Angell states that some
surprises will be found in the new
team, and a number of dark horses
will be brought out.
The Seniors have already picked
their men and the personnel of their
team will remain unchanged, should
all the members' names appear on the
final list for graduation. The line-up
is as follows: Pitcher, C. C. Sampson;
catcher, L. H. Cochran; first base, G.
McGregor; second base, L. Scott;
short stop, R. C. McFadden; third base,
B. W. Upson; left field, J. R. Holman;
center field, H. Robertson; right field,
A. B. Cook.
