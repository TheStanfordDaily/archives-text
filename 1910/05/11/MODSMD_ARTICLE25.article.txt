# COMMITTEE URGES PAYMENT.
## Senior Monetary Board Suggests That all Members of Class of 1910 Pay Assessments. 
### 
In view of the fact that the Finance
Committee of the Senior Class has
succeeded in reducing the amount of
the assessment that has been placed
upon each member of the Class of 1910,
| to $2, that board expects a prompt
payment of the tax. The assessments
are now due and the committee is anx
| iously awaiting the result of the pay
ments, relying upon the loyalty of the
Class as a whole to assist them in
meeting all the expenses that will have
to be met immediately subsequent to
the conclusion of Senior Week.
As has been mentioned before, the
payment from each individual is $2,
and is payable to B. W. Upson, M. Y.
Malone or H. Rittigstein. But besides
the satisfaction that the payment of
this assessment will give to every
member of the class, according to the
opinion of the Finance Committee,
there are other inducements. For
every tax that is paid, a Senior Week
program and the accompanying invita
tion forms are given to the bearer of
the receipt for the $2. To facilitate
the settling of all financial matters
and the securing of a high standard of
Senior Week, the Senior monetary
committee urgently requests that every
member of the class pay his or her
assessment within the next few days.
These may be now paid at the Stan
ford Bookstore.
