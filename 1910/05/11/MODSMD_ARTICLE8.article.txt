# Track Men
## TO COMPETE IN CITY STANFORD ATHLETES IN MEET NEXT SATURDAY. Five Track Men Will Strive for Places In California Conference Meet in San Francisco. 
### 
Stanford will be unable to enter a
full team in the first Coast Conference
Meet which is scheduled to be held at
Berkeley on Friday. The final exam
inations will prevent many of the best
Cardinal athletes from entering the
meet and the team will be weakened
correspondingly. The greatest num
ber of men who could be scraped to
gether to participate on Friday, totals
five athletes and, although these men
are good for points in their respective
evtns, a victory cannot be expected.
L. Scott, '10, the wizard in the air,
will take part in the pole-vault and
will give an exhibition to the men from
Washington and Idaho in his event.
The captain may also enter the broad
jump, but he will probably confine his
efforts to the pole-vault as a safe
guard against accident. 11 feet 7 in.
is the greatest height which any of
the Northern men have cleared so
close competition will be lacking. The
other Stanford entries are C. C. Taylor,
'11, H. E. Reed, '10. L. H.H Price, '13
and G. L. Horine, '13.
Taylor will go up against fast com
pany in the quarter-mile and may have
to take a second or third place, but the
experience will be invaluable to the
Stanford man on his eastern trip. Gish,
of Seattle and Butler of California
look to be the winners in this race.
The high-jump is Horine's pie and he
can eat it as he sees fit. Bull and Hill,
of California, are the only ones who
seem at all likely to come near the
Palo Alto boy.
Although Reed was forced to take a
second place the hundred in the In
tercollegiate meet, the record-holder
has been training faithfully since then
and will land at least five points on
Friday. Freshman Price, '12, the new
ly developed miler, is going to Ber
keley with the determination of beat
ing Saxon on his own track. This
runner who proved such a surprise to
everyone in the Varsity meet may turn
the tables on the Californian and beat
him to the tape. Price has plenty of
endurance as was shown when he
finished second to Saxon.
