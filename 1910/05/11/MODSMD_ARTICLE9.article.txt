# QUADRANGLE CLUB ASSISTS.
## Honor Society Adds $50 to Fund to Send Track Team East for Conference Meet. 
### 
The total cost of the eastern trip, in
cluding the expenses of eleven men
and Trainer Monlton will probably
exceed $2,000. Captain Scott, who is
managing the venture, has now at
hand about $1795, thus facing a deficit
of approximately $205. To cover this
amount it will be necessary to solicit
subscriptions from the merchants in
Palo Alto and the Alumni.
To assist in the project and to make
sure that the deficit is met the Quad
rangle Club has voted to donate fifty
dollars towards the good of the cause
and it is expected that the fund will
be further enlarged from similar
sources.
