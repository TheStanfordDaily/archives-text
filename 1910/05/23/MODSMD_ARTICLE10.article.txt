# "COUSIN KATE" INTRODUCES COMMENCEMENT FUNCTIONS
## 
### 
From the moment when Cousin Kate
blew in (for no other word will fit) to
her aunt's drawing room, we knew, as
did that admirable lady, that "ever/
thing wo'tld turn out all right," not
only for that disturbed household, but
for the play that ushered in the festi
vities of Senior Week. And our con
fidence was justified, for with the ex
ception of natural lapses, the play was
better and better as it went on.
Miss Wright, in the title role, had
a natural command of all the moods
that found expression in her part—
arch gaiety, elder sister sympathy,
romantic sensibility, self sacrificing
loyalty. That the gaiety was best
proved either how lightly Cousin Kate
carried her twenty-nine years or how
charming a quality Miss Wright put
in her part. Charming it certainly
was.
W. P. Fuller interpreted Heath Des
mond with a pleasing combination of
imaginativeness and ardor and skil
fully attacked the difficulties of his
part. He was handicapped by an un
convincing make-up and by a tendency
to bear down too heavily in the senti
mental passages; but in this latter
aspect the fault lay largely in the lines
of the play, which was not wholly
suited to the ambitions of amateur
production. Miss Wright's best scenes
owed much of their success to his able
support.
Especially praiseworthy was Strong's
good taste in keeping the part of the
"locum tenens" a trifle this side of
positive burlesque. That, was no easy
thing to do, considering his lines, and
Amy—the Amy of the play—had cause
to be grateful to him. The incidental
business of his part was consistent
and effective.
Miss Campbell portrayed the be
wildered but trusting mother with a
delicate quaintness that was most
pleasing. It was not until the last
act that the possibilities of her role
were fully developed, but when that
time came she had a delightful re
serve of quiet humor to draw on.
To say that we liked Miss Heartt's
Amy so well that we wished her a
better fate, that Bobby's family loyalty

was worthy of its cause and that
Jane's few entrances were all as de
lightful as her pig-tail, expresses per
haps too mildly the praise those actors
well deserve.
All in all, the acting was well sus
tained and in parts nothing short of
admirable. But the play, although it
furnished some delightful scenes, was
unconvincing to an absurd degree.
Ardent wooing to an accompaniment
of stage thunder will tax any amateur
beyond his strength; and what could
even a professional do with the char
acter who turns from the conquest of

an unknown woman, to woo from his
fiancee a promise—that she will not
marry him! Yet after all, what if the
play was impossible in spots? We en
joyed it all, for one reason or another,
partly for the genuinely good comedy
scenes of the play, partly for the
sympathetic portrayal of good charac
ter parts and partly because examina
tions were over and we were getting
into the holiday mood of Senior Week.

ception of natural lapses, the play was
better and better as it went on.
Miss Wright, in the title role, had
a natural command of all the moods
that found expression in her part—
arch gaiety, elder sister sympathy,
romantic sensibility, self sacrificing
loyalty. That the gaiety was best
proved either how lightly Cousin Kate
carried her twenty-nine years or how
charming a quality Miss Wright put
in her part. Charming it certainly
was.
W. P. Fuller interpreted Heath Des
mond with a pleasing combination of
imaginativeness and ardor and skil
fully attacked the difficulties of his
part. He was handicapped by an un
convincing make-up and by a tendency
to bear down too heavily in the senti
mental passages; but in this latter
aspect the fault lay largely in the lines
of the play, which was not wholly
suited to the ambitions of amateur
production. Miss Wright's best scenes
owed much of their success to his able
support.
Especially praiseworthy was Strong's
good taste in keeping the part of the
"locum tenens" a trifle this side of
positive burlesque. That, was no easy
thing to do, considering his lines, and
Amy—the Amy of the play—had cause
to be grateful to him. The incidental
business of his part was consistent
and effective.
Miss Campbell portrayed the be
wildered but trusting mother with a
delicate quaintness that was most
pleasing. It was not until the last
act that the possibilities of her role
were fully developed, but when that
time came she had a delightful re
serve of quiet humor to draw on.
To say that we liked Miss Heartt's
Amy so well that we wished her a
better fate, that Bobby's family loyalty

was worthy of its cause and that
Jane's few entrances were all as de
lightful as her pig-tail, expresses per
haps too mildly the praise those actors
well deserve.
All in all, the acting was well sus
tained and in parts nothing short of
admirable. But the play, although it
furnished some delightful scenes, was
unconvincing to an absurd degree.
Ardent wooing to an accompaniment
of stage thunder will tax any amateur
beyond his strength; and what could
even a professional do with the char
acter who turns from the conquest of

an unknown woman, to woo from his
fiancee a promise—that she will not
marry him! Yet after all, what if the
play was impossible in spots? We en
joyed it all, for one reason or another,
partly for the genuinely good comedy
scenes of the play, partly for the
sympathetic portrayal of good charac
ter parts and partly because examina
tions were over and we were getting
into the holiday mood of Senior Week.
