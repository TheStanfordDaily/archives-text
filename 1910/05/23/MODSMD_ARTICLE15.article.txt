# QUADRANGLE TO BE SCENE OF ANNUAL PROMENADE TONIGHT
## 
### 
Unique in its character and pleas
ing in its simplicity, the Senior Prom-1
enade tonight is another link in the |
chain of unequaled festivities for a
final week of social functions. The
Senior From is distinct from any of
the other events that have been held
during the last week that the Univer-'
sity is kept open for the various fes
tivities. It is in a class of its own for
the reason that it is a decided depart- j
ure from the usual indoor elaborate
function.
The affair tonight, under the direc
tion of Chairman R. C. McFadden,
promises at the present time to outdo
in completeness and originality, the
majority of those that have been held
before by previous Senior classes. !
The Senior Prom Committee has given
assurances that this particular event '
is to be the one festivity of the week
above others and is to be beyond com- 1
pare with the former Proms.
One section of the Inner Quadrangle
has been chosen by the Committee for

the scene of the festivities and it is
there that they will concentrate their
effors to make his a well remembered
function. Part of this space has been
inclosed with five booths and the Sen
iors who are working upon completing
arrangements, contemplate finishing
the erection of booths and this part of
the Quad with an elaborate outlay of
decorations and additional attractions.
Music is to be furnished by a special
military band that has been secured
for the occasion by the Senior board
having charge of this event. Tbis will
consist of a full band and will Include
twenty pieces in its composition.
Music will be furnished throughout
the evening from the band's position
in the center of the inner court.
Programs have been printed for the
Prom and may be secured tonight at
the Law steps for the sum of fifteen
cents each. This charge has been
made by the Committee to enable them
to meet the few incidental expenses
that have to be incurred.
