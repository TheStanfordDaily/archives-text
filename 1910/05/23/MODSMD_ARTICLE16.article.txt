# SOCIAL FUNCTION WILL MARK END OF COMMENCEMENT WEEK
## 
### 
Returning to the old custom of
rounding off the Senior Week festivi
ties with the Senior ball in San Jose,
the Class of 1910 will gather for the
last time at the Hotel Vendome on
Tuesday night. The magnificent ball
room and the beautiful grounds of the
big resort will be the scene of the live
liest and most enjoyable assemblage
that has ever been given under the
name of the Senior Class.
The hotel management is endeavor
ing to make the affair the biggest suc
cess of their many undertakings and
the dancers will receive some startl
ing surprises during the evening. The
grounds around the Vendome lend
themselves to a function of this sort
and probably there will be as many
promenaders as dancers.
The programs are a decided innova
tion and speak well for the ingenuity
of the committee. With covers of white

leather and lettering of gold, they
carry out. the promise of the class that
this ball would be the "best ever."
The dancers will be transported to the
scene of action on the electric rail
road. Arrangements have been made
whereby a train will leave the Univer
sity Bookstore on Tuesday evening at.
6:30. As the cost of a dance ticket
also includes transportation to and
from San Jose, it behooves everyone
to catch these cars as their tickets
will be honored at no other time. No
time has been set for the return trip,
but it will probably be between mid
night and dawn on Wednesday.
J. P. Levy, '10, will dispense the pro
grams and railway tickets in room
151, Encina, between 10:15 and 12:15
o'clock, Wednesday.
This, the farewell of 1910 to college
affairs, is sure to be unsurpassed, so
no one should miss the chance
