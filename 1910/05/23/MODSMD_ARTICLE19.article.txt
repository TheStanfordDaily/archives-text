Endeavoring to maintain the class
spirit that existed in college, the
classes, or more properly, integral
parts of the same, gathered on Satur
day evening to again renew old ac
quaintanceships and to participate in
a class reunion. It is hoped by the
various promoters of this movement
that these reunions will continue an
nually and that every Commencement,
will see the meetings of members of
the various classes.
1895, 1900, 1905, and 1908 were ac
tively represented by members of these
different classes.
