# Seniors Gather in University Chapel to Hold 1910 Class Day
## Customary Exercises Held by Graduating Class to Formally End the Under, graduate Career of that Student Body Organization. Class History and Will are Read. 
### 
Many Seniors gathered in the Uni
versity Chapel last Friday morning in
the last meeting that the Class of 1910
will hold as an organization of under
graduates. The program for the morn
ing consisted in the usual reading of
the class documents, including the his
tory, the will and an informal talk by
Class President L. S. Scott.
President Scott spoke first to his
classmates in the following manner:
"Dr. Jordan and Fellow Classmen: —
Class spirit should be felt at its high
est during this space of time when we
meet lastly as an organized body of a
student body.
Four years we have been carrying
along the fortunes of 1910 in various
activities. Dramatics, athletics, for
ensics, the social life, and various
other forms of activities outside of the
usual pursuit of knowledge have
bound us together as a unit.
Friendships have been made out of
these activities which will be highly
valued throughout life. In return we
should give something to our Alma
Mater which has made possible all
these things. No higher or nobler
aim could be set before every alumnus
for repaying this institution for these
priviliges it has afforded us than the
advancement of the University. An
active interest now and then is what
is due from every graduate member of
the Class of 1910.
Our class has had a magnificent
history during the past 4 years and I
sincerely hope that every name upon
its role will be just as successful in
the future."
W. P. Fuller, Jr. Reads History.
"W. P. Fuller, Jr., next read the
following class history;
Mr.President, Classmates and Friends:
Some four years ago a curious ag
gregation of erstwhile high school
students, leaving the paternal roof
and the maternal apron string that
they might pursue wisdom with the
more seriousness, came nuto Stanford.
The remnants of that same curious
aggregation (remnants —for stormy
has been the voyage) are now confi
dently awaiting the end, having pur
sued the aforementioned wisdom with
the requisite vigor. Put they leave
Stanford only after endeavoring to
serve the University as every true
son should serve his Alma Mater. The
men and women of 1910 have done
their duty as members of the Univer
sity and of the Student Body; and this
in spite of many discouraging condi
tions which have confronted them
spasmodically in the past four years.
Nineteen Ten early presaged a spirit
of strength and ingenuity, two at
tributes which have ever marked the
achievements of the Class. From the
moment of the adoption of a Freshman
cap to the formation of an entirely
new arrangement of Commencement
week events, the present Seniors have
constantly changed, modified and bet

tered previously existing conditions
which failed to suit them.
As Freshmen, Nineteen Ten were
successful from the Intercollegiate
point of view only in the regatta, but
her men were at work in every field
of activity, laying that solid basis
which in the future was to give the
class such decided pre-eminence.
It was in our Sophomore year that
the star of Nineteen Ten began to
shine with ominous brightness. The
Class fifteen won the first of its three
Rugby championships, and we are
prone to believe that only the ab
sense of an interclass series in 1906
prevented Nineteen Ten from record
ing a fourth victory. By the end of
1907 four members of the Class had
already earned Varsity "S's" in foot
ball; they were the future Rugby cap
tain, Mitchell; the future baseball cap
tain, Ganong; the future crew captain,
Reynolds; and the future All-Ameri
can player, Louis Cheda. Since then
the football "S" has been given to
Fitting, Cook, Faulkner, and our all
round wonder, Scott. As much to
these men as to any does Stanford owe
her three Varsity football victories dur
ing the life of Rugby and of Nineteen
Ten.
On the track, the four-time point
winners, Scott and Poor, with Captain
elect Rellah and Reed, Martin, Hel*-
ley and Shelton, have joined forces
with the other classes to make three
out of the last four track meets glor
ious events for the Cardinal. Scott,
Bellah, Martin and Maundrell have
won points for Stanford at meets of
the "Western Conference Association.
Nineteen Ten may boast of such for
midable Varsity ball-tossers as Mitch
ell, Ganong, Reed, Scott, Gore, Coch
ran and the slugging McFadden, while
Reynolds, Patrick, Huston, Malone,
Benson, Vose, Wilde, Fitting and Rob
erts championed the Class on the 1
water.
Our tennis cracks have been Henry,
Mann and Jordan.
Tn these five branches of sport. Nine
teen Ten is fortunate enough to claim ,
ten Varsity captains: Mitchell in foot
ball; Scott and Bellah in track; Can- j
ong and Reed in baseball; Reynolds, j
Patrick and TJuston in boating; and j
Mann and Henry in tennis. Such a'
record is unprecedented.
.Tust as Nineteen Seven had their |
Presley, Nineteen Eight their Fenton,
1900 their Crawford, so have Nineteen
Ten their Scott. But Leland Stanford
Scott is famed in three branches of
athletics and boasts a world's record,
while but two sports attracted either
of the three former heroes. Scott is
the most versatile of all Stanford ath
letes.
Nineteen Ten have accomplished
just hs much in non-athletic activities.
We have had more editors than other
classes with Hails, Adams, TJndauer,
Leaf, Fisk, Fuller and Morgan. We
have the best debater of this and many
other college generations, .T. Errett

Shelton, ably seconded by Batkin and
Morgan. We have more people prom
inent in dramatics than any previous
class, for Nineteen Ten claims the
former Miss Ozier, Miss Howell, Miss
Wright, De Bolt, Pettigrew, Thompson,
Fuller, Mnnier and, to again repeat,
Morgan. Without hesitation we say
that she whom we all know as Miss
Ozier is the most accomplished ama
teur actress ever enrolled at Stanford.
Erhorn, De Bolt and Happy, as yell
leaders, have maintained the reputa
tion of the Class. That we are able to
conduct our Senior Week with the pay
ment of merely a nominal assessment
is due only to the frenzied machina
tions of as interested a worker as a
class could ever possess, Herman Rit
tigstein. In every field the men of
Nineteen Ten are to be found actively
and creditably engaged.
And likewise the women ! Besides
those mentioned in connection with
dramatics, the Misses James, Metzner,
Park, Bundy, Hayward and Palmer
have each done far more than her
share.
Nineteen Ten has been in the front
of happenings unusual as well as us
ual. The 1908 Peerade found many
Sophomores in its midst, as did the
various documents soon after issued
by the Commttee on Student Affairs.
Nineteen Ten introduced the first sen
sible system of Quad control. We gave
the greatest and last of the great Plug
Uglies, and until reading the 1911
Quad, we were of the impression that
success bad been ours in the Plug
Ugly of this year. We must have been
in error, however, for in that book we
are told that "never once did the
Juniors stop until they had put out
everybody, even to the lights on the
Quad." We apologize for our mis
taken belief. Nineteen Ten have also
seen the beginnings of the Stanford
Union and have aided materially in
the cause.
Hut perhaps the field in which our
superiority is the most wonderful and
unique has not as yet been mentioned.
So attractive are the maids of Nine
teen Ten that numberless stern men
have forsaken possibly three square
meals a day, as well ps bachelordoru,
in order to avoid all risk of loss. Mat
rimonially, we can have no rival.
During our last few months unfor
tunate dissension has spread among
us. It has served, however, only to
emphasize the strength and force of
our leaders. That the trouble unjustly
took from Nineteen Ten one of her
finest sons is the saddest fact which
we have to record.
Yet despite peerades, Plugs and pol
itics a goodly number of us have sur
vived. We look upon a Stanford diff
erent from that which we saw upon
our entrance: different because of
che way in which we view it; different
in and of itself. Perhaps our ideas
are not one as to which is the better.
Yet when all is done, both will be
good to look back upon.

S. A. Linda nor Gives Oration.
Upon the conclusion of services
in the Chapel, the 1910 plate was dedi
cated in the Inner Quadrangle with
appropriate services. S. A. Lindauer
delivered the Class Oration at this
time and in the course of his speech
said :
"Dr. Jordan, Classmates and Friends :
With a purpose similar to that of
fifteen preceding classes, we gather
here today, under the maternal shad
ows of the Memorial Church, to dedi
cate the class plate. And, as was the
case with our predecessors, the count
less pleasant memories which crowd
our minds are saddened only by the
realization that as a class we must
henceforth be widely scattered in our
chosen fields of endeavor. In laying
this plate the Class of 1910 is perform
ing its last official function as a uni
versity entity. It is awarding the cov
eted class numerals for the last time.
Not, it is true, to those doughty sons
who have successfully upheld the su
premacy of 1910 on field and rostrum,
not to athletes or debators, but rather
to the most faithful servant of all —to
our Alma Mater. Of the four years
that we have spent under her tutelage
we may truly say that "our lines have
fallen in pleasant places." We have
in that period resided within the en
chanted confines of the "red-tiled prin
cipality," oblivious to the cares and ex
acting conventions of the outside
world. In this most democratic of all
democratic amtospheres we have dwelt
as fellow students, imbibing zealously
the Stanford Spirit and drinking deep
of Stanford ideals. More or less per
sistently, as the case may be, we have
penetrated the vast storehouse of
knowledge which these expansive
monuments of Spanish architecture
concretely represent. We have en
joyed to the utmost the pleasures of
student life. Thrice have we seen vic
tory perch 011 Cardinal banners in
football in track, in crew and in Car
not contests; twice have we seen base
ball series emblazoned in Cardinal
hue. And our pride in these successes
Avas accentuated by the share our
classmates played in their attainment.
Tt has, indeed, been a rare privilege
to bask in the sunshine of Stanford
life with all that this implies. The
California skies, the hills, the lake,
the fields, the breath of the free out
doors, all conspire to make student
life here in the glorious Santa Clara
Valley a peerless heritage. And the
glow of good fellowship, the sincere
spirit of friendship, the deep seated
democracy—where else can these be
found as they exist with us at Stan
ford ?
And now, my classmates, this func
tion signalizes the culmination of our
college existence. Varied explana
tions have been worked out by my
forerunners as to the meaning of the
ceremony. To me there is little room
for doubt as to its true interpretation.
It provides a lofty eminence from
which we can soberly gaze in retro
spect upon the four years now draw
ing to a close. More than that, it af
fords a common starting point from
which all 1910 men and women may
begin their worldly careers with com
mon ideals, where hopes and aspira
tions to live clean, practical lives are
still unsullied by the sordid experi
ences of the larger world. Here and
now we must raise high our ambitions
to be unselfishly useful to our fellows.
Here and now we must strengthen our
purpose to actively perpetuate the
immortal principles upon which our
democracy rests.
Concerning the past I feel safe in
saying that we have left a favorable
impress upon Stanford life. Can we
do as well in the future ? What will
be the character of our influence on
American life? Shall we, standing
here today with heads held high and
consciences uncorrupted by the al
luring temptations of tomorrow, con
tinue to hold heads high and to main
tain consciences uncorrupted? Or,
as so many others have done before,
shall we lose these Cardinal Stanford
attributes in the mad rush for material
prosperity? However we may answer
these queires, this little coppe'r tablet
at our feet is placed here today as an
eternal reminder of the part that the
members of 1910 have played, in col
lege and out, in the world's progress.
Let us see to it that it symbolizes ser
vice to humanity.
And before embarking on our life's
work it is well that we should pause
for a moment to consider the duty of
college graduates in American life in
the light of the training which they
have received. For four years we
have devoted ourselves to the acquisi
tion of an education. But how useless
is the possession of mere knowledge
unless it is employed as a virile and
positive force upon the side of right,
truth and a progressive civilization.
And I believe that we of 1910 can jus
tify our education only by pointing the
way in the great struggle now going
on, a struggle that dates from the
dawn of history, a struggle that must
ultimately termirate in the triumph of
Utopian ideals. Tiie battle for human
equality and liberty is ceaseless, and
it devolves upon us as college men and
women to unite ourselves upon the
progressive side. Equality before the
law is the battle cry of our day. We
Americans are just beginning to real
ize that bad laws in the hands of good
men are preferable to good laws in the
hands of bad men. Men, not meas
ures, is our need. The historic fight
of the "Insurgents" in our degenerate
national legislature, seemingly hope
less a few shorts months ago, yet to
day fast assuming the proportions of
a stampede towards a regenerated
body politic; the commentaries of Col
orado's famous juvenile judge; the
relentless crusade of the "National
Weekly" and other unbought journals;
the temporarily unappreciated efforts
of San Francisco's irrepressible prose
cutor, greater than ever in defeat; the
uncompromising non-partizan attitude
of Roosevelt, Bryan, La Follette and
other great leaders of the day; all
these are but evidences of an awak
ened public conscience, of the great
struggle now being waged, largely by
college men, in a mighty effort to free
the nation from the clutches of or
ganized greed. Just as the Revolu
tionary and Civil Wars were but re
curring instances of the never ending
struggle for just and human living
conditions, so is this but another com

pelling instance. It differs only in
this, that it is a mental liberation. In
the words of Dr. Scherer: "Roose
velt of Harvard is there, Pinchot of
Yale is there and, paraphrasing slight
ly, there is room for 1910 of Stanford
beside them!"
I have just said that college men are
foremost in this great movement. Yet,
truth compels a supplementary state
ment: college men are likewise the
leaders of the vicious opposition. Per
haps, Judge Llndsey's assertion that
"the universities are turning out more
criminals than the prisons" is not
literally true. Still, the actual con
dition is one which 1910 should do its
share in eradicating. And in urging
j you to this task, I do not mean to min
j imize its difficulties. The scorn of the
I smug gentleman in broadcloth, the
ridicule of the subsidized press, os
tracism from the higher circles of so
ciety and clubdom, poverty, oblivion,
yes, even assassination may be your
reward. Heney's and Lindsey's re
ward has come in this wise. The
world is alive with bullies, physical
and mental. If mental browbeating, if
inspired verbal onslaughts, do not curb
the expressions of honest opinions, the
genteel bully of today will scarcely
hesitate at personal violence. But,
will we college men and women cower
before such obstacles, will we accept
defeat at the hands of the "Beast,"
when the future of the nation lies at
stake? I think not. Vain should be
the labor of those who seek to deter
1910 men from this duty. Certainly,
when the slogan "it hurts business"
supplants "it hurts the nation," when
Woodrow Wilson and Judge Lindsev
charge the churches with becoming the
haven of the despoilers of our national
birthright, when the all powerful press
becomes the mouthpiece of special
privilege, and when even the universi
ties turn from the people to their op
pressors for support, there is work
for you and me to do. Surely the
election of McCarthy—a standing men
ace to the future of San Francisco, and
a disgrace to American politics—to
gether with the removal of Pinchot,
are clarion blasts that call the college
man to action on behalf of higher
standards of life in city, instate and in
nation. The church, the school and
the press should be the greatest mod
ern factors in the attainment of true
democracy, and they can best be re
turned to the side of decency by a
trained patriotic leadership of college
men. Shall we shirk the responsibil
ity ? Accepting it, we can continue to
hold our heads high and keep our
consciences clear. We can then ignore
the slurs and slanders of petty people
on the realization that we have done
our duty to university and country.
In the words of the great emancipator:
"Let us have faith that right makes
might, and in that faith, let us, to the
end, dare to do our duty as we under
stand it.'
Thus beholding the opportunity, let
us seize it. By the time the chain of
claws plates reaches yonder corner,
most of us will have performed our
work on earth, for better or for worse.
Let us hope that the record of our
work will cause the graduates of that
distant day no regret, that no single
failure shall mar the record of the
class of 1910, that the class roll, which
in a few moments is to be sealed be
neath the pavement, will be an un
broken roll of honor. So today, proud
of the past and sanguine of the future,
as spokesman of 1910, I commit to
Stanford this lasting token of our ap
preciation and cooperative pledge of
fealty to the principles of democracy
taught at her shrine."
Many Seniors gathered in the Uni
versity Chapel last Friday morning in
the last meeting that the Class of 1910
will hold as an organization of under

ing consisted in the usual reading of
the class documents, including the his

"W. P. Fuller, Jr., next read the

college graduates in American life in
the light of the training which they
have received. For four years we
have devoted ourselves to the acquisi
tion of an education. But how useless
is the possession of mere knowledge
unless it is employed as a virile and
positive force upon the side of right,
truth and a progressive civilization.
And I believe that we of 1910 can jus
tify our education only by pointing the
way in the great struggle now going
on, a struggle that dates from the
dawn of history, a struggle that must
ultimately termirate in the triumph of
Utopian ideals. Tiie battle for human
equality and liberty is ceaseless, and
it devolves upon us as college men and
women to unite ourselves upon the
progressive side. Equality before the
law is the battle cry of our day. We
Americans are just beginning to real
ize that bad laws in the hands of good
men are preferable to good laws in the
hands of bad men. Men, not meas
ures, is our need. The historic fight
of the "Insurgents" in our degenerate
national legislature, seemingly hope
less a few shorts months ago, yet to
day fast assuming the proportions of
a stampede towards a regenerated
body politic; the commentaries of Col
orado's famous juvenile judge; the
relentless crusade of the "National
Weekly" and other unbought journals;
the temporarily unappreciated efforts
of San Francisco's irrepressible prose
cutor, greater than ever in defeat; the
uncompromising non-partizan attitude
of Roosevelt, Bryan, La Follette and
other great leaders of the day; all
these are but evidences of an awak
ened public conscience, of the great
struggle now being waged, largely by
college men, in a mighty effort to free
the nation from the clutches of or
ganized greed. Just as the Revolu
tionary and Civil Wars were but re
curring instances of the never ending
struggle for just and human living
conditions, so is this but another com

pelling instance. It differs only in
this, that it is a mental liberation. In
the words of Dr. Scherer: "Roose
velt of Harvard is there, Pinchot of
Yale is there and, paraphrasing slight
ly, there is room for 1910 of Stanford
beside them!"
I have just said that college men are
foremost in this great movement. Yet,
truth compels a supplementary state
ment: college men are likewise the
leaders of the vicious opposition. Per
haps, Judge Llndsey's assertion that
"the universities are turning out more
criminals than the prisons" is not
literally true. Still, the actual con
dition is one which 1910 should do its
share in eradicating. And in urging
j you to this task, I do not mean to min
j imize its difficulties. The scorn of the
I smug gentleman in broadcloth, the
ridicule of the subsidized press, os
tracism from the higher circles of so
ciety and clubdom, poverty, oblivion,
yes, even assassination may be your
reward. Heney's and Lindsey's re
ward has come in this wise. The
world is alive with bullies, physical
and mental. If mental browbeating, if
inspired verbal onslaughts, do not curb
the expressions of honest opinions, the
genteel bully of today will scarcely
hesitate at personal violence. But,
will we college men and women cower
before such obstacles, will we accept
defeat at the hands of the "Beast,"
when the future of the nation lies at
stake? I think not. Vain should be
the labor of those who seek to deter
1910 men from this duty. Certainly,
when the slogan "it hurts business"
supplants "it hurts the nation," when
Woodrow Wilson and Judge Lindsev
charge the churches with becoming the
haven of the despoilers of our national
birthright, when the all powerful press
becomes the mouthpiece of special
privilege, and when even the universi
ties turn from the people to their op
pressors for support, there is work
for you and me to do. Surely the
election of McCarthy—a standing men
ace to the future of San Francisco, and
a disgrace to American politics—to
gether with the removal of Pinchot,
are clarion blasts that call the college
man to action on behalf of higher
standards of life in city, instate and in
nation. The church, the school and
the press should be the greatest mod
ern factors in the attainment of true
democracy, and they can best be re
turned to the side of decency by a
trained patriotic leadership of college
men. Shall we shirk the responsibil
ity ? Accepting it, we can continue to
hold our heads high and keep our
consciences clear. We can then ignore
the slurs and slanders of petty people
on the realization that we have done
our duty to university and country.
In the words of the great emancipator:
"Let us have faith that right makes
might, and in that faith, let us, to the
end, dare to do our duty as we under
stand it.'
Thus beholding the opportunity, let
us seize it. By the time the chain of
claws plates reaches yonder corner,
most of us will have performed our
work on earth, for better or for worse.
Let us hope that the record of our
work will cause the graduates of that
distant day no regret, that no single
failure shall mar the record of the
class of 1910, that the class roll, which
in a few moments is to be sealed be
neath the pavement, will be an un
broken roll of honor. So today, proud
of the past and sanguine of the future,
as spokesman of 1910, I commit to
Stanford this lasting token of our ap
preciation and cooperative pledge of
fealty to the principles of democracy
taught at her shrine."
Many Seniors gathered in the Uni
versity Chapel last Friday morning in
the last meeting that the Class of 1910
will hold as an organization of under
graduates. The program for the morn
ing consisted in the usual reading of
the class documents, including the his
tory, the will and an informal talk by
Class President L. S. Scott.
President Scott spoke first to his
classmates in the following manner:
"Dr. Jordan and Fellow Classmen: —
Class spirit should be felt at its high
est during this space of time when we
meet lastly as an organized body of a
student body.
Four years we have been carrying
along the fortunes of 1910 in various
activities. Dramatics, athletics, for
ensics, the social life, and various
other forms of activities outside of the
usual pursuit of knowledge have
bound us together as a unit.
Friendships have been made out of
these activities which will be highly
valued throughout life. In return we
should give something to our Alma
Mater which has made possible all
these things. No higher or nobler
aim could be set before every alumnus
for repaying this institution for these
priviliges it has afforded us than the
advancement of the University. An
active interest now and then is what
is due from every graduate member of
the Class of 1910.
Our class has had a magnificent
history during the past 4 years and I
sincerely hope that every name upon
its role will be just as successful in
the future."
W. P. Fuller, Jr. Reads History.
"W. P. Fuller, Jr., next read the
following class history;
Mr.President, Classmates and Friends:
Some four years ago a curious ag
gregation of erstwhile high school
students, leaving the paternal roof
and the maternal apron string that
they might pursue wisdom with the
more seriousness, came nuto Stanford.
The remnants of that same curious
aggregation (remnants —for stormy
has been the voyage) are now confi
dently awaiting the end, having pur
sued the aforementioned wisdom with
the requisite vigor. Put they leave
Stanford only after endeavoring to
serve the University as every true
son should serve his Alma Mater. The
men and women of 1910 have done
their duty as members of the Univer
sity and of the Student Body; and this
in spite of many discouraging condi
tions which have confronted them
spasmodically in the past four years.
Nineteen Ten early presaged a spirit
of strength and ingenuity, two at
tributes which have ever marked the
achievements of the Class. From the
moment of the adoption of a Freshman
cap to the formation of an entirely
new arrangement of Commencement
week events, the present Seniors have
constantly changed, modified and bet

tered previously existing conditions
which failed to suit them.
As Freshmen, Nineteen Ten were
successful from the Intercollegiate
point of view only in the regatta, but
her men were at work in every field
of activity, laying that solid basis
which in the future was to give the
class such decided pre-eminence.
It was in our Sophomore year that
the star of Nineteen Ten began to
shine with ominous brightness. The
Class fifteen won the first of its three
Rugby championships, and we are
prone to believe that only the ab
sense of an interclass series in 1906
prevented Nineteen Ten from record
ing a fourth victory. By the end of
1907 four members of the Class had
already earned Varsity "S's" in foot
ball; they were the future Rugby cap
tain, Mitchell; the future baseball cap
tain, Ganong; the future crew captain,
Reynolds; and the future All-Ameri
can player, Louis Cheda. Since then
the football "S" has been given to
Fitting, Cook, Faulkner, and our all
round wonder, Scott. As much to
these men as to any does Stanford owe
her three Varsity football victories dur
ing the life of Rugby and of Nineteen
Ten.
On the track, the four-time point
winners, Scott and Poor, with Captain
elect Rellah and Reed, Martin, Hel*-
ley and Shelton, have joined forces
with the other classes to make three
out of the last four track meets glor
ious events for the Cardinal. Scott,
Bellah, Martin and Maundrell have
won points for Stanford at meets of
the "Western Conference Association.
Nineteen Ten may boast of such for
midable Varsity ball-tossers as Mitch
ell, Ganong, Reed, Scott, Gore, Coch
ran and the slugging McFadden, while
Reynolds, Patrick, Huston, Malone,
Benson, Vose, Wilde, Fitting and Rob
erts championed the Class on the 1
water.
Our tennis cracks have been Henry,
Mann and Jordan.
Tn these five branches of sport. Nine
teen Ten is fortunate enough to claim ,
ten Varsity captains: Mitchell in foot
ball; Scott and Bellah in track; Can- j
ong and Reed in baseball; Reynolds, j
Patrick and TJuston in boating; and j
Mann and Henry in tennis. Such a'
record is unprecedented.
.Tust as Nineteen Seven had their |
Presley, Nineteen Eight their Fenton,
1900 their Crawford, so have Nineteen
Ten their Scott. But Leland Stanford
Scott is famed in three branches of
athletics and boasts a world's record,
while but two sports attracted either
of the three former heroes. Scott is
the most versatile of all Stanford ath
letes.
Nineteen Ten have accomplished
just hs much in non-athletic activities.
We have had more editors than other
classes with Hails, Adams, TJndauer,
Leaf, Fisk, Fuller and Morgan. We
have the best debater of this and many
other college generations, .T. Errett

Shelton, ably seconded by Batkin and
Morgan. We have more people prom
inent in dramatics than any previous
class, for Nineteen Ten claims the
former Miss Ozier, Miss Howell, Miss
Wright, De Bolt, Pettigrew, Thompson,
Fuller, Mnnier and, to again repeat,
Morgan. Without hesitation we say
that she whom we all know as Miss
Ozier is the most accomplished ama
teur actress ever enrolled at Stanford.
Erhorn, De Bolt and Happy, as yell
leaders, have maintained the reputa
tion of the Class. That we are able to
conduct our Senior Week with the pay
ment of merely a nominal assessment
is due only to the frenzied machina
tions of as interested a worker as a
class could ever possess, Herman Rit
tigstein. In every field the men of
Nineteen Ten are to be found actively
and creditably engaged.
And likewise the women ! Besides
those mentioned in connection with
dramatics, the Misses James, Metzner,
Park, Bundy, Hayward and Palmer
have each done far more than her
share.
Nineteen Ten has been in the front
of happenings unusual as well as us
ual. The 1908 Peerade found many
Sophomores in its midst, as did the
various documents soon after issued
by the Commttee on Student Affairs.
Nineteen Ten introduced the first sen
sible system of Quad control. We gave
the greatest and last of the great Plug
Uglies, and until reading the 1911
Quad, we were of the impression that
success bad been ours in the Plug
Ugly of this year. We must have been
in error, however, for in that book we
are told that "never once did the
Juniors stop until they had put out
everybody, even to the lights on the
Quad." We apologize for our mis
taken belief. Nineteen Ten have also
seen the beginnings of the Stanford
Union and have aided materially in
the cause.
Hut perhaps the field in which our
superiority is the most wonderful and
unique has not as yet been mentioned.
So attractive are the maids of Nine
teen Ten that numberless stern men
have forsaken possibly three square
meals a day, as well ps bachelordoru,
in order to avoid all risk of loss. Mat
rimonially, we can have no rival.
During our last few months unfor
tunate dissension has spread among
us. It has served, however, only to
emphasize the strength and force of
our leaders. That the trouble unjustly
took from Nineteen Ten one of her
finest sons is the saddest fact which
we have to record.
Yet despite peerades, Plugs and pol
itics a goodly number of us have sur
vived. We look upon a Stanford diff
erent from that which we saw upon
our entrance: different because of
che way in which we view it; different
in and of itself. Perhaps our ideas
are not one as to which is the better.
Yet when all is done, both will be
good to look back upon.

S. A. Linda nor Gives Oration.
Upon the conclusion of services
in the Chapel, the 1910 plate was dedi
cated in the Inner Quadrangle with
appropriate services. S. A. Lindauer
delivered the Class Oration at this
time and in the course of his speech
said :
"Dr. Jordan, Classmates and Friends :
With a purpose similar to that of
fifteen preceding classes, we gather
here today, under the maternal shad
ows of the Memorial Church, to dedi
cate the class plate. And, as was the
case with our predecessors, the count
less pleasant memories which crowd
our minds are saddened only by the
realization that as a class we must
henceforth be widely scattered in our
chosen fields of endeavor. In laying
this plate the Class of 1910 is perform
ing its last official function as a uni
versity entity. It is awarding the cov
eted class numerals for the last time.
Not, it is true, to those doughty sons
who have successfully upheld the su
premacy of 1910 on field and rostrum,
not to athletes or debators, but rather
to the most faithful servant of all —to
our Alma Mater. Of the four years
that we have spent under her tutelage
we may truly say that "our lines have
fallen in pleasant places." We have
in that period resided within the en
chanted confines of the "red-tiled prin
cipality," oblivious to the cares and ex
acting conventions of the outside
world. In this most democratic of all
democratic amtospheres we have dwelt
as fellow students, imbibing zealously
the Stanford Spirit and drinking deep
of Stanford ideals. More or less per
sistently, as the case may be, we have
penetrated the vast storehouse of
knowledge which these expansive
monuments of Spanish architecture
concretely represent. We have en
joyed to the utmost the pleasures of
student life. Thrice have we seen vic
tory perch 011 Cardinal banners in
football in track, in crew and in Car
not contests; twice have we seen base
ball series emblazoned in Cardinal
hue. And our pride in these successes
Avas accentuated by the share our
classmates played in their attainment.
Tt has, indeed, been a rare privilege
to bask in the sunshine of Stanford
life with all that this implies. The
California skies, the hills, the lake,
the fields, the breath of the free out
doors, all conspire to make student
life here in the glorious Santa Clara
Valley a peerless heritage. And the
glow of good fellowship, the sincere
spirit of friendship, the deep seated
democracy—where else can these be
found as they exist with us at Stan
ford ?
And now, my classmates, this func
tion signalizes the culmination of our
college existence. Varied explana
tions have been worked out by my
forerunners as to the meaning of the
ceremony. To me there is little room
for doubt as to its true interpretation.
It provides a lofty eminence from
which we can soberly gaze in retro
spect upon the four years now draw
ing to a close. More than that, it af
fords a common starting point from
which all 1910 men and women may
begin their worldly careers with com
mon ideals, where hopes and aspira
tions to live clean, practical lives are
still unsullied by the sordid experi
ences of the larger world. Here and
now we must raise high our ambitions
to be unselfishly useful to our fellows.
Here and now we must strengthen our
purpose to actively perpetuate the
immortal principles upon which our
democracy rests.
Concerning the past I feel safe in
saying that we have left a favorable
impress upon Stanford life. Can we
do as well in the future ? What will
be the character of our influence on
American life? Shall we, standing
here today with heads held high and
consciences uncorrupted by the al
luring temptations of tomorrow, con
tinue to hold heads high and to main
tain consciences uncorrupted? Or,
as so many others have done before,
shall we lose these Cardinal Stanford
attributes in the mad rush for material
prosperity? However we may answer
these queires, this little coppe'r tablet
at our feet is placed here today as an
eternal reminder of the part that the
members of 1910 have played, in col
lege and out, in the world's progress.
Let us see to it that it symbolizes ser
vice to humanity.
And before embarking on our life's
work it is well that we should pause
for a moment to consider the duty of
college graduates in American life in
the light of the training which they
have received. For four years we
have devoted ourselves to the acquisi
tion of an education. But how useless
is the possession of mere knowledge
unless it is employed as a virile and
positive force upon the side of right,
truth and a progressive civilization.
And I believe that we of 1910 can jus
tify our education only by pointing the
way in the great struggle now going
on, a struggle that dates from the
dawn of history, a struggle that must
ultimately termirate in the triumph of
Utopian ideals. Tiie battle for human
equality and liberty is ceaseless, and
it devolves upon us as college men and
women to unite ourselves upon the
progressive side. Equality before the
law is the battle cry of our day. We
Americans are just beginning to real
ize that bad laws in the hands of good
men are preferable to good laws in the
hands of bad men. Men, not meas
ures, is our need. The historic fight
of the "Insurgents" in our degenerate
national legislature, seemingly hope
less a few shorts months ago, yet to
day fast assuming the proportions of
a stampede towards a regenerated
body politic; the commentaries of Col

these are but evidences of an awak

"W. P. Fuller, Jr., next read the
following class history;
Mr.President, Classmates and Friends:

seen the beginnings of the Stanford
Union and have aided materially in
the cause.
Hut perhaps the field in which our
superiority is the most wonderful and
unique has not as yet been mentioned.
So attractive are the maids of Nine
teen Ten that numberless stern men
have forsaken possibly three square
meals a day, as well ps bachelordoru,
in order to avoid all risk of loss. Mat
rimonially, we can have no rival.
During our last few months unfor
tunate dissension has spread among
us. It has served, however, only to
emphasize the strength and force of
our leaders. That the trouble unjustly
took from Nineteen Ten one of her
finest sons is the saddest fact which
we have to record.
Yet despite peerades, Plugs and pol
itics a goodly number of us have sur
vived. We look upon a Stanford diff
erent from that which we saw upon
our entrance: different because of
che way in which we view it; different
in and of itself. Perhaps our ideas
are not one as to which is the better.
Yet when all is done, both will be
good to look back upon.

S. A. Linda nor Gives Oration.
Upon the conclusion of services
in the Chapel, the 1910 plate was dedi
cated in the Inner Quadrangle with
appropriate services. S. A. Lindauer
delivered the Class Oration at this
time and in the course of his speech
said :
"Dr. Jordan, Classmates and Friends :
With a purpose similar to that of
fifteen preceding classes, we gather
here today, under the maternal shad
ows of the Memorial Church, to dedi
cate the class plate. And, as was the
case with our predecessors, the count
less pleasant memories which crowd
our minds are saddened only by the
realization that as a class we must
henceforth be widely scattered in our
chosen fields of endeavor. In laying
this plate the Class of 1910 is perform
ing its last official function as a uni
versity entity. It is awarding the cov
eted class numerals for the last time.
Not, it is true, to those doughty sons
who have successfully upheld the su
premacy of 1910 on field and rostrum,
not to athletes or debators, but rather
to the most faithful servant of all —to
our Alma Mater. Of the four years
that we have spent under her tutelage
we may truly say that "our lines have
fallen in pleasant places." We have
in that period resided within the en
chanted confines of the "red-tiled prin
cipality," oblivious to the cares and ex
acting conventions of the outside
world. In this most democratic of all
democratic amtospheres we have dwelt
as fellow students, imbibing zealously
the Stanford Spirit and drinking deep
of Stanford ideals. More or less per
sistently, as the case may be, we have
penetrated the vast storehouse of
knowledge which these expansive
monuments of Spanish architecture
concretely represent. We have en
joyed to the utmost the pleasures of
student life. Thrice have we seen vic
tory perch 011 Cardinal banners in
football in track, in crew and in Car
not contests; twice have we seen base
ball series emblazoned in Cardinal
hue. And our pride in these successes
Avas accentuated by the share our
classmates played in their attainment.
Tt has, indeed, been a rare privilege
to bask in the sunshine of Stanford
life with all that this implies. The
California skies, the hills, the lake,
the fields, the breath of the free out
doors, all conspire to make student
life here in the glorious Santa Clara
Valley a peerless heritage. And the
glow of good fellowship, the sincere
spirit of friendship, the deep seated
democracy—where else can these be
found as they exist with us at Stan
ford ?
And now, my classmates, this func
tion signalizes the culmination of our
college existence. Varied explana
tions have been worked out by my
forerunners as to the meaning of the
ceremony. To me there is little room
for doubt as to its true interpretation.
It provides a lofty eminence from
which we can soberly gaze in retro
spect upon the four years now draw
ing to a close. More than that, it af
fords a common starting point from
which all 1910 men and women may
begin their worldly careers with com
mon ideals, where hopes and aspira
tions to live clean, practical lives are
still unsullied by the sordid experi
ences of the larger world. Here and
now we must raise high our ambitions
to be unselfishly useful to our fellows.
Here and now we must strengthen our
purpose to actively perpetuate the
immortal principles upon which our
democracy rests.
Concerning the past I feel safe in
saying that we have left a favorable
impress upon Stanford life. Can we
do as well in the future ? What will
be the character of our influence on
American life? Shall we, standing
here today with heads held high and
consciences uncorrupted by the al
luring temptations of tomorrow, con
tinue to hold heads high and to main
tain consciences uncorrupted? Or,
as so many others have done before,
shall we lose these Cardinal Stanford
attributes in the mad rush for material
prosperity? However we may answer
these queires, this little coppe'r tablet
at our feet is placed here today as an
eternal reminder of the part that the
members of 1910 have played, in col
lege and out, in the world's progress.
Let us see to it that it symbolizes ser
vice to humanity.
And before embarking on our life's
work it is well that we should pause
for a moment to consider the duty of
college graduates in American life in
the light of the training which they
have received. For four years we
have devoted ourselves to the acquisi
tion of an education. But how useless
is the possession of mere knowledge
unless it is employed as a virile and
positive force upon the side of right,
truth and a progressive civilization.
And I believe that we of 1910 can jus
tify our education only by pointing the
way in the great struggle now going
on, a struggle that dates from the
dawn of history, a struggle that must
ultimately termirate in the triumph of
Utopian ideals. Tiie battle for human
equality and liberty is ceaseless, and
it devolves upon us as college men and
women to unite ourselves upon the
progressive side. Equality before the
law is the battle cry of our day. We
Americans are just beginning to real
ize that bad laws in the hands of good
men are preferable to good laws in the
hands of bad men. Men, not meas
ures, is our need. The historic fight
of the "Insurgents" in our degenerate
national legislature, seemingly hope
less a few shorts months ago, yet to
day fast assuming the proportions of
a stampede towards a regenerated
body politic; the commentaries of Col
orado's famous juvenile judge; the
relentless crusade of the "National
Weekly" and other unbought journals;
the temporarily unappreciated efforts
of San Francisco's irrepressible prose
cutor, greater than ever in defeat; the
uncompromising non-partizan attitude
of Roosevelt, Bryan, La Follette and
other great leaders of the day; all
these are but evidences of an awak
ened public conscience, of the great
struggle now being waged, largely by
college men, in a mighty effort to free
the nation from the clutches of or
ganized greed. Just as the Revolu
tionary and Civil Wars were but re
curring instances of the never ending
struggle for just and human living
conditions, so is this but another com

pelling instance. It differs only in
this, that it is a mental liberation. In
the words of Dr. Scherer: "Roose
velt of Harvard is there, Pinchot of
Yale is there and, paraphrasing slight
ly, there is room for 1910 of Stanford
beside them!"
I have just said that college men are
foremost in this great movement. Yet,
truth compels a supplementary state
ment: college men are likewise the
leaders of the vicious opposition. Per
haps, Judge Llndsey's assertion that
"the universities are turning out more
criminals than the prisons" is not
literally true. Still, the actual con
dition is one which 1910 should do its
share in eradicating. And in urging
j you to this task, I do not mean to min
j imize its difficulties. The scorn of the
I smug gentleman in broadcloth, the
ridicule of the subsidized press, os
tracism from the higher circles of so
ciety and clubdom, poverty, oblivion,
yes, even assassination may be your
reward. Heney's and Lindsey's re
ward has come in this wise. The
world is alive with bullies, physical
and mental. If mental browbeating, if
inspired verbal onslaughts, do not curb
the expressions of honest opinions, the
genteel bully of today will scarcely
hesitate at personal violence. But,
will we college men and women cower
before such obstacles, will we accept
defeat at the hands of the "Beast,"
when the future of the nation lies at
stake? I think not. Vain should be
the labor of those who seek to deter
1910 men from this duty. Certainly,
when the slogan "it hurts business"
supplants "it hurts the nation," when
Woodrow Wilson and Judge Lindsev
charge the churches with becoming the
haven of the despoilers of our national
birthright, when the all powerful press
becomes the mouthpiece of special
privilege, and when even the universi
ties turn from the people to their op
pressors for support, there is work
for you and me to do. Surely the
election of McCarthy—a standing men
ace to the future of San Francisco, and
a disgrace to American politics—to
gether with the removal of Pinchot,
are clarion blasts that call the college
man to action on behalf of higher
standards of life in city, instate and in
nation. The church, the school and
the press should be the greatest mod
ern factors in the attainment of true
democracy, and they can best be re
turned to the side of decency by a
trained patriotic leadership of college
men. Shall we shirk the responsibil
ity ? Accepting it, we can continue to
hold our heads high and keep our
consciences clear. We can then ignore
the slurs and slanders of petty people
on the realization that we have done
our duty to university and country.
In the words of the great emancipator:
"Let us have faith that right makes
might, and in that faith, let us, to the
end, dare to do our duty as we under
stand it.'
Thus beholding the opportunity, let
us seize it. By the time the chain of
claws plates reaches yonder corner,
most of us will have performed our
work on earth, for better or for worse.
Let us hope that the record of our
work will cause the graduates of that
distant day no regret, that no single
failure shall mar the record of the
class of 1910, that the class roll, which
in a few moments is to be sealed be
neath the pavement, will be an un
broken roll of honor. So today, proud
of the past and sanguine of the future,
as spokesman of 1910, I commit to
Stanford this lasting token of our ap
preciation and cooperative pledge of
fealty to the principles of democracy
taught at her shrine."
Many Seniors gathered in the Uni
versity Chapel last Friday morning in
the last meeting that the Class of 1910
will hold as an organization of under
graduates. The program for the morn
ing consisted in the usual reading of
the class documents, including the his
tory, the will and an informal talk by
Class President L. S. Scott.
President Scott spoke first to his
classmates in the following manner:
"Dr. Jordan and Fellow Classmen: —
Class spirit should be felt at its high
est during this space of time when we
meet lastly as an organized body of a
student body.
Four years we have been carrying
along the fortunes of 1910 in various
activities. Dramatics, athletics, for
ensics, the social life, and various
other forms of activities outside of the
usual pursuit of knowledge have
bound us together as a unit.
Friendships have been made out of
these activities which will be highly
valued throughout life. In return we
should give something to our Alma
Mater which has made possible all
these things. No higher or nobler
aim could be set before every alumnus
for repaying this institution for these
priviliges it has afforded us than the
advancement of the University. An
active interest now and then is what
is due from every graduate member of
the Class of 1910.
Our class has had a magnificent
history during the past 4 years and I
sincerely hope that every name upon
its role will be just as successful in
the future."
W. P. Fuller, Jr. Reads History.
"W. P. Fuller, Jr., next read the
following class history;
Mr.President, Classmates and Friends:
Some four years ago a curious ag
gregation of erstwhile high school
students, leaving the paternal roof
and the maternal apron string that
they might pursue wisdom with the
more seriousness, came nuto Stanford.
The remnants of that same curious
aggregation (remnants —for stormy
has been the voyage) are now confi
dently awaiting the end, having pur
sued the aforementioned wisdom with
the requisite vigor. Put they leave
Stanford only after endeavoring to
serve the University as every true
son should serve his Alma Mater. The
men and women of 1910 have done
their duty as members of the Univer
sity and of the Student Body; and this
in spite of many discouraging condi
tions which have confronted them
spasmodically in the past four years.
Nineteen Ten early presaged a spirit
of strength and ingenuity, two at
tributes which have ever marked the
achievements of the Class. From the
moment of the adoption of a Freshman
cap to the formation of an entirely
new arrangement of Commencement
week events, the present Seniors have
constantly changed, modified and bet

tered previously existing conditions
which failed to suit them.
As Freshmen, Nineteen Ten were
successful from the Intercollegiate
point of view only in the regatta, but
her men were at work in every field
of activity, laying that solid basis
which in the future was to give the
class such decided pre-eminence.
It was in our Sophomore year that
the star of Nineteen Ten began to
shine with ominous brightness. The
Class fifteen won the first of its three
Rugby championships, and we are
prone to believe that only the ab
sense of an interclass series in 1906
prevented Nineteen Ten from record
ing a fourth victory. By the end of
1907 four members of the Class had
already earned Varsity "S's" in foot
ball; they were the future Rugby cap
tain, Mitchell; the future baseball cap
tain, Ganong; the future crew captain,
Reynolds; and the future All-Ameri
can player, Louis Cheda. Since then
the football "S" has been given to
Fitting, Cook, Faulkner, and our all
round wonder, Scott. As much to
these men as to any does Stanford owe
her three Varsity football victories dur
ing the life of Rugby and of Nineteen
Ten.
On the track, the four-time point
winners, Scott and Poor, with Captain
elect Rellah and Reed, Martin, Hel*-
ley and Shelton, have joined forces
with the other classes to make three
out of the last four track meets glor
ious events for the Cardinal. Scott,
Bellah, Martin and Maundrell have
won points for Stanford at meets of
the "Western Conference Association.
Nineteen Ten may boast of such for
midable Varsity ball-tossers as Mitch
ell, Ganong, Reed, Scott, Gore, Coch
ran and the slugging McFadden, while
Reynolds, Patrick, Huston, Malone,
Benson, Vose, Wilde, Fitting and Rob
erts championed the Class on the 1
water.
Our tennis cracks have been Henry,
Mann and Jordan.
Tn these five branches of sport. Nine
teen Ten is fortunate enough to claim ,
ten Varsity captains: Mitchell in foot
ball; Scott and Bellah in track; Can- j
ong and Reed in baseball; Reynolds, j
Patrick and TJuston in boating; and j
Mann and Henry in tennis. Such a'
record is unprecedented.
.Tust as Nineteen Seven had their |
Presley, Nineteen Eight their Fenton,
1900 their Crawford, so have Nineteen
Ten their Scott. But Leland Stanford
Scott is famed in three branches of
athletics and boasts a world's record,
while but two sports attracted either
of the three former heroes. Scott is
the most versatile of all Stanford ath
letes.
Nineteen Ten have accomplished
just hs much in non-athletic activities.
We have had more editors than other
classes with Hails, Adams, TJndauer,
Leaf, Fisk, Fuller and Morgan. We
have the best debater of this and many
other college generations, .T. Errett

Shelton, ably seconded by Batkin and
Morgan. We have more people prom
inent in dramatics than any previous
class, for Nineteen Ten claims the
former Miss Ozier, Miss Howell, Miss
Wright, De Bolt, Pettigrew, Thompson,
Fuller, Mnnier and, to again repeat,
Morgan. Without hesitation we say
that she whom we all know as Miss
Ozier is the most accomplished ama
teur actress ever enrolled at Stanford.
Erhorn, De Bolt and Happy, as yell
leaders, have maintained the reputa
tion of the Class. That we are able to
conduct our Senior Week with the pay
ment of merely a nominal assessment
is due only to the frenzied machina
tions of as interested a worker as a
class could ever possess, Herman Rit
tigstein. In every field the men of
Nineteen Ten are to be found actively
and creditably engaged.
And likewise the women ! Besides
those mentioned in connection with
dramatics, the Misses James, Metzner,
Park, Bundy, Hayward and Palmer
have each done far more than her
share.
Nineteen Ten has been in the front
of happenings unusual as well as us
ual. The 1908 Peerade found many
Sophomores in its midst, as did the
various documents soon after issued
by the Commttee on Student Affairs.
Nineteen Ten introduced the first sen
sible system of Quad control. We gave
the greatest and last of the great Plug
Uglies, and until reading the 1911
Quad, we were of the impression that
success bad been ours in the Plug
Ugly of this year. We must have been
in error, however, for in that book we
are told that "never once did the
Juniors stop until they had put out
everybody, even to the lights on the
Quad." We apologize for our mis
taken belief. Nineteen Ten have also
seen the beginnings of the Stanford
Union and have aided materially in
the cause.
Hut perhaps the field in which our
superiority is the most wonderful and
unique has not as yet been mentioned.
So attractive are the maids of Nine
teen Ten that numberless stern men
have forsaken possibly three square
meals a day, as well ps bachelordoru,
in order to avoid all risk of loss. Mat
rimonially, we can have no rival.
During our last few months unfor
tunate dissension has spread among
us. It has served, however, only to
emphasize the strength and force of
our leaders. That the trouble unjustly
took from Nineteen Ten one of her
finest sons is the saddest fact which
we have to record.
Yet despite peerades, Plugs and pol
itics a goodly number of us have sur
vived. We look upon a Stanford diff
erent from that which we saw upon
our entrance: different because of
che way in which we view it; different
in and of itself. Perhaps our ideas
are not one as to which is the better.
Yet when all is done, both will be
good to look back upon.

"W. P. Fuller, Jr., next read the
following class history;
Mr.President, Classmates and Friends:
Some four years ago a curious ag
gregation of erstwhile high school
students, leaving the paternal roof
and the maternal apron string that
they might pursue wisdom with the
more seriousness, came nuto Stanford.
The remnants of that same curious
aggregation (remnants —for stormy
has been the voyage) are now confi
dently awaiting the end, having pur
sued the aforementioned wisdom with
the requisite vigor. Put they leave
Stanford only after endeavoring to
serve the University as every true
son should serve his Alma Mater. The
men and women of 1910 have done
their duty as members of the Univer
sity and of the Student Body; and this
in spite of many discouraging condi
tions which have confronted them
spasmodically in the past four years.
Nineteen Ten early presaged a spirit
of strength and ingenuity, two at
tributes which have ever marked the
achievements of the Class. From the
moment of the adoption of a Freshman
cap to the formation of an entirely
new arrangement of Commencement
week events, the present Seniors have
constantly changed, modified and bet

tered previously existing conditions
which failed to suit them.
As Freshmen, Nineteen Ten were
successful from the Intercollegiate
point of view only in the regatta, but
her men were at work in every field
of activity, laying that solid basis
which in the future was to give the
class such decided pre-eminence.
It was in our Sophomore year that
the star of Nineteen Ten began to
shine with ominous brightness. The
Class fifteen won the first of its three
Rugby championships, and we are
prone to believe that only the ab
sense of an interclass series in 1906
prevented Nineteen Ten from record
ing a fourth victory. By the end of
1907 four members of the Class had
already earned Varsity "S's" in foot
ball; they were the future Rugby cap
tain, Mitchell; the future baseball cap
tain, Ganong; the future crew captain,
Reynolds; and the future All-Ameri
can player, Louis Cheda. Since then
the football "S" has been given to
Fitting, Cook, Faulkner, and our all
round wonder, Scott. As much to
these men as to any does Stanford owe
her three Varsity football victories dur
ing the life of Rugby and of Nineteen
Ten.
On the track, the four-time point
winners, Scott and Poor, with Captain
elect Rellah and Reed, Martin, Hel*-
ley and Shelton, have joined forces
with the other classes to make three
out of the last four track meets glor
ious events for the Cardinal. Scott,
Bellah, Martin and Maundrell have
won points for Stanford at meets of
the "Western Conference Association.
Nineteen Ten may boast of such for
midable Varsity ball-tossers as Mitch
ell, Ganong, Reed, Scott, Gore, Coch
ran and the slugging McFadden, while
Reynolds, Patrick, Huston, Malone,
Benson, Vose, Wilde, Fitting and Rob
erts championed the Class on the 1
water.
Our tennis cracks have been Henry,
Mann and Jordan.
Tn these five branches of sport. Nine
teen Ten is fortunate enough to claim ,
ten Varsity captains: Mitchell in foot
ball; Scott and Bellah in track; Can- j
ong and Reed in baseball; Reynolds, j
Patrick and TJuston in boating; and j
Mann and Henry in tennis. Such a'
record is unprecedented.
.Tust as Nineteen Seven had their |
Presley, Nineteen Eight their Fenton,
1900 their Crawford, so have Nineteen
Ten their Scott. But Leland Stanford
Scott is famed in three branches of
athletics and boasts a world's record,
while but two sports attracted either
of the three former heroes. Scott is
the most versatile of all Stanford ath
letes.
Nineteen Ten have accomplished
just hs much in non-athletic activities.
We have had more editors than other
classes with Hails, Adams, TJndauer,
Leaf, Fisk, Fuller and Morgan. We
have the best debater of this and many
other college generations, .T. Errett

Shelton, ably seconded by Batkin and
Morgan. We have more people prom
inent in dramatics than any previous
class, for Nineteen Ten claims the
former Miss Ozier, Miss Howell, Miss
Wright, De Bolt, Pettigrew, Thompson,
Fuller, Mnnier and, to again repeat,
Morgan. Without hesitation we say
that she whom we all know as Miss
Ozier is the most accomplished ama
teur actress ever enrolled at Stanford.
Erhorn, De Bolt and Happy, as yell
leaders, have maintained the reputa
tion of the Class. That we are able to
conduct our Senior Week with the pay
ment of merely a nominal assessment
is due only to the frenzied machina
tions of as interested a worker as a
class could ever possess, Herman Rit
tigstein. In every field the men of
Nineteen Ten are to be found actively
and creditably engaged.
And likewise the women ! Besides
those mentioned in connection with
dramatics, the Misses James, Metzner,
Park, Bundy, Hayward and Palmer
have each done far more than her
share.
Nineteen Ten has been in the front
of happenings unusual as well as us
ual. The 1908 Peerade found many
Sophomores in its midst, as did the
various documents soon after issued
by the Commttee on Student Affairs.
Nineteen Ten introduced the first sen
sible system of Quad control. We gave
the greatest and last of the great Plug
Uglies, and until reading the 1911
Quad, we were of the impression that
success bad been ours in the Plug
Ugly of this year. We must have been
in error, however, for in that book we
are told that "never once did the
Juniors stop until they had put out
everybody, even to the lights on the
Quad." We apologize for our mis
taken belief. Nineteen Ten have also
seen the beginnings of the Stanford
Union and have aided materially in
the cause.
Hut perhaps the field in which our
superiority is the most wonderful and
unique has not as yet been mentioned.
So attractive are the maids of Nine
teen Ten that numberless stern men
have forsaken possibly three square
meals a day, as well ps bachelordoru,
in order to avoid all risk of loss. Mat
rimonially, we can have no rival.
During our last few months unfor
tunate dissension has spread among
us. It has served, however, only to
emphasize the strength and force of
our leaders. That the trouble unjustly
took from Nineteen Ten one of her
finest sons is the saddest fact which
we have to record.
Yet despite peerades, Plugs and pol
itics a goodly number of us have sur
vived. We look upon a Stanford diff
erent from that which we saw upon
our entrance: different because of
che way in which we view it; different
in and of itself. Perhaps our ideas
are not one as to which is the better.
Yet when all is done, both will be
good to look back upon.

S. A. Linda nor Gives Oration.
Upon the conclusion of services
in the Chapel, the 1910 plate was dedi
cated in the Inner Quadrangle with
appropriate services. S. A. Lindauer
delivered the Class Oration at this
time and in the course of his speech
said :
"Dr. Jordan, Classmates and Friends :
With a purpose similar to that of
fifteen preceding classes, we gather
here today, under the maternal shad
ows of the Memorial Church, to dedi
cate the class plate. And, as was the
case with our predecessors, the count
less pleasant memories which crowd
our minds are saddened only by the
realization that as a class we must
henceforth be widely scattered in our
chosen fields of endeavor. In laying
this plate the Class of 1910 is perform
ing its last official function as a uni
versity entity. It is awarding the cov
eted class numerals for the last time.
Not, it is true, to those doughty sons
who have successfully upheld the su
premacy of 1910 on field and rostrum,
not to athletes or debators, but rather
to the most faithful servant of all —to
our Alma Mater. Of the four years
that we have spent under her tutelage
we may truly say that "our lines have
fallen in pleasant places." We have
in that period resided within the en
chanted confines of the "red-tiled prin
cipality," oblivious to the cares and ex
acting conventions of the outside
world. In this most democratic of all
democratic amtospheres we have dwelt
as fellow students, imbibing zealously
the Stanford Spirit and drinking deep
of Stanford ideals. More or less per
sistently, as the case may be, we have
penetrated the vast storehouse of
knowledge which these expansive
monuments of Spanish architecture
concretely represent. We have en
joyed to the utmost the pleasures of
student life. Thrice have we seen vic
tory perch 011 Cardinal banners in
football in track, in crew and in Car
not contests; twice have we seen base
ball series emblazoned in Cardinal
hue. And our pride in these successes
Avas accentuated by the share our
classmates played in their attainment.
Tt has, indeed, been a rare privilege
to bask in the sunshine of Stanford
life with all that this implies. The
California skies, the hills, the lake,
the fields, the breath of the free out
doors, all conspire to make student
life here in the glorious Santa Clara
Valley a peerless heritage. And the
glow of good fellowship, the sincere
spirit of friendship, the deep seated
democracy—where else can these be
found as they exist with us at Stan
ford ?
And now, my classmates, this func
tion signalizes the culmination of our
college existence. Varied explana
tions have been worked out by my
forerunners as to the meaning of the
ceremony. To me there is little room
for doubt as to its true interpretation.
It provides a lofty eminence from
which we can soberly gaze in retro
spect upon the four years now draw
ing to a close. More than that, it af
fords a common starting point from
which all 1910 men and women may
begin their worldly careers with com
mon ideals, where hopes and aspira
tions to live clean, practical lives are
still unsullied by the sordid experi
ences of the larger world. Here and
now we must raise high our ambitions
to be unselfishly useful to our fellows.
Here and now we must strengthen our
purpose to actively perpetuate the
immortal principles upon which our
democracy rests.
Concerning the past I feel safe in
saying that we have left a favorable
impress upon Stanford life. Can we
do as well in the future ? What will
be the character of our influence on
American life? Shall we, standing
here today with heads held high and
consciences uncorrupted by the al
luring temptations of tomorrow, con
tinue to hold heads high and to main
tain consciences uncorrupted? Or,
as so many others have done before,
shall we lose these Cardinal Stanford
attributes in the mad rush for material
prosperity? However we may answer
these queires, this little coppe'r tablet
at our feet is placed here today as an
eternal reminder of the part that the
members of 1910 have played, in col
lege and out, in the world's progress.
Let us see to it that it symbolizes ser
vice to humanity.
And before embarking on our life's
work it is well that we should pause
for a moment to consider the duty of
college graduates in American life in
the light of the training which they
have received. For four years we
have devoted ourselves to the acquisi
tion of an education. But how useless
is the possession of mere knowledge
unless it is employed as a virile and
positive force upon the side of right,
truth and a progressive civilization.
And I believe that we of 1910 can jus
tify our education only by pointing the
way in the great struggle now going
on, a struggle that dates from the
dawn of history, a struggle that must
ultimately termirate in the triumph of
Utopian ideals. Tiie battle for human
equality and liberty is ceaseless, and
it devolves upon us as college men and
women to unite ourselves upon the
progressive side. Equality before the
law is the battle cry of our day. We
Americans are just beginning to real
ize that bad laws in the hands of good
men are preferable to good laws in the
hands of bad men. Men, not meas
ures, is our need. The historic fight
of the "Insurgents" in our degenerate
national legislature, seemingly hope
less a few shorts months ago, yet to
day fast assuming the proportions of
a stampede towards a regenerated
body politic; the commentaries of Col
orado's famous juvenile judge; the
relentless crusade of the "National
Weekly" and other unbought journals;
the temporarily unappreciated efforts
of San Francisco's irrepressible prose
cutor, greater than ever in defeat; the
uncompromising non-partizan attitude
of Roosevelt, Bryan, La Follette and
other great leaders of the day; all
these are but evidences of an awak
ened public conscience, of the great
struggle now being waged, largely by
college men, in a mighty effort to free
the nation from the clutches of or
ganized greed. Just as the Revolu
tionary and Civil Wars were but re
curring instances of the never ending
struggle for just and human living
conditions, so is this but another com

pelling instance. It differs only in
this, that it is a mental liberation. In
the words of Dr. Scherer: "Roose
velt of Harvard is there, Pinchot of
Yale is there and, paraphrasing slight
ly, there is room for 1910 of Stanford
beside them!"
I have just said that college men are
foremost in this great movement. Yet,
truth compels a supplementary state
ment: college men are likewise the
leaders of the vicious opposition. Per
haps, Judge Llndsey's assertion that
"the universities are turning out more
criminals than the prisons" is not
literally true. Still, the actual con
dition is one which 1910 should do its
share in eradicating. And in urging
j you to this task, I do not mean to min
j imize its difficulties. The scorn of the
I smug gentleman in broadcloth, the
ridicule of the subsidized press, os
tracism from the higher circles of so
ciety and clubdom, poverty, oblivion,
yes, even assassination may be your
reward. Heney's and Lindsey's re
ward has come in this wise. The
world is alive with bullies, physical
and mental. If mental browbeating, if
inspired verbal onslaughts, do not curb
the expressions of honest opinions, the
genteel bully of today will scarcely
hesitate at personal violence. But,
will we college men and women cower
before such obstacles, will we accept
defeat at the hands of the "Beast,"
when the future of the nation lies at
stake? I think not. Vain should be
the labor of those who seek to deter
1910 men from this duty. Certainly,
when the slogan "it hurts business"
supplants "it hurts the nation," when
Woodrow Wilson and Judge Lindsev
charge the churches with becoming the
haven of the despoilers of our national
birthright, when the all powerful press
becomes the mouthpiece of special
privilege, and when even the universi
ties turn from the people to their op
pressors for support, there is work
for you and me to do. Surely the
election of McCarthy—a standing men
ace to the future of San Francisco, and
a disgrace to American politics—to
gether with the removal of Pinchot,
are clarion blasts that call the college
man to action on behalf of higher
standards of life in city, instate and in
nation. The church, the school and
the press should be the greatest mod
ern factors in the attainment of true
democracy, and they can best be re
turned to the side of decency by a
trained patriotic leadership of college
men. Shall we shirk the responsibil
ity ? Accepting it, we can continue to
hold our heads high and keep our
consciences clear. We can then ignore
the slurs and slanders of petty people
on the realization that we have done
our duty to university and country.
In the words of the great emancipator:
"Let us have faith that right makes
might, and in that faith, let us, to the
end, dare to do our duty as we under
stand it.'
Thus beholding the opportunity, let
us seize it. By the time the chain of
claws plates reaches yonder corner,
most of us will have performed our
work on earth, for better or for worse.
Let us hope that the record of our
work will cause the graduates of that
distant day no regret, that no single
failure shall mar the record of the
class of 1910, that the class roll, which
in a few moments is to be sealed be
neath the pavement, will be an un
broken roll of honor. So today, proud
of the past and sanguine of the future,
as spokesman of 1910, I commit to
Stanford this lasting token of our ap
preciation and cooperative pledge of
fealty to the principles of democracy
taught at her shrine."
Many Seniors gathered in the Uni
versity Chapel last Friday morning in
the last meeting that the Class of 1910
will hold as an organization of under
graduates. The program for the morn
ing consisted in the usual reading of
the class documents, including the his
tory, the will and an informal talk by
Class President L. S. Scott.
President Scott spoke first to his
classmates in the following manner:
"Dr. Jordan and Fellow Classmen: —
Class spirit should be felt at its high
est during this space of time when we
meet lastly as an organized body of a
student body.
Four years we have been carrying
along the fortunes of 1910 in various
activities. Dramatics, athletics, for
ensics, the social life, and various
other forms of activities outside of the
usual pursuit of knowledge have
bound us together as a unit.
Friendships have been made out of
these activities which will be highly
valued throughout life. In return we
should give something to our Alma
Mater which has made possible all
these things. No higher or nobler
aim could be set before every alumnus
for repaying this institution for these
priviliges it has afforded us than the
advancement of the University. An
active interest now and then is what
is due from every graduate member of
the Class of 1910.
Our class has had a magnificent
history during the past 4 years and I
sincerely hope that every name upon
its role will be just as successful in
the future."
W. P. Fuller, Jr. Reads History.
"W. P. Fuller, Jr., next read the
following class history;
Mr.President, Classmates and Friends:
Some four years ago a curious ag
gregation of erstwhile high school
students, leaving the paternal roof
and the maternal apron string that
they might pursue wisdom with the
more seriousness, came nuto Stanford.
The remnants of that same curious
aggregation (remnants —for stormy
has been the voyage) are now confi
dently awaiting the end, having pur
sued the aforementioned wisdom with
the requisite vigor. Put they leave
Stanford only after endeavoring to
serve the University as every true
son should serve his Alma Mater. The
men and women of 1910 have done
their duty as members of the Univer
sity and of the Student Body; and this
in spite of many discouraging condi

spasmodically in the past four years.
Nineteen Ten early presaged a spirit

with the other classes to make three

this, that it is a mental liberation. In
the words of Dr. Scherer: "Roose
velt of Harvard is there, Pinchot of
Yale is there and, paraphrasing slight
ly, there is room for 1910 of Stanford
beside them!"
I have just said that college men are
foremost in this great movement. Yet,
truth compels a supplementary state
ment: college men are likewise the
leaders of the vicious opposition. Per
haps, Judge Llndsey's assertion that
"the universities are turning out more
criminals than the prisons" is not
literally true. Still, the actual con
dition is one which 1910 should do its
share in eradicating. And in urging
j you to this task, I do not mean to min
j imize its difficulties. The scorn of the
I smug gentleman in broadcloth, the
ridicule of the subsidized press, os
tracism from the higher circles of so
ciety and clubdom, poverty, oblivion,
yes, even assassination may be your
reward. Heney's and Lindsey's re
ward has come in this wise. The
world is alive with bullies, physical
and mental. If mental browbeating, if
inspired verbal onslaughts, do not curb
the expressions of honest opinions, the
genteel bully of today will scarcely
hesitate at personal violence. But,
will we college men and women cower
before such obstacles, will we accept
defeat at the hands of the "Beast,"
when the future of the nation lies at
stake? I think not. Vain should be
the labor of those who seek to deter
1910 men from this duty. Certainly,
when the slogan "it hurts business"
supplants "it hurts the nation," when
Woodrow Wilson and Judge Lindsev
charge the churches with becoming the
haven of the despoilers of our national
birthright, when the all powerful press
becomes the mouthpiece of special
privilege, and when even the universi
ties turn from the people to their op
pressors for support, there is work
for you and me to do. Surely the
election of McCarthy—a standing men
ace to the future of San Francisco, and
a disgrace to American politics—to
gether with the removal of Pinchot,
are clarion blasts that call the college
man to action on behalf of higher
standards of life in city, instate and in
nation. The church, the school and
the press should be the greatest mod
ern factors in the attainment of true
democracy, and they can best be re
turned to the side of decency by a
trained patriotic leadership of college
men. Shall we shirk the responsibil
ity ? Accepting it, we can continue to
hold our heads high and keep our
consciences clear. We can then ignore
the slurs and slanders of petty people
on the realization that we have done
our duty to university and country.
In the words of the great emancipator:
"Let us have faith that right makes
might, and in that faith, let us, to the
end, dare to do our duty as we under
stand it.'
Thus beholding the opportunity, let
us seize it. By the time the chain of
claws plates reaches yonder corner,
most of us will have performed our
work on earth, for better or for worse.
Let us hope that the record of our
work will cause the graduates of that
distant day no regret, that no single
failure shall mar the record of the
class of 1910, that the class roll, which
in a few moments is to be sealed be
neath the pavement, will be an un
broken roll of honor. So today, proud
of the past and sanguine of the future,
as spokesman of 1910, I commit to
Stanford this lasting token of our ap
preciation and cooperative pledge of
fealty to the principles of democracy
taught at her shrine."
Many Seniors gathered in the Uni
versity Chapel last Friday morning in
the last meeting that the Class of 1910
will hold as an organization of under
graduates. The program for the morn
ing consisted in the usual reading of
the class documents, including the his
tory, the will and an informal talk by
Class President L. S. Scott.
President Scott spoke first to his
classmates in the following manner:
"Dr. Jordan and Fellow Classmen: —
Class spirit should be felt at its high
est during this space of time when we
meet lastly as an organized body of a
student body.
Four years we have been carrying
along the fortunes of 1910 in various
activities. Dramatics, athletics, for
ensics, the social life, and various
other forms of activities outside of the
usual pursuit of knowledge have
bound us together as a unit.
Friendships have been made out of
these activities which will be highly
valued throughout life. In return we
should give something to our Alma
Mater which has made possible all
these things. No higher or nobler
aim could be set before every alumnus
for repaying this institution for these
priviliges it has afforded us than the
advancement of the University. An
active interest now and then is what
is due from every graduate member of
the Class of 1910.
Our class has had a magnificent
history during the past 4 years and I
sincerely hope that every name upon
its role will be just as successful in
the future."
W. P. Fuller, Jr. Reads History.
"W. P. Fuller, Jr., next read the
following class history;
Mr.President, Classmates and Friends:
Some four years ago a curious ag
gregation of erstwhile high school
students, leaving the paternal roof
and the maternal apron string that
they might pursue wisdom with the
more seriousness, came nuto Stanford.
The remnants of that same curious
aggregation (remnants —for stormy
has been the voyage) are now confi
dently awaiting the end, having pur
sued the aforementioned wisdom with
the requisite vigor. Put they leave
Stanford only after endeavoring to
serve the University as every true
son should serve his Alma Mater. The
men and women of 1910 have done
their duty as members of the Univer
sity and of the Student Body; and this
in spite of many discouraging condi
tions which have confronted them
spasmodically in the past four years.
Nineteen Ten early presaged a spirit
of strength and ingenuity, two at
tributes which have ever marked the
achievements of the Class. From the
moment of the adoption of a Freshman
cap to the formation of an entirely
new arrangement of Commencement
week events, the present Seniors have
constantly changed, modified and bet

tered previously existing conditions
which failed to suit them.
As Freshmen, Nineteen Ten were
successful from the Intercollegiate
point of view only in the regatta, but
her men were at work in every field
of activity, laying that solid basis
which in the future was to give the
class such decided pre-eminence.
It was in our Sophomore year that
the star of Nineteen Ten began to
shine with ominous brightness. The
Class fifteen won the first of its three
Rugby championships, and we are
prone to believe that only the ab
sense of an interclass series in 1906
prevented Nineteen Ten from record
ing a fourth victory. By the end of
1907 four members of the Class had
already earned Varsity "S's" in foot
ball; they were the future Rugby cap
tain, Mitchell; the future baseball cap
tain, Ganong; the future crew captain,
Reynolds; and the future All-Ameri
can player, Louis Cheda. Since then
the football "S" has been given to
Fitting, Cook, Faulkner, and our all
round wonder, Scott. As much to
these men as to any does Stanford owe
her three Varsity football victories dur
ing the life of Rugby and of Nineteen
Ten.
On the track, the four-time point
winners, Scott and Poor, with Captain
elect Rellah and Reed, Martin, Hel*-
ley and Shelton, have joined forces
with the other classes to make three
out of the last four track meets glor
ious events for the Cardinal. Scott,
Bellah, Martin and Maundrell have
won points for Stanford at meets of
the "Western Conference Association.
Nineteen Ten may boast of such for
midable Varsity ball-tossers as Mitch
ell, Ganong, Reed, Scott, Gore, Coch
ran and the slugging McFadden, while
Reynolds, Patrick, Huston, Malone,
Benson, Vose, Wilde, Fitting and Rob
erts championed the Class on the 1
water.
Our tennis cracks have been Henry,
Mann and Jordan.
Tn these five branches of sport. Nine
teen Ten is fortunate enough to claim ,
ten Varsity captains: Mitchell in foot
ball; Scott and Bellah in track; Can- j
ong and Reed in baseball; Reynolds, j
Patrick and TJuston in boating; and j
Mann and Henry in tennis. Such a'
record is unprecedented.
.Tust as Nineteen Seven had their |
Presley, Nineteen Eight their Fenton,
1900 their Crawford, so have Nineteen
Ten their Scott. But Leland Stanford
Scott is famed in three branches of
athletics and boasts a world's record,
while but two sports attracted either
of the three former heroes. Scott is
the most versatile of all Stanford ath
letes.
Nineteen Ten have accomplished
just hs much in non-athletic activities.
We have had more editors than other
classes with Hails, Adams, TJndauer,
Leaf, Fisk, Fuller and Morgan. We
have the best debater of this and many
other college generations, .T. Errett

Shelton, ably seconded by Batkin and
Morgan. We have more people prom
inent in dramatics than any previous
class, for Nineteen Ten claims the
former Miss Ozier, Miss Howell, Miss
Wright, De Bolt, Pettigrew, Thompson,
Fuller, Mnnier and, to again repeat,
Morgan. Without hesitation we say
that she whom we all know as Miss
Ozier is the most accomplished ama
teur actress ever enrolled at Stanford.
Erhorn, De Bolt and Happy, as yell
leaders, have maintained the reputa
tion of the Class. That we are able to
conduct our Senior Week with the pay
ment of merely a nominal assessment
is due only to the frenzied machina
tions of as interested a worker as a
class could ever possess, Herman Rit
tigstein. In every field the men of
Nineteen Ten are to be found actively
and creditably engaged.
And likewise the women ! Besides
those mentioned in connection with
dramatics, the Misses James, Metzner,
Park, Bundy, Hayward and Palmer
have each done far more than her
share.
Nineteen Ten has been in the front
of happenings unusual as well as us
ual. The 1908 Peerade found many
Sophomores in its midst, as did the
various documents soon after issued
by the Commttee on Student Affairs.
Nineteen Ten introduced the first sen
sible system of Quad control. We gave
the greatest and last of the great Plug
Uglies, and until reading the 1911
Quad, we were of the impression that
success bad been ours in the Plug
Ugly of this year. We must have been
in error, however, for in that book we
are told that "never once did the
Juniors stop until they had put out
everybody, even to the lights on the
Quad." We apologize for our mis
taken belief. Nineteen Ten have also
seen the beginnings of the Stanford
Union and have aided materially in
the cause.
Hut perhaps the field in which our
superiority is the most wonderful and
unique has not as yet been mentioned.
So attractive are the maids of Nine
teen Ten that numberless stern men
have forsaken possibly three square
meals a day, as well ps bachelordoru,
in order to avoid all risk of loss. Mat
rimonially, we can have no rival.
During our last few months unfor
tunate dissension has spread among
us. It has served, however, only to
emphasize the strength and force of
our leaders. That the trouble unjustly
took from Nineteen Ten one of her
finest sons is the saddest fact which
we have to record.
Yet despite peerades, Plugs and pol
itics a goodly number of us have sur
vived. We look upon a Stanford diff
erent from that which we saw upon
our entrance: different because of
che way in which we view it; different
in and of itself. Perhaps our ideas
are not one as to which is the better.
Yet when all is done, both will be
good to look back upon.

S. A. Linda nor Gives Oration.
Upon the conclusion of services
in the Chapel, the 1910 plate was dedi
cated in the Inner Quadrangle with
appropriate services. S. A. Lindauer
delivered the Class Oration at this
time and in the course of his speech
said :
"Dr. Jordan, Classmates and Friends :
With a purpose similar to that of
fifteen preceding classes, we gather
here today, under the maternal shad
ows of the Memorial Church, to dedi
cate the class plate. And, as was the
case with our predecessors, the count
less pleasant memories which crowd
our minds are saddened only by the
realization that as a class we must
henceforth be widely scattered in our
chosen fields of endeavor. In laying
this plate the Class of 1910 is perform
ing its last official function as a uni
versity entity. It is awarding the cov
eted class numerals for the last time.
Not, it is true, to those doughty sons
who have successfully upheld the su
premacy of 1910 on field and rostrum,
not to athletes or debators, but rather
to the most faithful servant of all —to
our Alma Mater. Of the four years
that we have spent under her tutelage
we may truly say that "our lines have
fallen in pleasant places." We have
in that period resided within the en
chanted confines of the "red-tiled prin
cipality," oblivious to the cares and ex
acting conventions of the outside
world. In this most democratic of all
democratic amtospheres we have dwelt
as fellow students, imbibing zealously
the Stanford Spirit and drinking deep
of Stanford ideals. More or less per
sistently, as the case may be, we have
penetrated the vast storehouse of
knowledge which these expansive
monuments of Spanish architecture
concretely represent. We have en
joyed to the utmost the pleasures of
student life. Thrice have we seen vic
tory perch 011 Cardinal banners in
football in track, in crew and in Car
not contests; twice have we seen base
ball series emblazoned in Cardinal
hue. And our pride in these successes
Avas accentuated by the share our
classmates played in their attainment.
Tt has, indeed, been a rare privilege
to bask in the sunshine of Stanford
life with all that this implies. The
California skies, the hills, the lake,
the fields, the breath of the free out
doors, all conspire to make student
life here in the glorious Santa Clara
Valley a peerless heritage. And the
glow of good fellowship, the sincere
spirit of friendship, the deep seated
democracy—where else can these be
found as they exist with us at Stan
ford ?
And now, my classmates, this func
tion signalizes the culmination of our
college existence. Varied explana
tions have been worked out by my
forerunners as to the meaning of the
ceremony. To me there is little room
for doubt as to its true interpretation.
It provides a lofty eminence from
which we can soberly gaze in retro
spect upon the four years now draw
ing to a close. More than that, it af
fords a common starting point from
which all 1910 men and women may
begin their worldly careers with com
mon ideals, where hopes and aspira
tions to live clean, practical lives are
still unsullied by the sordid experi
ences of the larger world. Here and
now we must raise high our ambitions
to be unselfishly useful to our fellows.
Here and now we must strengthen our
purpose to actively perpetuate the
immortal principles upon which our
democracy rests.
Concerning the past I feel safe in
saying that we have left a favorable
impress upon Stanford life. Can we
do as well in the future ? What will
be the character of our influence on
American life? Shall we, standing
here today with heads held high and
consciences uncorrupted by the al
luring temptations of tomorrow, con
tinue to hold heads high and to main
tain consciences uncorrupted? Or,
as so many others have done before,
shall we lose these Cardinal Stanford
attributes in the mad rush for material
prosperity? However we may answer
these queires, this little coppe'r tablet
at our feet is placed here today as an
eternal reminder of the part that the
members of 1910 have played, in col
lege and out, in the world's progress.
Let us see to it that it symbolizes ser
vice to humanity.
And before embarking on our life's
work it is well that we should pause
for a moment to consider the duty of
college graduates in American life in
the light of the training which they
have received. For four years we
have devoted ourselves to the acquisi
tion of an education. But how useless
is the possession of mere knowledge
unless it is employed as a virile and
positive force upon the side of right,
truth and a progressive civilization.
And I believe that we of 1910 can jus
tify our education only by pointing the
way in the great struggle now going
on, a struggle that dates from the
dawn of history, a struggle that must
ultimately termirate in the triumph of
Utopian ideals. Tiie battle for human
equality and liberty is ceaseless, and
it devolves upon us as college men and
women to unite ourselves upon the
progressive side. Equality before the
law is the battle cry of our day. We
Americans are just beginning to real
ize that bad laws in the hands of good
men are preferable to good laws in the
hands of bad men. Men, not meas
ures, is our need. The historic fight
of the "Insurgents" in our degenerate
national legislature, seemingly hope
less a few shorts months ago, yet to
day fast assuming the proportions of
a stampede towards a regenerated
body politic; the commentaries of Col
orado's famous juvenile judge; the
relentless crusade of the "National
Weekly" and other unbought journals;
the temporarily unappreciated efforts
of San Francisco's irrepressible prose
cutor, greater than ever in defeat; the
uncompromising non-partizan attitude
of Roosevelt, Bryan, La Follette and
other great leaders of the day; all
these are but evidences of an awak
ened public conscience, of the great
struggle now being waged, largely by
college men, in a mighty effort to free
the nation from the clutches of or
ganized greed. Just as the Revolu
tionary and Civil Wars were but re
curring instances of the never ending
struggle for just and human living
conditions, so is this but another com

pelling instance. It differs only in
this, that it is a mental liberation. In
the words of Dr. Scherer: "Roose
velt of Harvard is there, Pinchot of
Yale is there and, paraphrasing slight
ly, there is room for 1910 of Stanford
beside them!"
I have just said that college men are

truth compels a supplementary state

yes, even assassination may be your

world is alive with bullies, physical
and mental. If mental browbeating, if
inspired verbal onslaughts, do not curb
the expressions of honest opinions, the
genteel bully of today will scarcely
hesitate at personal violence. But,
will we college men and women cower
before such obstacles, will we accept
defeat at the hands of the "Beast,"
when the future of the nation lies at
stake? I think not. Vain should be
the labor of those who seek to deter
1910 men from this duty. Certainly,
when the slogan "it hurts business"
supplants "it hurts the nation," when

eted class numerals for the last time.
Not, it is true, to those doughty sons
who have successfully upheld the su
premacy of 1910 on field and rostrum,
not to athletes or debators, but rather
to the most faithful servant of all —to
our Alma Mater. Of the four years
that we have spent under her tutelage
we may truly say that "our lines have
fallen in pleasant places." We have
in that period resided within the en
chanted confines of the "red-tiled prin
cipality," oblivious to the cares and ex
acting conventions of the outside
world. In this most democratic of all
democratic amtospheres we have dwelt
as fellow students, imbibing zealously
the Stanford Spirit and drinking deep
of Stanford ideals. More or less per
sistently, as the case may be, we have
penetrated the vast storehouse of
knowledge which these expansive
monuments of Spanish architecture
concretely represent. We have en
joyed to the utmost the pleasures of
student life. Thrice have we seen vic
tory perch 011 Cardinal banners in
football in track, in crew and in Car
not contests; twice have we seen base
ball series emblazoned in Cardinal
hue. And our pride in these successes
Avas accentuated by the share our
classmates played in their attainment.
Tt has, indeed, been a rare privilege
to bask in the sunshine of Stanford
life with all that this implies. The
California skies, the hills, the lake,
the fields, the breath of the free out
doors, all conspire to make student
life here in the glorious Santa Clara
Valley a peerless heritage. And the
glow of good fellowship, the sincere
spirit of friendship, the deep seated
democracy—where else can these be
found as they exist with us at Stan
ford ?
And now, my classmates, this func
tion signalizes the culmination of our
college existence. Varied explana
tions have been worked out by my
forerunners as to the meaning of the
ceremony. To me there is little room
for doubt as to its true interpretation.
It provides a lofty eminence from
which we can soberly gaze in retro
spect upon the four years now draw
ing to a close. More than that, it af
fords a common starting point from
which all 1910 men and women may
begin their worldly careers with com
mon ideals, where hopes and aspira
tions to live clean, practical lives are
still unsullied by the sordid experi
ences of the larger world. Here and
now we must raise high our ambitions
to be unselfishly useful to our fellows.
Here and now we must strengthen our
purpose to actively perpetuate the
immortal principles upon which our
democracy rests.
Concerning the past I feel safe in
saying that we have left a favorable
impress upon Stanford life. Can we
do as well in the future ? What will
be the character of our influence on
American life? Shall we, standing
here today with heads held high and
consciences uncorrupted by the al
luring temptations of tomorrow, con
tinue to hold heads high and to main
tain consciences uncorrupted? Or,
as so many others have done before,
shall we lose these Cardinal Stanford
attributes in the mad rush for material
prosperity? However we may answer
these queires, this little coppe'r tablet
at our feet is placed here today as an
eternal reminder of the part that the
members of 1910 have played, in col
lege and out, in the world's progress.
Let us see to it that it symbolizes ser
vice to humanity.
And before embarking on our life's
work it is well that we should pause
for a moment to consider the duty of
college graduates in American life in
the light of the training which they
have received. For four years we
have devoted ourselves to the acquisi
tion of an education. But how useless
is the possession of mere knowledge
unless it is employed as a virile and
positive force upon the side of right,
truth and a progressive civilization.
And I believe that we of 1910 can jus
tify our education only by pointing the
way in the great struggle now going
on, a struggle that dates from the
dawn of history, a struggle that must
ultimately termirate in the triumph of
Utopian ideals. Tiie battle for human
equality and liberty is ceaseless, and
it devolves upon us as college men and
women to unite ourselves upon the
progressive side. Equality before the
law is the battle cry of our day. We
Americans are just beginning to real
ize that bad laws in the hands of good
men are preferable to good laws in the
hands of bad men. Men, not meas
ures, is our need. The historic fight
of the "Insurgents" in our degenerate
national legislature, seemingly hope
less a few shorts months ago, yet to
day fast assuming the proportions of
a stampede towards a regenerated
body politic; the commentaries of Col
orado's famous juvenile judge; the
relentless crusade of the "National
Weekly" and other unbought journals;
the temporarily unappreciated efforts
of San Francisco's irrepressible prose
cutor, greater than ever in defeat; the
uncompromising non-partizan attitude
of Roosevelt, Bryan, La Follette and
other great leaders of the day; all
these are but evidences of an awak
ened public conscience, of the great
struggle now being waged, largely by
college men, in a mighty effort to free
the nation from the clutches of or
ganized greed. Just as the Revolu
tionary and Civil Wars were but re
curring instances of the never ending
struggle for just and human living
conditions, so is this but another com

pelling instance. It differs only in
this, that it is a mental liberation. In
the words of Dr. Scherer: "Roose
velt of Harvard is there, Pinchot of
Yale is there and, paraphrasing slight
ly, there is room for 1910 of Stanford
beside them!"
I have just said that college men are
foremost in this great movement. Yet,
truth compels a supplementary state
ment: college men are likewise the
leaders of the vicious opposition. Per
haps, Judge Llndsey's assertion that
"the universities are turning out more
criminals than the prisons" is not
literally true. Still, the actual con
dition is one which 1910 should do its
share in eradicating. And in urging
j you to this task, I do not mean to min
j imize its difficulties. The scorn of the
I smug gentleman in broadcloth, the
ridicule of the subsidized press, os
tracism from the higher circles of so
ciety and clubdom, poverty, oblivion,
yes, even assassination may be your
reward. Heney's and Lindsey's re
ward has come in this wise. The
world is alive with bullies, physical
and mental. If mental browbeating, if
inspired verbal onslaughts, do not curb
the expressions of honest opinions, the
genteel bully of today will scarcely
hesitate at personal violence. But,
will we college men and women cower
before such obstacles, will we accept
defeat at the hands of the "Beast,"
when the future of the nation lies at
stake? I think not. Vain should be
the labor of those who seek to deter
1910 men from this duty. Certainly,
when the slogan "it hurts business"
supplants "it hurts the nation," when
Woodrow Wilson and Judge Lindsev
charge the churches with becoming the
haven of the despoilers of our national
birthright, when the all powerful press
becomes the mouthpiece of special
privilege, and when even the universi
ties turn from the people to their op
pressors for support, there is work
for you and me to do. Surely the
election of McCarthy—a standing men
ace to the future of San Francisco, and
a disgrace to American politics—to
gether with the removal of Pinchot,
are clarion blasts that call the college
man to action on behalf of higher
standards of life in city, instate and in
nation. The church, the school and
the press should be the greatest mod
ern factors in the attainment of true
democracy, and they can best be re
turned to the side of decency by a
trained patriotic leadership of college
men. Shall we shirk the responsibil
ity ? Accepting it, we can continue to
hold our heads high and keep our
consciences clear. We can then ignore
the slurs and slanders of petty people
on the realization that we have done
our duty to university and country.
In the words of the great emancipator:
"Let us have faith that right makes
might, and in that faith, let us, to the
end, dare to do our duty as we under
stand it.'
Thus beholding the opportunity, let
us seize it. By the time the chain of
claws plates reaches yonder corner,
most of us will have performed our
work on earth, for better or for worse.
Let us hope that the record of our
work will cause the graduates of that
distant day no regret, that no single
failure shall mar the record of the
class of 1910, that the class roll, which
in a few moments is to be sealed be
neath the pavement, will be an un
broken roll of honor. So today, proud
of the past and sanguine of the future,
as spokesman of 1910, I commit to
Stanford this lasting token of our ap
preciation and cooperative pledge of
fealty to the principles of democracy
taught at her shrine."
Many Seniors gathered in the Uni
versity Chapel last Friday morning in
the last meeting that the Class of 1910
will hold as an organization of under
graduates. The program for the morn
ing consisted in the usual reading of
the class documents, including the his
tory, the will and an informal talk by
Class President L. S. Scott.
President Scott spoke first to his
classmates in the following manner:
"Dr. Jordan and Fellow Classmen: —
Class spirit should be felt at its high
est during this space of time when we
meet lastly as an organized body of a
student body.
Four years we have been carrying
along the fortunes of 1910 in various
activities. Dramatics, athletics, for
ensics, the social life, and various
other forms of activities outside of the
usual pursuit of knowledge have
bound us together as a unit.
Friendships have been made out of
these activities which will be highly
valued throughout life. In return we
should give something to our Alma
Mater which has made possible all
these things. No higher or nobler
aim could be set before every alumnus
for repaying this institution for these
priviliges it has afforded us than the
advancement of the University. An
active interest now and then is what
is due from every graduate member of
the Class of 1910.
Our class has had a magnificent
history during the past 4 years and I
sincerely hope that every name upon
its role will be just as successful in
the future."
W. P. Fuller, Jr. Reads History.
"W. P. Fuller, Jr., next read the
following class history;
Mr.President, Classmates and Friends:
Some four years ago a curious ag
gregation of erstwhile high school
students, leaving the paternal roof
and the maternal apron string that
they might pursue wisdom with the
more seriousness, came nuto Stanford.
The remnants of that same curious
aggregation (remnants —for stormy
has been the voyage) are now confi
dently awaiting the end, having pur
sued the aforementioned wisdom with
the requisite vigor. Put they leave
Stanford only after endeavoring to
serve the University as every true
son should serve his Alma Mater. The
men and women of 1910 have done
their duty as members of the Univer
sity and of the Student Body; and this
in spite of many discouraging condi
tions which have confronted them
spasmodically in the past four years.
Nineteen Ten early presaged a spirit
of strength and ingenuity, two at
tributes which have ever marked the
achievements of the Class. From the
moment of the adoption of a Freshman
cap to the formation of an entirely
new arrangement of Commencement
week events, the present Seniors have
constantly changed, modified and bet

tered previously existing conditions
which failed to suit them.
As Freshmen, Nineteen Ten were
successful from the Intercollegiate
point of view only in the regatta, but
her men were at work in every field
of activity, laying that solid basis
which in the future was to give the
class such decided pre-eminence.
It was in our Sophomore year that
the star of Nineteen Ten began to
shine with ominous brightness. The
Class fifteen won the first of its three
Rugby championships, and we are
prone to believe that only the ab
sense of an interclass series in 1906
prevented Nineteen Ten from record
ing a fourth victory. By the end of
1907 four members of the Class had
already earned Varsity "S's" in foot
ball; they were the future Rugby cap
tain, Mitchell; the future baseball cap
tain, Ganong; the future crew captain,
Reynolds; and the future All-Ameri
can player, Louis Cheda. Since then
the football "S" has been given to
Fitting, Cook, Faulkner, and our all
round wonder, Scott. As much to
these men as to any does Stanford owe
her three Varsity football victories dur
ing the life of Rugby and of Nineteen
Ten.
On the track, the four-time point
winners, Scott and Poor, with Captain
elect Rellah and Reed, Martin, Hel*-
ley and Shelton, have joined forces
with the other classes to make three
out of the last four track meets glor
ious events for the Cardinal. Scott,
Bellah, Martin and Maundrell have
won points for Stanford at meets of
the "Western Conference Association.
Nineteen Ten may boast of such for
midable Varsity ball-tossers as Mitch
ell, Ganong, Reed, Scott, Gore, Coch
ran and the slugging McFadden, while
Reynolds, Patrick, Huston, Malone,
Benson, Vose, Wilde, Fitting and Rob
erts championed the Class on the 1
water.
Our tennis cracks have been Henry,
Mann and Jordan.
Tn these five branches of sport. Nine
teen Ten is fortunate enough to claim ,
ten Varsity captains: Mitchell in foot
ball; Scott and Bellah in track; Can- j
ong and Reed in baseball; Reynolds, j
Patrick and TJuston in boating; and j
Mann and Henry in tennis. Such a'
record is unprecedented.
.Tust as Nineteen Seven had their |
Presley, Nineteen Eight their Fenton,
1900 their Crawford, so have Nineteen
Ten their Scott. But Leland Stanford
Scott is famed in three branches of
athletics and boasts a world's record,
while but two sports attracted either
of the three former heroes. Scott is
the most versatile of all Stanford ath
letes.
Nineteen Ten have accomplished
just hs much in non-athletic activities.
We have had more editors than other
classes with Hails, Adams, TJndauer,
Leaf, Fisk, Fuller and Morgan. We
have the best debater of this and many
other college generations, .T. Errett

Shelton, ably seconded by Batkin and
Morgan. We have more people prom
inent in dramatics than any previous
class, for Nineteen Ten claims the
former Miss Ozier, Miss Howell, Miss
Wright, De Bolt, Pettigrew, Thompson,
Fuller, Mnnier and, to again repeat,
Morgan. Without hesitation we say
that she whom we all know as Miss
Ozier is the most accomplished ama
teur actress ever enrolled at Stanford.
Erhorn, De Bolt and Happy, as yell
leaders, have maintained the reputa
tion of the Class. That we are able to
conduct our Senior Week with the pay
ment of merely a nominal assessment
is due only to the frenzied machina
tions of as interested a worker as a
class could ever possess, Herman Rit
tigstein. In every field the men of
Nineteen Ten are to be found actively
and creditably engaged.
And likewise the women ! Besides
those mentioned in connection with
dramatics, the Misses James, Metzner,
Park, Bundy, Hayward and Palmer
have each done far more than her
share.
Nineteen Ten has been in the front
of happenings unusual as well as us
ual. The 1908 Peerade found many
Sophomores in its midst, as did the
various documents soon after issued
by the Commttee on Student Affairs.
Nineteen Ten introduced the first sen
sible system of Quad control. We gave
the greatest and last of the great Plug
Uglies, and until reading the 1911
Quad, we were of the impression that
success bad been ours in the Plug
Ugly of this year. We must have been
in error, however, for in that book we
are told that "never once did the
Juniors stop until they had put out
everybody, even to the lights on the
Quad." We apologize for our mis
taken belief. Nineteen Ten have also
seen the beginnings of the Stanford
Union and have aided materially in
the cause.
Hut perhaps the field in which our
superiority is the most wonderful and
unique has not as yet been mentioned.
So attractive are the maids of Nine
teen Ten that numberless stern men
have forsaken possibly three square
meals a day, as well ps bachelordoru,
in order to avoid all risk of loss. Mat
rimonially, we can have no rival.
During our last few months unfor
tunate dissension has spread among
us. It has served, however, only to
emphasize the strength and force of
our leaders. That the trouble unjustly
took from Nineteen Ten one of her
finest sons is the saddest fact which
we have to record.
Yet despite peerades, Plugs and pol
itics a goodly number of us have sur
vived. We look upon a Stanford diff
erent from that which we saw upon
our entrance: different because of
che way in which we view it; different
in and of itself. Perhaps our ideas
are not one as to which is the better.
Yet when all is done, both will be
good to look back upon.

S. A. Linda nor Gives Oration.
Upon the conclusion of services
in the Chapel, the 1910 plate was dedi
cated in the Inner Quadrangle with
appropriate services. S. A. Lindauer
delivered the Class Oration at this
time and in the course of his speech
said :
"Dr. Jordan, Classmates and Friends :
With a purpose similar to that of
fifteen preceding classes, we gather
here today, under the maternal shad
ows of the Memorial Church, to dedi
cate the class plate. And, as was the
case with our predecessors, the count
less pleasant memories which crowd
our minds are saddened only by the
realization that as a class we must
henceforth be widely scattered in our
chosen fields of endeavor. In laying
this plate the Class of 1910 is perform
ing its last official function as a uni
versity entity. It is awarding the cov
eted class numerals for the last time.
Not, it is true, to those doughty sons
who have successfully upheld the su
premacy of 1910 on field and rostrum,
not to athletes or debators, but rather
to the most faithful servant of all —to
our Alma Mater. Of the four years
that we have spent under her tutelage
we may truly say that "our lines have
fallen in pleasant places." We have
in that period resided within the en
chanted confines of the "red-tiled prin

"W. P. Fuller, Jr., next read the
following class history;
Mr.President, Classmates and Friends:
Some four years ago a curious ag
gregation of erstwhile high school
students, leaving the paternal roof
and the maternal apron string that

The remnants of that same curious

these men as to any does Stanford owe
her three Varsity football victories dur
ing the life of Rugby and of Nineteen
Ten.
On the track, the four-time point
winners, Scott and Poor, with Captain
elect Rellah and Reed, Martin, Hel*-
ley and Shelton, have joined forces
with the other classes to make three
out of the last four track meets glor
ious events for the Cardinal. Scott,
Bellah, Martin and Maundrell have
won points for Stanford at meets of
the "Western Conference Association.
Nineteen Ten may boast of such for
midable Varsity ball-tossers as Mitch
ell, Ganong, Reed, Scott, Gore, Coch
ran and the slugging McFadden, while
Reynolds, Patrick, Huston, Malone,
Benson, Vose, Wilde, Fitting and Rob
erts championed the Class on the 1
water.
Our tennis cracks have been Henry,
Mann and Jordan.
Tn these five branches of sport. Nine
teen Ten is fortunate enough to claim ,
ten Varsity captains: Mitchell in foot
ball; Scott and Bellah in track; Can- j
ong and Reed in baseball; Reynolds, j
Patrick and TJuston in boating; and j
Mann and Henry in tennis. Such a'
record is unprecedented.
.Tust as Nineteen Seven had their |
Presley, Nineteen Eight their Fenton,
1900 their Crawford, so have Nineteen
Ten their Scott. But Leland Stanford
Scott is famed in three branches of
athletics and boasts a world's record,
while but two sports attracted either
of the three former heroes. Scott is
the most versatile of all Stanford ath
letes.
Nineteen Ten have accomplished
just hs much in non-athletic activities.
We have had more editors than other
classes with Hails, Adams, TJndauer,
Leaf, Fisk, Fuller and Morgan. We
have the best debater of this and many
other college generations, .T. Errett

Shelton, ably seconded by Batkin and
Morgan. We have more people prom
inent in dramatics than any previous
class, for Nineteen Ten claims the
former Miss Ozier, Miss Howell, Miss
Wright, De Bolt, Pettigrew, Thompson,
Fuller, Mnnier and, to again repeat,
Morgan. Without hesitation we say
that she whom we all know as Miss
Ozier is the most accomplished ama
teur actress ever enrolled at Stanford.
Erhorn, De Bolt and Happy, as yell
leaders, have maintained the reputa
tion of the Class. That we are able to
conduct our Senior Week with the pay
ment of merely a nominal assessment
is due only to the frenzied machina
tions of as interested a worker as a
class could ever possess, Herman Rit
tigstein. In every field the men of
Nineteen Ten are to be found actively
and creditably engaged.
And likewise the women ! Besides
those mentioned in connection with
dramatics, the Misses James, Metzner,
Park, Bundy, Hayward and Palmer
have each done far more than her
share.
Nineteen Ten has been in the front
of happenings unusual as well as us
ual. The 1908 Peerade found many
Sophomores in its midst, as did the
various documents soon after issued
by the Commttee on Student Affairs.
Nineteen Ten introduced the first sen
sible system of Quad control. We gave
the greatest and last of the great Plug
Uglies, and until reading the 1911
Quad, we were of the impression that
success bad been ours in the Plug
Ugly of this year. We must have been
in error, however, for in that book we
are told that "never once did the
Juniors stop until they had put out
everybody, even to the lights on the
Quad." We apologize for our mis
taken belief. Nineteen Ten have also
seen the beginnings of the Stanford
Union and have aided materially in
the cause.
Hut perhaps the field in which our
superiority is the most wonderful and
unique has not as yet been mentioned.
So attractive are the maids of Nine
teen Ten that numberless stern men
have forsaken possibly three square
meals a day, as well ps bachelordoru,
in order to avoid all risk of loss. Mat
rimonially, we can have no rival.
During our last few months unfor
tunate dissension has spread among
us. It has served, however, only to
emphasize the strength and force of
our leaders. That the trouble unjustly
took from Nineteen Ten one of her
finest sons is the saddest fact which
we have to record.
Yet despite peerades, Plugs and pol
itics a goodly number of us have sur
vived. We look upon a Stanford diff
erent from that which we saw upon
our entrance: different because of
che way in which we view it; different
in and of itself. Perhaps our ideas
are not one as to which is the better.
Yet when all is done, both will be
good to look back upon.

S. A. Linda nor Gives Oration.
Upon the conclusion of services
in the Chapel, the 1910 plate was dedi
cated in the Inner Quadrangle with
appropriate services. S. A. Lindauer
delivered the Class Oration at this
time and in the course of his speech
said :
"Dr. Jordan, Classmates and Friends :
With a purpose similar to that of
fifteen preceding classes, we gather
here today, under the maternal shad
ows of the Memorial Church, to dedi
cate the class plate. And, as was the
case with our predecessors, the count
less pleasant memories which crowd
our minds are saddened only by the
realization that as a class we must
henceforth be widely scattered in our
chosen fields of endeavor. In laying
this plate the Class of 1910 is perform
ing its last official function as a uni
versity entity. It is awarding the cov
eted class numerals for the last time.
Not, it is true, to those doughty sons
who have successfully upheld the su
premacy of 1910 on field and rostrum,
not to athletes or debators, but rather
to the most faithful servant of all —to
our Alma Mater. Of the four years
that we have spent under her tutelage
we may truly say that "our lines have
fallen in pleasant places." We have
in that period resided within the en
chanted confines of the "red-tiled prin
cipality," oblivious to the cares and ex
acting conventions of the outside
world. In this most democratic of all
democratic amtospheres we have dwelt
as fellow students, imbibing zealously
the Stanford Spirit and drinking deep
of Stanford ideals. More or less per
sistently, as the case may be, we have
penetrated the vast storehouse of
knowledge which these expansive
monuments of Spanish architecture
concretely represent. We have en
joyed to the utmost the pleasures of
student life. Thrice have we seen vic
tory perch 011 Cardinal banners in
football in track, in crew and in Car
not contests; twice have we seen base
ball series emblazoned in Cardinal
hue. And our pride in these successes
Avas accentuated by the share our
classmates played in their attainment.
Tt has, indeed, been a rare privilege
to bask in the sunshine of Stanford
life with all that this implies. The
California skies, the hills, the lake,
the fields, the breath of the free out
doors, all conspire to make student
life here in the glorious Santa Clara
Valley a peerless heritage. And the
glow of good fellowship, the sincere
spirit of friendship, the deep seated
democracy—where else can these be
found as they exist with us at Stan
ford ?
And now, my classmates, this func
tion signalizes the culmination of our
college existence. Varied explana
tions have been worked out by my
forerunners as to the meaning of the
ceremony. To me there is little room
for doubt as to its true interpretation.
It provides a lofty eminence from
which we can soberly gaze in retro
spect upon the four years now draw
ing to a close. More than that, it af
fords a common starting point from
which all 1910 men and women may
begin their worldly careers with com
mon ideals, where hopes and aspira
tions to live clean, practical lives are
still unsullied by the sordid experi
ences of the larger world. Here and
now we must raise high our ambitions
to be unselfishly useful to our fellows.
Here and now we must strengthen our
purpose to actively perpetuate the
immortal principles upon which our
democracy rests.
Concerning the past I feel safe in
saying that we have left a favorable
impress upon Stanford life. Can we
do as well in the future ? What will
be the character of our influence on
American life? Shall we, standing
here today with heads held high and
consciences uncorrupted by the al
luring temptations of tomorrow, con
tinue to hold heads high and to main
tain consciences uncorrupted? Or,
as so many others have done before,
shall we lose these Cardinal Stanford
attributes in the mad rush for material
prosperity? However we may answer
these queires, this little coppe'r tablet
at our feet is placed here today as an
eternal reminder of the part that the
members of 1910 have played, in col
lege and out, in the world's progress.
Let us see to it that it symbolizes ser
vice to humanity.
And before embarking on our life's
work it is well that we should pause
for a moment to consider the duty of
college graduates in American life in
the light of the training which they
have received. For four years we
have devoted ourselves to the acquisi
tion of an education. But how useless
is the possession of mere knowledge
unless it is employed as a virile and
positive force upon the side of right,
truth and a progressive civilization.
And I believe that we of 1910 can jus
tify our education only by pointing the
way in the great struggle now going
on, a struggle that dates from the
dawn of history, a struggle that must
ultimately termirate in the triumph of
Utopian ideals. Tiie battle for human
equality and liberty is ceaseless, and
it devolves upon us as college men and
women to unite ourselves upon the
progressive side. Equality before the
law is the battle cry of our day. We
Americans are just beginning to real
ize that bad laws in the hands of good
men are preferable to good laws in the
hands of bad men. Men, not meas
ures, is our need. The historic fight
of the "Insurgents" in our degenerate
national legislature, seemingly hope
less a few shorts months ago, yet to
day fast assuming the proportions of
a stampede towards a regenerated
body politic; the commentaries of Col
orado's famous juvenile judge; the
relentless crusade of the "National
Weekly" and other unbought journals;
the temporarily unappreciated efforts
of San Francisco's irrepressible prose
cutor, greater than ever in defeat; the
uncompromising non-partizan attitude
of Roosevelt, Bryan, La Follette and
other great leaders of the day; all
these are but evidences of an awak
ened public conscience, of the great
struggle now being waged, largely by
college men, in a mighty effort to free
the nation from the clutches of or
ganized greed. Just as the Revolu
tionary and Civil Wars were but re
curring instances of the never ending
struggle for just and human living
conditions, so is this but another com

pelling instance. It differs only in
this, that it is a mental liberation. In
the words of Dr. Scherer: "Roose
velt of Harvard is there, Pinchot of
Yale is there and, paraphrasing slight
ly, there is room for 1910 of Stanford
beside them!"
I have just said that college men are
foremost in this great movement. Yet,
truth compels a supplementary state
ment: college men are likewise the
leaders of the vicious opposition. Per
haps, Judge Llndsey's assertion that
"the universities are turning out more
criminals than the prisons" is not
literally true. Still, the actual con
dition is one which 1910 should do its
share in eradicating. And in urging
j you to this task, I do not mean to min
j imize its difficulties. The scorn of the
I smug gentleman in broadcloth, the
ridicule of the subsidized press, os
tracism from the higher circles of so
ciety and clubdom, poverty, oblivion,
yes, even assassination may be your
reward. Heney's and Lindsey's re
ward has come in this wise. The
world is alive with bullies, physical
and mental. If mental browbeating, if
inspired verbal onslaughts, do not curb
the expressions of honest opinions, the
genteel bully of today will scarcely
hesitate at personal violence. But,
will we college men and women cower
before such obstacles, will we accept
defeat at the hands of the "Beast,"
when the future of the nation lies at
stake? I think not. Vain should be
the labor of those who seek to deter
1910 men from this duty. Certainly,
when the slogan "it hurts business"
supplants "it hurts the nation," when
Woodrow Wilson and Judge Lindsev
charge the churches with becoming the
haven of the despoilers of our national
birthright, when the all powerful press
becomes the mouthpiece of special
privilege, and when even the universi
ties turn from the people to their op
pressors for support, there is work
for you and me to do. Surely the
election of McCarthy—a standing men
ace to the future of San Francisco, and
a disgrace to American politics—to
gether with the removal of Pinchot,
are clarion blasts that call the college
man to action on behalf of higher
standards of life in city, instate and in
nation. The church, the school and
the press should be the greatest mod
ern factors in the attainment of true
democracy, and they can best be re
turned to the side of decency by a
trained patriotic leadership of college
men. Shall we shirk the responsibil
ity ? Accepting it, we can continue to
hold our heads high and keep our
consciences clear. We can then ignore
the slurs and slanders of petty people
on the realization that we have done
our duty to university and country.
In the words of the great emancipator:
"Let us have faith that right makes
might, and in that faith, let us, to the
end, dare to do our duty as we under
stand it.'
Thus beholding the opportunity, let
us seize it. By the time the chain of
claws plates reaches yonder corner,
most of us will have performed our
work on earth, for better or for worse.
Let us hope that the record of our
work will cause the graduates of that
distant day no regret, that no single
failure shall mar the record of the
class of 1910, that the class roll, which
in a few moments is to be sealed be
neath the pavement, will be an un
broken roll of honor. So today, proud
of the past and sanguine of the future,
as spokesman of 1910, I commit to
Stanford this lasting token of our ap
preciation and cooperative pledge of
fealty to the principles of democracy
taught at her shrine."
