# Nineteenth Commencement Is Marked by Impressive Services
## Many Students are Granted Degrees in Assembly Hall this Morning With Appropriate Ceremonies 
### 
With an appropirate program of
exercises, which included two force
ful speeches, the graduating members
of the Senior Class this morning re
ceived their various degrees. The or
chestra was present and contributed
numbers for the program.
President W. F. Slocum, of the
Colorado College, delivered the Com
mencement address, choosing for the
subject of his speech, "The Nation's
Guarantee of Personal Rights."
In discussing this topic, the speaker
dealt with this question in its broad
est light and showed wherein the re
lation between the nation and the in
dividual lay and also where the two
were affected by this relation.
In addressing the graduating class,
President Jordan spoke at length upon
the topic "The Wealth of Nations" in
which he said:
"Not long ago died, in Washington,
Simon Newcomb, astronomer and phil
osopher. It was said of him, 'He left
a record wholly blameless and wholly
salutary, whose work added to the per
manent wealth of nations.'
"At the same time died Edward H.
Harriman, promoter and financier,
likewise great, and likewise effective,
whose life and work added largely to
our nation's wealth.
"But the riches they produced were
not like in kind. The permanent
wealth of nations, like the Kingdom of
God, another name for the same thing,
is within ourselves. It is not meas
ured by outside accumulations.
"The activities of the scholar, the
clear-headed, broad-minded man of
science, have added to the permanent
achievement of the human race. Men
know and think more clearly, because
Simon Newcomb thought clearly. Men
act more wisely because • they think
more clearly; and all this because
Simon Newcomb was wise, courageous
and productive. We are all the better
off, more or less, for his life, and this
in proportion to the loftiness of our
own ideals, and the degree in whicn
our lives have come into contact with
his work.
"Harriman was a wise man too. He
saw ends from the beginning, and he
achieved the results he aimed for. He
had his reward. He made the de
spised Union Pacific and the abused
Southern Pacific a continuous and
valuable piece of property. He added
to his own wealth, to the wealth of
the railroad, to the wealth of various
associations, and incidentally to the
wealth or at least to the early develop
ment of a large part of the great west.
"In part, this would have come with
out him, in a sooner or later time. In
larger part, it is a matter of absolute
indifference to the human race wheth
er it ever came or not. In other words,
in those matters in which "the per
manent wealth of nations" is con
cerned, in the long future of mental
and spiritual development, the name of
Harriman finds no place. The name of
Newcomb in the same connection will

stand in large letters among those who
by life and influence have made this a
broader and a better world, or who
have helped ns to see better what a
broad and beautiful world this really
is. We may easily conceive that In the
next generation the name of Harriman
will be chiefly remembered, not for his
wealth nor his mastery of railroads,
but rather for the noble record left by
the scientific observers who took part
in the Harriman Expedition to Alaska.
In like fashion the time will come
when the name of Carnegie will not
be associated with steel and iron, and
even that of Rockefeller will not sug
gest Standard Oil or the Association
of Monopolies. The Carnegie Institu
tion and the Carnegie Foundation will
outlast these things, and the Rocke
feller Institute for Medical Research
represents one of the wisest and most
far- reaching uses to which any man's
money can ever be put.
"This discussion may serve as a
text for the thesis, that there are now,
and always have been, all over the
civilized world, men who add to the
permanent wealth of nations, their
intellectual and moral resources, and
the extension of sanity, of cleanliness
and of justice. It goes without saying
that the men who accomplish these
results do not work for money. They
do not work for self alone, nor for
immediate results. Their's is the far
future, the future which comes it may
be long after the workers are them
selves forgotten. In their work they
find their own reward. And a second
thesis is this, that men of this type,
now and ever, outweigh in influence
the other types of men. In the endless
struggle which humanity has had
against caste and privilege, against
plunder and injustice, the man who
works for the larger and wins always
the final success. It may not appear
so today nor tomorrow, nor at the end
of the century, nor at this or any other
stage of the game—but the game is not
yet finished.
"All the acquisitions of man. Emer
son tells us, "are the victories of the
good brain and the brave heart. The
world belongs to the energetic, be
longs to the wise. It is in vain to
make a paradise but for good men.'
"In God's world, those efforts only
last which meet with his august ap
proval. In other words, that which
endures is that which deserves to en
dure, because it helps In the conduct of
life. What man can accomplish must
be wrought on his fellowman. Only
man is plastic in man's hands. The
Universe is too big for us: the tough
old world has held its way for cen
turies of eons. We can neither make
it nor mar it. Wave and storm, sun
shine and song, tornado and torrent,
comet and earthquake, all these things
will take care of themselves. Life is
the only material our hands are strong
enough to hold. The only permanent
mark we can make is on the lives of
men. Whatever makes men better,
stronger, saner, more just, more gentle

and more happy, this is what counts, j
This is all that can add to "the per
manent wealth of nations."
"When they hung John Brown fifty ,
years ago, man blamed him for re
sisting the power of the law, throwing j
away his life and getting nothing for
it. He could not, as Thoreau said at
the time, 'get even a vote of thanks or
a pair of boots for doing this.' 'He
could not get four and sixpence a day
for being hung, take the year around.'
But John Brown was not looking for
a vote of thanks. It was not for four
and sixpence a day that he stood be
tween force and its helpless victims.
It was to illuminate the nature of
slavery. It was to help his fellow
citizens to read the story of their in
stitutions in the light of history. 'You
can get more,' Thoreau goes on to say, 1
'in your market (at Concord) for a;
quart of milk than you can jet for a
quart of blood, but yours is not the !
market heores carry their blood to.' ;
The great, the strong, the sane, the
pure, those who have ennobled our
race by being part of it, have not been
paid by the day or by the quart, not by
riches, nor fame nor, power, nor any
thing that man can give. The tragedy
of St. Helena lay not in the failure of
gigantic plans, the collapse of em
pire, but in the futility of the aim to
which effort was directed. The story
of Harper's Ferry, the body moulder
ing while the soul goes marching on,
is not recorded in history as tragedy.
"It is said that Alexander sighed for
more worlds to conquer, when he had
subdued his ill-armed neighbors in a
little corner of the earth. Other worlds
lay all about, and he knew nothing of
their existence. The secrets of the
rocks he had never suspected. TTe had
no curiosity for the movements of the
stars. The mystery of Life—its end
less variety, its perennial unity—were
no more to him than to a jackal.
Steam, electricity, the growth of
trees, the marvel of human conscious
ness, all these had no existence to
Alexander the Great. The only con
quest he knew—that of men's bodies —
went but a little way. The great
world of men, even in his day, was be
yond his knowledge. The great ac
tual universe, the heavens that declare
the glory of God, lay about him in
majestic invisibility. His world was a
very small one, and he had done but a
very petty thing in a very little corner.
"The demand for more worlds to
conquer is not a sign of greatness. It
is the stamp of Ignorance. It is a
mark of provinciality. It indicates
that nothing worth while is yet ac
complished. There is always enough
that a man can do. 'There is always
room for the man of force, and he
makes room for many.' No Lincoln
ever sighed for more nations to save
and to unify; no Luther for more
churches to purify; no Darwin that,
nature had no more hidden secrets for
him to probe to their depths; no
Agassiz for a broader universe in
which to trace the thoughts of God.

"In test of these propositions on the
practical side, we may look over the
history of our own country in search
of the names of men whose total in
fluence has been a civilizing power,
whose lives have added to the only
permanent wealth of nations.' It is
not hard to find such names. Many of
them have been recorded in large let
ters on the pages of our history. Cities
have been named for these in public
life. Counties instate after state re
cord the names of Washington, Frank
lin, Adams, Jefferson, Hamilton, Han
cock, Jay, Monroe, Marshall, Carroll,
Clinton, Henry, Randolph, Madison
and the rest, down to Lincoln, wisest
of all, after whom the roll of the
counties is full. Each of these names
represents some addition, large or
small, to the development of demo
cracy, to the permanent wealth of
nations.
There is an ingenious and useful
book, called "Who's Who in America,"
which gives us each year the names
and a short history of some thousands
of men in the republic who have ac
quired temporary or permanent note
or notoriety, or who have added some
thing worth while to the permanent
wealth of nations. Some among these
have been merely caught in the flitting
lime light. Others have a single talent
of such a character as to have at
tracted their neighbor's attention. But
besides these thousands in "Who's
Who" we know that hundreds of thou
sands of others, equally worthy in the
aggregate, are going their way, un
heralded and unnoticed save to those
with whom they have close personal
relations. These men, who are not
"who" who fill no place in the bio
graphical dictionaries, who stir no
patriotic pride when their names are
called—they are the substance of our
nation, the units of which civilization
is built. And so long as these units
are sound, we need have no fear for
the future of the republic, built of such
materials. All of these are potential
heroes: any one of these may at some
time stand out from his fellows so as
to catch the world's eye. But whether
this shall happen or not, each man
who holds his place, who does his own
part without shirking, without over
reaching, has helped to clinch the
future of democracy, and in his degree
has added something to the permanent
wealth of nations. And of like sub
stance with these common men, are
those of larger grasp and keener in
telligence, who form the natural lead
ers, the scientific experts of enlight
ened democracy.
We of today are building on the
work of those who went before. We
enter into their labors and their pos
sibilities are our actualities. For the
men of the past century, there is i.o
"Who's Who" to point out whom we
should praise, admire or emulate. Just
now we are having a peculiar revival
of interest in their various careers and
in their many lines of work.
A gift has been made to the Univer
sity of the City of New York, of a hall
of fame, whereon each panel shall be
inscribed with the name of a great
American. These are chosen from
among those no longer living, by the
franchise of a hundred electors, still
living, each elector vouched for by the
editor of "Who's Who."
The Hall of Fame is described as a
"colonnade five hundred feet in length
looking towards the Palisades and the
Harlem River Valleys. The exclu
sive use of the Colonnade is to serve
as a hall of fame for great Americans.
One hundred and fifty panels will be
provided for inscriptions. Fifty of
these were to be inscribed in 1900,
provided fifty names shall be approved
by the two bodies of judges. At the
close of every five years thereafter,
five additional panels will be provided
so that the entire number may be com
pleted by A. D. 2000."
"A second general election to fill
the panels left unoccupied takes place
very soon. The field is an open pri
mary, in which the men and women
of the present urge the claims of men
and women of the past. Only a few
names, like those of Washington and
Lincoln, of Emerson and Lowell, of
Agassiz and Audubon, compel the vote
of every elector. For the rest, the
nominations interest us more than the
final election.
"Statesmen in abundance, from the
first to the last, we record, although in
all time and in all lands the existence
of statesmen has been obscured by the
swarm of politicians. They crowd
about the statesman like suckers about
a stalk of corn. The shoot that finally
reaches maturity, that is the real corn
stalk. The public man that lasts, he is
the statesman.
"Our soldiers have been not pro
fessional warriors, who have exalted
their terrible trade. They have been
men of ourselves, men of peace, for
the most part only too glad to escape
from the cruel necessities of fratrici
dal war. And among these north and
south, there are some on whose nobil
ity all electors must agree.
"The longest roll and the one most
typical of America is our list of great
inventors and engineers. The vast re
sources of a new country lead men to
consider how best to make these re-»
sources available. The sons of pio
neers inherit the power of making the
most of themselves and their sur
roundings.
"Take them the A's and B's as they
stand in alphabetical order—Adams,
four of them, the third the greatest,
Alexander, Asbury, Astor, Bache,
Baird, Bancroft, Beaumont, Beecher,
two besides a sister, Benton, Blaine,
Blair, Boone, Booth, Bowdich, Brain
ord, Brewster, Bushnell Bryant, Phil
lips Brooks, and John Brown. The
roll goes on and the history is un
finished, but in the hall of fame of the
past the "Who's Who" of today, and
best of all in the promise of the young
men and young women who are pres
sing on, we find the guarantee of the
strength of the republic, of its share
in the permanent wealth of nations.
"It is no part of my purpose this
morning to discuss the nature of
greatness, or to indicate those men in
any field to whom we should turn in
gratitude or in emulation. I have
wished only to sound a note of hope.
Now and ever, our country has had
her share of men whose lives have
intensified and clarified human know-
ledge, whose example has strength
ened human action. "The permanent
wealth of nations" is growing under
our hands, and it is for us as uni
versity men to do our part in its ex
tension.
"We stand at a turning point in our
political history. Factionalism and
sectionalism have been swallowed up
in the larger concerns of a larger na
tional life. The government by parties,
so long supposed to be a vital neces
sity in free government, is passing
away. In future we shall be governed
by the demands of the Nation. We are
interested not in party success, but in
the welfare of our people. The minor
questions of party advantage, of party
solidarity, of party domination, have
given way to the pressure of national
duties, of national accomplishment,
and the university men of our country
are taking the lead in this beneficent
change. When next they publish the
"Who's Who" in sound patriotism and
good citizenship, may the men of Stan
ford never be found wanting. The
chief needs of our nation today, inso
far as they are related to our govern
ment, may be summed up as these
four: Justice, sanitation, temperance,
peace."

ful speeches, the graduating members

ceived their various degrees. The or

"It is no part of my purpose this
morning to discuss the nature of
greatness, or to indicate those men in
any field to whom we should turn in
gratitude or in emulation. I have
wished only to sound a note of hope.
Now and ever, our country has had
her share of men whose lives have
intensified and clarified human know-
ledge, whose example has strength
ened human action. "The permanent
wealth of nations" is growing under
our hands, and it is for us as uni
versity men to do our part in its ex
tension.
"We stand at a turning point in our
political history. Factionalism and
sectionalism have been swallowed up
in the larger concerns of a larger na
tional life. The government by parties,
so long supposed to be a vital neces
sity in free government, is passing
away. In future we shall be governed
by the demands of the Nation. We are
interested not in party success, but in
the welfare of our people. The minor
questions of party advantage, of party
solidarity, of party domination, have
given way to the pressure of national
duties, of national accomplishment,
and the university men of our country
are taking the lead in this beneficent
change. When next they publish the
"Who's Who" in sound patriotism and
good citizenship, may the men of Stan
ford never be found wanting. The
chief needs of our nation today, inso
far as they are related to our govern
ment, may be summed up as these
four: Justice, sanitation, temperance,
peace."
With an appropirate program of
exercises, which included two force
ful speeches, the graduating members
of the Senior Class this morning re
ceived their various degrees. The or
chestra was present and contributed
numbers for the program.
President W. F. Slocum, of the
Colorado College, delivered the Com
mencement address, choosing for the
subject of his speech, "The Nation's
Guarantee of Personal Rights."
In discussing this topic, the speaker
dealt with this question in its broad
est light and showed wherein the re
lation between the nation and the in
dividual lay and also where the two
were affected by this relation.
In addressing the graduating class,
President Jordan spoke at length upon
the topic "The Wealth of Nations" in
which he said:
"Not long ago died, in Washington,
Simon Newcomb, astronomer and phil
osopher. It was said of him, 'He left
a record wholly blameless and wholly
salutary, whose work added to the per
manent wealth of nations.'
"At the same time died Edward H.
Harriman, promoter and financier,
likewise great, and likewise effective,
whose life and work added largely to
our nation's wealth.
"But the riches they produced were
not like in kind. The permanent
wealth of nations, like the Kingdom of
God, another name for the same thing,
is within ourselves. It is not meas
ured by outside accumulations.
"The activities of the scholar, the
clear-headed, broad-minded man of
science, have added to the permanent
achievement of the human race. Men
know and think more clearly, because
Simon Newcomb thought clearly. Men
act more wisely because • they think
more clearly; and all this because
Simon Newcomb was wise, courageous
and productive. We are all the better
off, more or less, for his life, and this
in proportion to the loftiness of our
own ideals, and the degree in whicn
our lives have come into contact with
his work.
"Harriman was a wise man too. He
saw ends from the beginning, and he
achieved the results he aimed for. He
had his reward. He made the de
spised Union Pacific and the abused
Southern Pacific a continuous and
valuable piece of property. He added
to his own wealth, to the wealth of
the railroad, to the wealth of various
associations, and incidentally to the
wealth or at least to the early develop
ment of a large part of the great west.
"In part, this would have come with
out him, in a sooner or later time. In
larger part, it is a matter of absolute
indifference to the human race wheth
er it ever came or not. In other words,
in those matters in which "the per
manent wealth of nations" is con
cerned, in the long future of mental
and spiritual development, the name of
Harriman finds no place. The name of
Newcomb in the same connection will

stand in large letters among those who
by life and influence have made this a
broader and a better world, or who
have helped ns to see better what a
broad and beautiful world this really
is. We may easily conceive that In the
next generation the name of Harriman
will be chiefly remembered, not for his
wealth nor his mastery of railroads,
but rather for the noble record left by
the scientific observers who took part
in the Harriman Expedition to Alaska.
In like fashion the time will come
when the name of Carnegie will not
be associated with steel and iron, and
even that of Rockefeller will not sug
gest Standard Oil or the Association
of Monopolies. The Carnegie Institu
tion and the Carnegie Foundation will
outlast these things, and the Rocke
feller Institute for Medical Research
represents one of the wisest and most
far- reaching uses to which any man's
money can ever be put.
"This discussion may serve as a
text for the thesis, that there are now,
and always have been, all over the
civilized world, men who add to the
permanent wealth of nations, their
intellectual and moral resources, and
the extension of sanity, of cleanliness
and of justice. It goes without saying
that the men who accomplish these
results do not work for money. They
do not work for self alone, nor for
immediate results. Their's is the far
future, the future which comes it may
be long after the workers are them
selves forgotten. In their work they
find their own reward. And a second
thesis is this, that men of this type,
now and ever, outweigh in influence
the other types of men. In the endless
struggle which humanity has had
against caste and privilege, against
plunder and injustice, the man who
works for the larger and wins always
the final success. It may not appear
so today nor tomorrow, nor at the end
of the century, nor at this or any other
stage of the game—but the game is not
yet finished.
"All the acquisitions of man. Emer
son tells us, "are the victories of the
good brain and the brave heart. The
world belongs to the energetic, be
longs to the wise. It is in vain to
make a paradise but for good men.'
"In God's world, those efforts only
last which meet with his august ap
proval. In other words, that which
endures is that which deserves to en
dure, because it helps In the conduct of
life. What man can accomplish must
be wrought on his fellowman. Only
man is plastic in man's hands. The
Universe is too big for us: the tough
old world has held its way for cen
turies of eons. We can neither make
it nor mar it. Wave and storm, sun
shine and song, tornado and torrent,
comet and earthquake, all these things
will take care of themselves. Life is
the only material our hands are strong
enough to hold. The only permanent
mark we can make is on the lives of
men. Whatever makes men better,
stronger, saner, more just, more gentle

and more happy, this is what counts, j
This is all that can add to "the per
manent wealth of nations."
"When they hung John Brown fifty ,
years ago, man blamed him for re
sisting the power of the law, throwing j
away his life and getting nothing for
it. He could not, as Thoreau said at
the time, 'get even a vote of thanks or
a pair of boots for doing this.' 'He
could not get four and sixpence a day
for being hung, take the year around.'
But John Brown was not looking for
a vote of thanks. It was not for four
and sixpence a day that he stood be
tween force and its helpless victims.
It was to illuminate the nature of
slavery. It was to help his fellow
citizens to read the story of their in
stitutions in the light of history. 'You
can get more,' Thoreau goes on to say, 1
'in your market (at Concord) for a;
quart of milk than you can jet for a
quart of blood, but yours is not the !
market heores carry their blood to.' ;
The great, the strong, the sane, the
pure, those who have ennobled our
race by being part of it, have not been
paid by the day or by the quart, not by
riches, nor fame nor, power, nor any
thing that man can give. The tragedy
of St. Helena lay not in the failure of
gigantic plans, the collapse of em
pire, but in the futility of the aim to
which effort was directed. The story
of Harper's Ferry, the body moulder
ing while the soul goes marching on,
is not recorded in history as tragedy.
"It is said that Alexander sighed for
more worlds to conquer, when he had
subdued his ill-armed neighbors in a
little corner of the earth. Other worlds
lay all about, and he knew nothing of
their existence. The secrets of the
rocks he had never suspected. TTe had
no curiosity for the movements of the
stars. The mystery of Life—its end
less variety, its perennial unity—were
no more to him than to a jackal.
Steam, electricity, the growth of
trees, the marvel of human conscious
ness, all these had no existence to
Alexander the Great. The only con
quest he knew—that of men's bodies —
went but a little way. The great
world of men, even in his day, was be
yond his knowledge. The great ac
tual universe, the heavens that declare
the glory of God, lay about him in
majestic invisibility. His world was a
very small one, and he had done but a
very petty thing in a very little corner.
"The demand for more worlds to
conquer is not a sign of greatness. It
is the stamp of Ignorance. It is a
mark of provinciality. It indicates
that nothing worth while is yet ac
complished. There is always enough
that a man can do. 'There is always
room for the man of force, and he
makes room for many.' No Lincoln
ever sighed for more nations to save
and to unify; no Luther for more
churches to purify; no Darwin that,
nature had no more hidden secrets for
him to probe to their depths; no
Agassiz for a broader universe in
which to trace the thoughts of God.

"In test of these propositions on the
practical side, we may look over the
history of our own country in search
of the names of men whose total in
fluence has been a civilizing power,
whose lives have added to the only
permanent wealth of nations.' It is
not hard to find such names. Many of
them have been recorded in large let
ters on the pages of our history. Cities
have been named for these in public
life. Counties instate after state re
cord the names of Washington, Frank
lin, Adams, Jefferson, Hamilton, Han
cock, Jay, Monroe, Marshall, Carroll,
Clinton, Henry, Randolph, Madison
and the rest, down to Lincoln, wisest
of all, after whom the roll of the
counties is full. Each of these names
represents some addition, large or
small, to the development of demo
cracy, to the permanent wealth of
nations.
There is an ingenious and useful
book, called "Who's Who in America,"
which gives us each year the names
and a short history of some thousands
of men in the republic who have ac
quired temporary or permanent note
or notoriety, or who have added some
thing worth while to the permanent
wealth of nations. Some among these
have been merely caught in the flitting
lime light. Others have a single talent
of such a character as to have at
tracted their neighbor's attention. But
besides these thousands in "Who's
Who" we know that hundreds of thou
sands of others, equally worthy in the
aggregate, are going their way, un
heralded and unnoticed save to those
with whom they have close personal
relations. These men, who are not
"who" who fill no place in the bio
graphical dictionaries, who stir no
patriotic pride when their names are
called—they are the substance of our
nation, the units of which civilization
is built. And so long as these units
are sound, we need have no fear for
the future of the republic, built of such
materials. All of these are potential
heroes: any one of these may at some
time stand out from his fellows so as
to catch the world's eye. But whether
this shall happen or not, each man
who holds his place, who does his own
part without shirking, without over
reaching, has helped to clinch the
future of democracy, and in his degree
has added something to the permanent
wealth of nations. And of like sub
stance with these common men, are
those of larger grasp and keener in
telligence, who form the natural lead
ers, the scientific experts of enlight
ened democracy.
We of today are building on the
work of those who went before. We
enter into their labors and their pos
sibilities are our actualities. For the
men of the past century, there is i.o
"Who's Who" to point out whom we
should praise, admire or emulate. Just
now we are having a peculiar revival
of interest in their various careers and
in their many lines of work.
A gift has been made to the Univer
sity of the City of New York, of a hall
of fame, whereon each panel shall be
inscribed with the name of a great
American. These are chosen from
among those no longer living, by the
franchise of a hundred electors, still
living, each elector vouched for by the
editor of "Who's Who."
The Hall of Fame is described as a
"colonnade five hundred feet in length
looking towards the Palisades and the
Harlem River Valleys. The exclu
sive use of the Colonnade is to serve
as a hall of fame for great Americans.
One hundred and fifty panels will be
provided for inscriptions. Fifty of
these were to be inscribed in 1900,
provided fifty names shall be approved
by the two bodies of judges. At the
close of every five years thereafter,
five additional panels will be provided
so that the entire number may be com
pleted by A. D. 2000."
"A second general election to fill
the panels left unoccupied takes place
very soon. The field is an open pri
mary, in which the men and women
of the present urge the claims of men
and women of the past. Only a few
names, like those of Washington and
Lincoln, of Emerson and Lowell, of
Agassiz and Audubon, compel the vote
of every elector. For the rest, the
nominations interest us more than the
final election.
"Statesmen in abundance, from the
first to the last, we record, although in
all time and in all lands the existence
of statesmen has been obscured by the
swarm of politicians. They crowd
about the statesman like suckers about
a stalk of corn. The shoot that finally
reaches maturity, that is the real corn
stalk. The public man that lasts, he is
the statesman.
"Our soldiers have been not pro
fessional warriors, who have exalted
their terrible trade. They have been
men of ourselves, men of peace, for
the most part only too glad to escape
from the cruel necessities of fratrici
dal war. And among these north and
south, there are some on whose nobil
ity all electors must agree.
"The longest roll and the one most
typical of America is our list of great
inventors and engineers. The vast re
sources of a new country lead men to
consider how best to make these re-»
sources available. The sons of pio
neers inherit the power of making the
most of themselves and their sur
roundings.
"Take them the A's and B's as they
stand in alphabetical order—Adams,
four of them, the third the greatest,
Alexander, Asbury, Astor, Bache,
Baird, Bancroft, Beaumont, Beecher,
two besides a sister, Benton, Blaine,
Blair, Boone, Booth, Bowdich, Brain
ord, Brewster, Bushnell Bryant, Phil
lips Brooks, and John Brown. The
roll goes on and the history is un
finished, but in the hall of fame of the
past the "Who's Who" of today, and
best of all in the promise of the young
men and young women who are pres
sing on, we find the guarantee of the
strength of the republic, of its share
in the permanent wealth of nations.
"It is no part of my purpose this

any field to whom we should turn in
gratitude or in emulation. I have

reaches maturity, that is the real corn
stalk. The public man that lasts, he is
the statesman.
"Our soldiers have been not pro
fessional warriors, who have exalted
their terrible trade. They have been
men of ourselves, men of peace, for
the most part only too glad to escape
from the cruel necessities of fratrici
dal war. And among these north and
south, there are some on whose nobil
ity all electors must agree.
"The longest roll and the one most
typical of America is our list of great
inventors and engineers. The vast re
sources of a new country lead men to
consider how best to make these re-»
sources available. The sons of pio
neers inherit the power of making the
most of themselves and their sur
roundings.
"Take them the A's and B's as they
stand in alphabetical order—Adams,
four of them, the third the greatest,
Alexander, Asbury, Astor, Bache,
Baird, Bancroft, Beaumont, Beecher,
two besides a sister, Benton, Blaine,
Blair, Boone, Booth, Bowdich, Brain
ord, Brewster, Bushnell Bryant, Phil
lips Brooks, and John Brown. The
roll goes on and the history is un
finished, but in the hall of fame of the
past the "Who's Who" of today, and
best of all in the promise of the young
men and young women who are pres
sing on, we find the guarantee of the
strength of the republic, of its share
in the permanent wealth of nations.
"It is no part of my purpose this
morning to discuss the nature of
greatness, or to indicate those men in
any field to whom we should turn in
gratitude or in emulation. I have
wished only to sound a note of hope.
Now and ever, our country has had
her share of men whose lives have
intensified and clarified human know-
ledge, whose example has strength
ened human action. "The permanent
wealth of nations" is growing under
our hands, and it is for us as uni
versity men to do our part in its ex
tension.
"We stand at a turning point in our
political history. Factionalism and
sectionalism have been swallowed up
in the larger concerns of a larger na
tional life. The government by parties,
so long supposed to be a vital neces
sity in free government, is passing
away. In future we shall be governed
by the demands of the Nation. We are
interested not in party success, but in
the welfare of our people. The minor
questions of party advantage, of party
solidarity, of party domination, have
given way to the pressure of national
duties, of national accomplishment,
and the university men of our country
are taking the lead in this beneficent
change. When next they publish the
"Who's Who" in sound patriotism and
good citizenship, may the men of Stan
ford never be found wanting. The
chief needs of our nation today, inso
far as they are related to our govern
ment, may be summed up as these
four: Justice, sanitation, temperance,
peace."
With an appropirate program of
exercises, which included two force
ful speeches, the graduating members
of the Senior Class this morning re
ceived their various degrees. The or
chestra was present and contributed
numbers for the program.
President W. F. Slocum, of the
Colorado College, delivered the Com
mencement address, choosing for the
subject of his speech, "The Nation's
Guarantee of Personal Rights."
In discussing this topic, the speaker
dealt with this question in its broad
est light and showed wherein the re
lation between the nation and the in
dividual lay and also where the two
were affected by this relation.
In addressing the graduating class,
President Jordan spoke at length upon
the topic "The Wealth of Nations" in
which he said:
"Not long ago died, in Washington,
Simon Newcomb, astronomer and phil
osopher. It was said of him, 'He left
a record wholly blameless and wholly
salutary, whose work added to the per
manent wealth of nations.'
"At the same time died Edward H.
Harriman, promoter and financier,
likewise great, and likewise effective,
whose life and work added largely to
our nation's wealth.
"But the riches they produced were
not like in kind. The permanent
wealth of nations, like the Kingdom of
God, another name for the same thing,
is within ourselves. It is not meas
ured by outside accumulations.
"The activities of the scholar, the
clear-headed, broad-minded man of
science, have added to the permanent
achievement of the human race. Men
know and think more clearly, because
Simon Newcomb thought clearly. Men
act more wisely because • they think
more clearly; and all this because
Simon Newcomb was wise, courageous
and productive. We are all the better
off, more or less, for his life, and this
in proportion to the loftiness of our
own ideals, and the degree in whicn
our lives have come into contact with
his work.
"Harriman was a wise man too. He
saw ends from the beginning, and he
achieved the results he aimed for. He
had his reward. He made the de
spised Union Pacific and the abused
Southern Pacific a continuous and
valuable piece of property. He added
to his own wealth, to the wealth of
the railroad, to the wealth of various
associations, and incidentally to the
wealth or at least to the early develop
ment of a large part of the great west.
"In part, this would have come with
out him, in a sooner or later time. In
larger part, it is a matter of absolute
indifference to the human race wheth
er it ever came or not. In other words,
in those matters in which "the per
manent wealth of nations" is con
cerned, in the long future of mental
and spiritual development, the name of
Harriman finds no place. The name of
Newcomb in the same connection will

stand in large letters among those who
by life and influence have made this a
broader and a better world, or who
have helped ns to see better what a
broad and beautiful world this really
is. We may easily conceive that In the
next generation the name of Harriman
will be chiefly remembered, not for his
wealth nor his mastery of railroads,
but rather for the noble record left by
the scientific observers who took part
in the Harriman Expedition to Alaska.
In like fashion the time will come
when the name of Carnegie will not
be associated with steel and iron, and
even that of Rockefeller will not sug
gest Standard Oil or the Association
of Monopolies. The Carnegie Institu
tion and the Carnegie Foundation will
outlast these things, and the Rocke
feller Institute for Medical Research
represents one of the wisest and most
far- reaching uses to which any man's
money can ever be put.
"This discussion may serve as a
text for the thesis, that there are now,
and always have been, all over the
civilized world, men who add to the
permanent wealth of nations, their
intellectual and moral resources, and
the extension of sanity, of cleanliness
and of justice. It goes without saying
that the men who accomplish these
results do not work for money. They
do not work for self alone, nor for
immediate results. Their's is the far
future, the future which comes it may
be long after the workers are them
selves forgotten. In their work they
find their own reward. And a second
thesis is this, that men of this type,
now and ever, outweigh in influence
the other types of men. In the endless
struggle which humanity has had
against caste and privilege, against
plunder and injustice, the man who
works for the larger and wins always
the final success. It may not appear
so today nor tomorrow, nor at the end
of the century, nor at this or any other
stage of the game—but the game is not
yet finished.
"All the acquisitions of man. Emer
son tells us, "are the victories of the
good brain and the brave heart. The
world belongs to the energetic, be
longs to the wise. It is in vain to
make a paradise but for good men.'
"In God's world, those efforts only
last which meet with his august ap
proval. In other words, that which
endures is that which deserves to en
dure, because it helps In the conduct of
life. What man can accomplish must
be wrought on his fellowman. Only
man is plastic in man's hands. The
Universe is too big for us: the tough
old world has held its way for cen
turies of eons. We can neither make
it nor mar it. Wave and storm, sun
shine and song, tornado and torrent,
comet and earthquake, all these things
will take care of themselves. Life is
the only material our hands are strong
enough to hold. The only permanent
mark we can make is on the lives of
men. Whatever makes men better,
stronger, saner, more just, more gentle

and more happy, this is what counts, j
This is all that can add to "the per
manent wealth of nations."
"When they hung John Brown fifty ,
years ago, man blamed him for re
sisting the power of the law, throwing j
away his life and getting nothing for
it. He could not, as Thoreau said at
the time, 'get even a vote of thanks or
a pair of boots for doing this.' 'He
could not get four and sixpence a day
for being hung, take the year around.'
But John Brown was not looking for
a vote of thanks. It was not for four
and sixpence a day that he stood be
tween force and its helpless victims.
It was to illuminate the nature of
slavery. It was to help his fellow
citizens to read the story of their in
stitutions in the light of history. 'You
can get more,' Thoreau goes on to say, 1
'in your market (at Concord) for a;
quart of milk than you can jet for a
quart of blood, but yours is not the !
market heores carry their blood to.' ;
The great, the strong, the sane, the
pure, those who have ennobled our
race by being part of it, have not been
paid by the day or by the quart, not by
riches, nor fame nor, power, nor any
thing that man can give. The tragedy
of St. Helena lay not in the failure of
gigantic plans, the collapse of em
pire, but in the futility of the aim to
which effort was directed. The story
of Harper's Ferry, the body moulder
ing while the soul goes marching on,
is not recorded in history as tragedy.
"It is said that Alexander sighed for
more worlds to conquer, when he had
subdued his ill-armed neighbors in a
little corner of the earth. Other worlds
lay all about, and he knew nothing of
their existence. The secrets of the
rocks he had never suspected. TTe had
no curiosity for the movements of the
stars. The mystery of Life—its end
less variety, its perennial unity—were
no more to him than to a jackal.
Steam, electricity, the growth of
trees, the marvel of human conscious
ness, all these had no existence to
Alexander the Great. The only con
quest he knew—that of men's bodies —
went but a little way. The great
world of men, even in his day, was be
yond his knowledge. The great ac
tual universe, the heavens that declare
the glory of God, lay about him in
majestic invisibility. His world was a
very small one, and he had done but a
very petty thing in a very little corner.
"The demand for more worlds to
conquer is not a sign of greatness. It
is the stamp of Ignorance. It is a
mark of provinciality. It indicates
that nothing worth while is yet ac
complished. There is always enough
that a man can do. 'There is always
room for the man of force, and he
makes room for many.' No Lincoln
ever sighed for more nations to save
and to unify; no Luther for more
churches to purify; no Darwin that,
nature had no more hidden secrets for
him to probe to their depths; no
Agassiz for a broader universe in
which to trace the thoughts of God.

"In test of these propositions on the
practical side, we may look over the
history of our own country in search
of the names of men whose total in
fluence has been a civilizing power,
whose lives have added to the only
permanent wealth of nations.' It is
not hard to find such names. Many of
them have been recorded in large let
ters on the pages of our history. Cities
have been named for these in public
life. Counties instate after state re
cord the names of Washington, Frank
lin, Adams, Jefferson, Hamilton, Han
cock, Jay, Monroe, Marshall, Carroll,
Clinton, Henry, Randolph, Madison
and the rest, down to Lincoln, wisest
of all, after whom the roll of the
counties is full. Each of these names
represents some addition, large or
small, to the development of demo
cracy, to the permanent wealth of
nations.
There is an ingenious and useful
book, called "Who's Who in America,"
which gives us each year the names
and a short history of some thousands
of men in the republic who have ac
quired temporary or permanent note
or notoriety, or who have added some
thing worth while to the permanent
wealth of nations. Some among these
have been merely caught in the flitting
lime light. Others have a single talent
of such a character as to have at
tracted their neighbor's attention. But
besides these thousands in "Who's
Who" we know that hundreds of thou
sands of others, equally worthy in the
aggregate, are going their way, un
heralded and unnoticed save to those
with whom they have close personal
relations. These men, who are not
"who" who fill no place in the bio
graphical dictionaries, who stir no
patriotic pride when their names are
called—they are the substance of our
nation, the units of which civilization
is built. And so long as these units
are sound, we need have no fear for
the future of the republic, built of such
materials. All of these are potential
heroes: any one of these may at some
time stand out from his fellows so as
to catch the world's eye. But whether
this shall happen or not, each man
who holds his place, who does his own
part without shirking, without over
reaching, has helped to clinch the
future of democracy, and in his degree
has added something to the permanent
wealth of nations. And of like sub
stance with these common men, are
those of larger grasp and keener in
telligence, who form the natural lead
ers, the scientific experts of enlight
ened democracy.
We of today are building on the
work of those who went before. We
enter into their labors and their pos
sibilities are our actualities. For the
men of the past century, there is i.o
"Who's Who" to point out whom we
should praise, admire or emulate. Just
now we are having a peculiar revival
of interest in their various careers and
in their many lines of work.
A gift has been made to the Univer
sity of the City of New York, of a hall
of fame, whereon each panel shall be
inscribed with the name of a great
American. These are chosen from
among those no longer living, by the
franchise of a hundred electors, still
living, each elector vouched for by the
editor of "Who's Who."
The Hall of Fame is described as a
"colonnade five hundred feet in length
looking towards the Palisades and the
Harlem River Valleys. The exclu
sive use of the Colonnade is to serve
as a hall of fame for great Americans.
One hundred and fifty panels will be
provided for inscriptions. Fifty of
these were to be inscribed in 1900,
provided fifty names shall be approved
by the two bodies of judges. At the
close of every five years thereafter,
five additional panels will be provided
so that the entire number may be com
pleted by A. D. 2000."
"A second general election to fill
the panels left unoccupied takes place
very soon. The field is an open pri
mary, in which the men and women
of the present urge the claims of men
and women of the past. Only a few
names, like those of Washington and
Lincoln, of Emerson and Lowell, of
Agassiz and Audubon, compel the vote
of every elector. For the rest, the
nominations interest us more than the
final election.
"Statesmen in abundance, from the
first to the last, we record, although in
all time and in all lands the existence
of statesmen has been obscured by the
swarm of politicians. They crowd
about the statesman like suckers about
a stalk of corn. The shoot that finally
reaches maturity, that is the real corn
stalk. The public man that lasts, he is
the statesman.
"Our soldiers have been not pro
fessional warriors, who have exalted
their terrible trade. They have been

dal war. And among these north and

"Take them the A's and B's as they

among those no longer living, by the
franchise of a hundred electors, still
living, each elector vouched for by the
editor of "Who's Who."
The Hall of Fame is described as a
"colonnade five hundred feet in length
looking towards the Palisades and the
Harlem River Valleys. The exclu
sive use of the Colonnade is to serve
as a hall of fame for great Americans.
One hundred and fifty panels will be
provided for inscriptions. Fifty of
these were to be inscribed in 1900,
provided fifty names shall be approved
by the two bodies of judges. At the
close of every five years thereafter,
five additional panels will be provided
so that the entire number may be com
pleted by A. D. 2000."
"A second general election to fill
the panels left unoccupied takes place
very soon. The field is an open pri
mary, in which the men and women
of the present urge the claims of men
and women of the past. Only a few
names, like those of Washington and
Lincoln, of Emerson and Lowell, of
Agassiz and Audubon, compel the vote
of every elector. For the rest, the
nominations interest us more than the
final election.
"Statesmen in abundance, from the
first to the last, we record, although in
all time and in all lands the existence
of statesmen has been obscured by the
swarm of politicians. They crowd
about the statesman like suckers about
a stalk of corn. The shoot that finally
reaches maturity, that is the real corn
stalk. The public man that lasts, he is
the statesman.
"Our soldiers have been not pro
fessional warriors, who have exalted
their terrible trade. They have been
men of ourselves, men of peace, for
the most part only too glad to escape
from the cruel necessities of fratrici
dal war. And among these north and
south, there are some on whose nobil
ity all electors must agree.
"The longest roll and the one most
typical of America is our list of great
inventors and engineers. The vast re
sources of a new country lead men to
consider how best to make these re-»
sources available. The sons of pio
neers inherit the power of making the
most of themselves and their sur
roundings.
"Take them the A's and B's as they
stand in alphabetical order—Adams,
four of them, the third the greatest,
Alexander, Asbury, Astor, Bache,
Baird, Bancroft, Beaumont, Beecher,
two besides a sister, Benton, Blaine,
Blair, Boone, Booth, Bowdich, Brain
ord, Brewster, Bushnell Bryant, Phil
lips Brooks, and John Brown. The
roll goes on and the history is un
finished, but in the hall of fame of the
past the "Who's Who" of today, and
best of all in the promise of the young
men and young women who are pres
sing on, we find the guarantee of the
strength of the republic, of its share
in the permanent wealth of nations.
"It is no part of my purpose this
morning to discuss the nature of
greatness, or to indicate those men in
any field to whom we should turn in
gratitude or in emulation. I have
wished only to sound a note of hope.
Now and ever, our country has had
her share of men whose lives have
intensified and clarified human know-
ledge, whose example has strength
ened human action. "The permanent
wealth of nations" is growing under
our hands, and it is for us as uni
versity men to do our part in its ex
tension.
"We stand at a turning point in our
political history. Factionalism and
sectionalism have been swallowed up
in the larger concerns of a larger na
tional life. The government by parties,
so long supposed to be a vital neces
sity in free government, is passing
away. In future we shall be governed
by the demands of the Nation. We are
interested not in party success, but in
the welfare of our people. The minor
questions of party advantage, of party
solidarity, of party domination, have
given way to the pressure of national
duties, of national accomplishment,
and the university men of our country
are taking the lead in this beneficent
change. When next they publish the
"Who's Who" in sound patriotism and
good citizenship, may the men of Stan
ford never be found wanting. The
chief needs of our nation today, inso
far as they are related to our govern
ment, may be summed up as these
four: Justice, sanitation, temperance,
peace."
With an appropirate program of
exercises, which included two force
ful speeches, the graduating members
of the Senior Class this morning re
ceived their various degrees. The or
chestra was present and contributed
numbers for the program.
President W. F. Slocum, of the
Colorado College, delivered the Com
mencement address, choosing for the
subject of his speech, "The Nation's
Guarantee of Personal Rights."
In discussing this topic, the speaker
dealt with this question in its broad
est light and showed wherein the re
lation between the nation and the in
dividual lay and also where the two
were affected by this relation.
In addressing the graduating class,
President Jordan spoke at length upon
the topic "The Wealth of Nations" in
which he said:
"Not long ago died, in Washington,
Simon Newcomb, astronomer and phil
osopher. It was said of him, 'He left
a record wholly blameless and wholly
salutary, whose work added to the per
manent wealth of nations.'
"At the same time died Edward H.
Harriman, promoter and financier,
likewise great, and likewise effective,
whose life and work added largely to
our nation's wealth.
"But the riches they produced were
not like in kind. The permanent
wealth of nations, like the Kingdom of
God, another name for the same thing,
is within ourselves. It is not meas
ured by outside accumulations.
"The activities of the scholar, the
clear-headed, broad-minded man of
science, have added to the permanent
achievement of the human race. Men
know and think more clearly, because
Simon Newcomb thought clearly. Men
act more wisely because • they think
more clearly; and all this because
Simon Newcomb was wise, courageous
and productive. We are all the better
off, more or less, for his life, and this
in proportion to the loftiness of our
own ideals, and the degree in whicn
our lives have come into contact with
his work.
"Harriman was a wise man too. He
saw ends from the beginning, and he
achieved the results he aimed for. He
had his reward. He made the de
spised Union Pacific and the abused
Southern Pacific a continuous and
valuable piece of property. He added
to his own wealth, to the wealth of
the railroad, to the wealth of various
associations, and incidentally to the
wealth or at least to the early develop
ment of a large part of the great west.
"In part, this would have come with
out him, in a sooner or later time. In
larger part, it is a matter of absolute
indifference to the human race wheth
er it ever came or not. In other words,
in those matters in which "the per
manent wealth of nations" is con
cerned, in the long future of mental
and spiritual development, the name of
Harriman finds no place. The name of
Newcomb in the same connection will

stand in large letters among those who
by life and influence have made this a
broader and a better world, or who
have helped ns to see better what a
broad and beautiful world this really
is. We may easily conceive that In the
next generation the name of Harriman
will be chiefly remembered, not for his
wealth nor his mastery of railroads,
but rather for the noble record left by
the scientific observers who took part
in the Harriman Expedition to Alaska.
In like fashion the time will come
when the name of Carnegie will not
be associated with steel and iron, and
even that of Rockefeller will not sug
gest Standard Oil or the Association
of Monopolies. The Carnegie Institu
tion and the Carnegie Foundation will
outlast these things, and the Rocke
feller Institute for Medical Research
represents one of the wisest and most
far- reaching uses to which any man's
money can ever be put.
"This discussion may serve as a
text for the thesis, that there are now,
and always have been, all over the
civilized world, men who add to the
permanent wealth of nations, their
intellectual and moral resources, and
the extension of sanity, of cleanliness
and of justice. It goes without saying
that the men who accomplish these
results do not work for money. They
do not work for self alone, nor for
immediate results. Their's is the far
future, the future which comes it may
be long after the workers are them
selves forgotten. In their work they
find their own reward. And a second
thesis is this, that men of this type,
now and ever, outweigh in influence
the other types of men. In the endless
struggle which humanity has had
against caste and privilege, against
plunder and injustice, the man who
works for the larger and wins always
the final success. It may not appear
so today nor tomorrow, nor at the end
of the century, nor at this or any other
stage of the game—but the game is not
yet finished.
"All the acquisitions of man. Emer
son tells us, "are the victories of the
good brain and the brave heart. The
world belongs to the energetic, be
longs to the wise. It is in vain to
make a paradise but for good men.'
"In God's world, those efforts only
last which meet with his august ap
proval. In other words, that which
endures is that which deserves to en
dure, because it helps In the conduct of
life. What man can accomplish must
be wrought on his fellowman. Only
man is plastic in man's hands. The
Universe is too big for us: the tough
old world has held its way for cen
turies of eons. We can neither make
it nor mar it. Wave and storm, sun
shine and song, tornado and torrent,
comet and earthquake, all these things
will take care of themselves. Life is
the only material our hands are strong
enough to hold. The only permanent
mark we can make is on the lives of
men. Whatever makes men better,
stronger, saner, more just, more gentle

and more happy, this is what counts, j
This is all that can add to "the per
manent wealth of nations."
"When they hung John Brown fifty ,
years ago, man blamed him for re
sisting the power of the law, throwing j
away his life and getting nothing for
it. He could not, as Thoreau said at
the time, 'get even a vote of thanks or
a pair of boots for doing this.' 'He
could not get four and sixpence a day
for being hung, take the year around.'
But John Brown was not looking for
a vote of thanks. It was not for four
and sixpence a day that he stood be
tween force and its helpless victims.
It was to illuminate the nature of
slavery. It was to help his fellow
citizens to read the story of their in
stitutions in the light of history. 'You
can get more,' Thoreau goes on to say, 1
'in your market (at Concord) for a;
quart of milk than you can jet for a
quart of blood, but yours is not the !
market heores carry their blood to.' ;
The great, the strong, the sane, the
pure, those who have ennobled our
race by being part of it, have not been
paid by the day or by the quart, not by
riches, nor fame nor, power, nor any
thing that man can give. The tragedy
of St. Helena lay not in the failure of
gigantic plans, the collapse of em
pire, but in the futility of the aim to
which effort was directed. The story
of Harper's Ferry, the body moulder
ing while the soul goes marching on,
is not recorded in history as tragedy.
"It is said that Alexander sighed for
more worlds to conquer, when he had
subdued his ill-armed neighbors in a
little corner of the earth. Other worlds
lay all about, and he knew nothing of
their existence. The secrets of the
rocks he had never suspected. TTe had
no curiosity for the movements of the
stars. The mystery of Life—its end
less variety, its perennial unity—were
no more to him than to a jackal.
Steam, electricity, the growth of
trees, the marvel of human conscious
ness, all these had no existence to
Alexander the Great. The only con
quest he knew—that of men's bodies —
went but a little way. The great
world of men, even in his day, was be
yond his knowledge. The great ac
tual universe, the heavens that declare
the glory of God, lay about him in
majestic invisibility. His world was a
very small one, and he had done but a
very petty thing in a very little corner.
"The demand for more worlds to
conquer is not a sign of greatness. It
is the stamp of Ignorance. It is a
mark of provinciality. It indicates
that nothing worth while is yet ac
complished. There is always enough
that a man can do. 'There is always
room for the man of force, and he
makes room for many.' No Lincoln
ever sighed for more nations to save
and to unify; no Luther for more
churches to purify; no Darwin that,
nature had no more hidden secrets for
him to probe to their depths; no
Agassiz for a broader universe in
which to trace the thoughts of God.

"In test of these propositions on the
practical side, we may look over the
history of our own country in search
of the names of men whose total in
fluence has been a civilizing power,
whose lives have added to the only
permanent wealth of nations.' It is
not hard to find such names. Many of
them have been recorded in large let
ters on the pages of our history. Cities
have been named for these in public
life. Counties instate after state re
cord the names of Washington, Frank
lin, Adams, Jefferson, Hamilton, Han
cock, Jay, Monroe, Marshall, Carroll,
Clinton, Henry, Randolph, Madison
and the rest, down to Lincoln, wisest
of all, after whom the roll of the
counties is full. Each of these names
represents some addition, large or
small, to the development of demo
cracy, to the permanent wealth of
nations.
There is an ingenious and useful
book, called "Who's Who in America,"
which gives us each year the names
and a short history of some thousands
of men in the republic who have ac
quired temporary or permanent note
or notoriety, or who have added some
thing worth while to the permanent
wealth of nations. Some among these
have been merely caught in the flitting
lime light. Others have a single talent
of such a character as to have at
tracted their neighbor's attention. But
besides these thousands in "Who's
Who" we know that hundreds of thou
sands of others, equally worthy in the
aggregate, are going their way, un
heralded and unnoticed save to those
with whom they have close personal
relations. These men, who are not
"who" who fill no place in the bio
graphical dictionaries, who stir no
patriotic pride when their names are
called—they are the substance of our
nation, the units of which civilization
is built. And so long as these units
are sound, we need have no fear for
the future of the republic, built of such
materials. All of these are potential
heroes: any one of these may at some
time stand out from his fellows so as
to catch the world's eye. But whether
this shall happen or not, each man
who holds his place, who does his own
part without shirking, without over
reaching, has helped to clinch the
future of democracy, and in his degree
has added something to the permanent
wealth of nations. And of like sub
stance with these common men, are
those of larger grasp and keener in
telligence, who form the natural lead
ers, the scientific experts of enlight
ened democracy.
We of today are building on the
work of those who went before. We
enter into their labors and their pos
sibilities are our actualities. For the
men of the past century, there is i.o
"Who's Who" to point out whom we
should praise, admire or emulate. Just
now we are having a peculiar revival
of interest in their various careers and
in their many lines of work.
A gift has been made to the Univer
sity of the City of New York, of a hall
of fame, whereon each panel shall be
inscribed with the name of a great
American. These are chosen from
among those no longer living, by the
franchise of a hundred electors, still
living, each elector vouched for by the
editor of "Who's Who."
The Hall of Fame is described as a

graphical dictionaries, who stir no
patriotic pride when their names are
called—they are the substance of our
nation, the units of which civilization
is built. And so long as these units
are sound, we need have no fear for
the future of the republic, built of such
materials. All of these are potential
heroes: any one of these may at some
time stand out from his fellows so as
to catch the world's eye. But whether
this shall happen or not, each man
who holds his place, who does his own
part without shirking, without over
reaching, has helped to clinch the
future of democracy, and in his degree
has added something to the permanent
wealth of nations. And of like sub
stance with these common men, are
those of larger grasp and keener in
telligence, who form the natural lead
ers, the scientific experts of enlight
ened democracy.
We of today are building on the
work of those who went before. We
enter into their labors and their pos
sibilities are our actualities. For the
men of the past century, there is i.o
"Who's Who" to point out whom we
should praise, admire or emulate. Just
now we are having a peculiar revival
of interest in their various careers and
in their many lines of work.
A gift has been made to the Univer
sity of the City of New York, of a hall
of fame, whereon each panel shall be
inscribed with the name of a great
American. These are chosen from
among those no longer living, by the
franchise of a hundred electors, still
living, each elector vouched for by the
editor of "Who's Who."
The Hall of Fame is described as a
"colonnade five hundred feet in length
looking towards the Palisades and the
Harlem River Valleys. The exclu
sive use of the Colonnade is to serve
as a hall of fame for great Americans.
One hundred and fifty panels will be
provided for inscriptions. Fifty of
these were to be inscribed in 1900,
provided fifty names shall be approved
by the two bodies of judges. At the
close of every five years thereafter,
five additional panels will be provided
so that the entire number may be com
pleted by A. D. 2000."
"A second general election to fill
the panels left unoccupied takes place
very soon. The field is an open pri
mary, in which the men and women
of the present urge the claims of men
and women of the past. Only a few
names, like those of Washington and
Lincoln, of Emerson and Lowell, of
Agassiz and Audubon, compel the vote
of every elector. For the rest, the
nominations interest us more than the
final election.
"Statesmen in abundance, from the
first to the last, we record, although in
all time and in all lands the existence
of statesmen has been obscured by the
swarm of politicians. They crowd
about the statesman like suckers about
a stalk of corn. The shoot that finally
reaches maturity, that is the real corn
stalk. The public man that lasts, he is
the statesman.
"Our soldiers have been not pro
fessional warriors, who have exalted
their terrible trade. They have been
men of ourselves, men of peace, for
the most part only too glad to escape
from the cruel necessities of fratrici
dal war. And among these north and
south, there are some on whose nobil
ity all electors must agree.
"The longest roll and the one most
typical of America is our list of great
inventors and engineers. The vast re
sources of a new country lead men to
consider how best to make these re-»
sources available. The sons of pio
neers inherit the power of making the
most of themselves and their sur
roundings.
"Take them the A's and B's as they
stand in alphabetical order—Adams,
four of them, the third the greatest,
Alexander, Asbury, Astor, Bache,
Baird, Bancroft, Beaumont, Beecher,
two besides a sister, Benton, Blaine,
Blair, Boone, Booth, Bowdich, Brain
ord, Brewster, Bushnell Bryant, Phil
lips Brooks, and John Brown. The
roll goes on and the history is un
finished, but in the hall of fame of the
past the "Who's Who" of today, and
best of all in the promise of the young
men and young women who are pres
sing on, we find the guarantee of the
strength of the republic, of its share
in the permanent wealth of nations.
"It is no part of my purpose this
morning to discuss the nature of
greatness, or to indicate those men in
any field to whom we should turn in
gratitude or in emulation. I have
wished only to sound a note of hope.
Now and ever, our country has had
her share of men whose lives have
intensified and clarified human know-
ledge, whose example has strength
ened human action. "The permanent
wealth of nations" is growing under
our hands, and it is for us as uni
versity men to do our part in its ex
tension.
"We stand at a turning point in our
political history. Factionalism and
sectionalism have been swallowed up
in the larger concerns of a larger na
tional life. The government by parties,
so long supposed to be a vital neces
sity in free government, is passing
away. In future we shall be governed
by the demands of the Nation. We are
interested not in party success, but in
the welfare of our people. The minor
questions of party advantage, of party
solidarity, of party domination, have
given way to the pressure of national
duties, of national accomplishment,
and the university men of our country
are taking the lead in this beneficent
change. When next they publish the
"Who's Who" in sound patriotism and
good citizenship, may the men of Stan
ford never be found wanting. The
chief needs of our nation today, inso
far as they are related to our govern
ment, may be summed up as these
four: Justice, sanitation, temperance,
peace."
With an appropirate program of
exercises, which included two force
ful speeches, the graduating members
of the Senior Class this morning re
ceived their various degrees. The or
chestra was present and contributed
numbers for the program.
President W. F. Slocum, of the
Colorado College, delivered the Com
mencement address, choosing for the
subject of his speech, "The Nation's
Guarantee of Personal Rights."
In discussing this topic, the speaker
dealt with this question in its broad
est light and showed wherein the re
lation between the nation and the in
dividual lay and also where the two
were affected by this relation.
In addressing the graduating class,
President Jordan spoke at length upon
the topic "The Wealth of Nations" in
which he said:
"Not long ago died, in Washington,
Simon Newcomb, astronomer and phil
osopher. It was said of him, 'He left
a record wholly blameless and wholly
salutary, whose work added to the per
manent wealth of nations.'
"At the same time died Edward H.
Harriman, promoter and financier,
likewise great, and likewise effective,
whose life and work added largely to
our nation's wealth.
"But the riches they produced were
not like in kind. The permanent
wealth of nations, like the Kingdom of
God, another name for the same thing,
is within ourselves. It is not meas
ured by outside accumulations.
"The activities of the scholar, the
clear-headed, broad-minded man of
science, have added to the permanent
achievement of the human race. Men
know and think more clearly, because
Simon Newcomb thought clearly. Men
act more wisely because • they think
more clearly; and all this because
Simon Newcomb was wise, courageous
and productive. We are all the better
off, more or less, for his life, and this
in proportion to the loftiness of our
own ideals, and the degree in whicn
our lives have come into contact with
his work.
"Harriman was a wise man too. He
saw ends from the beginning, and he
achieved the results he aimed for. He
had his reward. He made the de
spised Union Pacific and the abused
Southern Pacific a continuous and
valuable piece of property. He added
to his own wealth, to the wealth of
the railroad, to the wealth of various
associations, and incidentally to the
wealth or at least to the early develop
ment of a large part of the great west.
"In part, this would have come with
out him, in a sooner or later time. In
larger part, it is a matter of absolute
indifference to the human race wheth
er it ever came or not. In other words,
in those matters in which "the per
manent wealth of nations" is con
cerned, in the long future of mental
and spiritual development, the name of
Harriman finds no place. The name of
Newcomb in the same connection will

stand in large letters among those who
by life and influence have made this a
broader and a better world, or who
have helped ns to see better what a
broad and beautiful world this really
is. We may easily conceive that In the
next generation the name of Harriman
will be chiefly remembered, not for his
wealth nor his mastery of railroads,
but rather for the noble record left by
the scientific observers who took part
in the Harriman Expedition to Alaska.
In like fashion the time will come
when the name of Carnegie will not
be associated with steel and iron, and
even that of Rockefeller will not sug
gest Standard Oil or the Association
of Monopolies. The Carnegie Institu
tion and the Carnegie Foundation will
outlast these things, and the Rocke
feller Institute for Medical Research
represents one of the wisest and most
far- reaching uses to which any man's
money can ever be put.
"This discussion may serve as a
text for the thesis, that there are now,
and always have been, all over the
civilized world, men who add to the
permanent wealth of nations, their
intellectual and moral resources, and
the extension of sanity, of cleanliness
and of justice. It goes without saying
that the men who accomplish these
results do not work for money. They
do not work for self alone, nor for
immediate results. Their's is the far
future, the future which comes it may
be long after the workers are them
selves forgotten. In their work they
find their own reward. And a second
thesis is this, that men of this type,
now and ever, outweigh in influence
the other types of men. In the endless
struggle which humanity has had
against caste and privilege, against
plunder and injustice, the man who
works for the larger and wins always
the final success. It may not appear
so today nor tomorrow, nor at the end
of the century, nor at this or any other
stage of the game—but the game is not
yet finished.
"All the acquisitions of man. Emer
son tells us, "are the victories of the
good brain and the brave heart. The
world belongs to the energetic, be
longs to the wise. It is in vain to
make a paradise but for good men.'
"In God's world, those efforts only
last which meet with his august ap
proval. In other words, that which
endures is that which deserves to en
dure, because it helps In the conduct of
life. What man can accomplish must
be wrought on his fellowman. Only
man is plastic in man's hands. The
Universe is too big for us: the tough
old world has held its way for cen
turies of eons. We can neither make
it nor mar it. Wave and storm, sun
shine and song, tornado and torrent,
comet and earthquake, all these things
will take care of themselves. Life is
the only material our hands are strong
enough to hold. The only permanent
mark we can make is on the lives of
men. Whatever makes men better,
stronger, saner, more just, more gentle

and more happy, this is what counts, j
This is all that can add to "the per
manent wealth of nations."
"When they hung John Brown fifty ,
years ago, man blamed him for re
sisting the power of the law, throwing j
away his life and getting nothing for
it. He could not, as Thoreau said at
the time, 'get even a vote of thanks or
a pair of boots for doing this.' 'He
could not get four and sixpence a day
for being hung, take the year around.'
But John Brown was not looking for
a vote of thanks. It was not for four
and sixpence a day that he stood be
tween force and its helpless victims.
It was to illuminate the nature of
slavery. It was to help his fellow
citizens to read the story of their in
stitutions in the light of history. 'You
can get more,' Thoreau goes on to say, 1
'in your market (at Concord) for a;
quart of milk than you can jet for a
quart of blood, but yours is not the !
market heores carry their blood to.' ;
The great, the strong, the sane, the
pure, those who have ennobled our
race by being part of it, have not been
paid by the day or by the quart, not by
riches, nor fame nor, power, nor any
thing that man can give. The tragedy
of St. Helena lay not in the failure of
gigantic plans, the collapse of em
pire, but in the futility of the aim to
which effort was directed. The story
of Harper's Ferry, the body moulder
ing while the soul goes marching on,
is not recorded in history as tragedy.
"It is said that Alexander sighed for
more worlds to conquer, when he had
subdued his ill-armed neighbors in a
little corner of the earth. Other worlds
lay all about, and he knew nothing of
their existence. The secrets of the
rocks he had never suspected. TTe had
no curiosity for the movements of the
stars. The mystery of Life—its end
less variety, its perennial unity—were
no more to him than to a jackal.
Steam, electricity, the growth of
trees, the marvel of human conscious
ness, all these had no existence to
Alexander the Great. The only con
quest he knew—that of men's bodies —
went but a little way. The great
world of men, even in his day, was be
yond his knowledge. The great ac
tual universe, the heavens that declare
the glory of God, lay about him in
majestic invisibility. His world was a
very small one, and he had done but a
very petty thing in a very little corner.
"The demand for more worlds to
conquer is not a sign of greatness. It
is the stamp of Ignorance. It is a
mark of provinciality. It indicates
that nothing worth while is yet ac
complished. There is always enough
that a man can do. 'There is always
room for the man of force, and he
makes room for many.' No Lincoln
ever sighed for more nations to save
and to unify; no Luther for more
churches to purify; no Darwin that,
nature had no more hidden secrets for
him to probe to their depths; no
Agassiz for a broader universe in
which to trace the thoughts of God.

"In test of these propositions on the
practical side, we may look over the
history of our own country in search
of the names of men whose total in
fluence has been a civilizing power,
whose lives have added to the only
permanent wealth of nations.' It is
not hard to find such names. Many of
them have been recorded in large let
ters on the pages of our history. Cities
have been named for these in public
life. Counties instate after state re
cord the names of Washington, Frank
lin, Adams, Jefferson, Hamilton, Han
cock, Jay, Monroe, Marshall, Carroll,
Clinton, Henry, Randolph, Madison
and the rest, down to Lincoln, wisest
of all, after whom the roll of the
counties is full. Each of these names
represents some addition, large or
small, to the development of demo
cracy, to the permanent wealth of
nations.
There is an ingenious and useful
book, called "Who's Who in America,"
which gives us each year the names
and a short history of some thousands
of men in the republic who have ac
quired temporary or permanent note
or notoriety, or who have added some
thing worth while to the permanent
wealth of nations. Some among these
have been merely caught in the flitting
lime light. Others have a single talent
of such a character as to have at
tracted their neighbor's attention. But
besides these thousands in "Who's
Who" we know that hundreds of thou
sands of others, equally worthy in the
aggregate, are going their way, un
heralded and unnoticed save to those
with whom they have close personal
relations. These men, who are not
"who" who fill no place in the bio
graphical dictionaries, who stir no
patriotic pride when their names are
called—they are the substance of our
nation, the units of which civilization
is built. And so long as these units
are sound, we need have no fear for
the future of the republic, built of such
materials. All of these are potential
heroes: any one of these may at some
time stand out from his fellows so as
to catch the world's eye. But whether
this shall happen or not, each man

whose lives have added to the only
permanent wealth of nations.' It is
not hard to find such names. Many of
them have been recorded in large let
ters on the pages of our history. Cities
have been named for these in public
life. Counties instate after state re
cord the names of Washington, Frank
lin, Adams, Jefferson, Hamilton, Han
cock, Jay, Monroe, Marshall, Carroll,
Clinton, Henry, Randolph, Madison
and the rest, down to Lincoln, wisest
of all, after whom the roll of the
counties is full. Each of these names
represents some addition, large or
small, to the development of demo
cracy, to the permanent wealth of
nations.
There is an ingenious and useful
book, called "Who's Who in America,"
which gives us each year the names
and a short history of some thousands
of men in the republic who have ac
quired temporary or permanent note
or notoriety, or who have added some
thing worth while to the permanent
wealth of nations. Some among these
have been merely caught in the flitting
lime light. Others have a single talent
of such a character as to have at
tracted their neighbor's attention. But
besides these thousands in "Who's
Who" we know that hundreds of thou
sands of others, equally worthy in the
aggregate, are going their way, un
heralded and unnoticed save to those
with whom they have close personal
relations. These men, who are not
"who" who fill no place in the bio
graphical dictionaries, who stir no
patriotic pride when their names are
called—they are the substance of our
nation, the units of which civilization
is built. And so long as these units
are sound, we need have no fear for
the future of the republic, built of such
materials. All of these are potential
heroes: any one of these may at some
time stand out from his fellows so as
to catch the world's eye. But whether
this shall happen or not, each man
who holds his place, who does his own
part without shirking, without over
reaching, has helped to clinch the
future of democracy, and in his degree
has added something to the permanent
wealth of nations. And of like sub
stance with these common men, are
those of larger grasp and keener in
telligence, who form the natural lead
ers, the scientific experts of enlight
ened democracy.
We of today are building on the
work of those who went before. We
enter into their labors and their pos
sibilities are our actualities. For the
men of the past century, there is i.o
"Who's Who" to point out whom we
should praise, admire or emulate. Just
now we are having a peculiar revival
of interest in their various careers and
in their many lines of work.
A gift has been made to the Univer
sity of the City of New York, of a hall
of fame, whereon each panel shall be
inscribed with the name of a great
American. These are chosen from
among those no longer living, by the
franchise of a hundred electors, still
living, each elector vouched for by the
editor of "Who's Who."
The Hall of Fame is described as a
"colonnade five hundred feet in length
looking towards the Palisades and the
Harlem River Valleys. The exclu
sive use of the Colonnade is to serve
as a hall of fame for great Americans.
One hundred and fifty panels will be
provided for inscriptions. Fifty of
these were to be inscribed in 1900,
provided fifty names shall be approved
by the two bodies of judges. At the
close of every five years thereafter,
five additional panels will be provided
so that the entire number may be com
pleted by A. D. 2000."
"A second general election to fill
the panels left unoccupied takes place
very soon. The field is an open pri
mary, in which the men and women
of the present urge the claims of men
and women of the past. Only a few
names, like those of Washington and
Lincoln, of Emerson and Lowell, of
Agassiz and Audubon, compel the vote
of every elector. For the rest, the
nominations interest us more than the
final election.
"Statesmen in abundance, from the
first to the last, we record, although in
all time and in all lands the existence
of statesmen has been obscured by the
swarm of politicians. They crowd
about the statesman like suckers about
a stalk of corn. The shoot that finally
reaches maturity, that is the real corn
stalk. The public man that lasts, he is
the statesman.
"Our soldiers have been not pro
fessional warriors, who have exalted
their terrible trade. They have been
men of ourselves, men of peace, for
the most part only too glad to escape
from the cruel necessities of fratrici
dal war. And among these north and
south, there are some on whose nobil
ity all electors must agree.
"The longest roll and the one most
typical of America is our list of great
inventors and engineers. The vast re
sources of a new country lead men to
consider how best to make these re-»
sources available. The sons of pio
neers inherit the power of making the
most of themselves and their sur
roundings.
"Take them the A's and B's as they
stand in alphabetical order—Adams,
four of them, the third the greatest,
Alexander, Asbury, Astor, Bache,
Baird, Bancroft, Beaumont, Beecher,
two besides a sister, Benton, Blaine,
Blair, Boone, Booth, Bowdich, Brain
ord, Brewster, Bushnell Bryant, Phil
lips Brooks, and John Brown. The
roll goes on and the history is un
finished, but in the hall of fame of the
past the "Who's Who" of today, and
best of all in the promise of the young
men and young women who are pres
sing on, we find the guarantee of the
strength of the republic, of its share
in the permanent wealth of nations.
"It is no part of my purpose this
morning to discuss the nature of
greatness, or to indicate those men in
any field to whom we should turn in
gratitude or in emulation. I have
wished only to sound a note of hope.
Now and ever, our country has had
her share of men whose lives have
intensified and clarified human know-
ledge, whose example has strength
ened human action. "The permanent
wealth of nations" is growing under
our hands, and it is for us as uni
versity men to do our part in its ex
tension.
"We stand at a turning point in our
political history. Factionalism and
sectionalism have been swallowed up
in the larger concerns of a larger na
tional life. The government by parties,
so long supposed to be a vital neces
sity in free government, is passing
away. In future we shall be governed
by the demands of the Nation. We are
interested not in party success, but in
the welfare of our people. The minor
questions of party advantage, of party
solidarity, of party domination, have
given way to the pressure of national
duties, of national accomplishment,
and the university men of our country
are taking the lead in this beneficent
change. When next they publish the
"Who's Who" in sound patriotism and
good citizenship, may the men of Stan
ford never be found wanting. The
chief needs of our nation today, inso
far as they are related to our govern
ment, may be summed up as these
four: Justice, sanitation, temperance,
peace."
With an appropirate program of
exercises, which included two force
ful speeches, the graduating members
of the Senior Class this morning re
ceived their various degrees. The or
chestra was present and contributed
numbers for the program.
President W. F. Slocum, of the
Colorado College, delivered the Com
mencement address, choosing for the
subject of his speech, "The Nation's
Guarantee of Personal Rights."
In discussing this topic, the speaker
dealt with this question in its broad
est light and showed wherein the re
lation between the nation and the in
dividual lay and also where the two
were affected by this relation.
In addressing the graduating class,
President Jordan spoke at length upon
the topic "The Wealth of Nations" in
which he said:
"Not long ago died, in Washington,
Simon Newcomb, astronomer and phil
osopher. It was said of him, 'He left
a record wholly blameless and wholly
salutary, whose work added to the per
manent wealth of nations.'
"At the same time died Edward H.
Harriman, promoter and financier,
likewise great, and likewise effective,
whose life and work added largely to
our nation's wealth.
"But the riches they produced were
not like in kind. The permanent
wealth of nations, like the Kingdom of
God, another name for the same thing,
is within ourselves. It is not meas
ured by outside accumulations.
"The activities of the scholar, the
clear-headed, broad-minded man of
science, have added to the permanent
achievement of the human race. Men
know and think more clearly, because
Simon Newcomb thought clearly. Men
act more wisely because • they think
more clearly; and all this because
Simon Newcomb was wise, courageous
and productive. We are all the better
off, more or less, for his life, and this
in proportion to the loftiness of our
own ideals, and the degree in whicn
our lives have come into contact with
his work.
"Harriman was a wise man too. He
saw ends from the beginning, and he
achieved the results he aimed for. He
had his reward. He made the de
spised Union Pacific and the abused
Southern Pacific a continuous and
valuable piece of property. He added
to his own wealth, to the wealth of
the railroad, to the wealth of various
associations, and incidentally to the
wealth or at least to the early develop
ment of a large part of the great west.
"In part, this would have come with
out him, in a sooner or later time. In
larger part, it is a matter of absolute
indifference to the human race wheth
er it ever came or not. In other words,
in those matters in which "the per
manent wealth of nations" is con
cerned, in the long future of mental
and spiritual development, the name of
Harriman finds no place. The name of
Newcomb in the same connection will

stand in large letters among those who
by life and influence have made this a
broader and a better world, or who
have helped ns to see better what a
broad and beautiful world this really
is. We may easily conceive that In the
next generation the name of Harriman
will be chiefly remembered, not for his
wealth nor his mastery of railroads,
but rather for the noble record left by
the scientific observers who took part
in the Harriman Expedition to Alaska.
In like fashion the time will come
when the name of Carnegie will not
be associated with steel and iron, and
even that of Rockefeller will not sug
gest Standard Oil or the Association
of Monopolies. The Carnegie Institu
tion and the Carnegie Foundation will
outlast these things, and the Rocke
feller Institute for Medical Research
represents one of the wisest and most
far- reaching uses to which any man's
money can ever be put.
"This discussion may serve as a
text for the thesis, that there are now,
and always have been, all over the
civilized world, men who add to the
permanent wealth of nations, their
intellectual and moral resources, and
the extension of sanity, of cleanliness
and of justice. It goes without saying
that the men who accomplish these
results do not work for money. They
do not work for self alone, nor for
immediate results. Their's is the far
future, the future which comes it may
be long after the workers are them
selves forgotten. In their work they
find their own reward. And a second
thesis is this, that men of this type,
now and ever, outweigh in influence
the other types of men. In the endless
struggle which humanity has had
against caste and privilege, against
plunder and injustice, the man who
works for the larger and wins always
the final success. It may not appear
so today nor tomorrow, nor at the end
of the century, nor at this or any other
stage of the game—but the game is not
yet finished.
"All the acquisitions of man. Emer
son tells us, "are the victories of the
good brain and the brave heart. The
world belongs to the energetic, be
longs to the wise. It is in vain to
make a paradise but for good men.'
"In God's world, those efforts only
last which meet with his august ap
proval. In other words, that which
endures is that which deserves to en
dure, because it helps In the conduct of
life. What man can accomplish must
be wrought on his fellowman. Only
man is plastic in man's hands. The
Universe is too big for us: the tough
old world has held its way for cen
turies of eons. We can neither make
it nor mar it. Wave and storm, sun
shine and song, tornado and torrent,
comet and earthquake, all these things
will take care of themselves. Life is
the only material our hands are strong
enough to hold. The only permanent
mark we can make is on the lives of
men. Whatever makes men better,
stronger, saner, more just, more gentle

and more happy, this is what counts, j
This is all that can add to "the per
manent wealth of nations."
"When they hung John Brown fifty ,
years ago, man blamed him for re
sisting the power of the law, throwing j
away his life and getting nothing for
it. He could not, as Thoreau said at
the time, 'get even a vote of thanks or
a pair of boots for doing this.' 'He
could not get four and sixpence a day
for being hung, take the year around.'
But John Brown was not looking for
a vote of thanks. It was not for four
and sixpence a day that he stood be
tween force and its helpless victims.
It was to illuminate the nature of
slavery. It was to help his fellow
citizens to read the story of their in
stitutions in the light of history. 'You
can get more,' Thoreau goes on to say, 1
'in your market (at Concord) for a;
quart of milk than you can jet for a
quart of blood, but yours is not the !
market heores carry their blood to.' ;
The great, the strong, the sane, the
pure, those who have ennobled our
race by being part of it, have not been
paid by the day or by the quart, not by
riches, nor fame nor, power, nor any
thing that man can give. The tragedy
of St. Helena lay not in the failure of
gigantic plans, the collapse of em
pire, but in the futility of the aim to
which effort was directed. The story
of Harper's Ferry, the body moulder
ing while the soul goes marching on,
is not recorded in history as tragedy.
"It is said that Alexander sighed for
more worlds to conquer, when he had
subdued his ill-armed neighbors in a
little corner of the earth. Other worlds
lay all about, and he knew nothing of
their existence. The secrets of the
rocks he had never suspected. TTe had
no curiosity for the movements of the
stars. The mystery of Life—its end
less variety, its perennial unity—were
no more to him than to a jackal.
Steam, electricity, the growth of
trees, the marvel of human conscious
ness, all these had no existence to
Alexander the Great. The only con
quest he knew—that of men's bodies —
went but a little way. The great
world of men, even in his day, was be
yond his knowledge. The great ac
tual universe, the heavens that declare
the glory of God, lay about him in
majestic invisibility. His world was a
very small one, and he had done but a
very petty thing in a very little corner.
"The demand for more worlds to
conquer is not a sign of greatness. It
is the stamp of Ignorance. It is a
mark of provinciality. It indicates
that nothing worth while is yet ac
complished. There is always enough
that a man can do. 'There is always
room for the man of force, and he
makes room for many.' No Lincoln
ever sighed for more nations to save
and to unify; no Luther for more
churches to purify; no Darwin that,
nature had no more hidden secrets for
him to probe to their depths; no
Agassiz for a broader universe in
which to trace the thoughts of God.

"In test of these propositions on the
practical side, we may look over the
history of our own country in search
of the names of men whose total in
fluence has been a civilizing power,
whose lives have added to the only
permanent wealth of nations.' It is
not hard to find such names. Many of
them have been recorded in large let
ters on the pages of our history. Cities
have been named for these in public
life. Counties instate after state re
cord the names of Washington, Frank
lin, Adams, Jefferson, Hamilton, Han
cock, Jay, Monroe, Marshall, Carroll,
