# MALONE'S WILL GOOD
## LAST TESTAMENT OF CLASS OF 1910 READ IN CHAPEL. Document Announces Disposal of Campus Effects of Graduates. Joshes Included. 
### 
We, the class of 1910, generally
recognized by the faculty as having
sound minds and memories and by the
Class of 1911 as having sound bodies,
having in contemplation the final de
parture from Stanford undergraduate
life, and acting without fear of, or
menace by, the Student Affairs Com
mittee, do declare this, our last will
and testament in manner following:
We direct that all our just debts and
the expenses of our last seremonies
be paid by the Business Office out of
our diploma fees.
As a suitable monument to the mem
ory of "Nineteen Ten" we leave for
exemplification the exploits and
achievements of our men in every field
of college life.
To the undergraduates of the Uni
versity we leave at once the duty and
privilege of making their life here a
living expression of Stanford Spirit
with the expectation that as Stanford
men they will not only cherish the
ideals, but live them. We further en
trust into their hands the observance
of all those customs and traditions
which are fast moulding at Stanford
an individual type of life.
The Football men we leave in trust
with "Ken" Dole, the bearer of a name,
which coupled with that of Stanford,
has never failed to speed victory.
To Sam Bellah, more particularly
described as the "Olympian athlete,"
we leave the glory of leading a team
whose well trained performances shall
chalk up one more exulting triumph
over our friends, the enemy.
And here we propose to all the
memory of Lee Scott, not only for his
star performances, but for his record
as a class athlete and a Stanford man
always.
The baseball team we place with
confidence in the custody of "Micky
Reed." His quiet and conscientious
zeal cannot fail to be an inspiration
to his men and the cornerstone of a
Successful season.
Upon the stong shoulders of Carl
Schaupp, we rest the responsibility,
the indomitable boating spirit, which,
though bereft of all financial aid and
devoid of the spectacular, still pulls
on to victory.
We specially desire here to be
queath to the Senior Class the most
bontiful crop of "Holdovers" in years,
with the hope that by injecting into
their midst some "Nineteen Ten" ma
terial there may be awakened in their
ranks some of that invincible spirit
which has always characterized the
collegiate existence of "Ten." Un
avoidable graduating influences, how
ever, prevent the bequest in this col
lection of "Jaspar" Holman. However,
all of "Jaspar's" right and interest in
the "Family Club" we take liberty to
bestow upon an eminently qualified
successor, "Norm" Day.
As a further legacy to the Class of
'Nineteen Eleven, we declare their right
to the heritage of our old "Soms," with
the suggestion that by "squaring"
same they may rest easier upon their
"blocks."
We have relinguished our corduroys
to the Juniors, provided always that
they deport themselves in a manner
befitting the duties and dignities of

I upperclassmen. To the same gentle
men is granted the privilege of wear
ing plugs upon the Quadrangle with
the remedy of self-help in the asser
tion of the right in case its exercise be
disputed by any class of men.
The right of 'Nineteen thirteen to
the succession of the red hat cannot
be denied. Let our stern warning be
that in living up to the reputation of
the same they always maintain the
calm poise and the sane judgment of
the customary Sophomore.
The Freshmen, soon to be with us,
are granted the "divers" well known
tubs of Encina Hall, with the right to
the full use and occupation thereof,
for the term of one year or until such
future time as the necessity for the
same may require.
We grant here, to the faculty all our
examination papers, together with
Tom Hine as a paper weight.
Jeff Morgan is left to the English
Club, with the sole power in that or
ganization to copyright and diffuse
his venerable collection of chessnuts
throughout the territories of Great
Britain, where they may be appre
ciated.
We accede to Loring Pickering, of
San Francisco, his right to continue
the full use and ownership of the
Quadrangle.
To "Henri" Cheda, we entrust the
duty of taking personal charge of
Phleger, of the Blue and Gold, that he
may keep him well ordered and harm
less.
Erie Leaf is conceded the right, ac
quired by adverse uses, to remain upon
the Stanford forum.
We here declare the right of the
Delta Gamma House to the full use
and control of "Pat" Tallant as watch
dog thereof, but with a tentative sug
gestion to muzzle the beast.
Upon the score books of the base
ball year we leave a record for emu
lation "Lex" Cochran's batting aver
age.
We grant to "Tom" Coleman and the
rest of the "Queeners" the continued
use of all those old shady nooks and
lanes better known by those gentle
men than described here.
"Eddie" Matthias is being left in
charge of "Chappie." We give to "Ed"
the liberty of buying a new handle for
the hammer.
Into the hands of Harold Ferguson
we place the editorial pen of the col
lege daily, confident in his powers,
already ably demonstrated, to wield
the same.
In the presidential chair of the Stu
dent Body we are leaving a man who
may be trusted to appreciate the re
sponsibilities, which the position im
poses. We expect him to lead a well
ordered and sympathetic Student
Body: one not torn and racked by in
ternal strife and dissension, but one
above such things; a student Body
with persona] selfishness buried, to
find strength in unity.
With the foregoing bequests, 'Nine
teen Ten relinquishes all control and
interests in undergraduate affairs
Her life in the University has been a
full one. There have been times dur
ing her four years of possession of the
duties and privileges of the under
graduate that the way of duty and
right seemed not clear, when passion
may have clouded our judgment and
even might ruled right, but through it
all duty has been followed as it was
divined and our privileges unabused.
As the last act of our testamentory
disposition we leave forever with our
Alma Mater, the assurance of the un
dying loyalty and affection of the
members of " 'Nineteen Ten."
Our Will is Done.

Alma Mater, the assurance of the un
dying loyalty and affection of the
members of " 'Nineteen Ten."
Our Will is Done.
We, the class of 1910, generally
recognized by the faculty as having
sound minds and memories and by the
Class of 1911 as having sound bodies,
having in contemplation the final de
parture from Stanford undergraduate
life, and acting without fear of, or
menace by, the Student Affairs Com
mittee, do declare this, our last will
and testament in manner following:
We direct that all our just debts and
the expenses of our last seremonies
be paid by the Business Office out of
our diploma fees.
As a suitable monument to the mem
ory of "Nineteen Ten" we leave for
exemplification the exploits and
achievements of our men in every field
of college life.
To the undergraduates of the Uni
versity we leave at once the duty and
privilege of making their life here a
living expression of Stanford Spirit
with the expectation that as Stanford
men they will not only cherish the
ideals, but live them. We further en
trust into their hands the observance
of all those customs and traditions
which are fast moulding at Stanford
an individual type of life.
The Football men we leave in trust
with "Ken" Dole, the bearer of a name,
which coupled with that of Stanford,
has never failed to speed victory.
To Sam Bellah, more particularly
described as the "Olympian athlete,"
we leave the glory of leading a team
whose well trained performances shall
chalk up one more exulting triumph
over our friends, the enemy.
And here we propose to all the
memory of Lee Scott, not only for his
star performances, but for his record
as a class athlete and a Stanford man
always.
The baseball team we place with
confidence in the custody of "Micky
Reed." His quiet and conscientious
zeal cannot fail to be an inspiration
to his men and the cornerstone of a
Successful season.
Upon the stong shoulders of Carl
Schaupp, we rest the responsibility,
the indomitable boating spirit, which,
though bereft of all financial aid and
devoid of the spectacular, still pulls
on to victory.
We specially desire here to be
queath to the Senior Class the most
bontiful crop of "Holdovers" in years,
with the hope that by injecting into
their midst some "Nineteen Ten" ma
terial there may be awakened in their
ranks some of that invincible spirit
which has always characterized the
collegiate existence of "Ten." Un
avoidable graduating influences, how
ever, prevent the bequest in this col
lection of "Jaspar" Holman. However,
all of "Jaspar's" right and interest in
the "Family Club" we take liberty to
bestow upon an eminently qualified
successor, "Norm" Day.
As a further legacy to the Class of
'Nineteen Eleven, we declare their right
to the heritage of our old "Soms," with
the suggestion that by "squaring"
same they may rest easier upon their
"blocks."
We have relinguished our corduroys
to the Juniors, provided always that
they deport themselves in a manner
befitting the duties and dignities of

I upperclassmen. To the same gentle
men is granted the privilege of wear
ing plugs upon the Quadrangle with
the remedy of self-help in the asser
tion of the right in case its exercise be
disputed by any class of men.
The right of 'Nineteen thirteen to
the succession of the red hat cannot
be denied. Let our stern warning be
that in living up to the reputation of
the same they always maintain the
calm poise and the sane judgment of
the customary Sophomore.
The Freshmen, soon to be with us,
are granted the "divers" well known
tubs of Encina Hall, with the right to
the full use and occupation thereof,
for the term of one year or until such
future time as the necessity for the
same may require.
We grant here, to the faculty all our
examination papers, together with
Tom Hine as a paper weight.
Jeff Morgan is left to the English
Club, with the sole power in that or
ganization to copyright and diffuse
his venerable collection of chessnuts
throughout the territories of Great
Britain, where they may be appre
ciated.
We accede to Loring Pickering, of
San Francisco, his right to continue
the full use and ownership of the
Quadrangle.
To "Henri" Cheda, we entrust the
duty of taking personal charge of
Phleger, of the Blue and Gold, that he
may keep him well ordered and harm
less.
Erie Leaf is conceded the right, ac
quired by adverse uses, to remain upon
the Stanford forum.
We here declare the right of the
Delta Gamma House to the full use
and control of "Pat" Tallant as watch
dog thereof, but with a tentative sug
gestion to muzzle the beast.
Upon the score books of the base
ball year we leave a record for emu
lation "Lex" Cochran's batting aver
age.
We grant to "Tom" Coleman and the
rest of the "Queeners" the continued
use of all those old shady nooks and
lanes better known by those gentle
men than described here.
"Eddie" Matthias is being left in
charge of "Chappie." We give to "Ed"
the liberty of buying a new handle for
the hammer.
Into the hands of Harold Ferguson
we place the editorial pen of the col
lege daily, confident in his powers,
already ably demonstrated, to wield
the same.
In the presidential chair of the Stu
dent Body we are leaving a man who
may be trusted to appreciate the re
sponsibilities, which the position im
poses. We expect him to lead a well
ordered and sympathetic Student
Body: one not torn and racked by in
ternal strife and dissension, but one
above such things; a student Body
with persona] selfishness buried, to
find strength in unity.
With the foregoing bequests, 'Nine
teen Ten relinquishes all control and
interests in undergraduate affairs
Her life in the University has been a
full one. There have been times dur
ing her four years of possession of the
duties and privileges of the under
graduate that the way of duty and
right seemed not clear, when passion
may have clouded our judgment and
even might ruled right, but through it
all duty has been followed as it was
divined and our privileges unabused.

Alma Mater, the assurance of the un
dying loyalty and affection of the
members of " 'Nineteen Ten."
Our Will is Done.
We, the class of 1910, generally
recognized by the faculty as having
sound minds and memories and by the
Class of 1911 as having sound bodies,
having in contemplation the final de
parture from Stanford undergraduate
life, and acting without fear of, or
menace by, the Student Affairs Com
mittee, do declare this, our last will
and testament in manner following:
We direct that all our just debts and
the expenses of our last seremonies
be paid by the Business Office out of
our diploma fees.
As a suitable monument to the mem
ory of "Nineteen Ten" we leave for
exemplification the exploits and
achievements of our men in every field
of college life.
To the undergraduates of the Uni
versity we leave at once the duty and
privilege of making their life here a
living expression of Stanford Spirit
with the expectation that as Stanford
men they will not only cherish the
ideals, but live them. We further en
trust into their hands the observance
of all those customs and traditions
which are fast moulding at Stanford
an individual type of life.
The Football men we leave in trust
with "Ken" Dole, the bearer of a name,
which coupled with that of Stanford,
has never failed to speed victory.
To Sam Bellah, more particularly
described as the "Olympian athlete,"
we leave the glory of leading a team
whose well trained performances shall
chalk up one more exulting triumph
over our friends, the enemy.
And here we propose to all the
memory of Lee Scott, not only for his
star performances, but for his record
as a class athlete and a Stanford man
always.
The baseball team we place with
confidence in the custody of "Micky
Reed." His quiet and conscientious
zeal cannot fail to be an inspiration
to his men and the cornerstone of a
Successful season.
Upon the stong shoulders of Carl
Schaupp, we rest the responsibility,
the indomitable boating spirit, which,
though bereft of all financial aid and
devoid of the spectacular, still pulls
on to victory.
We specially desire here to be
queath to the Senior Class the most
bontiful crop of "Holdovers" in years,
with the hope that by injecting into
their midst some "Nineteen Ten" ma
terial there may be awakened in their
ranks some of that invincible spirit
which has always characterized the
collegiate existence of "Ten." Un
avoidable graduating influences, how
ever, prevent the bequest in this col
lection of "Jaspar" Holman. However,
all of "Jaspar's" right and interest in
the "Family Club" we take liberty to
bestow upon an eminently qualified
successor, "Norm" Day.
As a further legacy to the Class of
'Nineteen Eleven, we declare their right
to the heritage of our old "Soms," with
the suggestion that by "squaring"
same they may rest easier upon their
"blocks."
We have relinguished our corduroys
to the Juniors, provided always that
they deport themselves in a manner
befitting the duties and dignities of

I upperclassmen. To the same gentle
men is granted the privilege of wear
ing plugs upon the Quadrangle with
the remedy of self-help in the asser
tion of the right in case its exercise be
disputed by any class of men.
The right of 'Nineteen thirteen to
the succession of the red hat cannot
be denied. Let our stern warning be
that in living up to the reputation of
the same they always maintain the
calm poise and the sane judgment of
the customary Sophomore.
The Freshmen, soon to be with us,
are granted the "divers" well known
tubs of Encina Hall, with the right to
the full use and occupation thereof,
for the term of one year or until such
future time as the necessity for the
same may require.
We grant here, to the faculty all our
examination papers, together with
Tom Hine as a paper weight.
Jeff Morgan is left to the English
Club, with the sole power in that or
ganization to copyright and diffuse
his venerable collection of chessnuts
throughout the territories of Great
Britain, where they may be appre
ciated.
We accede to Loring Pickering, of
San Francisco, his right to continue
the full use and ownership of the
Quadrangle.
To "Henri" Cheda, we entrust the
duty of taking personal charge of
Phleger, of the Blue and Gold, that he
may keep him well ordered and harm
less.
Erie Leaf is conceded the right, ac
quired by adverse uses, to remain upon
the Stanford forum.
We here declare the right of the
Delta Gamma House to the full use
and control of "Pat" Tallant as watch
dog thereof, but with a tentative sug
gestion to muzzle the beast.
Upon the score books of the base
ball year we leave a record for emu
lation "Lex" Cochran's batting aver
age.
We grant to "Tom" Coleman and the
rest of the "Queeners" the continued
use of all those old shady nooks and
lanes better known by those gentle
men than described here.
"Eddie" Matthias is being left in
charge of "Chappie." We give to "Ed"
the liberty of buying a new handle for
the hammer.
Into the hands of Harold Ferguson
we place the editorial pen of the col
lege daily, confident in his powers,
already ably demonstrated, to wield
the same.
In the presidential chair of the Stu
dent Body we are leaving a man who
may be trusted to appreciate the re
sponsibilities, which the position im
poses. We expect him to lead a well
ordered and sympathetic Student
Body: one not torn and racked by in
ternal strife and dissension, but one
above such things; a student Body
with persona] selfishness buried, to
find strength in unity.
With the foregoing bequests, 'Nine
teen Ten relinquishes all control and
interests in undergraduate affairs
Her life in the University has been a
full one. There have been times dur
ing her four years of possession of the
duties and privileges of the under
graduate that the way of duty and
right seemed not clear, when passion
may have clouded our judgment and
even might ruled right, but through it
all duty has been followed as it was
divined and our privileges unabused.
As the last act of our testamentory
disposition we leave forever with our
Alma Mater, the assurance of the un
dying loyalty and affection of the
members of " 'Nineteen Ten."
Our Will is Done.
