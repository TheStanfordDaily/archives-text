Today marks the passing of the
Class of 1910 into the more or less un
certain future life under the tutelage
of the outside world. We wish them
the same degree of success that they
have succeeded in attaining here at
Stanford and we hope that they will
make individually the same distinc
tive mark that the class has set for it
self in the history of the University. If
this feat is accomplished, not only
Stanford, but the world will hear from
them, while the University will be
proud to recognize them as a part of
the growing number of men and wom
en who now claim her as their Alma
Mater.
The Class of 1910 has proved
its aggressiveness and capabilities
throughout their career of four years,
and we wish at this time to express
the credit that is due them for the
many ways in which they have as
sisted in placing the name of Stanford
above the average scale and in keeping
sacred the traditions of the institution.
Every branch of college activities has
received its share of men and women
from 1910 and in the majority of cases,
they were among the best. The record
of the class has been remarkable and
it now remains to be seen whether this
same standard is maintained in that
life which is now being entered upon
by so many from this organization.
We wish them every success and we
hope that their interest in and their
loyalty to the Cardinal will cause them
once more to turn our way and share
again some of the benefits and priv
ileges that. Stanford can give to those
who have and do now support the
Cardinal.
