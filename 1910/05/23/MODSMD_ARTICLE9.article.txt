# REV. CLAMPETT TALKS
## BACCALAUREATE SERMON BY SAN FRANCISCAN. Forceful Address Given by Speaker Yesterday Morning in Assembly Hall. 
### 
Rev. F. W. Clampett, of San Fran
cisco, delivered a forceful sermon to
the Seniors yesterday. The speaker
chose for his text the quotation from
the Book of St. John, "We must work
the works of him that sent us, while it
is day; the night coineth when no man
can work," and in part spoke upon
this verse as follows;
"To you, who are about to go forth
from these walls to take your place in
the battle of life, I give my best wishes
and heartiest congratulations. I con
gratulate you, not because you have
finished your education, but rather, be
cause in a true sense, you are about
to begin it. Within this great institu
tion, doubtless, you have passed
through a process of education, and
one of the most vital character. Later
on, each and every one of you will
appreciate that, in many ways, it was
the most vital of your whole life. You
are now about to pass from the period
of acquisition to the period of appli
cation, and the latter will demand
every energy of your soul.
"As I look back, one quarter of a
century, to my old Alma Mater —the
historic University of Dublin, whose
sons are scattered all over the world,
there is retained, strong as ever, the
twofold impression then sealed into
my very being. Fundamentally, it was
the spirit of deep and sincere rever
ence. Deep down in our hearts, was
reverence for that university and for
every stone in that great pile; rever
ence for the traditions enshrined in
the memory of her sons; reverence for
the Faculty, the influence of whose
personality remains when the know
ledge then imparted hath, for the
most part, passed away. As I look
back upon those days, I can recall
how that the spirit of reverence was
reciprocated by a spirit of affection
on the part of the whole teaching staff.
"I am giving special emphasis lo
this quality for the reason that there
seems to be a universal admission
that the age in which we live is chiefly
characterized by a spirit of irrever
ence. The child presumes upon a
kind of wisdom, deemed by the pos
sessor superior to that of the parent;
it is transferred by natural sequence
to the school where the pupil does not
conceal a sense of superiority to the
teacher; it passes into the University
where it is evidenced in spasms of
hostility to the faculty, and from the
seat of learning, it passes into the
outer world, and asserts itself against
the State.
"A man of national reputation, Ex
governor Charles E. Hughes, who has
lately been elevated to the Supreme
bench of the United States, recently
said: 'As students come down to New
York city the questions which we
place before them are not simply, what
is your college, or, what is your
nationality?, or, to what church do
you belong? The questions today of
greater moment are, will you lie?
Will you steal? Can we trust .you
utterly?
"The more I see of men and things,
the more am I convinced that the de
mand of the age is for wholesome,
pure-hearted, clear-headed men. It is
not for brilliant men. The State needs
citizens of uprightness—men and wo
men of moral Integrity; reliable;
steady; brave; resolute; ever ready to

sacrifice personal interest for the good
of their fellows. This quality of cit
izenship is steadily increasing. In
deed, the thoughtful leaders, of na
tional reputation are all, without ex
ception, optimists of the first magni
tude, and the reason thereof will be
found in the awakening of the con
science of the individual, the commun
ity, and the nation. Perhaps no man
of the past two centuries mingled
more with men of great affairs,
throughout a long life, than did the
poet of the 'In Memoriam.' Yet he
uttered the brightest words of hope
that have sounded, in all those years.
"Now, on the threshold of your
graduation, you are called upon to
bring your life into touch with the
great moral issues which will face
you, as you take your place in the
varied spheres of action. The prob
lems, which will thus confront you in
the exercise of your citizenship, are
the natural evolution of a compara
tively new country. And yet, there is
not a single problem to be solved, not
a condition to be improved, that is
not a radical part of the problems nf
our national life. The peculiar and
unfortunate elements in the recent
history of our fair San Francisco
brought into unenviable notoriety tbe
crime, known by the name of graft.
The disclosures were of a shocking
character, and demonstrated the need
of a commercialism based upon the
foundation of righteousness. But,
while every honest citizen is called
upon to denounce that crime and de
mand justice, we must not lose sight
of the fact that it is but a part, and
that a very small part, of the tre
mendous reforms which the present
conditions demand.
"The sin of impurity, in every form,
is sapping the strength of the nation,
and the temptations placed in the path
of our young men are blatently and
impudently forced upon them; the
traffic in white slavery points to one
of the most loathsome conspiracies of
the age; the integrity of the home, as
the unit of the nation, is threatened
by the terrible evil of the divorce sys
tem, with a record in the city of San
Francisco of one divorce for every
six marriages. The survey thus
briefly pointed out, discloses the need
for a positive moral stand."

not a single problem to be solved, not
a condition to be improved, that is
not a radical part of the problems nf
our national life. The peculiar and
unfortunate elements in the recent
history of our fair San Francisco
brought into unenviable notoriety tbe
crime, known by the name of graft.
The disclosures were of a shocking
character, and demonstrated the need
of a commercialism based upon the
foundation of righteousness. But,
while every honest citizen is called
upon to denounce that crime and de

of the fact that it is but a part, and
that a very small part, of the tre
mendous reforms which the present
conditions demand.
"The sin of impurity, in every form,
is sapping the strength of the nation,
and the temptations placed in the path
of our young men are blatently and
impudently forced upon them; the
traffic in white slavery points to one
of the most loathsome conspiracies of
the age; the integrity of the home, as
the unit of the nation, is threatened
by the terrible evil of the divorce sys
tem, with a record in the city of San
Francisco of one divorce for every
six marriages. The survey thus
briefly pointed out, discloses the need
for a positive moral stand."
Rev. F. W. Clampett, of San Fran
cisco, delivered a forceful sermon to
the Seniors yesterday. The speaker
chose for his text the quotation from
the Book of St. John, "We must work
the works of him that sent us, while it
is day; the night coineth when no man
can work," and in part spoke upon
this verse as follows;
"To you, who are about to go forth
from these walls to take your place in
the battle of life, I give my best wishes
and heartiest congratulations. I con
gratulate you, not because you have
finished your education, but rather, be
cause in a true sense, you are about
to begin it. Within this great institu
tion, doubtless, you have passed
through a process of education, and
one of the most vital character. Later
on, each and every one of you will
appreciate that, in many ways, it was
the most vital of your whole life. You
are now about to pass from the period
of acquisition to the period of appli
cation, and the latter will demand
every energy of your soul.
"As I look back, one quarter of a
century, to my old Alma Mater —the
historic University of Dublin, whose
sons are scattered all over the world,
there is retained, strong as ever, the
twofold impression then sealed into
my very being. Fundamentally, it was
the spirit of deep and sincere rever
ence. Deep down in our hearts, was
reverence for that university and for
every stone in that great pile; rever
ence for the traditions enshrined in
the memory of her sons; reverence for
the Faculty, the influence of whose
personality remains when the know
ledge then imparted hath, for the
most part, passed away. As I look
back upon those days, I can recall
how that the spirit of reverence was
reciprocated by a spirit of affection
on the part of the whole teaching staff.
"I am giving special emphasis lo
this quality for the reason that there
seems to be a universal admission
that the age in which we live is chiefly
characterized by a spirit of irrever
ence. The child presumes upon a
kind of wisdom, deemed by the pos
sessor superior to that of the parent;
it is transferred by natural sequence
to the school where the pupil does not
conceal a sense of superiority to the
teacher; it passes into the University
where it is evidenced in spasms of
hostility to the faculty, and from the
seat of learning, it passes into the
outer world, and asserts itself against
the State.
"A man of national reputation, Ex
governor Charles E. Hughes, who has
lately been elevated to the Supreme
bench of the United States, recently
said: 'As students come down to New

place before them are not simply, what
is your college, or, what is your
nationality?, or, to what church do
you belong? The questions today of
greater moment are, will you lie?
Will you steal? Can we trust .you
utterly?
"The more I see of men and things,
the more am I convinced that the de
mand of the age is for wholesome,
pure-hearted, clear-headed men. It is
not for brilliant men. The State needs
citizens of uprightness—men and wo
men of moral Integrity; reliable;
steady; brave; resolute; ever ready to

sacrifice personal interest for the good
of their fellows. This quality of cit
izenship is steadily increasing. In
deed, the thoughtful leaders, of na
tional reputation are all, without ex
ception, optimists of the first magni
tude, and the reason thereof will be
found in the awakening of the con
science of the individual, the commun
ity, and the nation. Perhaps no man
of the past two centuries mingled
more with men of great affairs,
throughout a long life, than did the
poet of the 'In Memoriam.' Yet he
uttered the brightest words of hope
that have sounded, in all those years.
"Now, on the threshold of your
graduation, you are called upon to
