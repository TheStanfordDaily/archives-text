# COLLEGE RUGBY SQUAD MAKES REMARKABLE RECORD ON TRIP
## 
### 
The American Rugby Varsity men
returned to their home land from Aus
tralia last Monday, reaching this part
of the Coast from Vancouver a few
days later. They bear the scars and
wounds of nine defeats and the tro
phies of only three victories, with two
drawn games. Yet they won in Austra
lia and New Zealand a thing that is
far greater than any record of contests.
They conquered the two islands from
shore to shore and every sportsman in
them by their clean cut behavior, their
loyalty to one another anil their de
sire to keep as far as possible from
objectionable tactics. The Sydney
Referee, a great Rugby paper in the
principal city of Australia says of
them, that"the Americans are thorough
sportsmen. They have played the
game strenuously and with scrupulous
fairness. There has never been a more
loyal set of men on tour, never si team
1 liiil had a higher conception of what
was necessary to their physical wel
fare.'' A similar estimation of the
American college players, Stanford,
California and Nevada Varsity men,
was voiced all over the two islands,
and "Young America," as the Sydney
Star called them, captured 'lie hearts
of all by their conduct, while they ex
cited the greatest admiration for their
playing in a land where Rugby is al
most one of the seven wonders of the
world.
The men in the All-America team
were: Brown, Cheda, Dole, Erb, Fitt
ing, Horton, Kern, Mint urn, Roth and
1 anborn of Stanford; Allen, Bennett,
Cerf, Dwiggins, Elliott, Hardy, Harris,
Morris, Northcroft, Pauley, Phleger,
Schwartz, and Watts of California;
with D. \V. Burbank, '09, as Manager
and J. C. Schaeffer, U. C. '09, as Coach.
C. Thorpe, '09, joined the team for
three games during the stay. The bat
tles that these men fought with de
feats or victories is told in the short
summary at the top of the column.
They did their best in training and in
playing and are given full credit for
all they accomplished by the southern
island papers. In definite criticism the
experts of the Antipodes say that for
dribbling the American forwards were
unsurpassed, that in kicking for
touch the brilliant full-back Brown
was superior even to their battle
proven heroes. Passing, however, they
say has not yet become second nature
to the Pacific Coast players, but that it
will come to them as a knack is the
prophecy of all the best judges and
most important newspapers in the far
away country. All these critics join
also in affirming that the American
college men only lack the polished
ease of the game to make them great,—
that in critical moments they have to
stop and think, if even for a fraction of
a second, and this lose 3 the advantage
they have gained. When each move in
their play is carried out with instan
taneous reasoning, then the Yankees
will be unconquerable. As the Sydney
Star says in regard to this, that "a
Eeaeon or two more of the training
which the Americans seem to have had
should make them among the best, if
not the best, exponents of the Rugby
Union game in the world. The marvel
of it is that players who are barely
out of their years of youth should in

four years see the game for the first
time, learn the rules, master the play
and come within an ace of being the
superiors of world renowned teanis„

enough to be their fathers, and who
have perfected their knowledge of their
favorite game by tens upons tens of
years of the hardest study. And the
men who made this reputation were in
some degree only a hit-or-miss choice.
Some of their team mates left behind
were their equals, and, with another
consolidation of Stanford and Califor
nia could very nearly form a second
All-America team as strong as the
first. How many of the best stars in
the fifteens of the two universities
were not able to take the summer trip
and were left behind!
A great many games were played
equal to the big varsity match here,
and all in the short playing period of
six weeks. The Antipodean papers
mention this, saying that it was "too
much for the Americans to play four
hard games in ten days. The game
upon whose outcome rested no slight
amount of honor and made their nerves
quiver most was the great first battle
with the Maoris, a native fifteen, a
struggle watched by over 40,000 per
sons. This was lost by a close score,
11-14. The contest of which they feel
most proud to tell, where they did their
best, was their final one of the sched
lile, in New Zealand. A tie-score was
the best that the pick of New Zealand's
athletes could get out of the Americans
in that game, the result being a 13-13
score.
Players who made records on the
tour were, first of all, P. C. Brown, '11,
for his touch kicking, and wonderful
defense work; Kern for his marvelous
scoring ability and long-winded runs,
Watts, Allen and Dwiggins for similar
aptness at scoring. Cheda, though
small in size, stood out head and
shoulders above the forwards by his
remarkable playing.
The American college men them
selves say that they learned from their
trip nothing new in the important de
partments of the Rugby game—that
their coaching here was equal to the
work of the Australians. The only
point that came home to them with
great force was the absolute necessity
of holding their positions in the line
under all circumstances, this rule ap
plying most, of course, to the back
field. The backs must be in their
places ready to receive the ball, at all
times, and must watch their opponents
for the slightest opportunity of getting
an unguarded hole through the oppos
ing line. This was impressed on their
memories time and again by the Aus
tralians, who went through the un
guarded American positions in con
tests repeatedly.
Everyone of the twenty-five men who
made the round trip of the Pacific,
never tire of telling of their entertain
ment there. The sportsmen of the
southern islands set a record in hos
pitality hard to surpass. Should they
send a picked team to this coast, as
seems likely in 1911, America will
have to out do all records in entertain
ing them. At one great public recep
tion in the Sydney Town Hall five
thousand Australians cheered a wel
come to the Americans last June.
D. W. Burbank, '09, as manager, cre
ated a reputation in handling the trip
that brought compliments from scores
of newspapers in the southern islands,
as well as the loyal support from his
own fellow travelers. J. C. Schaeffer,
U. C. '09, made a strong impression
as coach.

mention this, saying that it was "too
much for the Americans to play four
hard games in ten days. The game
upon whose outcome rested no slight
amount of honor and made their nerves
quiver most was the great first battle
with the Maoris, a native fifteen, a
struggle watched by over 40,000 per
sons. This was lost by a close score,
11-14. The contest of which they feel
most proud to tell, where they did their
best, was their final one of the sched
lile, in New Zealand. A tie-score was
the best that the pick of New Zealand's
athletes could get out of the Americans
in that game, the result being a 13-13
score.
Players who made records on the
tour were, first of all, P. C. Brown, '11,
for his touch kicking, and wonderful
defense work; Kern for his marvelous
scoring ability and long-winded runs,
Watts, Allen and Dwiggins for similar
aptness at scoring. Cheda, though
small in size, stood out head and
shoulders above the forwards by his
remarkable playing.
The American college men them
selves say that they learned from their
trip nothing new in the important de
partments of the Rugby game—that
their coaching here was equal to the
work of the Australians. The only
point that came home to them with
great force was the absolute necessity
of holding their positions in the line
under all circumstances, this rule ap
plying most, of course, to the back
field. The backs must be in their
places ready to receive the ball, at all
times, and must watch their opponents
for the slightest opportunity of getting
an unguarded hole through the oppos
ing line. This was impressed on their
memories time and again by the Aus
tralians, who went through the un
guarded American positions in con
tests repeatedly.
Everyone of the twenty-five men who
made the round trip of the Pacific,
never tire of telling of their entertain
ment there. The sportsmen of the
southern islands set a record in hos
pitality hard to surpass. Should they
send a picked team to this coast, as
seems likely in 1911, America will
have to out do all records in entertain
ing them. At one great public recep
tion in the Sydney Town Hall five
thousand Australians cheered a wel
come to the Americans last June.
D. W. Burbank, '09, as manager, cre
ated a reputation in handling the trip
that brought compliments from scores
of newspapers in the southern islands,
as well as the loyal support from his
own fellow travelers. J. C. Schaeffer,
U. C. '09, made a strong impression
as coach.
The American Rugby Varsity men
returned to their home land from Aus
tralia last Monday, reaching this part
of the Coast from Vancouver a few
days later. They bear the scars and
wounds of nine defeats and the tro
phies of only three victories, with two
drawn games. Yet they won in Austra
lia and New Zealand a thing that is
far greater than any record of contests.
They conquered the two islands from
shore to shore and every sportsman in
them by their clean cut behavior, their
loyalty to one another anil their de
sire to keep as far as possible from
objectionable tactics. The Sydney
Referee, a great Rugby paper in the
principal city of Australia says of
them, that"the Americans are thorough
sportsmen. They have played the
game strenuously and with scrupulous
fairness. There has never been a more
loyal set of men on tour, never si team
1 liiil had a higher conception of what
was necessary to their physical wel
fare.'' A similar estimation of the
American college players, Stanford,
California and Nevada Varsity men,
was voiced all over the two islands,
and "Young America," as the Sydney
Star called them, captured 'lie hearts
of all by their conduct, while they ex
cited the greatest admiration for their
playing in a land where Rugby is al
most one of the seven wonders of the
world.
The men in the All-America team
were: Brown, Cheda, Dole, Erb, Fitt
ing, Horton, Kern, Mint urn, Roth and
1 anborn of Stanford; Allen, Bennett,
Cerf, Dwiggins, Elliott, Hardy, Harris,
Morris, Northcroft, Pauley, Phleger,
Schwartz, and Watts of California;
with D. \V. Burbank, '09, as Manager
and J. C. Schaeffer, U. C. '09, as Coach.
C. Thorpe, '09, joined the team for
three games during the stay. The bat
tles that these men fought with de
feats or victories is told in the short
summary at the top of the column.
They did their best in training and in
playing and are given full credit for
all they accomplished by the southern
island papers. In definite criticism the
experts of the Antipodes say that for
dribbling the American forwards were
unsurpassed, that in kicking for
touch the brilliant full-back Brown
was superior even to their battle
proven heroes. Passing, however, they
say has not yet become second nature
to the Pacific Coast players, but that it
will come to them as a knack is the
prophecy of all the best judges and
most important newspapers in the far
away country. All these critics join
also in affirming that the American
college men only lack the polished
ease of the game to make them great,—
that in critical moments they have to
stop and think, if even for a fraction of
a second, and this lose 3 the advantage
they have gained. When each move in
their play is carried out with instan
taneous reasoning, then the Yankees
will be unconquerable. As the Sydney
Star says in regard to this, that "a
Eeaeon or two more of the training
which the Americans seem to have had
should make them among the best, if
not the best, exponents of the Rugby
Union game in the world. The marvel
of it is that players who are barely
out of their years of youth should in

C. Thorpe, '09, joined the team for

tles that these men fought with de
feats or victories is told in the short
summary at the top of the column.
They did their best in training and in
playing and are given full credit for
all they accomplished by the southern
island papers. In definite criticism the
experts of the Antipodes say that for
dribbling the American forwards were
unsurpassed, that in kicking for
touch the brilliant full-back Brown
was superior even to their battle
proven heroes. Passing, however, they
say has not yet become second nature
to the Pacific Coast players, but that it
will come to them as a knack is the
prophecy of all the best judges and
most important newspapers in the far
away country. All these critics join
also in affirming that the American
college men only lack the polished
ease of the game to make them great,—
that in critical moments they have to
stop and think, if even for a fraction of
a second, and this lose 3 the advantage
they have gained. When each move in
their play is carried out with instan
taneous reasoning, then the Yankees
will be unconquerable. As the Sydney
Star says in regard to this, that "a
Eeaeon or two more of the training
which the Americans seem to have had
should make them among the best, if
not the best, exponents of the Rugby
Union game in the world. The marvel
of it is that players who are barely
out of their years of youth should in

four years see the game for the first
time, learn the rules, master the play
and come within an ace of being the
superiors of world renowned teanis„

enough to be their fathers, and who
have perfected their knowledge of their
favorite game by tens upons tens of
years of the hardest study. And the
men who made this reputation were in
some degree only a hit-or-miss choice.
Some of their team mates left behind
were their equals, and, with another
consolidation of Stanford and Califor
nia could very nearly form a second
All-America team as strong as the
first. How many of the best stars in
the fifteens of the two universities
were not able to take the summer trip
and were left behind!
A great many games were played
equal to the big varsity match here,
and all in the short playing period of
six weeks. The Antipodean papers
mention this, saying that it was "too
much for the Americans to play four
hard games in ten days. The game
upon whose outcome rested no slight
amount of honor and made their nerves
quiver most was the great first battle
with the Maoris, a native fifteen, a
struggle watched by over 40,000 per
sons. This was lost by a close score,
11-14. The contest of which they feel
most proud to tell, where they did their
best, was their final one of the sched
lile, in New Zealand. A tie-score was
the best that the pick of New Zealand's
athletes could get out of the Americans
in that game, the result being a 13-13
score.
Players who made records on the
tour were, first of all, P. C. Brown, '11,
for his touch kicking, and wonderful
defense work; Kern for his marvelous
scoring ability and long-winded runs,
Watts, Allen and Dwiggins for similar
aptness at scoring. Cheda, though
small in size, stood out head and
shoulders above the forwards by his
remarkable playing.
The American college men them
selves say that they learned from their
trip nothing new in the important de
partments of the Rugby game—that
their coaching here was equal to the
work of the Australians. The only
point that came home to them with
great force was the absolute necessity
of holding their positions in the line
under all circumstances, this rule ap
plying most, of course, to the back
field. The backs must be in their
places ready to receive the ball, at all
times, and must watch their opponents
for the slightest opportunity of getting
an unguarded hole through the oppos
ing line. This was impressed on their
memories time and again by the Aus
tralians, who went through the un
guarded American positions in con
tests repeatedly.
Everyone of the twenty-five men who
made the round trip of the Pacific,
never tire of telling of their entertain
ment there. The sportsmen of the
southern islands set a record in hos
pitality hard to surpass. Should they
send a picked team to this coast, as
seems likely in 1911, America will
have to out do all records in entertain
ing them. At one great public recep
tion in the Sydney Town Hall five
thousand Australians cheered a wel
come to the Americans last June.
D. W. Burbank, '09, as manager, cre
ated a reputation in handling the trip
that brought compliments from scores
of newspapers in the southern islands,
as well as the loyal support from his
own fellow travelers. J. C. Schaeffer,
U. C. '09, made a strong impression
as coach.
The American Rugby Varsity men
returned to their home land from Aus
tralia last Monday, reaching this part
of the Coast from Vancouver a few
days later. They bear the scars and
wounds of nine defeats and the tro
phies of only three victories, with two
drawn games. Yet they won in Austra
lia and New Zealand a thing that is
far greater than any record of contests.
They conquered the two islands from
shore to shore and every sportsman in
them by their clean cut behavior, their
loyalty to one another anil their de
sire to keep as far as possible from
objectionable tactics. The Sydney
Referee, a great Rugby paper in the
principal city of Australia says of
them, that"the Americans are thorough
sportsmen. They have played the
game strenuously and with scrupulous
fairness. There has never been a more
loyal set of men on tour, never si team
1 liiil had a higher conception of what
was necessary to their physical wel
fare.'' A similar estimation of the
American college players, Stanford,
California and Nevada Varsity men,
was voiced all over the two islands,
and "Young America," as the Sydney
Star called them, captured 'lie hearts
of all by their conduct, while they ex
cited the greatest admiration for their
playing in a land where Rugby is al
most one of the seven wonders of the
world.
The men in the All-America team
were: Brown, Cheda, Dole, Erb, Fitt
ing, Horton, Kern, Mint urn, Roth and
1 anborn of Stanford; Allen, Bennett,
Cerf, Dwiggins, Elliott, Hardy, Harris,
Morris, Northcroft, Pauley, Phleger,
Schwartz, and Watts of California;

and J. C. Schaeffer, U. C. '09, as Coach.
