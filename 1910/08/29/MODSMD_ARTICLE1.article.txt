# COLLEGE RUGBY SQUAD MAKES REMARKABLE RECORD ON TRIP
## 
### 
The American Rugby Varsity men
returned to their home land from Aus
tralia last Monday, reaching this part
of the Coast from Vancouver a few
days later. They bear the scars and
wounds of nine defeats and the tro
phies of only three victories, with two
drawn games. Yet they won in Austra
lia and New Zealand a thing that is
far greater than any record of contests.
They conquered the two islands from
shore to shore and every sportsman in
them by their clean cut behavior, their
loyalty to one another anil their de
sire to keep as far as possible from
objectionable tactics. The Sydney
Referee, a great Rugby paper in the
principal city of Australia says of
them, that"the Americans are thorough
sportsmen. They have played the
game strenuously and with scrupulous
fairness. There has never been a more
loyal set of men on tour, never si team
1 liiil had a higher conception of what
was necessary to their physical wel
fare.'' A similar estimation of the
American college players, Stanford,
California and Nevada Varsity men,
was voiced all over the two islands,
and "Young America," as the Sydney
Star called them, captured 'lie hearts
of all by their conduct, while they ex
cited the greatest admiration for their
playing in a land where Rugby is al
most one of the seven wonders of the
world.
The men in the All-America team
were: Brown, Cheda, Dole, Erb, Fitt
ing, Horton, Kern, Mint urn, Roth and
1 anborn of Stanford; Allen, Bennett,
Cerf, Dwiggins, Elliott, Hardy, Harris,
Morris, Northcroft, Pauley, Phleger,
Schwartz, and Watts of California;
with D. \V. Burbank, '09, as Manager
and J. C. Schaeffer, U. C. '09, as Coach.
C. Thorpe, '09, joined the team for
three games during the stay. The bat
tles that these men fought with de
feats or victories is told in the short
summary at the top of the column.
They did their best in training and in
playing and are given full credit for
all they accomplished by the southern
island papers. In definite criticism the
experts of the Antipodes say that for
dribbling the American forwards were
unsurpassed, that in kicking for
touch the brilliant full-back Brown
was superior even to their battle
proven heroes. Passing, however, they
say has not yet become second nature
to the Pacific Coast players, but that it
will come to them as a knack is the
prophecy of all the best judges and
most important newspapers in the far
away country. All these critics join
also in affirming that the American
college men only lack the polished
ease of the game to make them great,—
that in critical moments they have to
stop and think, if even for a fraction of
a second, and this lose 3 the advantage
they have gained. When each move in
their play is carried out with instan
taneous reasoning, then the Yankees
will be unconquerable. As the Sydney
Star says in regard to this, that "a
Eeaeon or two more of the training
which the Americans seem to have had
should make them among the best, if
not the best, exponents of the Rugby
Union game in the world. The marvel
of it is that players who are barely
out of their years of youth should in

four years see the game for the first
time, learn the rules, master the play
and come within an ace of being the
superiors of world renowned teanis„
