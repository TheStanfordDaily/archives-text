# STANFORD EIGHT BEATEN IN RACE WITH WASHINGTON
## 
### 
Rough water was responsible for the
defeat, of the Stanford oarsmen in
their race against the University of
Washington eight for the champion
ship of the Coast on May 2(5. The Car
dinal shell swamped at the two mile
buoy, while the heavy-weather Wash
ington boat stayed afloat until the line
was crossed.
The race on May 25 resulted in dis
aster to both crews. The shells left
the starting point at 12:30 and im
mediately commenced to fill with
water. Stanford jumped into the lead
at the start, rowing 34 strokes to the
minute. Washington started out at a
38 clip. The Northern eight gradually
drew up to their opponents and passed
them at the The Cardinal
boat swamped at the end of another
quarter mile with Washington a short
distance ahead. The latter shell lasted
six lengths more, when it was over
come by the heavy waves and broken
in half. Coxswain F. L. Guerena, of
the Stanford eight, being benumbed in
the cold water narrowly escaped
drowning.
The judges awarded the race to
Washington, but on the Northern
men's refusal to accept the decision,
declared there had been no race, as
neither crew had finished.
Both crews were in the water for the
start next day at 9:30, the Washington
men having agreed to pospone leaving
for Wisconsin one day. The crews
started with a last stroke. At the half
mile, both were rowing 38 strokes to
the minute. At the end ot' the first
mile the two crews were tie,
Washington using a heavy boat es
pecially built for rough weather. The
course, while not as rough as on the
previous day, was still too choppy for
the Cardinal boat. At the end of the
second mile Stanford's hopes of vic
tory vanished when their shell swamp
ed. Washington continued and crossed
the finish line, having rowed the three
miles in a trifle over 19 minutes.
Both crews averaged the same in
weight, namely, 173 pounds to the man.
Washington's best time over the course
in practice was 16 minutes and 32 sec
onds. On their second trial, the Stan
ford crew covered the three miles in
17 minutes and 20 seconds.
Washington used a faster stroke
than last year. Formerly they used a
maximum stroke of 32, this year they
rowed up to 38.
The regatta proved conclusively that
the shell used by the Cardinal oarsmen
is not a rough water boat.
Next year a whole week will be set
aside for the regatta and the race will
be rowed on the first calm day.
Washigton left immediately after,
the contest for Wisconsin, where they
were defeated in their race against the
eight from the State University there
by a margin of 15 seconds.
The Stanford crew was composed as
follows: How, It. 11. Seward, '12; No.

Rough water was responsible for the
defeat, of the Stanford oarsmen in
their race against the University of
Washington eight for the champion
ship of the Coast on May 2(5. The Car
dinal shell swamped at the two mile
buoy, while the heavy-weather Wash
ington boat stayed afloat until the line
was crossed.
The race on May 25 resulted in dis
aster to both crews. The shells left
the starting point at 12:30 and im
mediately commenced to fill with
water. Stanford jumped into the lead
at the start, rowing 34 strokes to the
minute. Washington started out at a
38 clip. The Northern eight gradually
drew up to their opponents and passed
them at the The Cardinal
boat swamped at the end of another
quarter mile with Washington a short
distance ahead. The latter shell lasted
six lengths more, when it was over
come by the heavy waves and broken
in half. Coxswain F. L. Guerena, of
the Stanford eight, being benumbed in
the cold water narrowly escaped
drowning.
The judges awarded the race to
Washington, but on the Northern
men's refusal to accept the decision,
declared there had been no race, as
neither crew had finished.
Both crews were in the water for the
start next day at 9:30, the Washington
men having agreed to pospone leaving
for Wisconsin one day. The crews
started with a last stroke. At the half
mile, both were rowing 38 strokes to
the minute. At the end ot' the first
mile the two crews were tie,
Washington using a heavy boat es
pecially built for rough weather. The
course, while not as rough as on the
previous day, was still too choppy for
the Cardinal boat. At the end of the
second mile Stanford's hopes of vic
tory vanished when their shell swamp
ed. Washington continued and crossed
the finish line, having rowed the three
miles in a trifle over 19 minutes.
Both crews averaged the same in
weight, namely, 173 pounds to the man.
Washington's best time over the course
in practice was 16 minutes and 32 sec
onds. On their second trial, the Stan
ford crew covered the three miles in
17 minutes and 20 seconds.
Washington used a faster stroke
than last year. Formerly they used a
maximum stroke of 32, this year they
rowed up to 38.
The regatta proved conclusively that
the shell used by the Cardinal oarsmen
is not a rough water boat.
Next year a whole week will be set
aside for the regatta and the race will
be rowed on the first calm day.
Washigton left immediately after,
the contest for Wisconsin, where they
were defeated in their race against the
eight from the State University there
by a margin of 15 seconds.
