# STANFORD TAKES SECOND IN RECORD-BREAKING MEET
## 
### 
To gain second honors in the fastest
track meet of the year was the achieve
ment of the group of Stanford athletes
who journeyed to Champaign, Illinois,
last June. Each event in the big Con
ference meet was contested by a gal
axy of stars and that Norte Dame gath
ered first place was due to the wonder
ful work of Philbrook, who scored 11
points in the field events.
The classiness of the meet is shown
by a glance at the summary. Three
heats of the hundred were covered in
even time, while Davenport of Chicago
and Baker of Oberlin can show their
heels to any pair of runners in the
country. Davenport, however, had a
hard task in taking Wyman's measure
in the quarter-mile. The Cardinal run
ner jumped in front at the crack of
the gun and gained a lead of several
yards, which the Chicago man only
overcame in the last hundred yards.
Wyman covered the distance in:49:1,
forcing the winner to set a new record
of :48.4.
Baker of Oberlin was in a class by
himself in the long runs. The mile
was clipped off in 4:20 4-5, while the
wonderful distance man came back
strong enough in the two-mile to win
easily in 9:50. Coleman and Captain
Bellah were not in the best, of condi
tion 011 account of the change of cli
mate . Consequently they did not
figure largely in the scoring, although
Bellah took second in the vault and
third in the broad-jump. Coleman in
shape should have landed a place in
the furlong, which was won by Nelson
of Washington, in : 21.4.
Wool ley the Cardinal hammer throw
er, was the only man in that event who
weighed less than 180 pounds, yet the
light Californian managed to outdis
tance by some four feet liis nearest
competitor. The relay race went to
Stanford easily, the winning team be
ing composed of Coleman, Taylor,
Stolz and Wyman.
The disqualification of Captain
Scott at the last minute deprived Stan
ford of a certain five points, but it is
doubtful if this would have altered
the final outcome.
Two meets were held en route to
Champaign. The first at Provo, Utah,
was an easy victory for the Cardinal,
with a score of 03 to 33. Brigham
Young University only succeeded in
taking first place in the half mile run,
the low and high hurdles. The Col
orado meet, at Boulder, was another
easy victory for the wearers of the
Cardinal, the final score being I\/ to
50'/j. In this meet, L. S. Scott created
a new world's record in the pole vault
by clearing the bar at a height of 12
feet, 10:7-8 inches. G. L. Horine, es
tablished a Colorado record in the high
jump by leaping C> feet, 2*4 inches.
