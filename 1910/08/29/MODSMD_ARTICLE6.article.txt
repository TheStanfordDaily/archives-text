With this first issue of the thirty
seventh volume of the Dally Palo Alto
there is little necessity for a lengthy
discussion of the policy that the paper
will assume during the present semes
ter. The official publication of the
Student Body has always been a con
servative, reliable and fair-minded
newspaper and it will be the endeavor
of the present management to make
the paper conform to these principles.
The Daily Palo Alto should voice the
sentiments and the thoughts of the
Student Body and it is the intention of
the paper to place these opinions be
fore the Associated Students in a con
servative, truthful manner and also to
give them all the news relating to col
lege activities in as expeditious a man
ner as possible.
