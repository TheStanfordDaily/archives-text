According to the custom of the Daily
Palo Alto, a series of tryouts will be
inaugurated at the present time for all
those who wish to compete for a place
upon the editorial staff of the official
publication of the Student Body. This
trial will extend over a period of six
weeks and will give those trying for
a position ample opportunity to prove
their ability and their right to a posi
tion upon the paper. All candidates
will be given assignments tomorrow
afternoon at the Daily Palo Alto of
fice upon application and it is hoped
that freshmen especially will avail
themselves of this opportunity to enter
the journalistic field here at Stanford.
