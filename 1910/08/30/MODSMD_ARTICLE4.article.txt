# FOOTBALL SOON TO HOLD STAGE
## FIRST WORK IN RUGBY WILL START ON SATURDAY. Rally Set for Friday Night Gives All Candidates First Chance to Sign Up. 
### 
Coach George J. Presley announces
the opening of the football season for
next Saturday afternoon at 3:30. At
that time all candidates for Cardinal
teams, both Freshman and Varsity,

is in excellent shape for play.
The big rally in Encina Clubroom,
as a preliminary to Saturday's opening,
is to be arranged for Thursday night,
when all prospective Rugby players
will sign up. All records were broken
in the number of men, one hundred and
ninety-two in all, who appeared as
candidates last fall, and the lists this
fall are expected to be still larger.
Men reporting for first practice on
Saturday will be expected to be equip
ped with suits. These can be secured
in ample time for the afternoon hour
from Manager Burbank, whose notice
appears in another column. There will
be no trouble in getting the necessary
outfits, since he will have full supplies
on hand.
With the opening of tlie pigskin work
on Saturday, practice will be held
regularly thereafter at 4:45 every
weekday afternoon. Coaching methods
will follow the usual line this year.
One or two of the older players will
be called upon to assist Coach Presley
in the early preliminary work.
