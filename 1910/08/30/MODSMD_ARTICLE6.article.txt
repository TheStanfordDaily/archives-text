# PRESIDENT JORDAN MAKING EXTENDED TOUR IN EUROPE
## 
### 
After a short tour in Europe, Pres
ident Jordan has decided to pursue his
work in connection with various in
ternational conferences and will re
main on the continent on sabbatical
leave during the entire first semester
of the coming year.
President Jordan, since the closing
of college this spring, has been very
actively engaged in international
movements in many lines. His first
work, which continued until the middle
of June, was in connection with the
International Fisheries Commission in
the region of the Great Lakes. During
the following month he devoted his
time to the International School of
Peace which was at that time in ses
sion at Boston. Following this, he de
livered the commencement address at
Swathmore College and delivered two
of his famous addresses before the Na

tional p]ducation Association at Boston,
â€”one on "War and Manhood," the
other on "Football."
Sailing for England on .inly 23, Pres
ident Jordan made a short stay in
London where he was the guest of H.
C. Hoover, '95. He then made the trip
to Berlin, where he addressed both the
World's Peace Congress and the Con
gress of Liberal Religions. His next
move was to Austria, where he at
tended the International Zoological
Congress at Gratz, and from there to
Antwerp, where he was present as a
delegate at the Free Trade Congress.
President Jordan will remain in
Europe about two months longer and
will probably return to the United
States in the latter part of October.
He will resume his work at Stanford
at the beginning of the second
semester.
