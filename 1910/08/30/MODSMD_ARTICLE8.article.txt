# FUND IS INCREASING
## MONEY FOR UNION AMOUNTS TO OVER $18,000. Work by Collectors in Summer Swells Sum on Hand Within $7,000 of Required Amount. 
### 
During the past summer the Student
Committee that has been raising funds
for the erection of the Stanford Union
has been busily engaged in the collec
tion of money from those who have
subscribed toward this movement. But
despite this fact, there are many who
have not paid into the collectors of the
committee the installments that are at
the present due to be paid. Many who
have also paid their iirst payment and
who may be able to make a second in
stallment have not as yet made any
payments.
As has been stated before, the Board
of Trustees of the Union have definite
ly decided that 110 active operations
can begin until those who have the
collection of the money in charge have
raised the sum of $25,000. At the pres
ent writing Permanent Secretary It.
W. Barrett and the local committee
have succeeded in collecting over $18,-
000 thus far and they are hopeful that
within (he next few months enough
will be secured from those who have
subscribed to swell the fund to the re
quired amount.
The Trustees expect to secure this
extra $7,000 within a few months and
at that time ground will be broken and
the corner stone laid for the $50,000
and possibly the $SO,OOO building that
is to be erected.
On account of several vacancies oc
curing upon the student board that has
charge of the collection of student
subscriptions, new apoplntments have
been made by Student Body President,
G. A. Ditz. The committee is now com
posed of, J. P. Levy, '10, H. Swafford,
11, F. L. Hilton, '11, C. R. Nunan, '12,
G. B. Lantz, '12, H. C. Boyd, '13, E. F.
