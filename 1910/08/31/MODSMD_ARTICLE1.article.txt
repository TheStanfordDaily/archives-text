vogue for the last three years and but
few changes were made in the rules in
force in the 1912-1913 rush. Besides

The only change which was made in
the rules of the rush relates to its time
and the conclusion. Owing to the un
satisfactory results of the extremely
long rush of last year, the committee
decided to limit the contest to thirty
minutes, giving the referee the option
of continuing it for five minutes longer
if he thinks that within that time one
class will be tied up. A request is
also made that heavy shoes be not
worn. All men who have tenis shoes
are requested to wear them. The rule
requiring that both the hands and feet
be tied is especially emphasized. The
rules as a whole are as follows:
1. The place of the contest shall be
the Varsity football field.
2. The event shall consist of a tying
contest between the men of the Fresh
man and Sophomore classes.
3. The contest shall take place with
in a marked enclosure.
4. There shall be no one in the field
except the upper-class officials and the
contestants.
5. Any contesant who voluntarily
leaves the enclosure shall be disqual
ified.
6. There shall be a "morgue" at each
end of the field to receive all contest
ants having both hands and feet tied.
Once placed in the "morgue" the con
testant shall be out of the contest.
7. The contest shall be decided in
favor of the class which has placed
the greater number of opponents in the
"morgue."
8. Any tied man may be rescued un
til he is placed in the "morgue."
9. The classes shall form in front of
their opponents "morgue."
10. At a signal by pistol fire, given
by the referee, the contest shall com
mence and continue for thirty minutes,
or if in the referee's opinion one class
will be tied up in five minutes longer,
it shall continue for thirty-five min
utes. At a second signal from the
referee the contest shall immediately
cease. The score shall then be taken
by the upperclass officials.
11. Regulation bandages only shall
be used, which shall be cotton drilling
not longer than 48 inched and at least
6 inches wide.
12. It is understood that in all con
tests of this nature no slugging or
knives for cutting bandages will be
tolerated.
13. No profanity or hair pulling will
be tolerated.
The final rules and regulations gov
erning the Freshman-Sophomore rush,
to be held on the Stanford Field, Fri
day afternoon were drawn up this
afternoon by the committee of ten
upperclassmen appointed by Student
Advisor Roth. It was decided to con
tinue the usual rope tying contest in
vogue for the last three years and but
few changes were made in the rules in
force in the 1912-1913 rush. Besides
this, the upperclass officials, who will
see that the rush is carried on in ap
proved fashion, were also selected.
