# WILL CALL ELECTIONS
## UNIVERSITY CONFERENCE TO MEET FRIDAY AFTERNOON. Many Vacancies in Important Organization to be Filled Shortly by Departmental Electors. 
### 
By way of starting immediately the
important work which the University
Conference hopes to accomplish this
college year, Student Advisor A. E.
Roth, '09, in the absence of President
S. A. Lindauer, '10, has called the first
meeting of the Conference for Firday
afternoon at 1:10 o'clock in the Coun
cil Room. All of last year's members
who have registered in college are ur
gently requested to be present at that
time as it is felt to be important that
a full membership take part in the in
itial meeting.
Although it is not definitely known
just what business will be considered
by the Conference, the main reason for
the meeting is the desire to provide
for the election of new members to fill
the vacancies caused by the non-re
turn of many of the old men. As the
constitution of the organization pro
vides that the tenure of office shall
continue for two years, the elections
held in the various departments this
year will be special elections. Those
elected then, will serve out the re
maining year of the absentee's terms.
Fully half of the old members have not
returned, so that the complexion of
this important body will be materially
changed by this semester's elections.
Aside from the general departmental
elections, important elections within
the Conference itself must also be held
shortly. Although it will have to
struggle through its initial meeting
without the guiding hand of its presi
dent, vice-president, or secretary, it
will undoubtedly be decided Friday to
postpone the selection of officers until
all vacancies in the membership are
filled. Besides the officers, the Confer
ence will have the important duty of
electing a majority of the Student
Advisory Committee, the central work
ing body of the organization. Three of
its last semester's members, F. W.
McNulty, '09, M. Y. Malone, '10, and B.
W. Upson, '10, have left college, thus
leaving H. McCowen, '09, and T. B.
Hine, '10, to form the neucleus for a
new committee. When the three new
members are chosen a new chairman
must be selected by the committee.
