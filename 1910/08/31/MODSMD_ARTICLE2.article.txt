# EXECUTIVE BOARD HOLDS FIRST MEETING OF YEAR
## 
### 
Because of the fact that several
members of the present Executive
Committee had not arrived on the
campus last evening when the meeting
was held, the regular business of the
day was postponed until next week
and only those points which were ab
solutely necessary to pass upon were
considered.
The first matter that was taken up
was the setting of the time for the
regular meeting of the committee.
After some discussion, it was decided
to hold it at the same time as last year,
namely every Wednesday evening at S
o'clock.
G. A. Ditz, '11, President of the Stu
dent Body, and also incumbent repre
sentative from the Class of 1911, upon
the Executive Board, resigned his po
sition as class representative last
evening, as the Constitution of the
Student Body requires. The resigna
tion was accepted. This leaves a place
open on the Committee, which will be
filled by appointment at the next meet
ing. It also seems likely at the pres
ent time that Vice-President M. Y.
Malone, '10, will not return to the
University, in which case, this place
will also have to be filled at the next
meeting.
Letters of appreciation were drafted
last evening, addressed to the Rugby
Unions of New Zealand and New South
Wales, expressing the thanks of the
University for the splendid manner in

which the men who made the trip to
the Antipodes were entertained, and
the sportsmanlike manner in which the
games were played. These will be sent
to Australia at the first opportunity.
It was decided to institute a new de
parture in the reporting of the work
done by the Committee in the Daily
Palo Alto. In the past, the meetings
have been reported in a general man
ner. In the future the meetings will
be reported by reprinting in the Daily
Palo Alto the actual minutes of the
meeting. The minutes may be com
mented on at the discretion of the
editor-in-chief of the paper, thus in
suring the reports from any errors
that might creep in, and at the same
time will leave a field for discussion,
as in the past.
It was decided last evening to com
municate with the merchants of Palo
Alto in regard to the supply of rooters
hats for the big game. In the past
the hats have been ordered from San
Jose, but if the Palo Alto merchants
wish this year to supply the hats, they
will be gvien the opportunity to do so.
Otherwise the hats will be ordered
from San Jose.
Tt was decided that at the next meet
ing any vacancies then existing would
be filled; that all the committees for
the year would be appointed and that
any other business of a regular nature
postponed until that time would be
transacted.
