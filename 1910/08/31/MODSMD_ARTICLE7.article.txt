# SEASON OPENS MONDAY
## FIRST FOOTBALL PRACTICE POSTPONED UNTIL NEXT WEEK. Couch Presley Changes Date Owing to Strenuous Character of Freshman-Sophomore Rush 
### 
The opening practice in Rugby has
been postponed from Saturday to Mon
day afternoon at 4:30. There will be
no work of any kind on Saturday.
This change, a radical one, was made
after much consideration by Coach
Presley. The experience of former
years seems to show that the Fresh
men and Sophomore Rugby candidates,
who take part in the annual rush on
Friday afternoon cannot give their
best efforts to the initial football work,
coming as it does the next day. The
two lower classes will therefore be
given a good two days rest before ap
pearing in togs for the season. Never
before has the first appearance of the
athletes been made on any day but
Saturday, but (he importance of a good
start has made the change necessary.
The sawdust field will still be the
meeting place, and the supplies of
suits and other necessaries of the out
fits can be secured from Manager Bur
bank at the same time as stated yes
terday.
The Varsity schedule is not yet
complete, but can be looked for in a
few days. Several games are still in
the air, making it imperative to hold
back the game list. It is known that
a new game from the south may
materialize, in the form of a match
with the U. S. C. Law School. This
institution has a registration of 400
men and could line up a team strong
enough to make it worth while
