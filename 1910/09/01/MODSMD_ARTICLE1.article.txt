Printed in green ink, the Freshman

the campus tomorrow. The initial edi
tion is characterized by an unusual
amount of snap and vim and is en
livened by considerable art work.
There are two full page poems in
the front of the magazine, "The Lady
of Today", by Frank E. Hill, '11, and
"A Reverie" by E. C. Matthias, '11,
Editor Mathias' "Now Thats" deal
with the opening of college, a word to
the Freshmen and the Stanford spirit,
with a few words on the policy to be
pursued by the Chaparral during the
present semester.
Among the articles worthy of espec
ial consideration are "Supplement to
the Y. M. C. A. Handbook" by Bruce
Bliven, '11, "The Dream Girl" by E. M.
Albright, '12, and "By the Dreamy San
Fran-mosquito" by A. J. Hall, Jr., '13.

tributed by A. T. King, '12, E. M. Al
bright. '12, F. E. Hill, '11, J. L. Duff,
'12, R. H. Hellman, '11, Stan Dixon,
