No Freshman should allow the op
portunity of showing his class spirit to
slip past tomorrow afternoon without
taking advantage of it, which means
that every man in the Class of 1914,
unless physically incapacitated, should
report on the old baseball field at three
o'clock. Class spirit is essential for
a strong class organization and this is
the first and one of the most effective
ways of manifesting that element that
the Freshmen can enploy. With a
strongly organized force opposing
them, the new arrivals will need every
man in their class upon the field and
it behooves each individual Freshman
to enter the lists. It also becomes
every man in that organization to re
member that this is a fairly played,
competitive fight and that all under
handed, unsportsmanlike tactics are
strictly forbidden. This is the Fresh
man's first opportunity to play fair,
according to Stanford traditions, and
he should accept this standard laid
down before him by those who have
made Stanford's name what it is and
endeavor to live up to it. This applies
also to every Sophomore, but they
have had the advantage of one year's
training. Every Freshman should
enter the fight and each man should
play fairly.
