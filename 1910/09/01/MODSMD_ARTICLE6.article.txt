# STANFORD TO HAVE STRONG SOCCER TEAM THIS YEAR
## 
### 
That Soccer is going to be a popular
sport at Stanford again this year is
being manifested more each clay as not
only many of last year's team, but also
a large percentage of this year's
Freshman gymnasium class are sig
nifying their intention of joining the
soccer squad.
The squad is to begin practice Mon
day afternoon on the new field just
west of the gymnasium and the team
that, will be picked from these will
play its first game on October 1, in
San Francisco.
Last season, Stanford played as an
independent team, but this year, owing
to their being included in the Califor
nia Football League, they will be
classed as a league team and will
therefore be in line for the California
Cup offered by the above mentioned
league. Should Stanford win this ser
ies, she will not only hold the cup for
one year, but each player will also re
ceive a medal.
Just what the schedule of games will
be, will not be known until next Fri
day night, when a meeting of the Ex
ecutive Committee is to be held in San

Francisco. This much, though, has
been definitely decided, that there will
be no games played here on the camp
us until after the Varsity Rugby game
is over. All league games up to that
date will be played in San Francisco.
On the day of the big game and also
the Freshman game, the schedule has
been left open by all the league teams
so as in no way to interfere with Rug
by.
Professor M. Maloney who has taken
an active interest in the English game
ever since its introduction here and
who now has the squad in charge, has
! taken out fifty amateur cards with the
I California League and the Stanford
j team is to be picked from these. The
| extra men, after the team is picked,
1 will be divided into other teams and
( throughout the season will play among
I themselves for the championship of
j Encina gymnasium.
I At the last meeting of the Executive
Committee, the matter of uniforms and
an official name came up. The matter
was finally disposed of by accepting as
a name that of the Stanford Gymnas
ium Soccer Team and using as a uni
form a gray sweater, gray stockings
and white track pants.
At this same meeting Professor
Maloney wau elected one of the vice
presidents of the league and Professor
R. R. Long was appointed as one of
the members of the executive com
mittee.
The teams that are to compete
against Stanford are, the Olympics,
Vampires, Thistles, Barbarians, Pas
time Club, and the Alliance Club and

considering the fact that these are
supposed to be the six best teams
around the bay, it speaks well of the
high class of Soccer that must have
been played by the Stanford men last
year.
