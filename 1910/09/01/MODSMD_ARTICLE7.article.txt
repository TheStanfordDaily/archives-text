# HARD FIGHT EXPECTED
## FRESHMEN AND SOPHOMORES MEET TOMORROW IN RUSH. Both Classes Prepare for Rig Rattle. Football Field Will be Scene of the Struggle. 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon at four o'clock,
the classes of 1913 and 1914 will meet
on Stanford Field for the battle of
their lives. At that time, the crack of
Referee Presley's pistol will be heard
and the two underclasses will rush to
the center of the turf and open the
thirty minute contest, which judging
from the plans and organization of
both classes, will prove one of the
hardest fought Freshman-Sophmore
rushes since the institution of the ty
ing contest. Both classes will meet
previous to the rush and perfect an
organization preparatory for the fight.
The rules and regulations as adopted
by the committee of ten upperclass
men and published in the Daily Palo
Alto yesterday evening, will govern
the entire contest and fifty upperclass
officials will be on the field to see that
the rush is conducted in entire fair
ness to both sides. In speaking of this
feature of the rush, President G. A.
Ditz, '11, of the Associated Students
said:
"Every Freshman in college should
show the greatest of class patriotism
and meet with his classmates on the
baseball field an hour before the rush
and there receive instructions from the
Juniors as to how the rush is carried
on. Each of them may be assured of a
square deal from the officials who are
to be on the grounds to see that the
rules are obeyed to the letter."
The necessary paraphenalia for a
battle royal are already prepared. A
large number of Freshmen were kept
busy yesterday afternoon preparing
the "ropes." These are of cotton dril
ling, six inches in width so that no
serious effects from them will be felt
by the contestants. The Freshmen will
be able to distinguish each other by
identification marks which will be
provided by the Juniors before the
rush.
