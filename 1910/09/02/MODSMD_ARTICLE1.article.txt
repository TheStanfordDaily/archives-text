# SOPHOMORES WIN FIERCE RUSH.
## 1914 Rested in Annual Underclass Contest for Supremacy.â€”Second Year Men Have Hard Task. 
### 
After a hard and bitterly fought con
test, the Class of 1913 emerged as vic
tor from the annual underclass rush.
In the allotted minutes that the con
test endured many Sophomores were
stored away in the Freshman morgue,
and when the smoke had cleared away,
not one Freshman was to be seen on
the field. The victory of 1913 was by
no means easy as the new men entered
the contest fired with enthusiasm ami
roused to a high pitch of excitement
by the purloining of the Sophomore
posters early in the morning.
The superior organization of the
wearers of the red hats was the only
thing which brought victory to them,
as the Freshman Class put on the field
a rugged lot of men whose great handi
cap was their unfamiliarity with each
other. Single combats in different
parts of the field afforded the greatest
amusement to the spectators as ap
parently many of the belligerents had
a previous acquaintance. For game
ness, tbe work of the Freshmen was
hard to beat and though they went
down to defeat, it was not disgrace.
The 1914 contestants were organized
on the old baseball diamond by mem
bers of the Junior Class and under the
tutelage of the upperclassmen, re
ceived pointers on the tie-up. In order
the more readily to recognize one an
other in the hurly-burly of the contest,
yellow ribbons were provided the
Freshmen. The Sophomores required
no distinguishing marks.
The Sophomores numbered 171 men
while tbe Freshmen had 180 in the
fray. The rush lasted 30 minutes.
