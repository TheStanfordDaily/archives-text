# Student Still Missing.
## 
### 
No trace has been found of Paul
Foote, the prospective Freshman, who
suddenly dropped from sight last
Tuesday night, and no word has been
received from his relatives in Kalis
pell, Montana.
Foote's effects remain undisturbed
in his room, and no reason for his dis
appearance has been suggested other
than that he has either met with foul
play or that he has become mentally
deranged.
