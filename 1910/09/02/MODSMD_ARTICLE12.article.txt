In another column of this issue,
Student Body Manager D. YV. Burbank
has stated that the finances of the As
sociated Students are suffering at pres
ent under a deficit of $GOO.OO in the
semester assessments. The monthly
record of the Student Body has never
been in such a position where a delin
quency such as this would not be felt
throughout the year in the athletic
field and with the increased expendi
tures accruing yearly, the Associated
Students cannot afford to lose this
amount. The excuse offered by those
who have not paid their assessments is
not lack of spirit, but lack of funds on
account of an additional registration
fees. Every old student was aware of
the extra registration fee before he
left college last May. Every student
who registered this year should have
made preparation for the payment of
the assessment they knew to be so
importantâ€”and indispensible. Very
few members of the Student Body have
any legitimate excuse for such delin
quency in the annual payment of these
dues and there are many who cannot
give any at.all. Those who have failed
to make this payment may do so at any
time and it will be gratifying to hear
of an increased payment within the
next few days. The Student Body can
not be conducted without finances and
no member of that organization has
the right to allow it to suffer from lack
of a willingness to make a small sac
rifice.
