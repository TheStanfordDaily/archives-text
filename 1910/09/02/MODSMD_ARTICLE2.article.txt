# POSTERS FINALLY REACH CAMPUS
## Sophomores and Freshmen Have Strenuous Fight for First Honors in Customary Clash. 
### 
Never before in the history of
underclass rivalry at Stanford has
there been so much excitement as de
veloped last evening in connection
with the putting up of the posters of
the Class of 1913. The Freshmen way
laid an automobile containing the post
ers on the masonry bridge 011 the other
side of Mayfield and the posters were
captured and destroyed.
Turning the machine back to San
Jose, the Sophomores aroused the
printer who had done the work on the
poster and with him hurried back to
the office where a new edition of the
poster was run off.
With the posters again in the ma
chine the return trip was commenced.
While these things had been going
out the Sophomores on the campus had
been notified and several machines set
out. for San Jose.
At Los Altos the posters were trans
ferred to a speedier machine and the
second lap of the relay began. With
a final spurt the posters arrived and
their pasting up was only a matter of
a few minutes time. Practically no
opposition was encountered, the Fresh
men evidently thinking that their duty
had been done.
