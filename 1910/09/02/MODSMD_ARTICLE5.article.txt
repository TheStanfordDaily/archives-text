# Student Money Is Not Plentiful.

### 
The student treasury will run far
behind during 1910-11 as far as actual
money received from the student as
sessments of two dollars is concerned.
With but $16SS in the hands of Man
ager Burbank now last year's total of
$2234 reveals a startling decrease this
fall of almost $600. A $000 decrease
in the manager's funds will handicap
him throughout the year. Repairing
must be curtailed, athletic improve
ments dropped off the lists and many
new features contributed to the con
venience of the students abandoned.
Blame for the smallest of the total now
is placed upon the new fee of fifteen
dollars required of all students each
semetser.
