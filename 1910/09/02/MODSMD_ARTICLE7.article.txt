# PLEA FOR HARMONY MADE BY FACULTY IN ASSEMBLY
## 
### 
The Faculty last evening made a big
step toward creating a better feeling
between themselves and the students
by the frank and emphatic manner
they presented themselves to the
Freshmen of the University at the first
public Assembly of the collegiate year.
The meeting was not well attended,
and although there was not a surplus
of enthusiasm, the Asesmbly had a
significance of its own which was
tremendous in scope to those who at
tended, as it was the first meeting the
faculty has ever held, and the first
time they have ever made any great
and public effort to say to the new
studentsâ€”"VVe are glad to see you."
It was a meeting of good fellow
strangers attempting to become at
once good friends, and the aftermath
indicates that its success will be so
great that the Assembly will become
a permanent part of the program for
greeting the new Stanford students
at the beginning of each year.
The speakers of the evening were all
members of the faculty, and every one
dwelt upon the imperative necessity
for harmony among all factions, all
nationalities, all organizations, and
especially between the officers of the
University and the student. Every
speaker showed a determination to
make the Freshmen understand that
the Faculty was always ready to help
them in every possible way and give
them a sympathetic hearing, not only
on academic matters, but on any sub
ject that should be burdening any
member of the institution. The per
sistent way in which the speakers
drove this point into the minds of the
auditors was a harmony maker within
itself, as it assured the Freshmen that
they had friends here, who had not
only friendship to give them, but ad
vice and competent ability to help
them make their tribulations here as
easy and peaceful as possible.

Chairman G. J. Pierce, of the Public
Exercises Committee opened the meet
ing. He declared that this meeting
was purely for the purpose of getting
acquainted with the matriculating stu
dent, and to explain to them a little I
about the college they are entering, I
and the attitude of the instructors to
ward them. Chairman Pierce, before
introducing Acting-President Branner,
stated that Stanford is an institution
known everywhere, and that its for
tunes and misfortunes were shared by
all people, and we must remember that
we have a share also.
Professor Branner, in taking tho
floor, explained to the students in a
brief and decisive manner a little his
tory about Stanford, and concluded in
giving the Freshmen a cordial wel
come. He said: "We sincerely wel
come the new and old student, the new
and old members of the Faculty. Let
us remember, and take care of what we
have. The idea of the Faculty is to
fix our intention 011 getting an educa
tion. The students all want a feeling
of responsibility, whether social, mor
al, financial, or physical."
Professor \V. F. Durand followed Mr. I
Branner. He at once plunged into the
substance of his topic, and came out
squarely with the issue he wished to
comment upon. He at once declared
for an unalterable feeling of harmony
between the students and the faculty.
He asserted emphatically that the key
note of the life here is loyalty and
sympathy. In part, Dr. Durand said:
"The beginning of things is always im
portant. This is the beginning of the
new year here. The keynote that
should prevail is loyalty, sympathy,
harmony between all of us, both stu
dents and faculty. Responsibility lies
on both sides. The good name of the
University is in the hands of all of us. J
Our happiness is up to us. We are all (
