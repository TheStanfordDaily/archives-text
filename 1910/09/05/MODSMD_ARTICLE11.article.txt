# COLLEGE MEN SUBMIT TO TEST.
## "Poison Squad" Will Live on Prepared Fruits to Determine Effects of Sulphur. 
### 
Twenty Stanford students have
agreed to submit themselves to the
government for experimental purposes
in order to determine the effect of the
consumption of dried fruits on the
health. The tests are probably an out
come of the recent discussion on the
use of sulphur in the curing of Califor
nia fruits as only fruits prepared ac
cording to the so-called California or
sulphur process are to be tested.
The men will be required to take
their meals together and will be given
substantial food, which the govern
ment will provide. For dessert the
fruits variously prepared will be
served. Each week it is likely that the
men will be examined physically and
comparisons made with their condition
at the beginning of the experiment.
Work of a similar nature was conduct
ed some time ago at the University of
California and the tests here may be
merely in the nature of checking up
previous results.
Funds for the work were secured
from the government through the in
strumentality of Dr. Swain of the
Chemistry department. Professor
Swain will have charge of the under
taking as he is a member of the Ref
eree board, which is conducting the
investigation as to the effect of sul
phur.
