# BOAT CLUB HAS SURPLUS.
## Fall Training For Freshmen Candidates is Proposed.â€”Equipment in Good Shape. 
### 
A surplus of nearly $100, and all ex
penses paid, is the story of the finances
of the Stanford Boat Club for last
year. About the middle of this month,
the club will probably elect officers
and decide upon the plans for the com
ing year. Next week a representative
from the local club will be sent to
meet the California organization and,
if possible, arrange all the details for
this year's races. An attempt will also
be made to arrange a series of regattas
with clubs from around the bay. As
usual, there will probably be no fall
training this year for the veterans, al
though it is quite possible that there
will be fall training for all Fresh
men who wish to try out for various
crews. With a period of fall training
for the first year men, it is hoped to be
able to turn out a good Freshman
eight. Already several of the new
comers have signified their willingness
to go out for fall training.
The shell that was damaged upon
the return trip is now being repaired
by a boat builder in Oakland and it
can be used during the coming season.
All the old boats will be overhauled
and repaired so that no new boats will
have to be purchased this year. The
club expects to purchase four new
rowing machines for the use of the
squad.
