# ALL HAZING TO BE STOPPED.
## The 						Committee on Student Affairs Commands that all Clashes Between Underclassmen Must End. 
### 
That the "rush" of last Friday after
noon was to end all clashes between
the Sophomores and Freshmen was the
decision of the Committee on Student
Affairs at a meeting last week.
The policy of the committee for the
coming year in regard to hazing is as
follows: "The committee is opposed
to all forms of hazing. It defines haz
ing as including all practices which
compel a student to submit to treat
ment from fellow students that is
humiliating and dangerous. Such

practices are regarded as infringment
of personal liberty and are an offense
against good order."
"In view of the offensive character
of the recent Freshmen-Sophomore
disturbances and of their interference
with the work of the University, the
practice of "tubbing" and all interfer
ences with the personal liberties of
fellow students is prohibited."
"It is understood that the "tying"
contest of last Friday afternoon is the
only event of the sort that is sanc
tioned and is to end all such clashes
between individuals and classes for the
academic year."
