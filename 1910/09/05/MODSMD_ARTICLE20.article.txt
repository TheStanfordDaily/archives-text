# PAUL FOOTE IS FOUND.
## Missing Freshman Appears in Sacramento and Relates Strange Story of His Experiences. 
### 
Paul Foote, who was discovered in
Sacramento Saturday after a disap
pearance of four days, is in the Pen
ninsular Hospital in Palo Alto seeking
to restore his overwrought nerves. He
is getting along satisfactorily and
will, it is thought, be in fit condition to
register Wednesday.
Foote told a remarkable story to
City Attorney .T. V. Hart of Sacra
mento. He stated that while on the
way from his room to the postoffice in
Palo Alto, he was seized by four mask
ed men and thrown into an automobile.
The machine, he says, was driven all
that night and the next day arrived at
some out of the way place, which he
thinks was beyond Stockton. Here he
was kept under guard until Friday,
when he was taken to within eight
miles of the Capitol City. Here he
states, a '10 was branded on his arm
with a hot wire and he was allowed to
go. He states that he was robbed of
$75 by his captors during his con
finement.
The theory advanced by some that
young Foote was being hazed appears
absurd, according to the story re
lated by him. Equally absurd is the
theory that he was a victim of pro
fessional robbers and the affair will
remain an enigma until additional evi
dence is forthcoming. Whether his
story is or is not true, his present con
dition indicates that he has passed
through some sort of an ordeal.
At noon today, the total number of
students who had registered in the
University was 1551.
