In the hope of retaining a Stanford
tradition and with the interest of the
Student Body fully in mind, the Uni
versity Conference has adopted the
rules for the coming Plug Ugly that
were drawn up last year. This organi
zation has also suggested to the two
upperclasses that these resolutions be
ratified at an early date, so that a
suitable farce could be produced in
sufficient time to insure a certain pre
sentation. The University Conference
is not endeavoring to eradicate, or cur
tail purposely, a tradition that has be
come distinctive with Stanford, but
they are making a strong effort to re
tain that custom. They realize that
the Plug Ugly has gone beyond the
original conception and purpose of the
custom and that it has assumed char
acteristics that are essentially danger
ous to all those who participate. If
the tradition is to be continued, it
must lose this nature and must be
conducted within reasonable limits.
The Conference is correct in its deduc
tions and conclusions and the organi
zation is to be commended upon then
action and the Classes of 1911 and
1912 are urged to take immediate ac
tion upon this matter, so that sufficient
time may be given to the production of
a Plug Ugly farce that will do credit
to the Junior Class.
