# 1914 PRESENTS TENNIS EXPERTS
## Classy Freshmen Players Will Give Varsity Men Close Contests for Old Positions Many New Entries 
### 
The warm weather of the past week
has enabled the tennis enthusiasts to
putin some good hard practice in
preparation for the handicap tourna
ment which is to be started next week.
Judging from the number that appear
on the En«ina courts from day to day,
this sport seems destined to attain
greater importance this year in the
curiculum of sports than it ever has
before. All five of the courts are oc
cupied until dark each afternoon.
Among the new players who are
showing up especially well are W.
Dawson, the Southern California Inter
scholastic champion, A. Cawston, a
former Harvard school star, F. M.
Douglas, the Occidental College crack,
and Murray, the Washington Inter
collegiate champion. Dawson, in par
ticular, is playing a brilliant game.
But recently, with Melville Long as a
partner, he won the State doubles
championship. Both Douglas and
Murray are transfers this year and
hence they will be unable to take part
in the Intercollegiate matches this
year. They should, however, give a
good account of themselves in the var
ious local tournaments.
Of the old guard, Morgan, Mann,
Murray and Shaul, last year's Inter
collegiate team, are still on deck and
putting up a better game than ever.
There is a possibility that Mann may
be unable to return next semester and

in that case a position 011 the Varsity
team is assured to some new man.
But in any event the veterans will
have to extend themselves to their ut
most in order to hold their laurels
against the newcomers.
The first tournament of the year is
the handicap tournament, which will
be played during the latter part of
next week. This tournament will con
sist of singles only and the handicaps
will be given, as nearly as possible,
according to the relative merits of the
players. Oftentimes in the past, es
pecially in the case of new players,
these handicaps are entirely too
large, but the committee from the
Tenuis Club are taking particular
pains this year to remedy this trouble.
The Wright and Ditson Company has
offered, through the Stanford Book
store, which handles all their tennis
goods 011 the campus, a first class ten
nis racquet to the winner of this
tournament. The racequet is now 011
exhibition at the bookstore.
The first meeting of the Tennis Club,
as is announced in another column of
this issue, will be held tomorrow af
ternoon. The purpose of the meeting
is to outline the plans for this year
and to make arrangements for the
coming tournament. This will be the
most important meeting of the semes
ter and all members are urged to at
tend.
