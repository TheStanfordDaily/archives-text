# TEAM ENTERS LEAGUE
## SOCCER PLAYERS WILL COMPETE IN CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES. Large Squad Turns Out For First Practice of the Coining Season on New Field. 
### 
With about seventy-five candidates
in the field, Stanford bids fair to enter
a championship team in the California
football league this year. The squad
appeared yesterday afternoon for their
initial practice with practically all the
members of last year's team in uni
form.
Although the loss of Captain H. L.
Hubbard and B. Erb, who have signed
up for Rugby, will be very keenly felt
during the early part of the season, the
schedule will be so arranged that the
more important league games will take
place at the conclusion of the Rugby
season. Hubbard and Erb were two of
the mainstays in the forward line last
year, and it is hoped that, the large
Freshman squad will develop a number
of stars to give Stanford even a strong
er aggregation than was put into the
field last year.
The excellent showing made by the
independent gymnasium team last sea
son goes to show that with a number
of veterans back, Stanford will un
doubtedly have a good chance to win
the championship cup this year. The
first game will be played on October 1
in San Francisco, but the schedule for
the coming season has not as yet been
given out.
The team to play in the first game
will not be picked until the day before
the match, and all aspirants will be
given a thorough tryout. The remain
der of the squad will be formed into
teams and will play a series of games
for the gymnasium championship.
Owing to the fact, that soccer is not
recognized as an intercollegiate sport
the team has accepted as its official
name, the Stanford Gymnasium Soc
cer Team. They will be coached by
Instructor H. W. Maloney, who has
had several years experience in the
game, and who lias been responsible in
the most part, for the introduction of
the English game as a sport at Stan
ford.
The old baseball field has been
graded, remodeled, and has been laid
off as a regulation soccer grounds. At
present it is one of the fastest soccer
fields around the bay, and will be used
for a number of important league
games this season. It is planned at
some future date to erect bleachers
and to inclose the grounds.
