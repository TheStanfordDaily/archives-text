# WOMEN STRIVE TO ADVANCE INTERESTS OF THEIR CLUB HOUSE
## 
### 
The Women's League hopes to add
a generous sum to the Clubhouse Fund
tomorrow afternoon by its production
of three original plays at Mrs. Bran
ner's, 1,3 Alvarado Row. The curtain
raiser, "Alice in Wonderland," will be
followed by "The State of Ego," by
Miss Helen Campbell, '11, and a .Jap
anese play, "Serf or Samurai," by Miss
Etliel Robinson, 'OS. The performance
will begin at 2:15 sharp.
One of the best plays written at
Stanford for several years is the Jap
anese playlet, "Serf or Samurai,"
which is one of three to be given by
the Woman's League. The play is in
blank verse, and was written by Miss
E. Robinson, 'OS. Mrs. J. E. Matzke is
assisting the girls in preparing the
play, and both the action and casting
are to be historically correct. Since
there will be no printed programs, the
cast of characters is given below:
Sakuma, a samurai, F. Williams, '11;
Tsuria, a serf, D. Parkinson, '12;
Judge, H. Park, '11; Uamiko, Hybashi's

| three plays to be given before the wo
j men students. Tt was written by Miss

sessed of a fixed idea. The play is
laid in an English garden.
