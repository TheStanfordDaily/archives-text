# CAMPUS IS STILL UNPROTECTED
## Special Committee Fails to Provide Site for the Isolation Hospital Favored by Board of Trustees. 
### 
Resolved, That it is the sense of this
Hoard that there he established for the
use of the University, an isolation hos
pital for contagious diseases, and that
the special committee he requested to
report on a suitable location.
This is the resolution passed upon
(he fourth Friday of last May by the
Board of Trustees. Three months after
committing themselves in this manner,
not a move has been made by the au
thorities to fulfill the explicit in
structions contained therein. The
special committee, of which C. G. Lath
rop is a member, apparently ignores
the necessity of action in the matter
Towards the end of last semester
the Student's Conference took up the
matter and secured a promise from the
Board of Trustees, through Dr. Jordan,
that the hospital would be immediately
built and that a site had practically
been selected. Probably, in accordance
with this statement, was the resolution,
printed above, passed. At this time
Treasurer Lathrop was visiting in the
east and was not upon the campus.
The City of Palo Alto by ordinance
forbids the carrying within its bound
aries of persons suffering from
measles, smallpox, diphtheria and
scarlet fever. These cases are also re
fused admittance to the Peninsula
Hospital as a matter of self protection.
Thus, shut off from outside aid, in a
time of epidcmic, the campus com
munity would have to provide for it
self. The dire need of a detention hos
pital made itself felt at the time of the

measles epidemic during the spring.
Fortunately that outbreak was mild
and most of the patients could be se
cluded in Encina Hall. However, if a
more virulent disease should break
forth on the campus this semester, the
students would even be without the
organization that aided so much last
spring, for the Guild now cannot
take charge of contagious cases, and
merely makes an allowance of two
dollars and fifty cents a day for the
care of the patient. As the situation
stands now, each physician would be
forced to care for his own patients and
the matter of quarantine would be
come of momentous importance.
The careful handling of the recent
eqidemic was due to the cooperation
of physicians and the student members
of the Guild, rather than to any official
action on the part of the University
authorities.
For months past, the Guild authori
ties have been endeavoring to safe
guard the lives of students from these
dangers, but all of their efforts have
been of no avail, and the opening of
the Fall semester finds the same con
ditions existing as have prevailed in
the pas't. Apparently giving up the
fight, the Guild issued a notice on
Registration day, disclaiming respon
sibility in cases of contagious diseases
until suitable arrangements could be
made for the erection of a detention
hospital. The withdrawal of the Guild
from this matter leaves the residents o
the campus and the students of Stan
ford in a serious dilemma.
