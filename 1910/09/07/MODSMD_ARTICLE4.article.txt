# NESTORIA FAVORS MORE DEBATES
## Desires Establishment of Intercollegiate Relations With Several Outside Institutions. 
### 
Nestoria Literary Society, at its first
meeting yesterday evening, formally
adopted resolutions favoring the es
tablishment of Intercollegiate debat
ing relations with several of the neigh
boring colleges and state universities,
by way of developing better teams to
meet the University of California in
the annual forensic contests. The so
ciety will bring the matter before the
Intersociety Debating Committee, and
through it, try to get the approval of
the Executive Committee for such an
important extension of debating activ
ity. The University of Oregon has
repeatedly challenged Stanford for
debates and it. is known that similar
contests are desired by other institu
tions. The last team to meet any
other team than the Blue and Gold
representatives was in the year 1906
when the University of Nevada de
bated against a Stanford trio.
The first meeting of the society, al
though entirely informal in character
was an enthusiastic one and well at
tended. President R. J. Miller, '11,
made his inaugural address as one
feature of the program, while F. H.
Hilton, '11, L. L. Hill, '11, and E. E.
Tincher. '12, all gave impromptu talks
on current questions. The socidty
will meet in regular session every
Tuesday evening in room 214 for the
remainder of the present semester.

The direct primary question will be
debated next week and an address will
be delivered by a member of the fac
ulty. Visitors are welcome.
