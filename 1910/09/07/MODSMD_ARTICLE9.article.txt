In another column of this edition
there is set forth a situation so serious
in its character that it becomes dan
gerous to the lives, not only to the
University students, but also to the
community at large. Under the exist
ing conditions there is every chance
that Roble Hall, Encina Hall, Madrono
or any boarding house upon the camp
us may become a large detention ward
There is absolutely 110 place at the
present time where any student who
is unfortunately stricken with a con
tagious disease can go and receive
proper treatment under hospital sur
veilence. He must perforce be quar
antined in his room, which at the best
is dangerous here upon the campus.
Those who must live ni the same com
munity are also imperilled, especially
if a case should occur in Encina or
Roble Halls. Every element is in
favor of a quick spread of the disease.
The students, through the Guild As
sociation, which has even offered to
erect the building If the site was ap
propriated, and the Faculty, through
the Faculty Committee on Public
Health, who have endeavored to use
their influence successively, have done
all within their power to secure this
needed institution. But on account of
the tardiness, the apparent indiffer
ence of this special committee there
is absolutely nothing that can be
accomplished by those who are wil
ling to actually do something toward
alleviating this condition. Nothing
that the Hoard of Trustees can ac
complish for the University is more
important than the preservation of the
health of its students. We hope that
the Board of Trustees can see some

method by which a site may be granted
in the near future so that the campus
will not be again put under the danger
of a serious epidemic. One lesson
should be enough.
