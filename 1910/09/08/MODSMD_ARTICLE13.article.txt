## Y.W.C.A. Loses Goods During Summer Months When Vandals Invade Strong Box. 
### 
Sometime during the summer vaca
tion, vandals broke into the box that
is used by the Y. W. C. A. to store their
Rest Room fixtures in, and stole the
cups, saucers and two alcohol stoves
that are used each year in connection
with the Rest Room. Nothing else
was in any way disturbed and the job
was so neatly done that no notice was
attracted to the box until last Monday,
when it was opened by the secretary of
the Y. W. C. A. and the theft discov
ered. As yet, the perpetrator of the
act has not been discovered, but that
it is the work of some one well ac
quainted with the Re3t Room is quite
evident.
