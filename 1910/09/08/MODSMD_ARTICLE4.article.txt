# OPENING ASSEMBLY IS INNOVATION
## Freshmen Are Made Acquainted With All Departments of Student Body Control---Plea Made for Union. 
### 
The Freshman of the University
were given this morning at the second
Assembly of the semester, their first
opportunity to get information re
garding the organization of the Stu
dent Body of which they are a vital
part, and hear of the exact method
under which the publications of the
college are conducted, and of the plans
of the long anticipated Stanford Union
which are about to materialize. The
speakers of the meeting were all men
who are officials connected with var
ious departments of the University,
and the Student Body
The Assembly was called promptly
at 11:30 o'clock by the President of the
Student Body, G. A. Ditz, who acted as
presiding officer. Previous to the
speaking, Assistant Yell Leader
Thompson appeared, and five minutes
of cheering was participated in.
President Ditz was the first speaker
of the meeting. He stopped to make a
few introductory remarks in regard
to the necessity of every new stuednt
knowing of the machinery under which
the organization of the Student Body
is run, and of the need of their interest
in these matters if the Student Body is
to he run without friction, or opposi
tion. Ditz then plunged into the sub
stance of his speech, which was a
brief outline of the organization of
Student Body government, and of the
policy the Executive Committee in
tends to follow during the ensuing
college year. The speaker made one
or two statements which were especi
ally pertinent at this time. He de
cared that if the Student Body ad
ministration does not create a more
accurate accounting system for the
Student Body officers during the en
suing year, he would believe it a fail
ure, and later he stated that his hope
of the year was that it be one of con
struction. In part he said as follows:
"Stanford University is as you men
and women wish to have it. Let us
begin a new clean year. There is
work before all of us, and let it be con
structive work. When you accept the
privilege of being a member of the
Student Body you take upon yourself a
certain amount of responsibility. Cor
respondence with other institutions of
this sort has proved to me that the
organization of our Student Body is as
good as any other. We expect this
year to do things as good as ever. A
band with thirty pieces is about to
be organized, and other improvements
are anticipated." President Deitz in
conclusion urged every member of the
Student Body to get behind the Rugby

squad, and exemplify our loyalty to the
team.
Dr. Angell was the next speaker, and
his subject dealt with the activities,
and duties of the Board of Control.
He briefly outlined the history of the
management of the athletic fields since
the opening of the University up to
the time when the Board of Control
was formed with the intention of mak
ing this body responsible for the finan
ces that were to be expended 011 the
athletic fields. Dr. Angell told of the
great expenses this board is often
confronted with, and explained to the
auditors that their only source of
revenue was through the Student Body
fees that should be paid each semester
by the registering student.
Student Adviser A. E. Roth, was the
third speaker of the meeting. Roth
was scheduled to speak upon the func
tions of his oflice, and upon the en
deavors and hopes of the University
Conference. He confessed that the
duties of his position were hard to de
fine, but that he wanted it understood
that there were 110 fees attached to his
favors, and that he hoped every under
classman would come to him previous
to finding trouble, and not always
I wait until he got it."I may be able to
I help you," declared the Student Ad-
I viser. The speaker devoted some
time to the University Conference. He
spoke of its make-up, and of the prob
believes that if it is going to be main
tained, and be made to succeed, every
Stanford man and women has to be
behind it.
H. G. Ferguson, Editor of the Daily
Palo Alto, and Chairman of the Stu
dent Conmiittee that is collecting funds
for the Stanford Union, completed the
program of the Assembly by giving a
pertinent, decisive, declaration on the
present activities of his committee, and
also upon the policies of the college
publications, and their management.
Ferguson after explaining the method
under which the publications are pro
mulgated, commented very emphati
cally upon the future prospects of the
Stanford Union, and what would facil
itate all matters so that the erection
, of the building could be commenced
within a comparatively short time. He
j stated he believed that the factulty had
done their full share, and the upper
classmen of the University had made
an excellent showing, but it was now
up to the underclassmen to take up the
, caused in an ardent manner.
"It will be your home," said Fergu
son, referring to the men. "You are
J the ones that will live in it."

squad, and exemplify our loyalty to the
team.
Dr. Angell was the next speaker, and
his subject dealt with the activities,
and duties of the Board of Control.
He briefly outlined the history of the
management of the athletic fields since
the opening of the University up to
the time when the Board of Control
was formed with the intention of mak
ing this body responsible for the finan
ces that were to be expended 011 the
athletic fields. Dr. Angell told of the
great expenses this board is often
confronted with, and explained to the
auditors that their only source of
revenue was through the Student Body
fees that should be paid each semester
by the registering student.
Student Adviser A. E. Roth, was the
third speaker of the meeting. Roth
was scheduled to speak upon the func
tions of his oflice, and upon the en
deavors and hopes of the University
Conference. He confessed that the
duties of his position were hard to de
fine, but that he wanted it understood
that there were 110 fees attached to his
favors, and that he hoped every under
classman would come to him previous
to finding trouble, and not always
I wait until he got it."I may be able to
I help you," declared the Student Ad-
I viser. The speaker devoted some
time to the University Conference. He
spoke of its make-up, and of the prob
believes that if it is going to be main
tained, and be made to succeed, every
Stanford man and women has to be
behind it.
H. G. Ferguson, Editor of the Daily
Palo Alto, and Chairman of the Stu
dent Conmiittee that is collecting funds
for the Stanford Union, completed the
program of the Assembly by giving a
pertinent, decisive, declaration on the
present activities of his committee, and
also upon the policies of the college
publications, and their management.
Ferguson after explaining the method
under which the publications are pro
mulgated, commented very emphati
cally upon the future prospects of the
Stanford Union, and what would facil
itate all matters so that the erection
, of the building could be commenced
within a comparatively short time. He
j stated he believed that the factulty had
done their full share, and the upper
classmen of the University had made
an excellent showing, but it was now
up to the underclassmen to take up the
, caused in an ardent manner.
"It will be your home," said Fergu
son, referring to the men. "You are
J the ones that will live in it."
The Freshman of the University
were given this morning at the second
Assembly of the semester, their first
opportunity to get information re
garding the organization of the Stu
dent Body of which they are a vital
part, and hear of the exact method
under which the publications of the
college are conducted, and of the plans
of the long anticipated Stanford Union
which are about to materialize. The
speakers of the meeting were all men
who are officials connected with var
ious departments of the University,
and the Student Body
The Assembly was called promptly
at 11:30 o'clock by the President of the
Student Body, G. A. Ditz, who acted as
presiding officer. Previous to the
speaking, Assistant Yell Leader
Thompson appeared, and five minutes
of cheering was participated in.
President Ditz was the first speaker
of the meeting. He stopped to make a
few introductory remarks in regard
to the necessity of every new stuednt
knowing of the machinery under which
the organization of the Student Body
is run, and of the need of their interest
in these matters if the Student Body is
to he run without friction, or opposi
tion. Ditz then plunged into the sub
stance of his speech, which was a
brief outline of the organization of
Student Body government, and of the
policy the Executive Committee in
tends to follow during the ensuing
college year. The speaker made one
or two statements which were especi
ally pertinent at this time. He de
cared that if the Student Body ad
ministration does not create a more
accurate accounting system for the
Student Body officers during the en
suing year, he would believe it a fail
ure, and later he stated that his hope
of the year was that it be one of con
struction. In part he said as follows:
"Stanford University is as you men
and women wish to have it. Let us
begin a new clean year. There is
work before all of us, and let it be con
structive work. When you accept the
privilege of being a member of the
Student Body you take upon yourself a
certain amount of responsibility. Cor
respondence with other institutions of
this sort has proved to me that the
organization of our Student Body is as
good as any other. We expect this
year to do things as good as ever. A
band with thirty pieces is about to
be organized, and other improvements
are anticipated." President Deitz in
conclusion urged every member of the
Student Body to get behind the Rugby

squad, and exemplify our loyalty to the
team.
