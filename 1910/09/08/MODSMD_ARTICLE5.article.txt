# HOLD FIRST LINE-UPS.
## Football Men Take Part in Short Games.â€”Freshman Players Show knowledge of Game. 
### 
Last evening saw the Rugby men
lined up for the first time this season.
The short games showed that the old
men have not lost their knack and vim
in playing, while the Freshmen exhib
ited a wonderful adaptability to the

sport. The 1914 baokfield men handled
themselves well and showed a remark
able knowledge of the game, consider
ing that but one practice had been
held. Several experienced Rugby play
ers are among the first-year candi
dates.
A welcome addition to the Varsity
squad will be made by the registra
tion of L. R. Minturn. This player,
with his great experience, will mater
ially strengthen the scrum.
