Football will claim the attention of
the University tomorrow, when the
1914 team will face Lowell High school
for the first game of the season. The
contest is scheduled to begin at 2:30,
on the Varsity field. This will be the
first opportunity to get something of a
line on the playing ability of the
Freshmen. The team which will line
up against Lowell at the kick-off, is
given below, but this placing of the
men is only temporary and changes
will occur constantly. With but a
week spent in teaching the candidates
the rudiments of the game, it is prac
tically impossible for Coach Presley
to select any fifteen men from the
Freshmen squad, as being the best
players. Every Freshman will be
given a chance to play tomorrow after
noon. The men who will first enter
the game are as follows:
C. L. Brown and J. E. Franchesci,
front rank; C. W. Knight and R. R.
Blase, side rank; C. E. Olmstead, lock;
G. H. Mitchell and C. Boulware, rear
rank; W. P. Darsie, wing forward;
P. Harrigan, half; Geissler and A. M
Standish, fives; Stafford, center; .i. li.
Weber and S. Green, wings; K. Kauf
man, full.
The Lowell men have been under
the instruction of Webster, a former
University of California player, and
are said to have acquired consider
able cleverness in the sport. After the
Freshman-Lowell game, the 1911 men
will hook up with the second Fresh
men fifteen. An admission of 25 cents
will be charged. Former editor-in
chief of the Daily Palo, W. P. Fuller,
will referee.
On Monday, all the men who took
the Australian trip will be required to
appear on the field and begin training.
The appearance of these veterans,will
swell the list of candidates for the
Varsity team to almost 200 names.
Tackling was introduced into the
practice last evening. The backs de
voted their time to learning the trick
of dodging, runing with the ball, and
tackling runners. The forwards
worked with the tackling bag for some
time and practiced formation of
scrums.
