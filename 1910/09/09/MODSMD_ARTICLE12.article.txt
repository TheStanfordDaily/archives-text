There will be absolutely no excuse
for any complaint upon the part of the
Student Body as to the choice that the
Executive Committee will make with
regard to the men who will fill the
positions of yell leaders this year. An
opportunity has been given the Stu
dent Body by their committee to voice
their sentiments as to the ability of
the men who are trying out. Tomor
row afternoon eight or ten men
will appear as candidates for the po
sitions of yell leaders. If the majority
of the Associated Students are upon
the bleachers, there will be evjiy op
portunity to obtain at first hand an
estimate of the men who are contest
ing, while at that time every student
will also be given a chance to signify
his approval or his disapproval of the
men who are striving for these posi
tions. Thus it behooves every man who
is interested in the selection of the
yell leaders to appear tomorrow and
give his honest opinions.
