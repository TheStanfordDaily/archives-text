## ROOTERS WILL CAST STRAW VOTE FOR YELL LEADERS. Tryouts Will Start Tomorrow at Rugby Game.â€”Many Candidates Will Appear. 
### 
A system very democratic in many
respects will be tried tomorrow at the
first Rugby game of the season, by the
Executive Committee in their endeavor
to ascertain to the satisfaction of the
Student Body what men will make the
most capable Yell Leaders. The
Executive Committee, believing that
men elected to these positions should
be men not only efficient in quoting the
yells, and leading the rooters, but
should also be individuals that the ma
jority of students believe competent,
has decided upon giving each member
of the rooting section on every day of
tryouts an opportunity to express
their convictions on the candidates
by the medium of a straw vote. In
this manner, the Executive Committee
will be able to obtain the expression of
the rooters, and consequently be able
to make a more popular choice.
The system seems to have met with
much approval by the upperclassmen,
who have been given a hearing on the
subject, and it is hoped that it will
create more interest in the choosing of
the Yell Leaders.
Candidates for these positions are
requested to report tomorrow after
noon at 1 o'clock, at room 58 Encina,
where Assistant Yell Leader Thomp
son will instruct them how to lead the
songs and the yells. The aspirants
will then appear at the game tomor
row, when the Freshman squad and
Lowell High School and make their
debut.
According to Thompson, a large
number have announced their inten
tion of trying out, and if the number
exceeds eight or ten, a system of
elimination may be placed in vogue,
and after a few practices, only the
most favorable candidates will be not
ified to appear.
The tryouts this fall will be much
longer than those of previous years,
probably continuing three or four
weeks before a decision will be
reached by the Executive Committee
on who shall be appointed.
