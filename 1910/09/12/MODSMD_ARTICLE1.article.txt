# FRESHMEN TAKE FIRST VICTORY
## Cardinal Novices Start Schedule with Victory, Showing Superiority Over Lowell High School, II.O. 
### 
The turf season on the Cardinal
campus began Saturday witli a stimu
lating 11-0 victory for the Freshmen
over the blue shirted rugby fighters
from Lowell High School. The game
was in reality two distinct battles,
each a twenty minute half. The first
skirmish recorded all the scoring and
nearly all the rugby experience as
well, as far as the Freshman were con
cerned. The first fifteen men and
substitute that Coach Presley put on
the field were a unit and showed that
they knew the points of the game.
They unlimbered none of the awkard
ness of an opening game. The changed
line-up, however, who took charge of
the second period, were woefully lack
ing in knowledge of English football.
It was only their past memories of the
American game that saved them dur
ing the last twenty minutes. But they
were full of fight and kept the Lowell
score-board blank by their bull-dog
power to find and follow the pigskin.
It isâ€¢ noteworthy that In their scant
four days practice of rugby that these
men, new at the game, could get into
their positions with any sort of ac
curacy. Another week of work will
give their more fortunate teammates,
who have had hard rugby knocks be
fore, a hard go for the first places on
the line-up in coming games.
In a way similar to last year, Coach
Presley tried out on Saturday the 2-3-2
formation of the scrum, tactics which
make possible a wing forward, and
which give the halfback more time
and opportunity to take care of the
ball when it leaves the feet of the for
wards at a mile-a-minute clip. Wheth
er the "3-2-3" of last year is on the
shelf for the season remains to be
seen. Stanford teams adopted it about
October first, in 1909 after three
weeks practice on the old formation,
and used it during the rest of the sea
son. California, however, handed it
over to the Varsity only in 1909. The
Blue and Gold Freshmen held to the
old formation and used their wing
forward to much advantage as a free
lance, with the Cardinal half back as
a special point of attack. The seven
scrum men and wing forward style
seems more adapted to novices in
rugby and probably for this reason it
is being used now.
The men who did the scoring Satur
day were of necessity those who had

already passed through the primary
school of rugby. The forwards with
one or two exceptions were to be de
pended upon. Darsie as a wing for
ward gave promise. Geissler, Stand
ish, Stafford and Weber were all in
fine fettle as backs. These men were
all in the opening line-up. Among the
men who did unusual work in the per
iod after half-time was Reeves, a wing.
He carried through several daring
runs.
Tries were made by Weber, who was
on the end of a rush engineered by
Geissler and Standish. Weber put
down the pigskin to make the total 6-0,
on a direct pass from Tilton, at
half, when Weber was holding the fort
alone on his own touch line. Neither
of these tries were converted by Geis
sler, both kicks falling short. Darsie
for the third try picked up a few feet
from the Lowell line and dragged
himself over. Geissler topped the
posts in this third attempt and rounded
up the score, 11-0. The first period
never saw the ball in Freshman terri
tory with the exception of the first
few plays after the whistle. The battle
field was reversed in the final twenty
minutes. Lowell was within striking
distance during the second period.
A twenty-five minute set-to held the
three or four hundred spectators on
the bleachers at the end of the Fresh
man game. The Senior grays gave
the remainder of the Freshman squad
a short initiation into rugby, winning,
16-0.
