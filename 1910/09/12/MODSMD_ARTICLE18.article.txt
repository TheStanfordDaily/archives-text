# MATINEE IS PRAISED
## MRS. RUSSELL COMPLIMENTS WOMEN'S LEAGUE PRODUCTION. Three Playlets Gives Saturday Afternoon for Women's Clubhouse Benefit Net Over $100. 
### 
The dramatic season at Stanford has
opened. The opening took the aus
picious form of a Midsummer Day
dream, a Saturday matinee, held in a
certain secluded garden, on a blossom
decked stage, and accompanied by a
tree canopied orchestra. It seemed a
particularly happy coincidence that
the performance should be as idyllic in
scene as in setting, that the three
playlets presented should all deal with
the romantic, be seasoned with a sun
shiny humor, and spiced with a bit of
the bizarre. For the first scene visual
ized for us our old friends of "Alice
in Wonderland;" the second treated in
a sweetly satrical spirit with the oc
cult; and the third transported us to
the land of the cherry blossom and told
in blank verse a tale of serf and
Samurai.
Honorable mention should be given
to each and every one who contributed
to the happy total, but since space for
bids, it can go only to the chief con
tributors: to Miss Horton, for the
dramatization of "Alice," and for play
ing title role in that as well as leading
lady in the Nippon drama: to Miss
Driscoll, who designed the marvellous
costumes of the dozen denizens of
Wonderland; to Miss Buckingham, who
portrayed most effectively the intense
but winsome Constance Latham, in a
"State of Ego;" to Miss Moise, for a
deliciously done bit of Scotch dialect
in the same play; to Mrs. Matzke, for
bringing "Serf and Samurai," written
by Miss Ethel Robinson, '08, to a state
of dramatic perfection; and to Miss
Campbell, author of "The State of
Ego" and manager of the entire affair.
It was all carried off with such glee
and grace and apparent ease that the
sum of one hundred dollars plus netted
thereby for the Womens' Club House <
seemed merely a matter of adding
profit to pleasure.
