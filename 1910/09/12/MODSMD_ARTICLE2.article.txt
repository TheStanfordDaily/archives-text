# Chicago Will Play Baseball in Japan.
## 
### 
The University of Chicago has sent
its baseball team to Japan for a twenty
game schedule in the land of the Ris
ing Sun. Amada University is one of
the institutions that will attempt to
wrest diamond honors from the West
ern players. Before sailing across the
Pacific the Chicago nine met several of
the North Coast college teams in a late
summer series, and succeeded in hold
ing their own with the Coast ball
artists.
The Chicago nine expects to be
absent in the Orient for some months
and will visit the Philippine Islands
and China before they return to Amer
ica.
