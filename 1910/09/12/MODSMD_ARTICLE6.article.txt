### 
Professor B. E. Howard, of the Econ
omics department, delivered a lecture
entitled "The Call of Today" before the
Commonwealth Club of San Francisco
last Saturday, at the Palace Hotek
In the course of his remarks he said:
"In considering the 'Call of Today' let
me say that it is becoming increasing
ly difficult in every walk of life to be
honest. Life as we find it now, is a
succession of moral crises,for the devil
of graft is omnipresent and ever
tempting. A man in modern life may
want to be fair, but if he is so, he will
have to submit to unfair competition
with others who are thieves and liars.
The biggest thing in God's world is a
clean, honest man, whether he be
found in purple and seated on a throne
or whether he walks barefoot through
the streets."
