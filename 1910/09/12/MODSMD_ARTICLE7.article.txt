# Dates Being Filled.
## 
### 
Fraternities, sororities and clubs
have begun filling in the dates for

dances and other social functions that
are kept upon a list at the Registrar's
office. If all the organizations on the
campus contemplating the giving of
any kind of festivities, would conslt
the list before issuing invitations, the
chance of duplicating dates would he
obviated. The list may be consulted
by any one.
