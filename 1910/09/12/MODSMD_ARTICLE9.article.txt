# SIX CANDIDATES APPEAR.
## Men Desiring to Lead Yells Tryout Before Rooters at Initial Rugby Game. 
### 
Before the rooters on Saturday six
prominent upperclassmen appeared
under the direction of Assistant Yell
Leader Thompson as candidates for
the positions of Head Yell Leader, and
the two assistants. The men who tried
out were H. Sepulveda, '12, S. Ken
nedy, '12, J. B. Beman, '12, L. Mann,
'11, L. Ward, '12, and J. E. Thompson,
11. Thompson, who for the past year
has been Assistant Yell Leader, had
charge of the try-out and conducted it
during the game.
Because of the inexperience of the
candidates no straw vote was taken
from the rooters on Saturday, but at the
next try-out, which will take place on
Wednesday when the Freshmen play
Santa Clara High School, a vote will
he asked from the men on the bleach
ers.
