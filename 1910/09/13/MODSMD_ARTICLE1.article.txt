### 
Details of the discovery of an old
and extinct tribe of Indians by J. R.
Pemberton, Instructor in the Depart
ment of Geology and Mining at To
pango Canyon this summer, have be
come known. Pemberton and the
party of Stanford students who ac
companied him found the mound, as
the remains of the ancient villages
of the aborigines are called, at the
mouth of a canyon about three miles
from Santa Monica and at once com
menced excavations.
Skeletons of 34 individuals were
found. They had evidently all been
killed in a fight , as the skull of each
had been crushed in. Pemberton has
retained one sknll with a flint arrow
head still embedded in it. The In
dians had been dead at least 200 years.
These aborigines were almost
dwarfs in size, few of the skeletons be
ing over four feet, in height, and the
skulls were of a most peculiar forma
tion. Their foreheads in no case were
over three quarters of an inch high,
while the forehead sloped almost
straight back from the eyebrows. A
remarkable heavy, prominent jaw, and
protruding lobes at he back of the
head were the remaining features that
made the physiognomy of the tribe
most unusual.
This tribe is thought to have been
of Asiatic origin, coming by way of
the Behring Islands about 5,000 years
ago. They were very low in the scale
of civilization, their implements being
extremely cruder while their susten
ance consisted principally of fish and
clams.
