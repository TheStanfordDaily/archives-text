# WILL AUGMENT CONFERENCE.
## Students Will Select New Representatives to University Conference. Eligible Electors Posted Tomorrow. 
### 
Although the regular election for
new members of the University Con
ference was scheduled for tomorrow
afternoon, delay in the compiling of
eligible electors in the Registrar's of
fice, has necessitated a postponment
until Friday at 1:10. At that time, the
electors will meet in the various
rooms to be designated later, and
choose their representatives. The
eligible lists will be posted on the de
partmental bulletin boards tomorrow.
Student Advisor A. E. Roth will meet
with the present members of the Con
ference this evening at 7:30 o'clock in
room 12, to check over the lists. Roth
requests that as many as possible as
sist in this work, as the selection and
distribution into departments of all
those having fifty or more hours will
be a large task.
The election Friday afternoon will
be an important one for the Confer
ence, as fully two-thirds of the mem
bership did not return to college this
fall. Those elected will serve for
two years, and there are but few de
partments which do not have some
vacancies to be filled.
