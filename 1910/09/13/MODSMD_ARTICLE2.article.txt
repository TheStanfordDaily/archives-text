# 1914 CONTESTS WITH SENIORS
## Older Men Defeated, 6-3.— Nine Trans-Pacific Veterans Do Mild Rugby Work.— S. Mitchell to Return. 
### 
The two lower classes developed a
high level of rugby yesterday after
noon and swamped the upperclass
teams in four short halves, the two
contests making all the practice given
the men by Coach Presley. The Fresh
men put the Seniors to rout to the
tune of 8-3, and the Sophomores out
played the Juniors in two twenty
minute halves, marking up one try.
The first year men had 1911 at bay
during the whole of the opening per
iod of play. Geissler, Hall, Reeves
and Weber went over the ground in
amazing fashion and Reeves crossed
the line with ease. A series of rushes
brought the score and revealed the
superiority of the Freshmen backs in
passi.ng. For so short a time since
the opening of the season the younger
players were unusually far advanced
in this department of the game. The
forwards had the ball in charge for
the second score, and Darsie stole
over for the try. The 1914 scrum
workers are rapidly learning to get
behind the oval and follow up. It was
only when the Freshman line-up was
changed all out of shape that the 1911
team, by hard pushing, were able to
make their only tally.
The entire Sophomore fifteen played
far ahead of early season reckoning
and surprised the Juniors into defeat
by a single try. The backs succeeded
in locating the leather very near the
1912 danger line, and from there an
exhibition of American football, in
cluding hard pushing, gave the game
to 1913.
The nine trans-Pacific players ap
peared yesterday after a week's rest,
and went through some very mild

Rugby manoevers. Besides Captain
K. L. Dole and B. E. Erb, '12, who have
been on the side lines the past week
assisting in coaching, there were on
the field yesterday Minturn, Fitting,
Cheda and Horton of the old guard
pack, all of whom will be eligible this
year and will do much to put at rest
any fears that may arise in regard to
the scrum section of the 1910 Cardinal
Varsity fifteen. Brown, Sanborn and
Kern were the backs who were on
hand, and they all showed excellent
condition. Roth is the only other
member of the Stanford half of the
Ail-American team who will not be
able to do turf duty this year. These
veterans will get into their paces
probably very gradually, but will be
ready for the first varsity match with
the Olympic Club next Saturday.
"Stan" Mitchell, last fall's meteoric
five-eights and Freshman captain, has
just set foot on American soil from
Europe. He will arrive in Los Ange
les on the 18th, and, after a two-days
stay there, will take the rugby firing
line on the campus about September
20th. Cass, the 1909 Varsity half-back
is in togs and will be ready to do his
part as a one-year veteran. It is rum
ored that California has twenty-three
former Varsity men from whom to
pick a fifteen. Twelve of the twent>
three were members of the Australian
tour team. Stanford, besides having
an unusual number of good class team
players, can depend upon several
players of experience from other col
leges. The Smiths from the Univer
sity of the Pacific will strengthen the
backfield and forward line materially.
A. M. Donovan, '12, a Santa Clara and
Olympic Club back, who has been in- I
eligible in his first two years of col- |
lege work, can be looked upon as for- j
midable for the present season. As a
wing he is fast. Williams of U. S. C. I
is another back who may prove of
Cardinal Varsity caliber.
The Varsity football schedule will
be printed in the near future. I'nna- i
ger Burbank has delayed its publica
tion because of some trouble in regard
to the date set for the Varsity-Van
couver struggle upon the campus.
The matter may.be settled quickely,
and in that case the list of dates will
bo complete.
At 4:45 tomorrow on the turf field |
the Freshman fifteen will line up j
against the rugby aggregation from
the Mission town. Little advance in- j
formation can be obtained, but the |
Santa Clara College team will un
doubtedly prove formidable opponents
tomorrow, as they have in the past.
Strict training rules went into ef
fect last night for all Freshmen upon
the squad. Every first year man
must observe faithfully the rules in
augurated or jeopardize his position ■
as one of the rugby aspirants.
The game will be divided into j
halves of twenty and twenty-five j
minutes duration. Student Advisor, ,
A. E. Roth, '09, will officiate as referee, j
In tomorrow's game, as in the one of
last Saturday with Lowell High, as
many of the Freshmen will be given a
chance to show their mettle as is
possible. At the first kick-off the
Freshmen will line up as follows:
Dimon, Bryan, Knight, Olmstead,
Blase, Mitchell, Boulware, forwards;
Darsie, wing-forward; Tilton, half;
Geissler, Hall, fives; Green or Glass,
center; Weber, Reeves, wings; Wat
kins, full.
