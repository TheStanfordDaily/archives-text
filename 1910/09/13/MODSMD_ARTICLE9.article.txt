# SECURES RARE COLLECTION.
## Library Wets Valuable Set of Source Books on the French Revolution. 
### 
Through the efforts of Professor E.
B. Krehbiel, of the History depart
ment, the University Library has been
able to purchase a valuable collec
tion of books relating to the French
Revolutionary period. The collection
was the work of a San Francisco
lawyer by the name of John R. Jarboe,
who died in 1893. The collection, since
that time, has been stored away in an
old bookcase in a house in Santa
Cruz, where its presence was nearly
forgotten. Occasional rumors about*
the existence of these valuable books
had been in circulation, but no at
tention had been paid to them. Pro
fessor Krehbiel hearing this rumor,
went to Santa Cruz to investigate the
matter.
He discovered a rare collection of
books relating to the Frencn Revolu
tion, particularly those covering the
first three years of the Reign of Ter
ror and connected with the ill-fated
Marie Antoinette. The collection is
particularly rich in source material,
including contemporary pamphlets,
memoirs and many valuable and un
usual prints and plates. Professor
Krehbiel returned enthusiastic and,
appearing before the Trustees of the
University he persuaded them to send
a committee to investigate the collec
tion, which resulted in the purchase
of the books.
The collection is now in the Library,
where it is being catalogued. This
new acquisition will be known as the
"Jarboe Collection" and each book
will have a special bookplate identify
ing it as such.
