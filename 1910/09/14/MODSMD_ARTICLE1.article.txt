# SUCCESSFUL YEAR IS PREDICTED
## Lagunita Boat Club Making Extreme Preparations for Fall Crew Training.â€” Huston to Return After Christmas. 
### 
The prospects for another victori
ous crew this year are exceptionally
bright. Nine old Varsity men, besides
one who rowed on the crew at Wash
ington last spring have already regis
tered. J. C. Huston, 10, captain of
last year's winning crew, recently
announced his intention to return to
college after Christmas. In that event,
the number of veterans will be in
creased to ten. Besides being an ex
ceptionally fine oarsman himself, Hus
ton will be able to render invaluable
service in teaching the new men the
fine points of the sport.
The list of veterans now in the Uni
versity includes; C. L. Schaupp, '12,
captain-elect for 1911, J. W. Fitting,
'10, K. L. Dole, '11, K. C. Chamber
lain, '11, J. C. Partridge, '12, R. H.
Seward, '12, It. R. Hails, '12, R. R.
Gilmore, '12, and L. Hofer, '13. It. F.
Duryea, '13, although not a member of
the intercollegiate eight, may almost,
be considered a veteran, as he rowed
with the crew at Washington. Be
sides these men all of last year's
Freshmen four are in college and will
no doubt give some of the older men
a hard fight for positions in the eight.
The members of the 1913 four besides
Duryea, were, C. H. Beal, It. Olmstead,
and J. S. Grepse. At the present
time there are four experienced cox
swains in the University. J. W. Rob
erts, '10, and F. L. Guerena, '11, are
both Varsity coxswains, while J. W.
Howell, '12, and L. H. Marks, '13, pilot
ed their respective Freshmen crews to
victory over California.
Although boating was discontinued
last year as an intercollegiate sport,
there were many men who wished to
see the annual regatta remain on the
calender of intercollegiate sports.
These men were mostly crew men, but
in a short time they enlisted the sup
port of many others and reorganized
the Lagunita Boat Club. This club
had complete charge of the boating
last year and successfully carried on
the crew work, which finally at the
end of the year was marked with an
other victory over the University of
California. This year, the same or
ganization will again have charge and.
as was the case last year, threre will
be no professional coach, but in place
of such adjunct, the older men will
instruct the Freshmen.
Tn regard to equipment, the club is
now in communication with Ellis
Ward, the University of Pennsylvania
rowing coach and shell-maker, for the
purchase of oars, riggers and other
material. Ward has a reputation
for making the finest rowing para
phernalia in the country and, if satis
factory terms can be agreed upon,
the present needs will be greatly al
leviated by the additional equipment.
A pair-oared barge may possibly be
procured from one of the San Fran-

Cisco rowing clubs. The San Fran
cisco clubs, particularly the South
End Club, have always taken a great
interest in the rowing conditions here
at Stanford and it is to them that the
Lagunita Club is indebted for much of
their present equipment. No new
eight-oared shell will be necessary
this year, as the Columbia racing
eight, which was purchased two years
ago, has been overhauled and put into
first class condition by an Oakland
boat building company. It is now
stored in the "Amador," the Univer
sity of California boat house, and will
not be brought to the local clubhouse
until sometime near the end of this
semester.
At best, the Stanford crews are han
dicapped in the way of a place to
train, but when Lake Lagunita is not
tilled until the second semester, the
fall training is greatly impaired. This
year, the club is trying to make the
necessary arrangements with the
Trustees of the University by which
Lake Lagunita can be filled this se
mester. This will do away with the
fall trips to Redwood, which consume
so much time and must be taken at a
considerable expense.
The local club is, at present, await
ing the perfection of rowing plans at
the University of California before it
concludes any agreement or sets the
date for the annual regatta. One
thing has been definitely decided upon,
however, and that is that there will
be a Freshman eight instead of a four
oared race similar to that of last year.
The course of last year's race was the
best that has ever been selected for an
intercollegiate race and it will prob
ably be chosen again this year. This
course is on the Oakland estuary and
extends for a mile and half above and
below the University of California
boat house. Although rough at times,
the water in this estuary is ordinarily
much more calm and free from short,
choppy waves than other courses that
have been selected for intercollegiate
races in and around San Francisco Bay.
On account of the large number of
Freshmen who are out for rugby and
who will probably sign up for crew,
the fall training will not start until
after the Freshman inter-collegiate
game in October. The week after the
game, there will be a call for candi
dates. The fall work will consist of
cross-country running, dumb bell ex
ercises and rowing machine work for
the Freshmen. From the large num
ber of Freshmen who have already
signified their intention of joining the
club there should be little trouble in
developing a formidable eight.
Instead of rowing machine practice,
the old men will train in fours on the
lake, if the lake is filled this semester.
Otherwise, they will do light rowing
at Redwood in eights.
The prospects for another victori
ous crew this year are exceptionally

as was the case last year, threre will
be no professional coach, but in place
of such adjunct, the older men will
instruct the Freshmen.
Tn regard to equipment, the club is
now in communication with Ellis
Ward, the University of Pennsylvania
rowing coach and shell-maker, for the
purchase of oars, riggers and other
material. Ward has a reputation
for making the finest rowing para
phernalia in the country and, if satis
factory terms can be agreed upon,
the present needs will be greatly al
leviated by the additional equipment.
A pair-oared barge may possibly be
procured from one of the San Fran-

Cisco rowing clubs. The San Fran
cisco clubs, particularly the South
End Club, have always taken a great
interest in the rowing conditions here
at Stanford and it is to them that the
Lagunita Club is indebted for much of
their present equipment. No new
eight-oared shell will be necessary
this year, as the Columbia racing
eight, which was purchased two years
ago, has been overhauled and put into
first class condition by an Oakland
boat building company. It is now
stored in the "Amador," the Univer
sity of California boat house, and will
not be brought to the local clubhouse
until sometime near the end of this
semester.
At best, the Stanford crews are han
dicapped in the way of a place to
train, but when Lake Lagunita is not
tilled until the second semester, the
fall training is greatly impaired. This
year, the club is trying to make the
necessary arrangements with the
Trustees of the University by which
Lake Lagunita can be filled this se
mester. This will do away with the
fall trips to Redwood, which consume
so much time and must be taken at a
considerable expense.
The local club is, at present, await
ing the perfection of rowing plans at
the University of California before it
concludes any agreement or sets the
date for the annual regatta. One
thing has been definitely decided upon,
however, and that is that there will
be a Freshman eight instead of a four
oared race similar to that of last year.
The course of last year's race was the
best that has ever been selected for an
intercollegiate race and it will prob
ably be chosen again this year. This
course is on the Oakland estuary and
extends for a mile and half above and
below the University of California
boat house. Although rough at times,
the water in this estuary is ordinarily
much more calm and free from short,
choppy waves than other courses that
have been selected for intercollegiate
races in and around San Francisco Bay.
On account of the large number of
Freshmen who are out for rugby and
who will probably sign up for crew,
the fall training will not start until
after the Freshman inter-collegiate
game in October. The week after the
game, there will be a call for candi
dates. The fall work will consist of
cross-country running, dumb bell ex
ercises and rowing machine work for
the Freshmen. From the large num
ber of Freshmen who have already
signified their intention of joining the
club there should be little trouble in
developing a formidable eight.
Instead of rowing machine practice,
the old men will train in fours on the
lake, if the lake is filled this semester.
Otherwise, they will do light rowing
at Redwood in eights.
The prospects for another victori
ous crew this year are exceptionally
bright. Nine old Varsity men, besides
one who rowed on the crew at Wash
ington last spring have already regis
tered. J. C. Huston, 10, captain of
last year's winning crew, recently
announced his intention to return to
college after Christmas. In that event,
the number of veterans will be in
creased to ten. Besides being an ex
ceptionally fine oarsman himself, Hus
ton will be able to render invaluable
service in teaching the new men the
fine points of the sport.
The list of veterans now in the Uni
versity includes; C. L. Schaupp, '12,
captain-elect for 1911, J. W. Fitting,
'10, K. L. Dole, '11, K. C. Chamber
lain, '11, J. C. Partridge, '12, R. H.
Seward, '12, It. R. Hails, '12, R. R.
Gilmore, '12, and L. Hofer, '13. It. F.
Duryea, '13, although not a member of
the intercollegiate eight, may almost,
be considered a veteran, as he rowed
with the crew at Washington. Be
sides these men all of last year's
Freshmen four are in college and will
no doubt give some of the older men
a hard fight for positions in the eight.
The members of the 1913 four besides
Duryea, were, C. H. Beal, It. Olmstead,
and J. S. Grepse. At the present
time there are four experienced cox
swains in the University. J. W. Rob
erts, '10, and F. L. Guerena, '11, are
both Varsity coxswains, while J. W.
Howell, '12, and L. H. Marks, '13, pilot
ed their respective Freshmen crews to
victory over California.
Although boating was discontinued
last year as an intercollegiate sport,
there were many men who wished to
see the annual regatta remain on the
calender of intercollegiate sports.
These men were mostly crew men, but
in a short time they enlisted the sup
port of many others and reorganized
the Lagunita Boat Club. This club
had complete charge of the boating
last year and successfully carried on
the crew work, which finally at the
end of the year was marked with an
other victory over the University of
California. This year, the same or

who will probably sign up for crew,
the fall training will not start until
after the Freshman inter-collegiate
game in October. The week after the
game, there will be a call for candi
dates. The fall work will consist of
cross-country running, dumb bell ex
ercises and rowing machine work for
the Freshmen. From the large num
ber of Freshmen who have already
signified their intention of joining the
club there should be little trouble in
developing a formidable eight.
Instead of rowing machine practice,
the old men will train in fours on the
lake, if the lake is filled this semester.
Otherwise, they will do light rowing
at Redwood in eights.
