# ADOPT PLUG UGLY RULES.
## Senior Class Agrees to Conference Plans.â€”Dole Presides Over Poorly Attended Meeting. 
### 
Although poorly attended, several
matters of importance were con
sidered and disposed of by the Senior
Class today at the first meeting pres
ided over by its newly elected Presi
dent, K. L. Dole. Among oilur things,
the rules and regulations of the next
Plug Ugly as drawn up by the Uni
versity Conference were adopted, and
a cordial invitation extended to all
"holdovers" and graduate students to
affiliate with the class.
As the class treasury is known to
be low, a request was made of the
treasurer to make a full financial re
port at the next meeting.
A bill against the class for the re
pair of the trap door of the Assembly
Hall stage, damaged in the recent pro
duction of "lolanthe," was rendered
and President K. L. Dole appointed R.
Woodville and R. J. Miller as a com
mittee of two to investigate the matter.
