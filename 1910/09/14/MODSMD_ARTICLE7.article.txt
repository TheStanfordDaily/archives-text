Twenty Seniors putin an appear
ance at their Class meeting this after
noon. This is indeed a lamentable
state of affairs for the Senior Class,
especially after the enviable record
that the Class of 1911 has had with
regard to class loyalty throughout its
three year's history at Stanford. Never
has that organization been found lack
ing in the spirit and the interest that
keeps unity in a class. There is every
necessity for keeping up the standard
that has been set in the past and there
is absolutely no excuse for not stand
ing behind President Dole in the work
that he will have before him this
semester. To succeed with the final
year as a class organization is certain
ly desirable and it is now within the
province of the Seniors to commence
in the work of keeping alive that
spirit which has always characterized
the Class of 1911.
