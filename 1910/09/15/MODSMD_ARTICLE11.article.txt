Stanford traditions are not so num
erous but that they can be retained
and guarded by those who compose
the University. These institutions are
not mere rules laid down by Faculty
authority, nor are they all the crea
tion of custom by students alone.
Some of them have originated with
the expressed wishes of the founders
of the University and have been re
tained as sacred remembrances of
those who have made the University a
possibility. Young as the semester is,
many of the men students have al
ready violated the spirit of the tra
dition which prohibits smoking upon
the Quad. The specific instances of
the violation of this custom is the
habit of smoking upon the top steps
of approaches to the Quad, such as
the Law steps. If the pipe of the
smoker extends beyond the line of the
Quad, the tradition is not violated,
according to many. But this does not
seem to have been the spirit in which
the custom originated. The Quad is
to be entirely rid of smoking, accord
ing to the wishes of Mrs. Stanford,
who is responsible for this tradition
and it is a direct violation of the spirit,
of this custom to not observe it more
closely and more conscientiously. It
is to be hoped that this old tradition
will be more faithfully observed in the
future.
