# CONDEMNED TO THE TUB.
## Ruthlessly Put an End to the Promising Career of a College Orator. 
### 
An eloquent youth, afflicted with
ideas of emulating the career of Web
ster and other forensic stars, was the
subject of much merriment last even
ing at Encina. It seems that the
young orator a few days ago, in a
class on public speaking, made some
remarks regarding the adaptability of
young women to university life, and
let it be understood from the tenor of
his address, that he was opposed to
co-education.
The fact that one of their class
mates should so depreciate the en
vironment of Stanford, aroused the
wrath of the Sophomores, who brought
the orator to trial last night before a
court composed of upperclassmen.
Although defending himself with a
detailed story of his life, the culprit
was unable to secure an acquittal, and
received a sentence of immersion. In
future the youth will be more guarded
in his remarks.
