# COSMOPOLITAN CLUB MEETS.
## Organization Listens to Interesting Talk by Professor H. L. Cannon on Scotland. 
### 
Before an audience of two hundred,
gathered in the University Chapel last
evening, the Cosmopolitan Club inau
gurated its year's work with a re
markably interesting illustrated lec
ture by Professor H. L. Cannon. Pro
fessor Cannon spoke on the eastern
and northern parts of Scotland, and
showed that during his extensive
travels in these regions he had taken
note of the quaint customs of the in
habitants as well as the striking fea
tures of the landscape. G. Keystone,
'12, opened the evening in a pleasing
manner with a violin solo.
At the close of the lecture, Presi
dent C. C. Wheaton called a business
meeting, at which M. Moutizuki, '11,
was elected corresponding secretary
in place of R. C. Slade,.'ll, resigned.
The election of new members was de
ferred to the next meeting, which will
be held in two weeks. The interest
displayed last night has prompted the
club to hold more open meetings in
the future.
