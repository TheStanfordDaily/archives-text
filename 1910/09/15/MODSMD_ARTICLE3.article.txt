# FOOTBALL SCHEDULE COMPLETED
## VARSITY PLAYS FIRST GAME OF SEASON ON SATURDAY. Nevada Once More in Group of Cardinal Contestants.—U. S. C. Law School Given Game. 
### 
A trip to Reno is included in the
Varsity rugby schedule as issued by
Manager Burbank. The Cardinal Fif
teen will journey to Nevada for a
game on October 22, and this will
make up all the traveling the Stanford
men will do during the two months,
with the exception of the pilgrimage
across the bay to Berkeley to play Cal
ifornia on November 12. The Reno
trip was omitted last year for reasons
that the Stanford management could
not control. The tour to the neighbor
ing state was made in 1908 and is now
reinstated in the list of dates, a fact
which will make the football season a
more picturesque one. The U. S. C.
Law School takes up the room usually
allowed by Manager Burbank for a
second contest with Nevada. The U.
S. C. Rugby enthusiasts are said to be
able to hold down one side of a lield
against a team such as the Varsity,
and the fact that the southern
part of the state is to be represented
on the schedule adds interest to it.
Variety in the date list this year has
been sought by Manager Burbank.
The Law School has a registration of
400 and can easily bring out enough
material to build up a respectable
team. The two Vancouver dates, Nov
ember 2 and 5, which were responsible
for the long delay in publishing the
dates, were confirmed by telegraph
late yesterday afternoon by Alfred
Bull to the Stanford management. The
Olympic Club and the Barbarians take
up the opening part of the list, and
they will serve to give the Varsity a
less strenuous program for the early
days of the season. California has a
larger schedule than the Cardinal, but
this, of course, is owing to their hav
ing two weeks more for the prelim
inary work.
All games, unless otherwise stated,
will be played on the turf of Stanford
Field.

The schedule follows:
Varsity Schedule.
Saturday, Sept. 17. —Olympic.
Saturday, Sept. 24.—Barbarians.
Saturday, Oct. I.—Olyn ue.
