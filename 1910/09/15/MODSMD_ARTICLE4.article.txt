# INTERCLASS SERIES PLANNED TO BEGIN NEXT WEEK.
## All Varsity Men to be Debarred From Taking Part.â€”No Holdovers to Play. 
### 
Varsity veterans will not play in the
class rugby games this year, which be
gins next week. Such a move is a
radical departure from the custom of
other class seasons, and was only re
cently decided upon by Coach Presley.
Heretofore, it has usually been the
team that could muster the greater
number of former Varsity players that
won the class series. The contests,
while fine exhibitions to watch, were
nevertheless not typically and wholly
class struggles. The Senior fifteen
nearly always held in its ranks "hold
overs" whose actual class numerals
extended back almost to the days of
the cave men. These veterans were
allowed to play and very often carried
their slower teammates to the cham
pionship. The games this year will
be class battles in name and spirit,
and the players, being recruited from
the lesser stars of the big rugby squad,
will more nearly represent their
classes.
A definite schedule for the matches
will not be arranged. The teams will
play when most convenient, announce
ment being made, of course, a short
time ahead. The games for 1910 are
one week later than those of last year.
With this minor part of the rugby pro
gram out of the way, Coach Presley
will be able to go ahead at full speed
with the development of Varsity and
Freshmen fifteens.
