# Rally Committee to Edit Program.
## 
### 
The University of California is to
make a slight innovation this year in
the matter of the souvenir football
program. This program is gotten ont
alternately by the Associated Students
of Stanford and California. In the
past the book was placed in the hands
of one man, who collected the mater
ial, secured the advertisements and
attended to its sale at the game. This
year, the California rally committee
is going to attend to the editing and
general make-lip of the program. The
management, however, will, as for
merly, be placed in the hands of some
student on a commission basis.
