# TO START TRACK WORK
## TRACK MEN TO GATHER IN NEW TRAINING QUARTERS. Fall Meet Will Take Place in November.-Cross Country Running May be Taken Up. 
### 
The fall track rally, the first step
in the development of the 1911 track
team, will he held tomorrow night at
7:30, in the new training house. At
the rally, Captain Bellah and Trainer
Moulton will outline the work to be
done by the men trying out for the
various events, and give advice as to
what branch of the sport the new can
didates should devote themselves to.
Captain Bellah wishes to impress
strongly upon all track men the neces
sity of attending the rally, as he
must obtain an idea of the men who
will turn out for the different events
in the spring. Track men who are at
present out for football, will be re
quired to attend the rally and sign up.
During the fall, especial attention
will be paid to novices. In order to
develop distance men it is likely that
cross-country running will be taken
up under the direction of some Varsity
man. As distance running is simply a
matter of hard, conscientious work,
this is considered the best way of
bringing out the latent abilities of the
candidates. If a sufficient amount .tf
interest is shown in this department
of athletics to warrant its continua
tion, the spring semester may see
regularly scheduled cross-country
runs. Cross-country meets are in
cluded among the intercollegiate ath
letic contests of all the large eastern
universities.
Freshmen will be given the unusual
opportunity of entering two meets
during the coming term. The annual
P. A. A. meet will be held in San Fran
cisco in the later part of November and
Stanford will enter a team. The 1914
track men will be coached with this
contest in view, and if any of the
Freshmen show ability they will be
included in the make-up of the Cardi
nal team. The other meet will be an
Interclass affair to be held some time
in November, after the Varsity rugby
game. The experience gained in these
meets will prove invaluable to the
new track men. In order to condition
themselves properly, the men will be
asked to begin light work on Monday
next. At the end of the rally, both old
and new men will sign up.
