# Varsity Squad In Practice Game.
## 
### 
The Varsity squad was divided into
two divisions for the first practice
line-ui) of the season on the turf field
yesterday afternoon. The Freshman
squad was given a day's rest after
their fast game with the Santa Clara
line-up on the previous day.
The veterans showed particularly
good form, both in fast scrum work
and in snappy passing among the
backfield. All of the veterans who
accampanied the All-America rugby
aggregation were given a chance to
play, excepting Horton, who is as yet
unable to play because of a bad ankle.
