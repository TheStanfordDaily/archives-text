## H. Heath Secures Information in Alaska Regarding Seal Question During Summer 
### 
Professor H. Heath, of the Zoology
department, spent a most interesting
summer in the seal islands of Alaska.
He occupied the position of temporary
naturalist for these islands, under the
Board of Fisheries of th > American
government. This board is in turn a
branch of the Department of Com
merce and Labor. As naturalist, Pro
fessor Heath's duties were to take the
annual census of seals, which has
been taken for ten years for the pur
pose of determining whether those
animals are diminishing in numebr,
and if so, to find the causes.
This year, the number of seals upon
the Pirbil of Islands, was taken as
150,000, and it .vas determined that
the numbers were diminishing year
by year; the cause for this being
pelagic sealing. Up to this year the
American industry of fishing has been
carried on by an American company
under a lease from the government,
and under strict government super
vision. This year, however, the Board
of Fisheries has assumed full control
and all revenue goes directly into the
United States.
Professor Heath secured a large
number of zoological and botanical
specimens, which he is arranging for
the Botanical and Zoological depart
ments.
