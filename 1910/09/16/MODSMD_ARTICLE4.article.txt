# VARSITY WILL MEET OLYMPIC CLUB
## Cardinal Squad Will Appear in First Game of the Season.â€”Freshmen to Line Up Against San Jose. 
### 
The temporarily formed Stanford
Varsity will have a fairly hard game
with which to start its season tomor- J
row on the turf. The Olympic Club
will face the Cardinals at 3:30 o'clock, j
after the Freshmen have tried con
clusions with San Jose High School at
2:30. The Olympics have never been j
a dangerous rival even in very early 1
games. The Varsity boasting as it
does of nine hardy trans-Pacific i
heroes, woh have practiced all sum- i
mer, should carry the San Franciscans ;
down the field for a very substantial :
score. The winged "O" men adminis- \
tered a beating to the Blue and Gold |
ten days ago to the tune of 12-0, but
that score, being made against more !
or less green players, does not indi
cate any very great strength in the i
Varsity's opponents tomorrow. The
Varsity battle-line is, of course, sub
ject to any number of changes, and an
entire second team will undoubtedly
hold down the turf at the beginning of j
the second period. Horton, the 1909
Varsity front-ranker, cannot lend his
powerful push to the scrum tomorrow
and is the only one of the 'cross-sea !
men who will not appear. His foot j
was slightly injured in Australia, and j
while the hurt is a small one, it is i
sufficient to make it the best move to
keep him out of togs for a few days.
Frank, Freshman front ranker in the [
1913 championship team, a sturd>
worker, will endeavor to balance the
fore part of the pack with Fitting in I
the initial line-up. Cheda, while being
a front ranker in the 3-2-3 scrum
last year, has been shifted back to the j
rear, where he will doubtless make an !
immense slaughter of the Cardinal

foes. Captain Dole and Minturn are
in their usual positions, with the ex
ception that Minturn must form the
lock, with the giant Partridge as the
third man of the trio. Woodcock as
sumes the responsiblity of wing-for
ward, a new position for him. Erb,
the hardy veteran, takes his natural
place at half, with Varsity player
Cass as substitute. Thoburn, Fresh
man five of last fall, is to take the
same place tomorrow, with veteran
Sanborn as second five. Worswick as
center, has had experience there last
season and should do his duty in
strong fashion. Kern is to have a
wingship, with Sundell to balance him.
The brilliant Brown is in full and
much is expected of him there.
The baby line-up is unchanged from
the last struggle, but as usual a mul
titude of first-year men will handle
places in the game. San Jose has a
team that can be counted on to give
the Freshmen a hard fight. They
were beaten last year by a large
score.
F. Cameron, conceded to be at the
top of the ladder for coast referees,
will have charge of the whistle in to
morrow's contests.
The line-ups will be: Varsity,
Frank, Fitting, Dole, Minturn, Part
ridge, Cheda, Schaupp, forwards;
Woodcock, wing forward; Erb, half;
Thoburn, fives; Worswick, center;
Kern, Sundell, wings; Brown, full.
Freshmen: R. M. Brom, Dimon.
Knight, Olinstead, Clover, Mitchell,
Boulware. forwards; Tilton, half;
Geisslei, Hall, fives; Kauffman, cen
ter; Weber, Reeves, wings; Watkins,
full.
