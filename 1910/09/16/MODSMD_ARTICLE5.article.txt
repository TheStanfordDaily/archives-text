# NEW REPRESENTATIVES ELECTED
## Departments Select Men to Fill Vacancies in Conference.-Meetings Well Attended and Close Contests Result. 
### 
The elections held this afternoon to
elect representatives to the University
Conference were well attended and in
most of the departments, close con
tests for the honors took place. This
was especially true of the Law School,
where it took the electors fully a half
hour to select the five new represen
tatives from that department. An
other close election was held in the
Geology and Mining department,
where two representatives were
chosen. Another feature of the elec
tion was the number of Juniors elect
ed. Third year men will sit in the
Conference from the History and Elec
trical Engineering departments and
also from the Law School.
