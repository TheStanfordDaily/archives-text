# NEW REPRESENTATIVES ELECTED
## Departments Select Men to Fill Vacancies in Conference.-Meetings Well Attended and Close Contests Result. 
### 
The elections held this afternoon to
elect representatives to the University
Conference were well attended and in
most of the departments, close con
tests for the honors took place. This
was especially true of the Law School,
where it took the electors fully a half
hour to select the five new represen
tatives from that department. An
other close election was held in the
Geology and Mining department,
where two representatives were
chosen. Another feature of the elec
tion was the number of Juniors elect
ed. Third year men will sit in the
Conference from the History and Elec
trical Engineering departments and
also from the Law School.
The results of today's election in
full are as follows: Law, A. B. Bian

i G. A. Ditz, '11, will compose the Uni

| 1911. The last two men are members
'• through virtue of the oflices which
they occupy.
The first, meeting of the new Con
ference will be held very shortly, so
that the work which is before the or
ganization may be started upon im
mediately. The first duty which will
come up, is the election of officers for
the year and four members of the Stu
dent Advisory Committee which is the
working executive committee of tho
larger body and the direct disciplin
ary force. H. McCowan, '09, is the
only member of last year's committee
on the campus.
The men who were elected today
will serve for two years. Those al
ready members before today's election
have the remaining year of their re
spective terms to serve.
Student Advisor Roth and those who
conducted the elections today ex
pressed themselves as pleased with
the interest shown, and with a cor
responding feeling of responsibility
among the representatives themselves,
they expect that the new Conference
will carry on successfully the work
which was ably begun by last year's
organization. The Conference will
meet every other Tuesday in the
Council Room, as it has in the past,
for its regular meetings.
The elections held this afternoon to
elect representatives to the University
Conference were well attended and in
most of the departments, close con
tests for the honors took place. This
was especially true of the Law School,
where it took the electors fully a half
hour to select the five new represen
tatives from that department. An
other close election was held in the
Geology and Mining department,
where two representatives were
chosen. Another feature of the elec
tion was the number of Juniors elect
ed. Third year men will sit in the
Conference from the History and Elec
trical Engineering departments and
also from the Law School.
The results of today's election in
full are as follows: Law, A. B. Bian
