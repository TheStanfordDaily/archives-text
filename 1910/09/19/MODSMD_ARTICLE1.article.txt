# SEVENTY-FIVE CANDIDATES FOR FALL TRACK TRAINING
## 
### 
Seventy-five undergraduates handed
in their names to track captain Bellah,
last Saturday night, as intending to
participate in the fall training sea
son. About one hundred men inter
ested in track work attended the rally,
but the football season kept many of
these men from signing up.
The rally was opened by Captain
Bellah outlining the purpose of fall
training. In his short address, the
captain urged everyone intending to
appear on track during the spring to
begin training immediately. "Whether
or not a man has ever worn spikes be
fore should not prevent him from
turning out for track," said Bellah.
"By consistent work a man may dis
cover abilities which he never before
suspected himself of possessing."
"Four years of hard work will gain
for any healthy average man, a var
sity emblem in track or field com
petition." This is what " Dad"
Moulton claims, and states that he will
back it up with proof. Tha veteran
trainer explained the opportunities
which track work holds open, showing
that 112 men can gain places on a
track team while football or baseball
require only an extremely limited
number. The advantage to the gen
eral health of the man who worked on
the track, "Dad" stated were too ob
vious to be commented on.
Several Varsity men were called on
for short talks. All emphasized the
need of consistent, daily work in de
veloping speed on the cinder path or
skill in the field events. W. M. Wy
man, '11, C. C. Taylor, '11, T. L. Cole

intend to begin light work this week
and by systematic training, prepare
themselves for the spring.
