# STANFORD RUGBY TEAMS ARE VICTORIOUS IN FAST GAMES
## 
### 
Both Cardinal fifteens, Varsity and
Freshman, took the measure of their
opponents on Stanford Feld last Sat
urday. The Varsity scored 14-0 against
the Olympics, and the Freshmen com
pletely outclassed San Jose, 33-0.
The Varsity play brought out no Start
ling details to makethisyear standout
ahead of the opening games of other
seasons. There was little, if any
teamwork, but individual ability was
everywhere seen. The backs had few
passing rushes to their credit, and
they could not get together in that re
spect at all. But wherever a runner
had a chance to carry through his own
run, alone and unsupported, ground
was covered and a score was chalked
up. Pasting was poor, but it was both
ends of the pass that suffered. The
runner wasn't always in his place to
receive the pigskin, and when he was,
the throw was bad. Coach Presley
was forced to repair his backfield at
one point of the game, and this kept
teamwork back considerably. The
forwards extracted the greatest
amount of concentrated fight and sup
port of each other that was shown on
the field. They made headway, blocked
kicks and used the finer arts of drib
bling to a gratifying extent. Pure
strength was in them when science
went by the board, and they put down
a try or two by simple pull and push.
Minturn was good at blocking, Cheda,
Schaupp, Partridge and Captain Dole
were much in evidence in the thick of
the struggle. Considering individual
playing alone, Brown was a top-notch
er. Being put into a strange position
at center in the middle of the first
half, he found many holes. The style
of work in his rightful place at full
back, however, kept him in the indivi
dual groove of play. lie depended too
much upon himself as a full back usu
ally must, and did not make use of his
team-mates enough. Erb, who re-

tired to the defense line alone, filling
Brown's place, was a finished product,
fie was never at a loss where to send
the leather, even with several Winged
"O" men camping on his chest. San
born handled himself well during the
first half and was responsible, with
his straight-as-a'n arrow style of play,
for the first try. lie lost a great deal
of his spirit in the second period, how
ever, and was not sure of himself.
It took the Varsity ten minutes to
get in its paces. With the ball in mid
field, Stanford took charge of it and
deposited it on the Olympic 5. A
scrum from here gave the ball into
Sanborn's hands at tlie 20, on a direct
pass from Erb. Sanborn went over
like a rocket, for the first three points.
Brown converted with a pretty kick.
Partridge, bearing down on the di
minutive Parker on the Olympic 20
in the second half, intercepted a pass
to the little Winged "0" half back and
dragged the ball and several San
Franciscans over for a second try.
Brown failed to place the pigskin be
tween the posts. Score, Varsity, 8;
Olympic Club, 0.
Sundell dove a dozen feet to put the
ball across in the third try. Receiv
ing a pass from Brown, he went ahead
like an express train and evaded two
good tackles. Brown missed his goal.
Score, 11-0.
Thoburn, picking up, went 25 yards
unaided.for the last score. Brown did
not convert. Score, 14-0.
The Freshmen had too easy a time
with the high school team to make
much of an impression as players.
Geissler was no more to be resisted
than a stone wall, and this applies in
less degree to practically all of the
backs of the first line-up that Coach
Presley put into the game. This back
field held the Cardinal reins until al
most the end of the contest and were
responsible for the great inequality of
the score.
Several former Stanford players ap
peared in the Olympic line-up. They
were S. L. Goodell, ex-'O9, L. Laumeis
ter, ex-'O7, J. R. I-lickey, ex-'OS, Mol
flno, '07, A. E. Roth, '09, and G. Mc-
Gregor, '09.
Freshmen Worst San Jose.
First Half
Geissler kicked off. A fumble by
San Jose carried the play well down
into their territory. From the one
yard line Tilton, Geissler, and Harri
gan made the first try. Geissler failed
to convert. A free kick for San Jose
took the pigskin well down in Fresh
man territory. Fighting hard, the
first-year men carried the ball close to
San Jose's line. On a free kick for the
Freshmen, Harrigan kicked a goal in
the Freshmen's 20. After several min
utes of fight Boulware made a try.
Harrigan failed to convert.
Reeves, Boulware and Geissler were
responsible for the seven succeeding
tries. Several of these were converted
by Darsie, totaling 33-0.
