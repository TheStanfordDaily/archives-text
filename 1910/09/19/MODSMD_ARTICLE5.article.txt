# PROFESSOR J.E. MATZKE DIES IN MEXICAN CAPITAL
## 
### 
The University community was
shocked at the receipt of a telegram
this forenoon from President Benja
min Ide Wheeler, of the University o"
California to Acting-President J. C.
Branner, notifying him of the sudden
death of Professor John Ernst Matzke
at the City of Mexico. Both Dr. Wheel
er and Professor Matzke were repre
senting their respective Universities
at the founding of the new National
University of Mexico. The telegram
did not state the time of the death, but
as an earlier telegram was received
yesterday afternoon from President
Wheeler stating that Professor Matzke
had been taken suddenly ill with cere
bral hemorrhage, the end must have
come late yesterday afternoon or even
ing.
Friends of the deceased are at a loss
to account for his sudden illness, as
ho left the campus upon the tenth of
the month in the best of health. The
receipt of a letter shortly after his
arrival telling of the intense heat and
of the crowded condition of the cars,
leads some to believe that he was
overcome by heat and the unaccus
tomed altitude.

Immediately upon the receipt of the
first telegram, Vice-President Branner
sent Professor G. C. Allen, of the
French department, to the City of
Mexico. The latter left yesterday
evening and upon his arirval at El
Paso, he will he notified of the death
and will be instructed to bring the
body to the campus with all possible
haste. Professor Allen is expected to
return by Monday or Tuesday of next
week. He will reach the capitol city
by September 22, which was the date
that Professor Matzke was to have
presented Stanford's greeting at the
founding exercises of the new Mexican
University. Funeral arrangements
cannot be made definitely until Pro
fessor Allen's return, other than that
Dr. D. C. Gardner will conduct the
final rites.
Professor John Ernst Matzke has
been at the head of the Department of
Romanic Languages continuously
since 1893 and was one of the most
beloved of faculty men, both among
his associates and those studying
under him. He was thoroughly equip
ped in every way for the work of his
department, both as an instructor and
as an executive. A large number of
text books bear bis name as author,
and the works which he has edited and
revised are of still greater number.
He was considered as one of the lead
ing, authorities in French philology
and literature. He has held a posi
tion on the Faculty Committee of Ad
mission and Advanced Standidng for
several years.
The deceased was born in Breslau,
Germany, October 20, 1862 and took
his A. B. Degree from Hope College,
Michigan, in 1882 and his Ph. D. at
John Hopkins in 1888. He was a Pro

The University community was
shocked at the receipt of a telegram
this forenoon from President Benja
min Ide Wheeler, of the University o"
California to Acting-President J. C.
Branner, notifying him of the sudden
death of Professor John Ernst Matzke
at the City of Mexico. Both Dr. Wheel
er and Professor Matzke were repre
senting their respective Universities
at the founding of the new National
University of Mexico. The telegram
did not state the time of the death, but
as an earlier telegram was received
yesterday afternoon from President
Wheeler stating that Professor Matzke
had been taken suddenly ill with cere
bral hemorrhage, the end must have
come late yesterday afternoon or even
ing.
Friends of the deceased are at a loss
to account for his sudden illness, as
ho left the campus upon the tenth of
the month in the best of health. The
receipt of a letter shortly after his
arrival telling of the intense heat and
of the crowded condition of the cars,
leads some to believe that he was
overcome by heat and the unaccus
tomed altitude.

Immediately upon the receipt of the
first telegram, Vice-President Branner
sent Professor G. C. Allen, of the
French department, to the City of
Mexico. The latter left yesterday
evening and upon his arirval at El
Paso, he will he notified of the death
and will be instructed to bring the
body to the campus with all possible
haste. Professor Allen is expected to
return by Monday or Tuesday of next
week. He will reach the capitol city
by September 22, which was the date
that Professor Matzke was to have
presented Stanford's greeting at the
founding exercises of the new Mexican
University. Funeral arrangements
cannot be made definitely until Pro
fessor Allen's return, other than that
Dr. D. C. Gardner will conduct the
final rites.
Professor John Ernst Matzke has
been at the head of the Department of
Romanic Languages continuously
since 1893 and was one of the most
beloved of faculty men, both among
his associates and those studying
under him. He was thoroughly equip
ped in every way for the work of his
department, both as an instructor and
as an executive. A large number of
text books bear bis name as author,
and the works which he has edited and
revised are of still greater number.
He was considered as one of the lead
ing, authorities in French philology
and literature. He has held a posi
tion on the Faculty Committee of Ad
mission and Advanced Standidng for
several years.
The deceased was born in Breslau,
Germany, October 20, 1862 and took
his A. B. Degree from Hope College,
Michigan, in 1882 and his Ph. D. at
John Hopkins in 1888. He was a Pro
fessor in French in Bowdoin College
from 1889 till 1890, and of Romanic
Languages at The University of In
diana the following year. Previous to
coming to Stanford, he was an asso
ciate professor of Romanic Languages
at Johns Hopkins. He was a member
of the American Philological Associa
tion and of the Modern Language As
sociation, and was an extensive con
tributor to philological publications.
