# BAND RAPIDLY FORMING.
## Good Prospects in View for New Musical Organization Forming Under Original Flans. 
### 
It seems probable from the showing,
both in spirit and material, made at
the last business meeting of the newly
organized band, that Stanford is go
ing to have a military musical or
ganization this year which will be in
every way worthy to represent the
institution. Thirty-six men have
been assigned parts already, and there
are at least ten other possible can
didates. Rehearsals under the per
sonal direction of Professor Martin
will be held on Tuesdays and Thurs
days from 4:3. r > to 5:35 p.m. It is the
plan of the band to renew an old cus
tom this year, and, aside from the
regular work, to give monthly con
certs either on the Quad or at Lake
Lagunita. C. H. Beal, T. M. Cramer,
E. J. Newcomer, B. Sanford, R. R.
Beal, and Professor Martin were ap
pointed by leader T. K. Stark to make
up an executive committee. The gen
eral management and further organi
zation of the movement will be in the
hands of this committee.
