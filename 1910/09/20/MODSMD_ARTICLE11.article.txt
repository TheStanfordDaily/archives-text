A communication has been received
by the Daily Palo Alto from the Stunt
Committee requesting tfiat individuals
from the Student Body submit ideas
upon "stunts" that can be used during
the intercollegiate contest next
November. The appeal has been made
because the committee realizes that
there are many among the Associated
Studes who have original suggestions
that are worthy of being used. But
these individuals will not submit the
same without some special inducement
and the committee has by this means
endeavored to show them that their
efforts will greatly aid them in then
work. To help this board will mean
merely the suggestion of various ideas
and as the "stunts" affect all as stu
dents, there should be many sugges
tions coming from the Student Body.
The dance which is to be given on
October the eighth, means an in
crease in the amount that is to be ex
pended upon accessory bleacher
"stunts" this year. To make this func
tion a success, and to assure the in
creased amount of available money
for the Stunt Committee, it needs the
assistance of the Student Body and to
give this aid, means attendance at
the dance. The object is a worthy one
and is to be supported by the co
operation of every student in a posi
tion to assist. Our bleacher "stunts"
this year must cooperate with the
bleacher spirit in backing a winning
team.
