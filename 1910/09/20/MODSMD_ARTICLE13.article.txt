The Bleacher Stunt Committee is a
board selected to arrange the presen
tation of special features upon the
bleachers during the Varsity game on
November 12. The committee wishes
to take this opportunity to appeal to
the members of the Student Body for
suggestions and original ideas for
"stunts." If there are plans that any
student can olfer, they will be gladly
accepted by the committee, and any
suggestions arise, they should not be
dismissed, but submitted to the board
for use by them. This appeal fs made
in order that the "stunts" used this
year at he Varsity game will surpass
those that have been given during past
years.
The Bleacher Stunt Committee,
H. Rittigstein, '10.
