# Musical Clubs Join in Work.
## 
### 
Arrangements have been completed
for the production of a musicale on
the evening of November 4, under the
auspices of the University Mandolin
and Glee Clubs. As this date is the
day before the final contest between
the Varsity and Vancouver rugby
teams, it is very probable that this
event will be one of the entertain
ments that the Vancouver men will
have the opportunity of attending.
At the present writing, the men in
charge of this production stated that
a large number of new skits and
stunts have been promised by the
people who will take part, and that it
is the hope of the clubs to make it a
certain success.
Special features will be rendered
by the Mandolin and Glee clubs sepa
rately, and according to the plans now
being carried out, vaudeville will be
included in the evening's program.
