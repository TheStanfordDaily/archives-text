first soccer team, while A. W. Hig
gins, '12, was chosen as a substitute
to take charge of the squad in the
absence of Captain McCann.
McCann and Higgins are both vet
erans of last year's team and are ex
ceedingly well fitted to fulfill their

more familiar with the game than any
of the other men. McCann registers
from the Geology department and
played left full on last year's team,
while Higgins registers from the
Electrical Engineering department
and last year played inside right.

S. Pellas, '14, and Gragg, '12.
A meeting of the Executive Com
