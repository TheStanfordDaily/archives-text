# ELDRIDGE DELIVERS SERMON.
## Berkeley Pastor Speaks of "The Love of Christ as the Motive of Life." 
### 
Each succeeding Sunday the number
of students attending Chapel services
has so increased that Sunday morn
ing the Chapel was filled to its capa
city. During the past week the daily
morning devotions held in the vestry,
have had an exceptional attendance.
The service was prefaced by E.
Joulin's rendition of an aria, by
Bach, and by a solo, "The Publican,"
sung by H. B. Maguire. Rev. George
S. Eldridge of the Presbyterian church
of Berkeley, delivered an unusually
pleasing sermon upon the subject,
"The Love of Christ as the Motive of
Life." The point the speaker made
was that every life must have its
guiding motive; that the love of
Christ was the truest and best motive
of life as a whole: the life of today
and that of Eternity. Rev. Eldridge
said in part: "To say with Saint
Paul, 'The love of Christ constraineth
me,' is to admit having the truest mo
tive of the ideal life. As the carrying
capacity and travelling radius of a
ship are determined by the character
of the fuel burned, so the true worth
of a life, its fullness and capability, is
dependent upon its motive. We should
be careful in the selection of our
heart's fuel: the best fuel is the love
of Christ."
