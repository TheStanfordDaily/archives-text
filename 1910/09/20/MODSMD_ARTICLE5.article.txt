# WILL GIVE BENEFIT
## STUNT COMMITTEE TO GET FUNDS FROM DANCE. Propose to Have Novel Amusements at the Armory Hall Affair. 
### 
The Stunt Committee, recently ap
pointed by the Executive Committee
( to assume charge of all arrangements
for special features during the Var
sity game next November, has started
its work in a novel manner. Their
first effort will be along the line of
securing sufficient funds to finance an
elaborate program for the benefit of
the bleachers.
In order to tax the individual sub
scribers less and to give all donors
something for the amounts that they
jwill add to the fund, the board has
decided to give an informal dance and
charge admission to the same. A con
siderable sum should be realized by
this means as there are few who
jWill not take advantage of this op
portunity to assist Ihe committee in its
work.
The dance will be given upon the
evening of October 8, while Chairman
Rittigstein announces that the Armory
in Palo Alto has been secured for the
occasion. A program of eighteen
straight dances will be provided and
the music that is to be furnished will
be supplied by the new University
Band of forty pieces. This will be one
of the last affairs at which Varsity
men can attend, as they will go into
strict, training soon after.
Fearing that such an uninterrupted
program of dances would provide
more enjoyment than those attending
could endure, Rittigstein has arranged
that refreshments will be served.
While the serving of refreshments
cannot be said to be a new idea, the
manner in which, they are to be set
before the dancers on October S, is
entirely novel and surpirsing.
