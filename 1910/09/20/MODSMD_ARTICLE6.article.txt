# TRAIN DERAILS SAN JOSE CAR.
## S.P. Freight Overturns Cur Hound for Palo Alto.—No One Injured. 
### 
I The passengers on a car returning
from San Jose, including a number of
.women students of the University,
■went through an exciting experience
at 9:15 this morning, when their car
was struck and overturned by a
freight train in the Southern Pacific
siding in Palo Alto. The accident
was unusual for one of its nature in
that no one was injured. The crew
of Ihe train are blamed by many for
their negligence in proceeding direct
ly northward across the street where
the car was standing. It was carried
several feet by the impact and then
turned over on its side on the track,
where it remains awaiting the arrival
of a de/rick from San Francisco.
