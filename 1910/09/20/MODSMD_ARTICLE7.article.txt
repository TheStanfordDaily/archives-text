# TO PLAY FAST RUGBY
## PALO ALTO TEAM WILL MAKE FRESHMEN HUSTLE. A 						Lively Game is Exported When the 1914 Players Meet Local High School. 
### 
The snappy little team from the
| Palo Alto High School meets the Car
dinal Freshmen on the turf tomorrow
jafternoon at 4:45. There will bo few
changes in the Stanford line-up, and
| none radical in any respect. Stan
dish will be a returned member of the
jbackfield. He has been out of the
game for a week with a rather serious
j vaccination case. If he has lost none
of his knack at rugby he should be
able to make a strong light for a place
among the backs. The forwards are
slightly changed from last Saturday's
line-up, but they have held the posi
tions for which they are named dur
ing the last two days of practice.
Blase and Barman are the new faces
in the line. Palo Alto has always de
veloped several hardy players and this
year will undoubtedly be no exception
to the rule of the near-by school. The
game tomorrow should be sufficiently
fast to be interesting. Twenty-five
cents admission will be charged.
The line-ups are:
Freshmen —Brown, Barman, Blase,
Olmtsead, Clover, Boulware, Mitchell,
forwards; Darsie, wing forward: Til
ton, half; Reeves, Harrigan, Standish,
lives; Geissler, center; Green, Weber;
wings; Kauffman, full.
Palo Alto—Taul, Soper, Dubendurt,
Mills, Clark, Gladtsone, Ramsey, for
wards; Davidson, wing forward; Groff,
half; D. Risling, E. Risling; fives;
Howe, center; Conalton, Dingley,
wings; Hutchinson, full.
