# UNDERCLASS TEAMS TO PLAY.
## Annual Sophomore-Freshman Rugby Game Will Take Place On Monday. 
### 
Freshmen and Sophomores will fight
their struggle in the inter-class rugby
series on next Monday afternoon
Owing to the fact that the baby team
is in the thick of its work preparing
for the California battle on October
15, it has been hard for Coach Presley
to get a date for the underclass match.
In case the first year men win next
Monday it will be a still further prob
lem to choose the best time for
them to play the winner of today's
Junior-Senior contest for the num
erals. In the event of 1914 winning,
the championship set-to might drag
along for a week or two. With the
Sophomores victors on Monday, the
game could be easily arranged and
would probably be set for next week.
