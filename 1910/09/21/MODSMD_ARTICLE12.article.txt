# Houses Left in Darkness.
## 
### 
Some excitement, and considerable
inconvenience to the houses located
on the west side of Lasuen street, re
sulted from the breaking down and
short circuiting of two high volted
electric wires last night in front of
the Phi Delta Theta house. The wires
fell across the sidewalk, where they
burned for several hours, until the
Redwood City Light and Power Com
pany's electricians could arrive. The
nature of the damage was such that it
could not be repaired last night and
the entire left side of the row was
left in darkness.
