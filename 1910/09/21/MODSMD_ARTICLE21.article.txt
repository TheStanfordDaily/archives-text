# Adams to Repeat Popular Lecture.
## 
### 
Those on the campus who were not
enrolled in Professor E. D. Adams'
course in American History last se
mester and therefore missed the good
fortune of hearing the concluding lec
ture of the course on "The growth of
American Ideals" will have the oppor
tunity of doing so next Tuesday even
ing, when Professor Adams speaks
before the Nestoria Literary Society.
This meeting, as are all other meet
ings of the society, will be open to the
public. The speaker will give the
identical lecture with which he closed
the work of History 7, and if the pro
found impression which it made upon
his class is any criterion, room 214
will be well filled next Tuesday even
ing.
