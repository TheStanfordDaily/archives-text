# Will Eliminate Contestants.
## 
### 
A process of elimination will be
used tonight by the Executive Com
mittee in reducing the number of can
didates who are contesting for posi
tions as yell leaders. Out of the
number who are now trying out, the
committee will select five and the
eventual three men, who will lead yells
this year, will be chosen from those
selected. The tryouts for these five
candidates will continue for some time
until the board is satisfied that they
can make a satisfactory choice. Straw
ballots will still be taken after each
practice.
