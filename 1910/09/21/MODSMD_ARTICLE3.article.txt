# INCOME IS SMALLER
## STUDENT BODY REVENUE WILL BE CUT DOWN. Few Assessments are Paid and Attendance at Games is Slighter than Previously. 
### 
The Stanford student of the future
may be characterized by his spirit of
parsimony, if the present economic
tendencies of the Student Body con
tinue a little longer. Probably the
tariff, or the high rate of interest has
something to do with ihe problem, but
whatever the causes may be, the facts
are, that the management of the Stu
dent Body activities is facing a serious
financial predicament. Not only have
comparatively few students paid their
assessments, but the income derived
from the football games is diminish
ing with each contest.
According to Graduate Manager
Burbank, in the year 1909, there were
115G students who paid dues, which
amounted to $2276. Of this number,
792 were men and 364 women. The
men paid a total of $1584, the women
$692. There were only some 300
students who did not contribute in
1909. Apparently the rally held at
the beginning of the semester, with
the very laudable intention of inter
esting the college public in the finan
cial management of Student Body af
fairs, has had an unlooked for effect
in centering the attention of under
graduates upon their own finances and
pocket-books.
The record made this year is shown
by the figures which follow. With a
total registration of over 1500, but 880
students have paid up. This means
that the receipts are only $1760 or
$516 less than in 1009. The contri
butors of this amount are evenly div
ided between the two sexes. The wo
men paid in $510, while the men
swelled the total by contributing
$1250. As this money is turned over
directly to the Board of Control, for
the upkeep of all athletic grounds, the
smallness of the sum precludes any
additions to the fields and will scarce
ly cover necessary running expenses.
Attendance at the football games
has also decreased to a startling ex
tent. Manager Burbank states that
the difference in receipts between the
first three games in 1909, and similar
contests in 1910, amounts to forty
five dollars. The first game in the
1909 season brought in $117.25; the
second, $81.50; the third $279.50. The
total for these games was $178.45. In
1910, the paid admissions at the first
game amounted to $104.00; the second
game, $82.75; while the third attracted
$247.50.
