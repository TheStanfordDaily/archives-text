### 
The feature of the program of Nes
toria Literary Society yesterday even
ing, was the address by Professor H.
E. Bolton, of the Department of His
tory, on the "Making of Modern Mex
ico." As Professor Bolton is undoubt
edly the greatest living authority on
the history of the Southwest and Mex
ico, his extended talk before the so
ciety was listened to with great in
terest. He has made at least ten
trips to Mexico within the last eight
years, during which time he has spent
many months reading and investigat
ing the most ancient historical
sources. During one of his last visits,
he discovered a long lost library in
one of the old Catholic monasteries,
which has since proved one of the
most valuable and authentic accounts
of the Spanish Conquest.
Professor Bolton, in speaking of
Modern Mexico, traced her history
from the time of her war for indepen
dence to the present day. In charac
terizing the present executive, he
branded him as the most despotic rul
er of modern times, and yet gave him
credit for what he has done in making
Mexico a solvent and respected nation.
He said that the condition of the re
public at the outset of his "reign"
justified the harsh measures that he
has used. His account of the farcical
elections was very amusing.
The speaker has consented to give
an oillustrated lecture before the so
ciety on October 11, on the "Indian
Tribes of Mexico."
Intercollegiate athletic rivalry, in
an illustrated lecture before the So
general subject for the next Bonn
heim Dissertation, was the regular
question for debate. The affirmative
side, which argued that interclass
athletics would be of greater benefit to
the University public as a whole than
intercollegiate, was upheld by P. H.
Hilton, '11, and F. S. Pratt, '13, and
was given the decision of the judges.
The negative speakers were L. L. Hill,
'11, and I. D. Payne, '13.
