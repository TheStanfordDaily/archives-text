The attention of the Student Body
has already been brought to the de
ficiency in the amount of Student Body
assessments that have been paid to
Manager Burbank. In another column
of this issue, a statement from the
treasurer shows that the receipts
from this source this year have fallen
away by the sum of $516, while the
registration this semester is heavier
than last year. Another remarkable
fact in the finances of the Associated
Student Body is the delinquency in the
receipts that have been so far obtained
from the preliminary games. We do
not care to entertain the idea that
there is a decreasing interest in the
major sport, yet from the figures as
presented by the Student Body man
ager, this is the natural inference.
In the first place, assessments are ab
solutely necessary to give the Board
of Control sufficient funds to carry on
the work they have in charge. Stu
dents in the past have had no difficulty
in meeting this obligation that is due
annually and despite the registration
fee this year, there should be no diffi
culty so great that two hundred and
fifty-eight students should have slight
ed this duty they owe to the Student
Body, There is also in the composi
tion and welfare of the political or
ganization of the Student Body, as
there can be no vote cast by any mem
ber of the Associated Students who
has not paid his assessment. Whether
there is a lack of interest in football
and other sports this year, remains to
be seen in the results of the season,
but the year lias been started under a
heavy financial handicap. There is
every opportunity to make up this de

ficiency and every individual in the
Student Body, who has not paid his
assessment, should make his separate
effort to pay the same and put the
year upon the same basis as other
seasons.
