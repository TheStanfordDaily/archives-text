# CLUBS CHANGE PLAYS
## "THE DEVIL'S DISCIPLE" WILL REPLACE "THE ONLY WAY." Generously Donate Twenty-five Per Cent of Net Proceeds to Bleacher Fund.

"The Devil's Disciple," a comedy
drama written by George Bernard
Shaw, has been chosen by Sword and
Sandals and The Masquers for pro
duction on October 29, instead of "The
Only Way." Difficulties in securing
the rights to the latter play, led to the
substitution of Shaw's clever work.
Henry Miller and Margaret Anglin
presented the Shaw drama on the
coast some time ago. Richard Mans
field also used the play as a vehicle
to exhibit his remarkable powers of
character delineation.
The plot of the drama is laid in
America during early Colonial days,
and is charming in its depiction of life.
Although the brilliant Irishman calls
his production a melodrama, and
states that it is the only one which
he has ever written, the play savora
nothing of the melodramatic, and is
essentially a comedy-drama. As
could Le expected in any work from
the pen of this writer, the lines are
sparkling and filled with "Shawism."
If the reception which has been ac
corded the production of Shaw's works
here in the past be any criterion, "The
Devil's Disciple" will be played to a
crowded house.
In order to help along the Stunt
Committee in its work of securing
funds for the Varsity game, the Dra
matic clubs have generously donated
twenty-five per cent of the net pro
ceeds of the production to the bleacher
fund. This magnanimous offer on the
part o fthe thespians was made un
conditionally, and should reap a neat
sum to the committee.
