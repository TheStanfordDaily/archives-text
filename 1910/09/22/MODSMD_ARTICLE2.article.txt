# P. F. JERNEGAN TO LECTURE.
## Illustrated Address Under Auspices of Y.M.C.A Sunday Evening on the Philippines. 
### 
Under the joint auspices of the
Young Men's and Young Women's
Christian Associations, an illustrated
lecture will be given in the Chapel,
next Sunday evening, by P. F. .Terne
gan, on the subject, "Our Little Brown
Brothers." Jernegan will no doubt
make the address very interesting to
his hearers, as he is an old college
man himself, having graduated with
the class of '98 from Brown, where he
was President of the Y. M. C. A., a
member of the crew and of Phi Beta
Kappa. He has spent several years in
the Philippine Islands teaching in the
Government Normal School, and is
now bringing before the people of this
country the conditions in these little
known islands. He will tell of the
wild native tribes, and the condition of
the Philippines in war and peace.
Special musical numbers will be
given, this feature being in charge of
the Y. W. C. A. The lecture is open to
all.
