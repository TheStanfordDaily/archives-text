# TO START TRAINING
## STRICT RULES IN FORCE FOR SQUAD ON MONDAY. All Veterans Appear on Field for First Time in Practice Game Today. 
### 
The veterans of the Varsity squad
lined up for a short scrimmage on the
turf field this afternoon at 4:45. All
the men who saw service in Australia
last summer, were given a chance to
limber up during the short contest.
Horton was seen in the pack for the
first time this semester.
After yesterday's hard fought battle,
the Freshmen were given only very
light practice. The Freshman squad
now comprises fifty of the first year
men, from which Coach Presley will
pick the fifteen men who will contest
with the Blue and Gold for Freshman
Intercollegiate honors.
Ninety men, many of whom are the
veterans who have fought under the
Cardinal's color in many contests, go
to make up the Varsity squad. No cut
will probably be made in these two
squads until after the final match in
the Interclass Rugby Championship
seriea.
Beginning next Monday morning,
strict training rules will go into ef
fect for the Varsity squad. This means
that every candidate for a place upon
j the team must strictly adhere to the
I rules as laid down by Coach Presley
â–  and Trainer Moulton until the close of
I the rugby season.
