# SEASON TICKETS MAY BE ISSUED
## Student Body Manager D. W. Burbank Has Conditional Plan for Cheap Rate to Rugby Games. 
### 
Student Body Manager, D. W. Bur
bank, in an endeavor to place before
as many students as possible an op
portunity to witness all preliminary
rugby games this season, has ligured
out a system whereby he can offer a
cheap rate to all students. But this
can only be made possible under cer
tain conditions, which in themselves
are not onerous, but constitute a pure
ly business proposition whereby the
Student Body is obtaining a cheane
rate for i(s rugby games.
There are nine games left in the
rugby schedule at the present time
that will l:e played upon the campus,
the admissions of which as separate
games would amount to the sum of
$2.75. This figure does not include
the Intercollegiate Freshman congest
on October 15.
By the Manager's plan however, a
season ticket may be purchased for
the sum of two dollars. This admis
sion card will be valid for entrance to
all games upon the campus except the
Intercollegiate Freshman struggle.
But to make this scheme possible,
Manager Burbank has stated that
eight hundred tickets must be sold and
that only under these conditions can
the plan be forwarded and warrant
the reduction in the price of the ad
mission to the various games.
These admission cards will go on
sale within a few days, but only those
who have paid their Student Body as
sessments will be allowed the advan
tages of this reduction. Various stu
dents will be selected by Burbank to
handle this proposition. They will be

authorized to start their canvass next
Monday. No money is to be received
at that time, but the tickets will be
distributed to all those who express a
desire to purchase and who give their
promise that they will ultimately pay
for the same. If any student wishes
to secure a ticket and has not paid
his Student Body assessment, he may
pay the person selling the season
tickets, who will be authorized to re
ceive money and give a receipt for the
same. The purhcaser may then secure
his season admission card.
When Manager Burbank has receiv
ed word that eight hundred cards have
been sent out on the promise of pay
ment, a final settlement will be made.
This will be accomplished by station
ing a man at the gate at Stanford
Field next Wednesday or Saturday
afternoon, whose duty it shall be to
receive payment for the tickets. Upon
presentation of the two dollars, he
will stamp the card as paid and they
will be valid thereafter for admission
to all games during the season with
the one exception of the intercollegi
ate game mentioned above. But this
final settlement cannot be made until
a guarantee has been secured from the
various agents who will obtain the
promises that eight hundred persons
have expressed their willingness to
support this movement, or to take ad
vantage of the opportunity of witness
ing all games at a minimum rate. If
this number cannot be secured the
scheme cannot be consummated by
Manager Burbank and the regular ad
mission will be charged at all gamer.
