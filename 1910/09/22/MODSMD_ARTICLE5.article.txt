# FAST TOURNAMENT IN PROGRESS
## New Material Showing Up Well in Handicap Tennis Play.— Finals to be Played Next Week. 
### 
The play in the first handicap ten
nis tournament, which is now being
contested on the Encina Courts, is
well advanced and the chances are
that the finals will be played the first
of next week. The third round has
been reached in the upper half, but
owing to some difficulty in arranging
dates for the matches, the lower half
is still in the second round.
The matches as a rule have been
very close and some good tennis has
been shown for this early in the sea
son. Of the new men, F. M. Doug
lass, '13, has made the best showing,
but several of the other cracks, in
cluding Dawson, Cawston, and W. G.
Murray have not played their matches
yet. Dawson and Cawston are both
practicing every day and should give a
good account of themselves when they
get into action. Murray has not ap
peared on the local courts, but judg
ing from his past record, he should be
able to give the best, local players a
hard fight. He is the present holder
of the Washington State champion
ship.
Of the old men, neither Morgan, the
University champion, nor Grace, the

Junior, crack, are in the tournament.,
a3 they are out for football. Mann,
Murray, and Shaul, of last year's Var
sity team, are playing- brilliant tennis.
