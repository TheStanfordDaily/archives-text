# FAST GAME IS SCHEDULED WITH BARBARIANS TOMORROW
## 
### 
Rugby will be dealt out in large
quantities on Saturday afternoon.
The turf of Stanford Field is to be oc
cupied with three contests of the Eng
lish game, starting at 1:30. The Var
sity is to give the San Francisco Bar
barians a tussle for honors at 4
o'clock; 1914 will take care of St
Mary's College fifteen at 2:30, and as
a curtain raiser, Manzanita High lines
up against a fifteen taken from the
Freshman squad, presumably of those
who will not play in the later baby
struggle. The Varsity-Barbarian bat
tle will take the center of the stage.
The California veteran team defeated
them decisively last Saturday by the
score of 32-."), and the outcome of to
morrow's game here may throw some
light upon the rugby situation, al
though team comparisons are of little
value at best. S. Mitchell, having re
turned from the south, the Varsity
backfield will receive a substantial
brace. He resumes his place at sec
ond five, and one of Coach Presley's
early season problems is partly solved.
It was hard work in the Olympic game
to put together a powerful enough
line of backs, and the backfield was
thrown all out of shape in the first
match of the season. Tomorrow Tho
burn will be able to take his share of
the responsibility at first five, and
Sanborn goes back to center, in which
place he played against California last
fall. The wings are unchanged, Kern
and Sundell still holding up their
ends well in practice. Frank and Ar
rell appear as front rankers. Ilorton
was not able to take his place in the
game again as was thought likely
The Freshmen fighters have not

been changed since last Wednesday
with the exception that Card will take
side rank. He has been a hard work
er and will be given a chance to show
what his ability is in the opening half.
The 1914 opponents, St. Mary's, have a
scoring team. They overwhelmed
Mission High Wednesday, putting
them out of sight with a 29-0 tally list.
Mission High is to meet the Cardinal
first year team one week from Satur
day. The Cardinal novices will have
to gather all their brawn to come off
the field tomorrow with a scalp.
Admission for the games will be 50
cents.
C. L. Reading will probably referee
the Varsity-Barbarian game, while W.
P. Fuller, '10, is to hold the whistle for
the 1914-St. Mary's battle.
