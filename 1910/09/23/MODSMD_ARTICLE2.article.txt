# CREW WISHES RECOGNITION IN INTERCOLLEGIATE SPORTS
## 
### 
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
At a meeting of the Boat Club, held
last night, the members of that organi
zation resolved to bring the issue of
the reestablishment of boating as a
branch of intercollegiate athletics
squarely before the minds of the Uni
versity public. We therefore take ad
vantage of this means to state our
case and show why rowing is worthy
of once more receiving the Student
Body's support.
The boating season of two years ago
culminated in a series of unusual and
unfortunate events which were the di
rect causes of the sport being con
demned and finally dropped by the Ex
ecutive Committee. Extravagance in
the management of rowing affairs had
drained the Student Body's treasury of
over $4,000. Two crew men became
dangerously ill and their illnesses
were rather unfairly charged to a sea
son of hard training and the Varsity
race, though a victory, was almost a
fiasco from the spectator's standpoint.
The crew men of that time, who lat
er formed themselves into the Boat
Club, admitted that things should not
be allowed to go on as they were that
season. They admitted that unless
the system could be changed, boating
should be abolished, but on the other
hand, they claim that the training sys
tem could be so revised that all the
objectionable features could be done
away with. Their plan was simply
that crew expenses be limited to a
certain amount for the season and that
a coaching committee of undergradu
ates take the place of the professional
coach, who was responsible for the
rigorous training of the past season.

The Executive Committee, however,
decided this plan was not feasible;
that expenses could not be kept down
and that undergraduate coaches would
prove incapable. Boating was conse
quently dropped.
In refutation of the Executive Com
mittee's stand at that time, we point
to last spring's rowing season. With
out receiving one cent from outside
sources, and with nothing but the bare
equipment to work with, the Boat Club
managed to put on the water a Fresh
man four and a Varsity eight, both of
which were able, with but little diffi
culty to show nothing but their rudder
posts to their California rivals for
their full courses. Further than this,
with the aid of a benefit dance, a crew
was sent to Washington, which in the
words of Connibear, the veteran coach
of that University, "Rowed better than
any Stanford crew he had ever seen."
At the end of the season, the Fresh
man and the Varsity men who rowed
agains California were granted their
respective emblems, by the Executive
Committee, a fact which shows that
that body realized Ihen that the crew
was rightfully a branch of intercol
legiate athletics.
This then is our case and what we
ask is this: Reestablish crew and let
it he run as it was last season with
out a professional coach. The students
of the University can by the expres
sion of their sentiments show the Ex
ecutive Committee that Stanford is
anxious to place rowing in the west in
the same high place that it occupies in
the east.

the management of rowing affairs had
drained the Student Body's treasury of
over $4,000. Two crew men became
dangerously ill and their illnesses
were rather unfairly charged to a sea
son of hard training and the Varsity
race, though a victory, was almost a
fiasco from the spectator's standpoint.
The crew men of that time, who lat
er formed themselves into the Boat
Club, admitted that things should not
be allowed to go on as they were that
season. They admitted that unless
the system could be changed, boating
should be abolished, but on the other
hand, they claim that the training sys
tem could be so revised that all the
objectionable features could be done
away with. Their plan was simply
that crew expenses be limited to a
certain amount for the season and that
a coaching committee of undergradu
ates take the place of the professional
coach, who was responsible for the
rigorous training of the past season.

The Executive Committee, however,
decided this plan was not feasible;
that expenses could not be kept down
and that undergraduate coaches would
prove incapable. Boating was conse
quently dropped.
In refutation of the Executive Com
mittee's stand at that time, we point
to last spring's rowing season. With
out receiving one cent from outside
sources, and with nothing but the bare
equipment to work with, the Boat Club
managed to put on the water a Fresh
man four and a Varsity eight, both of
which were able, with but little diffi
culty to show nothing but their rudder
posts to their California rivals for
their full courses. Further than this,
with the aid of a benefit dance, a crew
was sent to Washington, which in the
words of Connibear, the veteran coach
of that University, "Rowed better than
any Stanford crew he had ever seen."
At the end of the season, the Fresh
man and the Varsity men who rowed
agains California were granted their
respective emblems, by the Executive
Committee, a fact which shows that
that body realized Ihen that the crew
was rightfully a branch of intercol
legiate athletics.
This then is our case and what we
ask is this: Reestablish crew and let
it he run as it was last season with
out a professional coach. The students
of the University can by the expres
sion of their sentiments show the Ex
ecutive Committee that Stanford is
anxious to place rowing in the west in
the same high place that it occupies in
the east.
