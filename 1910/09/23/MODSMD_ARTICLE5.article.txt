# FRESHMEN HAVE NOT SUBSCRIBED
## Stanford Union Committee Reports That the Class of 1914 Have Not Added One Figure to Fund. 
### 
The Stanford Union, according to
the report of the Student Committee
in charge of the collecting of funds
for the Union, is still only a Union 011
paper. The funds are coming inâ€”
and from the three upperclasses they
are coming in well. Since the open
ing of the University, something over
one thousand dollars has been collect
ed by six men, collectors appointed by
the committee for that purpose. The
committee announces, however, that
the difficulty lies with the Freshmen.
In the month that the University has
been opened, not. one member of the
class of 1914 has subscribed to this
most vital fund.
This apparent lack of interest in the
affairs of the Union can only be at
tributed to a lack of knowledge.
Last year at the huge rally planned
for the benefit of the Union, almost
fifteen thousand dollars was sub
scribed for the Union in the space of
thirty minutes. Of the total sub
scribed, the class of 1913 signed up
for the sum of three thousand dollars.
This sum was third in the list out of
five classes. At this time, hold-overs,
who could derive no possible benefit

from the Union subscribed a total of
$1150. The Seniors, few of whom
would ever see the laying of the cor
nerstone of the club, let alone its
completion, subscribed almost $3000.
The Sophomores and the Class of 1911
brought their individual totals well
over three thousand dollars.
Last year, when it was announced
that a public meeting would be held to
collect funds tor the Union, the then
Freshman Class organized a Stanford
Union Club. The specific purpose of
this organization was to obtain money
for the Union. The Freshmen held a
class meeting, and formally launched
the new organization and showed such
enthusiasm that considerably over
five hundred dollars was subscribed
before the close of the class meeting.
This was two days before the big
rally. At the rally the class subscrib
ed $lisoo more. That was what the
Freshmen class of last year did for
tho Union.
That the Class of 1914 has hardly
lived up to this record is shown by
the report of the committee:
