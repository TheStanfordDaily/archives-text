Pictures of Gilbert and Sullivan's
comic opera "The Mikado," which is to
be presented by the Schubert Club
upon the evening of the Freshman In

prepared tomorrow for advertising
purposes. These depictions of various
scenes in the comic opera will be
placed upon posters and shown upon
the Quad during the coming week.
Rehearsals for the production have
been conducted under the direction of
Coach W. B. Bartlett of San Francisco,
who has reported that there is every
indication that a finished opera will be
secured from the material that he has
in the cast. Bartlett is very much
pleased with the results thus far ac
