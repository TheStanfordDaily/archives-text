In another column of this issue of
the Daily Palo Alto there appears a
communication from the Lagunita
Rowing Club, which is in substance a
plea for the support of rowing
and a request that that division
of athletics be taken from the po
sition it now holds and placed upon an
intercollegiate basis. The boat club
asks, in other words, that rowing be
given the same consideration from the
Executive Committee that football,
track and baseball receive. The mat
ter has not yet been placed before the
Executive Committee in an entirety
and this preliminary word from the
club is for the purpose of giving the
students at large an opportunity to
discuss and formulate some opinion
upon the subject. The position of the
organization in this request is very
clear. As they state in their com
munication, they wish to "reestablish
crew and let it be run as it was last
season, without a professional coach."
Boating last year was discontinued
as an intercollegiate sport on ac
count of the heavy expenses that the
Student Body had undergone and on
on account of a commendable spirit
of economy under which athletics
were conducted. The club has made
an enviable record in the management
of rowing during the past season, and
has showed the University that Stan
ford can hold honors with the best in
crew work upon the Pacific Coast.
Financially the organization ended
the season with a surplus and there
is no reason why, with a certain in
come, this cannot be accomplished
again. Rowing deserves to be placed
upon an intercollegiate basis undev

one condition, namely,—provided that
the Student Body treasury can war
rant an expenditure such as will be
necessary to subsidize boating. In
case the finances of the Associated
Students are in a sound position, there
is no reason why rowing should not
again come m the calendar of major
sports for which emblems shall be
granted.
