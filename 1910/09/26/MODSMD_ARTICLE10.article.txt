In the past, Junior classes have in
variably had difficulty with the ultimate
selection of their annual operas and in
many cases an eleventh hour produc
tion has been chosen as a make-shift.
This is a lamentable state of affairs,
especially when the use of a small
amount of foresight and preparation
would alleviate this condition. Prac
tically every Junior Opera Committee
has been appointed in preceeding years
during the second semester. After a
president of the class has been select
ed and the board picked, the semester
has well begun, and by the time a
score has been chosen, be it either pro
fessional or amateur, a month or pos
sibly six weeks only remains for the
actual selection of the cast and the
numerous rehearsals that accompany
such productions.
A .Junior Opera, written by a Stan
ford undergraduate, is the most de
sirable that could be obtained for this
event, provided that the work came up
to a certain presentable standard and
if sufficient time is allowed those who
are capable of writing such scores,
very creditable librettos can be
secured. This fact was proved last year,
when under the stress of conceiving
and writing an opera in the space
of two weeks, a fairly good showing
was made by those who essayed to
finish scores within that time. The
most interesting of all the operas
to the undergraduate are those written
by a student.
The Junior Class will meet tomor
row for regular business and if that
organization wishes to guarantee a
standard, local opera, a Junior Opera
Committee should be provided for at
that meeting. With an early start,
there should be no difficulty in obtain
ing a creditable score by local literary
ability and with the opera chosen,
every effort can be used toward com
pleting the actual work upon the pro
duction. This will insure a well fin
ished, complete, local opera, which

means a greater interest in the por
duction upon the part of the Student
Body.
