# ADAMS AND BONNELL TO TALK.
## Professors to Speak Before Nestoria and Euphronia Literary Societies Tomorrow Evening. 
### 
Members of the faculty will figure
largely in the programs of Euphronia
and Nestoria Literary societies to
morrow evening. Euphronia will be
favored with an interesting talk by
Professor J. A. Boni\ell, of the Depart
ment of English, while Nestoria will
listen to Professor E. D. Adams' justly
famous address, "Twentieth Century
Ideals." Professor Adams, who is at
the head of the Department of History,
gave this same lecture last year before
his class in American History and cre
ated a very profound impression.
Euphronia and Nestoria both meet
at 7:30 o'clock, the former in room
231 and the latter in room 214. The
programs of both societies are always
open to the public.
