# CARDINAL RUGBY PLAYERS DEFEAT VISITING TEAMS
## 
### 
The Varsity had little difficulty in
putting the Barbarians out of the run
ning on the turf Saturday with a 21-0
score. The Freshmen were lucky in
coming off the field with a victory over
St. Mary's, 3-0. In the bigger contest,
the Barbarians were strong on de
fense, which accounts for the compar
ative smallness of the score. Al
though the pigskin was in (heir own
portion of the field for the greater
part of the time, yet they repulsed the
efforts of the Cardinal team to pile up
a larger score. Kern's try, with the
first half nearly gone, was the opening
tally and the most spectacular one of
the game. With the leather on the
Barbarian's 15, Brown, by a free-kick,
booted cross-field into what should
have been Lumbard's hands. Kern,
however, coming like a meteor, leaped
through the air, caught the ball out of
the San Franciscan's arms, and with
no opposition from the dazed Barbar
ians, ran the ten yards to a try, touch
ing the leather down fairly between
the posts. Brown's conversion here
made the score a 5-0 advantage for the
Varsity.
Kern was easily the star of the con
test. His second try of the first period
was also a pretty one. Receiving a
pass directly from Erb at half on the
Barbarians' 10, he dove almost a half
of the remaining distance through the
visitor's tacklers, and made the total
8-0. Brown's failure to convert left
this the total for the end of the first
twenty-five minutes.
Dole's work in the pack was good,
as was Erb's, while at half. He was
shifted to the three-quarter line to
wards the end of the game and did
not do so well, being of course strange
to the position and not having the op
portunities for service offered in the
rear-scrum place. S. Mitchell came
back to more near his old time form
in the last few minutes of play. His
play was ordinary in the first part of
the game. Brown's kicking was a
marvel. An amazing amount of ter
ritory was covered whenever he got
the leather into his hands.
Individual work brought most of the
scores. Thoburn, from a line-out on
the Barbs' 25, secured and tore diagon
ally across the field for a try, which S.
Mitchell easily converted. Kern came
into view again for the fourth try.
Erb's pass from a scrum gave him the
ball on the visitors' 15, and he went

over unaided. The last five points
were added when Cass, who had re
placed Erb at half, passed to S. Mit
chell from a five-yard scrum. Mitchell
lunged across with ease. Brown con
verted a hard goal. Final score, 21-0.
The Freshmen missed to a large ex
tent the services of Geissler, but his
absence was made up somewhat by the
brilliant play of Reeves, first five,
whose following up and passing was
of a high grade. Diavole, Starrett,
and Leonhardt were the shining lights
of the St. Mary's line-up, and their
ability was most responsible for hold
ing back the Cardinal team.
The only score c.f the baby game
was made toward the end of the first
period. Reaves, Harrigan and Brown
were the participants in the rush that
brought a tally. Darsie failed to con
vert, and the tally list remained 3-0
Manzanita Hall and the Second
Freshmen played a woefully loose
game previous to the later two con
tests, the Freshmen winning, 5-0.
