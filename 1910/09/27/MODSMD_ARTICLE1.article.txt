## FRESHMEN AND PALO ALTO MEET SECOND TIME.

Preparatory Team Pefc d 11-8 One
Week Ago.—Few (images in
15)14 Line-up.
After a week's practice, the Fresh
men will again meet Palo Alto High
School on the turf. The second battle
between the two fifteens is scheduled
for tomorrow afternoon at 4:45. The
Stanford baby team defeated the pre
paratory players a week ago with a
11-3 score and the game was a fast
one. What seven days of practice, and
the stiff contest with the Sophomores
yesterday will do for the first-year
Cardinal men, is to develop tomorrow.
The pack will be the same that heeled
the ball out for the Freshmen yester
day. The backs are considerably
changed as far as the actual make-up
is concerned; that is, there are no
shifting of positions, llall goes in for
Weber at wing and Roberts replaces
Standish at center three-quarters.
Roberts showed many signs of ability
against 1913 Monday, and tomorrow
will lie a good chance for him to bring
out what rugby knowledge he has.
The Palo Altans include in their line
up the two clever Rislings, who, it is
said, are planning to enter Stanford in
a year or so, and McGilvary, the ag
gressive forward.
The line-ups have been stated as
follows:
Freshmen —Brown, Barman, Clover,
Olmstead, Watkins, Mitchell, lion 1-
ware, forwards; Darsie, wing for
ward; Tilton, half; Reeves, Harrigan,
fives; Roberts, center; Hall, Geissler,
wings; Kauffman, full.
Palo Alto —McGilvary, Soper, Du
bentorf, Mills, Clark, Gladstone, Ram
sey, Lockwood, forwards; Davidson,
wing forward; D. E. Croft', half; D.
Risling, E. Risling, fives; Howe, cen
ter; Templeton, Dingley, wings;
Hutchinson, full.
ClmiiipioKsliIp Decided Monday.
Coach Presley has chosen next Mon
day fcr the date of the Senior-Sopho
more struggle for the interclars rugby
championship of the university. 1911
and 1913, having each defeated their
opponents in the preliminary games,
will be matched next week. Odds on
the contest have not been announced
yet, but, from the nature of the class
game yesterday on Stanford Field,
there should be excitement and inter
est to spare at the annual set-to of the
two winners of the opening inter
class matches.
