According to a report submitted by
Student Body Manager D. W. Burbank,
a very poor showing has been made in
the sale of season tickets. There is
an apparent unwillingness upon the
part of the students to assist the treas
ury of the Student Body and a seeming
attitude of indifference with respect to
the success of the season from a finan
cial viewpoint. But even if this spirit
is lacking, the purchase of tickets
should be greater. Looked at from a
selfish standpoint, every purchaser
gains financially by securing this ad
mission to all games throughout the
season. If the effort to create more
interest in the games cannot be
secured by a spirit of cooperation with
the business manager, the sale of
tickets should be increased solely on
account of the special financial ad
vantages that are offered.
