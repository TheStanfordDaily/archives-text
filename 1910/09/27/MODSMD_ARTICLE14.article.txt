# WILL ENTERTAIN THEMSELVES.
## 1910 Men Will Hold Banquet and Jolly-up in the Near Future. 
### 
With the feeling that some manner
of entertainment should be enjoyed by
the remaining male members of the
1910 class, it was decided this after
noon, at a meeting of that body, that
a "jolly-up" in the foothills, and a
banquet in the city the evening of the
big game should be prepared for and
consequently, a committee consisting
of H. C. Nelson, R. W. Roberts and 11.
W. Utter was appointed to take charge
of the arrangements. These men
were selected by J. D. Houser, Per
manent Secretary of the class, who
presided at the meeting. This com
mittee will investigate at once in re
gard to the cost of the banquet and
jolly-up, and also in respect to the
most convenient place for such oc
casions.
The object of having a banquet in
San Francisco is due to the fact that
there are a large number of 1910 men
in business there, and it is also ex
pected that a large 1910 delegation
from the north and south will arrive
in San Francisco that evening. The
jolly-up in the foot-hills will be com
posed largely of the men now in col
lege.
At both occasions an informal pro
gram will be presented, and a large
number will be asked to speak, and
entertain in any way they find most
feasible.
