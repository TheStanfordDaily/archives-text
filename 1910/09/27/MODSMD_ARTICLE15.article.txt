# Work Started on Church.
## 
### 
A force of men has been engaged for
the past few (lays in arranging the
piles of broken stone and mosaic work
around the ruins of the Memorial
Church. While nothing can be learned
regarding the plans for reconstruction,
it is thought that this work indicates
an early resumption of active con
struction upon the new church.
