# Fire Averted in Roble.
## 
### 
A fire that might have developed
into a serious blaze was discovered in
the Roble basement this noon. The
packing on one of the steam pipes
caught fire, but the blaze was extin
guished before it had gained enough
headway to ignite the adjoining wood
work. The conflagration caused no
excitement and practically no damage
resulted.
