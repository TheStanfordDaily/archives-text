### 
Chairman H. Rittlgstein, '10, of the
Bleacher Stunt Committee announced
late this afternoon that the sale of
tickets on the Quad for the Bleacher
Stunt Dance of October 8, has been
unusually encouraging. The students
have appreciated both the object of the
dance and a brisk sale has been ex
perienced. The remaining tickets may
be procured at the Bookstore, or from
the members of the committee, H. Rit
tigstein, '10, R. W. Woodville, '11, and
F. B. Beman, '12. The programs for
dance will be distributed next Wednes
day, the committee having promised
something unique in store for the pat
rons of the dance. They are the re
sult of an art competition, in which thq
prize was awarded to A. T. King, '12.
His design is said to be something es
pecially successful along a humorous
line. In order to aid in the movement
for elaborate bleacher stunts at the
California game the Bismarck Cafe at
San Francisco have donated the pro
grams, while the tickets are the gift of
the University Bookstore. If their sale
continues as it has begun the financial
success of the dance will lie assured.
