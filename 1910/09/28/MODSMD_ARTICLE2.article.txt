# English Club Has Plans.
## 
### 
A new departure in Stanford dra
matics is marked in the decision of the
English Club to give a matinee per
formance of one of the old English
Miracle Players or Chester Mysteries,
on February 4. Definite plans will be
announced later, but an elaborate pro
duction is in prospect, to be an exact
reproduction of the play as given by
one at the Craft Guilds in the fifteenth
century. Professor Bassett will coach
the cast.
