Professor E. D. Adams' lecture upon
"Twentieth Century Ideals," as deliv
ered before the Nestoria Literary So
ciety yesterday evening, was well re
ceived by the large audience present.
His tracing of the growth of American
ideals of government from the early
days of the republic and his summary
of the significance of the present polit
ical, religious and social unrest was
of more than ordinary interest to those
who crowded room 214. He declared
that the present decade was one of
spiritual research and social analysis
and taht our present apparent disre
spect for our oldest institutions and
forms was only an indication of moral
advance and general spiritual awaken
ing. "We are groping after a new ideal
of man. We do not know as yet what
this idea is, but we are actuated by the
conscious ideal that we need an ideal."
Further he said in part:
"The present emphasis of progres
sive men is not upon the relation of
the state to individuals, but of the
state to society. We are emphasizing
personal duty rather than personal
right. The cry of our leaders for a
better order of things is a spiritual cry
and we have stopped worshiping the
Constitution and our older principles,
because we wish to grow. The keynote
of the age is the possibility of a change
for a better state of society. The fear
of corporations, the cry against the
tariff, the growth of the present insur
gent movement, whether or not things
wise in themselves, are indications of
this seeking for a new ideal. The
lack of respect we show for the prac
titioners of law is accountable for the
fact that this profession stands for a
satisfaction with present conditions.
Democracy is now looked on as a tool
to secure better ends.
"The decay of religious emotion is
not an indication of moral decay, but
rather of the growth of a higher and
more emphatic regard for every day
honesty and of the duty of man to
man."
The year 1815 saw the permanent
change from continental to American
ideals. 1830 saw our complete divorce
from the aristocracy of state craft and
the victory of the new democracy
under which the government was con
trolled by the ordinary everyday man.
By 1840 we had advanced so far Avest,
had acquired so much wealth and were
absorbed so by our own interests that
we not only did not rely upon the Old
World for any ideas, but had ceased to
think about them at all. The Abolition
Movement marks the great spiritual
advance of this time, but the primary
concern of all peoples was expansion
and growth. ISGO to 1880 was a period
of rapid expansion and growth and
also marked the death of state patriot
ism. With the strengthening of the,
national ideal then, since 1880 we have
had a period of constant moral and
spiritual unrest and a search for a
new ideal of life.
