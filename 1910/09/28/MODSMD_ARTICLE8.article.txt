# OFFERS MONEY PRIZE
## 1912 WILL GIVE TWENTY-FIVE DOLLARS FOR FARCE. Junior Class Endeavors to Revive Old Plug Ugly Traditions.â€”Competition Open to All. 
### 
Twenty-five dollars will be given to
the author of the best farce submitted
to the Plug Ugly committee. With the
purpose of producing a clean burlesque
full cf rich humor and free from ob
jectionable features, in short, a farce
worthy of the talent which the Univer
sity possesses, the offer has been made
by the Junior class. Several years ago
the annual upper-class rushes were
prefaced with clever skits, in which
seniors and hold-overs were good nat
uredly chaffed. Within the past few
years, however, the farce has degen
erated into a mere pantomine, which
has seldom been completely enacted.
The farce must be of two acts, cap
able of being produced in from thirty
to forty-five minutes. The authors will
be allowed three weeks time in which
to complete their manuscripts, at the
end of which time the prize will be
awarded to the best composition sub
mitted, if it comes up to the standard
set by the committee. All Stanford
students are eligible to enter the con
test, which will not be restricted to
Juniors. One of tjie few conditions
imposed is, that all manuscripts turned
in will be completely at the disposal of
the Junior committee, which reserves
to itself the power of adapting to the
farce chosen any part of any manu
script entered in the competition.
