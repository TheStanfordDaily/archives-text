# GRAYS PLAY BLACKS
## FIRST AND SECOND TEAMS MEET THIS AFERNOON. Varsity Will Play Olympics and Freshmen Will Encounter Mission High Saturday. 
### 
The Freshman squad had no prac
tice this afternoon, and were given a
complete rest, owing to the fact that
this week hus called for three hard
set-tos on the turf, the Sophomore
contest 011 Monday, Palo Alto yester
day and the Mission High engagement
set for next Saturday in the usual
double-header with the Varsity, the
bigger Cardinal team playing the
Olympic Club again. Coach Presley
gives all his time this afternoon to tlia
Varsity, and they have a chance to
show in a shori. scrummage how much
rugby they have learned during the
past week. The Grays and Blacks, the
first and second teams respectively,
fought out two halves of practice
work. The big team's routine yester
day brought out as much rugby, per
haps, as has been gone through with
by the men since the season opened
and the fifteen is rapidly taking shape.
The Varsity has six games on its
schedule before the California cham
pionship, including the Olymic match
Saturday. The only off-campus trip
will come in three weeks and will con
sist of the Reno pilgrimage. Manager
Burbank may be able to bring the
Olympics to the campus on the morn
ing of the Freshman intercollegiate
game, and this will give the Varsity
seven preparatory games and more
leeway. The Freshmen have but three
dates left 011 their schedule before
meeting California two weeks from
Saturday.
