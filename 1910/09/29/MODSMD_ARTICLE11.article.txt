Some of the merchants in Palo Alto
have lately been keeping in stock
watch fobs which are exact counter
parts of a block "S." Upon inquiry, it
was discovered that students had ac
tually purchased these emblems and
are wearing them, regardless of the
fact that they are not entitled to the
privilege of doing the same. The
more respected and exclusive the Var
sity emblem is made, the more honor
is obtained by those who can win it in
the althletic fields. If these above
mentioned fobs are purchased, the
block letter becomes common property
without signifying all that it now
means and stands for. This unauthor
ized sale of our official University em
blem, which is granted for certain
achievements, should be discouraged
and if possible stopped entirely. The
students cannot prohibit the manufac
ture of the fobs, but they can make the
selling of them an unprofitable busi
ness.
