the contest are requested to hand in
their names to the committee in

pecially to the Sophomores. The
Freshmen are requested to meet to
morrow in the Chapel at 1:15 and
there have the nature of the tryovts

by former Varsity debaters. There
they will undoubtedly be divided into
squads, assigned questions and sides,
for the preliminary contest.
In last year's debate, the Freshmen
won for the first time in many years.
All three members of this victorious
team are again registered in college
