# TO FORM NEW LEAGUE
## OREGON, WASHINGTON AND STANFORD WILL DEBATE. Executive Committee Indorses New Plan.â€”Assent of Washington Is Awaited. 
### 
By the action of the Executive Com
mittee last night in agreeing to ad
vance $150 a year as traveling expen
ses to Varsity debaters, there will un
doubtedly be formed the Pacific Coast
Debating League, with Stanford, the
University of Oregon and the Univer
sity of Washington as members. If
the plan which Stanford favors for the
widening or the forensic horizon on
the West Coast is looked on with favor
by the northern institutions, these
three colleges will meet together for
the first time on the rostrum, and to
gether should form a permanent
league. Oregon has already heartily
assented to the plan and word is
awaited from Washington.
Both of the local debating societies,
Nestoria and Euphronia have indorsed
the idea and through their Inter
society Committee have brought the
matter before the Executive Com
mittee. The matter was first broached
before Nestoria by F. H. Hilton, '11,
who has been in correspondence with
W. C. Huntington, manager of Oratory
and Debate at Oregon, for some time
past.
The formation of the league has
been made a possibility by the with
drawal of the University of Idaho from
the league that was originally com
posed of that institution and colleges
in the two coast states. It is thought
that the new league will be an im
provement over the other, as it will be
a strictly coast league and will show
the work done by the western univer
sities. It will aid Stanford especially
in developing good teams to meet the
Blue and Gold, and in raising the
standard of forensic work here gen
erally. With the underclass debates,
the Edward Berwick, Jr., Peace Prize
Contest, the Bonnheim Dissertation,
the Carnot and Intercollegiate debates
with California and two debates a year
with Oregon and Washington, the pub
lic speakers on the campus are antici
pating busy seasons.
