# St. Mary's Whip California Babies.

### 
The Blue and Gold Freshmen were
beaten by St. Mary's fifteen yesterday
afternoon by a score of 8-0. But for
the timely tackling of the first year
men, a higher score would have been
recorded and was their only redeem
ing feature.
The St. Mary's men played the game
for all it was worth and when one of
their men was tackled another was
generally in the right place to receive
the pass.
St. Mary's line-up yesterday was
practically the same as that which the
Stanford babies, minus Geissler, de
feated last Saturday by a score of 3-0.
"We'll Win From California or Die"
is the name of a new song of the Uni
versity of Nevada's rooters.
