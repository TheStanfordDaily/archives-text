# THREE TEAMS WILL BE IN ACTION
## First and Second Freshmen Meet Berkeley High and Mission High Schools.—The Varsity Will Play Olympics. 
### 
Roth Freshman teams will be in ac
tion tomorrow afternoon on the turf,
and the Varsity will have its usual
Saturday game. The First and Second
Freshmen are to meet Berkeley High
and Mission High schools, respective
ly, at 1:45 and 3:00. The Varsity and
the Olympic Club players will be en
gaged at 4:00. Mission High School
should he a respectable opponent for
the substitute baby team, and it is for
that reason probably that the Berkeley
fifteen was dated to play the Fresh
men, in order that they might have a
good, stiff, contest. The preparatory
fighters from across the Lay have al
ready defeated the California first-ye.tr
team, by the score of S-3, and they in
clude in their line-up some star men,
Austin and Forbes being two battlers
who have a knack of rushing the ball
single-handed. The Freshmen who
will oppose them are the same that
have held the ball in the opening line
ups during Ihe past week. Roberts
holds the center three-quarter position.
Horton is still absent from the Var
sity line, by reason of his injury.
Frank and Arrell have front rank re
sponsibility. The other forwards are
not changed. Sundell returns to the
wing position after being out of the
game for a week, the Freshman Geiss
ler having had his place against, the
Barbarians last Saturday. With the
Varsity line-up unchanged and with
evidence of improvement such as the
big Cardinals have shown in practice,
the past four or five days, the Varsity
should do better than the 14-0 score
made against the Olympics two weeks
ago. Practice yesterday afternoon,
was not as satisfactory as desired, but
that fact, should not indicate much,
since practice work does not run in

consistent improvement day in and day
cut.
The Olympics will probably fill in
their line-up with several local play
ers, and the line-up given below is an
indefinite one. Molfino, Captain Hick
ey, Laumeister and (ioodell are Stan
ford men who will be here. Dolan, a
University of Nevada forward, now in
college 1 at ineligible by the transfer
rule, will also probably play with them
tomorrow.
Admission to the three games will
be th 3 usual Saturday price of 50
cent.'.

forward; Erb, half; Thoburn, Mitch

Olympics—Molfino, Trow
bridge, Reynolds, Dolan, Aguirre,
Haley, forwards; Skov, wing forward;
Parker, half; Mackenzie, Laumeister,
fives; Webster, center; Roth, Lunt,
wings; Goodell, full.
Freshmen—• R. Brown, Barman,
Clover, Olmstead, Watkins, Mitchell,

Tilton, half; Reeves, Harrigan, fives;
Roberts, center; Hall, Geissler, wings;
Kauffman, full.
Berkeley High—Crane, Doyle, How
ard, Hardy, Brown, Vilas, Baronidas,
forwards; Hunt, wing forward; Cor

Roth Freshman teams will be in ac
tion tomorrow afternoon on the turf,
and the Varsity will have its usual
Saturday game. The First and Second
Freshmen are to meet Berkeley High
and Mission High schools, respective
ly, at 1:45 and 3:00. The Varsity and
the Olympic Club players will be en
gaged at 4:00. Mission High School
should he a respectable opponent for
the substitute baby team, and it is for
that reason probably that the Berkeley
fifteen was dated to play the Fresh
men, in order that they might have a
good, stiff, contest. The preparatory
fighters from across the Lay have al
ready defeated the California first-ye.tr
team, by the score of S-3, and they in
clude in their line-up some star men,
Austin and Forbes being two battlers
who have a knack of rushing the ball
single-handed. The Freshmen who
will oppose them are the same that
have held the ball in the opening line
ups during Ihe past week. Roberts
holds the center three-quarter position.
Horton is still absent from the Var
sity line, by reason of his injury.
Frank and Arrell have front rank re
sponsibility. The other forwards are
not changed. Sundell returns to the
wing position after being out of the
game for a week, the Freshman Geiss
ler having had his place against, the
Barbarians last Saturday. With the
Varsity line-up unchanged and with
evidence of improvement such as the
big Cardinals have shown in practice,
the past four or five days, the Varsity
should do better than the 14-0 score
made against the Olympics two weeks
ago. Practice yesterday afternoon,
was not as satisfactory as desired, but
that fact, should not indicate much,
since practice work does not run in

consistent improvement day in and day
cut.
The Olympics will probably fill in
their line-up with several local play
ers, and the line-up given below is an
indefinite one. Molfino, Captain Hick
ey, Laumeister and (ioodell are Stan
ford men who will be here. Dolan, a
University of Nevada forward, now in
college 1 at ineligible by the transfer
rule, will also probably play with them
tomorrow.
Admission to the three games will
be th 3 usual Saturday price of 50
cent.'.
