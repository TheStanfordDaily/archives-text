# SERVICES ARE HELD IN CHAPEL
## University Chapel is Scene of Impressive Ceremonies in Honor of Beloved Member of the Faculty. 
### 
Services, beautiful in their sincerity,'
their reverence and their respect for
the memory of the late beloved Pro
fessor John Ernst Matzke, of the De
partment of Romanic Languages, were
held in the University Chapel yester
day evening. The house of worship
was well filled by the numerous
friends, pupils, and faculty associates
of the deceased, who gathered for the
last time to pay loving tribute in song,
prayer, and address, to his memory.
The services were simple, but most
impressive and every speaker spoke
his great love for the departed Pro
fessor, and his sincere sympathy for
those dear ones who feel most keenly
the loss of father, husband and friend.
The services were conducted by the
Reverend D. Charles Gardner and ad
dresses were made by acting Presi
dent .). C. Branner, Professor H. W.
Clapp of the University of California
and Professor E. Fliigel of the Depart
ment of English Philology, all of
whom were most intimately associated
with Dr. Matzke during the entire
period of his Professorship here. The
tributes payed by these scholorly
friends were most beautiful and im
pressive and spoke eloquently of the
great worth and strength of the late
head of the Romanic Languages de
partment, both as a man and as a
scholar. "If pleasure can be men
tioned in the same breath with our
grief, it must be a pleasure to us to
remember that our friend died in the
prime of life, in the midst of his schol
arly activities and in the full enjoy
ment. of all that was going on about
him," said Dr. Branner in closing his
eulogy.
In opening his address, the acting
President read several of the last let

ters written by Professor Matzke to
his wife. In ail of these he spoke of
the enjoyable time he was having in
Mexico and of his excellent health.
In fact, the concluding words of the
final letter were: "I am feeling fine
ly." Dean T. F. Crane of Cornell, who
was with Dr. Matzke when he breathed
his last, wrote to Mrs. Matzke, "He
died in the service of his University,
as much as had he been a soldier
killed in battle."
Professor Clapp, who has been close
ly associated with Dr. Matzke in the
American Philological Association for
many years, spoke feelingly of their
long companionship in philological re
search and of how during all this time,
the recognition which came to the
Stanford professor was entirely un
sought for."He was first and fore
most a scholar. As a University man,
he kept the ideals of the higher educa
tion alwas in view. Sincerity was the
keynote of his character, and his
modesty was the modesty of a strong
man, confident of his own powers, gen
uine in his ideals and in his friend
ships."
"it was natural for Dr. Matzke not
to think of himself. He was unselfish
in every matter," said Porfessor
Fliigel, in paying final tribute to his
friend. "His was a perfect life, a short
one in truth, but a complete and a
happy one. Let us be happy that we
knew him in his work and had seven
teen years of companionship with him."
The funeral services werf* held this
morning at 11 o'clock at the family
residence in Palo Alto. The interment
took place at the Cypress Lawn Ceme
tary where the final rites were con
ducted in the cemetary chapel by the
Reverend D. Charles Gardner.

The services were conducted by the
Reverend D. Charles Gardner and ad
dresses were made by acting Presi
dent .). C. Branner, Professor H. W.
Clapp of the University of California
and Professor E. Fliigel of the Depart
ment of English Philology, all of
whom were most intimately associated
with Dr. Matzke during the entire
period of his Professorship here. The
tributes payed by these scholorly
friends were most beautiful and im
pressive and spoke eloquently of the
great worth and strength of the late
head of the Romanic Languages de
partment, both as a man and as a
scholar. "If pleasure can be men
tioned in the same breath with our
grief, it must be a pleasure to us to
remember that our friend died in the
prime of life, in the midst of his schol
arly activities and in the full enjoy
ment. of all that was going on about
him," said Dr. Branner in closing his
eulogy.
In opening his address, the acting
President read several of the last let

ters written by Professor Matzke to
his wife. In ail of these he spoke of
the enjoyable time he was having in
Mexico and of his excellent health.
In fact, the concluding words of the
final letter were: "I am feeling fine
ly." Dean T. F. Crane of Cornell, who
was with Dr. Matzke when he breathed
his last, wrote to Mrs. Matzke, "He
died in the service of his University,
as much as had he been a soldier
killed in battle."
Professor Clapp, who has been close
ly associated with Dr. Matzke in the
American Philological Association for
many years, spoke feelingly of their
long companionship in philological re
search and of how during all this time,
the recognition which came to the
Stanford professor was entirely un
sought for."He was first and fore
most a scholar. As a University man,
he kept the ideals of the higher educa
tion alwas in view. Sincerity was the
keynote of his character, and his
modesty was the modesty of a strong
man, confident of his own powers, gen
uine in his ideals and in his friend
ships."
"it was natural for Dr. Matzke not
to think of himself. He was unselfish
in every matter," said Porfessor
Fliigel, in paying final tribute to his
friend. "His was a perfect life, a short
one in truth, but a complete and a
happy one. Let us be happy that we
knew him in his work and had seven
teen years of companionship with him."
The funeral services werf* held this
morning at 11 o'clock at the family
residence in Palo Alto. The interment
took place at the Cypress Lawn Ceme
tary where the final rites were con
ducted in the cemetary chapel by the
Reverend D. Charles Gardner.
Services, beautiful in their sincerity,'
their reverence and their respect for
the memory of the late beloved Pro
fessor John Ernst Matzke, of the De
partment of Romanic Languages, were
held in the University Chapel yester
day evening. The house of worship
was well filled by the numerous
friends, pupils, and faculty associates
of the deceased, who gathered for the
last time to pay loving tribute in song,
prayer, and address, to his memory.
The services were simple, but most
impressive and every speaker spoke
his great love for the departed Pro
fessor, and his sincere sympathy for
those dear ones who feel most keenly
the loss of father, husband and friend.
