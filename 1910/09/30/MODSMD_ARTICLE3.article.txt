# HAND SHOWS IMPROVEMENT.
## Forty-two Musicians Now Playing as Regular Members.â€” Will be Heard Tomorrow. 
### 
Daring the past two weeks marked
progress has been made in the devel
opment of ihe newly organized Uni
versity Band. There are now forty
two men with instruments assigned
them taking part, in the rehearsals
held twice a week, and from the earn
estness shown upon the part of these
men, the coach and leader have reason
to feel greatly encouraged over the
outlook.
The Band feels deeply indebted to
the Student Body for their support and
financial aid, and they will try by cur
tailing their expenditures in every
way possible to show in a way the'r
appreciation of that assistance. Most
of the smaller instruments are now
owned by the individual players. The
Student Body, therefore, will only
have the expense of additional uni
forms for the new men, and such sup
plies as are absolutely necessary. Next
Saturday the students will have an op
portunity to hear the hand at the foot
tall game. This will be their first
appearance and they will endeavor to
appear often upon subsequent occa
sions of the same character.
