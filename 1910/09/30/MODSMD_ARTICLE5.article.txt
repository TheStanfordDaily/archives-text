# ENGLISH CLUB IS ACTIVE.
## Miracle Plays, Open Meetings, Year Book and Other Activities are Projected. 
### 
The English Club is planning for a
year of unusual activity, which will
include the revival of three miracle
plays, the holding of several open
meetings, and much activity generally.
One of the problems now before the
club is the issuance of a second vol
ume of the Year Hook, the biennial col
lection of short stories, essays and
poems, selected from the cream of the
literary work of the year. The first
volume, published two years ago, has
had a good sale in spite of the very
large edition which was ordered. Al
most every copy has been sold, only a
few remaining on hand at the Hook
store and Hyde's in Palo Alto. Fresh
men or those upper classmen who have
failed as yet to provide themselves
with copies of the book, will do well to
secure a volume at their earliest con
venience.
Last year the English Club published
a reprint of the "First Year at Stan
ford," originally printed by the club in
1904. Proof of the popularity of this
book is given by the fact that the
second edition is now practically ex
hausted.
