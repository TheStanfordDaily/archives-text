With the selection of a full comple
ment of yell leaders, it is to be hoped
that the bleachers will show the effect.
Yesterday there were approximately
twenty-five men who watched the
practice of the rugby squad out of a
Student Body that contains one thou
sand. An excellent exhibition is
scheduled for tomorrow, —the band
will make its first appearance and the
three yell leaders will appear for the
first time in an official capacity. This
combination offers a strong enough
inducement for a record breaking at
tendance, even for a Saturday game.
The Student Body cannot afford to
allow the men upon the field to do all
the fighting and give all the sacrifice.
They must be supported and there is
only one way in which that can be
done by those who do not play rugby,
—namely, by giving their support
from (he bleachers. With these added
inducements, we look for a record in
gate receipts tomorrow.
