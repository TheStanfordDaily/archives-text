# DECIDE CHAMPIONSHIP
## FINAL GAME GIVES SERIES TO SOPHOMORES. Second Year Men Defeat Seniors by Score of 6-3 in Stubborn Game. 
### 
With the exception of two minutes,
the Sophomores kept the leather In
Senior territory during the whole
twenty minutes of the first half. Then
persistent efforts brought one try,
with no conversion, soon after the
period. Although they were able to
advance at almost any stage of the
contest, yet penalties and Jordan's
good full-kicking saved more than a
three-point score in the opening per
iod.
Captain Woodcock was principal
actor for 1911 and directed his men lo
good advantage. Bly and Fyfe were
firm as rocks on defense and nailed
practically every pass from half to
the fives.
Throughout the entire game, the two
fifteens were fighting hard, the Seniors
remaining upon the defensive the
greater part of the time. 1911 was
hard pressed during the first half, but
in the second period there were mo
ments when the fourth year men
could almost see a score chalked to
their credit. Star plays upon both
teams were in evidence throughout
the two halves.
First Half.
Hard fighting by Sophomores car
ries ball with a rush down near Sen
ior's line, where for the first 10 min

kick to touch at 10. Baumgartner
secures l all for first try, Fyfe failing
to convert. Game then seesawed from

score, but Sophomores effectively

gressive fighting drive 1911 back.

mores, 3; Seniors, 0.
