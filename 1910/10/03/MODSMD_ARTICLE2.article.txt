Second Fresh men, 0; .Mission Iligh,
Four hours of rugby last Saturday
on Stanford Field brought enough ex
citement to keep twelve hundred par
sons watching the play on the green
turf during all three games played.
Interest was kept up to the last min
ute of the four hours, and the periods
of waiting were enlivened by the new
forty-piece Stanford Band. The Var
sity's two halves were decidedly un
equal. Sixteen points were hung up
'n the opening session, while only
three found their way to the total in
the closing period, a half of thirty
minutes duration. The inequality of
the scoring powers of the team before
and after the interval may come from
Coach Presley's having changed six
out of the eight positions in the scrum,
weakening the pack. The pack men
had been the mainstay of the fifteen
and the withdrawal of some of them
showed its effect to a marked degree.
The backs, Brb and Brown, at half,
and full, excepted, were off their usual
running. Their action was groggy,
and none of them came up to their pos
sibilities. Cheda and Woodcock re
vived the lost art of dribbling, little
of which has been seen this year, and
their work in general showed level
headedness. Cheda tallied the first and
last try made, while Woodcock took
honors for another. Sharpe's long,
unexpected runs, and Roth's defensive
work, made them stand out as test
among the Olympics.
Tries were made rapidly in the first
half. Cheda dribbled from the 25,
caught up and went over as a begin
ner. Brown did not convert. Brown's
goal from the Olympic 30 added six
more. 11-0 was totalled when Wood
cock secured near the line and leaped
across for a try which Brown con
verted. Out of a ruck on the Olympic
?0 again Kern secured and went over,
Brown converting. First half, lfi-0.
I]rb, Thoburn, and Mitchell brought
the leather to the Olympic 10. Cheda
took possession from a ruck there aftar
j Mitchell h;ul kicked, and scored the
last try. Brown's failure to get the
goal left the total, 1S-0.
First Freshmen-Berkeley High.
The Freshmen worked their hardest
to bring the mighty reputation of Ber
| keley High School to earth. They suc
ceeded, but their victory was somewhat,
overshadowed by reason of the visi
tors' crippled line-up. Knowles, Vilas
and Forbes, three strong backs, could
net bear the Berkeley colors Saturday
because of injuries and their absence
loosened several links in the school

team's chain of fighters. The Cardinal
players, on the other hand, were also
minus two dependable men, Olmstead
and Boulware, of the pack.
Harrigan's lightening runs, Geiss
ler's cross-kicking to touch, to accom
plish which he twisted himself in as
tonishing ways, and Captain Hunt's
long-range spirals proved to be the
star work on the field.
A try was brought out of each half.
The first came when Reeves at the Ber
keley 20 passed to Clover, who tallied
easily, and with surprisingly little op
position. Darsie's conversion made tha
score, 5-0.
Again, towards the middle of the
second twenty-five minute period
Reeve 3, Clover and Geissler executed
a passing rush that ended in a try,
Geissler setting the ball squarely be
tween the uprights by a quick run
after going across the line. Darsie
added two points by the easy goal re
sulting. Final score, 10-0.
Freshman (J, Mission High 5.
The curtain raiser to the rugby mat
inee on Saturday between the Second
Freshman and the Mission High was
a game with little or no team work.
Stafford, the little Mission five,
played practically the whole game for
his side, scoring their only conversion,
and kept the Cardinal from running
up a higher score by his timely boots
to touch.
Blase and Murray made the tries for
the Freshmen, Powell failing to con
vert in each instance. Burns was
quick in following up and Green made
a couple of difficult boots to touch at
crucial moments.
