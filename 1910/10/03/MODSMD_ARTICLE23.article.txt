# COTILLION PLANS DISCUSSED.
## Sophomore Committee Decides to Limit the Sale of ickets to 175. 
### 
That the number of tickets to be
issued for the Sophomore Cotillion
this year should be limited to 175, has
been the decision of the committee in
charge of this function. This is ap
proximately the number in attendance
at the cotillion of last year, at which
time the floor at Encina Hall was
taxed to its full capacity.
Elaborate plans for decorations
were brought up and discussed, but
none of the new ideas suggested will
be known until December 3, the night
of the dance. The committee aims to
introduce many features throughout
the dance which will be entirely new
upon the campus.
The number of dances has not as
yet been decided upon, but the custom
of having fourteen will probably be
adhered to. The usual price of $2.50
will be charged for admittances, but
the tickets will not go on sale until
some time in the middle of Nevember.
The committee requests that both
carriages and flowers be omitted fit
this affair as has been the custom in
the past.
