### 
Definite arrangements have been
made by the English Club for the re
production of three mystery plays on
the night of February 4. This will be
the first presentation of these plays
in the United States. They are to be
given with historical accuracy of ac
tion and costuming.
The plays were first given in the
Middle Ages by the craft guilds, whose
members used wagons for their
stages.
The mysteries to be given here next
semester are based upon the Chester
plays. They center around the Na
tivity, and in the parts of the angel
Gabriel and King Herod there is op
portunity for much dramatic action.
