The schedule of campus cars after
six o'clock in the evening will be
changed according to F. E. Chapin,
manager of the Peninsular Railway
Company.
Chapin states that starting October
1, the local car, running from the
depot to the campus, will wait at the
University Junction for the Interur
ban from San Jose due in Palo Alto at
10:09 and also for the car from that
city due to arrive in Palo Alto at 10:53.
Besides this, the car leaving San
Jose at 11:15, will run through to the
campus. An extra fare will be
charged from the depot, or from the
University Junction to the campus.
This will be merely a trial run nf
thirty days to see how much the stu
dents are in need of a late car from
San Jose and if the travel demands,
the 11:15 will be put upon a regular
schedule.
