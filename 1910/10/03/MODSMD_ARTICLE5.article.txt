# GRAYS ARE DEFEATED
## FIRST ENGLISH GAME OF SEASON GOES TO INDEPENDENTS. Soccer Men Loose by 4 to 1 Score. Greys to Play Thistles Next Saturday. 
### 
In a rather slow and lifeless game,
the Stanford Soccer men met defeat
Saturday at the hands of the Oakland
Independents by a score of 4 to 1. Up
to nearly the end of the first half,
neither side had succeeded in making
a score, when with a well directed
kick the outside right for the Indepen
dents succeeded in putting the ball
past Stuart and registered the first
tally.
At the beginning of the second half
the Stanford team started off with a
rush and before five minutes of play,
Pung, the inside right for the local
team converted the one and only tally
Stanford succeeded in securing.
From this point on, the Stanford ag
gregation was easily the agressor, but
owing to the skillful defensive work
of the Independent's back-field, the
local forwards were unable to score.
The Stanford men time and gain had
the ball within shooting distance of
their opponent's goal only to have it
either taken away from them by the
clever dribbling of the other side or
else have the kick blocked by the
back-field.
The remaining three tallies for the
Bay team were made during the latter
part of the half by long skillful shots
from the center forwards.
The personnel of the two teams was
as follows:
Stanford—Cragg, Pung, Higgins,
Pel las, Lyne, Humphreys, Reynolds,
Hamilton, McCann, Salsback, and
Stuart.
Independents—Mcßride, Panter, J.
Soutar, W. Coutar, Anderson, McGran,
Bremmer, Fay, Mathewson, Guild, and
Heighett.
On next Saturday the Greys go to
Alameda to play the Thistles and if
Sunday's scores go to show anything
the Stanford team will have to play a
much harder game on that date than
they played on Saturday.
