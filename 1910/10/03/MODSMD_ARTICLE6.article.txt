## 
### 
A particularly interesting number
is the September "Stanford Alumnus,"
just off the press. It contains a re
view of recent University activities
and of ihe achievements of Stanford
graduates in the public eye, notably P.
K. Oilman, '01, the discoverer of a
cancer cure. The frontispiece is a
splendid photograph of M. 15. Ander
son, Professor Emeritus of English
Literature, which supplements an ar
ticle by Professor A. G. Newcomer,
telling of Professor Anderson's work
in the translation of Dante's Divina
Coniedia. This paper is the basis of
one of a number of strong editorials
by E. W. Smith, '99.
