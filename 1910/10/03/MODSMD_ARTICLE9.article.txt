A Freshman has subscribed for a
life membership in the Stanford Union
and has made his first payment upon
the same. This is one individual out
of a class, which contains in its regis
tration over three hundred men, thp
majority of whom are to receive the
benefits and privileges of this institu
tion in the near future, and who will
some day be the students having the
actual control of the club. The Stan
ford Union is to affect the men in the
first year class the most vitally of any
students now in college, yet they be
long to the only class organization
that has not taken on active interest
in the movement. The spirit so far
has been very poor and calls for a
big improvement. We hope that the
Freshman Class will soon realize the
importance of this institution and that
the result will be an actual activity
and assistance upon their part.
