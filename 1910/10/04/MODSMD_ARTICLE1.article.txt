According to present indications,
"The Devil's Disciple," which will he
presented in the Assembly Hall,
October 29, will be the most elaborate
and perfectly acted play that has befMi
presented at the University, during
the present college generation. Plans
have been consummated for costum
ing, and stage settings that have nevr
before been attempted at Stanford.
From a dramatic standpoint, an ex
cellent production is assured by the
fact that rehearsals have already been
in progress for about two weeks, and
the play is well under way. Never be
fore has such an early start been made
on any performance.
The play itself is on excellent ve
hicle for presentation. The fact that
George Bernard Shaw, the brilliant
Irish dramatist, is the author, insures
a perfectly written piece. The lines
are full of scintillating humor, and in
tense situations.
The leading role, that of the "Devil's
Disciple" has been taken by such mas
ters of the dramatic art as Richard
Mansfield, and Henry Miller, and the
leading woman's part, was success
fully presented by Margaret Anglin,
the famous emotional actress. The
play gives exceptional opportunities
for all those who take part. Shaw
writes his works with such an eye for
the dramatic value of every situation,
that even the smallest part is good.
A mob scene, such has never been
attempted at the University, will be
put on in the last act. It seems prob
able, according to the plans now being
considered, that there will be at least
fifty people on the stage at that time.
As all characters will be in costume,
appropriate to the smallest detail, this
scene will be extremely spectacular.
Coach F. Mathieu, ha 3 given more
than usual attention to the choosing of
the cast, and he now believes that each
person has that character in the play
for which they are best suited. There
has been a very careful sifting of can
didates for parts, and this alone should
make it certain that the performance
will be a tremendous success.
The part of Richard Dudgeon, "The
Devil's Disciple," will he assumed by
R. H. Seward, '12. Coach Mathieu
thinks that never before has this
prominent thesplan been so happ'l.v
cast. The part is admirably suited to
him a id there see;u3 to l e no doubt
tint In will surpass any of hii prev
ic i < succ 1 ics at. Stanford.

11. Woodville, '11, will be seen as
\nthony Anderson, the fighting minis
ter, Although this is a new held for
Wcodville, he is fitting into the part
well, and a finished performance from
him is assured.
J. Beman, '12, who made such a hit
at the Track Meet Vaudeville, will he
given another chance, in the part of
Christy, to display his undoubted tal
ents as a comedian.
M. \V. Strong, '11, who played in
"The Man From Home," and "Cousin
Kate," will he seen as General Bur
goyne, one of the finest parts that
Shaw has produced.
H. C. Nelson, '10, and J. E. Thomp
son, '11, the former President dT the
University Conference, and the latter,
head yell leader and secretary of the
Student Body will be seen as Lawyer
Hawkins and William Dudgeon.
Other male parts will he as follows:
Major Swindon, P. Eliel, '13; Titus
Dudgeon, B. H. Lask, '12; Sergeant,
H. R. Spence, '13; Chaplain Brudencll,
C. M. Vrang, '13,
Judith Anderson, the part played by
Margaret Anglin will be assumed by
Miss Gertrude Workman, '12. This
will be the first opportunity for her
talent and ability to be given full
scope.
The part of Essie, a poor little waif,
will be taken by Miss Florence Wend
ling, '12. This part offers a chance for
Miss Wendling, to show her ability in
the Maude Adams style of acting.
Mrs. Dudgeon, a narrow, fanatical,
Puritan will be taken by Miss Mar
guerite Wilson, '11, a part which un
doubtedly fits her and gives her far
more chance than she has had in any
of the plays which she has taken part
in in the past.
Miss Roberta Haslett and Miss Ileen
Bullis, will be seen as Mrs. William
Dudgeon and Mrs. Titus Dudgeon, re
spectively.
