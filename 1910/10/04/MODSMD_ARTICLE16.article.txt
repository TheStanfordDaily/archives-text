## BERWICK PEACE PRIZE CONTEST WILL BE POPULAR. R.C. Root, '94, is Receiving Names of Orators Who Will Try for Money Prize. 
### 
The present visit of Robert C.
Root, '91, Pacific Coast Representative
of the American Peace Society and
secretary-treasurer of the Southern
California Peace Society is arousing a
yet wider interest in the coming Ed
ward Berwick, Jr. Peace Prize Con
test than was elicited last year, when
the contest was held for the first time
in this University. Mr. Root maintains
an office in room 209, of the English
Building, during his stay here, and
there is receiving the names of those
who wish to enter the oratorical tour
nament for the $50 prize offered by the
American Peace Society for the one
who most ably advances the cause of
international peace in his dissertation.
He comes especially, however, to
arouse interest in the general move
ment for world arbitration and wishes
to meet all those interested in this
movement or who wish to have the
nature of the Berwick contest more
fully explained to them.
Already six men have signified their
intention to Mr. Root of entering this
year's contest. They include one of
those who spoke last year, as well as
the winner of the prize, R. .7. Miller,
'11. Mr. Root expects to receive more
names before he leaves, which will
probably be Friday. He will maintain
office hours l'rom 9:ir> to 11:15 and
from 2:30 to ">:00 till Thursday. The
names of those entering so far are:
J. D. Houser, '10, G. Holcomb, '11, R.
J. Miller, '11, F. H. Hilton, '11, P. M.
Olgilvie, '11, and M. B. Henshaw, '12.
Although a definite date has not
been set for the evening of oratory, it
will probably be held the latter part
of November. There are few rules
and regulations governing the contest,
the $.j0 being awarded to that contest
ant who, in the opinion of the judges
best advances the cause of world dis
armament.
The Edward Berwick Peace Prize
Contest is one of over sixty similar
contests conducted under the auspices
of the American Peace Society in col
leges and universities all over the
United States. These contests in turn,
are a part of a general and extensive
program calculated to advance the
cause of international pacification.
The society has been in existence since
1828 and during all this time has
waged a relentless fight against war
and all its attendant evils.
A contest, similar to the local one is
now held annually at Berkeley, both
being nnder'thfc particular au'spices of
the California branch Of the; national
r t ' ' v *
society. The contests are supported
financially, by Mr. Edward' Berwick .of
Pacific" Grove, a* leader .irt the pgace
movement," who as long d's he lives
will make the annual prize offer. Mr.
Root, as secretary of the state society,
devotes all of his time to the attain
ment of its aims and will leave here
for other institutions where similar
contests will be arranged for and held.
