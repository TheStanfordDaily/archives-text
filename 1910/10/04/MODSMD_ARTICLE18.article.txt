# Baseball Men Meet Again Tomorrow.
## 
### 
Former Baseball Coach George J.
Presley has issued another call for the
baseball meeting, postponed yesterday.
All men interested in baseball Should
come to room 50 at 1:10 tomorrow
afternoon. Presley was unable to
start the fall practice work going yes
terday because of his inability to at
tend the meeting of candidates sched
uled for yesterday afternoon in room
50. He was forced to be in San Fran
cisco during the middle of the day for
unavoidable reasons. California has
had fall practice for the past five
weeks, with a regular schedule of
games. The Blue and Gold have ap
parently profited by the early work.
Stanford will undoubtedly carry for
ward some plan similar to that of the
collegians across the bay. It is possi
ble that the Executive Committee may
see fit to appoint a coach officially for
the season, who can take charge of
the diamond routine immediately.
