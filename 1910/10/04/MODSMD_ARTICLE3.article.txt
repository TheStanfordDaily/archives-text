# HALL SUPPORTS EATING CLUBS
## J.P. Hemphill, '09, Speaks to Residents of Dormitory and Arouses Enthusiasm.â€”Committee to Aid Movement Appointed. 
### 
J. P. Hemphill, '09, former president
of Encina Club, gave a talk to Encina
Club last evening on the matter of the
erection of buildings upon the camp
us to take the place of the eating clubs
that are now housed In College Ter
race. Two years ago a plan similar to
the one now on foot was broached, but
the Trustees of the University refused
to take the matter up. At that time
Hemphill and several other men real
ized the needs of the men in Encina
Hall and set about putting the move
ment on foot. Statistics regarding the
cost of building and maintaining suit
able houses for the eating clubs and
the annual income which would lie de
rived by the University were compiled
Their plan was the erection ot' two
quadrangular brick buildings on the
vac-nit ground just east of Encina
Hall. Each building would house two
eating clubs of thirty men each, be
sides giving suitable rooms for the
help. The buildings were to bo two
stories in height and on the second
flcor there were to he ten double
rooms for students. The incorpora
tion of this feature in the buildings
would give many students, who are
now compelled to live in Palo Alto and
upon the Terrace an opportunity to
room on the campus.
The committee made plans and spec
ifications for two buildings which were
to cost in the neighborhood of $5,000
each. The income that would be de
rived from such buildings at the cus
tomary price for room and board,
was found to amount to more than 30
per cent annually upon the entire in
vestment.
These men also canvassed the men's
dormitory in order to discover the

number of students who were eating
at the Terrace. They also investigated
whether the proposed plan would in
terfere in any manner with the man
agement of the Stanford Inn. It was
found that, after the Terrace men had
been accommodated there were still
more than enough to fill the Inn.
With this data and information, they
presented the plans to the Board or
Trustees, but the latter refused to ac
cept them on the grounds that it would
interfere with the good management of
Imi and that the students had insuffi
cient financial backing to support
such an enterprise.
After this definite decision upon the
part of the Trustees, interest in the
proposed arrangement died out. But
in the Alumnus for May of the current
year, there appeared an article en
titled, "An Encina Mail's Plea," by M.
E. Mitchell, '11, which summed up the
situation in general, and pointed out
the fact that approximately 150 men
walked to the Terrace daily for their
meals.
This article, according to Hemphill,
is what called the attention of the
Alumni Association to the need of suit
able eating houses upon the campus
and at their meeting two months ago,
they voted their support to the enter
prise. The Association turned the
matter over to the Alumni Advisory
Board and they, in turn, appointed
three of their members to look into the
matter and obtain all the necessary
statistics. This committee of alumni
is going to work out a scheme which
they hope will meet with the approval
of the trustees, but in order to put the
plans through they will have to have
the enthusiastic support of all the
students.
At the meeting last night, Hemphill
laid the facts, as they now stand, be
fore the men and expressed his desire
that the club take hold of the matter
and with the aid of the association
push the project through.
At the conclusion of Hemphill's
talk, the Encina Club passed a resolu
tion heartily endorsing the efforts of
the Alumni Association to further the
plans for the* erection of suitable
buildings on the campus for the eating
clubs. President Benson, also apt
pointed a committee of three, namely,
H. G. McCowen, '09, M. E. Mitchell, '11,
and R. S. Worthington, '12, to aid the
alumni committee in gathering the
necessary data.
As yet, no definite plan for the
buildings have been made as there are
numerous lesser details that must be
considered before proceeding with the
arrangements, but the committee
seems very favorable to the plans of
the original organizers, with certain
minor changes. The final decision in
the matter lies, of course, with the
trustees and unless they obje'ct for
other reasons than those they men
tioned two years ago, it seems prob
able that the plans will be perfected.
The main objection before was the
lack of financial backing among the
students, but with the support of the
Alumni Association, sufficient backing
is assured.

the matter lies, of course, with the
trustees and unless they obje'ct for
other reasons than those they men
tioned two years ago, it seems prob
able that the plans will be perfected.
The main objection before was the
lack of financial backing among the
students, but with the support of the
Alumni Association, sufficient backing
is assured.
J. P. Hemphill, '09, former president
of Encina Club, gave a talk to Encina
Club last evening on the matter of the
erection of buildings upon the camp
us to take the place of the eating clubs
that are now housed In College Ter
race. Two years ago a plan similar to
the one now on foot was broached, but
the Trustees of the University refused
to take the matter up. At that time
Hemphill and several other men real
ized the needs of the men in Encina
Hall and set about putting the move
ment on foot. Statistics regarding the
cost of building and maintaining suit
able houses for the eating clubs and
the annual income which would lie de
rived by the University were compiled
Their plan was the erection ot' two
quadrangular brick buildings on the
vac-nit ground just east of Encina
Hall. Each building would house two
eating clubs of thirty men each, be
sides giving suitable rooms for the
help. The buildings were to bo two
stories in height and on the second
flcor there were to he ten double
rooms for students. The incorpora
tion of this feature in the buildings
would give many students, who are
now compelled to live in Palo Alto and
upon the Terrace an opportunity to
room on the campus.
The committee made plans and spec
ifications for two buildings which were
to cost in the neighborhood of $5,000
each. The income that would be de
rived from such buildings at the cus
tomary price for room and board,
was found to amount to more than 30
per cent annually upon the entire in
vestment.
These men also canvassed the men's
dormitory in order to discover the

number of students who were eating
at the Terrace. They also investigated
whether the proposed plan would in
terfere in any manner with the man
agement of the Stanford Inn. It was
found that, after the Terrace men had
been accommodated there were still
more than enough to fill the Inn.
With this data and information, they
presented the plans to the Board or
Trustees, but the latter refused to ac
cept them on the grounds that it would
interfere with the good management of
Imi and that the students had insuffi
cient financial backing to support
such an enterprise.
After this definite decision upon the
part of the Trustees, interest in the
proposed arrangement died out. But
in the Alumnus for May of the current
year, there appeared an article en
titled, "An Encina Mail's Plea," by M.
E. Mitchell, '11, which summed up the
situation in general, and pointed out
the fact that approximately 150 men
walked to the Terrace daily for their
meals.
This article, according to Hemphill,
is what called the attention of the
Alumni Association to the need of suit
able eating houses upon the campus
and at their meeting two months ago,
they voted their support to the enter
prise. The Association turned the
matter over to the Alumni Advisory
Board and they, in turn, appointed
three of their members to look into the
matter and obtain all the necessary
statistics. This committee of alumni
is going to work out a scheme which
they hope will meet with the approval
of the trustees, but in order to put the
plans through they will have to have
the enthusiastic support of all the
students.
At the meeting last night, Hemphill
laid the facts, as they now stand, be
fore the men and expressed his desire
that the club take hold of the matter
and with the aid of the association
push the project through.
At the conclusion of Hemphill's
talk, the Encina Club passed a resolu
tion heartily endorsing the efforts of
the Alumni Association to further the
plans for the* erection of suitable
buildings on the campus for the eating
clubs. President Benson, also apt
pointed a committee of three, namely,
H. G. McCowen, '09, M. E. Mitchell, '11,
and R. S. Worthington, '12, to aid the
alumni committee in gathering the
necessary data.
As yet, no definite plan for the
buildings have been made as there are
numerous lesser details that must be
considered before proceeding with the
arrangements, but the committee
seems very favorable to the plans of
the original organizers, with certain
minor changes. The final decision in
the matter lies, of course, with the
trustees and unless they obje'ct for
other reasons than those they men
tioned two years ago, it seems prob
