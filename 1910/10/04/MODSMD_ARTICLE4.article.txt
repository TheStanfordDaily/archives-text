# FRESHMEN MAY BETTER SCORE OVER ST. MARY'S TOMORROW
## 
### 
The Freshman fifteen will tomorrow
try to improve its 3-0 score made
against St. Mary's College in the first
game the two teams played ten days
ago. They will face each other at 4:30
on Stanford Field, and the battle will
be one worth seeing. This game, with
the Santa Clara match on next Satur
day, will conclude the 1914 preliminary
schedule.
Olmstead and Boulware, two hardy
pack men, are still out of'togs and can
not play tomorrow. While their in
juries are not serious they are enough
to cause Coach Presley to retain them
on the sidelines. Olmstead has a rath
er bad case of ear trouble often seen
among workers in the scrum. Boul
ware is nursing a hurt knee, an injury
not serious. Hoth fighters will be in
the game, undoubtedly, next Saturday.
The line-up otherwise is identical to
that usod against Berkeley High four
days a;o. Henry is holding his posi
tion at wing with strong playing, and
Hcberts is doing well at center. The
backfield is taking very definite shape
and is ranidly 1 ecrming a unit.
St. Mary's defeated the Blue and
Cold Fre;huicn last Wednesday, 8-0,
a id this s?o;r,i to indicate that they

j have made a rapid climb on the ladder
lof rugby improvement in the past
I week. The struggle will be hard here
tomorrow and 1914 will be lucky, as
they were on September 24, to come
off the turf with a victory. St. Mary'a
bring their usual players, the powerful
I.Leonhardt, a member of the college
I nine also, at full back; Diavolo, a
j clever runner, at. half; and Starrett, a
! fast wing. The College fifteen has en
| durance. They scored the eight points
! against California in the second half of
| the contest. >•
Training rules for the Varsity squad,
; while they have been in effect for a
i week, have not been made absolutely
: strict. Coach Presley will demand
that they stop all social pastimes,
such as dancing, after the Freshman
game on October 15. The squad so far
this year has been remarkably free
from a long casualty list, and whatever
hurts there have been were little more
than trivial.
A. E. Roth, '09. or J. It. Femberton,
, '08, will hold the whistle in the St.
Mary's-Freshman contest. Admission
is to be twenty-five cents.
