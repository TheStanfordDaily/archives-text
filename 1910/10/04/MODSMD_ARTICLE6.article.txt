Plans for the location of eating
clubs within a radius of one mile from
Encina Hall have again been broached
and arrangements for obtaining them
have been started in a very business
like manner. No institution is more
vital to tha men from that dormitory
than that of securing suitable board.
But at the present time the majority
of men from Encina are compelled to
walk approximately five miles for their
meals —not lrom choice, but from the
necessity imposed by present condi
tions. The facilities offered for obtain
ing meals upon the campus are ex
ceedingly small and insufficient. The
two institutions that now offer board
cannot begin to supply all the men
who care to eat upon the campus and
as a result, those not obtaining the
facilities they seek, must either go to
Palo Alto or College Terrace. This
circumstance arises from the fact that
the Trustees of the University will not
allow buildings to be erected upon
the campus for this purpose. The
hardship is evident. From the report
made by the committee that has been
investigating the question, there can
be no excuse from a financial stand
point for not granting the request of
the committee. Norcan an objection that
there is insufficient interest, stand in
the progress of this movement. These
two arguments are clearly eliminated
and some excuse of an entirely differ
ent nature must be set up by the Trus
tees to warrant denial of this request
by them. This is one of the most im
portant conditions that affect the men
students locally and there is every
reason why a speedy acquiescence
should be met with upon the part of
the Hoard of University Trustees
We shall hope and look for favorable
action from that governing board.
