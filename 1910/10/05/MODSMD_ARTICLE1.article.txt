### 
Score of 155-0 ('hulked l'p by Heavier,
Speedier Teaui from the
Hay City.
The Cardinal babies were playing
this afternoon a far different team
than they defeated ten days ago. It
was a new St. Mary's team, —one that
defeated the Blue and Gold Freshmen
last Wednesday by a score of 8-0.
Passing rushes by Stanford were
quickly smothered and team work
was stopped.
A try was very nearly made to
wards the middle of the half when a
passing rush started by Gard, and con
tinued by Tilton, Darsie and Henry
took the ball close to the lino.
Simpson made a spectacular run
from 1 i>l4's 35 for the only try of the
first period. Leonhardt failing to con
vert, left the score at the end of the
first half, 3-0.
Geissler was not in the line-up to
day, because of a slight illness, which
will keep him out of a suit a few days.
First Half.
The game started off with a lively
skirmish around center, both teams
fighting with spirit. Leonhardt soon
secured the ball at center and made
a long high boot to touch at Fresh
men's 5. Booting to touch by Darsie
and dribbling by Clover carried the
ball back again to midfield.
On a free kick by Harrigan from
1914's 10 to Stolz at 35 gives the St.
Mary's wing a chance for a long run
and try. Leonhardt fails to convert
and score is marked up at 3-0 against
the Cardinal fighters.
Darsie securing the pigskin at mid
field, runs to St. Mary's 25, where he
is smothered under St. Mary's huskies.
Then game hangs perilously near to St.
Mary's goal, but the visitor's drive
ball back to midfield, where pigskin is
left.
Second Halt,
St. Mary's began proceedings by
pushing ball across Freshmen's 25
and close to their line. Simpson seizes
his opoprtunity and from a 10 yard
scrum crosses the line for a second
try. Diavila drives pigskin between
the posts. Score 8-0.
On the kick-off the Freshman push
through play to St. Mary's 25 and

skin to midfield.
Simpson secures tlie pigskin again

The Cardinal babies were playing
this afternoon a far different team
than they defeated ten days ago. It
was a new St. Mary's team, —one that
defeated the Blue and Gold Freshmen
last Wednesday by a score of 8-0.
Passing rushes by Stanford were
quickly smothered and team work
was stopped.
A try was very nearly made to
wards the middle of the half when a
passing rush started by Gard, and con
tinued by Tilton, Darsie and Henry
took the ball close to the lino.
Simpson made a spectacular run
from 1 i>l4's 35 for the only try of the
first period. Leonhardt failing to con
vert, left the score at the end of the
first half, 3-0.
Geissler was not in the line-up to
day, because of a slight illness, which
will keep him out of a suit a few days.
First Half.
The game started off with a lively
skirmish around center, both teams
fighting with spirit. Leonhardt soon
secured the ball at center and made
a long high boot to touch at Fresh
men's 5. Booting to touch by Darsie
and dribbling by Clover carried the
ball back again to midfield.
On a free kick by Harrigan from
1914's 10 to Stolz at 35 gives the St.
Mary's wing a chance for a long run
and try. Leonhardt fails to convert
and score is marked up at 3-0 against
the Cardinal fighters.
Darsie securing the pigskin at mid
field, runs to St. Mary's 25, where he
is smothered under St. Mary's huskies.
Then game hangs perilously near to St.
Mary's goal, but the visitor's drive
ball back to midfield, where pigskin is
left.
Second Halt,
St. Mary's began proceedings by
pushing ball across Freshmen's 25
and close to their line. Simpson seizes
his opoprtunity and from a 10 yard
scrum crosses the line for a second
try. Diavila drives pigskin between
the posts. Score 8-0.
On the kick-off the Freshman push
through play to St. Mary's 25 and
Henry boots to touch at 10. A pretty
passing rush participated in by all of
1914's backs fails to gain ground and
St. Mary's speediness advances pig
skin to midfield.
Simpson secures tlie pigskin again
and makes another spectacular try.
Diavila converts. Score, 13-0.
