# WORD REGARDING DEBATING RECEIVED FROM OREGON.
## 
### 
A letter has been received by F. H.
Hilton, '11, from W. C. Huntington,
manager of debating at the University
of Oregon, in which great pleasure is
expressed at the decision of Stanford
to enter into debating relations with
that college. The University of Wash
ington, third member of the prospec
tive league, has as yet come to no de
cision in regard to the matter. No re
fusal to join on her part is anticipated,
but should she take such action,
Huntington proposes the formation of
a dual league composed of Stanford
and the University of Oregon. Hilton,
who is in charge of the arrangements
for Stanford, states that this practi
cally assures at least one debate with
a northern school.
