## 
### 
At Stanford Field this afternoon Mr. Walter Camp, famous as a
football coach at Yale, said in regard to lxio visit to*the Pacific Coast:
"Now that I am here, I ain simply getting a general look at rugby.
It is not a specific proposition with lue. As for American football and
rugby, the exponents of each work <» i their own basis. There can be no
saying that we would take up rugby in the east, nor can we use
many changes from rugby to American football."
Asked as to whether the backfiehl was not a point which might be
changed in the old game, to conform with the rapid flying backs in
rugby, with their long kicks executed at high speed, he denied that the
rugby back style of play could be used in the American game.
"One primary principle of the American game, is to retain posses
sion of the ball. Rugby, of course, does not make that a cardinal prin
ciple.
Camp would say little as to his particular purpose in coming to the
Coast, nor would he say what res.ilt his visit might have. He is
compelled to be here at this time, because of the necessity of his pres
ence in the east at the time of the i nportant Yale-Princeton and Yale-
Harvard games. When it was mentioned that he could not see the best
exhibitions of rugby at this time o" the season, and that the Stanford-
California contest would develope t'le greatest amount of skill of the
English game, he said:
"1 didn't come out here for rugby, but for business, and therefore,
see the matches merely as I can." He added: "The game as played
here is different from that which I have seen in England or Canada,
and 1 have seen many games thera and in all parts of the world."
Mr. Camp will not be able to see the Cardinal Varsity in action on
Saturday, since he goes north Friday night.
