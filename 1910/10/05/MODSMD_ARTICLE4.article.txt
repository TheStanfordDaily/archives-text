# DANCE TICKETS ARE TO BE HONORED AT RUGBY CONTEST
## 
### 
The sale of tickets for the Bleacher
Stunt Dance next Saturday evening
lias exceeded all expectations. More
than the 150 necessary to obtain Grad
uate Manager Burbank's offer have
been sold and consequently everyone
having a dance ticket may present the
same for two admissions to the football
game next Saturday afternoon. These
tickets, however, will only be honored
for ladies and their escorts, â€”two men
not being admitted to the game on this
offer.
Arrangements have been made with
the Peninsular Railway Company for
the use of two special cars. These cars
will leave the campus station at 7:50
sharp Saturday evening. They will
also be in operation after the dance to
convey the crowd back
The committee has spared no pains
to make the dance the most successful
informal ever held. A sub-committee
composed of A. W. Ambrose, '13, chair
man. H. C. Boyd, '13, and S. Brown, '13,
has been appointed to take charge o<"
th i decorations and other preparations

for the dance. Brohaska's orchestra
has been retained for the occasion.
The committee lias also paid particu
lar attention to the selection of the
pieces and only the most popular of
the latest compositions have been
chosen.
The dance will start at 8 o'clock
sharp, without considering the number
present. lu order that all who are
going to attend can fill out their pro
grams completely, the committee an
nounces that there will be four extras
besides the regular eighteen dances.
The programs are very unique and
in design are in keeping with the foot
ball season. The art design used for
the cover is the work of A. L. King,
'12. These programs are to be given
out tomorrow and Friday at the Stan
ford Bookstore and may be obtained
only upon the presentation of a ticket.
Those who wish to attend the dance
and have not purchased tickets may
secure them from the Bookstore or
from 11. Rittigetein, '10, R. B. Wood
ville, '11, and.1. B. Beman, "12.
