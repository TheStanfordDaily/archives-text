# ROOTER'S HATS HAVE BEEN ORDERED FROM NEW YORK
## Will Sell Hats for 40 Cents.â€”Considerable Reduction Over Former Price. 
### 
J. E. Thompson, '11, secretary of the
Student Body, has received word from
the manager of the Regent Haberdash
ery, that the rooter's hats, which were
ordered through the Regent this year,
left Xew York, where they were being
made, on the first of this month.
This year the contract was let to the
Regent. In the past seasons the root
er's hats have cost the students 63c.
apiece, whereas, this year the Regent
will supply them for 40 c., saving the
purchasers 25c. per hat.
In spite of this radical reduction in
price, the hats will be identical in
quality with those which have been
worn in the past.
As has been the case in past years,
no student will be allowed in the root
ing section at the intercollegiate game
unless wearing a rooter's hat. The
majority of the old students will not
have to purchase hats. They are meant
particularly for the new students and
Freshmen.
The dates on which they will be
placed on sale will be announced later.
