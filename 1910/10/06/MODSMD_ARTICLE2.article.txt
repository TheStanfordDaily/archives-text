# WALTER CAMP SPEAKS AT FRESHMAN ST. MARY GAME.
## Father of American Football Congratulates Students Upon Posessing Exceptional Athletic Grounds. 
### 
While at Stanford Field yesterday,
during the Freshman-St. Mary's rugby
game, Walter Camp was asked by the
Cardinal yell-leaders to speak to the
students on the bleachers. He con
sented readily, saying, "I assure you I
am glad to be at Stanford again. Some
of the best days of my life were spent
here. Of course you cannot expect
me to become enthusiastic over rugby,
since I have not been out here long.
"I congratulate you very much for
having a better field than in my day.
The field at Berkeley reminds me of
the field we used to have.
"I think from what I see here that
you have the same spirit as we have.
That is what appeals to me and to the
American people, whether it be in
rugby or in the old American game."
Coach Camp left during the second
half of the contest yesterday, because
of the necessity of being in San Fran
cisco at an early hour, in order to at
tend the banquet given in his honor by
the Pacific Athletic Association.
