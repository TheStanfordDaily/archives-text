tem, that intercollegiate boating be re

thousand dollars per annum, be given

idea in view, of encouraging individual

J. ERNEST THOMPSON,
Secretary Student Body.
The above resolution of the Execu
tive Committee shows that the efforts
of the Lagunita Rowing Club to again
place rowing back to its old position

as an intercollegiate sport have not
been in vain and that Stanford Univer
sity herself has done all in her power
to give it the support that it deserves.
The existence of rowing for the com
ing year as a Varsity sport then de
ponds entirely upon the attitude taken
by the Executive Committee of the As
sociated Students or' the University of
California. That California will meat
Stanford half way in the matter is con
fidently expected and the official recog
nition by the two universities is ur.«
doubtedly only a matter of a short
time. As soon as final action is taken,
steps will be taken to open the fall
training season and again put into con
dition a winning Cardinal eight.
Rowing as a Varsity sport was re
fused recognition by the Executive
Committee September 30, 19C9. On
December 9, the Executive Committee
turned the boating equipment, includ
ing the shells and barges then in pos
session of the Student Body, over to
the Lagunita Rowing Club and since
that date, rowing lias been conducted
as a University sport entirely under
its direction and upon its responsibil
ity. The one season which it has con
ducted has been most successful finan
cially and with the exception of the
1909 season, the most successful as
far as victories are concerned in Stan
ford's athletic season history. Con
sidered in the light that no mishaps
occurred in the Varsity race to either
California or Stanford, the last season
was the most successful, but a Fresh
man four rather than a Freshman
eight registered the usual victory over
the rival babies and Stanford, owing
to mishaps, did not win the Pacific
Coast Championship from Washington,
as she had the previous year.
The fact that such success was
achieved by the oarsmen with 110 pro
fessional coach, and without Student
Body backing, and that the year was
concluded with a surplus of $100 in the
Boat Club's treasury ha 3 convinced th
Executive Committee that with a com
tinuation of the "no-paid-coach" sys
tem, rowing can be replaced in its old
position on the athletic calender. Those
who had the direct management dur
ing the past season are positive that
$1000 will cover all necessary ex
penses to turn out worthy Freshmen
and Varsity eights.
Rowing as an Intercollegiate sport
lias had but a short existence in Stan
ford University. The first crew to row
for their Varsity emblems was the 1907
eight, which finished its race six
lengths ahead of the Blue and Gold
oarsmen. This was the first race of
eight-oar shells held on the Pacific
Coast and the men were coached to
victory by Dan Murphy. Fred Zim
merman, '07, was the first Varsity Cap
tain. Up to 1907, rowing was conduct
ed by the Lagunita Rowing Club.
The 1908 season ended disastrouly
for Stanford. We were unable to re
hire Murphy and came out of the sea
son with but a victorious Freshman
eight captained by K. L. Dole, 'll r
Murphy returned to coach the 1909
eights, and delivered the goods as in
1907. The deficit for the season, how
ever, was $3000 and that combined
with other unfortunate circumstances,
induced the Executive Committee not
to grant it further recognition. It was
for the Lagunita Rowing Club as or
ganized and directed in 1910 to prove
that it is possible and feasible for the
Student Body to recognize and support
boating as an Intercollegiate sport.

The above resolution of the Execu
tive Committee shows that the efforts
of the Lagunita Rowing Club to again
place rowing back to its old position

as an intercollegiate sport have not
been in vain and that Stanford Univer
sity herself has done all in her power
to give it the support that it deserves.
The existence of rowing for the com
ing year as a Varsity sport then de
ponds entirely upon the attitude taken
by the Executive Committee of the As
sociated Students or' the University of
California. That California will meat
Stanford half way in the matter is con
fidently expected and the official recog
nition by the two universities is ur.«
doubtedly only a matter of a short
time. As soon as final action is taken,
steps will be taken to open the fall
training season and again put into con
dition a winning Cardinal eight.
Rowing as a Varsity sport was re
fused recognition by the Executive
Committee September 30, 19C9. On
December 9, the Executive Committee
turned the boating equipment, includ
ing the shells and barges then in pos
session of the Student Body, over to
the Lagunita Rowing Club and since
that date, rowing lias been conducted
as a University sport entirely under
its direction and upon its responsibil
ity. The one season which it has con
ducted has been most successful finan
cially and with the exception of the
1909 season, the most successful as
far as victories are concerned in Stan
ford's athletic season history. Con
sidered in the light that no mishaps
occurred in the Varsity race to either
California or Stanford, the last season
was the most successful, but a Fresh
man four rather than a Freshman
eight registered the usual victory over
the rival babies and Stanford, owing
to mishaps, did not win the Pacific
Coast Championship from Washington,
as she had the previous year.
The fact that such success was
achieved by the oarsmen with 110 pro
fessional coach, and without Student
Body backing, and that the year was
concluded with a surplus of $100 in the
Boat Club's treasury ha 3 convinced th
Executive Committee that with a com
tinuation of the "no-paid-coach" sys
tem, rowing can be replaced in its old
position on the athletic calender. Those
who had the direct management dur
ing the past season are positive that
$1000 will cover all necessary ex
penses to turn out worthy Freshmen
and Varsity eights.
Rowing as an Intercollegiate sport
lias had but a short existence in Stan
ford University. The first crew to row
for their Varsity emblems was the 1907
eight, which finished its race six
lengths ahead of the Blue and Gold
oarsmen. This was the first race of
eight-oar shells held on the Pacific
Coast and the men were coached to
victory by Dan Murphy. Fred Zim
merman, '07, was the first Varsity Cap
tain. Up to 1907, rowing was conduct
ed by the Lagunita Rowing Club.
The 1908 season ended disastrouly
for Stanford. We were unable to re
hire Murphy and came out of the sea
son with but a victorious Freshman
eight captained by K. L. Dole, 'll r
Murphy returned to coach the 1909
eights, and delivered the goods as in
1907. The deficit for the season, how
ever, was $3000 and that combined
with other unfortunate circumstances,
induced the Executive Committee not
to grant it further recognition. It was
for the Lagunita Rowing Club as or
ganized and directed in 1910 to prove
that it is possible and feasible for the
Student Body to recognize and support
boating as an Intercollegiate sport.
The Executive Committee held its
regular weekly session last evening
aid several important matters were'
considered. The following are the of
ficial minutes of the meeting:
President G. A. Dltz in the chair.
Kern late.
