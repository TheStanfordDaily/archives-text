We regret to announce the resigna
tion of Basil F. Bickel from the staff
of the Daily Palo Alto. The manag
ing editor has been forced to give up
his work with the college publication
only because of the stress of work re
sulting from his acceptance of the
position of city editor of the Palo Alto
"Times."
