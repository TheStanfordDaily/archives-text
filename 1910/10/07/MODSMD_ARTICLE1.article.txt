# VARSITY PLAYS BARBARIANS ON TURF FIELD TOMORROW.
## 1914 Moots Santa Clara.—Boulware, Olmstead and Geissler in Line-up. Mitchell to Play Center. 
### 
The Cardinal Freshmen will tomor
row make their final appearance in a
regular game before their all-impor
tant struggle with the California 1911
fifteen in eight days. This will be the
last chance for the student public to
ascertain the strength of the first-year
players. Santa Clara, as an opponent,
offers plenty of opportunity to take a
last look at the Stanford team in its
preliminary lesson. This game is set
for 2:30. At 4:30 the Varsity again
meets the Barbarians, having defeated
them two weeks ago, 21-0.
A more or less important shake-up
has disturbed the ranks of the Fresh
men fighters. Mitchell, a scrum play
er, is to assume responsibility as a
center three-quarter. At that posi
tion he has many possibilities of be
coming a strong player. He is fast,
has a build that suits the place, and,
with hard work in a few days, could
be turned into a good back. Card
takes his old place in the scrum.
Olmstead and Boulware, long absent
ftv.ni the pack, are back in the line-up,
and that news is a great source of sat
isfaction.
Geissler is back again in his place
at wing, and that fact also brings con
fidence. It is hard to say what might
have been the result of the St. Mary's
game last Wednesday with Geissler,
Olmstead, and Boulware in their old
positions. Henry or Hall will balance
Geissler as the other wing in the line.
The other members of the fifteen are
unchanged since Wednesday.
But one change occurs among the
Varsity players. Woodcock may not
be able to handle the ball as wing
forward, and Fyfe will take his
place.
C. L. Reading and W. P. Fuller are
to referee the Varsity and Freshman
games respectively.
