# TO MAKE RESERVATIONS MONDAY
## An Excellent Performance Guaranteed by Schubert Club.—Sale to Begin at 8 O'clock at Bookstore. 
### 
Next Monday morning at 8 o'clock,
the seats for"The Mikado" will go on
sale at the Bookstore on the campus
and at the Stanford Pharmacy in Palo
Alto.
Anxious to uphold their reputations
as sponsors for only the highest class
of musical productions, presented in
the most finished manner, the Schu
bert Club has spared neither pains nor
expense in preparing for the opera.
In itself, the choice of Gilbert and Sul
livan's classic, is indicative of the as
pirations of the organization as this
famous piece has been so often pro
duced by troupes of the most accom
plished artists on the stage, that now
only the most finished presentation is
acceptable to English speakinpTaudi
ences
Rehearsals are being held daily, and
although a week yet remains before
the production, the scenes have bean
mastered and a finished and artistic
performance is assured. Both chor
uses are attractive in appearancoir£tpd

their picturesque Japanese costumes
and fancy steps will be prominent
features. Arrangements are being
made for the elaborate scenery which
the opera will require.
The University Orchestra will pro
vide pleasing music for this occasion,
and it is likely that topical songs, full
of local hits, will be introduced, al
though the singers decline to name the
subjects of their verse. The opera it
self affords an excellent means of
demonstrating the clever dramatic and
musical ability of the members of the
cast. The music is catchy and the
humorous situations are unusually
numerous.
In order to obviate the rush which
has characterized the sale of tickets
in the past, the plan suggested by the
Student's Conference will be used.
All persons present at the Bookstore
at 8 o'clock Monday morning will
draw lots for position in the line; the
person drawing number one securing
first choice of the seats.
