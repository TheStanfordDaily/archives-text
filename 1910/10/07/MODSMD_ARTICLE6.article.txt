# REPRESENTATIVES OF ROW AND HALL MEET COMMITTEE.
## Advisory Hoard of Conference Discusses Matters of Importance With Students this Afternoon. 
### 
Pursuant with the instructions of
ilie I'niversity Conference, the Student
Advisory Committee tins afternoon
called together representatives of the
various fraternities and of Encina Hall
and discussed with them several mat
ters of concern to the University com
munity.
The undesirability of taking refresh
ments from the various social func
tions was impressed upon all those
present. As to ball playing, the fra
ternity representatives agreed to stop
the sport on the lawns from 12:15 to
1:30, so as to not endanger the large
number passing by at this hour.
TThe need of more spontaniety in
yelling at the games and rallies, and
applause at the assemblies, was also
informally discussed at the meeting
and the proposed plans of leaving the
rooters largely independent of the
leadership of the yell-leaders seemed
to meet with favor.
