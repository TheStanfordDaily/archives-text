# WOULD INTEREST HIGH SCHOOLS.
## Executive Committee Wishes to Send Daily Palo Alto to Various Institutions in State. 
### 
Efforts are now being made by the
Executive Committee to interest 170
different high schools throughout the
state in Stanford through the medium
of the Daily Palo Alto. In a letter that
has been forwarded to the principals
of these preparatory schols, the object
of the committee is explained.
Following is the letter:
"We desire to keep preparatory
school students on this coast informed
on college affairs. To do this we por
pose sending copies of the Daily Palo
Alto, which is our daily college paper
to a number of the larger schools.
We will be pleased to place your
school on the mailing list, providing
you will agree to the following con
ditions:
To appoint a student (preferably the
student-body president or yell-leader)
to whom the papers may be sent and
who will,
(a) Post copies of the Daily Palo
Alto on the school bulletin board, or
elsewhere where they can be readily
seen by the students. (Two copies of
each issue will be sent to enable both
sides to be displayed at once.)
(b) Keep a file of back copies in
some place of easy access to the stu
dents.
(c) Appoint a successor with the ap
proval of the principal.
We believe that your cooperation
with us in this matter will be of
mutual benefit to the students of your
school and of Stanford University.
The composition of the Daily Palo
Alto represents the best efforts of the
brightest literary men in college. Lec
tures of professors and prominent
speakers are often reported in full.
Stories on college organizations and
activities as well as (he daily college
calendar are included in the reading
matter..
Preparatory school students who
read a college paper become interested
in college and the result is better
