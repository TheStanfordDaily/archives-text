Again a case of cheating in class
work has been summarily dealt with
by the Faculty Committee on Student
Affairs. The severity of the punish
ment in a case of this nature is not
to be criticized as the offence is one
that deserves the severest of punish
ments that that board is accustomed
to mete out to offenders against Uni
versity discipline. The alleviation of
this evil seems difficult, especially
when so many cases actually come up
for official notice each semester. The
institution of the honor system, now
observed by the Law School, the en
gineering departments, various classes
in such divisions of instruction as the
History and Economics departments,
as an ultimate goal, seems to be an
ideal state of affairs. Although the
institution cannot be installed without
a sufficient education of those who are
to form part of the system and those
whom it affects, yet a gradual adop
tion of this plan would tend to allevi
ate these cases which are unfit to be
recorded as the acts of university
students. Many professors are at the
present time willing to install this
system, if they were assured that the
students would not take undue ad
vantage of their privilege. The suc
cess has been unquestioned in those
departments where it has been given a
trial, and it is to lie hoped that the
other divisions of Instruction will
soon see their way clear to adopt this
plan.
