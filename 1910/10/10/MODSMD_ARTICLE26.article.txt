## 
### 
At Alameda Saturday afternoon, the
Stanford Greys lined up against last
season's champion Thistles.
The Thistles were the first to score,
Aitkin slipping one past Goldworthy.
The play was fast on each side.
At the beginning of the second half
with the score 2-1, the Stanford team,
with the sun at their backs, started off
with a rush and kept the Thistle de
fense very busy.
Before many minutes of play, Pung
equalized the score by a deciving shot
into the corner of the net. Fifteen
minutes later the same player put one
through the goal keepers legs, making
the score now stand 3 to 2 in favor of
Stanford.
The Thistles, before ten minutes of
play passed again tied the score.
After considerable center field play,
Miller playing inside left for the
Greys, made a long, difficult shot, giv
ing the Greys an advantage of one
goal. But with only a few minutes to
spare Carswell of the Thistles evened
the score again and the game ended
with the final score 3-3.
