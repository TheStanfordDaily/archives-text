# FIFTEENS WIN IN TWO FAST GAMES
## Varsity Registers 34-0 Against Barbarians, While Freshmen Obtain Victory from Santa Clara in Score of 8-5. 
### 
The Freshman fifteen won its final
game before the great struggle against
California in six days, by winning an
8-5 victory from Santa Clara College
on the turf in the first game of Satur
day afternoon. Tho Varsity team went
far enough ahead of the Barbarians to
pile up a 34-0 score in the second
game of the day.
All the first-year players, Geissler,
Olmstead and Bouhvare, lost by in
juries, were back in the line-up Sat
urday and their added strength
showed how much they had been
missed. The longest halves that have
been used this season were played and
the Freshmen proved equal to the de
mands of the watch, and struggled
hard during practically the entire
sixty minutes. Only in the middle of
the second half did they show the ef
fects of long playing, when Santa
Clara went through them for a try.
But their powers of endurance were
proven by the immediate tightening up
of their defense, with the result that
no Mission player could again get
within speaking distance of a score.
The team as a whole did well, and
the several men who starred individu
ally only kept up to their standard of
playing. One of the happenings that
was watched with interest was the
placing of Mitchel, a finished scrum
player, in the position of center three
quarter. With a little more exercise
as a back, he could become as good as
any in line. He is powerful, and,
above all, uses his head in tight places.
A round dozen free kicks were
granted by Referee Roth as penalties
and Santa Clara incurred the greater
amount of punishment, Geissler held
the ball nine times in penalty kicks
against the Mission men. The Fresh
men offended three times.
There were many changes in the
scrum. Watkins, side-ranker, received
during an unusually hard skirmish
two blows on the head that put him
completely out of his senses for sev
eral hours.
The two trys scored by the Fresh
men came in the first half, and the
opening score was prettily executed.
1914 had carried Santa Clara down the
field by stiff work. A drop-out by
Ybarrando, blocked by Knight started
all the trouble. The blocked ball
rolled out at the Freshman 15. The
following scrum gave the leather 10
Harrigan on a direct pass from Tilton
at half. Harrigan ran a few yards
and passed to Henry, who was backing
up finely. Henry went over for the
first three points. The score came at
the extreme corner of the field, and
Geissler missed the difficult goal re
sulting. Score, 3-0.
The drop-out from the first try left

Santa Clara at a disadvantage and the
I pigskin never went beyond the Fresh-
I men 40. Play gradually worked down
! to the Mission citadel with successive
hard set-tos on the part of the Fresh
[ men, until Gard, running through a
j scattered field, picked up and went
across easily for the next three points.
Geissler converted the easy goal re
sulting. Score, 8-0.
During the rest of the half, Santa
Clara was forced to defend, and the
wistle blew with the ball at the visi
tors' 35. In the second period, how
ever, Santa Clara held a little more
than her own. The Freshmen weak
j ened toward the middle of the half,
and only deSperate fighting kept back
a try with the ball on 1914's 25. Dar
sie, Reeves, and Geissler saved con
tinually by kicks to touch. But Santa
, Clara advanced relentlessly, and on
the 5-yard line, Catalina secured and
went over. Ybarrando converted.
The Varsity play was good, and Erb
was the principal performer for the
backs and Cheda took honors for the
scrum men. Erb scored several trys
and his saving kicks to touch helped
in tight places. He was never too late
to do the trick. The pack was far the
more agressive and it was practically
their game, though Thoburn, as well
as Erb, did his duty at many places
The most spectacular score was
made when the total was made 17-0.
From the Barbarians' 30 a long pass
ing rush was started which ended with
Kern putting the leather down for a
try. Erb, Cheda, Frank, Arrell, and
Kern were checked off in the rush,
and there were one or two others in
between who handled the ball.
