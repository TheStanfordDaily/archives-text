# WILL START TOURNEY
## ANNUAL INTERCLASS MATCHES BEGIN NEXT SATURDAY. Both Singles and Doubles to be Contested.â€”Winners to Receive Class Sweaters. 
### 
ihe Tennis Club has planned lo
start the annual interclass tennis
tournament on Saturday morning.
The handicape contest was to have
reached the final round this afternoon,
leaving plenty of time before the inter
class contest.
In the coming tournament both
singles and doubles will be contested
and everybody plays from scratch.
The entrance fee for this tournament
is GO cents for singles and $1.00 for
each doubles team. Any member of
the University is eligible to compete
upon payment of the l'ee and all desir
ing to enter are requested to give their
names either to H. S. Morgan at the
Phi Delta Theta house, or H. L. Loud,
room 128 Encina.
The winners of this tournament will
receive class sweaters. H. S. Morgan,
'12, is the present singles champion of
the University and is practicing daily
to retain the title. But from the class
of tennis displayed by some of the new
men in the handicap tournament, he
will retain it with some difficulty.
Dawson, Douglas, and W. G. Murray
from among the new men are putting
up an excellent brand of tennis. Of
the old guard, both R. L. Murray, '13,
and H. Mann,'lo, are likely contenders.
Neither T. C. Henry or H. Jordan of
the 1910 team, who are the present
doubles champions, are in college this
year which allows a possibility of one
of the underclasses annexing the title.
From the Sophomores, Douglass and
Murray are already working together
and are showing up well in practice.
Shaul and Pratt or Argabrite also
make a strong combination. The
Freshman have two good men in Daw
son and Cawston and if they play will
together they will make a strong
team.
The Seniors possess Mann of last
year's Varsity team, but a suitable
team mate has not yet been found.
Morgan and Murray or Grace are like
ly contenders from 1912. Last year,
Morgan and Grace were runners-up,
but this year Morgan will probably
play with Murray. The latter is a
better individual player than Grace,
but it remains to be seen whether or
not he is as good in the doubles.
