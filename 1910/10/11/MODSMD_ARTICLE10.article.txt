The mere fact that Assembly Hall
is not an open portion of the Quad
rangle does not warrant a flagrant
violation of the observation of the
tradition that prohibits smoking with
in its confines. The custom prohibits
smoking on the Quadrangle and there
can be no question but that the As
sembly Hall is situated upon that par
ticular â€¢ spot. Yet every rehearsal in
this hall appears to be an excuse for
an open violation of the custom.
There is absolutely no difference be
tween smoking within this building
and committing the same act in the
open space on the Inner Quadrangle.
If the tradition is to be preserved, it
must be strictly adhered to and the
custom is one worthy of its continued
existence. Therefore, there is no ex
cuse for this disregard of one of the
most prominent and sacred of our
traditional institutions. The mere
fact that the smoking is done within a
building upon the Quadrangle does
not place it without the pale of this
custom.
