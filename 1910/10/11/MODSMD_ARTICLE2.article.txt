# SOCCER TEAM WILL PLAY SOLDIERS ON WEDNESDAY.
## Referee Minto to Officiate at Initial Game With Men From the Presidio. 
### 
On Wednesday afternoon the Encina
Gymnasium Soccer Team will journey
to San Francisco to play their first
game with soldiers from the Presidio.
Although this is the first season
that the soldiers have been contenders
in the league, reports from the city
show that they are playing a snappy
game and the local aggregation will
undoubtedly have their hands full
This is the only midweek game to be
played this semester and the schedule
was arranged in this way so that no
conflict would occur between this
game and the Freshman-California
game next Saturday.
Wednesday being Discovery Day
and therefore a holiday throughout
the state, a large number of tickets
have already been sold for the game
and unless something unforseen oc
curs, a large crowd will witness the
initial game between these two teams.
At last night's practice several
changes were made in the forward
line and the result, was a fast snappy
practice, the first team registering
two goals to the second team's none.
If this same line-up is continued, the
following men will play in Wednes
day's game:
Gymnasium — Gragg, Lyne, Pung,
Migginr, Williams, Hamilton, Rey
nolds, Humphreys, McCann (capt.l,
Clyde, and Stuart.
Soldiers —Lynch, Kelly, Schwander,
Monahan, Delamare, Smith, Aitken,
Ferguson, Caldwell, Barton, A. J.
Morahan.
