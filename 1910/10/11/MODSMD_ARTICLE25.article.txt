# Injuries to Freshmen Not Permanent.
## 
### 
F. B. Watkins, the Freshman for
ward who was injured in Saturday's
game with Santa Clara, was out in
togs yesterday apparently none the
worse for his experience.
K. F. Kauffman, the plucky little
fullback on the Freshman team, re
ceived a slight injury in Saturday's
scrummage, which is keeping him on
the side lines until Wednesday or
Thursday.
