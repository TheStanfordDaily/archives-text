For streaking red a surging field.

The Stanford pride her name to

Fight. men of Stanford,
Victory's in sight,
Trail Herkeley's Ininiter,
And for Cardinal, tight, fight, fight,

Win. me a of Stanford,
Win the ga:«e today,
Drive the golden hear,
Back to his lair,
Across the hay,
Fight, men of Stanford,
Down them in yonr might,
Now rush them off the field.
And for the Cardinal fight, fight, fight,

Win men of Stanford,
Win the game today,
Drive the golden hear,
Hack to his lair,
Across the hay.
The songs which will be most fre
quently sung on the bleachers this col
lege year are the "Cardinal Fighting
Song" and the "Stanford Score."
These are new and original composi
tions and were awarded first and sec
ond prizes respectively by the Song
and Yell Committee at their meeting
held yesterday evening. "The Cardi
nal Fighting Song" has W. S. Wilson,
'13, and P. Kiel, '13. as composers, the
music being by Wilson and the words
by Eliel. "The Stanford Score" is the
production of W. C. K. Achi, '12. com
poser of "Sons of the Stanford Red,"
last year's prize winner. Wilson and
Eliel will receive a prize of $10 while
Achi gets
A large number of very excellent
songs were submitted to the committee
and several of those not winning
prizes will undoubtedly be widely
sung. H. P. Knight's, '11. contribution,
"Dear Old Stanford," was especially
good and with some modifications was
accepted.
Honorable mention is given the com
positions of .Miss M. Herdman, ex-'l2,
A. G. Hollenstciner, '11, and W. C. K.
Achi, '12. All of these songs add
greatly to Stanford songs as a whole,
but are not exactly suitable for bleach
er singing.
None of the yells handed in to the
committee were accepted. A general
lack of originality was noticeable in
all of them, most of them constituting
an ensemble of older yells. In order
to have new yells, therefore, the com
mittee has decided to extend the final
(bite for submitting them until next
Tuesday. The Committee requests
that all those contributing last even

ing make another attempt at originat
ing entirely new yells which will be
distinctive.
The committeemen wish to (hank
(he many students who submitted
songs and yells and wishes to congrat
ulate (hem upon the general high
standard of (heir work.
