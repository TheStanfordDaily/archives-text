# WILL HAVE BOAT CLUB
## WOMEN PLAN TO BUILD HOUSE ON LAGUNITA. Swimming and Boating to be Placed on Regular List of Women's Athletic Activities. 
### 
At last the women of the University
are about to come into their own. It
will be no longer necessary for them
to wait upon the caprice of some gal
lant student asking them to make the
second for a canoe trip. Nor can the
Faculty regulations in regard to
swimming try-outs, as a requisite for
boating, weigh as heavily on the wo
men as they have in the past. Nor yet
again, will the men of the University
be the only ones disporting themselves
in the green waters of Lagunita on
warm spring afternoons.
All this was decided at a meeting of
a committee of the representative wo
men held last semester. Up to this
time the women have been so secre
tive as to their plans that no definite
information could be obtained.
It has just been learned that the
same committee is to meet in the very
near future, and is to consider bids
for a boathouse to be erected for the
women on the shores of Lake Lagu
nita.
Furthermore, the committee con
siders that all women of the Univer
sity will be eligible for membership,
provided Ihey go through the neces
sary formalities.
It is further planned to place boat
ing and swimming on the regular
list of women's sports. It could not
be learned at this time, however,
whether or not the committee had
made plans to use the Lagunita Boat
Club's shells.
