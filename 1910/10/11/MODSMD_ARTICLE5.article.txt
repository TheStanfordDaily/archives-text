# BIG BONFIRE AGAIN DISCUSSED.
## Freshmen Appoint Committee to Have Charge.â€”Class Yells and Dues Considered. 
### 
The football rally bonfire was again
the topic of interest at the Freshman
classmeeting this afternoon, and if
enthusiasm is an indication, this will
bo the biggest blaze which ever height
ened the enthusiasm for the California
game. A committee was elected by the
class to have charge of this matter,
consisting of H. L. Reid. G. W. Wil
fong, F. W. Cowan, E. C. Behrens, and
O. H. Castle. This committee will
elect its chairman at a later date. The
need of a class yell was also present
ed, and a committee including L. J.
Lewis, C. C. Close, and H. C. Nickels
apopinted to select a suitable one.
Some discussion was aroused by the
mot'on to pay from the class treas
ury for expenses incurred when the
Sophomore posters were seized the
day of the interclass rush. This was
carried. Owing to delay of the mem
bers in paying dues, a plan is now
under consideration to drop from the
all in arrears after November 7.
