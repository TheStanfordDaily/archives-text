# TO DANCE AT ARMORY
## SOPHOMORES PLAN ELABORATE COTILLION. Fourteen Dances Will be Enjoyed to the Strains of Bohaska's Orchestra. 
### 
After giving the matter several
weeks' consideration, the Sophomore
Cotillion Committee has decided that
the Armory in Palo Alto should be the
scene of that dance. Although Encina
Hali has been used for practically all
formal functions in the past, it was
deemed advisable to change, as the
latter hall has proven itself too small
to accomodate the large number in at
tendance at the dances during the
past year.
The ticket sale will absolutely be
limited to 175. This was approxi
mately the number of couples at the
1012 cotillion, and it is thought that
this figure will keep the crowd to a
size which wiil insure the most suc
cessful dance possible.
The exact nature of the decorations
has not been decided upon. No ex
pense is to be spared in making the
decorations the most artistic and
elaborate that have ever been seen at
any college function.
Favor dances and a supper dance of
a very unique description will be the
features of the evening. The well
known Bohaska's orchestra will again
be heard to the delight of all who at
tend.
As is the custom, fourteen dances
will be given, with the possibility of
some extras should time permit. A
special request has been made that
there be no carriages or flowers, and
the committee lias made arrangements
with the Peninsular Railway Company
to have cars running before and after
the dance.
The tickets will go on sale about the
middle of next month.
