# California Ties St. Mary's Team.
## 
### 
St. Mary's fifteen played an evenly
matched game with California's sec
ond team yesterday afternoon. The
result was a tie score after two thirty
minute halves on a slippery field.
Moth teams attempted passing rushes
during the first half, but the slippery
pigskin soon put a stop to this method
of yard gaining, and the battle was
fought in midfield.
California's failure to boot a field
goal from the twenty-five yard line
was the only approach to a tally by
either side.
