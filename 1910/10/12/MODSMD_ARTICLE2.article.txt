# MOB SCENE FEATURE OF "THE DEVIL'S DISCIPLE."
## 150 Persons Will Take Part in Final Act of Sword and Sandals Play. 
### 
The famous chariot scene in Ben
Hur, from a spectacular point of view,
will not compare to the tremendous
tableau which will be seen in the last
act of Sword and Sandals presenta
tion of "The Devil's Disciple." This
cleverly written play ends with a tense
dramatic scene. The concluding tab
leau shows the receipt of the news of
pardon just in time to avert the ex
ecution, while a huge crowd surronds
the foot of the scaffold awaiting the
death of the man whom they take to
be their enemy.
In order to present this scene with
the greatest effectiveness, it will be
necessary to have at least 150 people
in the act. This will be the greatest
number of persons who have ever ap
peared on the Assembly Hall stage at
one time. Students who desire to act
as supernumeraries in this scene,
should submit their names at once to
either R. Woodville, '11, or R. H. Sew
ard, '12.
The combined dramatic clubs. Sword
and Sandals and The Masquers, are
sparing no pains to make the presen
tation of Shaw's play an artistic suc
cess. Rehearsals are being conducted
twice a week under the direction of
Frank Mathieu, the well known dra
matic coach, and the cast is acquiring
great technical skill in the interpreta
tion of their parts. New sta*. ' settings
for the production are being construct
ed in San Francisco.
