# NESTORIA HOLDS DEBATE ON EDUCATIONAL MATTER.
## Affirmative Wins Contest, Preceded by an Impromptu Discussion of Interest. 
### 
Impromptu remarks preceeding the
set debate aroused much attention at
the meeting of Nestoria Literary So
ciety last night. Those who spoke
were M. B. Henshaw, '12, and A. G.
Bradford, '13, the latter taking for the
subject of his remarks, "Tlie Ethical
Aspects of Family Life." This was an
authoritative and stirring discourse.
The regular question for debate, "Re
solved, That the State Superintendent
of Schools, in California, should be ap
pointed by a school board elected by
the people, rather than by the present
system of election," was closely con
tested and interesting. The affirma
tive, which obtained the decision, was
represented by E. M. Albright, '12, and
K. Van Slyck, '11, the negative speak
ers being P. Eliel, '13, and J. W. How
ell, '12.
