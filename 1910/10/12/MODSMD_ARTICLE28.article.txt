### 
In a recent speech, William Jen
nings Bryan, the former Democratic
presidental candidate has made a vig
orous attack cn the practice of hazing
in the American colleges.
"Hazing," he said "is indefensible.
It is usually cowardly and always
emphasizes the physical at the expense
of the mental and moral man. It
should have no place among students
who are supposed to be high-minded
and to enter school with high ideals
and aspirations."
