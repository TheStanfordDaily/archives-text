Semi-final round —F. M. Douglass,
'13, ( — y 2 15), defeated H. Mann, '10,
(— 15), 6-3, 6-4.
P. M. Douglass, '13, It. L. Murray, '13,
and H. W. Dawson, '14, are the players
who are to contest for the champion
ship in the first handicap tennis tour
nament. Douglass has already reach
ed the finals, having defeated H. Mann,
'10, in the semi-final round.
Murray and Dawson have been un
able to play their match on account
of the inclement weather. The contest
between these two should be one of
the most exciting matches of the
tournament. Both are capable of put
ting up a fast grade of tennis and are
at present playing in best form. Mur
ray was a member of last year's Var
sity team and made an excellent show
ing against H. Long of California. He
also won the Theile Handicap Tourna
ment last fall. Dawson is a first year
man, but has had plenty of tournament
experience. He is the Interscholastic
Champion of Southern California and
with Melville Long, holds the State
doubles title.
Whichever man wins the semi-final
match, he will meet a foe worthy of
his mettle in the final round where he
plays against Douglass. Douglass is
a transfer this year from Occidental
College and has never before taken
part in any local tournaments, but
the easy fashion in which he disposed
of the veteran Mann has placed him on
a par with the older material.

The winner of this tournament will
receive a handsome Wright and Ditson
racket, which has been generously
donated by the Stanford Bookstore,
and is now on exhibition there. The
results of the third, fourth and semi
final rounds follow:
