# INDEFINITE SUSPENSION GIVEN PILFERING STUDENT.
## Student Affairs Committee Deals Summary Justice to Pocket Picker at Training House. 
### 
"At a meeting of the Committee on
Student Affairs held today, a student,
for the offense of taking money from
the clothing of his fellow students,
was suspended from the University for
an indefinite period.
(Signed) A. B. CLARK, Chairman."
The above action taken by the Stu
dent Affairs Committee at their regu
lar meeting held this morning, comes
as a result of a systematic pilfering of
pockets of clothes belonging to the
men who use the training house dur
ing the hours of rugby practice. For
some time past, small sums have been
missed by athletes out for football,
and so insistent have been the com
plaints, that a watchout was kept for
the thief, with the result that he was
caught in the act of going through the
clothing of fellow students. When
brought before the faculty committee
he made a complete confession.
