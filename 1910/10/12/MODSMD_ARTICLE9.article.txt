# E.C. MERCER TO AGAIN VISIT STANFORD CAMPUS.
## Y.M.C.A. Man to Repeat Work of Two Years Ago Aided by Harvard Man. 
### 
Men who are now Seniors and Jun
iors in the University will remember
the visit of E. C. Mercer two years ago,
and will be interested to learn that
word has just been received to the ef
fect that he will be at Stanford again
in January of next year. Mercer's
work created great interest during his
previous visit, both in his personal
efforts among the men in a religious
line and in the several meetings he
addressed in Encina Hall and the
Chapel, where he told of his experi
ences while leading a degenerate life.
He is one of the most prominent of
those in the Y. M. C. A. who are work
ing for the betterment of young men.
It is under the auspices of this organi
zation that he will visit Stanford, and
General Secretary D. W. Weist, '05, is
already making plans to utilize every
minute of the four days he will spend
here. He is to be accompanied by E.
C. Carter, Harvard '09, also a promin
ent Y. M. C. A. worker, and their meet
ings on the campus will be a part of a
general tour down the Pacific Coast.
