# Freshmen Chosen for the Intercollegiate Game
## Several Positions Are Bitterly Contested. A Light Team to Face California on Saturday. 
### 
The fifteen men who will take part
in the initial line up against the Uni
versity of California Freshmen next
Saturday afternoon were selected by
Coach Presley this afternoon. There
were several positions that were close
ly contested and the ultimate decision
could not be determined until the team
was eventually announced. Substi
tutes were also chosen to take places
on the side lines.
The captain and far and away the
most powerful player on the team is
Edward Parsons Geissler, of Los An
geles. He learned rugby in the south
ern country and played with the Cast
aways there. He also captained the
Los Angeles High School team. As a
kicker he is Varsity material, and has
made a record for himself by inarvel
ous spirals. He will probably do most
of the kicking against California. At
wing he will excel. Geissler is 19
years old. He marks up a weight of
165 pounds, and is 5 feet, 7 inches iu
height. He is a member of Zeta Psi
and is a Pre-Legal major.
Ray Milton Brown, a resident, of Sel
ma, has been one of the fixtures on the
team during the preliminary season at
front rank. And he has deserved his
place. He is a great steadier of the
pack at the hook position and is quick
to break away and follow the ball. He
is one of the most dependable men in
the pack. Brown prepared at Selma
High. He weighs 152 pounds, is 18
years of age, and is 5 feet, 9*4 inches
tall. He majors in Mechanical Engi
neering and is a member of the Encina
Club.
A worthy mate of Brown at front
rank is Waldemar Jacob Barman, of
Los Angeles. He is one of the two or
three quick-footed battlers in the
scrum. He has never been known to
lag behind. Barman is another player
who prepared for Stanford at Los
Angeles High School, and he help.! to
make the total of men from the
southern city a large one. 19 years is
his age, and he tips the scales at 160,
with a height of 5 feet, 10 inches.
Barman's major study is Pre-Legal
and is enrolled in the Theta Delta Chi
fraternity.

The only real giant in the fifteen is
Clarence Edward Olmstead, who en
tered Stanford from Los Angeles, hav
ing prepared at Harvard Military
School. He is the team's heaviest and
tallest man, and also has the distinc
| tion of being the only "200" man
! among the Freshmen players, his
i weight being 205. Olmstead at lock is,
lin reality and figuratively the very
center of the scrum. His quality of
steadiness adds confidence in abun
dance. He is 6 feet, 1 inch in height,
and is 20 years old. As a major he has
chosen Geology and Mining and he is
I a member of Kappa Sigma.
Philip Petrie Clover is an unspec
| tacular, sure-going player, who can be
I depended upon to do his duty at side
| rank. He is a valuable man in ruck
: ing and can take a hand in passing
rushes when need arises. He is an-
I other Los Angelean, having taken his
preparatory work at Alhamhra High
School. Clover has a weight of 155,
i is IS years old, and stands 5 feet, 10V&
I inches. His major is Civil Engineer
; ing. tie belongs to Delta Kappa
! Epsilon.
At side rank is a man who fights to
I his last gasj), Fred Bradshaw Wat
kins, who comes here from Los Ange
les. His 6 feet, % inches of stature
looms u]) in the line-outs, and his work
j there is noted. His capacity of keep-
I ing at a thing until he gets there has
I brought him to grief and into the
hands of "Dad" Moulton in several
garnei of the preliminary season. He
weighs 167 pounds and is 21 years old.
His major is Chemistry.
Frank Jacob Gard, of Glendora, is a
rear ranker who has made good in the
i last two weeks, and as a fighter al
j ways alert, there is no one to excel
; him in the pack. Although he has but
150 pounds credited to him in weight,
yet he holds his own as a pusher.
• Gard is IS years old and is 5 feet, ll 1 ,&
| inches in height. He is a member of
the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity and
majors in Zoology.
Clark Lewis Boulware, the lithe,
cool-headed mate of Gard in rear rank,
is one of the few men in the Freshman
forward division who have learned

some of the essentials of the gentle art
of dribbling. He has also on the
credit side the title of the most light
footed member of the scrum. He fols
lows up with speed and ease and fur
nishes the opposing half in particular
much trouble. He is 21 years old,
weighs 150, is 5 feet 10M inches in
height and hails from Palo Alto. His
major is Chemistry.
William Pettigrew Darsie is the
other of the pair of Palo Altans who
have places on the fifteen. Like Boul
ware, he is always at the point needed,
and as a wing forward, is one of the
cleverest ever seen among first year
players. One of his many qualities is
that of detecting trick plays, and
blocking kicks. Darsie is also a goal
kicker of much skill, and he will prob
ably share that work in the California
game with Geissler. He is 5 feet, 11
inches tall, has a weight of 160 pounds,
and is 19 years old. History is his
major, and be has membership in the
Phi Kappa Psi fraternity.
A man who, besides being one of the
youngest, lightest and shortest men on
the fifteen, combines with this the
ability for bulldog tenacity and alert
ness is Lloyd Irvine Tilton, the Cardi
nal Freshman half back. He is the
most active player of all the squad and
is always at the playing of the game.
He i,s a native of Bakersfield, where he
attended the High School. He majors
in the Pre-Legal department and is a
member of Delta Chi. 18 years is his
age, and he has weight of 140, with a
height of 5 feet, 7 inches.
The first five-eights will be Philip
Frederick Harrigan, of Los Angeles,
another Los Angeles High School
player. Harrigan has come to the
front only in the last half of the sea
son, but he has taken great strides in
getting to the front. He is a fighter
all through and it is a hard thing to
keep him off his feet. He much re
sembles Tilton in this respect. Har
! rigan tips the beam at 150 and is 19
years old. His height is put down as
| 5 feet C t y 2 inches. Beta Theta Pi en
j rolls him as a member. His major is
j Economics.
An almost indespensible player on
the fifteen is Frank Wixom Reeves at
j second five. He forges ahead in passing
' rushes in a truly remarkable way. His
' speed has caused him many a hard
fall at the hands of a tackier, but he is
fearless. His weight is 145, and his

height, 5 feet, San Bernardino is
his home, and his major study is Civil
Engineering. Sigma Nu fraternity en
rolls him as a member.
Glen Henry Mitchel has been nnder
the necessity of learning the intrica
cies of the backfield in less than ten
days. He was making a name for him
self in the scrnm, when Coach Presley
placed him at center three-quarters to
till a much needed want. He had all
the necessary qualifications, and only
required practice to make him a
finished product among the backs.
Mitchel is one of the largest men in
the backfield, being 5 feet 11% inches
in height and of 185 pounds weight.
He is IS years old. Los Angeles is his
home, and his major is Economics.
He has membership in Kappa Sigma.
As the wing to balance Geissler,
Elwin Benoni Hall has been chosen.
He has been tried at several positions
in the backfield, but was found to fit
in best at the wing three-quarter cita
del. He has learned the unusual re
sponsibilities of a wing and will be
depended upon to carry out his share
of the backfield duty on Saturday.
Hall hails from Los Angeles, and
majors in Geology. His weight is 155
pounds, his height 5 feet, 8% inches
and his age, 19 years. He is a member
of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity.
A full back to be depended upon is
one of the best parts of the rugby
machine, and that part is filled uner
ringly and surely by Karl Ferris
Kauffman, who, although small, is ever
on the watch and who is always to be
relied upon as a last defense. He is
only 5 feet, 9 inches in height. His
weight is 154 pounds and his age 20
years. Los Angeles increases the
southern total of team members by
having him as a native. As a major
he has. Electrical Engineering and
Delta Kappa Epsilon enrolls him.

were several positions that were close
ly contested and the ultimate decision
could not be determined until the team
was eventually announced. Substi
tutes were also chosen to take places
on the side lines.
The captain and far and away the
most powerful player on the team is
Edward Parsons Geissler, of Los An
geles. He learned rugby in the south
ern country and played with the Cast
aways there. He also captained the
Los Angeles High School team. As a
kicker he is Varsity material, and has
made a record for himself by inarvel

years old. He marks up a weight of
165 pounds, and is 5 feet, 7 inches iu
height. He is a member of Zeta Psi
and is a Pre-Legal major.
Ray Milton Brown, a resident, of Sel
ma, has been one of the fixtures on the
team during the preliminary season at
front rank. And he has deserved his
place. He is a great steadier of the
pack at the hook position and is quick
to break away and follow the ball. He
is one of the most dependable men in
the pack. Brown prepared at Selma
High. He weighs 152 pounds, is 18
years of age, and is 5 feet, 9*4 inches
tall. He majors in Mechanical Engi
neering and is a member of the Encina
Club.
A worthy mate of Brown at front
rank is Waldemar Jacob Barman, of
Los Angeles. He is one of the two or
three quick-footed battlers in the
scrum. He has never been known to
lag behind. Barman is another player
who prepared for Stanford at Los
Angeles High School, and he help.! to
make the total of men from the
southern city a large one. 19 years is
his age, and he tips the scales at 160,
with a height of 5 feet, 10 inches.
Barman's major study is Pre-Legal
and is enrolled in the Theta Delta Chi
fraternity.

The only real giant in the fifteen is
Clarence Edward Olmstead, who en
tered Stanford from Los Angeles, hav
ing prepared at Harvard Military
School. He is the team's heaviest and
tallest man, and also has the distinc
| tion of being the only "200" man
! among the Freshmen players, his
i weight being 205. Olmstead at lock is,
lin reality and figuratively the very
center of the scrum. His quality of
steadiness adds confidence in abun
dance. He is 6 feet, 1 inch in height,
and is 20 years old. As a major he has
chosen Geology and Mining and he is
I a member of Kappa Sigma.
Philip Petrie Clover is an unspec
| tacular, sure-going player, who can be
I depended upon to do his duty at side
| rank. He is a valuable man in ruck
: ing and can take a hand in passing
rushes when need arises. He is an-
I other Los Angelean, having taken his
preparatory work at Alhamhra High
School. Clover has a weight of 155,
i is IS years old, and stands 5 feet, 10V&
I inches. His major is Civil Engineer
; ing. tie belongs to Delta Kappa
! Epsilon.
At side rank is a man who fights to
I his last gasj), Fred Bradshaw Wat
kins, who comes here from Los Ange
les. His 6 feet, % inches of stature
looms u]) in the line-outs, and his work
j there is noted. His capacity of keep-
I ing at a thing until he gets there has
I brought him to grief and into the
hands of "Dad" Moulton in several
garnei of the preliminary season. He
weighs 167 pounds and is 21 years old.
His major is Chemistry.
Frank Jacob Gard, of Glendora, is a
rear ranker who has made good in the
i last two weeks, and as a fighter al
j ways alert, there is no one to excel
; him in the pack. Although he has but
150 pounds credited to him in weight,
yet he holds his own as a pusher.
• Gard is IS years old and is 5 feet, ll 1 ,&
| inches in height. He is a member of
the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity and
majors in Zoology.
Clark Lewis Boulware, the lithe,
cool-headed mate of Gard in rear rank,
is one of the few men in the Freshman
forward division who have learned

some of the essentials of the gentle art
of dribbling. He has also on the
credit side the title of the most light
footed member of the scrum. He fols
lows up with speed and ease and fur
nishes the opposing half in particular
much trouble. He is 21 years old,
weighs 150, is 5 feet 10M inches in
height and hails from Palo Alto. His
major is Chemistry.
William Pettigrew Darsie is the
other of the pair of Palo Altans who
have places on the fifteen. Like Boul
ware, he is always at the point needed,
and as a wing forward, is one of the
cleverest ever seen among first year
players. One of his many qualities is
that of detecting trick plays, and
blocking kicks. Darsie is also a goal
kicker of much skill, and he will prob
ably share that work in the California
game with Geissler. He is 5 feet, 11
inches tall, has a weight of 160 pounds,
and is 19 years old. History is his
major, and be has membership in the
Phi Kappa Psi fraternity.
A man who, besides being one of the
youngest, lightest and shortest men on
the fifteen, combines with this the
ability for bulldog tenacity and alert
ness is Lloyd Irvine Tilton, the Cardi
nal Freshman half back. He is the
most active player of all the squad and
is always at the playing of the game.
He i,s a native of Bakersfield, where he
attended the High School. He majors
in the Pre-Legal department and is a
member of Delta Chi. 18 years is his
age, and he has weight of 140, with a
height of 5 feet, 7 inches.
The first five-eights will be Philip
Frederick Harrigan, of Los Angeles,
another Los Angeles High School
player. Harrigan has come to the
front only in the last half of the sea
son, but he has taken great strides in
getting to the front. He is a fighter
all through and it is a hard thing to
keep him off his feet. He much re
sembles Tilton in this respect. Har
! rigan tips the beam at 150 and is 19
years old. His height is put down as
| 5 feet C t y 2 inches. Beta Theta Pi en
j rolls him as a member. His major is
j Economics.
An almost indespensible player on
the fifteen is Frank Wixom Reeves at
j second five. He forges ahead in passing
' rushes in a truly remarkable way. His
' speed has caused him many a hard
fall at the hands of a tackier, but he is
fearless. His weight is 145, and his

height, 5 feet, San Bernardino is
his home, and his major study is Civil
Engineering. Sigma Nu fraternity en
rolls him as a member.
Glen Henry Mitchel has been nnder
the necessity of learning the intrica
cies of the backfield in less than ten
days. He was making a name for him
self in the scrnm, when Coach Presley
placed him at center three-quarters to
till a much needed want. He had all
the necessary qualifications, and only
required practice to make him a
finished product among the backs.

the backfield, being 5 feet 11% inches
in height and of 185 pounds weight.
He is IS years old. Los Angeles is his
home, and his major is Economics.

As the wing to balance Geissler,
Elwin Benoni Hall has been chosen.
He has been tried at several positions
in the backfield, but was found to fit
in best at the wing three-quarter cita
del. He has learned the unusual re
sponsibilities of a wing and will be
depended upon to carry out his share
of the backfield duty on Saturday.
Hall hails from Los Angeles, and
majors in Geology. His weight is 155
pounds, his height 5 feet, 8% inches
and his age, 19 years. He is a member
of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity.
A full back to be depended upon is
one of the best parts of the rugby
machine, and that part is filled uner
ringly and surely by Karl Ferris
Kauffman, who, although small, is ever
on the watch and who is always to be
relied upon as a last defense. He is
only 5 feet, 9 inches in height. His
weight is 154 pounds and his age 20
years. Los Angeles increases the
southern total of team members by
having him as a native. As a major

were several positions that were close
ly contested and the ultimate decision
could not be determined until the team
was eventually announced. Substi
tutes were also chosen to take places
on the side lines.
The captain and far and away the
most powerful player on the team is
Edward Parsons Geissler, of Los An
geles. He learned rugby in the south
ern country and played with the Cast
aways there. He also captained the
Los Angeles High School team. As a
kicker he is Varsity material, and has

years old. He marks up a weight of
165 pounds, and is 5 feet, 7 inches iu
height. He is a member of Zeta Psi

Ray Milton Brown, a resident, of Sel
ma, has been one of the fixtures on the
team during the preliminary season at
front rank. And he has deserved his
place. He is a great steadier of the
pack at the hook position and is quick
to break away and follow the ball. He
is one of the most dependable men in
the pack. Brown prepared at Selma
High. He weighs 152 pounds, is 18
years of age, and is 5 feet, 9*4 inches
tall. He majors in Mechanical Engi
neering and is a member of the Encina
Club.
A worthy mate of Brown at front
rank is Waldemar Jacob Barman, of
Los Angeles. He is one of the two or
three quick-footed battlers in the
scrum. He has never been known to
lag behind. Barman is another player
who prepared for Stanford at Los
Angeles High School, and he help.! to
make the total of men from the
southern city a large one. 19 years is
his age, and he tips the scales at 160,
with a height of 5 feet, 10 inches.
Barman's major study is Pre-Legal
and is enrolled in the Theta Delta Chi
fraternity.

The only real giant in the fifteen is
Clarence Edward Olmstead, who en
tered Stanford from Los Angeles, hav
ing prepared at Harvard Military
School. He is the team's heaviest and
tallest man, and also has the distinc
| tion of being the only "200" man
! among the Freshmen players, his
i weight being 205. Olmstead at lock is,
lin reality and figuratively the very
center of the scrum. His quality of
steadiness adds confidence in abun
dance. He is 6 feet, 1 inch in height,
and is 20 years old. As a major he has
chosen Geology and Mining and he is
I a member of Kappa Sigma.
Philip Petrie Clover is an unspec
| tacular, sure-going player, who can be
I depended upon to do his duty at side
| rank. He is a valuable man in ruck
: ing and can take a hand in passing
rushes when need arises. He is an-
I other Los Angelean, having taken his
preparatory work at Alhamhra High
School. Clover has a weight of 155,
i is IS years old, and stands 5 feet, 10V&
I inches. His major is Civil Engineer
; ing. tie belongs to Delta Kappa
! Epsilon.
At side rank is a man who fights to
I his last gasj), Fred Bradshaw Wat
kins, who comes here from Los Ange
les. His 6 feet, % inches of stature
looms u]) in the line-outs, and his work
j there is noted. His capacity of keep-
I ing at a thing until he gets there has
I brought him to grief and into the
hands of "Dad" Moulton in several
garnei of the preliminary season. He
weighs 167 pounds and is 21 years old.
His major is Chemistry.
Frank Jacob Gard, of Glendora, is a
rear ranker who has made good in the
i last two weeks, and as a fighter al
j ways alert, there is no one to excel
; him in the pack. Although he has but
150 pounds credited to him in weight,
yet he holds his own as a pusher.
• Gard is IS years old and is 5 feet, ll 1 ,&
| inches in height. He is a member of
the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity and
majors in Zoology.
Clark Lewis Boulware, the lithe,
cool-headed mate of Gard in rear rank,
is one of the few men in the Freshman
forward division who have learned

some of the essentials of the gentle art
of dribbling. He has also on the
credit side the title of the most light
footed member of the scrum. He fols
lows up with speed and ease and fur
nishes the opposing half in particular
much trouble. He is 21 years old,
weighs 150, is 5 feet 10M inches in
height and hails from Palo Alto. His
major is Chemistry.
William Pettigrew Darsie is the
other of the pair of Palo Altans who
have places on the fifteen. Like Boul
ware, he is always at the point needed,
and as a wing forward, is one of the
cleverest ever seen among first year
players. One of his many qualities is
that of detecting trick plays, and
blocking kicks. Darsie is also a goal
kicker of much skill, and he will prob
ably share that work in the California
game with Geissler. He is 5 feet, 11
inches tall, has a weight of 160 pounds,
and is 19 years old. History is his
major, and be has membership in the
Phi Kappa Psi fraternity.
A man who, besides being one of the
youngest, lightest and shortest men on
the fifteen, combines with this the
ability for bulldog tenacity and alert
ness is Lloyd Irvine Tilton, the Cardi
nal Freshman half back. He is the
most active player of all the squad and
is always at the playing of the game.
He i,s a native of Bakersfield, where he
attended the High School. He majors
in the Pre-Legal department and is a
member of Delta Chi. 18 years is his
age, and he has weight of 140, with a
height of 5 feet, 7 inches.
The first five-eights will be Philip
Frederick Harrigan, of Los Angeles,
another Los Angeles High School
player. Harrigan has come to the
front only in the last half of the sea
son, but he has taken great strides in
getting to the front. He is a fighter
all through and it is a hard thing to
keep him off his feet. He much re
sembles Tilton in this respect. Har
! rigan tips the beam at 150 and is 19
years old. His height is put down as
| 5 feet C t y 2 inches. Beta Theta Pi en
j rolls him as a member. His major is
j Economics.
An almost indespensible player on
the fifteen is Frank Wixom Reeves at
j second five. He forges ahead in passing
' rushes in a truly remarkable way. His
' speed has caused him many a hard
fall at the hands of a tackier, but he is
fearless. His weight is 145, and his

height, 5 feet, San Bernardino is
his home, and his major study is Civil
Engineering. Sigma Nu fraternity en
rolls him as a member.
Glen Henry Mitchel has been nnder
the necessity of learning the intrica
cies of the backfield in less than ten
days. He was making a name for him
self in the scrnm, when Coach Presley
placed him at center three-quarters to
till a much needed want. He had all
the necessary qualifications, and only
required practice to make him a
finished product among the backs.

Frederick Harrigan, of Los Angeles,
another Los Angeles High School
player. Harrigan has come to the
front only in the last half of the sea
son, but he has taken great strides in
getting to the front. He is a fighter
all through and it is a hard thing to
keep him off his feet. He much re
sembles Tilton in this respect. Har
! rigan tips the beam at 150 and is 19
years old. His height is put down as
| 5 feet C t y 2 inches. Beta Theta Pi en
j rolls him as a member. His major is

fall at the hands of a tackier, but he is
fearless. His weight is 145, and his

height, 5 feet, San Bernardino is
his home, and his major study is Civil
Engineering. Sigma Nu fraternity en
rolls him as a member.
Glen Henry Mitchel has been nnder
the necessity of learning the intrica
cies of the backfield in less than ten
days. He was making a name for him
self in the scrnm, when Coach Presley
placed him at center three-quarters to
till a much needed want. He had all
the necessary qualifications, and only
required practice to make him a
finished product among the backs.
Mitchel is one of the largest men in
the backfield, being 5 feet 11% inches
in height and of 185 pounds weight.
He is IS years old. Los Angeles is his
home, and his major is Economics.
He has membership in Kappa Sigma.
As the wing to balance Geissler,
Elwin Benoni Hall has been chosen.
He has been tried at several positions
in the backfield, but was found to fit
in best at the wing three-quarter cita
del. He has learned the unusual re
sponsibilities of a wing and will be
depended upon to carry out his share
of the backfield duty on Saturday.
Hall hails from Los Angeles, and
majors in Geology. His weight is 155
pounds, his height 5 feet, 8% inches
and his age, 19 years. He is a member
of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity.
A full back to be depended upon is
one of the best parts of the rugby
machine, and that part is filled uner
ringly and surely by Karl Ferris
Kauffman, who, although small, is ever
on the watch and who is always to be
relied upon as a last defense. He is
only 5 feet, 9 inches in height. His
weight is 154 pounds and his age 20
years. Los Angeles increases the
southern total of team members by
having him as a native. As a major

Coach Presley this afternoon. There
were several positions that were close
ly contested and the ultimate decision
could not be determined until the team
was eventually announced. Substi
tutes were also chosen to take places
on the side lines.
The captain and far and away the
most powerful player on the team is
Edward Parsons Geissler, of Los An
geles. He learned rugby in the south
ern country and played with the Cast
aways there. He also captained the
Los Angeles High School team. As a
kicker he is Varsity material, and has

165 pounds, and is 5 feet, 7 inches iu
height. He is a member of Zeta Psi
and is a Pre-Legal major.
Ray Milton Brown, a resident, of Sel
ma, has been one of the fixtures on the
team during the preliminary season at
front rank. And he has deserved his
place. He is a great steadier of the
pack at the hook position and is quick
to break away and follow the ball. He
is one of the most dependable men in
the pack. Brown prepared at Selma
High. He weighs 152 pounds, is 18
years of age, and is 5 feet, 9*4 inches
tall. He majors in Mechanical Engi
neering and is a member of the Encina
Club.
A worthy mate of Brown at front
rank is Waldemar Jacob Barman, of
Los Angeles. He is one of the two or
three quick-footed battlers in the
scrum. He has never been known to
lag behind. Barman is another player
who prepared for Stanford at Los
Angeles High School, and he help.! to
make the total of men from the
southern city a large one. 19 years is
his age, and he tips the scales at 160,
with a height of 5 feet, 10 inches.
Barman's major study is Pre-Legal
and is enrolled in the Theta Delta Chi
fraternity.

The only real giant in the fifteen is
Clarence Edward Olmstead, who en
tered Stanford from Los Angeles, hav
ing prepared at Harvard Military
School. He is the team's heaviest and
tallest man, and also has the distinc
| tion of being the only "200" man
! among the Freshmen players, his
i weight being 205. Olmstead at lock is,
lin reality and figuratively the very
center of the scrum. His quality of
steadiness adds confidence in abun
dance. He is 6 feet, 1 inch in height,
and is 20 years old. As a major he has
chosen Geology and Mining and he is
I a member of Kappa Sigma.
Philip Petrie Clover is an unspec
| tacular, sure-going player, who can be
I depended upon to do his duty at side
| rank. He is a valuable man in ruck
: ing and can take a hand in passing
rushes when need arises. He is an-
I other Los Angelean, having taken his
preparatory work at Alhamhra High
School. Clover has a weight of 155,
i is IS years old, and stands 5 feet, 10V&
I inches. His major is Civil Engineer
; ing. tie belongs to Delta Kappa
! Epsilon.
At side rank is a man who fights to
I his last gasj), Fred Bradshaw Wat
kins, who comes here from Los Ange
les. His 6 feet, % inches of stature
looms u]) in the line-outs, and his work
j there is noted. His capacity of keep-
I ing at a thing until he gets there has
I brought him to grief and into the
hands of "Dad" Moulton in several
garnei of the preliminary season. He
weighs 167 pounds and is 21 years old.
His major is Chemistry.
Frank Jacob Gard, of Glendora, is a
rear ranker who has made good in the
i last two weeks, and as a fighter al
j ways alert, there is no one to excel
; him in the pack. Although he has but
150 pounds credited to him in weight,
yet he holds his own as a pusher.
• Gard is IS years old and is 5 feet, ll 1 ,&
| inches in height. He is a member of
the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity and
majors in Zoology.
Clark Lewis Boulware, the lithe,
cool-headed mate of Gard in rear rank,
is one of the few men in the Freshman
forward division who have learned

some of the essentials of the gentle art
of dribbling. He has also on the
credit side the title of the most light
footed member of the scrum. He fols
lows up with speed and ease and fur
nishes the opposing half in particular
much trouble. He is 21 years old,
weighs 150, is 5 feet 10M inches in
height and hails from Palo Alto. His
major is Chemistry.
William Pettigrew Darsie is the
other of the pair of Palo Altans who
have places on the fifteen. Like Boul
ware, he is always at the point needed,
and as a wing forward, is one of the
cleverest ever seen among first year
players. One of his many qualities is
that of detecting trick plays, and
blocking kicks. Darsie is also a goal
kicker of much skill, and he will prob
ably share that work in the California
game with Geissler. He is 5 feet, 11
inches tall, has a weight of 160 pounds,
and is 19 years old. History is his
major, and be has membership in the
Phi Kappa Psi fraternity.
A man who, besides being one of the
youngest, lightest and shortest men on

ability for bulldog tenacity and alert
ness is Lloyd Irvine Tilton, the Cardi
nal Freshman half back. He is the
most active player of all the squad and
is always at the playing of the game.
He i,s a native of Bakersfield, where he
attended the High School. He majors
in the Pre-Legal department and is a
member of Delta Chi. 18 years is his
