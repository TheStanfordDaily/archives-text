# Congress Springs Concert.
## 
### 
The Peninsular Railway Company
lias arranged an especially attractive
series of concerts to l:e given at Con
gress Springs on Sunday afternoons.
In addition to the full military hand of
the Coast Artillery Corps, there will
he a stringed orchestra to accompany
the vocal solos of Prof. Schalkhammer.
At the concert given last Sunday, Prof.
Schalkhammer so delighted the audi
ence that many encores were called
for, to which he cheerfully responded.
His voice is at once strong and sweet
and, in addition, he has that touch of
magnetism which carries his inter
pretation straight to the heart of his
heavers and rouses them to enthusi
asm. There is t\o doubt these concerts
will be largely attended. No charge
is made, and excursion tickets to the
Springs and return may he procured
at the Peninsular offices.
