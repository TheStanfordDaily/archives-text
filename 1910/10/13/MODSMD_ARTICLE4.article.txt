According to Trainer "Dad" Moul
ton, but very few Freshmen have as
yet signified their iutention of taking
part in fall track training. Further
more, some of those first year men
who have already signed for this early
work have been very inconsistent
and thoughtless in the observation of
their training. A short season during
the fall months is conducted princi
pally for the benefit of the Freshmen
in order that they may accomplish
much of the hard and tedious drilling
that accompanies a season's training
before the spring months. Several
meets have been contemplated and
tentative plans concerning them have
already been made. These efforts are
all for the purpose of improving and
advancing the men who are new upon
the track, and who above all need the
training. Yet they are the very ones
who do not take advantage of their
opportunity. What the Stanford Fresh
man teams lack in numerical strength,
they must make up in strength and
individual efficiency. To improve this
individual work and to create as
strong a track team as possible for the
coming season, the Freshmen should
take this opportunity to come out
upon the track for actual work.
