(fame Saturday will he, but 1 do know
that the men composing this team are
lighters. . Whether, the .game .goes
against us from the start or not, these
fifteen men will he there all the way.
We have an even break, and that is ail
a Stanford team can ask for." —Coach
(«eorge l'resloy.
With these ringing words, the man
who has taught the game of rugby to
the Freshman team concluded his ad
dress at the big send off to the first
year men last night. Assuring the
members of the University that the
men chosen to represent them in the
coming contest would i>lay the game
fair and hard, Presley voiced the de
termination of the Freshmen players
to uphold the reputation of Stanford
in the line of clean sport.
The big auditorium was early
packed to its utmost with enthusiastic
students, anxious to show their con
fidence in the 1914 team and to en
courage them in the task which con
fronts them on Saturday. The athletes
marched into the hall at 7:45 and
were welcomed by round after round
of cheers.
Immediately after the tremendous
burst of applause which greeted the
members of the team had subsided,

Student Body President G. A. Ditz
mounted the platform and in a few
well-chosen words told the men what
the game on Saturday means to the
University, and to the players. In
part, he said: "You men of the Fresh
man team for the first time have that
feeling of representing Stanford. For
the privilege of representing this Uni
versity we expect you to fight hard.
From the first whistle —fisht, that is
what the Student Body asks of
you."

ogy department, and Professor E. B.
Krehbiel of the History department,
represented the faculty at the rally.
"Dad" Moulton was unable to attend,
but there was no dearth of stories on
that account. Professor Krehbiel kept
everyone in good humor by the witty
anecdotes which he recounted. He
likened the game on Saturday to an
examination in which the fifteen men
clad in blue will be the examiners,
but expressed his belief in the ability
of Presley's Freshman Class to pass
with honors.
After the rally a serpentine was
danced upon the Inner Quad. Tne
