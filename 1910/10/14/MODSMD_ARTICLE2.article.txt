# FRESHMEN WILL CLOSE THEIR SEASON WITH HARD BATTLE
## 
### 
"We expect n hard tight."—Coach
(*eorge .1. Presley,
Two hours and a halt" after the sun
has crossed the meridian tomorrow,
the crowd gathered together on the
Stanford bleachers will witness what
promises to be one of the most closely
contested football matches ever fought
between the first year men wearing
the Cardinal and the Mine and Gold.
Six Octobers ago the Cardinal Fresh
men met defeat at the hands of the
Blue and Gold Freshmen on California
Field, which set a precedent for
the following three years. Last fall
the 1013 aggregation made a pilgri
mage to California and changed the
course of events by returning with th ■
"Bear's" scalp. Will the Freshmen
l!tl ! accomplish the same feat?
The baby squad, even on the first
day of practice, was very small when
compared with the avala iche of mn
turned out in the foggy city across tin;
bay, in answer to the coach's call.
Hut what they lackod in unmbers was
more than made up by the fighting
Cardinal spirit, which Coach Presley
quickly instilled into the willing
Freshmen.
Such p. combination of brilliant
players as Gslssler, Harrigan, Darsie
and Boulware are seldom neon in the
line-up of a Freshmen team. Hut that
is not all, behind them there is a team,
a team whore playing makes possible
the star plays of three or four of their
number. Those who form the stone
wall of defense, nevertheless when
their turn conies are to he found in
the right place and make the right
move. Such is the Freshman team of
1914.
Nor must we forget those other
members of the squad who did not
secure a place upon the team. A vic
tory tomorrow will be one which they
helped to bring about. Their willing
work against the first team during
the last few weeks is one of the great
est factors in turning out the team
that ha 3 the qualities of the fifteen,

j who will meet the fighters from Cali
! fornia.
j Both teams will use the 2-3-2 scrum
I formation tomorrow. Although last
I year's winning team used the 3-2-3
formation, the experience of the "All
Americans" in the Antipodes favors
the formation which will be used to
morrow.
As to the backs, the Cardinal's have
j shown greater speed and accuracy
whenever the leather oval has been in
their possession, but this seems to be
about balanced by the superiority of
the entire group of California men,
when it comes to making a clean
tackle.
This was clearly demonstrated when
the Stanford Freshmen were beaten by
a score of 13-0 in the last St. Mary's
contest, while the Blue and Gold
babies held the same team to an 8-0
score, a few days previously.
The following results tell the story
j of the various games played by both
Freshmen fifteens during the season:
