Since matrimony lias become epi
demic at. Stanford, the Schubert Club's
presentation of the Mikado may be
considered peculiarly appropriate.
Following are the reasons:
One Nanki-Poo, the son of a gentle
man called the Mikado of Japan, to
escape an offensive and defensive al
liance with an odious female named
Katisha, disguises himself as a wan
dering musician and leaves the pater
nal fire-side. While in this disguise,
Nanki-Poo falls in love with Yum-
Yum. The complications now begin,
for the young lady, Yum-Yum, is the
betrothed of Ko-Ko, Lord High Execu
tioner.
When Xanki-Poo receives the sad

tidings that there will be no connubial
happiness for him, he determines to
eliminate himself from this cruel
world. Ko-Ko, taking compassion on
Xaki-Poo ai) business was dull at that
time, proposes that the latter allow
himself to be publicly beheaded in
order to satisfy the Mikado's decree.
As Nanki-Poo has already lost his
head, he becomes reckless and con
sents.
In return for this kindness Ko-Ko
agrees to allow Nanki-Poo to enter a
trial marriage with Yum-Yum. Time
limit one month. Seeing the happi
ness of the two lovers, the Lord High
Executioner gives his consent to the
entanglement, and presents the certi
ficate of execution to the Mikado.
When the real identity of the min
strel is discovered, Ko-Ko demands
revenge, but is dissuaded from his fell
purpose by Katisha, now happy,
though married. Through the same
agency the Mikado is pacified and the
lovers live happily ever after.
The cast is composed of persons who
have attained reputations in the local
musical world, the leading roles be
ing filled by the best voices in the
University. The two principal charac
ters are those of Nanki-Poo, the way
ward son of the Mikado of Japan, and
Yum-Yum, who, although the affian
ced bride of the Lord High Execution
er. is really in love with the Prince.
11. B. McGuire, '13, will play the lead
ing part, while Miss Ruth Robertson,
'10, will appear in the opposite role.


Miss li. K. Ifobertson as "Yiihi-Yiiih '
Ilotli have had much experience in
operatic work.
The part of Katisha, a somewhat
elderly lady, whom the Mikado has
designated to be the bride of the
Prince, is filled by Miss Alberta Han
na, '11. Peep-Mo and Petti-Sing,
wards of the Lord High Executioner,
who figure prominently in the plot,
will be represented by Miss Irene
Burnside, '12, and Miss Dorothy Still
man, '12.
J.H. Forbes, '13, will handle the part
of the whimsical Ko-Ko, Lord High
Executioner of Titipu. This part of
fers ample opportunity for the talent
of Forbes to be exhibited. It is the
comedy role of the opera and the hum
orous acting and attractive songs of
the part have made it famous.
The Lord High of Everything Else
will be no other than A. L. Rockwood,
'11. The minor part of Pist-Tush will
be occupied by P. M. .Jones, '13, whose
clear voice and clever acting has
brought the part into prominence.
H. F. Dromell, '13, will be the only
man in the show who has the distinc
tion of possession a personal train
bearer. Bromell will play the part of
the Mikado. C. S. Turpin, '13, will lie
the person who follows in the Mika
do's train.

nal fire-side. While in this disguise,
Nanki-Poo falls in love with Yum-
Yum. The complications now begin,
for the young lady, Yum-Yum, is the
betrothed of Ko-Ko, Lord High Execu
tioner.
When Xanki-Poo receives the sad

tidings that there will be no connubial
happiness for him, he determines to
eliminate himself from this cruel
world. Ko-Ko, taking compassion on
Xaki-Poo ai) business was dull at that
time, proposes that the latter allow
himself to be publicly beheaded in
order to satisfy the Mikado's decree.
As Nanki-Poo has already lost his
head, he becomes reckless and con
sents.
In return for this kindness Ko-Ko
agrees to allow Nanki-Poo to enter a
trial marriage with Yum-Yum. Time
limit one month. Seeing the happi
ness of the two lovers, the Lord High
Executioner gives his consent to the
entanglement, and presents the certi
ficate of execution to the Mikado.
When the real identity of the min
strel is discovered, Ko-Ko demands
revenge, but is dissuaded from his fell
purpose by Katisha, now happy,
though married. Through the same
agency the Mikado is pacified and the
lovers live happily ever after.
The cast is composed of persons who
have attained reputations in the local
musical world, the leading roles be
ing filled by the best voices in the
University. The two principal charac
ters are those of Nanki-Poo, the way
ward son of the Mikado of Japan, and
Yum-Yum, who, although the affian
ced bride of the Lord High Execution
er. is really in love with the Prince.
11. B. McGuire, '13, will play the lead
ing part, while Miss Ruth Robertson,
'10, will appear in the opposite role.


Miss li. K. Ifobertson as "Yiihi-Yiiih '
Ilotli have had much experience in
operatic work.
The part of Katisha, a somewhat
elderly lady, whom the Mikado has
designated to be the bride of the
Prince, is filled by Miss Alberta Han
na, '11. Peep-Mo and Petti-Sing,
wards of the Lord High Executioner,
who figure prominently in the plot,
will be represented by Miss Irene
Burnside, '12, and Miss Dorothy Still
man, '12.
J.H. Forbes, '13, will handle the part
of the whimsical Ko-Ko, Lord High
Executioner of Titipu. This part of
fers ample opportunity for the talent
of Forbes to be exhibited. It is the
comedy role of the opera and the hum
orous acting and attractive songs of
the part have made it famous.
The Lord High of Everything Else
will be no other than A. L. Rockwood,
'11. The minor part of Pist-Tush will
be occupied by P. M. .Jones, '13, whose
clear voice and clever acting has
brought the part into prominence.
H. F. Dromell, '13, will be the only
man in the show who has the distinc

Since matrimony lias become epi

presentation of the Mikado may be
considered peculiarly appropriate.
Following are the reasons:
One Nanki-Poo, the son of a gentle
man called the Mikado of Japan, to
escape an offensive and defensive al
liance with an odious female named
Katisha, disguises himself as a wan
dering musician and leaves the pater
nal fire-side. While in this disguise,
Nanki-Poo falls in love with Yum-
Yum. The complications now begin,
for the young lady, Yum-Yum, is the
betrothed of Ko-Ko, Lord High Execu

tidings that there will be no connubial
happiness for him, he determines to
eliminate himself from this cruel
world. Ko-Ko, taking compassion on
