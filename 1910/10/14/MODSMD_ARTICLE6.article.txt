Stanford will lie represented tomor
row afternoon by a squad of men
worthy to wear the Cardinal sweaters,
and if they maintain individually the
records that they have made for them
selves throughout the season, there is
every reason to be proud of them
whether they are successful as victors
or end the game as losers tomorrow
afternoon. The Student Hodv has
given the team an evidence of its
spirit, its wish to assist the men while
they are on the field and of the trust
that it has placed in them. All that
Stanford asks in return is that they do
their utmost in a sportsmanlike man
ner. The University cannot ask more
