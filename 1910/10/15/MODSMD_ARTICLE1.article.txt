"l am absolutely satisfied with the
men, They fought hard. That's all
there is to it. It was a hard tight from
the start. Each nym played his j>i>si
tion well." —Coach George J. Presley.
A day overcast with threatening
clouds and a strong breeze blowing
from the bay did not portend especially
well for a large gathering of specta
tors nor a fast and accurately played
game. Notwithstanding the threaten
ing appearance of the elements, some
four thousand people assembled on the
bleachers to witness the contest.
A large crowd of enthusiastic root
ers travelled from Berkeley to cheer
for the Blue and Gold babies.
Led by the excellent cadet band, the
Californians made their presence man
ifest some time before the kick-off, and
continued unsubdued throughout the
game. Neither the weather nor the
progress of the game could lower their
spirits.
The fact that Stanford has at least
organized a band worthy of the name,
wa.s made evident by the way the local
organization rendered selections dur
ing the game. For several years past
a band in name only has existed here,
but today the result of the work of
the past semester was shown. Under
the guidance of Professor Martin, of
the Latin department, the band haj
developed into a highly competent
body, which more than held its own
today with Berkeley's competent mus
icians. Clad in their new red uni
forms, the men added much to the at
tractiveness of the scene.
The Cardinal sweaters of the Stan
ford babies appeared on the field at
2:45, and shortly after the Berkeley
team came on for its warm-up. Cheer
after cheer greeted the players, the
ovation to the Stanford team lasting
fully five minutes.
At exactly 2:52 the ball was kicked
off by California. The ball crossed the
gcal line on the kick off, allowing

Stanford a drop-out. From the return
of this kick California forced the play
near the Cardinal goal line. The pres
sure was relieved by a tremendously
spectacular run engineered by Reeves
and Geissler. After having traversed
the whole field they were called hack
by p. foul by California.
Stanford's defensive work when the
goal line was endangered was wonder
fully effective, rush after rush being
stopped up short. The backs played
with machine-like precision, finally
forcing the ball back over the center
lino.
Towards the end of the half Califor
nia slowed up its speedy pace and the
play was confined entirely to their
side of the field. Both teams defended
well, playing the game for all that
was in them. In the first half the
game was characterized by fast and
clever play. It is by far the scrappiest
match the Freshmen have put up.
Duncan Blair, a New Zealand rugby
veteran and coach of the San Jose
High School, refereed the game. C.
Cameron and L. S. Reading were the
touch judges. The timers were A.
Bowers and W. P. Fuller, Jr.

Cardinals on defensive, now ends both

minutes more to run. Tilton is fea
tured, his pretty boot finding touch
often. Exchange of kicks between
Allen and Kauffman sends the Cardi

en opportunities for Geissler's long
spirals. Ball is left at midfield at the
end of a no-score first half.

er's head is injured but bandaged. Is

A magnificent kick by Geissler again
brought the Cardinal machine within
talking distance of tha goal. On the
side lines near the Stanford bleachers
Harrigan and Hall went over for a try.
