"The ideals in force among Ameri
can representatives in the Philippines
are superior to any which have yet
controlled the pro-consuls of any
other lands," said Professor P. J.
Treat of the History department at the
close of his address before the Cos
mopolitan Club on the "Uplift in the
Philippines." The lecture, was listen
ed to with great interest and apprecia
tion by the audience. Professor Treat
said in part: "The work of the Phil
ippine Department of the Interior, un
der Dean C. Woorster, with its two
bureaus, those of Health and Science,
has been most remarkable. The first
named has made rapid strides in
stamping out the scourges of cholera,
bubonic plague, and leprosy, which
afflict the natives. The Bureau of
Science possesses a splendid labora
tory in Manilla, and it was here that
Dr. P. K. Oilman, the old Stanford
man, did the work which resulted in
his discovery of a cancer cure. One of
the many important lines of work
carried on by this bureau is the en
forcement of pure food laws, which
matter is in charge of a former Stan
ford instructor, Dr. Gibbs. The men
laboring for the betterment of this
land are facing grave problems. I
urge you to suspend judgment when
this work is subject to attack."
