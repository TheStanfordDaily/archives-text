# VARSITY WORSTS "OLD BOYS" IN FAST GAME.
## 
### 
Wearing wigs and beards, the Old
Hoys" met the Varsity this morning at
10:110 on the turf field. The Varsity
made all their tallies in the opening
half, the second period being devoted
to a shifting battle in which both sides
were on the point of scoring several
times. The changed character of the
game during the last half being due in
great part to a sixteenth man, Hicken,
whom the "Old Boys" introduced into
the game at this time. This free lance
played throughout the second half un
observed by the referee and his de
fence of openings in the 'Old Bo>s
line at crucial moments did much to
hold the Varsity.
Mitchell showed a return to his old
form, kicking both the rather difficult
goals, and was up to his par in buck
ing through the opponents' defense
for substantial gains. Erb got in his
usual difficult spirals to touch and
Cheda showed up among the forwards
in the dribbling rushes.
Five minutes after the game started
a free kick by Brown gave the ball to
a lineout at the "Old Boys' 25.
Scrums advanced the ball to their 5
and Cheda secured the pigskin for the
first try. Mitchell converted, making
the score 5-0.
After a contest at midfield, Stanford
advanced the ball to the old heroes' 25.
Here Cheda secured and by passing the
leather oval to Baumgartner, near the
line the second try was marked up and
upon Mitchell's conversion the score
board was made to read 10-0.
Stanford offside at the beginning of
the second half called a scrum at mid
field. This was offset by a free kick
by Brown, Jordan failing to secure,
gave the ball to Dole and Cheda went
into touch at "Old Boys" 15. A line
out carried ball to midfield and at
Stanford's 35, Decius and Drew in
passing rush advanced game to lineout
at 10.
The battle ebbed the ball to Peters
at 40, who went tearing through the
loose for 20 yards and passed to Pres
ley for the most sensational play and
try during the morning's scrummage.
Crawford failed to convert a difficult
goal. Final score, Stanford 10, "Old
