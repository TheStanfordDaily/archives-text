With this issue of the Daily Palo
Alto we are with much reluctance
forced to announce the resignation of
J. C. Thomas from the position of
Managing Editor and from the editor
ial staff of the paper. Thomas has
served as one of the most efficient men
who ever occupied a place on the
editorial staff, both in his literary
ability and in his willingness to work.
As an Assistant and as an Associate
editor he has been a valuable addition
to the staff and it is with much regret
that we remove his name from the roll.
