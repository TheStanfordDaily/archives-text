# TRACK MEN TO COMPETE IN PRELIMINARY MEETS.
## Captain S.H. Bellah is Concluding Plans for a Fall Schedule for Athletes. 
### 
The hard working track athletes,
who have turned out for fall training
will be given two opportunities to dis
tinguish themselves within the next
month or so. Captain Bellah i3 now
working on a plan whereby a picked
team of runners and field men will
travel to San Francisco to encounter
in a dual meet either the Olympic
Club Team or the members of the
Irish-American Athletic Association.
The Olympic Club is now gathering
together a galaxy of stars, who are to
represent the big San Francisco as
sociation in the championship contests
in New Orleans. Should Bellah be
successful in making connections, the
Cardinal men will have the opportun
ity of going up against some of the
best men at present on the coast, and

the team which will in all likelihood
annex the national championship.
Ab the meet will be merely for the
purpose of giving new men experience,
Captain Bellah will enter as many
Freshmen as show any condition or
form. This will be an excellent oppor
tunity for novices to gain invaluable
experience and all students who in
tend to take up track work are urged
to go into training immediately.
Shortly after the big game an inter
class meet will be held on the Varsity
track. The Freshmen entering in this
meet will have a great advantage over
their fellows who do not begin train
ing until the spring.
Trainer Moulton is especially dis
pleased with the small number of first
year men who have appeared on the
track this semester, and states that
from present indications it will take
much hard work in the spring to whip
into shape a creditable Freshman
track team.
