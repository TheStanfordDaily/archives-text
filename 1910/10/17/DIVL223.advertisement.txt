Gennaro D'Amico, the trumpet solo
ist of the Ellery Band, has been set
ting the music-lovers of Oakland and
Berkeley quite mad with the beauty of
his playing. An enthuiast of foreign
birth heard D'Amico play "The Last
Rose of Summer" the other night and
exclaimed delightedly that he played it
every bit as well as Patti used to sing
it. D'Amico will be heard here in the
duet from Verdi's "Aida" and the sex
tet from "Lucia di Lammermoor."
