Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Last year a group of students inter
ested in problems of philosophy and al
lied topics, formed a club to encour
age original work in these subjects for
their mutual benefit. The club had
been active during the entire year in
the consideration of a large number of
problems of Natural and Social Philos
ophy and of Epistemology. In addition
a few papers were given treating of
certain phases of Eastern thought.
This year the club intends to pur
sue the same line of work and is desir
ous to enlarge its sphere of influence.
In view of the fact that there are prob
ably many students who would be ben
efited by the work of the club, and at
the same time would help to make it
a more useful organization, this means
is therefore taken to bring before the
University public the fact of the club's
existence and its work.
