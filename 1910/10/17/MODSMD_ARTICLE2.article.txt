## Nestoria Will Force Third Term on Ex-President at Their Meeting October 25. 
### 
The two literary societies, Euphro
nia and Nestoria will dispense with
their regular meetings tomorrow even
ing and instead, will attend the try
outs for the Sophomore debating team
to be held in the University Chapel at
7:30 o'clock. The following Tuesday
evening, meetings will be held as
usual.
The program which Nestoria has
planned for October 25 will be a novel
one. The Nestorians are going to re
solve themselves into a political con
vention and attempt the rather daring
feat of nominating Theodore Roose
velt as Republican standard bearer for
the 1912 race for the national presi
dency. Although "Teddy's" consent
for a third term has not been secured,
the local debaters are determined to
force the nomination of the Colonel
upon him. His supporters will try to
start a stampede which even the
"Strenuous One" cannot stem.
As are all meetings of the society,
the political convention will be open
to the public and all who wish to see
the stalwarts and progressives out
line the policy of the G. O. P. for the
next administration should come to
room 214 on the evening of October
25.
