# ELECTRIC CAR DEMOLISHED BY FAST FREIGHT TRAIN.
## 
### 
A loss of life was narrowly averted
last evening when a fast freight col
lided with a stalled electric car at the
Southern Pacific crossing in Palo Alto.
The car was crossing the railroad
track bound for the campus when the
trolley left the wire stalling the car.
The oncoming freight was noticed just
as it crossed the bridge. Shouted
warnings drove the passengers out of
the car before the crash occurred.
The electric car was completely
demolished, while the tender of the
locomotive was derailed and several
box-cars partly telescoped.
