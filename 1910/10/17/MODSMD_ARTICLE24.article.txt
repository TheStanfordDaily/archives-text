### 
The only definite action taken by the
University Conference at its meeting
before the rally was the instructing of
the Bookstore to issue as many draws
for position in line when tickets are
sold as there are those who wish them.
When the Mikado tickets were sold the
number was limited to 100 with the re
sult that some were unable to secure
positions. Any further confusion will
be obviated by the action of the Con
ference.
Several matters of importance were
considered at the meeting, but no ac
tion of interest to the public was final
ly taken.
