# SOPHOMORES TO TRYOUT FOR UNDERCLASS DEBATE.
## Eleven Men Will Strive to Make Second Debating Trio Tomorrow Evening. 
### 
The three Sophomores who will
have the honor of representing their
class in the coming Freshman-Sopho
more debate will be chosen by a com
petitive tryout to be held tomorrow
evening in the University chapel at
7:30 o'clock. A total of eleven second
year men will enter the competition
and as several of them are known to
be able speakers the successful three
should be well fitted to represent 1913.
This class was the first in many years
to win a i underclass debate as Fresh
men and as all of last year's trio are
out for the team, 1914 has a forensic
contest before it of no mean merit.
The candidates will be divided in
two squads for tomorrow evening's de
bate, the first being composed of W. L.
Simpson, W. C. Porterfleld, P. Eliel, A.
G. Bradford, J. B. Gregg and C. H.
Marvin.
The second will be made up of C. E.
Smith, G. Wood, C. Gilbert, C. G. Need
ham and I. M. Akahous. These men
will argue the question: "Resolved,
That all American cities should adopt
the commission form of government."
Akahous and Needham will uphold the
affirmative, while Wood, Gilbert and
Smith will oppose them on the neg -
at.ive of the question. The first squad
has the question: "Resolved, That the
California judges should be appointed
by the governor and hold office during
good behavior." Marvin and Porter
field are the negative speakers. Af
firmative arguments will be presented
by Simpson, Eliel, Bradford and Gregg.
Each of the debaters will be allowed
seven minutes for their first speech
and three for rebuttal. Their argu
ments will be listened to by both Nes
toria and Euphronia Literary Societies
as both societies will dispense with
their regular meetings in order to at
tend the tryout. The judges, as they
have been chosen by the Intersociety
Debating Committee, will be L. Craven.
'09, Professor J. K. Bonnell of the De
partment of English, and Professor C.
A. Huston of the Law School. R. ,T.
Miller, '11, president of the Nestoria
Literary Society, will preside.
