# SEVEN FRESHMEN RETAINED AS VARSITY CANDIDATES
## 
### 
Seven men who played in the game
against the first year team from across
the bay last Saturday afternoon have
been retained by Coach Presley to
swell the ranks of the Varsity squad.
Four of these men, Olmstead, Boul
ware, Watkins and Darsie, being
picked from the forwards, while the
other three, Harrigan, Ileeves and
Geissler, were from the backfleld.
These Freshmen with the exception
of Reeves, will probably be seen in
action tomorrow afternoon against the
Varsity, on the turf field at 4:45, when
a series of short snappy scrummages
will be held.
Ueeve3, who had several ligaments
torn in last Wednesday's game and
whose speed was greatly hindered in
Saturday's game by this accident, will
be on the side lines for the remainder
of the week.
