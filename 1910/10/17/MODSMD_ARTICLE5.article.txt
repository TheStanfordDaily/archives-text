# "MIKADO" COMMENDED
## CRITIC PRAISES WORK BY SCHUBERT CLUB Interesting Performance by Local Talent Last Saturday Evening is Commented Upon. 
### 
There is nothing like them â€”these
Gilbert and Sullivan operas, with their
rattling rhymes, their satirical humor,
and their irresistible tunefulness!
Each of us bus his favorite among
them, but that the Schubert Club was
justified in choosing "The Mikado" for
their annual production was well
proven last Saturday evening. It was
a happier choice than that of "lolan
the," the Junior opera of last year, in
that it is better adapted to amateur
performance, that the music is more
attractive, and that the humor of it is
more to the modern American under
standing. Mr. Gilbert was distinctly a
satirist of his own time. And in "lo
lanthe," tco few of us appreciated the
legal quips and the burlesque of par
liamentary procedure in England at
that period.
The performance on Saturday even
ing was undoubtedly the best operatic
venture that has been made here dur
ing recent years. And, thanks to the
cooperation of Sword and Sandals, the
stage presented an attractive picture
that brought a round of applause as
the curtain rose. Probably the best
feature of the performance was the
precision and spontaneity of the chor
us and of the ensemble numbers. Care
ful training was evident throughout
both in the singing and in the stage
management. It was not always pos
sible, however, except for the occu
pants of the front rows, to understand
the words of the songs. This is a crit
icism even more pertinent to perfor
mances purely dramatic, where each
word is significant, than to opera. The
acoustics of Assembly Hall undoubted
ly do present great difficulties, but a
realization of this fact should induce
greater effort on the part of perform
ers to enunciate distinctly.
In the matter of acting, honors went
to Miss C. A. Hanna and to J. H. For
tes. Miss Hanna, as Katisha, the
elderly and unattractive, entered
thoroughly into the spirit of the part
and sang with good dramatic effect.
Forbes, as Ko-Ko, the Lord High Ex
ecutioner, had a complete professional
box of tricks for the amusement of his
audience. The duet and dance be
tween Katisha and Ko-Ko in their love
scene together was especially good.
For the most part, the singing of the
men was better than that of the wo
men, H. B. McGuire, in the role of
Nankl-Poo, having a particularly good
tenor voice of pure quality, P. M.
Jones and A. L. Rock wood, in the parts
of Pish-Tush and Pooh-Bah, singing
with a grateful distinctness of enun
ciation. But could anything be pret
tier or more graceful than the"Three
Little Maids From School?" Miss Rob
ertson sang the principal part of Yum-
Yum with great spirit. Miss Burnside
was charming as Peep-80, and Miss
Stillman as Pitti-Sing displayed a
voice, which, though not yet developed
to its full power, shows promise of
great beauty. The role of the Mikado

was well taken by H. F. Bromell, that
of his humorous attendant by C. R
Turpin
To the Schubert Club itself great
credit is due not only for a very enjoy
able performance last Saturday even
ing, but for the work it is doing
throughout the year. So pathetically
little is done here at Stanford in the
way of musical education, that, to a
club voluntarily devoting its time and
energy to a conscientious study of
part singing, we owe gratitude and
encouragement.
