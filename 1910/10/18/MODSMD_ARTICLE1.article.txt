# 1914 TO HOLD TRY-OUTS
## CANDIDATES STRIVING TO MAKE DEBATING TRIO. Two Squads Will Argue in Competitive Tryout in the Chapel this Evening. 
### 
Thirteen ambitious Freshmen will
contest for the honor of representing
their class against the Sophomores in
debate, in the competitive tryout which
is to be held in the Chapel tomorrow
evening at 7:30. The men who are
entered in this competition have been
spending much of their spare time in
preparation, and as many of them
have had experience in preparatory
school debating, an interesting con
test is anticipated, and it is assured
that the three finally selected will be
well fitted to speak against the strong
Sophomore debaters. The 1911 men
realize that forensic ability of merely
ordinary merit will not suffice to de
feat their time-honored foemen of the
upper class, as 1913 was the first in
many years to win the iuterclass de
bate as Freshmen, and all of last
year's trio are out again for the team,
reinforced by eight other able de
baters.
The candidates for the Freshman
forensic honors have been divided into
two squads for purposes of conveni
ence in the tryout. Squad number
one will debate the question, "Re
solved, That the United States govern
ment should fortify the Panama
Canal," the affirmative being upheld by
R. M. Good, H. L. Shepp, and W. Wal
cott, while the negative speakers will
be S. J. Sharp, G. Brydoff, and W. S.
Wood. \Y r . B. Owens, president of the
Freshman Debating Society, orignally
a member of this squad, has been
forced to withdraw owing to lack of
time. The immigration problem will
be delt with by the second squad, the
question being, "Resolved, That im
migration should be further restricted
by the imposition of an educational
test." A. H. Cawston, J. S. Mickle, and
C. C. Close will speak favorably to the
proposed plan, and G. 11. Murray, O.
H. Castle, and E. Worthy will oppose
them.
The rules governing the first year
men are the same as those in force
with the Sophomores at, their tryout
tonight. Each speaker is to be al
lowed seven minutes for his opening
remarks ar set address and three min
utes in which to refute the arguments
of his opponents. The decision of the
judges, who have not yet been an
nounced, will be given immediately
upon the conclusion of the debate. In
addition to the three regular members
of the team an alternate is to be
chosen, who is expected to work in
connection wit hthe other t, hree and
be prepared to substitute for one of
them in case unforseen events should
prevent his speaking.
The time is 7:30 sharp, and Univer
sity Chapel (he place of the conteest
of these disciples of the ancient arts
of argument and oratory. The presid
ing officer of the evening will be F. E.
Hill, '11, president of Euphronia Liter
ary Society. The tryout is open to all
who care to attend.
