C. W. Rice, secretary o fthe Ameri
can Society of Mechanical Engineers,
addressed the students of the Engi
neering department this afternoon on
the advantages ofor engineers in as
sociating with engineering societies.
Rice came to the coast for the purpose
of organizing a branch in San Fran
cisco of the national society with
which he is affiliated. He is an engi
neer of wide reputation and has been
called to the coast before to superin
tend the installation of some of the
largest power plants in the west.
In his talk, he dwelt 011 the neces
sity of the successful engineer being
able to present ills plans in a clear and
convincing manner. He said that in
no way could one receive better train
ing for this purpose than in the dis
cussions and dother work in an engi
neering society. The advice of the
doctor and lawyer he said is accepted
without question, but the engineer
must be able to convince his prospec
tive client of the practicability and
excellence of his plans. Hence he
urged upon the students the import
ance of this phase of theiir work.
