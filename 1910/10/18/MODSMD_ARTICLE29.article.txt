# NEW RECRUITS JOIN THE GYMNASIUM RUGBY SQUAD.
## A.E. Roth Will Instruct Players. Schedule of Games to be Arranged for Season. 
### 
Eleven new recruits have added
their names to the Encina Gymnasium
rugby squad and it is probable that
fifteen men will be picked from this
aggregation to give the Varsity a short
practise game in the near future.
The new players are: R. E. Millsap,
P. Y. Dickinson, R. J. Finney, A. E.
Remington, C. H. Gilbert, R. R. Beal,
E. C. Abel, C. C. Taylor, C. C. McDon
ald, S. B. Smith and H. Crandall.
Two full teams have been chosen
from all the candidates, and light
practise is indulged in three times a
week under the supervision of A. E.
Roth. The teams are fast getting into
form, and are putting up a good ex
hibition of the game.
Instructor Maloney is trying to ar
range a number of games, most of
which will be played with independent
teams about San Francisco Bay. These
matches will practically all take place
after the intercollegiate game in order
that they may not interfere with the
Varsity rugby schedule.
