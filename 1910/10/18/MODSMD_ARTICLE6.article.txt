# Call on Police to Stop Hazing.
## 
### 
The faculty of the University of
Michigan has called the police into ac
tion to assist them in putting a stop to
the night hazing of freshmen. A few
nights ago some freshmen were caught
by the sophomores and painted with
black paint and pasted with fly paper.
Outrages of a still more vicious nature
have also been committed and dismis
sal awaits the sophomores if they are
caught.
