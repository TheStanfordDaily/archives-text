score of 9 to 3 in the second game of
the series for the world's champion

Brown, tho Cubs veteran twirler,
suffered the same fate as his team
mate Overall did yesterday and had to
retire from the box. The Athletics

fingered wonder's curves. Coombs,
who was on the mound for Philadel
phia, was batted freely, but kept the
hits scattered.
Tomorrow there will be no game as
the teams jump to Chicago, where thoy
play the next two games Thursday and
Friday.
The batteries today were: Philadel
phia—Coombs and Thomas; Chicago—•
Brown and Kling.
