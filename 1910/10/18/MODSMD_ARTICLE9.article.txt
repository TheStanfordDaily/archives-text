# Miners Plan Smoker.
## 
### 
As has been the custom in the past,
the men of the Geology and Mining de
partment are planning a smoker. A
meeting of the men has been called
for tomorrow afternoon at 1:10 in
room 220, at which time the necessary
arrangements for the affair will be
made. Last year the smoker was held
at the "Breakers Club."
