# PLUG-UGLY ADVANCES
## MUCH GOOD MATERIAL FOR PLAY IS SUBMITTED. Farce to be Selected Tomorrow Evening and Cast Chosen at Once. 
### 
With several oi the best plays that
have been submitted in years in their
possession, the Plug-Ugly Committee
of the Junior Class is btill endeavoring
to make up its official mind as to which
would be the best suited for presenta
tion. The lines of three of the plays
are usually good, being full of good
hits on many oi' the prominent Seniors,
other people and noticeable conditions
around college. The only objection to
any of the farces so far considered, is
that much depends upon the audience
being able to get all of the lines, one
line depending on the preceding, so
that the success of the farce hinges on
the manner in which it is received by
the Seniors. The committee will make
its final selection of the play Thursday
evening of this week.
The exact manner in which the play
will be presented also still remains to
1 e settled. It has been alreadj deter
mined that it will be given on tlie old
ba cball diamond, but the details of
the arrangements are still in doubt.
The committee has ideas of its own
which it will present to the class to
morrow, and action will immediately
be taken in accordance with its decis
ion.
The poster committee has also been
working quietly for some time and al
though nothing definite will be said by
them they smile and promise some
thing good. The cast for the farce will
be picked by the committee immediate
ly after Thursday night, when the
farce is finally selected.
