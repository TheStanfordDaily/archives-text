### 
\V. B. Piper, '14, while working in
Forge this morning, received a severe
burn in the right eye, owing to the
slipping of a piece of iron from his
tongues. Although the burn was at
first painful enough to lead his co
workers to believe that he had lost the
sight of the eye, a later examination at
the Peninsula Hospital showed that
the injury was not a serious one. It is
expected that he will be able to resume
University work by the first of the
week.
