# DEBATERS ARE CHOSEN
## SIMPSON, WOOD, AND NOWELL COMPRISE 1913 TEAM. Sophomore Contest Brings Out Many Able Speakers.â€”Bradford Selected as Alternate. 
### 
Granville Numan Wood ot' Blue
Lake, William Edward Simpson of
Bakerslield, and Patterson Duna Now
ell of Tulare will represent the Class
of 1911! in the coming Freshman-Soph
omore debate. These three men were
chosen by the Judges as making the
best showing at the tryout of second
year debaters held last evening in the
University Chapel. A total ol eleven
men strove in closely contested de
bates for the honor of meeting the
Freshman team on the evening of No
vember 28. and the judges had con
siderable difficulty in choosing the
trio. Albert Grover Bradford of Eure
ka was chosen as alternate.
Although two members of last
year's championship Freshman team
entered the tryout yesterday evening,
Simpson was the only member to win
a place on 1913's Sophomore team.
Simpson is a very logical and aggres
sive talker and well merited a second
selection. Wood and Nowell are prac
tical!} new faces in the local forensic
firmament, the former being a trans
fer, while the latter has not been en
gaged in debating work at Stanford
until this year. All three are fluent
debaters, and will prepare themselves
immediately to be as able class repre
sentatives as was the trio from the
Freshman class of last year. Wood's
showing was especially brilliant and
much will lie expected of him in future
contests'.
The two questions considered by the
squads yesterday evening were: "Re
solved, That all American cities should
adopt the commission form of govern
ment," and "Resolved, That the Cali
fornia judges should be appointed by
the governor and hold office during
good behavior." Wood upheld the neg
ative of the first question, while Simp
son and Bradford presented affirmative
arguments for the second question.
I. M. Akahous, opposing Wood in the
first debate, made a showing of con
siderable merit.
The Law School claims all three of
the successful candidates. Simpson is
a member of the Nestoria Literary So
ciety and the Delta Chi fraternity.
Bradford, the alternate, is secretary of
Nestoria.
A meeting of the team and alternate
has been called for tomorrow after
noon at 1:30 in the Law Library in
order to choose a question to submit
to the Freshman team. This trio will
be chosen tonight at a tryout con
ducted along the same lines as the one
last night. It is always customary for
the Sophomores to chose the question
for the final debate, leaving the first
year speakers the choice of sides.
Professor .T. K. Bonnell of the De
partment of English, Professor C. A.
Huston of the Law School and L.
Craven, '09. acted as judges. R. J.
Miller, '11, as president of the Tnter
society Debating Committee, presided.

Judge Sloss, candidate for the Su
preme bench of this state is one whom
the people well deserve to honor. Ed
ucated for the most part in the schools
of San Francisco, he received his uni
versity education at Harvard, gradu
ating with high honors from its law
school. For seven years after gradua
tion lie was a successful practioner in
San Francisco. In November 1901, he
was elected to the Superior court
bench, where his work was of remark
ably high order. In 190."), he was ap
pointed to the Supreme bench by Gov
ernor Pardee to fill the unexpired term
of Judge Van Dyke, deceased. Re
elected to this position in 1906, he has
at all times been one of the foremost
jurists in the state, and the part he has
taken in certain decisions has marked
ihm as a judge the state could not af
ford to lose. Justice has always been
the great principle of such decisions,
and in upholding the McEnerney Act
and the Employer's Liability Act he
has done all the people of the state a
great service.
