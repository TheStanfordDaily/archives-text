SJiCOMJ TEAM PLAYS FAST
SCItniMAGK WITH VA It SIT Y
The watchers on tlie bleachers yester
day afternoon saw a creditable exhibi
tion of rugby in the two short halves
between the Varsity and second team.
Minturn and Arrell, who are temporar
ily out of the game because of slight in
juries, were replaced by Baumgartner
and Fitting. Ilarrigan was tried at cen
ter dining the first half, and was later
shifted to first five. lie figured in most
of the plays, all of his passes being ac
curately given. Mitchell showed his old
form, and the ball in his possession
never failed to make a substantial gain
through the loose.
During the play, Partridge receive;!
a glancing kick in the face, which
necessitated his removal from the
game. This injury may impair Part
ridge's eligibility for the team that is
to go to Reno for Saturday's game, but
he will probably he out again for prac
tice on Monday.
The second team will be away from
the campus on Saturday, going with
Assistant. Manager W. M. Masters to
Santa Clara to meet the Mission play
ers of that town. After the creditable
showing which the second team made
against the Varsity yesterday after
noon, a high class quality of rugby
should he witnessed by the Santa
Clara rooters.
