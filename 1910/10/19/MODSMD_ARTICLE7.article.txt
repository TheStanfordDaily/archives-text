The Geology and Mining Society met
this afternoon in room L'2o and dis
cussed plans for their annual smoker
this fall. Nothing definite was de
cided upon, but President B. E. Par
sons, '10, appointed a committee con
sisting of 11. W. Young, '10, T. W. Hai
laday, '10, It. ,T. McCann, '10, W. J.
Crook, '11, and E. J. Stewart, '12, to
select a suitable time and place for
their jolly-up.
The purpose of the smoker is to
bring all the Geology and Mining maj

got her to become better acquainted
with each other and with the pro
fessors. Last year the affair was held
at the "Breakers Club"and was a pro
nounced success.
