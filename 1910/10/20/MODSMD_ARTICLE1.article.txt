# VARSITY LEAVES TONIGHT FOR GAME WITH NEVADA
## 
### 
When the G:57 pulls out of the sta
tion at Palo Alto tonight, twenty men,
besides Coach Presley and "Doc" Bur
bank will begin the 1910 pilgrimage to
the alkali rugby gridiron in the
metropolis of the Sagebrush state. Al
though the travelers will be under the
handicap of playing in a high altitude
and on a dirt field, with only one day
to find their usual form, they should
give a good exhibition of their cus
tomary rugby. The hard season of
training through which the Cardinal
players have passed will more than
meet these difficulties and the burgh
ers of Reno will see the Varsity in
action that is nearly as speedy and as
effective as the play on Stanford Field.
The forward pack in Saturday's
game will remain the same as it lias
been since practically the beginning
of the season, the one change being the
shifting of Sundell from the backfield.
Arrell has been unable to appear at
practice this week because of a should
er that was wrenched in last. Saturday
morning's game, but he will be hook
ing again in the front ranks day after
tomorrow.
Minturn,who lias recovered from a
slight injury received last week, will
form the backstop of the pack, flanked
by Schaupp and Dole on the ranks.
Partridge and Cheda will form the
backstay of the scrum, where they will
have the opportunity of making swift
onsets upon the opopsing backs.
Sundell has only had one opportun
ity and that in a practice lineup, to
play as a free lance at the wing for
ward position, but his speed and heady
work in handling the spheroid, gave
him the opportunity for good work
among the forwards. Opposing him
will be one of the two Nevadans who

played in the Antipodes with the All-
American.
Erb, the indispensible Cardinal half,
will have an opportunity of using his
boot in tight places against new mater
ial.
Harrigan at first five will receive
the passes from Erb and the quality of
rugby that he has been putting up dur
ing practice this week promises well
for his showing at Reno.
Mitchell demonstrated his return to
form during Tuesday's scrummage.
As a yard gainer through the loose
and in well timed passes when he is
tackled, lie may be relied upon. San
born and Kern completing the side
line, will back up Mitchell in the
rushes. Geissler will balance Kern at
wing, where he will have ample oppor
tunity to make use of his long spirals
to touch.
Brown as rear guard at full, secures
this section of the field and whenever
the ball comes through, his team mates
in the lore, his never-failing long dis
tance boots to touch are effective line
out advancers.
Nevada has never proved a serious
rival to the Varsity players, but they
never fail to put up a game fight and
always prove foemen worthy of the
Cardinal. Two men in their line-up
saw service with the "All-Americans"
last summer, they are Leavitt, the
Nevada captain and front ranker, and
Bennett at wing forward. Dubois, ex
'lo, plays a side rank position in their
scrum.
The line-ups will read as follows:
Varsity—Frank, Arrell, Schaupp,
Minturn, Dole, Partridge, Cheda, Fit
ting, Baumgartner, Horton, forwards;
Sundell, Woodcock, wing forward;

morning's game, but he will be hook
ing again in the front ranks day after
tomorrow.
Minturn,who lias recovered from a
slight injury received last week, will
form the backstop of the pack, flanked
by Schaupp and Dole on the ranks.
Partridge and Cheda will form the
backstay of the scrum, where they will
have the opportunity of making swift
onsets upon the opopsing backs.
Sundell has only had one opportun
ity and that in a practice lineup, to
play as a free lance at the wing for
ward position, but his speed and heady
work in handling the spheroid, gave
him the opportunity for good work
among the forwards. Opposing him
will be one of the two Nevadans who

played in the Antipodes with the All-
American.
Erb, the indispensible Cardinal half,
will have an opportunity of using his
boot in tight places against new mater
ial.
Harrigan at first five will receive
the passes from Erb and the quality of
rugby that he has been putting up dur
ing practice this week promises well
for his showing at Reno.
Mitchell demonstrated his return to
form during Tuesday's scrummage.
As a yard gainer through the loose
and in well timed passes when he is
tackled, lie may be relied upon. San
born and Kern completing the side
line, will back up Mitchell in the
rushes. Geissler will balance Kern at
wing, where he will have ample oppor
tunity to make use of his long spirals
to touch.
Brown as rear guard at full, secures
this section of the field and whenever
the ball comes through, his team mates
in the lore, his never-failing long dis
tance boots to touch are effective line
out advancers.
Nevada has never proved a serious
rival to the Varsity players, but they
never fail to put up a game fight and
always prove foemen worthy of the
Cardinal. Two men in their line-up
saw service with the "All-Americans"
last summer, they are Leavitt, the
Nevada captain and front ranker, and
Bennett at wing forward. Dubois, ex
'lo, plays a side rank position in their
scrum.
The line-ups will read as follows:
Varsity—Frank, Arrell, Schaupp,
Minturn, Dole, Partridge, Cheda, Fit
ting, Baumgartner, Horton, forwards;
Sundell, Woodcock, wing forward;

When the G:57 pulls out of the sta
tion at Palo Alto tonight, twenty men,
besides Coach Presley and "Doc" Bur
bank will begin the 1910 pilgrimage to
the alkali rugby gridiron in the
metropolis of the Sagebrush state. Al
though the travelers will be under the
handicap of playing in a high altitude
and on a dirt field, with only one day
to find their usual form, they should
give a good exhibition of their cus
tomary rugby. The hard season of
training through which the Cardinal
players have passed will more than
meet these difficulties and the burgh
ers of Reno will see the Varsity in
action that is nearly as speedy and as
effective as the play on Stanford Field.
The forward pack in Saturday's
game will remain the same as it lias
been since practically the beginning
of the season, the one change being the
shifting of Sundell from the backfield.
Arrell has been unable to appear at
practice this week because of a should
er that was wrenched in last. Saturday
morning's game, but he will be hook
ing again in the front ranks day after
tomorrow.
