# 1912 QUAD STAFF IS NOW AT WORK ON JUNIOR ANNUAL
## 
### 
The members of the 1912 "Quad"
staff are already busily engaged on
their annual and are sparing no pains
to make this the best year book ever
published by a Junior cla3s.
Much of the athletic and photo
graphic work has been completed and
the proofs have already been sent to
the engravers. The fall sports and
events of interest in the college year
will all be made before the Christmas
holidays. This work is being done
during this semester in order to al
leviate the rush upon engraving work
that will necessarily be occasioned the
first of next semester. The manage
ment also desires that all organiza
tions that are able to have their pic
ture taken this semester do so as
early as possible in order to further
expedite the work of the engravers.
The great success that has attended
the various athletic teams, during the
present year is to receive its due space
in the annual and the many contests
will be artistically portrayed by both
the photographer and the cartoonists.
The athletic department was original
ly in charge of J. C. Thomas and J. W.
Henderson, but as the former has left
college, Henderson will now have full
control.
The art work is in the hands ot' A.
T. King and E. W. Albright, this fact
alone assuring a splendid art edition.
Uoth of these men are members of the
Hammer and Coffin Society and con
tribute many of the best sketches and
portraits for the columns of the Chap
arral. This department is not con
fined to the Juniors but every member
of the University who is artistically
inclined, is urged to submit drawings.
Many of the cleverest, sketches in last
year's annual were the work of under

classmen, while a Freshman secured
the prize for the frontispiece. As yet,
no art prizes have been offered, but
there have been several promised
within ?, few weeks.
At present, but few jokes have been
handed to editor-in-chiaf, W. How
ell. This department i a!wa.— ' •"
the most entertaining feature ol i
Quad and the editor is particularly
anxious that any one having jokes of
any nature will submit them to him
immediately.
According to Manager O'Donnell,
the new Quad will be one of the most
expensive annuals ever published here.
An especially fine grade of paper has
been ordered from the east through
the Pacific Coast Paper Company and
will arrive the first of next year. The
Sierra Art and Engraving company of
San Francisco will make the cuts and
their work has always been of an
exceptionally high order. This con
cern produced the cuts for last year's
annual and were the subject of much
favorable comment. Davey, the Palo
Alto photographer, will have charge
of the pictures of the local organiza
tions. The contract for the printing
and binding will not be let for a few
weeks.
Only SOO "Quads" will be published,
the regular price of $2.50 being
charged.
Manager O'Donnell reports that, up
to-date, only about one-half the class
have paid their Quad assessments.
The time for paying these dues has
been extended to December 1, and all
who have not paid up by that date will
not be allowed to place their picture in
the book. The Junior women will pay
their assessments to Miss Neal, the
assistant manager.
