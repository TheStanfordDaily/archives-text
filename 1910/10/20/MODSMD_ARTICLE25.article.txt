# California Team in Strict Training.
## 
### 
The California Varsity was placed
under strict training rules today. The
men who are on the training table are
to reside at the Delta Upsilon house
for the remainder of the season. The
fraternity has extended this privilege
to the team in order that, the members
of the squad may become better ac
quainted with each other. The men
who have given up their home will find
quarters among the other houses on
the campus.
After a strenuous campaign the
Michigan Union Club reports a mem
bership of over 1000.
Under the new rules the University
of Colorado center is passing the ball
sideways, instead of through his legs.
