# Queries Students on Summer Work.

### 
A prospective new policy at Stan
ford is foreshadowed by the queries
given out yesterday to the Law stu
dents by Professor F. C. Woodward,
head of the Law School. The ques
tions seek to determine the number of
students who might register in sum
mer school law courses of eight or
twelve weeks, offering six and nine
credits respectively.
