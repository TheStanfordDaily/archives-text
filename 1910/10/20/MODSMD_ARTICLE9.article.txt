A member of a Faculty Committee
has made a proposition to the Daily
Palo Alto whereby this paper was to
agree to compromise its news space by
inserting advertising notices for a
consideration of six complimentary
tickets to a musical concert. We wish
to inform all those who desire to ad
vertise in the columns of the Daily
Palo Alto that such publicity is avail
able through the managerial depart
ment. The paper will not limit
its efficiency as a news gatherer for a
monetary consideration. Every court
esy is extended to the Faculty and
every consideration is made for the
efforts that they are making in the
interests of the students.
We heartily indorse many of (he
entertainments that they are instru
mental in securing for the students
and we should enthusiastically support
any movement of this nature. But tin
Daily Palo Alto will not agree to con
duct such a campaign upon a monetary
consideration.
