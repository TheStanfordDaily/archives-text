### 
.T. W. Howell and L. D. Sumraerfield
were last night awarded the first prize
out of the $25 which was offered by the
members of Junior Class for the be.u
farce submitted. The prize was not
awarded in one sum, but was divide;!
up among the authors of the three
lest manuscripts that were turned
in. The farce, written by Summerfield,
around which the final' play will be
based, was awarded a prize of $12.
Ideas, good lines, and especially good
hits were incorporated from two other
plays, those on which R. S. Worthing
ton and R. H. Soper and M. M. Fogel
and P. M. Levy collaborated. The
farce written by Worthington and Sop
er, from which the most was adopted
was given the second prize of $9, and
that written by Fogel and Levy was
given the remaining $4.
All three of these farces were good
in themselves, containing especially
good verses and sparkling wit, and the
one submitted by Howell and Summer
field has been considerably changed in
order to make room for the best parts
from the other two. As it now appears
the farce is full of hits on the most
prominent Seniors and other well
known members of the class of 1911.
The play as it now stands, since the
success of one line depends to a large
extent, on the preceding one, rests for
its success to a large extent upon the
way in which it is received by the
audience and especially by those who
are in the front rows. The play con
tains a larger percentage of good hum
or and a nearer approach to acentral
idea or plot than has been the
with most Plug-ITglies in former years,
while more care is to be used in the
presentation and in the manner in
which the actors deliver their lines
than has been the case before.
The committee is already engaged in
the selection of the cast for the play,
in order that they may perfect them
selves in the lines. From statements
by the committee it is understood that
the east will lie large and one that
will call for a great range of ability
by those that are chosen to take part
in it.
