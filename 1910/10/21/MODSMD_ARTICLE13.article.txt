Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Dear Sir: Although, as I under
stand, the football team touring Aus
traliasia this past winter was not of
ficially representing any of the uni
versities, I trust the Student Body will
not make (he mistake of thinking they
did not represent "the American uni
versities" to the people of this part of
the world.
As one who is ever jealous of the
good name of Stanford in particular
and Americans in general, I want lo
express my appreciation of the con
duct of the team. The boys were pop
ular, not only as sportsmen, but as
gentlemen, and from all critics comes
nothing but praise for the "Yankees."
The only adverse criticism I have
heard was from my waiter in the hotel
where the boys stayed while in Auck
land. The morning after they had
gone he confided that they were "fair
terrors to eat jam and drink water."
Perhaps the enclosed clipping will
be o!' interest.
Very truly,
D. M. GREER, '06.
