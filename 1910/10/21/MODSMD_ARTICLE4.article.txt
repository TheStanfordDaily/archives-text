# TICKETS TO BE OBTAINED MONDAY
## Sale Commences Next Week for Last Play of Semester.—Money to be Donated to Bleacher Stunts. 
### 
The last dramatic offering of the
present semester will be seen on the
Assembly stage when the "Devil's Dis
ciple" is presented by the Masquers
and Sword and Sandals on October 29.
Preparations are almost complete at
this time for the presentation of the
work, and according to present indi
cations, the play promises to be one
of the best and most successful thai
have ever been given at the University.
The seat sale for this play will be
gin Monday morning. Seats will be on
sale at the usual prices at the Stan
ford Bookstore on the campus, and
the Stanford Pharmacy in Palo Alto.
Coach Mathieu has spent more than
the usual amount of time on the dril
ling of the various players, and with
the performance still more than a
week off the play is well rounded
enough to warrant its production at
the present time. With still more than
a week for rehearsals, which will be
held every day during this time, the
coach believes that he can give to the
various scenes a more perfect finish
than has yet been attained in any of
the college plays during the first few
year.j.
in many ways the play is the most
ambitious that has ever been under
taken at the University. It requires a
costuming far greater than any other
that has ever been put on here, and
the nature of the scenes demands a
complicated and difficult set. The
managers of the performance have
found it necessary to purchase entire
ly new settings for the play, while
certain radical changes have been
made in the lighting of the Assembly
stage, giving far more life and light
than could be obtained under the oh'
method of illumination.
It is not generally known among the
students of the University that 25 per
cent of the net proceeds of the per
formance will be turned over by the
two societies to the Uleacher Stunt
Committee.
The play is quite different, in its

j nature from any that has been put on
i here in some time. It is less emo
tional and sentimental than is the
average play, but makes up for this in
being replete with strong gripping
dramatic situations of Shaw's prover
bially clever dialogue, and of pure
comedy of the best kind. There has
been no play at Stanford of late in
which the comedy parts are so strong.
And intersperced with this comedy
there is one strong scene after an
odic/, each of which holds the audi
ence to the last word, the whole lead
! ins up to the climax at llie execution
scene in the shadow or a gallows.
The play is laid in New York state
during the Revolutionary war. Peter
Dudgeon, at the opening of the play,
has just been hanged by the British
for a rebel. His will is to be read at
his home and all the relatives (lock
in as relatives will on such occasions.
[At this moment Richard Dudgeon—
! son of the dead man—and popularly
I known as the "Devil's Disciple" be
\ cause of his wild life, and sworn al
! legiance to I lis Satanic Majesty, makes
| his appearance on the scene. The
! reading of the will follows and many
! unexpected things happen. The act
I is full to overflowing of the very best
of comedy lines and situations.
The next act is laid at the home of
the minister, whose puritanical wife
hates the "devil's disciple," as did all
good puritans of her day. Through a
trick of fate, Richard is arrested for
! the minister and is taken by the Brit
| ish to be hanged. Then follows the
I brilliant court martial scene, in which
i
I the courtly Burgoyne and his bril
j liantly uniformed staff conduct a trial
| which results in the conviction of
j Richard. Then in the final scene comes
the mob, dead marches and the gal
lows.
The dramatic intensity of the last
scene affords opportunity for a melo
dramatic situation easily overdone, but
the success of the cast so far has ab
solutely barred any such possibility.
