Cross-countrj ruining will hence

ing of the Cardinai distant
ability in this line comes more as a re
sult of hard, consistant training- than
of natural ability. Captain Bellah has
inaugurated a system whereby the
squad of distance men will be taken on
long runs three times a week. The
Varsity leader hopes by this means to
develop some good milers from among
the Freshman material.
1 wice a week the squad will ramble
over the country, while the third ses
sion will take place on the track. The
squad will be under tho supervision
of R. S. Worthington, *12, the crack
two-miler. Worthington will devote
all his time to instructing his charges
in the ins and outs of long distance
running.
The men will leave the training
quarters at 4:43 sharp on Monday,
Wednesday and Friday afternoons. No
definite distance has been set to cover,
as the condition of the men will wholly
determine this matter. On Friday af
ternoons the men will be worked on
the track.
Stanford will be without distance
men in a year or so, if this effort does
not bring out some runners who will
lie callable of development. All men
who wish to take up long distance run
ning in the spring are requested to
report to Bellah and Worthington at
the track training house on Monday
afternoon.
