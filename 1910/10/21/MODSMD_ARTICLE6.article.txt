# BLEACHER RALLY TO BE HELD TUESDAY AFTERNOON.
## Yell Lenders Will Hold Practice for Purpose of Learning New Songs and Yells. 
### 
On next Tuesday afternoon a bleach
er rally will be held at Stanford field.
This gathering will be for the purpose
of introducing the new yells and songs
which are to be used at thp time of the
Varsity game in November. The yell
leaders will start the fireworks exactly
at 4 o'clock.
As the words of the new songs are
practically unknown to the majority
of the Student Body, the Executive
Committee has issued another edition
of the small Stanford song book in
which are incorporated the new verses.
These books will be distributed on the
bleachers Tuesday afternoon. The
best known Varsity yells will also be
contained in the books.
Out. of the three yells submitted in
the recent competition, which were
considered worthy of further inspec
tion, the one will be chosen in which
the rooters evince the most enthu
siasm at the rally. By this means it
is expected that the most popular yell
will be adopted.
The music for the songs will be
provided by the Stanford band. The
leaders of this organization have se
cured the arrangement of the music
for band use, and promise that the
rendition will be something worth list
ening to.
