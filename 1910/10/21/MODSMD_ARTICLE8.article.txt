The yell leaders have issued a call to
the Student Body for a bleacher rally
next Tuesday afternoon. Every mem
ber of that body should respond, not
only for the purpose of manifesting his
or her interest in the development of
the Varsity squad, but also to learn the
new songs and yells that are to be
used at the intercollegiate game this
year. At this time these latest com
positions will be explained and prac
ticed for the first time and no member
of the Student Body should lose the
opportunity to make himself familiar
with them. It might be well at the
present time to also speak of a prac
tise that has had a tendency in the
past to manifest itself. In the zest
with which new songs are adopted,
there is a possibility that the old songs
and yells that have become so import
ant in Stanford traditions will be over
looked and forgotten. Many of the
older songs are especially well fitted
for bleacher singing and although the
product of past, generations, are
worthy of learning and singing.
