It now lies within the power of the
present two upper classes of the Uni
versity to either preserve or to ex
tinguish the life of the most unique
and original of all our traditions or
practices,—namely the Junior Plug-
Ugly. Established by a Stanford man
as an event in the college year, it has
thus far been proved worthy of per
petuation. The custom is original with
our University and on account of our
peculiar climatic conditions there are
opportunities for the development of
the institution to points beyond the
hopes of the present members of the
Student Body. The same tradition
cannot be found in other colleges, no.
can the opportunities for development
of the same as exist here at Stanford
be discovered in other institutions.
If the upperclassmen retain the Plug-
Ugly, they will keep the foundation of
that which may develop 111 the future
into the most important and the best
known of all our local traditions and
institutions. This, therefore, should
be kept upon the calendar of our col
legiate events and to accomplish this
result there should be cooperation
upon the part of both the Senior and
Junior classes. The Plug-Ugly is now
on trial and the spirit with which it is
accepted this year determines its ulti
mate fate. Extreme measures and
unnecessary rivalry closely marked
the end of the life of the custom last
year. Due care and a desire to pre
serve the Plug-Ugly should be enough
and it is urged upon all those who will
take part in the contest that their con
duct is to finally decide the continu
ance of the existence of the custom.
Unnecessary features, such as entered
into the Plug-Ugly last fall should be
carefully avoided by both Senior and
Junior Classes. With the elimination
of these harmful elements, the in
stitution will remain with us, without
their eradication, the tradition will
disappear. Therefore, it is incum

bent upon all upperclassmen to keep
the struggle this year within reason
able bounds. The Plug-Ugly must re
main with us.
