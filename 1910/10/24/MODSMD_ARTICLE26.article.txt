# STANFORD SOCCER TEAM DEFEATS OAKLANDERS
## Locals Win by a 10 to 1 Score.â€” Pung and Higgins Tie for Goals. 
### 
In a rather slow and uninteresting
game, the second Encina Gymnasium
soccer team took the Oaklands into
camp Saturday by a score of 10 to 1.
During the first half, tlie playing
was very ragged and before half time
was called, Instructor Maloney made a
change in the line-up whereby Higgins
went to the inside left position in place
of Summerfield; and Summerfield was
shifted to left half in place of Humph
reys, who, for the balance of the game
held down the position left by Hig
gins. With this new line-up, the team
took a decided brace and before half
time was called the score stood to 1
in favor of Stanford.
At the beginning of the second half,
the locals rushed their opponents off
their feet and before five minutes of
play they had annexed another goal.
From this point till the final whistle
was blown, the Stanford aggregation
decidedly had the advantage and at no
time was the local goal in imminent
danger.
During the second half, the Stanford
team scored seven goals, making a
total in all of ten, of which Higgins
shot four, Pung four, and Hill two.
The line-ui) that finished the game is
as follows: Forwards, Heald, Hig
gins, Pung, Hill and Lyne, halfs;
Summerfield, Multaner, and Tucker,
fulls; Stone and Humphreys, goal,
Goldsworthy.
On next Saturday the first team goes
to the city to play the San Franciscos
and as these are considered one of the
best teams in the League a hard game
is expected.
