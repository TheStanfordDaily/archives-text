The game on Mackay Field Saturday
was the greatest event in Reno since
(he "Fight of the century" last July.
The bleacher.- overlooking the turf
field, a new feature since the last visit
of the Varsity two seasons ago, were
crowded to their limit with rugby en
thusiasts. Stanford was ably repre
sented by a group of old students who
lent their vocal support to the Cardi
nal fighters.
The Stanford aggregation arrived in
Reno early Friday morning. In tin 1
afternoon a short practice was held
to accustonie the team to the dry
mile-above-sea desert altitude of this
section of Nevada.
The Stanford players lacked their i
usual aggressiveness on Saturday
afternoon, and coupled with unusual
ragged playing, the Nevadans were en
abled to hold the Cardinal players to
the modest score of 8-0. Although
outweighed fifteen pounds to the man,
Nevada's wonderful work and effective j
tackling equalled this difference. The !
Sagebrushs' scrum played a very cred- j
itable game, being particularly strong ;
in fast dribbling and following up.
They broke even in the scrum with our j
forwards using to good advantage the
screw play. Nevada was hardly a \
match for the taller Cardinal forwards •
on a lineout and they chose a scrum ;
instead of a lineout whenever the ball i
was in their possession.
Leavitt and Bennett, the two repre
sentatives of Nevada with the "All-
American" aggregation last, summer,
were the stars for their team. Ben
nett, as the wing forward roamer, was
a constant source of annoyance for the ;
Cardinal backs and many Cardinal i
passing rushes which went astray may
be traced to his presence. The Nevada
backs individually and collectively
played poorly.
Brown was Stanford's star and but
for his effective spirals to touch, a dif
ferent score would have been recorded..
During both periods of the contest the
dribbling advances of Nevada's for
wards brought, the pigskin frequently
into Brown's territory, but he never
failed to send Nevada back. Cheda
was a tower of strength among the

scrum and was to the fore ol his
j mates. Dole figured in three fifty
yard sprints through the loose during
the last hall ending at. the ten yard
encampments:.
The first half was the tallying per
iod, then Stanford, having devoted the
first five minutes oi p'.ay to becoming
acclimated, rolled up eight, tallies to
their opponent's cipher. The penaliz
ing of Nevada for kicking the bail
cut of the scrum after ten minutes of
play, gave Brown an opportunity to
drive the spheroid between the goal
posts from a difficult angle at thirty.
A few minutes later Erb secured the
leather oval from a scrum at Nevada's
'10 and went through the opposing line
for the only try of the afternoon. From
near the side lines, Mitchell made a
pretty conversion and the afternoon's
score was completed.
Time and again passing rushes en
gineered by the Cardinal backfield
were stopped by the fighting Nevada
forwards, who stepped in for an effec
tive yard gaining, dribbling rush.
Brown, securing the ball from the ad
vancing avalanche, started back th.>
Cardinal stonewall with his long
spirals for another onset towards the
Nevadan goal and the shifting game
proceeded. During this process an
unfortunate accident delayed the
game. Settlemeyer, the Nevada front
ranker, broke two ribs. Mitchell re
ceived a cut across the right eye whicti
necessitated two stitches, but he was
still able to play at second flve.
During most of the last period of
play, ihc Cardinal fighters were
camped on their opponent's ten yard
line, but all their attempts to cross tb»
back line of the plainsmen were un
availing. Nevada closely pressed,
fought scrappily at bay and downed
the pigskin behind their line nearly a
round dozen of times.
