# PREPARE FOR BIG GAME
## VARSITY STARTS ON HARD PRACTICE PERIOD. Tuesday and Thursday Scrummages Between Varsity and Second Teamers Until Season's Close. 
### 
With only a period of two weeks and
a half before the Varsity game, the
squad has settled down to the last lap
of hard training. Beginning this after
noon, the Varsity will start their regu
lar Tuesday and Thursday afternoons
set-to with the second team. Monday,
Wednesday and Friday will be devoted
to hard practices on the turf or saw
dust fields.
The two remaining Saturdays will
see the Varsity in action against the
Olympics and Barbarians respectively.
The practicing mates of the Varsity
will meet the University of Southern
California Law School fifteen and St.
Mary's aggregation immediately be
fore the Varsity gets into action on
their week-end games.
Three changes have been made in
the Varsity line-up. Among the for
wards, Frank and Cheda have ex
changed places. Cheda at front rank
should be in a more advantageous
place to start his onset through the
opposing pack, while Frank, at rear
rank, should be more at home and able
to get away quicker from the pack and
start on his fast marrauding expedi
tions when the opponents take charge
of the leather oval. W. Smith, the
formidable second team forward, who
made such a brilliant showing against
Santa Clara last Saturday, is balanc
ing the pack with Dole, as his side
rank mate. Thoburn is now holding
the center unit between the backs of
the line.
Olmstead and Watkins were out in
togs last night after a deserved week's
lay-off after the strenuous battle with
Blue and Gold babies on the 15th.
Reeves, although out for practice the
latter part of last week, was kept on
the side lines by Coach Presley. Boul
ware showed up to advantage with the
second teamers on Saturday, although
new to the position of wing forward.
S. Mitchell, the Varsity first five who
received a glancing cut over the eye in
the Nevadan contest on last Sautrday,
has been threatened with serious
trouble with the wound, due to the
poor work of the Reno physician in
dressing the cut.
Arrell, the Varsity front ranker
whose shoulder was strained in the
game with the "Old Boys" on the
morning of the Freshman Intercolle
giate, is still hooking the ball for the
Varsity pack although he is forced to
wear a shoulder harness.
Minturn's hip continues to brother
him somewhat, although he is still
holding the pack together as lock.
The Varsity has been very fortunate
this year in not having received any
serious injuries. All players who have
been slightly hurt are now out for
hard practice in good shape.
