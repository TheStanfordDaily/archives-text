Today furnishes an excellent oppor
tunity for the introduction of an in
creased support of the Varsity rugby
squad by the Student Body. The
bleacher rally this afternoon gathered
the men together and lent a new inter
est to the side line encouragement,
Why cannot this enthusiasm and ac
tive support by non-combatants be
continued? The team needs every as
sistance this year, as its task is a big
one and if members from among tho
Associated Students cannot aid upon
the field, they are still able to instill a
spirit of loyalty to the team into those
who will take their places upon the
bleachers at Berkeley. Seventeen
days remain before the most impor
tant intercollegiate event of the year
and the Student Body should make Ihe
most of it. Make your presence
known.
