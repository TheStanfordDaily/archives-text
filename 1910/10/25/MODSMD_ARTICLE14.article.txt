## October Number Contains Articles by Professor Flugel, Professor Angell and W.H.B. Fowler, '06. 
### 
The leading article in the October
nuiiilier of "The Stanford Alumniis," 's
an eloquent tribute to the late Pro
fessor .1. E. Matzke from Professor E.
Flugei. W. il. 15. Fowler, '0(5, has con
tributed a page in memory of Harold
Fitch, '07, one of the best-known and
best loved of Stanford's recent gradu
ate. 1 .
An interesting field for discussion is
opened up in an article which gives
the main points of an address made by
Professor Alden at the first meeting
of the Forum this year. Professor Al
len's talk dealt with the present
major-subject system, and the fact that
an increasingly large number of stu
dents do not intend to follow as a vo
cation the work of their major sub
ject. He raised these two questions,
(1) Is the non-vocational student en
titled to a place in Stanford Univer
sity? (2) Does our present organiza
tion provide satisfactorily for his
needs 7
The development of the board of con
trol is described in an article by Pro
fessor F. Angell, the man who has
probably done more for Stanford ath
letics than any other man on the
faculty.
The past month's activities at Stan
ford are ably described, and the num
ber closes with the usual notes of the
doings of various alumni.
