# GIVES STRONG SERMON
## REV. W. KIRK GUTHRIE DELIVERS COMPELLING ADDRESS. "Christ Come to Save that Which Was Lost," is the Theme of the Speaker. 
### 
Rev. W. Kirk Guthrie, pastor of the
First Presbyterian Church of San
Francisco, preached an eloquent, com
pelling sermon at the morning chapel
Sunday. His address was an earnest,
straight forward appeal, effectively
presented.
Taking for the second lesson of the
service, the parables of the lost sheep,
the lost coin and the lost prodical son,
Rev. Guthrie applied them to his cen
tral theme which was embodied in the
text, "Christ came to save that which
was Lost." He showed that careless
ness, environment and self will were
the causes of the loss in the three ex
amples, even as in the case of man
kind. Christ's mission in coming into
the world was to restore those who are
lost.
"Material life is a failure," continued
the speaker. "This is the tragedy of
life that is only realized when we have
grown older. Adversity and the fail
ure of our brightest hopes brings this
home to the most successful of us."
Christ occupies his high position in
the world today because he brings that
which the worldly life lacks, through
the fulfillment of his promise, "I came
that ye might have life."
Rev. Guthrie emphasized the impor
tance of environment as a factor in the
development of every life. Taking the
definition of sin, "This is sin that ye
are not like God," he pointed out the
fact that it was inevitable because of
the conditions surrounding every per
son. If any quality in the human
makeup is out of harmony with its en
vironment that quality will die.
The sermon was concluded with a
discussion of conversion, which the
speaker believed to be a change of
heart brought about by vital struggle,
and not a sudden change of mind
under the stress of a moving sermon.
The music of the service was excel
lent. Mrs. Bibby Brown sang "Fear
Ye Not, O Israel," by Dudley Buck and
"Come Unto Me," from Handel's "Mes
siah." The University choir rendered
an anthem, "Hark, Hark, My Soul," by
Dudley Buck.
