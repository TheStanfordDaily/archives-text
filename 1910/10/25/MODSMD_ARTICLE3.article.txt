### 
Sunday evening, Dr. David Starr
Jordan, who is at present on sabbatical
leave, returned to the campus for a
brief stay preparatory to his depart
ure for the east on business pertain
ing to the International Fish Commis
sion. He will remain on the campus
a little over a week before returning to
the east. On his departure he will go
directly to Toronto, where he will
meet with other members of the Com
mission and settle certain disputes
that have been turned over to this
board for adjudication.
President Jordan's trip to Europe
was two-fold in its purpose. As a
member of the International Zoologic
al Society, which met this year at
Gratz, Austria, he journeyed to that
place and attended the meetings of the
society. At this gathering, all the
most famous zoologists of the world,
representing practically every nation,
were present and the various prob
lems in regard to the advancement of
this particular branch of science were
thoroughly discussed and gone over.
Dr. Jordan delivered one lecture be
fore this distinguished body, on the
"Fur Seal." The lecture was entirely
in German. Dr. Jordan stated to a
representative of the Daily Palo Alto
that he had some difficulty in getting
the proper German accent. "But," he
said, "it was nothing like the diffi
culty 1 had when delivering a lecture
in London, when I attempted to get
the English accent."
After the close of the meeting at
Gratz. Dr. Jordan visited all the most
important European countries, in the
interest of international peace. As a
director of the new International
School of Peace, Dr. Jordan consid
ered it his duty to become acquainted
with the various notable people in
Europe who have evinced a decided
interest in this line of endeavor and
with this purpose in mind he visited
Germany, France, Austria, Switzer
land, Italy, and England.
The International School of Peace
was founded on July 12 last, by Ed
ward Ginn, of Boston, the well known
publisher. Mr. Ginn gave to the
school the sum of $1,000,000, with
which to commence operations, and
appointed Dr. Jordan as one of the six
directors. In Europe the President
made those who were interested in the
cause of peace acquainted with the
purpose of the school. As Dr. Jordan
ihmself expressed it, "We wish to pro
mote the spirit that nations exist fop
the people in the nation and not for
the aggrandizement of chosen few
in tho antion."
It is the plan of the school to submit

al linternational disputes to the
Hague Tribunal, instead of allowing
the disputants to engage in a useless
war, entailing enormous expense, and
loss of life. Dr. Jordan considers this
plan feasible because at the present
time the war debt of the European
powers is so tremendous that they
cannot affor to continue their present
policy of constantly increasing their
armaments. "The war debt of
Europe," said Dr. Jordan, "amounts to
a sum well up in the billions of dol
lars, an dthe interest on this sum an
nually amounts to more than all other
expenditures combined. "There will
be a meeting of the International
Peace Schol some time in November in
the east, at which the President will
be present. At this time the perman
ent directors of the society will be
elected, one of whom will be Dr. Jor
dan.
In Berlin he delivered two lectures,
before notable gatherings, on the sub
ject "Der Krieg und dis Manhaftig
keit," or "War and Mankind." After
his lectures iu Berlin he went to Paris,
where he was entertained as the guest
of honor at several banquets, at two of
which he delivered after-dinners
peeches on the peace movement.
Following this itinerary, he crossed
the English Channel and went to Lon
don, where he visited the Englishmen
most interested in peace. While in the
English metropolis, he delivered two
lectures, the first on "The Peace Move
ment" and second on the subject "The
Race Problems of America." Both of
these lectures were very well received.
While in Switzerland, the president
met with B. W. Upson, '10, and L. S.
Scott, '10, who were taking a motor
cycle trip through Europe. During his
entire trip he was accompanied by H.
R. Stolz, '10, who acted in the capacity
of secretary. Stolz is a t present at
i Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar from
Stanford. The President in London
visited with H. V. Poor, '10, who is
studying art abroad at the present
time.
There are about twelve Stanford
men in London at present in business,
the majority of whom are mining en
gineers. Dr. Jordan entertained them
at the home of H. C. Hoover, '95, the
"Father of the Stanford Union," with
a banquet.
The President will leave for the
east on Friday, November 4, to act in
his capacity as Chairman of the Inter
national Fish Commission. C. A.
Christin, '11, will accompany him as
secretary to the commission at that
time> They will be gone for the rest
o fthe semester.
