# More Freshman Yells Desired
## 
### 
As yet very few yells have been sent
|to the Freshman yell committee.
| Chairman C. C. Close, '14, states that
the committee will soon make its
selection and as it desires a good
number from which to choose, those
who intend writing yells should do so
at once.
