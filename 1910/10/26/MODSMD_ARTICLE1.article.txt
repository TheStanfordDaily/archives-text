# JUNIORS OFFER $50 TO SECURE ORIGINAL OPERA.

### 
The Junior Opera Committee has de
cided to offer a prize of $50 for an orig
inal opera that is to be produced next
semester during Junior Week. The
prize will he awarded to the author of
the opera considered the best by the
committee. The contest is open to all
members of the Student Body. The
manuscripts must be original and must
be handed to the chairman of the com
mittee, C. C. Whitney, on or before
December 1.
The prize is offered in the hope that
a large number of competitors will
submit librettos in order that the com
mittee in their selection will be able to
choose the best local opera. Operas
may be local, fanciful, or of any other
character, the choice remaining en
tirely at the option of the composers.
A number of scores are being com
piled at the present time, which will
be submitted to the committee for their
approval.
The choice of a coach will be de
ferred for several weeks so that the
committee will have time to investigate
this matter thoroughly before deciding
who shall be entrusted with the sup
ervision of the production. The coach
will be selected early enough to allow
him to be present when the operas are
submitted, so that the committee n
receive the benefit of liis experience in
their selection.
The tryouts for the cast, will be con
ducted this semester if there is suffi
cient time remaining after tlie opera
chosen. Rehearsals will start immed
iately after the opening of the spring
semester, so that the production will
not be marred by the effects of a short
period of rehearsing.
Further information may be obtain
ed from the chairman of tho com
mittee.
