The Junior Class lias adopted the
policy of fostering the production of
dramatic work by local talent. This
is an attitude upon the part of that
class that deserves commendation and
is to be encouraged, especially at the
present time, when but very little work
of this nature is seen at Stanford. The
adoption of a Plug-Ugly farce manu
script by the Junior Committee having
charge of that event, is a fair example
of the possibilities that may be reached
in the fostering of this custom. This
selection of the abovementioned score
came only after a careful comparison
of three eminently clever literary pro
ductions, the standard attained by all
being very much above the average.
With such talent existant within the
Student Body, there is no reason why
there should not be possibilities for the
presentation of an excellent opera en
tirely the work of local amateur play
wrights and composers. The interest
of the Student Body is entirely with a
production of this nature when such
opera reaches a certain standard, and
it the librettos submitted to the Junior
Opera Committee are upon a par com
paratively with the Plug-Ugly scores,
they will insure a greater attention
from those who comprise the audience
of every theatrical production, than
has been heretofore secured in recent
years. It. is to be hoped that this op
portunity will be taken advantage of
by all those who have the ability to
produce such productions. There are
many in the Student Body and an ef
fort upon their part should produce
many excellent results.
