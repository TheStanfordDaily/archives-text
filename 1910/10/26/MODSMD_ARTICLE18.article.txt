# STUDENTS WILL ORGANIZE STANFORD FORESTRY CLUB.
## Perfection of Organization and Election of Officers Will Take Place at Next Meeting. 
### 
That Stanford should have a Fores
try Club, similar in its purpose to such
organizations in other colleges, was
the decision of a number of students
of the Systematic Botany department,
who gathered for an informal meeting
last Saturday night. The organization
of the club and the election of officers
will take place at the next meeting.
Last year a few students agitated
this plan, but met with little success as
no regular organization was perfected.
This year, however, meetings will lie
held at least twice each month, the
object being to bring together those
interested in forestry, and to discuss
matters of current interest on that
subject.
Several students have already signi
fied their intention of becoming mem
bers of the new organization, and all
others who desire to join are requested
to hand their names to Professor L. R.
Abrams of the Botany department.
