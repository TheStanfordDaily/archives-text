# ROOSEVELT WIELDS BIG STICK AT CONVENTION
## Ex-President Nominated by Nestoria for Third Term.â€”Standpatters Badly Defeated. 
### 
There was no stopping the steam
roller at the meeting of the Nestoria
Literary Society yesterday evening,
when Theodore Roosevelt was trium
phantly renominated for a third term.
Despite the boast of the stalwarts that
they would consign the Colonel to his
political grave, they were unable to
rally their forces at the psychological
moment and the bear hunter came to
his own. The fatal mistake of the
standpatters was their inability to
unite on an opposition candidate, most
of their strength being divided between
candidates from the Student Affairs
Committee and C. H. Meyers.
E. E. Tincher, '12, was the triumph
ant candidate for temporary chairman
and being in accordance with the
Rooseveltian principles he appointed
committees on rules, platform, and
credentials to wield the Big Stick. The
credential committee tried hard to un
seat three of the opposition, but the
production of Roble "at home" bids as
proof of their good standing, saved
them from expulsion.
The sergeant-at-arms had consider
able difficulty in keeping the members
in order, as they frequently got beyond
the control of the chairman.
