# LINE UP HELD LAST EVENING ON TURF FIELD.
## Varsity and Second Team Engage in Fast Practice Game of Two Halves. 
### 
The Varsity defeated the second
team by a score of 26-0 in a pretty ex
hibition of rugby during a thirty min
ute set-to yesterday afternoon.
One of the prettiest passing rushes
ever engineered on Stanford Field was
featured in yesterday's bout between
the Varsity and the second aggrega
tion. From a scrum at the substitutes
2H, Erb secured the pigskin and started
Sundell tearing through the loose, a
pretty pass at ten put Harrigan across
for a sensational first try. The six
minutes of play preceding was marked
by listless playing, but with this man
oeuver the Varsity awoke and one man
after another was sent across the line
for tries until at the end of thirty min
utes the tally stood 23-0. Of the six
tries scored, Brown recorded eight
points by converting the last four of
the sextette.
The second team put up a plucky
fight and but for the brilliant playing
of the Varsity group, they would have
held them to a low score. The sub
stitutes started in by holding their
opponents at midfield. After four min
utes of play, the Varsity had edged
down to the second team's five yard
line. Boulware seized his opportunity
and downed Erb before he could pass
and dribbled the Varsity players back
to 25. Here the sensational passing
rush of the afternoon between Erb,
Sundell and Harrigan changed the tide
of battle.
From a five yard encampment, Erb
went through for a try. Smith, the
newly discovered forward, was tha
next across with a dribble from ten
and Brown began his quartet of con
versions. Kern's long strides carried
him across for the fourth try after a
passing rush between Erb, Harrigan
and Kern.
This ended the first fifteen minutes
and Coach Pre3ley introduced a new
sot of second teamers. Olmstead, Mor
ton, Baumgartner, Schaupp, Wood
cock, Ca'-'s, Reeves, and King bein-v
placed in the Varsity ranks.p
Cheda introduced the new line-up to
a try from a scrum at. five, which
Brown converted after a long passing
rush between a dozen of the Varsity
players from midfield. Woodcock
drove through the second team line of
defense for a try. From near tho side
line 3 Brown spiralei a fourth conver
sion.
The scrummage was stopped a'te
half a i hour's action when the fresher
second teamers were just beginning to
drive the Varsity on the defensive to
wards their back line. Only twice be
fore had the second team been within
speaking distance of the Varsity line,
but even then Brown's long boots to
touch immediately sent the substi
tutes back to midfield, where his mates
soon carried the game into their op
ponents territory.
Mitchell was unable to appear at
second five, the cut received at Reno
still making it advisable to keep the
veteran on the side line 3. Schaupp,
during the last few minutes of play,
tore one of the tendons in his ankle
and had to be taken out of the
' game.

of battle.
From a five yard encampment, Erb
went through for a try. Smith, the
newly discovered forward, was tha
next across with a dribble from ten
and Brown began his quartet of con
versions. Kern's long strides carried
him across for the fourth try after a
passing rush between Erb, Harrigan
and Kern.
This ended the first fifteen minutes
and Coach Pre3ley introduced a new
sot of second teamers. Olmstead, Mor
ton, Baumgartner, Schaupp, Wood
cock, Ca'-'s, Reeves, and King bein-v
placed in the Varsity ranks.p
Cheda introduced the new line-up to
a try from a scrum at. five, which
Brown converted after a long passing
rush between a dozen of the Varsity
players from midfield. Woodcock
drove through the second team line of
defense for a try. From near tho side
line 3 Brown spiralei a fourth conver
sion.
The scrummage was stopped a'te
half a i hour's action when the fresher
second teamers were just beginning to
drive the Varsity on the defensive to
wards their back line. Only twice be
fore had the second team been within
speaking distance of the Varsity line,
but even then Brown's long boots to
touch immediately sent the substi
tutes back to midfield, where his mates
soon carried the game into their op
ponents territory.
Mitchell was unable to appear at
second five, the cut received at Reno
still making it advisable to keep the
veteran on the side line 3. Schaupp,
during the last few minutes of play,
tore one of the tendons in his ankle
and had to be taken out of the
' game.
