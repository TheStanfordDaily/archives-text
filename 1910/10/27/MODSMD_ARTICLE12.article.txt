As a matter of information, the Daily
Palo Alto wishes to inform the"Daily
Californian" that their interpretation
of the communication forwarded to
California from Stanford concerning
the boating situation is erroneous and
misleading.
Editorially they say, "The situation
that now confronts the Executive
Committee is very slightly changed
except for the possibility of estab
lishing the sport on the limited basis
proposed by Stanford. If California
is going to take up another branch of
athletics, it should be done without
unnatural limitation or not at all."
Stanford has not proposed the .$lOOO
limitation as an agreement between
the two universities. No condition of
this kind is involved in the question
as submitted to the Executive Com
mittee of the University of California.
The local Executive Committee
agreed to award the Lagunita Rowing
Committee sufficient funds to finance
the sport this year with a maximum
expenditure placed at $1000, but this
was not forwarded to California as a
condition to be adopted by them in
case they took up rowing. Further
more, by personal interviews with the
members of the Executive Committee
of the x\ssociated Students of the Uni
versity of California and by personal
letters this point was made clear to
them. This misinterpretation of such
an evident proposition seems inex
plainable in view of the fact that such
special efforts were made by members
of the Stanford Student llody to make
the matter clear. It. is to be hoped
that, such an error will be corrected
before a vote is taken by the Executive
Committee and that this erroneous
interpretation of a communication will
not affect their decision in the adop
tion of rowing as an intercollegiate

sport. Stanford is ready to enter this
department of athletics with what she
considers the requisite amount of ex
penditures and the amount to be used
by her rival will not prohibit her from
entering this department of athletics.
A careful perusal of the communica
tion will give California the correct
meaning of the letter. Such perusal
should be made before prejudicing the
Associated Students against such a
worthy movement.
