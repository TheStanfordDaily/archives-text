An advance reading by Professor B.
E. Howard, of the Economics depart
ment, from hi 3 new work on the pres
ent Kaiser of Germany was a feature
in the program of the Cosmopolitan
Club, which met at the Faculty Club
House last evening. The extract was
entitled "The Dismissal of Bismarck."
A splendid reading of Elihu Root's ad
dress on International Law, by Pro
lessor J. C. Bonne 11 of the English de
partment, was also enjoyed by the
club members. The program was fol
lowed by a business and social meet
ing. An open meeting with a lecture,
under the auspices of the Cosmopoli
tans, will probably be held in the
Chapel next Wednesday evening.
