# COMBINED MUSICAL CLUBS POSTPONE NOVEMBER CONCERT.
## Entertainment Scheduled for Next Month to be Given Sometime in the Spring. 
### 
The concert scheduled by the Com
bined Musical Clubs has been post
poned until next semester, when it
will be given at an early date. This
action was found necessary because
of the lateness in arrival from the east
of the new music ordered by the Man
dolin Club. The music arrived a week
ago and it has been found impossible
to rehearse it in such shape for pre
sentation to the public in November.
Several concert trips to San Jose,
Santa Cruz, Belmont and other nearby
towns are in prospect for both the
Glee and Mandolin Clubs. The dates
are far enough ahead so that excellent
programs of music may be rehearsed
in time for them.
Both clubs will practice twice a
week from now on, on Tuesday and
Thursday evenings. As there are
men who are members of both organi
zations, the practices are so arranged
that they will not conflict.
