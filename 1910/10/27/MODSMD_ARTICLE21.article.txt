# Tennis Courts Being Repaired.
## 
### 
Another coating of oil is being put
on the three Eucina courts which were
built last semester. These courts have
never been fit for good tennis, and on
this account, the intercollegiate tour
nament last year had to be transferred
to the University of California. By
putting on an additional layer of oil,
it. is thought that they can be putin
first class shape. All those who at
tend the football practices are re
quested to keep off the courts while
they are being repaired.
