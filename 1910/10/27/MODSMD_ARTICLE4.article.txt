# STUDENTS LOSE HEAVILY FROM WORK OF SNEAK THIEF.
## Watches and Money Lost by Men Using Encina Gymnasium During 11:15 Period. 
### 
The most serious thefts that have
occured on the campus this semester,
were committed at Encina gymnasium,
between 11:30 and 12:15 this morning.
All the members of the 11:15 class
were out on the soccer field for rugby
practice, leaving the gymnasium
empty. Some individual took advan
tage of this fact and thoroughly ran
sacked all clothing lel't. outside tlie
lockers and even found keys and
opened lockers. Among the heaviest
losers were R. M. Good, $."() gold
watch: Y>. E. Smith, pocket book con
taining $20; C. M. Smith, silver watch;
11. H. Mosher, $5, while other students
lost varying sums.
While no absolute evidence has been
obtained as to the identity of the thief,
suspicion points strongly to a well
dressed stranger who loitered around
the gymnasium while the men were
getting rea:ly for class. The Palo Alto
authorities and the shori.T's oflice ;it
Redwood City and San Jose have been
given descriptions of the man and
every endeavor will be made to locate
him.
