## "DEVIL'S DISCIPLE" CAST HOLD FINAL REHEARSALS. Coach Mathieu Giving Double Dress Rehearsals for Each Act.â€”Properties to be Apropos. 
### 
Final preparations for"The Devil's
Disciple" are now complete. Last
evening tlie first dross rehearsal of tho
big scene in the lust act was held. All
of tho seventy people who will be
seen on the stage the night of the per
formance were present last evening,
and they donned, for the first time, the
costumes which they will wear. Coach
Math ion has been somewhat doubtful
as to the advisability of having so
many on the stage for this last big
scene, but the showing made by the
supernumeraries last evening made
him certain that it would be a greater
success than he had thought possible.
The costumes are very eceetive. The
gaudy colors of the soldiers' uniforms
and the unique dress of the various
townspeople making a more interest
ing costume scene than has been
staged for some time. No care has
been spared to make the costumes ac
curate down to the smallest detail.
K. Chamberlain, '11, who is acting
as property man for the performance
has, by dint of much searching, dis
covered several old pieces of furniture,
which date from the Revolutionary
period, which will add materially to
the setting of the various scenes. All
of the properties are either actual
heirlooms from the period of the play
or exact replicas of the various pieces
as used at that time.
The only bit of property for which it
was unnecessary to search in order to
make it fit the period, was the gallows,
which scene-maker Lyons has con
structed. It has been found that gal
lows at the time of the Revolution did
not differ materially from those em
ployed at present.
Coach Mathieu is employing a new
plan iti regard to dress rehearsals for
"The Devil's Disciple." In the past
but one dress rehearsal has been held
for the various plays that have been
presented. Because of the difficulty in
presenting Shaw's creations and be
cause he is desirous of making the
play more than successful, Coach
Mathieu has decided to hold two dress
rehearsals for each act. One act is
being given a complete scenic and
property rehearsal each evening, and
tomorrow the final dress rehearsal
of the entire play will be held. This
plan will undoubtedly secure a more
perfectly presented play than has been
possible under the plan employed in
the past.
There are a few good seats still
available at the Stanford Bookstore
and at the Stanford Pharmacy in Palo
Altc.
