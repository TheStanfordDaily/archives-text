# ALL STAR AGGREGATION TO MEET VARSITY SATURDAY.
## Thiele and Beeper Will Form Battery for Veterans in Second Game of the Fall Season. 
### 
An all-star team will appear on the
auxiliary field Saturday morning to
line up against the Varsity players in
the second game of the fall baseball
season. The line-up of the latter team
will remain practically the same as in
the game against the Santa Clara
players last Saturday.
Under the leadership of W. C.
Thiele, OS, the all-star aggregation is
expected to make the contest a par
ticularly fast one. They will line-up
as follows: Pitcher, Thiele; catcher,
Beeger; first base, Cadwalader, second
base, Halm; third base, Donovan;
shortstop, Peters; left field, Dooling;
centerfield, Richardson; right field,
O'Donnell.
The showing made by the Varsity
against Santa Clara last week, gives
promise of an exceptionally good ex
hibition of ball on llieir part in Satur
day's game. Jones and Gault will
probably alternate in the box with
Henshaw receiving. The game will be
called at 10:30 sharp.
