# EXECUTIVE BOARD RECEIVES RESIGNATION OF H.E. REED.
## Baseball Captain-elect will not Reenter University Next Semester. Coaching Situation Unsettled. 
### 
At the regular weekly meeting of
the Executive Committee but one mat
ter of importance was considered. A
letter was received from baseball cap
tain-elect H. E. Reed, '10, submitting
his resignation as captain for the sea
son of 1911. This leaves the baseball
situation in a rather unsettled con
dition. Had Reed returned to college
he would have probably acted as
coach for the team for the coming
spring. As it is, a new captain will
have to be elected. Whether he will
act, as coach has not been decided by
the committee. The Executive Com
mittee last year decided to employ as
coach W. C. Theile, '08, but owing to
some difficulties, this engagement was
cancelled and it was understood that
the captain-elect would act as coach.
The committee will probably take ac
tion on this point in the near future.
The minutes of the meeting follow:
President G. A. Ditz in the chair.
Brown and Burbank absent.
The minutes of the meeting of
October 19 were read and approved.
H. Cheda was appointed as a rubber.
Moved, seconded and passed that
$8.90 be paid to H. Horton to cover the
deficit occuring on the Eastern track
meet in 1908.
A letter was received from H. E.
Reed containing his resignation as
baseball captain.
Meeting adjourned.
J. ERNEST THOMPSON,
Secretary of Student Body.
