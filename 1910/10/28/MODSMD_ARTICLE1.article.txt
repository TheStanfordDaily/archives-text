# "THE DEVIL'S DISCIPLE" WILL BE SEEN TOMORROW EVENING
## 
### 
Promptly at 8:15 tomorrow evening
when the curtain rises on "The Devil's
Disciple," the supporters of dramatics
at Stanford will see the opening of
what promises to be one of the most
successful performances ever present
ed at the University.
Work on the piece has progressed
with more than usual success, and
Coach Mathieu feels confident that the
play will be among the best that he
has ever coached.
Scenically, and from the standpoint
of costuming, the play will be preten
tious. Certain operas have employed
as elaborate costuming, but it has
never been attempted with a straight
play.
in the title role of "The Devil's Dis
ciple," R. H. Seward, '12, will be given
an extraordinary opportunity to dis
play his ability as an actor of the first
rank. Seward needs no introduction
to Stanford audiences as he has ap
peared in practically every play of im
portance since his matriculation. He
has assumed the leading role in "Arms
and the Man," another Shaw play, in
"The Liars," "The Road to Yester
day," "Secret Service" and "Op-o-
Me-Thumb." As Richard Dudgeon, he
is expected by Coach Mathieu to be
more successful than in any previous
endeavor.
Miss G. Workman, '12, wil assume
the lead opposite to Richard, in the
role of Judith Anderson. This will be
Miss Workman's first opportunity to
appear to the best advantage on a
Stanford stage, as the parts that she
has taken in the past have not been of
a kind to suit, her particular ability.
This role is one of the finest parts for
a. woman that Shaw ha-? produced and

Miss Workman will appear in it to
particular advantage.
As Anthony Anderson, the lighting
minister, R. Woodville, '11, will be
seen in another part exactly suited to
him. Wooilville has played in "7-20-S,"
"Twelfth Night," and"The Man from
Home." Woodvilie's part is the most
difficult that he has yet taken, but he
is carrying it remarkaby well.
In the role of General Burgoyne, M.
W. Strong, '11, will have an excep
tional chance to create a part that
ranks among Shaw's best. Strong,
who has appeared in"The Man from
Home" and "Cousin Kate," is giving a
finished piece of work.
Miss M. Wilson, '11, who appears as
the tyrannical mother of the Dudgeon
household, has in her part one not dis
similar to others that she has assumed
before. Miss Wilson has taken part in
"7-20-S" and"The Road to Yesterday,"
As Essie, (he poor litte waif, Miss F.
Wendling, '12, will be seen to the best
advantage. Although the lines of this
part are few, it offers an extraordi
nary chance for the finest acting. Miss
Wendling, who has appeared in "Sec
ret Service," is playing quite up to th«
part.
As Christy, the comedy part of the
play, J. Beman, '12, has found a role
exactly suited to his abilities.
B. H. Lasky, who was seen in"The
Man from Home," will appear as Titus
Dudgeon.
Others who wil assume parts, but
who are new to the Stanford stage are,
H. C. Nelson, as Uncle William, J. E.
Thompson, '10, as Lawyer Hawkins, P.
Eliel, '13, as Major Swindon, H. R,
Spence, '13, as the Seargeant, and C.
M. Vrang, '13, as Chaplain Brundell.
Miss R. Haslett, who appears as
Mrs. William Dudgeon, was a member
of the "Beauty Chorus" in the 1909
Football show. Miss I. Bullis, '13,
takes the part of Mrs. Titus Dudgeon.

similar to others that she has assumed
before. Miss Wilson has taken part in
"7-20-S" and"The Road to Yesterday,"
As Essie, (he poor litte waif, Miss F.
Wendling, '12, will be seen to the best
advantage. Although the lines of this

nary chance for the finest acting. Miss
Wendling, who has appeared in "Sec
ret Service," is playing quite up to th«
part.
As Christy, the comedy part of the
play, J. Beman, '12, has found a role
exactly suited to his abilities.

Promptly at 8:15 tomorrow evening
when the curtain rises on "The Devil's
Disciple," the supporters of dramatics
at Stanford will see the opening of
what promises to be one of the most
successful performances ever present
ed at the University.
Work on the piece has progressed
with more than usual success, and
Coach Mathieu feels confident that the
play will be among the best that he
has ever coached.
Scenically, and from the standpoint
of costuming, the play will be preten
tious. Certain operas have employed
as elaborate costuming, but it has
never been attempted with a straight
play.
in the title role of "The Devil's Dis
ciple," R. H. Seward, '12, will be given
an extraordinary opportunity to dis
play his ability as an actor of the first
rank. Seward needs no introduction
to Stanford audiences as he has ap
peared in practically every play of im
portance since his matriculation. He
has assumed the leading role in "Arms
and the Man," another Shaw play, in
"The Liars," "The Road to Yester
day," "Secret Service" and "Op-o-
Me-Thumb." As Richard Dudgeon, he
is expected by Coach Mathieu to be
more successful than in any previous
endeavor.
Miss G. Workman, '12, wil assume
the lead opposite to Richard, in the
role of Judith Anderson. This will be
Miss Workman's first opportunity to
appear to the best advantage on a
Stanford stage, as the parts that she
has taken in the past have not been of
a kind to suit, her particular ability.
This role is one of the finest parts for
a. woman that Shaw ha-? produced and

Miss Workman will appear in it to
particular advantage.
As Anthony Anderson, the lighting
minister, R. Woodville, '11, will be
seen in another part exactly suited to
him. Wooilville has played in "7-20-S,"
"Twelfth Night," and"The Man from
Home." Woodvilie's part is the most
difficult that he has yet taken, but he
is carrying it remarkaby well.
In the role of General Burgoyne, M.
W. Strong, '11, will have an excep
tional chance to create a part that
ranks among Shaw's best. Strong,
who has appeared in"The Man from
Home" and "Cousin Kate," is giving a
finished piece of work.
Miss M. Wilson, '11, who appears as
the tyrannical mother of the Dudgeon
household, has in her part one not dis
similar to others that she has assumed
before. Miss Wilson has taken part in
"7-20-S" and"The Road to Yesterday,"
