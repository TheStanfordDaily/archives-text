# CORRESPONDENT FOR PAPER INDEFINITELY SUSPENDED
## 
### 
James W. Henderson, '12, of Eureka,
a member of the Daily Palo Alto staiT
and correspondent of the San Fran
cisco Call, was today Indefinitely sus
pended from the University by the Stu
dent Affairs committee. The grounds
which the committee claim justify
them in their action were that Hen
derson "was an accessory to the pub
lication of articles which were false
and derogatory to the University."
The article to which exception was
taken appears below. It was not
written by Henderson himself, but the
mere facts were communicated to the
city by telephone, the article being
written in the editorial rooms of the
Call.
It seems that the offense consisted
in the fact that the article intimated
that the girls were light, frivolous and
giggly; that they thought more of get
ting the men away from the environs
of Roble than of extinguishing the
fire; in short, that it lowered the esti
mation of University girls in the eyes
of the world.
Stanford University, Oct. 15 —Rather
than face the grinning countenances of
some 50 men of Stanford University, a
score of girls in one of the dormitories
of Roble hall, clad in their night
gowns, bath robes and kimonas, fought
a fire which had broken out in the hall
themselves, last night, and ultimately,
when the task proved too much for
them, sought the safety of secluded
rooms in the buildidng. But they re
fused to leave the place.
The attention of the students was
called to the blaze at 9:30 o'clock p.m.
by a volley of shrieks and screams
which awoke the echoes in the utter
most parts of the grounds. Every
available man ran to the rescue, but
on arriving at the scene they discover
ed the girls refused to be rescued—in
their night robes.
"Go away, please," said a frightened
co-ed, poking a {lushed face through
the half open door.
"Come out and be rescued," shouted
the throng.
An odor of burning cheese floated
through the hall and was greeted with
a howl of delight.
"Ah-h-h, chafing dish party?"
There was p. furious stampede in
side the hall, giggles and shrieks, for
chafing dish parties in dormitories
were against the regulations of the
university.
"Please, please go away," begged the

distressed maidens. "We'll get out if
you go away."
Whereat the rescuers with one ac
cord sat down to await results. All
that could be seen of the fire was a
puff of smoke, but it could be smelled.
Most noticeably could it be smelled.
There was a minute's pause and then
the rescuers went to work.
"Look out!" they shouted; "we are
coming."
A yell or horror greeted the an
nouncement, but while the girls
screamed and scurried around the
men burst in. The fire was in the an
nex of the third floor, and the ruthless
males trampled through the sacred
precincts in order to reach it. They
found there that the fire had spread
to the curtains and was making gay
havoc among lingerie, silk hosiery,
dainty shoes and celluloid combs.
Three squirts with an extinguisher put
it out, and then the gallant band left
the spot in dignity and with that leis
ure becoming to the sterner sex.
How the fire started none of the
girls would say. "But the smell of
that burning cheese was vile," said a
rescue;.
Another article, for the appearance
of which in the San Francisco daily,
the correspondent was held liable,
dealt with the suspension of a student
at the close of the spring semester last
year. The reasons for the suspension
of this man were matters of common
gossip on the campus. Henderson, on
a trip to the city, narrated the story
to a personal friend, a former Stanford
student. Several days later, the story
reached the ears of the city editor of
the Call, who immediately dispatched
a man to cover the detail.
In the story turned in by the special
writer a portion read as follows, to
which the Student Affairs Committee
took special exception:
"The intervention of the Student Af
fairs Committee of Stanford University
into the field of romance, has caused
consternation on the campus. Here
tofore the committee has contented
itsef by regulating the sleeping and
waking hours of the students; the
amount of study they could take; the
number of steins they could consum;
—off the campus,—and such trivial
regulations, which merely disturb the
traditions of the college. No effort has
been made to control adventurous ro
mance or penalize a recreant lover."

James W. Henderson, '12, of Eureka,
a member of the Daily Palo Alto staiT
and correspondent of the San Fran
cisco Call, was today Indefinitely sus
pended from the University by the Stu
dent Affairs committee. The grounds
which the committee claim justify
them in their action were that Hen
derson "was an accessory to the pub
lication of articles which were false
and derogatory to the University."
The article to which exception was
taken appears below. It was not
written by Henderson himself, but the
mere facts were communicated to the
city by telephone, the article being
written in the editorial rooms of the
Call.
It seems that the offense consisted
in the fact that the article intimated
that the girls were light, frivolous and
giggly; that they thought more of get
ting the men away from the environs
of Roble than of extinguishing the
fire; in short, that it lowered the esti
mation of University girls in the eyes
of the world.
Stanford University, Oct. 15 —Rather
than face the grinning countenances of
some 50 men of Stanford University, a
score of girls in one of the dormitories
of Roble hall, clad in their night
gowns, bath robes and kimonas, fought
a fire which had broken out in the hall
themselves, last night, and ultimately,
when the task proved too much for
them, sought the safety of secluded
rooms in the buildidng. But they re
fused to leave the place.
The attention of the students was
called to the blaze at 9:30 o'clock p.m.
by a volley of shrieks and screams
which awoke the echoes in the utter
most parts of the grounds. Every
available man ran to the rescue, but
on arriving at the scene they discover
ed the girls refused to be rescued—in
their night robes.
"Go away, please," said a frightened
co-ed, poking a {lushed face through
the half open door.
"Come out and be rescued," shouted
the throng.
An odor of burning cheese floated
through the hall and was greeted with
a howl of delight.
"Ah-h-h, chafing dish party?"
There was p. furious stampede in
side the hall, giggles and shrieks, for
chafing dish parties in dormitories
were against the regulations of the
university.
"Please, please go away," begged the

distressed maidens. "We'll get out if
you go away."
Whereat the rescuers with one ac
cord sat down to await results. All
that could be seen of the fire was a
puff of smoke, but it could be smelled.
Most noticeably could it be smelled.
There was a minute's pause and then
the rescuers went to work.
"Look out!" they shouted; "we are
coming."
A yell or horror greeted the an
nouncement, but while the girls
screamed and scurried around the
men burst in. The fire was in the an
nex of the third floor, and the ruthless
males trampled through the sacred
precincts in order to reach it. They
found there that the fire had spread
to the curtains and was making gay
havoc among lingerie, silk hosiery,
dainty shoes and celluloid combs.
Three squirts with an extinguisher put
it out, and then the gallant band left
the spot in dignity and with that leis
ure becoming to the sterner sex.
How the fire started none of the
girls would say. "But the smell of
that burning cheese was vile," said a
rescue;.
Another article, for the appearance
of which in the San Francisco daily,
the correspondent was held liable,
dealt with the suspension of a student
at the close of the spring semester last
year. The reasons for the suspension
of this man were matters of common
gossip on the campus. Henderson, on
a trip to the city, narrated the story
to a personal friend, a former Stanford
student. Several days later, the story
reached the ears of the city editor of
the Call, who immediately dispatched
a man to cover the detail.
In the story turned in by the special
writer a portion read as follows, to
which the Student Affairs Committee
took special exception:
"The intervention of the Student Af
fairs Committee of Stanford University
into the field of romance, has caused
consternation on the campus. Here
