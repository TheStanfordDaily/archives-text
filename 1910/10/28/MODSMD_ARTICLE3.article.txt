# FIRST SOCCER TEAM PLAYS SAN FRANCISCOS TOMORROW.
## 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon the First Soc
cer team from Encina Gymnasium will
line up for one of the hardest games ">f
the season, when they are scheduled to
meet the San Franciscos at the Presi
dio grounds in the city.
Professor Maloney yesterday re-i
ceived a letter from the Sacramento
Valley Association Football League
offering to pay the expenses of the
first team for a game in that city on
Thanksgiving Day, but as they are al
ready scheduled to play the United
States soldiers at that time, the matter
will in all probability be dropped until
some future date.
The team as picked by Instructor
Maloney is as follows: Forwards,
Williams, Pellas, Pung, Higgins and
Lyne; halves, Humphreys, Reynolds,
and Hamilton; fulls, McCann (capt.l
and Clyde; goal, Steuart.
