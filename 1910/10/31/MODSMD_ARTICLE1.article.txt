Sixteen times did the Cardinal fight
ing machine pierce the Barbarian de
fence for a try on Saturday afternoon
to roll up a score of 60-0 against the
visiting team. The Barbarians had to
be strengthened by four Cardinal
players and were hopelessly out
classed from the start, but they put
up a plucky though unavailing de
fense, until darkness necessitated the
calling of the game with ten miute3 to
be played.
The Varsity played in excellent
form, practically every man being i:i
the limelight at least once. All the
star players played as they were ex

a field goal, but he was unable to
make a conversion and Dole's boot
scored the six conversions accredited
to the Cardinal.
