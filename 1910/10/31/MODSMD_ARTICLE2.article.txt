# SHAW PLAY IS WELL PRESENTED
## Critic Takes Audience to Task.—Claims Lack of Appreciation of Play Characterized by Artistic Performance. 
### 
The Stanford playgoer, who has
been attending performances at the
Assembly Hall for the last two or
three years, is inclined to take a good
deal for granted. Settling himself in
his seat, he opens the well-made little
program without a thought of its
typographical good form; the music of
the University orchestra strikes up,
and he raises his eyes, first tot ake in
the musicians with the incurious
glance of one satisfied, but not espec
ially clairaudient, then to let his un
offended gaze rest for a moment on the
tranquil dignity of the new curtain;
contented, he falls to perusing the
cast of characters.
"This ought to be a pretty good
show," he comments. "Here are Miss
Wilson and Miss Workman and Mr.
Woodville, three W's whom we know;
and two S's equally familiar, Mr.
Strong, and in the tite role, Mr. Sew
ard. These are all veterans." The
name of the yell-leader in the list
awakens expectations. But commenc
ing with the assumption that it ought
to be a good show anyhow, the play
goer is for the rest prepared to criti
cise everything pretty much as though
it were professional rather than ama
teur
An old grad at his elbow —a man
who comes back to college with the
memory of home-made plays in home
made settings at the gymnasium, still
in mind —nudged him.
"It strikes me that is pretty good
work the orchestra are doing," he

says; "where do they come in? I don't
see any mention of them on the pro
grame"
The rising of the curtain (or should
fay the drawing?) cuts short the sur
prised playgoer's explanation, as the
old grad turns his whole attention to
the stage
All through the evening the two
points of view meet, touch, cross,
break off, and meet again. The old
grad is struck with the fact that col
lege players are giving such a play as
Shaw's the "Devil's Disciple"; he is
thinking of the boisterous farce that
used to set the gymnasium on a roar.
The playgoer mildly compares its mer
its with those of "Arms and the Man"
two years ago. The old grad is
charmed with the light effects, the
settings, properties, costumes, the
general excellence of the whole cast,
the smoothness of the whole perfor
mance in lines, action, and shifting of
scenes. The playgoer thinks that in
some points, perhaps, it is better than
the average; but with Sword and San
dals and the Masquers both in it, it
ought to be. You should have seen
the "Man from Home."
Of the individual players—taking
principals in the order of their first
appearance—the results of the discus
sion were somewhat as follows:
Miss Wilson as Mrs. Dudgeon, a very
harsh and bitter character, played
with an intensity that preserved the
undercurrent of seriousness through-
out the first act. Especially her action
and expression while others were
speaking, deserve notice.
Woodville, as Anthony Anderson,
the most sympathetic part in the pay,
was a strong, kindly, and charming
parson. The scene in which he sud
denly, realizing Richard's danger,
ceases to be parson and becomes fight
ing man, was his best scene, a good
climax.
The same scene was a very diffi
cult one for Miss Workman, who as
Judith Anderson, his wife, misunder
stands Anthony's sudden transforma
tion. The lines, which call for great
subtlety, were well rendered, but the
part does not strongly appeal to the
sympathies of the audience, and af
fords no climax to speak of. It was,
however, rendered with ease and
finish.
The title role was played by Seward
with his customary genial vigor. His
best scene was that in which the sol
diers take him for Anderson.
Miss F. Wendling, as Essie, was
naive and appealing; J. C. Beman
showed promise as a comedian in the
part of foolish Christie; yell-leader
Thompson as the cracked-voiced law
yer, and "Skipper" Nelson, as the re
formed drunkard were hits of the
evening; B. 11. Lasky, as Uncle Titus,
H. R. Spence, as the Sergeant, and C.
M. Vrang as the Chaplain were also
good. As the British officers, M. W.
Strong (General Burgoyne) and P.
Eliel (Major Swindon) presented a
dramatic contrast of calm politness
and a somewhat juvenile firey temper.
The performance was decidely suc
cessful, maintaining a high standard
throughout. Perhaps we are not al
ways as appreciative as we might be
of amateur art.
The Stanford audience is inclined to
be a little captious and personal in
criticism, taking good qualities for
granted, and unconsciously applying
professional standards to players who
even as college veterans have been in
only half a dozen plays. With a little
thought, one might perceive excel
lences that are peculiar to the ama
teur.

in mind —nudged him.
"It strikes me that is pretty good
work the orchestra are doing," he

says; "where do they come in? I don't
see any mention of them on the pro
grame"
The rising of the curtain (or should
fay the drawing?) cuts short the sur
prised playgoer's explanation, as the
old grad turns his whole attention to
the stage
All through the evening the two
points of view meet, touch, cross,
break off, and meet again. The old
grad is struck with the fact that col
lege players are giving such a play as
Shaw's the "Devil's Disciple"; he is
thinking of the boisterous farce that
used to set the gymnasium on a roar.
The playgoer mildly compares its mer
its with those of "Arms and the Man"
two years ago. The old grad is
charmed with the light effects, the
settings, properties, costumes, the
general excellence of the whole cast,
the smoothness of the whole perfor
mance in lines, action, and shifting of
scenes. The playgoer thinks that in
some points, perhaps, it is better than
the average; but with Sword and San
dals and the Masquers both in it, it
ought to be. You should have seen
the "Man from Home."
Of the individual players—taking
principals in the order of their first
appearance—the results of the discus
sion were somewhat as follows:
Miss Wilson as Mrs. Dudgeon, a very
harsh and bitter character, played
with an intensity that preserved the
undercurrent of seriousness through-
out the first act. Especially her action
and expression while others were
speaking, deserve notice.
Woodville, as Anthony Anderson,
the most sympathetic part in the pay,
was a strong, kindly, and charming
parson. The scene in which he sud
denly, realizing Richard's danger,
ceases to be parson and becomes fight
ing man, was his best scene, a good
climax.
The same scene was a very diffi
cult one for Miss Workman, who as
Judith Anderson, his wife, misunder
stands Anthony's sudden transforma
tion. The lines, which call for great
subtlety, were well rendered, but the
part does not strongly appeal to the
sympathies of the audience, and af
fords no climax to speak of. It was,
however, rendered with ease and
finish.
The title role was played by Seward
with his customary genial vigor. His
best scene was that in which the sol
diers take him for Anderson.
Miss F. Wendling, as Essie, was
naive and appealing; J. C. Beman
showed promise as a comedian in the
part of foolish Christie; yell-leader
Thompson as the cracked-voiced law
yer, and "Skipper" Nelson, as the re
formed drunkard were hits of the
evening; B. 11. Lasky, as Uncle Titus,
H. R. Spence, as the Sergeant, and C.
M. Vrang as the Chaplain were also
good. As the British officers, M. W.
Strong (General Burgoyne) and P.
Eliel (Major Swindon) presented a
dramatic contrast of calm politness
and a somewhat juvenile firey temper.
The performance was decidely suc
cessful, maintaining a high standard
throughout. Perhaps we are not al
ways as appreciative as we might be
of amateur art.
The Stanford audience is inclined to
be a little captious and personal in
criticism, taking good qualities for
granted, and unconsciously applying
professional standards to players who
even as college veterans have been in
only half a dozen plays. With a little
thought, one might perceive excel
lences that are peculiar to the ama
teur.

The Stanford playgoer, who has
been attending performances at the
Assembly Hall for the last two or
three years, is inclined to take a good
deal for granted. Settling himself in
his seat, he opens the well-made little
program without a thought of its
typographical good form; the music of
the University orchestra strikes up,
and he raises his eyes, first tot ake in
the musicians with the incurious
glance of one satisfied, but not espec
ially clairaudient, then to let his un
offended gaze rest for a moment on the
tranquil dignity of the new curtain;
contented, he falls to perusing the
cast of characters.
"This ought to be a pretty good
show," he comments. "Here are Miss
Wilson and Miss Workman and Mr.
Woodville, three W's whom we know;
and two S's equally familiar, Mr.
Strong, and in the tite role, Mr. Sew
ard. These are all veterans." The
name of the yell-leader in the list
awakens expectations. But commenc
ing with the assumption that it ought
to be a good show anyhow, the play
goer is for the rest prepared to criti
cise everything pretty much as though
it were professional rather than ama
