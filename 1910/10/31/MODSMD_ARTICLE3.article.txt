# COMMUNICATION RECEIVED FROM COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN.
## Faculty Board Criticizes Stand of Daily Palo Alto in Reference to Press Censorship. 
### 
October 31, 1910.
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
in your issue of October 2Sth the
Daily Palo Alto deals with events
leading to the suspension of a stu
dent. You quote the Call article in
full, but neglect to state that, it is al
most wholly false or to deplore its
original publication.
In relation to the other story, you
omit to note that the "personal friend"
to whom the story was related was a
newspaper man. It may also be stated
that, the "recreant lover" referred to
was one of the three men, in the whole
history of the University, upon whom
has been visited the penalty of ex
pulsion. The efforts of the Committee
to handle a grave matter with becom
ing privacy are made the occasion of
misstatement, ridicule, and unfair
criticism.
Editorially, you deplore a censor
ship which, you conceive, causes a
"lamentable situation in a University
such as Stanford, striving as we are
at present for a closer relation be
tween the Faculty and Student Body.
Your one-sided representation of facts
and failure to condemn unworthy acts
may contribute something toward per
petuating this "lamentable situation."
In censoring falsehood, vulgarity, and
unfair criticism of University officials
and policies the Committee 011 Stu
dent Affairs is but carrying out Uni
versity instructions. It may possibly
be accused of laxness in this duty,
but the cooperation of all the members
of the University will make its task
easier, and this cooperation it has the
right to expect.
Very truly yours,
A. B. CLARK,
For the Committee on Student Affairs
