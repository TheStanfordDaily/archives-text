# PRESIDENT JORDAN SPEAKS ON INTERNATIONAL PEACE
## 
### 
"International Peace," the goal to
wards which man has struggled for
countless centuries, was the subject of
Doctor Jordan's address at the as
sembly this morning. Outlining the
progress of the idea of toleration
from its rude beginning up to its ex
pression in the basic principles of our
democracy, Dr. Jordan concluded with
a sketch of the modern situation of the
movement, and his personal experi
ences regarding the spread of the
propaganda.
"Our modern warfare," according to
the speaker, "is a survival of the per
iod when questions of personal justice
were decided by the ordeal. The God
of Battles is ever on the side which
has the strongest battalions."
The elements which are most, in
fluential in the prevention of the de
structive modern warfare are scien
tific, religious and those habits of
thought resulting from travel. The
work of the scientist has shown how
detrimental to the ultimate welfare of
a nation is the continual call for new
blood, and the consequent, draining
from the country of its most virile
stock. As a personal experience show
ing how such a nation as England
must pay for her immense territorial
possessions. Dr. Jordan told of visit
ing a little Anglican church in a di
munitive community, to see if even
there the toll of war had been paid.

He found in this community, consist
ing of but few persons, monuments
erected to three men who had died in
India in the service of England.
The tremendous cost of war and the
effect on the individuals not only of
the nations actually engaged in the
struggle, hut of all the nations of the
world, was demonstrated by the con
sideration of the enormous number of
persons withdrawn from productive
enterprise to act as soldiers.
The "Unseen Empire" and not the
nations actively engaged in a war are
the actual gainers by hostilities, ac
cording to President Jordan. By the
"unseen Empire" is meant that com
bination of financiers who control the
issuance of bonds of the European
nations and who now dominate and in
reality own the continent.
What probably up to the present
time, has been the most serious hand
dicap in the accomplishment of de
finite results in the movement, has
been the lack of funds. This has been
eliminated to a certain extent by the
recent donation of one million dollars
to the cause by a. Boston enthusiast.
This fund \s to be used under the sup
ervision of a board of trustees, of
which Doctor Jordan is a member.
Eventually, it was the speaker's
opinion, that, all International difficul
ties would be submitted to the great
Hague Tribunal for settlement.
