A communication has been re
ceived from the Faculty Committee
on Student Affairs by the Daily Palo
Alto, which we publish in full in this
issue. A misconception upon the part
of the Committee seems to have arisen
with reference to the position taken
and the conditions criticized by the
Daily Palo Alto. In a news story, we
publish in full the exact grounds and
causes for the suspension of a student
correspondent and every statement
made in that article is absolutely cor
rect in every essential. The city cor
respondents have personally desired
information from the Editor of the
Daily Palo Alto as to the nature of the
articles that will be censored by the
Student Affairs Committee and there
is no more efficient manner in which
such information can be placed before
them and the University public than
through the columns of the college
publication. The story of the "recreant
lover" was given to a San Francisco
resident as a "personal friend" not as
a newspaper man. The information
was not given for publication and the
story did not appear in the city news
papers for some time after the story
was told to this friend. We do not
criticize the action of the committee
with reference to the expulsion of
the "recreant lover," but on the con
trary, knowing the facts, we heartily
endorse their action. We still main
tain, however, that there is a press
censorship and that such restriction
extends to cases where the facts are
communicated to city editorial rooms
of a metropolitan newspaper by tele
phone and the story is there written
by one who is not a student. The
campus correspondent suffers the re
sult of a city reporter's work, because
the story happens to bear a University
date-line. We do not state that the
stories as appearing in the city news
papers meet with our approval, but
wo do maintain that we think it a
severe censorship of campus reporters
when one who telephones facts is sus
pended for such acts.
We also deplore a censorship of the
local publications which prohibits free

discussion of the topics of personal in
terest to the Student Body from the
viewpoint of the student. As lias been
stated by the Chairman of the Student
Affairs Committee to the Editor of the
Daily Palo Alto before a witness,
"The Daily Palo Alto has 110 right to
criticize the actions of the University
authorities." We do not uphold "false
hood, vulgarity and unfair criticism
of the University officials and policies
of the Committee on Student Affairs,"
but we do maintain that from the
standpoint of the Stanford Student
Body, which the Daily Palo Alto re
presents, this censorship is lament
able.
