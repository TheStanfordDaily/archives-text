# COURSE IN INTERNATIONAL PEACE TO BE GIVEN HERE.
## Doctor Jordan and Professor Krehbiel to Offer New Subject Next Semester.-Much Literature Obtained. 
### 
Announcement was made today of
the fact that a new course would be
offered to students of the University
next semester, under the auspices of
the History department. Dr. Jordan
and Professor Ivrehbiel of the History
department will present the course,
which will deal with International
Peace and Arbitration. No definite
name bad been given to the course so
far but it will deal with these subjects
as general topics.
Dr. Jordan, during bis recent trip to
Europe met and consulted with some
twenty-six out of thirty-two, of tlie
Continent's most noted supporters of
the peace movement. Through them
be collected a large amount of invalu
able literature which will be used in
the course. Part of this data in re
gard to the peace movement is still in
the hands of the printer and binder,
and the rest of it has not been received
from Europe. As soon as it has been
collected, properly arranged and sys
tematized, it will be placed for general
use in room 215 of the History build
ing. It is uncertain at this time
whether it will be ready for use this
semester or not. The course, however,
will be given next semester, and it is
certain that the literature will be
available at. that "time.
The plan of Dr. Jordan in regard to
the new course will necessitate both
he and Professor Krehbiel delivering
lectures during the entire semester.
Dr. Jordan intends to confine his lec
tures to the practical side of the work,
in which field he will bring to bear all
the material that he has gathered dur
ing his long association with the
greatest minds of the day, interested
in the movement. Professor Krehbiel.
on the other hand, will deliver his
lectures on the historical and statis
tical side of peace and arbitration. In
the first of these two groups he will
treat merely of the history of the
movement, while the statistical side
will deal with figures in regard to war
costs, debts, and the like.
The course will be one of the first
in any university in the country lo
deal with these all-important subjects,
and it should take its plare as a clas
sic with Dr. Jordan's other course in
Bionomics. No one in this country at
least is so eminently fitted to present
a course having for its subject Inter
national Peace and Arbitration.
