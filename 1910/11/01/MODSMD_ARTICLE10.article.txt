the University of Paris, and has had
considerable experience in teaching
hoth in this country and in France.
He comes to Stanford from the Uni
versity of Washington, Seattle, where
he held the position of graduate as
sistant in French. Though hearing
the same name, he is not related to
Professor A. 1.. Guerard, Assistant
Professor in the Department of Ro
manic Languages.
