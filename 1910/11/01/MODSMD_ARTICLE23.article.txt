# SAN FRANCISCO TEAM TAKES IN GYM FIFTEEN.
## Local Soccer Aggregation Defeated by Score of 5 to 2 in Game With Metropolitans. 
### 
In a game full of snap and vim
from the first whistle to the last, the
San Franciscos won from the Encina
Gymnasium Soccer team on Saturday
by a score of 5 to 2. Although clearly
outclassed by their opponents in pass
ing and dribbling, the local team put
up as good an exhibition of the Eng
lish game as could be expected.
During the first half, the San Fran
ciscos had a strong wind at their
back and aided by this, they kept the
ball almost continually In their op
ponent's territory. At half time they
had registered four goals to the En
cina's none.
Up to the last fifteen minutes of
play the Encina team had not suc
ceeded in scoring, when Pung rushing
the San Francisco's goal-keeper,
forced him to step back of his goal
posts for the throw-out which caused
the referee to award a goal. The score
now stood 4 to 1. Within the next five
minutes the local forwards had the
ball within shooting distance and Bel
las with a well directed kick slipped
it past the goal-keeper for the second
tally.
The line-up of the team is as follows:
Encina Gymnasium â€” Forwards,
Lyne, liiggins, Pung, and Williams;
halfs, Hamilton, Reynolds and Humph
reys; fulls, McCann and Clyde.
