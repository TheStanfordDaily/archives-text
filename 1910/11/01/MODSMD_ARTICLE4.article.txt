# CALIFORNIA WILL LINE UP WITH FOURTEEN VETERANS
## 
### 
The California Varsity at this time,
eleven days before the "big game," is
playing fourteen veterans in its line
up. For that reason alone, leaving out
all other considerations, the fifteen is
one that must be reckoned with on
every count, of which experience of
fourteen men in former Varsity bat
tles is the thing to be kept in mind
most. Peart, the meteoric wing, is the
only player who appears sure of mak
ing the team, who has not already en
graved the big "C" on his sweater.
The whole of the pack are men who
have been tried in the terrible strain
of an intercollegiate contest. There
are Jordan, Hardy and Pauly, the best
dribblers of which California can
boast. Jordan and Hardy played last
year; Pauly's last appearance was in
1908. There is Myron Harris, a queer
combination of speed, push and bril
liancy, who has been forcibly taken
out of his natural element in the back
field at center, and shifted into the
more sluggish going scrum, by Coach
Schaeffer. Harris is a consistent star
of the whole team. "Cap" Phleger, a
favorite with the bleachers, Markwart,
Ashley and the ever-busy Swartz are
the other four of the forward octette,
who are more or less of ordinary
make-up. Fairbanks is a scrum vet
eran who apparently does not come up
to standard this year. He, together
with Hansen and H. Phleger undoubt
edly will make substitutes of unusual
strength and experience. Morris is a
flv-about, but thoroughly dependant
hall'. There has been some talk of
putting Dwiggins in this, his old posi
tion, but this is hardly likely. Morris
is good there, and Dwiggins can do
better at full back, according to the
way the situation is working out in
Berkeley. As fives, Elliott and Stroud
are two men whom it will lie hard to
surpass. Elliott is a flash of lightning
in his running, and is also the chief
performer in another line on the team,
that of goal kicking. Stroud has had
a bad shoulder injury this week, and
has been kept off the field. It is
though that the man who has played
wing for two years, Watts, will be
placed in center. I la is, however, of
very mediocre ability, although his
power of fighting may overbalance this
fact. Peartt and Allen, who have
been playing the wing positions, are
two speedy men, hard to handle and
stop. They are small, and capable be
cause of their size to find holes in the
line and work their way through. Both
are strong in touch kicking. Dwig
gins at full back is not a genius. He
is somewhat of a wizard at putting the
right curve on the ball as it leaves his
foot, in order to get the most out of an
advance by touch finding. But he s;i
not infallible as a tackier. A swiftly
swerving runner is very likely to get
past him. since he has no very great
reach in leaping for a tackle.
The team as p. whole has one out
standing and enviable quality, that of
following the ball at every point of the
play. They do not lag behind. Jordan,
the biggest and fastest man on the
team, "bar none," ns Walter Christy
says, is most efficient of all in follow
ing up, despite his 230 pounds of avoir
dupois. And when he once gets the

ball in dribbling or carrying, his great
bulk is almost impossible to overcome.
He is a score getter, and in many
games puts the pigskin over single
handed. It is a sight to see him pass,
and he does it in an elephantine sort
of wayâ€”but it gets where he wants it
to go.
Harris, besides his other qualities,
has an additional one of being the man
who kicks off for the Blue and Gold.
He does his duty as the starter of the
half. Peartt and Dwiggins are
punters.
Coach Scahaeffer has been playing
about twenty men in the line-up in.
preliminary games, and there are sev
eral positions over which there is more
or less sharp competition. Dills is an
opponent of Peartt for one of the
wings-hips. Mini may prove too good
for Watts at center. Evans is a pos
sibility at half for Morris, though this
j change is hardly to be looked for.
The 3-2-3 of last year's Varsity
I match is being used exclusively by
i Schaeffer at present. But he has per
i haps, "something up his sleeve." He
can easily switch the formation of the
scrum, and put a very capable man in
as wing forward, with the seven-man
pack, this player being Swartz. The
2-3-2, or scrum with wing forward,
was used in the early weeks of the
season, but has not been utilized since
to any great extent.
California has a very hard game to
carry through as a final struggle be
fore the Stanford match, when Nevada
comes to Berkeley next Saturday. It
will be a game that will be worth
much to the team across the bay.
Stanford also, was to have played the
men from Reno this season, but ar
rangements could not be perfected,
j The past two games that California
I ha 3 played were with the Olympic
J Club. Last Saturday, the San Fran
ciscans were defeated, 18-0. A week
before they went under the Varsity
yoke, 40-10. The scores are interest
ing. The Olympics had their most
powerful team against California, and
i the game Saturday may reveal in some
sort the strength of the fifteen across
' the water. Stanford meets the Winged
j "O" team next, Saturday, as a final
j game.
California Enlarges Bleachers.
Manager Farmer has put under way
the building of a new stand on the
! north end of the field, toward the hills,
capable of holdidng 2900 people. He
has made two platforms along the en
tire length of each side of the field.
| with standing room for 2000 specta
; tors. The standing places are ar
! ranged in the form of tiers, so that
each tier will be a few inches above
the one in front of it. With these ad
ditions to the seating capacity of Cal
ifornia Field, approximately 20,000
j persons can be accommodated on Nov
ember 12, should there lie need. The
large covered portion of two sections
' of bleachers on each side of the field
| have been taken down, and the stands
present one solid open view, with no
shelter from the weather, as formerly.
The weight of the timbers necessary to
hold up this sheltered section weak
! ened the whole stand and had to be rc
-1 moved.
