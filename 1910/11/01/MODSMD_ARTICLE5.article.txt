# WILL HOLD HANDICAP TRACK MEET SATURDAY.
## Entries Must be Given to Captain Bellah Trainer Moulton by Wednesday. 
### 
Th first track meet of the year will
take place on the Stanford oval next
Saturday morning. All the men who
are doing fall training are expected to
enter. Any runners who have not as
yet signed up can participate if they
hand their names to Trainer Moulton
or Captain Hellah before Thursday.
No entries will he received alter this
date as it is to lie a handicap meet and
the men in charge must have time lo
make the proper arrangements. "Dad"
Moulton is particularly anxious that
all the Freshmen compete, bo that he
can get a good line on their ability.
Many of the track stars are 011 the
football squad and will not be able to
enter 011 Saturday, but with Coleman
in the sprints, Wyman and Taylor in
the middle distances and Neuman in
the two-mile, some good records
should be registered for this early in
the season.
In the field events, Argabrite and
Hellah have been showing tine form in
the jumps and some good work should
be seen. These veterans, however,
will have to extend themselves in
order to overcome the handicaps that
the nev; men will have.
The distances in all the races will
be shortened, as most of the men are
not in condition to stand a hard meet.
