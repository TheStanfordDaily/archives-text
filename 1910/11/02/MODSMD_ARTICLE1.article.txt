# PLAY LISTLESS RUGBY
## VARSITY AND THE SECOND TEAM BREAK EVEN. Veterans Given Lay-off. â€” Varsity in Short Practice on California Field this Afternoon. 
### 
The Varsity played a listless half
hour session of rugby with the second
team yesterday afternoon, during
which time each group of players tal
lied once. The game was a shifting
one around midfield between the for
wards. Neither scrum seemed to be
able to hook the pigskin out to their
backs, an occasional dribbling rush be
ing the nearest approach to an exhibi
tion of rugby. Once or twice the Var
sity had a juggling match with the
ball, but failed to get. a passing rush
started that, was a yard-gainer. The
one exception occurred when Cass en
gineered a successful dash by the
backs at the close of the game.
The first score was made, after fif
teen minutes of play, when the substi
tutes dribbled across, Hubbard falling
on the ball for a try. Berryman's at
tempt at. a conversion barely failing.
A few minutes later, Peck nearly
made a second try, being downed at
the Varsity's 2. The only approach to
the usual play was seen at the close of
the scrummage, when Cass secured the
ball at a 25 yard scrum and passed to
Harrigan, Geissler tearing across near
the side line.
Several of the Varsity stars were not
out last night, Coach Presley deeming
it best to give them a lay-off. Cheda
and Arrell, from the forwards, were on
the side lines. Mitchell was still out
of togs, due to a slight injury to his
foot, received in last Thursday's prac
tice line-up. Reeves replaced him at
second five. Brown played at full on
the second fifteen, so as to get an op
portunity to try his boot in defence,
Ellis played full for the Varsity.
The Varsity players left the campus
this morning for Berkeley, where they
held a short practice on California
Field during the afternoon to become
accustomed to playing on a dirt grid
iron. This will probably be their only
chance to trod the Blue and Gold field
until November 12, although Coach
Presley may take his aggregation
across the bay for another practice
next week. The Cardinal players re
turned to the campus in time for then
evening meal at 1 lie Inn.
H. .1. Smith, the speedy second team
back, sprained his wrist in Saturday's
hard fought contest with the Southern
er's and will be out of togs until the
end of the week.
