# MANY HOOTER TICKETS STILL REMAIN UNCLAIMED.
## Present Sale Indicates Small Hooting Section on Day of the Big Game. 
### 
After reserving over one thousand
seats for the use of the Stanford root
ing section at the Intercollegiate game,
the management is confronted with
the fact that only some seven hundred
of these seats have as yet been sold.
One section and a halt' of the choicest
seats on California Field were set
aside for the Cardinal division, but
from present indications scarcely a
full section will be utilized.
In view of the slow disposal of these
tickets, Graduate Manager Burbank
lias given up most of the seats in the
additional halt section, reserving
merely a strip of seven seats adjoining
the regular section. Many choice
seats can still be obtained, as no sales
have been made in the extra strip,
while in the lull section there are
quite a few seats still remaining.
At the last Varsity game Stanford
had a rooting section numbering over
1100 persons. Yell leader Thompson
estimates from the present conditions
that not more than 750 people will
journey to Berkeley to support the
Stanford team in one of the hardest
lights a Cardinal Varsity team has
been called upon to face in years.
The seats are still on sale at the
Bookstore. Unless more sales are
made within the next few days, it is
probable that even the strip of seven
seats will be relinquished and the
Stanford delegation confined to one
section.
