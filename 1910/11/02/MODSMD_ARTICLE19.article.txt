# DR. JORDAN LECTURES TO THE COSMOPOLITAN CLUB.
## Interesting Description of Life of Robert. Louis Stevenson in Samoa Given Last Night. 
### 
An audience which filled the chapel
listened to the intensely interesting
lecture by Dr. Jordan before the Cos
mopolitan Club last evening. The ad
dress was in reality a description of
the life of Robert Louis Stevenson, and
the Samoan Islands, where he spent
his latter years. After outlining Stev
enson's days in California, spent in
poverty and sickness, Dr. Jordan told
of his removal to these islands, which,
of all places in the world, deserve the
terra "enchanted." The rugged moun
tains, extinct volcanoes, and coral
reefs among which dart brilliantly col
ored fishes, all help to justify the de
scription according to Dr. Jordan. On
one of this group of islands, which are
scattered like little asteroids, remote
from the life of the continent, Steven
son settled.
In describing the quaint customs of
the natives, Dr. Jordan said, "When
an honored guest is presented to the
king, he receives a 'kava-name.' Stev
enson was dubbed 'Tusitala,' 'The
Man Who Talks Lengthwise.' It is my
proudest boast to this day that I also
have a 'kava-name.' It is 'Tallanca e
Fiva,' 'The Man Who Tells Fish
Stories.' " The lecturer then sketched
the declining years of Stevenson and
the love with which he was regarded
by the natives, who built a road, the
"Way of Loving Kindness," to his
home.
A number of excellent stereoptican
slides were then shown, from photo
graphs taken by Dr. Jordan and Pro
fessor V. L. Kellog during their ex
pedition to the islands.
