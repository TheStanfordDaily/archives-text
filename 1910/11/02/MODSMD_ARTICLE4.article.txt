# DOUGLASS DEFEATS MURRAY IN HANDICAP TOURNAMENT.
## The 						former Proves Too Steady in Final Match and Wins in Straight Sets. 
### 
F. M. Douglass, '13, defeated R. L.
Murray, '13, in three straight sets in
the final round of the handicap tennis
tournament yesterday afternoon. The
scores of the sets were 6-3, 6-2, 6-1.
The play was much closer than the
score indicates, and almost every game
went to duce. Douglass had a slight
advantage in playing from — % 15 as
against Murray's — 15, but steadiness
was the chief factor in his victory.
Douglass' driving was remarkable,
and he received well from the back
court, but his work at the net was not
up to his usual standard. Murray's
serving was the better but his oppon
ent proved superior in the other de
partments of the game. By winning
this match Douglass receives the Ward
and Wright racket which the Stanford
Bookstore generously offered to the
winner of the tournament.
Tennis enthusiasts will have another
chance to see this speedy pair in ac
tion this week, when they play for the
Sophomore championship. The victor
in this second contest will represent
1913 in the interclass matches.
