# ROOTERS' HATS FOR BIG GAME GO ON SALE TOMORROW.
## Price Has Been Set at Forty Cents, Which is Lower than Any Previous Year. 
### 
Rooters' hats, which must be worn
by all occupying rooter's seats at the
intercollegiate game, will be placed on
sale on the inner quad by the Law
buildings tomorrow morning, between
10:15 and 11:15. The Regent in Palo
Alto will handle the hats and is the
agency through which they were se
cured. The price will be forty cents
this year, while heretofore sixty cents
lias been the least for which they have
ever been sold. The great reduction
this year is due to the fact that the
hats will be sold exactly at cost.
Every student holding a rooter's
ticket must not neglect to provide him
self with one of the hats, as otherwise
admission to that part of the bleachers
will lie denied him. Last year's hats
may be worn this season, but those of
two years ago are out of date and will
not lie allowed upon the bleachers this
year.
