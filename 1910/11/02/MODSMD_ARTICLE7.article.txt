### 
An explanation of the nature of the
coming Plug-Ugly and of the rules and
regulations for it as drawn up by the
Student Advisory Committee, was
given to the Seniors at their meeting
this afternoon by Student Advisor

which he gave to the Junior Class yes
terday except that special emphasis
was placed upon the responsibility of
1911 for the perpetuation of the Plug
Ugly tradition as a whole. In this
connection, he spoke of the responsi
bility which the Universtiy Conference
took upon itself for the continuance of
the custom and stated that If the Plug-
Ugly was not of the character of the
one planned by it, that future classes
would undoubtedly be deprived of the
annual burlesque and rush.
The rules as drawn up by the Stu
dent Advisory Committee and as re
ported by Roth in substance are as
follows: (1) That there shall be no
poster fight, (2) That there shall lie
no set rush off or on the Quad, (3)

ceed without, interference.

in specific form and a committee of
three was authorized to meet with a
