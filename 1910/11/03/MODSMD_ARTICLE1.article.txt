# ADVISORY COMMITTEE MAKES STATEMENT ABOUT ARTICLES.
## Students Deprecate Recent Sensational Newspaper Articles.â€”No Truth in Reported Investigation. 
### 
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
The Student Advisory Committee in
expression of the sentiments of the
Student Body deprecates the recent
publication of an article by a special
correspondent of a San Francisco
paper relating to the conduct of the
Stanford football teams at Reno and
Santa Clara. This article has made
certain misrepresentations as to ex
isting conditions and has little founda
tion on facts.
The conduct of the team at Reno
gave no grounds for the preferment of
any charges of drunkeness and ac
cording to the faculty committee they
have never considered instituting an
investigation. With respect to the al
leged charges against the second team
at Santa Clara, it may be stated that
after an investigation no facts were
found warranting action by the faculty
committee.
We deplore any attempt to create
the impression that there is any ser
ious trouble between the faculty and
the football squad. The only intense
feeling which exists among the stu
dents is directed against the publica
tion of such misleading statements.
Student Advisory Committee.
