Stanford and local conditions upon
the campus have been woefully mis
represented by a San Francisco news
paper during the past two days. To
the outside world and to the general
public an absolutely erroneous situa
tion of affairs is represented, while
various rumors and unfounded re
ports have been distorted until a dif
ferent meaning and an untrue condi
tion is created. In the first instance,
110 decided division has occurred be
tween the students and a Faculty
Committee, nor has any split between
any two factions been brought about
by drastic action upon the part of the
latter body. Furthermore no investi
gation was ever instituted by the Stu
dent Affairs Committee regarding the
conduct of the Varsity fifteen during
their visit at Reno. Their conduct was
above reproach and the Faculty Com
mittee regrets that even inference of
such inquiry should be made. A natu
ral inference arises in the minds of
those who are unacquainted with local
conditions and of those who have not
a knowledge of the high standard that
is maintained at Stanford, that the
campus is a community seething with
sedition and discontent. This is abso
lutely untrue. No such evident or
apparent discontent is or has been
manifest throughout the entire semes
ter. The attention of the Student
Body supported by a loyal Faculty is
now with the intercollegiate game and
is supporting a winning team.
This misrepresentation of facts can
not but affect Stanford as a university
and no person 01* group of persons is
more seriously injured than the stu
dents themselves, as a body compris
ing the University. A false applica
tion of erroneous charges have been
too often given to Stanford men when

those accusations had absolutely no'
foundations. We are heartily opposed
to such articles that erroneously infer
a situation that does not exist and es
tablishes a belief that certain condi
tions are prevalent. The Student
Body has it within their power to cor
rect to some extent at least these mis
representations.
