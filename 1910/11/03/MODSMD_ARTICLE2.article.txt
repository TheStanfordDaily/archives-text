# SENIOR TO SING AT LAKE LAGUNITA TOMORROW NIGHT.
## Encina Men Will Leave Hall at 7 and Will Join Row Seniors at Postoffice. 
### 
Following the custom inaugurated
several years ago, Senior singing will
be held on the banks of Lake Lagunita
tomorrow evening. This will be the
first gathering of 1911 men for Senior
singing and in order that it may be -i
success it is hoped that all men of the
class will attend in a body. The Hall
men will leave Encina at 7 o'clock
and will join the men of the Flow at
the Postoffice whence all will go to
the lake. Those having musical in
struments are requested to bring
them. Graduates and holdovers are
also invited to be present.
Senior singing will be held regu
larly from now until the end of the
college year. This year the intention
is to make these occasions more in the
nature of jolly-ups than heretofore.
In this way it is hoped to bring the
Seniors closer together and establish a
closer bond of friendship amongst the
members of the class than exists at
the present time.
Many Senior men have failed to not
ify G. A. Ditz or Iv. L. Dole whether or
not they will be able to attend the
luncheon at Senior Hall on the Berke
ley campus on the day of the Varsity
game. All who have failed to do so
are asked to let either of these men
know at once, so that the list may be
sent to California.
