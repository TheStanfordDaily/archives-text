# SMOKING IS PROHIBITED IN CLUB ROOM AT ENCINA HALL.
## Former Rule Concerning Use of Tobacco in Dormitory is Again Put in Force. 
### 
The old rule prohibiting smoking in
the corridors and club room at Encina
Hall has again been put into effect.
A sign was posted on the bulletin
board this morning stating that no
smoking would be permitted in the
building, but it is an understood fact
that this does not concern the use of
tobacco in the rooms.
The original rule has never been
revoked, but has for some time stood
as a dead letter. The purpose of the
rule is not known and it is anticipated
that a formal petition will be sub
mitted to the Board of Trustees at
their next meeting in hope of having
the rule stricken out altogether.
For the present, however, the. rule
will be enforced and the use of tobac
co in the passages, corridors and club
rooms of the dormitory is tabooed.
