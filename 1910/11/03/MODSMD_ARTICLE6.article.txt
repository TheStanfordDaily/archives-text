# CAPTAIN BELLAH'S FIFTEEN DEFEATS PACIFIC VARSITY.
## 
### 
Fifteen Stanford rugby exponents
under the captaincy of S. 11. Isella.li,
'11, defeated the University of the
Pacific Varsity yesterday afternoon on
Pacific Field by the score of 6-0. The
two teams were evenly matched and
the game was closely contested
throughout.
The Stanford players secured an un
converted try in each period. The
second try was made after a sensa
tional forty yard dash by Captain Bel
lah, who secured the elusive leather
oval at the Methodist's 40 and outran
Coach Crawford's players for a tally.
The remainder of the game saw the
Pacific fifteen encamped near the
Stanford line, but their assaults were
unavailing against the Cardinal stone
wall.
