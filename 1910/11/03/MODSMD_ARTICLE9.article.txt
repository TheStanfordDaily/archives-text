# STANFORD BAND WILL BE HEARD IN CONCERT SUNDAY.
## Will Render Excellent Program on Inner Quad.—J.E. Thompson, '11 Will Direct Singing. 
### 
A new departure in musical circles
at Stanford will be tried next Sunday
afternoon, when the Stanford Band
will be heard in concert in the Inner
Quadrangle. In past years the field of
the band has been limited almost ex
clusively to the bleachers, but their
successful showing this year has given
rise to much favorable comment and
their appearance in concert Sunday
conies as a result of repeated requests
from both faculty and students.
Among other numbers on the pro
gram the three prize songs chosen this
year will be heard. The singing will
be held under the direction of J. E.
Thompson, '11. The pieces have been
chosen by Director T. K. Stark, '11,
and Professor E .C. Martin. An ex
cellent program is assured. "Hail,
Stanford Hail" will be sung with the
band as the concluding number.
