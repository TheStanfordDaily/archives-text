Dear Sir:
Tho good government forces in California, whether
republican or democratic still need Marshall Black in the Senate
of California, In my opinion, tho 38th Senatorial district haß
no man that can fill his place at this timo. I will tell you
why. He began with a small coterie of Senators and Assemblymen
to work for clean measures and clean methods. He was in the
minority then. The minority has grown until it has become the
m«?,jority, and in control cf the Senate. Marshall Black's
influence is great with these men with whom he has been making
a fight, for independence of thought and action; in fact, he is
one of the advisers of the Senate. A new man, however able,
would have to win his spurs. If the twenty-eighth district
expects results from its Senator, it should net make a change
now when Marshall Black is in a position to secure for his dis
trict better treatment than has ever yet been accorded to it.
My advise to the voters of Santa Clara County is to return to
the Senate a man in whom those in control of the Senate have
full confidence, and to whom they go for advice ana counsel.
Yours truly,
senator from the First District comprising
Humboldt, Del Norte, Trinity and Tehama
Counties.
