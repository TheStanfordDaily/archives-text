# PRACTICE YESTERDAY WAS LIVELY; VARSITY WINNING.
## Gray-jerseyed Men Followed Ball With No Stops, Making Approximate Score of 30-0. 
### 
The Varsity, minus Mitchell and
Sundell as regulars, and with Brown
playing fullback on the opponents'
side, defeated, by never letting up in
fight grit, the second team by the ap
proximate score of 30-0. Improve
ment could be seen all over the team,
and the way in which the whole fif
teen to a man followed the ball
brought joy to the thousand or more
occupants of the bleachers. The first
line-up of the Varsity secured two
tries in about ten minutes play. Geis
sler, on a pass from Cheda from
Frank, went over first. Cheda, re
ceiving from Olmstead, scored the.
second try. Coach Presley then ma
terially changed the two fifteens with
a half dozen or so substitutes each.
This revised Varsity scored over
twenty points, although not all the
tries were given chances of conver
sion. Five tries in this second period
were made by Horton, Baumgartner,
Minturn, Cass and Harrigan. There
was no listlessness apparent yesterday
and the second team men were as
eager for the fray as were the Var
sity. Brown in defending from the
grey-jerseyed team was hard pressed
many times, and received much valu
able practice. Arrell was back on the
field in his suit, after being out of
play for several days.
Attendance at practice games was
perhaps broken yesterday. There were
over one thousand persons there, since
only four or five rows of the men s
section lacked filling, while the wo
men students were also in evidence,
and had almost a half section filled.
