# STANFORD IS DECLARED CONFERENCE MEET WINNER
## 
### 
Stanford was declared the winner of
the Conference Meet held at Urbana
on June 4, by the Conference Associa
tion yesterday, when they disqualified
Dimmick and Philbrook of Notre
Dame.
By the repudiation of the standing
of Notre Dame's two stars, fourteen
points are taken from her tally of 29,
leaving them but 15 to Stanford's 17
points.
Philbrook and Dimmick competed
under the protest of California at the
meet, as these two men had competed
two years at Whitman College in
Washington and at a previous con
ference meet. California's protest was
based upon the fact that they consid
ered the standing of Whitman College
in athletics high enough to come up to
the conference level, while Notre
Dame maintained that the athletic
standard of the Washington college
was not high enough to disqualify
them. The committee upheld Califor
nia's protest and -Notre Dame's 29
points, was brought to 15 by the de
duction of the fourteen points won by
their two stars.
The Conference Association is now
in session to arrange the crediting of
the shifting points. Through the dis
qualifying of Notre Dame, Illinois will
receive two more points in the shot

put, placing them ahead of Chicago
and tying Notre Dame for second
place. Minnesota, South Dakota,
Western Reserve and lowa also
will have their totals slightly
increased.
The official announcement of the
order of finish of the teams will be
delayed until the committee receives
the complete report of the scores in
order to ascertain who finished fourth
in the shotput, hammer throw, discus
throw and high jump. The fourth
place men in these events will be
advanced to third, each receiving a
point, as the two disqualified stars
placed in each of these four contests.
In the event of Illinois being awarded
the fourth place in these events, the
Champaign men would tie for first
place with the Cardinal athletes, but
there seems to be little possibility of
this happening.
Philbrook and Dimmick gave the
conference authorities a true accoun 112
of their athletic career and their elig
ibility simply hung upon the athletic
standing of Whitman College. The
disqualification was only ascertained
after a long investigation by Professor
Waldo, the conference arbitrator, who
found that the standing of the Wash
ington college warranted the disquali
fication of these men.
