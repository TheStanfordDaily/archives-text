# VARSITY WILL LINE UP AGAINST OLYMPIC CLUB
## 
### 
Few changes have been made in the
Varsity line-up as it will go against
the Olympic Club tomorrow afternoon
on Stanford Field in the last scheduled
game before the California contest.
The second team will meet St. Mary's
as the first game of the afternoon at
2:30.
Olmstead goes in for Smith at side
rank in the Varsity pack, as the only
change. Reeves is playing for Mitch
ell at second five, and his work in
pracctice shows him to be strong,
there. Mitchell is not yet ready to
take his place among his teammates.
With the return of Sundell to his place
at. wing forward the scrum is intact.
Thoburn has the center three-quarter
position. The fifteen is practically the
same one that performed so well in
practice yesterday afternoon, and the
team is capable of playing tomorrow
Stanford Varsity has not as yet had
the experience of having its goal line

as powerful a game as lias been seen
this fall.
The Olympic Club, if they bring here
their strongest group of men, and
there is nothing to indicate that they
will not, will also be able to make as
thorough a fight as they have shown
in any previous game. The team can
give the Cardinals a contest that will
be all that could be desired as the
final preparation for the struggle with
the Blue and Gold, and it will be a
stiff one. They hajd the California
Varsity last Saturday to an 18-0 score,
and forced the Varsity men to bring
out nearly their full strength. Two
weeks ago the same teams met, and
the Winged "O" players went down to
defeat, 40-10, this being one of the
fust, games in which a visiting team
has scored on the Blue and Gold. The
crossed by an opposing team.
C. L. Redding will referee the game
