# "TOO MUCH JOHNSON" CHOSEN FOR 1910 FOOTBALL SHOW
## 
### 
"Too Much Johnson," the imperish
able laugh provoker by William Gil
lett, which will be played next week
at the Alcazar theatre in San Francis
co, is the play chosen by the Gradu
ate Manager for Stanford's 11) 10 Foot
ball Show. The play itself needs no
introduction, having had a most suc
cessful run of four weeks in the old
Alcazar on its last appearance on the
coast a few years ago.
The scene of the play is laid first on
board an ocean liner and later on a
large, tropical sugar plantation in
Cuba. The plot concerns the en
tangled affairs of a young American

with a jealous Frenchman and his
wife. The unfortunate fellow, in de
spair, flees to Cuba under the assumed
name of Johnson, presenting himself
to those on board the steamer as the
owner of a sugar plantation there.
His affairs become even more involved
when on the island he finds that the
plantation he had claimed, was really
owned by a slave-driving individual
named Johnson.
Thurston Hall will be seen in the
role of Augustus Billings, the young
American, and Grace Barbour will
sustain the part of his trusting wife.
