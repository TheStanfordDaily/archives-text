owner of a sugar plantation there.
His affairs become even more involved
when on the island he finds that the
plantation he had claimed, was really
owned by a slave-driving individual
named Johnson.
Thurston Hall will be seen in the
role of Augustus Billings, the young
American, and Grace Barbour will
sustain the part of his trusting wife.
An excellent cast will support them.

out for publication.
