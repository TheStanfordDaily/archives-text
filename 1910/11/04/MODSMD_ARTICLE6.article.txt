# MANY NEW DEPARTURES IN PLUG UGLY TOMORROW
## Juniors Will be Allowed to Distribute Posters and Produce Farce Unmolested. 
### 
Not until the posters appear tomor
row morning will the title of the 1912
Plug-Ugly be known, but under what
ever name the burlesque guises itself,
the campus will have an opportunity
to see it upon the Stanford track oval
tomorrow evening at eight o'clock.
The posters will announce the place
for the display of third year talent
upon the baseball field, but that is not
to be noticed for the big display card
has been expurgated so many times,
that the Junior committee forgot to
make this change along with numer
ous others.
Directly after the burlesque, the
rivals will go in a body to the Quad
and there, instead of the usual rush,
a plug christening will take place. It
will be in the nature of a Junior ser
pentine around the Inner Quadrangle
with the Seniors doing their part in
smashing the third-year millinery on
the line of march. No set rush will
take place anywhere and after one
circuit, the fight will be declared off
and the event will end in "Hail Stan
ford, Hail."
The definite and final rules govern
ing the entire affair were drawn up
today by the Student Advisory Com
mittee and were signed by the commit
tee representing the two classes con
cerned. The Advisory Committee also
requests that all underclassmen take
no part in the rush or interfere with
the success of the occasion in any
way. The rules are as follows:
(1) The Juniors shall be allowed to
place their poster upon the campus
without any interference whatsoever
by the seniors.
(2) There shall be no roughhousing
of the show. The Juniors shall be al
lowed to produce the burlesque with
out such continued interruption as
will make it impossible for the audi
ence to hear the lines. Any act which
tends to make the production of the
show impossible, such as stealing
scenery and kidnapping members of
the cast is considered objectionable.
(3) The Plug-Ugly Rush shall be in
the nature of a serpentine around the
Quad bv the Juniors with the custom
ary "plug smashing" by the Seniors.
The object of the rurh shall be, as it
was in the original Plug-Ugly, to
christen the plugs and not to carry on
a set rush between two classes. The
Juniors may enter the Quad at any
point and their approach upon the
Quad shall be unopposed by the Sen
iors. The rush shall end when the
Juniors have circled the Quad.
