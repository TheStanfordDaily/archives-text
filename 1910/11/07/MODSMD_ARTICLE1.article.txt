# BELLAH AND ARGABRITE ARE STARS OF TRACK MEET.
## Good Records Made in Annual Handicap Field Meet Saturday Morning. 
### 
Captain S. 11. Bellah, '10, and W. M.
Argabrite, '13, were the star perform
ers in the handicap track and field
meet on the Stanford oval Saturday
morning. In the pole-vault, Bellah
cleared 12 feet and this with an in
jured leg which he recently hurt in
football. He did not win this event,
however, as Waring, who vaulted 11
feet 2 inches, had ;i one-foot handicap.
Bellah also won the broad jump with
a leap of 21 feet 3 inches.
Argabrite showed up in splendid
form in the high jump and cleared the
bar at 6 feet, m inches. Like Bellah,
he did not win the event on account of
handicaps. Argabrite has changed
his style of jumping since last year
and this was the lirst meet in which
he has tried the new form, lie has
discarded the old scissors fashion and
will hereafter make a straight take-off.
The marks of both Bellah and Arga
brite surpass anything that has been
done in the United States by collegi
ate athletes this fall.
The meet on the whole was very
successful and, considering the season,
good records were made in most of
the events. But few Freshmen entered
the meet and but little idea could be
obtained of the new material. Dawson
gives promise of developing into a fast
sprinter and Clark is a good hurdler.
\V. R. Finney, '12, furnished the sur
prise of the meet by taking first place
in the high jump. Although not ac
tually outjumping Argabrite, he clear
ed 5 feet, 10-J4 inches and his handicap
put him ahead.
