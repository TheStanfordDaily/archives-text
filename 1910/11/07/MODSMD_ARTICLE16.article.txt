# MORGAN DEFEATS MANN IN INTERCLASS TENNIS MATCH
## 
### 
By defeating H. Mann, '10, the 1911
class champion, in the semi-final round
of the inter-class tenuis tournament,
11. S. Morgan, '12, reached the final
round and will contest with the winner
of the underclass match for the cham
pionship of the University. Morgan
defeated Mann easily in two straight
sets Saturday. The latter was some
what out of form, but it is doubtful if
he could have beaten Morgan if he had
been at his best, for the Junior star
never played better than he did Sat
urday. In the play for the 1912
championship Morgan was pitted
against Grace and it took him three
hard sets to dispose of his fast oppon
ent.
One of the prettiest matches of the
tournament was that between Doug
lass and Murray for the sophomore
championship. These two have been
playing a very equal game all year and
have met in the finals of every tourna
ment up to date. Douglass proved
too strong for Murray Saturday and
won the second and third sets after
his opponent had captured the first.
In the final match of the 1914 tour
nament Dawson defeated Cawston and
by virtue of his victory he will play
Douglass for the right to compete

with Morgan in the championship
round.
Both of these matches should be of
great interest to the tennis enthusiasts
for all three men rank with the best
in the state and are the foremost play
ers that have been at Stanford in sev
eral years. Morgan is the present
champion of the University but he will
have to extend himself to hold his
title against his speedy rivals. Doug
lass only last week won the handicap
tournament and Dawson is one of the
holders of the State doubles champion
ship. These two will play Wednesday
afternoon and the winner will go up
against Morgan Thursday.
The doubles tournament will be
started next Monday. All entries are
asked to give their names to either
11. S. Morgan, Phi Delta Theta house
or to H. L. Loud, room 12S Encina. The
entrance fee is $1 a team.
