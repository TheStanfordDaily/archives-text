# KERN INJURED AND IS LOST TO CARDINAL VARSITY
## Brilliant Wing Crashes into Olympic Player and Breaks His Leg.— Stanford Defeats Winged.0.27-0. 
### 
The loss of Eugene Kern to the 1910
Cardinal l'ootball team by a serious
injury overshadowed every other event
in the Varsity-Olympic Club contest o.i
Stanford Field last Saturday after
noon. The two wings, Kern and
Sharpe, with the latter defending from
a run by Kern, ran full into each other,
and the shin-bone of the Stanford
player was broken.
Kern was one of several of the
most promising regulars of the Varsity
team. Although he has never secured
the big "S", yet in this one season he
has come to be a factor as a wing
three-quarters among both fellow
players and bleachers. As a wing, he
has borne to be looked upon as nearly
equal to the fast Holman of several
Varsity teams. Last year he played on
the Freshman fifteen winning from
California, and was also chosen as a
substitute for wing in the bigger strug
gle of last November. He was a mem
ber of the All-America rugby squad
that played in Australia last summer,
and made a reputation for himself on
that trip. Kern will probably be
forced to remain in the hospital, to
which he was carried in an automo
bile immediately after the injury, for
several days, at least and is wholly
lost to the California game.
In this last battle before the cham
pionship contest the Varsity defeated
the Olympics, 27-0, in two forty min
ute halves. On account of darkness,
the second period had to be cut to
thirty-five minutes. The game was as
hard a one to bring out the Cardinal
team's ability as could be desired. A
fair amount of defensive practice was
gained by reason of the brilliant of
fensive work of Sharpe, Miller, and
MacKenzie. The goal line was threat
ened two or three times, but in each
case the Stanford defence and capa
city to retrieve saved the day. Coach
Presley used the first game of the
afternoon, the second team-St. Mary'a
contest which was won by the Stan
ford players, 8-5, as a means of giving
every player a final looking over, and
also entered several substitutes into
the bigger Varsity game for a last
trial. Kern's hurt will undoubtedly
cause much readjustment. Thoburn
was tried in the injured man's posi
tion and after becoming a little accus
tomed to the newness of his place,
which he has never played before, he
was able to do his duty in a fair way.
Whether he will be kept there or not
the next few practice days will tell.
When S. Mitchell was withdrawn from
the line-up in the middle of the second
half, Sanborn went in for him, Reeves
being in at center for the whole sev
' enty-five minutes.
Brown's drop-kicking of a field go:il
from the 35-yard line on a penalty was
the feature of the first half, and'was a

happening which had been awaited
with interest for some time. Brown,
with the Olympics charging him,
placed the ball cleanly between the
posts without the slightest sign of
nervousness, although the kicking re
quired that not a second's time be lost.
This was the second score of the game.
Sundell tallied the first try easily
through the loose, and Dole converted
with equal ease. Geissler made the
total of the first half eleven points,
after receiving from Erb on the 25-
yard line, u try which was not con
verted.
In the second half tries were scored,
when Minturn secured from a general
mix-up on the Olympic 5 and drove
across, Dole not converting; by Geis
sler when Sundell passed to him at the
25 line, Geissler kicking a fairly diffi
cult goal; by Reeves who shot over the
line after a neatly executed run from
the Olympic's 30, (leissler converting
easily; and as a last score, when Tho
burn and Sanborn put through a splen
did passing bout from about the 25,
Sanborn putting the pigskin over.
Geissler did not negotiate the acute
angled kick for conversion.
The St. Mary's team tallied their
only try and conversion against the
second team in the first half, after
Ellis and H. Smith had put the ball
over for the Cardinal's first score, with
a conversion by Berryman. Starrest,
marked up for St. Mary's and Diavala
converted. At the very beginning of
the second period A. Sanborn gave
his team- the winning three points by
securing and diving across. Final
score, 8-5.
Roth refereed the second team con
test, and Faulkner, '09, acted in the
Varsity match. H. Hubbard, sprained
an ankle in the St. Mary's game.
