# PLUG UGLY UNDER NEW RULES MEETS WITH FAVOR
## 1912 Production Given Before Big Crowd.â€”Fight on Quad Proves Disappointing. 
### 
The wisdom of the new rules of the
University Conference drawn up with,
the express purpose of bringing the
Plug Ugly tradition back to its origi
nal slatus was proven by the general
success of the Plug Ugly as taken part
in by the two upper classes Saturday
evening. With the possible exception
of the fight around the Quad, every
thing was run off according to sched
ule and met with popular favor. The
Quad fight was of very short duration,
ihe Seniors having great difficulty in
christening the plugs of the fleeting
Juniors whose one purpose in life at
the time seemed to be in making a
hasty circuit of the Inner Quad.
But of all these numerous innova
tions the most surprising perhaps
were those furnished by the Senior
Class. Early risers anxious to see
whether they had "made" the poster
were surprised to have their gaze as
sailed by two placards neatly posted
side by side. Closer examination
proved that the Seniors not entirely
subdued by the new rules, had also is
sued a poster in which the Juniors
figured quite as prominently as did
Seniors in the official placard of the
day.
"Smearing the Smeared" was clever
both in plot and action. As 1911, ac
cording to agreement, did not interrupt
the rendition of the lines, most of the
hits got over the footlights of the im
provised stage. The scene of the trav
esty was laid at the Law Steps. An
audience of over 1500 witnessed the
production from the east side of the
bleachers. The receipts amounted to
$250.
Immediately after the curtain, the
big crowd broke up and adjourned to
the Inner Quadrangle to witness the
rush. The Seniors gathering in front
of the Law Buildings, formed a long
line and awaited the coming of their
rivals. The Juniors were thus forced
to run the gauntlet, but the fight which
the onlookers expected was disappoint
ing owing to the hurry of the third
year men in encircling the Quad.
