The Stanford upperclassmen, through
an exhibition of a proper attitude to
ward local customs, have conducted a
Plug-Ugly that insures its retention in
the future as one of Stanford's most
original and unique traditions. The
final outcome is gratifying inasmuch
as no objection con be taken by any of
those in authority with reference to
the character of the entire proceed
ings. The plan of allowing the Juniors
to present an original farce without
interference from the Seniors was a
decided success. The mere fact that a
farce of this nature was permitted to
be given without an accompaniment of
vegetables will be as great an encour
agement in the retention and the ex
pansion of the custom than any of tho
rules adopted. The ability exhibited in
the manuscripts submitted to the Jun
ior Committee proves that with
stronger competition and a certain
knowledge that the lines of the farce
would be heard, still more successful
results would be obtainable exclusively
from local talent, it, is to be hoped
that the coming Senior Class will fol
low out the same plan.
Objection can be taken, however, to
the manner in which the plug smash
ing contest was conducted upon the
Quad. The tradition may still be re
tained and an improvement made upon
the foot-race that took place Saturday
evening. When the coming Junior
Class prepare for their annual en
counter next year, provision should be
made to prevent a recurrence of this
feature.
