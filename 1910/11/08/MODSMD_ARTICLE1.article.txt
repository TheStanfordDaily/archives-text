# 1910 PLANS FESTIVITIES PRECEDING VARSITY GAME.
## Banquet to be Held by Graduates in an Effort to Strengthen College Ties. 
### 
Preparations for the banquet of the
men of the class of 1910 in San Fran
cisco are about completed.
The men will dine at the Heidel
berg Inn on the evening before the
game, November 11, and the affair
will begin at 6:30 p.m. Every effort
will be made to make it a reunion in
the truest sense.
Although there has been nothing
formal prepared, a program is being
arranged in which several of the men
of the class who were active in under
graduate affairs will talk briefly upon
different subjects.
J. D. Houser, the permanent secre
tary, is desirous of having all the
men of the class make their reserva
tions immediately for the affair as it
is absolutely necessary that the num
ber who will attend be known at once.
Owing to the difficulty of compiling an
accurate list of all the men at this
time, it is probable that many who in
tend to be at the game have not re
ceived notices concerning the banquet,
and all such should communicate
with Houser at once. Any men of the
class who know of other 1910 men who
are to attend the game should inform
them of the banquet at once so that
they may make their reservations.
Plans will be made so that any 1910
men who happen to be in the city that
night and have not known of the ban
quet before may be accommodated at
the last moment.
