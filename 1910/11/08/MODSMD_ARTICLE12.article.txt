The Daily Palo has again printed
the two songs that were successful in
securing prizes during the contest re
cently held. We publish these verses
for the sole purpose of allowing all
who have not yet memorized the lines
an opportunity to effectively learn
them. What Stanford lacks in num
bers she must make up in individual
efficiency and it is the duty of every
man in the Student Body to secure a
copy of these songs either from the
Daily Palo Alto or from the songs
books that have been recently issued
and to learn the words. We go to
Berkeley Saturday for the purpose of
winning from our intercollegiate
rivals and we must be able to do our
part wherever we may be situated on
the field.
