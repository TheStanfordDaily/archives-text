# Will Set Kern's Leg Thursday.
## 
### 
The doctors will not be able to set
the fracture of E. Kern's leg until
Thursday at least, owing to an un
usually long continued swelling. It
is thought that it will be set before
Saturday, and that he can be out of
the Guild Hospital by that time. No
trouble is anticipated however, in the
setting of the bone.
