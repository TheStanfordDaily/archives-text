# DR. BROUGHER PREACHES ON THE WISDOM OF SOLOMON.
## Los Angeles Minister Addresses a Large Audience at Sunday Morning Chapel Service. 
### 
"Give thy servant then an under
standing heart," was the text from
which the Rev. J. Whitcomb Brougher,
of the Temple Baptist Church of Los
Angeles, delivered his address in the
chapel Sunday. An unusually large
audience attended the service, prac
tically every seat being filled.
In speaking of Solomon's choice of
wisdom above all things, Dr. Brougher
emphasized the importance of ob
taining the power to discern good from
evil. This he said was more than a
faculty of the intellect â€”it was a moral
and spiritual attribute. Not less im
portant in the speaker's mind was the
courage of conviction after the good
has been separated from the evil; and
the superiority of the Christian life
lay in the fact that through it a man
was made master of his life.
