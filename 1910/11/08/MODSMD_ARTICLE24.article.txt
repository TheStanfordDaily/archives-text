# FALL BASEBALL PRACTICE WILL BE DISCONTINUED.
## 
### 
Owing to the unsettled condition of
the weather, the basisball schedule has
been closed for the fall semester.
Practice will be continued during the
coming week, but after the big game
none but impromptu games will be
played and those only at times when
the field is in a suitable condition.
Plans for the spring season are as
yet rather unsettled as no one has
been selected as yet to act as captain.
The Executive Committee has written
to C. E. Sampson, '09, in an effort to
engage him to coach the 1011 baseball
squad. No reply has been received,
but the committee as well as the mem
bers of the squad have high hopes of
his accepting the offer.
