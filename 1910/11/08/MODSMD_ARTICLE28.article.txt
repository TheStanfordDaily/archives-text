# ENCINA GYM. SOCCER TEAM LOOSES TO THE VAMPIRES.
## City Team Wins by a 2 to 1 Score Encina Team Will Play Barbarians Next. 
### 
In one of the hardest games of the
season, the Encina Gymnasium Soccer
Team was taken into camp Saturday
by the Vampires by a score of 2 to 1.
Up to the last five minutes of the
first half, the local aggregation man
aged to block all tries of their op
ponents when with a long shot the
inside right for the Vampires managed
to slip one past Stuart, the Encina
goal keeper, for the first tally of the
game. From this point till nearly the
middle of the last half no score was
made by either side when Fung, the
center for the locals, converted the
one and only tally the Encina team
were to have. During the last ten
minutes of play the Vampires again
registered and from then on neither
side were able to score.
Although the line-up that played
Saturday included five second squad
men the aggregation as a whole played'
very well, putting up a much better
game than many expected it would.
Next Saturday being the day of the
big game all soccer games have been
postponed but on November 19 the
Encina team will again journey to the
city, where they will line up for their
first game with the Barbarians.
Saturday's team included the follow
ing men: Forwards, Goldsworthy,
Multaner, Pung, Bellas, and Pratt;
halfs, Summerfield, Humpreys, and
Jones; fulls, Reynolds and Higgins;
goal, Stuart.
