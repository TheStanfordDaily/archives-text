# S. MITCHELL IS SHIFTED TO CENTER THREE-QUARTERS.
## Varsity Squad Will Occupy Phi Kappa Psi House on Friday, to Get Rest Before Game. 
### 
The only outcome of the Olympic
Club game last Saturday as to effect
upon the Cardinal line-up was the
shifting in practice yesterday after
noon of S. Mitchell to center, while
the Freshman Reeves went in at sec
ond live, Mitchell's old place. Tho
burn was kept at wing to fill the posi
tion left vacant by Kern's injury. The
practice, held on the sawdust field
consisted mainly in the emphasizing
by Coach Presley of certain minor
points in which (he Varsity men have
seemed weak.
The Varsity squad with substitutes,
after having been chosen Thursday
afternoon, and with Thursday night's
rally as a proof of their fellow stu
dents' loyalty, will occupy the Phi
Kappa Psi house after breakfast Fri
day morning until dinner that night.
The house has been given over to the
Cardinals by that fraternity as a place
to be together on the day before the
game, instead of following the usual
custom of going in a bus to Woodside.
After dinner at the house, the men
will return to their own rooms for
their night's rest.
