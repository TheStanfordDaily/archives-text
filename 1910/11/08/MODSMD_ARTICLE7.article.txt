# FOOTBALL SHOW PROMISES TO BE BRILLIANT SUCCESS
## 
### 
According to all present indications
the football show, which is to be given
at the Alcazar on next Saturday even
ing, following the big game, will be
the most successful of the many foot
ball shows given in San Francisco.
The Alcazar theatre, which has been
chosen as the scene of the festivities,
is one of the best arranged of the
numerous theatres in the city. The
local material which the actors will
put into the play is clever and snappy.
All these things should combine to
make the show more than usually suc
cessful.
One of the things that should make
the local hits particularly good is the
fact that the two leading men in this
show are ex-students of Stanford and
California, and understand the lines
that are introduced by way of local
joshes. These men are "Ike" Dillon,
'07, who was prominently connected
with dramatics while at Stanford, and
L. Bennison, '05, of California, who
was one of the prominent thespians of
his day.
The entire company is taking an in
terest in the success of the perform
ance from the stanpoint of the stu
dents, and all are striving to do every
thing in their power to assist tho
show. The manager makes no objec
tions to stopping the performance for
the introduction of local color, nor do
the actors. In fact, they expect to get
as much pleasure out of the evening
as do the students themselves.
The play, "Too Much Johnson" is
one of the best farces that has been
produced by an American playwright
in the past few year.*. With the local
material, and the turning over of the
play to the Stanford audience its suc
cess is assured.
Several local stunts will be intro
duced by prominent comedians of the

university. P. P. Ward, '12, and J. H. j
Forbes, '13, who have been prominent- j
ly identified with work in comic operas
in the University will be given small
parts in the play, and each will run in
some very clever material dealing
with Stanford. Both Ward and Forbes
have attended performances and will
rehearse with the company in order to
have the final presentation go off with
out a hitch. They will also be seen in
a "before-the-curtain" stunt of a local
nature between the first and second
act?.
Another feature stunt will be given
by V. W. McCourt, '14. and L. W.
Lewis, '14. Both of these Freshmen
are men of considerable experience,
and they promise to put on an act, the
nature of which they will not reveal,
which will be something new and orig
inal. They have taken part in many
kermisses and affairs of a similar na
ture and from all reports are of more
than average ability. They will be
Keen during the intermission between
the second and third acts.
Another feature of the evening
which will add to the general effect is
the fact that the orchestra will play
arrangements of Stanford songs dur
ing the waits. All of the old time
songs and favorite selections will be !
played.
The great feature of the perfor
mance, as has been said, will be the ;
turning over the play to the men of i
Stanford, and the introduction of the
many clever songs and stunts already
described.
The sale of seats for the perfor
mance is unprecedented in the history
of Stanford football shows. The ma
jority of the best seats are alreday
gone, and it. seems certain that the
house will be packed to overflowing on
Saturday evening.

The Alcazar theatre, which has been
chosen as the scene of the festivities,
is one of the best arranged of the
numerous theatres in the city. The
local material which the actors will
put into the play is clever and snappy.
All these things should combine to
make the show more than usually suc
cessful.
One of the things that should make
the local hits particularly good is the
fact that the two leading men in this
show are ex-students of Stanford and
California, and understand the lines
that are introduced by way of local
joshes. These men are "Ike" Dillon,
'07, who was prominently connected
with dramatics while at Stanford, and
L. Bennison, '05, of California, who
was one of the prominent thespians of
his day.
The entire company is taking an in
terest in the success of the perform
ance from the stanpoint of the stu
dents, and all are striving to do every
thing in their power to assist tho
show. The manager makes no objec
tions to stopping the performance for
the introduction of local color, nor do
the actors. In fact, they expect to get
as much pleasure out of the evening
as do the students themselves.
The play, "Too Much Johnson" is
one of the best farces that has been
produced by an American playwright
in the past few year.*. With the local
material, and the turning over of the
play to the Stanford audience its suc
cess is assured.
Several local stunts will be intro
duced by prominent comedians of the

university. P. P. Ward, '12, and J. H. j
Forbes, '13, who have been prominent- j
ly identified with work in comic operas
in the University will be given small
parts in the play, and each will run in
some very clever material dealing
with Stanford. Both Ward and Forbes
have attended performances and will
rehearse with the company in order to
have the final presentation go off with
out a hitch. They will also be seen in
a "before-the-curtain" stunt of a local
nature between the first and second
act?.
Another feature stunt will be given
by V. W. McCourt, '14. and L. W.
Lewis, '14. Both of these Freshmen
are men of considerable experience,
and they promise to put on an act, the
nature of which they will not reveal,
which will be something new and orig
inal. They have taken part in many
kermisses and affairs of a similar na
ture and from all reports are of more
than average ability. They will be
Keen during the intermission between
the second and third acts.
Another feature of the evening
which will add to the general effect is
the fact that the orchestra will play
arrangements of Stanford songs dur
ing the waits. All of the old time
songs and favorite selections will be !
played.
The great feature of the perfor
mance, as has been said, will be the ;
turning over the play to the men of i
Stanford, and the introduction of the
many clever songs and stunts already
described.
The sale of seats for the perfor
mance is unprecedented in the history
of Stanford football shows. The ma
jority of the best seats are alreday
gone, and it. seems certain that the
house will be packed to overflowing on
Saturday evening.
According to all present indications
the football show, which is to be given
at the Alcazar on next Saturday even
ing, following the big game, will be
the most successful of the many foot
ball shows given in San Francisco.
