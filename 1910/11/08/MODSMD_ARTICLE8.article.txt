# COTILLION TICKETS WILL GO ON SALE NEXT WEEK.
## Sophomores Formulate Plans For Very Unique Dance at Armory on December 3. 
### 
On December 3 the Sophomore Class
will hold their cotillion, which at the
present writing, promises to be of an
exceptional character. According o
the wishes of the Faculty Committee
on Student x\ffairs, the idea of elabo
rately decorating the Armory on that
night has been abandoned, and many
unique ideas in this line will be sub
stituted. The general color scheme of
decorating will be carried out in the
designs on the programs and the favor
dance?.
The Cotillion committee is very per
emptory in its request that there
should be no carriages or (lowers. A
number of special cars will be used
that night which will leave the campus
between 7:4.3 and S o'clock, returning
immediately after the last dance.
Fourteen dances have been arranged
on the program with no extras. There
will be two favor dances and two cotil
lion figures, but the latter will be very
short. It has been thought best to
eliminate the numerous, long figures
of the past years, as it is impossible to
arrange for satisfactory practices be
fore the dance. No rehearsals will he
held this year. The intermission will
occur between the seventh and eighth
dances.
Tickets will be placed on sale some
time next week at the usual price of
$2.50. Under no conditions will the
sale be allowed to exceed 175 tickets,
as this number of couples is consider
ed the limit of the comfortable danc
ing capacity of the Armory. The pro
grams will be distributed on the Quad
as usual about one week before the
dance.
Brohaska's full orchestra has been
engaged for the evening and all vho
have attended previous college func
tions are aware that this in itself in
sures the best of music for the occa
sion.
