# FESTIVITIES WILL BE HELD IN ROOMS OF PRESS CLUB.
## Entire Student Body Invited to Smoker Friday. â€” Good Program Assured by Committee. 
### 
Friday evening the Alumni Associa
tion of the University will give an en
tertainment at the rooms of the Press
Club of San Francisco. This has al
ways been the custom in the past 011
the eve of a big game held on Califor
nia Field. This year, however, the
affair will be much larger than ever
before. This is owing to the fact that
never before has the Association de
voted so much time to the preparation
of the program as they have for Fri
day's entertainment. The Press Club
of San Francisco have given their
rooms to the Alumni Association for
the evening and besides extending a
cordial invitation to the entire Student
Hody of Stafford, a special invitation
has been issued to the Press Club of
Stanford to attend the function as an
association.
The affair will take the nature of a
huge smoker and general entertain
ment. Those in charge promise a
most interesting program for the
evening. There will be the usual
interests in the way of vaudeville en
tertainers. One of the features of the
program will be the chalk talks to be
given by well known San Francisco
cartoonists and artists. There will be
considerable Stanford talent on the
program and among these will appear
E. M. Albright, '12, with one of his
well known bits on Stanford through
the medium of chalk and one of bis
monologues.
Smoke and all the necessaries that
go with it will be provided by the
Alumni, and they promise a rollicking
good time to all who come to the city
on Friday evening. The Press Club
rooms are situated at 533 Market
street and can be reached by taking
any car on Market street and getting
off at Powell street.
The Alumni Association is planning
for a big crowd on Friday evening and
according to present indications, they
are not going to be disappointed.
