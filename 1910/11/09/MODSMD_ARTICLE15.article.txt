Tomorrow evening the Stanford Stu
dent Body will give the Cardinal team
their linal formal send-off before the
contest next Saturday afternoon. This
will be the hist opportunity that the
students will be given to evidence
their willingness to support the fif
teen and to give them some concep
tion of the assistance that is to be
back of them upon the bleachers.
There is no man who can fail to attend
the rally tomorrow night nor can any
man show a lack of enthusiasm after
he arrives. Stanford has her hardest
fight in years next Saturday and every
individual in the Student Body must
show every other individual that his
entire sympathy and assistance is for
the team, whether they win or lose.
Every show of enthusiasm and spirit
is an iota added to the possibility of a
victory, for we cannot annex a suc
cessful game this year without a great
amount of moral support from the
entire Student Body. Thursday even
ing will be a last final opportunity for
the Student Body to show their spirit
and the support that they will give
their representatives this year. Be
there and make the team know that
the entire University is with them.
