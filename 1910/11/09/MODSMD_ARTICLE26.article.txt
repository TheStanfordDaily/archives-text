The largest number of entries in all
these events will be in the Edward

The teams which will represent the
two underclasses in the Freshman-
Sophomore debate are busily prepar
ing for their coming battle of words.
Unusually able trios will meet on the
Chapel rostrum on November 29 and
the decision should be a difficult one
for the judges to render. The subject
for debate is: "Resolved, That the
constitutional amendment granting
the federal government power to levy
an income tax should be endorsed by
the legislatures of the several states."
The Sophomores will uphold the af
firmative contention and their speak

and P. D. Noweil. The Freshmen re
presented by O. H. Castle, W. B. Owen,
and C. C. Close will render the nega
