# THIRD ISSUE OF MONTHLY WILL APPEAR TOMORROW.
## Articles Deal With Big Game and Intercollegiate Rallies.â€” Stories in Number Exceptionally Good. 
### 
Owing to a delay of the printer, the
"Big Game" number of the "Sequoia,"
which was announced to appear on the
campus today, will not be placed on
sale until tomorrow. Two articles in
this issue deal with the game of Satur
day and the preliminaries, a third ar
ticle deals with the Women's Boat Club
which is planned. There are three
stories in this magazine, two by well
known literary folk of the University,
and a third by an new entrant into
the story field.
The first article of the issue is en
titled the "Outlook for the Twelfth."
It is a brief resume by Paul Eliel, '13,
dealing with the prospects for the
game on Saturday, the relative
strength of the teams, and the particu
lar points of play in which each should
excell. The author predicts a Stanford
victory.
A highly interesting and entirely
new article by M. M. Fogel, '12, deals
with the subject of the "History of
Intercollegiate Rallies." The various
kinds and phases of rallies at the
University before the big games of the
past are dilated upon at some length.
From the standpoint of fiction, the
number is particularly strong. B. O.
Bliven, '11, contributes a story entitled
"The Incomplete Author." This is a
very clever and original bit of work
dealing with the dabbler in the field of
letters.
L. M. Robinson, '12, is the author of
a story "into His Heritage." It is a
very original and cleverly written bit
of work.
Another story has been accepted
from a new writer, it is called "Paula
Zenker: Teacher." The scene of this
piece is laid in Germany. It is a bold,
daring, and original story, and is quite
different from any that the "Sequoia"
has contained in the past.
Poetry is contributed by E. J. Hop
kins, ex-'ll, and M. T. Dooling, '14.
Editorially, the sheet deals with the
big game, the women's boat house, and
the attitude taken by the "Chaparral"
in regard to the "rough-neck" article
which appeared in last month's issue.
Editor F. E. Hill, '11, takes occasion to
disagree with "Chappie" in regard to
the stand which that paper took, and
shows that the attitude was more or
less unfounded.
