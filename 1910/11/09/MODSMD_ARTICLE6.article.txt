# MANY ALUMNI AND RUGBY ENTHUSIASTS HERE FOR GAME
## Three Special Cars to Arrive From Los Angeles.â€” L.A. High to Send Big Delegation. 
### 
Never before in the history of foot
ball games between the two institu
tions has so much interest been shown
by Alumni and outsiders as is being
evinced in the game of Saturday next.
From all parts of the state they arc
coming in to see the contest, and even
from other states a few of the old
students are arriving on the campus
and in San Francisco. II is certain
that there will be at least two car
loads of graduates and old students
coming from Los Angeles in the next
day or two.
Two special cars have been charter
ed by these enthusiasts for their ex
clusive use and they will arrive either
Thursday evening or Friday morning.
Another carload of rugby enthusiasts
will arrive from Los Angeles when u
party of students from the Los Ange
les High School, who have also char
tered a special car, reach the campus.
They will probably leave the southern
metropolis ibis evening.
