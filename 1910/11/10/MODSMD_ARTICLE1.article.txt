# Cardinal Fighters Chosen by Coach Presley to Fill Positions on 1910 Varsity Fifteen
## 
### 
Coach Presley this afternoon made
formal announcement of the 1910
Stanford Varsity Rugby Team which
meets California next Saturday after
noon for the championship of the two
universities. Practically fourteen if
the places have been known since
Tuesday, and any one who has follow
ed the line-up changes up to that
time will feel no surprise in the above
list. The right wing three-quarters
position was undecided until after yes
terday afternoon's short game between
second and third teams and Varsity
substitutes. Thoburn and Worswick
were given final try-outs for the
wingship, with result that Thoburn
was chosen. There may also have
been some doubt yesterday as to the
substitutes. The likely men were also
given a chance to show their worth in
the brief contest.
CHEDA.
A player who is considered even by
his opponents to be most qualified + o
be called the best forward on the
Pacific Coast is G. E. Cheda, '10, of
San Luis Obispo, the choice of Coach
Presley for front rank. Cheda is
probably the strongest individual
player on the fifteen and is always
on the ball. He dribbles to perfection
and is the foremost exponent of that
art on the team. Cheda has played on
two Varsities as a regular, and was
also substituted on the 190S Varsity
at rear rank, a position which he has
played for several games this fall, as
well. He weighs 185 pounds, and, al
though his height is but 5 feet, BV£
inches, yet he is closely built, and
carries his weight well. He is 25
years old. Preparing at San Luis
Obispo High, he entered with the class
of 1910, and played on his Freshman
fifteen. He is a major in the Geology
Department, and has membership in
Encina Club.
ARRELL.
Taken from the backfield and put
into front rank of the pack .1. L. Ar
rell, '12, has maintained his reputation
for fearlessness and fight. With Cheda
he will be at the breakaway position
of the team. He was center on the
victorious 1913 fifteen last year and was
one of the largest men in the back
field. This year he has been noted for
strong defense work, and has been
kept out of several games because of
injuries received through over-aggres
siveness. Arrell prepared at Moline
High School, Illinois, his home being
in Moline. He is on the roil of Phi
Gamma Delta. He stands 5 feet, lOVfc
inches, and has a weight of 170
pounds. His age is 22 years. Eco
nomic-! is his major.
DOLE.
Captain K. L. Dole, '11. will play his
usual hard game at side rank. On two
previous Varsity teams he held the
pcrum in place at the lock position, in
1908 and 1909. This year it has been
thought that he could do better work
in the second rank and he was put
there. Of all men on the team Dole

j gives the impression of cool depen
! (lability, and lends confidence to his
! fellow mates in no small way. He is
I always at (he point wanted, and his
j height, coupled with the detennina
| tion which he possesses, makes him
| unequaled in the important line-outs.
He is forever working, though in a
quiet way, and spectacular plays are
seldom his. He is one of the men
who will sacrifice everything to pay
the price that will let the backs
through to a score. Teamwork is his
especial aim. Dole played as lock in
his Freshman year and is an all
round pack man. He prepared at
Riverside High and lives in Riverside.
His major is systematic Botany. Dole
is 22 years old, is 6 feet 1 inch tall,
and weighs 195 pounds. He is a mem -
ber of Beta Theta Pi, Quadrangle Club,
Skull and Snakes, and was an oarsman
on the 1909 Varsity crew, and the
1911 Freshman eight.
JimTKN.
L. Minturn, '09, of Fresno, is the sec
ond of the pair of "200" men in the
scrum. He will serve to keep the pack
together in the position of lock, a place
he has held in two Varsity games prev
iously, in 1909 and 1907. Last year
he also played, making this his four
star year. His position in 1909 was
middle rank in the."5-2-3 formation of
the forwards. Minturn was a player
of the old game at Belmont, his pre
paratory school, his position being
guard. He has always been set down
as a certain member of the team be
cause of his wide experience and the
use he makes of it. He is a persistent
follower of the ball, being especially
valuable in the loose. As a lock he
has demonstrated his superiority.
Minturn is 23 years old and mi even
200 in weight. His height is <3 feet,
IVz inches. He is enrolled in Delta
Kappa Epsilon, and is a member of
Skull and Snakes. His major is Elec
trical Engineering.
OUrSTKW>.
A man who has only had to learn
the finer points of the game in order to
qualify for the Varsity was C. E. Olm
stead, '14, of Los Angeles. Olmstead
has come to the front in strides al
most as great as his own on the field
and has been deemed worthy by Coach
Presley to assume a place at side-

rank, opposite Captain Dole. He is
one of the two "200" men in the pack,
"Cub" Minturn being the other holder
of the title. Olmstead has the ability
to keep going, and, after having lent
his great store of push to the scrum,
can follow up and be 011 hand in a pas
sing rush, ready to take the ball. He
prepared at Harvard School in Los
Angeles, and, entering Stanford this
year, was the center of the Freshman
scrum at lock. He is 21 years old;
weighs 200 pounds, and is 6 feet, 1
inch in height. Olmstead majors in
Geology, and is a member of Kappa
Sigma.
PARTRIDGE.
The only player on the team who
has a valid claim to being the "tallest
man of the fifteen, is rear ranker J. F.
Partridge, '12, of Alameda. Partridge
is 6 feet, 3 inches in height, and com
bines with that a scale measurement
of 190 pounds. When he settles him
self behind the pack to push, it gen
erally happens that the ball comes out,
or that something gives way. He is
indispensible in line-outs and, with
Captain Dole, does most to knock the
pigskin to the backs. And when, by
any chance he gets the ball in his own
posession several of the opposing
players in front find in tackling him
that they are carried for a short jour
ney down the turf. Partridge is a
Hitchcock Military School man, and is
a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon. As
a Freshman he played 011 his fifteen
against California, and stroked the
first year crew. Last year he was
stroke of the winning Varsity eight.
FRANK.
The smallest and yet one of the
hardest fighters in the scrum is A. il.
Frank, '1?.. who will hold the second
rear rank position. Frank is absolute
ly fearless and, not content with
carrying out the duties of a scrum
worker he takes bis place among the
backs in rushes and does his share of
the passing. As a dribbler also he
does his part, and is an all-round
rugby player, this being the more sur
prising because of his size. Frank is
another of the Los Angeleans, having
received his preparatory training at
the Los Angeles High School. His
weight is 152, age 19 and height. 5 feet.
8 inches. He is a History major, and

is a holder of membership in Encina
Club.
SCNDELL.
After having played wing for half
the schedule A. L. Sundell. '12, was
shilted to wing forward by Coach
Presley, and in that place he has
guided the destinies of the scrum in a
creditable way. He is light and tall,
and can follow the ball with ease in
its varying fortunes among the feet of
the two opposing packs. He has
learned rapidly the many kinks in the
duties of a wing forward, and will be
able to smother any of the plays car
ried out by the heavier eight-man
scrum, which California will put upon
the field. On his Freshman team Sun
dell played at wing three-quarters.
He lives in Alameda, having prepared
at Boone's Academy, and has member
ship in Delta Kappa Epsilon. He is
22 years of age, is six feet tall and
weighs 167. Geology is his major.
ERH.
Scrum half, one of the most dif
ficult individual positions on the team
will be filled by B. E. Erb, '12, of
Chenanus, British Columbia, where
rugby playing comes as second nature.
Erb was a sensation in the same posi
tion on the 1908 Varsity fifteen, being
the only Freshman who made the cov
eted "S" in football that year. He
was not in college last fall. This sea
son Erb has been a brilliant player,
and as a kicker in tight places is not
to be equaled. Besides being a mem
ber of the 190S Varsity he captained
his 1912 Freshman fifteen. He is 20
years old, weighs 160 pounds, and is 5
feet, BV 2 inches in height. Erb pre
pared at Victoria High School in Brit
ish Columbia. He is a member of Sig
ma Alpha Epsilon, and registers in
Geology.
lIARRIG AX.
Another Freshman who has devel
oped unusually in one season after
having come here with a knowledge
of the game gained from several years
play at Los Angeles High School, as a
teammate of Geissler, is P. F. Harri
gan, '14, who will inaugurate many of
the passing rushes at the difficult po
sition of first five, where he played on
the first-year team this fall. But Har
rigan is capable of filling all calls
made upon his ability, despiV his be
ing the shortest of all the fifteen by a
half inch, and the lightest u\ seven
pounds. He has a weight of only 145
pounds, and 5 feet, Q/ 2 inches of
height. Like Geissler he is closely
knit together and can carry out a
great amount of rugged dashing
through the opponents. Nothing
daunts him. He is 19 years old, and
lives in Los Angeles. Beta Theta Pi
is his fraternity, and Economics his
major.
REEVES.
The second of the two fives will also
be a member of the Freshman class,
F. W. Reeves, '1«, of San Bernardino.
Reeves had a similar position on the
1914 team this fall, and has so per
formed during the whole season as to
give confidence that although having
no Varsity experience he will be able
to more than hold his own against
his California opponent. His particu
lar ability lies in quick dodging at a
high rate of speed. Any reasonable
pass will find a safe place in his
hands, and fumbles are rare with him.
Reeves is the youngest of his team
mates, being only 18 years of age. He
is 5 feet, inches tall, and in weight
the scales balance at 155 pounds. His
fraternity is Sigma Nu, and his major
Civil Engineering.
MITCHELL.
S. L. Mitchell, '13, of Los Angeles
drops back to center three-quarters
from his old position at second five,
from which part of the backfield on
the 1909 Varsity he scored two tries
in the 1909 contest. He is the stead
iest man in the backfield. When he
advances he twists and turns in such
a fashion that it is extremely difficult
to tackle him. His strong point in
making gains and scores is the fact
that he presents a bold front to the
opposing team and runs in a straight
line to his goal. As a Freshman he
captained the 1913 fifteen against Cal
ifornia, the first Freshman team that
had defeated the Blue and Gold for
four years. Mitchell is also a Los
Angeles High School player. He tips
the beam at ISO, and stands 5 feet,
10-1-4 inches. His age is 22 years. Be
sides being a rugby athlete Mitchell
guarded third base on the victorious
1910 nine. He is a member of Zeta
Psi, and majors in Economics.
GEISSLER.
E. P. Geissler, '14, after having cap
tained and played at wing on his
Freshman fifteen this fall very natur
ally fell into a similar playing posi
tion on the Varsity, and there he will
be seen Saturday against the Blue and
Gold. He has held his place against
all comers by virtue of his superior
ability to find touch in unexpected
kicks at critical moments, and in forc
ing himself ahead with buldog tena
city. He acquired several years of
rugby while playing on the Los Ange
les High School fifteen, and with
scattered teams organized for im
promptu games in the Southland. Geis
sler is one of the shortest and young
est men on the team, being 19 years
old, and 5 feet, 7 inches in height.
But he is hard as a rock and his 170
pounds of weight are so knitted to
gether that, he can stand almost any
of the hard knocks. His home is in
Los Angeles, and he is enrolled in Zeta
Psi. He is a Pre-Legal major.
TIIOHI'UX
A man who has developed marvel
ously in one year is .T. H. Thoburn,
'13, of Palo Alto, who will hold the
important position of wing. He was
l)iit upon the Varsity squad at the con
clusion of the Freshman season last
year, but showed no particular prom
ise until this fall. He played his
Freshman position at five-eights for
several weeks of the Varsity games,
and was later putin at center, where
he has been both dependable and ag
gressive. When Kern was injure.i.

Thoburn was putin his place by
Coach Presley. He is especially good
at ploughing through a loose field as
a ground gainer, and in getting his
pass in to his teammates before being
put down in a tackle. The experience
he received in preparatory school at
Palo Alto High, where he played full
back, and was considered one of the
best recruits from that source of
plucky rugby fighters. Thoburn has
twenty years to his credit, and a
weight of 160 pounds. His height is
5 feet, 10 inches. He is a member of
Phi Delta Theta and majors in Physi
ology.
BRONX.
A fullback who has no equal on
the Coast is F. C. Brown, '11, who will
take care of that defensive point on
the 1910 Cardinal Varsity. Brown has
had much experience on his ground.
He played on the 1911 Freshman team,
and last year on the 1909 Varsity. He
also substituted for Cadwalader in the
last half of the 1908 Varsity struggle.
He is a noted kicker, and fifty yards is
a very average didstance for his won
derful kicks to touch. He is further
more looked to by Stanford supporters
to execute one or two field goals by
drop-kicking during the game, and his
dexterity in that difficult art is rarely
found among Varsity players. Brown
was injured during the 1909 season
and went into the California game,
having had no practice for two weeks.
For that reason he did not do himself
justice. This year however, he is in
full condition and should best Dwig
gins in kicking bouts. He lives in
Selma, and has membership in En
cina Club. His age is 22, his weight
175, height 5 feet, 10 inches. As a
major he has Civil Engineering.
As substitutes, Coach Presley has
chosen nine men, although the rules
will allow but three of these men to be
used on Saturday afternoon.
J. W. Fitting, '10, has been chosen as
substitute with A. M. Sanborn, '12,
for the front rank position. Fitting
comes from San Francisco and is a
member of Encina Club. Sanborn lives
in Redlands and his fraternity is Phi
Delta Theta.
H. L. Horton, 'OS, will be substitute
middle ranker. He is a member of
Encina Club and comes from Ukiah.
E. C. Baumgartner, '13, and W. L.
Smith, '11, are selected as rear rank
substitutes. Baumgartner lives in San
Jose and Smith is a resident of Fer i
dalc.
E. C. Woodcock, '11, w.ill be substi
tute free lance at wing forward. He
is a member of Encina Club and lives
in Portland, Oregon.
The remaining three men will be
substituted for the backfield positions.
L. Cass, '13, of Los Angeles and a
member of Zeta Psi will substitute for
half.
T. Sanborn, '12, is substitute for the
five-eights position. Sanborn is a
member of Phi Delta Theta and lives:
in Redlands.
The wing positions will be substitut
ed for by G. D. Worswick, '13, of San
Jose. Worswick is a member of the
Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity.
