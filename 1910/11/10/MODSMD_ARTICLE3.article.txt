The fifteen men who Avill represent
Stanford in the struggle next Satur
day have been selected by the coach.
Every man is well fitted to occupy his
respective place upon the team and
justly deserves the position given him
after the hard season of faithful work
and training. These particular men
are to be congratulated upon their suc
cess, but we should not forget that the
efficiency of our Varsity depends to a
great extent upon the faithful services
of the members of the scpiad who did
not secure places in the final appor
tionment of positions. Many of these
men realized before the season was
finished that their chances were slight
yet they unselfishly and constantly
maintained their training in order that
the Varsity might have sufficient prac
tice to put them in excellent condition
for the intercollegiate contest. Appre
ciating their attitude and their spirit,
we wish to extend them our hearty
congratulations and commendations
for the work that they have done
throughout the season. This is a fair
sample of the Stanford spirit of un
selfishness which produces our win
ing teams.
