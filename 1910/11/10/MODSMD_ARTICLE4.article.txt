# ST. FRANCIS TENDERS MONEY TOWARD STINT.
## 
### 
That the St. Francis Hotel is inter
ested in Stanford and its showing at
the big game was evidenced the other
day by the offer of Manager Woods to
finance a new bleacher stunt. The
hotel has contributed $40 toward the
fund and the Stunt Committee has de
veloped a new an doriginal idea for the
game. The committee refuses to di
vulge the nature of their idea, but they
promise something decidedly different
from past effects.
The St. Francis is to be the head
quarters for the Stanford team over
Saturday. They have further offered
a special rate to students of the Uni
versity.
