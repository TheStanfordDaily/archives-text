Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Although (lie coming Football Show
has had an unusually large sale of
seats to both Stanford women and
men, yet it has been rumored that
some few Stanford women are under
misapprehension as to the nature of
the evening's entertainment. 1 wish
to assure them that this Football
Show has been planned as a good
clean jollification for the ENTIRE
Stanford Student Body. The show it
self is of tiie usual high standard of
Belasco production. The great vol
ume of local color that has been intro

bids fair to make it a show that to
miss will be to regret. For the benefit
of any who have not as yet secured
seats, 1 wish to announce that orders
may be left at the Stanford Bookstore.
These orders will be phoned to the
Alcazar Theatre at once where reser
vations will be made and tickets held.
