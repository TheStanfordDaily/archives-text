# EXECUTIVE BOARD HOLDS REGULAR WEEKLY MEETING.
## Post Season Rugby Series by Clubs and Fraternities Discussed by Committee. 
### 
But little regular business was
transacted at the regular meeting of
the Executive Committee held last
evening. The only point of interest
was the discussion of the post season
rugby series, which was instituted
last year in a series of games between
the various clubs and fraternities on
the campus. It is impossible to state
what will be done in regard to this
matter, but the Committee has called
a meeting of lhe representatives of
the various clubs and fraternities in
order to discuss this series. It is
probable that a schedule can be ar
ranged. Last year the interest in rug
by was maintained throughout the
entire first semester through the
means of these games.
The minutes of the meeting follow:
Rgular meeting of the Executive
