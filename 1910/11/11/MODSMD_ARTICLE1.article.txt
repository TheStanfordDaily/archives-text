# Cardinal Varsity Enters Hardest Rugby Football Fight in Years
## RIVAL FIFTEENS MEET IN ANNUAL CONTEST TOMORROW 
### 
If the San Francisco sporting writ
ers are to be believed, the Cardinal
hopes of winning the great rugby
struggle tomorrow on California Field
are already laid out, embalmed and
putin the ground. They say that in
this twentieth contest between Stan
ford and California that the California
Varsity will make the total games won
in twenty years, six; while the Stan
ford boast is to stay at ten, with the
four tie struggles annexed by no one.
On neither campus, however, are hopes
so high among the undergraduates,
that no doubt can creep in. Califor
nia's Student Body of three thousand
think that their fifteen can carry off
a second successive victory by a safe
margin, while the Stanford backers,
not quite so certain, are maintaining
that all has not yet been said of their
team. There the opinions stand. At
2:30 tomorrow Referee G. Jenkinson's
whistle will sound the blast that,
about eighty minutes later will end
the game with the Cardinal colors in
supremacy or a pair of victories to
the Blue and Gold's credit. Last year,
California team broke a succession of
six straight defeats and a tie and
won from the Cardinal, 19-I.'? in a
game in which they were easily the
better fifteen.
From the very beginning, Stanford
has known what its work would have
to be in order to win, when it was
found that California had a string of
veterans prepared for the sacrifico,
whose number would be almost
enough to line-up two fifteens. But
Coach Presley started the long, grind
ing preliminary season with his accus
tomed energy and determination, and
it was apparent that it would take all
the veterans that California had in
her training house in order to win the
game. The two teams, one with four
teen veterans playing every game, and
the other, in the latter half of the sea

son, with four Freshmen and only six
veterans in the line-up, played game
after game with an equality of ability
that was unusual. The Stanford spirit
of developing splendid machines out of
almost raw material was at work.
Neither squad was handicapped by any
very great loss of players through in
juries. Now, in the last week of prep
aration, each has been weakened by
the absence from the announced line
up of a star back: Kern, of Stanford,
and Elliott, of California. But it is
thought that Elliott wil be able to
play. California has lost no other
men; Stanford has lost Schaupp, a
very promising forward who was mak
ing good. In injuries, therefore the
record of each team was a remarkably
clean one, and very equal.
Coach Presley was forced to devePbp
practically an entire back field ami
his efforts were notably successful.
He had little trouble in fitting the t\ct>-
Freshman team fives, Harrigan and
Reeves, into their positions and Geis
sler found his natural work at wing.
Mitchell went into center acceptably,
because of his superior power of
adaptability. It was difficult, however,
to fill the other wing. Thoburn was
placed there and the supporters of
the team depend upon him.
Glancing at the statistical table
Stanford proves to have a heavier
team by three pounds to the man in
cluding both backs and forwards. This
fact is in favor of the Cardinal team.
Scrum to scrum California outweighs
her opponents by about one pound to
a man, averaging eight men in the
Blue and Gold pack and seven in the
Cardinal. The total weight of the two
scrums, however, is 1488 for Califor
nia's eight men, and 1292 for Stan
ford's seven players. The team from
across the bay will therefore have a
pushing advantage of 196 pounds.
