# Cardinal Varsity Enters Hardest Rugby Football Fight in Years
## RIVAL FIFTEENS MEET IN ANNUAL CONTEST TOMORROW 
### 
If the San Francisco sporting writ
ers are to be believed, the Cardinal
hopes of winning the great rugby
struggle tomorrow on California Field
are already laid out, embalmed and
putin the ground. They say that in
this twentieth contest between Stan
ford and California that the California
Varsity will make the total games won
in twenty years, six; while the Stan
ford boast is to stay at ten, with the
four tie struggles annexed by no one.
On neither campus, however, are hopes
so high among the undergraduates,
that no doubt can creep in. Califor
nia's Student Body of three thousand
think that their fifteen can carry off
a second successive victory by a safe
margin, while the Stanford backers,
not quite so certain, are maintaining
that all has not yet been said of their
team. There the opinions stand. At
2:30 tomorrow Referee G. Jenkinson's
whistle will sound the blast that,
about eighty minutes later will end
the game with the Cardinal colors in
supremacy or a pair of victories to
the Blue and Gold's credit. Last year,
California team broke a succession of
six straight defeats and a tie and
won from the Cardinal, 19-I.'? in a
game in which they were easily the
better fifteen.
From the very beginning, Stanford
has known what its work would have
to be in order to win, when it was
found that California had a string of
veterans prepared for the sacrifico,
whose number would be almost
enough to line-up two fifteens. But
Coach Presley started the long, grind
ing preliminary season with his accus
tomed energy and determination, and
it was apparent that it would take all
the veterans that California had in
her training house in order to win the
game. The two teams, one with four
teen veterans playing every game, and
the other, in the latter half of the sea

son, with four Freshmen and only six
veterans in the line-up, played game
after game with an equality of ability
that was unusual. The Stanford spirit
of developing splendid machines out of
almost raw material was at work.
Neither squad was handicapped by any
very great loss of players through in
juries. Now, in the last week of prep
aration, each has been weakened by
the absence from the announced line
up of a star back: Kern, of Stanford,
and Elliott, of California. But it is
thought that Elliott wil be able to
play. California has lost no other
men; Stanford has lost Schaupp, a
very promising forward who was mak
ing good. In injuries, therefore the
record of each team was a remarkably
clean one, and very equal.
Coach Presley was forced to devePbp
practically an entire back field ami
his efforts were notably successful.
He had little trouble in fitting the t\ct>-
Freshman team fives, Harrigan and
Reeves, into their positions and Geis
sler found his natural work at wing.
Mitchell went into center acceptably,
because of his superior power of
adaptability. It was difficult, however,
to fill the other wing. Thoburn was
placed there and the supporters of
the team depend upon him.
Glancing at the statistical table
Stanford proves to have a heavier
team by three pounds to the man in
cluding both backs and forwards. This
fact is in favor of the Cardinal team.
Scrum to scrum California outweighs
her opponents by about one pound to
a man, averaging eight men in the
Blue and Gold pack and seven in the
Cardinal. The total weight of the two
scrums, however, is 1488 for Califor
nia's eight men, and 1292 for Stan
ford's seven players. The team from
across the bay will therefore have a
pushing advantage of 196 pounds.


Tlic 1910 Varsity Fifteen, Coach Presley and Substitutes.
In height the two fifteens are equal,
a coincidence that happened last year
in the Varsity contest. This year the
men average 5 feet, 10 inches. In age,
California averages one year older
than Stanford, this being accounted
for by reason of the greater number
of underclassmen on that team, there
being four Freshmen and two Sopho
mores.
A full list of the scores of all games
made by the two teams in the prelim
inary schedules will be found in an
other column. The thing to be under
lined most is the fact that California
has been scored upon twice with a
total of 15 points, by Barbarians and
Olympics. The Barbarian try, how
ever, was made against a substitute
full-back on the California team.
Dwiggins was not in. The Olympic's
ten points were made against the
complete Varsity, with the diminutive
Dwiggins in charge of the last de
fense. These tries made against Cal
ifornia, with none registered against
Stanford, seem to indicate that the
California defense is weakest, and the
evidence of the tallies cannot be
wholly disregarded. Again, how does
it happen that the Blue and Gold
rolled up against Nevada the largest
total on record on the Pacific Coast,
62, while the Cardinal were able to
mark up a meager 8 points? There
was a difference of two weeks between
the two games. California had the full
strength of the Varsity, absolutely, in
a final game before the championship:
Stanford on the contrary, was much
organized, and on foreign ground in a
different climate. The Blue "and Gold
had all conditions, of field, organiza
tion and weather in their favor. Al
though it may show that Stanford
lacked a little necessary fight at that
time, yet the two games cannot hardly
be put upon an equal footing. The
comparative scores made against the
Barbarians are not to be looked at too
closely, because, while the Olympic
Club always had a strong team, then
rival clubmen seldom brought any
where near the same fifteen on suc
cessive occasions. The fact that Cali
fornia has played nine games to Stan
ford's seven in the preliminary season
may have given the team more oppor
tunities to acquire confidence in one
another and, of course the value of the
additional practice cannot be under
estimated. And yet the advisibility of
having two games a week with fast
teams is doubtful. Taking the Olym
pics only, then, for comparisons we
find that in three games Stanford has
tallied GO points; in four games Cali
fornia has scored 91. The average
per game is, 20 for Stanford and 23,
for the Blue and Gold. This seems to
give the latter Varsity an apparent ad
vantage. The merit of this method of
judging the two teams, must, however,
be left to individual taste.
For the fourth consecutive time G
Jenkinson, the experienced veteran
from Vancouver, will referee the great
game. .T. H. Lanagan, Stanford's for
mer football coach, will hold the flags
representing Stanford, while G. V.
Bell, a California athlete of some years
back, will represent, his alma mater as
a touch judge. The two brothers, E. .T.
Brown, U. C. '97, and I). E. Brown, S.
'97, are to hold the watche3 for the
tenth time in intercollegiate contests.

Cardinal. The total weight of the two
scrums, however, is 1488 for Califor
nia's eight men, and 1292 for Stan
ford's seven players. The team from
across the bay will therefore have a
pushing advantage of 196 pounds.


Tlic 1910 Varsity Fifteen, Coach Presley and Substitutes.
In height the two fifteens are equal,
a coincidence that happened last year
in the Varsity contest. This year the
men average 5 feet, 10 inches. In age,
California averages one year older
than Stanford, this being accounted
for by reason of the greater number
of underclassmen on that team, there
being four Freshmen and two Sopho
mores.
A full list of the scores of all games
made by the two teams in the prelim
inary schedules will be found in an
other column. The thing to be under
lined most is the fact that California
has been scored upon twice with a
total of 15 points, by Barbarians and
Olympics. The Barbarian try, how
ever, was made against a substitute
full-back on the California team.
Dwiggins was not in. The Olympic's
ten points were made against the
complete Varsity, with the diminutive
Dwiggins in charge of the last de
fense. These tries made against Cal
ifornia, with none registered against
Stanford, seem to indicate that the
California defense is weakest, and the
evidence of the tallies cannot be
wholly disregarded. Again, how does
it happen that the Blue and Gold
rolled up against Nevada the largest
total on record on the Pacific Coast,
62, while the Cardinal were able to
mark up a meager 8 points? There
was a difference of two weeks between
the two games. California had the full
strength of the Varsity, absolutely, in
a final game before the championship:
Stanford on the contrary, was much
organized, and on foreign ground in a
different climate. The Blue "and Gold
had all conditions, of field, organiza
tion and weather in their favor. Al
though it may show that Stanford
lacked a little necessary fight at that
time, yet the two games cannot hardly
be put upon an equal footing. The
comparative scores made against the
Barbarians are not to be looked at too
closely, because, while the Olympic
Club always had a strong team, then
rival clubmen seldom brought any
where near the same fifteen on suc
cessive occasions. The fact that Cali
fornia has played nine games to Stan
ford's seven in the preliminary season
may have given the team more oppor
tunities to acquire confidence in one
another and, of course the value of the
additional practice cannot be under
estimated. And yet the advisibility of
having two games a week with fast
teams is doubtful. Taking the Olym
pics only, then, for comparisons we
find that in three games Stanford has
tallied GO points; in four games Cali
fornia has scored 91. The average
per game is, 20 for Stanford and 23,
for the Blue and Gold. This seems to
give the latter Varsity an apparent ad
vantage. The merit of this method of
judging the two teams, must, however,
be left to individual taste.
For the fourth consecutive time G
Jenkinson, the experienced veteran
from Vancouver, will referee the great
game. .T. H. Lanagan, Stanford's for
mer football coach, will hold the flags
representing Stanford, while G. V.
Bell, a California athlete of some years
back, will represent, his alma mater as
a touch judge. The two brothers, E. .T.
Brown, U. C. '97, and I). E. Brown, S.
'97, are to hold the watche3 for the
tenth time in intercollegiate contests.
If the San Francisco sporting writ
ers are to be believed, the Cardinal
hopes of winning the great rugby
struggle tomorrow on California Field
are already laid out, embalmed and
putin the ground. They say that in
this twentieth contest between Stan
ford and California that the California
Varsity will make the total games won
in twenty years, six; while the Stan
ford boast is to stay at ten, with the
four tie struggles annexed by no one.
On neither campus, however, are hopes
so high among the undergraduates,
that no doubt can creep in. Califor
nia's Student Body of three thousand
think that their fifteen can carry off
a second successive victory by a safe
margin, while the Stanford backers,
not quite so certain, are maintaining
that all has not yet been said of their
team. There the opinions stand. At
2:30 tomorrow Referee G. Jenkinson's
whistle will sound the blast that,
about eighty minutes later will end
the game with the Cardinal colors in
supremacy or a pair of victories to
the Blue and Gold's credit. Last year,
California team broke a succession of
six straight defeats and a tie and
won from the Cardinal, 19-I.'? in a
game in which they were easily the
better fifteen.
From the very beginning, Stanford
has known what its work would have
to be in order to win, when it was
found that California had a string of
veterans prepared for the sacrifico,
whose number would be almost
enough to line-up two fifteens. But
Coach Presley started the long, grind
ing preliminary season with his accus
tomed energy and determination, and
it was apparent that it would take all
the veterans that California had in
her training house in order to win the
game. The two teams, one with four
teen veterans playing every game, and
the other, in the latter half of the sea

son, with four Freshmen and only six
veterans in the line-up, played game
after game with an equality of ability
that was unusual. The Stanford spirit
of developing splendid machines out of
almost raw material was at work.
Neither squad was handicapped by any
very great loss of players through in
juries. Now, in the last week of prep
aration, each has been weakened by
the absence from the announced line
up of a star back: Kern, of Stanford,
and Elliott, of California. But it is
thought that Elliott wil be able to
play. California has lost no other
men; Stanford has lost Schaupp, a
very promising forward who was mak
ing good. In injuries, therefore the
record of each team was a remarkably
clean one, and very equal.
Coach Presley was forced to devePbp
practically an entire back field ami
his efforts were notably successful.
He had little trouble in fitting the t\ct>-
Freshman team fives, Harrigan and
Reeves, into their positions and Geis
sler found his natural work at wing.
Mitchell went into center acceptably,
because of his superior power of
adaptability. It was difficult, however,
to fill the other wing. Thoburn was
placed there and the supporters of
the team depend upon him.
Glancing at the statistical table
Stanford proves to have a heavier
team by three pounds to the man in
cluding both backs and forwards. This
fact is in favor of the Cardinal team.
Scrum to scrum California outweighs
her opponents by about one pound to
a man, averaging eight men in the
Blue and Gold pack and seven in the
Cardinal. The total weight of the two
scrums, however, is 1488 for Califor
nia's eight men, and 1292 for Stan

back, will represent, his alma mater as
a touch judge. The two brothers, E. .T.
Brown, U. C. '97, and I). E. Brown, S.
'97, are to hold the watche3 for the
tenth time in intercollegiate contests.
If the San Francisco sporting writ
ers are to be believed, the Cardinal
hopes of winning the great rugby
struggle tomorrow on California Field
are already laid out, embalmed and
putin the ground. They say that in
this twentieth contest between Stan
ford and California that the California
Varsity will make the total games won
in twenty years, six; while the Stan
ford boast is to stay at ten, with the
four tie struggles annexed by no one.
On neither campus, however, are hopes
so high among the undergraduates,
that no doubt can creep in. Califor
nia's Student Body of three thousand
think that their fifteen can carry off
a second successive victory by a safe
margin, while the Stanford backers,
not quite so certain, are maintaining
that all has not yet been said of their
team. There the opinions stand. At
2:30 tomorrow Referee G. Jenkinson's
whistle will sound the blast that,
about eighty minutes later will end
the game with the Cardinal colors in
supremacy or a pair of victories to
the Blue and Gold's credit. Last year,
California team broke a succession of
six straight defeats and a tie and
won from the Cardinal, 19-I.'? in a
game in which they were easily the
better fifteen.
From the very beginning, Stanford
has known what its work would have
to be in order to win, when it was
found that California had a string of
veterans prepared for the sacrifico,
whose number would be almost
enough to line-up two fifteens. But
Coach Presley started the long, grind
ing preliminary season with his accus
tomed energy and determination, and
it was apparent that it would take all
the veterans that California had in
her training house in order to win the
game. The two teams, one with four
teen veterans playing every game, and
the other, in the latter half of the sea

son, with four Freshmen and only six
veterans in the line-up, played game
after game with an equality of ability
that was unusual. The Stanford spirit
of developing splendid machines out of
almost raw material was at work.
Neither squad was handicapped by any
very great loss of players through in
juries. Now, in the last week of prep
aration, each has been weakened by
the absence from the announced line
up of a star back: Kern, of Stanford,
and Elliott, of California. But it is
thought that Elliott wil be able to
play. California has lost no other
men; Stanford has lost Schaupp, a
very promising forward who was mak
ing good. In injuries, therefore the
record of each team was a remarkably
clean one, and very equal.
Coach Presley was forced to devePbp
practically an entire back field ami
his efforts were notably successful.
He had little trouble in fitting the t\ct>-
Freshman team fives, Harrigan and
Reeves, into their positions and Geis
sler found his natural work at wing.
Mitchell went into center acceptably,
because of his superior power of
adaptability. It was difficult, however,
to fill the other wing. Thoburn was
placed there and the supporters of
the team depend upon him.
Glancing at the statistical table
Stanford proves to have a heavier
team by three pounds to the man in
cluding both backs and forwards. This
fact is in favor of the Cardinal team.
Scrum to scrum California outweighs
her opponents by about one pound to
a man, averaging eight men in the
Blue and Gold pack and seven in the
Cardinal. The total weight of the two
scrums, however, is 1488 for Califor
nia's eight men, and 1292 for Stan
ford's seven players. The team from
across the bay will therefore have a
pushing advantage of 196 pounds.


Tlic 1910 Varsity Fifteen, Coach Presley and Substitutes.
In height the two fifteens are equal,
a coincidence that happened last year
in the Varsity contest. This year the
men average 5 feet, 10 inches. In age,
California averages one year older
than Stanford, this being accounted
for by reason of the greater number
of underclassmen on that team, there
being four Freshmen and two Sopho
mores.
A full list of the scores of all games
made by the two teams in the prelim
inary schedules will be found in an
other column. The thing to be under
lined most is the fact that California
has been scored upon twice with a
total of 15 points, by Barbarians and
Olympics. The Barbarian try, how
ever, was made against a substitute
full-back on the California team.
Dwiggins was not in. The Olympic's
ten points were made against the
complete Varsity, with the diminutive
Dwiggins in charge of the last de
fense. These tries made against Cal
ifornia, with none registered against
Stanford, seem to indicate that the
California defense is weakest, and the
evidence of the tallies cannot be
wholly disregarded. Again, how does
it happen that the Blue and Gold
rolled up against Nevada the largest
total on record on the Pacific Coast,
62, while the Cardinal were able to
mark up a meager 8 points? There
was a difference of two weeks between
the two games. California had the full
strength of the Varsity, absolutely, in
a final game before the championship:
Stanford on the contrary, was much
organized, and on foreign ground in a
different climate. The Blue "and Gold
had all conditions, of field, organiza
tion and weather in their favor. Al
though it may show that Stanford
lacked a little necessary fight at that
time, yet the two games cannot hardly
be put upon an equal footing. The
comparative scores made against the
Barbarians are not to be looked at too
closely, because, while the Olympic
Club always had a strong team, then
rival clubmen seldom brought any
where near the same fifteen on suc
cessive occasions. The fact that Cali
fornia has played nine games to Stan
ford's seven in the preliminary season
may have given the team more oppor
tunities to acquire confidence in one
another and, of course the value of the
additional practice cannot be under
estimated. And yet the advisibility of
having two games a week with fast
teams is doubtful. Taking the Olym
pics only, then, for comparisons we
find that in three games Stanford has
tallied GO points; in four games Cali
fornia has scored 91. The average
per game is, 20 for Stanford and 23,
for the Blue and Gold. This seems to
give the latter Varsity an apparent ad
vantage. The merit of this method of
judging the two teams, must, however,
be left to individual taste.
For the fourth consecutive time G
Jenkinson, the experienced veteran
from Vancouver, will referee the great
game. .T. H. Lanagan, Stanford's for
mer football coach, will hold the flags
representing Stanford, while G. V.
Bell, a California athlete of some years
back, will represent, his alma mater as
a touch judge. The two brothers, E. .T.
Brown, U. C. '97, and I). E. Brown, S.
