# CARDINAL ENTHUSIASM RUNS RIOT IN SPIRITED RALLY
## 
### 
With every seat filled and every
aisle and available space choked
with people three thousand or more
voices cheered continuously for
over twelve minutes when the
long line of the Cardinal fighters
making up the Stanford Varsity Rugby
Team, filed into the Assembly Hall
last night in one of the greatest rallies
ever held before an intercollegiate
game, and took their seats before the
whole audience. When the yell-lead
ers succeeded in quieting the uproar
skyrockets were given for the football
heroes tfiat will be remembered for
years to come. From the moment the
r£Fl-coated Stanford Band appeared on
the scene until the gigantic bonfire
after the rally had fallen into a glow
ing heap, there was not lacking for
one instant the spirit that believed in
the Cardinal team, and, that, win or
l<#se, they would be men to be proud
of. {
The women of the University had
' |
filled the gallery long before the time
for the rally, and as the Squad passed
down the aisle, with everyone in the
Lower part of the auditorium going
through a scene of wildest enthusiasm,
they shot long streamers of colored
paper«out over the whole pit.
Whpii pandemonium was over and
the assemblage had quieted down the
speakers of the evening were given a
chance to bring more cheers. The
speakers were Dr. Prank Angell, Pro
fessor E. W. Ponzer, E. A. Cunha, K.
L. Fenton, 'OS and Coach Presley. Tn
the first speech of the rally Dr. An
gell said: "One of the best things our
men learned on the Australian rugby
trip was that there were good fellows
on the other side of the bay, and I hope
that that belief will be in the game to
morrow. Our teams have been good
sportsmen from Vancouver to Los
Angeles, and it. has been due to George
Presley. The captain of the team has

done his duty and he stands as a gen
tleman of whom the students and fac
ulty are alike proud. His gentleman
liness does not consist in handing out
the game to the other team 011 a plat
ter!" Then, addressing the team, he
added: "Do what you can—win if you
can; lose if you must, but whatever
you do we shall always be proud of the
1910 Varsity Rugby Team, and of its
captain and of its coach."
Coach George Presley spoke as fol
lows: "California will have a veteran
team on Saturday. To beat that vet
eran team we have a team composed
mostly of men who meet Caifornia for
the first time. But it is the best-bal
anced rugby team that Stanford has
ever had.
"I feel certain that every man 011
that team is going to fight from the
moment the game starts until it is
over, and I am also certain that I am
going to be proud of that team and
that every member of the University 13
going to be proud of the team on Sat
urday."
Professor Ponzer told the rooters
that he wanted them to "understand
that a game may be won in the last
few moments, with the rooters sticking
to the last. Now for the team: we are
all with you and we wish you good
luck."
Said E. A. Cunha, 'OG, former Stu
dent Body president: "I have noted
that the Stanford fighting spirit is as
strong as ever and is even stronger
than ever. We face a situation similar
to the one before that great 12-5 game
—we had to face veterans at Califor
i nia, and we had only three veterans in
our line-up."
K. L. Fenton, '08, talked to rooters
and team as follows: "Now when you
go up to California you must win be
cause we lost last year, and because
this is George Presley's last, year here.
