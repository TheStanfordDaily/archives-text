The official and souvenir program for
t.he twentieth annual game of Inter
collegiate football between the Uni
versity of California and Stanford is
this year being compiled, arranged,
and published by the California Rally
committee, of which "Bob" Moulton is
chairman. This committee has been
materially assisted in the large task
by H. Rittigstein, '10, who has handled
all of the Stanford material in the big
book.
The program will contain a total of
38 pages of reading material and ad
vertisements and those who have seen,
advance copies of it declare it one of
the most unique evev published as a
souvenir of the greatest athletic event
on the Pacific Coast. An elaborate
cover of several colors graces the ex
terior, while the high grade engraving
and printing gives the interior a very
pleasing appearance. Some unusually
good pictures of the veterans of both
the Blue and Gold and Cardinal fif
teens will be seen, as well as some
unique pictures of the yell leaders. The
usual pictures of the coaches, th?
trainers, the graduate managers and
the captains will be included in the
program. All the "write ups" are
snappy and very readable.
Aside from this matter, will be
found all of the Stanford and Califor
nia yells and the new songs of each
university. A list of intercollegiate
struggles, together with the scores,
captains and managers is included to
gether with a brief but interesting
resume of rugby as it has been played
in America.
A total of 4000 copies have been run
off the press and will be sold on the
bleachers under the direction of A.
Sturtevant, California, '10, who has
charge of all the advertising in the
program.
