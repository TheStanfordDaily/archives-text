# Saturday's Result as Predicted by Experts of English Game
## WHAT WILL BACKS DO? CALIFORNIA BACKFIELD USES MORE TEAMWORK. Can Stanford Scoring: Division Develop Ability of Keeping Together? 
### J.C. THOMAS, '12 
The superiority of Stanford or Cal
ifornia rests with the backfieid possi
bilities of the two teams. It is team
work that will do the trick in the
game, and in a comparison of the two
Varsities it would appear that the
California backs have slightly the bet
ter of the bargain because of their
wider experience and knowledge of
their teammates' style of play. Man
for man the two sets of backs are
practically equal, with perhaps i
shade of advantage here or there. Erb
will outgeneral Morris at half and will
prove by far the better of the two
men. Harrigan can offset the Sopho
more Stroud. Elliott is faster than
Reeves, though not by a great deal.
Mitchell, however, can make up for
that in opposing the arrow-like Allen,
Mitchell having the greater weight for
defense and being more aggressive.
Geissler is undoubtedly the equal of
Peartt, and is looked to prove vastly
better than that rather eccentric play
er before the game is over. Thoburn
although it is admitted that he
is below Watts in quality, both be
cause of bis lack of experience in bis
position and because he is by no
means the fighter that the California
man is. Brown will make up for a
good deal. He is in every way super
ior to Dwiggins, and, moreover, he is
in top notch form. The knowledge
that his splendid kicking ability is al
ways behind them may serve to quick
en the defense of the Stanford backs.
He may turn the tide in many in
stances.
But we must look a little bit fearful
ly at the Cardinal backfieid. If they
prove the surprise of the day and more
than hold their own against the better
teamwork of California, it will not be
entirely unexpected, and will, we be
lieve, be the salvation of Stanford.
Although the California backs have
the power for offense and defense in
their favor, yet the scales do not tip
so far their way that the Stanford
team's undying capacity to fight can
not reverse that advantage.
There is much more margin' of
chance that the wing forward style of
play used by Coach Presley will do the
more execution, despite the fact that
California with an eight-man scrum
will probably secure the ball from
three-fourths of the scrum. Let Sun
dell be is aggressive as he is depended
Upon to be and there will be few pas
sing rushes originating from the
strife of the packs. Sundell as a free
lance can steal around that California
pack and ruin practically every pass
from Morris to Stroud, and that result
will give Stanford more opportunities
to get possession of the ball when the
ensuing free rucking takes place after
the smothering of the play. Our for
wards may do a little better than
merely equal the efforts of the Blue
and Gold rank and file, and there is a'
possibility of this.
The game therefore, should be one:
of (he most even'battles ever played
between the two universities, and
prophecies as to the result are of;
little practical use. Ag> matters stand
now, no one can say with even a rea
sonable degree of sureness what any
one of the uncertain factors on
side will do. There is no apparent
advantage. What degree of excellence
will be brought out in the men of the 1
respective teams in the crucible of a
championship game is as doubtful a
thing as could be found. In some years*
one team has shown a marked super
iority over the other, but at the close
of this season there has been no great
breaking down at any point on either,
side and the two fifteens are on 4
splendid par.
