# Saturday's Result as Predicted by Experts of English Game
## WHAT WILL BACKS DO? CALIFORNIA BACKFIELD USES MORE TEAMWORK. Can Stanford Scoring: Division Develop Ability of Keeping Together? 
### J.C. THOMAS, '12 
The superiority of Stanford or Cal
ifornia rests with the backfieid possi
bilities of the two teams. It is team
work that will do the trick in the
game, and in a comparison of the two
Varsities it would appear that the
California backs have slightly the bet
ter of the bargain because of their
wider experience and knowledge of
their teammates' style of play. Man
for man the two sets of backs are
practically equal, with perhaps i
shade of advantage here or there. Erb
will outgeneral Morris at half and will
prove by far the better of the two
men. Harrigan can offset the Sopho
more Stroud. Elliott is faster than
Reeves, though not by a great deal.
Mitchell, however, can make up for
that in opposing the arrow-like Allen,
Mitchell having the greater weight for
defense and being more aggressive.
Geissler is undoubtedly the equal of
Peartt, and is looked to prove vastly
better than that rather eccentric play
er before the game is over. Thoburn
although it is admitted that he
is below Watts in quality, both be
cause of bis lack of experience in bis
position and because he is by no
means the fighter that the California
man is. Brown will make up for a
good deal. He is in every way super
ior to Dwiggins, and, moreover, he is
in top notch form. The knowledge
that his splendid kicking ability is al
ways behind them may serve to quick
en the defense of the Stanford backs.
He may turn the tide in many in
stances.
But we must look a little bit fearful
ly at the Cardinal backfieid. If they
prove the surprise of the day and more
than hold their own against the better
teamwork of California, it will not be
entirely unexpected, and will, we be
lieve, be the salvation of Stanford.
