# CONTRASTS FIFTEENS
## W.P. FULLER EXPLAINS DIFFERENCE IN TEAMS. Stanford Varsity Will Either Spring Surprise or be Afflicted With Stage Fright. W.P. FULLER, JR. 
### 
After the intercollegiate game of a
year ago Stanford's prospects for a
winning fifteen this season were most
discouraging. Her chances have
gradually brightened, however, and
now the Cardinal supporters may
rightfuly be more hopeful than at any
time during the past twelve months.
Not that Stanford has an even break
—for, in the writer's opinion, Califor
nia's outlook is the more cheerful—
but Stanford's prospects for victory to
morrow are better today than at the
opening of or during the season.
On September 1 the greater portion
of the Blue and Gold fifteen might
have been accurately predicted. The
line-up seemed neither more nor less
strong.than it does now. A large
number of the men were veterans
whose prowess was well known. No
one doubted that the Californians
would have an aggressive and unified
pack and a backfieid almost, if not
absolutely, irresistable on attack.
On the other hand, who knew much
about the Stanford team as early as
Septemberl ? Nobody. Not even
Coach Presley. A possible Varsity
line-up forcasted then would not now
be recognized. The Freshman, Soph
omore and Junior classes all combined
to furnish such valuable material that
not only were the apparent vacancies
filled, but a number of veterans soon
found themselves entangled in a losing
fight for a position on the team. Con
sequently, the men on tlie Varsity
have had to work their hardest even
afternoon of the season to retain their
places, and this is the most hopeful
fact about the Cardinal fifteen. For
just as too many veterans, all practi
cally sure of making the team, were
the chief reason for Stanford's defeat
in 1909. so may an exactly contrary
state of affairs bring the opposite re-
suit tomorrow. The writer does not
hesitate to declare that Stanford's
1910 team of rather inexperienced
youngsters will be harder to conquer
than Stanford's 1909 team of very e?c
perienced veterans. But they will have
to be far, far better before California
is defeated, for the Blue and Gold
fifteen Is much stronger than it was u
year ago. California's veterans have
had the advantage of another season
together, while the new material this
fall was strong and plentiful.
To forecast the probable result with
any degree of assurance is even more
difficult than might have been expect
ed, as the true ability of the Cardinal
players when under real fire has
never been demonstrated. Further
more, Stanford has the sort of team
which often springs a surprise when
put to the test; also, the sort which
sometimes gets stage-fright.
When all is said, it must be conceded
that Caifornia figures the winner.
Still, both teams should score, and (he
victors will probably be credited with
no large number of points.
The Cardinals have a tough proposi
tion on their hands. However, in 1903
they had a far tougher proposition to
face in Overall's veteran eleven, and
yet they tied the game 6 to 6. So let
us hope for the best tomorrow.
