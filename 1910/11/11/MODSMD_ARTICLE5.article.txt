# SEES CALIFORNIA WIN
## CHRONICLE SPORTING WHITER PICKS CHAMPIONS. "Bobs" Selects Blue and Gold "All Back" Team as Victors Tomorrow. 
### "BOBS 
Twenty thousand excited spectators
will be on hand at California Field
tomorrow to witness the twentieth an
nual football struggle between the
elite fifteen of California and Stan
ford. Ten times has the Cardinal
been returned victorious in these all
important events, while the Blue and
Gold has secured the spoils on five oc
casions. The rival coaches have fin
ished the work of preparing the teams
for the battle and it is the general
consensus of opinion that both of them
has made the most of the material
at his command.
The California team is in every
sense of the word a veteran team as
fourteen of the fifteen players have
participated in at least one varsity
struggle in the past. Coach Presley
started the training season with a
real "awkward squad," as with very
few exceptions the material at hand
had very little experience of the rugby
game and the result of his labors is
most commendable, as the Cardinal
team is well up to the standard of
former Stanford teams.
Whatever the result of
battle, it is generally conceded that
with average ground and weather con
ditions, the class of rugby played by
the two varsities will be bettor than
has been exhibited in any game on the
Pacific Coast. Both teams are very
clever in attack and it will be no sur
prise if the largest score ever record
ed in these games is amassed during
the eighty minutes of play. In the
preliminary games despite the changes
made from time to time by the coaches
in the varsity line-ups the scores made
against the local club teams have
reached enormous proportions.
Unfortunate injuries at the eleventh
hour has removed one sensational
player from each team, Gene Kern
having fallen by the wayside in the
Olympic game last Saturday, and
Amos Elliott rendered liors de combat
against Nevada varsity on the same
date. Whether the latter will be able
to take some part in the game is still
a matter of doubt but there are hopes
that he will be able to do so.
The California backs have been
working in clocklike unison all the
season and their dazzling rushes have
proved the undoing of every defense
opposed to them this season. The loss
of Elliott would, however, prove a
severe handicap to them as this player
occupies the crucial position of at
tack and it is hard to estimate how
the back field will work without him
as initiator. The Blue and Gold tower
of strength, however, lies in the for
ward division, as their prowess in the
open has led many people to style
them the "team of all backs." This is
no idle compliment as thescrummagers
have shown an ability to. handle the
ball cleverly and expeditiously in
passing rallies and from cross kicks,
and most of the scoring this season
has been done by the advance guard.
As an individual star "diet" Allen
may be singled out as one of the
greatest players ever developed on the
Coast and this popular-back will sure
ly be one of the most important fact
ors in the big game tomorrow.
The presence of so many freshmen
is one of the features in the make up
of the Stanford team and if these
babies maintain the high standard of
ball set by them in the preliminary
games, there will surely be a hot ar
gument for supremacy. The history
of varsity contests, however, shows
that freshman material while brilliant
in practice rarely maintains the same
keenness when under fire in varsity
struggles. That each of the quartet is
equal to performing great feats is
evident to those who have seen them
in the preliminary games and every
Cardinal rooter is pulling for them to
make good from the jump tomorrow.
In summing up, I think the game
will be one of those rugby exhibitions
that will rouse the spectators to a
high pitch of enthusiasm and that
Referee Jenkinson will have no
trouble in handling the players as a
clean contest may be expected. Cross
kicks, which tend to open up tin 1 game
will be a feature and the play will,
unless rain prevent?, be open from
start to finish. I thin a there will be
scoring galore, as the attack on Doth
sides is superior to the defense and 1
expect to see the Blue and Gold
hailed victorious when the final
whistle is blown. The advantage of
home ground will cut snne figure,
veteran material some more, and the
record of the two teams during the
season must be also taken into «;c
count. May the best team win aid

promises to be.

the eighty minutes of play. In the
preliminary games despite the changes
made from time to time by the coaches
in the varsity line-ups the scores made
against the local club teams have
reached enormous proportions.
Unfortunate injuries at the eleventh
hour has removed one sensational
player from each team, Gene Kern
having fallen by the wayside in the
Olympic game last Saturday, and
Amos Elliott rendered liors de combat
against Nevada varsity on the same
date. Whether the latter will be able
to take some part in the game is still
a matter of doubt but there are hopes
that he will be able to do so.
The California backs have been
working in clocklike unison all the
season and their dazzling rushes have
proved the undoing of every defense
opposed to them this season. The loss
of Elliott would, however, prove a
severe handicap to them as this player
occupies the crucial position of at
tack and it is hard to estimate how
the back field will work without him
as initiator. The Blue and Gold tower
of strength, however, lies in the for
ward division, as their prowess in the
open has led many people to style
them the "team of all backs." This is
no idle compliment as thescrummagers
have shown an ability to. handle the
ball cleverly and expeditiously in
passing rallies and from cross kicks,
and most of the scoring this season
has been done by the advance guard.
As an individual star "diet" Allen
may be singled out as one of the
greatest players ever developed on the
Coast and this popular-back will sure
ly be one of the most important fact
ors in the big game tomorrow.
The presence of so many freshmen
is one of the features in the make up
of the Stanford team and if these
babies maintain the high standard of
ball set by them in the preliminary
games, there will surely be a hot ar
gument for supremacy. The history
of varsity contests, however, shows
that freshman material while brilliant
in practice rarely maintains the same
keenness when under fire in varsity
struggles. That each of the quartet is
equal to performing great feats is
evident to those who have seen them
in the preliminary games and every
Cardinal rooter is pulling for them to
make good from the jump tomorrow.
In summing up, I think the game
will be one of those rugby exhibitions
that will rouse the spectators to a
high pitch of enthusiasm and that
Referee Jenkinson will have no
trouble in handling the players as a
clean contest may be expected. Cross
kicks, which tend to open up tin 1 game
will be a feature and the play will,
unless rain prevent?, be open from
start to finish. I thin a there will be
scoring galore, as the attack on Doth
sides is superior to the defense and 1
expect to see the Blue and Gold
hailed victorious when the final
whistle is blown. The advantage of
home ground will cut snne figure,
veteran material some more, and the
record of the two teams during the
season must be also taken into «;c
count. May the best team win aid
may the exhibition be everything it
promises to be.
Twenty thousand excited spectators
will be on hand at California Field
tomorrow to witness the twentieth an
nual football struggle between the
elite fifteen of California and Stan
ford. Ten times has the Cardinal
been returned victorious in these all
important events, while the Blue and
Gold has secured the spoils on five oc
casions. The rival coaches have fin
ished the work of preparing the teams
for the battle and it is the general
consensus of opinion that both of them
has made the most of the material
at his command.
The California team is in every
sense of the word a veteran team as
fourteen of the fifteen players have
participated in at least one varsity
struggle in the past. Coach Presley
started the training season with a
real "awkward squad," as with very
few exceptions the material at hand
had very little experience of the rugby
game and the result of his labors is
most commendable, as the Cardinal
team is well up to the standard of
former Stanford teams.
Whatever the result of
battle, it is generally conceded that
with average ground and weather con
ditions, the class of rugby played by
the two varsities will be bettor than
has been exhibited in any game on the
Pacific Coast. Both teams are very
clever in attack and it will be no sur
prise if the largest score ever record
ed in these games is amassed during
the eighty minutes of play. In the
preliminary games despite the changes
made from time to time by the coaches
in the varsity line-ups the scores made
against the local club teams have
