# SEES CALIFORNIA WIN
## CHRONICLE SPORTING WHITER PICKS CHAMPIONS. "Bobs" Selects Blue and Gold "All Back" Team as Victors Tomorrow. 
### "BOBS 
Twenty thousand excited spectators
will be on hand at California Field
tomorrow to witness the twentieth an
nual football struggle between the
elite fifteen of California and Stan
ford. Ten times has the Cardinal
been returned victorious in these all
important events, while the Blue and
Gold has secured the spoils on five oc
casions. The rival coaches have fin
ished the work of preparing the teams
for the battle and it is the general
consensus of opinion that both of them
has made the most of the material
at his command.
The California team is in every
sense of the word a veteran team as
fourteen of the fifteen players have
participated in at least one varsity
struggle in the past. Coach Presley
started the training season with a
real "awkward squad," as with very
few exceptions the material at hand
had very little experience of the rugby
game and the result of his labors is
most commendable, as the Cardinal
team is well up to the standard of
former Stanford teams.
Whatever the result of
battle, it is generally conceded that
with average ground and weather con
ditions, the class of rugby played by
the two varsities will be bettor than
has been exhibited in any game on the
Pacific Coast. Both teams are very
clever in attack and it will be no sur
prise if the largest score ever record
ed in these games is amassed during
the eighty minutes of play. In the
preliminary games despite the changes
made from time to time by the coaches
in the varsity line-ups the scores made
against the local club teams have
reached enormous proportions.
Unfortunate injuries at the eleventh
hour has removed one sensational
player from each team, Gene Kern
