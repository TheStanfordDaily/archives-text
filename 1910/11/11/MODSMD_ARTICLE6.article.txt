# BACKFIELD SUPERIOR
## CALIFORNIA EXPECTS VICTORY BY SMALL MARGIN. Admit Our Superiority in the Scrum, but Believe their Backfield Will Win Struggle. H.C. McCLELLAND, '13. 
### 
California is prepared to send into
the field next Saturday a Varsity,
which is in every way capable of put
tins up a wonderful fight, and the
Blue and Gold supporters look to see
this team win. Knowing well the met
tle of the men whom they are to oppose,
they do not overlook for a minute
the ability of the Cardinal Varsity, but
everyone, except those too prejudiced
by the loyalty to his colors, expects it
to be close struggle. It would seem
that California is better than Stanford
by about two trys, and even the most
enthusiastic do not look for a victory
by a much larger margin.
Those who pick the Blue and Gold,
base their choice upon the contention
that, admitting that Stanford has a
slight advantage in the scrum, and
those who have seen both packs in
action must admit that the advantage
is but slight, the wonderful develop
ment of the California back field will
more than offset this advantage and
leave a balance in favor of the Blue
and Gold.
Under the careful guidance of
Coaches Schaeffer and Cerf there has
been instilled in the men a spirit of
determination and fight â€” that same
spirit that won for California last year.
Those who have seen the men in ac
tion are struck by the way in which
they keep on the ball and follow the
play. They have learned this funda
mental principal of rugby and learned
it well. The veteran scrum which will
wear the Varsity stripes in the big
game is composed of players who re
ceived their baptism of fire in former
intercollegiate contests and have dem
onstrated their ability. They are fight
ers every one, and what they lack in
weight they more than make up in
aggressiveness and knowledge of the
game.
