# Cardinal Varsity Fights Gamely but Superior Team Work Wins
## 
### 
Coach George J. Presley.—"We
had a good team of fighters and a
good team to tight against. Our
team fought hard all the way."
Coach Schaeffer. —"All the boys
played great ball. It was a won
derful exhibition by both teams.
The playing of the California
backs won the day."

Fourteen veterans and their ability
to constantly follow the ball were too
much for the Stanford Varsity last
Saturday afternoon, and the second
successive victory in rugby went to
California by the score of 25-6.
Neither luck nor weather conditions
were in the outcome of the contest.
The game was straightforward and the
day perfect. The struggle was won by
the better team. There were heroes
on both sides, and of the scrum heroes
there were sixteen. Every one of the
forwards on both varsities played for
all there was in him, and the battle
between these two divisions of the
teams was a magnificent sight. The
Stanford backfield, however, was un
able to get their teamwork into effec
tive operation. The ball seldom or
never went beyond the second five, and
not once did it reach the wing in a
pasing succession down the line of
four backs. Individually, the Cardinal
backs were fearless and full of fight,
but they had not been in combination
long enough to carry out a complete

passing rush. Their defense was, on
the average, good. In the case of
California, on the contrary, the ball
often went the entire round of the
backfield, from first to wing, and all
had a chance to advance the play a
few yards. It is true there were not
many rushes inaugurated by the Cali
fornia half to his first five, for the
reason that the Stanford pack heeled
out the ball through a clean lane in
practically every scrum. But this was
accounted for either by the superior
amount of fight and push in the Cardi
nal pack, or by the policy used by
Coach Schaeffer to give the ball to
Stanford and then smother the at
tempted play by means of the swift
Blue and Gold breakaway men, Harris
and Swartz. It had been thought be
fore the game that the California pack
would secure the oval from a great
majority of the scrums, and that the
Cardinal wing forward, Sundell, would
stop the play at the half back. The
situation was completely reversed.
Stanford secured the leather invariab
ly and the combined attack of Harris
and Swartz worked to perfection. Few
passes left the hands of the Stanford
half, Erb. For that reason the Cardi
nal backs had little opportunity to
show their teamwork in a passing
rush. When the chance was given
them they did not succeed in advanc
ing far. The Stanford wings, except
when play placed them on the blind
side or in defense, were of little use.
Tn defense, however, they did their
duty, as did all the Cardinal backs, in
dividually, and, all credit to them, they
did not weaken at the whirlwind on
slaught of California. S. Mitchell and
Geissler starred in defense against the
Blue and Gold onrushes, and broke up
many a beautiful rally. Thoburn on
the other wing saved many times by
long touch kicks, but could not hold
back Peartt.
The injury of Elliott, which reports
from the California camp had said
would keep him off the field, was ap
parently the most gigantic myth ever
kept out of a fairy book. Elliott not
only played, but he played a game that
was as far removed from that of an
injured man as could be conceived.
He was the star of the entire thirty
men on the field, for his work in the
backfield was better in its department
than the work of any of the star for
wards in their own department of the
game. He made one point over half
of California's total score. This bril
llant, bat injured player tallied one try
single-handed, aided directly in the
scoring of three others, and converted
all five of the Blue and Gold's tallies.
He was in practically every play, and
was hammered continually in defense
and offense, and yet time was not
taken out for him in a single instance.
And yet. it was doubtful that he would
play, even up to the last moment.
Evans, his fellow team mate, was an
nounced in the final, big line-up, and
the name of Elliott did not appear in
any paper, program, or other printed
matter before the contest.

When, in a way exactly similar to
last year's championship struggle, the
Stanford team scored two tries within
ten minutes of the opening of the first
half, it seemed that the powers of the
two teams had been wrongly esti
mated. But the scores were made so
easily that it was apparent that the
California team was suffering from
stage fright, while Stanford was not.
Arrell played across for the first try,
while Erb, aided by Reeves and Har
rigan, scored the second. Later in the
half, the Blue and Gold duplicated the
ease with which the Cardinal had tal
lied, when Stroud marked up three
points. With the two successive tries
of Harris and Allen, it was seen that
the better team was piling up the
points and that the fears of the Car
dinal were being realized. The first
period ended, 15-6. The margin of
advantage would not have been so
marked had the Stanford tries been
converted as were California's. Dole
in both cases had extremely acute
angles from which to put the ball be
tween the posts, and success would
have been highly creditable to him.
The superiority of the Blue and Gold
was further accentuated, though not
with any ease or evidence of weaken
ing on the part of Stanford, in the
second half. Elliott secured another
try, and Harris, also single-handed,
finished the total by a pretty run
across the line.
The two captains, Dole and Dwig
gins, fought hard and with no stop, the
one to stem the tide of defeat, the
other to keep victory in the grasp of
his team. Dole was the best man of
the sixteen forwards, although he was
sensational. Harris was a close sec
ond for the honors of the packs. The
Stanford player overode every for
ward in the line-outs and in three
quarters of these struggles for the
ball he secured and passed to his
backs. In the loose, lie was on a par
with any, and, although this was Har
ris' main strength, the two were equal
here. Man for man the forwards of
the two teams were men to be proud
01'... Swartz was a wonder as was
alsfVMarkwart. But the fight shown
by Frank, of Stanford, was surpass
ing. The smallest player of either
scrum by many pounds in weight, and
by several inches in height, he never
theless downed opponents almost
twice his size. Tn the two packs the
two extremes were exemplified—the
huge Jordan and the diminutive
Frank; the former heavier than the
latter by nearly a hundred pounds.
And yet, contrasting what each ac
complished Saturday, Frank was the
better of the two. Jordan did not come
up to his reputation.
It must be admitted that Brown did
not equal Dwiggins in the first half,
but he so outdid himself in the second
period that, he surpassed anything that
the California Captain had been able
to do. Brown had perhaps as great
a strain of defense on his shoulders as
any Stanford fullback has ever had to
bear, and this allowance must be made

Captain Pole.—"Every man on
the team did his best and we have
iio cause to be ashamed. .On the
contrary, 1 am proud of the team.
They outplayed us, that's all."
Captain Pwiggins.—"Everybody
played up to scratch. The won
derful cooperation of the whole
team gave us a hard fought
game."

in looking at his work in the opening
forty minutes. He never failed during
the whole game to get his kick ont of
the way before being tackled and in
the last half, these kicks were marvel
ous, but were puny in the first.
California used three substitutes, the
limit allowed: Dills for Watts, Evans
for Peart, and Wheeler for Swartz.
Coahc Presley sent in only one relief
player, Smith taking Frank's place in
the last mintues of the game.
