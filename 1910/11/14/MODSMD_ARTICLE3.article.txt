The Cardinal Varsity went down to
defeat in the twentieth annual foot
ball struggle last Saturday, but the
Blue and Gold victory does not in any
manner disturb our loyalty to and
high estimation of the Stanford team.
Every man upon the team put his best
into the struggle and that is all we
can ask from them. At the same time
every player who wore the Cardinal
was true to Stanford athletic tradi
tions and fought a clean, sportsman
like game throughout the entire eighty
minutes of play. Every Stanford man
is proud of the team and of the coach
who gave his best efforts in training
the squad and the mere fact that they
were overcome by a superior team
does not in the least destroy our pride
and allegiance to these men who have
so ably and efficiently represented the
Cardinal.
