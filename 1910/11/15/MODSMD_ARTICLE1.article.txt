# CONTEMPLATE POST SEASON SCHEDULE OF RUGBY.
## Organizations to Send Representatives to Executive Committee Meeting Tomorrow Evening. 
### 
A post-season rugby series will
while away the time until the Christ
mas holidays, if the plan advanced by
the Executive Committee is favorably
received by the fraternities and other
campus organizations. It is proposed
to organize an association which will
take charge of the matter and arrange
a schedule for the various teams en
tered. The great number of post sea
sou games that have been played dur
ing the past few years attest the
marvelous popularity of rugby, and
makes such a move towards the or
ganization of the sport highly desir
able.
In the past, it has been difficult to
plan such a series of games owing to
the fact that the eating clubs pos
sessed often more than double the
number of men that any of the frater
nities could muster. This disparity in
material made the fraternities reluct
ant to schedule games with such,
teams as the "Coyotes" or the "Break
ers" could put forth. To eliminate
this difficulty, it is planned to arrange
the fraternities in groups of twos or
threes so that strong teams can be
developed from each group.
A meeting of the Executive commit
tee will be held tomorrow night at
7:30, to which the fraternities and eat
ing clubs are invited to send repre
sentatives to consider the matter. Tim
Executive Committee is merely taking
the initiative in the forming of the as
sociation, for, as soon as a tentative
running plan is adopted, the rugby
league will become self-governing.
If the proposed scheme is well re
ceived by the students it is intended
that the games should begin at once'
and be played off rapidly so that the
championship of the University would
be decided some time before examina
tion week.
