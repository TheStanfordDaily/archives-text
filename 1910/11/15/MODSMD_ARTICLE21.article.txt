# NEW INSTRUCTOR TO SPEAK BEFORE FRENCH STUDENTS.
## Professor Guerard to Give Address at Sigma Chi House Next Thursday Evening. 
### 
The French Club has completed ar
rangements for a lecture under its
auspices by Professor C. A. Guerard,
the new instructor in the Department
of Romanic Languages. The address
will be given in the Sigma Chi house
on Thursday, November 17, and an in
vitation to attend is extended to
interested. Although Professor Guer
ard will talk entirely in French, the
members of the club feel that they will
be well repaid for any extra effort
which may be necessary to understand
him, as the talk promises to be ex
ceptionally interesting. During Pro
fessor Guerard's extensive travels in
France he has met with many inter
esting experiences which he will re
count at this meeting.
