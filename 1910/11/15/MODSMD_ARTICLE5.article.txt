# SECRETARY OF TRUST COMMENTS ON GAME
## English Professor Gives Credit to Western Athletic Spirit Over Eastern Attitude. 
### 
An interested spectator at Satur
day's game was an old Oxford gradu
ate, Dr. G. R. Parkin, secretary of the
Rhodes Trust and when seen after
the game, said: "It was the cleanest
game that I have seen in America and
at the same time the most satisfying.
The big games in the east that I have
witnessed are too dangerous, there is
too much of the amphitheatre spirit
in them which is a great danger to
college spirit.
"Saturday's game reproduced more
the true spirit of sports as we under
stand it in England and I did not find
this to be the case in the games be
tween your big eastern universities.
The organized rooting of the two uni
versities was extremely interesting to
me, as in our games in England we
have no organized encouragement of
the teams. You seem to have caught
the Greek idea of the spectacular.
"There could not have been better
spirit shown among the players. In
such an open game there are many
opportunities for slugging but I saw
none and I was delighted with the con
test.
"It would be a mighty fine thing for
all America, if they should adopt the
game of rugby. If the young college
man gets the true rugby spirit of fair
play when at college, he will carry it
out into the world with him and it
will effect the national character."
