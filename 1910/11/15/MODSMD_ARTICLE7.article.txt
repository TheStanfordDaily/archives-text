# TRI-STATE ORGANIZATION IS FORMALLY COMPLETED
## University of Washington Accepts Invitation to Debate With Oregon and Stanford. 
### 
By the acceptance of the University
of Washington of the invitation offered
to her to join the Tri-State debating
league, that debating organization is
now formally organized. The accept
anca of the northern university has
just been received by the Inter-society
Debating League and as the Faculty
Committee 011 Literary Contests has
already given its sanction to the
league, nothing now remains but for
Stanford, Oregon and Washington to
draw up the final rules and regula
tions governing the intercollegiate de
bates. As soon as this is done the
league will be an active force in foren
sic work on the Pacific Coast.
As a result of the formation of the
new league, next semester will un
doubtedly witness the busiest debating
season in the history of this institu
tion. A total of four intercollegiate
contests will be held besides the regu
lar work of Nestoria and Euphronia
Literary Societies. After next semes
ter, however, the Tri-League debates
will probably be held in the fall sem
ester, thus leaving more time for the
preparation of the annual Carnot and
Intercollegiate debates with the Uni
versity of California. This will more
evenly divide the work and allow the
speakers to do greater justice to these
contests.
The exact time for the Oregon-Wash
ington debates has not been fully de
cided upon, but they will probably be
held the last week in March. Stanford
will chose two teams, one to meet the
visiting team and one to journey north.
Both debates will be held the same
evening and the championship of the
coast will thus be settled in short
order. Two, instead of three speakers,
will comprise the teams as has always
been the custom in the California con
tests. Each speaker will be allowed to
speak longer than heretofore, how
ever, twenty minutes being allotted for
each arguer besides five minutes re
buttal.
Under the new arrangements, it will
now be possible for ten men to win
varsity debating honors. It is ex
pected that these new opportunities
will do much toward advancing for
ensic work at Stanford, in fact, it Is
doubtful when all the various contests
fostered are taken in consideration,
that any other western university at
least, can offer the advantages and the
practice in public speaking afforded
at Stanford. Each semester will be
crowded with as many contests as
those who have already shown their
ability can well take care of, but those
who have promoted literary activity
are in hopes that the new program will
encourage many to engage in active
forensic work.
The Executive Committee of the As
sociated Students has put its stamp o*
approval 011 the new venture by vot
ing $li>o a year traveling expenses to
the Stanford teams. The first sugges
tion of the formation of the league was
received favorably by it as it is
thought that not only will the in
creased work benefit the debaters per
sonally, but will be invaluable to the

development, of men of sufficient cali
bre to vanquish the Rlue and Gold in
the annual Carnot and intercollegiate
debates.
