# GRAND CONCERT WILL BE GIVEN DURING JANUARY.
## Oratorio Society Plans to Have Noted Artist Appear in Next Semester's Program. 
### 
A grand concert given by the Ora
torio Society will be one of the first
features to be presented in the As
sembly Hall next semester. Not only
will all the prominent musicians of
the society take part in the program,
but it is planned to have some noted
artist enrich the evening's entertain
ment. The exact date of the produc
tion has not as yet been decided upon,
but they state that it will be given dur
ing the last week in January.
The society gave an elaborate mus
ical festival two years ago, but as it
did not receive the support it deserved,
a deficit of some $500 was the net re
sult. A well filled Assembly Hall at
the society's concert in January will
wipe out this deficit and pave the way
for more musical activities at Stanford.
Should January's musical treat be a
success financially, the Oratorio So
ciety will plan another evening of
music during the following spring.
This will be given in connection with
a concert by the Russian Symphony
Orchestra, which is now making a suc
cessful tour of the United States, and
will be in California at that time. The
Stanford musical organization has
been able to get the manager of the
Russian Symphony Orchestra to hold
open a date, which will be accepted or
cancelled according to the success of
the society's last-of-January program.
The society will resume rehearsals
this week to prepare for their next
semester's porgram, the first being
held on Thursday evening at 7:30
o'clock in room 68. All the old mem
bers of the organization are urged to
be present at this first rehearsal and
all who are interested in the work of
the society are earnestly requested to
be present at this time and affiliate.
