# PLANS AN INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY FOR FAR EAST.
## Leslie Johnston Here in World Wide Attempt to Secure Higher Education for Celestials. 
### 
To secure the backing of the faculty
of Stanford University in the estab
lishment of a university in China,
which will be supported by nearly all
the great universities of the world,
was the purpose of a visit to the camp
us yesterday afternoon of Leslie
Johnston, fellow and tutor of Magda
lene College, Oxford. Johnston had
just arrived from China where he has
been investigating educational in
stitutions and he said that there were
none there which had the standing of
a university. Such an institution is
sadly needed in a country containing
a population of over four hundred
million?.
A discussion between the faculties of
Oxford and Cambridge over affairs in
the Far East led to the conceiving of
this idea of founding an international
university in the Celestial kingdom.
With this project in view Lord William
Cecil was sent to China to investigate
matters there.
The university will be built about
six hundred miles up the Yan Tse
River in the Wu-Han towns. The first
buildings will be started in about five
years. These first constructed will
be for recitation purposes, the stu
dents making their quarters in the
town. About two years previous to
the beginning of building operations
the professors will be sent to China to
learn the Chinese language.
Interest in this undertaking prom
ises to be of a world wide scope. As
sociations have already been formed
at Harvard and Columbia. Invitations
have been received from the German
universities to send representatives
there to discuss the plans and as the
German universities are under state
control, this means the sanction of the
government.
A committee from the faculty of
Stanford and California will probably
be selected to have charge of the work
on the Pacific Coast. The establish
ment of a great university in Chin",
would have much to do in helping to
solve the Mongolian question, now of
such vital importance to the Pacific
Coast.
