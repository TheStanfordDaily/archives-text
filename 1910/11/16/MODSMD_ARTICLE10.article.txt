Requests have been made by the
Sophomore Cotillion Committee that
the patrons of that particular dance
refrain from the use of carriages in
going to and from the function and
that no flowers be made evident at the
Armory upon the evening of December
3. This is a laudable effort upon the
part of the committee that has the
dance in charge. The Sophomore an
nual dance was originally a very in
formal social event, but in the past few
years it lias developed into a:i elabor
ate and expensive function, conducted
on plans far beyond the character of
the lirst event of that nature. It is to
be hoped that over-zealous gallants
will acquiesce in the wishes of the
Sophomore board and that a second
Junior Prom will net bo instituted.
