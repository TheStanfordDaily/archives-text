# ENGLISH PROFESSOR VIEWS INTERCOLLEGIATE STRUGGLE.
## Is Surprised at Progress British Game Has Made in America. 
### 
Le3lie Johnston, fellow and tutor of
Magdalene College, Oxford, was a
spectator at Saturday's game in Ber
keley and was highly pleased with (he
exhibition of rugby which he saw.
Me described it as a "keen and hearty"
game and that the spirit of the con
test could not be beaten even in Eng
land. He said he was very much sur
prised to hear that rugby was played
at all in the United States and on top
of that to see such a game as that of
Saturday's was almost unbelievable.
He thought, however, that the best
teams of England would be able to
beat either of the teams, but that for
the short time that rugby had been
played here the Americans had made
a wonderful progress in the science of
rugby.
