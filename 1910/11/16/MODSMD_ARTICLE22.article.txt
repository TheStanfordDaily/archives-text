# SEVEN TEAMS ENTER DOUBLES TOURNAMENT.
## Only a Few Teams Will Contest for University Tennis Championship. 
### 
Only seven teams are entered in the
annual inter-class doubles tournament
that is to he played this week. The
Seniors and Freshmen have only one
team each and there are two and three
entered from 1912 and 1913, respec
tively. The small entry list is prob
ably due to the almost apparent out
come in each case. 1911 has no pair
who can class with Mann and Talboy
and in a Freshman tournament Daw
son and Cawston would win easily.
Grace and Morgan will probably rep
resent the Juniors and Douglass and
Murray the Sophomores, but both
teams will have strong competition.
As to the probable winner of the
tournament it is hard to judge, but one
of the three lower classes will probab
ly capture the championship.
With the strong team entered and
only a few matches to be played every
contest should be of interest to all
devotees of tennis.
The drawings are as follows:
1911 —Mann and Talboy.
1912 —Grace and Morgan vs. Geary
and Kennedy.
1913 —Pratt and Hanawalt vs. Doug
lass and Murray; Fyfe and Shaul,
(bye).
1914—Dawson and Cawston.
