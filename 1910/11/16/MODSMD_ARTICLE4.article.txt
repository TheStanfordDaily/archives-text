# STUDENT ADVISOR A.E. ROTH TELLS OF AUSTRALIAN TRIP
## Member of All-American University Rugby Aggregation Gives Interesting Account of Summer Voyage. 
### 
Student Advisor Roth gave an il
lustrated talk last evening in Assem
bly Hall to a fair sized audience 011 the
tour of the All-American Rugby Team
through the Antipodes last summer.
This aggregation was composed of ten
men from Stanford, eleven from the

University of California and two from
the University of Nevada. The ex
penses of the trip were borne by the
Rugby Unions of New Zealand and
New South Wales.
The team sailed from Vancouver on
May 21 and according to Roth their
main diversion for their three weeks

of ocean voyage was the eating of
seven meals a day. After Honolulu,
the first stop was at Fanning Island
where a cable station is maintained.
The next port touched was Suva,
principal city of the Fiji Islands of
which interesting pictures were shown
portraying the various classes of na
tives and the Hindus imported to work
upon the plantations.
Brisbane was the first Australian
city visited, but little of interest was
seen there. Sidney, however, made a
deep impression with its magnificent
harbor and beautiful parks. The team
was everywhere received with the
greatest hospitality. They were more
over treated as representatives of
another nation and at each city were
given a public reception at the town
hall by the mayor.
"The attendance at the games was
a revelation to the visitors," said the
lecturer, "there being a total of 96,-
000 paid admissions at two games held
in one day in one of the towns. The
interest taken in rugby throughout
the Antipodes is very great. They be
gin to play the game in the grammar
schools and continue even after gradu
ation from college." The fact that
most of the teams which the Ameri
cans met were composed of such vet
erans of the game accounts for the
few victories won by the visitors.
The team was fortunate enough to
travel the full length of New Zealand
and made a most interesting trip to
Lake Rotorua on whose shores are
geysers and boiling springs. Roth
showed many pictures of the wonder
ful natural phenomena of this region.
After leaving New Zealand the team
had an uneventful voyage home save
for the stop at Honolulu where they
were entertained by'S. C. Kennedy, '12,
and W. C. Achi, '12,
