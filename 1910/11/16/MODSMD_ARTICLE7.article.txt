reports from his doctor, H. B. Rey
nolds, state that the most dangerous
stage in his sickness is past and pro
vided no complications or relapse set
in, he will be convalescent in about
ten days or two weeks.

day's game from him, he being told,
that evening, that Stanford won by a
score of l">-6. After that he rested
more comfortably and passed a restful
night. He will not be told of Stan

Cardinal, until a week or ten days
have passed.

reach him.

not to see "Dad" Moulton at the game
and hoped that he woulij soon be well
