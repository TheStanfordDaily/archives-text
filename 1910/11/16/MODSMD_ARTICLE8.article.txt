# SOCCER TEAM STRENGTHENED BY VARSITY RUGBY PLAYERS.
## Fyfe and King Out for Practice Last Night, .Erb Joins Aggregation Next Week. 
### 
At the regular soccer practice held
last evening, A. D. Fyfe, '13, who play
ed inside right on last year's team,
made his initial appearance for the
season, and with the addition of this
fast little forward, the first and sec
ond team indulged in one of the fast
est practice games held this season.
Although unable to come out this
week, 1?. E. Erb, '12, last year's center
forward, has signified his intention of
joining the squad in the very near fu
ture, and with these two veterans, Erb
and Fyfe, added to the already strong
forward line, the first team should
be the equal of any of the city teams.
L. S. King, '12, a member of last year's
second team has also joined the squad
and is putting up such a good game at
left full that if continued will undoubt
edly win him a place on the first line
up.
The first team is practicing hard
after a week's rest in anticipation of
their game with the Barbarians next
Saturday. Although not at the top of
the league, the Barbarians are a set
of fast snappy players and the Encina
team will have their hands full if they
take them into camp.
Just what, the line-up for Saturday's
game will be has not been decided, as
with the addition of two of last year's
veterans, Instructor Maloney will in
all probability make quite a few
changes.
At the conclusion of the game the
Encina team is to be the guests of tho
Barbarians at a banquet at Blancos.
