Due to the interest taken by the var
ious fraternities anil organizations
upon the campus, a post season rugby
schedule has been made possible. This
arrangement has been attempted in
past years, but no success has attend
ed the efforts made to thus increase
the interest In the major sport. With
the present plan fairly launched and
the organizations ready for the games,
it is to be hoped that the different
teams will enter into the spirit of the
contests as they are expected to by
those who are responsible for the
consummation of this plan. The main
object of this schedule is to increase
and to perpetuate tnroughout the re
mainder of the season the general
interest in rugby and to allow all those
who wish to continue to compete upon
the turf an opportunity to engage in
the game. It is to be hoped that the
plan as adopted this year will be con
tinued in the future as a feature of the
football season and that it may be
come an institution worthy of being
retained. This result will naturally
follow if the proper interest is shown
by those directly concerned and if 110
game is forfeited by any team on ac
count of non-appearance at an ap
pointed hour. We Wish to see this
custom continued and it can be re
tained if this spirit and interest is
properly manifested.
