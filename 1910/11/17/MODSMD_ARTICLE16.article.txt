# DAWSON BEATS DOUGLASS IN INTER-CLASS MATCH.
## Freshman Champion Wins in Straight Sets.â€”Will Play Morgan for University Title. 
### 
In what was perhaps one of the best
tennis matches ever seen on the Stan
ford courts, H. W. Dawson, '14, defeat
ed F. M. Douglass, '13, in the semi
finals of the inter-class tournament.
Dawson won in straight sets, 6-3, 6-0,
but the scores in no way represent the
hard fight he put up in order to win.
Both men played a somewhat similar
game and smashed at every oppor
tunity; at times during the match the
ball would cross the net five or six
times before touching the ground.
Dawson, however, was the steadier
and managed to secure his points at
the proper moment. Particularly was
this true in the second set, in which he
shut out his opponent. In this set
every game went to deuce several
times, but Dawson always won the
game.
By virtue of his victory yesterday,
Dawson will play H. S. Morgan, '12, for
the University singles championship.
The latter reached the final round by
defeating H. Mann, '10, last week.
Morgan holds the title at present, but
it will be necessary for him to extend
himself in order to beat the Freshman
player. This match will be played on
the Encina courts next Saturday.
