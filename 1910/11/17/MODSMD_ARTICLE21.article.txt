# STANFORD GRADUATE WILL SPEAK NEXT SUNDAY.
## C.L. Duncan, '04, to Tell of Work in Syria as a Worker in Missionary Field. 
### 
C. L. Duncan, Stanford, '04, is to ad
dress the Sunday evening Y. M. C. A.
meeting to be held in the chapel ai
half past seven o'clock. Duncan has
for some time been in educational and
religious work in Syria and his dis
course will deal principally with his
activities there.
While at Stanford he was promi
nently identified with a number of or
ganizations, and was at one time pres
ident of the local Y. M. C. A., serving
later as general secretary. After com
pleting his work here he went east,
where he took an advanced degree
from Auburn University. Immediately
upon leaving Auburn he went to
Beyrut, Syria, where he has been en
gaged in the same line of pioneer work
that Dr. Greenfell and Hugh Moran
have been carrying forward in Labra
dor and China.
Those who are arranging for the
meeting extend an urgent invitation to
all Stanford men to come and hear
Duncan speak. Music is to be ren
dered by the association quartet.
