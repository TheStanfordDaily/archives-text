### 
According to an announcement made
at the University of California yester
day, the California Varsity will take a
trip to Victoria to play a series of
games during the Christmas holidays.
A challenge has been received from
the Victoria Rugby Union and it is be
lieved lhat it will be accepted. As
in the past ,the trip will be financed
by the northern athletic supporters.
No definite plan for the games have
been announced, but in all probability
three games will be played. This was
the number played against Vancouver
last year when California lost the ser
ies. The Vancouver fifteen was de
feated by Victoria this season, and so
the victors have challenged the win
ners of the 1910 inter-collegiate con
tes:.
The team will l;e announced soon
and will leave after the final examina
tions for Victoria.
