## WASHINGTON PROPOSES TRIANGULAR RACES. Varsity and Freshman Eights from California, Stanford and Northern University to Row. 
### 
Negotiations to hold a week's re
gatta on Lake Washington between
crews from Stanford, California and
Washington have been started by the
boating men of the latter institution.
The proposal was received yesterday
by the Lagunita Boat Club in the
shape of a letter from H. B. Conibear,
one of the Washington officials, out
lining a plan which meets with the
approval of the northern men. A sim
ilar letter has been sent to California.
The plan, as suggested, calls for the
holding of a seven day's regatta dur
ing May or June over the northern
course. Each university is to enter
two eight-oared crews, a Varsity and a
Freshman boat. The Freshman race
will be held during the first part of the
week and the Varsity at the end of
the period. Men in the first race will
be allawed to row in the second if
necessary. The first-year race to be a
mile and a half in length, and the Var
sity the usual three mile event.
The Washington men offer to guar
antee a reasonable amount of money
to the local club to help defray the
expenses of their crews. This amount
will be settled later when the details
of the regatta are arranged.
The allowance of a whole week's
time in which to hold the races will
insure good weather for the events.
Past regattas, notably that of last
spring, have been spoiled by rough
water. One day only in past years has
been eet aside for the race which
necessitated it being rowed on that
day regardless of unfavorable weather
conditions. Last May, the Washing
ton crew delayed going east one day
in order that the race might be rowed
over. In order to avoid a repetition of
unfavorable circumstances of this
nature, seven days will be devoted to
the sport.
If the plan goes through as out
lined, this will be the first regatta in
the north in which Freshman crews
from the three universities competed.
