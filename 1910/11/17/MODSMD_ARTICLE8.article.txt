# TEAM WILL ELECT CAPTAIN WHEN PICTURE IS TAKEN.
## 
### 
According to custom, the captain of
the 1911 Varsity rugby team will be
chosen when the 1910 fifteen assembles
for its picture in Palo Alto. Coach
Presley has not eet a definite date for
the meeting. Next week, however, will
probably see the gathering of the men
to elect a leader.
At California, it has been usual to
name the head of the fifteen at the
banquet on the night of the Stanford
game. This year Elliott, the five
eights, was selected unanimously im
mediately after the intercollegiate
game.
