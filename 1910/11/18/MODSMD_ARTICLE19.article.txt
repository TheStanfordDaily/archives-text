# SEVEN MEMBERS ELECTED TO WOMEN'S TENNIS CLUB.
## Organization Selects Students Who Have Shown Most Interest in the Sport. 
### 
Because of the interest they have
taken in the sport and the showing
that they have made in the recent
handicap tournament, seven new mem
bers have been voted into the Women's
Tennis Club. The following were
elected: Misses R. Benjamin, '13, M.
Atwood, '13, D. Amsden, '13, L. Her
ron, '14, J. Wand, '14, H. Batcheller,
'14, and T. Rogers, '14.
The annual interclass tournament
will start the week after Thanksgiv
ing. All girls interested are urged to
send in their names before November
23.
Plans for next year were discussed
and it was decided that the present
club was too small for practical pur
poses. The aim is to afford more
opportunity for tournament practice.
Therefore it was decided to choose a
number of girls for membership each
year from among those who displayed
the most interest and make the best
showing in the various tournaments
held during the year.
