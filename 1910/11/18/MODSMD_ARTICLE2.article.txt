# COLLEGES WILL BATTLE FOR RUGBY SUPREMACY.
## 
### 
The second greatest event in under
graduate rugby circles is the champ
ionship contests tomorrow between the
two college fifteens of Santa Clara and
St. Mary's. These two teams have
been improving with each year. Where
in the last three seasons they have
been barely respectable opponents for
the two big university Freshman
teams, they have now developed so
rapidly that it would not be surpris
ing if they are made opponents of the
Varsities in 1911. San Francisco ex
perts place the two fifteens on an even
basis of advantage, and the battle
should therefore be a royal exhibition.
St. Mary's has a Stanford coach, G. C.
Faulkner, '10, while Santa Clara pos
sesses an Australian teacher of tac
tic?.
