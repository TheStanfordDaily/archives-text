### 
Prospects for an excellent Sopho
more play are bright, as an unusually
large number of the members of the
class have signified their intention of
trying out for parts. There is every
indication that the standard of acting
will correspond to the excellent char
acter of the manuscripts which have
been received by the committee. With
the exception of a few on the way from
the east, these are now practically all
in the hands of the committee, and no
trouble in choosing a satisfactory one
is anticipated. The final selection will
be announced about the first of Decem
ber, in order that all desiring to try
out may have an opportunity to learn
their lines before the second week of
next month, which is the time set for
the try-outs.
