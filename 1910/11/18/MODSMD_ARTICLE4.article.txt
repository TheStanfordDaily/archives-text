# WEEK-END MATINEE OF RUGBY STARTS POST-SEASON SERIES
## Strong Teams Will Be Seen In Action at II. I.30 and 4.30 O'clock On Turf Field Tomorrow. 
### 
Three games will be played in the
preliminary round for the champion
ship of the post season rugby series
on the turf field tomorrow. The first
game will be called &t 11:00 o'clock
between teams I and 6. At 1:30 team
2 will play team 10 and the third team
will line up against the fifth at 4:00
o'clock.
Tomorrow's elimination games
promise some good sport and the'
science of rugby will not lie lacking.
The playing of men who have become
veterans in the service of the Cardinal
will do much tovyafds covering up
ragged work and introducing a fight
ing spirit. The clubbing together of
the campus organizations will bring
out some strong teams and some good
playing should be seen although the
lack of practice will be apparent.
From the standpoint of sport these
games should be extremely successful
and should make these series an an
nual affair. With little to interest the
Student Body at this period of the
semester these games promise to be of
common interest.
The series of last year was a failure
because of the superiority of a couple
of organizations over the rest. This
year's plan of grouping the organiza
tions ensures the closest attempt to a
balance of strength. The rules of
eligibility prevents a player from affil
iating with more than one team and
the decision of the governing board
that the halves should "be of only
twenty minutes- duration, ensure
snappy playing.
The two remaining games of the
preliminary round will be played on
Monday and Tuesday,—team 8 playing

team 9 at 4:15 Monday, while teams
4 and 7 play at that time the following
day. The series will then go over the
Thanksgiving recess to the following
week, the semi-finals probably being
played on December 1 and the cham
pionship game the following day.
The desire to finish the series as
soon as possible makes it necessary
that all games should be played as
scheduled and the non-appearance of
the team will forfeit the game to their
opponents. If neither team appear
that match will be declared cancelled.
