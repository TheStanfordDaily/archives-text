# SOCCER TEAM TO PLAY BARBARIANS
## KING AND FYFE ARE INCLUDED IN LINE-UP. Team Plays Match Game With Soldiers Thanksgiving Day. Erb to be in Line-up. 
### 
After a week of hard practice, In
structor Maloney last evening chose
the team that will line up at Alameda
tomorrow in its initial game with the
Barbarians. Two valuable additions
have been made to the team in the
presence of A. D. Fyfe, '13, and L. S.
King, '12. The former, who is an ex
ceedingly fast little forward has been
assigned to the inside left position,
while King, who in this week of prac
tice has demonstrated his ability to
handle his share of the back field, has
been given the position of left full.
The addition of these two men has
wonderfully strengthened the team
and although their opponents tomor
row are considered a very strong ag
gregation, the locals are confident of
taking them into camp. Higgins who
up to now has been playing center
forward has been shifted to outside
right, and here he seems to have found
his natural position for working with
Pellas and Pung a combination is
formed that is hard to beat.
This will be the last league game
that the Encina team will play in the
oity for some time as the next five
games are scheduled to be played on
the campus. The first of these is with
the Pastime Club of San Francisco
and if they continue to play the class
of game they are playing now the En
cina team will have its hands full
in winning the first campus game.
On next Thursday, the local aggre
gation will go to the city to play the
soldiers from the Presidio. This game
will undoubtedly be one of the hardest
the Encina team has yet played as the
soldiers have the same advantage the
locals have of being able to practice
every day and from reports from the
city they are taking all the advantage
of this possible.
B. Erb, '12, fast year's center for
ward, has signified his intention of
joining the squad the first of the week
and with the addition of this versatile
player the Encina team will surely
give a good account of itself in the
Thanksgiving game.
The line-up for tomorrow's game is
a"> follows:
Gymnasium—Gragg, Fyfe. Pung, Pel
las and Higgins, forwards; Hamilton,
Reynolds, halfs; King and Lyne, fulls:
Stuart, goal.
Barbarians—Wills, Smith, Brown,
Hansen and Eroll, forwards; Slater,
McCaskie and Pomeroy, halfs; Holm
and Potts, fulls; Stevenson, goal.
