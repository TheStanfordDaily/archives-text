# STANFORD ENGLISH CLUB WILL PRESENT OLD PLAYS.
## Plan to Give Interesting Production of Early English Dramas Next Semester. 
### 
Hy far the largest and most interest
ing production of old English
plays that has ever been staged
at Stanford will be given early
next February by the English Club.
It will be no less than a production of
three old English miracle plays, the
"Annunciation and Nativity Play,"
"The Second Shepherds Play," and
"The Three Kings," all written early
in the fourteenth century. They are
lay conceptions of the story of the
birth of Christ, and are representa
tive of one of the earliest stages of
the English drama. The first and the
last plays of the three to be given
have never been presented in America
and Professor Bassett has just trans
lated them from the old English. They
are largely musical in character and a
chorus of over a hundred singers clad
as monks will be one of the great
features of the production. The scen
ery will be simple, following the man
ner in which the plays were first given
and the costumes will be faithfully
copied from that period.
Though the three plays to be pre
sented possess a distinct unity, "The
Second Shepherd's Play" belongs to a
different cycle and is distinctly hum
orous, a characteristic which the ear
liest of the English dramas did not
possess.
The entire cast of the plays in
cluding the choruses will number over
three hundred. Of these there are some
thirty active parts, and with the ex
ception of six or seven parts, the ac
tors have already been chosen in try
outs under Professor Bassett's direc
tion. Work on rehearsals will be
commenced in the near future and
everything points to a most success
ful production.
