# DAWSON WINS STANFORD TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIP.
## Defeats Morgan in Three Straight Sets in Final Round of Inter-Class Tournament, 
### 
H. W r . Dawson, '14, defeated H. S.
Morgan, '12, in the final round of the
inter-class tournament Saturday
morning and, by virtue of his victory,
became the University tennis cham
pion.
Although losing, Morgan has the
satisfaction of having played in the
best tennis match ever seen on the
Stanford courts in recent years. Time
and again each man made seemingly
impossible returns which brought ap
plause from the spectators.
The contest was for the best three
out of five sets, but the Freshman
crack won three straight by scores of
6-0, 6-3, 9-7.
In the first set Morgan could not
settle down and his opponent ran out
the six games in easy fashion. But on
changing courts, the former champion
struck his stride and each won on his
serve. Dawson broke Morgan's ser
vice in the eight game and clinched
the set. In this and the following set,
every game went to deuce more than
once.
The third set was the best of the
match. With the score two sets
against him, Morgan came back strong
and won the first four games and it
appeared as if he would capture the
set. But Dawson pulled himself to
gether and forced the set to deuce
finally winning 9 to 7.
