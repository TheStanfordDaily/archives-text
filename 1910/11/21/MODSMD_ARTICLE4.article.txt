### 
On the turf field Saturday, Team 1
defeated Team 6 by a score of 8-0 at
11:00 o'clock and one hour and a half
later Team 10 defeated Team 2 by a
score Both games lacked the
team play that practice brings and the
contest was mainly among the for
wards with the ball in the ruck. The
afternoon's contest followed this
method of play pretty closely, the only
variety being an occasional kicking
tout.
The morning's game started off with
a rucking match in which the backs
and forwards of both fifteens figured.
Towards the end of the first period the
backs of the Ist. Team began to get
into action with yard gaining rushes,
but the half ended before they could
break through their opponent's de
fense. The honors of the scoreless
first half being about even.
Twice in the last period the passing
rushes of the Ist Team's backs were
able to strike through their opponent's
defense for a tally. The first was
made when Roberts secured at a 30
yard scrum and passed to Thoburn,
putting T. Sanborn across. Sanborn's
easy conversion chalked up a total of
5 points. The final scoring was made
when Sundell secured from the loose
at 10 and fell across for an- uncon
verted try. Score —Team 1, S; Team
6, 0.
The afternoon's set-to was more of
a rucking match, enlivened by some
good kicking bouts, in which both
backs and forwards were joined./. A
couple of Varsity backs In the after
noon's lineup would have made a dup
lication of the morning's game but
without them the nearly evenly bal
anced forwards stopped all attempts
to engineer a passing rush.
The score story was, Taylor se
curing at a ten yard scrum and going
across for a try which he failed to
convert. A duplication of this man
oeuver towards the close of the half
by M. Brown added two more with
Woodcock's easy conversion. With
the second period half over another
ten yard scrum netted a tally by put
ting Woodcock across and the scoro
stood: Team 10, 11; Team 2, 0.
