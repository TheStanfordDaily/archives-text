Due to the fact that, rugby is still in
vogue and that many trips are made to
and from the turf field, it might be
well to remember that the condition
of the new tennis courts may be re
tained and improved by refraining
from using them as a path. The Stu
dent Body has built them at consider
able expense and at the present time
they are in excellent condition for
new courts, lint if they are made to
serve the purpose of a footpath their
efficiency will not last for long as
tennis courts. To save the treasury
money it therefore behooves the stu
dents to refrain from any rough usage
of them.
