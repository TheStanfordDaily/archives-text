# BOATING QUESTION UP TO CALIFORNIA STUDENT BODY.
## 
### 
Whether or no,t. boating will be re
placed on an intercollegiate basis at
California depends largely on the stu
dents of that university. The execu
tive committee of the associated stu
dents has called for an advisory vote
from the students on the question.
The result of this vote will probably
decide the course of action which the
committee will take.
The California oarsmen are now out
for practice on the Oakland Estuary.
From now on the crew men will be
out two or three times a week. Fresh
men are receiving particular attention
from the old oarsmen.
