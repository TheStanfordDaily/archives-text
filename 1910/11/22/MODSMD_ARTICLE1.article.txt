# FOOTBALL CAPTAIN WILL BE ELECTED TOMORROW.
## Members of Team Will Also Discuss Northern Trip After Having Picture Taken. 
### 
The men who made their block "S"
in this year's Intercollegiate contest
will meet tomorrow at Franklin's for a
group picture. At this time, the men
who fought so valiantly on California
Field ten days ago, will elect a captain
to lead the 1911 Varsity.
The invitation extended by the Van
couver Rugby Union, through Secre
tary Sacks, to the Varsity to make the
journey north, after the coming end
semester examinations, and play a ser
ies of rugby games with its fifteen will
be discussed. With them rests the
decision whether they are willing to
make the journey or not.
This is the first time that such a
proposition has been made whereby
the losers in the northern and south
ern matches are to play together. Be
fore it can be accepted however, it will
be necessary to determine how many
of the Varsity players will be able to
undertake the Vancouver trip.
As far as the forwards are con
cerned, this should be fairly easy, with
the relatively large number of candid
ates that could be selected. With the
backfield it will be much more difficult
however, since if any of these men are
unable to go north during the coming
holidays, it would be hard to find sub
stitutes for most of the positions.
The acceptance of this invitation
would be a great thing for the men
who will play on next year's Varsity,
for the difference in the Canadians'
method of play and their knowledge
of the science of rugby has always
proved beneficial to a Cardinal fifteen
in each contest, with the northerners.
