# BISHOP PREACHED ON THANKSGIVING HABIT,
## Rt. Rev. W.F. Nicholls Addressed a Large Audience in University Chapel Sunday Morning. 
### 
Bishop W. F. Nicholls preached a
Thanksgiving sermon to an audience
that filled the University Chapel last
Sunday morning, his theme being em
bodied in the text "What a joyful and
pleasant thing it is to be thankful."
The speaker showed that the strong
individualism developed by the growth
of republicanism had, to some extent,
made the people selfish and ungrate
ful. This ingratitude related, not only
to the public servants of the country,
but to God. Christianity, having es
tablished the standards over Rome
after a struggle ot' three centuries
against autocracy, is now facing a con
flict with the results of popular sover
eignity.
The institution of an annual Thanks
giving Day, declared the speaker, was
virtually a declaration of dependence
on God. Thus, coincident with the
declaration of independence from des
potism at the beginning of this coun
try, there was a declaration of de
pendence on God.
