# GENERAL SUBJECT RECEIVED FOR ANNUAL CARNOT DEBATE.
## 
### 
"The Relation of the French Govern
ent to the Labor Problem," is the gen
eral subject of the forthcoming annual
Carnot debate, according to advice re
ceived by Professor R. M. Alden. This
subject will be intensively studied in
all its phases by the debaters, and
two hours before the time set for the
debate to commence, a specific ques
tion dealing with this general topic
will be announced, upon which they
will speak shortly after. A number of
debaters will probably study the topic
during the Christmas vacation, in
preparation for the try-out which will
be held next semester.
