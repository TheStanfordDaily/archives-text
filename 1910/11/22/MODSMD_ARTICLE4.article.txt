# STAR COYOTE AGGREGATION OVERWHELMS GYM FIFTEEN
## 
### 
By a score of 32-0 the "Coyotes" de
feated the Encina Gymnasium Team
yesterday afternoon on the turf field.
The composition of the eating club
was practically an all-star fifteen, with
such men as Crawford, Cheda, Morton
and Frank appearing in their line-up.
Tho scrum of the indoor athletes was
outweighed, but made a good showing
against their formidable rivals. The
passing of the "Coyotes" was not all
that could be desired and the fast fol
lowing up of the Gym. men coupled
with their good tackling held their
opponents to a lower score than might
have been expected.
The scoring abilities of the eating
club fifteen rested mainly with individ
ual work. At this, front ranker Frank
proved to be without a peer. Half of
tho "Coyotes'" tries were made by
him after long sensational runs, in
which the speedy Varsity forward
showed his sprinting abilities
The first half was devoted mainly to
scoring, the first try being made
after about a minute and a half of
play, when W. E. Simth secured from
the loose at ten and went across for a
try. At the end of the first half the
"Coyotes" had rolled up 21 points.
During the second period the athletes
by fighting hard were once on the
point of scoring.
First Hall'.
On the kick off the lineout started
on the Gym's 15. W. E. Smith secured
the ball from the ensuing loose and
went across for a try. Crawford con
verted an easy goal. Eight minutes
later, Frank secured at 35 and sped
through the loose for an unconverted
try.
At a one yard scrum, Cheda downed

the leather, which was heeled out to
him by the gymnasts, behind their
line. Crawford's boot added two more
points to the swelling score. Bellah's
ground kick across the athletes' back
line was scored on by W. E. Smith's
following up and falling on the spher
oid behind the line, Chandler failing to
find a conversion. Tallant and Frank
came next with a try from the Gym's
40 and Crawford's conversion closed
the first period.
Second Hall",
Tallant secured at the gymnastic'?
25 and put Holconib across for a try,
five minutes after the whistle blew for
the second period, Crawford failing to
tally a conversion.
For the ensuing eight minutes the
athletes defense held. Several times
the "Coyotes" advanced to their op
ponent's five yard line, but were driven
back. Finally Frank secured from the
end of a long line out and dove be
neath the defender's goal posts for a
try, which Crawford scored a conver
sion upon. Frank closed the after
