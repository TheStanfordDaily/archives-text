# STANFORD TROPHIES FOUND LYING IN VAULT ON CAMPUS
## 
### 
After having been lost for fifteen
years, the first football trophy offered
to the victors of Stanford-CalifoSrnia
Intercollegiate contests has at last
been found. The trophy, which is a
large silver football mounted on a
silver and ebony stand, was offered by
the San Francisco Examiner in 1892,
to be given to the team that won thrca
successive victories. Although no
documentary evidence of the offer has
been uncovered, these are apparently
the conditions of the gift.
The scores of the first four football
games are engraved on the stand.
These games were either Stanford
victories or ties. The first game,
played in the spring of 1892, resulted
in a Cardinal victory by a score of 14
to 10. In the second and third games
neither side was able to capture a vic
tory, the scores being 10 to 10, and
6 to 6. The first was played on
Thanksgiving day 1892, and the sec
ond just one year later. In 1894 Stan
ford secured her second victory by a
score of fi to 0. This is the last game
engraved on the trophy and it appar
ently disappeared some time during
the next year.
The discovery of the whereabouts of
the silver football was made by J. E.
McDowell, almost by accident yester

day afternoon in the vault of the Reg
istrar's office. Since his advent in the
office in 1890, McDowell had noticed a
small box in one compartment of the
vault. However, supposing that it was
the personal property of some member
of the faculty, the box was never close
ly examined. Yesterday afternoon, in
an attempt to secure more available
space in the vault, the contents were
re-arranged. The box, which possess
ed no marks of identification, was then
taken out and opened in order to dis
cover the contents.
How the trophy came to be placed
in the Registrar's Office is as yet an
insolvable mystery. Henceforth it
will repose peacefully with other Stan
ford souvenirs in the trophy room of
the Library.
Two other interesting objects, spoils
of war, have been added to the col
lection in the Library. One is the
shield offered by the Western Con
ference to the winner of the relay
race in the annual meet, while the
other is the Sophomore cane, formerly
an object of great importance among
the two underclasses.
The shield, which has just been re
ceived from Chicago, is an artistic
work with decorative figures In
