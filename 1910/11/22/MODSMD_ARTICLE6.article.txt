### 
An interview with Referee J. Jenkin
son recently appeared in the "Van
couver Province," in which he com
mented upon the intercollegiate con
test between Stanford and California.

game his comments are interesting.
His interview follows:
(By Jack Jenkinson.)
Berkeley, Cal., Nov. 1910—"The game
was one of the finest exhibitions of
rugby i have seen for many years.
While the Berkeley backs at the be
ginning of the game were consider
ably nervous, when Stanford scored
two tries, after that they settled down
and gave everybody a treat in the
handling code.
"Stanford forwards were a shade
better than California in the scrum,
but not so good in the open, as for
instance, when the ball went in touch,
and it was Stanford's ball they had a
scrum every time. Their backs as
a whole were fair. Brown kicked a
good length, but scarcely ever found
touch, whilst Dwiggins of California
kicked well and found touch every
time. California threequarters and
five-eights were perfect, their passing
being grand. Stanford backs were
weak, while at times they showed well
individually. Erb as scrum half was
superior to Morris of California, but
of course was playing behind a better
scrum.
"California backs made all their
tries by perfect combination. The
game all through was clean and very
spectacular for the immense crowd of
spectators, numbering 23,000. Had they
provided more room they could easily
have filled it, as they turned away five
hundred people.
"Regarding our chance in Vancouver
of beating California on Saturday's
form, I would say they could get our
measure by 20 points. Although we
can beat them in the forwards, we
have not yet got their class in backs.
I think we should beat Stanford on
Saturday's play.
"Sorry to see that Vancouver lost to
Victoria", and to hear of Roberts' being
injured. Thanks to Capt. T. Byrne for
telegram on result.
