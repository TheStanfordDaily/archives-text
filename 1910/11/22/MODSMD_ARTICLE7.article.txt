# "DAD" MOULTON IS VISITED BY FRIENDS TODAY.
## Veteran Trainer is Rapidly Recovering and Will Soon be on His Feet Again. 
### 
That "Dart" Moulton is well on the
road to recovery comes as welcome
news to every member of the Student
Hotly. Friends were allowed to visit
him for the first time this afternoon
and announce that the veteran trainer
is in the best of spirits. "Dad" is
very weak, however, and the physi
cians still refuse to have him informed
of the true results of the intercolleg
iate game.
It is yet unknown when he will be
able to resume his duties, but he is
convalescing very rapidly and will no
doubt be out again in a very short
time.
