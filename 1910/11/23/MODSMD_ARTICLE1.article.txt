# GRAGG BREAKS LEG IN RUGBY MATCH
## SERIOUS ACCIDENT MARS PRELIMINARY MATCH. Teams 5 and 7 Win in Last Games of First Round Yesterday Afternoon. 
### 
Yesterday's rugby series were
marred by the breaking of O. H.
Gragg's leg. The last period of the
game between Team 3 and Team 5
was nearly over when Gragg and
Dimon, running at top speed for the
ball, collided and Gragg's right
was badly broken in two places. This
unfortunate accident happened almost
identically in the same manner as in
Kern's case in the last game between
the Varsity and the Olympics on No
vember 5.
In the two games yesterday after
noon on the turf field, Team 5 beat
Team 3 by a score of 18-0 at 3:00
o'clock and at 4:30, Team 7 won from
Team 4 by a 6-0 score.
Three converted tries marked the
first period of the 3 o'clock game.
Glass' kick from 3's 40 was fielded by
Barman at 30, who crossed for a try.
Reeves was next across with a sen
sational 50 yard swerving lope. Car
son, Belcher and Reeves closed the
first half with a try from 2">. Tiede
mann's conversions added 6 points.
lint one try marked the hard fought
second period when Carson was sent
across from a ten yeard scrum, Tiede
mann failing the difficult conversion.
An unconverted try in each period
of the second game fell to the lot of
the winners. After a hard contested
fight hack and forth the length of the
field. Erb's boot from 4's 4ft to a line
out at. 10 put Warlow across as the
half closed. Berryman failed to con
vert.
Towards the close of the last half
Erb annexed the next three points by
a try from a two yard scrum. Erb's
attempt at a conversion from near the
side lines just fell short.
