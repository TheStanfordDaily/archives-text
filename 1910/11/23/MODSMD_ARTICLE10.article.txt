In the election of Benjamin Edward
Erb to the captaincy of the 1911 Var
sity fifteen, the football men have
made a happy choice of a leader and
have chosen one who will eminently
qualify for the duties devolving upon
him during the season of work next
fall. The captain-elect has proven
himself throughout his college career
to be worthy of the honor and re
spect of the men who have associated
with him on the turf, while he has
gained the confidence of all those with
whom he will work next year. The
new captain is to be congratulated
upon the high honor that has been
awarded him at this time by his team
mates and the Daily Palo Alto takes
pleasure in acknowledging his good
fortune.
