# B.E. ERB, '12, WILL CAPTAIN VARSITY
## VETERAN HALF CHOSEN AS CARDINAL CAPTAIN. 1910 Rugby Team Elects Leader this Afternoon for Next Year's Squad. 
### 
Coming without a surprise was the
election of Benjamin Edward Erb, '12,
of Chemalnus, British Columbia, by the
members of the Varsity fifteen. The

choice of the veteran Canadian half
was unanimous. With two years of
service behind a Varsity scrum, Erb is
eminently fitted to lead the Cardinal
fighters during next fall's rugby sea
son.
Erb's playing at half is a revelation
of the possibilities of this center of
play. As a punter to touch, he is
without a peer when shut off from
backfield help.
Erb's career as a half began in his
Freshman year. As captain of his
Freshman team, he guided his fifteen
from the half hack position and dur
ing the 12-3 game of 1 DOS he won his
block "S." Ineligible for last year's
Varsity, he kept in training as a center
forward on the Encina Soccer Team.
From the beginning of this season he
has played at half and during the
afternoon practices he has been an
efficient assistant to Coach Presley.
Erb is a member of the Sigma Alphia
Epsilon fraternity and registers In
the department of Geology.


Captain-elect B. E. Erb. '12.
