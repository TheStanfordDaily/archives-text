# VARSITY WILLING TO JOURNEY NORTH
## DECISION WILL BE ANNOUNCED TOMORROW. Brown, Mitchell, Minturn, and Arrell Will be Unable to Make Trip. 
### 
It seems highly probable that the
invitation extended by the Vancouver
Rugby Union will be accepted. It has
been found that all the first year
Varsity players will be able to make
the northern trip but that the rest of
the team will be weakened by the non
attendance of the reliable Brown and
Mitchell at center. The forwards will,
Lack Minturn, as the backbone of the
pack at. lock and Arrell as hooker.
The final decision will be reached
tonight or tomorrow morning and a
telegraphic message will be immed
iately dispatched to the secretary of
the Vancouver Union.
The acceptance of this invitation
will necessitate the resumption of
training, probably three nights each
week, although with the short time
left it may be necessary to increase
this number. With the short time
since the men have been in training
the period left will be ample to put
them into splendid condition.
