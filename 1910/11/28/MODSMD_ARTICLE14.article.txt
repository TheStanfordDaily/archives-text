An alumnus has arraigned Stanford
in a San Francisco newspaper and has
placed his Alma Mater in a discred
itable light in the eyes of those who
are not sufficiently acquainted with the
facts as they actually exist within the
University to form a right conception
of the true status of conditions here.
There is not as much the matter with
Stanford as has been made out at
various times. "To one who has any
knowledge of the facts and the actual
situation, "the Faculty 011 one hand
and the Student Body upon the other"
are not "arrayed against each other in
battle formation," nor is there enough
dissension to warrant the assertion
that there has been "a sharp line of
cleavage between Faculty and Student
Body." Criticism has arisen at times
of the action of certain divisions of the
administrative department of the Uni
versity, at times justly and also un
justly, but this has not amounted to
a situation such as that represented
by the San Francisco paper. Such
criticism cannot, mean that there is a
sharp division between these two ele
ments, nor can it mean that there is
such a condition of affairs that the
name of the institution will be injured
by such conditions. Such an assump
tion is- entirely wrong.
Stanford is at the .present time
working out a problem for herself and
has so far succeeded exceptionally
well, It niay be said <ilso that much;o?
the success is directly due to the at
titude that the majority of the Faculty
take toward the Student Body. The
Associated Students realize that fact,
-*-they understand -perfectly that with
out the assistance of the Faculty this
problem would be serious. The stu
dents do not collectively distrust the
Faculty, nor do they stand in the po
sition of belligerents ready for con
tinual clashes. Neither does the Fac
ulty stand as a body opposed to the
students.
Such publicity, which is fundament
ally an exaggeration of the facts as
they exist, is lamentable. Not only
does it create a wrong impression in
the minds of the reading public out
side the University, but it also makes
the work carried on upon the campus
that much more difficult. A series of
