# COLLEGE DAILIES ON FILE IN Y.M.C.A. HEADING ROOM.
## 
### 
In consideration of the large num
ber of students in the University who
at times desire to consult the daily
publications of other colleges, it has
been arranged by the Daily Palo Alto
to place all exchanges received at this
office in a place where every one may
have access to them. They will be
turned over to the officials of the Y.
M. C. A., who will place them on file
on the large rack in the reading room
maintained by that organization. This
will include a large number of daily
papers received with more or less reg
ularity from eastern, middlewestern
and western colleges.
