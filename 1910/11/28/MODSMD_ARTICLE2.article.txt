# SAMPSON WILL BE UNABLE TO COACH BASEBALL SQUAD.
## Former Star Reluctantly Refuses Offer Made by the Executive Committee. 
### 
Owing to the fact that he will be
unable to give up his work in the en
gineering fields, C. E. Sampson, '09,
has been forced to decline the offer to
coach the baseball team next season.
Sampson's services would have been of
great value to the squad and it was
only after numerous overtures that
the Executive Committee gave up hope
of engaging him.
The final decision came last evening
in a telegram, in which Sampson
stated that it would be out of the ques
tion for him to serve as Coach Pres
ley's successor.
Several prospective coaches are
known to the Executive Committee,
but it is undecided as to which of these
will be offered the position. Without
a coach or captain, no definite plans
will be made for the coming season
until college opens next spring.
