# ENCINA SOCCER TEAM LOSES BOTH OF VACATION GAMES.
## Contest With Soldiers Very Even but Pastimes Cleverly Outclass the Locals. 
### 
The Encina Gymnasium Soccer team
was taken into camp in both of last
week's games. The first of these was
with the Soldiers from the Presidio
and up to the last few minutes of play
was anybody's game. Although clearly
outclassed in weight, the locals were
the aggressors from the start, and 1 , but
for the sloppy condition of the field,
which made passing and dribbling im
possible, they would undoubtedly have
come out of the game with the long
end of the score. In the last few min
utes of play, the center forward for
the Soldiers, shot from close range the
winning goal, and, although from this
point on, the ball was always in their
opponent's territory, the Encina for
wards were unable to convert the tie
ing tally. Throughout the whole time
there was continuous rain and when
Ihe contest was concluded, the field
was a, mass of slush and mud. The
final score was 3 to 2.
In the second of the games, which
was with the Pastime Club of San
Francisco, who are the leaders of the
league, the local team was clearly out
classed and in only three instances
was their opponent's goal in any dan
ger. The team in this was practically
the same as the one in Thursday's
game except that Higgins was shifted
to left full and Instructor Maloney
played outside left. The final score
was 2 to 0, and but for the fine defen
sive work of Higgins, King, and Rey
nolds would undoubtedly have been
more, as the back field was in an al
most constant state of bombardment.
Captain McCann was released from
the hospital last Friday and will un
doubtedly be in the line-up for Satur
day's game with the Vampires.
