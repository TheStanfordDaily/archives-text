# UNDERCLASSMEN TO ENGAGE IN DEBATE
## SOPHOMORES AND FRESHMEN BEADY FOB CONTEST. Two Evenly Matched Teams Will Speak Tomorrow Evening in Chapel. 
### 
The last expression of interclass
rivalry for the present semester, may
be witnessed tomorrow evening at 7:30
o'clock in the University Chapel when
the classes of 1913 and 1914 meet in
the annual Freshman-Sophomore de
bate. A team of three able debaters
will represent each of the two under*
.classes-and from a forensic stand
point, the battle should be quite as
tenso as have been the physical con
tests.
The Sophomores will be represented
by G. N. Wood, P. D. Nowell, and W,
E. Simpson, who will speak upon the
affirmative side of the question in the
order named. Of the three, Simpson
is the only veteran Stanford speaker,
having been a member of last year's
Freshman team which vanquished 1912
as Sophomores. Wood and Nowell, al
though new figures in the debating
firmament, can be depended upon by
their class. Simpson will handle the
rebuttal.
O. H. Castle, C. C. Close, and W. B.
Owens make up as evenly balanced
and as brilliant a team as have ever
represented a Freshman class. Each
man a forceful arguer and a clever
thinker, the three should give 1913 as
good a contest as could be wished for.
This team will uphold the negative
and will speak in the order named.
The last speaker has two extra min
utes allowed him to conclude and sum
up the negative contentions. All the
other speakers will be given ten min
utes on the floor.
The subject for debate is, "Resolved,
That the constitutional amendment
granting to the federal government
power to levy an income tax should be
endorsed by the legislatures of the
several states."
The judges who will render the de
cision are: Professor H. F. Bolton, of
the Department of History, and Pro
fessors A. M. Carthcart and C. 11. Hub
erich, of the Law School. R. ,T. Miller,
'11, as President of the fntersociety
Debating Committee will preside.
