more Cotillion on next Saturday even
ing. Of the 175 tickets which were
offered for sale, all but a few have
been disposed of, and these are at

Original programs and favors will
be made features of the dance. The
programs which have been designed
by E. M. Albright, '12, are decidedly
different from anything before seen on
the campus. They will be distributed
to all those presenting their tickets
on the Quad between the hours of
10:15 and 12:15 Thursday morning.
This will be the only opportunity to
secure the programs and only those
who present tickets at that time will
receivo them.
Two short cotillion figures will be
enjoyed during the evening along with
the regular fourteen dances. The com
mittee requests that all should make a
special note of the number of their
tickets, as those holding odd numbers
will be in the first figure, while those
holding even numbers will participate
in the second.
The first dance will start promptly
at 8:15 in order that the last dances
on the program will not. be shortened.
Besides the regular cars running to
Palo Alto ,that evening, special ar
rangements have been made to have
cars leaving the campus at 7:50, 8:00
and 8:10. Ample accommodations
have been assured, and a number of
cars will leave for the campus immed
iately after the dance.
