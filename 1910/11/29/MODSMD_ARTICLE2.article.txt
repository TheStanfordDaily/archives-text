# STANFORD AND CALIFORNIA VARSITIES RETAIN VETERANS
## Prospects for Strong Football Teams in 1911 Season Show Many Experienced Men in Both Aggregations. 
### 
Of sixteen men who played against California this year, the Stanford 1911
Varsity can expect to lose no more than six, and possibly only two. Two
players are absolutely out of the question through ineligibility. But Cali
fornia is in the same general condition. Out of nineteen men the Blue and
Gold will lose three and probably four. The two varsities can each look for
the return of over a dozen veterans next fall, with a reasonable degree of
sureness. Both fifteens will next year be reaping the reward of having
been forced to develop a team the year previous out of raw material. Coach
Presley, of Stanford, had that problem this fall, and Coach Schaeffer of
California, in 1909.
