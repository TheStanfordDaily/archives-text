Cheda and Minturn are the two men
of the Cardinal 1910 Varsity who are
absolutely ineligible, both having
played four years against California.
Captain Dole, and F. C. Brown, full
back, may return. Both are seniors
and expect to finish their college
course at the end of this year. There
is that chance, however, that these two
strongest members of the 1910 fifteen
will come back for 1911. Harrigan,
the Freshman five-eights, is the third of
the uncertain players. But it is more
than likely that he will be back in a
suit next fall. A fourth player whose
return is not assured is Arrell, front
rank.
This narrows the number of the vet
erans of the 1910 team who will appear
next September, with due allowance
for unforseen circumstances, to ten.
They are: Side-rank, Olmstead; rear
rank, Frank, W. Smith, and Baumgart
ner; half back, Erb; wing forward,
Sundell; five eights, Reeves; center,
Mitchell; and Thoburn.
In the same breath that these men are
set down must be mentioned Partridge,
rear rank, kept out of the game thi√ü
faH onty'thNnlgft aH eleven tff fidur irj
jutfy-;" Kern,' wing, Whose failure to
make an "S" in football this fall de
pends upon the same reason as that
applied to Partridge; and Cass, the
Freshman half of the 1909 Varsity.
These men swell the total number of
Varsity men who will be seen again
at fourteen. Two veterans of the 1909
Varsity, Fitting and Hortun, will not
be able to play next year.
There will therefore, be two or three
players absent from the scrum, and the
backfield may be depleted by two men.
On the contrary, looking at the situa
tion through Cardinal glasses, the
backfield may be intact and able to
make the most of this year's experi
ence. The pack will, however, in any
case, be devoid of the services of
Cheda and Minturn.
