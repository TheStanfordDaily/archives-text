### 
Dwiggins, the Blue and Gold captain,
is the only member of his team who is
absolutely ineligible through having
played out his allotted four yearte.
Ashley and Jordan, however, will
probably make with him the trio who
will be missed from the California
fifteen next year. The fourth unde
cided player is the expert dribbler.
Pauly. Of the nineteen men, includ
ing Hansen, who will receive his "C,"
although he did not enter the game
because of a shuffle of substitutes on
the California sidelines, who defended
the Blue and Gold colors on Novenibet
-12, fifteen or sixteen will return. The
four Seniors coming back are Swartz,
Pauly, Markwart and Ashley. Pauly,
is of course, uncertain. Seven of the
team are Juniors: C. Phleger, Hansen,
Wheeler, Elliott, Harris, Evans, and
Watts. The four Sophomores are:
Peartt, Morris, Stroud, and Allen.
Dills is the only Freshman. He was
used in the big game to substitute for
Watts. , ,
California is thus shown to he on a
slightiy better footing than Stanford
as torprospects of the reappearance of
Meiii&siß. The backflelds of the two
varsities are Intact with the exception
of the full backs, since Harrigan is
far more than likely to reappear for
the Cardinal. Dwiggins cannot play
again. But on the other hand, there is
a chance that Brown will not desert
the Stanford fifteen.
The two teams lose in the forward
divisions, and both will be minus an
equal amount of good material.
Stanford has the better of the bar
gain in the substitute list by almost
two to one, as regards both number
and ability. Both varsities can look
to receiving a certain amount of strong
material from the 1915 class. The
Cardinal is especially fortunate here.
B. Risling .chaptain of the Palo Alto
High School fifteen enters next year.
Risling has been named by Bobs,
rugby writer of the San Francisco
Chronicle, as second choice for an All
America fifteen, and he assuredly de
serves the place. Several of his team
mates, Howe, TempletOn, Hutchinson,
Ramsey, and Soper, will follow him.
