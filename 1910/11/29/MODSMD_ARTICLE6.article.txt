game was the liveliest and full of the
best playing yet seen in the after sea
son series. From start to finish the
game was hotly contested. Not one
successful passing rush was seen dur
ing the action, the side attempting this
method of gaining ground found it to
be a losing one instead. The game was

for a dribbling rush or exchange of
kickt'.

the beginning of the last period and
their opponents were forced to play a
strong defensive game. For the first
twelve minutes of play the eating club

passage across the line for a try,
which his brother drove between the
posts for a conversion.
R. M. Brown was nearly across
again in a few minutes when a line
out at l's 15 gave him the ball. Buck
ing through the opposing line he was
downed behind the line but in such
close proximity to the corner that, as
the field lacked boundary flags, the
referee was uhable to determine
whether he was across or outside. The
matter was decided by giving Tiede
mann a drop out.

darkness after the game had gone four
minutes overtime in an attempt to
play off the tie, a free kick awarded to
Brown in the last minute of play hav

best playing yet seen in the after sea
son series. From start to finish the
game was hotly contested. Not one
successful passing rush was seen dur
ing the action, the side attempting this
method of gaining ground found it to
be a losing one instead. The game was
fought in the scrum and the heeling
out of the leather oval was the signal
for a dribbling rush or exchange of
kickt'.
Teams Evenly Matched.
The teams were evenly matched.
The first half found Team 4 playing a
stronger game and during that period
they marked their only tally. In the
scrum they proved slightly superior as
wejl as in the roughing in the lineouts.
Team 4 Makes Score.
Qelcher paved the way for a try,
when, on a boot from midfield, he
advanced the lineout to l's 10. -The
following scrum at 5 put Glass- across
for, a try. Tiedemann added 2 points
with a conversion. The first period
closed with the game at midfield fol
lowing a rally which carried the
Breakers to their opponents five,
where a free kick by Taylor had fallen
short of a field goaL. . i , . . ;
Team 1 started oft-with a rush at
the beginning of the last period and
their opponents were forced to play a
strong defensive game. For the first
twelve minutes of play the eating club
fifteen camped close to the 4th team's
line, and twice the defenders barely
saved. From a fighting scrum at 4's
5, R. M. Brown secured and fought a
passage across the line for a try,
which his brother drove between the
posts for a conversion.
R. M. Brown was nearly across
again in a few minutes when a line
out at l's 15 gave him the ball. Buck
ing through the opposing line he was
downed behind the line but in such
close proximity to the corner that, as
the field lacked boundary flags, the
referee was uhable to determine
whether he was across or outside. The
matter was decided by giving Tiede
mann a drop out.
The game was called on account of
darkness after the game had gone four
minutes overtime in an attempt to
play off the tie, a free kick awarded to
Brown in the last minute of play hav
ing missed a field goal.
