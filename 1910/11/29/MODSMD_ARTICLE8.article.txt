One of those students who have
taken an active interest in the success
of the post season rugby series and
have actually forwarded the succes
sion of games by participating in them,
has been injured. The accident has
developed into a serious one and at
the present time the sufferer is ser
iously ill. How long the injured play
er will be required to remain under
the care of a physician in the hospi
tal will not be known for some time
to come, but it is certain that his con
finement will continue for a consider
able length of time. These circum
stances indicate that the injured play
er will incur a large bill both for phy
sician fees and also for hospital
charges. The expenses fall directly
upon the sufferer and in view of the
fact that he was endeavoring to assist
the rugby series, it might be well if
he received assistance from those in
the Student Body who are interested in
this schedule. It has been well sug
gested that a small admission be taken
upon the day of the final championship
game. The sum collected at the gate
would be nominal, yet in the aggre
gate would materially assist the in
jured player. Action by the committee
that has charge of the series would
make this movement possible and it is
to be hoped tha that board can see
their way clear to decide upon such
action.
