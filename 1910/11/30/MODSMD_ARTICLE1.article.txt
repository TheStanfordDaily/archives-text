# UNDERCLASS DEBATE WON BY FRESHMEN
## 1914 CAPTURES ANOTHER INITIAL CONTEST. Castle, Close and Owens Comprise Winning Team.â€”Are Given Unanimous Decision. 
### 
1913 in setting the new precedent of
a Freshman victory in the annual
Freshman-Sophomore debate, a thing
hardly known up to last year, found
the new born tradition a boomerang
yesterday evening, when the 1914 team
composed of O. H. Castle, C. C. Close
and W. I?. Owens won by the unani
mous decision of the judges, in the
1910 underclass debate. This trio,
clearly superior to the Sophomores,
won a clean cut decision over their
opponents, G. N. Wood, P. D. Nowell
and W. F. Simpson, presenting the
negative side of the income tax ques
tion in a truly remarkable fashion.
The specific question for debate was,
"Resolved, That the constitutional
amendment granting to the federal
government power to levy an income
tax should be endorsed by the legis
latures of the several states." In
speaking against the income tax, the
Freshmen won through emphasizing
the injustice and the undesirability of
this system of taxation. The failure
of the Sophomores to fully rebutt the
arguments of injustice and evasion of
payment lost them the debate. The
line of argument used by both sides
was exceptionally clear and logical
and showed a careful study and good
analysis of the subject.
The main contention of the affirma
tive were that the government was
greatly in need of additional revenue,
especially in time of emergency, and
that the income tax afforded the only
adequate method of providing this
revenue. The negative, in answer,
claimed that the injustice of the sys
tem outweighed any advantage it
might have as a money getter and that
our excise taxes could provide for us
in all times of emergency. The nega
tive laid great stress on the possibility
for evasion, and as a result, claimed
that the income tax was a tax rather
on ignorance and honesty than on in
come.
Simpson was undoubtedly the ablest
speaker on the affirmative, while like
honors were held by Owens on the
negative. Wood's introduction to the
subject and opening it for debate was
a very worthy effort, however, while
Castle and Close did equally well as
first and second negative speakers.
The Freshmen were all so evenly bal
anced that it is difficult to discrimin
ate between them.
The judges rendering the decision
were Professors A. M. Cathcart and C.
H. Huberich, of the Law School, and
Professor H. E. Bolton, of the History
Department. R. J. Miller, '11, was
the presiding officer.
Close and Owens are both Pre-Legal
majors and members of the Phi Kappa
Psi and Delta Chi fraternities respec
tively. Castle is registered in the
Economics department and is a mem
ber of the staff of the Daily Palo Alto.
