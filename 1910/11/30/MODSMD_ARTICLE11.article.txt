Another article in a series of what
are evidently a Succession of vindic
tive, retaliatory investigations by a
San Francisco newspaper that has
personal animus toward the Univer
sity, has appeared, giving to the world
a statement of conditions within Stan
ford as the alumnus believes them to
be. The Daily Palo Alto repeats its
assertion that such attempts to injure
Stanford upon the outside presents a
wrong impression in the minds of
those not acquainted with conditions
within the University and leads many
to question the actual stability of the
organization of the institution.
The Student Body condemns and
repudiates such articles as an exag
geration of fact, an unjustifiable inter
meddling in student affairs, and a
cheap method of' retaliation by a San
Francisco newspaper. .
Their stand is decided and should be
sufficient tb show that such inter
iitieddling and such misrepresentation
of facts are cordially condemned. De
spite the "loyal alumnus" our repu
tation and standing with the world at
large is gradually decreasing as these
so-called appear before
the reading public.
