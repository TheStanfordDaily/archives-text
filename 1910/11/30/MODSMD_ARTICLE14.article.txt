# ORATORIO SOCIETY PLANS CONCERT FOR JANUARY.
## Popular San Francisco Tenor Will be Heard at Stanford Next Semester. 
### 
McKenzie Gordon, of San Francisco,
by far the most popular singer 011 the
Pacific Coast, will he heard at Stan
ford in a concert to be given by the
Oratorio Society sometime during the
latter part of January. His wonderful
tennor voice and his inimitable ren
dering of Scotch songs have given him
more than a local reputation, and he
recently was offered an opportunity to
tour with Tetrazinni. He bears the
reputation of being the only singer in
San Francisco who is able to com
mand an overflowing audience without
the aid of other attractions, and his
singing at Stanford will be a treat
not to be overlooked by music lovers
here.
The concert will be the third given
by the Oratorio Society and Gordon's
singing will probably constitute about
half the program. The exact date has
not yet been decided but will be an
nounced later.
