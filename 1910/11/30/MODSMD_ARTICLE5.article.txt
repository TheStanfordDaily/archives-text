# HARD FOUGHT GAME WON BY COYOTES
## VICTORY WON YESTERDAY BY TEAM 2. Largest Share of Work Done by Opposing Forwards.—Backs Seldom in Action. 
### 
Team 2 defeated Team 3 yesterday
afternoon on the turf field in a closely
contested game by an 8-3 score. The
heavier scrum weight of the Coyotes
failed to make the showing that was
expected. In the lineouts they were
better but failed to follow up their ad
vantage.
The 3rd Team backs did not show
up to such good advantage as in the
game on last Saturday which they won
in the second period by their passing.
The backs of their opponents also
failed to form a passing unit and the
game was played chiefly between the
opposing forwards. Each of the three
tries being marked up by scrum play
ers.
The game was of the kind that in
terested the bleachers, a rapidly shift
ing one. First one team would be
close to its opponent's line, when a
well-timed rally hurled the aggressive
fifteen back to a line of defense in
their territory.
The whistle starting the first half
was hardly ended when the Coyotes
had followed up their kickoff to a line
out at 3's 25. King's boot from here
to midfield started Team 3 on a re
versal. Kauffman's kick added fifteen
yards more and Sundell started drib
bling to Coyote's 15. Exchange of
kicks sent the spheroid out at 40 and
King's dribbling start from midfield
was saved by Carpenter.
The drop out started another rever
sal and the game was fought in 3's
territory until W. E. Smith secured at
2 and went across for an unconverted
try as the half ended.
A rapid shifting of the game from
one end of the field to the other opened
the last period and ended with Morgan
going across to the score from a 25
scrum, T. Sanborn's attempt at a con
version falling short.
The Coyotes made their winning
points p. few minutes later when Davis
secured at 10 for a try. Crawford con
w
verted from an easy angle.
The kickoff carried the game into
Coyote territory. T. Sanborn, on
Coyote's offside, failed to score upon
a difficult drop kick from near the
side lines at 25. Two minutes later
the half was over with the ball at a
midfield scrum.
