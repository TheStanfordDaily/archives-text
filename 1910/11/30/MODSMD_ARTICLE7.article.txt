# HOARD OF TRUSTEES FAVOR SUMMER LAW SCHOOL IDEA.
## Law Department Asked to Formulate Plans and Submit them for Final Approval. 
### 
Summer law work at Stanford in the
future was approved by the Board of
Trustees in their meeting ot November
—•», when the following resolution was
passed: "Resolved, That the recom
mendation by Acting President Bran
ner of the establishment of a summer
session of the law school be approved
in principle, and that the department
of Law be requested to formulate a
plan for the establishment of such a
summer session, to be submitted to the
Hoard through the President of the
University, subject to their approval
of the scheme when finally presented."
About six weeks questions were
sent out to all law students to en
deavor to determine the number who
would take advantage of summer law
courses if such were offered. A suffi
cient number having signified their
desire to shorten their courses in this
manner, the Law department will un
doubtedly prepare plans for the school.
While an innovation at Stanford, these
courses are given at almost all of the
large colleges of the country, and in
the past many Stanford students have
taken the summer courses given at
Berkeley and elsewhere. This pro
posed action will do much to strength
en the legal department here.
