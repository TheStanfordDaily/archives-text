# SECURE VICTORY IN FAST CONTEST
## TEAM 1 DEFEATS TEAM IN POST SEASON SERIES. Interesting Game on Turf Yesterday Brings Schedule Close to Final Match. 
### 
Yesterday afternoon Team 1 defeated
Team 5 on the turf field by a score of
13-0. The game was strongly contest
ed from the time the first whistle blew
until the second half was over. Al
though lacking passing rushes, as had
been characteristic of the after sea
son series, the action was replete with
fast rugby. In lineouts and scrums
the two fifteens broke even, the prin
ciple feature and yard-gaining method
was by kicking. Erb and F. C. Brown
excelled in this feature, Erb making
several difficult kicks from behind the
scrum formation when hard pressed.
Brown was a consistent advancer of
the ball with his long distance punts
to touch.
The first half was stubbornly con
tested by both teams. A converted
try was made by the Breakers in the
last minute of pay, merely by chance,
when Worswick failed to get away a
kick from his fifteen, Grace securing
and going across. The second half
was as hotly contested as the first
period, but in the last few minutes the
Breakers broke through s's defense
for two tries. M. Brown secured the
first and Woodcock the second, F. C.
Brown converted the last as the game
ended.
Twice in the first few minutes of
play, the Breakers were forced to
save, first when Warlow dribbled
across from 25 and again when Erb
sent the ball across from 30. The sec
ond drop out carried the lineout to
25 and from here a free kick by Taylor
advanced the lineout to midfield. Erb
in turn was forced to save when Wil
cox dribbled across from 30.
F. C. Brown failed to score on a
free kick from near the side lines at
30, King saving for 5. The next few
minutes was devoted to kicking, dur
ing which, most of the field was cov
ered. The half ended with Grace's
try from 20, which was converted by
F. C. Brown.
A midfield encampment was the
scene of nearly half the second period
then a wider range of action was
opened up and the game began shift
ing between the 25 yard lines. F. C.
Brown turned the tide of the shifting
game by a mark at his 30 and spiraled
to s's 40. A series of lineouts ad
vanced the spheroid to 15 and the
ball in the loose, following this line
out, was secured by M. Brown for a
try, F. C. Brown failing a conversion.
Dribbling from midfield gave the
ball to Woodcock at s's 10 and the
Breakers last try was converted by F.
C. Brown.
