Three important offices among Stu
dent Body positions will receive (he
attention of the Associated Students
tomorrow afternoon in the University
Chapel. Too much stress cannot be
laid upon the fact that a nomination
and election of this nature requires
the interest of the entire Student Body.
The offices are important and will
eventually place the persons elected
in responsible, official positions in our
organization of students. If members
of this body do not show their inter
est and their appreciation of the im
portance of the selection of these
officers, the Student Body suffers and
tho individual is responsible. To
morrow's meeting in the Chapel should
therefore witness a strong attendance
of those interested in the Student
Body, while the nominations made
should give evidence that attention
has been paid to the importance of the
offices to be filled.
