# FOUR MEN UNABLE TO TAKE JOURNEY
## VARSITY ALMOST COMPLETE FOR NORTHERN GAME. Arrell, Brown, Minturn and Mitchell Will Not Accompany Team to Vancouver. 
### 
Last night the proposed Varsity trip
to Canada received the stamp of ap
proval from the Executive Committee
of the Student Body and Graduate
Manager D. W. Burbank was directed
to wire the secretary of the Vancouver
Rugby Union to that effect. The
northerners having asked for the low
est guarantee that Stanford would ac
cept, it was decided to ask for $1700,
although the trip will probably total
$2000. This reasonable guarantee of
$1700 will undoubtedly be accepted by
the Canadian players and the addi
tional expense necessary for the trip
will be met by the local Student Body.
The Cardinal players, accompanied
by Coach G. J. Presley, will leave for
the northern metropolis on December
21 or 22. The return trip will be made
on January 7.
A series of three sanies will be
played with the Canadian aggregation
during the year-end holidays. In
preparation for these games, Coach
Presley announces the resumption of
practice tomorrow afternoon. "Whether
practice will be held every night or
not has not been announced as yet.
Although but a short time is left for
practice and for the men to get into
condition, the splendid shape of the
team on November 12, will necessitate
only a short time for them to reach
par again.
With but four exceptions, the Var
sity will be intact. These four men,
who will be unable to accompany the
team north are, Mitchell, Brown, Ar
rell and Minturn. This opportunity
for the Cardinal veterans to play with
the Canadians should prove invalu
able, especially for the men who
played on the Varsity, this year for
the first time.
From the quality of rugby that the
Vancouver team is playing this year a
closely contested series is promised.
In the northern series between Van
couver and Victoria, Vancouver was
beaten in a closely contested game by
a score of 8-3. As winners, the Vic
toria Union challenged California to
make the journey north and play for
the Cooper Keith Trophy. The Blue
and Gold players have not as yet an
nounced whether they will accept, the
invitation or not. Provided California
does not accept, a chance probably
will be offered the Cardinal players,
to try conclusions with the northern
winners as well as the losers, in the
recent contest.
