# W.B. BARTLETT TO COACH 1912 OPERA
## PROMINENT DIRECTOR CHOSEN BY JUNIORS. Opera to be Selected Next Week. Try-outs Will be Held in Coming Semester. 
### 
W. B. Bartlett was selected last
night to coach the 1912 Junior Opera
by the committee in charge of that
production. The selection of this
well-known coach was made after a
thorough investigation of the merits of
several prominent San Francisco mus
ical directors. Bartlett's ability as a
director has been recognized for the
last twenty-five years or more on this
coast and his work needs no intro
duction here. He has supervised the
production of many operas on the
Stanford stage, the more recent being
"The Mikado" and"The Chimes of
Normandy." Under his supervision,
the 1912 opera sould prove a great
success.
Several operas are being composed
by well-known alumni and under
graduates which will be submitted to
the committee today for their approv
al. The selection of the opera will be
made next week and the prize of $f)0
awarded to the successful composers.
Two that are known to be almost
completed are those being written by
Miss M. Herdman, ex-'l2, and J. H.
Forbes, '13, and E. E. Chase, '11, W.
S. Wilson, '13, and P. Eliel, '13. The
music for the former has been com
posed by Miss Herdman, while Chase
and Wilson have collaborated on the
lyrics for the latter. Some excep
tionally catchy music is found in each,
while the librettos are of a high order.
Local color is introduced in both,
scenes being laid on the Quad. Furth
er than this, nothing is known of the
compositions, as the authors have re
fused to discuss them in detail.
Try-outs for principals and chorus
will be held as near the beginning of
next semester as possible, so that
ample time will be had in which to
rehearse before the date of the pro
duction. In this way it is hoped to
avoid the unfinished character of pre
vious Junior operas due to rehearsals
being crowded into too short a period
of time.
