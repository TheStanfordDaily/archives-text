# SOPHOMORE PLAY TRYOUTS WILL BE HELD NEXT WEEK.
## Committee Will Soon Decide on Comedy to be Produced During Coming Semester. 
### 
One of three plays which are now
up for consideration, will bo chosen
before Monday by the .Sophomore
Play Committee and try-outs will bo
held on Friday and Saturday of next
week.
The choice of plays lies between
three well known comedies, "On the
Quiet," "The Contented Woman" and
"The Girl With the Green Eyes." Any
one of these three plays would be ex
ceptionally well adapted for produc
tion as a farce-comedy such as the
Sophomore class of this year desires
to present.
Coach Matliieu will be on the camp
us next week to assign parts for the
try-outs which will be'held on Decem
ber 9 and 10. A large number of stu
dents have signified their intention of
trying-out and with the talent which
the class possesses, a strong cast is
assured.
The play will be produced about the
middle of next semester.
