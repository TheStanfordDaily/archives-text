TEAM TWO A ('QUIRKS
RIGHT TO PLAY IN FIN ALS.
Team 2, or the Coyotes, qualified
for the finals yesterday afternoon on
the turf field by defeating the last
group in the series, Team 4, by a
score of 1G 0. The Coyotes played on
the aggressive most of the game, sev
eral passing rushes, were started by
them, but seldom passed the second
five. Two passing rushes were en
gineered by them, however, which
swept tbe field. First during the mid
dle of the first period when Crawford
secured at 4's 40, and in conjunction
with Bianchi and Chandler, advanced
40 yards for an in-goal. The second
made a score when Frank and Craw
ford in combination from 4's 20 put
the ball beneath their opponent's goal
post, the big forward converting.
That Team 4 did not make the show
ing which won them a tie with the
Breakers on Monday, was due in great
measure to the weakening of the back
field through the loss of Darsie, Bel

cher and C. Smith. The losers put tip
a good fight and never slackened down
until the last two minutes of play and
as darkness was beginning to hide the
players, the Coyotes, twice struck
through 4's defense and added ten
points to their score. A short mid
field scrummage followed the opening
whistle and then rucking put tte>
Coyotes on their opponent's 10 for a
lineout. Twice Tiedemann averted a
score, first by a quick getaway boot
from 1 and again, when, in a returning
surge, Rutherford dribbled across
from 10, 4's fullback saved.
W. E. Smith secursion at 4's 10
started him on a yard gaining lope,
Frank relieved him at 25 and went
out at 4's 15. 4 chose a scrum and
Frank broke through for a try after
five minutes of play. Crawford failed
to convert.
Crawford secured in the loose at 4's
40 following Tiedemann's drop out,
and via Bianci, Chandler for an in
goal. A period of indecisive playing
followed, the Coyotes endeavoring to
put their backs into a scoring unit, but
4 on defensive checkmated, Carson's
ready boots to touch proving savers.
Frank secured at 4's 35 and swerved
through 4's defense for a try as the
half ended. Crawford's boot missing
a conversion.
An aggressive opening by 4 started
the last period at midfield and en
masse they dribbled across, Carpenter
saving. Crawford's lofty spiraled
kick out gave a midfield lineout. A
juggled ball in the loose and 4 offside
gave Crawford a free kick at 4's 25.
His boot from placement was blocked
and hard lighting succeeded, finally
giving away to individual showing.
Reeves picked up at his 5 and ran to
a 35 lineout. Frank with the ball, re
turning. Carson saved after a 5 yard
scrum. Kicking then was intersper
sed and ended with 4 on the defense at
10. With two minutes remaining, the
Coyotes devoted each to a try, Frank
and Crawford being responsible for the
first, going across from 20. Passing
starting in the darkness at 4's 10
finally reached G. E. Cheda who de
posited the ball behind 4's line. Craw
ford scoring the first conversion and
Chandler the second.
