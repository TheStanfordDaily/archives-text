# SOCCER TEAM TO PLAY "VAMPIRES"
## THREE CHANGES MADE IN THE LINE-UP. McCann, Williams and Clyde to Play. After this Game One More Before Next Semester. 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon on the gym
nasium field the Encina Gymnasium
s-occer team will line up for their sec
ond game with the Vampires of San
Francisco. In the first game played,
the locals were beaten by a 2 to 1
score, but since then, the team has
been strengthened by the addition of
Erb and Fyfe in ilie forward line and
King in back-field and it is expected
that with this new line-up, the locals
will be able to reverse their defeat of
November. At present, the Vampires
are the second highest team in the
league and are considered by followers
of the game as the equals of the
champion Pastime Team, so tomor
row's game will undoubtedly be one of
the hardest that the locals have yet
engaged in.
After a week's hard practice and
the trying-out of various men, In
structor Maloney last evening an
nounced the team that will play to
morrow. The line-up includes two
new men, namely, Williams at out
side right, and Clyde at left half. In
the practice held last evening both
these men played a fast snappy game
and they will undoubtedly greatly
strengthen the team.
The full line-up is as follows:
Forwards — Higgins, Pung, Erb,
Fyfe, and Williams; halfs—Clyde,
Reynolds, Humphreys; fulls—McCann
(capt.), and King; goal, Stuart.
