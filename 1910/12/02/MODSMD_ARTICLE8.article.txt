# CARRIAGES NOT IN ORDER AT SOPHOMORE DANCE.
## 
### 
Rain or shine, no carriages will be
in order at the Sophomore Cotillion to
morrow evening, according to the
wishes of the committee in charge and
they are especially desirous that
everyone shall comply with the rule.
Enough special cars are to be run to
accommodate all who attend.
The committee also requests that as
many Sopohmores as possible will be
at the Palo Alto Armory tomorrow to
assist, in decorating. The rain will
handicap the work to some extent and
those who can spare the time to deco
rate will aid greatly in making the
cotillion p. success.
