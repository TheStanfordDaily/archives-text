# STAND IS TAKEN BY CONFERENCE
## RESOLUTIONS ARE ADOPTED ON SATURDAY. Exception is Taken to Series of Alleged Investigations Now Being Made. 
### 
Action has been taken by the Uni
versity Conference with regard to the
series of articles that are appearing at
the present time in the San Francisco
Call. This representative body of
students met last Friday afternoon in
a business session and in the course
of the afternoon discussed and debated
upon the attitude that that board of
men should adopt with regard to this
alleged serial investigation. No sat
isfactory result having been reached
at that time a meeting was called
for Saturday, when the following res
olutions were passed as the expression
of the majority opinion of the Student
Body at the present time.
The result of the meeting appears
in the following sentences.
The University Conference, a repre
sentative body of uppcrclassmcii and
graduate students elected to deal with
matters of student interest, expresses
itself as opposed to the attitude of the
San Francisco "Call." as regards this
University. .We believe the publica
tion of these articles to have been
prompted by a long-standing animos
ity on the part of that paper toward
Stanford University and those in
charge,
Under the present plan of co-opera
tion between .Faculty and .students
much lias been done to bring about a
mutual .understanding .on .problems
which have given trouble in the past.
The Faculty Student Affairs Commit
tee and the Student Advisory Com
mittee from the University Conference
are holding frequent meetings for the
free discussion of cases of discipline
and of matters of general interest to
the Student Body.
IVe believe the solution of the prob
lem of student control Ts.being worked
out in this new relation, vlVFaculty and
students, and that such articles as
published by the Calf eiwi only add
difficulties,
