Report comes l'roni those in charge of
the 1912 Quad that little interest is
being taken in that publication by
members of the Junior class. This,
according to the complaints, is evi
denced by the low percentage of the
assessments that have been paid by
Juniors and also by the general dis
interested attitude with regard to the
publication of the book. To make a
success of this official volume, which
is filed as an authentic record of the
college year, there must be support
from the Junior class as a unit. If
those who are engaged in compiling
and editing the book do not have the
cooperation of the individual members
of the class, the task becomes prac
tically impossible. The work is ex
pensive and requires a constant out
lay of money to finance the volume.
This calls for immediate cash which
is only found in the payment of assess
ments.
In addition members of the Junior
class can assist by obtaining their pic
tures for the annual. The work to be
accomplished necessitates the re
moval of all such departments that
may be concluded at the present, time.
If the book will include spring athlet
ics, which in itself means an exten
sive task, every department except
that particular one must be completed

before the final work commences. To
produce a complete volume in suffi
cient time, the Junior class should in
dividually assist in this endeavor.
