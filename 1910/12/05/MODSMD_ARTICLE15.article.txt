# CHAPLAIN SPEAKS ON CONSECRATION
## DR. GARDNER DECLARES THIS TRAIT SECRET OF TRUE LIFE. Speaker Discusses Necessity for College Men and Women to Lead Unselfish Lives. 
### 
Preaching on the text "For their
sakes L sanctify myself," Dr. D.
Charles Gardner yesterday exhorted
the University students in attendance
to consecrate themselves to the un
selfish service of mankind. Such an
action he showed would be of vast
benefit to humanity for the college
men and women of today are to be the
leaders in thought and action in the
world outside the cloister in later life.
The chaplain took up the various
ideas of virtue, explaining that the
theme of Greek and Roman thought in
this regard was the fulfillment of the
laws of nature, and that the Hebrew
idea of righteousness was the law of
purity interpreted according to formal
traditions. Higher than either of these
he said was Christ's teaching of "the
complete development of manhood, the
most sympathetic love of nature, but
also the submission of conscience and
will to the law of God, and the most
unselfish service of humanity." Christ's
consecration he characterized as "only
love and devotion, splendid purity, un
surpassed holiness, a passion for man
kind."
Admitting possible faults in the doc
trine of the man, Dr. Gardner held up
Tolstoi as an example of one who had
consecrated himself to the betterment
of human society, and stated that un
less a person would submit himself to
be a mere pawn on the chess board of
life he must set himself apart to wont
for more than personal gains. In thi.4
connection he said:
"Don't let your life be a servitude to
things. Curb vagrant fancies. Stifle
unlawful passions. Keep self in place.
Consecration is the secret of every
true life for it is the secret of charac
ter and the secret of service."
Christ's life was pointed to by the
speaker as the exemplification of the
highest consecration, and his saying,
"For their sakes I sanctify myself,"
the motive of his life. In discussing
this expression Dr. Gardner said:
"It plainly reveals the wonderful
self consecration of the Master. And
as one meditates upon the consecration
of Jesus, one feels how little one's
own life accords with his life. Facing
the marvelous self abasement of the
Son of God one realizes how little an
ordinary mind can understand the
deepths of his mind."
