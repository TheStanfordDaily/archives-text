## ANNUAL FUNCTION IS ATTENDED BY OVER 180 COUPLES. Hall is Beautifully Decorated. Programs and Favors are Original. 
### 
Beautiful decorations, catchy music
and original favors and programs are
features long to be remembered ijy
those who attended the Sophomore
Cotillion at the Armory last Saturday
evening. The dance was a great suc
cess in every way. Over one hundred
and eighty couples were on the floor,
being the largest number that has
ever been in attendance at one of these
functions in recent years.
The decision of the committee in
holding the dance at the Armory
proved a happy choice as at no time
during the evening was there any con
fusion in accomodating the largo num
ber present.
The grand march, which was led by
H. B. McGuire, president of the Sopho
more class, proved a pleasing diver
sion from the regular order of dances.
The figures were very simple. The
favors consisted of small footballs,
filled with candy and tied with red
ribbons, and roses with doll heads in
the center.
The hall was very artistically deco
rated with long strings of smilax
draped about, while the walls were
covered with Stanford banners border
ed with smilax. All the lights were
covered either with a block "S" or e
block "13." The musicians were hid
den behind a bank of palms on the
front of the stage, and a large Ameri
can flag formed a canopy overhead.
Stanford colors and penants made the
stage the most beautiful part of the
decorations.
Te programs which were designed
by E. M. Albright, '12, were printed as
red Sopohmore hats. Although the
class spared no expense in their ef
forts, the dance proved a success finan
cially as well as otherwise.
Through an error of the printer, the
name of K. M. Levy was omitted
from the list of those who served upon
the Sophomore Play Committee.
