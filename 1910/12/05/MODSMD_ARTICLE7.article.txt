# BONNHEIM PRIZE WON BY HILTON
## DEBATER SUCCESSFUL IN ABLE DISCUSSION. $125 is Reward to Winning Speaker, Hill and Olgilvie Give Able Talks. 
### 
The winner of the 19J0 Bonnheim
Discussion, together with the prize of
$125 offered the best speaker is Frank
Howard Hilton, '11, ol Portland, Ore
gon. Facing two ol the same oppon
ents including its winner, who met
him in the Edward Berwick Jr. Peace
Prize Contest, Hilton in a well pre
pared and forcefully delivered address
on the "Ethical Aspects of Intercol
legiate Athletic Rivalry" won the de
cision of the judges. The Discussion
was held in the University Chapel Fri
day evening and was the best attended
and most closely contested since tin
institution of the Bonnheim.
Owing to the possibility for contrary
views, the Discussion took on much of
the character of a debate. The two
other contestants, F. E. Hill, '11, and
P. M. Ogilvie, '11, upheld opposite
views. Hill argued that intercollegiate
athletic rivalry is not ethically justifi
able while Ogilvie, backed by Hilton
declared in favor of our present sys
tem with certain alterations.
Briefly, the main contentions of Hil
ton were that although our present
intercollegiate system of athetic riv
alry is defective the fault is primarily
in its organization and not in the in
stitution itself. He declared it ethi
cally justifiable because it is the best
means to stimulate athletic exercise,
which is absolutely necessary to every
normal man. "Interclass and inter
club rivalry," Hilton asserted, "are not
sufficient stimulus." "Intercollegiate
rivalry is morally desirable as a cre
ator of university spirit and as a sub
stitute for vice prevalent in colleges
wherfe there is no general participation
in athletics."
Constructively, Hilton spoke of how
our present system may be improved
so as to make athletics general and
universal. He proposed the system
now advocated by Professor Gulick,
physical director of the New York
schools, and Professor . A. Darby of
Harvard, of having the gymnasium the
athletic center of a college, with sports
as part of its curriculum.
Ogilvie in his speech followed much
the same line of argument, while Hill
deplored the over-emphasis of inter
collegiate athletics at the expense of
the average student and its profes
sional tendencies.
Hilton, the winner of the Discussion,
has been active in forensic work since
his matricultion. He was a member of
both his Freshman and Sophomore
debating teams, and is enrolled in the
Nestoria Literary Society, Phi Alpha
Tan and Delta Chi. He was also
president of his class in his Sopho
more year and a member of the 1911
Quad Board.
The judges rendering the decision
were Beach Thompson, gr, and Cecil
Merrick, '99, of San Francisco and W.
A. Shedd of Palo Alto. Professor A.
