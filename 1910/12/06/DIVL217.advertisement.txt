With each package of
Fatima you get a popu
lar actress' photograph
—also a pennant cou
pon, 25 of which secure
a handsome felt college
Fanciful phrases or
thoughts couched in beauti
ful language may be well
enough for the classics, but
one homely word is suffi
cient to describe Fatima
Cigarettes—They're
"Bully"—and unlike
Shakespeare, we repeat —
they're "bully."
Works of the old masters
of tobacco blending —
authors of all your joys—
are Fatimas. Plainly
packed —1 0 additional
cigarettes instead of a fancy
box.
