# VARSITY RENEWS DAILY PRACTICE
## CARDINAL PLAYERS PREPARING TO MEET CANADIANS. Strict Training Started for Men Who Will go North â€” Partridge Joins Squad. 
### 
Practice of short duration yesterday
afternoon on the turf opened tho
training season through which tlie
Varsity men will go in prepartion for
the Christmas rugby series with Van
couver. Training rules went into ef
fect yesterday morning for all those
who will be eligible to take the Can
adian trip.
The accuracy of the men in handling
the pigskin yesterday afternoon was
far better than would be expected on
the first day of practice after a three
weeks layoff. The high character of
the first practice speaks well for the
showing that the Cardinal veterans
will make in British Columbia. The
recent group rugby series, in which
each of these players appeared un
doubtedly accounts for their condition.
Every week night at 4:45 the pros
pective travelers will be in togs on the
turf and hard practice will be the
order of the day until the team is
ready to begin their journey.
The remainder of this week will be
devoted to regular practice work.
The first practice line-up was to have
been held on Saturday afternoon, but
as the postponed championship ben
efit match has been scheduled for that
day, the first set-to will probably be
held next Monday at 4:45.
A welcome addition to the working
force last night, was Partridge, who
was unable to take his place in the
Varsity scrum on November 12, on ac
count of an injury received a few
days previous to the big encounter.
Partridge took part in the entire prac
tice last night and handled the leather
oval while on the run without any
appearance of stiffness.
