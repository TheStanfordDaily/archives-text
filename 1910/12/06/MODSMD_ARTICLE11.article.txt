Three important Student Body of
fices will be filled by a general election
tomorrow. The competition for two of
these official positions has increased
and is now sufficient to warrant close
contests for these respective offices of
trust. This fact is evidence of a
healthy interest in the future of the
Student Body providing that such con
ditions are not made the occasion for
inexcusable political chicanery and
unfair electioneering. The result at
the polls tomorrow will also further
indicate the interest that the Student
Body as a whole takes in the selection
of men who will fill these positions.
The attitude that the Associated Stu
dents should assume toward this elec
tion is one of closest interest and at
tention as the offices to be filled are
among the most important in the
Student Body. They assume the re
sponsibility of the great mass of stu
dents who place them in their re
spective positions and as the acts of
the future office holders will affect the
entire Student Body, there is a duty
incumbent upon the individual mem
bers of that organization to select the
men of their choice and to give the
choosing careful thought.
