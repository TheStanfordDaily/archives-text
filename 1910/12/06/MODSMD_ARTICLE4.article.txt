# FIVE 1910 STARS WILL SERVE AS 1911 BASEBALL NUCLEUS
## Many of Last Year's Squad Will Be Candidates â€” Ganong Will Return to College Next Semester. 
### 
Obear, center Held; Childs, left
field; Mitchell, third base; Ball, first
base; Gilfillan, pitcher; 1910 Captain
Ganong, catcher. Those are the mem
bers of last spring's championship
nine, which must form the neucieus of
the' 1911. Stanford Baseball Team. The
first five men named above are in col
lege now. Ganong, although not en
rolled this semester, has definitely de
cided to finish his course next spring,
and it is certain that he will be back
to greatly strengthen the Cardinal
nine. Canterbury, a veteran of the
1909 Varsity, might be added to the
above list as catcher or infielder,
since there is a fair possibility that he
may appear with the squad in
January.
Several men who sat on the bench
during the Varsity season last year
are available: Outfielders, Beeger,
Cass, Gragg, and Jordan, Tallant and
Soper, infielders; and Kelley, of the
box position. Two other good players
who were not eligible last year, be
cause of the transfer rule, will be on
hand: Jones, of Santa Clara, a strong
pitcher, and infielder; and Henshaw,
the star of the class baseball series
last year, on first base. Dooling and
Peters, both well-known Santa Clara
College players, now in college, are not
eligible by the transfer rule, but may
be available in 1912.
Terry is admitted by many to be
head and shoulders above the Fresh
man group of candidates. He is an
infielder of unusual ability, and
showed his mettle in surprising ways
during the fall diamond practice. Hit
ting will probably be his main

strength, but his covering of ground
in fielding will not be far behind, pro
viding he keeps to his record made in
October. Reputations grow and fall in
the course of a season, but his playing
seems founded on thorough knowledge.
Gault, box man, and Draper, candidate
for one of the bases or short stop, are
two more Freshmen who were con
sidered formidable in fall practice, and
may be able to hold up their records
during the coming schedule of games.
Gault is consistent in the box position,
while Draper does his duty in base
running. Other Freshmen may de
velop who were unable to appear dur
ing the fall, because of work on the
football squad.
The class teams of last February's
series produced several men who have
many chances now to show their dia
mond capacity. The 1913 Freshmen,
in particular, included players who will
make the present veterans look to
their places before the season is over.
At any rate, their competition will
make the Varsity men bring out all
there is in them. The other classes
also have representatives who will
give a good account of themselves.
The Varsity schedule has not taken
form as yet. Several teams, however,
have written for dates, among them
Ireland's Independents, and the Olym
pic Club. The full list of the con
tests will probably not be issued by
Manager Burbank before the last of
January. Although it is a little early
to forcast the schedules, there is
small chance that, it will contain dates
with any teams out of the ordinary
run.
