# "DEVIL'S DISCIPLE" TO BE PESENTED IN LOS ANGELES.
## Stanford Players Will Reproduce Popular Play During Holidays at Mason Opera House. 
### 
Owing to the fact; that most of the
leading characters in the "Devil's Dis
ciple" as presented by Sword and San
dals and the Maskers this semester
are from Los Angeles, this play will
he presented in that city during the
Christmas holidays. No definite date
for the performance has been set as
yet, but it will probably be held short
ly after Christmas. The Mason Opera
House is to be engaged by the Stan
ford thespians.
Most of those who took the leads in
the "Devil's Disciple" are well known
in amateur dramatic circles in the
southern city so that aside from be
ing an attraction presented by Stan
ford students, it will be of interest to
many as an opportunity of again see
ing their friends in a high class dra
matic production.
Miss G. D. Workman, '12, who had
the leading feminine role, is a gradu
ate of a Los Angeles dramatic school,
while R. H. Seward, '12, the leading
man, was prominent in several ama
teur productions in that city before
coming to Stanford.
