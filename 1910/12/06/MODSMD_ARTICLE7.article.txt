# WOULD BUILD NEW TRAINING HOUSE
## BOARD OF CONTROL DISCUSSES MANY PLANS. Construction of New Turf Field Will be Begun before Heavy Rains Set In. 
### 
Prospects for the erection of a new
training house was the most impor
tant business up for discussion at the
last meeting of the Board of Control.
After the various plans had been dis
cussed at length, the board came to
the decision that temporarily no defi
nite action would be taken, but that
the present structure should be re
paired.
However, the erection of a new
training house with a large swimming
pool was deemed advisable as soon as
sufficient funds could be secured to put
up a building to cost about $8,000.
The probable location of such a struc
ture was also the subject of much dis
cussion.
To fulfill a long-felt need, the board
has decided to vote money for the con
struction of a new turf field, the lo
cation of which will be decided at the
next meeting.
The minutes of the meeting are as
follows:
Meeting Board of Control, December
2, 1910.
