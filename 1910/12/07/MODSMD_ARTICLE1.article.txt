### 
The receipt of $1000 from Mrs. 1-1. C.
Hoover for the Stanford Women's
Clubhouse Fund has given a nev\ im
petus to the collection of the $25,'>00
for the building. This sum brings
the total figure to $4000 in cash, and
$7000 pledged.
The clubhouse movement was put on
a firm basis in August, 1910, when the
committee in charge incorporated
with the following Board of Directors:
Mrs. P. .1. Treat, 'OG, president; Mrs.
E. W. Allan, '96, vice-president; Mrs.
J. E. Matzke, treasurer; Mrs. W. H. B.
Fowler, '08, secretary; Mrs. J. M. Still
man, Mrs. H. J. Ryan, Miss H. Stadt
muller, '95, Miss M. Stevens, '01, Miss
A. Kimball, '04, Miss H. Campbell, '11.
The movement is an effort on the
part of the alumnae, faculty women,
and the undergraduate women to erect
a building which will be the center of
women's activities on the campus. Ac
cording to the present plan, the build
ing will be placed in the vicinity of
Roble Hall and will contain all ac
commodations necessary to the under
graduate women, and headquarters for
visiting alumnae.
Ground will be broken for the build
ing when half the sum, $12,500, has
been collected in cash. The principal
method of raising the money is
through life membership fees of $25
which entitle the holders to privileges
of the club without further dues.
These fees must be paid before Octob
er 1, 1911, when the Board of Directors
plans to have the $12,500 necessary to
start building operations.
Up to this time most of the money
has been pledged by the undergraduate
women of the University; the alumnae
and the Freshman class of this year
will bo called upon during the next
semester to make a definite contribu
tion to the fund.
Pledge cards may be obtained from
Miss N. Moise, '12, or Miss H. Camp
bell, '11. Pledges and payments should
be sent to the treasurer, Mrs. J. E.
Matzke, 1211 Bryant street, Falo Alto.
