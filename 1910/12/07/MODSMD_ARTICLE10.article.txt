The clubhouse pledges were made
eight months ago, and the last date
for their payment is but ten months
away, yet the amount of cash which
has come in from them is pitifully
small. The matter is not one that can
be left until the day before October 1,
1911. Prompt payment is expedient.,
since certain potential payments de
pend upon the collection of $12,500,
and the more cash in the treasury
above that sum before the ground is
broken, the better for future finances
of the club.
