# BOAT HOUSE TO BE BUILT IN CHRISTMAS VACATION.
## Benefit Planned by Women for Saturday Evening.—Plans for Building Ready. 
### 
Providing that tyeav.y £ains do not
interfere with the work, it is ex
pected that the new boathouse to be
built on the shore of Lagunita for the
Stanford Boat Club will be completed
by the beginning of the spring semes
ter. The women of the University have
raised over by membership
pledges of $1.50 each, and secured an
additional $150 on Tag Day, an amount
nearly sufficient to insure the erection
of the boathouse.
Plans have been drawn by Baily &
Stone for the building. These provide
for a rustic house 15 by 40 feet, with
a large boat room and dressing rooms.
A wide porch will extend across the
front of the building and from this a
gangway will lead to the float in front
of the house. The place selected for
the building is on the northern side of
the cove where the shore is a very
gradual slope and the bottom is good.
Both boating and swimming will be
taken up by the members of the club.
No professional swimming teacher
will be engaged, but committees will
be appointed to teach the girls who
wish to learn to swim. Several row
boats and sculls will be provided, and
if the members desire it, crews will
be formed.
The Boat Club is planning a benefit
to be held in Roble gymnasium on Sat
urday evening, December 10, at 7:30.
The affair will be in the nature of a
stunt evening and several clever en
tertainments have been planned by the
different houses. A new feature will
be two dances given by the classes in
fancy dancing. These numbers, which
will be presented by a class of twelve
girls, are an Impromptu Gavotte and
L'Zoronto, a Spanish folk dance. Miss
I,'Anphere, who has charge of the
classes, will also give as a solo dance,
Chatschak, a Russian polka.
The entertainment is open to all
women of the University and to faculty
women. An admission of ten cents
will be charged.
All girls who wish to join the Boat
Club are asked to pay the membership
fee of $1.50 before December 10.
