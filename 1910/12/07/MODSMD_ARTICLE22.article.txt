# Improvements at Roble Gymnasium.
## 
### 
The Board of Trustees has granted
the petition for improvements to be
made in Roble Gymnasium and work
was begun today. Several new showers
and dressing rooms are to be added
and the interior will be painted during
the Xmas vacation. This satisfies a
long felt need, as the accommodations
have been inadequate for the number
of girls interested in gymnasium work.
