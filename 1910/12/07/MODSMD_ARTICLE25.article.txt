The try-outs for the Sophomore play,
"On the Quiet," will be held Friday and
Saturday afternoons of this week in
the chapel under the direction of
Frank L. Mathieu of San Francisco,
who will coach the production to be
staged early in March.
Owing to the large number of Soph
omores who have alreday signed up
for the try-outs, Chairman L. C- Lull
has found it necessary to issue num
bers, indicating the order in which
Coach Mathieu will meet the aspir
ants for parts. Those who have re
ceived numbers from l~to 20 will meet
Friday in the chapel at 2:30, and num
bers above 20 will be taken on Satur
day. This system applies both to the
women's and the men's try-outs, and
those who fail to appear at the ap
pointed time will forfeit the number
assigned. Already the number signi
fying their intention to try out liaa
surpassed the expectations of the com
mittee, and much available material is
promised by the members of the Soph
omore class. The Play Committee,
who will assist Coach Mathieu in the
selection of the cast, is composed of
Chairman L. C. Lull, Miss M. F. Em
mons, Miss M. L. Gilbert, Miss L.
Baker, Miss M. J. Long, W. S. Wilson,

man, Jr., S. Brown.
Copies of selected scenes have been
obtained from the local press, and
those wishing to try out are expected

purpose of evincing the respective tal
ent of each aspirant.
