# WOMEN'S BASKET-BALL TO BE RESUMED NEXT SEMESTER.
## 
### 
Early this semester, intercollegiate
basket-ball relations were taken from
the Stanford girls provisionally for
one year and perhaps for a longer per
iod. Basket-ball had been played here
by a few interested girls who wanted
to try to "beat California." The com
mittee thought that it was not the
proper thing to have so few represent
a college of five hundred girls, so it
was taken from them as an intercol
legiate sport.
This semester there has been com
paratively little interest shown by the
girls in general, while at the Univer
sity of California the interest in bas
ket-ball has been greater than usual.
They have had many enthusiastic class
games, and in addition have entered
into relations with the University of
Nevada and several northern schools.
It is expected that the girls will
show their Stanford spirit next se
mester, as in former years. Class
games will oe played about the middle
of February, and class representatives
have been appointed as follows: Miss
H. Batcheller, '1-1, Miss R. Eeeley, '13,
and Miss R. Overman, '12. The sched
ule for other games will be announced
the first of. next semester.
