## SCENES FULL OF LOCAL COLOR AND CATCHY MUSIC Manuscript of Forbes, McDonald and Miss Herdman Chosen by Opera Committee. 
### 
"The Uvernian Princess" is the title
Vt tin' opera which "will open the i'es-
Trm'les of ' JunioT'Week "next
semester. The musie of this composi
tion is the work ol Miss M. Herdman,
ex-'li;, an<i -L MaeDonald, .'l4. and the
libretto is that ol J. Korbes, '13.
The $.10 prize offered by the. Class pf
has been awarded to the authors
by the Opera Committee as a result
of their selection.
Two original manuscripts were con
sidered by the committee. Both are of
an exceptionally high standard and are
full of catchy music and clever lines.
The opera chosen is better adapted
lor a Junior performance than the
other. E. E. Chase, '11, W. S. Wilson,
13, and P. Eliel, '13, deserve special
commendation for their opera. The
committee found it exceedingly diffi
cult to choose between the two, and
only did so after a lengthy discussion
of the merits of the two compositions.
In"The Uvernian Princess" is found
every variety of music from classic
to ragtime. All of it is the work of the
authors themselves, none having been
adapted. Seventeen clever songs and
several dance numbers are included in
the list.
The opera is composed of two acts.
The first is laid on the campus during
Junior Week and is made up of a
Quad scene and a Prom scene. The
latter is the best* scene of the opera
and shows part of the interior of En
cina Hall on the gala Junior night.
This act will be full of local hits on
prominent students. The second act
carries the action to Uvernia, a fanci
ful island kingdom in the Pacific.
Fourteen principals and a large
chorus carry out the action. The main
story is the capture of the heart of
Ashley Moore, a typical Stanford ath
lete of the non-queener type, by Adal
heid Armestoy, a princess of Uvernia
and graduate of Smith. They meet at
Stanford and love finally triumphs in
Uvernia, where the hero follows his
love, accompanied by the rest of the
cast.
The chorus work is exceptionally
good. Varsity girls, Senior girls,
queening girls, Uvernian girls in na
tive costume, and many other kinds of
girls are on the stage all through the
show, and in action all the time. Some
very clever dances are introduced the
music of which is exceedingly catchy.
These will be features of the perfor
mance. One resembles somewhat tho
famous Merry Widow waltz.
