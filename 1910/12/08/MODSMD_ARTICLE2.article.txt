# SUNDELL MAY NOT BE ABLE TO GO NORTH.
## Wing Forward Called South.â€” Backfield Will Probably be Strengthened by Second Teams. 
### 
A. L. Sundell, '12, received word
from his attorneys today, summoning
him to appear in Los Angeles on im
portant business matters relating to
his father's estate. Sundell will leave
for the southland on Monday and will
probably be unable to accompany the
Varsity on their Canadian trip.
The loss of the speedy roamer will
leave a hole in the Varsity fighting
force that will be hard to fill.
The pack which Coach Presley will
have to choose from ensures a power
ful forward unit, capable of more than
holding its own with the northern
metropolitans. The backfield propo
sition will be a hard nut. for Coach
Presley to crack, already badly weak
ened by the loss of the fearless sec
ond-five Reeves and his steady pas
sing mate Mitchell, at center. Brown
as rear guard at full will also be un

able to go. With the rich material,
which the second team always has to
offer in emergencies, it may be de
pended upon that v strong fighting
unit will be developed by Presley be
fore the Varsity goes north.
