Young ladies of the University
will take possession of the Quad
and nearby points of vantage to
morrow morning, to sell tickets
for the benefit championship
game of the post season series,
which will be played on Satur
day. The receipts of this game
are to go to a student, whose leg
was seriously broken in a prelim
inary game.
The Breakers and Coyotes, who
are the rivals in the struggle for
premier honors in the deciding
game of the group rugby series,
have been practicing nearly every
day and the feeling in the rival
camps runs high.
