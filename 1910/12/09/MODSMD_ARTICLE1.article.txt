# WILL PLAY OFF THIELE TOURNAMENT NEXT YEAR.
## Rain Causes Postponment of Tennis Matches.â€”May Rebuild the Encina Courts. 
### 
On accounts of the rains during the
thanksgiving vacation, it was found
impossible to play the Thiele and
interclass doubles tennis tournaments
during that recess. Since that time,
the approach ot examination week has
prevented the men from contesting
regularly, and as a result, only two
rounds have been completed. Acting
under these circumstances and in or
der to give all the entries a chance to
participate for the cup, the executive
committee of the Tennis Club has de
cided to postpone both tournaments
until immediately after the holidays.
All players, however, who can arrange
to finish their matches before the end
of this semester are asked to do so as
it will help to keep these postponed
tournaments from interfering with the
Varsity try-outs next semester.
A movement is also on foot to re
build the tennis courts, which are in a
very poor condition. H. S. Morgan,
'12, president of the Tennis Club, ap
peared before the Executive Commit
tee at its last meeting and laid the
tentative plans of the club before
that body. The committee instructed
him to obtain further information re
garding the cost of the necessary im
provements and report at the first
meeting next semester.
The plan at present is to surface all
the courts with asphalt, similar to that
used by the Peninsula Club of Palo
Alto and on the new University of
California courts.
