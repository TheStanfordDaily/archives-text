Despite the fact that examinations
are close at hand and that the end of
the semester is approaching, there
should be sufficient leisure time for
the Student Body to show their ap
preciation of the benefit game tomor
row afternoon. Every effort has been
made by those in charge to make the
event an enjoyable one, â€”introducing
every possible element for the enter
tainment of those who will appear up
on the bleachers. Although the re
sults of the ticket sale during the week
have not been ascertained, we feel cer
tain that sufficient interest, has been
manifested to already warrant a sub
stantial success of the movement.
The attendance at the game tomorrow
should swell this sum to a much great
er amount and realize a large sum in
the aggregate. Presence at the game
will not only add materially toward
completing a benefit campaign aus
piciously begun, but will, in addition,
prove to those who launched the post
season rugby series, that their plan
has met with success from every
standpoint. The institution is a
worthy one to be continued and it is
to be hoped that the attendance at the
final game of the present schedule to
morrow will amply manifest the inter
est that should be taken in these con
tests.
