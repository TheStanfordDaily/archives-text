# TRI-STATE LEAGUE WILL DEBATE SHIP SUBSIDIES.
## Secretary Hilton Casts Deciding Vote for Question Submitted by Oregon. 
### 
F. H. Hilton, '11, announces that a
decision has been reached in regard to
the question for use in the contests of
the newly formed Tri-state Debating
League, which includes the universi
ties of Washington, Oregon and Stan
ford. The debaters will deal with the
matter of ship-subsidies, but the speci
fic wording of the question is now to
be reached by agreemnt among the
three institutions, or, if this is im
possible, by choice of the secretary.
In selecting the above topic, each
university submitted its first, second
and third choice on three questions,
but as this voting resulted in a dead
lock, it became the duty of Hilton as
secretary of the league to cast the de
ciding vote, and he chose the question
proposed by the University of Oregon.
Each member of the association is to
have an affirmative and negative team
of two men each. Stanford's nega
tive team will debate Washington at
Seattle, while Oregon's men will jour
ney to Stanford to meet our affirmative
speakers. The debates will take place
the last Friday in March, the try-outs
being held early in the coming se
mester in order that the men selected
may have ample time for preparation.
