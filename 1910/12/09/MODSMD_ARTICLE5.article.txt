# CAPTAIN CHEDA WILL PLAY FIVE-MAN SCRUM TOMORROW
## Coyotes Will Assume New Battle Array in Championship Struggle With Breakers in Saturday's Benefit Game. 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon the long her
alded championship match and annual
struggle between the Coyotes and
Breakers will culminate the after-sea
son rugby series on Stanford Field at
2:30 o'clock. This set-to promises to
be one of the hardest fought struggles
between two local teams that, has evtfr
been witnessed upon Stanford Field.
The game, postponed from last Satur
day, has aroused a keener spirit of
rivalry and the fact that the turkey
dinner wagered on llie results of this
game, has already been eaten, has
raised the fighting spirit of the oppos
ing camps to the highest pitch.
Out of all this turmoil of keen rival
ry conies a new plan of action for to
morrow's struggle. Captain "Here"
Cheda, of the Coyotes, today announc
ed a new plan of campaign, one en
tirely different from any that has ever
been seen in the United States. Cheda's
brilliant plan of battle hinges upon
the utilizing of his superior scrum in
such a wey as to balance the Breaker's
superior backfield unity. A five man
scrum will be used, the rear rankers
of the seven man scrum being used
as roamers, their position being diag
onal to the rear of the scrum. These
two new positions are called wing and
king rovers, and practically gives
three halfbacks to the Coyotes. With
such a formation, four roamers, —
three halves and a wing forward, are
ready for instant action when their
opponents secure the ball and should
prove effective in blanketing the
Breakers backfield when they begin
action.
The successful ticket selling cam
paign waged on tlie Quad today by the
young ladies, promises the attendance
of well filled bleachers during tomor
rows benefit game. The sum will go
to A. O. Gragg as a help towards pay

ing the heavy bills which have result
ed from his confinement in the Pen
insula Hospital after he sustained a
broken leg in one of the preliminary
games. The amount will be swelled
tomorrow by the selling of popcorn
and peanuts on the bleachers by the
young ladies who conducted the Quad
campaign this morning. All those who
have not purchased tickets as yet, will
be given an opportunity at the gates
tomorrow, the advertised price of
twenty-five cents prevailing.
Captain Nolan, of the Breakers ag
gregation, has announced the same
line-up, with the exception of the ad
dition of Watkins to his scrum. The
plans of each captain now seem com
plete, unless some eleventh hour sur
prises are to be sprung.
The Stanford Band will be a head
line feature of tomorrow's program
and an extensive reportoire is promised
by the management. Many new com
positions will be played by the musi
cians tomorrow for the first time.
The halves will be of thirty minutes
duration and the kickoff is scheduled
to begin promptly at 2:30. The com
mittee have been able to secure the
services of Coach Presley as referee.

touch judges.
