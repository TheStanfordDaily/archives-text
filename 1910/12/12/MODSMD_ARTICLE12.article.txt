Post season rugby as conducted dur
ing the past few weeks has met with
unqualified success, not only from the
point of view of those who took part
in the completion of the schedule, but
also with those who were in the
bleachers during the progress of the
games. The institution has aroused
and continued the interest in the Stu
dent Body with regard to the principal
major sport after the intercollegiate
game has been played. With every
other athletic activity of the same
standing as rugby dormant, this plan
allowed much attention to be devoted
to the schedule. The series also pre
sented opportunities for many who do
not appear upon the field to take part
in the season's football work, to learn
and play the game. If this does not
affect the efficiency of some of the
material that will appear next season,
it will, at least, improve the spectator's
interest in the contests by increasing
their technical knowledge and their
general conception of the rules of
rugby. The schedule has met with
such success this year that it is to be
hoped that the Executive Committee of
1911 will see fit to continue the custom
and make arrangements for a second
trial of this institution.
