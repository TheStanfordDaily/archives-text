# PREACHER SPEAKS ON CHRISTIANITY
## REV. MATT HUGHES PRESENTS INTERESTING SUBJECT. Southern Divine Shows Distinctive Differences Between Christ's Tenets and Other Doctrines. 
### 
"Never a man spake as this man,"
was the text chosen by the Rev. Matt
Hughes, of Pasadena, who delivered
the morning sermon at the University
Chapel yesterdtfy. Taking up the dis
cussion ot the origliiajity of the teach
ings of Christ and the relation between
the originality of a doctrine and its
truth, he showed that while Christian
ity gathered together all the great
moral and spiritual truths of all na
tions and all times, yet it was distinct
ly different from any religion ever pro
pounded.
The speaker stated that of late years
the originality of Christianity has been
challenged. Various books have been
written purposing to prove that the
doctrine of Christ adds nothing to the
world's stock of moral and religious
truths. Attempts to strike at the
truth of Christianity through this ar
gument are met with the fact that
denial of originality has naught to do
with the truth of a doctrine.
The allegation that Christianity is a
patch work of teachings of philosoph
ers and the doctrines found in other
religions, said the speaker, presup
poses two things, namely, that such
teachings and doctrines existed before
the coming of Christ, and that he had
access to them.
Rev. Hughes insisted that the ques
tion "Does Christianity correspond as
a whole with any other system of re
ligion?" was most pertinent in this
connection. Because individual pre
cepts of other doctrines may be found
among Christ's teachings does not in
dicate plagarism from those teachings.
"Truths may be found in every doc
trine," continued the speaker, â€” "so
briety is an essential part of a prize
fighter's creed and we have heard of
honor among thieves."
Christ, when he came into the world,
found man a moral creature, distin
guishing right from wrong, but all the
pondering and meditation of men he
found to be greatly imperfect. The
marvel of the Christian religion, it
was pointed out, is that it includes ab
solutely all the great moral precepts
into one complete scheme. Not a sin
gle moral truth was omitted by the
Nazarene in his teaching, and not a
single essential moral or spiritual
truth has been discovered since his
time.
Shakespeare, declared the preacher,
out of old dramas and stories created a
new sphere of thought and literature;
Ho who possessed the most wisdom
was, to the ancient philosophers, the
most perfect man; Love in Christ's
teachings holds the predominant place
.'is chief of all virtues. In the first,
intellect is exalted, leaving the heart
cold and bare; in the latter teaching
love is the force that binds man to bis
Maker and fellow man.
"The character of Christ finally and
truly is a part of the morality of the
Gospel," continued the speaker. "No
where can a great moral teacher be

found who has declared as did Christ,
'I am the Truth,' and nowhere one who
makes the measure of duty his own
love and service to humanity."
