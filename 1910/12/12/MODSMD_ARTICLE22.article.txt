# PROFESSOR WOODWARD ACTIVE IN ASSOCIATION.
## Head of Law School Introduces Proposed Measures at Meeting of Members of California Bar. 
### 
Professor F. C. Woodward, head of
the Law School, returned Friday Tram
Los Angeles, where he attended the
annual meeting of the California State
Bar Association. Professor Woodward
read a paper upon "Legal Education in
California" and also presented the re
port of the Bar Association's commit
tee on legal education, of which he is
chairman. This report recommended
radical changes in the requirements
for admission to the bar. It proposed
an amendment to the existing law by
providing for the establishment of a
State Board of Law Examiners to con
duct the examinations in place of the
judges of the district court of appeals,
who perform that duty at the present
time. According to the reform all can
didates must prove to the satisfaction
of the Board that they have studied
law for at least three years. The
examinations under this system would
undoubtedly be more thorough than at
present.
This report was adopted by the as
sociation and a bill embodying its
recommendations will be introduced at
the opening of the State Legislature
in January. The proposed law will
not, however, interfere with the pres
ent provision allowing holders of
diplomas from the Stanford Law de
partment admission to the bar without
examination.
Among the San Francisco delegates
to the meeting of the association, were
J. L. Lanagan, '00, E. A. Lane and L.
Macomber. Judge Bledsoe, '96, of San
Bernardino, also took an important
part in the work of the meeting.
On Wednesday evening a banquet
for the Stanford law graduates was
held at the new quarters of the Uni
versity Club. Over forty Stanford men
were present and much enthusiasm
was shown. Talks were given by Judge
Bledsoe, Professor Woodward, Lana
gan and Lane.
