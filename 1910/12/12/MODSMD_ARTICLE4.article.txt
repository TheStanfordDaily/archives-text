# BREAKERS WIN HOTLY FOUGHT BATTLE FROM COYOTE FIFTEEN
## F. C. Brown Kicks Goal and Scores Only Points that Are Made During Afternoon's Hard Struggle. 
### 
The Breaker and the Coyote clubs
played what was virtually a tie strug
gle in rugby for the post season cham
pionship last Saturday. The contest
was won by the Breakers with a 3-Q
score, but the victory came from the
individual Star playing of full-back
Brown, who drop-kicked a penalty
goal from, the 30-yard line. The kick
came as a result of one of the few
offenses against the rules on the part
of the Coyotes. Over three-quarters
of the free kicks in the game were
against their opponents, the Breakers,
and it was the 60-yard kicking ot'
Crawford for the \Yhite-C men that
kept the advantage equal between the
two fifteens.
Keen Rivalry is Shown,
The line-ups were composed by over
half of Cardinal Varsity and second
team players, and this taken together
with the undying rivalry of the two
eating clubs, turned the contest into a
never-say-ilie battle seldom seen on
the turf. Only intercollegiate matches
could bring out the fight and spirit
that was running wild on the field
Saturday. Goal-lines were alternately
threatened and defended valiantly dur
ing the space of every five minutes
during the game. The Breakers pos
sessed the surer and more perfected
backfield. The Coyotes had individual
stars among forwards and backs, but
their unique and fantastic five-man
formation in the scrum was a total
failure. Tt did no execution and should
have been changed when its ineffi
ciency was seen. Crawford and Frank
as extra roamers did no more than
they would have done had they been
lending strength directly to helping
behind the pack.
Individuals are Stars,
The opposing half-backs, Tallant
and Elliott, were good. With the ex
ception of Brown, who proved to be in
a separate class, they were the stars
of the game. \V. E. Smith, of the Coy
otes, and R. M. Brown, of the Break
ers, although diminutive, fought from

whistle to whistle. R. M. Brown's un
ending assault secured him an injury
in the second hah', and he was with
drawn from his team. Captains Nolan
and Cheda were fighters, the one to
keep victory, the other to keep off
defeat.
There was not a single player, how
ever, who did not do his duty, and in
that respect, the game was a record
one. The teams and their exhibition
deserved better support in the number
of spectators. About one hundred en
thusiasts defied the drizzling rain and
occupied the bleachers. It is prob
ably weather alone that kept away a
large crowd.
Hrown Kicks («onl.
Brown's drop-kick, and the only
three points of the game, came at a
time of particularly stubborn battling.
The Coyotes were in one minute on
the Yellow-B 10-yard line after a
clever run by Tallant from the 30.
The leather went over in a free-for-all
scramble and in the jumble Brown
saved for the Breakers. The next
plays that landed the ball on the Coy
ote 15 were all Brown. From his
drop-out he kicked to midfield, and
Frank dribbled back to the 35. Brown
then marked at his 45 and touched at
the White-C 25-yard line. Following
this the oval went almost to the Mne,
but Carpenter kicked out at his 15.
The Coyotes were penalized. Brown
fell back 15 yards to the 30 and from
there skimmed the cross-bar for the
score, 3-0.
The line-ups were: Breakers —Grace,
R.M. Brown, Boyd, Watkins, M. Brown,
Nolan, Worthington, forwards; "Wood
cock, wing forward; Elliott, half; Tay

a separate class, they were the stars
of the game. \V. E. Smith, of the Coy
otes, and R. M. Brown, of the Break
ers, although diminutive, fought from

whistle to whistle. R. M. Brown's un
ending assault secured him an injury
in the second hah', and he was with
drawn from his team. Captains Nolan
and Cheda were fighters, the one to
keep victory, the other to keep off
defeat.
There was not a single player, how
ever, who did not do his duty, and in
that respect, the game was a record
one. The teams and their exhibition
deserved better support in the number
of spectators. About one hundred en
thusiasts defied the drizzling rain and
occupied the bleachers. It is prob
ably weather alone that kept away a
large crowd.
Hrown Kicks («onl.
Brown's drop-kick, and the only
three points of the game, came at a
time of particularly stubborn battling.
The Coyotes were in one minute on
the Yellow-B 10-yard line after a
clever run by Tallant from the 30.
The leather went over in a free-for-all
scramble and in the jumble Brown
saved for the Breakers. The next
plays that landed the ball on the Coy
ote 15 were all Brown. From his
drop-out he kicked to midfield, and
Frank dribbled back to the 35. Brown
then marked at his 45 and touched at
the White-C 25-yard line. Following
this the oval went almost to the Mne,
but Carpenter kicked out at his 15.
The Coyotes were penalized. Brown
fell back 15 yards to the 30 and from
there skimmed the cross-bar for the
score, 3-0.
The line-ups were: Breakers —Grace,
R.M. Brown, Boyd, Watkins, M. Brown,
Nolan, Worthington, forwards; "Wood
cock, wing forward; Elliott, half; Tay
lor, Milsap, fives; Dooling, center;
Campbell, Wilcox, wings; F. C. Brown,
full.
Coyotes—G. E. Cheda, W. E. Smith,
Rutherford, Davis, Horton, forwards;
Crawford, wing rover; Frank, kinx
rover; Boulware, wing forward; Tal
lant, half; H. P. Cheda, Bellah, fives-
H. Smith, center; Bianci, Chandler,
wings; Carpenter, full.
The Breaker and the Coyote clubs
played what was virtually a tie strug
gle in rugby for the post season cham
pionship last Saturday. The contest
was won by the Breakers with a 3-Q
score, but the victory came from the
individual Star playing of full-back
Brown, who drop-kicked a penalty
goal from, the 30-yard line. The kick
came as a result of one of the few
offenses against the rules on the part
of the Coyotes. Over three-quarters
of the free kicks in the game were
against their opponents, the Breakers,
and it was the 60-yard kicking ot'
Crawford for the \Yhite-C men that
kept the advantage equal between the
two fifteens.
Keen Rivalry is Shown,
The line-ups were composed by over
half of Cardinal Varsity and second
team players, and this taken together
with the undying rivalry of the two
eating clubs, turned the contest into a
never-say-ilie battle seldom seen on
the turf. Only intercollegiate matches
could bring out the fight and spirit
that was running wild on the field
Saturday. Goal-lines were alternately
threatened and defended valiantly dur
ing the space of every five minutes
during the game. The Breakers pos
sessed the surer and more perfected
backfield. The Coyotes had individual
stars among forwards and backs, but
their unique and fantastic five-man
formation in the scrum was a total
failure. Tt did no execution and should
have been changed when its ineffi
ciency was seen. Crawford and Frank
as extra roamers did no more than
they would have done had they been
lending strength directly to helping
behind the pack.
Individuals are Stars,
The opposing half-backs, Tallant
and Elliott, were good. With the ex
ception of Brown, who proved to be in
a separate class, they were the stars
of the game. \V. E. Smith, of the Coy
