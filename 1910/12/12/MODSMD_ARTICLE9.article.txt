# SOCCER SQUAD IS AGAIN VICTORIOUS
## ENCINA GYMNASIUM TEAM DEFEATS INDEPENDENTS. Speedy Combination in Local Organization Proves too Fast for Oakland Players. 
### 
In a rather slow game, devoid of any
real team work, the Encina Soccer
teata were able Saturday to reverse
their defeat of November at the Jiuihlk
of the Oakland Independents, by win
ning with a 2 to 0 score. The rains or
the previous day and night made the
field so slippery that team work, or
passing, was out of the question for
either team, but the greater speed of
the forwards In dribbling, overcame
this for the locals, and as a result, the
ball was almost continually in their
opponents' territory.
Tally Made by Higgins.
Neither side was able to score until
the latter part of the first half, when
on a line kick by Higgins, the Indepen
dent's goal keeper fumbled the ball
and allowed it to roll into the net.
The second tally was made on a
fluke near the end of the second half,
when the Independent's goal keeper in
kicking out a hard shot by Erb kicked
it against Fyfe's head, from which it
bounced into the goal. Only twice was
the Encina goal in any real danger,
the first of these was on a penalty kick
allowed for a foul on Clyde, but which
the Independent's were unable to con
vert and the second was when with i
practically clear field, the inside right
for strangers had a clear shot, for the
local goal, but overkicked.
Combination of Team Strong.
The line-up was the same as a week
ago and was by far the best combina
tion yet turned out by Instructor Ma
loney. The Fyfe-Williams combina
tion on the right wing was through
out the entire game an almost unsolv
able puzzle for the Independent's back
field, while Higgins, whenever he had
the ball in his possession, kept their
goal-keeper ever busy with his hard
dirves from the left wing. Erb at,
center forward played by far the i >>st
individual game, his dribbling being
above the average and his defensive
work being by far the strongest of any
man on the field. — .w
The winning of this game adds two
more points to the local's already
good average and if they can only
take the Soldiers into camp on Wed
nesday they will be well up among the
leaders.
Two (James to be Played,
Two games yet remain to be played
before the soccer season is over for
the Encina team. The first of these is
with the United States soldiers on
next Wednesday afternoon and the
second is with the crack Thistle team
on Saturday. These two games will
terminate the season till after the holi
days, as far as the local team is con
cerned as the next game is scheduled
for January 7 with the Pastime Club of
San Francisco.
Saturday's line-up was as follows:
Higgins, Pung, Erb, Fyfe, and King,
forwards; Clyde, Reynolds, Humph
reys, halt's; McCann, (capt.) and King,
fulls; Stuart, goal.
