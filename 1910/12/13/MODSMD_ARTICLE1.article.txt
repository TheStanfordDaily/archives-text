# STANFORD CREW WILL HAVE MANY VETERANS AS NUCLEUS
## Prospects for Strong Varsity and Freshman Eights in 1911 Season Show Experienced Men in Both Boats. 
### 
With the of boating
upon an intercoliegiate basis, the crew
men are already making preparations
for the coming season. At present it
looks as though all the members, ex
cept three, of last season's Varsity and
Freshmen crews would he in college
next semester. This makes the out
look for a successful year exceedingly
bright. In addition to these men, there
will be registered a number of the
1909 crew, who were not out for the
sport this year.
The Lagunita Boat Club, which con
trolled boating this year, has been dis
solved and full directive powers over
the sport have been assumed by the
Executive Committee. Boating under
the present ruling is to be allowed a
maximum sum of $1000 from the funds
controlled by the Executive Committee
for equipment and running expenses.
Lake Lagunita will be filled as soon
us possible next semester and active
work among the crew men will com
mence as soon as ihis is accomplished.
The boat house and equipment are to
be placed in perfect shape during- the
Christmas holidays, so that every
thing will be ready in plenty of time
for the opening of the season. The
popularization of the sport by giving
everyone an equal chance to row,
which resulted in such a large squad
last season, will be carried out again.
Under this system, men who have
never bandied an oar will become
quite proficient before the season is
far advanced.

The same system of coaching which
prevailed last spring will be used this
coming season. There will be,no pro
fessional coach, the work of instruc
tion being undertaken by Captain K. L.
Schaupp, '12, and a committee com
posed of men of several season's ex
perience. The large number of old
men who will be on the water again
next spring will materially lessen the
task of the coaching committee in
showing the new men the form and
stroke, which Stanford crews have
found so effiective in the past. As
Soon as the new men have been taught
the theoretical side of the work, they
will be placed in tlid boat with the old
men and in this way they will rapidly
acquire rowing form. Training on the
rowing machines, cross country run
ning, and other forms of exercise will
commence soon after registration day.
The prospect of turning out a strong
Freshman crew i-s very bright. There
are several men who have had experi
ence on the water among the first year
students and these will form the nucle
us around which to build up a strong
crew. It is the intention to form an
eight-oared crew, instead of a four, as
last season, if enough material turns
out. All Freshmen who are interested
in rowing whether they have ever
pulled an oar or not, are urged to turn
out.
The following members of last
year's winning Varsity expect to be in
college next spring: R. R. Hails, '12,
R. H. Seward, '12, C. L. Schaupp, '12,
R. R. Gilmore, '12, .T. F. Partridge, '12,
and L. Hofer, '13. All the members of
the victorious Freshmen crew intend
to return. These are: R. W. Olm
stead, J. S. Grepe, .Ir., R. F. Duryea,
C. If. Heal, and L. H. Marks. With
these men to start with, no difficulty
should lie experienced in building up a
winning Varsity.
The crew men at the University of
California will follow out a system of
work almost similar to the one to be
used here. They are not handicapped,
however, by a lack of a large stretch
of water to row upon as are the local
men. Their rowing is done entirely
on the Oakland Estuary, the scene of
the regattas of the last two years.
Plans are already being made look
ing forward to a regatta at Seattle for
the Pacific Coast championship to be
held over the Lake Washington course
in the late spring. The race last May
was won by Washington. This year it
is planned to have a regatta composed
of a Varsity and a Freshman race be
tween crews from Stanford, California
and Washington. The allowance of
seven days for the races would in
sure smooth water for the contests.

found so effiective in the past. As
Soon as the new men have been taught
the theoretical side of the work, they
will be placed in tlid boat with the old
men and in this way they will rapidly
acquire rowing form. Training on the
rowing machines, cross country run
ning, and other forms of exercise will
commence soon after registration day.
The prospect of turning out a strong
Freshman crew i-s very bright. There
are several men who have had experi
ence on the water among the first year
students and these will form the nucle
us around which to build up a strong
crew. It is the intention to form an
eight-oared crew, instead of a four, as
last season, if enough material turns
out. All Freshmen who are interested
in rowing whether they have ever
pulled an oar or not, are urged to turn
out.
The following members of last
year's winning Varsity expect to be in
college next spring: R. R. Hails, '12,
R. H. Seward, '12, C. L. Schaupp, '12,
R. R. Gilmore, '12, .T. F. Partridge, '12,
and L. Hofer, '13. All the members of
the victorious Freshmen crew intend
to return. These are: R. W. Olm
stead, J. S. Grepe, .Ir., R. F. Duryea,
C. If. Heal, and L. H. Marks. With
these men to start with, no difficulty
should lie experienced in building up a
winning Varsity.
The crew men at the University of
California will follow out a system of
work almost similar to the one to be
used here. They are not handicapped,
however, by a lack of a large stretch
of water to row upon as are the local
men. Their rowing is done entirely
on the Oakland Estuary, the scene of
the regattas of the last two years.
Plans are already being made look
ing forward to a regatta at Seattle for
the Pacific Coast championship to be
held over the Lake Washington course
in the late spring. The race last May
was won by Washington. This year it
is planned to have a regatta composed
of a Varsity and a Freshman race be
tween crews from Stanford, California
and Washington. The allowance of
seven days for the races would in
sure smooth water for the contests.
With the of boating
upon an intercoliegiate basis, the crew
men are already making preparations
for the coming season. At present it
looks as though all the members, ex
cept three, of last season's Varsity and
Freshmen crews would he in college
next semester. This makes the out
look for a successful year exceedingly
bright. In addition to these men, there
will be registered a number of the
1909 crew, who were not out for the
sport this year.
The Lagunita Boat Club, which con
trolled boating this year, has been dis
solved and full directive powers over
the sport have been assumed by the
Executive Committee. Boating under
the present ruling is to be allowed a
maximum sum of $1000 from the funds
controlled by the Executive Committee
for equipment and running expenses.
Lake Lagunita will be filled as soon
us possible next semester and active
work among the crew men will com
mence as soon as ihis is accomplished.
The boat house and equipment are to
be placed in perfect shape during- the
Christmas holidays, so that every
thing will be ready in plenty of time
for the opening of the season. The
popularization of the sport by giving
everyone an equal chance to row,
which resulted in such a large squad
last season, will be carried out again.
Under this system, men who have
never bandied an oar will become
quite proficient before the season is
far advanced.

The same system of coaching which
prevailed last spring will be used this
coming season. There will be,no pro
fessional coach, the work of instruc
tion being undertaken by Captain K. L.
Schaupp, '12, and a committee com
posed of men of several season's ex
perience. The large number of old
men who will be on the water again
next spring will materially lessen the
task of the coaching committee in
showing the new men the form and
stroke, which Stanford crews have
found so effiective in the past. As
