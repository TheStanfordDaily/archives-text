# STRONG TRACK TEAM ASSURED BY POINT WINNERS' RETURN
## Stanford Well Represented in Sprints, Distances and Field Events.â€”Hurdles Weakest Spot in Team. 
### 
With fourteen point-winners of last
year's victorious track team eligible
to participate in the 1911 Intercolle
giate meet, the coming season on the
cinder path bids fair to end in another
victory. Having this excellent group
of athletes around which to develop a
championship team, Captain Bellali
feels very sanguine of the outcome and
predicts that unless unforseen acci
dents cripple the men and prevent
them from competing, California will
have to produce a record breaking
outfit to annex the long end of the
score.
Coleman will again be the Cardinal
mainstay in the sprints and it is
difficult to see how the lengthy Junior
can be headed in these events. Cali
fornia, however, has a speed marvel
in Wood, the freshman from Berkeley,
but the only chance the youngster has
is in the hundred. H. Smitherum, '11.
R. W. Wilcox, '13, and E. P. Geissler,
'14, will also have to be figured in the
outcome of the sprints.
The record-holder Wyman, can be
depended upon for five points in the
quarter. As he is accredited with
close to forty-nine seconds in this
race, California scarcely can hope to
defeat the Cardinal athlete. R. B.
Carter, '12, C. C. Taylor, '11, J. H.
Thoburn, '13, and H. W. Dawson, '14,
are the fastest of the quarter-milers
now in sight and will be called upon to
develop second and third place win
ners. Carter and Talor will probably
be saved for the relay team.

liythe half mile and mile runs, the
team will be rather weak, as only a
few men have shown any ability in
these events. J. H. Lehman, '13, and
N. R. Ferguson, '13, are the best men
in sight for the shorter race. Both
men run in good form, but last year
scarcely possessed the necessary
strength for the gruelling contest. If
their powers of endurance have de
veloped, they will be valuable assets
to the team. L. H. Price, '13, who
added three points to last year's score
by running second to Saxon in the
mile, will again be called upon in that
event. Price is a comer and will bear
watching. K. L. Lee, '12, is the most
promising candidate in the mile, how
ever, and if he rounds into shape will
make a strong bid to lead the pack
home.
The weakest spot in the whole team
will as usual be in the hurdles. Only
two men now seem to have the ability
to make good in these events. Gene
Kern, '13, and H. G. McGuire, '13 are
the sole survivors. Kern, it' his in
jured leg is in shape, will undoubtedly
capture some points, but his ability
to train next spring is questioned.
Stanford will be able to put up a
strong fight in the field events and
should annex the majority of points.
K. L. Dole, '11, J. E. Woolley, '12, and
C. E. Olmstead, '14, will make a for
midable trio in the weight events.
Woolley and Dole liavp already shown
their ability while Olmstead comes
with a prep, school reputation as a
good man in the shot-put.
The strongest contingent of athletes
on the field will represent the Cardinal
in the jumps. H. L. Horine, '13, W.
M. Argabrite, '13, and R. J. Finnie, '12,
are three jumpers capable of six feet
in the high jump. Finney is a new
man to the track, having appeared for
the first time this fall, when he im
mediately showed his ability by clear
ing the height of 5 feet, 11-M inches.
Captain S. H. Bellah, '10, and C. H.
Tallant, '11, were good enough to
annex places in the broad-jump at
the last Intercollegiate meet and
should be able to duplicate the per
formance.
There is i\ wealth of material for
Captain Bellah and Trainer Moult on to
work on in the pole vault. Besides
V. J. Stevens, '13, and J. A. Miller, '13,
members of last year's squad and both
capable of doing over 11 feet, there
are several men who bid fair to de
velop into van Iters. \V. E. Gatewood,
'12, and C. L. Boulware, '14, have both
cleared 11 feet, 6 inches and under
the able coaching of Captain Bellah
will probably take second and third
places in the meet. Captain Bellah,

Woolley and Dole liavp already shown
their ability while Olmstead comes
with a prep, school reputation as a
good man in the shot-put.
The strongest contingent of athletes
on the field will represent the Cardinal
in the jumps. H. L. Horine, '13, W.
M. Argabrite, '13, and R. J. Finnie, '12,
are three jumpers capable of six feet
in the high jump. Finney is a new
man to the track, having appeared for
the first time this fall, when he im
mediately showed his ability by clear
ing the height of 5 feet, 11-M inches.
Captain S. H. Bellah, '10, and C. H.
Tallant, '11, were good enough to
annex places in the broad-jump at
the last Intercollegiate meet and
should be able to duplicate the per
formance.
There is i\ wealth of material for
Captain Bellah and Trainer Moult on to
work on in the pole vault. Besides
V. J. Stevens, '13, and J. A. Miller, '13,
members of last year's squad and both
capable of doing over 11 feet, there
are several men who bid fair to de
velop into van Iters. \V. E. Gatewood,
'12, and C. L. Boulware, '14, have both
cleared 11 feet, 6 inches and under
the able coaching of Captain Bellah
will probably take second and third
places in the meet. Captain Bellah,
himself has done some training dur-
With fourteen point-winners of last
year's victorious track team eligible
to participate in the 1911 Intercolle
giate meet, the coming season on the
cinder path bids fair to end in another
victory. Having this excellent group
of athletes around which to develop a
championship team, Captain Bellali
feels very sanguine of the outcome and
predicts that unless unforseen acci
dents cripple the men and prevent
them from competing, California will
have to produce a record breaking
outfit to annex the long end of the
score.
Coleman will again be the Cardinal
mainstay in the sprints and it is
difficult to see how the lengthy Junior
can be headed in these events. Cali
fornia, however, has a speed marvel
in Wood, the freshman from Berkeley,
but the only chance the youngster has
is in the hundred. H. Smitherum, '11.
R. W. Wilcox, '13, and E. P. Geissler,
'14, will also have to be figured in the
outcome of the sprints.
The record-holder Wyman, can be
depended upon for five points in the
quarter. As he is accredited with
close to forty-nine seconds in this
race, California scarcely can hope to
defeat the Cardinal athlete. R. B.
Carter, '12, C. C. Taylor, '11, J. H.
Thoburn, '13, and H. W. Dawson, '14,
are the fastest of the quarter-milers
now in sight and will be called upon to
develop second and third place win
ners. Carter and Talor will probably
be saved for the relay team.

liythe half mile and mile runs, the
team will be rather weak, as only a
few men have shown any ability in
these events. J. H. Lehman, '13, and
N. R. Ferguson, '13, are the best men
in sight for the shorter race. Both
men run in good form, but last year
scarcely possessed the necessary
strength for the gruelling contest. If
their powers of endurance have de
veloped, they will be valuable assets
to the team. L. H. Price, '13, who
added three points to last year's score
by running second to Saxon in the
mile, will again be called upon in that
event. Price is a comer and will bear
watching. K. L. Lee, '12, is the most
promising candidate in the mile, how
ever, and if he rounds into shape will
make a strong bid to lead the pack
home.
The weakest spot in the whole team
will as usual be in the hurdles. Only
two men now seem to have the ability
to make good in these events. Gene
Kern, '13, and H. G. McGuire, '13 are
the sole survivors. Kern, it' his in
jured leg is in shape, will undoubtedly
capture some points, but his ability
to train next spring is questioned.
Stanford will be able to put up a
strong fight in the field events and
should annex the majority of points.
K. L. Dole, '11, J. E. Woolley, '12, and
C. E. Olmstead, '14, will make a for
midable trio in the weight events.
