# CARDINAL TO BE IN FOUR DEBATES
## TRI-STATE LEAGUE ADDS TWO CONTESTS TO LIST. Many Strong Debaters Will Bid for Places on Various Teams. Freshmen are Good Men. 
### 
With the Carnot Debate to be held
between the University of California
and Stanford in early February, will
be opened as busy and as momentous
a forensic season as Cardinal debaters
have as yet taken part, it will be an
especially significent season, in that it
will mark the first of the Tri-State
League debates, which will undoubted
ly be held from now on indefinitely.
A total of four big intercollegiate de
bates, one with the University of Ore
gon on the campus, one with the Uni
versity of Washington at Seattle, the
regular Intercollegiate with the Uni
versity of California at Harmon Gym
nasium and the Carnot in the Assem
bly Hall, will keep the local speakers
on the qui vive.
Judging from the showings which
have been made by the debaters this
semester, and by those still in college,
who were active during the last inter
collegiate season, Stanford should
have no difficulty in filling every posi
tion on the four teams with men cap
able of winning. Ten men are eligible
to win their "S" fobs through the en
largement of the debating field.
One of the most encouraging signs
for the success of the present season
is the wealth of material shown in the
Freshman class. At least, two men
among these new speakers are at
present capable of carrying varsiey
honors and should make strong bids
for the teams. The Senior class at
present, contains but one Varsity de
bater, R. J. Miller, who was a member
of the last Carnot trio. Several other
men, have been close contestants for
the teams in the tryouts and should,
without doubt, be accorded honors
this year.
The Junior class contains several
men of Varsity calibre who will un
doubtedly have the privilege of repre
senting Stanford before the close of
another semester. Only one debater
in this class as yet has succeeded in
officially receiving Varsity recognition,
N. C. Wilson having made alternate
on the Carnot team in his Freshman
year. Wilson, however, is at present
not registered at Stanford. In the
two tryouts in which he has competed
for the Intercollegiate teams, E. E.
Tincher has made very strong bids for
the big trios.
At present, the Freshman class of
fers more Varsity possibilities than
the Sophomore organization. The
showing made by W. B. Owen in the

recent Freshman-Sophomore debate,
marks him as a public speaker of inure
than ordinary ability and the team as
a whole was one showing great pos
sibilities.
