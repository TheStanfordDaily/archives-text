# WILL DUPLICATE CARDINAL EVENT
## CALIFORNIA WOULD ABSORB INTERSCHOLASTIC. Cardinal Committee Arranges to Anticipate Blue and Gold Date by Two Weeks. 
### 
Next spring the University of Cal
ifornia will hold their first Interschol
astic iield meet, and are advertising
that this event in Berkeley will take
the place of the one that has been held
at Stanford for several successive
years. This is by no means the cage,
as the usual meet will be held here
and the similar one, copied by Califor
nia from Stanford, does not replace the
one held on the Stanford oval.
To offset this, the Interscholastic
Board of Control is at work preparing
a vigorous campaign.
The California student body is united
in backing the efforts of their com
mittee and will send invitations to
their event over the entire Pacific
Coast. They propose to pay the rail
road fare of all athletes coming from
outside the state as far as the bound
ary line of California.
The Interscholastic Board of Con
trol decided this afternoon to hold
this year's meet on April 8, one week
before the Intercollegiate Track Meet
on the California oval. This date will
also fall upon the day qf the last In
tercollegiate Baseball game, provided
three games are payed.
This date anticipates the California
Interscholastic by two weeks, the Car
dinal date coming when the track sea-
son is nearing the climax and the Blue
and Gold after interest in cinder work
has passed.
Secretary K. L. Scliaupp, '12, was in
structed to send out invitations to the
high schools along the coast. It is
practically assured, already, that the
northern cities will be represented
here this year.
