# SATURDAY'S GAME NETS LARGE SUM FOR GRAGG.
## One Hundred and Four Dollars Will be Turned Over to Injured Player. 
### 
As a result of the large sale of tick
ets of admittance for the championship
rugby game last Saturday, the net
proceeds of the day amount to $104.
This sum is to be turned over to O. H.
Gragg, whose leg was badly broken in
the preliminary game between Team 3
and Team 5 several weeks before the
conclusion of the schedule.
The accident is the most serious of
the season, and Gragg is still confined
to the hospital. His leg was broken
in two places, and he probably will
not be seen on the campus until the
first of next semester.
