## 
### 
Gymnasium Instructor H. W. Ma
loney has received a communication
from S. Goodman, secretary of the
California Football Association, ex
tending the sympathy of the associa
tion to F. Maltaner, '12, who broke his
leg in a practice game of soccer sev
eral weeks ago. The association has
proffered its aid to assist the injured
player to defray his hospital expenses.
Goodman has suggested that a benefit
game would probably meet with much
success and has offered to assist in ar
ranging such a contest. It is prob
able that the offer of the association
will be accepted by the local soccer
aggregation. In this event a match
game between the leaders of the soc
cer league #iU be held.
