# SOCCER TEAM HAS SUCCESSFUL YEAR
## ENGLISH GAME ENTHUSIASTS MAKE GOOD RECORD. Comparison With Rival Aggregations Presents Prospects for Championship Games. 
### 
At the present writing, the pros
pects of turning out a winning' soccer
team from the Encina Gymnasium
seems very bright. The standing of
the club up to (late is five games lost,
three won and one tied, and when it
is considered that these were nearly
all played when the team was in much
weaker condition than at present, it
speakes well for the chances of the
locals next semester. One of the
teams, the Oaklands, from which the
locals won a decision, has since then
withdrawn from the league, which
sent the team down the line one game.
But as this is also the case with the
other league teams, it does not af
fect the real percentage of Encinas.
At present the Pastimes are leading
the league with 14 points with the
Vampires second with 15, the Thistles
third with 13, the San Franciscos
fourth with 9 and the Encinas fifth
with 7, so if the locals succeed in win
ning the next two games, they will
conclude the season holding down
fourth place. The loss of Gragg was a
serious blow to the local team and for
a while Instructor Maloney was at a
loss how to fill the place vacated by the
speedy junior, but after much practice
and many trials, Higgins, who for
merly played outside right, but who has
an equally good boot with either foot,
was shifted to outside left and Wil
liams, a veteran of last year's team,
was given the position vacated by
Higgins. With the addition of this
strong combination to the already ver
satile trio of Erb, Fyfe and Pung, the
locals now have a combination of drib
blers and passers that is hard to beat.
Except for the addition of Clyde
and King, the line-up in the back field
is the same as the first of the season
and with the two speedy men back in
the game, the local defenders will
be a power to contend with.
