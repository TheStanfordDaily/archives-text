# EIGHTEEN MEN LEAVE FOR VANCOUVER DECEMBER 22
## Star Varsity Scrum to be In Action, While New Backfield Combination Promises Good Results. 
### 
Eighteen men for the next week will
trot out on the turf field daily, mingl
ing .sport with examination anxiety,
preparing to meet the losers of the
British Columbia championship in a
year-end series of rugby matches. The
task before the Cardinal men is by no
means an easy one and the series will
be won only after a hard campaign.
Referee Jenkinson, of Vancouver, who
held the whistle at the Intercollegiate
contest, of a month ago, has picked the
northern aggregation as winners in
the coming series.
Since then a new factor has to be
reckoned with. Did the Varsity men
profit by the recent rugby series? The
playing of Cardinal veterans in these
line-ups were the features of nearly
every game. The aggressiveness or
defence showed by their side hinged
about them. In all phases of rugby
science were the block "S" men to the
fore and when playing together as ;i
Varsity unit again, the benefits of the
recent series will be apparent.
Twenty men, including Coacli Pres
ley and Graduate Man ger I). W. Bur
bank, will compose the Cardinal rugby
travelers who will leave Palo Alto on
the morning of December 22. The men
will leave the Oakland mole at 11:20
o'clock on the fast "Shasta Limited,"
which will carry them through to
Seattle. Puget Sound will be crossed

by the steamer "Charlotte," and Van
couver will be reached on Saturday,
December 24.
The travelers will have but one in
tervening day to recover from their
tiresome journey, as the first game of
the series is scheduled for the follow
ing Monday. The remainder of the
series will be spread out during the
following seven days, matches being
announced for the December 29 and
January 2.
The Vancouver Rugby Union did not
accept the proposed quarantee of
$1700 and $1500 was mutually agreed
upon instead, as the northerner's guar
antee. The estimated cost of the trip
as made by Burbank, is $1800 and the
deficit of $300, or thereabouts, will be
met by the Student Body.
While the Stanford-Vancouver series
are being played at Vancouver, the
Blue and Gold aggregation will be
playing the Victoria fifteen on the
island metropolis five hours by boat
from Vancouver, for the Cooper-Keith
trophy.
The personnel of the Cardinal trav
eling rugby aggregation was an
nounced last night ,as follows: Fit
ting, Sanborn, Partridge, Olmstead.
Dole, W. L. Smith, Baumgartner, Che
da, forwards; Suiulell, wing forward;
Cass, half; Frank, Harrigan, fives;
Berryman, center; Thoburn, Geissler,
wings; Erb, full. Woodcock will be
substitute for the wing forward and
wing positions, Worswick substitute
for backfield positions.
The forward combination will be the
Varsity star scrum tried by a hard
season of training, leaving nothing to
be desired.
The backfield unit is a new one,
which has never been seen in combina
tion before. The halfback position is
safe in the hands of Cass. The ball in
his position is sure of a get-away,
either by pass or boot to touch. Frank
is a new addition to the backfield, but
his meteoric style of playing promises
much in combination with Harrigan at
second five.
Berryman has slated an enviable
record in the second team backfield
and his heady, sure work during the
season promises a strong unit with
him at center. Thoburn, Geissler and
Erb will complete the backfield and
need no word of introduction.
