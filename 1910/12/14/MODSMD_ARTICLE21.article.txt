# WORK ON MIRACLE PLAYS IS PROCEEDING RAPIDLY.
## 
### 
Professor Bassett as just finished
translating the third of the old Eng
lish Miracle plays that are to be pre
sented by the English Club in Febru
ary. Work on it will be commenced
with the beginning of next semester.
The parts have all been chosen and
rehearsals of the first two plays have
been proceeding for the past two
weeks. The date for the performance
has been definitely set as Friday even
ing, February 3. The Carnot debate
was also scheduled for that night, but
it seems probable at present that it
will be changed to the evening of the
fourth.
