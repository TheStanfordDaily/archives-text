# SUCCESSFUL PLAY IS TAKEN SOUTH
## DEVIL'S DISCIPLE TO BE STAGED IN LOS ANGELES. Sword and Sandals Society Negotiating With Theatrical Manager for Southern Playhouse. 
### 
During the Christmas vacation a
performance of "The Devil's Disciple"
will be given in Los Angeles under the
auspices of Sword and Sandals. This
■play, when presented here was one of
the most pretentious attempt that
Stanford has seen in late years, both
from the scenic and technical stand
points. Its Los Angeles production
will lie still more elaborate, as a regu
lation theatre will be used by the play
ers, with the numerous advantages
that such a house possesses.
Negotations are now in progress
with the manager of one of Los Ange
les' leading play houses for securing
his theatre and the final arrangements
should be made in a few days. This
will assure a complete production
from the standpoint of properties and
scenic effects.
The purpose of putting on this play
during the holidays is to raise suffi
cient money to cover the deficit in
curred during the staging of the vehi
cle here. Owing to the fact that all
the lighting fixtures on the Assembly
Hall stage were condemned by the
underwriters, as unsafe and not ac
cording to code specifications, it was
necessary for Sword and Sandals to
install an entirely new lighting ap
paratus. This involved considerable
expense to the organization. It is for
the purpose of clearing up this deficit
that the play will be given in Los
Angeles.
Practically the same cast that pre
sented it here will be seen in the
southern city. The great majority of
the members of the cast are residents
of Los Angeles or surronding towns,
and will have no difficulty in making
arrangements in regard to rehearsals.
It was this fact that first suggested to
Sword and Sandals that they attempt
to produce the play in the south.
The only parts which will have to be
filled with new material are those of
Burgoyne, played here by M. W.
Strong, '11; Uncle Titus, played by
15. H. Lasky, '12; Chaplain Brudenell,
played by C. Vrang, '13; and the Sear
geant played by H. W. Spence, '13.
None of these parts with the exception
of Burgoyne, offer any difficulty to
the person playing the roles. The part
of Burgoyne will in all probability be
taken by W. M. Walker, '08, an old
Sword and Sandals man. K. Chamber
lain, '11, will porbably be seen as the
Sergeant.
