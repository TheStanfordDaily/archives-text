California has in reserve* for the
nine next spring two entire batteries,
with a pitcher to spare, an entire in
field. lacking the keystone position,
and a complete trio of outfielders—i
this being the whole Varsity of last
year, with 1910 Captain Lewis mis
sing from the second sack. The big
gest happening for California this year
is the return of the Indian
Foraker. This left-handed twirler as
a Freshman won a seventeen-inning
game from Stanford as the deciding
contest of the 1901* championship ser
ies. He is a formidable man and a
problem that the Cardinal will have
to untangle in March and April of the
coming season.
Greenlaw will be no mediocre lead
er of his Varsity nine. His ability to

keep the team together will be a in
estimable help to the Blue and Gold.
In addition, he is easily the best player
on the line-up, and at the initial sack
does his work like a leaguer.
Tt will be noticed that O'Kelly, the
heavy hitter is back. When in form
his particular delight is a two-basa
hit with two men on the circuit. Also,
there is Salisbury, who averages a nit
or two. The nine will be made up,
therefore, of a weil balanced group of
men, strong both in hitting and field
ing. This team was far worse than a
preparatory organization up to the
intercollegiate series. In three games,
although finally defeated by Stanford
for the championship, it made a show
ing worthy of a squad of leaguers. In
the second struggle of the series Cali
fornia made no errors. In the decid
ing match, Harris, on the mound, was
touched in the ninth chapter lor two
three-baggers and three singles, scor
ing a total of six runs.
Six strong second team players will
be on hand to fill the places of any of
California's veterans who fall by the
way. These are "Amos" Elliott, Sand
man, Brush, Corbett, Clendenen, and
Jordan, who were possibilities last
spring. Four Freshmen stand out as
dangerous candidates. They are:
Goodwin, Reuhke, Webb, and Dodson.
The Blue and Gold has no coach, in
this respect being on the same foot
ing with Stanford. Similarly, a sched
ule has not made an appearance at
Berkeley. The team played a six
weeks session of fall baseball in Sep
tember and October, and learned much
to its advantage. It had a longer fall
list of games than did the Cardinal,
whose veterans also engaged in first
semester practice.
