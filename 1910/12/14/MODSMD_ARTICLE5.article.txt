try-outs, the Thiele Handicap singles
and the inter-class doubles tourna
ments will be completed. Both of
these contests are usually finished be
the Christmas vacation, but rain inter
fered this year and caused the post
ponement
In adidtion to the four regular Var
sity tournaments, a special try-out
contest is now being arranged. This
special match will precede the others
and will be open to players who are
also competing on the track and who
are not allowed to enter the regular
tournaments, which come later in the
year and interfere with the track
training. The annual Intercollegiate
Singles Tournament is held 011 the
morning of the Track Meet, but the
Doubles Matches are not played until
the following Saturday. This will en
able a player to compete in both con
test!; provided he can defeat the fourth
man in the round-robin.
The Intercollegiate Tournament
consists of five matches, three singles
and two doubles. The winners of the
four Varsity try-outs play a round

1 robin tournament and the first three
I are the singles representatives. The
| doubles teams are picked by the cap
tain from these four and the winner of
j the special try-out.
Stanford has suffered a lpng list of
1 defeats in tennis, but this year, pros
j pects are brighter than they have been
j for several years. All of last year'.?
j team are in college and several new
1 men are showing great promise.
Of the veterans, H. S. Morgan, '12,
is still the best and is playing a strong
game. The loss of the University
championship this year has in no
1 way deterred him in his work, but in
stead he is playing harder than ever
and bids fair to turn the tables on his
conqueror next semester. R. L. Mur
ray, '13, has improved greatly over last
year. He plays a swifter game than
formerly and his great reach enables
him to return almost impossible shots.
Murray has the hardest serve in the
University, and he gets it in with un
erring accuracy. H. Mann, 'Ift, has
ben unable to practice very much this
fall, and consequently his game has
suffered, but he should regain his old
form with a little more training. G.
L. Shaul, '13, the fourth man on last
year's team, is playing consistently
and is always to be reckoned with in
tho tournaments.
Of the new men, H. W. Dawson, '14,
has shown up the best. Dawson de
feated Morgan for the University
championship and was also in the
finals of the first handicap tourna
ment. He ranks with the best in the
state and with Morgan as a partner,
should be able to defeat any California
pair. A. 11. Cawston, '14, is another
Freshman who is a likely candidate
for the team. F. M. Douglass, '13, is
easily one of the first four players in
the University, but being a transfer,
lie is disqualified this year. He and
Murray are (he likely winners of the
interclass doubles. C. S. Grace, '12,
and F. S. Pratt, '13, are nlaying in
good form and may be strong con
tenders for the Varsity honors.
With this array of talent, Stanford
should be able to turn out the best
team it has developed for some time.
Resides, California has lost, the in
vincible Long brothers combination.
Melville Long is still in college and is
undoubtedly the best singles man in
either institution, but the graduation
of Herbert has broken up the crack
doubles team and deprived California
of a strong singles player.

formerly and his great reach enables
him to return almost impossible shots.
Murray has the hardest serve in the
University, and he gets it in with un
erring accuracy. H. Mann, 'Ift, has
ben unable to practice very much this
fall, and consequently his game has
suffered, but he should regain his old
form with a little more training. G.
L. Shaul, '13, the fourth man on last
year's team, is playing consistently
and is always to be reckoned with in
tho tournaments.
Of the new men, H. W. Dawson, '14,
has shown up the best. Dawson de
feated Morgan for the University
championship and was also in the
finals of the first handicap tourna
ment. He ranks with the best in the
state and with Morgan as a partner,
should be able to defeat any California
pair. A. 11. Cawston, '14, is another
Freshman who is a likely candidate
for the team. F. M. Douglass, '13, is
easily one of the first four players in
the University, but being a transfer,
lie is disqualified this year. He and
Murray are (he likely winners of the
interclass doubles. C. S. Grace, '12,
and F. S. Pratt, '13, are nlaying in
good form and may be strong con
tenders for the Varsity honors.
With this array of talent, Stanford
should be able to turn out the best
team it has developed for some time.
Resides, California has lost, the in
vincible Long brothers combination.
Melville Long is still in college and is
undoubtedly the best singles man in
either institution, but the graduation
of Herbert has broken up the crack
doubles team and deprived California
of a strong singles player.
Tennis enthusiasts will have ample
opportunity to match their skill next
semester, for besides the four Varsity
try-outs, the Thiele Handicap singles
and the inter-class doubles tourna
ments will be completed. Both of
these contests are usually finished be
the Christmas vacation, but rain inter
fered this year and caused the post
ponement
In adidtion to the four regular Var
sity tournaments, a special try-out
contest is now being arranged. This
special match will precede the others
and will be open to players who are
also competing on the track and who
are not allowed to enter the regular
tournaments, which come later in the
year and interfere with the track
training. The annual Intercollegiate
Singles Tournament is held 011 the
morning of the Track Meet, but the
Doubles Matches are not played until
the following Saturday. This will en
able a player to compete in both con

1 defeats in tennis, but this year, pros
j pects are brighter than they have been
j for several years. All of last year'.?
j team are in college and several new
1 men are showing great promise.
Of the veterans, H. S. Morgan, '12,
is still the best and is playing a strong
game. The loss of the University
championship this year has in no
1 way deterred him in his work, but in
stead he is playing harder than ever
and bids fair to turn the tables on his
conqueror next semester. R. L. Mur
ray, '13, has improved greatly over last
year. He plays a swifter game than
formerly and his great reach enables
him to return almost impossible shots.
