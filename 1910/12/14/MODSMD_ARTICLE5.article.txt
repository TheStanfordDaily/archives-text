In adidtion to the four regular Var
sity tournaments, a special try-out
contest is now being arranged. This
special match will precede the others

also competing on the track and who

1 defeats in tennis, but this year, pros
j pects are brighter than they have been
j for several years. All of last year'.?
j team are in college and several new
1 men are showing great promise.
Of the veterans, H. S. Morgan, '12,
is still the best and is playing a strong
game. The loss of the University
championship this year has in no
1 way deterred him in his work, but in
stead he is playing harder than ever
and bids fair to turn the tables on his
conqueror next semester. R. L. Mur
ray, '13, has improved greatly over last
year. He plays a swifter game than
formerly and his great reach enables
him to return almost impossible shots.
Murray has the hardest serve in the
University, and he gets it in with un
erring accuracy. H. Mann, 'Ift, has
ben unable to practice very much this
fall, and consequently his game has
suffered, but he should regain his old
form with a little more training. G.
