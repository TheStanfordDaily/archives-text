Volume thirty-seven of the Daily
Palo Alto is completed tonight with
the present issue. Realizing that the
efficiency and the standard ~f the work
in the publication depend to a large
extent upon the character and the
amount of work that is contributed by
members of the editorial staff, we wish
at this time to take the opportunity to
express our sincerest appreciation
for the endeavors that they individu
ally have offered this semester. Re
ceiving no recognition for the faithful
services that these members of the
staff render to the publication from
any not connected with the Daily Palo
Alto, some acknowledgment should be
made of their work and of the ap
preciation that is due them.
Every individual has faithfully and
unselfishly given his time and his labor
in the interests of the Daily Palo Alto,
at no time complaining of extra duties
that might occasionally be levied upon
members of the staff. It would be hard
to conceive of a group of students who
could fulfill the duties incumbent upon
the staff of the paper more adequately
and loyally than those who now occupy
positions with the Daily Palo Alto. In
view of these facts therefore, only the
gratitude and recognition of the publi
cation can be given these workers.
