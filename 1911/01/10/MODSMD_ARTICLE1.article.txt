This is the
statement mac I .'
by Professor t\

Prof. ('. 11. Gilbert H. Gilbert. Chair
nuin of lbs Faculty Committee 0:1 De
linquent Scholarship to a representa
tive of the Daily Palo Alto this after
noon.
A comparison of tbe statistics given
out January 1910 with those presently
at hand bears out Chairman Gilbert s
statement. Twenty-eight instead of
forty-two names have been permanent
ly dropped from Stanford's register
because of poor scholarship. Of these
twenty-eight, three are women. Sev
enty five others have recorded their
first failure and are now placed on
strict probation. Eight women are re
corded among the seventy-five. Only
forty-one were on strict probation last
year.
Twenty-four, Including three women,
have a sufficiently low record to be
placed on secondary or minor proba
tion. No definite figures as to this
class of delinquents were given out in
1910.
As the names of those who failed in
their work are withheld, it is not
known just how seriously the action of
the Scholarship Committee will affect
this semester's activities. It is known
however, that many prominent stu
dents, including some of the Cardinal's
best athletes are temporarily or per
manently affected.
If the old scholarship ruling of 1900
were yet in effect, the seventy-five on
strict probation would not "be among
those present," on the campus and
undoubtedly more than twenty-eight
would be permanently dropped. In
January 1909, ninety-one were not per
mitted to resume their work and fifty
five others were placed on strict pro
bation.
