It seems that the second half of
every college year brings with
>V lint's it a crisis. Every spring se-
Alieuri mester in the life of the pres
ent generation is a verdant
spot in our memory. Each one has
brought with it a burden of unsettled
questions from preceding semesters,
and this semester is no exception to
the rule. The following are some of
the problems we must consider:
Are we or are we not going to de
mand a scholarship equality provision
in the Five Year agreement with Cali
fornia?
Are we going to support the Stan
ford Union project so that we can
break ground this semester?
Are we to continue our present
coaching system or not? If we con
tinue the professional system, who can
fill Coach Presley's position, if his
determination to resign is final?
Are we to be unprotected victims of
another epidemic, or are we to have
an isolation hospital? Hoard of Trus
tees kindly ponder.
Are we to continue our progress to
ward student control?
Who is to be our next Baseball
coach ?
If, then, realizing our responsibility
toward the University, all of us ser
iously work for the permanent good of
Stanford, Volume 38 of the Daily Palo
Alto should prove interesting reading,
for it shall have the privilege of re
cording events of fundamental import
ance to future generations.
As for its policy, the Daily Palo Alto
will endeavor to lie of some help in the
work before us, and it will do this
cheerfully, honestly, and positively.
It will try to present the news prompt
ly and attractively written and hopes
that the history recorded may add
lustre to the good name of Stanford.
