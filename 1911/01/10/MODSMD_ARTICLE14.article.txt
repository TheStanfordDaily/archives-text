# PLAYING SANTA CLAUS MRS. MOULTON IS BURNED.
## Stanford Trainer and Wife Meet Serious Accident in Christmas Tree Celebration. 
### 
The prompt assistance of her hus
l)iui(l saved Mrs. E. W. Moulton, wife of
the trainer of Stanford athletes, from
probable fatal burns at ?, Christinas
tree celebration during the holidays.
Mrs. Moulton was playing Santa Clans
when her costume became ignited, and,
though "Dad's" aid was immediate and
effective, the flaming clothing was
not torn off until she had suffered a
number of severe burns. Mrs. Moulton
is improving slowly but it is feared
that her face may be permanently
marked. "Dad's" hands were badly
scorched, but the wounds are now
nearly entirely healed.
It is thought that the unfortunate
lady must have inhaled flames from the
burning garments, but she seems to
have suffered no considerable injury
from that. This is the second severe
misfortune suffered by the Moulton
family, "Dad" being convalescent
from typhoid fever at the time of the
accident.
