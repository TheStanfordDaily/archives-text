# HIGH HONOR BESTOWED ON PROFESSOR ECKART.
## Receives Mechanical Engineering Prize for Superior Scientific Paper. 
### 
A high honor has been conferred
upon Professor William R. Eckart of
the Mechnical Engineering depart
ment by the Institution of Mechnical
Engineers. He has been awarded the
Water Arbitration Prize for 1910 for a
paper upon the subject of "The Appli
cation of Pitot Tube to the Testing of
Impulse Water Wheels."
According to the institution, this
award is one to be made for the best
original paper dealing with any
branch of the mechanics of the supply
and distribution of water. It is inter
esting to note that the paper was not
written for the prize, and that Profes
sor Eckart was not even aware that a
prize was offered in this line of work.
Professor Eckart holds the associate
professorship of mechanical engineer
ing at Stanford University. He has
recently returned from his sabbatical
leave, when he took a trip around the
world, spending much time in the
Orient.
