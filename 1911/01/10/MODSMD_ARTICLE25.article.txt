# PROFESSOR BOLTON IN ARIZONA AND MEXICO
## Follows the Trail of Father Kino, Early Explorer Whose Journal Will be Published. 
### 
In continuation of the lino of work
which has made him one of the leading
authorities on the history of Mexico
and the southwest, Professor H. E.
Bolton, of the History Department
spent his vacation in a most novel
fashion. He is shortly to edit the
chronicle of Father Eustro Francisco
Kino, one of the earliest explorers of
Arizona, the Peninsula of Southern Cal
ifornia, and Mexico, and in order to get
the proper background for this work,
Professor Bolton traveled, during the
holidays, over the territory mapped out
for the first time by this famous seven
teenth century explorer.
The historical world will owe the
publication of this valuable journal of
exploration entirely to Professor Bol
ton, since he is not only its editor but
its discoverer. He brought it to light
in one of the most recent of his trips
to Mexico, on many of which he has
unearthed documents which have
thrown much light on the history of
the country.
Traveling farther on horseback than
any other man has ever done in the
southern country, Father Kino, author
of this journal, was the first to draw
accurate maps of the region. In spite
of his importance, however, his nation
ality is, curiously enough, unknown to
historians. Professor Bolton believes
that he was an Italian, while others
regard him as a Spaniard or as a Ger
man.
