# CARDINAL CAPTURES SERIES FROM CANADIAN PLAYERS
## Stanford Aggregation Wins Final Game After a Splendid Exhibition of Rugby Science and Unity of Play. 
### 
By I I I
Hy winning the last two games of j
the vacation series with Vancouver, j
the Cardinal players captured thej
trio of rugby games l'rom the Cana
dians. A mudd\ field, together with !
a, new Cardinal rugbv lineun, plaving '
!
together For the first time, lost the
first of the series to the Northerners.
'Fhe two remaining games, however,
saw Presley's rugby machine out- !
'playing their opponents, and winning \
| the series by a good margin.
Even the most sanguine Cardinal i
rooter, while believing we would cap- !
• ture the series, looked for a closer
score in tlie winning games. That j
those seventeen travellers, who after
a bare two weeks of practice were
made a winning combination, shows
perhaps more than anything else
could just, what George J. Presley's
loss, as the Cardinal rugby coach, i
means. For three years Coach Pres
ley has guided the Cardinal rugby
destiny and his ability in selecting
and training raw material from which
he has developed rugby stars, has
raised the Cardinal players to the
first rank in the rugby world.
Frcm the time of its arrival until 1
it boarded the "Princess Victoria" to
return south, the Cardinal party was
entertained royally by its hosts. Hard
ly an evening passed without a dinner
party. New Year's Eve was celebrated
by a grand ball in honor of the visit
ors and during their stay a banquet
was given by their hosts after they
had been entertained at the theatre.
| The Canadians were impartial in their
j rooting at the games and with true
: sportsmanlike feeling applauded all
of Stanford's good plays as heartily
a; their own.
The first game was played on Mon
day, December 26th, and was won by
Vancouver, score 13-6. The game of
Thursday, the 29th was won by the
visitors by a score of 10-3 and on
Monday, January 2, the Cardinal play
• ers ended the series by winning from
! the Northerners with a 9-0 score.
The first game was played on a
muddy field, and being more at honv j
under such condition 0 , tho Canadians j
! followed up their advantage to a
clearly earned victory. The ga'r.e was
-chiefly confined to dribbling rush" 1 ,
j The North rners. by a fa-t following
i up of the kiekofi', dribbled across for
, a try. Tw ice more were they able to |
! duplicate this dribbling rush and
added four points more by two con
versions.
Similar tactic.- drove tho leather
oval across the Vancouver lim . Car
dinal rallies at midficld being the
source of these scores, Ooissler and
Olmstead shared the honors of chalk
i ing up three points apiece by falling
tin the leather behind tlv.'ir opponents
line.
The game of the 2!iih. saw the Car-
I dinal players at par and their ma
j chine-like precision overcame the
J Northerner's science and Stanford was

credited with a victory. 'Fhe Cardi
nals outclassed their opponents both
in the hackfield and forward playing.
The. too strict adherence ol Referee
McKay to his whistle took away much

of the snap that would otherwise have
characterized this match.
A. Sanborn, '12, was the Cardinal
scorer, first by a spectacular .">O-yard
run from a midfield secursion and
again when he outran Vancouver to
score on a dribbling rush. Geissler
completed fach of these tries b,\ driv
ing tho pigskin between the goal po-ts
to tally four points. Vancouver's tally
of 3 was made on a penalty kick for
Stanford offside.
On a frozen field, covered by an
inch of melting snow, the final game
and the host exhibition of rug' y, dur
ing the series, was played. The first
half was closely contested and neither
fifteen was able to maintain the ad
vantage long enough to advance the
ball within speaking distance of its
opponent's goal.
The second half saw the Cardinal
machine si l ike through the Canadian's
line for throe unconverted tries. The
scoring was started when Worswick
received the ball in a. passing rush,
via Harrigan and Rerryman. and cross
kicked to Woodcock, Geissler going
across near the side lines to tally 3.


Co i-I? George Joseph Presley
Vancouver followed out with a pus
sing rush which was intercepted by
A. Sanborn at midfield. A 50 yard
swerving run through the loose, a
clever dodging of Vancouver's full
put Sanborn across for the second try.
Roberts, Vancouver's center and re
cent All-English star, cross kicked
during the last few minutes of play,
but a burst of speed gave the ball to
Geissler at the sidelines near mid
lield. A 50-yard run close to the
white streak put the Varsity wing
across for the last tally and the series
was won by Stanford.
The personnel of the travellers was:
Fitting, A. Sanborn. Arrell, Olmstead,
Dole, W. L. Smith, Baumgartner,
Cheda, forwards; Sundell, Woodcock,
wing forwards; Cass," half; Frank,
Harrigan, Berryman, fives; Berry

Hy winning the last two games of j
the vacation series with Vancouver, j
the Cardinal players captured thej
trio of rugby games l'rom the Cana
dians. A mudd\ field, together with !
a, new Cardinal rugbv lineun, plaving '
!
together For the first time, lost the
first of the series to the Northerners.
'Fhe two remaining games, however,
saw Presley's rugby machine out- !
'playing their opponents, and winning \
| the series by a good margin.
Even the most sanguine Cardinal i
rooter, while believing we would cap- !
• ture the series, looked for a closer
score in tlie winning games. That j
those seventeen travellers, who after
a bare two weeks of practice were
made a winning combination, shows
perhaps more than anything else
could just, what George J. Presley's
loss, as the Cardinal rugby coach, i
means. For three years Coach Pres
ley has guided the Cardinal rugby
destiny and his ability in selecting
and training raw material from which
he has developed rugby stars, has
raised the Cardinal players to the
first rank in the rugby world.
Frcm the time of its arrival until 1
it boarded the "Princess Victoria" to
return south, the Cardinal party was
entertained royally by its hosts. Hard
ly an evening passed without a dinner
party. New Year's Eve was celebrated
by a grand ball in honor of the visit
ors and during their stay a banquet
was given by their hosts after they
had been entertained at the theatre.
| The Canadians were impartial in their
j rooting at the games and with true
: sportsmanlike feeling applauded all
of Stanford's good plays as heartily
a; their own.
The first game was played on Mon
day, December 26th, and was won by
Vancouver, score 13-6. The game of
Thursday, the 29th was won by the
visitors by a score of 10-3 and on
Monday, January 2, the Cardinal play

-chiefly confined to dribbling rush" 1 ,
j The North rners. by a fa-t following
i up of the kiekofi', dribbled across for

oval across the Vancouver lim . Car
dinal rallies at midficld being the

i ing up three points apiece by falling

The game of the 2!iih. saw the Car-
I dinal players at par and their ma
j chine-like precision overcame the
J Northerner's science and Stanford was

credited with a victory. 'Fhe Cardi
nals outclassed their opponents both
in the hackfield and forward playing.
The. too strict adherence ol Referee
McKay to his whistle took away much

of the snap that would otherwise have

A. Sanborn, '12, was the Cardinal
scorer, first by a spectacular .">O-yard
run from a midfield secursion and
again when he outran Vancouver to
score on a dribbling rush. Geissler
completed fach of these tries b,\ driv
ing tho pigskin between the goal po-ts
to tally four points. Vancouver's tally
of 3 was made on a penalty kick for
Stanford offside.
On a frozen field, covered by an
inch of melting snow, the final game
and the host exhibition of rug' y, dur
ing the series, was played. The first
half was closely contested and neither
fifteen was able to maintain the ad
vantage long enough to advance the
ball within speaking distance of its
opponent's goal.
The second half saw the Cardinal
machine si l ike through the Canadian's
line for throe unconverted tries. The
scoring was started when Worswick
received the ball in a. passing rush,

kicked to Woodcock, Geissler going
