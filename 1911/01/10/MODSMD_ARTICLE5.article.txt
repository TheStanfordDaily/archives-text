# CAMPUS TO LIVE IN THIRTEENTH CENTURY
## MIRACLE PLAYS WILL TRANSPORT US TO DAYS OF YORE. Mediaeval Seenes of Merrie England Will be seen in Assembly Hall February 3. 
### L.M. Robinson, '12 
Do you believe in miracles? Of
course you will answer "No." Hut l>e
lore you pass a final judgment, wait
and see the Miracles Flays that will be
performed in Assembly Hall on the
evening of February third. Wait until
you hear the voice of the herald
bidding all good people come and see
the show—a herald clad in shining
armor, riding down the road to Paly—
and you will behold a wonderful trans
formation take place upon the campus.
1 lie time will be not the present, but
the thirteenth century, the arcades of
the Quad will 1 e the grim cloisters of
a mediaeval monastery, down which
jolly old monks will pass along and
' ho campus itself will be the merriest
town in all England, because forsooth,
it is Ihe day of the show. All this will
seem real to you, if you but use an
ounce of imagination and trust the
rest to the players.
The whole of last semester the Eng
lish Club was busy preparing for this
transformation. Ancient plays were
dug up, or gathered from the four cor
ners of the earth and translated from
old into modern English. Professor
P. Emerson Hassett assumed the re
sponsibilities of coach and has ac
tually found fellows among us who
can look the part of saint or monk.
Choir boys from the city have been en
gaged to assist in the anthems, to
carry tapers, swing censers and so
add to the general enchantment.
Do not fancy from this account that
the whole business is but a dreary,
churchly procession; for there will
be comedy, laughter fairly "holding
both its sides. In those days, religion
knew how to wink the eye at deviltry.
Everything, then, awaits the evening
of the third and no little touch that
may add to the illusion will be forgot
ten.
There runs the story that in medi
aeval days, when the plays were first
presented, the happy crowds that gath
ered to witness were served with hot
cross buns and ale or cider. Do you
believe the Stanford public will be so
favored? Do you believe in miracles?
Well, wait and decide for yourself.
