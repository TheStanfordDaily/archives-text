For the sake of the University we are
very glad that Pres
"Pe-c-liglited!' ident Jordan and
Colonel Roosevelt
are such good personal friends. Be
cause ot their comradship we are ex
pecting the Ex-President to feel per
fectly at home when he visits ns. The
Assembly Hall speech we hope will he
a second Osawatomie. However, we
may be assured of something worth
while from the Colonel, whatever he
speaks upon, and everyone will be
glad of the opportunity to see and hear
him.
