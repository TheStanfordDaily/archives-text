# "THE DEVIL'S DISCIPLE" WAS NOT PRESENTED.
## 
### 
"The Devil's Disciple" which scored
such decided success here last se
mester was not presented in Los Ange
les during the holidays as had been
planned, owing to the fact that no
suitable theatre could be secured.
The failure of tlie cast, most of the
members of which reside in or near
the southern city, to stage the play
there was a severe disappointment to
Stanford people in Los Angeles.
