# STUDENTS ARE SLOW IN PAYING STUDENT BODY DUES.
## A 						Depreciation of 160 is Recorded Under Number Paid a Year Age. 
### 
771 was the total paid memberships
to the Student liody at noon today. A
year ago, at this time, the total num
ber was I. The sum going into the
treasury of the Associated Students
from memberships is thus paid by
about one-half of those who have
registered for tliis semester.
All those who register late will be
given a chance to pay for their mem
bership at the Registrar's Oflie. From
now ou, the opportunity will be open
to all who have neglected to give their
supuport to do so at the Registrar's
Office.
The card index system is being used
this year and will greatly facilitate
the determining of bona fide voters at
the polls, being used instead of the
Register, by the poll clerks. These
cards were given to all students when
registering and served as a, reminder
to them that their support, was needed
to help finance athletics.
