# LOS ANGELES FIRMS ADVERTISE IN QUAD
## BUSINESSMEN OF SOUTHERN CITY PROCURE SPACE IN ANNUAL. Advertising and Josh Departments Will be Combined.—Only 300 Copies to be Sold. 
### 
During the Christmas vacation,
Manager B. .1. O'Donnell of the 1!♦ 12
Quad and J. E. Thompson, '11, visited
Los Angeles and met with gratifying
success in securing advertisements
for the Junior Annual from the mer
chants of the Southern city. This is
the first time that any serious at
tempt has been made on the part of the
local publications to get Southern
California advertisers but it should
prove a fertile field for future man
agers. Manager O'Donnell states that
the Los Angeles business men seemed
eager to contribute, but in order to
maintain their good will the Stanford
undergraduates must patronize the
advertisers.
The following leading business
houses of LO3 Angeles contributed:
Clothiers, Harris and Frank; jewelers,
Brock find Feagan; hotels, Alexandria,
I loller- eck; tailors, A. K. Brauer &
Co.; sporting goods, The Wm. H.
Hoegee Co., Dyas-Cline; furniture
stores, Goodan-Jenkins Furniture Co.;
millinery, Mrs. J. Couglan; brokers,
Brown Bros. Besides, there were
many professional men among the
Stanford alumni whose cards will be
published.
The incorporation of spring athletics
in the annual will necessitate an ad
ditional expense and to meet this many
of the professional men among the
alumni have been requested to run
their cards in the advertising section.
Like the rest of the advertisers, these
men will receive copies of the publica
tion and it was intended to do this
without decreasing the number to be
sold to undergraduates. But when the
paper arrived from the east there was
a considerable shortage and it is now
too late to get any more out here in
time for the publication. 800 copies
are to be printed and the shortage in
paper will cut. the surplus which is
sold to "he students to less than 300.
O'Donnell is making a new arrange
ment for the disposal of the books.
Instead of having a sale on the Quad
and having many copies left over as
has often occurred in the past, only
those who previously subscribe ca:i
secure Quads on May 3. Subscriptions
can now be placed at the Stanford
Bookstore or at the University Drug
Store in Palo Alto. A deposit of one
dollar is required.
Another new feature of this year's
annual will be the combining of the
josh and advertising departments.
This has been done to lenefit. the ad
vertisers and is customary among all
the eastern college annuals.
Owing to nn oversight Cooper Medi
can College in San Francisco, which
is affiliated with Stanford was left out
of the class pictures last, semester.
As there i:; a large junior class there,
the final time for submitting class pic
tures has been extended until Febru
ary ir>. Any of the Juniors at Stan
ford who have not yet paid their as
sessments and had their pictures

taken can take advantage of this post
ponment, but all pictures must be in
by the middle of February. Pictures
of organizations, clubs and fraterni
ties must be in by March 15.

of the professional men among the
alumni have been requested to run
their cards in the advertising section.
Like the rest of the advertisers, these
men will receive copies of the publica
tion and it was intended to do this
without decreasing the number to be
sold to undergraduates. But when the
paper arrived from the east there was
a considerable shortage and it is now
too late to get any more out here in
time for the publication. 800 copies
are to be printed and the shortage in
paper will cut. the surplus which is
sold to "he students to less than 300.
O'Donnell is making a new arrange
ment for the disposal of the books.
Instead of having a sale on the Quad
and having many copies left over as
has often occurred in the past, only
those who previously subscribe ca:i
secure Quads on May 3. Subscriptions
can now be placed at the Stanford
Bookstore or at the University Drug
Store in Palo Alto. A deposit of one
dollar is required.
Another new feature of this year's
annual will be the combining of the
josh and advertising departments.
This has been done to lenefit. the ad
vertisers and is customary among all
the eastern college annuals.
Owing to nn oversight Cooper Medi
can College in San Francisco, which
is affiliated with Stanford was left out
of the class pictures last, semester.
As there i:; a large junior class there,
the final time for submitting class pic
tures has been extended until Febru
ary ir>. Any of the Juniors at Stan
ford who have not yet paid their as
sessments and had their pictures

taken can take advantage of this post
ponment, but all pictures must be in
by the middle of February. Pictures
of organizations, clubs and fraterni
ties must be in by March 15.
During the Christmas vacation,
Manager B. .1. O'Donnell of the 1!♦ 12
Quad and J. E. Thompson, '11, visited
Los Angeles and met with gratifying
success in securing advertisements
for the Junior Annual from the mer
chants of the Southern city. This is
the first time that any serious at
tempt has been made on the part of the
local publications to get Southern
California advertisers but it should
prove a fertile field for future man
agers. Manager O'Donnell states that
the Los Angeles business men seemed
eager to contribute, but in order to
maintain their good will the Stanford
undergraduates must patronize the
advertisers.
The following leading business
houses of LO3 Angeles contributed:
Clothiers, Harris and Frank; jewelers,
Brock find Feagan; hotels, Alexandria,
I loller- eck; tailors, A. K. Brauer &
Co.; sporting goods, The Wm. H.
Hoegee Co., Dyas-Cline; furniture
stores, Goodan-Jenkins Furniture Co.;
millinery, Mrs. J. Couglan; brokers,
Brown Bros. Besides, there were
many professional men among the
Stanford alumni whose cards will be
published.
The incorporation of spring athletics
in the annual will necessitate an ad
ditional expense and to meet this many
of the professional men among the
alumni have been requested to run
their cards in the advertising section.

men will receive copies of the publica
