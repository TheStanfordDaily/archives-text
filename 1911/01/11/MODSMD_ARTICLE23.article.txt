# COACH FOR NINE MAY BE SELECTED TONIGHT
## Long Deferred Appointment of Baseball Head May Come Up at Committee Meeting. 
### 
There is a chance that the baseball
and football coach will be named at
the Executive Committee meeting to
night. The baseball team has been
demoralized through lack of a head
and, with the opening of the season so
near, it is probable that the committee
will rush through the naming of a
coach tonight. The nine is without a
captain, also, and there is no one with
any sort, of authority to take charge
of the first practice. According to
previous custom the opening diamond
work should come next Saturday.
There is abundance of material but no
one to organize it, and the outlook is
far from bright. California does not
begin practice for one week, since the
State University opens a week later
than Stanford. St. Mary's and Santa
Clara, however, are already busily at
work developing championship teams.
