# LADY NICOTINE'S REIGN FORMALLY RECOGNIZED
## ENCINA MEN MAY NOW "OFFICALLY" SMOKE. Hoard of Trustees Remotes Old Rule. Committees Appointed and Dance Dates Set. 
### 
Encina Club has received official no
tice from the Board of Trustees of
Stanford University that the clause
concerning "no smoking in the hall"
has been removed from the regula
tions.
Since the construction of the dormi
tory there has been a printed rule
prohibiting smoking in Encina but it
was never enforced and few students
were aware of such a regulation. One
day last semester, however, all were
surprised to see a notice posted in the
hall which said there should lie no
smoking in the building. A petition
was immediately circulated among the
students and submitted to the Trustees
to have the "new" rule stricken out.
At the last meeting of the Board the
request was granted.
In passing it might be mentioned
that it was necessary to draw up two
petitions as some dire enemy of the
"filthy weed" surreptiously made away
with the first after it had been relig
iously signed by practically everyone
in the hall.
Encina Club will hold its first dance
of the semester on the evening of
February 4. The committees are al
ready at work to make the occasion
one of the most enjoyable of the year
and several new features will be in
troduced. Three dances will be given
this spring,, the other two coming on
March 11, and April 22. Arrangements
have been made with the Brohaska
orchestra to play on each evening.
