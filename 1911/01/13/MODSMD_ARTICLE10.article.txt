# EXHIBIT OF DRAWINGS LOANED BY HARPER'S
## W. G. BEYMER, '07, SECURES FINE ORIGINAL WORK. Exhibition Will be Open to Public During the Week Beginning Monday, January 16. 
### O.H.C., '14 
An artistic treat which is sure of a
hearty Stanford welcome is announced
for the week commencing January 16,
when there will he on exhibition a
Loan Collection of original drawings
just received by the Art Club from
Harper Brothers of New York. For
this favor the club is indebted to Wil
liam Gilmore Beymer, ex-'O7, a former
Art major, at present occupying a pos
ition on the editorial staff of Harper's
Magazine.
Beymer and Mrs. Beymer, who will
be remembered by some as Jeanette
Havfard, '06, visited the University
last September, and this exhibit comes
as a result of an arrangement made
with Professor R. B. Harshe at that
time. Upon his return to the east
Beymer took the matter up with Man
aging Editor Wells and Art Director
Meers of Harper's Monthly, the latter
being an old acquaintance of Professor
Harshe, and both promised that such a
collection would be sent to Stanford
as soon as the pictures could be gath
ered together from various other ex
hibitions among which they were then
scattered. Final arrangements were
made by correspondence between
Stanford the Harper Publishing
House.
The collection will include draw
ings, which in their published form,
have become familiar to cultured
people throughout the country. Ar
tists who have done much to give Har
per's its enviable artistic position will
contribute, notably Alice Barber
Stephens, Frank Craig, W. Hatherell,
Rose Cecil Smith and numerous oth
ers. Oil paintings, charcoal drawings
and monochrome work in black and
white will be included in the exhibi
tion.
It may be seen from 9 to 5 daily
during the week of January 16 in room
311 of the Graphic Arts Building.
Beymer, who was in part instru
mental in procuring the collection for
Stanford, states that, being on the
ground, and acquainted with many of
the magazine editors, he could in all
probability arrange to have a similar
exhibition sent, every year by some
publication such as the Century, Col
lier's and Everybody's.
