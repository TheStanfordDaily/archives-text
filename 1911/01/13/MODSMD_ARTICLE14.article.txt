# The 						Situation let's Meet It
## 
### 
There have been countless editorials
written urging Stanford men to at
tend rallies, to fill the bleachers, t >

sign for the team, and
in general to show
and personify the
Stanford Fighting

Spirit. These editorials have not been
amiss, but it has often been a question
in our minds whether they are really
needed, whether it is necessary to
keep Stanford men on the move thru
the agency of the editorial prod.
Most Stanford men are live ones and
the Stanford spirit is an instinct.
However, the Daily Palo Alto this
year, feels justified in making an es
pecial plea for action. Never in the
history of the present generation at
least luive we faced a similar situa
tion. it seems hardly necessary to
point out in all its harrowing details
just what that situation is. The com
bination of a high scholarship re
quirement which is seemingly slipped
up a notch every year, and the ending
of the Lanagan-Presley regime has
left us to gather together our remain
ing forces and start all over again.
This is indeed a critical time in Stan
ford athletic history. The occasion is
a serious one and everyone of us must
heli> meet it. Nature has given us a
good start this week, thanks to .Jupiter
Pluvius, and has filled Lagunita for
the Crew squad.
Let us do our part by starting the
season as a whole tomorrow evening
at Encina with the greatest rally ever
held in the historic clubroom.
