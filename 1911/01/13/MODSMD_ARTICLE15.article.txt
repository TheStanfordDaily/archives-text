It is great to be at college now, just
to watch the raindrops fall. It may lie
a sick 'varsity but we don't notice

that at all. We're
certainly glad we're
living, and that"sonie
of us did come back;"

the only reason for kicking is at tho
tightness of the "sack."
Our shoes and wallets aren't heavy.
No, we don't ride in big machines.
Some of us walk to the Terrace to
gather our stew and beans. This may
be fine in summer, at least we attempt
it with vim, but the greatest drawback
in winter is that all of us cannot swim.
We are sorry that the money only
brings in "two per cent;" that the
band plays in sacred places, while
professors pay such low rent. De
partments have much equipment, and
the students pay such low fees, but
it is a bit cold to ramble in the water
up to your knees.
Hut God is good in his kindness, and
perhaps in the future years on tin 1
long walk to the Terrace may be
heard the student's cheers; when their

feet are out of water and their ankles
and knees are warm, then we'll all be
dry together, down here on the Stan
ford farm.
