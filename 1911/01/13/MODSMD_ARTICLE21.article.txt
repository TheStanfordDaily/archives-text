# DISRUPTION OF HOMES THREATENS PALO ALTO
## STUDENTS OF HIGH SCHOOL DEMAND RIGHTS. Petition that Dancing be Permitted at Social Functions. â€” Involved Campus People. 
### P.E., '18 
A condition which rivals the family
disruptions of the Civil War period,
has been discovered at the very doors
of Stanford University. Palo Alto is
the scene of the difficulties, and Stan
ford faculty members, and their sons
and daughters are the actors in this
stirring drama of home life. The
question which is sundering family
ties, interfering with home life, and
causing painful silences at Palo Alto
breakfast tables is: shall the students
of Palo Alto High School be allowed to
dance at social functions of the school?
For many years past the Muse Terp
sichore has failed to make her ap
pearance at these affairs owing to the
objections of the Board of Education,
and the faculty of the school. Trip
ping the light fantastic has become a
lost art among the fair maidens and
stalwart youths of Palo Alto.
Now, however, a petition has drop
ped into the quiet educational circles
of Palo Alto, that has caused as much
excitement as a mouse at a pink tea or
a man at a suffragette meeting. The
petition demands that students be al
lowed to dance.
But why the disruptions among
homes and what the relation to Stan
ford? The head of the Department of
Civil Engineering, and the head of the
Department of Greek, are the proud
fathersof sons who have signed the
petition. Furthermore they are mem
bers of the Board of Education. The
result is a violent disagreement as to
policy. Young America in the persons
of the youths in question demand their
rights and assert that the prohibition
of dancing threatens the roots of de
mocracy. Others disagree with them.
The son of the Superintendent of
Schools, is himself a signer in spite of
the fact that his immediate paternal
ancester is violently opposed to the
petition. This youth says that, he
doesn't care to dance much himself,
but he "hates to see the other 'guys'
loosing their fun."
"What will be the final result of the
tempestuous struggle cannot be stated
at this time. Whether the muse of
dancing will be reinstated or whether
she will still remain in outer darkness
beyond the pale of propriety cannot
even be surmised. The Board of Edu
cation is divided on the subject. It
may be that the divided and sundered
homes of Palo Alto will be sufficiently
poignant in their appeal to overcome
the scruples of those citizens who are
fearful of the morals of their progeny.
In either case the younger generation
will not be seriously injured.
