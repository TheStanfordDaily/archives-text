# 1912 "QUAD" BOARD STARTS FINAL LABORS
## EDITOR HOWELL DESIROUS OF EARLY "COPY." Stall Will Meet Tuesday. â€” Material to be Rushed to Include Spring Athletics. 
### 
Organized work on the 1912 Quad
will commence in earnest next Tues
day evening. At that time there will
be a meeting of the entire board and
the individual members will have their
particular work assigned so that all
material except this spring's athletics
can be in by the middle of February.
The incorporation of spring athlet
ics is an entirely new feature of Stan
ford annuals, and is one that was
hitherto considered impossible because
of the short time that elapses after the
last Intercollegiate contest and the
selling date. In the past all of the
annuals have chronicled the events of
the preceding spring and fall, but this
year's editor, J. W. Howell, is desirous
of bringing the book down to date.
In order to accomplish this, however,
all the material except the spring
sports must be in by February 15 so
that the engravers and printers will
not be hindered in rushing the work
at the last.
The editor has sent honor cards to
all the seniors and these must be
filled out and returned by the first of
February else they will not be printed.
Class pictures may yet be taken by
special arrangement with Manager B.
J. O'Donnell. Organization pictures
must be taken immediately if they are
to appear in the book.
