### 
Tomorrow evening at 7:30 o'clock in
the Encina clubroom, the opening gun
of the Track season will be fired and
Captain Bellah will begin his crusade
for a victory on the California cinder
track in April. The spirit tomorrow
night promises to outdo in enthusiasm
that of any Track rally ever held at
Stanford
Between the enthusiastic yelling and
singing sessions to be conducted by
Yell Leader J. E. Thompson, '11, Track
Captain S. H. Bellah, '10. Student
Advisor A. E. Roth, '09, Student Body
President G. A. Ditz, '11, "Dad" Moul
ton, Dr. D. Charles Gardner and In
structor E. W. Smith, of the English
Department and former Track captain,
will be heard as the speakers of the
evening. All these men arti well
known as speakers and their names
upon the program assures good rally
talks. This will be the first time that
former Track captain E. W. Simth has
been heard at a rally since he left col
lege. He promises to tell how some
of the old time meets were won from
the Blue and Gold.
The cinder season opens Monday,
when training rules will go into ef
fect. The stricter rulings however,
will not become effective until a later
date. The first two or three weeks will
be devoted to lighter work and the

harder training will be introduced
gradually.
On every Saturday after the first
week of the season, a track meet will
be held. More opportunities will thus
be offered to the new candidates
take part in competitive work than
has been the case in the past. On Jan
uary 28 an Interclass meet will be
held. The events of this date will be
run in heats, making it a double meet
in which the new men and veterans
will compete separately.
The Freshmen Intercollegiate will
be held on the Stanford Oval on March
IS. Before this date two preliminary
meets will be held for the first year
men, one towards the end of February
and the other during the first days of
March, giving an opportunity for all
Freshmen to try out.
Upon new material and those who
have previously trod the track without
success, will depend the winning of
this year's Intercollegiate. Especial
ly in the half, mile, high hurdles and
broad jump, must new material be
forthcoming.
Captain Bellah is especially desir
ous that all candidates for Track
work be out promptly on Monday.
The season must start off with a rush,
for in that lies the road to a successful
season.
