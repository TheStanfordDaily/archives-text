# CREW MEN WILL SIGN FOR WORK NEXT WEEK.
## Places of Experienced Veterans Must be Filled from New Material Paraphernalia Ready. 
### 
A call for Crew men will probably
be issued next week and a date set for
signing ui) for the season's work.
Several vacancies occur in the 1911
shell which will be hard to fill this
year. The loss of last year's Captain,
J. C. Huston, '10, at No. 7, J. P. Part
ridge, '12, at stroke, H. L. Dietterle.
'12, at No. 5, and J. W. Roberts, cox
swain, leave positions for which new
men must be found. The greatest
task the coaching squad has to face
is the development of two men to fill
the first named seats. The former oc
cupants were unexcelled on the coast
and substitutes will be hard to fin 1.
This year it is the intention to form
a Freshman Eight instead of a Four as
last season. This can only be accom
plished if a large squad of first year
men sign up.
All interested in rowing are urged
to be on hand when the season opens
and helps make possible the formation
of winning Crews. Cross country run
ning. setting-up exercises and work on
the rowing machines will keep the
men busy until the shells are placed
in the water. The lake will soon be
full if the present heavy rain con
tinues thus making the prospects for
early rowing good. The boating equip
ment is in good shape and practically
ready for use.
