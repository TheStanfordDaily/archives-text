# GANONG IS SELECTED TO COACH BASEBALL
## EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE FILLS POSITION. New Appointee Will Act Without Pay for Entire Season.—Presley is Advisory Conch. 
### 
After mature consideration on the
part of the Executive Committee in
regard to the choice of a Coach for
Baseball for the present semester,
Carl Field Ganong, '10. was finally
chosen for the position. Ganong will
act as Coach without pay, thus permit
ting him to play on the team at the
game time, without threatening his
amateur standing.
Ganong was invested with absolute
authority by the Executive Committee.
George J. Presley has been appointed
as Advisory Coach without authority.
After a long and active discussion in
which the merits ol various applicants
for the position of Coach were careful
ly weighed by the Committee, at a
special meeting held early this after
noon, the matter was finally decided
and a definite choice announced. The
selection had narrowed down to two
or three applicants, and after some
discussion Ganong was chosen.
The new coach is well fitted to fill
the position which has been intrusted
to him. Ganong was a member of the
victorious Football team of 190S, play
ing on the three quarters line. He
filled on outfield position on the Base
ball team of that year. Last year he
was chosen Captain and piloted the
1910 Baseball team from the catcher's
position, through a successful and vic
torious season. As a player who un
derstand all the intricacies of "insicle
baseball," Ganong is an ideal man for
the position. He is a member of Theta
Delta Chi and Skull and Snakes.
Immediately after his appointment
Ganong announced that all last year's
team and substitutes would meet in
room 50 tomorrow at 1:10 for the pur
pose of choosing a Captain for the
coming season. It is very important
that all of last year's team and sub
stitutes in college be present at that
time.
The date for the first Baseball prac
tice will probably be announced at
this meeting.

tive Committee meeting called this
