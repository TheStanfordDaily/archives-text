# THERE WILL BE A VACANT CHAIR.

The election of Ray Milton Brown of
Selma as President of the Freshman
class this afternoon is probably the
most notable instance of the office
seeking the man in the history of
Stanford politics. The only fact which
it is necessary to produce to prove
that this honor was entirely unsolicit
ed on his part is that he failed to
register this semester. It Stanford
was a correspondence school, the se
lection would have been an excellent
one, but in view of existing conditions
it is probable that a new election will
be held.
The retiring treasurer reported a
surplus of $7.00 on hand and no out
standing bills.
The class yell written by R. E.
Hartley, which was adopted at the
close of last semester was given with
much enthusiasm. It is as roilows:
Ray, Rah, Ru Roar,
One, Nine, One, Four,
Stanford
Fourteen.
