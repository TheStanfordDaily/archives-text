# BASEBALL SCHEDULE MAY APPEAR TUESDAY.
## Manager Burbank Busy Preparing Game Lists for Varsity Tennis. 
### 
The majority of games on the 1911
baseball schedule to he Issued probab
ly tomorrow, will be played against
the St. Mary's and Santa Clara College
teams, as usual. The amateur dia
mond teams on the Pacific Coast being
limited, it is difficult for Manager Bur
bank to make any great changes in
the yearly list of contests. A southern
trip is being arranged. The California
games begin, as usual, the Saturday
preceding the spring vacation. In
case of a three-game series the two
concluding games will be played on
the Stanford campus.
Manager Hurbank is planning a
more extensive campaign for the Car
dinal Freshman meets. This schedule
together with the Varsity list are to
appear probably this week.
