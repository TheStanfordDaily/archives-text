# OCCIDENTAL'S PRESIDENT DELIVERS STRONG SERMON
## "THE LURE AND LUST FOR LIFE" IS THEME. Southern Educator Speaks to Crowd Which Fills University Chapel. 
### 
"The Lure and Lust for Life," was
(he subject of the sermon preached
by President John Willis Baer of Oc
cidental College in the University
Chapel yesterday morning at the regu
lar Sunday service. Dr. Baer is well
known as a prominent educator and
has gained fame as International Sec
retary of the Christian Endeavor So
ciety.
Dr. Baer began by asking the ques
tion, "Do you really care much about
life?" and answered it by giving his
own case, "I have a passionate desire
to live, which is unextinguishable
The things, which we learn do not
make us ideal, for by our own lives,
not by the things we know, shall we
be known. There are two forces in
life, both of which are needed by all—
restraint, which we should cultivate,
and energy, which we should con
serve. If a young man has a surplus
of energy we should not sit on him too
hard, for a young fellow of this type
usually has great possibilities."
Dr. Baer pointed out that religion
is a part of life, that teaches us to
live in the right way. "The theory,
that all that religion deals with is
churches, bishops, popes, monasteries
and funerals is heresy. A Y. M. C. A.
need not be a club of anaemic bores,
invigorous to an insipid appetite, but
they can be real live people, and en
joy all the good things of life, that
other people enjoy."
Dr. Baer continued, "Keep out of
your mind the thot that life does
not begin until you get your diploma,
but live now and make the most of
life. Keep out of ruts, for the only
difference between a groove and a
grave is depth. Beware of men who
say, that life is a mill and all is a
delusion, that people are not what
they appear to be. Life is short,
therefore it is great, and we should
do all we can in the time we have.
Five minutes is worth more to a man
who is about to die than a month is to
a man who will live a year."
In summing up, Dr. Baer said.
"Keep your conscience clear, your
hearts tender, so that your mind will
be wide open; and keep your spirits
in fine tune and touch with the in
finite. Shun not the struggle, but face
it and be strong."
The musical program was excellent,
the feature being Miss La Fetra's
solos.
