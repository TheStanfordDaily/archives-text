# SENSIBLE RELIGION "THE REASON WHY."
## Dr. Jordan Tells that Ceremony and Displays Alone do not Make for Religion.—Speaks at Encina. 
### 
Dr. Jordan called the "Religion of a
Sensible American" "the Religion of
the Reason Why" in his talk last even
ing in the Clubroom of Encina Hall.
He told in simple direct words how
religion is not made up of "ceremony,
churches, prayer—these are only 011
the side; they are not religion any
more than your clothes are yourselves.
. . . Ceremony is not a part of relig
ion, except to make it attractive
Some of the most religious men were
not churchmen."
The Clubroom was comfortably
filled with men who enjoyed the
simple, easily understood sentences
with which Dr. Jordan told of the
"sensible religion." There was 110
more ceremony in the telling than in
the religion which the speaker was
advancing. Every-day language was
used to show what follies and extrav
agences there have been in the Christ
ian religion since the beginning of the
belief two thousand years ago.
Some of the short, spicy sayings
spoken by Dr. Jordan during the
evening were as follows:
"To live on a ragtime level is never
to do anything that you want to do.
Don't be satisfied with vulgar shows
and vulgar songs."
"Emotion is not religion, unless you
are going to be a better man. You
don't have to be emotional to be re
ligious."
"Religion is the Reason Why."
