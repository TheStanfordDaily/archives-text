# SPIRIT OF JOINT RALLY PREDICTS DOUBLE VICTORY
## Track and Rowing Seasons Open with Great Show of Genuine Enthusiasm.—"Dad" Moulton Receives Tremendous Ovation. 
### 
With the slogan "the spirit of the
evening is the spirit of the season,"
Yell Leader J. E. Thompson, '11, start
ed one of the most enthusiastic rallies
ever held in Encina on Saturday even
ing. The rally was a joint affair for
Crew and Track and from the enthus
iasm shown, the rooters saw victory in
two events already snatched from Cal
ifornia. When "Dad" Moulton stepped

upon the table to say a few words,
such a roar burst from the throats of
the assembly enthusiasts as has never
before been heard at Stanford. To
again see the Cardinal's veteran train
er ready to take up his work, after
his severe illness was a gratifying
sight to all and none sought to hide
his joy in seeing "Dad" again.
"It is not the spirit here," said
President G. A. Diiz. '11, of the As
sociated Students, as the first speaker
of the evening, "but it is what such a
show of feeling brings and predicts."
In closing he said that ihere was a
place on the track for all who have
succeeded in that branch of activities
and there is just as much of a place
for the fellow who thinks he can. He
then called upon the Track men to
dedicate California's new $20,000 track
with p. Cardinal victory.
Instructor E. W. Smith, captain of
the '99 Track Team, told how the nov
ices won the meets in the early days.
"Just get out and develop your legs
and wind," advised Smith, "for that's
all there is to it."
Dr. D. Charles Gardner enlivened
the evening with his stories and gave
some wholesome advice to all in re
gard to the value of exercise.
"Dad" Moulton said that he had
read that he would be expected to
make some discoveries this year, but
that if this was to be done the fellows
would have to come out and give him
a chance. Only 28 veterans have come
back, according to "Dad," but 11 of
these have been point winners. As
there are 75 men who will represent
the Cardinal in April he must have
plenty of candidates, if we want a vic
tory at that time.
J. O. Miller, 'OS, "one of the greatest
athletes ever to wear an S' as the
next speaker, called on all who could
to respond to the call for Track or
Crew men and go out for one or the
other. A. E. Roth spoke along similar
lines. Miller and Roth both gave re

miniscences of their Track careers,
which were highly interesting.
Captain Hellah admitted the hard
proposition that the Track men had to
face this year and that a victory would
only be won under three conditions —
"First, every man possible must come
out and try,—second, work hard and
obey rules, —third, not only come out,
but stay out."
Crew Captain Schaupp, '12, was the
last speaker of the evening and ad
vised the men to go out for the sport
that they were best litted for. In this
way the strongest teams can be or
ganized to defeat the Blue and Gold.
At the close of the rally 113 men
signed up for Track and 55 for Crew.
The Track candidates follow:
X. M. Halcombe, '09.
S. H. Hellah, '10.

With the slogan "the spirit of the

Yell Leader J. E. Thompson, '11, start
ed one of the most enthusiastic rallies
ever held in Encina on Saturday even
ing. The rally was a joint affair for
Crew and Track and from the enthus
iasm shown, the rooters saw victory in
two events already snatched from Cal
ifornia. When "Dad" Moulton stepped

upon the table to say a few words,
such a roar burst from the throats of
the assembly enthusiasts as has never
before been heard at Stanford. To
again see the Cardinal's veteran train
er ready to take up his work, after
his severe illness was a gratifying
sight to all and none sought to hide
his joy in seeing "Dad" again.
"It is not the spirit here," said
President G. A. Diiz. '11, of the As
sociated Students, as the first speaker
of the evening, "but it is what such a
show of feeling brings and predicts."
In closing he said that ihere was a
place on the track for all who have
succeeded in that branch of activities
and there is just as much of a place
for the fellow who thinks he can. He
then called upon the Track men to
dedicate California's new $20,000 track
with p. Cardinal victory.
Instructor E. W. Smith, captain of
the '99 Track Team, told how the nov
ices won the meets in the early days.
"Just get out and develop your legs
and wind," advised Smith, "for that's
all there is to it."
Dr. D. Charles Gardner enlivened
the evening with his stories and gave
some wholesome advice to all in re

"Dad" Moulton said that he had
read that he would be expected to
make some discoveries this year, but
that if this was to be done the fellows
would have to come out and give him
a chance. Only 28 veterans have come
back, according to "Dad," but 11 of
these have been point winners. As
there are 75 men who will represent
the Cardinal in April he must have
plenty of candidates, if we want a vic
tory at that time.
J. O. Miller, 'OS, "one of the greatest

to respond to the call for Track or
Crew men and go out for one or the

Captain Hellah admitted the hard
proposition that the Track men had to

"First, every man possible must come

ing. The rally was a joint affair for
Crew and Track and from the enthus
iasm shown, the rooters saw victory in
two events already snatched from Cal
ifornia. When "Dad" Moulton stepped

upon the table to say a few words,
such a roar burst from the throats of
the assembly enthusiasts as has never
before been heard at Stanford. To
again see the Cardinal's veteran train
er ready to take up his work, after
his severe illness was a gratifying
sight to all and none sought to hide
his joy in seeing "Dad" again.
"It is not the spirit here," said
President G. A. Diiz. '11, of the As

of the evening, "but it is what such a
show of feeling brings and predicts."
In closing he said that ihere was a
place on the track for all who have
succeeded in that branch of activities
and there is just as much of a place
for the fellow who thinks he can. He
then called upon the Track men to
dedicate California's new $20,000 track
with p. Cardinal victory.
Instructor E. W. Smith, captain of
the '99 Track Team, told how the nov

all there is to it."
Dr. D. Charles Gardner enlivened

"Dad" Moulton said that he had
read that he would be expected to
make some discoveries this year, but
that if this was to be done the fellows
would have to come out and give him
a chance. Only 28 veterans have come
back, according to "Dad," but 11 of
these have been point winners. As
there are 75 men who will represent
the Cardinal in April he must have
plenty of candidates, if we want a vic
