# WOMEN'S ATHLETICS TO RECEIVE NEW IMPETUS
## NEW DIRECTOR FOR ACTIVITIES HAS BEEN FOUND. Miss Maude Cleveland, California Graduate, to Take Charge of all Lines of Feminine Sports. 
### 
A new epoch has opened for wo
men's athletics at Stanford with (he
advent oi Miss Maude Cleveland, A. B.
I niversity of California, who has re
cently been appointed assistant in the
Depai tnient of Hygiene. Her special
duty and endeavor will be to encour
age, instruct, and organize sports.
1 his means that the long felt need of
united action among the women of the
University along athletic lines is to be
fulfilled by having, not special coaches
lor each sport, but one general and
efficient head of all.
II would be difficult to find a person
better adapted to this task than Miss
Cleveland, both from the standpoint
of ability and personality. A review
of her record as a student in Califor
nia, and since, gives ample proof of
her unlimited capacity for accomplish
ing things. Throughout her entire
college career she was prominently
identified with the women's activities
of the university, especially along
athletic and dramatic lines. For three
years she played on the Intercollegi
ate Basketball Team, and was a mem
ber of Mask and Dagger, English Club,
Prytanean, and Torch and Shield.
During her senior year she held the
presidency of the Associated Women
Students, and in the year following
her graduation she was made assist
ant to the Dean of Women at IT. C.
For the past, six months she has been
In San Diego as the Supervisor of the
public playgrounds system, which she
organized there.
Miss Cleveland's ambition while
here is to interest every girl 111 the
University in some form of out door
sport. There will be games to suit
every desire and taste, tennis, basket
ball, rowing, volleyball, hockey, crick
et, baseball, and any other sport in
which there are a sufficient number
interested. Swimming will be added
to the regular curriculum as soon as
a safe and satisfactory pool is pro
vided in the gymnasium. At present
with the new boathouse just com
pleted and and the lake full, the chief
interest and enthusiasm among the
girls is shown over the rowing classes
which Miss Cleveland is organizing.
In bad weather work will be done with
the rowing machine and chest weights
in the gym, in order to develop the
proper muscles, but when the days
are good the girls in their middies will
spend their regular hours in practice
on the lake. In fact, it is the intention
of the instructors to have the greater
part of the work in all the gymnasium
classes changed to sports when the
good weather of the spring conies.
Another good which will come from
this new system will be a step toward
fulfilling the constant demand for
University women for playgrounds or
physcial training instructors as it
will i?ive the accurate knowledge of
out-of-door necessary to both.
