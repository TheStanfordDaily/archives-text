# More Men Needed

Never were spring athletics ushered
in with a greater display of genuine
enthusiasm than by the Rally held in

Encina Glubroom Satur
day evening. A better lot
of speeches were never
given on a similar occa

sion and the spirit of the whole even
ing was auspicious of better things to
come. The great ovation given to
"Dad" Moulton was especially gratify
ing and The Daily Palo Alto wishes to
join in the welcome to the veteran
trainer who has been spared to us.
It seems paradoxical however, that
after such a Rally that only 113 men
signed up for Track work. This gives
Captain Bellah 82 less men to win
from the lilue and Gold than enlisted
under Captain Scott! This is too
severe a handicap for any man to
labor under who at the best has a big
problem to solve. We realize that the
demands of our system of require
ments are severe but at the same time
the demands of Track work are no
more than a man should take to keep
himself in first class condition. Sure
ly there are more than 111' men in
Stanford who can spare the time to
help the Cardinal to victory and in
cidentally benefit themselves. More
men are needed. Lend a hand.
