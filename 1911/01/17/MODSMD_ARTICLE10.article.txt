The address by Dr. Jordan at Encina
Hall Sunday evening, outlining the
"Religion of a Sensible American,"
was a convincing state
"Absent ment of the "orthodoxy
Treatment" of tolerance and com
mon sense," and one to
which the adherents of all the warring
sects might easily subscribe. As an
indication of the speaker's breadth cf
mind and strength of character it
served, to a slight extent at least, to
give us the reason for the respect with
which your President is regarded
thruout the United States. Our short
range perspective, here at Stanford
tends to emphasize the truth of the
statement, "a prophet is not without
honor save in his own country."
We are inclined to wonder at the ar
ticles of sincere appreciation found
in such journals as "Collier's Weekly"
and"The Boston Transcript" in re
gard to Dr. Jordan and his work, when
the air of our own locality is filled
with the narrow, ignorant recrimina
tion of a small calibre yellow-jour
nalist.
An examination of Doctor Jordan's
record will show that he has spent by
far the greater part of his time and
attention upon the affairs of Stanford
during the last twenty years. It is
true that he has in the meantime be
come a famous man in national af
fairs, and every summer vacation,
every short trip away from the camp
us. brings us back a report of other
work that he has done. We are glad
to recognize the power and versatility
of the man who has done most to make
the name of Stanford famous. A
small man in his position might easily
have spent twice the time away from
the campus and never have been
missed. Incidentally he would prob
ably receive credit for more conscien
tious attention to the affairs of the
university.
"Wisdom consists in knowing the
right thing to do at the right time,
virtue in doing' it, and religion in
knowing why it should be done." We
would suggest that a proper regard
for this collection of truths would
prompt a frank acknowledgement of
respect and honor due to our lately
returned President.
