# TO HOLD MANY TENNIS TOURNEYS THIS SPRING
## TWO POSTPONED CONTESTS NOW BEING PLOYED. Illicit Handicap Singles and Inter-Class Doubles Will be Finished this Week. 
### 
Tennis enthusiasts will have plenty
of opportunity to match their skill this
semester, for besides the regular Var
sity try-out tournaments there are the
Thiele Handicap Singles and the In
ter-Class Doubles contests yet to be
held. These two latter tournaments
are usually played off in the fall, but
rain prevented their completion last
semester.
In the Interclass matches only one
team remains from each of the three
lower classes and the best Senior pair
has been broken up by the failure of
Mann to return to college. Grace and
Morgan, the Junior team, will now
play in the finals against the winner
of the Freshman - Sophomore match.
Roth the underclasses are represented
by strong teams and a good game is
expected. Murray and Douglass who
will uphold the honor of 1913 are two
of the best racket wielders in the
University. Their freshman oppon
ents will be Dawson and Cawston and
while each has proven himself to be a
player of the first rank in singles it re
mains to be seen how they can class in
doubles.
The Thiele Tournament is a handicap
contest and the winner will receive
the handsome perpetual challenge cup
that is presented by Baron Thiele, the
tailor. The play in this tournament
reached the third round last semester
but in order to make way for the four
Varsity tournaments it will be neces
sary to finish this delayed contest be
