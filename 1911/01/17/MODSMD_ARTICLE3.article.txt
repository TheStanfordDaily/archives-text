### 
With W. H. B. Fowler, '06, and.1. R.
Hiekey, ex-'O9, present, the Inter
scholastic Board ot Governors met
this afternoon and discussed t lie plans
tor the coming meet on April S.
The main topics tip for discussion
were finances and the necessity for
greater publicity. The next meet will
be widely advertised, and for that pur
pose, a publicity committee composed
oi A. E. Roth, '09, T. L. Coleman, '12,
and S. H. Bellah, '10, chairman, was
appointed.
Entry blanks fov the 1911 meet have
been ordered and will be sent out to
the various preparatory schools dur
ing the coming week. Word has been
received from tho Spokane High
School, that it desires to enter a team
tills year. Several other high schools
in the north will be approached with
the idea of obtaining a large delega
tion from Oregon and Washington this
season.
Fowler suggested that a team should
be picked from the star athletes each
year and sent East to the Illinois ln
terscholastic which is held in Cham
paign. After much discussion as to
the advisability of such a move ,the
matter was laid on the table until the
next meeting. The difficulty of ade
cpiately financing the proposition was
the main objection.
The board repudiated the idea which
has been conveyed by the San Fran
cisco papers, that there is any feeling
of antagonism between the Stanford
board and the men who are handling
the California interscholastic which is
being organized this year.
