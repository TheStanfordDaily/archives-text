# NOVEL PLAN OF COLLEGE EXTENSION WORK ADOPTED.
## Phi Alpha Tan Opens Negotiations to Send Stanford Speakers to High Schools. 
### 
Letters are being sent by the Phi
Alpha Tan Debating Fraternity to
most of the high schools within a
radius of 200 miles ot Stanford to the
effect that one ofthe older students,
who has had experience in debating
here, will be sent to address the high
school student-body, if the school is
willing to pay the speaker's railroad
expenses.
The speaker will try to interest the
students in University affairs, and dis
sipate the idea that a college career is
a waste of time. Stanford life will be
described to the preparatory students
and as much interest aroused in it as
If possible.
This will afford the Stanford men
an excellent opportunity for practice
in speaking unlike that obtained here
in forensic contests and public speak
ing courses.
