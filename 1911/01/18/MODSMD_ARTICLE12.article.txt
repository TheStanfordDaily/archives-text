With the late change in the chair
manship of the Faculty Committee on
Public Exercises we fervently hope for
a general change in policy.
\ Change We hope for more Assem
in Policy hlies and for better speak
ers. Assemblies properly
conducted constitute the most helpful
and broadening department in univer
sity instruction, and it is regretable
that so few have been held the past
semester.
To the policy of the previous com
mittee "to have no Assembly unless
the speaker has a message" we heart
ily subscribe, and yet we believe that
the number of gatherings held is not
indicative of the number of people in
the vicinity who really have something
helpful to say to us and would be glad
of the opportunity to speak. With the
tenth largest city in the United States
and the State Capital but a stone's
throw away surely leaders of men can
be found.
Tomorrow evening Judge Hen Lind
sey of .Juvenile Court fame speaks to
the San Francisco Y. INI. C. A. Charles
Edward Russell, the journalist, is vis
iting in the city. Both of these men
would be welcome at Stanford. Sacra
mento men as Governor Hiram John
son. Harris Weinstock, and State Sena
tor Lee Gates, are orators of known
ability.
Undoubtedly many of the world
famous actors and artists stopping at
San Francisco would gladly speak of
their work and profession to Univer
sity students. Good representatives of
San Francisco commercial, religious
and legal work could be of great aid
to us. Surely there are speakers a
plenty if we only look for them.
