# AUTHOR MUST PAY FOR HIS OWN BOOK.
## Trouble Arises from Purchase of Alumni Directory by its Compiler.—Dollar Demanded. BY F.E.'13 
### 
There is wrath in the hearts of the
Registrar and the Assistant Registrar,
Life, they claim, is too short to work
for Charity. The Business Office, how
ever, cannot appreciate their position.
It claims that to work for Charity,
when that famous lady is disguised as
the Business Office is the acme of
Christian virtues. The controversy
arose out of an Alumni Directory and
a dollar. Incidentally the Daily Palo
Alto is an interested spectator as it
feels itself to be in the same class as
the Registrar and the Assistant Regis
trar.
The Alumni Directory can be had
at the Business Office at any time —for
a dollar. Whether or not it is worth
one dollar is another matter. The
Registrar and the Assistant Registrar
spent many hours for many weeks
compiling this same directory, for
which they received no remuneration
other than thanks. As the Directory
contains some information that cannot
be obtained through any other source
the Registrar thought that it would
not be amiss to have one of the books.
Since he had been largely instrumental
in its issuance he thought that he at
least was entitled to one copy. The
Business Office, in spite of its well
known and justly famous generosity
could not see the matter in that light.
The> wanted the Registrar's Office to
have the book, but—it would be too
much to donate it. In spite 01 the
fact that there never would have been
p. Directory had it not been for the
Registrar, that altogether worthy and
deserving gentleman was forced to pay
«< dollar for his own work.
It may be that the Faculty will peti
tion the Business O'Hcc i'cr a return
of the simoleon. But will they get it?
The answer is not far to seek.
