# HYGIENE DEPARTMENT ADDS MANY NEW COURSES
## DEVELOPMENT OF PLAYGROUNDS INCLUDED IN CURRICULUM Credit Given for Women's Outdoor Sports.â€”Innovation Succeeds in Other Universities. 
### 
The Hygiene Department has just
completed an entirely new schedule of
courses.to be open to women students
during the second semester 1910-11.
The first course, to be known as Hy
giene I, includes what it did regularly
before, that is, three hours exercise,
but it may be taken in any one of three
ways, gymnastics, sports or fencing.
It is given under H. W. Maloney,
Miss G. M. Davis, Miss M. L'Amphere
and Miss M. Cleveland, and may be
taken either semester, giving one unit
credic.
Hygiene V will be subdivided into
three courses, (b) or Theory, two lec
tures and one hour laboratory (hour
to be arranged later), under Dr. C. D.
Mosher and Miss L'Amphere, giving
two units; (bb) or Personal Hygiene,
one lecture and two hours exercise,
which may be taken in any of the reg
ular gymnasium classes, by arrange
ment, given by Dr. Mosher, and bring
ing one unit; and (c) or Playground
Equipment and Supervision, one lec
ture, reference reading, and papers
on assigned subjects, open to stu
dents taking Hygiene I. One unit
credit will be given for this work,
which is to be under the instruction
of Miss Cleveland, the new head of
Women's Athletics.
This last course is an innovation at
Stanford, but has been given very suc
cessfully in other universities. The
development of the playgrounds move
ment everywhere and consequent de
mand for efficient supervisors, should
make the girls here ready to avail
themselves of the privilege' of this
course.
Instructor H. W. Maloney will again
have charge of the classes in fencing.
The first meeting of the beginner's
class in the use of the foil and mask
was held this afternoon in the Roble
gym. The advanced sections will meet
every Tuesday and Thursday at four
o'clock. Later on in the semester an
informal hour of fencing between the
advanced classes of California and
Stanford will be held.
