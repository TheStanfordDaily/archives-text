# UNIVERSITY CREDIT WILL BE GIVEN FOR BAND PLAYING.
## Faculty Recognizes Worthy Work of Stanford Musicians. â€” One Hour Will be Given. 
### 
As announced at a meeting of the
Hand held yesterday afternoon the
University will give one hour of credit
each semester to all those who play,
and practice regularly twice a week
in that organization.
This announcement was gladly re
ceived by all the members as they
have been trying to secure such recog
nition for some time. Until this year
the matter was given very little con
sideration by the Faculty owing to the
small number interested in band work.
Last semester, however, such a large
number turned out, and accomplished
such good results that it was decided
to give the musicians official recogni
tion.
About thirty-two men attended the
meeting yesterday and signified their
intention of playing this semester, but
Professor E. W. Martin, who will again
direct the organization, would like to
Increase the enrollment to about forty.
When the new inducement becomes
known others are expected to join,
which will bring the total up to the
desired number. Several of the men
who played last semester are out for
track at present, but they will prob
ably find time to join later on.
Practices will be held every Tuesday
and Thursday afternoon, and in the
spring a series of concerts will be
given. An election of officers will
probably lie held Thursday.
