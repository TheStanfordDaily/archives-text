# DR. JORDAN REPEATS ADDRESS TO WOMEN'S ASSOCIATION
## 
### 
"The Religion of a Sensible Amer
ican" also served as an address by
President D. S. Jordan before the Y.
W. C. A. yesterday afternoon. The
lecture was largely that given before
the Y. M. C. A. Sunday evening. He
applied his ideas to the religion of a
modern young women and especially
emphasised two points in the teachings
of Jesus; first that he was not inter
ested in forms, ceremonies, and fine
points of doctrine, and secondly, that
his ideal was to bring good cheer,
helpfulness, and the making of life
worth while, through establishing the
right relationship between people and
the power of the universe.
