### 
At a late hour last evening unknown
persons entered the premises of
Charles Meyers in Menlo Park and
succeeded in carrying away with them
one ot the initialed table tops that the
proprietor has accumulated during
the past years. The entrj was made
through a window in the rear ot the
building. No damage was done, or
any other property taken except the
table. Although it is not known at
the present time whether the work
was done by professional thieves,
Meyers has offered to allow the matter
to drop if those whom he thinks have
taken the table as c joke will return
the same to him or inform him of its
whereabouts. The only information
secured by the authorities who aro
working on the case is that the per
sons responsible for the disanpearan'-e
of the property used hors< and car
riage in their work.
The tabic was one of the most re
cent of those accumulated b\ Meyers
in his business in th' 3 locality and wa

carved and initialed in the usual mau
ler in which these tops have been
narked for many years pa-st.
