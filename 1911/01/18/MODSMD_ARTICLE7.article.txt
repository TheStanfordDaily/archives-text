# DRAMATIC INNOVATION FOR MIRACLE PLAYS
## MORNING PERFORMANCE WILL BE GIVEN. Two Productions Necessary to Accommodate Crowds Expected to Witness Plays 
### 
An innovation in Stanford dramatics
will be seen when the English Club
presents the Miracle Plays in the As
sembly Hall next month. The innova
tion will be a matinee performance 011
the morning 01 February -I.
There never has been a more active
campaign 01 advertising in connection
with any Stanford dramatic production
than is now in progress for the three
•Miracle Plays. Feature stories will be
run in the San Francisco dalies ot this
week. The "Bulletin" and the "Chron
icle" will contain full page stories of
the plays, the former on Saturday
evening, tho latter 011 Sunday.
The plays are being extensively ad
vertised among the towns and cities
adjacent to Stanford, and arrange
ments have been made whereby people
from San Jose, San Mateo and other
places will come to Stanford for the
morning performance.
The evening performance 011 Friday
the third of February will be especial
ly for Stanfordites and their friends,
although the performance will be
identical. According to present in
dications a large crowd will be pres
ent from Stanford and Palo Alto.
It must not be thought that just be
cause the plays are ancient, they are
dry and dull. Quite the opposite is
true. The Miracle Plays are among
the first dramatic productions in Eng
lish, and through them the beginnings
of modern drama—farce, tragedy, and
musical comedy, may be traced. It is
confidently asserted by those in charge
ot the production, that the "Second
Shepherd's Play" is as good a farce to
day as it was five hundred years ago,
and that the average modern farce is
deadly dull in comparison with this
brilliant early humorus work.
The committee in charge of arrange
ments is making active preparations
to care for the crowd that it is expect
ing from outside localities for the
matinee.
The cast of leading characters is
complete and the lines have been
learned. All the rehearsals from now
on will be devoted to removing the
rough spots from the preformance.
An excellent presentation is assured.
