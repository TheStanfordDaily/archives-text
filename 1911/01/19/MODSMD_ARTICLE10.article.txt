The action of the Faculty in allow
ing an hour's credit for playing in the
Stanford Band is praiseworthy. No
single group of men have received as
little recognition and at the same
time have deserved more than the Car
dinal musicians. These men are in
dispensable to the spirit of the Uni
versity and they never have been more
helpful than during the past semester,
when under the leadership of Profes
sor E. W. Martin they have attained
their highest proficiency. We look for
ward to the time when the Stanford
rooting section will be represented by
as large a band as are the California
bleachers.
