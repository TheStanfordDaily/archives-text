# Conflicting Dates.
## 
### 
It is unfortunate that several social
affairs are scheduled for the evening
of February 4, when the Carnot De
bate will be held in Assembly Hall.
This Intercollegiate event should be
shown the same respect as other con
tests with the University of California
and we uree a postponment of the
conflicting dates.
