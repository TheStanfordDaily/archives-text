# FIFTEEN NEW MEN TURN OUT FOR INITIAL PRACTICE.
## 
### 
About fifteen more men turned out
for the initial baseball practice last
night on the auxiliary diamond, swel
ling the number of candidates to about
GO. These with the new material which
will sign up during the next few days,
should make the total equal the num
ber which turned out last year.
Easy work was the order of the day.
Hatting and fielding practice busied
the squad while the pitchers were
warming up. The diamond was then
filled and each man was given a
chance at the plate. While little may
lie determined from the first practice,
the showing made by the new men
and veterans was entirely satisfactory.
