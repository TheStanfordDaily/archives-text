# DISTINGUISHED EASTERN EDUCATOR SPEAKS
## PRESIDENT OF JAPANESE UNIVERSITY TALKS ON PEACE. Dr. Jordan's Course on International Arbitration Listens to Brief Address by Eastern Authority. 
### 
President Harada, of the University
of Doshisho, situated at Kyoto, Japan,
as the guest, ot Dr. Jordan spoke this
morning at the latter's course in Inter
national Arbitration. Nothing could
have been offered as a more conclusive
demonstration of the spread of the
peace movement than this address of
the scholar from the Far East.
Dr. Harada, some twenty years ago,
was a student in this country doing
special work on American institutions
and when he returned to Japan he was
appointed after a short time to the
position he now holds. The University
of Doshisho was founded some fifty
years ago by one of the first Japanese
scholars of note to receive his educa
tion in this country. It was originally
founded on a sectarian basis, but it
has since separated itself from the
church, and is now non sectarian.
About 900 students are taking work
there.
Dr. Harada is one of the foremost
advocates of international peace in
Japan, being president of the Kyoto
branch of the Japanese Peace Society,
which is the second largest in the
Empire. He nas uui rtueuuj icimued
from a trip through Europe, wnere ne
delivered lectures on the peace prob
lem. During his lectures in the Brit
ish Isles on the subject "Peace in
Japan" the University of Edinburgh
gave him the honorary degree of LL.
D.
President Harada spoke as follows
before Dr. Jordan's class this morn
ing:
"The more I study the problem of
peace in Japan the more I come to the
conclusion that the people of the
world are nearer to each other than is
generally thought. The people think
that the East and the West are separ
ated, but they are not. They are as
similating each other. When we con
sider many things we see that we are
not so very different after all. You
judge the Japanese by some on the
Coast here, and we judge the Ameri
cans by some here on the Coast also.
When each of us know the best, of us
there is no difference between us.
There is no use nor fact in these war
stories. That is all nonsense. Peace
is our idea. Let us bring every idea
toward peaceâ€”the peace of the world."
