# MUSICIANS PLAN GREAT SONG FESTIVAL SOON
## ORATORIO SOCIETY AND SCHUBERT CLUB TO UNITE. Noted Soloists, Singing Clubs, and Orchestra to be Heard in Concert. 
### 
Plans for the big music festival to
be given jointly by the Oratorio So
ciety and the Schubert Club on the
evening of February 24 are well under
way. The program is to be entirely a
musical one, with McKenzie Gordan,
the well known tenor of San Fran
cisco, as the soloist. The society has
made a very happy selection in secur
ing Mr. Gordon as he has the reputa
tion of being one of the sweetest tenor
singers on the coast. It has been
nearly ten years since his last appear
ance at Stanford. This will give to a
large number of students the rare
treat of hearing him for the first time.
Mr. Gordon is to sing a number of
solos during the evening. The society
is to fill the remainder of the program
with a number of classical chorus
numbers in which about 200 voices
will be heard.
Mrs. Bibby Brown, of Palo Alto, has
been secured for the soprano solo
parts. There are to be four or five
chorus numbers of which "Gallia," the
great, religious classic by Charles
Gounod, will be the feature. Another
well known and beautiful selection
will be "A Hymn to Music," by W. D.
Buck. These selections promise to be
exceptionally fine as Mrs. Brown is a
singer of well known ability. Assisted
by two hundred of Stanford's best
singers she should give local music
lovers a more than usually fine pro
duction.
There will be no tryouts for the
chorus work. The society will gladly
accept all singers who report at prac
tice which is held every Tuesday even
ing at 7:30 in room 08. The Glee Club
is expected to take an active part in
the chorus work, but the society still
needs several tenors.
The University orchestra, augment
ed by several talented musicians from
San Francisco and San Jose, will play
throughout the evening. A meeting.of
the Oratorio Society was held recently,
and an election of officers resulted as
follows: President, Miss P. H. Shel
don, '13; secretary, Miss V. Wagner,
'13; treasurer, E. A. Wells, '14; librar

been secured for the soprano solo
parts. There are to be four or five
chorus numbers of which "Gallia," the
great, religious classic by Charles
Gounod, will be the feature. Another
well known and beautiful selection
will be "A Hymn to Music," by W. D.
Buck. These selections promise to be
exceptionally fine as Mrs. Brown is a
singer of well known ability. Assisted
by two hundred of Stanford's best
singers she should give local music
lovers a more than usually fine pro
duction.
There will be no tryouts for the
chorus work. The society will gladly
accept all singers who report at prac
tice which is held every Tuesday even
ing at 7:30 in room 08. The Glee Club
is expected to take an active part in
the chorus work, but the society still
needs several tenors.
The University orchestra, augment
ed by several talented musicians from
San Francisco and San Jose, will play
throughout the evening. A meeting.of
the Oratorio Society was held recently,
and an election of officers resulted as
follows: President, Miss P. H. Shel
don, '13; secretary, Miss V. Wagner,
