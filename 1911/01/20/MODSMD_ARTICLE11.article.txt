## WESTERN HOLD-UP OCCURS ON UNIVERSITY ROAD. Charlie Meyers' Table is Recovered in Running Fight With Desperadoes. â€” One killed. 
### 
The mystery of the lost table lias
been solved, the culprit has been cap
tured, and sentenced to a punishment
so severe that even the hardned habi
tues of the court-room winced when
the judge pronounced sentence.
By those who were fortunate enough
to be near the Law steps at 9:15, or
thereabouts, this morning, a singular
sight was witnessed, A western hold
up with all the accoutraments down to
the smallest detail was enacted for the
interested spectators. The only point
where it departed in the least from
strict reality, jmd assumed the tone of
a moving picture hold-up, was when
the detective on the case felt it his
duty to soliloquize on himself. In his
excitement he disengaged his truly
Jack Daltonesque mustache from its
proper place.
It was a wildly exciting scene. Two
men attired in the proverbial hold-up
costume hid themselves in a safe po
sition behind a friendly bicycle. A de
tective and a policeman appeared on
the scene. In the midst of the detec
tive's harangue the culprits appeared.
They were seated in a single rig
drawn by a woe-begone horse. As one
spectator remarked, the horse seemed
to be both gun broke, and wind broke.
Behind them was the long lost and
mysterious table. As the minions of
the law advanced to stop the rig the
highwaymen stepped out from their
hiding place and with a hurried word
or two emphasized by a couple of
prominent Colt revolvers, they escaped
in the rig with the booty. A running
fight ensued in which one of the sup
porters of law and order was slain. A
sheet which appeared miraculously
on the scene was used to cover the
poor corpse.
An hour later the scene was re
enacted with silent revolvers, owing
to the objections of the Business
Office, and in this thrilling act the
bandits were captured.
The final scene was on the Post
Office steps where the prisoner was
tried and found guilty of murder. He
was sentenced to spend five years at.
