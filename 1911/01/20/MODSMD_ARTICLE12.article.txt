# Ganong Troubled With Sore Throat.
## 
### 
A sore throat will keep C. F. Gan
ong, '10, off the baseball field for a
couiile of days. The coach first felt
the soreness last night and as a pre
cautionary move remained in his room
today. He will be out on the field
again on Monday however, ready to
continue his work.
