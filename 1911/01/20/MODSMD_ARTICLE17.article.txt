# Let's Have a. Diamond
## 
### 
Baseball is called a major sport at
Stanford. And yet every year we see
the Varsity nine for the first month or

so of its preliminary prac
tice games in January
and February begging or
stealing a diamond on

which to play; that or not play at all.
When the gym. class is playing soccer
the baseball players are relegated to
the mudflats somewhere on the other
side of the football bleachers. There
they must be able to learn the art of
baseballing on a field that would put
the ordinary prep, school to shame.
The nine plays hit-or-miss, on what
ever diamond it can get, until it is
told to get off, gloves, bats and bag
gage.
The field on which the "big" Varsity
Baseball Team meets Caliofrnia or the
expert Santa Clara and St. Mary's
Colleges is alternately called the
Gymnasium Field, the Auxiliary Dia
mond, or the turf on the Football
Field, depending upon where the
powers-that-be happen to put their
own. But what is the matter with
the splendid turf on the Football Field
as a diamond? Yes, it IS splendid turf,
but it is not a baseball diamond.
There are several strong reasons for
saying this. The first is: that the
base lines are grass. How much speed
and how much "base-sliding" can a
baserunner execute on that grass?
How many real baseball teams play
on a field whose baselines are, to
speak in diamond language, "nn
skinned?" When the rains come the
baseball fielders and baserunners alike
are about as sure of their footing on
that grass as they would be on a piece

of glassy smooth ice. The ideal dia
mond is one in which only about a
third of the infield is turf. The re
mainder of the infield and the inner
margin of the outfield, together with
' a wide path between the pitcher's and
! catcher's boxes are "skinned"—that is,
with no grass. Why cannot Stanford
have such a field, to be known as the
Baseball Team's only-own Baseball
Field.
The Stanford share of the Football
game last fall was over twenty thou
sand dollars. Let us take some of that
and build a diamond. Let us raise
the sport from what it is now and
make a live Stanford Varsity nine,
full of vitality and "go"—that will
win a series from the two big Catho
lic teams once in a while; and will
defeat California from pure excellence,
and nothing else. In almost every
other American college the national
game is pushing football so close for
popularity and gate receipts that there
is little comparison between the two.
Give us a diamond to be proud of and
there will be more than forty-five men
in the squad—and we will have a team
to be proud of—not a team that is a
by-word, and which can be beaten by
just a little extra exertion, as witness
several games last year called until
the ninth inning a Stanford victory.
Let us take the five hundred dollars
we saved this year in having an un
paid Baseball coach, and help build
the diamond and a baseball training
house, to which the players will come
with enthusiasm and where they can
each have a locker in which to stow
away each his own glove and his bat
and his valuables. Give us a diamond
and a house. Then, and only then will
the Stanford Nine become a baseball
power in the land.
The Daily Palo Alto suggests as a
location for the diamond the large
field on the right of the road leading
from Encina Hall to the Football
bleachers, a place close to the play
grounds of Stanford's other sports.
