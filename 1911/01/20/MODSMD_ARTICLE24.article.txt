# TENNIS CLUB MAKES RULES FOR VARSITY TRYOUTS.
## Winners of Four Preliminary Tournaments Will be Intercollegiate Representatives. 
### 
At a recent meeting rules to govern
the Varsity tryout tennis tournaments
were drawn up by the Tennis Club as
follows:
1. There shall be four regular
singles tryouts for the tennis team.
2. No student shall be eligible to
play in any try-out after having won
one of the preceding tournaments.
3. The winners of these four tourna
ments shall constitute the Varsity ten
nis team.
4. The ranking of the four players
shall be determined by a round robin
tournament, the three best men to
make up the Varsity singles team.
5. The matches of the round robin
shall be decided by two out of three
sets all to be advantage.
ti. The two doubles teams shall be
decided upon and ranked through com
mon agreement between the captain
and the three other members of the
team.
7. One substitute for the tennis
team shall be chosen by tournament
play between all players beaten in the
fourth tryout by its winner.
(t was at first thought necessary to
have an extra tournament so the men
who are out for track could have a
chance to play in the matches which
come the Saturday after the meet. But
"Dad" Moulton has consented to let
track men participate in the first try
out.
. The date for the first try-out was
not set but, it will be run-off immed
iately after the Thiele tournament is
completed.
The resignations of G. L. Shaul, Jr.,
'13, and H. L. Loud, '13, from the
offices of vice-president and secretary
treasurer, respectively, of the club
were accepted and S. C. Kennedy, '12,
and J. A. Davis, '12, were elected to
fill the vacancies.
