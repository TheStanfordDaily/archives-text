# CARNOT DEBATE TRYOUTS WILL BE HELD JANUARY 27.
## Many Speakers Will Enter Competition for Position on Stanford Team. 
### 
With the same rigid conditions pre
vailing which exist at the Carnot De
bate itself, the tryout for the selection
of the Stanford speakers in this event
will be held in the Chapel on Friday
evening January 27. The general sub
ject of this year's Carnot is "The Re
lation of the French Government to
the Labor Problem." Two hours be
fore the time scheduled for the tryout
a specific phrase of this subject w ill be
announced, upon which the contestants
are to speak later in the evening.
This rigid adherence in the selective
contest to the rules of the larger de
bate will insure the choice of men
with the largest and most thorough
knowledge of the subject, most read
iness at. what is very nearly impromp
tu speech, and in general the greatest
individual brilliance, which is the
prime factor for success in the Carnot.
Among those who have signified
their intention of contesting for the
three places and alternate position to
be filled at this tryout are R. J. Miller,
'11, M. H. Henshaw, '12, F. H. Hilton,
'11, G. Hoi comb, '11, and E. E. Tincher,
'12. These men have had wide exper
ience in Stanford forensic work, and
should prove equal to the demands of
this unique and most exacting debate.
February 4, eight days after the try
out, will occur the Carnot itself, which
is this year to be held in Stanford As
sembly Hall. Details for this contest
have not as yet been arranged.
