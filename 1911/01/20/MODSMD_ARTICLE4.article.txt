# MARCH 23 IS PROBABLE DATE OF "THE UVERNIAN PRINCESS."
## Junior Opera Committee Desirous of Many Candidates for Parts in Coming Production. 
### 
"The Uvernian Princess" the 1912
Junior Opera will probably be given in
Assembly Hall on March 23. This
date although not final is the probable
time of the production. The final se
lection will be made next week. Jun
ior Week will probably fall just before
the mid-semester vacation and the
opera will be given as the first of the
festivities.
This opera will be the first since the
1907 production of "Butterfly Isle"
written by local people. The authors
of the present vehicle are .Miss M.
Herdman, ex-'l2, J. H. Forbes, '13, and
J. Mac Donald, '14. "The Uvernian
Princess" is by far the most preten
tious opera offered in recent years
and bids fair to far eclipse anything
ever seen on the Stanford sta;;e. The
plot is unusual and very cleverly
worked up while the music is of a
very high order.
The opera provides places for a
large number of singers and unusual
opportunities are offered for those
making parts. All who can sing are
urged to tryout so that the coach may
be able to select the principals and
chorus from the best material in col
lege. The committee is working hard
on the preparations and no expense
will be spared in making the produc
tion the best ever presented by a Jun
ior class.
The tryouts will be conducted next
Monday and Tuesday as announced
last night. The success of the pro
duction depends largely on the num
ber who compete for roles, so a large
number of contestants is hoped for at
the time set for the selection of the
cast.
