# DR. JORDAN SPEAKS OF STANFORD'S EARLY DAYS
## PRESIDENT TALKS ON SUBJECTS OF VITAL INTEREST. Many Facts in Inner History of University Made Public at Banquet. 
### 
Before the Commonwealth Club of
San Francisco, at the regular weekly
luncheon of that organization, held at
the Palace Hotel, President David
Starr Jordan, on last Saturday, spoke
for the first time publicly of many
facts of University history which had
never before been revealed. The fam
ous "Ross affair" was spoken of and
the inside facts of the case laid bare;
the conditions preceding the "peer
ade" of 1908 were discussed; and the
construction of the buildings destroy
ed in the earthquake of 1906 was com
mented on.
In regard to the dismissal of Ross,
Dr. Jordan cleared up with a few
words all the points which had been
uncertain ever since the occurance of
the original episode.
The President next turned to the
liquor problem as it existed at the time
of the 1908 trouble. He said that at
that time drinking was carried to an
extreme; that on one occasiou 200 men
were intoxicated on the campus at one
time, and that as a result of this at
least 20 men were treated for alcohol
ism, and some for delerium tremens.
Fraternities on the campus came in
for a share of disclosures. Referring
to the fraternities of that period Dr.
Jordan said: "All of the fraternities,
with the exception of three, were open
saloons."
The University authorities after this
affair decided that a change must take
place. With that purpose in mind the
present regime was inaugurated.
Speaking of the University since the
enforcement of the rule the President
said: "There is no question but that
the enforcement of this rule has pro
duced a better feeling on the campus
than ever before. Since the temper
ance law went into effect the class
room markings are 50 per cent better
than they were before."
One of the most significant state
ments made by Dr. Jordan was as fol
lows: "We are simply doing at Stan
ford, in followiwng out these drastic
measures, what every university and
college in the country that does its
duty, has got to come to. At those col
leges where they have no trouble of
this kind it is simply because thev
don't pay any attention to it."
Because of the lack of funds, fol
lowing the long suit betwen the Uni
versity and the government, it was
necessary to build the chapel, gym
nasium, and other later buildings of
brick with a stone veneer, instead of
solid stone, as were the first struct
ures. The result was the total de
struction of these buildings in the
earthquake of 1906, and the loss to tho
University of $3,000,000.
The President in closing decried the
idea of a university with state endow
ments for Southern California.
