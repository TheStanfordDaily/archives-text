# UPHOLDS DIVINITY OF JESUS OF NAZARETH.
## Dr. D. Charles Gardner in Chapel Sermon Declares Christ no Ordinary Man. 
### 
Taking as his text John 12:32, "And
1, if I be lifted up, will draw all men
unto me," Dr. Gardner gave a short
but helpful talk yesterday morning
011 the foundations of the world-wide
power of the name of Christ. "Jesus
was not a common man, but was di
vine," he said, proving his statement
by tracing the rise of the humble
carpenter of Nazereth from his simple
birth to the place of love and devo
tion in the hearts of all his followers.
He emphasized three bases for the
faith of these followers, first, what he
taught; secondly, what he said; and
lastly, what he was."In this latter,
said Dr. Gardner, "lies the secret of his
supremacy, in his true divinity, his
oneness with the Faher, his riumph
ant resurrection."
Exceptionally good music added to
the service. Mr. Alfred Rockwood
sang a solo with an anthemn by the
choir, while Miss La Fetra's sympathe
tic singing of Gounod's "Oh Divine
Redeemer" gave new inspiration to
the subject of the sermon.
