Dramatic ability in abundance made
an unusually hard task for Coach
Frank L. Mathieu, in the final selec
tion of the cast of the Sophomore Play
at the tryout Saturday afternoon. The
list of second-year people who appear
ed before him at that time included a
number of Thespians already known
upon the Assembly Hall boards. The
Coach is more than satisfied with the
cast as chosen and expects good re
sults from the coming rehearsal.
In the leading role, the "Senator
from the West," E. F. Kern will dem
onstrate another side of his versatile
dramatic ability. Kern will be re
membered especially in the 1910 Min
strel Show, where he showed his un
doubted talents as a comedian. In
the tryouts he proved himself capable
of more serious work and should score
a hit in Win. H. Crane's old role. He
is a member of Beta Theta Pi.
Miss Dorothy Parkinson will take
the part of "Mabel Denman," whose
charms attract both the Senator and
an Austrian count. Miss Parkinson,
who has had considerable experience
in varied parts, has appeared in Stan
ford dramatics upon several occasions,
notably in"The Eternal Girl," given
by the Sophomore women last semes
ter. Miss Parkinson is Alpha Phi.
E. B. Gilmore will be seen as "Count
Von Strahl," the Austrian diplomat
who simultaneously courts "Mabel
Denman and the wife of the "Secre
tary of State,"and is unsuccessful in
both affairs. Gilmore was seen in the
chorus of "Iolanthe" and will have
possibilities in this part to create a
strikingly animated character. He is
a member of Delta Upsilon.
As "Mrs. Hillary," the vivacious and
sophisticated young widow, Miss O. M.
McDermott will appear to particular
advantage In a role remarkably adapt
ed to her ability. Miss McDermott was
In the chorus of "The Mikado." She is
enrolled in Delta Delta Delta.
To S. Brown has been entrusted one
of the most difficult parts in the play,
that of "Silas Denman," a relict of the
days of Webster, whose claim against
the United States government has been
sidetracked for forty years, and is
finally ushered through by the ener
getic Senator. In this legitimate role
Brown will make a departure from
musical work, in which he has ap

peared upon several occasions, most
notably in the Beman-Brown skit in
the 1910 Track meet Vaudeville. He
also was in the cast of "The Road to
Yesterday." Beta Theta Pi is Brown's
Miss Jo Long will assume the part,
of "Mrs. Armstrong," the unhappy wife
of the Secretary of State, whose in
fatuation for "Count Von Strahl"
nearly ends in an elopement, which : s
averted by the widow and the Senator.
Miss Long appeared in the choruses
of "lolauthe" and"The Mikado" and
is a member of Delta Delta Delta.
To Miss F. S. Ober will be intrusted
the part of "Josie Armstrong," Miss
Armstrong's step daughter. Miss
Ober is well cast in this role and
should give a good interpretation of it.
She is a member of Delta Gamma.
The exceptionally good part of
"Richard Vance, the Senator's Private
Secretary," will be assumed by J. H.
Mathews. Mathews will have an ex
cellent opportunity for good work in
this wide awake role and should score
a hit. He is a member of Kappa Sigma
and Encina Club.
As "Ling Ching, the Chinese Ambas
sador," A. J. Scholl will have an op
portunity to create a true comedy
character. Scholl is Kappa Sigma.
W. M. Rannells will play "Alexander
Armstrong, the Secretary of State."
Although the lines of the part are few,
the character appears to good advant
age in the important scenes. Rannells
is a member of Encina Club.
Miss M. Thompson will play "Mrs.
Schuyler, the Wahsington gossip and
scandalmonger."
J. J. Martin will be seen as "Lieu
tenant Schupler," the foppish son of
"Mrs. Schuyler," who falls in love with
the widow. Martin is Sigma Alpha
Epsilon.
The nearest approach to a "heavy"
is "Sharpless. ex-Congressman,"
whose underhand deals get him in dis
favor in political circles. F. I. Tngra
ham will play the part of the unscrup
ulous politician. Ingraham is enrolled
in Delta Kappa Epsilon.
C. T. Keefer will play "Erastus,"
the colored butler of "Senator Rivers."
The part offers a good opportunity for
character acting.
The first rehearsal. will be held
Tuesday at 1:30 in the old bookstore
opposite the end of the campus carline.
