# TRACK ATHLETES WILL COMPETE THIS WEEK
## EVERY MAN OUT WILL BE SEEN IN SATURDAY'S MEET. Freshmen Will Meet California on March 18._"Dad" Calls for More First Year Men. 
### 
Saturday afternoon the Track en
thusiasts will be given their first op
portunity to size up the Cardinal's
prospects lor this season when both
novices and old men will try con
clusions in their respective events on
the Cinder path. Captain Hellah has
planned two separate contests in each
event; one in which only Freshmen
and novices will compete, and the
other for the old members of the
squad.
The developing of a strong Fresh
man team this year, is the task which
is at present confronting "Dad" Moul
ton. As has been the case with Stan
ford teams in the past, the 1914 aggre
gation can boast of several men who
are likely first place winners, but
there is a decided lack of material to
be looked upon to capture second and
third honors. "Dad" has registered
another call for more Freshmen to
appear.
Two meets are being arranged this
year in which only the Freshmen will
compete before they clash with the
California babies on March IS. These
meets will probably be against Santa
Clara, one on the campus and the
other on their opponents oval.
An innovation is to be tried this
year in hope of finding the possibili
ties of the novices. A series of relay
races is to be run three times a week
in which every man out is expected to
compete. Each runner will have to
cover 110 yards. Five teams are to be
picked and any number of men will
lie entered upon handing their names
to "Dad" or Captain Bellah.
The schedule of meets has not been
arranged as yet, but it is definitely
known that the Varsity will journey to
Los Angeles on March 4 to compete
with the University of Southern Cali
fornia.
