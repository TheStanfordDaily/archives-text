After a somewhat belated announce
ment, the Seinor Class will hold its
first meeting of the semester tomorrow
afternoon. The meeting
The should be well attended.
Last Lap Every year the cry goes
out that too little interest
is taken in Class affairs by Seniors.
But few turn out to the meetings and
a still less number have to shoulder
all the responsibility of what activity
is engaged in.
1911 so far in its career has been
an active class. A lively interest has
been taken in its projects, plans and
endeavors and they have been carried
thru to a successful conclusion. Can
not 1911 ia its last semester as an
undergraduate organization show the
same attitude? Cannot the spirit dur
ing these last few months be vital and
fraternal? The past three and a half
years have been pleasant and valuable
to all of us, why not the last half the
happiest and most precious?
The Daily Palo Alto would suggest
the holding in the near future of an
other one of those jolly-ups so fortu
nately instituted by 1911. Senior sing
ing should be enjoyed by all in the
same way. As many informal gather
ings as possible should be held. We
urge an immediate election of officers
and as prompt an appointment of com
mittees. The Senior Farce Committee
when selected should choose a play be
fore that time when we are all primar
ily interested in the final tustle with
the curriculum â€”"ex" week.
