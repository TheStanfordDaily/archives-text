Last year saw the most successful
dramatic season in Stanford's history.
A total of nine productions were
staged in Assembly Hall
Dramatics and it was freely predict
ed that it would be a cold
day before another such array of
talent and another such series of
highly entertaining and well acted
plays would be seen by a campus
audience.
Such a prediction was well founded
but from present prospects we do not
believe it will be fulfilled. This se
mester augurs well to be an extremely
satisfactory one from an histrionic
viewpoint. For the first time in three
years we will see an original Junior
opera. For the first time we will see
all the musical organizations united
in giving a great oratorio. Both of
these are unique undertakings and
more should enter the tryouts.
For the present we would speak
especially of the Miracle Plays. Ot all
the dramatic ventures this is the most
unique, and its success will do much
to make the season as a whole the suc
cess it deserves to be. The season de
serves success because it is original.
We are writing and acting our own
plays. These are better than dis
carded stock productions, even il not
so finished.
The Miracle Plays have been trans
lated from the original Anglo Saxon
by Professor Lee Emerson Bassett and
they will be presented for the first
time in America by Stanford students
on the Stanford stage. For this reason
alone, if for no other, the English
Club should be accorded the heartiest
support. It is too seldom that a ser
ious effort of such significance is at
tempted by Stanford organizations.
The Miracle Plays are the starting
point of modern drama. They are
highly entertaining and of great edu
cational value. If proper support is
given the two productions here the
English Club will present them at the
Greek Theatre at. the University of
California. Buy your tickets early.
