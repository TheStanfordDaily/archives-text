A. L. Elliott for use in her class in
embroidery, and were by her loaned
to the Art Department for exhibition
purposes. They may be seen tomor
row in the Studio, room 311.
These embroideries have been de
signed by advanced workers in the
Newcomb School, who have drawn the
design upon the fabric. The embroid
ery upon most of the pieces has been
well started, and in this unfinished

decorative art work of a high grade,
but who lack the necessary training,
