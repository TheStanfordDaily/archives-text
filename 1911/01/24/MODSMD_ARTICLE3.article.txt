Although the casts for the Miracle
Plays has been completed for some
time they were not made known until
today, when the final arrangement as
it will appear on the Assembly Hall
program on February :5 and 4 was an
nounced. All the information that can
be obtained in regard to the plays
points to a more than usually success
ful performance. Daily rehearsals
are being held and a finished produc
tion is assured.
More than common interest is being
shown in the plays both from the
standpoint of a revival of an ancient
dramatic form, and also from the
standpoint ot a play for entertain
ment's sake. It is announced by those
in charge that if sufficient interest is
shown in the plays as presented here
they will be taken away from the
campus and given at least one presen
tation at the Greek theatre ot the Uni
versity of California.
Although the cast does not include !
the names ot many who are well
known in Stanford dramatic circles, it
is not to be supposed that this will
mean a poor performance from the
acting standpoint. The plays are of
such a nature that experience is not
a prime requisite for the successful
carrying of a part. The fact that they

were originally presented by peasants,
quite without education, or dramatic
training, demonstrates that college
men and women of ability can carry a
performance through to more than a
successful close.
In the play of "The Three Kings"
the principal role of Herod will be
taken by C. M. Vrang, *13. Vrang was
seen in the "Devil's Disciple" in the
part ot Chaplain Brudenell. The parts
of the Three Kings are next in im
portance in this play.
Mak, who steals a sheep, in the
"Second Shepherd's Play," and thereby
causes considerable merriment, will be
acted by C. C. Close, '14. This is one of
the cleverest and liest of the early
Miracle Play parts.
R. .J. Finnie, '11', will be seen as Gab
riel in the play of "The Salutation and
the Nativity." This with the part of
Octavian are the leading roles.
Miss A. Holmes. '12, will take the
part of Mary, in both the "Salutation
and the Nativity," and the"Three
Kings." In the part of Gill, Mak's wife,
in the "Second Shepherd's Play" Miss
N. M. Molse, '12, has an excellent part.
From all present indication the plays
will be quite as successful as their
most sanguine supporters have hoped
to make them.
