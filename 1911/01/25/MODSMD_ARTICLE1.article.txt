# COMMITTEE READY TO LAUNCH UNION BOOM
## CAMPAIGN OUTLINED AT MEETING THIS AFTERNOON. $44,000 Has Been Subscribed to Fund. $21,000 has been Paid up to Date. 
### 
Plans to start an active campaign
for funds for the building of the Stan
ford Union were formulated this after
noon at a meeting of the Stanford
Union Committee. Collectors will be
appointed within the next few days by
Chairman H. G. Ferguson, to secure
payments upon life memberships..
These men will endeavor to secure
more life members to the union and
also to obtain subscribtions from one
dollar upward from those who cannot
take out life memberships. These
subscriptions will be credited to those
making them and will serve as part
payment towards a life membership,
provided the subscriber should later
decide to give further backing to the
union.
A design is now being made for the
life membership certificates. These
will probably be in the nature of an
etching and will represent the highest
type of Stanford art on this line. As
soon as the certificates are finished
they will be issued to all who have
paid their $.">0 into the treasury. The
names of all life members will also be
inscribed upon the walls of the com
pleted union. Some form of recog
nition will also be given to all who
subscribed to the fund, the -exact
nature of this to be determined at a
later time.
Approximately $14,000 has been sub
scribed to the fund to date, according
to Chairman Ferguson. Of this, the
sum of $21,000 has been paid in by
graduates and undergraduates who
are enrolled among the life members
oi* who have subscribed to the fund.
The greatest benefit from the union
will go to the present class of first
year men, yet to date they have failed
to back the project. The cooperation
of the men of 1914 and a. ready re
sponse on their part to the call for
life members would insure the laying
of the cornerstone of the Stanford
Union before the end of this semester.
