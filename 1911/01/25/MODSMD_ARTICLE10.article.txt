# Mercer and Carter
## 
### 
The Y. M. C. A. is to be congratu
lated in securing Mercer and Carter to
speak to the men of Stanford. Mem-

bers of the Junior and
Senior Classes having
heard the first named
on several occasions

two years ago know him as a speaker
of compelling force and genuine sin
cerity. He made a profound impres
sion upon the many hundreds who
crowded Assembly Hall then and we
are informed that he is a much more
effective speaker today. His team
mate, Carter, has an equally high rep
utation.
Having nothing of the "holier than
thou" about them these two univer
sity graduates have met with great
results in their work among univer
sity men. Social reformers who are at
the same time virile, red-blooded men
are rare and are welcome in any com
munity. The meeting tomorrow night
should be well attended.
