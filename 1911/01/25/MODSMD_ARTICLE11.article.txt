The editorial task on any newspaper
is a thankless one. No matter what
the grade of work is, brickbats come

fast and plenty, with
the bouquets few and
far between. Wit-

ness the following from the principal
of a California High School:
"I will be frank to say to you, that
it would he more welcome, not only in
(his school but many others if the
reading matter in it were different
from what it is. Too much publicity
and too much importance is given to
accounts of class 'scraps,' 'roughneck
sports' and undesirable 'fraternity life
and activities,' all of which are most
detrimental to high school work and
spirit. When high school students
undertake to imitate the rougher
sports of college life the high school
becomes worthless.
"You probably do not realize this as
much as some of us who have had
much experience along such lines.
"I trust that you will understand
the frankness of my letter and that I
not only stand for the best and purest
in college life, but most of all for the
wellfare of the high school, of which I
have the honor to be responsible for
at present."
Chester A. Rowel 1 in addressing thr>
California Teachers' Association la-st

month said that there are too many
"superanuated sissy boys" among our
pedagogues. We hope that the teacher
who took such a cruel thrust at us
appreciates the truth of the Fresno
editor's remarks.
