# IRELAND CANNOT FLY AND IS BAD SWIMMER.
## For that Reason He Was Forced to Cancel His Game With the Varsity Today. 
### 
Charles Ireland, the valiant skipper
of the Iceland's Independents baseball
team, although an experienced helms
man, yet reports from San Francisco
that, in view of the recent moisture,
and the bad condition of water vehi
cles and ferry boats generally in the
Golden Gate city, that he would be un
able and unwilling to risk losing the
channel in steering his course around
the bases on the auxiliary diamond.
Moreover, the old captain sadly feared
that several of his crew were bad sail
ors. Admiral Ireland has not yei
learned to fly, although the score book
can be called to witness that he is an
expert on flies in the garden position
Still, he says, airships have not yet
been sanctioned by the Commission
of the National Game. For this rea
son, and taking everything into con
sideration, although the Stanford Var
sity would gladly have been "at home"
on this occasion, the tried and true
veteran in a communication this morn
ing to D. W. Burbank, graduate man
ager, advanced the opinion that St.ii
Francisco, in the present state of the
weather, looked better to him than the
Stanford campus. Therefore, the
game between the two teams, sched
uled for this afternoon, was cancelled.
Cardinal baseball fans will be forced
to stifle their impatience to see the In
dependents in action, until Saturday,
the eleventh of February, for which
time their second game is listed.
