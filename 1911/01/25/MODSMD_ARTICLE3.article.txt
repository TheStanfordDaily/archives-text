# MERCER AND CARTER WILL OPEN CAMPAIGN TOMORROW NIGHT
## Able College Speakers to Address Men in Assembly Hall.â€”Mandolin Club Will Play. 
### 
E. C. Mercer, Virginia, '93, who
played in the college championship
baseball games at the World's Fair in
1893, was a member of the college glee
club, Senior Society and Beta Theta
Pi fraternity, will speak tomorrow
evening in the Assembly Hall. His

subject for the evening will be, "Col
lege .Men that. I have met in the Pris
ons and Slums of New York."
.Mercer talks as one who knows and
has had much experience, lie began
drinking merely in a social way while
attending the university, and bis habit
gradually got the better o. him until
in the end be found himself completely
"down and out," without a rent of
money, and without a friend. In lOi'M
a change came, he was taken into the
old Jerry McAulej Mission in .Vsv
York City. During the last four years
Mercer has been telling his unfortu
nate experiences to other college men
throughout the United States and Can
ada and in this time he has addressed
more college men than has any other
known speaker. Those who heard him
speak when he was here two years a 30
tell us that he has an exceptionally
interesting story to tell.
Dr. .Jordan in endorsing Mercer has
signed bis name to the following:
"Referring to the lectures ot Mr. K. C.
Mercer, permit me to say that I re
gard them as extremely valuable in
turning the thought? of college men
in the right directions. Mr. Mercer is
in dead earnest. He is a picturesque
and effective speaker, and leaves with
the college men a very distinct im

pression of the dangers which are in
their path, and the way in which a
strong man may avoid them or re
cover himself if he should fall."
Student Advisor Roth, who will pre
side at the meeting has been quoted
as saying, "1 had the pleasure of hear-

ing the address of Mr. Mercer at
Stanford in 1909. He has a straight
forward, helpful message, which every
Stanford man should hear." K. L.
Dole, '11, captain of the football team,
I" L. Hill, '11, editor of the Daily Palo
Alto, and K. L. Schaupp, '12, Crew
captain, have also given their hearty
endorsement to hie meetings.
Reports from those at the University
| of Washington where Mercer has been
| holding meetings recently, state that
| his talks are more wonderful than
| they were two years ago, and that the
i improvement shown by the speaker is
| remarkable. One ot the prominent
j Washington professors has said of the
I meetings, "Never has such a. series of
addresses been so largely attended
with such evident good results as has
I been the Mercer and Carter meet
ings."
E. C. Cartel , Harvard, '00, who was
! an active debater while in the univer
| sity, and president in turn of the
i Freshman, Sophomore and Junior
j clubs, will also speak on Thursday
pveniiir'.
A short musical program will be
given by the Mandolin Club at 7:110
p.m. at this meeting and on Friday
evening the Hand will furnish the
musical pari of the program.
