# 1914 CREW CANDIDATES MAKE DEBUT ON WATER
## FRESHMEN WORK OUT IN PAIR FOR FIRST TIME. Prospects for a Winning Eight are Favorable. â€” Varsity Men Training Hard. 
### 
After ten days of preliminary train
ing consisting of setting-up exercises,
cross-country running and work on
the rowing machines, the candidates
for the Freshman crew went on the
lake today for the first time. The new
men will, for the present work out in
the pairoared barge until they become
more accustomed to the rowing, when
they will be placed in the shell. Train
ing will be done both morning and
evening under the direction of Captain
K. L. Schaupp, '12, and R. H. Seward,
'12.
The outlook for a winning Fresh
man crew is particularly bright. There
are twenty-five husky candidates for
positions in the boat besides eight
coxswains and it is the opinion of
Captain Schaupp that the 1914 eight
will be one of the best Freshman
crews ever turned out at Stanford.
Judging from the list of aspirants the
crew will average over 6 feet in height
and about 170 pounds in weight.
The old men have been rowing daily
on the lake in the four and plenty of
cross-country running has been in
dulged in to round them into shape.
No work has, as yet, been done in the
eight-oared shell as it can only be
used on the bay. Regular trips io
Redwood will be commenced in about
two weeks when the men are in better
condition.
