# SECRETARY OF SENIOR CLASS WILL BALLOT FOR OFFICE.
## 
### 
There being no contest for any of
the Senior class offices, President K.
L. Dole has authorized the secretary to
cast a ballot for the candidates named
at Tuesday's meeting. The with
drawal of Miss F. B. Haig as a candi
date for secretary makes an election
on the Quad unnecessary.
