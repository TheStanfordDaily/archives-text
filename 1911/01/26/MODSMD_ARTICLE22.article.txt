# SOCCER TEAMS WILL PLAY TWO GAMES ON SATURDAY
## First Eleven Will Meet San Franciscos in Afternoon. â€” Second Team Game in the Morning. 
### 
Two soccer sanies will be played
Saturday on the gymnasium field. The
tirst one is scheduled for 10:30 in the
morning between the Barbarians' "R"
team and the Stanford second team.
The former eleven is very fast, playing
nearly as good a game as the Barbar
ians' first team. The excellence of the
local contingent should insure a close
contest.
At 3:30 in the afternoon the San
Francisco's will meet the Stanford
first team in a league game. As both
of these elevens stand about even in
the league race a fast game is antici
pated.
