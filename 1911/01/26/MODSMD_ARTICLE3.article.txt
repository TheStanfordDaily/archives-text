## 
### 
At the women's meeting held this
noon in the Chapel it was announced
that, two prizes, one fifteen dollars
and the other ten dollars would be ot
tered by Cap and Gown for the two
best plans for the Stanford Women's
Clubhouse, which will soon be erected
at a cost of $25,000. The object in of
fering these prizes is to secure as
many suggestions for architectural
plans as possible.
The drawings submitted must in
clude a hall and staye wkh seating
capacity of six hundred, a dining room,
a kitchen, music rooms, committee
rooms, bedrooms and baths. It is not
necessary for the person who suggests
the plans to do the designing as this
can be done by another under his or
her direction.
All suggestions for this contest must
be mailed to Miss M. M. Hayes, '11,
box TTti, before March 1, at which time
the following committee will act as
judges of the plans submitted: Mrs. .1.
C. Branner, Miss Alice Kimball, Mrs.
C. B. Wing, Professor C. D. Marx,
Professor A. 1?. Clark. Anyone may
compete for these prizes, whether in
college or not.
It. has been suggested that the build
ing be located on the west side of the

Quadrangle, opposite the arch, but
this will be decided later by the Board
of Trustees when one-half of the total
amount necessary to start construction
has been raised. $5,745 of this has
been pledged and $4,19G is now on de
posit in the bank.
Miss Helen Campbell, *1.1, called the
meeting lo order and asked .Miss Flor
ence Williams to address the women.
The latter briefly sketched the aim and
purpose of the Clubhouse which would
l.e, "a meeting-place where all girls
could get better acquainted." She
then spoke of what had been done by
various societies and organizations to
raise money and told how much had
been raised from pledges. It is hoped
that the remaining amount can be
gotten from business men of San Fran
cisco, from philanthropic women, and
from additional pledges from the girls
at Stanford. "The 1914 girls will
profit most because they will be here
to see the plan materialize, but it is
certain that all those who are here in
the future will get more out of it than
we put into it," said Miss Williams.
This was the first of a series of mass
meetings which the women will hold
this semester and at each meeting
some definite project will be discussed.
