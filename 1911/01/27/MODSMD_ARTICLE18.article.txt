# VARSITY WILL AGAIN TRY TO OPEN BALL SEASON
## WITH NO RAIN, OLYMPIC CLUB WILL PLAY. Coach Ganong Has Lined Up Eighteen Cardinals to Make Two Complete Teams. 
### 
The Stanford Varsity will again try
to open its season with the Olympic
Clnb tomorrow afternoon at 3 o'clock
on the auxiliary diamond. The San
Franciscans were listed to invade the
campus last Saturday for the opening
game, but rain caused the cancellation
of that contest and also Wednesday's
match. There has been no improve
ment in the weather and it is hardly
likely that the season will be opened
any wider tomorrow than on the two
previous days.
Should the teams meet, however,
Coach Ganong has red-lettered the
names of eighteen men to make two
complete nines to represent the Var
sity. The remainder of the squad of
over sixty will also be in harness to
fill holes in the line-ups.
The eighteen include all the tried
and true veterans of last April, and
several bench men, Gilfillan, Ganong,
Ball, Tallant, Mitchell, Childs, Cass,
Beeger, and Jordan. Other strong
players, who were not on the Varsity
squad last spring for different reasons
are, Enderle, Jones, Achi, Henshaw,
Hughes, Terry, Burns, Donovan, and
Collins.
D. D. Sales, '06 and J. D. Rutledge,
ex'll, will form the battery for the
Olympic Club. Sales captained the
Cardinal in 1906, and toeing the rub
ber he forced California to a tied
series, a third game not being played
that year. He was also graduate man
ager while in college and a leading
actor and Carnot debater. Rutledge
won his baseball letter in his Fresh
man year, 1906. They will make a
duet tha the Cardinals will find it
hard to discord. These two veterans
are the only Stanford representatives
on the Winged "O" team.
There will be no admission charge.
Tho line-ups are:
Varsity—Enderle, Jones, Gilfillan,
pitchers; Achi, Ganong, catchers; Ball,
