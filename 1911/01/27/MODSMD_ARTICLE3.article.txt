# MILLER, HILTON AND TINCHER WINNERS OF CARNOT TRY-OUTS
## Experienced Speakers Will Represent Stanford in Coming Forensic Battle with the University of California. 
### 
R. Justin Miller, '11, Frank Howard
Hilton, '11, and Eugene Earl Tincher,
'11', will represent Stanford in the
seventeenth Carnot Debate. This fact
was decided late this afternoon after
a tryout in which an unusually high
older of forensic ability was disclosed;
a tryout which demonstrated that, if
the proposed plan of Phi Alpha Tau
for extension work is carried out, we
have in our midst speakers who can
present Stanford interests to the out
side world as well as professional lec
turers.
None of the above three names are
unfamiliar in debating circles. Miller's
part in undergraduate activities has
been a prominent one. He is enrolled
in Encina Club, University Debating
League, Intersociety Debating League,
Fhi Alpha Tail and the staff of the
Sequoia. He is a past president of
Nestoria and is at. present chief ex
ecutive of the English Club. His de
bating experience especially tits him
for the Carnot position, since he was
a member of the 1910 Carnot team and
winner of the Bonnheim and Peace
Prize contests last year. Hilton has
also been a consistent performer in
annexing debating honors. He was a
member of both his Freshman and
Sophomore Debating Teams, winner
ot the Bonnheim Prize last semester,
president of his class in his Sophomore
year, and a member of the 1911 Quad
board. His achievements on the plat
form have won for him the presidency
of Nestoria and membership in Phi
Alpha Tau, the honorary debating fra
ternity. While Tincher, the other win
ner, ranks a year behind the other two
members of the team in the University
and consequently has gained fewer
forensic honors, he is a particularly
clear and finished speaker, and the
fact that he has pushed the winner
closely in various contests makes him
a, logical companion for Hilton and
Miller. The three successful candi
dates wear the pins of Nestoria Liter
ary Society and Delta Chi fraternity.
M. B. Henshaw, '12, was chosen al
ternate this afternoon. Henshaw is
well known as an effective speaker,
having appeared in a number of public
contests as well as debates in Nestoria,
of which he is a member, as he is of
Theta Delta Chi fraternity.
The question for the tryout was
announced in the Chapel at 1 o clock
to be, "Resolved. That Premier Briand
was justified in calling out as reserves,
the striking railroad employees." Al
lowing two hours for the contestants
to arrange the material which they
had previously obtained on the general
subject, "The French Government and
Labor.' Hilton, the first speaker, was

introduced by the chairman, Professor
E. D. Adams, at 3 o'clock. Sides had
been chosen by lot, and Hilton sup
porting the affirmative, argued that
the move of Briand was justified as
against government employees strik
ing against, the government, which
had been declared illegal by the
courts. Miller, on the negative, then

maintained that, the affrmative was
logically bound to show that the gov
ernment has the right to step in and
coerce private employees. Henshaw
next justified Briand on the ground
that he had tried all the more moder
ate measures and that a strike against
the government is more serious than
one against private interests. Grant
Holcomb, '11, in a most logical argu
ment affirmed that though the Pre
mier might be economically justified,
he was not morally and legally so.
Tincher then showed that the calling
out of reserves is always right when
public safety is in jeapordy as it then
was. His speech was especially
fluent and clearcut. The judges were
Professors I. B. Cross, A. B. Show, and
E. 15. Krehbiel.
The California speakers who will
meet these three men in Stanford As
sembly Hall on the evening of Febru
ary 4, have already been selected.
They are F. M. Shipper, '12. .T.G. Sweet,
'12, and T. B. Kittredge, '12. Shipper
has taken part in several important
debates. He was a member of last
year's Carnot team and also of the Cal
ifornia trio in the 1910 Intercollegiate
debate. Sweet was selected alternate
on the Carnot team of last year and
has participated in several class con
tests, while Kittredge is also well ac
customed to the platform. Milton
Marks. '14, is alternate. Nine men
entered the tryout contests at Berke
ley, among them being A. W. Drury,
'14, brother of last year's Carnot medal
winne,*.

fluent and clearcut. The judges were
Professors I. B. Cross, A. B. Show, and
E. 15. Krehbiel.
The California speakers who will
meet these three men in Stanford As
sembly Hall on the evening of Febru
ary 4, have already been selected.
They are F. M. Shipper, '12. .T.G. Sweet,
'12, and T. B. Kittredge, '12. Shipper
has taken part in several important
debates. He was a member of last
year's Carnot team and also of the Cal
ifornia trio in the 1910 Intercollegiate
debate. Sweet was selected alternate
on the Carnot team of last year and
has participated in several class con
tests, while Kittredge is also well ac
customed to the platform. Milton
Marks. '14, is alternate. Nine men
entered the tryout contests at Berke
ley, among them being A. W. Drury,
'14, brother of last year's Carnot medal
winne,*.


R. J. MILLER, '11.
R. Justin Miller, '11, Frank Howard
Hilton, '11, and Eugene Earl Tincher,
'11', will represent Stanford in the
seventeenth Carnot Debate. This fact
was decided late this afternoon after
a tryout in which an unusually high
older of forensic ability was disclosed;
a tryout which demonstrated that, if
the proposed plan of Phi Alpha Tau
for extension work is carried out, we
have in our midst speakers who can
present Stanford interests to the out
side world as well as professional lec
turers.
None of the above three names are
unfamiliar in debating circles. Miller's
part in undergraduate activities has
been a prominent one. He is enrolled
in Encina Club, University Debating
League, Intersociety Debating League,
Fhi Alpha Tail and the staff of the
Sequoia. He is a past president of
Nestoria and is at. present chief ex
ecutive of the English Club. His de
bating experience especially tits him
for the Carnot position, since he was
a member of the 1910 Carnot team and
winner of the Bonnheim and Peace
Prize contests last year. Hilton has
also been a consistent performer in
annexing debating honors. He was a
member of both his Freshman and
Sophomore Debating Teams, winner
ot the Bonnheim Prize last semester,
president of his class in his Sophomore
year, and a member of the 1911 Quad
board. His achievements on the plat
form have won for him the presidency
of Nestoria and membership in Phi
Alpha Tau, the honorary debating fra
ternity. While Tincher, the other win
ner, ranks a year behind the other two
members of the team in the University
and consequently has gained fewer
forensic honors, he is a particularly
clear and finished speaker, and the
fact that he has pushed the winner
closely in various contests makes him
a, logical companion for Hilton and
Miller. The three successful candi
dates wear the pins of Nestoria Liter
ary Society and Delta Chi fraternity.
M. B. Henshaw, '12, was chosen al
ternate this afternoon. Henshaw is
well known as an effective speaker,
having appeared in a number of public
contests as well as debates in Nestoria,
of which he is a member, as he is of
Theta Delta Chi fraternity.
The question for the tryout was
announced in the Chapel at 1 o clock
to be, "Resolved. That Premier Briand
was justified in calling out as reserves,
the striking railroad employees." Al
lowing two hours for the contestants
to arrange the material which they
had previously obtained on the general
subject, "The French Government and
Labor.' Hilton, the first speaker, was

introduced by the chairman, Professor
E. D. Adams, at 3 o'clock. Sides had
been chosen by lot, and Hilton sup
porting the affirmative, argued that
the move of Briand was justified as
against government employees strik
ing against, the government, which
had been declared illegal by the
courts. Miller, on the negative, then

maintained that, the affrmative was
logically bound to show that the gov
ernment has the right to step in and
coerce private employees. Henshaw
next justified Briand on the ground
that he had tried all the more moder
ate measures and that a strike against
the government is more serious than
one against private interests. Grant
Holcomb, '11, in a most logical argu
ment affirmed that though the Pre
mier might be economically justified,
he was not morally and legally so.
Tincher then showed that the calling
out of reserves is always right when
public safety is in jeapordy as it then
was. His speech was especially
fluent and clearcut. The judges were
Professors I. B. Cross, A. B. Show, and
E. 15. Krehbiel.
