### 
"Purity and the Fight for the Clean
Life," will be the subject of Mercer
and Carter's combination address to
morrow evening in the Assembly Hall.
Mercer's talk on this subject is well
known throughout the colleges and
universities ol the east. A quartette,
composed of Little, Rowland, Jones
and JefTers will be the musical feature
of the program. Carl L. Schaupp, '12,
crew captain, will preside.
On Sunday morning at 10 o'clock,
the speakers will talk to the athletes
in Encina Clubroom, and in the even
ing at the Assembly Hall, the men will
give their famous tandem speeches:
"Mercer's Life Story," which has been
heard by more college men than any
other address, and Carter's "How to
Win."
The lower floor of the Asembly
Hall was nearly filled with men who
had come to hear Mercer's talk on,
"College Grads I have met in the
Slums and Prisons of New York."
His talk was very interesting and he
held the attention of his audience
from beginning to end.
He pointed out the route by which
college men start downward. "Mere
thoughtlessness," said Mercer, "is the
cause of the first drink. I did not
take my first drink because I liked it,
or especially wanted it. The first drink
1 took, made me sick. It was because
1 had a piece of spaghetti where my
backbone ought to have been." He
also showed the evils of betting, and
how betting in a social way, started
the professional gambler. He gave a
number of instances of successful col
lege men going wrong and showed
the proof for his statements.
Mercer is earnest in his efforts to
help the college men. He saw where
he made his mistake, and is doing his
best to keep others from making the
same error.
The Mandolin Club's program was
very entertaining.
