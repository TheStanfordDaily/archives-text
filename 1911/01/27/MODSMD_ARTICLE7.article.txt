Judging from the temper of a cer
tain historic Student Body meeting
held during the spring semester of

tercollegiate Agreement Committee to
be held tomorrow. If we barken back
we may remember something about
"sticking our pride in our pockets and
eating crow," and also a thoroly
aroused assemblage determined 011
issuing an ultimatum demanding a
scholarship equality provision in the
Intercollegiate eligibility rules.
Altho the Student Body was justly
angered at the time, the Daily Palo
Alto is glad to see it taking a saner
view of the matter now. We have in
the past arid still do advocate the need
of scholarship equality, but the very
fact that 110 ultimatum has been made
proves its inetticacy as a means of
securing such equality.
However, the Daily does not believe
the matter should be dropped. We be
lieve there is another way of going at
it. Sports cannot exist without an
even break between the contestants.
Because of the entire absence of a pro
bation rule at California, because of
the constantly increasing size of that
institution, and because of the liberal
attitude of its faculty as compared
with ours, Stanford is yearly at a
greater disadvantage. This fact should
be impressed upon the California
committee and a request, made that
the State University meet us half way.
Stanford wishes to maintain Inter
collegiate relations and we believe
California does too. It is not a ques
tion of challenges or ultimatums or
bluffs. It is only a matter of good
sportsmanship. If California and
Stanford are to maintain the friendly
rivalry of the past twenty years they
must meet on a more equal basis. A
change in scholarship is better than
no athletics.
