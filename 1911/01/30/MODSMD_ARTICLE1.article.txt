## Recommendation in President's Letter Is Endorsed by Faculty Board at Regular Meeting. Communication Also Advises Abolition of All Paid Coaches for Athletic Activities. 
### 
What is regarded by many as the
death knell of Freshman athletics at
Stanford, and by some as the death
knell of all athletics was made public
Saturday by President Jordan and the
Academic Council. The matter bear
ing on the question consists of a letter
from Dr. Jordan to the Chairman of
the Committee on Athletics, Dr. An
gell, and a resolution passed by the
Academic Council after the introduc
tion ot the President's letter into that
body on January 13. Dr. Jordan's
letter is as follows:
January 4, I'.Ml,
D». Frank Angell,
Chairman Committee 011 Athletics,
Stanford University, Calif.
Deiu' Sir:
With a view to carrying out certain
reforms in athletics, on the desirabil
ity of which your committee and I arc
aim ed, permit me to suggest that your
committee, which is an administrative
one, as soon as may be should make
tile following adjustments:
I; To provide that no student shall
take part in intercollegiate game> in
his first year in the University. 1
recommend that this arrangement he
perfected just as soon as our arrange
ments with the University of Califor
nia will permit, and in any event not
latei than July 1, UH2,
i To provide that no paid conches
lie employed by the student body after
the expiration of the terms of those
now so employed, and in any event
none later than January 1, 15)12...
.To provide for such modification
as may be desirable as to the rules
concerning the period of eligibility to
participate in intercollegiate games...
4..T0 be prepared at the next meet
ing of the Academic Council to dis
cuss the plans and purposes of the
Athletic Committee, especially in re
gard to the matters above named
Very truly yours,
(Signed) DAVID STARK JORDAN.
On January 13 at the meeting of the
Acadamic Council, Dr. Jordan as the
chairman of that body, and the Presi
dent of the institution introduced his
own letter to Dr. Angell, and sub
mitted it as a recommendation to the
judgment of the Council. The Council
approved of the President's recom
mendations in so far as they bore on
the competition of Freshmen in Inter
collegiate contests, and with this ob
ject in view passed the following reso
lution :
Resolved, That the Academic Coun
cil approves and adopts the instruc
tions of the President to the Chairman
of the Athletic Committee as the fixed
policy of the University?
That, if possible, with due courtesy
to the University of California and in

view of commitments already made,
participation of first year students in
intercollegiate athletics cease at the
end of the present academic year;
That the Chairman of the Committee
on Athletics be requested to report to
(he Academic Council at its regular
May meeting the results of his efforts
in carry ing out this policy.
It will be noticed that the Council
took action on but one clause of (he
President's letter, namely that relat
ing to the competition of Freshmen.
The very important clause relating
to the abolition of paid coaches
was not considered by the Council and
awaits the action of the Committee on
Athletics for definite approval or dis
approval. It is a well known fact,
however, that the authorities of the
University are in favor of abolishing
the paid coaching system even though
such coaches are graduates of the
University, it was definitely stated to
a member of the staff of the Daily
Palo Alto that definite action for the
permanent abolition of paid coaches
would be passed in the near future by
whatever body is empowered to do so.
The action of the Academic Council
in regard to the competition of Fresh
man is the expression of the general
opinion of the entire Faculty. On
other occasions the Student Body has
objected to the action of some particu
lar committee and have laid the blame
for the action at the door of the en
tire Faculty, when only the committee
in question had anything to do with
the action. In this case, however, the
entire Faculty is represented in the
resolution of (he Academic Council.
Dr. Jordan's letter was only sent to
Dr. Angell after the continued in
sistence of a majority of the Faculty
asking for the passage of a resolution
similar to that passed by the Council
and quoted above. For some years
the demand for some such action has
been growing more and more among
the members of the Faculty. Dr. Jor
dan has been asked again and again
to take definite action on the matter.
Some slight action was taken in the
spring of 1910 when a letter was in
troduced into the Executive Com
mi(tee of the Student Body recom
mending that that body take some ac
tion on the matter. Nothing was done,
however, by the Executive Committee
further than a conference with the
President, and the reaching of a more
definite understanding of the cause of
the recommendation.
The principal arguments in favor of
the resolution as passed by the Aca
demic Council are that (he Freshman
games as such causes (oo much dis
traction for its relative importance,
that the measure is a protection for
students against sacrificing (hem

selves to college spirit; and that the
emphasis should be placed on studies
rather than on athletics.
Many of those who support the
game and the competition ol Fresh
men as something desirable admit the
argument of the distraction, but,ad
vance the claims in favor of the Fresh
men game—that it gets the Freshmen
acquainted with the Stanford way of
doing things, that it gets the Fresh
men acquainted with each other, that
it gets the Freshmen out for athletics.
In regard to the claim that the schol
arship standard ol Freshmen engaged
in athletics is lower than that of their
classmates not so engaged, it is only
necessary to examine the statistics
quoted in the editorial column of this
issue. As may be seen by these fig
ures the scholarship of Freshmen
competing in athletics is, on the
whole, higher than those not so en
gaged.
The argument advanced by the Fac
ulty that the distraction of the Fresh
man game is sufficient to abolish it as
an Intercollegiate contest, is based on
the facta that at the time ol the Fresh
man game the campus is in a state of
unrest almost equal to that preceeding
the Varsity contest. This seriously
interferes with the pursuit of studies
for several days preceeding the con
test. It is claimed that the distraction
at the time of the Freshman game
now, is as great as the distraction at
the time of the Varsity contest twelve
years ago.
Against this fact, however, stands
the fact that the Freshmen who com
pete 01* are out for the team from the
beginning of their college days under
the direction of a good coach become
imbued with the true Stanford spirit,
as typified on the athletic field. The
Freshmen receive an invaluable train
ing which otherwise would not be
theirs. They also claim that the Fac
ulty exaggerates the importance of the
distraction attending Freshman games.
According to those in charge of ath
letics at Stanford, the ideal plan
would be one in which the distraction
of the Freshman contest might be re
moved but the game as a game re
tained. One suggestion in this line is
that a series of Intercollegiate class
games be played between teams repre
senting the four classes from each in
stitution.
The argument that, the Freshman
game gets the new men out and ac
quainted with one another, is in the
mind of many a strong point in favor
of its retention.
The ideal which the Faculty holds
up for athletics at Stanford is to get
all the men of the University engaged
in some line of athletic work. As a
statement to support the student view

4< As an individual member of the 4»

4' gave the following reasons for 4»
4' the action of the Faculty: 4*

tion is ower than their own 4»

point, a man well acquainted with
local conditions stated to a member
of the Daily staff, that the Freshmen
who get out learn enough of the game
to enjoy the sport. He further stated
that in his opinion at least 50 per cent
of the men playing in the Interclass
games would not be engaged in the
sport were it not for the fact that they
had gotten out for Freshman football.
He also stated that in the games of
the interfraternity series a large per
centage of the players were Freshmen.
All this is a move in favor of the
Faculty attitude of making the sport
general among the students. Further
more under the old system of coach
ing where there was but one coach
and his assistant, the squad was cut
down as rapidly as possible in order
to allow these two to devote their time
to the turning out of a first class team.
Under the new system, as employed by
Presley, a large proportion of the
squad is kept out for the entire sea
son, or at least for a period of suffi
cient length so that they learn the
rudiments of the game and can play in
interclass and inter-fraternity games
when called on. As pointed out in the
editorial columns of this paper these
points are all factors leading to the
Faculty policy of general participation
in athletics.
In regard to the clause in the letter
of the President relating to the aboli
tion of paid coaches at Stanford, there
seems to be a greater unanamity of
opinion both among the Faculty and
