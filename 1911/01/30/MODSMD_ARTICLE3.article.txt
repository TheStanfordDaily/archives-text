The action of the Academic Council
in recommending the abolition of
Freshman Intercollegiate athletics
seems inconsistent with
Freshman the faculty policy favor-
Athletics ing a general participa
tion in athletics, and un
reasoable in view of the present ex
itsing conditions. We know no more
effective measure to discourage gen
eral participation than to keep the
men primarily benefited by it—the
Freshmen—out of the game. The
faculty by their latest action are
working directly against the ideal for
which they have been striving.
Scholarship statistics show that the
Freshmen athletes are not in need of
an abolition of exercise as a stimulus
for study. The fact that the scholar
ship average of the last Freshman
rugby fifteen was higher than the
general average of the Student Body
as a whole, shows that participation
rather than non-participation in ath
letics is the better stimulus. Thirteen
per cent of the Student Body was de
ficient in scholarship last year, while
only eight per cent of the Freshmen
were deficient. None of the six Fresh
men who have made the Varsity the
past two years are deficient in a single
subject. It would seem that inter
collegiate participation insofar as it
has made these men good scholars
has "brought them into proper rela
tion with University affairs." Even
admitting that scholarship standing
is higher during nonparticipation, it
would seem fairer to consider the
comparative average with all students
of the University.
Altho it is stated that this action is
not directed toward the abolition of all
Intercollegiate athletics, it is never
theless a very effective step in that di
rection. Freshman Intercollegiate
athletics are the necessary incentive
to keep alive Intercollegiate affairs.
Abolish them and it will be difficult to
recruit the Varsity teams. It is diffi
cult to get a man out for athletics who
does not enter in his Freshman year.
Once entered he becomes a devotee
during his whole college career. The
impossibility of making a Varsity team
is even more of a damper on general
participation than the abolition of the

Freshman games. There have been
twice as many Freshmen out the past
two years than in preceding years and
the scholarship average of the Uni
versity is 50 per cent higher.
The faculty argument of greatest
weight is that regarding the distrac
tion from studies. We believe this dis
traction is not as serious as is
thought. The few members of the
team are the most serious sufferers
from this and their scholarship stand
ing proves their early convalesence.
There has to be a certain amount of
distraction. The trite adage "all
work and no play makes Jack a dull
boy" is very true. If we have not a
Freshman game something else will
take its place. Freshmen are not
graduate students. Most of them are
boys and Stanford makes them men.
A Freshman year under the athletic
guidance of a man of Presley's calibre
is about the best "distraction" a man
can have. To get this "distraction" he
has to be a good student.
The Freshman rule was adopted in
the east to rule out "ringers" and
tramp athletes. We are not bothered
with these pests here and therefore
need no rule.
A reconsideration of the whole mat
ter would be welcomed by the Stu
dent Body.
