## ELEVEN MEN WILL REPRESENT STANFORD IN ANNUAL EVENT. Strong Relay Team Will be Sent Up to Compete in Feature Event. 
### 
Defeated in their attempts to hold a
track meet on the campus, eleven
members of the Varsity squad will
journey to San Francisco next Friday
night to compete in the annual indoor
meet of the Olympic Club. Here, un
molested by the inclement weather,
over fifty entries, representing Stan
ford, California and the various ath
letic clubs around the bay, will try
conclusions in what promises to be
the best of these events ever held on
the coast.
Stanford will be represented by the
following:
Relay—Coleman,*l2, Taylor,'ll, Mili
sap, '12, Bellah, '10, Dawson, '14, and
Campbell, 13.
7") yard dashJDawson, 14, Geissler,
'14.
300 yard dash —Campbell, '13.
75 yard dash —Dawson, '14, Geissler,
son, '13.
Shot put—Dole, '11, Olmestead, '14.
The relay race will be the feature
event of the evening, and the team
sent up to represent the Cardinal is
looked upon as a likely contender for
first honors.
Three Freshmen, Dawson, Geissler
and Olmstead will make their first ap
pearance in college track athletics .it
this meet. Dawson and Geissler were
star men in the dashes while at pre
paratory school, while Olmstead has
made a good showing in the weight
events.
E. P. Campbell, '13. a, transfer from
Nevada, who made the highest score
ever tallied at Stanford in the outdoor
all-around athletic test, will enter the
300 yard dash.
"Dad" has refused to let anyone
enter in the jumps, believing it unwise
to hold these events indoors.
Among other entries are Ralph
Rose, the Healdsburg giant, who is a
record breaker in the weight events,
Ollie Snedigar, the veteran broad
jumper, and Beeson of California, who
is loked upon by many to shatter the
Intercollegiate hurdle record this sea
son.
