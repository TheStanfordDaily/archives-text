J. W. Howell and B. J. O'Donnell
are now in the midst of their work of
publishing the 1912 Quad. Their task

is one of the hardest which
can be undertaken by any
undergraduate. It will be
doubly hard however, if

they do not receive the cooperation
and the support of the Junior Class
and the Student Body as a whole. The
Juniors can best support their Annual
by paying their assessments and hav
ing their pictures taken immediately,
while the Student Body can aid by hav
ing all organization pictures taken be
fore the middle of February. If every
one postpones these duties until the
last minute the Quad will be the suf
ferer.
The standard of an annual depends
largely upon the time given the printer
and the engraver for their work and ii"
the students delay, the publication will
have to be a rush job. The Quad, al
though edited by the Juniors belongs
to us all, and we wish to see each book
excell its predecessors.
The fact, that the 1912 Board intends
to include this spring's athletics in
their record of events makes it doubly
necessary that all copy and pictures be
in the hands of the editors at the ear
liest possible date. This is a worthy
innovation and we should cooperate so
that it may be a permanent feature in
all future annuals.
