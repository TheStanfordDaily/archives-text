# MANY SEATS SOLD FOR ENGLISH CLUB PLAYS
## BIG HOUSES ASSUMED FOR BOTH PERFORMANCES. Daily Rehearsals are Being Held. Choir Boys to be in Costume. 
### 
In spite ot the prediction of some
not connected with the English Club,
the tale of seats for the Miracle Plays
has progressed even more favorably j
than their most sanguine supporters
had hoped for. At an early hour this
afternoon almost the entire lower floor

of the seat plots held by the Stanford
Bookstore for both the afternoon and
evening performances had been taken
up. There are but a, few seats left
that could lie clashed as good, and if
tht !-;ale of the past days is any indi
cation they will be gone in the very
near future.
Daily rehearsals are in progress in
the Assebmly Hall. The lines for all
three ot the plays are letter perfect
and the remaining rehearsals will be
employed only in smoothing down the
more difficult places. According to
the present plans there will be two
dress rehearsals. One ot these will be
for the purpose of getting the actors
acquainted with the flowing costumes
they will wear on the night of the per
formance. The other will be a com
plete rehearsal with all scenery and
properties.
It is announced that the boys' choir
which is to sing at both performances,
will be costumed strictly in keeping
with the play.
Unless something nnforseen occurs,
the Miracle Plays will be one of thp
most successful dramatic endeavors
attempted at Stanford within the past
few years.
