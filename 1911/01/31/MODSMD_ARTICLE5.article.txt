# AGREEMENT COMMITTEE HAS AMICABLE SESSION
## NO ACTION TAKEN REGARDING SCHOLARSHIP EQUALITY. Freshman and Varsity Regattas are Added to the List of Intercollegiate Contests. 
### 
No radical differences of opinion de
veloped at the annual meeting of the
Intercollegiate agreement committee,
held in San Francisco last Saturday
night. Ezra Decoto, a former Univer
sity of California manager, presided at
the conference, and with Manager
Farmer and W. Greenlaw represented
the interests of the State University.
Stanford was represented by D. W.
Burbank, G. .J. Presey and R. W. Bar
rett.
In view of the renewed interest in
boating at both institutions an inter
collegiate regatta was added to the
lists of contests. To the Article of the
Agreement, which provides for such
contests, was added a fifth section pro
viding for the annual Freshman and
Varsity regatta. The setting of the
time and place of the meet was left in
the hands of the graduate managers
with the sole provision that the matter
must be settled at least three weeks
prior to the date set. This section is
to remain in force until the meeting of
the committee in 1912.
Athough the California representa
tives did not agree to a provision reg
ulating the employment of a coach for
boating, it was tacitly understood that
neither University should employ a
professional coach during the coming
year.
In order to eliminate any possible
cause of friction arising from the eligi
bility rules, an interpretaton of sec
tion 8, Article 2 was agreed upon. This
section reads as follows: "No student
shall be eligible to play on any Fresh
man Intercollegiate team who has
been previously eligible to such a team
in any university of standing." In this
section the phrase "previously eli
gible" will in the future lie construed
so as to include any Freshman regis
tered on the day that the list of eligi
bles is sent in.
The revision of the Tennis agree
ment was also discussed but action
was deferred until a later meeting.
