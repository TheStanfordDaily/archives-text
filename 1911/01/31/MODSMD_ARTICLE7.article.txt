# LAW SCHOOL SUMMER SESSION TO BE HELD
## CURRICULUM WILL BE MOST COMPREHENSIVE ON COAST. Four Professors to Prepare Seven Courses.â€” Many Outsiders Expected to Attend. 
### 
The faculty of the Law School has
definitely decided to hold a summer
session ot the Law School this year.

The success of
the plan is as
sured, accord
ing to the state
ments of the
faculty men, for
forty students
have already
registered for
the s u m 111 e r
term and a
number of oth

ers liave signified their intention to
attend if possible. In addition to these
it is expected that a large number of
persons outside of the Uuiversity, such
as lawyers, teachers, insurance agents,
business men, and persons interested
in irrigation or mining law, will avail
themselves of the opportunity to gain
some practical legal knowledge.
The curriculum, which is probably
the most comprehensive ever offered
in a summer session on the Coast and
which will engage the services of four
of the regular professors of the Law
School, is as follows:
Contracts, three units, and persons,
two units, Professor Woodward;
Quasi-contracts, two units, Professor
Cathcart; Agency, three units, and In
surance, two units, Professor Huston;
Water Rights, three units, and Mining
Law, two units. Professor Bingham.
The courses are open to all upon
payment of tuition, but the giving of
University credit will be restricted as
follows: Pre-Legal students having
4.") units of credit may count the course
in Contracts toward the A. B. degree;
Pre-Legal students, having 75 units
of credit, may count toward the A. B.
degree the course in Agency and in
addition thereto four units to be elect
ed from the courses in Persons, Quasi
contracts and Insurance. Graduate
students in law may count any course
not already taken by them toward the
J. D. degree.
The session will open May 31 and
will continue for eight weeks. It will
probably be divided into two terms,
however, so that a student may regis
ter for only four weeks work if un
able to stay longer. The tuition will
be four dollars iter unit which, in the
average case, means about $24 for the
session of eight weeks.
