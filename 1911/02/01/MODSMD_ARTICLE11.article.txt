The announcement of the large
number of Assemblies which will be
held this semester, comes as good
news to the Student
3lusic at Body. Never have a
Assemblies larger number of well
known and representa
tive speakers been engaged to ad
dress Stanford students and the ef
forts of the Faculty to bring them
here is appreciated by everyone. In
looking over this imposing array of
talent we can only say that the stu
dents themselves will be the losers for
not attending the meetings.
Although we are practically as
sured good Assemblies, we would sug
gest as a further means of guarantee
ing their excellence, that the various
musical clubs be given a place on the
program. Stanford sees too little of
these organizations from which she
deserves more.
Especially does this apply to the
Glee Club, which aside from its an
nual appearance in the Quad, relig
iously keeps itself from public view.
We would remind this organization
that its main purpose in life is to
sing and not have its picture taken to
fill up good space in the year book,
which might be occupied by more
worthy organizations even if they
don't wear hard boiled shirts.
