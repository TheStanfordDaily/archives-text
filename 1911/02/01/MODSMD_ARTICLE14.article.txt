## 
### 
Instructor P. A. Martin of the llis
tory department was the hero of a
thrilling adventure but a few nights
ago. To be held up and actually
robbed bv masked men on the way to
the campus was the awful ordeal to
which he was subjected.
While the Instructor was returning
from Palo Alto with a young lady,
whose name could not be learned, two
masked men stepped out from be
hind one of the palms bordering the
approach to the University and de
manded that he hold up both his
hands and come though with the cash.
Mr. Martin, although a brave man
could not resist the appealing tone
of voice with which the highwaymen
spoke. He gave them $1.65. Fortu
nately he was coming back.
Not content with this princely sum
the robbers attempted to take the
rings from the fingers of the young
lady. It was then that the wrath of
Instructor Martin rose. In his best
classroom style he told the cruel ban
dits that they should not harm the
young lady. Whether they retreated
as a result of the lecture room tone,
or because they thought better of their
efforts to rob the young lady of her
jewelry is unknown. At any rate,
suddenly Mr. Martin and his friend
were alone in the night. Bravely, but
politely the Instructor offered his arm
and they went on their way to the
University.
