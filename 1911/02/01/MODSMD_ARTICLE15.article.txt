# Euphronia Debates Council's Action.
## 
### 
"Freshman Athletics" was the topic
of an impromptu debate before Eu
phronia last night. F. E. Hill, '11,
talked in favor of the late ruling of the
Academic Council, while R. F. Stever,
'12, argued against it. Both sides were
well taken, but the consensus of opin
ion of the members of the society was
against the council's decision.
The house was equally divided in its
decision on the debate, "Resolved,
that San Francisco should adopt the
commission form of government." C.
L. Coffin, '12, and P. D. Nowell, '13,
upheld the affirmative, .while C. T.
Dunham, '13, and M. M. Fogel, '12. de
fended the negative.
