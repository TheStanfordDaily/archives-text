### 
it is now definitely known that large
numbers of students from high schools
near the University will attend the
afternoon performance of the Miracle
Plays. Miss M. Horton, '11, spoke
last Friday at the Redwood High
school. Her talk was received with
great enthusiasm and fifty of the
ninety pupils of the school signified
their intention of seeing the plays.
The visitors from Redwood will not be
alone among the high school pilgrims.
San Jose will send a large delegation
and have chartered special cars to the
campus. The San Jose Normal will
also send up practically its entire stu
dent body.
Private parties as well as those from
schools will be in attendance. One of
these is from San Francisco and an
other from San Jose. The most re
markable demonstration of the gen
eral interest that is being taken in
the plays is the announcement that a
delegation of interested spectators
will make the round trip from Los
Angeles for the purpose of seeing the
performances.
No such interest as this has ever
been shown in any other play present
ed on the campus.
Seats for the two perfomances are
almost all gone. A few good ones are
still available, however, at the Stan
ford Bookstore, on the campus, and in
Palo Alto.
