# SPIRIT OF TRACK MEN PLEASES "DAD" MOULTON
## CONSISTENT WORK GRAIFIES VETERAN COACH. Trainer Would Like to See First Year Men Train More Regularly. 
### 
Never before has the opening of the
spring track season found such au
enthusiastic, conscientious group of
workers on the cinder path as are out
this year, according to the statement
made by "Dad" Moulton yesterday.
Neither rain nor mud lias dampened
the ardor of the athletes since the
trainer issued a call for his charges
to appear regularly. From three
o'clock until six each afternoon, prac
tically every man dons his spikes and
goes through the regular routine of
the preliminary training.
In speaking of the spirit shown by
the athletes, "Dad" says,"1 never had
as good a bunch of workers out be
fore. 1 begin to think these fellows
like the wet weather. The only thing
I can ask is that the Freshmen come
out a little more regularly."
Last night for the first time this
year, "Dad" took his favorite position
with the gun at the hundred mark and
put the sprinters through a snappy
starting practice.
Active training has commenced in
all events except, the hurdles, high
jump and pole vault. It has been
deemed advisable to restrict the ath
letes in these events to light work
until next week.
