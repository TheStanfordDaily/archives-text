# SAN FRANCISCO SOCIETY TO MOTOR DOWN FOR
## Local Ticket Sale Almost Exhausted.—Two Blocks of Outside Seats Recalled to Meet the Heavy Demand. 
### 
For the first time since the Ens
lish Club presented the Knight of tli<•
Hunting Pestle, San Francisco society
will clc honor to Stanford theatricals
This perhaps is due in part to the fact
that seldom have scats been placed on
sale elsewhere than on the campus
and in Palo Alto; but, judging from

the personnel of the San Franciscans
who have already made their reserva
tions for the Miracle Plays, more than
mere convenience has attracted them.
It had been expected that the
motor parties from town would make
the Saturday matinee their choice, but
Sherman and Clay, where the San
Francisco block is on sale, names
many who are coming here on Friday
evening, and announces that three
rows of seats for that performance
have already been engaged.
Charles S. Wheeler, regent of the
State University, is chaperoning a
party in his big Thomas. The Popes
and the Newhalls are each convoying
their friends, while from the Penin
sula. the Peter Martins, the Carolans,
and the Hopkins have already booked
seats in the third row. A number of
the city clergy have arranged for ac
conimodations, and are to be acconi-

panied by many of their parishioners.
Rev. Charles N. La'hrop, of the
Church ol the Advent, is coining with
Mrs? Robert Chester Foute and her
daughter. Rev. Frederick Clampett
ol I rinity lias not only planned a large
party, but has aided the English Club
to secure the sheep which they intend

to use for the Second Shepherd's piny.
It had been originally intended to se
cure the Zeta Psi goat, but in the
absence of that animal, Dr. Clampett's
aid was invoked with the result that
today the sheep arrived in itscrate.and
is being cared for far from the covet
ous eye of the Anatomy Laboratory.
Contrary to the expectations of the
management, the demand for seats,
both for Friday evening and for the
Saturday matinee has been so heavy
that practically the whole of the avail
able supply of tickets which were
placed on sale at the Hookstore and
the Palo Alto Pharmacy have been ex
hausted, and it has become necessary
to call back a block of seats from Her
keley to satisfy the demand. These
seats, some of them among the best in
the house have been put on sale here
and in Palo Alto, and many of tlieni
have already gone.
