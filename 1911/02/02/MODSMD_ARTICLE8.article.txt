In connection with our appeal for
the Glee Club to arise from the dead,
we would toot Gabriel's bazoo at the
other musical organizations
Music also. In fact the entire stu
dent body would do well to
listen for the blast. The general in
terest in music at Stanford is far from
what it should be. The absence of
musical instruction here in a measure
accounts for this apathy, but the stu
dents themselves are largely to blame.
The very lack of a music department
should make us work the harder to
encourage the organizations that we
now have.
Among these organizations, the
Oratorio Society at the present time
is most worthy of support. Under the
direction of Organist Buehrer this club
is now practicing to present an Ora
torio on February 24, which should be
a, real treat to the campus. Two
years ago with the Stanford society
a nucleus, a chorus of almost 400
voices gave a great festival of song.
Why cannot we do something as am
bitious this year? We can if only
more will sing and more will reserve
their seats in the inside of Assembly
Hall, rather than on the eaves and
under the stage. The same support
which was given the Schubert Club's
presentation of the "Mikado" should
be extended to the Oratorio Society's
"Gallia." Song festivals come so sel
dom and are so enjoyable that all the
encouragement possible should be
given them.
We are informed that the possession
of a prima donna voice is not pre
requisite for a place in the chorus.
Tr.vouts are not held and all who are
willing to sing are welcomed. There
is an especial need for more male
voices.
