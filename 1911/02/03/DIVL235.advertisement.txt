The Ideal Winter Route
Two Daily Trains through to New Orleans, connect
ing there with Trains
To All Points East
Through electrically lighted pleepers. Personally conducted tour
ist sleepers to St. Louis, Cincinnati and Washington. Or go
to New Orleans and take one of the palatial steamers of the Southern
Pacific from there to New York. IT COSTS NO MORE. First-class
rail rate to New York covers first-class cabin accommodation and
meals; second-class rail rate covers second cabin accommodation and
meals; steerage proportionately less.
If you are going to the Atlantic Coast, send for our "One Hundred
Hours at Sea."
