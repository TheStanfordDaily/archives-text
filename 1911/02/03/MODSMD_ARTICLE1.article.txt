# CONFERENCE CONSIDERS LATE ATHLETIC RULING
## WILL ARGUE AGAINST FACULTY ACTION. Committee to Present Student Side of Question. â€”Dr. Jordan Attends Meeting. 
### 
The prohibition of Freshman Inter
collegiate contests and the other sug
gestions made recently by the Aca
demic Council as matters of para
mount importance to the Student
Body were taken up at the meeting of
the University conference last evening.
President Jordan appeared before
the Conference and made known to the
Upperclassmen the general considera
tions which induced the Faculty to
take their recent action. The argu
ments which appeared cogent to the
Academic Council, as stated by Dr.
Jordan, were printed in full in a re
cent issue of the Daily Palo Alto.
It appears that in the consideration
of the whole matter, however, the
Faculty relied upon somewhat anti
quated statistics. The figures relative
to the scholarship of Freshmen par
ticipating in Intercollegiate athletics
were compiled some four years ago
and may have more or less relevancy
to the present situation.
In view of this, the President of the
Conference was empowered to appoint
a committee to go into the matter
thoroughly and present to the Faculty
the other side of the argument. This
committee will act in conjuction with
one appointed from the Executive
Committee by Student Body President
Ditz.
In addition, Dr. Jordan made an In
teresting statement of the financial
conditions of the institution, explain
ing in part the delay in making neces
sary improvements around the Uni
versity.
The repetition of the
made the "Stunt" dance famous," the
chalk marking of the Quad iftirl its
use as an adjunct of the Art depart
ment, aroused the ire of the members
of the Conference. It is a distinctly
understood rule that only in one ex
ception will such actions be permis
sible. This exception occurs when it
is impossible to have the announce
ment of the event advertised printed
in the issue of the Daily Palo Alto of
the preceding day. Even then the
notices must, be restricted to the four
corners of the outer Quadrangle.
The Conference Quad picture will be
taken at two o'clock Wednesday after
noon.
