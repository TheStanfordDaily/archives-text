# A
						Victory in Sight.

### 
Our efforts to give the Carnot De
bate a clear field tomorrow night be
ing of no avail, we would at least urge
those whose evening will not be spent
at Terpsichore's shrine to support
their University. For the seventeenth
time, Stanford will face California in
this unique and all-important forensic
contest, and if the Blue and Gold trio
is anywhere near a match the battle
should be a merry one. The Stanford
speakers compose as able a team as
could represent the Cardinal and our
hopes are high for a victory. The
name of Hilton, Tincher or Miller as
victor would be a fortunate addition
to those of Sandwick, Morris, Wagner,
Sherriffs, Herron and the Shelton
brothers, the medal winners of the
past.
