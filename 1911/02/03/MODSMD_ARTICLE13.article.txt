The request of the University Con
ference for a discontinuance of the
practice of chalking up the Quad in
advertising various and sundry or
ganization meetings should be com
plied with. The main reason for the
existence of the Daily Palo Alto's an
nouncement column is to save our
reverenced Quadrangle from assuming
too much the appearance of a bill
board, which at the best is an eye
sore to any community. Only when .1
meeting is called at too late a date to
advertise it in the Daily is it permis
sable to ply the crayon for the public's
perusal and then only in moderation.
The same sacred consideration that
makes us abstain from smoking 011 the
Quad should lead us to show an equal
respect for its appearance.
