# League Meeting Well Attended.
## 
### 
In spite of the rain, the attendance
was unusually large at the second
regular meeting of the Woman's
League yesterday afternoon, nearly
every girl in the University being
present. A candy sale for the benefit
of the Woman's Clubhouse was held
before the meeting, at which over
fifteen dollars was cleared. After the
business meeting, the Maskers gave a
very clever two act farce, entitled,
"Mrs. Oakley's Telephone."
