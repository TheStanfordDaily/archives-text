# CALIFORNIA AND STANFORD TO CLASH IN VERBAL BATTLE
## Rival Universities Will Meet in the Seventeenth Annual Carnot Debate Tomorrow Evening in Assembly Hall. 
### 
With all arrangements completed
for the seventeenth Carnot ' Debate,
scheduled to be held tomorrow even-

ing in the Assembly
Hall,the first speak
er in this debating
classic only awaits
the words of intro
duction of Presi
dent David Starr
Jordan as chair
man. Judging from
the qualifications of
. the Stanford team.

It is safe to hope that either R. J. .Mil
ler. 11, E. E. Tincher, '12, or F. H.
Hilton,'ll, will be able to persuade the
Carnot Medal to return to the Stan
ford campus, which it has ornament
ed on several previous visits. These
three men, all of whom are exper
ienced and effective speakers, have
made good use of their rather short
time of preparation for the debate,
and have been materially aided by
Professors C. G. Allen and A. L. Guer
ard of the Department of Romanic
Languages, whose assistance has been
in the line of indicating crucial points
of the French political situation, and
in translating articles from the French.
The judges for the Carnot were se
lected at a conference held recently in
San Francisco between representa
tives of Stanford and California. W.
Tucker, Jr., '12, represented Stanford
at "this meeting. Judge Lucian Shaw
of the Supreme Court, Mr. Charles A.
Murdock, Editor of the Pacific Unitar
ian, and Mr. Henry Payot, of Payot,
Upham and Company, known as an
on French history, are the
mfhi who will decide the fate of the
contestants on Saturday evening.
The Carnot debate between Stanford
and California is one of the unique

forensic events of the country. A
similar contest is held at Princeton
and at Tulane, New Orleans, but
these are not Intercollegiate in char
acter. Baron Pierre de Coubertin,
donor ot the Carnot medal, took this
means of paying a tribute to Sadi Car
not, the martyred French President.
Being a lover of France, and wishing
to spread the knowledge ot her his
tory and political institutions, M.de
Coubertin stipulated that the topic for
discussion must always relate in some
manner to France.
A general subject for debate is al
ways announced, and two hours before
the contest a particular subject con
nected with the general one is given
out. By thus giving the speakers only
two hours to arrange their material to
bear on the question for the evening,
two desirable ends are attained —in-
dependent thought and extemporan
eous delivery.
Each debater is allowed fifteen min
utes on the floor, and he may divide
his time between two speeches pro
viding that each be of at least four
minutes duration. He may chose
either side of the question which ap
peals to him, there being no division
ol material or conferences between
adherents of the same side. The
medal is awarded to the man showing
the most thorough knowledge of the
question and marshalling his argu
ment in the most logical and effective
manner.
Considering the qualifications of
Miller, Tincher and Hilton along the
above lines, loyal Stanfordites whose
idea of happiness is to see victories
for the Cardinal will be taking at least
a good gambling chance of gratifying
their wish by coming to the Assembly
Hall tomorrow evening.

manner to France.
A general subject for debate is al
ways announced, and two hours before
the contest a particular subject con
nected with the general one is given
out. By thus giving the speakers only
two hours to arrange their material to
bear on the question for the evening,
two desirable ends are attained —in-
dependent thought and extemporan
eous delivery.
Each debater is allowed fifteen min
utes on the floor, and he may divide
his time between two speeches pro
viding that each be of at least four
minutes duration. He may chose
either side of the question which ap
peals to him, there being no division
ol material or conferences between
adherents of the same side. The
medal is awarded to the man showing
the most thorough knowledge of the
question and marshalling his argu
ment in the most logical and effective
manner.
Considering the qualifications of
Miller, Tincher and Hilton along the
above lines, loyal Stanfordites whose
idea of happiness is to see victories
for the Cardinal will be taking at least
a good gambling chance of gratifying
their wish by coming to the Assembly
Hall tomorrow evening.

With all arrangements completed
for the seventeenth Carnot ' Debate,
scheduled to be held tomorrow even-

ing in the Assembly
Hall,the first speak
er in this debating
classic only awaits
the words of intro
duction of Presi
dent David Starr
Jordan as chair
man. Judging from
the qualifications of
. the Stanford team.

It is safe to hope that either R. J. .Mil
ler. 11, E. E. Tincher, '12, or F. H.
Hilton,'ll, will be able to persuade the
Carnot Medal to return to the Stan
ford campus, which it has ornament
ed on several previous visits. These
three men, all of whom are exper
ienced and effective speakers, have
made good use of their rather short
time of preparation for the debate,
and have been materially aided by
Professors C. G. Allen and A. L. Guer
ard of the Department of Romanic
Languages, whose assistance has been
in the line of indicating crucial points
of the French political situation, and
in translating articles from the French.
The judges for the Carnot were se
lected at a conference held recently in
San Francisco between representa
tives of Stanford and California. W.
Tucker, Jr., '12, represented Stanford
at "this meeting. Judge Lucian Shaw
of the Supreme Court, Mr. Charles A.
Murdock, Editor of the Pacific Unitar
ian, and Mr. Henry Payot, of Payot,
Upham and Company, known as an
on French history, are the
mfhi who will decide the fate of the
contestants on Saturday evening.
The Carnot debate between Stanford
and California is one of the unique

forensic events of the country. A
similar contest is held at Princeton
and at Tulane, New Orleans, but
these are not Intercollegiate in char
acter. Baron Pierre de Coubertin,
donor ot the Carnot medal, took this
means of paying a tribute to Sadi Car
not, the martyred French President.
Being a lover of France, and wishing
to spread the knowledge ot her his
tory and political institutions, M.de
Coubertin stipulated that the topic for
discussion must always relate in some
manner to France.
