# POSTPONED TRACK MEET TO BE HELD TOMORROW
## CAPTAIN BELLAH HOPES FOR FAVORABLE CONDITIONS. List of Officials Named to Conduct Meets of Coming Season, 
### 
Unless rain is falling tomorrow af
ternoon, the track meet scheduled for
4 o'clock will be held on the oval at
that time. Every man out is expected
to make an appearance and to compete
in the event for which he is training.
The object of this meet is primarily
to give "Dad" and Captain Bellah
some idea ot the new material which
they have in the field, and for this
reason, separate events have been ar
ranged for novices and Freshmen. A
second series of events will be held
for the veterans of last year's track
squad.
All track events except the hundred
will be shortened and the two mile is
to be left off the program. If the track
is in bad condition, the hurdles, ham
mer throw, high jump, broad jump
and pole vault will all be omitted and
the shot put will be the only field
event in the competition.
