# TRACK ATHLETES MAKE GOOD SHOWING IN MUD
## FAST TIME MADE BY NEW MEN IN QUARTER AND HALF. Unfavorable Conditions Prevent Star Performances in First Meet of the Season. 
### 
In a meet devoid of star performan
ces because of the condition of the
track, the men out on the cinder path
this season met in competition for the
first time last Saturday. The meet
was held primarily for the purpose of
getting a line on the new material in
the field. Therefore, few of the mem
bers of last year's Varsity squad
donned their spikes.
Considering the unfavorable con
ditions however, the time and dis
tances made were all of a uniformly
promising quality. Captain Bellah's
leap of 21 feet, 4 inches, in the broad
jump, followed closely by C. H. Tal
lant, '11, and C. W. Knight, '14, was
especially worthy of note.
A. W. Robertson, '12, a transfer from
Occidental, made an excellent show
ing. He covered 792 yards, the BSO
shortened, in the fast time of 1:52 4-5.
A man who is looked upon as a likely
contender in the mile this year is G.
Kevier, '11, who succeeded in negotiat
ing three laps Saturday in 3:34 4-5.
The quarter revealed a wealth oI
new material. Thirty men entered this
event, making it necessary to run
three heats. These were won in good
time by G. E. Needham. '13, B. Wal
lace, '12, and D. H. Thomas, '12, re
spectively. All three trials were well
contested and "Dad" anticipates little
trouble in developing several good
men for this event.

1:40.
In a meet devoid of star performan
ces because of the condition of the
track, the men out on the cinder path
this season met in competition for the
first time last Saturday. The meet
was held primarily for the purpose of
getting a line on the new material in
the field. Therefore, few of the mem
bers of last year's Varsity squad
donned their spikes.
Considering the unfavorable con
ditions however, the time and dis
tances made were all of a uniformly
promising quality. Captain Bellah's
leap of 21 feet, 4 inches, in the broad
jump, followed closely by C. H. Tal
lant, '11, and C. W. Knight, '14, was
especially worthy of note.
A. W. Robertson, '12, a transfer from
Occidental, made an excellent show
ing. He covered 792 yards, the BSO
shortened, in the fast time of 1:52 4-5.
A man who is looked upon as a likely
contender in the mile this year is G.
Kevier, '11, who succeeded in negotiat
ing three laps Saturday in 3:34 4-5.
The quarter revealed a wealth oI
new material. Thirty men entered this
event, making it necessary to run
three heats. These were won in good
time by G. E. Needham. '13, B. Wal
lace, '12, and D. H. Thomas, '12, re
spectively. All three trials were well
contested and "Dad" anticipates little
trouble in developing several good
men for this event.
