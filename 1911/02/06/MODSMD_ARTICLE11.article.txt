# STANFORD CAPTURES THIRD IN OLYMPIC CLUB MEET.
## Series of Mishaps Proves Fatal to Cardinal's Chances for First Honors. 
### 
Unfamiliar with the indoor track,
the representatives of Stanford fought
an uphill fight at the Olympic Club
meet Friday night, and, despite the
series of mishaps which befell them,
succeeded in capturing third place.
The points scored by the various
teams were as follows:
Olympic Club, US; University of Cal
ifornia, 22; Stanford, 19; St. Mary's,
G; Irish-American, 3; Swedish-Amer
ican, 1; Santa Clara, 1.
The points secured by Stanford
were made by E. P. Geissler, '14, five
points; H. Morrison, '13, five points;
E. P. Campbell, '13, five points; W.
Dawson, '14, one point, and the relay
team, three points. Geissler and Daw
son took first and third in the seventy
five yard dash, while Campbell and
Morrison won the three hundred yard
dash and the high jump, respectively.
The following men composed the re
lay team: S. H. Bellah, '10, C. C.
Taylor, '11, R. E. Millsap, '12, E. P.
Campbell, '13, and W. Dawson, '14.
Had it not been for a bad fall which
Captain Bellah experienced in his
lap of the relay, Stanford's chances
for capturing first place in that event
would have been bright. Bellah quick
ly recovered himself and finished a
strong second. Although badly
bruised, about his knees, he sustained
no serious injuries.
Campbell suffered a similar fate in
the three hundred yard dash. He re
gained his feet, however, and pluckilv
finished his race, winning in the re
markable time of 35 3-5 seconds.
Geissler's performance in the sev
enty-five yard dash, which he made in
eight seconds, was also noteworthy.
