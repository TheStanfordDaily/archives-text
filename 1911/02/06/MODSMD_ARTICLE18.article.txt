# OLD TRAINING HOUSE ENTIRELY RENOVATED
## $325 SPENT FOR VARSITY SQUAD'S COMFORT. Dressing Room for Football and Baseball Men is Enlarged. Paint is Used. 
### 
On Saturday afternoon, the old Train
ing House, which has been myster
iously closed for some time, was
opened to public inspection and those
entering it found that the quarters,
during the closed season, were en
tirely renovated.
The front room of the building, for
merly dedicated to the exclusive use
of a seldom-used fireplace and erst
while entrance way, has been added to
the Varsity dressing room. This was
done by removing the shower-baths,
which formed the partition between
the two rooms. The addition has
created a large and pleasant dressing
room reaching from the front of the
building to the barred windows over
looking the gridiron. The eucalyptus
logs crackling in the fireplace are now
able to shed their genial warmth
thruout the spacious robing room.
The showers have been rebuilt along
the northern end of the room, reach
ing from the entrance to the rubbing
room to the door which gives admit
tance to the turf field. Five showers
are now ready there to re-invigorate
the tired athlete.
Benches surround the room on all
sides and the installation of several
new electric lights will serve to dispel
the gloom of winter afternoons, when
practice is over.
The rubbing room and the dressing
room for visiting teams remain the
same. The interior of the quarters
has been painted a pleasing green tint
and the floors have also felt the paint
er's brush. The broken windows are
to be replaced within a few days.
The work entailed an outlay of some
$325 and it has been well expended.
The quarters will now be large
enough to accommodate the Varsity
squads with some pretense of com
fort.
The renovated quarters will be the
home of the baseball men for the rest
of the season.
