# SHIPPER OF CALIFORNIA CAPTURES CARNOT MEDAL
## Stanford Superior in Argument, but Style of California Man's Speech Appeals to Judges. 
### 
F. M. Shipper, '12. of the University
of California is today wearing the
Carnot Medal, having won the right to
this much-prized piece of jewelry, Sat
urday evening in one ot' the most bril
liant of the seventepu Carnot Debates.
Shipper was closely pressed by his
five rivals, all of whom presented
most penetrating discussions of the
question, "Resolved, That the develop
ments of the labor problem during the
last decade have threatened the sta
bility of the French Republic." The
judges of the evening, Judge Lucien
Shaw of the Supreme Bench, Henry
Payot and Charles A. Murdock, truly
declared after puzzling for some time
over their decision, that the unusual
forensic talent evidenced and the
equal division of merit among the
speakers made the proper disposal of
the medal difficult. The qualities
which won Shipper the decision were
his forceful delivery, fluency, and
slightly flowery and oratorical style,
backed, however, by excellent reason
ing and knowledge of the subject. The
Stanford speakers, R. J. Miller, '11, F.
H. Hilton, '11, and E. E. Tincher, '12,
consistently excelled in argument, and
had the medal been awarded on that
basis, or had the contest been an ordi
nary debate between teams, would
without doubt have won the de
cision.
Under the rules of the Carnot, a gen
eral subject, "The Relation of the
French Government to the Labor Prob
lem," was given out on November 18.
The specific question given above,
however, was chosen by a joint faculty
committee of the two colleges and an
nounced to the debaters at six o'clock
Saturday evening. The six men then
chose the sides they would uphold and
were allowed two hours to arrange
their material. At eight o'clock Pres
ident David Starr Jordan as chairman
introduced J. G. Sweet of California
as tlie first speaker for the affirmative.
Sweet argued that there is an organi
zation in France, the General Confed
eration of Labor, which is admittedly
revolutionary in aim, and therefore
threatens the stability of the govern
ment. and furthermore that this con
federation is possessed of sufficient
power to overthrow the republic.
Sweet's presentation of the matter was
thoughtful and forcible.
A second California!!, T. B. Kitt
redge of the negative, then maintained
that the labor confederation or "C. G.
T." is not in itself dangerous, unless

its methods and measures should
spread to other classes of people, and
that this is impossible owing to the
conservative temperament of the
French.
Tincher of Stanford next argued for
the affirmative that the stability of a
government depends on the stability
of the governing body and on the con
dition of those being governed. He
maintained that the latter condition
was such as to threaten the stability
of the French government. Drawing
several historical parallels, he argued
that there is in France a class struggle
already well advanced. The "C. G. T."
said the speaker after tracing its his
tory, gains its ends by the general
strike and other illegal means. Tinch
er's speech was particularly well ar
ranged, and was delivered in a finished
manner.
Stanford again had its innings when
Hilton in an argument delivered in a
most earnest and effective manner
supported the negative. He stated that
a distinction exists between merely
threatening the government and threat
ening the stability of that government.
Examining the three principal strikes
of recent years in France, he demon
strated that none of them were of such
a character as to threaten the stability
of the republic, and that conservative
ideals still have a strong hold upon
the French people. Hilton's conclu
sion was that the strikes were in real
ity an awakening force beneficial to
the government.
Shipper who spoke next on the af
firmative cited instances to show that
the strikes threatened the stability of
the government. He argued that the
"C. G. T." is anarchistic in tempera
ment, has a settled revolutionary pol
icy and favors the general strikes as
p. means to revolution.
Miller of Stanford then supported
the negative in the most logical argu
ment of the evening. "We must con
sider a nation,"he said,"from the point
of view of its world position. The
power to preserve its place among the
nations and the power to enforce the
internal regulations of government
constitute the stability of a govern
ment. Miller's further argument tend
ed in an effective way to show that
France today fulfills both these con
ditions.
Rebuttal speeches in which the men
continued these lines of argument,
concluded a closely fought and inter
esting contest.
