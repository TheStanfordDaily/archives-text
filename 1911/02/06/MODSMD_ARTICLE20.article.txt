# SEATTLE DIVINE STEAKS ON THE PURPOSE OF LIFE.
## Rev. E. V. Shayler Delivers Telling Sermon at Regular Sunday Service. 
### 
Rev. E. V. Shayler of Seattle,
preached a strong sermon at the reg
ular service yesterday morning on
"The Conceived Idea of the Purpose
of Life." He said that every man
must work out his own conception, and
that his purpose should not be "to get
on in the world, but to get the world
on."
Going back to Genesis, Mr. Shayler
read of the creation of man in the
image of God, and said that the con
ceived purpose of man was the per
fection of each of the three elements
of his nature, body, mind and soul.
After the creation he read of the temp
tation, threefold in character, first of
Adam, and then of Christ, illustrating
the fact that "temptations are oppor
tunities for the strengthening of man's
conceived purpose." Finally, he pre
sented the beautiful picture of the
Transfiguration, in which the goodness
of the perfect man shone from within,
giving brilliance to the outer man.
