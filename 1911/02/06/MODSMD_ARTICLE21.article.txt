# TENNIS PROSPECTS BRIGHTEN WITH THE WEATHER.
## 
### 
With the good weather coming on,
the tennis enthusiasts have a busy
season before them. Besides the reg
ular Varsity try-out tournament
which conies at this time, there is yet
to be played the Thiele handicap
singles and the inter-class doubles.
The Inter-collegiate matches are
scheduled for the morning of the Var
sity track meet, and the following Sat
urday.
Last season's captain, Horace Mann,
having failed to return this semester,
has left two prominent veterans for
the team, H. S. Morgan, '12, last year's
inter-class champion and R. L. Mur
ray, '13, winner of the Thiele trophy.
W. Dawson, '14, present inter-class
champion, and A. Cawston, '14, are
both men to be looked to when the
season starts. Besides these men
there are several other players who
will apparently have to be reckoned
with, judging from their fall play.
