# MIRACLE PLAYS PROVE HIGHLY ENTERTAINING
## ENGLISH CLUB PRODUCTION MEETS WITH POPULAR FAVOR. Proves Excellent Vehicle for Showing Growth and Development of Modern Drama. 
### 
The glamor of a remote past, to
gether with the strong natural inter
est we all have in the contemplation of
the manners and spirit of our own
ancestors, as well as the intrinsic
beauty of music, oratory, and specta
cle, made the performance of the
English Miracle Plays on Friday and
Saturday of last week a noteworthy
event, at once valuable and entertain
ing. Mr. Hassett and the English
Club are to be congratulated.
To attend a miracle play in the time
of Chaucer, would delight any intel
ligent human being. A performance
today which approximates the perfor
mance of the age of Chaucer, should
interest a college audience. This does

not need argument. The enterprise of
putting on the Miracle Plays was
worthy of the English Club, and the
results more than justify the time and
pains devoted to it.
Not only as the reconstruction of a
past age, and as a link in the develop
ment of our drama, was this perfor
mance praiseworthy, but also as a
thing in itself beautiful. The tableaux
were impressive in the simple dignity
of their setting, in the harmony of
their tones ,and in their remarkable
grouping. Rembrandt is said, by a re
cent critic, to have got many an in
spiration from the theatrical perfor
mance of his time. A modern painter
might well have profited by hints from
Mr. Hassett's composition.
In action and in repose, the players
seemed admirably trained as well as
sympathetic. Even the Roman sena
tors in the splendid Octavian and
Sibyl play were better than anything
we have had in the way of supernum
eraries for many a day. The voices,
too, of the principal characters, though
for the most part entirely new to the
audience, showed surprising power
and range in expression. One remem
bers with especial pleasure the work
of Mr. Lingo as Octavian, of Miss Pratt
as the Sibyl, Mr. Finnie and Miss
Holes, as the Angel Gabriel and Mary
and Mr. Larkin as Joseph.
