# A 						Poor Carnot Question.
## 
### 
An exceptionally well balanced and
able team went down to defeat before
Shipper of California in the seventeenth
annual Carnot Debate Friday evening.
Although meeting an individual de
feat, Stanford can console herself with
the certain knowledge that as an In
tercollegiate team, tho Cardinal de
baters were vastly superior to their
opponents. The large crowd which
witnessed the fiery battle of words
was a gratifying feature of the even
ing. The question debated was un
fortunately worded, being too general
in its scope and leaving too many
loopholes for quibbling and individual
interpretation. A Carnot question, to
be in keeping with the purpose of the
debate should be specific. Otherwise
the superficial student gifted with a
glil) tongue and having only a general
knowledge of the subject has an undue
advantage over the thoro student,
whose stock in trade is sound argu
ment and exhaustive information.
