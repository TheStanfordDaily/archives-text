# The 						Stanford Union
## 
### 
An active campaign for the collec
tion of life membership dues to the
Stanford Union has been started by the

local committee. That the
efforts of the collectors
should meet with success
is of utmost importance to
Stanford. No other student

movement should receive more active
support this semester than the Stan
ford Union. A creditable beginning
has been made in the great campaign
to raise the $50,000 necessary to build
the clubhouse, in fact so creditable a
start as to assure the breaking of
ground within the present year. If
those pledged for life memberships
can find it possible to pay their as
sessments or a part of them when the
collectors call, we may see the first
spadefull of earth turned this semes
ter.
Judging from the support which the
Freshman Class has given the Union,
it would seem that the first year
men do not realize what the Stanford
Union will mean to them and to all
future generations of Stanford men.
1914 of all classes will get. the greatest
benefit from the institution and will
have the greatest opportunity of lay
ing down the broad general lines upon
which it will be conducted and main
tained. The success of any institution
largely depends on the kind of a start
it gets. Pioneers often do not realize
that it is they who establish traditions
and customs which are respected by
all who follow after them. 1914 then
should realize its responsibility and
give the Union an early start by sub
scribing life memberships. Many
others can profitably follow suit and
all of us can pay the pledges we have
already made.
