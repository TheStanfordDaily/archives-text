# PHILANTHROPIST FELS ADVOCATES SINGLE TAX
## LARGE AUDIENCE HEARS DISCIPLE OF GEORGE. Philadelphia Millionaire Relieves Laud Value Should Fix Tax Rates. 
### 
As Doctor Jordan said in introduc
ing him, five minutes after the audi
ence had met Joseph Fels, the million-

aire proprietor of Fels-Naphtha soap
Company of Philadelphia, they felt
they knew him. His ready wit and
business-like manner of presenting hi.->
views held the attention of the large
audience which filled the Chapel last
night to hear his famous lecture on
"Economic Justice."
Fels is a disciple of Henry George,
the single tax advocate. He wants to
abolish the conditions that make mil
lionaires and tramps. The speaker
held that the value of our lands should
fix our tax levies. He also proposes
free commerce between all nations and
thinks that the tariff reform in the
United States is a fraud on the whole
American people.
"The increased value of lands re
sulting from movements in population
does not belong to the individual but
to society," said Fels. "The system by
which a man has the right to own
land for speculative purposes should
net lie permitted.
"We can't get rich under present
conditions without robbing somebody.
I've done it; but now I am proposing
to spend the money to wipe out the
system by which I made it. It. is the
possession of the land which gives us
possession of the lives of the
people."
Fels spends most of his time in Eng
land, where he has been financing the
agitation which has made the land tax
question in the budget of John Bull's
government the most mooted topic of
the day.
