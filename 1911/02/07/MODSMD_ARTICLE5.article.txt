# TRACK MEN ARE PUT ON STRICT TRAINING RULES
## DANCING WILL BE UNDER THE BAN AFTER MARCH 1. Captain Bellah Announces an Informal Meet for Every Saturday Afternoon. 
### 
The entire track squad went into
strict training last night, and a gen
eral request has been made that the
athletes be allowed to enjoy their
peaceful slumbers unmolested, after
11 o'clock each night. The men con
cerned will not be compelled to forgo
the pleasure of dancing until March 1,
and after that date, the Junior Prom
will be made the only exception.
Rigorous training begins this week
in every event, and Captain Bellah will
try out the men in an informal meet
every Saturday. Every man out is
expected to enter these meets. They
will begin at. 3:30, unless this hour
conflicts with tlie baseball schedule
and in that event, they will be held in
tho morning.
The prospects in the weight events
grow brighter for Stanford each day.
C. E. Olmstead, '14, sprang a surprise
last evening by tossing the hammer
out 141 feet, 2 inches. J. E. Woolley,
'12, followed this up with a heave of
141 feet, 8 inches. Several other men
have easily passed the 130 foot mark.
K. L. Dole, '11, is leading shot put
ters with 40 feet to his credit. W. L.
Smith, '12, C. E. Olmstead, '14, E. L.
Peck, '1.3, and W. E. Smith, '14, are
all following closely and are expected
to improve rapidly.
Trials are being run each night,
many of which are being made in good
time, considering the poor opportunity
the men have had to train during the
past few weeks.
