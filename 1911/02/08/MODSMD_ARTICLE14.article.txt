Since November the Library has
been able to acquire several sets of
periodicals some of which serve to
complete important sets. Of these,
the English periodicals Frazer's mag
azine 1830- 1882 (when it ceased pub
lication) and the Westminister Review
1824-1904, with series 1-5 of the Liv
ing Age form most valuable additions
to the general reference department.
These are all indexed by Poole.
The Zeitschrift fur wissenschaftlich
mikroskopie and Deutsche botonische
gesellschaftlich Berichte from the first
volume, the Transactions and Journals
of the Linnean society of London
1788-date and the publications of the
Berlin Akademie der wissenschaften
1885-date including both the Abhand
lungen and Berichte are important
new accessions on the scientific side,
while the files of the American natur
alist, Journal de l'anatomie, and Ar
chives italiennes de biologie have been
completed.

umes of interesting and in some cases
rare and valuable works on China,
