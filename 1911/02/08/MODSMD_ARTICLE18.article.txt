# DOUBLE DEBATE TRYOUTS TO BE HELD THIS MONTH.
## Teams to Meet University of Oregon and Washington Will be Chosen. 
### 
Tryouts for the debates with the
Universities of Oregon and Washing
ton will be held the last week of this
month. The question which will be
argued is: "Resolved, That the United
States should adopt a system of ship
feuhs'diee.'
All who intend to try out should
give their names to R. J. Miller, 11,
F. H. Hilton, '11, F. E. Hill, '11, or
W. Tucker, Jr., '12, so that squads may
be formed. The squad into which a
man is placed will have nothing to do
with his chances for making one of
the teams, as the speaker will be
judged by his individual effort.
As there are two debates on the
same evening, one with Washington
at Seattle, and the other with Oregon
here, six debaters will be chosen to
represent the Uinversity. There will
be two speakers and an alternate on
each team. The negative team will
go North, while that of the affirmative
will debate at home, but the side on
which one tries out will not necessar
ily be the side on which he will be
placed in the debate.
