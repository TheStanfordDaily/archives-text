# RECOMMENDS REGULATION OF VARIOUS STUDENT ACTIVITIES
## Registrar O. L. Elliott, in Recently Published Essay, Proposes Methods of Raising University Standards. 
### 
A remarkable and significant ad
dress made before the Forum last
December by Dr. O. L. Elliott, Stan
ford's registrar, has just appeared in
pamphlet form. It is entitled "Uni
versity Standards and Student Activi
ties," and while outlining 110 definite
policy, it clearly states what in Doctor
Elliott's opinion should be the course
pursued by the present day University
towards what he terms "the monstrous
structure of student activities."
Quoting from the leading university
presidents and professors, Dr. Elliott
builds up a strong indictment of the
work of the present-day college. He
charges the average college student
with lack of definiteness of aim, with
disregard if not frank contempt of
scholarship, and an unproportionate
engrossment in student affairs rather
than study.
With a realism which it would seen
impossible to have been drawn from
purely imaginary sources, he follows
the course of a mythical Freshman at
a composite college of the various
critics of modern higher education.
Some of his pictures are as follows:
"For days, weeks even, before the
opening of college old students have
drifted in. They have not done this in
order to consult the authorities the
better to plan and prepare for the
studies of the year. They have plans
of their own. They are at starting the
wheel within the wheel. They are about
the planning of courses in athletics, in
dramatics, in rushing, in tubbing, in
college traditions generally. They
have their own uses for the incoming
freshman class and their own trying
and elaborate admission require
ments."
"While the academic sideshow of
lectures and recitations is getting it
selt started in halting fashion, the
freshman is in the fierce struggle and
jov of real college life. As free of con
ventional wrappings as nature made
him, he is paraded and tubbed in open
daylight around faculty lawns and
campus houses."

Once well started the freshman
finds, "The main object is to keep
from flunking out; for as yet absolute
immunity has not been achieved, and
real college life is too pleasurable to
be hazarded too far."
"Once in a while the committee —
blankety symbol of all that is hateful
in an otherwise lovely environment—
the committee connects with some
luckless offender, who, bruised and be
wildered presently finds himself at the
edge of the campus. All of which
would be tragic, were it not so gro
tesque, for but a single head has been
hit out of a multitude just below the
line of the breastworks. More and
more absorbing are the activities of
the college of student life; more and
more the faculty's college and its ob
trusive exercises become an in
cubus."
After citing from many of America's
foremost educators to show that this
condition is real and widespread, Dr.
Elliott deals with the causes to which
various critics have ascribed the pres
ent system. He warmly defends the
elective system, which some have
blamed as being responsible, calling
it the "most clarifying principle in
modern higher education." The atti
tude adopted by Columbia University,
which frankly provides departments
for those who come, not to study, but
for the social side of college life, he
has little sympathy for, sarcastically
referring to its "academic annex for
majors in dulness, athletics and social
functions."
Dr. Elliot finds his solution in a
strict regulation by the college of stu
dent activities. In his own words,
"It is that the college take charge of
its own affairs."
"The main point is the will and de
termination of Alma Mater to have and
to have respected, standards of under
graduate conduct and achievement,
in the face of such determination the
loftiest structure buttressed by col
lege tradition is a mere house of
cards."

finds, "The main object is to keep
from flunking out; for as yet absolute
immunity has not been achieved, and
real college life is too pleasurable to
be hazarded too far."
"Once in a while the committee —
blankety symbol of all that is hateful
in an otherwise lovely environment—
the committee connects with some
luckless offender, who, bruised and be
wildered presently finds himself at the
edge of the campus. All of which
would be tragic, were it not so gro
tesque, for but a single head has been
hit out of a multitude just below the
line of the breastworks. More and
more absorbing are the activities of
the college of student life; more and
more the faculty's college and its ob
trusive exercises become an in
cubus."
After citing from many of America's
foremost educators to show that this
condition is real and widespread, Dr.
Elliott deals with the causes to which
various critics have ascribed the pres
ent system. He warmly defends the
elective system, which some have
blamed as being responsible, calling
it the "most clarifying principle in
modern higher education." The atti
tude adopted by Columbia University,
which frankly provides departments
for those who come, not to study, but
for the social side of college life, he
has little sympathy for, sarcastically
referring to its "academic annex for
majors in dulness, athletics and social
functions."
Dr. Elliot finds his solution in a
strict regulation by the college of stu
dent activities. In his own words,
"It is that the college take charge of
its own affairs."
"The main point is the will and de
termination of Alma Mater to have and
to have respected, standards of under
graduate conduct and achievement,
in the face of such determination the
loftiest structure buttressed by col
lege tradition is a mere house of
cards."
A remarkable and significant ad
dress made before the Forum last
December by Dr. O. L. Elliott, Stan
ford's registrar, has just appeared in
pamphlet form. It is entitled "Uni
versity Standards and Student Activi
ties," and while outlining 110 definite
policy, it clearly states what in Doctor
Elliott's opinion should be the course
pursued by the present day University
towards what he terms "the monstrous
structure of student activities."
Quoting from the leading university
presidents and professors, Dr. Elliott
builds up a strong indictment of the
work of the present-day college. He
charges the average college student
with lack of definiteness of aim, with
disregard if not frank contempt of
scholarship, and an unproportionate
engrossment in student affairs rather
than study.
With a realism which it would seen
impossible to have been drawn from
purely imaginary sources, he follows
the course of a mythical Freshman at
a composite college of the various
critics of modern higher education.
Some of his pictures are as follows:
"For days, weeks even, before the
opening of college old students have
drifted in. They have not done this in
order to consult the authorities the
better to plan and prepare for the
studies of the year. They have plans
of their own. They are at starting the
wheel within the wheel. They are about
the planning of courses in athletics, in
dramatics, in rushing, in tubbing, in
college traditions generally. They
have their own uses for the incoming
freshman class and their own trying
and elaborate admission require
ments."
"While the academic sideshow of
lectures and recitations is getting it
selt started in halting fashion, the
freshman is in the fierce struggle and
jov of real college life. As free of con
ventional wrappings as nature made
him, he is paraded and tubbed in open
daylight around faculty lawns and
campus houses."

Once well started the freshman
finds, "The main object is to keep
from flunking out; for as yet absolute
immunity has not been achieved, and
real college life is too pleasurable to
be hazarded too far."
"Once in a while the committee —
