# ENGLISH CLUB WILL CHOOSE PLAYS IN NEW MANNER.
## 
### 
According to the latest plans, the
English Club will in the future choose
the plays which they will present, by
a committee appointed early in the
year. This committee will each ex
amine some phase of the drama and
will report to the club. In this way
the club hopes to expedite the choos
ing of a play, and to have the major
portion of the work done before the
opening of college. It is planned now
to give a play next semester.
