# JUNIORS WILL GATHER IN ARMORY TOMORROW NIGHT
## MONSTER 1912 JOLLY-UP TO START AT 8 O'CLOCK. Novel "Feed" Will Form Feature of Evening's Entertainment. Admission Fifty Cents. 
### 
Eight o'clock tomorrow evening will
find Armory Hall the rendezvous of
the members of the Junior class. The
occasion is the third monster combined
jolly-up of the class of 1912. Dancing
will be the chief diversion of the even
ing. Between dances several novel
stunts and numerous songs will be
introduced to break the monotony of
continuous dancing.
Informality will as in the past be the
spirit of the occasion. All attending
will be given tags on which, to write
their names so that introduction will
not be necessary. Shirt-waists and
skirts, and soft shirts and corduroys,
will be the proper dress. No "queen
ing" to and from the hall is the man
date which has gone forth from the
committee.
The feature of the evening .vill be
the "feed" which will be entirely dif
ferent from any heretofore served.
The committee wish to announce that
a good substitute has been found for
the proverbial potato salad which has
formed the "piece de resistence" of
former means. What it is they re
fuse to divulge, but ample assurance
is given that it will be found highly
acceptable.
An assessment of fifty cents will be
collected at the door from all who at
tend. This it is thought will prove suf
ficient to meet the expenses of the
jolly-up. Special free cars will be
provided at twelve o'clock to carry the
merrymakers back to the campus.
Excellent music has been secured
and a good time is promised everyone.
Every Junior in college should make
it his or her business to be present and
know the rest of the class.
