# Debating Contestants to Meet.
## 
### 
Of importance to all those who are
trying out for the debates with Oregon
and Washington is the call issued for
a meeting of these candidates tomor
row at 1:10, in room 12 of the Law
building. This gathering will be for
the purpose of allowing the entries in
the tryout to choose the side of the
question they wish to uphold, and for
dividing them into squads. The inter
society Debating Committee, which
has the matter in charge, states the
attendance of each man will be to his
own interests.
