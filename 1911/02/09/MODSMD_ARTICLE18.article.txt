# FORMER STANFORD MEN ARE NOW STATE SOLONS.
## University Law Students Attain Prominence in Present Legislature. 
### 
Six former students of Stanford Uni
versity are members of the California
State legislature now in session at
Sacramento. All were Law majors
while here and the practice of their
profession has evidently brought them
before the public eye at least in the
districts they represent.
A. Joel, who attended Stanford from
1905 till 1907, is representing a San
Francisco district in the House. He
made a remarkably good record as a
student while here and is taking a
very prominent part in the work of the
lower legislative body.

President of the Press Club.
L. H. Roseberry, A.8., Pre-legal, '03,
of Santa Barbara, who also has a seat
in the upper house, is the only one
whose record in student activities in
any way foreshadowed his political
career. He was president of the Phi 1-
olexian Debating Society, an old time
rival of Nestoria and Euphronia, As
sistant Student Body Treasurer, and
Manager of the Chaparral. Both Cut
