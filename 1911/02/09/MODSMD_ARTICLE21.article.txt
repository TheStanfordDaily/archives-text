# TWO NEOPHYTES MAKE MIRTH FOR CAMPUS THIS MORNING.
## Press Club Initiates Men Prominent in Stanford Journalism.â€”Robinson and King Give Stunts. 
### 
Another initiation held the boards
this morning from the 10:15 period to
the final wind-up on the Post Office
steps. The Press Club with two in
itiates, L. M. Robinson, '12, and A. T.
King, '12, staged the affair.
Although it started out quietly the
initiation ended with a magnificent
burst of all those things which are
dear to the heart of the "rough."
At 10:15 dissertations on "queening"
and cigarette smoking occupied the at
tention of the neophytes, these fol
lowed at 11:15 by a thrilling collision
between touring cars, and a battle of
words between a young lady of ex
traordinary exterior and King. Finally
on the Post Office steps an "opera
bluff" was given which was rather
more full of racy jokes than is usual
with affairs of the kind. The scene
represented the Registrar's office, and
there was given a complete demon
station of the methods employed to
remove the sheckels.
Robinson is a member of the "Se
quoia" staff while King does art for
the "Chaparral" and is art editor of
the 1912 "Quad."
