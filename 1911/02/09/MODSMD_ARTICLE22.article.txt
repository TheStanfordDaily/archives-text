# FRESHMEN POSTPONE JOLLY-UP UNTIL AFTER TRACK SEASON.
## Roth Warns First Year Students Against Rough Tactics at Ball Game. 
### 
Student Advisor A. E. Roth warned
the Freshmen at their meeting this
afternoon against a repetition of the
rough tactics that marked last year's
struggle between the Underclassmen
for the possession of the baseball at
the close of the annual game. A re
currence he said, of the objectionable
features would mean the discontin
uance of the custom in the future.
He also criticised the manner in
which the last Freshman jolly-up was
conducted, urging upon the committee
the necessity of making the coming
one a "non-queening" affair, and one
in which the members of the class
should meet more generally than they
did at the last.
It was decided to postpone the
jolly-up after the close of training
season for the track men. The meet
ing closed with a lengthy discussion
of ways and means to get possession
of the ball after tonight's game.
