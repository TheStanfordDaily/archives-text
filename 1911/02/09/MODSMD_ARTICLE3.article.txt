# EXPEDITION OF STANFORD MEN TO EXPLORE BRAZILIAN COAST
## Professors Under Leadership of Dr. Branner to Study South American Geology and Zoology This Summer. 
### 
For the purpose of exploring an
hitherto impenetrated region of the
Northwest coast of Brazil, a zoologi
cal expedition of Stanford men has

been organized.
Under the lead
ership of Dr. John
C. Branner, head
of the Geology De
partment. of the
University, a party
composed of Prof.
H. Heath, Prof. E.
C. Starks, Prof.O.P.
Jenkins, W. Mann,
G. C. Branner, E. R.
Leib and possibly

Prof. F. M. McFarland and Dr. Fred
Maker of San Diego, will sail from
New York April 15 for the Southern
republic. Professor McFarland has
not yet definitely decided to make the
trip, but his colleagues are making
every effort to persuade him to go.
While not a Stanford man. Doctor
Baker is a warm friend of Doctor
Branner. With his exception, the ex
pedition is to be entirely of Stanford
men.
The scientists are assured of the co
operation of the Brazilian government
in their work. They hope to be fur
nished with a gunboat by the republic
on their arrival at Natal the starting
point of the expedition. If, however,
the Brazilian government does not see
fit to place a naval vessel at the
disposal of the men, a private steamer
will be chartered.
The object of the zoological expedi
tion is to determine how far the Ama
zon river acts as a barrier to the nat
ural movements of animals of the
region. A painstaking geological sur
vey of the coast region also is to be
made.
Doctor Branner for more than eight
years has lived in Brazil and is pecu
liarly fitted to lead the expedition by
reason of his knowledge of the topo
graphy of the republic and its people.
Very little is known of the coast
region of Brazil which the Stanford

scientists will explore. In preparing
for the trip the men have found no
written records of the country, so that
they will invade what practically is
virgin soil from a scientific point of
view.
Doctor Branner will direct the whole
expedition and devote himself largely
to the geological investigations of the
party. Professor Heath especially is
interested in corals, and Professor
Starks will study the fishes of the
region. If Professor McFarland makes
the trip he will spend most of his time
investigating mollusks and other in
vertebrates.
Mann, who is a student assistant
member of the party, will collect and
study reptiles. Branner, Jr., and Lieb
will go as auxiliary members of the
party and will be available for all
sorts of topographical and collecting
work, although Leib will do some work
with insects. Doctor Baker, if he is a
member of the party, will devote his
time to his favorite study, concholog.v.
Collections will be made by the party
to be shipped to the University, where
they will be distributed.
The trip will be written up in full
detail and volumes of scientific data
will be obtained.
The country to be investigated by
the expedition lies along 2,000 miles of
the Brazilian coast line. The party
will arrive at Para from New York,
where they will take a coasting vessel
south to Natal, where they hope to
obtain the government boat and begin
the expedition. From Natal the party
will sail North back up the coast,
making frequent, stops where they see
fit, with trips to the interior, where
the geological and zoological surveys
and investigations will be carried on.
Guiana will be the objective point and
from there the trip home will be
made.
The party expects to return to Stan
ford by the opening of college next
semester, if, as Doctor Branner has
pointed out, they are not shipwrecked
enroute.

expedition and devote himself largely
to the geological investigations of the
party. Professor Heath especially is
interested in corals, and Professor
Starks will study the fishes of the
region. If Professor McFarland makes
the trip he will spend most of his time
investigating mollusks and other in
vertebrates.
Mann, who is a student assistant
member of the party, will collect and
study reptiles. Branner, Jr., and Lieb
will go as auxiliary members of the
party and will be available for all
sorts of topographical and collecting
work, although Leib will do some work
with insects. Doctor Baker, if he is a
member of the party, will devote his
time to his favorite study, concholog.v.
Collections will be made by the party
to be shipped to the University, where
they will be distributed.
The trip will be written up in full
detail and volumes of scientific data
will be obtained.
The country to be investigated by
the expedition lies along 2,000 miles of
the Brazilian coast line. The party
will arrive at Para from New York,
where they will take a coasting vessel
south to Natal, where they hope to
obtain the government boat and begin
the expedition. From Natal the party
will sail North back up the coast,
making frequent, stops where they see
fit, with trips to the interior, where
the geological and zoological surveys
and investigations will be carried on.
Guiana will be the objective point and
from there the trip home will be
made.
The party expects to return to Stan
ford by the opening of college next
semester, if, as Doctor Branner has
pointed out, they are not shipwrecked
enroute.

For the purpose of exploring an
hitherto impenetrated region of the
Northwest coast of Brazil, a zoologi
cal expedition of Stanford men has

been organized.
Under the lead
ership of Dr. John
C. Branner, head
of the Geology De
partment. of the
University, a party
composed of Prof.
H. Heath, Prof. E.
C. Starks, Prof.O.P.
Jenkins, W. Mann,
G. C. Branner, E. R.
Leib and possibly

Prof. F. M. McFarland and Dr. Fred
Maker of San Diego, will sail from
New York April 15 for the Southern
republic. Professor McFarland has
not yet definitely decided to make the
trip, but his colleagues are making
every effort to persuade him to go.
While not a Stanford man. Doctor
Baker is a warm friend of Doctor
Branner. With his exception, the ex
pedition is to be entirely of Stanford
men.
The scientists are assured of the co
operation of the Brazilian government
in their work. They hope to be fur
nished with a gunboat by the republic
on their arrival at Natal the starting
point of the expedition. If, however,
the Brazilian government does not see
fit to place a naval vessel at the
disposal of the men, a private steamer
will be chartered.
The object of the zoological expedi
tion is to determine how far the Ama
zon river acts as a barrier to the nat
ural movements of animals of the
region. A painstaking geological sur
vey of the coast region also is to be
made.
Doctor Branner for more than eight
years has lived in Brazil and is pecu
liarly fitted to lead the expedition by
reason of his knowledge of the topo
graphy of the republic and its people.
Very little is known of the coast
region of Brazil which the Stanford

scientists will explore. In preparing
for the trip the men have found no
written records of the country, so that
they will invade what practically is
virgin soil from a scientific point of
view.
Doctor Branner will direct the whole
expedition and devote himself largely
to the geological investigations of the
party. Professor Heath especially is
interested in corals, and Professor
Starks will study the fishes of the
region. If Professor McFarland makes
