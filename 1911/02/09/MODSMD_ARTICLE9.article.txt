# Jolly-up Frosh!
## 
### 
The few words of advice given by
Student Adviser Roth at the Freshman
Class meeting today should be well

taken by the first year stu
dents. A jolly-up which
does not jolly-up fails of
its purpose. The purpose

is to get everybody acquainted with
everybody else. Because the Senior,
Junior, and Sophomore Classes have
held such successful affairs, the jolly
up, aside from athletics is considered
the main spring of the Stanford spirit.
It seems indispensable to the joy and
charm of campus life and we wonder
how previous classes have passed
their four years at Stanford without
it. 1911 in starting the custom has
instituted a tradition not only enjoy
able and pleasant, but one of far
reaching and fundamental importance.
As a result of it, Democracy will be
the true as well as the reputed key
note of Stanford life for all time to
come. When the Stanford Union is
built a general University jolly-up will
he strictly in order.
The natural Freshman reticence
possibly accounts for the lack of
spontaneity at the last festivity.
Among themselves the Fourteeners
should extend themselves and make
up for all cruel restraint of upper
class discipline. There will lie no
"keying down.'
Getting acquainted is a simple mat
ter. Start every dance a Paul Jones
and end it a robber. You'll be sur
prised at the number of people you'll
meet whom you have never seen
before!
