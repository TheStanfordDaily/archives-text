# JUNIOR PROM WILL BE HELD FRIDAY MARCH 24.
## 1912 Committee Sets Date for Important Social Event. â€” Novel Features Promised. 
### 
Friday evening, March 24, has been
announced as the date for the 1912
Junior Prom. At that time, this the
best social event of the entire college
year will be held in Encina Clubroom,
the scene of all the Proms of the past.
From the plans which have already
been formulated, the 1912 affair should
prove one of the most successful ever
held.
The date was selected at a meeting
of the Prom Committee at the Pi Beta
Phi house yesterday evening. The
features of the dance, which will dis
tinguish it from past Proms came in
for a lengthy consideration, at the
meeting, but none of these can as yet
be divulged by the committeemen, ft
was decided to limit the number of
tickets sold so as to guard against an
over crowded floor, the exact limit to
be announced later. Undoubtedly the
outer lobby of Encina will be fitted up
as a reception room, as it was last
year, thus leaving only the clubroom
proper for the dancers.
Supper, which will be served on the
second floor lobby will come during
the ninth and twelfth dances. Those
buying tickets will be given odd and
even numbers. Those holding like
numbers will have refreshments at the
same time. Several extra dances will
be enjoyed by one half of the dancers
while the other half are at supper.
There will be fourteen dances on the
program.
