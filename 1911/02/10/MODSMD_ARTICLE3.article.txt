For the first time in four years the
Junior class will stage an original
local opera when they present the
"Uvernian Princess" in the Assembly
Hall 011 March 23. The date set by
the committee in charge comes on a
Thursday evening, while the Prom will
take place on the following evening.
Yesterday the cast for the opera
was announced and is substantially as
that given above. Some slight changes
may take place in the disposition of
the various members of the chorus,
but the principals have all been
chosen.
The opera is by three Stanford
students, the music being done by Miss
Mary Herdman, ex-'l2, and .T. L. Mc-
Donald, '14. The book and lyrics are
by ,T. H. Forbes, '13. The authors
have succeeded in obtaining both a
plot of exceptional originality and
music of more than average catchi
ness. Those who have heard the music
are of the opinion that the whole
campus will be whistling the best of
the airs on the morning following the
opera.
The work is in three acts. The first
two are laid at Stanford while the

third is at Uvernia. The hero is Ash
ley Moore, a typical Stanford athlete
and non-queener. The Princess Adel
heid of Uvernia who is a friend of
Alice Martin, a sorority girl, is in
America studying, and comes to Stan
ford. Ashley falls in love with her
and finally takes her to the Prom. The
second act is laid at the Prom, where
much clever dialogue and music is
brought forth. When Ashley discovers
that, the Princess is going to Uvernia
he decided to follow her. He is ac
companied by Benny Fay, his chum,
who is in love with Alice Martin. She
has gone to Uvernia with the Princess.
The last act is particularly good and
is devoted to releasing the Princess
from her old engagement with the
Rhandar of Alexia, and a happy con
clusion in which the hero marries the
heroine and his chum marries the
ingenue.
The chorus and principals have been
chosen after a careful selection on the
part of the committee and the coach.
Over one hundred and twenty tried
out, from which number the cast was
chosen.
