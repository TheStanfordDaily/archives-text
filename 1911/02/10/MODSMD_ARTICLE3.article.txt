For the first time in four years the
Junior class will stage an original
local opera when they present the
"Uvernian Princess" in the Assembly
Hall 011 March 23. The date set by
the committee in charge comes on a
Thursday evening, while the Prom will
take place on the following evening.
Yesterday the cast for the opera
was announced and is substantially as
that given above. Some slight changes
may take place in the disposition of
the various members of the chorus,
but the principals have all been
chosen.
The opera is by three Stanford
students, the music being done by Miss
Mary Herdman, ex-'l2, and .T. L. Mc-
Donald, '14. The book and lyrics are
by ,T. H. Forbes, '13. The authors
have succeeded in obtaining both a
plot of exceptional originality and
music of more than average catchi
ness. Those who have heard the music
are of the opinion that the whole
campus will be whistling the best of
the airs on the morning following the
opera.
The work is in three acts. The first
two are laid at Stanford while the

third is at Uvernia. The hero is Ash
ley Moore, a typical Stanford athlete
and non-queener. The Princess Adel
heid of Uvernia who is a friend of
Alice Martin, a sorority girl, is in
America studying, and comes to Stan
ford. Ashley falls in love with her
and finally takes her to the Prom. The
second act is laid at the Prom, where
much clever dialogue and music is
brought forth. When Ashley discovers
that, the Princess is going to Uvernia
he decided to follow her. He is ac
companied by Benny Fay, his chum,
who is in love with Alice Martin. She
has gone to Uvernia with the Princess.
The last act is particularly good and
is devoted to releasing the Princess
from her old engagement with the
Rhandar of Alexia, and a happy con
clusion in which the hero marries the
heroine and his chum marries the
ingenue.
The chorus and principals have been
chosen after a careful selection on the
part of the committee and the coach.
Over one hundred and twenty tried
out, from which number the cast was
chosen.
The leading part of Ashley More
falls to H. Chamberlain, '14. Cham
berlain has never appeared at Stanford
in any dramatic or musical work, as
he only registered this semester. He
has an excellent baritone voice and is
well fitted to take the part. He regis
ters as a special student and is a mem
ber of Delta Upsilon.
Another Freshman will take the sec
ond part. McCourt will be remem
bered for his excellent work in the
Football Show of this year. He is a
member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon.
The role opposite to thatt of the
ingenue will be taken by J. H. Forbes,
'13, the author of the book and lyrics.
Forbes is well known in Stanford
musical work, having appeared in the
1910 Track Meet show and in the
Football Show of this year. His best
work was as leading man in the "Mika
do." Forbes is a member of Delta
Ups'ilon and registers in the Mining
department.
K. Chamberlain, '11. who takes the
part of the Bangar of Uvernia has
frequently appeared before a Stanford
audience. This part is particularly
suited to his talents. Chamberlain
registers in the Pre-legal department
and is a member of Delta Upsilon.
The Rhandar of Alexia will lie play
ed by L. Lewis, '14, who played with
McCourt in the Football Show. Lewis
is a member of Kappa Sigma.
A new man with a very fine voice
is E. R. Furtig, gr. in the part that
be will take he will have an excellent
chance to use it to the best advantage.
The comedy parts of "Fat." the
"Frosh" and "Beetle," have fallen to
G. H. Beurhaus, '13, E. A. Wells, '14,
and C. S. Turpin, '13. All these men
are well able to handle the parts to
which they have been assigned.
The leading feminine role, that of

the Princess, lias been given to Miss A.
Maloney, '14. Miss Maloney has a
sweet clear soprano voice quite suited
to the part.
Tho second part will be taken by
Mi: s E. Coleman, '13. Miss Coleman's
voice which is more of a mezzo-so
prano is exactly suited to the part she
will play.
The ingenue role lias been given to
Miss M. Harrier, '14. This is one of
the most difficult of the feminine roles,
but Miss Harrier has amply demon
strated her ability to carry the part.
As Dutchess Petie, Miss H. Gilbert
will have an excellent chance to do
some character work of a high order.
The part is an important one in the
denouement of the last act.
Sarah Lincoln, the co-ed, will be
played by Miss W. Halsted, '14. This
is a comedy rqle-and for possibilities
i one of the- West.
The first rehearsal will be held on
Saturday morning under the direction
oi.' Coach Bartlett, of San Francisco.
Y/ith practically six weeks for re
hearsals a finished production is as
sured.
