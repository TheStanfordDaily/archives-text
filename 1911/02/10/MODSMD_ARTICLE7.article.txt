# Spring Rugby
## 
### 
After the Big Game last November,
general participation in rugby was
advocated as the best means of turn-

ing out a winning Varsity
for the 1911 season. The
inter-fraternity-inter-club
post season series was the

result. By the close of the semester the
general knowledge of our major sport
was wider spread than before and a
larger number of men were enthu
siastic over the game than during the
Varsity season. Because of that series
more men will come out for the Var
sity next year and our chance for a
victory across the bay is so much the
better.
Along with many others interested
in this series the Daily Palo Alto
would suggest a continuation of the
sport this semester. This same sug
gestion has been offered before and it
is reoffered because it is a good one.
A victory next semester depends al
most entirely upon a general and
technical knowledge of the fine points
of the English game. The mechanical
precision of the California players is
the best measure of their late victories
and a similar efficiency and mastery
of detail 011 Stanford's part will spell
a Cardinal victory. Tt is to secure this
that informal practice and drill in
kicking, passing, and dribbling should
be held this semester. Spring sports
would probably be endangered by any
formal training or set series of games,
but frequent practice in the mechan
ism of rugby is necessary and should
be had. "In time of peace prepare for
war." Stanford needs the preparation.
