# SITE IS CHOSEN FOR NEW BASEBALL DIAMOND
## BOARD OK CONTROL SUBMITS PLAN TO TRUSTEES. Favors Location to the East of Present Auxiliary Football Field. 
### 
That the new baseball diamond will
be located just east of and adjoining
the auxiliary football field was decided

at a meeting of
tho Board of
Control Satur
day. This ]Â»1 a:i
has been sub
mitted to the
Board of Trus
tees and is at
present pending
their sanction.
Several avail-

able sites were up for consideration,
and after much discussion the Board
decided that the one above named is
tht; most desirable.
The proposition will come up before
the Board of Trustees at. their next
meeting and if they look favorably
upon it, construction will be begun as
soon as possible, it is hoped that the
field and bleachers will be completed
before the first game against Cali
fornia.
Another important step was taken at
this meeting, when the construction
committee was authorized to turf the
auxiliary, football field, in preparation
for the coming football season. This
will enable the squad to play all pre
liminary games on the new field, and if
necessary, will also permit of more
than one game being played on Sat
urday afternoons. This work will be
accomplished during this semester,
and will be ready for the squad at
the opening of next season.
With the consent of the Board of
Trustees, the Construction Committee
has already cut. down a number of
eucalyptus trees which have been
overshadowing the present auxiliary
baseball diamond.
