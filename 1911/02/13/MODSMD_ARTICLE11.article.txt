The remarkable and intense interest
being shown in several Stanford or
ganizations during Quad picture tak
ing season reminds us very
Vanity much of the small boy's at-
Fair tendance at Sunday school
immediately before the
Christmas exercises. If the active
membership of all our clubs were on
a par with the face value of one of
"Pop" Franklin's negatives, there
might be less ground for the Regis
trar's Recent polemic. It is the in
tense responsibility of the few and the
indifference of the many which is at
the basis of the arguments against
student activity. If more people
worked and worked along one line
there would be little excuse for Prof.
Gayley's Idols and Dr. Elliott's pamph
let.
