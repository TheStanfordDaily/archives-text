# BARBARIANS DEFEAT DEFEAT STANFORD IN BOTH SOCCER GAMES.
## 
### 
Both soccer games played last Sat
urday on the gymnasium field were
captured by the visiting Barbarians
after very close and exciting contests.
The opening game was between the
first teams and resulted in a victory
for the visitors by a score of 3 to 1.
The field was in very poor condition
preventing fast play or accurate shoot
ing. but the game was remarkably free
from fouls and rough play.
This was the last game of the league
series, and by winning, the city team
secured a lead of one point over Stan
ford in the race for league honors.
Immediately after the contest the
second teams took the field, and the
Barbarians won by a score of 1 to 0
Considering the strength and exper
ience of the visitors, the local eleven
did remarkably well to hold them to
such a close score.
In the evening the Barbarians were
entertained at a banquet given at the
Inn by the Stanford teams. After
dinner speeches were made by b. .
Williamson and E. Pomorley of the
visitors, while Instructor H. W. Mo
loney and A. D. Fyfe, '13, responded
for Stanford.
