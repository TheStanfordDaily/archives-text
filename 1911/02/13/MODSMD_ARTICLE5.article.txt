# MIDDLE DISTANCE MEN SHOW SPEED IN MEET
## NEW MEN MAKE GOOD MARKS IN POLE VAULT. Big, Improvement is Seen Over Previous Week.—Relay Races are Postponed. 
### 
Middle distance men and pole vault
ers came through in fine style in the
second informal track meet held last
Saturday. A marked improvement was
shown in all events and practically
every mark made the previous week
was shattered by a substantial margin.
Weather conditions were again unfav
orable, and the track was in bad shape
from the heavy rain the night before.
J. 1?. Leaman, '13, and C. C. Taylor,
'11, made the best performances of the
day in the half and quarter respective
ly. Leaman ran a strong 792 in 1:50,
while Taylor's time in the 352 was
caught at 40 4-5 seconds. "Dad" no
longer ' mourns the lack of quarter
men. Both the Varsity and novice
events were run in fast time and were
well contested.
Good pole vaulters were also plenti
ful, the bar being easily cleared by ,J.
A. Miller, '13, at 11 feet, 3 inches, and
by V. G. Stephens, '13, at. 11 feet.
These performances materially in
crease Stanford's prospects for two or
even three places in the pole vault
this year.
Hundred men made their event a
hotly contested one, but a cold, brisk
wind held them to 10 3-5 in both heats.
E. P. Geissler, '14, and F. B. McKee,
'14, took first and second in the Fresh
man race, running neck and neck all
the way. H. Smitherum, '11, won the
second heat.
