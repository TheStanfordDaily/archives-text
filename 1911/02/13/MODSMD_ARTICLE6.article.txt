### 
It' the quality of the oratory dis
played in the Chapel 011 the evening of
Thursday, February 23, is at all In
keeping with the quantity, the shade
of Daniel Webster will surely turn a
rich green from envy, for on that oc
casion at least twenty-one debaters
aro to try out. for positions 011 the
teams which are to meet Oregon and
Wasliigton Universities.
The question for the tryout, which
is the same as that chosen for the
two Intercollegiate contests, is stated
—"Resolved, That the United Statas
government should adopt a system of
ship subsidies." Four speakers and
two alternates are to be selected to
constitute two teams, an affirmative
team to meet Oregon at Stanford on
the evening of the last Saturday in
March, and a negative one to meet
Washington at Seattle on the same
date. It is stated most emphatically,
however, by the members of the Inter
society Debating Committee, which
has the matter in charge, that the side
of the question upheld by a contestant
in the try-out will not in any way
determine the team on which he will
bo placed it" successful. The judges
are to arrange the personnel of the
two teams in the manner which, in
their judgment, will make them the
most evenly balanced and effective.
While the list of those who have
signified their intention of trying out
for tho debate includes the names of
some who are known as Stanford
forensic lights, it is made particularly
interesting and encouraging by its
showing of new material. A number
of the new men have made reputations
as debaters in preparatory school or
in other colleges, but most of them
have not as yet appeared on the
Stanford platform. Friday, the men
who are trying out were met by F. H.
Hilton, '11, who has been the prime
mover in arranging for these new
debates, and after being allowed to
choose the sides on which they wished
to speak, were divided into squads.
The absentees were assigned to sides
by lot. The list as thus arranged
stands as follows:
First squad, affirmative —C. H.
'12, X. D. French, '12. .1. Gibson, C. H.

it.* is expected that numerous others
will add their names to it before the
date of the tryout, as the chance to
win a place 011 the team which will
represent Stanford in the first, debates
of the new Tri-state League, as well as
the possibility of a trip north, are
proving great incentives to devotees of
forensic art. Provision has been made

to accommodate those who desire to
enter the tryout later, and such should
hand their names to F. E. Hill, 'It,
room I">7, Encina, or F. H. Hilton, '11,
R. J. Miller, '11, or W. Tucker, '12, at

entries is sufficient to warrant it, the
tr.vouts will be held on both Thursday
and Friday nights. February 23 and 24.
Each contestant will be allowed a ten

It' the quality of the oratory dis
played in the Chapel 011 the evening of
Thursday, February 23, is at all In
keeping with the quantity, the shade
of Daniel Webster will surely turn a
rich green from envy, for on that oc
casion at least twenty-one debaters
aro to try out. for positions 011 the
teams which are to meet Oregon and
Wasliigton Universities.
The question for the tryout, which
is the same as that chosen for the
two Intercollegiate contests, is stated
—"Resolved, That the United Statas
government should adopt a system of
ship subsidies." Four speakers and
two alternates are to be selected to
constitute two teams, an affirmative
team to meet Oregon at Stanford on
the evening of the last Saturday in
March, and a negative one to meet
Washington at Seattle on the same
date. It is stated most emphatically,
however, by the members of the Inter
society Debating Committee, which
has the matter in charge, that the side
of the question upheld by a contestant
in the try-out will not in any way
determine the team on which he will
bo placed it" successful. The judges
are to arrange the personnel of the
two teams in the manner which, in
their judgment, will make them the
most evenly balanced and effective.
While the list of those who have
signified their intention of trying out
for tho debate includes the names of
some who are known as Stanford
forensic lights, it is made particularly
interesting and encouraging by its
showing of new material. A number
of the new men have made reputations
as debaters in preparatory school or
in other colleges, but most of them
have not as yet appeared on the
Stanford platform. Friday, the men
who are trying out were met by F. H.
Hilton, '11, who has been the prime
mover in arranging for these new
debates, and after being allowed to
choose the sides on which they wished
to speak, were divided into squads.
The absentees were assigned to sides
by lot. The list as thus arranged
stands as follows:
First squad, affirmative —C. H.

it.* is expected that numerous others
will add their names to it before the
date of the tryout, as the chance to
win a place 011 the team which will
represent Stanford in the first, debates
of the new Tri-state League, as well as
the possibility of a trip north, are
proving great incentives to devotees of
forensic art. Provision has been made

to accommodate those who desire to
enter the tryout later, and such should
