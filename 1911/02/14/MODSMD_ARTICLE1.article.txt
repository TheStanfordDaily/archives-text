# WOMEN TO HAVE THEIR OWN BASEBALL DIAMOND
## SUFFRAGE MOVEMENT EXTENDS TO NATIONAL GAME. Interest in the Sport is Great and Inter-Sorority Championship to be Decided. 
### 
Baseball is no longer to be the
divine right of the masculine sex at
Stanford. At the last meeting of the

Women's Athletic
Hoard of Control
of which .Miss Ruth
Sampson, '11, pres
ident, of the Ath
letic Association,
Miss Bertha Van
ami
Dr. Frank Angell
are members, that
body authorized

the construction of a baseball dia
mond for the women of the University.
This diamond will be located between
Roble Gymnasium and the basketball
court, and will be supplemented by a
practice field to be constructed at one
end of the present hockey grounds.
The preparation of these diamonds is
necessitated by the interest which has
been shown in the sport of late by the
women, a number of whom have been
indulging in daily practice and are
now able to stop the speediest "grass
burner" with perfect composure.
The new sport is expected to prove
a most important and beneficial ad
dition to the list of women's athletics.
So great, is the interest being shown in
it that a series of games is now being
arranged between the various sorori
ties, Roble and Madrono. This series
is expected to furnish some colsely
contested games, and the batting and
fielding averages of the players will be
compiled at frequent intervals by the
sporting writers of the Daily Palo Alto.
If this series of games is successful,
baseball will become a permanent
fixture among the women's activities
at Stanford. The supporters of the
game are enthusiastic over its pros
pects, and it is not improbable that
some future women graduate will
point with a glow of pride to her name
in the Quad as first, basewoman on the
Madrono pennant winning nine.
The Hoard of Control at its recent
meeting also gave consent to the con
struction of a drain upon the athletic
field, the resanding and levelling of
the Tennis and Basketball courts, and
the planting of trees and vines about
the grounds.
The minutes of the Board of Con
trol meeting follow:
