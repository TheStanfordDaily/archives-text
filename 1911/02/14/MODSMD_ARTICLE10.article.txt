# A 						Significant Assembly
## 
### 
The initial Assembly of the semester
to be held tomorrow will be one of
great significance. It will mark the

inauguration of the
Raymond P. West
Memorial Lectures on
Immortality, Human

Conduct and Human Destiny, the
first lectureship foundation in Stan
ford and one of the first endowments
to the University outside of those of
its Founders. A large attendance to
morrow will show our benefactors
that the Student Body appreciates
their geneiosity and that it subscribe;-;
to any program of the older friends
of the University which tends to its
upbuilding. The strength of any in
stitution is largely measured by the
expressed regard of those who have
been or are closely related to it, and
the West Memorial Foundation is one
of the most genuine of these early
expressions. This, together with H.
C. Hoover's donation to the Stanford
Union, we hope will be the first of a
series of gifts making for a greater
Stanford.
We realize that Stanford is yet a
young institution and that few of its
pioneer graduates are in a position to
repay their Alma Mater the great
debt they owe her. With the continued
growth of the institution, however,
the alumni should give a tangible ex
pression of their gratitude and sense
of indebtedness. The future progress
of the University depends largely on
the attitude its graduates take toward
it. The ideal should be to give back
as much as is given out. Stanford
does not exist for a selfish purpose,
and a Stanford education is not ac
quired for a selfish purpose. We
should be so unselfish as to desire to
build ui) here at this outpost of the
westward march of civilization, the
world's greatest university. The West
is yet an undeveloped region of match
less possibilities and Stanford is at
the gateway to the civilizations of both
the Occident and Orient.
In this ideal light, the significance of
the West Lectureship can be especially
appreciated, and we again urge a large
attendance. In consideration of the
nature of the meeting and of the pro
found question to be discussed, the

assemblage should be a dignified oiu
and the usual methods of expressin
our spirited approval should not b
employed.
