Through a misunderstanding, the
Daily Palo Alto of last evening pub
lished the location for the proposed
baseball diamond as east of the aux
iliary football field. This site is the
one chosen for a new auxiliary ath
letic field to be used for general col
lege sports and not for Intercollegiate
athletics.
The proposition which the Hoard of
Control has submitted to the Board
of Trustees is that the new diamond be
built where the present auxiliary dia
mond is located. This field was leveled
off for the purpose of encouraging all
forms of sport in college with tlie
agreement that it should not lie used
for Intercollegiate contests. The
Hoard of Control desires to construct
a new field for this purpose, and to
build the big baseball diamond im
mediately adjoining the turf field.
