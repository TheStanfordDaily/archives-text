### 
"Covet earnestly the best gifts; and
yet show 1 unto you a more excellent
way," 1 Corinthians 12:31, was tho
text of Dr. D. Charles Gardner's ser
mon Sunday morning, in which he
emphasized the limitations of modern
civilization. His talk was in the na
ture of a warning to college students
soon to assume their share of the
world's work, saying "the world will
claim you, body, mind, and soul, unless
you learn here to be free, to be mas
ters of your fates."
Dr. Gardner summarized two im
portant defects. In the first place he
said that civilization by itself does not
depelop the highest type of character;
its product, the modern business man
being imbued with worldiness rather
than spirituality. More fundamental
in character was the second limitation,
the fact that civilization treats us as
citizens of the world, and is not con
cerned with the hereafter, a question
which comes sooner or later to be
vital to every man. In this connection
Dr. Gardner dwelt upon the Stanford
ideal, as embodied in the character and
exemplified by our President, of de
veloping the spiritual as well as the
intellectual and physical life of the
students. He also called the attention
of his audience to the inauguration of
the West Memorial Lectures, which are
to deal with the basic spiritual truths
of human destiny and immortality.
