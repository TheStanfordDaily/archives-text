dent, E. J. Brady, who registers from
the now famous city of Squabble Hol
low, Colo.; vice-president, F. Stolle, of
Palo Alto; treasurer, C. X. Leach, of
Burlington, Vermont, and secretary,
R. W. Marbaugh of Palo Alto. To A.
L. Hauswirth-Munger falls the onerous
position of acting as the Student Body.
This was made necessary by the fact
that the class decided to have but four
officers. Naturally with five members
one had to be left out. It was an
unfortunate affair, but Mr. Hauswirth-
Munger can now wield the franchise
untramelled by any influence outside
his own convictions.
