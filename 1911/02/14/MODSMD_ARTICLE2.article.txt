over to the University to be held in
trust, the income therefrom to be used
in securing the lecturer, and publish
ing his manuscript.
Further terms of the grant are set

year, or on each alternate year, at the
discretion of the Board of Trustees,

'Immortality, Human Conduct, and
Human Destiny.'
"Such lectures shall not form a part
of the usual college or University
course, nor shall they be delivered by
any instructor or professor in active
service in the institution. Such lec
turer may lie a clergyman or a layman,
a member of any ecclesiastical organ

| ization, or of none, but he should be a
man of the highest personal character
and of superior intellectual endow
