# VALUABLE BOOKS LEFT TO LANE LIBRARY.
## 
### 
Shortly before his death. Dr. Gus
tavus Simmons, father of S. E. Sim
mons, '95, bequeathed to the Lane Li
brary of Stanford his private library
of 1,000 volumes dealing with medi
cine. Dr. Simmons was a graduate
of the Harvard Medical college at Bos
ton, Mass., and a California pioneer in
the practice of medicine. He was ac
tive in the profession in Sacramento
for 50 years and was one of the most
widely known of coast physicians.
"Doctor Simmons' library is espec
ially valuable as it is made up largely
of sets of the early editions of medi
cal publications in the state," said Dr.
R. L. Wilbur, executive head of the
medical department of the University,
in speaking of the bequest. "These
publications and pamphlets form im
portant histories of the development
of the,profession in the state, as they
date back to the very earliest days.
"The presentation of these valuable
works and records, which were col
lected by Doctor Simmons personally,
is a bequest, that cannot be esteemed
too highly. Such gifts are rare."
