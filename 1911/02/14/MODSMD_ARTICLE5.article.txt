# "Bawl-out" Out.
## 
### 
The new Directory of officers and
students, more familiarly known as
the "bawl-out," made its appearance
today and is on sale at the Business
office at the usual price of fiftee i
cents. A directory of the campus tele
phones is included in the new book,
and will add much to its usefulness.
Otherwise the book is much the same
as the last, even as far as the hours
accredited to many of the students.
