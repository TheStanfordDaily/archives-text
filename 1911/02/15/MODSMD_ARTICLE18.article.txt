# Matthews Has Sprained Ankle.
## 
### 
An X-ray examination proves that
the injury to J. H. Matthews, '13, in
yesterday evening's baseball practice
is a sprained ankle rather than a
broken leg. He will be permitted to
leave the hospital before the end of
the week. Matthews was injured
while playing with the Sophomore
nine against the Belmont team. The
latter aggregation coached by W. C.
Theile, '08, defeated the Sophomores.
