# BURBANK RESIGNS FROM INTERSCHOLASTIC BOARD.
## Schaupp Resigns the Secretaryship. Nunan Succeeds to Vacancy and Office. 
### 
Two resignations, those of D. W.
Rurbank, '09, as a member and K. L.
Schaupp, '12, as secretary, were re
gretfully accepted by the Hoard of
Governors of the Interscholastic
Track Meet at their meeting last even
ing. C. R. Nunan, '12, was elected to
the board, vice Rurbank, and appoint
ed as the new secretary.
A discussion as to the most favor
able time for the meet in consideration
of the rival one to be held at Cali
fornia, resulted in a decision to inform
the representatives from across the
bay that the date previously set for
the Stanford meet cannot be changed.
The necessity of attracting the at
tention and arousing the interest of
the preparatory schools in the coming
meet was dwelt upon at some length.
It was determined to urge Stanford
students to send letters to friends at
the high schools and academies from
which they graduated, calling atten
tion to the meet. A committee was
appointed to have charge of this mat
ter, consisting of K. F. Lee, '12, T. L.
Coleman, '12, and E. F. Kern, '13.
