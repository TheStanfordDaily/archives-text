# FIRST OF MEMORIAL LECTURES CREATES PROFOUND IMPRESSION
## Rev. C.E. Jefferson, as West Foundation Lecturer, Speaks to Immense Audience in Assembly Hall. 
### 
lii a wonderfully eloquent address
before a University Assembly today,
the Rev. Charles E. Jefferson present
ed, as the first of the West Memorial
lectures, a discussion of the "Reasons
for a Restudy of Human Destiny."
This is to be followed tonight by the
second lecture of the series, his sub
ject being "The Argument Against
Immortality," and tomorrow night by
the final address, which will be a
consideration of "The Argument for
Immortality."
Dr. Jefferson opened his address by
statement that a superficial survey
seems to indicate that men in the
twentieth century are not especially
interested in a consideration of life
beyond death, some saying that such
a problem belongs to God alone, some
holding to the tenet of "one world at
a time," some being too timid to ap
proach the subject, some claiming that
it is a religious dogma, some stating
that such an inspiration is unneces
sary to a strong man, others being
prejudiced against a speculation which
carries them into the realm of the
mystic, and st.ill others believing all
such contemplation to be useless.
Forced, to Face the Problem
But despite the attempts of men to
evade the problem, the speaker
brougth out that the great company of
the dying brings men face to face with
the question: "If a man die shall he
live again." "The bruised and crush
ed, defeated and desolate, finding all
avenues on the earth blocked, learn
to contemplate regions unseen.'
Not only the sorrowing, however,
are brought to thoughts of Immortal
ity, but philosophy and poetry, ac
cording to Dr. Jefferson, have always
been t'ascinatinated by it, and science,
finding man to be the most puzzling
and the most promising of all crea
tures, is not content to investigate
only his life upon the earth.
"The passion of love," the speaker
continued, "gives insight into the
world unseen. It. is the nature of love
to look beyond the horizons of time.
"The question of Immortality is a
human question. It belongs to the
scholar and also to the man of the
street. Kings and peasants alike pon
der it. It beckoned to us when we
were children, it will haunt us when
we are old. Philosophers and theo
logians discourse about it, and unlet
tered and humble folk feel more than
they are able to express.'
New Arguments Necessary
Dr. Jefferson pointed out that the
statement has often been made, that
the arguments for and against the
soul's future are ever the same, and
it is claimed that naught can be gained
by going over the ground again. He
cause we are living in a growing
world the argument for immortality
is ever changing, was the answer
given. The speaker continued:
"The argument Socrates recorded in

the Phaedo will not satisfy the minds
of men living now. To have living
force it must spring from the life of
the age which is to be mastered by it.
The argument for Immortality is like
a book of science. It cannot be writ
ten once for all. Scarcely is the ink
dry when a new discovery is made
and certain portions of it must be
recasc.
"Humanity like a river, is ever flow
ing, and men are carried down the
moving stream. The view point is
ever shifting. It is the task of our
generation to adjust itself to a new
mental world and men are determined
as never before to know the truth."
Where i> the Solution Found I
Dr. Jefferson then took up the ques
tion of where the answer to the prob
lem is to be found. The laboratory,
the library, the mounds of buried
cities and the manuscripts of ancient
sages fail to yield a solution to the
world-old problem. The answer, ac
cording to the speaker's ideas, might
not be found by one man for all, but
must be obtained by every man put
ting forth his own powers for him
self.
The speaker declared that there is
one man more reprehensible than the
bigots who dogmatically proclaim
either immortality or annihilation,
that man being one who has never
taken the trouble to arrive at any
conviction whatever. He scored this
attitude as an "evidence of mental
weakness if not of moral cowardice.
The timidity which fears to peer into
the problem lest the basis of man's
hope be found to be sand, is a moral
collapse and a scandal. To prefer a
delusion which pleases, to a truth
which makes sad is the deepest and
blackest of all skepticisms."
A l'rize to be Won
As a bird can exist without wings,
so a man can exist without a belief in
Immortality, according to Dr. Jeffer
son, but like that bird he will be
crippled. The vast benefits to be de
rived from such an inspiration were
given full consideration in the con
clusion of the address, but such a be
lief, he says, is not a trifle won in
life's great lottery.
"It is something earned by effort,
fought for with courage and won by
struggle, maintained in the teeth of
opposition by the intrepid endurance
of an upquailing spirit, and to be
banded 011 as a rich legacy to others
who are also summoned to fight the
same battle, and whom it. is our privi
lege to help win the crown."

so a man can exist without a belief in
Immortality, according to Dr. Jeffer
son, but like that bird he will be
crippled. The vast benefits to be de
rived from such an inspiration were
given full consideration in the con
clusion of the address, but such a be
lief, he says, is not a trifle won in
life's great lottery.
"It is something earned by effort,
fought for with courage and won by
struggle, maintained in the teeth of
opposition by the intrepid endurance
of an upquailing spirit, and to be
banded 011 as a rich legacy to others
who are also summoned to fight the
same battle, and whom it. is our privi
lege to help win the crown."

lii a wonderfully eloquent address
before a University Assembly today,
the Rev. Charles E. Jefferson present
ed, as the first of the West Memorial
lectures, a discussion of the "Reasons
for a Restudy of Human Destiny."
This is to be followed tonight by the
second lecture of the series, his sub
ject being "The Argument Against
Immortality," and tomorrow night by
the final address, which will be a
consideration of "The Argument for
Immortality."
Dr. Jefferson opened his address by
statement that a superficial survey
seems to indicate that men in the
twentieth century are not especially
interested in a consideration of life
beyond death, some saying that such
a problem belongs to God alone, some
holding to the tenet of "one world at
a time," some being too timid to ap
proach the subject, some claiming that
it is a religious dogma, some stating
that such an inspiration is unneces
sary to a strong man, others being
prejudiced against a speculation which
carries them into the realm of the
mystic, and st.ill others believing all
such contemplation to be useless.
Forced, to Face the Problem
But despite the attempts of men to
evade the problem, the speaker
brougth out that the great company of
the dying brings men face to face with
the question: "If a man die shall he
live again." "The bruised and crush
ed, defeated and desolate, finding all
avenues on the earth blocked, learn
to contemplate regions unseen.'
Not only the sorrowing, however,
are brought to thoughts of Immortal
ity, but philosophy and poetry, ac
cording to Dr. Jefferson, have always
been t'ascinatinated by it, and science,
finding man to be the most puzzling
and the most promising of all crea
tures, is not content to investigate
only his life upon the earth.
"The passion of love," the speaker
continued, "gives insight into the
world unseen. It. is the nature of love
to look beyond the horizons of time.
"The question of Immortality is a
human question. It belongs to the
scholar and also to the man of the
street. Kings and peasants alike pon
der it. It beckoned to us when we
were children, it will haunt us when
we are old. Philosophers and theo
logians discourse about it, and unlet
tered and humble folk feel more than
they are able to express.'
New Arguments Necessary
Dr. Jefferson pointed out that the
statement has often been made, that
the arguments for and against the
soul's future are ever the same, and
it is claimed that naught can be gained
by going over the ground again. He
cause we are living in a growing
world the argument for immortality
is ever changing, was the answer
given. The speaker continued:
"The argument Socrates recorded in

the Phaedo will not satisfy the minds
of men living now. To have living
force it must spring from the life of
the age which is to be mastered by it.
The argument for Immortality is like
a book of science. It cannot be writ
ten once for all. Scarcely is the ink
dry when a new discovery is made
and certain portions of it must be
recasc.
"Humanity like a river, is ever flow
ing, and men are carried down the
moving stream. The view point is
ever shifting. It is the task of our
generation to adjust itself to a new
mental world and men are determined
as never before to know the truth."
Where i> the Solution Found I
Dr. Jefferson then took up the ques
tion of where the answer to the prob
lem is to be found. The laboratory,
the library, the mounds of buried
cities and the manuscripts of ancient
sages fail to yield a solution to the
world-old problem. The answer, ac
cording to the speaker's ideas, might
not be found by one man for all, but
must be obtained by every man put
ting forth his own powers for him
self.
The speaker declared that there is
one man more reprehensible than the
bigots who dogmatically proclaim
either immortality or annihilation,
that man being one who has never
taken the trouble to arrive at any
conviction whatever. He scored this
attitude as an "evidence of mental
weakness if not of moral cowardice.
The timidity which fears to peer into
the problem lest the basis of man's
hope be found to be sand, is a moral
collapse and a scandal. To prefer a
delusion which pleases, to a truth
which makes sad is the deepest and
blackest of all skepticisms."

cording to the speaker's ideas, might
not be found by one man for all, but
must be obtained by every man put
ting forth his own powers for him
self.
The speaker declared that there is
one man more reprehensible than the
bigots who dogmatically proclaim
either immortality or annihilation,
that man being one who has never
taken the trouble to arrive at any
conviction whatever. He scored this
attitude as an "evidence of mental
weakness if not of moral cowardice.
The timidity which fears to peer into
the problem lest the basis of man's
hope be found to be sand, is a moral
collapse and a scandal. To prefer a
delusion which pleases, to a truth
which makes sad is the deepest and
blackest of all skepticisms."
A l'rize to be Won
As a bird can exist without wings,
so a man can exist without a belief in
Immortality, according to Dr. Jeffer
son, but like that bird he will be
crippled. The vast benefits to be de
rived from such an inspiration were
given full consideration in the con
clusion of the address, but such a be
lief, he says, is not a trifle won in
life's great lottery.
"It is something earned by effort,
fought for with courage and won by
struggle, maintained in the teeth of
opposition by the intrepid endurance
of an upquailing spirit, and to be
banded 011 as a rich legacy to others
who are also summoned to fight the
same battle, and whom it. is our privi
lege to help win the crown."
