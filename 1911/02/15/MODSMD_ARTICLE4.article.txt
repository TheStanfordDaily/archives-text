# STANFORD WOMEN PLAN PRE-PANAMA EXPOSITION
## CLEVER ATTRACTION TO BE HELD IN ROBLE GYM. Many Organizations to Join in Scheme to Raise Funds for Women's Club House. 
### 
Under the auspices of Cap and
Gown, elaborate preparations are be
ing made for a "Pre-Panama Exposi-

tion," to lie held in
Roble Gymnasium
on the afternon of
February 22, Wash
ington's Birthday.
It will probably be
more 011 the order
of an old-fashioned
country fair than
San Francis c os 's
coming celebration,
but nevertheless
promises to be a

unique and delightful atraction. All
of the sororities, Roble, Madrono, La
Liana and the Faculty women have
secured floor space, and will be rep
resented by elaborate booths, the con
tents of which are still a close secret.
The general admission fee will be
ten cents, and once inside, tickets can
be obtained for one or two cents that
will give admission to any booth in
the fair. At the entrance to each
booth an announcer will be stationed
to declare the nature of the attractions
within. During the afternon two
different entertainments will be given
by picked college talent, and several
raffles will be held. The dresses to
be worn will add much to the novelty
of the affair as a general invitation
has been extended to all college wo
men to come in any fancy dress cos
tume they may choose to wear.
The scheme of the fair is distinctly
different from anything given on the
campus before and will be sure to
prove a success. The proceeds are
to go to swell the Women's Club
House fund. Announcements of spec
ial features of the "exposition" will
be made in later issues of the Daily.
