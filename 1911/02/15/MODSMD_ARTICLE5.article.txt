## 
### 
The importance of strictly adhering
to the rules governing swimming and
the use of boats on Lagunita was ex
plained to members of the Student
Body by Crew Captain K. L. Schaupp,
'12, and K. L. Dole, '11, this afternoon.
The Hoard of Trustees has sent in
structions that the regulations be en
forced or the use of the lake will be
confined to the crew men, all others
being barred. The proposal was
made that a watchman or life-saver
be stationed at the Lake by the Busi
ness Office and paid by the Student
Body. Some arrangement will be
made so that a man will be in charge
all the time or during certain hours
when the lake may be used.
An eligible list, made up of those
who may use the lake will be posted
at the Boathouse in a few days. The
test given last year must be taken by
all whose names do not appear on this
list and who wish to swim or indulge
in boating. The swimming area will
be marked and all bathing confined
within these limits. The rules apply
to both men and women.
