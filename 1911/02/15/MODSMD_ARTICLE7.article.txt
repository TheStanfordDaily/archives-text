One so indifferent of his destiny as
to have no thot on the Immortality of
the Sonl could not have heard the

Reverend Charles E. Jeffer
son this morning without
desiring to hear the remain
ing lectures of the West

Memorial Foundation. It was a rare
privilege to come under the spell of
his master mind and listen to his
eloquent words on a subject which
has been the most vital concern to all
men in all ages. His ability to state
fundamentals lucidly and plainly is
undoubtedly his most pleasing gift.
This coupled with his faultless dic
tion, his easy presence and his at
tractive delivery makes him an ideal
lecturer for the West Memorial
series.
As Dr. Jefferson pointed out, no one
can resolve the problem of Immortal
ity for another. We must ponder on it
ourselves. In the humdrum of every
day life and in our all-absorbing
attention to the petty round of daily
concerns (even in an intellectual
community) we give too little thot to
things of real importance. Ordinarily
there is too much existence and too
little life.
Such a lecture as delivered this
morning gives one a chance and a de
sire to stop for a moment and take
stock and as Elbert Hubbard says,
"get. in the grandstand and watch
ourselves march past."
