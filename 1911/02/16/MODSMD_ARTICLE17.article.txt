# VARSITY DEMONSTRATES TRIPLE PLAY TO VISITORS
## Ball and Ganong, Assisted by Enderle, Retire Three Men in Single Play. 
### 
A triple out was featured by the
Cardinal players in the seventh in
ning with St. Mary's yesterday after
non. The play took place just as
the Stanford players were seemingly
en route to a balloon ascension, three
Phoenix batsmen filling the bases and
110 outs on the score book for the
team in the field.
Details —Guigni opened the bases to
his team mates when he reached the
initial sack on Mitchell's error. Fitz
simmons walked. Wilkenson hit to
center, scoring Guigni. Ross was
given first for four balls, filling the
bases with no outs. Leonhardt was
next up and grounded to Enderle, who
threw to Ganong, catching Fitzsim
mons sliding home. Ganong then shot
the spheroid to Ball, catching Leon
hardt on the initial sack. Ball com
pleted the triple by a return to Gan
ong, which caught Wilkenson at
tempting to score.
In the last two innings both nines
were shut out in one, two, three order
and the run brought home for St.
Mary's before the triple out in the
seventh, gave the visitors the first
game of the series.
