# ARGUMENTS AGAINST IMMORTALITY CONSIDERED BY LECTURER
## Second of Rev. Jefferson's Addresses on Immortality Heard by Large Audience in Assembly Hall. 
### 
Considering "The Argument Against
Immortality," the Rev. Charles E.
Jefferson presented the second of the
West Memorial lectures in the As
sembly Hall last evening. The com
mittee on Public Exercises had ar
ranged for the speaker to deliver his
address in the University Chapel, but
it was early found that, it would be
wholly inadequate to accommodate
the crowd, so a move was made into
the larger building.
Dr. Jefferson, with the beauty of
language and close adherence to sub
ject which had characterized his for
mer address, took up in logical se
quence the arguments against the life
beyond the grave and gave each a fair,
broad-minded consideration.
The first argument considered was,
that Immortality cannot be proved,
hence science is averse to accepting
it, and hence it can hardly be called
essential. But, on the other hand, it
was shown that if Immortality is only
a hypothesis or postulate, the belief in
the extinction of the soul at death is
also nothing but a postulate or hy
pothesis. The point, therefore, to be
decided is .vliich hypothesis, consid
ered in its entirety, best fits into and
accounts for all the facts.
Appearances Against, Doctrine.
Then, taking up the facts, Dr. Jef
ferson's first statement was that all
appearances are against the belief in
a future life. The body, senses, mind,
and psychical powers, one by one,
decay and disintegrate before our
eyes and "so far as we can see the
soul is only a bundle of powers tied
together by a cord of flesh, the bundle
falling apart as soon as the cord is
loosened or destroyed." "The energies
which make up the soul seem to flow
back into the comsos from which they
came and naught but silence comes
from the dead." "But," the speaker
said, "appearances are often deceiv
ing and science shows that we cannot
always believe our eyes. Therefore,
we must follow reason rather than
our senses."
"It. is impossible," say the oppon
ents of Immortality, "for one to con
ceive of life after death." But the
imgination is not infallible and the
unpicturable is not always untrue.
Until the purposes of the Infinite in
creating a possible Immortality are
known we have no reason to pass a
judgment on its justification.'
Drain and Soul.
"One of the greatest obstacles in the
path of a belief in a future life, ac
cording to Dr. Jefferson, lies in the
argument that physiological psychol
ogy proves thought to be dependent
on the mechanism of the brain. But,
conies the answer, the brain may be
merely an organ through which the
soul works, and scientific research
has never yet proved anything which
overturns the doctrines of a life ever
lasting.
That the idea of Immortality origin
ated through the dreams of primitive
man, is an argument that has often

been advanced, but the validity of a
belief does not depend upon its be
ginning. Chemistry began with al
chemy, astronomy with astrology.
"Science and religion," said the speak
er, "were twins rocked in the same
cradle, and both alike have thrown off
their earlier crudities and supersti
tions in the light of a broader day."
Origin ot" the Idea.
The revolutionary discoveries of
science have made many men feel too
insignificant for Immortality, but, on
the other hand, the horizons of man's
mentality and personality have at the
same time widened wonderfully and he
should not feel too humble to claim
to be the highest creation of the uni
verse.
Again, Dr. Jefferson stated, that the
belief in an existence after death is
said by many to be due to doctrines
inculcated during childhood, the belief
being a sort of artificial "instinct."
In addition to this, many men do not
have such a belief, and, it is claimed,
if man is to live forever, surely he
would have an ineradicable presenti
ment of that tact. The other side of
the case, as presented in last evening's
lecture, is that, as some people are
trained to believe, so some are trained
to disbelieve. As to the absence of
belief in some we should note the
immaturity of mankind and the fre
quent absence of esthetic, intellectual
and moral sense.
May One Lose Immortality!
Along with this argument Dr. Jeff
erson made one of the most significant
statements of his discourse. He said:
"Faculties neglected, become the
prey of the forces of death. Powers
subjected to no strain, atrophy and
disappear. It may be that the organ
of belief, like other organs, is under
the sovereignity of this general law,
and only he who cultivates a belief in
Immortality is granted permission to
retain it. It' a man live as though this
world were all, he must expect the
other world to fade into a shadowy
possibility, and finally into dusky im
possibility."
Belief is I nnecessarj.
The last argument against immor
tality considered was that a belief in
it. is superfluous, and that its stimulus
is detrimental rather than beneficial,
inasmuch as it destroys the disinter
estedness of virtue. "A man," say
such opponents of the doctrine,
"ought to be noble enough to do right
without the promise of a sugar-plum.
The desire for Immortality is only the
shadow of a selfish desire.
"But," the lecturer asked, "if a
desire for life beyond this world is
selfish, is not a desire for a life here
also selfish? Since it is demoralizing
to character to anticipate a future
life, we cannot but conclude that it is
demoralizing to desire life here. Such
we know to be contrary to tact.

"Science and religion," said the speak

their earlier crudities and supersti

Origin ot" the Idea.
The revolutionary discoveries of
science have made many men feel too
insignificant for Immortality, but, on
the other hand, the horizons of man's
mentality and personality have at the
same time widened wonderfully and he
should not feel too humble to claim
to be the highest creation of the uni
verse.
Again, Dr. Jefferson stated, that the
belief in an existence after death is
said by many to be due to doctrines
inculcated during childhood, the belief
being a sort of artificial "instinct."
In addition to this, many men do not
have such a belief, and, it is claimed,
if man is to live forever, surely he
would have an ineradicable presenti
ment of that tact. The other side of
the case, as presented in last evening's
lecture, is that, as some people are
trained to believe, so some are trained
to disbelieve. As to the absence of
belief in some we should note the
immaturity of mankind and the fre
quent absence of esthetic, intellectual
and moral sense.
May One Lose Immortality!
Along with this argument Dr. Jeff
erson made one of the most significant
statements of his discourse. He said:
"Faculties neglected, become the
prey of the forces of death. Powers
subjected to no strain, atrophy and
disappear. It may be that the organ
of belief, like other organs, is under
the sovereignity of this general law,
and only he who cultivates a belief in
Immortality is granted permission to
retain it. It' a man live as though this
world were all, he must expect the
other world to fade into a shadowy
possibility, and finally into dusky im
possibility."
Belief is I nnecessarj.
The last argument against immor
tality considered was that a belief in
it. is superfluous, and that its stimulus
is detrimental rather than beneficial,
inasmuch as it destroys the disinter
estedness of virtue. "A man," say
such opponents of the doctrine,
"ought to be noble enough to do right
without the promise of a sugar-plum.
The desire for Immortality is only the
shadow of a selfish desire.
"But," the lecturer asked, "if a
desire for life beyond this world is
selfish, is not a desire for a life here
also selfish? Since it is demoralizing
to character to anticipate a future
life, we cannot but conclude that it is
demoralizing to desire life here. Such
we know to be contrary to tact.
Dr. Jefferson's final address will be
gfven in the Assembly Hall this even
ing at 8 (.'clock.
Considering "The Argument Against
Immortality," the Rev. Charles E.
Jefferson presented the second of the
West Memorial lectures in the As
sembly Hall last evening. The com
mittee on Public Exercises had ar
ranged for the speaker to deliver his
address in the University Chapel, but
it was early found that, it would be
wholly inadequate to accommodate
the crowd, so a move was made into
the larger building.
Dr. Jefferson, with the beauty of
language and close adherence to sub
ject which had characterized his for
mer address, took up in logical se
quence the arguments against the life
beyond the grave and gave each a fair,
broad-minded consideration.
The first argument considered was,
that Immortality cannot be proved,
hence science is averse to accepting
it, and hence it can hardly be called
essential. But, on the other hand, it
was shown that if Immortality is only
a hypothesis or postulate, the belief in
the extinction of the soul at death is
also nothing but a postulate or hy
pothesis. The point, therefore, to be
decided is .vliich hypothesis, consid
ered in its entirety, best fits into and
accounts for all the facts.
Appearances Against, Doctrine.
Then, taking up the facts, Dr. Jef
ferson's first statement was that all
appearances are against the belief in
a future life. The body, senses, mind,
and psychical powers, one by one,
decay and disintegrate before our
eyes and "so far as we can see the
soul is only a bundle of powers tied
together by a cord of flesh, the bundle
falling apart as soon as the cord is
loosened or destroyed." "The energies
which make up the soul seem to flow
back into the comsos from which they
came and naught but silence comes
from the dead." "But," the speaker
said, "appearances are often deceiv
ing and science shows that we cannot
always believe our eyes. Therefore,
we must follow reason rather than
our senses."
"It. is impossible," say the oppon
ents of Immortality, "for one to con
ceive of life after death." But the
imgination is not infallible and the
unpicturable is not always untrue.
Until the purposes of the Infinite in
creating a possible Immortality are
known we have no reason to pass a
judgment on its justification.'
Drain and Soul.
"One of the greatest obstacles in the
path of a belief in a future life, ac
cording to Dr. Jefferson, lies in the
argument that physiological psychol
ogy proves thought to be dependent
on the mechanism of the brain. But,
conies the answer, the brain may be
merely an organ through which the
soul works, and scientific research
has never yet proved anything which
overturns the doctrines of a life ever
lasting.

ated through the dreams of primitive
man, is an argument that has often

ranged for the speaker to deliver his
address in the University Chapel, but
it was early found that, it would be
wholly inadequate to accommodate
the crowd, so a move was made into
the larger building.
Dr. Jefferson, with the beauty of
language and close adherence to sub
ject which had characterized his for
mer address, took up in logical se
quence the arguments against the life
beyond the grave and gave each a fair,
broad-minded consideration.
The first argument considered was,
that Immortality cannot be proved,
hence science is averse to accepting
it, and hence it can hardly be called
essential. But, on the other hand, it
was shown that if Immortality is only
a hypothesis or postulate, the belief in
the extinction of the soul at death is
also nothing but a postulate or hy
pothesis. The point, therefore, to be
decided is .vliich hypothesis, consid
ered in its entirety, best fits into and
accounts for all the facts.
Appearances Against, Doctrine.
Then, taking up the facts, Dr. Jef
ferson's first statement was that all
appearances are against the belief in
a future life. The body, senses, mind,
and psychical powers, one by one,
decay and disintegrate before our
eyes and "so far as we can see the
soul is only a bundle of powers tied
together by a cord of flesh, the bundle
falling apart as soon as the cord is
loosened or destroyed." "The energies
which make up the soul seem to flow
back into the comsos from which they
came and naught but silence comes
from the dead." "But," the speaker
said, "appearances are often deceiv
ing and science shows that we cannot
always believe our eyes. Therefore,
we must follow reason rather than
our senses."
"It. is impossible," say the oppon
ents of Immortality, "for one to con
ceive of life after death." But the
imgination is not infallible and the
unpicturable is not always untrue.
Until the purposes of the Infinite in
creating a possible Immortality are
known we have no reason to pass a
judgment on its justification.'
Drain and Soul.
"One of the greatest obstacles in the
path of a belief in a future life, ac
cording to Dr. Jefferson, lies in the
argument that physiological psychol
ogy proves thought to be dependent
on the mechanism of the brain. But,
conies the answer, the brain may be
merely an organ through which the
soul works, and scientific research
has never yet proved anything which
overturns the doctrines of a life ever
lasting.
That the idea of Immortality origin
ated through the dreams of primitive
man, is an argument that has often

been advanced, but the validity of a
belief does not depend upon its be
ginning. Chemistry began with al
chemy, astronomy with astrology.
"Science and religion," said the speak
er, "were twins rocked in the same
cradle, and both alike have thrown off
their earlier crudities and supersti
tions in the light of a broader day."
Origin ot" the Idea.
The revolutionary discoveries of
science have made many men feel too
insignificant for Immortality, but, on
the other hand, the horizons of man's
mentality and personality have at the
same time widened wonderfully and he
should not feel too humble to claim
to be the highest creation of the uni
verse.
Again, Dr. Jefferson stated, that the
belief in an existence after death is
said by many to be due to doctrines
inculcated during childhood, the belief
being a sort of artificial "instinct."
In addition to this, many men do not
have such a belief, and, it is claimed,
if man is to live forever, surely he
would have an ineradicable presenti
ment of that tact. The other side of
the case, as presented in last evening's
lecture, is that, as some people are
trained to believe, so some are trained
to disbelieve. As to the absence of
belief in some we should note the
immaturity of mankind and the fre
quent absence of esthetic, intellectual
and moral sense.
May One Lose Immortality!
Along with this argument Dr. Jeff
erson made one of the most significant
statements of his discourse. He said:
"Faculties neglected, become the
prey of the forces of death. Powers
subjected to no strain, atrophy and
disappear. It may be that the organ
of belief, like other organs, is under
the sovereignity of this general law,
and only he who cultivates a belief in
Immortality is granted permission to
retain it. It' a man live as though this
world were all, he must expect the
other world to fade into a shadowy
possibility, and finally into dusky im
possibility."
Belief is I nnecessarj.
The last argument against immor
tality considered was that a belief in
it. is superfluous, and that its stimulus
is detrimental rather than beneficial,
inasmuch as it destroys the disinter
estedness of virtue. "A man," say
such opponents of the doctrine,
"ought to be noble enough to do right
without the promise of a sugar-plum.
The desire for Immortality is only the
shadow of a selfish desire.
"But," the lecturer asked, "if a
desire for life beyond this world is
selfish, is not a desire for a life here
also selfish? Since it is demoralizing
to character to anticipate a future
life, we cannot but conclude that it is
demoralizing to desire life here. Such
we know to be contrary to tact.
Dr. Jefferson's final address will be
gfven in the Assembly Hall this even
ing at 8 (.'clock.
