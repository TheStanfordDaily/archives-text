The majority of the faculty were
conspicuous by their absence at the
second of the West Memorial Lectures

yesterday evening. This is
a surprising fact. If it is
true, as many of our pro
fessors claim, that students

are so entangled in the web of ephe
mereal activities, that they have no
time for the essentials of a college
education, so it would seem that our
faculty friends are so involved in the
intricacies of mundane research and
temporary dispensation of transitory
wisdom, that they have 110 time for a
consideration of the real essentials of
life. Or possibly we are mistaken.
The faculty may be so content with
the immortality of their work, that
they have little personal concern.
Unselfishness is a beautiful virtue!
However, as Dr. Jefferson says. Im
mortality is ti subject for kings and
peasants to ponder 011. Somewhere
between these two poles dwell people
of brains.
In passing it might also be men
tioned, that preparation for today's
and tomorrow's examinations kept
away many who desired to go. An
ideal system would afford students the
opportunity to get the most good out
of their time. Dr. Jefferson's discourse
011 the fundamentals of human con
duct and destiny is far more valuable
than enforced study for tests of
knowledge, which are of momentary
importance at the best.
