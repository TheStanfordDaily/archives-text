# COLLEGE STELLARS ARE TO MEET VARSITY NINE
## FORMER COLLEGIANS PLAY CARDINAL TOMORROW. Presley and Thiele to Form Visitors Battery. — Admission will be Twenty-five Cents. 
### 
One of the strongest aggregations
that will visit the campus this season,
the All-Star College nine, will cross
hats with the Varsity tomorrow after
noon on the Turf Diamond at 2:30
o'clock.
The group of former college stars
have been playing together for the
past two summers and form a strong

bat and sack unit. Thiele and Presley
will form the visitor's battery. Elrod,
a recent Drown star, will play the in
itial sack. Mull, of the Olympic or
ganization, will hold down the key
stone and Byrnes, formerly a George
town sackman and more recently an
American Association player, will
play the intricate corner. Peters at
short completes the infield. The gar
den will be filled by Hamilton, of Cal
ifornia, De Lisle of Pennsylvania and
Sales of Stanford.
I). D. Sales. '06, was a Varsity pitch
er for two years and was graduate
manager for two years following his
graduation. Thiele, Presley and Peters
complete the Stanford quartet division
of the constellation and need no word
of introduction to the Cardinal fans.
It has been sometime since Thiele has
been seen on the mound with Presley
receiving bis curves and a record
breaking crowd will undoubtedly fill
the bleachers tomorrow afternon to
see the Presley-Thiele duet.
Gilfillan will open from the box for
the Varsity with Achi catching. En
derle will be given a rest tomorrow.
The remainder of the Cardinal lineup
will lie the same as that which made
such a splendid showing against St.
Mary's last Wednesday.

Ganong, catcher; Ball, first base:
Cass, second base; Mitchell, third
base; Terry, short-stop; Donavan,
