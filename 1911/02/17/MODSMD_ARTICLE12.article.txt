# FRESHMEN SET APRIL 7 AS DATE FOR JOLLY UP.
## Committee Devising Plans to Get First Year Students Better Acquainted. 
### 
The Freshman jolly-up will be held
the night of April 7 in the Armory.
The jolly-up committee, of which
Floyd W. Cowan, '14, is chairman,
and to which has been delegated the
power to select the date for the af
fair. authorized this statement to
day. The decision of the class to hold
ths jolly-up after track season left
few dates at lhe disposal o fthe com
mittee that did not conflict with other
festivals.
Criticism of past jolly-ups held by
the different classes has stirred the
committee to devise new and novel
stunts iu get-acquainted features f< r
the occasion. The committee is labor
ing to the end that not only every
member of the class may have an op
portunity to meet every other member,
but to so arrange the program that it
will be practically impossible for a
member to leave the hall until he has
met all the others.
As usual, the order that "queening"
is to be a lost art on the occasion of
the jolly-up has gone forth
