# JEFFERSON'S FINAL ADDRESS DEEPLY IMPRESSES HUNDREDS
## 
### 
Science, philosophy and history were
all called upon to contribute their
quota to the argument for the life be
yond death in the final address of the
Rev. Charles E. Jefferson, delivered
last evening in the Assembly Hall.
This, the last of the Raymond F. West
Memorial Lectures, concludes the first
series under the Foundation.
In opening his discussion of the
subject the speaker declared that
science cannot treat with authority
the problem of Immortality, since its
field is necessarily limited to experi
ence and observation of the world in
which matter plays a part. Yet there
are things taught by science which
have a tendency to influence the mind
in favor of life everlasting.
Conservation of Energy.
The theory of the conservation of
energy is one of the most firmly es
tablished of modern scientific doc
trines. This affirms that energy and
matter are indestructible. Personal
ity and the human will, are forms of
energy, according to the lecturer, and
he therefore logically concludes that
"it may be that this highest of all
forces of energy with which we are
acquainted also belongs to the cate
gory of realities which will abide
forever."
Evolution was next taken up. This
scientific principle, tracing man from
an ignominious origin to his present
predominant position in the world,
Dr. Jefferson thought to be extremely
significant. Ho said:
"Science has lifted us to a nobler
temper. The vision of the vast sweep
of upward moving life, predisposes
the mind to hospitality toward the
very largest conceptions of man's mis
sion and destiny."
Proof of I'biqnity.
"Our generation," said Dr. Jeffer
son. in taking up a somewhat new line
of thought, "has been trained by its
scientific teachers to allow large sig
nificance to phenomena which are
übiquitous and persistent. Nothing,
science declares, can be permanent
which is not an essential part of the
great world order." Then with the
Paleontologist the speaker harked
back to the beginning of history and
followed it through to the present age,
showing that always, in one form or
another, the belief in immortality
existed.
"Hints of personality extending far
beyond the realm of consciousness
have been revealed by science. These
indications that the soul possesses
powers which cannot find expression
in the molecular action of the brain,
makes us more reluctant to believe
that the material life is all."
i'liilosopliic Evidence.
Then, turning to philosophy, the
speaker said that we find a wider
field, not confined to the happenings
in the earth and sky, but devoted as
well to the realm of the human heart.
In addition to man's thoughts, opin
ions and ideas, it was brought out, he
also has "attractions and repulsions,
instincts and intuitions, passions and

emotions, aspirations and eradicable
hungerings."
"The normal heart," the speaker
continued, "takes kindly to the thought
of life beyond the grave. The thought
of annihilation on the other hand
brings to the fresh and unspoiled
heart a chill and gloom.
"Philosophy finds the world an un
solvable enigma without the existence
of Immorality. Without it life is a
failure and the ethical sense has no
foundation."
Science and Religion.
The parallelism of science and re
ligion were set forth by Dr. Jefferson
av, follows:
"The man of science no less than
the man of religion, is obliged to walk
by faith. Science cannot take her
first step without a splendid act of
faith. She must assume that the
universe is intelligible and that her
processes can lie known. The man of
science is sworn to be true to the
facts and so is the man of religion.
The facts of consciousness are as
sacred and solid as any which can be
shaken out of test tube and crucibles.
Science believes in experiment and so
does religion. It is by her experience
that religion retains her power and
her conquests."
The speaker stated that just as
there have been great geniuses in
poetry, music and invention, so there
have been great spiritual geniuses.
These, the great leaders of the na
tions, have all anticipated the coming
of a prophet who should see what
was lifdden from them.
Christ's Teaching.
"In the fullness of time," Dr. Jeffer
son continued, "such a prophet came
—Jesus of Nazareth. Christians see
in him the fulfillment of all the
dreams of patriarchs, kings and
prophets, and acknowledge him to lie
the Son of God, the Savior of the
world. His name is written above
every name. He saw more deeply
into life than any man who preceded
him or who has come after him. What
he says, therefore, on the destiny of
man is worthy of reverent attention."
Judge Doctrines by Fruits.
But finally, Dr. Jefferson said: "The
doctrine of Annihilation and the doc
trine of Immortality are both plausi
ble. The only thing to do is to note
the effect of both doctrines on the
lives of those who accept them. We
must observe their fruits in the long
run. We must measure its influence
on the general tone of feeling and on
the trend of communal action. Thus
studied is there room for dispute, that
the belief in Immortality elevates and
purifies, invigorates and brightens,
while the belief in extinction depress
es and weakens, making victorious
life more difficult, and sweeping much
of the sunlight from the sky."
Dr. Jefferson closed one of the most
impressive addresses ever given at
Stanford by presenting, as an escape
from skepticism, the injunction. "Set
your mind on the things that are
above, not on the things that are upon
the earth."

"In the fullness of time," Dr. Jeffer
son continued, "such a prophet came
—Jesus of Nazareth. Christians see
in him the fulfillment of all the
dreams of patriarchs, kings and
prophets, and acknowledge him to lie
the Son of God, the Savior of the
world. His name is written above
every name. He saw more deeply
into life than any man who preceded
him or who has come after him. What
he says, therefore, on the destiny of
man is worthy of reverent attention."

But finally, Dr. Jefferson said: "The
doctrine of Annihilation and the doc
trine of Immortality are both plausi
ble. The only thing to do is to note
the effect of both doctrines on the
lives of those who accept them. We
must observe their fruits in the long
run. We must measure its influence
on the general tone of feeling and on
the trend of communal action. Thus
studied is there room for dispute, that
the belief in Immortality elevates and
purifies, invigorates and brightens,
while the belief in extinction depress
es and weakens, making victorious
life more difficult, and sweeping much
of the sunlight from the sky."
Dr. Jefferson closed one of the most
impressive addresses ever given at
Stanford by presenting, as an escape
from skepticism, the injunction. "Set
your mind on the things that are
above, not on the things that are upon
the earth."
Science, philosophy and history were
all called upon to contribute their
quota to the argument for the life be
yond death in the final address of the
Rev. Charles E. Jefferson, delivered
last evening in the Assembly Hall.
This, the last of the Raymond F. West
Memorial Lectures, concludes the first
series under the Foundation.
In opening his discussion of the
subject the speaker declared that
science cannot treat with authority
the problem of Immortality, since its
field is necessarily limited to experi
ence and observation of the world in
which matter plays a part. Yet there
are things taught by science which
have a tendency to influence the mind
in favor of life everlasting.
Conservation of Energy.
The theory of the conservation of
energy is one of the most firmly es
tablished of modern scientific doc
trines. This affirms that energy and
matter are indestructible. Personal
ity and the human will, are forms of
energy, according to the lecturer, and
he therefore logically concludes that
"it may be that this highest of all
forces of energy with which we are
acquainted also belongs to the cate
gory of realities which will abide
forever."
Evolution was next taken up. This
scientific principle, tracing man from
an ignominious origin to his present
predominant position in the world,
Dr. Jefferson thought to be extremely
significant. Ho said:
"Science has lifted us to a nobler
temper. The vision of the vast sweep
of upward moving life, predisposes
the mind to hospitality toward the
very largest conceptions of man's mis
sion and destiny."
Proof of I'biqnity.
"Our generation," said Dr. Jeffer
son. in taking up a somewhat new line
of thought, "has been trained by its
scientific teachers to allow large sig
nificance to phenomena which are
übiquitous and persistent. Nothing,
science declares, can be permanent
which is not an essential part of the
great world order." Then with the
Paleontologist the speaker harked
back to the beginning of history and
followed it through to the present age,
showing that always, in one form or
another, the belief in immortality
existed.
"Hints of personality extending far
beyond the realm of consciousness
have been revealed by science. These
indications that the soul possesses
powers which cannot find expression
in the molecular action of the brain,
makes us more reluctant to believe
that the material life is all."
i'liilosopliic Evidence.
Then, turning to philosophy, the
speaker said that we find a wider
field, not confined to the happenings
in the earth and sky, but devoted as
well to the realm of the human heart.
In addition to man's thoughts, opin
ions and ideas, it was brought out, he
also has "attractions and repulsions,
instincts and intuitions, passions and

emotions, aspirations and eradicable
hungerings."
"The normal heart," the speaker
continued, "takes kindly to the thought
of life beyond the grave. The thought
of annihilation on the other hand
brings to the fresh and unspoiled
heart a chill and gloom.
"Philosophy finds the world an un
solvable enigma without the existence
of Immorality. Without it life is a
failure and the ethical sense has no
foundation."
Science and Religion.
The parallelism of science and re
ligion were set forth by Dr. Jefferson
av, follows:
"The man of science no less than
the man of religion, is obliged to walk
by faith. Science cannot take her
first step without a splendid act of
faith. She must assume that the
universe is intelligible and that her
processes can lie known. The man of
science is sworn to be true to the
facts and so is the man of religion.
The facts of consciousness are as
sacred and solid as any which can be
shaken out of test tube and crucibles.
Science believes in experiment and so
does religion. It is by her experience
that religion retains her power and
her conquests."
The speaker stated that just as
there have been great geniuses in
poetry, music and invention, so there
have been great spiritual geniuses.

speaker said that we find a wider
field, not confined to the happenings
in the earth and sky, but devoted as
well to the realm of the human heart.
In addition to man's thoughts, opin
ions and ideas, it was brought out, he
also has "attractions and repulsions,
instincts and intuitions, passions and

emotions, aspirations and eradicable
hungerings."
"The normal heart," the speaker
continued, "takes kindly to the thought
of life beyond the grave. The thought
of annihilation on the other hand
brings to the fresh and unspoiled
heart a chill and gloom.
"Philosophy finds the world an un
solvable enigma without the existence
of Immorality. Without it life is a
failure and the ethical sense has no
foundation."
Science and Religion.
The parallelism of science and re
ligion were set forth by Dr. Jefferson
av, follows:
"The man of science no less than
the man of religion, is obliged to walk
by faith. Science cannot take her
first step without a splendid act of
faith. She must assume that the
universe is intelligible and that her
processes can lie known. The man of
science is sworn to be true to the
facts and so is the man of religion.
The facts of consciousness are as
sacred and solid as any which can be
shaken out of test tube and crucibles.
Science believes in experiment and so
does religion. It is by her experience
that religion retains her power and
her conquests."
The speaker stated that just as
there have been great geniuses in
poetry, music and invention, so there
have been great spiritual geniuses.
These, the great leaders of the na
tions, have all anticipated the coming
of a prophet who should see what
was lifdden from them.
Christ's Teaching.
"In the fullness of time," Dr. Jeffer
son continued, "such a prophet came
—Jesus of Nazareth. Christians see
in him the fulfillment of all the
dreams of patriarchs, kings and
prophets, and acknowledge him to lie
the Son of God, the Savior of the
world. His name is written above
every name. He saw more deeply
into life than any man who preceded
him or who has come after him. What
he says, therefore, on the destiny of
man is worthy of reverent attention."
Judge Doctrines by Fruits.
But finally, Dr. Jefferson said: "The
doctrine of Annihilation and the doc
trine of Immortality are both plausi
ble. The only thing to do is to note
the effect of both doctrines on the
lives of those who accept them. We
must observe their fruits in the long
run. We must measure its influence
on the general tone of feeling and on
the trend of communal action. Thus
studied is there room for dispute, that
the belief in Immortality elevates and
purifies, invigorates and brightens,
while the belief in extinction depress
es and weakens, making victorious
life more difficult, and sweeping much
of the sunlight from the sky."
Dr. Jefferson closed one of the most
impressive addresses ever given at
Stanford by presenting, as an escape
from skepticism, the injunction. "Set
your mind on the things that are
above, not on the things that are upon
the earth."
