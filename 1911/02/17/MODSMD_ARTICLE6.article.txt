# A 						Democratic Faux-pas
## 
### 
To-day brings a request from the
Dean of Women in regard to the
clothes which shall bo worn at Class

jolly-ups. The com
fortable "cords," and
the ever-ready and
indispensable blue

shirt have fallen under the ban of dis
approval. The informality which
makes the jolly-up successful is to be
denied us. Stiff-shirted propriety
must take the place of blue-shirted
comfort. The free, open spirit of our
jolly-ups must be sacrificed on the
altar of custom. The democracy of
Stanford, which sets it apart from all
other Universities is partially threat
ened. And all for the sake of appear
ances. Do clothes make the man?
The Dean of Women we are sure
would reply instantly in the negative.
Then why the ruling?
But the question has quite another
aspect that brands it as absolutely
undemocratic. It will if enforced, or
even heeded, work an undoubted bard
ship on not a few members of the Stu
dent Body. Many are the men who
attend the Class informal affairs, who
have no other opportunity to take part
in the social life of the University.
For them the abolition of the custom
of wearing "cords" and blue flannel
shirts would mean exclusion from the
dance. They have no other clothes.
Surely it is the spirit of these affairs
to set the very men to attend which
such a rule would exclude. If en
forced its effects would be far more
harmful than ten thousand blue shirts
and a mile of cordonroy. It would be
the very quintessence of narrow mind
ed prudery. As it stands, it is quite
foreign to the spirit of the University.
