# BANDSTAND WILL BE BUILT OVER LAGUNITA
## CONCERTS WILL BE GIVEN EVERY SUNDAY. Location Will be Chosen this Week and Construction Begun Immediately, 
### 
The alluring strains of the music of
a military band will be wafted on the
gentle breezes fioating over Lagunita.
This is an assured fact, now that the
Executive Committee of Associated
Students has decided to build a band
stand extending over the waters of the
lake. The stand will be constructed
large enough to accommodate forty
pieces, and will probably be situated
on the cove near the women's boat
house.
The University Hand, which last
year delighted its hearers on the In
ner Quadrangle, plans this semester to
play at the lake every Thursday after
non and to render a program of select
ed pieces every Sunday evening.
The idea is not a new one to the
Student Body, bit permission from the
Hoard of Trustees was received for
the first, time at its last meeting. Im
mediate action was taken and a com
mittee appointed to select a desirable
location.
This committee will choose the site
during the early part of this week and
construction will be begun immediate
ly. At present, the members of this
board have in mind a location on the
lake a short distance from the Wo
men's Boat-house.
The work on the stand will be com
pleted as soon as possible and the
first concert will probably be held dur
ing the early part of next month.
