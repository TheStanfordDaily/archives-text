In having Dr. Jordan speak to the
men of the University in Encina Hall
on Sunday evenings, the Y. M. C. A.
has done some thing eni-
Ciose inently worth while. The
Perspective talk on "Success in Life,'
given yesterday evening
was valuable in more ways than one.
For one thing, it gave us a truer ap
preciation of the real greatness of
Stanford's President. The world
knows what Dr. Jordan can do and
Stanford can know what he is. There
is a lot in knowing Big Men. We are
so close to a number of Big Men at
Stanford that we often fail to see them.
