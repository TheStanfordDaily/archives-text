# BISHOP HUGHES PREACHES ON THE ELECTION OF FAITH.
## Large College Audience Hears Forceful Words from Eloquent Methodist Divine. 
### 
The largest congregation of the year
greeted Bishop Hughes at yesterday
morning's Chapel service, when he
preached a striking sermon on "The
Election of Faith." He chose as his
text, Mark 9:2-1, "Lord, I believe; help
thou mine unbelief," emphasizing the
main point of this prayer as making
use of whatever faith is on hand and,
at the same time, pleading that any
doubts may be helped.
"Our Own Attitude toward Faith and
Doubt," was Bishop Hughes' special
subject. He said that normal people
always have doubts, and that, during
the period of most rapid intellectual
growth, the number was most liable to
multiply.
In presenting his subject, Bishop
Hughes used the figure of suffrage.
In the election of faith he said that
mind was entitled to one vote, and
that no man should be asked to ca.->t
aside the reasonings of his intellect.
However, be showed that in all realms
of life, mind soon reaches its limits,
and that the heart must cast a pure,
uncorrupted vote in the election.
In conclusion, Bishop Hughes said:
"When the mind shall have cast its
vote the heart shall have had its pure
vote, and the will shall have cast the
deciding vote, then shall hands of faith
be lifted up, and the soul shall cry,
'Oh, Lord! My God!'
