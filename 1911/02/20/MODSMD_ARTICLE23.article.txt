# "THE SENATOR" PROMISES TO BE BIG COMEDY HIT
## SOPHOMORE PLAY RAPIDLY IS ROUNDING INTO FINISH. Daily Rehearsals are Held.â€”Coach Mathieu Pleased With Underclass Cast. 
### 
That the Sophomore Play for 1911
will be among the most successful of
second year productions is evident
from the high standard of dramatic
excellence that is already displayed at
the rehearsals of "The Senator" which
is to be given on March 4. At this
time, more than two weks before the
performance, the lines are fast assum
ing the tone of a finished reproduc
tion and the business is running with
more than the customary smoothness.
As a dramtaic vehicle it is doubtful
if the Class could have chosen a better
play than "The Senator." It is a good,
snappy, comedy of the first class, and
it well fitted to the needs of a Sopho
more Class.
The cast has been very happily pick
ed. Coach Mathieu has obtained many
people of undoubted dramatic ability
who have never appeared on a Stan
ford stage. Every part in the entire
cast has een successfully and ade
quately filled. From the lead down to
the voice appearing off stage, the
characters of the play have found ex
pression in the person chosen to de
pict them.
Although essentially a comedy,
"The Senator" is filled with good dra
matic situations. The comedy parts
are uproariously funny, and the fre T
quent but entirely unexpected entran
ces of the Chinese ambassador are
sure to bring many laught from the
audience.
Rehearsals are now held almost
daily. Through the use of the base
ment, under the engineering buildings,
a new scheme of rehearsals has been
made possible which greatly expedites
matters.
The injury of J. H. Matthews on the
baseball diamond last Tuesday, al
though causing considerable incon
venience, will not interfer with his re
hearsing regularly.
