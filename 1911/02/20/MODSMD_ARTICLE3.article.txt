# VARSITY TIES STELLARS IN TWELVE-INNING GAME
## DRAW ENDS LONG BATTLE ON TURF DIAMOND. Cardinals Continue Brilliancy of Play in Saturday's Contest with Former College Stars. 
### 
Twelve hard fought innings on Sat
urday afternoon between the Varsity
and All -Stars ended in a 4-4 drawn
tie. The showing made by the Cardi
nal players was all that could be de
sired and was an unusual proceeding
for such an early season game. This
contest coupled with the Varsity show
ing against the Phoenix last Wednes
day puts the Cardinal ball tossers in
the front rank of the California col
leges.
Theile, while having but five strike
outs registered in his favor, allowed
the Cardinal batters only three hits
and the efficient ball-handling be
tween the sacks by the visitors kept
the locals off the bases far oftener
than would otherwise have been the
case. In five innings the Cardinals
sent the Stellars back to the field in
one, two, three order and in exchange
the All-Stars duplicated in four in
nings.
The visitors proved to be better
stick artists than their opponents and
connected with Gilfillan's curves for
a round dozen hits, although many of
these were bunts and scratch bits.
All of the bingles were marked as
singles with the exception of a throe
bagger driven deep into the left gar
den by Peters in the seventh bringing
De Lisle home from the keystone and
tying the score.
The Cardinals opened the game
with two runs in their half of the first
inning. With two outs, Mitchell and
Hall walked. Achi then hit to right
for a single, bringing Mitchell home,
Cass following suit on an overthrow
from the field. The last two Cardinal
additions to the score were made in the
sixth by Mitchell and Hall, opportune
ly assisted by hits and errors.
Timely hits scored Gay and Elrod in
the fourth and similarly brought
Theile home in the next, inning. Pet
er's three-bager in the seventh scored
De Lisle.
Gilfillan pitched for ten innings and
was then relieved by Halm. Theile
played the mound position thruout the
afternoon's work.
