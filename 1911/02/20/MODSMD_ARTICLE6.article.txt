# ATHLETES COME THROUGH WITH WARMER WEATHER
## BIG IMPROVEMENT SHOWN IN THIRD INFORMAL MEET. Boalware and Miller Spring Surprise in Pole Vault.—Hundred is Run in Fast Time. 
### 
Only the most pessimestic will fail
to concede that Stanford's track pros
pects are exceedingly bright after the
performances of last Saturday. A well
balanced Varsity is assured, but the
strength of the Freshman squad is so
far centered around the work of a few
star men.
The big surprise of the day came
in the pole vault, and from present in
dications it looks as tho the squad will
be able to boast of three twelve foot
men by the end of the season. C. L.
1 tou 1 ware, '14, who only captured third
at 10 feet, 5 inches the previous week,
showed remarkable improvement by
clearing the bar at 11 feet, 11 inches.
He was tied for first place at this
height by .1. A. Miller, '13, Captain
llellah not being in the competition.
Following closely behind them, were
C. A. Waring, '11, and V. G. Stevens,
'13, who tied for third place at 11 feet,
7 inches.
H, Smitherum, '11, showed that he
could come back by taking the hun
dred in 10 2-5 seconds. The Freshman
race was won in equally fast time by
F. B. McKee, '14.
After running a close second to
Smitherum in the hundred, T. L. Cole
man, '12, turned the tables and easily
annexed the furlong in 22 3-5 seconds.
The marks made in the broad and
high jumps were well up to expecta
tions. H. Morrison, '13, won the leap
for distance at 21 feet, 2/ 2 inches,
while G. L. -Horine, '13, took first in
the high at 6 feet.
The least promising showing of the
meet was made in the hurdles and the
two mile, due especially to the very
few men entered. Only two men, J.
E. Shelton, '10, and C. R. Swanson, '14,
finished their race in the long distance
run.
Several fast laps were run in the
relay, which developed a very close
finish. Taylor and Campbell fought
the last 220 all the way round. Taylor
breasting the tape about three yards
in the lead.
Following are the results of the
events.
