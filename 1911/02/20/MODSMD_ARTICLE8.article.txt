# Mysterious Sign Arouses Interest.
## 
### 
Considerable curiosity has been
aroused by the large sign bearing the
mystical inscription, "Will Yon Rr
There?" which was bung some time
last, evening across the street by the
car tracks. What, the advertisement,
refers to, is not known at the present
writing. Many, however, suspect that
the directors of the Pre-Panama ex
position which is to be held on the
afternoon of Washington's Birthday,
are responsible for it. At the tifue of
going to press none of those interested
in the exposition could be found
around the campus, so the report
could not be verified.
