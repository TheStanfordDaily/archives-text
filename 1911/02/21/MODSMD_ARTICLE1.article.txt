# CARDINAL PLAYERS WILL JOURNEY TO OAKLAND
## TO MEET CRACK ST. MARY'S TEAM TOMORROW AFTERNOON. Second Game With Phoenix Players Promises to be Fast Exhibition. 
### 
On the State League Grounds, at
r.Tth and Grove streets in Oakland,
tomorrow afternoon at 2:30, the Var-

sity will celebrate
Washington's Birth
day by playing the
second game of the
seriei with. the
Phoenix aggrega
tion. This will be
the first game away
from tho campus
for tho Cardinal
players and will be
the only one to lie

played across the bay until the Cali
fornir. contest.
The showing made by the Varsity
nine since its last, closely-contested
game with these collegians and in the
following games with strong outside
groups, promises a closely fought
game tomorrow. St. Mary's was
forced to leave their best pitcher be
hind, during their trip here last Wed
nesday, but in tomorrow's game the
Catholic Collegians will use their fore
most twirlers, Cann and Ross, with
Fitzsinnnons as an alternate if neces
sary.
Coach Ganong has not decided who
shall toe the rubber for the Cardinal.
Enderle will of course be given a rest
after yesterday's hard mound work.
It seems quite probable that the
Coach will take Halm, Van Dyke and
Gilfillan along with him tomorrow and
made a strong attempt to take the sec
ond game of the series from the Phoe
nix. The remainder of the Cardinal
lineup will remain unchanged, with
the exception of Ganong who will
wear the mask.
The special Washington's Birthday
edition of the Daily tomorrow, will
contain a special dispatch from Oak
land with an account of the game and
the final score.
The lineups are:
Stanford —Halm, Gilfillan, Van Dyke,
pitchers; Ganong, catcher; Hall, first
base; Cass, second base; Mitchell,
third base; Terry, short-stop; Dono
van, Childs, left, field; Henshaw,
center field; Reeger, right field.
St. Mary's—Leonard, Roth Bros.,
pitchers; Simpson, catcher; Wilken
son, first base; Guigni, second base;
Wallace, third base; Fitzsinnnons,
short-stop; Lynch, left field; Leon
hardt, center field; Ross, right field.
