# THREE TRIPLE BAGGERS FEATURED BY VARSITY
## MITCHELL CREDITED WITH TWO. CASS GETS OTHER. Big Leaguers Win Game in the Ninth Inning by Strong Hitting Rally. 
### 
Three long distance hits into the far
garden positions, in yesterday's game
with Ireland's Big Leaguers, were
recorded as three-baggers, twice by
Mitchell and once by Cass. Mitchell
sent out the first triple in the first in
ning, but was called out for avoiding
second base enroute to third. In the
eighth, the Cardinal slugger again
connected for a triple sacker and came
home on Ganong's single. Cass then
stepped to the plate and capped the
spheriod for another triple, Donovan
sacrificing him home to tie the score.
But for a lucky bunching of hits in
the ninth after two outs, for the visi
tors, the game would have*been closer
as regards the score and might easily
have gone a tie beyond the ninth.
Nothing but the snappy ball handling
of the leaguers kept more Cardinal
batters from tallying. Strike outs
played little part in the game, Moski
mon getting but three in six innings
and Schimpf one during the last trio.
Enderle took two strike outs.
The eight hits by the Varsity were
well scattered thruout the innings,
with the exception of the three-hit,
three-run eighth. The Independent's
thirteen were bunched in their scor
ing innings, four for the fourth and
two runs, three in the eighth with two
runs, and finally a quartet in the last
for a doubling of their previous score.
The fifth saw the first Cardinal bat
ters cross the plate. Beeger saw the
initial sack on Moskimon's error and
reached the keystone before the ball
was returned to the infield. Terry
walked. Henshaw hit to center, send
ing Beeger across the plate, Terry
tried to follow suit but a quick return
from the center garden caught him
sliding home and completed the three
outs. Mitchell, Ganong and Cass added
three more in tlie eighth to tie the
leaguers. Kennedy and Williams
singled Sheehan and Swayne home.
Score 8-4.
The Stanford line-up was: Enderle,
pitcher; Ganong, catcher; Ball, first
base; Cass, second base; Mitchell,
third base; Terry, short-stop; Childs,
Donovan, left field; Henshaw, center
field; Beeger, right field.
