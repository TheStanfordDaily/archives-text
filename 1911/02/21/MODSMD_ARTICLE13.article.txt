# Be Patriotic.
## 
### 
Washington's Birthday is a time for
a visible display of patriotism. Two
excellent chances for a local demon
stration will be given tomorrow. Cap
and Gown to raise money for the Wo
men's Clubliouse, will give an old fash
ioned country fair in Roble Gymnas
ium. Every woman should attend.
The men will have their innings with
a soccer game. If Stanford wins she
has a chance for the championship.
It will be a good exhibition of the
sport, for both teams are crack or
ganizations. Help soccer.
