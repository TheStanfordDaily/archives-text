The proposed erection of a band
stand at Lagunita conies as welcome
news to the Student Body. Driven

from the use of
our beautiful In
ner Quadrangle

as a concert
place, it is gratifying to know that our
wandering minstrels have at last,
found a haven for the practice of their
art on the green shores of the lake.
The bi-weekly concerts at such an
ideal place will be enjoyed by the
.entire Student Body. For these good
times to come we have Professor E.
W. Martin to thank first of all. The
director of the band is one of the real
friends of the students. A man of wide
interests and broad sympathies, he has
done much to make undergraduate
life worth while and we owe him a big
vote of thanks.
One objection can lie raised to La
gunita as a concert park. On the op
posite shore, basking in the quiet glow
of the dying sun our friend, the cor
pulent suzerain of this vale of tears,
will sit on his veranda drinking in the
silver strains of melody as they are
wafted over the dimpling waters by
the gentle evening zephyrs. These
voluntary serenades by the student
fiddlers will be greatly relished by
Old King Cole, secure in his mountain
hacienda. "Tune up you lowly vassals,
or I'll drain the lake."
