# Second of Signs is Posted.

### 
â€¢ The second ol' the mysterious signs
hung over the car tracks appeared
during the course of the night and
greeted the first students bound for
"8:15's" this morning. The new can
vas reads "I'm Coming, Kid." It was
definitely learned last evening that the
signs had nothing to do with the I're-
Panama Exposition as had been sup
posed. Those in charge of this af
fair denied any knowledge as to the
source of the first inscription, ft is
now thought that some attraction
which is to appear in the near future
in Palo Alto is responsible for the
advertisement. It is very seldom that
Palo Alto shows advertise on the
campus. Speculations is rife among
the students as to.the source of the
signs.
