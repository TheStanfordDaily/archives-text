Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Now that (Pardon, Chappie, old
boy!) the Dean of Women deems it
advisable to encroach upon the duties
of her esteemed contemporary,
"Dutch" Roth, to the extent of spread
ing her motherly wings, (not to men
tion advice) over the much abused and
still much more misguided backbone
of this old farm, — the Stanford
"rough-," 1 crave a foot or two of your
valuable space to utter a few com
bustible remarks.
In years goneby, when Stanford
University was a breeding farm for
real, red-blooded men and thorough
bred women, the harvest of knowledge
was reaped annually with little or no
friction and with a great deal of down
right fun. Stanford men respected
Stanford women and in return Stan
ford women placed no small degree
of confidence in the men folk. Things
ran smoothly enough to avoid scandal,
and going to church with the "ideal of
your dreams" was a favorite pastime.
The men and women, then, were just
plain folk without any "modern"
ideas of convention. In other words,
they were real, not artificial. They
made up a sort of "Happy Valley"
community, and Doctor Gardner's
pate was covered with a fine growth of
luxuriant hair. He loved his children
(spiritually speaking) and never
worried much about their sojourns
into the cactus or over the bridge onto
the stock farm. In fact, things were
about as near to the ideal as is Pacific
Grove today.
Trip lightly over a few years and we
find ourselves at Stanford after the
"Social Renaisance." And here is
what we see—if we tear the scales
from our eyes: Segregation of the
sexes in and out of the class rooms;ex
pressive (if not elegant) words purged
from our popular and honored songs;
rules regulating the style, material
and color of skirts, shirt-waists and
jackets; a feeble agitation for aboli
tion of corduroy pants for Upper
classmen; Sequoia spasms assailing
the "rough" because he refuses to be
the affinity of a dress suit; Mercerised
and Cauterized meetings of Seniors
and Juniors on Thursday evenings;
numerous broken promises of marri
age in staid old Pally; Chapel ser
vices for the edification of the officiat
ing Key-to-Heven alone, or almost,
but never quite; sorority house rules
that would —but what's the use? You
all know the "low-down" about social
life and conditions at Stanford, and
you all know, or some day will realize,
that they are artificial!
At the rate we have been going up
this "social scale" how long will it be
before this red-blooded instittuion
degenerates into a Mollycoddle Manu
factory and seminary for senseless
spinsters?
Is it not high time that Stanford
men utilize their own brains; exer
cise their own judgment regarding
matters of dress at. or away from
functions intended to be essentially

democratic? Or are we to continue
taking counsel, not entirely devoid of
command, from one who was imported
from the effeminate East, to deal with
feminine frailties and frivolities at
Stanford.
Let us strike while the iron sizzles!
Either continue to conduct class jolly
ups along the lines and in the cos
tumes that made the initial affair a
welcome and much needed institution,
or alse bury them in the rapidly grow
ing graveyard of Stanford traditions,
to which the faculty annually adds its
quota!
Respectfully submitted,
B. J. O.
