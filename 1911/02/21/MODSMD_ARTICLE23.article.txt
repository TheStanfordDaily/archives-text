### 
Day and night on Thursday will be
alike dedicated to the disciples of the
forensic arts, it having been found
necessary to hold the tryouts for the
Tri-state debate on both afternoon and
evening of that day. This was neces
sitated by the unusually large number
of entries in the event. 3:30 and 7:30
o'clock are the hours set for the com
mencement of the speaking.
Squad number one will tryout in the
afternoon. The members of this group
are: Affirmative —C. H. Close, '12, N.
D. French, '12, J. Gibson, C. H. Gilbert,
'13, M. B. Henshaw, '12; negative—
A. G. Bradford, '13, R. G. Cole, '12, C.
L. Coffin. '13, G. N. Wood, '13, G. Hol
comb, '11.
The second squad will hold its con
test in the evening. The men who will
then speak include: Affirmative—C.
E. Johnston, '1.2, G. Miller, '14, S. J. E.
Sharp, '14, D. C. Smith, , W. P.
Butcher, '13, R. F. Stever, '12; nega
tive—P. D. Nowell, '13, W. B. Owens,
'14, \V. E. Simpson, '13, T. L. Smith,
'14, L. D. Summerfleld, '11, E. E. Tin
cher, '12. Any entries who desire to
withdraw from the tryout, or who have
been placed on the wrong side of the
question, should notify some member
of the Intel-society Debating Commit
tee.
The rules governing the tryout are
similar to those ordinarily in force at
such events. Each speaker will be al
lowed a ten minute speech and three
minutes for refutation. Four speakers
and two alternates will be selected,
but the side upheld by a speaker in
the tryout will have no weight in his
assignment to a team. The judges,
who have not yet been selected, will
arrange the teams in the manner cal
culated to make them most effective.
