# JAPANESE COLLEGIANS TO PLAY VARSITY HERE
## WASEDA NINE TO MEET CARDINAL IN APRIL. Touring Nipponese Players Will Come to Stanford.â€”Nevada Aggregation Plays on Turf March 9. 
### 
Stanford will play a game with a
Japanese baseball nine from the Uni
versity of Waseda, Tokio, during the
last week in April according to ar
rangements made today by Graduate
Manager D. W. Burbank. The Japan
ese players will arrive in this country
on April 20 on an invitation from the
University of Chicago. This proposi
tion has received the approval from
the Conference of Western Colleges.
Wisconsin had made arrangements
to invite another Japanese aggrega
tion, the Keio Collegian nine to make
a baseball tour of this country, but
the Badgers have given this up and
will back the Chicogan's proposition.
The Wisconsin players made a suc
cessful tour of Japan last season and
it is largely due to them that the col
leges of the United States are now on
terms of baseball rivalry with the
sons of Nippon.
In order that the expense of the
oriental visitors may be defrayed dur
ing their sojourn on the coast, one or
two games will be played with Stan
ford, California, St. Mary's and the
Santa Clara Collegians.
The option of two guarantees was
offered to Burbank by the Chicago
manager: first, a guarantee of $750 on
the first game and $100 in case of
rain, $50 on the second game, rain or
shine; second, 50 per cent of the gross
receipts of one or both games played.
The Cardinal manager has written his
acceptance of the second offer.
The Waseda players form one of the
strongest baseball groups in the Is
land Empire and are fast all-around
exponents of the American national
game. Their coach, A. Schaeffer, is a
well known Californian player and a
graduate of Santa Clara College.
Schaeffer was a strong player while
at bis Alma Mater and since leaving
the Mission college has been a nation
al leaguer with the New Yorkers.
Another game has also been added
to the Varsity's schedule. Burbank
has secured a game with the Univer
sity of Nevada nine to play here on
the afternon of Thursday, March f >.
The Sagebrushers will arrive on the
campus the morning of the game, in
time for practice on the turf. The
brawny sons of the desert have the
reputation of being hard sluggers,
accurate ball handlers and fast sack
workers and should give the Cardinals
;i stiff afternoon's workout.
The plainsmen are also scheduling
games with California, St. Mary's and
Santa Clara during their Pacific Coast
pilgrimage.
