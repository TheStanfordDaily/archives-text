# The 						Temperance Prize

### 
In another column will be noticed
the offer of a $50 prize by the Palo
Alto Women's Christian Temperance

Union for an es
say on the sub
ject of "The Re
lation of Individ-

mil Total Abstinence to National Pros
perity." This is the third time that
snch a prize has been offered by this
neighboring organization. The sub
ject is an interesting one and more
should try for the award than have in
the past. The winner has his essay
entered into state and national com
petition and it is possible, as was the
case last year, for $22f> to be won by
the one essay.
Along with our so-called "literary
degeneracy," the complaint goes out
that Stanford students take small in
terest in literary activities as a whole.
Especially does this apply to the con
tests. As compared with the older
eastern universities, Stanford has few
permanent money prizes offered in
this line and yet the number of entries
for the few existing prizes is pitifully
small. Never more than a half dozen
try for the $150 Honnheim and still
less for the W. C. T. U. award. Aside
from the value of a study of the sub
jects discussed it would seem that the
monetary rewards would prove at
tractive. Senator Beveridge "put
himself thru" college by winning ora
torical and dissertation prizes. De
serving students with good heads
might follow in the Indiana solon's
footsteps. They would not only re
ceive personal benefit but would be
advancing the good causes for the
propagation of which the prizes are
offered.
