## Juniors and Sophomores Will Meet in Filial Clash on the Turf Diamond at 4:30. 
### 
On the Turf Diamond, tomorrow
afternoon at 4:30, the Juniors will
meet the Sophomores to decide the
Interclass Baseball Championship.
The teams are evenly matched and the
intense excitement of the final game
promises to even up the errors.
Van Dyke will probably take the
mound for the Upperclassmen pro
vided he is not used by Ganong
against the Catholic players today.
Argabrite will probably be the Junior
receiver behind the plate. Draper
will alternate as Sophomore twirier
with Douglas. Beecher will officiate
as catcher.
Both of the teams have been prac
ticing each afternoon down near the
Auxiliary Diamond and have develop
ed two unusually strong class base
ball units. A few changes will prob
ably be made by the captains so that
a somewhat different line-up will face
the bleachers tomorrow than ap
peared in the preliminary games. Both
sides will use their best available
material and will send the strongest
fielding and batting aggregation into
the diamond that is possible in an
attempt to annex the title of Class
Championc.
