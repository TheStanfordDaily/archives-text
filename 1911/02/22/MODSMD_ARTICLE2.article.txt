# Alright Gives Clever Chalk Talk.

### 
E. M. Albright, '12, gave an illus
trated talk Sunday evening to the
Berkeley Baptist Church on the sub
ject, "Stuff and Nonsense." He ended
his lecture with an illuminated scene
or the Golden (late, similar to the view
of a sunset over Lagunita that he gave
in the minstrel show here last year.
