# Sign Mystery is Cleared Up.
## 
### 
That the mysterious signs which
have appeared near the Bookstore for
the past two days are not the adver
tisements of either the Pre-Panama
Exposition, or of any Palo Alto attrac
tion. was made evident this morning
when the latest of the signs was put
up. The newest one reads, "March 4th
is the Date." As this is the date for
the Sophomore play, the mystery is no
longer a mystery. The advertise
ments are for"The Senator." So well
have the Sophomores in charge of the
affair kept it under their hats, that
but very few suspected the real source
of the advertisements. In addition to
the signs, postal cards bearing the
same words as appeared on the large
advertisement for that day, were sent
to all the fraternity houses. This
added considerable to the mystery,
particularly when the second of the
signs made its appearance.
