Considerable apprehension for the
safety of J. H. Menke, '10, and A. W.
Frolli, '09, who at present are thought
to be in the center of the Mexican
revolutionary territory, is felt by
friends of the men at Stanford.
Menke and Frolli left Los Angeles
about February 6, for Mexicala,
whence they expected to go direct to
the Mud Volcano region, which has
been the scene of several engagements
between the insurrectos and the Mex
ican rurales recently.
While the men anticipated no
trouble on their departure, because of
the sympathy displayed for the insur
rectos by Americans across the border,
their position easily might become em
barrasing if not precarious.
Menke and Frolli are employed by a
Pasadena syndicate, of which Admiral
T. C. McClaine is the head, to survey
for oil and map a tract .of land about
55 miles square between Calexico and
