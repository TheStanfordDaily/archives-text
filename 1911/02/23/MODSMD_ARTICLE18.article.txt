# STANFORD PROFESSORS TO STUDY FISH PRESERVATION
## DATA OF STATE'S RESOURCES OBJECT OF SURVEY. California Game and Fish Commission Ask Members of Faculty to Make Investigations. 
### 
Recognizing the leading position of
Stanford men in the field of science,
the California Game and Fish Com
mission has conferred signal honor
on the University by the appointment
of three members of the Faculty as
special investigators in the recently
inaugurated economic survey of the
natural resourses of the state. The
appointees are: C. H. Gilbert, head
of the Zoology department; H. Heath,
professor of Zoology; and F. W. Wey
mouth, assistant in physiology. The
survey is for the purpose of working
out the scientific problems for pre
serving the natural supply of fish and
gamo in the state.
Professor Gilbert has been called
upon to study the salmon and trout
in California. He has pursued an
investigation independently along
these lines for some time past. For
the next two years he expects to con
fine his observations to this state in
the interests of the commission. He
will make frequent trips to the fish
eries of the entire state. Professor
Gilbert has done much original work
on this line in the Puget Sound coun
try.
Clams will be Professor Heath's
special line. He will make a survey
of California relative to all the mol
lusks that have an economic value,
and will study their habits in their
breeding beds. Very little is known
of the edible mollusks and their dis
tribution in California and Professor
Heath will find opportunity for valu
able research.
Weymouth will study the edible
crab of California. Nearly every week
end finds him among the crab fisher
men of the Bay of San Francisco.
The economic survey of the state's
natural resources is the idea of J. P.
Babcock, who recently was appointed
chief deputy of the state commission.
The need for accurate knowledge of
the food forms of the state's fauna has
long been apparent and is reflected in
the frequent amendments and repeals
to the state laws on the subject. The
work is to be carried out in a thorough
and scientific manner and for this
purpose the most careful and practical
investigators have been called upon
by the commission.
