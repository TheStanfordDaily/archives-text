# OLD MOUNTAIN HOUSE IS STILL DOING BUSINESS.
## 
### 
A rumor is afloat to the effect that
the Mountain House at Kind's Moun
tain is closed. In the past this trip
has been one of the favorite pastimes
of the students, hut since this rumor
was circulated very few have been
patronizing the drive, because of the
improbability of getting the usual feed
at the end.
Mrs. King, the proprietress of the
Mountain House, wants it known that
she is still serving the same good
"eats" at the same old place and is
especially glad to serve student
parties.'.
