# NESTORIA SENATORS ARE TO UNSEAT "STANDPAT" LORIMER.
## Important Political Move Scheduled for Next Tuesday Evening in Room 214. 
### 
A persistent rumor is afloat in polit
ical circles to the effect that an ef
fort is to be made by the insurgent
wing of the Republican party at the
next meeting of the Senate, scheduled
for next Tuesday evening in room 214,
to unseat the standpat Senator Lori
mer. The Senators, who in less palmy
days were known as members of Nes
toria, maintain a discreet silence on
the subject. Senator Tincher angirly
denied having had instructions from
Oyster Bay to slip the walking papers
to the Illinois statesman, while Sena
tors Payne and Tilton emphatically
refuse to make a statement for the
press.
On the authority of a Senator of
comparatively unimpeachable integ
rity, however, we are able to state
that such a movement will take place
next Tesday evening in room 214, and
that the galleries of the Senate cham
ber will be thrown open to spectators
without distinction as to sex.
Nestoria adjourned its regular meet
ing last evening in order to conserve
its energies for the coming political
excitement.
