# SOUTHERN PACIFIC WITHDRAWS FRIDAY-MONDAY RATES
## R. R. Commission Declares Reduced Fare to Students Violation of New State Law. 
### 
Weekend excursion rates to Stan
ford students have een withdrawn by
the Southern Pacific railway.
This action has been brought about
by the interpretation of the State Rail
way Commission of a law passed by
the state legislature at the present
session, adjudging such rates illegal
as class discrimination. It did not
come thru any desire of the Southern
Pacific to abolish the reduced rates.
Heretofore it has been the custom to
sell excursion tickets to University
students at reduced rates on presen
tation of a statement from the Regis
trar of their enrollment. These tick
ets were good for passage from Friday
until Monday. Henceforth students
will have to pay the regular fare.
.1. E. McDowell, Assistant Registrar,
appeared before the Railway Com
mission on behalf of the students and
endeavored to have the excursion
rates retained, furnishing reasons why
such a course would be desirable. He
was informed by the Commission that
no choice was left them under the
state law and that the rates would no
longer be in effect.
