### 
Professor Gilbert was called to
Sisson Saturday, where lie is super
intending the marking of trout at the
fish hatchery near the foot of Mt.
Shasta.
A large number of small trout fry
are being prepared for liberation in
the streams of the state. In order
that their growth and movements up
and down the streams may be ob
served and studied, each of the fry is
being marked by the removal of the
major portion of orie iln. This marks

the fish permanently so that it im
mediately may be recognized when
caiight and yet does hot cripple or in
capacitate it.
