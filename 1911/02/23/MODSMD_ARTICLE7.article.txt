# DOUBLE MEET WILL BE HELD NEXT SATURDAY
## FRESHMEN VS. SANTA CLARA. VARSITY VS. OUTLAWS. All First Year Men Will Compete. Varsity Squad Will Try Conclusions With Ineligibles. 
### 
Varsity against Outlaws and Fresh
men vs. Santa Clara will constitute
the track program for next Saturday.
The double meet is scheduled to take
place at 3 o'clock. The Freshmen
were to journey to Santa Clara, but
through a change in arrangements,
the Mission squad will make the trip
to the campus. Because of this, every
Freshman is expected to appfear and
to compete in the event for which he
is trying out. Every Varsity man is
also expected to turn out unless he
has received permission from Captain
Bellah to do otherwise.
"Dad" predicts that the meet with
the Outlaws will be the best of the
preliminary events of the season. Al
though only twelve men will oppose
the entire Varsity squad, the fact that
only first places will he counted for
points, gives them a good even break.
R. S. Worthington, '12, who has gotten
up the Outlaw team promises that bis
men will make the going lively.
