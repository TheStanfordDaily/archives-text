# FOUR MEN SELECTED FOR COMING DEBATES
## OWENS, TINCHER, BRADFORD AND WOOD CHOSEN. Judges in Tryout Pick Capable Debaters Against Oregon and Washington. 
### 
W. B. Owens, '14, E. E. Tincher, '12,
A. G. Bradford, '13, and G. N. Wood,
'13, will be Stanford's representatives
in the contests of the Tri-state De
bating League for the semester. This
fact was determined last evening after
a tryout in which the contest for po
sitions was as close as the entry list
was large. The first and third of these
men, with G. Holcomb, '11, as alter
nate, will form a team to debate the
negative of the question, "Resolved,
That the United States should adopt
a system of ship subsidies." This
team will meet the University of Wash
ington at Seattle on the evening of
March 25. The second and fourth of
those chosen, as well as P. D. Nowell,
'13, their alternate, will remain at
Stanford where they will support the
affirmative of the above question
against Oregon University on the same
date.
The choice of these men and their
combination in such a manner insures
two capable and well balanced teams.
Although a first year man, Owens won
recognition as one of the foremost de
aters in college in the Freshman-Soph
omore contest last fall, and last night
his easy delivery and excellent pres
ence, marking him an experienced
speaker, as well as his effective argu
ment, confirmed his claim to such a
title. He registers in the Pre-legal
department from San Jose, and is af
filiated with Euphronia literary so
ciety and Delta Chi fraternity. Tinch
er's leadership in forensic lines is un
disputed. The effective delivery and
well-constructed argument which he
showed while representing Stanford
in the recent Carnot. debate were again
in evidence last night. Tincher, who
is Vice-President of Nestoria, is a
Pre-legal major from Long Beach, his
fraternity being Delta Chi. Bradford,
the third man chosen, was noticale
foe his very logical argument. He is
also an experienced speaker. He rep
resented his class in the Freshman-
Sophomore debate last, year, served as
alternate in the same contest this year,
and is a past secretary of Nestoria.
He registers in the Pre-legal depart
ment from San .lose. Wood was until
this year a newcomer to local de
aling life, but proved his worth in the
underclass debate of the preceding
semester. â€¢ Euphronia is his literary
society, Blue Lake his home, and Law
his major study. The two alternates
have also made their marks as speak
ers, Holcomb being enrolled as a mem
ber of Nestoria and Delta Chi while
Nowell was a Sophomore class debater
this year.
