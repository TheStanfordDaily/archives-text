Editor Daily Palo Alto:
The Dean of Women seems to be in
volved in a rather wide-spread dis
cussion concerning certain masculine
fashion of dress, to the extent of
having been quoted at a class meeting
and having been made the subject of
an editorial by you. Since you neg
lected to verify your facts, or thought
them sufficiently reliable, and ihe
Sophomore pen is dry, it may be us
well for the Dean of Women to say
that she sent but one message to the
meeting of the Sophomore classâ€”the
request that all girls living on the
campus ride home in the special car,
a custom set and followed by the
upperclassmen and most excellently
in accord with (he spirit ot the ideal
"jolly-up." Linking to this message
some directions relative to the men's
dress, the committee of the Sophomore
class unintentionally put the Dean of
Women in the light of prescribing the
style of clothes to be worn by men i,t
their "jolly-up," and gave opportunity
to others to misrepresent her personal
attitude towards the so-called 'rough
neck." in general.
Very truly yours,
EVELYN VV. ALLAN.
