# Audience Will Choose Topic.
## 
### 
To allow his audience the privilege
of choosing the topic he is to speak
upon, is the unique plan of Doctor
Jordan for his lecture tonight before
the liberal education center in San
Francisco. The subject will be picked
from the topics, "The National Debt
of Europe," or the President's well
known "Ascent of the Matterhorn."
