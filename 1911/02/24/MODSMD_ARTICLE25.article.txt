# VARSITY TO MEET ALL-STARS.
## Participants of Last Saturday's Twelve Inning Tie Will Play on Turf. Tomorrow. 
### 
The All-Stars line up against the
Cardinal tomorrow on the Turf Dia
mond at 2:30. The game promises to
he a strongly contested match, since
the teams played a 4-4 tie a week ago.
The college experts of former Varsi
ties will bring with them practically
the same strong baseball combination
as was seen in action against the
Varsity last Sunday.
The same stellar battery that mowed
the Cardinal ranks down thru twelve
hard innings will again appear.
Theile will toe the rubber and Presley
will pick the balls off the bat from the
receiving position at home.
Enderle will open on the mound for
the Varsity. The sturdy Cardinal
hurler was given a layoff last Satur
day after his nine innings against the
Phoenix players on the preceding
Wednesday. He is therefore an un
known quantity to the visitors tomor
row. Ganong or Achi will wear the
Cardinal mask.
The line-ups are:
Stanford —Enderle, pitcher: Ganong,
Achi, catchers; Ball, first ase; Cass,
second ase: Mitchell, third base;
Terry, short-stop; Donovan, Childs,
left field; Henshaw, center; eßeger,

All-Stars —Theile, pitcher; Presley,
catcher; Elrod, first base; Mull, sec
ond base; Byrnes, third base; Peters,
