## 
### 
There was plenty of excitement
down on the Turf Diamond yesterday
afternoon when the Sophomores won
the Interclass Championship from the
Juniors in a seven inning game, re
plete with balloon ascensions, by the
score of 9-3. An aerial trip in the
second gave the Juniors the lead and
another run in the next chapter seem
ed to decree the upperclassmen as the
winners.
Hut the seventh saw a reversal and
two walks and five hits off Van Dyke
sent seven underclassmen across the
plate. No reversal was granted to the
Juniors and the last two innings was
a shut out for them. The personnel
of the winning nine was: Hughes,
Worswick, Dooling, Jack, Collins, Mc-
Neely, Beecher, Hagerman and Doug
las.
