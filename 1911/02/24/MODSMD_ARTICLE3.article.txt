# ENGLISHMAN PAYS HIGH TRIBUTE TO LINCOLN
## 
### 
Depicting the* life and character of
Abraham Lincoln, "the man of sorrows
and of destiny," Dr. Charles Frederic
Aked, this morning delivered an ef
fective address before a University
Assembly. His delivery was always
convincing, his character sketching
vivid, his statements attended by a re
markable eloquence.
Dr. Aked, who is an Englishman, in
opening his address, commented on
the seeming incongruity of a man born
under another flag speaking to a peo
ple about their national hero. Hut he
doubted whether such a man as he
could contribute anything to "the deep
patriotism which is linked with the
deathless dead." Hut he showed that
there was another aspect to the case
inasmuch as Lincoln is all the world's
hero.
Taking up the life of the war presi
dent, the speaker noted the fact that
all early conditions were against him.
He was born of parents below the
level of respectable poverty. His
father was a worthless idler, and his
youth was only a series of dreary,
drudging years. He met with many
defeats. He entered the army as a
captain and retired as a private. He
took up land surveying, but his in
struments were sold for debt. He en
tered politics and all his early at
tempts failed. "Never," declared the
speaker, "by any single flight of genius
did he show promise of that mighty
manhood that was to cause a grateful
nation to fling his praise above the
stars."
In this country it was shown that
office does not make greatness, but it
affords the opportunity for greatness.
The supreme test came to Abraham
Lincoln and he showed his true char
acter and ability by "greatly rising to
a great occasion."
Lincoln had his ambitions and saw
his opportunities. It was shortly after
the president-to-be had engaged in the
debates with Douglas, his rival, that
he was invited to speak before a gath
ering in Brooklyn. For four months
he devoted his time to the preparation
of this address and its delivery made
him a national figure.
"There is no accounting for Lincoln,"
the speaker declared, showing how.

despite the handicap of poor parent
age and little education, he wrote
masterpieces of English literature, de
livered speeches that stand on an
equality with the most famous of his
tory, called vast armies into being,
baffled the ingenuity of Continental
diplomats, and finally with marvelous
will marched to his predestined end.
"Abraham Lincoln was a seer," the
speaker continued. "He understood
temporal things because he had seen
into the heart of everlasting truth.
He saw that slavery was wrong in
economics, wrong politically, and
wrong morally, and he knew that noth
ing wrong could endure."
Speaking oi Lincoln's religious at
titude, Dr. Aked stated that Lincoln
did not want God to be on his side,
but he wanted tc be on God's side.
Early i i life he doubted religion, for
the creeds that were presented to him
were crude and loveless. "Later," the
speaker went on, he came to bow low
before the throne of the King of Kings.
Later he considered himself only an
instrument in his Heavenly Father's
hands."
The multifold sorrows of Lincoln
were next discussed by Dr. Aked. It
was shown that "his was a heart roy
ally endowed with a capacity for lov
ing" and yet he was largely denied
love. His mother died when he was
ten years old; later his sister died,
he was married and his wife died, and
married again only to find himself un
happily wedded. These events cast a
gloom over his entire life, and yet
these were the things which did much
to make him- great. This quality was
shown in the great hearted statement:
"I have not suffered from the south.
I have suffered with the South."
"It is the manifest destiny of the
American people," declared the speak
er, "to build up a nation of sound
ideals. Short as has been your period
of achievement grand memories of the
past shine down upon you. If God has
ever revealed his will to any people
he has to you."
Holding Lincoln as an ideal Dr.
Aked concluded his address with an
eloquent preoration in which he pre
dicted a future of marvelous bright
ness for the American people.

masterpieces of English literature, de
livered speeches that stand on an
equality with the most famous of his
tory, called vast armies into being,
baffled the ingenuity of Continental
diplomats, and finally with marvelous
will marched to his predestined end.
"Abraham Lincoln was a seer," the
speaker continued. "He understood
temporal things because he had seen
into the heart of everlasting truth.
He saw that slavery was wrong in
economics, wrong politically, and
wrong morally, and he knew that noth
ing wrong could endure."
Speaking oi Lincoln's religious at
titude, Dr. Aked stated that Lincoln
did not want God to be on his side,
but he wanted tc be on God's side.
Early i i life he doubted religion, for
the creeds that were presented to him
were crude and loveless. "Later," the
speaker went on, he came to bow low
before the throne of the King of Kings.
Later he considered himself only an
instrument in his Heavenly Father's
hands."
The multifold sorrows of Lincoln
were next discussed by Dr. Aked. It
was shown that "his was a heart roy
ally endowed with a capacity for lov
ing" and yet he was largely denied
love. His mother died when he was
ten years old; later his sister died,
he was married and his wife died, and
married again only to find himself un
happily wedded. These events cast a
gloom over his entire life, and yet
these were the things which did much
to make him- great. This quality was
shown in the great hearted statement:
"I have not suffered from the south.
I have suffered with the South."
"It is the manifest destiny of the
American people," declared the speak
er, "to build up a nation of sound
ideals. Short as has been your period
of achievement grand memories of the
past shine down upon you. If God has
ever revealed his will to any people
he has to you."
Holding Lincoln as an ideal Dr.
Aked concluded his address with an
eloquent preoration in which he pre
dicted a future of marvelous bright
ness for the American people.
Depicting the* life and character of
Abraham Lincoln, "the man of sorrows
and of destiny," Dr. Charles Frederic
Aked, this morning delivered an ef
fective address before a University
Assembly. His delivery was always
convincing, his character sketching
vivid, his statements attended by a re
markable eloquence.
Dr. Aked, who is an Englishman, in
opening his address, commented on
the seeming incongruity of a man born
under another flag speaking to a peo
ple about their national hero. Hut he
doubted whether such a man as he
could contribute anything to "the deep
patriotism which is linked with the
deathless dead." Hut he showed that
there was another aspect to the case
inasmuch as Lincoln is all the world's
hero.
Taking up the life of the war presi
dent, the speaker noted the fact that
all early conditions were against him.
He was born of parents below the
level of respectable poverty. His
father was a worthless idler, and his
youth was only a series of dreary,
drudging years. He met with many
defeats. He entered the army as a
captain and retired as a private. He
took up land surveying, but his in
struments were sold for debt. He en
tered politics and all his early at
tempts failed. "Never," declared the
speaker, "by any single flight of genius
did he show promise of that mighty
manhood that was to cause a grateful
nation to fling his praise above the
stars."
In this country it was shown that
office does not make greatness, but it
affords the opportunity for greatness.
The supreme test came to Abraham
Lincoln and he showed his true char
acter and ability by "greatly rising to
a great occasion."
Lincoln had his ambitions and saw
his opportunities. It was shortly after
the president-to-be had engaged in the
debates with Douglas, his rival, that
he was invited to speak before a gath
ering in Brooklyn. For four months
he devoted his time to the preparation
of this address and its delivery made
him a national figure.
"There is no accounting for Lincoln,"
the speaker declared, showing how.

despite the handicap of poor parent
age and little education, he wrote
masterpieces of English literature, de
livered speeches that stand on an
equality with the most famous of his
tory, called vast armies into being,
baffled the ingenuity of Continental
diplomats, and finally with marvelous
will marched to his predestined end.
