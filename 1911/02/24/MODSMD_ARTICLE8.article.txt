# ENTHUSIASTS TO LAUNCH BASEBALL GROUP SERIES
## FALL RUGBY SERIES WILL BE PATTERN. Representatives of Organizations, in Meeting this Afternoon, Favored Inter-Group Baseball Series. 
### 
Representatives from the fraterni
ties and clubs decided today to start a
series of baseball games between
group teams, similar to the rugby
group teams of last fall, at a meeting
this afternoon in room 50.
All the organizations entering this
series will be divided into groups and
their standing at the close will be
graded on the percentage of games
won, so t'.irti a defeat will not elim
inate a group.
A committee composed of B. L. Hall,
'11, S. C. Peck, '11, and J. S. Peters, '11,
were appointed to take charge of the
series. Two games each week will be
played. The period of activity will
continue on Mondays and Fridays or
on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The
period of activity will continue as long
as (he committee deems it advisable.
If arrangements can be made they
will be played on the gymnasium dia
mond. If this field cannot be obtained
the auxiliary diamond will be utilized.
In order that the committee may
know how many are willing to play, so
that the groups can be arranged, the
representatives from the different or
ganizations are requested to hand in
the names of their players to Peck,
at the Sigma Chi house, at once. This
series is not to take the place of the
Interfraternity series, which will be
played after the Varsity season. If
the new proposition is successfully
started it should do much to improve
the baseball standard of the Interfra
ternity series.
