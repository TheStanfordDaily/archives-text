SPRING STYLES
The new suits are winsome to a degree.
Coats are cut somewhat shorter. Skirts retain their nar
rowness. The smart, trim lines of the past season's styles
continue in favor. Our workroom has been busy for weeks
on these new suits, and now they're ready for your approval.
Buy direct from the makersâ€”you save several profits.
All alterations made by expert man-tailors. Perfect fitting a
feature of our suit service.
