# OUTLAWS GIVE VARSITY MEN CLOSE COMPETITION
## SATURDAY'S MEET SEES GOOD SHOWING. Worthington's Fugitives Capture Four Events and Relay.—Scott Wins Polo Vault. 
### 
As was predicted, the Varsity track
squad had its hands full last Saturday
in defeating the Outlaws, the final
score being 40 to 150. Strong competi
tion seemed to work wonders with the
athletes, and despite the heavy wind
which blew across the oval the time
made in the track events was excep
tionally good. A general improvement
in the work of the entire squad char
acterized the meet.
Captain Worthington's band of fugi
tives succeeded in capturing four
pvents and the relay. As the dark
Jiorse of the meet, ex-Captain L. S.
Scott, '10, appeared and annexed five
points for the Outlaws in the pole
vault. C. D. Morris, '08, took ten
points from the Varsity in the hurdle
races, and ran one of the fastest laps
in the relay. Five more points were
accredited to the Outlaws when R. S.
Worthington, '12, captured the two
mile in 10:25.
The hundred and the two-twenty
were again won by H. Smitherum, '11,
and T. L. Coleman, '12, respectively,
who both bettered their time of last
Saturday by one-fifth of a second. R.
E. Millsap, '12, went around the quar
ter in 52 3-5, the fastest time made in
that event this season. C. C. Taylor,
'11, and B. Wallace, '12, ran a close
second and third.
The closest fight of the day was seen
in the half mile, T. M. Cramer, '11,
crossing the line less than a yard
ahead of J. B. Leanian, '13, in the
fast time of 2:05 3-5. F. J. Gard, '14,
also made good time in this event,
leading the Freshmen in 2:08 3-5.
The previous time made in the mile
was bettered by over five seconds by
K. F. Lee, '12, who ran a heady race
with a strong finish in 4:38 1-5.
G. L. Horine, '13, and W. M. Arga
brite, '13, repeated their consistent
performances in the high jump by
taking first and second in this event.
Horine's mark was six feet, one half
inch. The Outlaws were unable to
dispute the title of J. D. Woolley, '12,
to first place in both the hammer
throw and shot put. His heave of 142
feet in the former was eight feet bet
ter than that of his nearest competitor.
The three teams entered in the relay
furnished an exciting event by finish
ing the race about two yards apart.
The average time made by the men in
the winning team, the Outlaws, was
23 4-5 seconds to each lap.
