The warning bell which was in
stalled Saturday at the car-track
crossing on Lasuen street, is the in
vention of W. H Yount, the local
division superintendent of the Penin
sular Railway. The ringing of the
bell is started and stopped by means
of a trigger attached to the trolley
wire, which is a new principle in this
class of safety devices. The device is
not wholly perfected, but a patent has
been applied for.
