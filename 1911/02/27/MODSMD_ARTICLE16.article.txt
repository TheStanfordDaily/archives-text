# YESTERDAY'S SERMON A TRIBUTE TO FOUNDER
## DR. GARDNER SPEAKS OF MRS. STANFORD, University Chaplain Preaches on the Life of Loyalty of Our University Mother. 
### 
As a preliminary to the annual
Memorial Service to be held tomorrow
upon the sixth anniversary of the
death of Mrs. Jane Lathrop Stanford,
Dr. D. Charles Gardner gave a short
sermon yesterday morning in the
Chapel in order to bring into the
minds of the students the life of "the
mother of our University." His text,
Revelations 2:10. "Be thou faithful
unto death, and I will give thee a
crown of life," was well applied to the
life of Christian love and unswerving
loyalty which Mrs. Stanford devoted
to the upbuilding of the University.
Dr. Gardner began by saying that no
student was really loyal to Stanford
who did not know the lives of its
founders, and he sketched briefly the
story of Mrs. Stanford's early life.
Then he told how, in her bereavement
over the death of the only son, "emo
tion was exalted to motive," and she
planned with her husband for the
building of Lelaiul Stanford Junior
University. In the midst of the early
work, three years after the doors
were first opened, the sudden death of
Senator Stanford threw the entire
burden upon this noble hearted
woman. The actuu.l building of the
University was her work, and with
the utmost loyalty, patience and
courage she carried out her great
task.
The religious side of Mrs. Stanford's
nature was especially emphasized by
Dr. Gardner. Unostentatious and all
embracing charity, deeply personal
piety, and a passionate hope of immor
tality characterized this woman,
whose dearest hope was that Stanford
should send men and women into the
world to act their parts as "lovers of
Christ and apostles of the truth." In
the founding of the church, her great
est genius was manifest, for she in
tended it to be non-sectarian, "a con
secrated place offering free opportun
ity to all who wish it."
The sermon closed with these sug
gestive words, "The Stanford spirit
will truly express itself just so far as
it expresses self.-denial and sacrifice
in the same spirit as that of the loyal
woman who founded it."
After the regular service, the sacra
ment of the Lord's Supper was admin
istered by the Chaplain.
