### 
The finals in the interclass tennis
doubles were won Sunday on the Pen
insular Club courts by the Sophomore
team consisting of R. L. Murray, and
F. M. Douglass. Their opponents were
the Juniors, represented by H. S.
Morgan and C. S. Grace. The winners
took three out of four sets. The score
for the match was 6-4, 7-9, G-2, 6-4.
The match was umpired by P. B. Del
ano, '08, who held the University
championship at one time.
The match was remarkably well
contested throughout. It was marked
with spirited rallies, and careful and
excellent playing on the part of both
teams. Grace, of the Junior team,
has never played a better game than
the one he put up Sunday. He was
remarkably cool and effective at all
times. Morgan did his strongest work
at the net, where he proved almost
invincible.
For the Sophomores, Murray stood
out as having the most effective serve
Of any man of the four. Time and
again the scorer would chalk up an ace
against the Juniors when Murray was
delivering. Douglass' best work was
done with his terrific drive, which won
many points for the Sophomores. The
overhead work of the 1913 team was
much poorer, however, than that of
their opponents.
