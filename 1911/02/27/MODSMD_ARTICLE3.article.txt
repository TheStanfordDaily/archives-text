sets in the chal

winning scores
of 21-6, 21-5,
Wiggins conies
into permanent
possession of the
Storey Belt.
Peters won the
right to play
Wiggins by de
feating all com
ers in the tour
nament. The fi
nal match to de
cide who should
meet Wig gins
was to have been
held last Friday

between Peters and S. M. Bellah, '10,
but by the latter's forfeiting, the for
mer was declared the winner.
Although Peters is a fast and clever
player, he was unable to overcome the

steadiness and terrible driving of his
championship opponent in the chal
lenge match. The first set started
with both men playing carefully, but
Wiggins gradually forged ahead and it
was soon evident that he was the bet
ter player. He did not have an easy
time of it, however, as Peters made
him work hard for every point. Time
and again both men would make al
most impossible returns, calling for
cheers from the spectators.
The second set was but a repetition
of the first. Peters strove desperately
to stem the tide of defeat, but was un
able to win many points from the
champion. Both men played at top
notch speed until the final point was
won which decided that the trophy
belt should remain in the hands of its
present holder permanently.
The winner is without doubt one of
the best players in the West, and by
winning the belt for three consecutive
years, he has established a new Stan
ford record. He is a candidate for
graduation this spring in the Depart
ment of Civil Engineering and is a
member of the Gymnasium Club and
Encina Club.
