# HAPPY HIT COMBINATION GIVES ALL-STARS GAME
## VARSITY LOSES TO VISITORS SCORE 6-2. Terry Secures High Mit and Hit Record. —Mitchell Receives Injury to Hand. 
### 
By virtue of the All-Stars being able
to hit at the right time, the Varsity
was defeated on the turf field last Sat
urday, 6-2. The Cardinals were shut
out of hits in five innings, and Theile
allowed them only five bingles in the
other four chapters. Enderle, the
Varsity mounder, gave three hits in
five innings, while Van Dyke, relieving
him in the first of the sixth, permitted
five in the remaining four frames.
Scores came for Stanford in the first
and seventh; for the All-Stars in the
second, third, fourth, and ninth. In
every case, bingles sent the men home,
although most of the scoring players
started on their circut by a fluke,
rather than a clean bingle.
Stanford's runs were made by Terry
and Cass. Terry hit safely, made sec
ond on Hamilton's error and the throw
to first to catch Henshaw, and scored
on Uutledge's error. Cass in the
seventh hit to center, was sacrificed to
the keystone by Beeger, and came
across on Child'? bingle and the tffi :, d
baseman's bonehead handling of the
ball.
Eddy, Theile, Hamilton, Peters, and
Elrod are the All-Stars scoring play
ers. Elrod tallied twice. The trio
of Stanford men on the visiting team
were the battery, Theile and Rutledge,
and the short stop, Peters.
A swift ball from Theile's hand in
the sixth caught S. L. Mitchell on the
hand while at bat. The hand injured
was one hurt a week ago while Mitch
ell was covering the intricate corner.
He was forced to retire from the field
as a result of the second hurt, after
having played an unusual fielding
game. Terry was probably the fore
most Stanford player Saturday. He
bingled twice and walked the same
number of times, resulting in an aver
age of one thousand. His fielding was
not entirely perfect. One error is
credited to him. A had judgment is
also against him in leaving his posi
tion to catch a runner at second, al
lowing a hit in consequence. The
pitcher, however must share some of
the blame. Enderle's work was good.
Although three runs passed by him,
yet he did not lose his cool-headed
ness.

Scores came for Stanford in the first
and seventh; for the All-Stars in the
second, third, fourth, and ninth. In
every case, bingles sent the men home,
although most of the scoring players
started on their circut by a fluke,
rather than a clean bingle.
Stanford's runs were made by Terry
and Cass. Terry hit safely, made sec
ond on Hamilton's error and the throw
to first to catch Henshaw, and scored
on Uutledge's error. Cass in the
seventh hit to center, was sacrificed to
the keystone by Beeger, and came
across on Child'? bingle and the tffi :, d
baseman's bonehead handling of the
ball.
Eddy, Theile, Hamilton, Peters, and
Elrod are the All-Stars scoring play
ers. Elrod tallied twice. The trio
of Stanford men on the visiting team
were the battery, Theile and Rutledge,
and the short stop, Peters.
A swift ball from Theile's hand in
the sixth caught S. L. Mitchell on the
hand while at bat. The hand injured
was one hurt a week ago while Mitch
ell was covering the intricate corner.
He was forced to retire from the field
as a result of the second hurt, after
having played an unusual fielding
game. Terry was probably the fore
most Stanford player Saturday. He
bingled twice and walked the same
number of times, resulting in an aver
age of one thousand. His fielding was
not entirely perfect. One error is
credited to him. A had judgment is
also against him in leaving his posi
tion to catch a runner at second, al
lowing a hit in consequence. The
pitcher, however must share some of
the blame. Enderle's work was good.
Although three runs passed by him,
yet he did not lose his cool-headed
ness.

By virtue of the All-Stars being able
to hit at the right time, the Varsity
was defeated on the turf field last Sat
urday, 6-2. The Cardinals were shut
out of hits in five innings, and Theile
allowed them only five bingles in the
other four chapters. Enderle, the
Varsity mounder, gave three hits in
five innings, while Van Dyke, relieving
him in the first of the sixth, permitted
five in the remaining four frames.
