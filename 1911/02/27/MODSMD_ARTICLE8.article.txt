# In Memoriam
## 
### 
There is but a handful of students
among us who had the privilege of
seeing Stanford in the full flower jf

her beauty and growth
and who enjoyed the
peculiar charm of its life
together with the Mother

of the University. Next year with
their departure, the one connecting
link which joins us with the golden
past, will be broken. We may then
say that the day of the Founders is
past. There will be no student among
us who during his college days looked
upon the kindly face of the noble
hearted woman who builded this Uni
versity. Her memory is a living one
only to the students of former genera
tions; to us of the present day it is
but a beloved tradition.
Tomorrow afternoon at, her quiet
resting place among the trees and
grasses of the Arboretum, we of the
past and present may unite for the
last time as members of the registered
Student Body and pay memorial trib
ute. All should feel it a privilege to
unite in these services. We are re
specting the memory of a woman who
said, "i could lay down my life for
the University. Not for any pride in
its perpetuating the names of our dear
son and ourselves, its founders, but for
the sincere hope I cherish in its send
ing forth to the world grand men and
women who will aid in developing
the best there is to be found in hu
man nature."
