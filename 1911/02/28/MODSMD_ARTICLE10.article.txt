# A 						Nuisance.

Although safety devices are usually
welcomed by the unprotected public,
the noisy alarm bell established near
the Bookstore by the Peninsular
Railway Company, cannot receive a
very hearty reception. There is no
actual need for the contraption. It is
doubtful if it will ever perform any
very valient service as a life saver, but
its efficacy as a pestilential disturber
of campus peace and quiet is patent
