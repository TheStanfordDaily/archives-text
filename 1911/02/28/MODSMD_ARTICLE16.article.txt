Miss A. M. Miller and Miss B. C.
Whiting, the managers of the Deer
field Society of Blue and White
Needlework, designed the patterns,
and the expert needlewomen of Deer
field stitched them. The embroidery
is particularly notable for its color,
all of which is the result of vegetable
dyeing, done by the designers. The
blue is obtained from the "indigo-tub"
of our grandmothers, and the red,
rose, plumb and dull orange, from the
skillful use of another old dye-stuff,
madder. The colors are absolutely
fast, all of them having been treated
to the "soap bath," as a part of their
dyeing, but their especial value, lies
in their subtle toning and subdued
inner brilliancy, suggestive of oriental
rugs and old Japanese prints.
Mrs. O. L. Elliott, to whom the em
