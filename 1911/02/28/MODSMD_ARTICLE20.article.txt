### 
St. Mary's will play the third game
of the series with the Cardinal nine
011 the Turt Diamond tomorrow after
noon at 4:30.
With two games to her credit the
Phoenix will make a strong endeavor
to make it three straight. Cann, St.
Mary's south paw twirler, will open
for the visitors and his curves will go
a long ways toward lowering the bat
ting averages of the Varsity. Ross
and Fitzsimmons will be included in
the lineup and may be introduced to
the box, should the Cardinal binglers
begin to touch up Cann's twisters for
transportations to the sacks.
The remainder of the Oakland col
legians' line-up will probably be the
same as faced the Cardinal at Oakland
last Wednesday.
Gilflllan will take the box for the
locals and his showing against the
Phoenix in six innings last week, bids
much for tomorrow's showing. Gan
ong will help to reap Gilflllan's work
from behind the plate. Mitchell's hand
will probably allow him to play the
intricate corner and lend his batting
skill to the Cardinal line-up.
The Stanford line-up wi.ll be: Gil
fillan, pitcher; Ganong, catcher: Ball,
first base; Cass, second base; Mitchell,
third base; Terry, short-stop; Dono
