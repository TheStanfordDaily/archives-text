# EUROPEAN POLITICAL SITUATION OUTLINED BY DR. DAENELL
## Kaiser Exchange Professor Speaks Learnedly of Old World Conditions at Well Attended Assembly. 
### 
In an address which revealed many
facts of unusual interest relative to
the forces at work in modern Europa,
Dr. Ernst Daenell, Kaiser Wilhelm
Professor to the United States, spoke
before a University Assembly at 11:15
thi-j morning. He spoke with con
siderable detail ot the combinations
and. conditions which have brought
about the present, situation, and made
clear the international relations be
tween Germany and England which
many fear will result in a great
wa.\
The speaker stated that in order to
obtain a true conception of present
conditions it would lie necessary to
review briefly some of the history in
Europe during the past half century.
He then told of the opposition of
Austria and France to Germany, and
the defeat of the first two during the
period of 18G0 to 1870.
The second period, 1870 to 1890, Dr.
Daenell showed, was characterized by
the formation of the Triple Alliance,
consisting of Germany, Austria and
Italy. At this time Germany, under
Bismarck, prevented an alliance be
tween France and Russia. During
the next period the last ten yea v s of
the nineteenth century, Bismarck
dropped out of the great political
game and an alliance of France and
Russia was effected. This, however,
was offset by the Triple Alliance.
Near the beginning of the present
century, it was shown, the internal
development of Germany was such as
to permit no limitation of her ac
tivities to Europe alone. She was
forced by economic conditions into
a world policy of imperialism. It was
this situation that caused her to enter
the Turkish situation. England, im
mediately became suspicious, and lack

ot tact in international diplomacy
brought into being the present seem
ingly threatening situation.
Great Britain's policy was next dis
cussed by the speaker. Awaking to
what she thought was a menace to
herself, she began making agreements
with the various powers in Europe,
thinking that she might depend upon
them in case of trouble with Germany.
This activity on the part of England
began about the time of lhe accession
of Edward VII.
At. that time France advanced mil
lions ol dollars to Russia, much of
which was spent in the construction
of a railroad across the continent.
Russia had taken the first steps in her
world policy plan while Germany was
thinking of Imperialism.
Then came the Russo-Japanese war
which made known to the world the
remarkable deficiency of Russia in the
technique of war, and the vitiating
effect, that, her poor educational and
agricultural systems had had upon the
nation. In this connection Dr. Dae
nell stated that the agricultural output
of that country was barely enough to
nourish the people, but that Russia
exported grain and wrung $250,000,-
000 annually front the people by star
vation.
The clash, if one should come, be
tween Germany and England, Dr.
Daenell declared, would be brought
about by the Turkish situation. Eng
land controls India, the Coast of Per
sia, has annexed the Sianitic Peninsu
la and controls Egypt. She is plan
ning a railroad to be built from India
to Egypt and it is the German idea
that she intends to extend her in
fluence over the lower portions of the
Turkish possessions which are now
under the influence of the Germans.

them in case of trouble with Germany.
This activity on the part of England
began about the time of lhe accession
of Edward VII.
At. that time France advanced mil
lions ol dollars to Russia, much of
which was spent in the construction
of a railroad across the continent.
Russia had taken the first steps in her
world policy plan while Germany was
thinking of Imperialism.
Then came the Russo-Japanese war
which made known to the world the
remarkable deficiency of Russia in the
technique of war, and the vitiating
effect, that, her poor educational and
agricultural systems had had upon the
nation. In this connection Dr. Dae
nell stated that the agricultural output
of that country was barely enough to
nourish the people, but that Russia
exported grain and wrung $250,000,-
000 annually front the people by star
vation.
The clash, if one should come, be
tween Germany and England, Dr.
Daenell declared, would be brought
about by the Turkish situation. Eng
land controls India, the Coast of Per
sia, has annexed the Sianitic Peninsu
la and controls Egypt. She is plan
ning a railroad to be built from India
to Egypt and it is the German idea
that she intends to extend her in
fluence over the lower portions of the
Turkish possessions which are now
under the influence of the Germans.
In an address which revealed many
facts of unusual interest relative to
the forces at work in modern Europa,
Dr. Ernst Daenell, Kaiser Wilhelm
Professor to the United States, spoke
before a University Assembly at 11:15
thi-j morning. He spoke with con
siderable detail ot the combinations
and. conditions which have brought
about the present, situation, and made
clear the international relations be
tween Germany and England which
many fear will result in a great
wa.\
The speaker stated that in order to
obtain a true conception of present
conditions it would lie necessary to
review briefly some of the history in
Europe during the past half century.
He then told of the opposition of
Austria and France to Germany, and
the defeat of the first two during the
period of 18G0 to 1870.
The second period, 1870 to 1890, Dr.
Daenell showed, was characterized by
the formation of the Triple Alliance,
consisting of Germany, Austria and
Italy. At this time Germany, under
Bismarck, prevented an alliance be
tween France and Russia. During
the next period the last ten yea v s of
the nineteenth century, Bismarck
dropped out of the great political
game and an alliance of France and
Russia was effected. This, however,
was offset by the Triple Alliance.
Near the beginning of the present
century, it was shown, the internal
development of Germany was such as
to permit no limitation of her ac
tivities to Europe alone. She was
forced by economic conditions into
a world policy of imperialism. It was
this situation that caused her to enter
the Turkish situation. England, im
mediately became suspicious, and lack

ot tact in international diplomacy
brought into being the present seem
ingly threatening situation.
Great Britain's policy was next dis
cussed by the speaker. Awaking to
what she thought was a menace to
herself, she began making agreements
with the various powers in Europe,
thinking that she might depend upon
them in case of trouble with Germany.
