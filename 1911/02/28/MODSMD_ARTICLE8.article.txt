# Why Stop at This?

### 
The present political situation in
Europe as outlined by Professor
Ernst Daenell this morning would be
of a different complexion if the feeling
between the jealous Old World powers
were only the same as that which
prompted Roosevelt and the Kaiser to
establish the exchange professorship.
Likewise the whole world situation
would be considerably changed if
these two strenuous leaders agree on
an anti-military program.
