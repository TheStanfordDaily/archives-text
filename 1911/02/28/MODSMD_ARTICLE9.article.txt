With the inception of strict training
rules it will be in keeping with the
spirit of the season for all men to
show respect for these regulations.
A strict observance on the part of the
athletes continually disturbed by the
â€¢midnight, carols the door slams or the
rancous seminars of the overly-en
thusiastic non-athletic, does not
achieve the right results. Better re
sults can be obtained by centering
some regard on the other fellow as
well as on yourself.
