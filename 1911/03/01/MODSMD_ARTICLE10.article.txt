# A 						Red Letter Day

### 
Two steps in the right direction are
to he taken tomorrow. General par
ticipation in athletics is the goal to he

reached. Whether
this end will actual
ly be attained de
pends on the Student

Body. Chances will be given to play
rugby and inter-fraternity-inter-club
baseball and everyone not out for some
other sport should go in for one of
these. If not a sufficient number
enter, the efforts oi the sincere friends
of the students who have cherished for
many years the ideal of general par
ticipation will seem wasted effort.
That ideal, once a fact, will be a great
thing for Stanford men. It means a
healthy, spirited, clear-minded and
friendly Student Body. Skill in the
particular sport entered, altho desir
able, is a secondary consideration.
Benefit to the individual is most de
sired.
The move taken by President Ditz,
the Executive Committee and Captain
Erb in presenting tomorrow's oppor
tunity is most commendable. The
general policy of the present admin
istration has been a broad-gauged,
sympathetic one, worthy of respect and
praise. If all the plans are carried
out, between track, crew, baseball,
rugby, tennis, and soccer, there will be
little room left for chronic headaches
or torpid livers.
