Editor Daily Palo Alto:
A custom exists at some of the East
ern and middle-west colleges and uni
versities of presenting a blanket to
the Senior men who have made varsity
teams during their college careers.
In the center of the blanket there is a
large block initial of the college (hero
at Stanford, of course, it would be the
block S). Surrounding the letter are
five pointed stars, one star being given
for each time the athlete has made a
team. In other words, for each sweat
er that has been given one star is
placed on the blanket. The captain of
a team is allowed a seven pointed star.
These blankets are given by the Stu
dent Body to the Seniors at gradua
tion as a parting expression of remem
berance and gratitude for what these

men have done toward upholding the
good name of their college.
Now I think that this would be a
good custom to introduce at Stanford.
I have talked with several "Varsity"
! men about the matter and they think
! that it would be a good thing, but are
I backward about openly favoring it,
considering that the Student Hotly
might think it ungracious on their
part. I see no valid objection to its
introduction. The only reason for not
adopting the plan would be that of the
expense involved, but as there are
seldom if ever more than ten men
graduating each year who would be
entitled to these blankets, at a maxi
mum, the cost should not exceed one
hundred dollars. At any rate, the
Stanford Student Body would not in
the slightest begrudge the money in
volved.
I understand that, where the custom
has been tried that the Varsity men
think more of these blankets than they
do of their sweaters. At any rate I
think that it would be worth while for
the Executive Committee to consider
this matter and find out what the Var
sity men think of it.
