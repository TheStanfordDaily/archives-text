# No Baseball Today.

### 
The St. Mary's players were met at
the train this afternoon and turned
back, to Oakland, since the water
soaked baseball diamond made it nec
essary to cancel the game scheduled
between them and the Varsity. The
next and last, game with the strong
Phoenix men occurs at, Stanford on
March 11.
