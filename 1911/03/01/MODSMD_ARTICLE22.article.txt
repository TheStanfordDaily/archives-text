# BIG MARATHON THIS YEAR IS STAGED JUNIOR WEEK
## RACE WILL BE RUN ON MARCH TWENTY-FOURTH. Quadrangle Club Announces Date for Annual Interclass Six Mile Race. 
### 
On the afternoon of Friday, March
24, in conjunction with Junior Week
festivities, the Quadrangle Club will
stage its Annual Interclass Marathon
on the Stanford Oval. Twenty-four
men will represent each class and the
Holdovers will unite to form a fifth
group of racers. Each class will be
allowed three substitutes to use in
case of emergency. The course will
be around the cinder oval* for twenty
four laps, each runner covering the
entire circuit once before being re
lieved.
The handsome silver cup won by the
Class of 1911 in last year's meet will
be awarded to the class winning this
year's race. In addition to this prize,
three medals will be given to the en
tries who cover their laps in the short
est times. One of these, in the form of
a gold bar, will be given to the vet
eran making the best time and the
other two to the novices who clip off
the fewest number of minutes in their
turn on the cinders. A gold medal
will be given to the fastest runner and
a silver one to the second speediest.
The Quadrangle Club states that
only those who have never competed
on the track with a Cardinal team
against any outside group of athletes
fall into the novice class. This elim
inates all those who compete against
the Olympic Club, or any of the local
teams. By this the Quadrangle Club
seeks to discover new material for
the Varsity teams. It hopes to get
out new men, who under other circum
stances might never trod the cinders.
During the course of the afternoon,
some new stunts will be presented for
the edification of the audience and
something new and original is prom
ised. Just what these are to be will
not be known until the afternoon of
the 24th of March.
Each class entering the meet will be
charged an entrance fee of five dollars
to help defray the expenses of the
affair.
