# LORIMER UNSUCCESSFULLY ATTACKED IN NESTORIA.
## 
### 
Members of Nestoria became United
States senators last, evening and sat in
judgment on the case of Senator Lor
imer. The Nestorians achieved their
new honors by a, simple flight of the
imagination, without any of the visual
troublesome details of campaigns and
elections. "Vice-President of the
United States," F. H. Hilton, '11, pre
siding, opened the deliberations with
live speech in a dead language. Eng
lish thoughts in Latin. The opponents
of Lorimer, beaded by "Senators" R.
(!. Cole and (). 11. Close, immediately
began a determined attack upon him.
Though they apparently outnumbered
the supporters of the Illinois states

man, "Senators" <1. Holeolm and W
10. Simpson of the latter faction. In
fillibustering tactics and skillful use
of Parliamentary weapons, were able
to block all attempts to unseat him
and the session closed without decisive
acion. "Senator" E. E. Tincher occu

pied a commanding position 'on the
fence" during the proceedings.
Before the meeting of the "Senate."
Professor T. it. Cross of the Economics
department addressed to the members
of Nestoria a strong talk on the deca
dence of debating interest at Stanford.
