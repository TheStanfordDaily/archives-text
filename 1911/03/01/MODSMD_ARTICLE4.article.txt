Nothing remains to be done by t lie
Sophomore thespians, win will pre
sent "The Senator" on next Saturday
evening, hut to hold the final dress
rehearsals. With the exception ol the
use of properties .and the fact that
tiie players still have to become ac
customed to their costumes, the per
formance has reached ? point of ex
cellence which has seldom be?n sur
passed bj second year players.

Although the cast contains no par
ticular bright star, or stars, it is al
most perfectly rounded, and each of
the players is exactly suited to por
tray the part for which he or she has
been chosen. The work of the various
players is considerably above the
standard.
The properties do not offer the
difficulties that have at. times been
encountered ir. Pniversity presenta
tions, but the committee in charge is
making every effort to have the prop
erties quite in keeping with the time
of the play. This in itself offers some
trouble as they must neither be old. or
modern, but half way between. In
both the costumes and the properties,
the play will be a pleasant departure
from the usual run of student pro
duction!'.
The sale of seats on the first day
was very encouraging t< the com
mittee. The majority of the best
seats were taken up at the opening of
the box office on Monday morning. A
few good seats, however, are still ob
tainable at the Mookstore on the
campus, and at the Stanford Phar
macy, in Palo Alto.
