# MRS. STANFORD'S MEMORY KEPT SACRED YESTERDAY
## HER NOBILITY AND DEVOTION ENTOLLED. Exercises in Chapel Yesterday Afternoon Consist of Music and Address by Dr. Gardner. 
### 
Simple but reverent in its nature
was the Memorial Service held in the
Chapel yesterday afternoon to com
merate the sixtli anniversary of the
death of Mrs. Stanford. As Dr. D.
Charles Gardner suggested in his ad
dress, the exercises were not of a fun
eral character, since Mrs. Stanford
had lived a long life full of good deeds,
but rather were an expression of re
spect and thanksgiving for her whole
hearted services to tlie University.
A hymn and the singing of "Hail,
Stanford, Hail" by the audience were
followed by an anthem excellently
rendered by the University Choir. The
chief feature of the services was a
short talk by the Chaplain, I). C. Gard
ner, in which he paid a splendid trib
ute to the "Mother of the University"
by telling of her noble nature and
many good deeds, ller devotion to the
University and self-sacrifice in its in
terests were dwelt upon by Dr. Gard
tier. He told how, Senator Stanford
having left his property in trust with
her, it fell to her lot to make the final
gift to Stanford.
Mrs. Stanford's interest in religious
work and in charity formed a further
subject of comment by the Chaplain,
ller methods in such work were char
acterized as very practical, this point
being illustrated by several instances.
The story was told of a former maid
of Mrs. Stanford's to whose aid she
came most efficiently by buying her a
small business of her own.
Dr. Gardner closed with a plea to
the students to consecrate themselves
to the work which Mrs. Stanford was
forced to leave unfinished, of making
Stanford the greatest university in the
land.
