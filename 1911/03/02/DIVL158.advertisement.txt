Some cigarettes may be
Greek to you but in plain
English—Fatimas are Good.
No language can quite
describe them—can quite
describe that "distinctly dif
ferent" taste.
But college men have a
language of their own and
their appreciation is ex
pressed in the number of
Fatimas they smoke.
20 for 1 5 cents. Packed
inexpensively, and you get
1 0 additional.
