# CHIEF FORESTER GRAVES WILL VISIT STANFORD
## PINCHOT'S SUCCESSOR TO ADDRESS STUDENTS. Forestry Club Arranges for Important Series of Lectures by Noted Foresters. 
### 
H. S. Graves, successor to Gifford
Pinchot as Chief Forester of the Unit
ed States, is coming to Stanford.
Mr. Graves will visit the fourth dis
trict of the Forest Service, the oflices
of which are in San Francisco, about
the middle of March. He has offered
to come to the campus and address the
forestry students and others interested
in the subject. Needless to say, the
offer has been promptly accepted,
through L. R. Abrams, Assistant Pro
fessor of Botany. The subject of his
address will be "Preparation for For
estry."
Before his appointment as Chief
Forester, Mr. Graves was head of the
Yale Forestry School, and as such was
one of the pioneers in the movement
for technical education in forestry in
the United States. He was identified
with the Forestry Service for many
years before he became head of the
Yale school.
The Yale Forestry School was es
tablished by the Pinchot family and
the sympathies of the Chief Forester
for the policies of Gifford Pinchot are
well known. Graves has been identi
fied . ith the cons-xvation movement
practically since its inception.
Through the Forestry Club, a series
of addresses by practical foresters, no
less interesting have also been arrang
ed. Chief Forester Graves has con
sented to allow members of the
fourth district of the service to give
informal talks to the members of the
club and others interested.
The first of these was given last ev
ening by Associate District Forester
Du Bois of the San Francisco Depart
ment. He spoke on "National Forest
Organization," showing by example
how a homestead application is filed
and acted upon; explained and read a
report for the proposed fire-protection
of the Toulome Reservation, and told
of the inner-workings of the Forestry
Department.
Four other addresses will be given as
follows: March 15, "Grazing," by John
H. 11 at ton, Assistant District Forester;
April â€¢"), "Silviculture," by T. 1). Wood
bury, Assistant District Forester;
April 10. "Law," by M. Dechant; and
May I!, "Forest Products," by C. Stow
ell Smith, Assistant District Forester.
The speakers are men who have had
years of experience in coping with ac
tual forestry problems in the West.
The situation in California is different
from that in any other state and the
addresses should bring to light inter
esting facts in this connection.
The series of addresses by men ac
tually in the field reflects the policy of
the systematic Botany department and
the Forestry Club in keeping abreast
of live issues.
