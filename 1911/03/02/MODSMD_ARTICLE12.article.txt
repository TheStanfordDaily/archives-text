# DR. DAENELL ADVOCATES MORE STUDENT FREEDOM.
## Roosevelt Exchange Professor Speaks Informally to Men in Encina Clubroom. 
### 
Emphasizing the freedom under
which the German college student
lives and advocating the establishment
of a similar system in many Ameri
can universities, l)r. Ernst Daenell,
Exchange Professor to the United
States from Germany, spoke informal
ly to the men of the University in
Encina Clubroom last evening.
According to the speaker, the great
difference between American and Ger
man universities is that in Kaiser Wil
helm's country no examinations are
held until the student is ready to
graduate. The student is placed en
tirely on his own responsibility and
further than getting the signatures of
his different instructors at the com
mencement and close of each semester,
the German college man need never
attend any classroom exercises. The
most severe tests of knowledge are
conducted before the candidate is able
to enter any profession or accept gov
ernment positions.
Dr. Daenell was much impressed
with the big Stanford dormitory and
stated that in his country such an in
stitution for the students was yet. un
known.
