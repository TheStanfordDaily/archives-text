### 
According to the drawings made in
San Francisco last week the Stanford
Soccer team was to have played the
winner of the Vampires-Thistle game
next Saturday in the semi-finals for
the cup. These two teams however,
played a 2-2 tie game last Sunday and
will not play off the draw until the
coming Sunday. Stanford, therefore,
will be unable to play until a week
from Saturday.
The Pastimes and Independents are
scheduled to meet in the semi-finals on
a week from next Sunday while the
final game between the two semi-final
winners will probably be played about
a week later.
Stanford may play its semi-final
game on the campus unless it interfers
too seriously with baseball and track.
Instructor H. W. Maloney desires to
have all men on the field for the next
ten days to keep the first team in good
fighting trim for its coming game.
