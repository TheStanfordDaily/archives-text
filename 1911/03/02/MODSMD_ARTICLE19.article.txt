# STUDENT TAKES EXCEPTION TO DR. AKED'S STATEMENT.
## Member of Lincoln Family Writes Communication Denying Lowly Origin of President.

Editor Daily Palo Alto:
I desire to correct a probably un
intentional mistatement in Dr. Aked's
speech on President Lincoln.
He stated that the President's par
ents were below the level of respect
able poverty, and his father a worth
less idler, but this idea though com
mon, is very unjust.
Within the last ten years papers
and records have been found that
prove the President to have come on
both sides from good New England
stock, both well-to-do and educated
for their day and habitat.
His grandfather, Abraham, had a
farm in West Virginia, which sold for
$10,000 when he moved to Kentucky
with his brother-in-law, Daniel Boone
in 1783, and with the proceeds he
bought 1700 acres of land at Louis
ville and was killed by Indians while
clearing it in 1783. Thomas Lincoln,
his youngest sou, was brought up by
his uncle, Joseph Hanks, who taught
him the carpenter's trade, and when he
married his cousin, Nancy Hanks, gave
him the only wood lathe on the front
ier as part of her dowry; and also a
four post bedstead. .Joseph Hanks was
sufficiently prosperous to go on Thom
as Lincoln's marriage bond of $r>oo,
and left an estate of equal value to be
divided among eight, children includ
ing Nancy, who was known as an
educated girl. Thomas Lincoln was
sufficiently educated to be moderator
of local town meetings and also acted
as deputy surveyor, but like Daniel
Boone and many others he lost the
farms he had developed through the
trickery of land sharks and the revo
cation of land grants by the Kentucky
legislature. The life of the frontier
was rough and crude as we look back
on it, but President Lincoln and his
ancestors were neither paupers nor
illiterate when judged by the stand
ards of their time and domicile.
Facsimilies of some and copies of
the other papers proving this are on
file with the New York Historical So
ciety, and the originals belong to .T.
G. Lincoln of Elkhorn, W. Va., and J.
M. Lincoln of Wareham, Mass.. and r
have seen them while tracing the
President's ancestry.
Trusting that these lines may do a
little to kill a prevalent but incorrect
and unjust belief, I am,
Very tivuly yours,
PRESTON S. LINCOLN, Or.
