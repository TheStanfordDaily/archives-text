# INTERCOLLEGIATE CREWS WILL ROW ON APRIL 15
## VARSITY AND FRESHMEN EIGHTS TO COMPETE ON ESTUARY. Course Lengthened to Three Miles, First Race Will Commence Promptly at 9. 
### 
Saturday morning April l. r > has been
decided on as the (lute of the annual
Intercollegiate Regatta between Stan
ford and California. This decision was
reached at a conference between Cap
tain K. L. Schaupp, '12, and F. L.
Guerena, '11, representing the Cardi
nal, and M. T. Farmer, Graduate Man
ager and Captain Davidson of the Cal
ifornia crew. Complete regulations
governing the regatta were drawn up
The races will be held on the same
course on the Oakland Estuary as
used last spring. The finish will l;e at
the Park street bridge and both Var
sity and Freshmen eights will race
over a course three miles in length.
The first-year race will start at !)
o'clock and will be followed at 10 by
the Varsity crews.
The referee and captains were given
the power of changing the time of
the races on this day it found neces
sary. In case of the breaking ot any
equipment in the boats within the first
thirty strokes, a false start will be de
clared and the crews recalled. A de
lay of fifteen minutes in starting with
out a reasonable excuse will result in
the default of the race by the offend
ing crew.
The course selected was first used
last spring and was found satisfactory
in every particular. The water of
the Estuary at this part is well shelt
ered and no difficulty is to be feared
because of a rough sea. From the
bridge at the finish and from the north
bank a good view of the race may be
secured. The course is visible from
the finish point for almost the whole
length.
The Varsity race this year will be
over a course one mile longer than
last season. The Freshmen crews
last spring were four-oared and
raced for fine mile. The change to
eights admits of the longer race being
contested.
