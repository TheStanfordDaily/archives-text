# SAYS WORLD POWERS ARE SCRAMBLING FOR COLONIES
## DR. DAENELL LECTURES ON IMPERIALISM AND PROTECTION. Emphasizes Germany's Disadvantageous Position in present Struggle of World Powers. 
### 
"Imperialism and Protection," was
the subject of a scholarly lecture de
livered last evening in room 214 of
the History Building by Dr. Ernst
Daenell. With this discussion, the
German Professor concluded his ser
ies of addresses dealing with political
and commercial affairs of Europe and
the world.
Dr. Daenell introduced his subject
by a brief review of commerce from
the incipiency of the free trade move
ment to the present era of Imperial
ism which seems to make protection
necessary.
At the beginning of the nineteenth
century, he stated, a balance of power
existed in Europe and the European
policy, confining the activities of the
great nations to that, part of the world
alone, was effective. About. 1870 the
gradual tendency toward Imperialism
became evident. This policy, Dr. Dae
nell defined as the effort of a country
to bring large districts of the earth
under her economic and political con
trol with the ultimate view of forming
a great self-sufficient unit.
Protection was inaugurated when
the United States and Russia, gaining
mastery of the world's grain market,
set up high tariff walls to prevent im
portation of foreign manufacturers.
The other world powers retaliated in
order to protect their agriculturalists
from the cheap grain Russia and the
United States sent them.
Imperialism followed as a natural
development, France, having been de
feated in Europe by Germany, took up
vast tracts of land in Africa, China
and Madagascar, and sought to render
; herself independent of the other
| powers. England had helped the
South in the Civil War and. fearing an
attempt of the United States for re
venge, carefully organized the Domin
ion of Canada. The plans of uniting
| England's world scattered colonies
would bo met with tremendous diffi
culties, according to Dr. Daenell. It
was his idea that the necessities of
Imperialism are tending to draw Eng
land. who has held out so far. into a
policy of protection.
This great scramble of the world
powers for more territory was caused,
the speaker stated, by their knowledge
that their ultimate position in the world
of equal advancement would be deter
mined by the amount of territory they
acquired which was capable of inde
pendent; development.
Japan entered into a policy of im
perialism in the Russian war by which
she obtained control over Korea and
Manchuria. Dr. Daenell pointed out
that the position of the United States
in the Philippines, had restricted
Japan to confining her expansion to
Korea and Central China.
Germany's imperialistic outlook, he
said, was far from bright as her
chance for expansion in Europe was
practically nil. and her possessions in
Africa and elsewhere widely scattered

and not favorable to development.
What the outcome of protection and
imperialism would be, Dr. Daenell de
clared, no one could state.

policy, confining the activities of the
great nations to that, part of the world
alone, was effective. About. 1870 the
gradual tendency toward Imperialism
became evident. This policy, Dr. Dae
nell defined as the effort of a country
to bring large districts of the earth
under her economic and political con
trol with the ultimate view of forming
a great self-sufficient unit.
Protection was inaugurated when
the United States and Russia, gaining
mastery of the world's grain market,
set up high tariff walls to prevent im
portation of foreign manufacturers.
The other world powers retaliated in
order to protect their agriculturalists
from the cheap grain Russia and the
United States sent them.
Imperialism followed as a natural
development, France, having been de
feated in Europe by Germany, took up
vast tracts of land in Africa, China
and Madagascar, and sought to render
; herself independent of the other
| powers. England had helped the
South in the Civil War and. fearing an
attempt of the United States for re
venge, carefully organized the Domin
ion of Canada. The plans of uniting
| England's world scattered colonies
would bo met with tremendous diffi
culties, according to Dr. Daenell. It
was his idea that the necessities of
Imperialism are tending to draw Eng
land. who has held out so far. into a
policy of protection.
This great scramble of the world
powers for more territory was caused,
the speaker stated, by their knowledge
that their ultimate position in the world
of equal advancement would be deter
mined by the amount of territory they
acquired which was capable of inde
pendent; development.
Japan entered into a policy of im
perialism in the Russian war by which
she obtained control over Korea and
Manchuria. Dr. Daenell pointed out
that the position of the United States
in the Philippines, had restricted
Japan to confining her expansion to
Korea and Central China.
Germany's imperialistic outlook, he
said, was far from bright as her
chance for expansion in Europe was
practically nil. and her possessions in
Africa and elsewhere widely scattered

and not favorable to development.
What the outcome of protection and
imperialism would be, Dr. Daenell de
clared, no one could state.
