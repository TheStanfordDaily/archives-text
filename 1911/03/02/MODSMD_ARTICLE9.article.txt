Away back in the days when Wil
liam Jennings Bryan first began run
ning for president, a studious looking

fellow, whose favorite
study was human na
ture, was daily filling

this column. His editorials were time
ly and readable and he never wrote to
fill space (as some of us have done
since). An attenuated announcement
column gave his pen plenty of room
too. Incidentally he was a member of
the Bryan Club. The editor's name
was Will Irwin.
Anyone picking up a copy of Col
lier's Weekly these days will notice
this same name as the author of a
series of articles which even at first
sight are attractive. If he peruses
them only hurriedly, he will not wonder
that they are attracting nation-wide
attention, and if he studies them care
fully he will instinctively recognise
the author as one of the foremost of
modern journalists. Irwin's series on
"The American Newspaper," is one of
the greatest journalistic classics ever
featured by a leading magazine. No
wonder the National Weekly is ad
vertising it as it has never advertised
before. It is good business if nothing
else.
The public's literature today is the
newspaper. Altho it will not admit it,
its actions, ideas and ideals are large
ly shaped by the daily press. Since
the latter is such a potent force, its
workings should be thoroly under
stood by every reader. The informa
tion should be expert and scientific,
it is the public's right.
Such information is being given ad
equately for the first time by a scien
tist â€”a Stanford man who got his
early training in campus journalism.
Can the Daily Palo Alto be blamed,
therefore, for taking a certain humble
pride in its former editor?
