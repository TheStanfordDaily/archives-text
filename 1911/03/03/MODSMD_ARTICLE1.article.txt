# MAY FORM NEW AUXILIARY SCIENCE ASSOCIATION
## PACIFIC SOCIETIES TO INCORPORATE UNDER AMERICAN ASSN. Coming Session of Coast Scientists Will Probably See Important Step Taken. 
### 
Stanford professors as members of
scientific organizations represented
in the Pacific Association of Scientific
Societies, will take part in a meeting
in Berkeley, March 30 to April 1 in
clusive, that, may result in the forma
tion of a western auxiliary of the
American Association for the Ad
vancement of Science.
Ten of the leading scientific socie
ties of the Pacific Coast are represent
ed in the association, which will meet
for the first time as a body on the above
date. Although the association is less
than two years old, it has a strong
organization, and promises to take a
leading place among national asso
ciations of its character. The Ameri
can association is one of the strongest.
It. is believed that, efforts will be
made at the coming meeting to have
the association incorporated as a
western auxiliary of the American
Association for the Advancement of
Science. If this should be effected,
the association at once would be lifted
to a position among the greatest
scientific bodies of the world.
The societies composing the asso
ciation, nearly every one of which is
represented in the Faculty and among
the graduate students of the Univer
sity, are as follows: California Acad
emy of Science, Western Branch of the
Geological Society of America, Pale
ontological Society of the Pacific, Le
conte Club, Astronomical Society of
the Pacific, Seismological Society of
America, Cooper Club, Pacific Coast
Branch of the American Historical
Society, Pacific Association of Econo
mic Entomology. California Physical
Geography Club, and the Pacific En
gineering Society.
As the meeting is yet a month oft.
the detail plans still are in a formative
state. The general plan of the meet
ing. however, culls for sectional meet
ings of the different societies on two
days, with a general assembly as a
body on one day of the meeting.
Members of the association also are
to assemble at a banquet.
Dr. D. S. Jordan, as president of
the California Academy of Science,
undoubtedly will attend the meeting in
person, or send a representative.
Prof. C. H. Gilbert is librarian of the
Academy. Other members of the
Faculty who are members of the
Academy are: Dr. J. C. Branner, Prof.
F. M. McFarland, Prof. E. C. Starks
and Prof. J. P. Smith.
Among members of the Faculty rep

societies of which they are members
are: Prof. S. D. Townley, Astrono
mical Society of the Pacific and Seis
mological Society of America; Prot.

Special railroad rates to the bay
district from California points have
been obtained for the meeting.
Stanford professors as members of
scientific organizations represented
in the Pacific Association of Scientific
Societies, will take part in a meeting
in Berkeley, March 30 to April 1 in
clusive, that, may result in the forma
tion of a western auxiliary of the
American Association for the Ad
vancement of Science.
Ten of the leading scientific socie
ties of the Pacific Coast are represent
ed in the association, which will meet
for the first time as a body on the above
date. Although the association is less
than two years old, it has a strong
organization, and promises to take a
leading place among national asso
ciations of its character. The Ameri
can association is one of the strongest.
It. is believed that, efforts will be
made at the coming meeting to have
the association incorporated as a
western auxiliary of the American
Association for the Advancement of
Science. If this should be effected,
the association at once would be lifted
to a position among the greatest
scientific bodies of the world.
The societies composing the asso
ciation, nearly every one of which is
represented in the Faculty and among
the graduate students of the Univer
sity, are as follows: California Acad
emy of Science, Western Branch of the
Geological Society of America, Pale
ontological Society of the Pacific, Le
conte Club, Astronomical Society of
the Pacific, Seismological Society of
America, Cooper Club, Pacific Coast
Branch of the American Historical
Society, Pacific Association of Econo
mic Entomology. California Physical
Geography Club, and the Pacific En
gineering Society.
As the meeting is yet a month oft.
the detail plans still are in a formative
state. The general plan of the meet
ing. however, culls for sectional meet
ings of the different societies on two
days, with a general assembly as a
body on one day of the meeting.
Members of the association also are
to assemble at a banquet.
Dr. D. S. Jordan, as president of
the California Academy of Science,
undoubtedly will attend the meeting in
person, or send a representative.
Prof. C. H. Gilbert is librarian of the
Academy. Other members of the
Faculty who are members of the
Academy are: Dr. J. C. Branner, Prof.
F. M. McFarland, Prof. E. C. Starks
and Prof. J. P. Smith.
Among members of the Faculty rep
resented in the association and the
societies of which they are members
are: Prof. S. D. Townley, Astrono
mical Society of the Pacific and Seis
mological Society of America; Prot.
