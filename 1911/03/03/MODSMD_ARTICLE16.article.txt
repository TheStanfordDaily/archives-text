# EASTERN COLLEGE WILL MAKE RADICAL CHANGE.
## Will Confine Work to Special Field of Learning and Raise Salaries of Professors. 
### 
Amherst College has determined to
restrict its work to the field of classi
cal learning and broad culture. Its
future policy, which will be carried
into effect as rapidly as possible, in
cludes the following five propositions,
which are:
That the instruction at Amherst be
a modified classical course.
That the degree of batchelor of
science be abolished.
That the college adopt the deliber
ate policy to devote all its means to
the indefinite increase of teachers'
salaries.
That the number of students attend
ing the college be limited.
That entrance be permitted only by
competitive examination.
This radical departure was an
nounced at a recent alumni dinner, at
which time the President stated that
by next year Amherst would have a
fund of $400,000, the income of which
is to be used fof no other purpose than
increasing teachers' salaries.
