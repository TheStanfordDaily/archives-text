fessor Espinosa related the history of
a queer religious sect known as the
"Flagellants" or "Penitents," among
the Spanish speaking races of Colo
rado and New Mexico. The "Flagel
lants" believe that to enjoy a life be
yond the grave they must suffer keen
punishment, self-administered, in this
world. To this end they strike them
selves upon the back with whips and
sometimes cactus branches. The
carrying of heavy timbers and crosses
constitute further voluntary inflictions
undergone by Los Penitentos. How
ever, according to Professor Espin
osa. the most cruel of these practices
have now been relinquished, by order
of the Roman Catholic Church.
