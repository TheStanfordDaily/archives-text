# "THE SENATOR" TOMORROW NIGHT
## Sophomores to Present Exciting Drama of Washington Political Life in Assembly Hall. Novel Scenic Features. 
### 
With the rise ol the curtain tomor
row evening on the first act of "The
Senator," the University public will lie
introduced to what promises to be one
of the most successful second-year
productions in the history of Stan
ford dramatics. Last evening the
final dress rehearsal was held. Ac
cording to the excellent, work done
then under adverse conditions, the
final performance tomorrow evening
should be more than usually success
ful. All of the acts have been re
hearsed with full properties and
scenic effects at least twice and the
more difficult ones have been gone
over three times.
From the. scenic, standpoint, "The
Senator," will be a distinct departure
from the usual run of local dramatic
presentations. In both the third and
fourth acts, the sets are absolutely
different from anything that has been
given here in recent years. Particu
arly is this true of the third act. In

this scene, the set instead of repre
senting the conventional three sides
of a room, shows the corner only, an
anteroom in close proximity to the
Senate Chamber at Washington, dur
ing the closing hour of a senatorial
•ession. Ortsi'' is heard occasionally
the cry of tne phges calling the absent
Senators to roll call. Inside all is
excitement. The claim upon which
the whole play hinges is about, to he
brought for vote in the Senate.
Through the machinations of a dis
gruntled oflice seeker, the situation is
rendered almost, hopeless until a clev
er woman wins the day with a ruse.
This scene is rendered particularly
effective by the empire swinging doors
which have been incorporated in the
ser.
A few good seats still remain un
sold at Palo Alto and on the campus.
Those which have not been disposed
of by tomorrow evening will be sold at
the box office of the Assembly Hall,
