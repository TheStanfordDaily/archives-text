# "The Senator."

lii "The Senator" the Sophomores
luive an ideal Sophomore play. Sec
ond year productions are always great
favorites with the college public. It
is thru them that most of the budding
Thespians make their debut into Stan
ford dramatics and "break thru" into
bigger company. A Sophomore Play
is Stanford's amateur night and in
variably there are always some good
"professionals" on the bill. Stanford
will be on hand tomorrow evening lo
"size up" the situation and see what
1913 has to offer for the good of camp
us dramatics. The Sophs have an ex
cellent vehicle and ought to make a
hit.
