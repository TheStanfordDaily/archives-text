## NOTED JOURNALIST TO EXAMINE PEACE DATA. Will Remain on Campus for Three Weeks.â€”Is Pleased With Stanford. 
### 
Miss Ida A. Tarbell, the well known
journalist, author of "The Life of Lin
coln," "History of the Standard Oil
Company," and many other works of
great interest, is a visitor to the Uni
versity. She is at present a guest of
the Alpha Phi sortrity and will prob
ably remain on tro campus fo.* about
three weeks. During his time she will
examine the material gathered by Dr.
Jordan and Professor Krehbiel on In
ternational peace and arbitration,
which she may use as the basis of a
series of articles in the American
Magazine dealing with these topics.
She is greatly interested in the peace
movement and has been collaborating
with President Jordan for some time
in work along this line.
Miss Tarbell has been on the campus
since Friday and declares that she
greatly enjoys college life. She at
tended the production of "The Sena
tor" Saturday evening was greatly
pleased by the showing of the ama
teurs. The noted journalist is par
ticularly impressed with the buildings
of the University. In her opinion they
are the most successful attempt to
carry out a harmonious architectural
design in American university build
ings.
As a journalist, Miss Tarbell is also
very much interested in the course in
news writing as given in the Univer
sity. She believes that the universi
ties are not paying enough attention
to journalism, as a study, at the pres
ent time.
It has not been definitely decided
as yet whether or not the articles
spoken of above will appear. It is
largely for the purpose of thoroughly
examining the available material that
Miss Tarbell is here. If it is decided
that the material offers sufficient
ground work upon which to prepare a
series of articles, Mis Tarbell will use
the data already gathered, and will
probably collaborate in the work with
Dr. Jordan.
