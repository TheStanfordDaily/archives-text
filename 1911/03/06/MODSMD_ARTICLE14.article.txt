# HIGHEST HUMAN EFFICIENCY DEPENDENT UPON CHRIST.
## Bishop Bell of Berkeley Preaches on Basis of Spiritual Life. 
### 
"The supreme need of all life answ
ered in Jesus Christ," was the subject
which Bishop Hell drew from his text,
John 15:15, "For you can do nothing
apart from me."
The speaker dwelt upon the spirit
of utilitarianism of our age, which
asks the question, "What will it do?,"
of every new thing or thought. In
this connection he emphasized the
fact that "all efficient development in
highly constructive life is dependent
upon Christ."
He then showed the fallacy of be
lieving religion to be insubordinate
and non-essential, claiming that no
man was truly educated who was not
brought to the door of religious con
viction. He said that the need of re
ligion had its origin in the American
individualistic idea of self-develop
ment, which must be balanced by
ideals of Christian brotherhood and
divinity. "Christ is the eternal pro
test against fractional development.
In conclusion, Bishop Bell said that,
by depending upon Christ in the spirit
ual life, we are brought into "the king
dom of renewed moral being, God's
high will, the passionate purpose of
Christ, and the desire of the holy
spirit."
A solo by Mrs. Robert Reynolds of
Palo Alto and an anthem by the choir
added musical inspiration to the ser
mon.
