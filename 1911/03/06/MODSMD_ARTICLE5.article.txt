# SOPHOMORE PLAY IS SUCCESSFULLY PRODUCED
## SECOND-YEAR ACTORS GIVE ADEQUATE PRESENTATION. Poor Farce Well Acted is Tenor of Criticism.—Actors Uniformally Successful.

1 lie Senator" was a good choice for
a Sophomore play, if one sets aside
the possible educative value of re
hearsing a really fine piece of work,
and regards only the presumable his
trionic capabilities of an untried Soph
omore class. "The Senator" does not
need nor deserve to be acted a bit bet
ter than it was. It contains no trace
of real character drawing, nor any
thing but the most conventional un
folding of a perfectly obvious plot by
means of often tried and always suc
cessfully amusing incidents. It gains
an appearance of action by its per
petual motion, almost resembling at
times a "moving picture show" by its
rushing on and off of characters and
its inconsequent shifting of scattered
episodes. As a play it has no value
whatever, except to give a few mo
ments of relief and relaxation to the
tired business man of Stanford who
"goes to the theatre to be amused."
No actors could wholly fail to give
distinctness and some appearance of
reality to characters so uroadly drawn
and so conventional and familiar.
Such a play, if well written, —and
"The Senator" is well written in spite
of its profusion of soliloquies and
asides, —cannot fail to be diverting;
and amateur actors come the nearest
to seeming like professional players
when they essay such parts.
It is a trifle difficult to see below
the natural appeal of the lines, and
beyond the direction of the coach, to
discover what special prizes the class
of 1913 has to present to the cause of
theatricals at Stanford. With one or
two exceptions, all of the new people
did well; and the exceptions were
only negative, not aggressively bad.
On the other hand, there was no one
who stood out as conspicuously better
than the others. Perhaps the most
successful piece of work was that of
Mr. Brown, who was always complete
ly in his part, and moved, spoke, and
seemed to feel as the old man he was
impersonating should. Very occa
sionally the voice of a younger man
could be heard beneath the old man's
accents but this was the only flaw in
an otherwise excellent portrayal. The
climaxes, of a higher emotional stress
than were demanded of any of the
other characters, were sustained with
perfect control and entire convic
tion. It is not to the discredit of Mr.
Kern that he could not so completely
realize the part of the star and hero
of the piece, Senator Rivers. The part
was obviously written to enable Wil
liam H. Crane to do the sort of things
that he does best, and Mr. Kern is not
Mr. Crane. Hut still Mr. Kern was
distinctly good, and much of the pleas
ure of the evening was due to the sin
cere and whole-hearted way in which
he entered into the spirit of the piece.
Miss Parkinson did well with what
was really a very thankless part. She
had the conventional "bewitching"
smile of the leading lady in stock, but
unfortunately her part compelled her
to look distressed so much of the time
that she seemed to lack variety when
any change of manner would simply
have been out of place. Miss McDer
mott deserves credit for making of
Mrs. Hillary exactly what she was in
tended to be, and doing it with so
much abandon and enthusiasm that
we soon became almost unconscious
of what a cheap and impossible trav
esty of life this quintessence of sus
ceptible young widowhood really was.
Miss McDermott looked, dressed, and
behaved the part for all there was in
it.
These were the "leads," and they
were all well taken, though the minor
parts were done perhaps equally well
so far as they offered the opportunity.
Mr. Gilmore as Count von Strahl made
his personality felt at. once and main
tained the good impression that he
created; Mr. Mathews, in spite of his
voice, was too thoroughly in sympathy
with his part of the Senator's private
secretary, Vance, not to be interesting
and welcome; Mr. Matrin was positive
ly delightful as the unwieldly lieuten
ant; Mr. Scholl won our lasting grat
itude for not making the Secretary of
the Chinese legation talk Pigeon Eng
lish, and came very near to making
the artistic success of the evening,—
but didn't; Mr. Ingraham did what
could be done with the conventional
villain who existed merely as a foil for
the hero; and Miss Thompson, Miss
Long, and Miss Ober carried the re
maining parts with entire success and
as much conviction as the play al
lowed.
