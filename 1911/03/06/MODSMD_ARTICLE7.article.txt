# Welcome
## 
### 
For once we regret that the Daily
Palo Alto is not run on the metropoli
tan plan. If we only published at

other times than "school
days" we might have had
the opportunity of doing

a little act of courtesy at the proper
time. As it is, we offer on behalf of
the Associated Students, a belated
welcome to Miss Tarbell. We wish
to assure her that our greeting, al
though mechanically delayed, is none
the less sincere and hearty. We are
glad to have her with us in our little
"rural" community and we hope that
her stay here may always be a pleas
ant memory to her. Moreover, we
hope that it may be most profitable.
We feel that an author as sincerely
desirous of promoting the peace move
ment as Miss Tarbell could come to
no better place for an inspiration
than the quiet. Stanford farm. We not
only have the "atmosphere" but we
have the leaders.
