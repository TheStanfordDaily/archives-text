bow; Howell, coxswain.
The Freshman crew will be an
nounced tomorrow evening. None of
the new men have rowed in the eight
and Thursday's performance will be
their first trip in the big shell.
Neither wind nor rain has kept the
Varsity and Freshmen crew candi
dates from their daily training 0:1
Lake Lagunita of late. Although
the choppy waters of the lake have
made it impossible to use the shell, the
men are going through their regular
work every morning and evening in
the pair. No further cut. in the Fresh
men list, has b 'en made since the
squad was reduced to twenty-five sev
eral weeks ago and there are about the
same number out for- the Varsity.
There will be n-» more weeding out
until after the Inter-class races on
Junior day. The Freshmen are fast
mastering the fii« points under the
able direction of the coaching com
mittee. The first-year men have been
divided into squads and besides the
regular work in the evenings, each
squad trains two mornings a week.
