# "The Damnuisance".

### 
We would that the power of the
press were greater than it is. We
even wish at the present time that it
had the potential possibilities of an

old rip saw or a
volley of petrified
brickbats. If it had,
the "damnuisance"

would have tolled its death knell long
before this. We know that a former
editor set a dangerous precedent in
inciting a minature riot, but the pres
ent scribe feels almost justified in
urging heroic measures in ridding the
campus of the noisy pest at the Hook
store corner, if the Peninsular Rail
way uot sever it.from its altitudi
nous position muy pronto. Not only
is it useless, but it is a positive nuis
ance. Even as a warning bell it is
bad enough, but when it begins as
soon as the car leaves the Palo Alto
city limits and continues its pestifer
ous clatter during the entire round
trip, only a Madrono inmate can hurl
the appropriate anathema. We feel
very sorry for the Madrono girls. A
street car in the back yard is suffi
cient cause for complaint without all
the - metropolitan appurtenances
thrown in.
We would remind all those in au
thority of what Mrs. Stanford would
think if she were here today. We
know the trolley line in itself would be
offensive to her. Moreover, we would
enlighten the fertile brain who con
cocted the "damnuisance" that his in
vention is an abject failure and that
if he wants to try it out some more to
take it down to Embarcadero Road,
where once in an eon or so it might be
of some service.
