# ORIGINAL WORK OF NOTED ARTISTS NOW ON EXHIBITION
## 
### 
Stanford art lovers need not envv
the privileges of their Eastern cous
ins this week, for they have the priv
ilege of vi«*. nig a splendid exhibition
of paintings secured by the Art Club
from the American Federation of Arts.
The paintings are hung in room 311.
This collection is not only of interest
to the art student because of its varied
illustration of technical methods, but
to the uninitiated owing to the num
ber of widely known artists represent
ed.
y
Foremus; tuuong these, perhaps, are
Colin Campbell Cooper, Elizabeth
Shippen Green, Jessie Wilcox Smith,
and Blanche Dillaye. Among the
fifty-one paintings by those and other
leaders in the field of art are found
examples of the "scrubbed' water
color, the newest development in that
line, opique and distemper work, and
combinations with charcoal, pastel
and oil. This varied method of treat
ment together with the uniformly high
character of the work make the col
lection rank slightly above the aver
age annual exhibition which it is pos
sible to see in the west.
Cooper has three paintings in the
collection, entitled "Zurich Lake,"
"Old Houses, Laufenburg," and "Ba
loon Ascension Lisieux, France.'
r
The last two are particularly notable
because of the quaint houses protray
ed. and are excellent specimens of (he
field in which the artist won his great

est honors, the painting of American
and European cities. Four works are
shown by Elizabeth Shippen Green,
called "The Rose Bush," "The Boy
and the Flowers," "The Green House,"
and "A Strangr Company," this last
a particularly noteworthy effort.
The other great American woman
illustrator, Jessie Wilcox Smith, has
two paintings from her "Child Calen
dar." Miss Blanch Dillaye, a recipient
of many prizes in the field of etching
and water color, contributes three
works, of which one, "Little Venice,
Evening" is rendered particularly
striking by the twilight effect and the
large stone lion in the foreground.
Miss Susan H. Bradley also has three
paintings, all mountain scenes, among
which may be mentioned "On the Di
vide, Santa Fe."
Other splendid works in the exhibit
include an autumn scene by H.L. Mos
er and a water view from the brush of
Lesley Jackson. The remainder of tbe
collection is almost equally note
worthy. An interesting feature is the
wide range of subjects, which run
from tbe American field to the foreign,
exemplified by Cooper's paintings of
Abbeyvitle, France.

Foremus; tuuong these, perhaps, are
Colin Campbell Cooper, Elizabeth
Shippen Green, Jessie Wilcox Smith,
and Blanche Dillaye. Among the
fifty-one paintings by those and other
leaders in the field of art are found
examples of the "scrubbed' water
color, the newest development in that
line, opique and distemper work, and
combinations with charcoal, pastel
and oil. This varied method of treat
ment together with the uniformly high
character of the work make the col
lection rank slightly above the aver
age annual exhibition which it is pos
sible to see in the west.
Cooper has three paintings in the
collection, entitled "Zurich Lake,"
"Old Houses, Laufenburg," and "Ba
loon Ascension Lisieux, France.'
r
The last two are particularly notable
because of the quaint houses protray
ed. and are excellent specimens of (he
field in which the artist won his great

est honors, the painting of American
and European cities. Four works are
shown by Elizabeth Shippen Green,
called "The Rose Bush," "The Boy
and the Flowers," "The Green House,"
and "A Strangr Company," this last
a particularly noteworthy effort.
The other great American woman
illustrator, Jessie Wilcox Smith, has
two paintings from her "Child Calen
dar." Miss Blanch Dillaye, a recipient
of many prizes in the field of etching
and water color, contributes three
works, of which one, "Little Venice,
Evening" is rendered particularly
striking by the twilight effect and the
large stone lion in the foreground.
Miss Susan H. Bradley also has three
paintings, all mountain scenes, among
which may be mentioned "On the Di
vide, Santa Fe."
Other splendid works in the exhibit
include an autumn scene by H.L. Mos
er and a water view from the brush of
Lesley Jackson. The remainder of tbe
collection is almost equally note
worthy. An interesting feature is the
wide range of subjects, which run
from tbe American field to the foreign,
exemplified by Cooper's paintings of
Abbeyvitle, France.
