# MANY EARLY REPLIES TO G. AND M. REUNION INVITATIONS.
## 
### 
Altho the invitations for the reunion
of graduates of the Geological and
Mining department, March 18, have
been out less than a week, about 20
replies have been received, which
seems to assure the success of the
meeting.
Members of the Geological and Min
ing Society, under whose auspices the
reunion will be held, are busy with
plans for the meeting. It is the desire
of members of the society to establish
the reunion as an annual affair.
In all, about 75 invitations have been
mailed to graduates of the department
and those who completed at least three
years of work in Mining or Geology at
the University.
