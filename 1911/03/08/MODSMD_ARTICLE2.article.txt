# VARSITY CREW WILL ROW AT REDWOOD TOMORROW.
## 
### 
The Varsity eight did not make its
scheduled trip to Redwood today, as
the wind yesterday blew the float
from its moorings alongside of the
Lagunita boat house, and all the men
were needed today to get the float
back in place.
The Varsity will make its initiiil trip
to the bay tomorrow afternoon, and the
Freshmen eight which was to go to
morrow will not make the trip until
Friday.
