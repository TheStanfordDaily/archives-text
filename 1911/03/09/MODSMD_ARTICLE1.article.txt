# VARSITY WILL TRY TO MEET NEVADANS AGAIN
## GAME SCHEDULED FOR TOMORROW AT 4:30. Sagebrushers Will Strive to Wipe Out Defeat Administrated by Cardinals in 1907. 
### 
Having l)een forced to postpone the
game this afternoon with the Sage
brush players owing to the non-sym
pathy of the elements, another at
tempt will be made to meet the Neva
da travellers on the local diamond
tomorrow afternoon at 4:30. This will
give the Plainsmen a chance to be
come somewhat acclimated to the low
lands and a better brand of ball should
be forthcoming from the cross-moun
tain players after a night's rest in our
quiet community.
The desert collegians have been
much handicapped as regards prac
ticing as have the locals. While the
Varsity has simply been kept off the
lield by the rains the Sagebrushers
have been kept indoors by the combined
action of snow and rain. Two weeks
ago their difficulties started when the
Nevadan metropolis was blanketed by
a fall of ten inches of snow. This was
followed by ten days of alternate snow
and rain.
This is the first time that the Ne
vadans have come to the Coast to play
the National game. On March 30, 1907
the Cardinal players crossed bats with
them on Mackay Field, then a alkali
diamond, but since sodded. In this
first, game with the Sagebrushers, the
Stanford nine won a 11-0 victory, the
first five innings being blanked before
the Cardinal machine got into action.
The coaching system at Nevada is
similar to that in vogue at Stanford.
Knight, their undergraduate Coach, is
also a member of the Reno faculty and
will play the right garden position and
act as relieving box artist, should this
become necessary. Grayson will open
on the mound with Fletcher wearing
the mask. Bennett, an Ail-American
Rugby player on last summer's tour
to the Antipodes, will play the initial
sack. Delahide will take second and
Sheehy the intricate corner. Nevada's
manager will act as short-stop . The
frontiers will be guarded by Marion,
Henderson and Knight, in the left,
center and right positions respectively.
The Cardinal's line-up will be as
follows: Gillfillan and Ganong, bat
tery; Hall, Cass and Mitchell, saekers;
Terry, short-stop; Collins, Henshaw
