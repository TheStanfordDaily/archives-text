# MARCH SEQUOIA WILL BE OFF PRESS TOMORROW.
## Timely Articles on Athletics and Dramatics.â€”Good Fiction and Verse. 
### 
Most prominent among the contents
of the March Sequoia which will ap
pear tomorrow, is a significent article
by Dr. Frank Angell on "The Passing
of the Paid Coach." It presents in de
tail the reasons actuating the Faculty
Council's recent recommendation for
this innovation of athletics.
J. W. Howell, '12, reviews the forth
coming Junior Opera, "The Uvernian
Princess." It is the first original
opera at Stanford since "Butterfly
Isle," in 1907, and promises to be a
most interesting production. "What
the Exposition in 1915 Means to Stan -
ford" is treated by E. W. Pugh, '11,
and his article proves that it will be
of no light significance to us.
This month's fiction is from K.
Chamberlain, '11, and M. M. Fogel, '12,
and (he verse is contributed by F. W.
Weymouth, '10, and M. T. Dooling, '11.
Editor F. E. Hill, '11, adds some
comments on the athletic situation,
and has also a few words to say con
cerning the Junior Opera. He criti
cises Dr. Elliott's recent pamphlet
recommending a curtailing of student
activities in that the Registrar does
not propose any actual measures to
attain that end.
