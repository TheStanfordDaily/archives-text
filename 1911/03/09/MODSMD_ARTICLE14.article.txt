# GROUP THREE CAPTURES FIRST BASEBALL GAME
## INTER-CLUB SERIES OPENED YESTERDAY AFTERNOON. Victors Play Fast Ball and Win by a Score of 4 TO 1. 
### 
The inter-f rat-inter-club baseball
.series opened yesterday afternoon
with a short game between groups
three and four. Group three with a
team selected from the Delta Upsilon,
Sigma Alpha Epsilon, anil Zeta Psi
fraternities succeeded in defeating a
picked team from Delta Kappa Epsi
lon, Kappa Alpha, Kappa Sigma, and
Beta Theta Pi fraternities by a score
of 4 to 1.
The game was called at 4:30 on the
turf field, and four fast innings were
played before the contest was called.
Owing to the recent rains the field was
quite wet and slippery, which made
the outcome of every play uncertain.
Many of the players in both line-ups
were stars of the recent interclass
series. P. M. Douglas, '13, who twirl
ed for the winning Sophomore nine
again demonstrated his ability to pitch
close to shutout baseball by holding
his opponents to one run. C. J. Staf
ford, '14, who caught for the 1914 team
was a tower of strength behind the bat
for the winners making with Douglas
a very fast battery. W. C. Thiele, '08,
and J. D. Peters, '11, played first base
and short stop respectively for the
victors.
C. H. Shattuck, '12, pitched good
ball for the loosers. C. Robb, '14, was
at the receiving end of the battery.
This was the only game played yes
terday as the contest scheduled be
tween groups 1 and 2 failed to mater
ialize owing to the poor condition of
the faculty diamond.
