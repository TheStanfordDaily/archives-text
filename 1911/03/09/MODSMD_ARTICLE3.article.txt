# FAMOUS CANADIAN WARNS AMERICA OF VITAL DANGERS
## James A. Macdonald Deals With National Issues in Powerful Address at Founders' Day Assembly. 
### 
The nineteenth celebration of
Founder's Day at Stanford University
was made memorable by one of the
most powerful addresses ever deliver
ed at this institution. Jp."iec A. Mc
donald, a Scotchman by ancestry, an
editor by profession, and a statesman
by demonstration, presented with tell
ing force some of the experiences of
Great Britain from which America
may draw lessons of vital importance.
Following a brief introduction in
which he pointed out the peculiar ob
ligations of the University, one of
which he declared to be an enlighten
ed interpretation of history whereby
the experiences of age might be gained
without its infirmities, Macdonald took
up the land problem in Great Britain.
Unjust Land Distribution.
The land situation there was made
extremely acute, the speaker declared,
because of the limited area and the
large population. This condition was
aggravated by the remarkably unjust
distribution of the territory, eighty
per cent of the land of England being
held by three per cent of its popula
tion and one-fourth of all Scotland be
ing in the possession of twelve men.
This shows a condition fully as bad
as that of Ireland.
The inclpiency of this system dates
back to the time when great grants
were made to court favorites and to
influential nobles who were to furnish
soldiers for the king in exchange for
his bounty. Following down the his
tory of land holding, the speaker
stated that the instituting of the fac
tory system took the mass of the peo
ple from the country and concentrated
them in great cities. The depopula
tion of the rural districts caused the
principal portions of those districts
to be converted into great shooting
ranges for the amusement of the Eng
lish nobility and later for the use of
American millionaires.
Situation Similar in I'nited States.
The American land situation, while
as yet not so acute, Macdonald showed
was very similar. The United States
has no dukes to take over great sec
tions of country but she has many
syndicates and corporations which are
even more merciless and mercenary.
The outcry against this usurpation
has been great.
"Why all this Insurgency that swells
and rolls like a stormy sea all the wa.
from Maine to California? Believe me,
it is not La Follette or Cummins or
Beveridge or Murdock. It is not Roose
velt. It is the people. The great
heart of the common ■ pie of the
Republic is rising tip in solemn out
cry and is making protest to their
leaders that the declaration of In
dependence has not been made good."
The second great lesson to be ob
tained from England, the lesson of
citizenship, was next discussed by the
speaker. He declared that England,

as this country, possessed a govern
ment for the people and by the people,
and that this government does not
exist by divine right but depends upon
the canacity of its citizens for ruling
themselves.
Incapable of Self Government.
England's experience in citizenship
furnishes us a warning against the
admission ot alien and undemocratic
elements into our country. By leaving
unrestricted the immigration of races
which have not by temperament or
experience the genius or capacity for
self government, the democracy may
be destroyed from within.
The second lesson of citizenship to
be gained was from the growth of un
wholesome social and economic condi
tions. England's land laws and fac
tory system forced the people into
great cities. In the large commercial
centers monopolies of city land and
property, fostered social vice and de
cay. In the United States thirty-six
and a half per cent of these employed
in various occupations live on land
owned by themselves, in Germany
thirty-nine per cent, in France forty
four per cent and in England only ten
per cent. The slums, according to the
speaker, are a menace to democracy.
England's history presents a warn
ing against enforced emigration. The
vast numbers of stalwart Englishmen
who left that country to seek their for
tunes elsewhere was a great drain on
the vitality of that nation. "Why,"
asked the speaker, "are Americans
crowding from your northern states
into Canada?"
Reaction of War.
The tioivi. warnln™ from Great Brit
ain's experience presented by the
speaker was the destruction of the
best, life of the country by war. The
actual physical reaction upon the pop
ulation of the British Isles was a mat
ter of Macdonald's personal observa
tion. The drawing of soldiers from
England, Scotland and Ireland cost
Great Britain dear. America's civil
war, he said, worked a great injury to
the life of the nation.
The last lesson to be derived from
the experience of Breat Britain were
those of personal character, as shown
in the indomitable pluck of the Eng
lishman and the steady honor and
loyalty of the Scot, and those from in
stitutions, foremost among which is
the school.
"Democracy has not yet made good."
declared the speaker in bringing his
address to a close. "It is for those
who have had the opportunity of uni
versity training to help on the govern
ment. of the people, by the people and
for the people, and it is for them to
see that such a government does not
perish front the earth."
Before the address the Schubert
Club sang and the assemblage was
lead in prayer by Dr. Gardner.

without its infirmities, Macdonald took
up the land problem in Great Britain.
Unjust Land Distribution.
The land situation there was made
extremely acute, the speaker declared,
because of the limited area and the
large population. This condition was
aggravated by the remarkably unjust
distribution of the territory, eighty
per cent of the land of England being
held by three per cent of its popula
tion and one-fourth of all Scotland be
ing in the possession of twelve men.
This shows a condition fully as bad
as that of Ireland.
The inclpiency of this system dates
back to the time when great grants
were made to court favorites and to
influential nobles who were to furnish
soldiers for the king in exchange for
his bounty. Following down the his
tory of land holding, the speaker
stated that the instituting of the fac
tory system took the mass of the peo
ple from the country and concentrated
them in great cities. The depopula
tion of the rural districts caused the
principal portions of those districts
to be converted into great shooting
ranges for the amusement of the Eng
lish nobility and later for the use of
American millionaires.
Situation Similar in I'nited States.
The American land situation, while
as yet not so acute, Macdonald showed
was very similar. The United States
has no dukes to take over great sec
tions of country but she has many
syndicates and corporations which are
even more merciless and mercenary.
The outcry against this usurpation
has been great.
"Why all this Insurgency that swells
and rolls like a stormy sea all the wa.
from Maine to California? Believe me,
it is not La Follette or Cummins or
Beveridge or Murdock. It is not Roose
velt. It is the people. The great
heart of the common ■ pie of the
Republic is rising tip in solemn out
cry and is making protest to their
leaders that the declaration of In
dependence has not been made good."
The second great lesson to be ob
tained from England, the lesson of
citizenship, was next discussed by the
speaker. He declared that England,

as this country, possessed a govern
ment for the people and by the people,
and that this government does not
exist by divine right but depends upon
the canacity of its citizens for ruling
themselves.
Incapable of Self Government.
England's experience in citizenship
furnishes us a warning against the
admission ot alien and undemocratic
elements into our country. By leaving
unrestricted the immigration of races
which have not by temperament or
experience the genius or capacity for
self government, the democracy may
be destroyed from within.
The second lesson of citizenship to
be gained was from the growth of un
wholesome social and economic condi
tions. England's land laws and fac
tory system forced the people into
great cities. In the large commercial
centers monopolies of city land and
property, fostered social vice and de
cay. In the United States thirty-six
and a half per cent of these employed
in various occupations live on land
owned by themselves, in Germany
thirty-nine per cent, in France forty
four per cent and in England only ten
per cent. The slums, according to the
speaker, are a menace to democracy.
England's history presents a warn
ing against enforced emigration. The
vast numbers of stalwart Englishmen
who left that country to seek their for
tunes elsewhere was a great drain on
the vitality of that nation. "Why,"
asked the speaker, "are Americans
crowding from your northern states
into Canada?"
Reaction of War.
The tioivi. warnln™ from Great Brit
ain's experience presented by the
speaker was the destruction of the
best, life of the country by war. The
actual physical reaction upon the pop
ulation of the British Isles was a mat
ter of Macdonald's personal observa
tion. The drawing of soldiers from
England, Scotland and Ireland cost
Great Britain dear. America's civil
war, he said, worked a great injury to
the life of the nation.
The last lesson to be derived from
the experience of Breat Britain were
those of personal character, as shown
in the indomitable pluck of the Eng
lishman and the steady honor and
loyalty of the Scot, and those from in
stitutions, foremost among which is
the school.
"Democracy has not yet made good."
declared the speaker in bringing his
address to a close. "It is for those
who have had the opportunity of uni
versity training to help on the govern
ment. of the people, by the people and
for the people, and it is for them to
see that such a government does not
perish front the earth."
Before the address the Schubert
Club sang and the assemblage was
lead in prayer by Dr. Gardner.
