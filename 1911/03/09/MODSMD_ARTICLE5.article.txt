# JUNIOR OPERA MUSIC IS REHEARSED BY ORCHESTRA.
## Catchy Songs and Dances Gone Over for First Time.â€”Piece Progressing Well. 
### 
Last evening the University Orches
tra played for the first time the music
of the Junior Opera, "The Uverniau
Princess," which has been at the or
chestrator's in San Francisco for the
past weeks. At the close of the re
hearsal, Conductor Bartlett expressed
himself as well pleased with the work
of the men.
The composers of the music, Miss
Mary Herdman, ex-'l2, and J. L. Mac-
Donald, '14, were present at the re
hearsal and both of them were very
enthusiastic both as to the quality of
the orchestration and the work of the
orchestra. The music is extremely
catchy. Each of the twenty numbers
is original and good. They vary from
pure rag time to catchy waltzes and
beautiful songs. Rehearsals with the
full cast and orchestra will be held
next week.
Both the principals and the chorus
have taken excellent hold of the piece
under the able direction of Coach
Bartlett and R. H. Seward, '12. The
lines are already letter perfect and
the music and dances are fast round
ing into finished form. According to
present indications the opera will be
an extraordinary success, well repay
ing the Junior class for the tremen
dous expense for costumes and scen
ery which they have incurred.
