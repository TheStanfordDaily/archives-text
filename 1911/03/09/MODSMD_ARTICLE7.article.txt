We congratulate the University au
thorities in securing James A. Mac
donald to address the students of Stan-

ford University.
Today's was an
ideal Assembly.

An address such as delivered by the
brilliant Canadian, is as welcome as
will be that of Theodore Roosevelt.
Indeed the Assembly program of the
entire semester has been and will be
a real intellectual feast and Stanford
is a lot better for it. For this we have
President Jordan and the Faculty Com
mittee on Public Exercises to thank.
The power of James A. Macdonald
lies in his sincerity. His words carry
conviction because lie speaks his na
ture. He is a native force unspoiled
by time or surrounding conditions.
His is a true eloquence for "true elo
quence indeed does not consist in
speech. It comes if it comes at all
like the outbreaking of a fountain
from the earth, or the bursting forth
of volcanic fires, with spontaneous,
original, native force." It was patriot
ism and self-devotion which spoke at
this morning's Assembly.
As we, on behalf of the Student
Body, have bid our other distinguished
visitor welcome, we likewise extend
the same greeting to Dr. Macdonald
during his short stay on the campus.
We hope he has a most pleasant time.
And before we stop we must tell him
of a fine compliment paid him by our
"other visitor" today. She said, "And
what, is more, he is a real American
democrat." We finite agree with Miss
Tarbell.
