# FRESHMEN AND ST. MARYS WILL MEET TOMORROW
## OAKLANDERS REPORTED TO HAVE STRONG TEAM. Events to be Run, Rain or Shine. Olmstead Will be Unable to Compete. 
### 
Rain or shine, the Freshman track
squad will run against St. Mary's here
on the campus tomorrow. This being
the only competition meet for first
year men, it has been decided to run
them despite the unfavorable weather
conditions.
Little is known of the strength of
the St. Mary's aggregation as these
men have not contested in a meet as
yet this season. Report conies that
they are showing up well in practice,
and that they will bring down a well
balanced squad of good athletes.
The full Freshman squad will be
seen Saturday with some of Ihe men
who have not competed previous to
this time. Dawson, Oeissler and Mc-
Kee will constitute a speedy trio in the
sprints, and their opponents will have
to travel fast to take a place from
them. Smith in the mile should take
bis event, lie is approaching closer
to 4:30 each time he is seen in com
petition.
Boulware has been doing consistent
work in the pole vault, and Knight
showing up well in the broad. The loss
of Olmstead in the weights will be
keenly felt. He is suffering from a
strain in his back, which may prevent
his entering the coming meet with
California.
Captain Bellah wishes it announced
that every Freshman who is to enter
the meet Saturday must be examined
by Professor Long at Encina gymnas
ium before that time. The object of the
test is to keep the men who are sub
ject to heart trouble off the track.
The Varsity squad must also under
go the examination as they will not
lie allowed to run until they have re
ceived their certificate from the Hy
giene department. Professor Long
will be* at his office every afternoon
from 3 until 4, and special arrange
ment may be made if the men can not
set there at that time.
