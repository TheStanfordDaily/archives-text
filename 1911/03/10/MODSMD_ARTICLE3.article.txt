Alive with enthusiasm and the un
dying Stanford spirit, the first annual
banquet of the Stanford Alumni As
sociation washo I ' l . lar_t cvc.il.ic at tlic
Palace Hotel in San Francisco. Nearly
one hundred alumni were present,
representing almost every class that
has gone out of the University, rang
ing from a single representative of the
class of '92, to a large delegation of
last year's graduating class. From
every point of view the affair was an
unqualified success and gave great
encouragement to the Alumni Advis
ory Committee, who planned it, as part
of their campaign to increase the
power and influence of Stanford Uni
versity through a loyal and well-or
ganized alumni. It will undoubtedly
become an annual affair to mark each
succeeding Founders' Day and will
do no small part in the carrying out
of the committee's hopes.
When the menu had been disposed
of W. W. Out h, '95, introduced as toast
nnster of the evening. Dr. Ray Lyman
Wilbur, '96. Dr. Wilbur first called
upon Student Advisor A. E. Roth, '09,
who explained the purpose and work
ings of the University Conference, an
institution perfected since the day of
many of those present, last evening.
Roth was followed by Harold I.
Ciuzan, '06, who told of the progress
a id prospects of the Stanford Union.
Dr. Edward C. Sewall, '98, spoke on
"Educational Ideals," and what they
should mean at the present day.
"The Advisory Board," was respond
ed to by M. A. Thomas, '04, and Judge
Benjamin F. Bledsoe, '96, of the Super
ior Court of San Bernardino County
spoke on the subject, "Alumni."
President David Starr Jordan, dean
of American college presidents in
point of years of service, chose as his
topic the most important recent move
that Stanford has made, the acquiring

of an adequate medical school. He
contrasted the present day require
ments and methods of graduate rnedi
c?.! schools with tho days when he re
ceived his degree of M.L). in the seven
ties. He descried the equipment ol the
Cooper Medical School which now is
Stanford's property, and said Johns
Hopkins received her best students
from it. Though ho said it was un
fortunate that Stanford in her present
period of financial emarassment
should be forced to undertake this
new and heavy expenditure, she had
no other alternative if she wished to
obtain this most valuable property.
Its library is the best west of Chicago,
and its professors are leaders in their
profession.
Horace Davis of the Board of Trus
tees, spoke on "The Alumni and the
University." It was the duty of every
alumnus, he said, to repay when possi
ble the debt he owes his Alma Mater.
He cited as an example Harvard Uni
versity which has received from its
graduates gifts totalling $15,000,-
000. He answered the critics of the
Board's policy of holding large tracts
of land, at present unproductive, say
ing that in the future the lands in
question would be immensely valuable
and would more than repay the Uni
versity for its present loss. He stated
that the attitude of the Board was
most sympathic towards the under
graduates, and that, they would wel
come suggestions from anyone with
the interest, of Stanford at heart. He
was followed by Timothy Hopkins,
President of the Board who spoke
along the same lines.
Dr. Ga.'d::or a-'-' Vice-President
Branner, were called upon by the
diners, and responded with short im
promptu talks. With these, the even
ing's talks closed and the first Stan
ford Alumni banquet came to an end.
