Stanford University has a democrat
ic Student Body. The women are as
democratic as the men. An accusation
that Stanford women as a
Another body are affected, or snob-
Nuisance bish would be unjust. Any
one holding such an opinion
is either unacquainted with those he
derides or else abnormally prejudiced.
Yet despite this healthy state of af
fairs there has been a tendency of
late to take an unjust advantage of
this very democracy—this mainspring
of the Stanford Spirit and the one
common quality which makes life on
the campus as enjoyable as it is. We
refer to the undue interference on the
part of some with the social events at
the various sorority houses —or to
speak plainly—to the "rough-stuff"
which has been "pulled off" by those
not invited to these functions, who
nevertheless, have been quite as faith
ful and conspicuous in their atten
dance as their more fortunate broth
ers in evening attire. Because Stan
ford women are "good scouts," because
they are generous, and broadminded,
too many of their men friends take
these excellent qualities only as a poor
excuse for creating conditions which
they would frown upon in their more
sober moments. This is manifestly
unfair. No matter how extended may
be the interests of the hostesses, they
have a right to expect a certain priv
acy at their social affairs. It. is only
just to allow them this privilege.
Viewed from another angle it is
difficult to perceive the real sport in
any game where the contestants are
unevenly matched. It is easy for
a number of men to break into a house
and make away with or despoil prop
erty, but it is practically impossible
for the owners of this property to
protect themselves from the maraud
ers. It. is difficult to see the real fun
in such a prank.
If for no other reason, however, than
that we owe it to the good nature of
the democratic Stanford women the
"rough stuff" ought to be cut out.
There is a difference between being
an interested, gentlemanly onlooker
and an over-curious, loud-mouthed in

truder. Likewise there is a difference
between receiveing a "handout" and
stealing one.
