Vaudeville ot' the highest order wiil
lie the entertainment offered the pre
paratory school athletes who visit
Stanford for the [nterscholastic meet,
on April Bth. The Stanford Glee and

present their annual show on that

by Track Captain S. H. Bellah, '10.
The Board of Governors of the Inter
scholastic, Association at a meeting on
Saturday, elected . W. Ambrose, '13, to
membership on the Board. Ambrose
has taken considerable interest in
track matters and is an energetic
worker.
Reports from various schools con
cerning the big meet are coming in
daily. Modesto High School expects
to be well represented in the contest.
While not one of the largest schools
in the valley, Modesto has always pos
sessed a strong track team. E. P.
Campbell, '13, probably the fastest
quarter-miler on the Stanford track
comes from Modesto.
In Captain Boone, the valley boys
have a star athlete. Boone heaves the
shot a distance of 4."» feet, while he
negotiates the 440-vard dash in fast
time. Jackrabbits and John O. Miller
have made quite a reputation for the
San Joaquin county in the half-mile
nm. Cooper, a two minute man from
Modesto, could probably give the above
mentioned personages a close call in
their especial event. This athlete
should make a bid for the Stanford
Interscholastlc half-mile record. Rose
and Cooper will endeavor to annex
points for Modesto in the hurdles.
The sensation of the meet may be
the furlong. Turlock expects to enter
Leitzke in this event and as he is
credited with -2:2 for the distances,
his friends expect him to do even time
when he runs on the fast Stanford
oval.
