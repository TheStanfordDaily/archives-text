# DR. MACDONALD SPEAKS TO THE MEN OF ENCINA CLUB.
## Fascinating Discussion of American Politics and International Relations Given. 
### 
Under the auspices of Encina Club,
Dr. James A. Macdonald spoke trÂ»
Stanford men in Encina Clubroom,
Saturday evening. The speaker evi
denced the eloquence, line humor, and
striking personality which character
ized his previous address, together
with a remarkable fund of information
regarding politics and affairs of state
in the United States. Dr. Macdonald
referred among other things to the
unfortified boundary line between this
country and Canada, and enthusiasti
cally expressed his hope that 1914, the
one hundredth anniversary of peace
between the two nations, might lie
marked by the joint establishment of
a permanent court of arbitration. An
interesting discussion of the tariff,
and various internal affairs of the
United States, occupied the remainder
of Dr. Macdonald's time.
