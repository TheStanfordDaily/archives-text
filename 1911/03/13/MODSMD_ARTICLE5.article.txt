### 
Sending the first six men up across
the plate for six tallies the Olympic
Club piled up a lead that the Varsity
ccuM net ever come with the re
sult that the San Franciscans won out
in the same played last Saturday af
ternoon on the turf field, 12-6. The
Wingerl-O added two runs to their total
in the seventh, and four in the ninth.
The Stanford scores were scattered
through the whole game. It was a
contest of hitting. None of the pitch
ers were effective. Van Dyke gave
three hits to five men up in the first;
Enderle replaced him and contributed
eleven more bingles in the rest of the
game; the famous Stanford captain
and pitcher of 1906, D. D. Sales, was
110 better, and was held up for eleven
safeties, of which one was a three
bagger, and two were doubles. It was
simply an off-day for the mound men
on both sides.
Mitchell and Terry both have re
markable records for the game. Each
has a thousand per cent average at bat
for five times up. Mitchell marked up
a triple and double, walked twice and
sacrifice once. Terry doubled, singled
twice, walked twice, and scored two
runs. has a perfect, fielding record.
Mitchell has one bungle against him, a
bad throw. Cass is close to these two
men in excellence. He covered his
base well and secured three hits out
of four times up.
J. D. Rutledge, '11, and Sales made
up a Stanford battery for the men of
San Francisco, while former Coach
Presley, '07, handled the indicator.

Cass and Enderle. Enderle bunted
safely, and, with Terry and Henshaw,
