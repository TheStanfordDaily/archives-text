# FRESHMAN TRACK TEAM OVERWHELMS VISITORS
## ST. MARY'S DEFEATED IN A SLOW MEET. McKee Shows Up as a Promising Sprinter.—Geissler Suffers Serious Breakdown. 
### 
In their last appearance before the
annual Intercollegiate Freshman meet,
the 1914 track men submerged the St.
Mary's athletes on Saturday afternoon
by a score of 65 to 34.
The joy of winning, however, was
dampened by the break-down of Ted
Geissler, oi n of the most promising of
the runners "Dad" had under his
charge. Geissler tore loose the tend
ons of his leg and will not be able
to don a spike again this season. The
accident occurred while the hundred
yard dash was being run off. The
race was between Geissler and Mc-
Kee for first place and they were about
even and within twenty yards of the
tape when Geissler suffered the ac
cident.
Apparently the Cardinal Freshmen
have a surprise in store for the Cali
fornia sprinters, as the class of the
meet on Saturday was McKee's work
in the dashes. He negotiated the hun
dred easily in 10:2, while in the fur
long, ho coasted home with the brakes
on, the watches catching him in 22:3.
Although but a novice on the track,
McKee is Varsity material.
Vlught, the winner of the mile run
for the St. Mary's team, captured ths
race by his ability to sprint. The
Stanford color bearer, Smith, was
ahead up to the stretch when the boy
from across the bay sprinted and won
easily. The winner later attempted
the half-mile and succeeded in captur
ing second place from Glass.
