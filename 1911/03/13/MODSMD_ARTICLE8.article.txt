# Theory and Practice.

Captain Bellah's suspension of a
member of the track squad for an in
fringement of training rules is a con
clusive proof of the theory, that at
Stanford, training is a religion. Al
tho the Track Captain's action was
severe, it was necessary. We hope
that he may not be compelled to so
exercise his authority again.
