The success of the recent banquet of
the Alumni Association means as much
to the undergraduate body as it does
to the graduates. It was largely a
definite expression of an interest in
the welfare of Stanford students and
as such presages much for the future
good of Stanford. There is much
which an Alumni Body con do which
we cannot. It naturally commands
more respect. With this as a starting
point it may be able to accomplish cer
tain needed reforms which mere stu
dents are incapable of realizing —
which of course in not saying that the
mere students do not realize the need
of reform.
The interest of the Alumni in the old
stamping ground is very encouraging.
Power to their arm!
