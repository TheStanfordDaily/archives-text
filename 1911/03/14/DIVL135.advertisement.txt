Some Stanford men made $ 100 a
week last summer with us. This year
we should like to hear from some em
bryonic. Morgans and Carnegies who
desire a business training and need the
money. At our expense, we train
every man in his own territory. Our
proposition is strictly business â€”no
house to house canvassing and no
samples. Write W. E. Judge, 24 Cali
fornia St., San Francisco.
