# COMMITTEE ON STUDENT AFFAIRS STOPS "TUBBING"
## SENDS LETTER TO EACH FRATERNITY. Sound of Running Waters to Have no Terrors for "Frosh" of the Row. 
### 
That the bathtubs on the row must
be shorn of their terror if the fraterni
ties are to continue to exercise the
piivjlege of having Freshmen in their
houses, is the purport of a letter which
is now being transmitted to the Greek
letter societies by the Student Affairs
Committee.
The communication is explained to
representatives from each house at
conferences which have been in pro
gress for some days. That "tubbing"
must be discontinued as an offensive
and dangerous practice, and that uni
formity demands that the same strin
gent regulations against it which are
now in effect in Encina be enforced in
the fraternity bouses, is the gist of the
argument of the committee. The letter
is of some nine hundred words in
length, and set?; forth fully the position
of the committee in regard to "tub
bing" in general, and its status upon
the row in p* rticular.
It first tells of anti-hazing resolu
tions aodpted by the committee in
August, 190!). This was at that time
transmitted to the Student Adviser,
but not made public, in the hope that
the students would themselves cope
with the difficulty. The apparent in
crease of "tubbing," liowevor, led to its
prohitition in the resolution of Sep
tember 2, 1910. So states the commit
tee in its letter, and thereupon
launches into its main argument
against the practice.
"What the committee has chiefly in
mind is this:(1) 'Tubbing' as prac
ticed at Stanford, particularly :it the
beginning of the year, seriously and
unwarrantably interferes with the be
ginning of University work. Aside
from the actual time consumed, in
volving unavoidable absence from Uni
versity appointments, there is institut
ed a mild reign of terror whose in
fluence is sometimes far reaching and
always disconcerting to the proper
beginning of college studies. (2) At
all times there is danger of excess—
excess which means extreme cruelty
of torture, or which is actually dan
gerous to life."
After enlarging upon this point, the
letter discusses the application of the
anti-"tubbing" resolutions to fraterni
ties. "The question is, how are these
regulations to be made effective: par- j
ticularly. how, in the various fraterni- j
ties, is the discontinuance of "tubbing"
to be assured. In the judgment of the
Committee, those in control of each
fraternity are in a position to exercise
the necessary authority and to pledge
strict compliance, within the frater
nity, to the University regulation. . . !
If enforcement is to be left to the i
Committee, the Committee knows of i
bnt one way to do it, and that is to
withdraw from Freshmen the privi
lege of living in fraternity houses.
The committee prefers some other
way, if the fraternities have the same
preference it is up to them to provide
that way."

lege of living in fraternity houses.
The committee prefers some other
way, if the fraternities have the same
preference it is up to them to provide
that way."
That the bathtubs on the row must
be shorn of their terror if the fraterni
ties are to continue to exercise the
piivjlege of having Freshmen in their
houses, is the purport of a letter which
is now being transmitted to the Greek
letter societies by the Student Affairs
Committee.
The communication is explained to
representatives from each house at
conferences which have been in pro
gress for some days. That "tubbing"
must be discontinued as an offensive
and dangerous practice, and that uni
formity demands that the same strin
gent regulations against it which are
now in effect in Encina be enforced in
the fraternity bouses, is the gist of the
argument of the committee. The letter
is of some nine hundred words in
length, and set?; forth fully the position
of the committee in regard to "tub
bing" in general, and its status upon
the row in p* rticular.
It first tells of anti-hazing resolu
tions aodpted by the committee in
August, 190!). This was at that time
transmitted to the Student Adviser,
but not made public, in the hope that
the students would themselves cope
with the difficulty. The apparent in
crease of "tubbing," liowevor, led to its
prohitition in the resolution of Sep
tember 2, 1910. So states the commit
tee in its letter, and thereupon
launches into its main argument
against the practice.
"What the committee has chiefly in
mind is this:(1) 'Tubbing' as prac
ticed at Stanford, particularly :it the
beginning of the year, seriously and
unwarrantably interferes with the be
ginning of University work. Aside
from the actual time consumed, in
volving unavoidable absence from Uni
versity appointments, there is institut
ed a mild reign of terror whose in
fluence is sometimes far reaching and
always disconcerting to the proper
beginning of college studies. (2) At
all times there is danger of excess—
excess which means extreme cruelty
of torture, or which is actually dan
gerous to life."
After enlarging upon this point, the
letter discusses the application of the
anti-"tubbing" resolutions to fraterni
ties. "The question is, how are these
regulations to be made effective: par- j
ticularly. how, in the various fraterni- j
ties, is the discontinuance of "tubbing"
to be assured. In the judgment of the
Committee, those in control of each
fraternity are in a position to exercise
the necessary authority and to pledge
strict compliance, within the frater
nity, to the University regulation. . . !
If enforcement is to be left to the i
Committee, the Committee knows of i
bnt one way to do it, and that is to
withdraw from Freshmen the privi
lege of living in fraternity houses.
The committee prefers some other
way, if the fraternities have the same
preference it is up to them to provide
that way."
