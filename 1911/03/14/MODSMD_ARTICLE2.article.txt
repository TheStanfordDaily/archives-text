# ORIGINAL JUNIOR OPERA PROMISES TO BE HIT OF SEASON
## "Uvernian Princess" Will Be Landmark in Stanford's Dramatic History.â€”Finished Production Assured. 
### 
What promises to be the most suc
cessful and spectacular of any Junior
Opera that has even been presented
at Stanford, will be seen when the
Class of 1912 gives the opera, "The
Uvernian Princess," on the twenty
third of the month. For six weeks,
| constant rehearsals have been held
until now the lines amid music are
j practically letter perfect.
The opera is entirely the work of
local talent. The music was composed
by Miss M. Herdman, ex-'l2, and J. L.
McDonald, '14, while the clever book
was written by J. If. Forbes, '13, For
the work of' amateurs both book and
music are exceptionally good. The
music is original and verv catchv.
while the book is novel and contains
many clever lines, and much funny
business.
The opera is in three acts. The first
two are laid at Stanford, one on the
Quad and the other at the Prom. The
last act is at the mythical land of
Uvernia, somewhere in the South
Seas, where an island principality has
been set up. This principality is a
near Utopia and the happy inhabitants
live in Oriental splendor under ideal
conditions.
It is the last act that is going to be
the most novel and spectacular for the
Stanford theatre goer. The scenery
and costumes which the Committee in
charge promise for this act are infi
nitel.v superior to anything that has
ever been attempted at the University
in the past. The scene will represent
a terrace near the Uvernian palace,
under a tropical moon. Every known
stage effect which it is possible to re
produce at (he Assembly Hall will be
utilized to make this scene realistic
and beautiful.

The costumes which will be used
will be quite as beautiful as the
scenery. The chorus will be ar
rayed in more splendor than they
have ever before worn at a local oper
atic production. Costumes which
graced the San Francisco Kermiss of
last fall have been obtained, after
some difficulties by the committee, and
these wiu be worn.
But the finest costumes of all will
be those worn by the principals. The
rental on single garments for some of
the principals will be as large as the
total costume bill at many a Stanford
production. Some little idea of their
beauty may be obtained from the pic
tures which have been posted on the
Quad. Even these, however, fail to
give an adequate idea of the true
beauty of the costumes.
The music is exceedingly catchy.
Certain songs will be heard around the
campus for many days after tlie pre
sentation next week. Two waltzes are
sure to meet with popular favor. One
of these is called "Waltzing," and the
other is the much heralded, "I Love a
Co-ed."
In the book Forbes has been quite
as successful as have his collaborators
in music. The book is original, it con
tains many comedy parts that are ex
cellent. The last act is a series of
cleverly contrived situations each with
a distinct climax and each leading up
to the real climax of fhe act, and of
the play.
Seats will go on sale next Friday,
instead of Monday as has been the cus
tom in the past. They will sell at the
usual rales of one dollar, seventy-five
and fifty cents, and can be obtained
either at the Bookstore on the Campus
or the Stanford pharmacy in Palo Alto.

two are laid at Stanford, one on the
Quad and the other at the Prom. The
last act is at the mythical land of
Uvernia, somewhere in the South
Seas, where an island principality has
been set up. This principality is a
near Utopia and the happy inhabitants
live in Oriental splendor under ideal
conditions.
It is the last act that is going to be
the most novel and spectacular for the
Stanford theatre goer. The scenery
and costumes which the Committee in
charge promise for this act are infi
nitel.v superior to anything that has
ever been attempted at the University
in the past. The scene will represent
a terrace near the Uvernian palace,
under a tropical moon. Every known
stage effect which it is possible to re
produce at (he Assembly Hall will be
utilized to make this scene realistic
and beautiful.

The costumes which will be used
will be quite as beautiful as the
scenery. The chorus will be ar
rayed in more splendor than they
have ever before worn at a local oper
atic production. Costumes which
graced the San Francisco Kermiss of
last fall have been obtained, after
some difficulties by the committee, and
these wiu be worn.
But the finest costumes of all will
be those worn by the principals. The
rental on single garments for some of
the principals will be as large as the
total costume bill at many a Stanford
production. Some little idea of their
beauty may be obtained from the pic
tures which have been posted on the
Quad. Even these, however, fail to
give an adequate idea of the true
beauty of the costumes.
The music is exceedingly catchy.
Certain songs will be heard around the
campus for many days after tlie pre
sentation next week. Two waltzes are
sure to meet with popular favor. One
of these is called "Waltzing," and the
other is the much heralded, "I Love a
Co-ed."
In the book Forbes has been quite
as successful as have his collaborators
in music. The book is original, it con
tains many comedy parts that are ex
cellent. The last act is a series of
cleverly contrived situations each with
a distinct climax and each leading up
to the real climax of fhe act, and of
the play.
Seats will go on sale next Friday,
instead of Monday as has been the cus
tom in the past. They will sell at the
usual rales of one dollar, seventy-five
and fifty cents, and can be obtained
either at the Bookstore on the Campus
or the Stanford pharmacy in Palo Alto.

What promises to be the most suc
cessful and spectacular of any Junior
Opera that has even been presented
at Stanford, will be seen when the
Class of 1912 gives the opera, "The
Uvernian Princess," on the twenty
third of the month. For six weeks,
| constant rehearsals have been held
until now the lines amid music are
j practically letter perfect.
The opera is entirely the work of
local talent. The music was composed
by Miss M. Herdman, ex-'l2, and J. L.
McDonald, '14, while the clever book
was written by J. If. Forbes, '13, For
the work of' amateurs both book and
music are exceptionally good. The
music is original and verv catchv.
while the book is novel and contains
many clever lines, and much funny
business.
The opera is in three acts. The first
two are laid at Stanford, one on the
Quad and the other at the Prom. The
