# "FREE SHOW" TO CLIMAX SATURDAY'S ATTRACTIONS
## WOMEN'S LEAGUE WILL ENTERTAIN IN ASSEMBLY HALL. Everyone Invited to See Alumni in "Live Wires," After the Track Meet. 
### 
An innovation in Track shows is to
be made next Saturday evening when
the Womens' League will entertain the
University public in the Assembly Hall
with a farce, entitled, "Live Wires,"
given by the Collegiate Alumnae of
San Francisco. No admission will be
charged.
"Live Wires" is a screamingly funny
farce which has been presented by the
alumnae with great success before the
Century Club of San Francisco and at
Hearst Hall in Berkeley. The cast, of
the play is composed of many well
known Stanford women. It will be an
nounced later.
The League was exceptionally lucky
in procuring such an excellent enter
tainment for one of its meetings and it
was decided to seize this opportunity
to entertain the University public. As
March 18th is the date set for the
Freshman Track meet on the Stanford
oval, arrangements have been made
for a big crowd and besides the farce,
the Stanford Band and either the Man
dolin Club or Glee Club will appear.
Dr. and Mrs. Jordan, Dr. and Miss
Branner, Prof, and Mrs. Ryan, Prof
and Mrs. G. H. Marx, Prof, and Mrs.
A. B. Clark, Prof, and Mrs. Krehbiel,
Prof, and Mrs. Treat, Mrs. Allan, Miss
Martin, Miss McCracken and Miss
Stoltenberg j>re the partons and pat
ronesses chosen.
An interesting report has spread
around that prominent Senior women
are to usher, and rumor is rife as to
whom will be conceded the honor of
head usher.
ft is definitely stated, however, that
no admission or collection will be
taken and that the 'roughes" need not
wait for the lights to be turned off
before getting good seats.
