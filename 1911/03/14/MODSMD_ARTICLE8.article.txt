The suggestions of E. \V. Pugh in his
article on "Stanford and the 1915 Ex
position" in the March Sequoia need
all the publicity they can
A Mint get. The most pertinent
perhaps, and yet one almost
ideal in its nature, is that advising
that there he no vestage of the 1906
earthquake left when the exposition
opens its gates. Would that that ideal
might he realized!
It will he well to strive for this
ideal even at the expense of something
else. It will be a good wager that
there will be no signs of that, fateful
April 18th in San Francisco four years
from now. The country should keep
pace with the metropolis. Stanford
should "put on as good a front" as the
surrounding regions when the world
pays its visit to the Golden Gate. Tens
of thousands will visit the campus
then and Stanford should personify
Progress to these people. Let there be
not the slightest trace of the "bird
cage ruins of a better day," or the
dismal steel skeleton of one of the
fairest of the houses of worship in
God's country. It will be a shame if
we do not at least have the Memorial
Church restored by 1915. Present pro
gress is not worthy of comment.
