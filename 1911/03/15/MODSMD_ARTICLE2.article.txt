# NOTED JOURNALIST SPEAKS ON "LINCOLN'S METHODS"
## Miss Ida M. Tarbell Shows Deep Knowledge of Life and Works of Great Emancipator. Mandolin Club Appears.

"With nothing but freedom in his
hands, Lincoln made himself intellect
ually and morally the peer of any man
who has ever lived, in doing it he
gave to us not only a new demonstra
tion of the possibilities of human na
ture, but of the possibilities of demo
cratic government."
This is one of the most pertinent of
' the remarks of Miss Ida M. Tarbell,
in an impressive and thoughtful ad
dress before a special University As
sembly last evening on the subject
"Lincoln's Methods." A deep knowl
edge of the life and work of the Great
Emancipator enabled Miss Tarbell to
present a telling history of the noble
character of whom she has written
such an exhaustive biography.
Following a brief introduction in
which she pointed out the peculiar
tendencies to classify Lincoln as a
national hero, a demagogue, and a
mystic, Miss Tarbell took up the early
life of Lincoln and proved that the
young rail splitter had no extraordi
nary natural equipment, but merely
the qualities of the ordinary American
boy, energy, ambition* common sense
and a love of fair play.
His Early Life.
The future president grew up in a
world of poverty, he had few stimulat
ing influences about him. The con
stant question on young Lincoln's
mind was why this or that was so.
j His mastery of material was so great
i that people were amazed. At eighteen
he understood the fundamentals of
(democracy, the principles and history

lof his country. Lincoln's tenacity of
purpose was well exhibited in the
methods of his law study. He was
greedy for more information of his
subject and no barrier however great,
could keep him from saturating him
self with material.
Why Lincoln is Great
Lincoln early learned that hard
problems are not solved easily. He
regarded slavery as a durable prob
lem to be settled by a long struggle.
His methods in handling men show his
greatness. He had an extra hard task
in selecting his generals and cabinet
officers, but the great man put aside
his own feelings and in the end con
vinced his subordinates and the nation
that he was their superior. Lincoln
was conscious of his own limitations
and no man ever had a juster sense of
value. He took men of all grades at
their real worth and never asked for
more than a man could give. His
method was to hold on to a man until
he proved what he was or was not
worth. The case of Grant was given as
an illustration. One of his chief as
sets was his moral sense. To him the
truth was dearer than personal suc
cess. He is often quoted because of
the tenacity of his opinion coupled
with his faculty of correcting his views
if they were wrong.
Lessons from Lincoln.
Lincoln offers the best example of
how to treat the now vital question of
Insurgency, which is the only real
hope for American democracy. Will
