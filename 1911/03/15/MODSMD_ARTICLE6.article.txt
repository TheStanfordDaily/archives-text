Fearful and wonderful is the
scene beheld in the first rows of As
sembly Hall. A speaker travelling
across the continent
From ;i to address Stanford
Foreign. Shore students must wince
when he comes 011 the
stage and beholds what is before
him. An unexpected sight assails his
gaze. Instead of the uplifted faces of
bright young America, a motley collec
tion of bespectacled, amazingly millin
eried and coiffnred visiages greets
him. Small wonder our speakers
have to keep so close to their manu
scripts! Instead of addressing Uni
versity students they are inspired to
higher things by the thotful citizenship
of Palo Alto. Our Assemblies smack
strongly of overflow meetings of neigh
boring suffrage clubs or improve
ment associations. The Akeds, and
Macdonalds and Tarbells came for an
other purpose.
Our visitors are welcome if there is
room. There usually is room. But an
Assembly is primarily an institution
of University Spirit and that spirit is
broken up by outsiders in tlie body of
the house. Rather have the University
women down stairs, and reserve part
of the balcony for the Palo Alto peo
ple. By such an arrangement we at
least will be freed from those exas
perating hats and remarkable hair
dresses.
