Facts
It must be pleasant work or it would
be impossible to secure 1993 men in
one vacation. Verify the above figures
by calling on me for a copy of our
weekly Bulletin, giving names, ad
dresses and total sales of all the
1910 men. See what they say about
i this advertising work and then get in
your application for territory for 1911.
Last year more than 700 men applied
! loo late for positions.
Call tonight, Friday or Saturday be
i fore 4 o'clock. After that it will be too
I late.
