# ALUMNI ADVISORY BOARD VISITS HERE TOMORROW
## QUESTION OF VITAL INTEREST TO BE CONSIDERED. Campus Eating Club and Contusion Hospital Will Occupy Attention of Board. 
### 
Need of eating clubs and ol' a Uni
versity contagion hospital will be the
reasons for a visit of the Alumni As
sociation Advisory Board to the camp
us tomorrow. These two important
matters along with the desire of the
Advisory Board to get in close touch
with the needs of the undergraduates
and to in turn encourage an Alumni
participation in affairs at Stanford led
the eleven members who constitute
this board to plan a day's visit to the
campus.
The members of the board will
journey to College Terrace in order
to personally see the disadvantages of
tlie lack of proper eating accommoda
tions on the campus. The entire day
will be spent in and around the Uni
versity.
The personnel of the Advisory
Board, each member of which is prac
tically sure to be on the campus to
morrow for the tour of inspection is-
Dennis Searles, '95, President; Dr. T.
