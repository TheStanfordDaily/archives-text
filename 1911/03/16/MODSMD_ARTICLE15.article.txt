(Communication.)
People who have not the privilege
of attending the University have been
sometimes reluctant to obtrude them
selves at student gatherings, even
when the large reputation of the
speakers advertised would seem to
presuppose the courtesy of a general
rather than a purely stuti audience,
it is therefore with reu f and real
gratitude that one notes the generous
invitation extended by the Editor of
the Daily Palo Alto, who assures "the
thotful citizenship of Palo Alto" of a
welcome whenever there is room.
And no one would be more pleased
than these persons to have apportion
ed to them a section of the Assembly
Hall which should be their very own.
The Assembly being, as the public
is delicately reminded by the editorial
in question, "an institution of Uni
versity spirit," it would, indeed, he
appropriate that the best places in the
hall lie reserved for the Student Body,
the men first and then the women stu
dents, leaving, as is suggested, a part
of the gallery for outsiders. Presum
ably the other part of the gallery
could be allotted to the Faculty.
Tn this way Miss Tarbell, who comes
to the Coast to consult with President
Jordan in regard to International
Peace, and Dr. Macdonald, who comes
for his health, and Dr. Aked, who
comes on his own private affairs may
gaze unimpeded upon the bright young
men and modestly-coiffured young wo
men for whom their pearls are more
especially designed, while others may
still have the free right to a seat in the
balcony—inconspicuous, but thorough
ly comfortable. The only objection to
this arrangement—and a serious one
—is that we should thus be deprived of
the running commentary on the ad
dress and the speaker, furnished by
the whispered remarks of the students
sitting behind us. However, even
without this valued accompaniment—
often very racy—we shall be more
than glad to avail ourselves of the
opportunity thus courteously offered.
One of the Spectacled.
