# Vacation Salesmen.

### 
Some Stanford men made $100 a
week last summer with us. This year
we should like to hear from some em
bryonic Morgans and Carnegies who
desire a business training and need the
money. At our expense, we train
every man in his own territory. Our
proposition is strictly business—no
house to house canvassing and no
samples. Write W. E. Judge. 24 Cali
fornia St.. San Francisco.
