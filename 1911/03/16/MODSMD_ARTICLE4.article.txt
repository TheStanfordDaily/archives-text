"On your mark—Set—. Bang went
the report of "Dad's" gun as lie stood
at hundred mark. Six of his thinly
clad charges left their marks and
sprinted down the track.
"Si' isn't that a bunch for you.
If Sm thertim doesn't do :10 flat this
year, , miss my guess. He did a good
:10.1 cnly yesterday, and Coleman is
running right with him too.
"I tell you I never saw a bunch
come through like these fellows have
this season. I didn't think we had
much chance at the first of the season,
but now things look better than ever.
1 nevei had such a bunch of workers.
Why these fellows come around here
every day, rain or shine and I tell
you their work shows it.
"Yes, sir, 1 think we've got some
surprises for the Varsity this year, and
I'm confident now that we'll make a
wonderful showing."
"What do you think of the Fresh
men, 'Dad,' ?" someone asked.
"They're good, but the only trouble
is I'm. afraid we haven't got enough
of them. I believe these fellows can
make this meet closer than any we've
had in years though. There's some
good Varsity material in that '14 class.
"I want these fellows, Varsity and
all, to take care of themselves. We
can't afford to lose any of them and
they've all got to be in the best of con
dition. 1 want them to keep these
training rules religiously and I know
that if they keep up the way they have
been, they'll get another victory on
track this year."
"Dad" had hardly finished when he
pulled out his tape and rushed over to
(ho hammer cage. Woolley had al
most. heaved the weight to the track
on the other side of the oval. After
carefully laying off the distance, he
returned.
"A hundred and forty-eight feet," he
announced triumphantly with a big
broad smile of satisfaction on his face.
