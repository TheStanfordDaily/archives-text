We are glad that our friends from
Palo Alto have such a worthy and
clever spokesman in "One of the Spec-

tacled," whose communica
tion appears in another
column. Such comments

lend greatly to the merriment of (he
nations and incidently make a read
able Daily Palo Alto.
We like a good "come back" and are
glad to publish it. In the same spirit
we quote a few choice ones which our
esteemed contemporary the "Palo Alto
Times" hands us under the caption,
"Persona non Grata."
"Editor Hill of the Dippy allows his
grouch against millinery styles to be
tray him into an unjudicious criticism
of the attendance of Palo Alto people
at Assemblies. He has a lopsided ap
preciation of the stimulating qualities
of a strictly student audience upon
the serious-minded speakers who ad
dress the Assemblies. . . .
"It is very sure that every speaker
would prefer to speak to rows of be
spectacled Palo Alto human curios
than to have their voices echo against
rows of vacant chairs. . . .
"If the 'roughnecks' all want to
bunch together, let them do so. Palo
Alto people would not object to oc
cupying a section reserved for them.
"On second thought we wonder if
(his inhuman attack is not another
oleaginous exhibition of Editor Hill's
relentless hostility to the Peninsular
Railway, which corporation fattens its
purse upon the nickels of the local
bourgeoisie who take this tight-wad
method of getting to the campus en
masse to hear the lectures?"
