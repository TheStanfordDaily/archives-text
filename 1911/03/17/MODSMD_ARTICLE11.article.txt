# The 						Freshman Intercollegiate
## 
### 
The Class of 1914 has done well for
Stanford athletics. Tomorrow it will
go up for its last battle as a class

against the University
of California. The
support of the entire
Student Body is neces
sary for the Freshmen

to do their best. Every man and
woman should be on the bleachers to
morrow afternoon to show the young
est Class that Stanford is behind it
and that its fight is Stanford's fight.
Only in this way can a meet be a suc
cess.
