# Special Exhibition.
## 
### 
Mr. Edwards of J. M. Jacobi & Co.
will be on the campus at the store
next to the Bookstore on Monday and
Tuesday, March 20th and 21st. He
will exhibit an entirely new line of
knit scarfs and take orders for sweat
er coats of new detign and weave for
college men for immediate and fall de
livery. He will also have with him
swatches for Cords to measure and a
full line of full-dress requisites. The
firm of J. M. Jacobi & Co. is well
known, and their reputation for smart,
clever stuff for college men is estab
lished: and it will be worth while for
the Stanford men to take a peep at
their line.
