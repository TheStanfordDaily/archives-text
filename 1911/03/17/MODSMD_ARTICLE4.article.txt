# FRESHMAN INTERCOLLEGIATE TRACK MEET MORROW, 2:30
## Stanford and California Babies [illegible] in Close Contest Varsity vs. Hickey's clickups" in the Forenoon. 
### 
Tomorrow will be a gala day for the
track athletes and enthusiasts. The
Freshman Intercollegiate meet will be
the main drawing card of the day, pre
ceded by the Varsity meet in the morn
ing. The forenoon event will be
against a team to be know'n as
Hickey's "Pickups" instead of with the
Olympic Club as previously announced.
A misunderstanding in the arrange
ments h:>s necessitated this change in
program, and the wearers of the
"Winged O" will not make the trip to
the campus until the following week
end.
In the afternoon, special trains will
convey the Berkeley contingent to the
campus, and the Freshmen of the two
Universities will clash at 2:30 sharp.
What will be the result of the meet?
California, as usual, is conceded an
advantage on the mere fact that its
entry list outnumbers that of its Car
dinal opponents almost two to one.
But indications this year point to a
closer meet than has been seen be
tween the first year men in some
time.
From the 100 to the two mile, every
event, promises a close contest. Cap
tain McKee in the century and Dawson
in the furlong and quarter, should
make a strong bid for first honors in
these events. Woods of California,
who lias a good preparatory school
reputation behind him, will have to
travel faster than he has in the pre
liminary meets this season if he is to
win these laurels for the Blue and
Gold. Meyer will be Dawson's strong
est opponent in the single lap race.
Gard should annex five points for
the Cardinal in the half mile. Griffiths,
who is the best of the California run
ners, ran a poor third in a meet with
the Olympics last Saturday where the
race was won in 2:07 3-5.
Smith and Crabbe will fight, it. out in
the mile, with the advantage, judging
from past performances, slightly in
the California man's favor. Smith is
at his best at he present time and may
spring a surprise tomorrow. The two

mile is essentially Crabbe's race, and
; he is expected to make his best show
j ing here.
Maclise's entry In the hurdle races
i looks like two first places for the Ber
keley team in these events. He has a
! long consistent record backing him,
which places him among the best
1 hurdlers in the state.
The star men in the field events are
Hon 1 ware, who is the sole Cardinal
entry in pole vault, and Rice, who will
represent the team from across the
: bay in the weights. The latter should
: have little difficulty in taking the shot
put, l)iu if Olmstead is in form, he will
j no doubt heave the hammer farther
than his competitor.
five points should be added to Stan
ford's score at the conclusion of the re
lay race. McKee, Dawson, Knight and
one other will probably compose the
! team.
To sum up the situation, the teams
will probably break about even on
first places, and the result of the meet
will depend largely upon the second
and third place men.
