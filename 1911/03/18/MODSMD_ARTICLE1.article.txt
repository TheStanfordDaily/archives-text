An audience of over 3000 people saw
the Cardinal Colors go down to de
feat in the sixth annual Intercollegiate
Freshman Track Meet this afternoon.
The glories of the day go to California,
with three records broken and one
tied, but the hi'.ndful of men represent
ing the class of 1914 gave the best that
was in them.
The day was ideal for good perfor
mances and evidently the weather
suited the California boys. Rice, the
wonderful weight man, is responsible
for the shattering of two of the
records, Maclise set a new mark in the
220-yard low hurdles and Woods the
Berkeley sprinter, equalled Lee Scott's
record of 10:1 in the century made in
1906.
Rice's performances are remarkable
and stamp him as an athlete of the
first water. By capturing two first
places he divided with Deming Ma
clise, the hurdler, the honor of being
the highest individual point-winner.
Paul McKee, the speedy little Cardinal
sprinter, led his men in point winning
by annexing nine and one-quarter
points for the Cardinal team.
MILE RUN.
At exactly 2:33, Phil Wand fired the
shot which sent the Freshman milers
off the mark. Smith (S) and Edwards
(S) sprang into the lead. Manley and
Crabbe of California however, were
holding back. They took the lead in
the second lap and were never headed.
In the third lap, Smith made a strong
bid, but could not pass Manley. The
men finished with Crabbe (C) leading,
Manley (C) by about 1"> yards. Smith
finished 10 yards behind Manley. Time,
4:41.1.

from the mark at the gun, the two men

J-NMTAM) DASH.
This race was one that the Stanford
bleachers awaited with the most in
terest. The Cardinal hopes rested on
Dawson and the result showed they
were justified.
Meyer (C) drew the pole with Daw
son (S) second. On the start, Dawson
took the lead by three yards. Running
strongly up the back stretch, Dawson
retained his advantage and rounding
into the finish, lengthened his lead
slowly. Dawson crossed the line four
yards ahead of Meyers (C). Stammer
(S) took third place, scarcely three
yards behind the doughty Meyer. Stan
ford lost a grand opportunity tio
score three places in this event, when
Richdale tripped over a dog while run
ning in strong on the home stretch.

Stanford man jumped into the lead at
the start, but was passed by a Califor
