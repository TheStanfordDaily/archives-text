An audience of over 3000 people saw
the Cardinal Colors go down to de
feat in the sixth annual Intercollegiate
Freshman Track Meet this afternoon.
The glories of the day go to California,
with three records broken and one
tied, but the hi'.ndful of men represent
ing the class of 1914 gave the best that
was in them.
The day was ideal for good perfor
mances and evidently the weather
suited the California boys. Rice, the
wonderful weight man, is responsible
for the shattering of two of the
records, Maclise set a new mark in the
220-yard low hurdles and Woods the
Berkeley sprinter, equalled Lee Scott's
record of 10:1 in the century made in
1906.
Rice's performances are remarkable
and stamp him as an athlete of the
first water. By capturing two first
places he divided with Deming Ma
clise, the hurdler, the honor of being
the highest individual point-winner.
Paul McKee, the speedy little Cardinal
sprinter, led his men in point winning
by annexing nine and one-quarter
points for the Cardinal team.
MILE RUN.
At exactly 2:33, Phil Wand fired the
shot which sent the Freshman milers
off the mark. Smith (S) and Edwards
(S) sprang into the lead. Manley and
Crabbe of California however, were
holding back. They took the lead in
the second lap and were never headed.
In the third lap, Smith made a strong
bid, but could not pass Manley. The
men finished with Crabbe (C) leading,
Manley (C) by about 1"> yards. Smith
finished 10 yards behind Manley. Time,
4:41.1.
100 YARD DASH.
Woods (C) and McKee (SI sprang
from the mark at the gun, the two men
kept together up to the last twenty
five yards when Woods gained just
enough to give him the victory. Griffin
(C) finished several yards behind the
first two men. Time, 10:1.

Thi.s ties L. S. Scott's record t'or the
hundred yard dash made in 190(i.
120-YARD HHill HI'RLDKS,
As expected, the high hurdles re
sulted in nine points for California.

the way. Emerson (C) and Smythe (C)
finished in the order named. Gilbreath
(S> made a hard fight for third place.
Time 16:3.
J-NMTAM) DASH.
This race was one that the Stanford
bleachers awaited with the most in
terest. The Cardinal hopes rested on
Dawson and the result showed they
were justified.
Meyer (C) drew the pole with Daw
son (S) second. On the start, Dawson
took the lead by three yards. Running
strongly up the back stretch, Dawson
retained his advantage and rounding
into the finish, lengthened his lead
slowly. Dawson crossed the line four
yards ahead of Meyers (C). Stammer
(S) took third place, scarcely three
yards behind the doughty Meyer. Stan
ford lost a grand opportunity tio
score three places in this event, when
Richdale tripped over a dog while run
ning in strong on the home stretch.
TWO-MILE RUN.
Rathbone (C) was easily the class of
' this race, and never was in any danger
of being headed. The California man
| took the lead in the first lap and held
lit the entire race, finishing strongly.
I In the last lap. Rathbone opened up
' the distance between himself and
j Reeves to seventy-five yards. Smith

fourth lap suffering from cramps.

j Norton (C) finished in the last posi
tion. Time, 10:20.
220-YARD DASH.
McKee. the little Cardinal Captain,
i showed the stuff that is in him in this
race. Jumping ahead at the start, he
! soon had a substantial lead which he
ikept. to the tape, revenging himself
for his defeat in the shorter sprint by
| Wood. Griffin of California finished in
'the third place. Time, 22:4.

first place in the half mile run. The
Stanford man jumped into the lead at
the start, but was passed by a Califor
nia youngster on the back-stretch. In
front of the grandstand, Gard regained
his lead, and was never troubled again
finishing with a good margin. After
travelling for a lap and a half in fifth
position, Worthy (S) passed up to sec
ond place on the turn into the home
stretch. Sprinting down to the tape,
h's eas'ly opened up a wide gap be

clise. Emerson (C) won in 28.1.
Halm (Si was second with Basye (C)
third.
Finals—That Maclise would win the
race was a foregone conclusion and
California was conceded the nine
points. Maclise, however, again dem

crossing the line in 25:4, breaking the
old record of 26 seconds, held by Johns
of California. Emerson (C) took sec

in this event, for he is credited with
having made a higher mark in the
earlier part of the season.
RELAY RACE.
Stanford again had her good luck in
the relay, winning by a good margin
over the California runners. Richdale
(S) and Ashley (C) ran the first lap.

ten yards to the good. Stammer (Si

own against Stevens. Captain McKee
(Si assured a Cardinal victory in bis
turn at bat by opening the gap to 25
yards, although Wagenet (C) ran a
good race. Knight (S) took charge of
the last lap with a good lead over
