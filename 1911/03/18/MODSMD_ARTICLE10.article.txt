## Report Concerning Southern Athletes is Erroneous.â€”San Jose and Modesto Entries Received. 
### 
That the Los Angeles High School
will be unable to send a team to com
pete in the Stanford Interscholastic
Pacific Coast Championship Meet was
learned definitely by Captain Bellah in
his recent trip to the south. The re
ports which have been circulated con
cerning the Los Angeles team's attend
ing the California Interscholastic and
not the Stanford meet are wholly with
out foundation.
Ward, a former member of the L. A.
H. S. team, who is at present attend
ing the University of Southern Califor
nia Preparatory School, will enter the
Stanford Meet with a strong aggrega
tion from that institution. He will
also probably be seen in the Berkeley
meet, and it is probably upon this fact
that the erroneous report was based.
The Los Angeles team itself has been
absolutely denied the privelege of en
tering either Interscholastic by the
Board of Education in that city.
Entries are fast being received by
the Stanford Board and a large num
ber are expected to come in during the
next few weeks. Entries from San
Jose and Modesto have been received
within the past few days.
