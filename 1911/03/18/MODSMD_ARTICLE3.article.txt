# VARSITY MEN MAKE GOOD TIME IN MORNING MEET
## TWO STANFORD RECORDS ARE EQUALLED. Coleman Equals Fastest Time in Sprints. — Tallant Does Fine Work in Broad Jump. 
### 
Two Stanford records tied and fast
time made in the remainder of the
track events, was the outcome of this

morning's meet. Af
flicted with a speed
mania, the Varsity
men came out of
their slump and reg
istered the best
marks of the season
on the cinder path.
To T. Li. Coleman,
'12, goes the honor
of equalling the two
records. Runn ing
easily, he covered

the century in an even ten seconds,
while the furlong was negotiated in
twenty-two flat. In both races, he
showed a wonderful improvement in
his starting. To-day's performance
proves how consistently the star
sprinter runs, as this is the second
time within a week that he has covered
the hundred yards in ten flat.
in the hundred, Smitherum forced
Coleman to record time in order to
take first place. The stocky little run
ner crossed the line scarcely a yard
behind the winner.
Stanford will again have a two-min
ute man in the Varsity half-mile run.
Cramer, with no one pushing him, cov
ered the SBO yards in 2:01.4. This is a
reduction of about four seconds over
his best previous time. With his steady
improvement, Cramer should go below
the two-minute mark when he appears
on the California oval.
One of the most pleasant surprises
the meet had in store for "Dad" Moul
ton, was the work of C. H. Tallant, '11,
in the broad-jump. A leap of twenty
two feet, one and one-half inches, was
chalked up against Tallant this morn
ing.
The 440-yard dash gave C. C. Taylor,
'11, an opportunity to shine. The vet
eran finished the distance in 52:1,
without extending himself.
Unless G. L. Horine, '13, clears the
bar around the six foot mark in the
high jump, he is scarcely considered to
be in good trim. This morning Horine
left the field after setting the mark at
six feet, one inch.
No Olympic men appeared on the
track at the scheduled time this morn
ing. so the meet consisted mainly in
competition between members of the
Varsity squad.

Two Stanford records tied and fast

track events, was the outcome of this

morning's meet. Af
flicted with a speed

To T. Li. Coleman,
'12, goes the honor
of equalling the two
records. Runn ing
easily, he covered

the century in an even ten seconds,
while the furlong was negotiated in
twenty-two flat. In both races, he
showed a wonderful improvement in
his starting. To-day's performance
proves how consistently the star
sprinter runs, as this is the second
time within a week that he has covered
the hundred yards in ten flat.
in the hundred, Smitherum forced
Coleman to record time in order to
take first place. The stocky little run
ner crossed the line scarcely a yard
behind the winner.
Stanford will again have a two-min
ute man in the Varsity half-mile run.
Cramer, with no one pushing him, cov
ered the SBO yards in 2:01.4. This is a
reduction of about four seconds over
his best previous time. With his steady
improvement, Cramer should go below
the two-minute mark when he appears
on the California oval.
One of the most pleasant surprises
the meet had in store for "Dad" Moul
ton, was the work of C. H. Tallant, '11,
in the broad-jump. A leap of twenty
two feet, one and one-half inches, was
chalked up against Tallant this morn
