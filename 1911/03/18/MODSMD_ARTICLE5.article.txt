# A 						Good Fight
## 
### 
Every man wearing the Cardinal
colors this afternoon proved himself
worthy of that privilege. Stanford

thinks well of its Freshmen.
They gave the same ac
count of themselves ex
pressed in the terms of the

Stanford Fighting Spirit that every
other Freshman Team has since 1906.
Pitted against overwhelming odds,
they fought as only Stanford men can.
May the same spirit characterize the
remainder of the Track season.
