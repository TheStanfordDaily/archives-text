i npreceuenteu in tut* uisior> oi .iuu
ic»r Operas, the seal sale lor the "Uwr
nian Princess" has demanded ii repro
ductiou of that piece, and tin 6pi>ra
will l; staged for Ihe second time on
Saturday evening- Kvery good seat in
the house was disposed of on the first
morning oi' the sale, and ai present ;i
scat in an: portion of the Assembl>
Hall is hi a. premium.
After ilne consideration, the Junior
Opera Committee lias come to the con
clusion that there is but one mow to
lie made to afford the public another
opportunity to witness the first orig
inal opera that h;is been produced here
in several years. That the "Uvernian
Princess" is written as well as to be
produced by college talent accounts
for the extraordinary enthusiasm
shown over this libretto.
In order to show that the Class of
1H12 is anxious to further a worthy
cause, the proceeds of Saturday even
ing's performance will be added to the
Stanford Union fund. Should the
house be filled, a goodly sum will lie
turned over as a donation from the
Junior Class.
The seat sale for the second pro
duction will begin at S o'clock Thurs
day morning, at both the Stanford
Itookstore and Stanford Pharmacy, and
will be conducted in precisely the siiine
manner as was the original sale last
Friday morning.
Rehearsals for the opera are pro
gressing remarkably well and give
promise of two finished performances
which will reflect great credit upon
those who wrote and composed the
piece, and upon those who will aid in
its presentation. Coach Itartletf has
met with great success in the directing
of the principals, and is especially
pleased with the work of the chorus.
The particular beauty of the piece lies
in the dances and chorus figures, and
much time has been devoted to bring
ing these to a point of absolute perfec
tion. Dress rehearsals are being held
this week with the accompaniment, of
the University Orchestra, and differ
from the final performances only in
that an audience does not grace the
seats of the hall.
