Among the artists whose original

are: \lfred Mast. R. V. Saivator

and numerous modern painters.

of East. This painting is a splendid


THOMAS \\ K l/ION ST IM'IIIII)
bit of art, well exemplifying the tend
encies of the modern English school of
painters.
The gloomy artistry of Salvator
Rosa is manifested in a canvas en
titled "Landscape with Band of Out
laws." Ruskin said of Rosa that he
was a man with a true genius for
painting, and this bit of work is prob
ably one of the finest of his smaller
canvasses. The profound imagination,
massive ruggedness and tragic charac
ter of the artist are seen throughout
the picture.
Rare llobbciiias Exhibited.
Two of the smallest, although among
the most valuable paintings in the en
tire collection are the village scenes,
by Minderhout. Hobbema. These small
landscapes are delightful in their
treatment and show the work of the
master hand. Hobbema was born in
1 <;.°>B and died in 1709: his death prob
ably having been induced by poverty.
The artist was a homeless wanderer,
who realized very little from the sale
of his paintings. After Hobbema's
death, the true merits of his works
were discerned and consequently they
now command an extremely high price
on the market. The poverty of the
painter is shown by the fact, that these
two delightful scenes are painted on
oak panels skillfully joined. The won
derful brilliancy of color and truth to
atmospheric effect and tone gives a
magical beauty to the prosaic scene of
the humble Dutch village.
Old Paintings are Included.
A small painting which possesses a
singular realism to life, is "The Old
Rooster." by Melchoir Hoondecooter,
(1636-1695). The life and color of the
picture and the accurate free style of
drawing make the little painting of
great worth.
Marie Angelica Kauffman (1742-
1807), one of the few women who have
had the distinction of admission to a
membership of the Royal Academy, is
the painter of a graceful picture,
"Cupid Disarmed by Euphrosyne."
Among the more modern artists is
James Giles, R.S.A. Several pictures in
the collection are by Giles and are
considered striking examples of his
style.
The collection contains so many pic
tures of merit that it is impossible to
describe each individually. As it is,
the paintings speak most eloquently
in their own behalf, and to appreciate
their beauties the pictures should be
carefully examined.

THOMAS WELTON* STANFORD.
Thomas Welton Stanford, the Aus
tralian philanthropist, has had an ex
citing and romantic career. Arriving
in California with his brother in 1852,
in the midst of the great gold rush, he
proceeded to the placer region. The
two brothers engaged in mercantile
business in El Dorado and Placer
counties, later removing to Sacra
mento.
While in the mountains, Mr. Stan
ford saved the life of his brother, Le
land Stanford, by nursing him thru
an attack of fever during a serious
I epidemic. This heroic act Senator
Stanford never forgot.
Over forty years ago, when the Aus
tralian gold fields first came into
notice, Thomas Stanford emigrated to
the new mining region. Again he en
gaged in mercantile endeavors and it
was he who introduced the use of oil
lamps and kerosene into Australia.
This act almost, proved the ruination
of the daring merchant, as a ship
bringing a cargo of oil to Mr. Stan
ford was lost en route from the states.
The miners of the district persuaded
themselves, that the introduction of
the lamps was but a clever Yankee
ruse and were on the point of reveng
in gthemselves on the vendor, when,

most opportunely, another cargo of oil
Mr. Stanford is now seventy-nine
years old and during his life in Aus
tralia has accumulated a large fortune.
He has always taken a great interest
in educational matters and devoted
much attention to the welfare of both
Leland Stanford University and the
j Pniversity of Melbourne.
Paintings with an estimated value of
several hundred thousand dollars, j

bit of art, well exemplifying the tend
encies of the modern English school of
painters.
The gloomy artistry of Salvator
Rosa is manifested in a canvas en
titled "Landscape with Band of Out
laws." Ruskin said of Rosa that he
was a man with a true genius for
painting, and this bit of work is prob
ably one of the finest of his smaller
canvasses. The profound imagination,
massive ruggedness and tragic charac
ter of the artist are seen throughout
the picture.
Rare llobbciiias Exhibited.
Two of the smallest, although among
the most valuable paintings in the en
tire collection are the village scenes,
by Minderhout. Hobbema. These small
landscapes are delightful in their
treatment and show the work of the
master hand. Hobbema was born in
1 <;.°>B and died in 1709: his death prob
ably having been induced by poverty.
The artist was a homeless wanderer,
who realized very little from the sale
of his paintings. After Hobbema's
death, the true merits of his works
were discerned and consequently they
now command an extremely high price
on the market. The poverty of the
painter is shown by the fact, that these
two delightful scenes are painted on
oak panels skillfully joined. The won
derful brilliancy of color and truth to
atmospheric effect and tone gives a
magical beauty to the prosaic scene of
the humble Dutch village.
Old Paintings are Included.
A small painting which possesses a
singular realism to life, is "The Old
Rooster." by Melchoir Hoondecooter,
(1636-1695). The life and color of the
picture and the accurate free style of
drawing make the little painting of
great worth.
Marie Angelica Kauffman (1742-
1807), one of the few women who have
had the distinction of admission to a
membership of the Royal Academy, is
the painter of a graceful picture,
"Cupid Disarmed by Euphrosyne."
Among the more modern artists is
James Giles, R.S.A. Several pictures in
the collection are by Giles and are
considered striking examples of his
style.
The collection contains so many pic
tures of merit that it is impossible to
describe each individually. As it is,
the paintings speak most eloquently
in their own behalf, and to appreciate
their beauties the pictures should be
carefully examined.

THOMAS WELTON* STANFORD.
Thomas Welton Stanford, the Aus
tralian philanthropist, has had an ex
citing and romantic career. Arriving
in California with his brother in 1852,
in the midst of the great gold rush, he
proceeded to the placer region. The
two brothers engaged in mercantile
business in El Dorado and Placer
counties, later removing to Sacra
mento.
While in the mountains, Mr. Stan
ford saved the life of his brother, Le
land Stanford, by nursing him thru
an attack of fever during a serious
I epidemic. This heroic act Senator
Stanford never forgot.
Over forty years ago, when the Aus
tralian gold fields first came into
notice, Thomas Stanford emigrated to
the new mining region. Again he en
gaged in mercantile endeavors and it
was he who introduced the use of oil
lamps and kerosene into Australia.
This act almost, proved the ruination
of the daring merchant, as a ship
bringing a cargo of oil to Mr. Stan
ford was lost en route from the states.
The miners of the district persuaded
themselves, that the introduction of
the lamps was but a clever Yankee
ruse and were on the point of reveng
in gthemselves on the vendor, when,

most opportunely, another cargo of oil
Mr. Stanford is now seventy-nine
years old and during his life in Aus
tralia has accumulated a large fortune.
He has always taken a great interest
in educational matters and devoted
much attention to the welfare of both
Leland Stanford University and the
j Pniversity of Melbourne.
Paintings with an estimated value of
several hundred thousand dollars, j
have been added to the art collection j
in the Stanford Museum. The donor

Two of the smallest, although among
the most valuable paintings in the en
tire collection are the village scenes,
by Minderhout. Hobbema. These small
landscapes are delightful in their
treatment and show the work of the
master hand. Hobbema was born in
1 <;.°>B and died in 1709: his death prob
ably having been induced by poverty.
The artist was a homeless wanderer,
who realized very little from the sale
of his paintings. After Hobbema's
death, the true merits of his works
were discerned and consequently they
now command an extremely high price
on the market. The poverty of the
painter is shown by the fact, that these
two delightful scenes are painted on
oak panels skillfully joined. The won
derful brilliancy of color and truth to
atmospheric effect and tone gives a
magical beauty to the prosaic scene of
the humble Dutch village.
Old Paintings are Included.
A small painting which possesses a
singular realism to life, is "The Old
Rooster." by Melchoir Hoondecooter,
(1636-1695). The life and color of the
picture and the accurate free style of
drawing make the little painting of
great worth.
Marie Angelica Kauffman (1742-
1807), one of the few women who have
had the distinction of admission to a
membership of the Royal Academy, is
the painter of a graceful picture,
"Cupid Disarmed by Euphrosyne."
Among the more modern artists is
James Giles, R.S.A. Several pictures in
the collection are by Giles and are
considered striking examples of his
style.
The collection contains so many pic
tures of merit that it is impossible to
describe each individually. As it is,
the paintings speak most eloquently
in their own behalf, and to appreciate
their beauties the pictures should be
carefully examined.

THOMAS WELTON* STANFORD.
Thomas Welton Stanford, the Aus
tralian philanthropist, has had an ex
citing and romantic career. Arriving
in California with his brother in 1852,
in the midst of the great gold rush, he
proceeded to the placer region. The
two brothers engaged in mercantile
business in El Dorado and Placer
counties, later removing to Sacra
mento.
While in the mountains, Mr. Stan
ford saved the life of his brother, Le
land Stanford, by nursing him thru
an attack of fever during a serious
I epidemic. This heroic act Senator
Stanford never forgot.
Over forty years ago, when the Aus
tralian gold fields first came into
notice, Thomas Stanford emigrated to
the new mining region. Again he en
gaged in mercantile endeavors and it
was he who introduced the use of oil
lamps and kerosene into Australia.
This act almost, proved the ruination
of the daring merchant, as a ship
bringing a cargo of oil to Mr. Stan
ford was lost en route from the states.
The miners of the district persuaded
themselves, that the introduction of
the lamps was but a clever Yankee
ruse and were on the point of reveng
in gthemselves on the vendor, when,

most opportunely, another cargo of oil

years old and during his life in Aus

He has always taken a great interest
in educational matters and devoted
much attention to the welfare of both
Leland Stanford University and the
j Pniversity of Melbourne.

several hundred thousand dollars, j

THOMAS WELTON* STANFORD.
Thomas Welton Stanford, the Aus
tralian philanthropist, has had an ex
citing and romantic career. Arriving
in California with his brother in 1852,
in the midst of the great gold rush, he
proceeded to the placer region. The
two brothers engaged in mercantile
business in El Dorado and Placer
counties, later removing to Sacra
mento.
While in the mountains, Mr. Stan
ford saved the life of his brother, Le
land Stanford, by nursing him thru
an attack of fever during a serious
I epidemic. This heroic act Senator
Stanford never forgot.
Over forty years ago, when the Aus
tralian gold fields first came into
notice, Thomas Stanford emigrated to
the new mining region. Again he en
gaged in mercantile endeavors and it
was he who introduced the use of oil
lamps and kerosene into Australia.
This act almost, proved the ruination
of the daring merchant, as a ship
bringing a cargo of oil to Mr. Stan
ford was lost en route from the states.
The miners of the district persuaded
themselves, that the introduction of
the lamps was but a clever Yankee
ruse and were on the point of reveng
in gthemselves on the vendor, when,
ing themselves on the vendor, when,
most opportunely, another cargo of oil
Mr. Stanford is now seventy-nine
years old and during his life in Aus
tralia has accumulated a large fortune.
He has always taken a great interest
in educational matters and devoted
much attention to the welfare of both
Leland Stanford University and the
j Pniversity of Melbourne.
Paintings with an estimated value of
several hundred thousand dollars, j
have been added to the art collection j
in the Stanford Museum. The donor
of this magnificent yift is Thomas Wel
ton Stanford, of Melijourne. Australia.;

.Mr. Stanford has in tin 1 past been
a great benefactor of the rniversitv

name. The large Curtis collection c.l
paintings, containing some sixty spec

been on exhibition at the Museum for
some time past, is also a gift from .Mr.
Stanford, as are the numerous volumes
of Australian books iu the Stanford
Library.

The pictures which comprise the

shortly before the earthquake of 190(1,
and were being limit; in an especially
constructed gallery when the tremen

count of the terrible havoc, wrought at
that time, the paintings were stored
away until suitable quarters could be

the work of framing began again re

Famous liiimKcapes in Collection.
Among the artists whose original
work is represented in this collection
are: \lfred Mast. R. V. Saivator
Rosa. (li'tir»-lfi73), Melchoir Hondecoot
re I 1 ). Mind' rhout Hobbema,
and numerous modern painters.

of East. This painting is a splendid


THOMAS \\ K l/ION ST IM'IIIII)
bit of art, well exemplifying the tend
encies of the modern English school of
painters.
The gloomy artistry of Salvator
Rosa is manifested in a canvas en
titled "Landscape with Band of Out
laws." Ruskin said of Rosa that he
was a man with a true genius for
painting, and this bit of work is prob
ably one of the finest of his smaller
canvasses. The profound imagination,
massive ruggedness and tragic charac
ter of the artist are seen throughout
the picture.
Rare llobbciiias Exhibited.
Two of the smallest, although among
the most valuable paintings in the en
tire collection are the village scenes,
by Minderhout. Hobbema. These small
landscapes are delightful in their
treatment and show the work of the
master hand. Hobbema was born in
1 <;.°>B and died in 1709: his death prob
ably having been induced by poverty.
The artist was a homeless wanderer,
who realized very little from the sale
of his paintings. After Hobbema's
death, the true merits of his works
were discerned and consequently they
now command an extremely high price
on the market. The poverty of the
painter is shown by the fact, that these
two delightful scenes are painted on
oak panels skillfully joined. The won
derful brilliancy of color and truth to
atmospheric effect and tone gives a
magical beauty to the prosaic scene of
the humble Dutch village.
Old Paintings are Included.
A small painting which possesses a
singular realism to life, is "The Old
Rooster." by Melchoir Hoondecooter,
(1636-1695). The life and color of the
picture and the accurate free style of
drawing make the little painting of
great worth.
Marie Angelica Kauffman (1742-
1807), one of the few women who have
had the distinction of admission to a
membership of the Royal Academy, is
the painter of a graceful picture,
"Cupid Disarmed by Euphrosyne."
Among the more modern artists is
James Giles, R.S.A. Several pictures in
the collection are by Giles and are
considered striking examples of his
style.
The collection contains so many pic
tures of merit that it is impossible to
describe each individually. As it is,
the paintings speak most eloquently
in their own behalf, and to appreciate
their beauties the pictures should be
carefully examined.
