# Stanford's Benefactor
## 
### 
Unbounded gratitude goes over the
sea to Thomas VVelton Stanford of
Melbourne, Australia. This great

friend of the University,
the builder of the Stan
ford Library, has given
further expression of his

great regard for this institution, by
presenting it with another collection of
original paintings whose value mounts
up in the hundred thousands. It was
Ibis same generosity 011 the part of his
noted brother which brought the Uni
versity into existence. A like munifi
cence is making it a greater University.
We appreciate what Thomas Welton
Stanford has (lone and is doing for this,
the handiwork of Leland Stanford, and
we honor him for it.
