# NEW FEATURES ADDED TO BIG MARATHON CARNIVAL
## QUADRANGLE CLUB'S EVENT WILL BE IMMENSE. Obstacle Races, Holdover Burlesques and Interclass Relay Will Make Afternoon Joyous. 
### 
Entirely new features and additional
stunts are to mark the presentation of
the annual Irish Marathon as con
ducted under the auspices of the Quad
rangle Club during the afternoon of
Junior Day. The customary relay will
he supplemented by various innova
ations that will make this year's Mar
athon the most extensive and complete
of all that have been held up to the
present time.
Immediately preceding the regular
Interclass event, an old fashioned ob
stacle race will be run, an event that
has never before been seen upon the
Stanford Oval. This piece of entertain
ment has been fully planned and has
been completed In every detail. Ten
or twelve difficulties of every descrip
tion have been introduced into the race
and will provide more than an ordi
nary amount of amusement for the
assembled audience. Some of the Her
culean tasks come as suggestions from
the Antipodes, where the All-American
team indulged in some of the sport
during the past summer. Any addi
tional entires should be submitted to
A. E. Roth within the next few days.
Additional innovations will be in
troduced in various parts of the oval
to keep the crowd amused. The
extra inducements have not as yet
been divulged by the Quadrangle Club,
but they give their assurance that
they will be above the ordinary refined
family vaudeville standard. Only the
very best is to be introduced.
Immediately after the completion of
the former events, the regular Irish
Marathon will be run off in accordance
with the rules and regulations that
usually govern this big athletic car
nival. The teams that have entered
are all unusually well balanced and
the result, should be a strong competi
tion for the possession of the hand
some silver cup that, has been present
ed by the Quadrangle Club to the win
ning team. Unknown to the vulgar
public, the Hold-overs and their num
erous followers, have prepared a team
that, will equal anything previously
presented upon the Oval and will make
its mark in the history of Stanford
teams. Nothing short of the Junior
Opera will lie able to equal the high
character of their special part in the
major event of the afternoon.
All additional entries are to be made
to Track Captain S. IT. Bellah. The
officials who will have charge of the
Marathon have been announced and
are as follows:
Starter. A. E. Roth; clerk of the
course, S. TT. Bellah; assistants. G. A.

Entirely new features and additional
stunts are to mark the presentation of
the annual Irish Marathon as con
ducted under the auspices of the Quad
rangle Club during the afternoon of
Junior Day. The customary relay will
he supplemented by various innova
ations that will make this year's Mar
athon the most extensive and complete
of all that have been held up to the
present time.
Immediately preceding the regular
Interclass event, an old fashioned ob
stacle race will be run, an event that
has never before been seen upon the
Stanford Oval. This piece of entertain
ment has been fully planned and has
been completed In every detail. Ten
or twelve difficulties of every descrip
tion have been introduced into the race
and will provide more than an ordi
nary amount of amusement for the
assembled audience. Some of the Her
culean tasks come as suggestions from
the Antipodes, where the All-American
team indulged in some of the sport
during the past summer. Any addi
tional entires should be submitted to
A. E. Roth within the next few days.
Additional innovations will be in
troduced in various parts of the oval
to keep the crowd amused. The
extra inducements have not as yet
been divulged by the Quadrangle Club,
but they give their assurance that
they will be above the ordinary refined
family vaudeville standard. Only the
very best is to be introduced.
Immediately after the completion of
the former events, the regular Irish
Marathon will be run off in accordance
with the rules and regulations that
usually govern this big athletic car
nival. The teams that have entered
are all unusually well balanced and
the result, should be a strong competi
tion for the possession of the hand
some silver cup that, has been present
ed by the Quadrangle Club to the win
ning team. Unknown to the vulgar
public, the Hold-overs and their num
erous followers, have prepared a team
that, will equal anything previously
presented upon the Oval and will make
its mark in the history of Stanford
teams. Nothing short of the Junior
Opera will lie able to equal the high
character of their special part in the
major event of the afternoon.
All additional entries are to be made
to Track Captain S. IT. Bellah. The
officials who will have charge of the
Marathon have been announced and
