The Faculty Committee on Public
Exercises has acceded to the wish of
the community in restricting the at-

tendance of the Roosevelt
Assembly to the campus
public. By way of show-

ing our appreciation for this kindness
all who are able to secure extra tickets
should give them only to residents of
this community.
