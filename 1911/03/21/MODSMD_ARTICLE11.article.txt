As the plagues of frogs, lice and
locusts did sweep over the land of the
Pharaoh's, so it would seem that the

hand of the Lord is equal
ly against our fair domain,
Such is the plague of

hapless Palo Alto canines that "they
shall cover the face of the earth; they
shall fill thy houses, and the houses of
thy servants, thy men servants and
thy maid servants." Some pessimists
have declared that the campus is going
to the dogs. It is certain that the
dogs are going to the campus. Unless
ihe gates of immigration are quickly
closed it will soon be impossible to
tell Stanford from a pound. Some
thing must be done to restore the land
to its original state.
We hate to arouse the animosity of
that valiant defender of the faith,
The I'alo 1 lld Tiiiirs\ We hate to offend
the tender feelings of our Palo Alto
friends. They are all lovely people.
Hut we must ask them in the name of
all that is good and holy to keep their
dogs at home. Hetween "bespectacled
curios," "damnuisances" and hungry
poodles, there is little peace in the
community. For it must be admitted
these vanguards of Palo Alto civiliza
tion are not conducive to the best that
is in us. And we are sure 110 one
more desires Stanford to turn out
grand men and women than the near
est municipality.
However if the neighboring bour
geoise do not curtail the meanderings
of their stray mongrels, Stanford peo
ple must take summary action. Even
now we are wont to accuse the anat
omy department of a dereliction of its
cadaverous duties. A Palo Alto dog is
as eminently qualified in that depart
ment as the Zeta goat or the Miracle
Play sheep. Surely ho will be more
welcome there than at Assemblies,
plays, track meets, lecture rooms and
formal dances.
