# A 						CROWDED HOUSE WILL SEE JUNIOR OPERA TOMORROW NIGHT
## Dress Rehearsals of "Uvernian Princess" Insure Delightful Presentation of Original Production.â€”Second Performance Saturday. 
### 
Far surpassing even the most, san
guine hopes of its authors, the dress
rehearsal ol "The Uvernian Princess,"
last evening, was a tremendous and
complete success. It was without a
doubt, the most sumptuous and splen
did costuming effect that has ever bean
seen on the Assembly Hall stage. The
last act. was a perfect riot ol' color and
motion. An oriental splendor emen
ated from the costumes and so niied to
permeate the entire act. One after
another the intircate dances went o:f
without a hitch of any lcind. Not even
a signal or word from the conductor
marked the various movements. The
lines were letter perfect and the en
trances and exits cxactlv timed. The
chorus was quite as fascinating as a
chorus can be. It was as complete a
success as one could expect.
Those who had been enthusiastic
front the first as to the opera, left last
evening feeling sure that nothing
could interfere with the absolute suc
c -iis ot the final presentation tomor
row evening. Difficult spots, which
wen slighted at previous rehearsals,
went thru last evening without a pause
of any kind. Everything combined to
nialu it as excellent a dress rehearsal
as one could ask for.
The only thing that was lacking was
the accompaniment of the harp which
the composers of the music have ar
ranged for in the orchestration. To
morrow evening, however, the harpist
a i 11 come down from San Francisco.
This will add a touch to the most beau

tiful songs that will give them a com
plete finish.
One thing which impresses the spec
tator is the large number of dances
which the authors have introduced
thruout the entire work. It has been
their aim to have a dance whenever
one would not be out of place and
there are only a few of the numbers
in which a dance does not play a large
part.
In the title role, .Miss A. Maloney,
'14, does some excellent, work. Her
voice is remarkably sweet and clear,
and is well suited to the solos which
have been given her. Her acting also
is excellent. Miss Maloney is a mem
ber o! Pi Meta Phi.
Playing opposite to her is 11. Cham
berlain, '14, in the part of Ashley
Moore. Although the singing possi
bilities of this part are not very great,
the acting possibilities are unlimited.
As the deliberate, woman-hating,
"rough," Mr. Chamberlain gives a line
bit of work to the Stanford public. He
is a. member of Delta Upsilon, and reg
isters as a special student.
In the second part of Florence Thal
er. Miss E. Coleman, '13, has some fine
chances to display her voice and her
ability both as a dancer and as an
actress. Some of the cleverest and
best work of the entire opera fall to
Miss Coleman, and she carries them all
off without any trouble. Miss Coleman
claims membership in Alpha Phi.
Opposite to Miss Coleman. G. 11.


Miss A. ('. Maloney, '14, in the title role
Beurhaus, '13, will be seen as "Fat"
Tucker. This part is not a large one,
but it is full of good lines and clever
opportunities. None of these slip by
the player of the part. He utilizes
every one of them. Beurhaus is a
member of Phi Delta Theta.
The ingenune part of Alice Martin,
will be played by Miss M. Harrier, '14.
Several clever dances and songs occur
in this part. Miss Harrier exactly fits
into the ingenue role and her clever
work is certain to make one of the hits
of the evening.
J. H. Forbes, '13, the author of the
book, will play opposite to Miss Har
rier in the part of Benny Fay. As the
chum of tlie hero tliis part offers ex
cellent opportunities both singing, act
ing, and dancing. Forbes is a member
of Delta Upsilon, and registers in
Mining.
These are the principal roles. The
minor parts, each one of which lias
been made the most of and interpreted
to the best, advantage are as follows:
E. A. Wells, '11, as "The Frosh;" Miss
L. Stevick, '13, as "Sarah Lincoln;"
Miss H. Gilbert, '12. as "Miss Delia
Knott Thaver;" E. R. Furtig, "The
Professor," "The Mayor;" and K.
Chamberlain, '11. as "Hangar of Uver
nia."
Seats for the second performance go
on sale at the Bookstore and at the
Stanford Pharmacy in Palo Alto to
morrow morning at eight o'clock.
With the exception of a handful of
seats in the curve of the balcony the

Beurhaus, '13, will be seen as "Fat"
Tucker. This part is not a large one,
but it is full of good lines and clever
opportunities. None of these slip by
the player of the part. He utilizes
every one of them. Beurhaus is a
member of Phi Delta Theta.
The ingenune part of Alice Martin,
will be played by Miss M. Harrier, '14.
Several clever dances and songs occur
in this part. Miss Harrier exactly fits
into the ingenue role and her clever
work is certain to make one of the hits
of the evening.
J. H. Forbes, '13, the author of the
book, will play opposite to Miss Har
rier in the part of Benny Fay. As the
chum of tlie hero tliis part offers ex
cellent opportunities both singing, act
ing, and dancing. Forbes is a member
of Delta Upsilon, and registers in
Mining.
These are the principal roles. The
minor parts, each one of which lias
been made the most of and interpreted
to the best, advantage are as follows:
E. A. Wells, '11, as "The Frosh;" Miss
L. Stevick, '13, as "Sarah Lincoln;"
Miss H. Gilbert, '12. as "Miss Delia
Knott Thaver;" E. R. Furtig, "The
Professor," "The Mayor;" and K.
Chamberlain, '11. as "Hangar of Uver
nia."
Seats for the second performance go
on sale at the Bookstore and at the
Stanford Pharmacy in Palo Alto to
morrow morning at eight o'clock.
With the exception of a handful of
seats in the curve of the balcony the
house for the first night is sold out.
Far surpassing even the most, san
guine hopes of its authors, the dress
rehearsal ol "The Uvernian Princess,"
last evening, was a tremendous and
complete success. It was without a
doubt, the most sumptuous and splen
did costuming effect that has ever bean
seen on the Assembly Hall stage. The
last act. was a perfect riot ol' color and
motion. An oriental splendor emen
ated from the costumes and so niied to
permeate the entire act. One after
another the intircate dances went o:f
without a hitch of any lcind. Not even
a signal or word from the conductor
marked the various movements. The
lines were letter perfect and the en
trances and exits cxactlv timed. The
chorus was quite as fascinating as a
chorus can be. It was as complete a
success as one could expect.
Those who had been enthusiastic
front the first as to the opera, left last
evening feeling sure that nothing
could interfere with the absolute suc
c -iis ot the final presentation tomor
row evening. Difficult spots, which
wen slighted at previous rehearsals,
went thru last evening without a pause
of any kind. Everything combined to
nialu it as excellent a dress rehearsal
as one could ask for.
The only thing that was lacking was
the accompaniment of the harp which
the composers of the music have ar
ranged for in the orchestration. To
morrow evening, however, the harpist
a i 11 come down from San Francisco.
This will add a touch to the most beau

tiful songs that will give them a com
plete finish.
One thing which impresses the spec
tator is the large number of dances
which the authors have introduced
thruout the entire work. It has been
their aim to have a dance whenever
one would not be out of place and
there are only a few of the numbers
in which a dance does not play a large
part.
In the title role, .Miss A. Maloney,
'14, does some excellent, work. Her
voice is remarkably sweet and clear,
and is well suited to the solos which
have been given her. Her acting also
is excellent. Miss Maloney is a mem
ber o! Pi Meta Phi.
Playing opposite to her is 11. Cham
berlain, '14, in the part of Ashley
Moore. Although the singing possi
bilities of this part are not very great,
the acting possibilities are unlimited.
As the deliberate, woman-hating,
"rough," Mr. Chamberlain gives a line
bit of work to the Stanford public. He
is a. member of Delta Upsilon, and reg
isters as a special student.
In the second part of Florence Thal
er. Miss E. Coleman, '13, has some fine
chances to display her voice and her
ability both as a dancer and as an
actress. Some of the cleverest and
best work of the entire opera fall to
Miss Coleman, and she carries them all
off without any trouble. Miss Coleman
claims membership in Alpha Phi.
