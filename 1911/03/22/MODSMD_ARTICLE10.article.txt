# Lest We Forget
## 
### 
The gaieties and joys of Junior fes
tivities should not make us unmindful
of the fact that on California Field

next Saturday will be held
the first game of the Inter
collegiate baseball series.
A squad of men who have

worked under such adverse conditions
as have the baseball players this se
mester should be accorded our best
support. A good, lively rooting section
Saturday, will go a long way toward
bringing another series to the Car
dinal.
