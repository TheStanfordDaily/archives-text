Seven men and twenty-two women
was 1 lie grand total attending the Sen
ior Class meeting today. And yet the

women take no in
terest in affairs of

state. It is certain that the Senior
Class would be in a sorry plight if it
were not for the fairer sex. The con
cern which the fourth year men ex
hibit for their Class is scarcely notice

twenty-two might be profitably rein
forced.
