# STRONG INTERCOLLEGIATE DEBATERS ARE SELECTED
## MILLER, HILTON AND PERSONS CHOSEN. Experienced Trio Will Represent Stanford Against Rivals in Debate. 
### 
R. Justin Miller, '11, Frank Howard
Hilton, '11, and Harry Robert Person,
'12, will speak for Stanford against
the Blue and Gold in the seventeenth
annual Intercollegiate Debate on April
14. These men won the honor last
evening, when they entered the lists
against a number of strong speakers
in the tryout contest and demonstrated
their supremacy. T. L. Smith, '14, was
adjudged to approach nearest to their
standard and was given the position of
alternate.
The tryout question last evening
was the same as that of the Intercol
legiate Debate, "Resolved, That the
United States should establish a cen
tral bank, waiving the constitutional
ity of the question." . Miller upheld
the affirmative, arguing that a central
bank system would furnish a central
ized body of banks with a single head,
thus permitting concerted action and
making for an elastic currency which
would obviate financial crises. Miller
furnished a penetrating and well or
ganized discussion of the subject, de
livered in a finished and effective man
ner.
Hilton also spoke affirmatively,
enumerating certain ills of our pres
ent monetary system which would be
remedied by a central bank. He main
tained that such an instution has
worked well abroad, and that the "Aid
rich Plan" is merely a Central Bank in
disguise. His argument and delivery
were both exceedingly effective and
forcible.
Person, the only negative speaker to
win a place on the team, sketched
most convincingly the political ills
which might follow the establishment
of a Central Bank. His argument was
decidedly to the point and was made
more notable by its strong delivery.
Smith, the alternate, is a promising
speaker who showed thoro prepara
tion, a good voice, and adequate vocab
ulary. He also spoke on the affirma
tive.
The judges of the tryout were Pro
fessors F. C. Woodward, R. M. Alden,
and A. C. Whitaker.
The three Intercollegiate debaters of

the year are all talented and exper
ienced speakers. Miller was a member
Jot' the Carnot teams of 1910 and 1911,
j won both the Bonnheim and Peace
j Contests last year, is enrolled in Phi
Alpha Tail, and is credited with other
| forensic and literary achievements.
! Hilton has also captured numerous
I coveted debating honors, belonging to
both his Underclass debating teams,
winning the Bonnheim prize last se
mester and holding a place on this
year's Carnot team. He is a member
of Phi Alpha Tau and President of
Nestoria. Person also debated for his
class in his Freshman and Sophomore
years. All three men are on the mem
bership lists of Nestoria Literary So
ciety and Delta Chi fraternity.
