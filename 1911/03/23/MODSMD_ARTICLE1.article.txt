his journey buck to San Francisco is

planned to have him arrive at the

Class Shell Knees and Special Hand
Concerts at Lake Laguniti at 1:80.
Having rested from the strenuous
happings of the morning, the Junior
Day crowd will be entertained at La
gunita again, this time by the Inter
class shell races. Freshman, Sopho
more, Junior, and Senior fours are
each to race once around the lake
against the watch, in the order named.
The crew making the be.-t time is
awarded the championship of the
University. Last spring the race was
won Ly 1912 in the record time of
4:31. A complete starter, timers and
judges have been appointed and the
Band will be on hand to give a well
chosen program of fifteen popular
airs. The program follows:
(1) March, The Old 13th Regiment,
Cogswell; (2) Dream Waltz., Powell;
(3) March from "Madam Sherry,"

Quadrangle Club Will Have "Thriller"
at Track in Connection With
the Marathon at 8:80.
Crew supremacy having decided, at
three o'clock the scene will be moved
to the Varsity track. Instructions given
by the Quadrangle Club, in charge of
the event, are merely to "follow the
crowd." Here at the Oval at 3:30.
the third annual Interclass race is the
big occurrance. A Marathon race of
six and one-half miles, engaged in by
twenty-six men from each of five class
groups, promises a lively afternoon.
Each man of the twenty-six is slated
to run one lap, a quarter mile distance,
but how the "Holdovers" will be able
to accomplish this fact is not known
at this time. The Holdover team is
the joker in the race, while the four
classes from '11 to '14, will struggle
in dead earnest. A perpetual chal
lenge cup awaits the winner of the
Marathon, and the class numerals will
be inscribed upon it. with the date, to
go down in history. Last year's Mar
athon was won by 1911. in the average
time of 56 seconds.
But before the main event of the
day starts, however, a little recreation
is to be offered to the spectators in
the form of exhibitions of bar-diving, a
potato race, and an obstacle race, such
as originated in the Antipodes. This
latter event is described by the Club
as a "thriller." and decidedly worth
the price of admission, twenty-five
cents. Prizes will be given to the best
men in these events. Chickens will be
chased in the obstacle race. Chicken
dinner will be the prizes.
For the big Marathon there are also
several valuable prizes offered to in
dividuals as a further inducement tu
speed. A gold medal goes to the racer
recording the best, mark 011 the watch.
For the second best time, a silver med
al is reserved.

ent Affair.—(List of Dances
Attractive.
And then all that is left to the Week
is the all-satisfying Prom to be held in
the Encina Clubroom, beginning at
7:4. r > sharp. The dance music this year
is to be decidedly home talent. For
the first time in history, a student or
chestra of nine pieces, led by J. Mac-
Donald, '14, has been chosen to give
the program of fourteen dances and
extras. The engagement cards are
also by Stanford talent, the work of
V. F. Bellows, '09, who has symbolized
the Prom in a pleasing creation of his
crayon. During the two intervals set
aside for supper, Ozier will cater.
The ballroom has been made into a
suitable background for the Prom by
the ten members of the Committee.
Streamers of smilax cover the ceiling
and their beauty is further set off by
over two hundred dozen pink carna
tions. Other details of decoration are
numerous.
