# VARSITY TAKES THEILE'S MEASURE ON TURF FIELD.
## 
### 
Because permission was secured
from the wrong authorities to play
here yesterday, St. Mary's was forced
to call off the game with the Cardinal
at the last moment. A match was se
cured with Theile's Independents to
replace the Phoenix team. Seven in
nings were played, and while the stick
stars failed to shine, yet the workout
for the Varsity was a good substitute
for the usual routine of practice.
