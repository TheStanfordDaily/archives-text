# THEODORE ROOSEVELT PLEADS FOR PRODUCTIVE SCHOLARSHIP
## Ex-President Speaks Earnestly on Educational Needs, to Immense Throng at Junior Day Assembly. 
### 
Speaking to us "with the frankness
of an open nature," the typical Ameri
can, Colonel Theodore Roosevelt,
swayed at will some two thousand
Americans this morning. The Assem
bly Hall was early filled with eager
spectators, anxious to catch a glimpse
of the famous Ex-President, hunter of
lions and "big business." Accompan
ied by the heads of the various Depart
ments of the University, Mr. Roose
velt entered the hall at 10:12.". having
with difficulty escaped from the crowd
in Palo Alto.
A tremendous ovation greeted the
visitor as he made his way across the
stage, every step in the short journey
being quickened with a salvo of ap
plause. Characteristically showing his
teeth in a broad smile, Mr. Roosevelt
seemed not entirely displeased by the
five minute reception given him by the
1 usty-lunged students.
After a short introduction by Presi
dent Jordan, Colonel Roosevelt ad
vanced to the center of the stage,
where he seemed to be quite at home.
From the first word uttered by the
speaker, the audience was his. Clench
ing our lists, when he clenched his,
smiling, when a flicker of smile over
spread his expressive features, Mr.
Roosevelt took command of the hearts
and imagination of his auditors, the
short, expressive words, backed by the
exuberant vitality and striking person
ality of the man, bringing home his re
marks with startling directness. The
following are excerpts from his
speech:
4, lh'e-Lighted" AVitli Cheering.
"Mr. President, members of the
Faculty and of the Student Body: I
wish in the first place to congratulate
California upon the fact of its edit

! eated clas?es having such admirable
i lung power.
"It is a very great pleasure to me to
be here and to realize how close in
j touch the different parts of the world
i are. Now, 1 planned to visit California
1 at this time, over a year ago when I
j was right in the heart of Africa. When
I reached Khartoum T committed my
i self to three invitations —one to come
1 here to California, another to go to
Arizona to dedicate the great irriga
tion dam and third to go out to Chey
enne to celebrate Frontier day.
Must Have Productive Scholarship.
"I have come to speak to you to
day upon the subject "Productive
, Scholarship," of the scholarship of
achievement.
"Now, there are two sides necessar
ily to educational work in this country
of ours. In a democracy there must be
a very wide and broad education or the
democracy cannot live, and while that
education must include the ground
work of a literary education it must
also include far more or it is not edu
cation in the true sense. In other
words, our schools and Universities
must turn out boys and girls of such
type that the men and women of thp

j future shall possess strong characters,
j shall possess common sense and intel
ligence, and that shall be able to hold
| their own individuality in the world.
Yet they must be borne on by the lofty
I idealism which will make them dis
| contented unless they are able to join
with their fellows in making better the
common lot of all. That is the first
• and broadest, need to be met by our
| educational systems. The most essen
i tial thing is to turn out a n.ati or a
; women. A man in the fullest, sense—
a woman in the fullest sense. Unless
we do that, unless we turn out the
right type, then all our material suc
cess will go for nothing, and we can
not have the right kind of material
success unless we have the right kind
of training. There must be a founda
tion for a vocational training where
the boy and the girl shall be trained
towards and not away from his or her
duties iii after life.
Advocates Pursuit of Pure Science.
"But technical training, vital as it is,
i
is not all. What does it matter if
! America lias a good, fine type of model
| citizenship, if it. must import from
i abroad all that ministers to the highest
1 type of cultivation. I want to see this
, nation relieved from the reproach that
'we are a nation that has imported
j our art, much of our science, and
j tends to become one that must im
j port our children. We deserve no
j place in the world of today, if we can
| not produce them all from paintings to
children.
"And so 1 wish to speak today of the
need of having in institutions like this,
a standard of scholarship, such in de
gree and kind as to enable us to turn
out productive scholars not only in
the field of industry and of that kind
of science which is the essence of com
mercialism. but which will enable us
to turn out. productive workers in the
fields of pure art, pure science and lit
erati! re.
He Has an Open Nature.
In discussing tlie possibilities of re
ward in doing work such as the engi
neers on the famous Salt River pro
ject have recently completed, Mr.
Rosevelt told an interesting incident
of his own experience.


THEOBOKK HOOSEVELT.
"At Washington, the government has
the finest collection of mammals in the
world. When 1 came back from Africa
112 gave the collection to the national
museum. It is the greatest collection
of African big game in the world. It
is a more complete collection than is
to be found in the museums of London,
Berlin or Paris.
"The getting of it did not cost the
government a dollar. The expenses
were paid privately by myself and by
other private individuals. We gave it
free to Congress. The only acknowl
edgement that has come so far. has
been thru the introduction of a resolu
tion by a member of Congress from
Illinois. Not Mr. Lorimer. A fellow
statesman of his. The resolution in
effect is. that an investigation should
be held to see if in collecting the ani
mals, I was guilty of any treasonable
or corrupt practice. So far as I am
concerned he is entitled to go on with
the investigation. If he gets me I shall
speak to him with the frankness of an
open nature. Now that was merely
on the side.
Only First Class Work Wanted.
"This University will have come in
finitely short of what you have a right
to expect of it if a century hence it
cannot point to the fact of having pro
duced man after man whose achieve
ments have been in lines that tend for
the cultural development of the entire
nation. And now In striving for that
kind of development, you must remem

ber two things: in the first place, that
|no amount of second class work
j equals the smallest quantity of real
j first class work. The work of which 1
, am speaking must be work of the first
' class or it is almost or entirely value
i less. The work must be done for its
own sake.
Stanford Mail Aids Roosevelt.
"Speaking for work's sake. 1 had
one of your men with me in Africa.
He is back there now. He is what I
am describing to you. His name is
Heller (A. 13. '01). He was not striv
ing to get anything for himself out of
the expedition. It was always my feat;
1 always got the credit and he did
most of the work and he never ex
pected me to say anything about it,
and was much surprised when I did.
The work done there in connection
with mammals derives its benefit, from
the efforts of Heller and the praise is
more due to him than to any other
man.
"Heller did the work because his
heart was in it and he was not con
tented to do less than bis best, and 1
know he did it without thought of per
sonal renown. In the larger field, that
is what 1 wish to see the literary, the
scientific man ,tho historian, and the
artist do, devote himself to his work
for work's sake. You cannot expect a
man to overlook the money side of it,
but he must do honest work."
Praises President Jordan.
"I am proud that my own university,
i Harvard, and that your University
j here have such men as Lowell and
Jordan as Presidents, men who have
| done their full share to redeem Amer
j ica from the reproach of lack of the
type of scholarship of which I speak.
My plea is that we shall turn our at
! tention seriously in these universities
to the production of a condition of
mind in the teaching force, among the
- students and on the outside world,
such that more and more we shall
produce the type of scholars of which
I speak, that more and more we shall
produce the type of scholars whose
I scholarship finds expression in
! achievement of the highest kind. 1
care not whether that scholar becomes
>a great painter or a great scientific
i man, a great writer of any kind. My
plea is for the type of university train
| ing here in America which shall put
America in the field of productive
scholarship, in the field of the scholar
ship of achievement, in the same com
manding position in this line as it now
occupies in the field of science, in the
field of that kind of science which is
directly applied to furtherance of in
dustrial or commercial success."
After the address, Colonel Roosevelt,
accompanied by President Jordan and
Professor E. H. Krehbtel, Chairman of
Ihe Faculty Committee on Public Ex
ercises, took a hurried ride by auto
i over the campus. A short stop was
made at the Delta Kappa Epsilon
house, and lunch was taken at the
Delta Upsilon house. Colonel Roose

In discussing tlie possibilities of re

neers on the famous Salt River pro
ject have recently completed, Mr.
Rosevelt told an interesting incident
of his own experience.


THEOBOKK HOOSEVELT.
"At Washington, the government has
the finest collection of mammals in the
world. When 1 came back from Africa
112 gave the collection to the national
museum. It is the greatest collection
of African big game in the world. It
is a more complete collection than is
to be found in the museums of London,
Berlin or Paris.
"The getting of it did not cost the
government a dollar. The expenses
were paid privately by myself and by
other private individuals. We gave it
free to Congress. The only acknowl
edgement that has come so far. has
been thru the introduction of a resolu
tion by a member of Congress from
Illinois. Not Mr. Lorimer. A fellow
statesman of his. The resolution in
effect is. that an investigation should
be held to see if in collecting the ani
mals, I was guilty of any treasonable
or corrupt practice. So far as I am
concerned he is entitled to go on with
the investigation. If he gets me I shall
speak to him with the frankness of an
open nature. Now that was merely
on the side.
Only First Class Work Wanted.
"This University will have come in
finitely short of what you have a right
to expect of it if a century hence it
cannot point to the fact of having pro
duced man after man whose achieve
ments have been in lines that tend for
the cultural development of the entire
nation. And now In striving for that
kind of development, you must remem

ber two things: in the first place, that
|no amount of second class work
j equals the smallest quantity of real
j first class work. The work of which 1
, am speaking must be work of the first
' class or it is almost or entirely value
i less. The work must be done for its
own sake.
Stanford Mail Aids Roosevelt.
"Speaking for work's sake. 1 had
one of your men with me in Africa.
He is back there now. He is what I
am describing to you. His name is
Heller (A. 13. '01). He was not striv
ing to get anything for himself out of
the expedition. It was always my feat;
1 always got the credit and he did
most of the work and he never ex
pected me to say anything about it,
and was much surprised when I did.
The work done there in connection
with mammals derives its benefit, from
the efforts of Heller and the praise is
more due to him than to any other
man.
"Heller did the work because his
heart was in it and he was not con
tented to do less than bis best, and 1
know he did it without thought of per
sonal renown. In the larger field, that
is what 1 wish to see the literary, the
scientific man ,tho historian, and the
artist do, devote himself to his work
for work's sake. You cannot expect a
man to overlook the money side of it,
but he must do honest work."
Praises President Jordan.
"I am proud that my own university,
i Harvard, and that your University
j here have such men as Lowell and
Jordan as Presidents, men who have
| done their full share to redeem Amer
j ica from the reproach of lack of the
type of scholarship of which I speak.
My plea is that we shall turn our at
! tention seriously in these universities
to the production of a condition of
mind in the teaching force, among the
- students and on the outside world,
such that more and more we shall
produce the type of scholars of which
I speak, that more and more we shall
produce the type of scholars whose
I scholarship finds expression in
! achievement of the highest kind. 1
care not whether that scholar becomes
>a great painter or a great scientific
i man, a great writer of any kind. My
plea is for the type of university train

America in the field of productive
scholarship, in the field of the scholar
ship of achievement, in the same com
manding position in this line as it now
occupies in the field of science, in the
field of that kind of science which is
directly applied to furtherance of in
dustrial or commercial success."
After the address, Colonel Roosevelt,
accompanied by President Jordan and
Professor E. H. Krehbtel, Chairman of
Ihe Faculty Committee on Public Ex
ercises, took a hurried ride by auto
i over the campus. A short stop was
made at the Delta Kappa Epsilon
house, and lunch was taken at the
Delta Upsilon house. Colonel Roose
velt left by auto for San Francisco at
12:45.
Speaking to us "with the frankness
of an open nature," the typical Ameri
can, Colonel Theodore Roosevelt,
swayed at will some two thousand
Americans this morning. The Assem
bly Hall was early filled with eager
spectators, anxious to catch a glimpse
of the famous Ex-President, hunter of
lions and "big business." Accompan
ied by the heads of the various Depart
ments of the University, Mr. Roose
velt entered the hall at 10:12.". having
with difficulty escaped from the crowd
in Palo Alto.
A tremendous ovation greeted the
visitor as he made his way across the
stage, every step in the short journey
being quickened with a salvo of ap
plause. Characteristically showing his
teeth in a broad smile, Mr. Roosevelt
seemed not entirely displeased by the
five minute reception given him by the
1 usty-lunged students.
After a short introduction by Presi
dent Jordan, Colonel Roosevelt ad
vanced to the center of the stage,
where he seemed to be quite at home.
From the first word uttered by the
speaker, the audience was his. Clench
ing our lists, when he clenched his,
smiling, when a flicker of smile over
spread his expressive features, Mr.
Roosevelt took command of the hearts
and imagination of his auditors, the
short, expressive words, backed by the
exuberant vitality and striking person
ality of the man, bringing home his re
marks with startling directness. The
following are excerpts from his
speech:

"Speaking for work's sake. 1 had

Heller (A. 13. '01). He was not striv

1 always got the credit and he did
most of the work and he never ex

"Heller did the work because his

"I am proud that my own university,

My plea is that we shall turn our at

to the production of a condition of
mind in the teaching force, among the
- students and on the outside world,
such that more and more we shall
produce the type of scholars of which
I speak, that more and more we shall
produce the type of scholars whose
I scholarship finds expression in
! achievement of the highest kind. 1
care not whether that scholar becomes
>a great painter or a great scientific
i man, a great writer of any kind. My
plea is for the type of university train

America in the field of productive
scholarship, in the field of the scholar
ship of achievement, in the same com
manding position in this line as it now
occupies in the field of science, in the
field of that kind of science which is
directly applied to furtherance of in
dustrial or commercial success."
After the address, Colonel Roosevelt,
accompanied by President Jordan and
Professor E. H. Krehbtel, Chairman of
Ihe Faculty Committee on Public Ex
ercises, took a hurried ride by auto
i over the campus. A short stop was
made at the Delta Kappa Epsilon
house, and lunch was taken at the
Delta Upsilon house. Colonel Roose
velt left by auto for San Francisco at
12:45.
Speaking to us "with the frankness
of an open nature," the typical Ameri
can, Colonel Theodore Roosevelt,
swayed at will some two thousand
Americans this morning. The Assem
bly Hall was early filled with eager
spectators, anxious to catch a glimpse
of the famous Ex-President, hunter of
lions and "big business." Accompan
ied by the heads of the various Depart
ments of the University, Mr. Roose
velt entered the hall at 10:12.". having
with difficulty escaped from the crowd
in Palo Alto.
A tremendous ovation greeted the
visitor as he made his way across the
stage, every step in the short journey
being quickened with a salvo of ap
plause. Characteristically showing his
teeth in a broad smile, Mr. Roosevelt
seemed not entirely displeased by the
five minute reception given him by the
1 usty-lunged students.
After a short introduction by Presi
dent Jordan, Colonel Roosevelt ad
vanced to the center of the stage,
where he seemed to be quite at home.
From the first word uttered by the
speaker, the audience was his. Clench
ing our lists, when he clenched his,
smiling, when a flicker of smile over
spread his expressive features, Mr.
Roosevelt took command of the hearts
and imagination of his auditors, the
short, expressive words, backed by the
exuberant vitality and striking person
ality of the man, bringing home his re
marks with startling directness. The
following are excerpts from his
speech:

"It is a very great pleasure to me to

Must Have Productive Scholarship.
"I have come to speak to you to
day upon the subject "Productive

achievement.
"Now, there are two sides necessar
ily to educational work in this country
of ours. In a democracy there must be
a very wide and broad education or the
democracy cannot live, and while that
education must include the ground
work of a literary education it must
also include far more or it is not edu
cation in the true sense. In other
words, our schools and Universities
must turn out boys and girls of such
type that the men and women of thp

j future shall possess strong characters,
j shall possess common sense and intel
ligence, and that shall be able to hold
| their own individuality in the world.
Yet they must be borne on by the lofty
I idealism which will make them dis
| contented unless they are able to join
with their fellows in making better the
common lot of all. That is the first
• and broadest, need to be met by our
| educational systems. The most essen
i tial thing is to turn out a n.ati or a
; women. A man in the fullest, sense—
a woman in the fullest sense. Unless
we do that, unless we turn out the
right type, then all our material suc
cess will go for nothing, and we can
not have the right kind of material
success unless we have the right kind
of training. There must be a founda

the boy and the girl shall be trained
towards and not away from his or her

man to overlook the money side of it,
but he must do honest work."
Praises President Jordan.
"I am proud that my own university,
i Harvard, and that your University
j here have such men as Lowell and
Jordan as Presidents, men who have
| done their full share to redeem Amer
j ica from the reproach of lack of the
type of scholarship of which I speak.
My plea is that we shall turn our at
! tention seriously in these universities
to the production of a condition of
mind in the teaching force, among the
- students and on the outside world,
such that more and more we shall
produce the type of scholars of which
I speak, that more and more we shall
produce the type of scholars whose
I scholarship finds expression in
! achievement of the highest kind. 1
care not whether that scholar becomes
>a great painter or a great scientific
i man, a great writer of any kind. My
plea is for the type of university train
| ing here in America which shall put
America in the field of productive
scholarship, in the field of the scholar
ship of achievement, in the same com
manding position in this line as it now
occupies in the field of science, in the
field of that kind of science which is
directly applied to furtherance of in
dustrial or commercial success."
After the address, Colonel Roosevelt,
accompanied by President Jordan and
Professor E. H. Krehbtel, Chairman of
Ihe Faculty Committee on Public Ex
ercises, took a hurried ride by auto
i over the campus. A short stop was
made at the Delta Kappa Epsilon
house, and lunch was taken at the
Delta Upsilon house. Colonel Roose
velt left by auto for San Francisco at
12:45.
Speaking to us "with the frankness
of an open nature," the typical Ameri
can, Colonel Theodore Roosevelt,
swayed at will some two thousand
Americans this morning. The Assem
bly Hall was early filled with eager
spectators, anxious to catch a glimpse
of the famous Ex-President, hunter of
lions and "big business." Accompan
ied by the heads of the various Depart
ments of the University, Mr. Roose
velt entered the hall at 10:12.". having
with difficulty escaped from the crowd
in Palo Alto.
A tremendous ovation greeted the
visitor as he made his way across the
stage, every step in the short journey
being quickened with a salvo of ap
plause. Characteristically showing his
teeth in a broad smile, Mr. Roosevelt
seemed not entirely displeased by the
five minute reception given him by the
1 usty-lunged students.
After a short introduction by Presi
dent Jordan, Colonel Roosevelt ad
vanced to the center of the stage,
where he seemed to be quite at home.
From the first word uttered by the
speaker, the audience was his. Clench
ing our lists, when he clenched his,
smiling, when a flicker of smile over
spread his expressive features, Mr.
Roosevelt took command of the hearts
and imagination of his auditors, the
short, expressive words, backed by the
exuberant vitality and striking person
ality of the man, bringing home his re
marks with startling directness. The
following are excerpts from his
speech:

"Mr. President, members of the
Faculty and of the Student Body: I
wish in the first place to congratulate
California upon the fact of its edit

! eated clas?es having such admirable
i lung power.
"It is a very great pleasure to me to
be here and to realize how close in
j touch the different parts of the world
i are. Now, 1 planned to visit California
1 at this time, over a year ago when I
j was right in the heart of Africa. When
I reached Khartoum T committed my
i self to three invitations —one to come
1 here to California, another to go to
Arizona to dedicate the great irriga
tion dam and third to go out to Chey

Must Have Productive Scholarship.
"I have come to speak to you to
day upon the subject "Productive
, Scholarship," of the scholarship of
achievement.
"Now, there are two sides necessar
ily to educational work in this country
of ours. In a democracy there must be
a very wide and broad education or the
democracy cannot live, and while that
education must include the ground
work of a literary education it must
also include far more or it is not edu
cation in the true sense. In other
words, our schools and Universities
must turn out boys and girls of such
type that the men and women of thp

j future shall possess strong characters,
j shall possess common sense and intel
ligence, and that shall be able to hold
| their own individuality in the world.
Yet they must be borne on by the lofty
I idealism which will make them dis
| contented unless they are able to join
with their fellows in making better the
common lot of all. That is the first
• and broadest, need to be met by our
| educational systems. The most essen
i tial thing is to turn out a n.ati or a
; women. A man in the fullest, sense—
a woman in the fullest sense. Unless
we do that, unless we turn out the
right type, then all our material suc
cess will go for nothing, and we can
not have the right kind of material
success unless we have the right kind
of training. There must be a founda
tion for a vocational training where
the boy and the girl shall be trained
towards and not away from his or her
duties iii after life.
Advocates Pursuit of Pure Science.
"But technical training, vital as it is,
i
is not all. What does it matter if
! America lias a good, fine type of model
| citizenship, if it. must import from
i abroad all that ministers to the highest
1 type of cultivation. I want to see this
, nation relieved from the reproach that
'we are a nation that has imported
j our art, much of our science, and
j tends to become one that must im
j port our children. We deserve no
j place in the world of today, if we can
| not produce them all from paintings to
children.
"And so 1 wish to speak today of the
need of having in institutions like this,
a standard of scholarship, such in de
gree and kind as to enable us to turn
out productive scholars not only in
the field of industry and of that kind
of science which is the essence of com
mercialism. but which will enable us
to turn out. productive workers in the
fields of pure art, pure science and lit
erati! re.
He Has an Open Nature.
In discussing tlie possibilities of re
ward in doing work such as the engi
neers on the famous Salt River pro
ject have recently completed, Mr.
Rosevelt told an interesting incident
of his own experience.


THEOBOKK HOOSEVELT.
"At Washington, the government has
the finest collection of mammals in the
world. When 1 came back from Africa
112 gave the collection to the national
museum. It is the greatest collection
of African big game in the world. It
is a more complete collection than is
to be found in the museums of London,
Berlin or Paris.
"The getting of it did not cost the
government a dollar. The expenses
were paid privately by myself and by
other private individuals. We gave it
free to Congress. The only acknowl
edgement that has come so far. has
been thru the introduction of a resolu
tion by a member of Congress from
Illinois. Not Mr. Lorimer. A fellow
statesman of his. The resolution in
effect is. that an investigation should
be held to see if in collecting the ani
mals, I was guilty of any treasonable
or corrupt practice. So far as I am
concerned he is entitled to go on with
the investigation. If he gets me I shall
speak to him with the frankness of an
open nature. Now that was merely
on the side.
Only First Class Work Wanted.
"This University will have come in
finitely short of what you have a right
to expect of it if a century hence it
cannot point to the fact of having pro
duced man after man whose achieve
ments have been in lines that tend for
the cultural development of the entire
nation. And now In striving for that
kind of development, you must remem

ber two things: in the first place, that
|no amount of second class work
j equals the smallest quantity of real
j first class work. The work of which 1
, am speaking must be work of the first
' class or it is almost or entirely value
i less. The work must be done for its
own sake.
Stanford Mail Aids Roosevelt.
"Speaking for work's sake. 1 had
one of your men with me in Africa.
He is back there now. He is what I
am describing to you. His name is
Heller (A. 13. '01). He was not striv
ing to get anything for himself out of
the expedition. It was always my feat;
1 always got the credit and he did
most of the work and he never ex
pected me to say anything about it,
and was much surprised when I did.
The work done there in connection
with mammals derives its benefit, from
the efforts of Heller and the praise is
more due to him than to any other
man.
"Heller did the work because his
heart was in it and he was not con
tented to do less than bis best, and 1
know he did it without thought of per
sonal renown. In the larger field, that
is what 1 wish to see the literary, the
scientific man ,tho historian, and the
artist do, devote himself to his work
for work's sake. You cannot expect a
man to overlook the money side of it,
but he must do honest work."
