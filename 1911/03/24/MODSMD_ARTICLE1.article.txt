# THEODORE ROOSEVELT PLEADS FOR PRODUCTIVE SCHOLARSHIP
## Ex-President Speaks Earnestly on Educational Needs, to Immense Throng at Junior Day Assembly. 
### 
Speaking to us "with the frankness
of an open nature," the typical Ameri
can, Colonel Theodore Roosevelt,
swayed at will some two thousand
Americans this morning. The Assem
bly Hall was early filled with eager
spectators, anxious to catch a glimpse
of the famous Ex-President, hunter of
lions and "big business." Accompan
ied by the heads of the various Depart
ments of the University, Mr. Roose
velt entered the hall at 10:12.". having
with difficulty escaped from the crowd
in Palo Alto.
A tremendous ovation greeted the
visitor as he made his way across the
stage, every step in the short journey
being quickened with a salvo of ap
plause. Characteristically showing his
teeth in a broad smile, Mr. Roosevelt
seemed not entirely displeased by the
five minute reception given him by the
1 usty-lunged students.
After a short introduction by Presi
dent Jordan, Colonel Roosevelt ad
vanced to the center of the stage,
where he seemed to be quite at home.
From the first word uttered by the
speaker, the audience was his. Clench
ing our lists, when he clenched his,
smiling, when a flicker of smile over
spread his expressive features, Mr.
Roosevelt took command of the hearts
and imagination of his auditors, the
short, expressive words, backed by the
exuberant vitality and striking person
ality of the man, bringing home his re
marks with startling directness. The
following are excerpts from his
speech:
4, lh'e-Lighted" AVitli Cheering.
"Mr. President, members of the
Faculty and of the Student Body: I
wish in the first place to congratulate
California upon the fact of its edit

! eated clas?es having such admirable
i lung power.
"It is a very great pleasure to me to
be here and to realize how close in
j touch the different parts of the world
i are. Now, 1 planned to visit California
1 at this time, over a year ago when I
j was right in the heart of Africa. When
I reached Khartoum T committed my
i self to three invitations —one to come
1 here to California, another to go to
Arizona to dedicate the great irriga
tion dam and third to go out to Chey
enne to celebrate Frontier day.
Must Have Productive Scholarship.
"I have come to speak to you to
day upon the subject "Productive
, Scholarship," of the scholarship of
achievement.
"Now, there are two sides necessar
ily to educational work in this country
of ours. In a democracy there must be
a very wide and broad education or the
democracy cannot live, and while that
education must include the ground
work of a literary education it must
also include far more or it is not edu
cation in the true sense. In other
words, our schools and Universities
must turn out boys and girls of such
type that the men and women of thp

j future shall possess strong characters,
j shall possess common sense and intel
ligence, and that shall be able to hold
| their own individuality in the world.
Yet they must be borne on by the lofty
I idealism which will make them dis
| contented unless they are able to join
with their fellows in making better the
common lot of all. That is the first
• and broadest, need to be met by our
| educational systems. The most essen
i tial thing is to turn out a n.ati or a
; women. A man in the fullest, sense—
a woman in the fullest sense. Unless
we do that, unless we turn out the
right type, then all our material suc
cess will go for nothing, and we can
not have the right kind of material
success unless we have the right kind
of training. There must be a founda
tion for a vocational training where
the boy and the girl shall be trained
towards and not away from his or her
duties iii after life.
Advocates Pursuit of Pure Science.
"But technical training, vital as it is,
i
is not all. What does it matter if
! America lias a good, fine type of model
| citizenship, if it. must import from
i abroad all that ministers to the highest
1 type of cultivation. I want to see this
, nation relieved from the reproach that
'we are a nation that has imported
j our art, much of our science, and
j tends to become one that must im
j port our children. We deserve no
j place in the world of today, if we can
| not produce them all from paintings to
children.
"And so 1 wish to speak today of the
need of having in institutions like this,
a standard of scholarship, such in de
gree and kind as to enable us to turn
out productive scholars not only in
the field of industry and of that kind
of science which is the essence of com
mercialism. but which will enable us
to turn out. productive workers in the
fields of pure art, pure science and lit
erati! re.
He Has an Open Nature.
In discussing tlie possibilities of re
ward in doing work such as the engi
neers on the famous Salt River pro
ject have recently completed, Mr.
Rosevelt told an interesting incident
of his own experience.
