# "UVERNIAN PRINCESS" PROVES GREATEST OF JUNIOR OPERAS
## 1912 Production Scores Biggest Hit in History of Stanford Theatricals.—Is a Complete Triumph. 
### Mrs. T.P. Russell 
Operas serve for delight, for orna
ment, and for ability. Junior Operas
serve also for originality. Sir Francis
would doubtless admit that he had
chosen the wrong subject for his
predicates. But then he never was at
L. S. J. U., U. S. A. in 1911. Those for
whom that good fortune was reserved
felt that the evening of March 23d was
one of the best of that vivacious time
and versatile place.
At the end of the first act one of the
spectators voiced what was undoubted
ly the sentiment of all by saying,
"This is just what a Junior Opera
should be—a big, happy, family party.'
For when the vanishing curtains dis
closed to us a bit of our own Quad,
with its vistas and arcades; when we
saw red hats, brown sombreros and
"cords," (neither purchased nor laun
dried for the occasion), black caps and
gowns and a Phi Beta Kappa key;
when we heard roughnecks and queen
ers and co-eds gossiping, flirting,
"stringin' " Froshes and Faculty, root
ing at a ball game and accepting Roble
"At Homes," why of course we all felt
at home too. That was the reason we
said, as we always do when something
unusually good is done: "Why hasn't
this been done before?" And the cause
too, of the joyous rapport between the
hither and yon sides of the footlights.
For when the familiar is beloved at all
it is the best beloved, and a slice of our
own life dramatized has both sweet
ness and spice in its flavoring. It was
a Melting Pot of a Stanford that we
beheld, wherein all ingredients were
so amalgamated that the drawling
"Phebe" could walk off with the queen
er's queen, the "Frosh" from Mllpitas
could dance with the Princess from
Uvernia, the Education Major with her
ostrich feather fan could talk back to
the star athlete, and even the Profes
sor might join in the Cigarette chorus.
And that, we take it, was a crystaliza
tion of the real Stanford Spirit.
Two acts of this, and we pass from
realism to romance and enjoy not only
the fantastic as well as we had the
familiar, but the effective contrast be
tween the two, just, foreshadowed in
the "Song of the Dance" at tbe merry
Prom. Young America rowing boats

and driving tandem, we exchange for
a semi-tropical dancing and chanting
in the weird, monotoned, barbaric
measure that so rejoices the untamed
savage in all of us.
Against these backgrounds and thru
a plot not so complicated as to dis
tract our attention from its proper
object, the music, stood the melodies,
combined and individual. The two
dozen songs showed range and charm,
while the choruses were always first
aids to the excellent.
The Princess was a real Princess in
that she interpreted her role with the
simple dignity and sincerity that indi
cates real royalty, showing both the
sympathy that comprehends her songs
and the voice to communicate them —a
voice of compass, clearness and flex
ible expression, for which Miss Malon
ey is to be congratulated.
The duets of Miss Harrier and Mr.
Forbes were excellently well done and
Miss Coleman reached a climax of
success in the "Happiness" of the third
act. Of the other songs, Mr. Well's
suspicious lament in the first act, Mr.
Chamberlain's wistful apostrophe to
his Cigarette, in the second, Miss Gil
bert's modest "Ambition," and the
triple assurance that "Somebody Loves
Us," in the third, deserve especial and
honorable mention. The Alexian
dance, led by Mr. Lewis, and the Uver
nian National Dance were rousing and
spirited enough for any one's patriot
ism. while the rythmic confession that
"[ Love a Co-ed" was the refrain that
persisted tbe most and will probably
do so longest.
And so we have to our credit, an
original Junior Opera that has ex
hibited talents on the part of the pro
ducers, gifts musical, terpsicliorean
and histrionic on the part of the act
ors, and gratified pride on the part of
(lie audience, for was it not "our"
Junior Opera. Nothing would we have
had different, except perhaps milder
orchestration in support of soprano
solos, and certainly better manners
from —, but that; for editorial dealing.
Now let's hear an original Senior
Play, iiiul show our distinguished guest
of the morning that Stanford can live
up to its opportunities by adding to
their artistic and literary productivity.

from —, but that; for editorial dealing.
Now let's hear an original Senior
Play, iiiul show our distinguished guest
of the morning that Stanford can live
up to its opportunities by adding to
their artistic and literary productivity.
Operas serve for delight, for orna
ment, and for ability. Junior Operas
serve also for originality. Sir Francis
would doubtless admit that he had
chosen the wrong subject for his
predicates. But then he never was at
L. S. J. U., U. S. A. in 1911. Those for
whom that good fortune was reserved
felt that the evening of March 23d was
one of the best of that vivacious time
and versatile place.
At the end of the first act one of the
spectators voiced what was undoubted
ly the sentiment of all by saying,
"This is just what a Junior Opera
should be—a big, happy, family party.'
For when the vanishing curtains dis
closed to us a bit of our own Quad,
with its vistas and arcades; when we
saw red hats, brown sombreros and
"cords," (neither purchased nor laun
dried for the occasion), black caps and
gowns and a Phi Beta Kappa key;
when we heard roughnecks and queen
ers and co-eds gossiping, flirting,
"stringin' " Froshes and Faculty, root
ing at a ball game and accepting Roble
"At Homes," why of course we all felt
at home too. That was the reason we
said, as we always do when something
unusually good is done: "Why hasn't
this been done before?" And the cause
too, of the joyous rapport between the
hither and yon sides of the footlights.
For when the familiar is beloved at all
it is the best beloved, and a slice of our
own life dramatized has both sweet
ness and spice in its flavoring. It was
a Melting Pot of a Stanford that we
beheld, wherein all ingredients were
so amalgamated that the drawling
"Phebe" could walk off with the queen
er's queen, the "Frosh" from Mllpitas
could dance with the Princess from
Uvernia, the Education Major with her
ostrich feather fan could talk back to
the star athlete, and even the Profes
sor might join in the Cigarette chorus.
And that, we take it, was a crystaliza
tion of the real Stanford Spirit.
Two acts of this, and we pass from
realism to romance and enjoy not only
the fantastic as well as we had the
familiar, but the effective contrast be
tween the two, just, foreshadowed in
the "Song of the Dance" at tbe merry
Prom. Young America rowing boats

and driving tandem, we exchange for
a semi-tropical dancing and chanting
in the weird, monotoned, barbaric
measure that so rejoices the untamed
savage in all of us.
Against these backgrounds and thru
a plot not so complicated as to dis
tract our attention from its proper
object, the music, stood the melodies,
combined and individual. The two
dozen songs showed range and charm,
while the choruses were always first
aids to the excellent.
The Princess was a real Princess in
that she interpreted her role with the
simple dignity and sincerity that indi
cates real royalty, showing both the
sympathy that comprehends her songs
and the voice to communicate them —a
voice of compass, clearness and flex
ible expression, for which Miss Malon
ey is to be congratulated.
The duets of Miss Harrier and Mr.
Forbes were excellently well done and
Miss Coleman reached a climax of
success in the "Happiness" of the third
act. Of the other songs, Mr. Well's
suspicious lament in the first act, Mr.
Chamberlain's wistful apostrophe to
his Cigarette, in the second, Miss Gil
bert's modest "Ambition," and the
triple assurance that "Somebody Loves
Us," in the third, deserve especial and
honorable mention. The Alexian
dance, led by Mr. Lewis, and the Uver
nian National Dance were rousing and
spirited enough for any one's patriot
ism. while the rythmic confession that
"[ Love a Co-ed" was the refrain that
persisted tbe most and will probably
do so longest.
And so we have to our credit, an
original Junior Opera that has ex
hibited talents on the part of the pro
ducers, gifts musical, terpsicliorean
and histrionic on the part of the act
ors, and gratified pride on the part of
(lie audience, for was it not "our"
Junior Opera. Nothing would we have
had different, except perhaps milder
orchestration in support of soprano
solos, and certainly better manners
from —, but that; for editorial dealing.
