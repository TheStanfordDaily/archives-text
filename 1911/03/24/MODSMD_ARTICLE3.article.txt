# RIVAL VARSITIES READY TO BEGIN BIG SERIES
## FIRST GAME IN BERKELEY TOMORROW AT 2:30. Eve of Launching Twentieth Intercollegiate Baseball Series Kinds Cardinal Fully Prepared. 
### 
Stanford meets California tomorrow
afternoon on the California Field in
the first game of the twentieth annual
championship baseball series. The
game starts at 2:30.
Who will win? Stanford has a
group of batters who can get the men
on bases and scores across the platter,
Terry, Cass, Mitchell and Collins. If
the Cardinal pitcher, Gilfillan, who will
start the game, can keep the California
team to few bits, such as he was able
to do at Pomona, the championship
will come to the Stanford banner. In
other words, if Stanford plays the
game the team has been playing for
the past three weeks, there is no cause
for worry. California has veterans
enough to make a whole nine and a
little over, but lias not been any less
free from errors than the team was
last spring in the preliminary games.
California has two good pitchers,
Forker and Haskell. No one knows
which will be on the mound tomorrow.
But in any event they will give a good
account of themselves. They will have
difficulty however, in holding down the
quartet of hitters above mentioned,and
it is probable that there lies the key to
the whole situation.
Line-ups and full statistics of the
two Varsities will be found on the col
umn adjoining this. These are the
official lineups.
Of nineteen Intercollegiate series
played since 1592, Stanford has won
eight and California ten. One series,
in 1906, was a tie. Last .year the Car
dinal broke a line of three straight de
feats, and won the championship for
1910.
Admission will be fifty cents.
