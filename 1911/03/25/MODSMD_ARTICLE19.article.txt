# IRISH MARATHON WON BY SOPHOMORE CLASS
## QUADRANGLE CLUB OFFERS ENTERTAINING PROGRAM Holdovers Present Novel Record of Events of the College Year, Glendenning Performs. 
### 
Introducing several new and novel
features, the Quadrangle Club brought
the athletic events of Junior Week to
a close on the track yesterday after
noon. The Irish Marathon, which was
the big drawing card, was won by
twenty-four members of the Sopho
more Class in the fast time of 22:46.
The second year men took the lead in
the second lap and held it all the way,
making an average time of :56.4. to the
man.
To E. P. Campbell, '13, goes the
honor of negotiating the fastest lap.
He covered the distance in:50.3, the
best time that has been made in the
double furlong event on the Stanford
oval this season. J. P. Cottrell, '1?.,
took second honors, making the route
in his turn in:52.3.
The Holdovers did their share in the
funmaking of the day. Arrayed as
ballet dancers, hod carriers, convicts,
bespectacled wonders and other won
ders of the world, they marched onto
the field accompanied by a rare col
lection of canines garnered from Stan
ford's plethoric supply. They vividly
presented, as has never been presented
before, the events of the college year.
The "Hibernian Princess," "Live
Wires," featured by R. J. Glendenning
and his troup, and the "Bespectacled
Row," all had their turn on the boards,
and made a great hit with the bleach
ers. Tubbing as practiced in the days
of old and the dreaded immersion in
vogue at the present time were accu
rately repeated with the aid of a real
live bath tub.
Three innovations aided in making
yesterday's event the best ever. Fore
most among these was the Obstacle
Race, which was won by R. W. Olm
stead, '13. Each of the participants
started the race in a sack. Proceeding
in this fashion for about fifty yards,
the men crawled through barrels set
in their path. The next obstacle to be
encountered was the hammer cage,
where two streams of water were
freely played upon the unfortunate en
tries. Carrying an egg very carefully
in a spoon, each one of the entries per
formed a fancy balancing stunt, and
then took a flour bath while making
his way thru two sheets of canvas laid
on the track. The final feat to be ac
complished was the devouring of an
apple suspended in mid-air, no hands
allowed.
Olmstead also showed a knowledge
of farm life when he succeeded in cap
turing two fowls in the Chicken Race.
To the victor went the spoils, and the
winner will live high for the next
couple of days. Members of the Gym.
Club entertained with an exhibition of
fancy high diving.
