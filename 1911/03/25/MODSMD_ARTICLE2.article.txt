# MURRAY SECURES POSITION ON VARSITY TENNIS TEAM.
## Wins Over Grace in Second Tournament.-Third Tournament During Vacation. 
### 
In ii hotly contested match on the
Peninsular Club courts this morning,
R. L. Murray, '13, won the second Var
sity tennis tournament from C. S.
Grace, '12. The final score, which
stood G-2, 6-1, G-3, does not give a good
idea of the closeness of the match, as
many of the games went to deuce and
were only decided after a hard strug
gle.
Grace returned many very difficult
shots and his playing was extremely
steady thruout. He is sure to make
an excellent showing in the two tour
naments that are to follow. Murray's
smashing and serving were especially
good and were the most notable fea
tures of his winning play. This victory
gives Murray a position on the Varsity
tennis team with Capt. H. S. Morgan,'l2.

ing two places will start immediately
