# California Nine Wins Baseball Game
## First Contest of Twentieth Annual Series Lost to Stanford in the Tenth Inning.â€”Score, 4 to 3. 
### 
Ten innings were needed to decide
the first game of the twentieth annual
Stanford-California baseball series in
favor of California on the Blue and
Gold Held this afternoon, score -1 to 13.
The winning run came with two
outs and Stoner on third. Allen
knocked a long one to center. The
game was over.
Gilfillan pitched a good game and
allowed only six hits in the ten frames,
but his tendency to walk men made
each inning a critical one and was
responsible for several scores, aided
by two errors in the infield, and two
in the garden by Childs. He struck
out and walked the same number.
Four men were also hit by him and
allowed their bases.
Forker gave eight hits in the eighth
innings and was replaced by the
Freshman, Haskell, after Beeger had
tripled. Forker was far from his
standard of two years ago when he
won the seventeen inning game against
Stanford.
Haskell allowed one hit in his one
and one half chapters.
Stanford's runs were scored one at a
time in the second, fifth, and sixth
periods. California's were scored in
the fifth, seventh, eighth, and tenth.
The contest was a long drawn out
affair, taking two hours and sixteen
minutes.
California made as many mistakes
as the Cardinal, three errors being
scored against California and four
against Stanford.
Brady's decisions were satisfactory
to everyone. Beeger's three bagger,
Mitchell's and Forker's doubles were
the only slugging features. The line
