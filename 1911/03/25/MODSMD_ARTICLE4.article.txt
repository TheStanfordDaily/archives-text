# OLYMPIC CLUB UNABLE TO CAPTURE MANY POINTS
## CARDINAL RUNNERS SHOW HEELS TO CITY MEN McKee Wins Furlong in Even Time. Morris Proves Phenomenal Hurdler 
### 
Capturing only four first places out
of fourteen, the Olympic Club Athletes
fell before the Cardinal track team
this afternoon in a fast meet. The
city club was not represented by its
best team, yet they gave the Varsity
runners hot competition in the major
ity of the events.
P. 15. McKee, '13, and C. 11. Morris,
put up the best exhibitions of the day.
McKee showed his constant improve
ment in the sprints by handily winning
the 220 yard dash in an even twenty
two seconds. The freshman runner
finished scarcely a yard behind Smith
eruin in the hundred.
Morris, the veteran hurdler, cap
tured his events rather easily, although
Smith topped the sticks prettily in
both races. Record time is credited
to Morris in the high hurdles. The
former Cardinal man's time in this
event was 15.1, equaling the record
held by Edwards. Smithson and Shaw.
As only one timer caught the race it
will not go down as a record.
Close to two minutes was Cramer's
performance in the half. The Stanford
man took the lead early in the race
and held it consistently, although
pressed in the last furlong by Kurrtz,
a dark horse running for the Olympic
club. The race was run in 2:01.1.
A stout gentleman struggling under
the pseudonym of Rose, easily walked
away with the weight events. The
redoubtable Rose was far from being
in the best of form and Woolley gave
him a close run in the hammer throw.
The quarter men showed the effect
of Junior week and a slow race was
won by Campbell. The summary of
events is as follows:

liott (S) second; Brown (S) third.

Capturing only four first places out
of fourteen, the Olympic Club Athletes
fell before the Cardinal track team
this afternoon in a fast meet. The
city club was not represented by its
best team, yet they gave the Varsity
runners hot competition in the major
ity of the events.
P. 15. McKee, '13, and C. 11. Morris,
put up the best exhibitions of the day.
McKee showed his constant improve
ment in the sprints by handily winning
the 220 yard dash in an even twenty
two seconds. The freshman runner
finished scarcely a yard behind Smith
eruin in the hundred.
Morris, the veteran hurdler, cap
tured his events rather easily, although
Smith topped the sticks prettily in
both races. Record time is credited
to Morris in the high hurdles. The
former Cardinal man's time in this
event was 15.1, equaling the record
held by Edwards. Smithson and Shaw.
As only one timer caught the race it
will not go down as a record.
Close to two minutes was Cramer's
performance in the half. The Stanford
man took the lead early in the race
and held it consistently, although
pressed in the last furlong by Kurrtz,
a dark horse running for the Olympic
club. The race was run in 2:01.1.
A stout gentleman struggling under
the pseudonym of Rose, easily walked
away with the weight events. The
redoubtable Rose was far from being
in the best of form and Woolley gave
him a close run in the hammer throw.
The quarter men showed the effect
