Nineteen Twelve "came thru." This
Class is to be congratulated for the
great Junior Week it has provided.

Its Opera, especially will
stand out as a real
achievement. The auth

ors, committee, the coaches and the
players are to be thanked for the time,
work, and sacrifice, spent in its pre
sentation. It was a stupendous en
terprise, but it'was successful.
