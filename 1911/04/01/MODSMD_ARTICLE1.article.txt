# California Nine Wins Championship
## Second Consecutive Victory Gives the Blue and Gold the 1911 Intercollegiate Diamond Series.—Score, 4 to 1. 
### 
California repeated her performance
of a week ago today, and defeated the
Cardinal nine by the score of 4 to 1,
this afternoon on Stanford Field, and
won the Bill Intercollegiate baseball
championship by two straight games.
A week ago, a nerve-racking strug
gle went to the Blue and Gold after

ten innings hac been fought thru, by
a score of 4-3, with the weather un
surpassed for fast work.
Today, the two teams were equally
determined to win, Stanford to make a
third game necessary, California to put
the series away for good and all. The
day was not ideal and threatened rain
during the greater part of the match.
This did not interfere with good play
ing, however, of which there was
plenty on the field.
The game went fast for ihe first four
innings and hut three hits brought
enthusiasm among the bleachers, two
singles by Captain Hall and a single
by Coum\ Beeger's catch of Rubke'a
long fly was a pretty sight, and bis
three-sacker in the sixth made a good
dent in the feature column.
Gilfiilan pitched a wonderful game,
as can he seen by the story of the in
nings. He allowed only six hits during
the game, the same number that, he
permitted last Saturday. Hut his great
improvement came in the walks, where
in nine innings he gave but three
passes. One man got his base by being
hit.
California had great luck in hitting
with men on liases, and in that came
their victory.
Forker did well, allowing four hits,
striking out eight men. He was strong
on walks, however, and gave six.
Several thousand people filled the
bleachers on the first and third base
lines, and each university possessed is
rooting section. The California Hand
aided in supporting its team, but the
Stanford musicians were conspicuous
by their absence, since they are giving
vacation concerts at Pizmo Beach.
Rrady, as usual, filled his indicator
position with fairness to all.

left field; Goodwin, second base; Salis
