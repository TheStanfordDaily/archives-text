# E.M. WIEDMAN, '13, DROWNS AT EL PIZMO
## FATALITY OCCURS ON VACATION TRIP OF BAND. Rough Water Makes Difficult Rescue Impossible.â€”Body Not Yet Recovered. 
### 
Tragedy sudden and terrible marked
the trip of the Stanford Band to El
Pizmo beach when Edwin Marston
Wiedman of the Class of 1913 was
drowned in the surf there on Monday
afternoon.
Wiedman, who was a good swimmer
and of powerful physique, had been in
the surf in the morning, and in com
pany with .1. W. Fitting, '10, went out
again in the afternoon. While swim
ming in the deep water of the channel
about two hundred yards from the
shore line, Wiedman's strength seemed
suddenly to fail liim and he called for
aid from Fitting who immediately went,
to help him. M. 11. Easton, '13, and lv.
Pyle, '13, who had seen from the shore
that Wiedman was in distress also
swam to his aid as quickly as possible.
Tho nearly exhausted themselves, the
men were for awhile successful in
keeping him afloat and helping him to
wards shore. They might have reached
it safely had they not been struck by a
huge breaker which drove them all
under and broke the hold of the res
cuers on the now helpless man. Wied
man, who had been under two or three
times before, never came to the sur
face again. Fitting, Pyle and Easton
were barely able to reach the shore,
the latter requiring assistance him
self to make it.
A boat, was immediately sent out to
the place where Wideman went under,
and the men of the band patrolled the
beach, but all efforts were futile.
Though watch has been kept since the
tragedy, the bodv has not yet been re
covered.
Wiedman was from Pony, Montana,
and was twenty-four years of age.
He majored in Geology, and was a
member of the Acacia Fraternity.
Tho it was the intention of the band
at first to cancell their contract and
return to the campus, it was later de
cided to stay and give several concerts
and assist in the search for the re
mains. They will return to Stanford
tomorrow.
