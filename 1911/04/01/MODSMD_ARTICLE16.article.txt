# STANFORD LOSER IN TWO DEBATES OF YESTERDAY
## OREGON WINS HERE AND WASHINGTON AT SEATTLE. Close and Interesting Discussions of Ship Subsidies Furnished in Tri-state Contests. 
### 
Stanford lost to the University of
Oregon last evening in the first debate
of the new Tri-state League, the judges
voting two to one in favor of the north
ern university. The contest was close
and of a high order thruout, and the
four speakers furnished a most com
prehensive discussion of the question,
"Resolved, That the United States
should adopt a system of ship sub
sidies."
Oregon supported the negative and
won by arguing that the world is sup
plied in plenty with ships to carry all
its goods and that the United States
should use those which exist instead of
attempting to build a large merchant
marine of her own and thus deflecting
money from more productive indus
tries. Stanford's debaters denied this,
holding that there are not enough
American ships. In time of war or
international difficulty, said they, our
privilege of using foreign ships would
be withdrawn, and it would then be
impossible for us to carry 011 our con
stantly increasing trade. The grant
ing of ship subsidies is the only way
to guarantee ship owners against loss,
and is exactly in accord with one of
the fundamental policies of the Ameri
can people, that of protection.
E. E. Tincher, '12, and G. N. Wood,
'13, composed Stanford's team, their
opponents being P. M. Collier, '11, and
V. Motschenbacher, '14. Tincher was
probably the best individual speaker
of the evening, his argument being
clear, convincing, and well delivered.
He showed the good effects of his ex
tensive debating experience. Collier
and Motschenbacher were equally ex
cellent as first and second affirmative
speakers. The former is President of
the Oregon Student Body, and an ex
perienced debater, having lead the
teams which defeated the Universities
of Utah and Washington last year.
Motschenbacher, his team-mate, is a
freshman who shows great promise.
The contest last evening was attend
ed by a good audience, considering
that it was a vacation debate. The
judges of the evening were Harris
Weinstock, Max Thelan, and Judge S.
P. Hall. Professor R. M. Alden acted
as chairman.
W. B. Owens, *14, and A. G. Bradford.
'13, who debated the negative of the
same question against Washington
last night at Seattle, were also de
feated. according to despatch received
here. Since the affirmative team of
Oregon defeated the negative speakers
of Washington last evening at Eugene,
that university will be declared the
champion of the Tri-state Debating
League for the coming year.
