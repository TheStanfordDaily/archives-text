# Santa Clara Defeats Varsity.
## 
### 
Santa Clara decisively defeated Stan
ford in the vacation baseball game
played last Wednesday afternoon by a
score of 12 to 3. F. S. Gaitlt, '14, was
on the mound for the Cardinals, and
for six innings pitched fine ball al
lowing his opponents but three bits
and two runs. In the seventh, how
ever, he weakened and was found for
seven hits and a like number of runs
before three outs were made. The
game was featured with a half dozen
hits for extra bases, Hall securing a
three-bagger. Stanford lined up as
usual with the exception of M. H.
Henshaw, '12, who replaced L. Childs.
