# CARDINAL RECORDS BROKEN IN CLASSY MEET WITH SOUTHERNERS
## Horine and Lee Give Remarkable Performances.—Stanford. 89; University of Southern California, 33. 
### 
Stanford S9, University of Southern
California, 33, does not convey an ac
curate conception of the class of meet
which was held with the Southerners
on the Oval this morning. Good com
petition made practically every event
close, but the visitors were simply
outclassed by "Dad's" hopefuls, and
could claim title to only three first
places.
G.L. Horine, '13, who has been con
sistenty breaking records during the
last two seasons, did himself proud
this morning with a jump of fi feet, 1
inches. This establishes a new Coast
and Stanford record and ties the
World's Intercollegiate record, which
is held by Page of Pennsylvania. Hor
ine has gained for himself a place
among the "worldbeaters" by this per
formance. Finney's jump of 6 feet, /
inch materially increases the pros
pects for nine points in this event on
the day of the Intercollegiate meet.
Far surpassing any previous show
ing, K. F. Lee, '12, rounded the four
laps and flushed bis race in 4:28.2.
This gives him claim t< the Stanford
record in the mile, and is the fastest
time that the route has ever been
traveled by either a Stanford or Cali
fornia man. C. L. Moore, '12, sprung
a surprise by taking second place,
crossing the line less than five seconds
after Lee.
Inches, or possibly fractions of in
ches, separated Smitherum and Throop
at the finish of the century. The
speedy athlete from the Southland
took the lead at the start, but Smither
um proved too much for him on the
finish, completing the course in:10.1.
McKee ran a good third.
"Dad" and Captain Bellah were all
smiles with the discovery of another
22 foot man in the broad-jump. H.
Morrison. '13, made the best leap of
the day taking this event at 22 feet. 4
inches.
With neither Coleman nor Smith
erum in the furlong, Throop was
pressed only by E. P. Campbell, 'l''>,
who finished a strong second. Throop
ran a wonderful race and was accred
ited with :22.1.
T. M. Cramer, '11, knocked three
fifths of a second off his previous time
in the half when he carried away first
honors in this race at 2:00.2. Card,
the sturdy Freshman half-miler. took
only two-fifths of a second longer to
go the distance.
The quarter mile brought forth a
good close contest, the finish of the
race finding the men almost as close
together as they were at the start. W.
Dawson, '1 1, held his lead all the way,
finishing in :r>2 flat. B. Wallace, '12,
took the third place, while C. C. Tay
lor. '11, and D. 11. Thomas, '12, also
ran inside of ">3 seconds.
The consistent improvement of

Smith in the hurdles brought him first
place in the low. His time of : 26.2
gives promise of a place in the meet
with California. He also ran a good
second in the high hurdles which were
won by Ward in : 1 C.2.
The weight events found Wool ley
and Dole placing in both, although
Trotter's put of 42 feet, 4 inches in the
shot was far enough to give him first
in that event. Captain Bellah had
no difficulty in annexing five points in
the pole vault at 11 feet, 11 inches.
The relay was all Stanford. Wallace
of U. S. C. and Wallace of Stanford
ran even in the first lap. Taylor took
a lead in the second which was only
lengthened by the other two runners.
