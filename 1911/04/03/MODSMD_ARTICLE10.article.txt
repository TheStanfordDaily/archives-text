# DR. JORDAN AGAIN STATES DISAPPROVAL OF MUCKERISM.
## 
### 
President Jordan has again ex
pressed his strong dissent to mucker
ism in baseball, so it is reported.
Some time ago Dr. Jordan gave voice
to similar views and stated that unless
tactics of this sort were eliminated,
Intercollegiate baseball must go.
It is not expected that any action
will be taken on the matter if games in
the future are conducted with the
objectionable features eliminated.
Exception is taken chiefly to con
certed attempts on the part of players
and spectators to rattle the opposing
team, especially the pitcher. These
tactics are regarded as unsportsman
like, inasmuch as they do not allow
the game to be decided upon the real
merits of the players.
