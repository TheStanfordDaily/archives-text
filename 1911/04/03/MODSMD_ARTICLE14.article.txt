# Poor Wins Art Prize in Paris.
## 
### 
Intelligence recently received from
Paris states that H. V. Poor, '10, has
received first mention in the Portrait
Class at the annual "Concours" or in
ternational art exhibition of the "Aca
demie Julien" in that city. First men
tion corresponds to second prize in
this class, but even this is an excep
tional honor, especially for one who
has spent as little time in study as has
Poor.
The winner of the prize is now a
student at he '"Academie Julien," one
of the most noted schools of art in the
French capital. He was a member of
the Varsity track team for four years,
and was prominent in Stanford art
work.
