### 
Baron d'Estournelles de Constant,
member of the International Tribunal
of the Hague, last year's laureate of
the Nobel Peace Prize, a member of
the French Senate and one of the fore
most figures in the world-wide move
ment. to abolish war, will address the
University public at an assembly at
11:15 Wednesday morning on the sub
ject, "The Conciliation of Nations."
The career of Baron de Constant has
been a most interesting one and af
fords a striking testimonial of the sin
cerity and power of the man. Born at
La Fleche, Sarthe, in 1852, he at the
age of five years lost bis father. The
family fortune being impaired, his
mother moved with her five children to
Paris, where she could better obtain
them an education. Young d'Estour
nelles showed himself industrious and
bright. He obtained a scholarship,
graduated in law, took up the study of
Oriental languages and at the age of
twenty-four entered the French diplo
matic service.
For the next nineteen years he con
tinued in this wi " loving the
greatest success. > e of thirty
two, the excel lei) 1 • work was
officially recognb • the French
government inscribed i. on the rolls
of the Legion of Honor, and in 1893,
while representing France in London,
he was accredited Minister Plenipoten
tary.
By virtue of his official position,
Baron de Constant was enabled to
observe during his stay in London, the
vast and continually increasing expen
ditures of all the nations in preparing
for war. Becoming convinced of the
folly and disasterous consequences of
such a course, he wrote repeatedly to
his government, urging the adoption of
a different policy. His letters were
ignored utterly, and realizing that to
make his protests heard he must be
backed by public opinion, he deliber
ately resigned from bis high position
and sought election to the French Par
liament from his native province.
So convincingly did he present this
new issue to the electors of his prov
ince that he won their votes . He was
now in a position to command the
hearing of Parliament and the nation
of the cause he had at heart. He has
since been three times re-elected, the
last time having no opposition.
In the work of carrying out bis

ideals. Baron de Constant has been
iii(>si practical and aucces.-iul. lie war
organizer of the "League of Inter
national Conciliation," the Ameircan
branch of which, for example, counts
among its members the leading men of
the United States. Nearly all the
European Parliaments have formed
"Groups of International Arbitration"
among their members .similar to the
one that he organized in France, in
1902, as a result of an interview with
Baron de Constant, President Roose
velt referred the Mexican case to the
Hague Tribunal for arbitration. In the
same year, Andrew Carnegie, at his
suggestion, donated the funds for the
magnificent Palace of Peace at the
Hague.
In addition to his other achieve
ments, Wednesday's speaker is an
author and painter. His published
works of essays and criticism com
prise some twenty volumes, and he is
an artist of no mean ability.
His present tour of the United States
includes every city of importance, it
is made under the auspices of the
American Branch of the "International
League of Conciliation." Stanford may
consider herself fortunate indeed to
welcome such a distinguished foreign
guest.
