# DAWSON WINS PLACE ON VARSITY TENNIS TEAM
## FRESHMAN DEFEATS KENNEDY IN STRAIGHT SETS. Three Members of Intercollegiate Team Selected.—To Play Tryout Tournament this Week. 
### 
By defeating S. C. Kennedy, '12, in
straight sets in the third Varsity try
out tournament last week, H. W. Daw
sou, '14, won a place on the Stanford
tennis team that will meet California
on the latter's courts on April 15 and
22. The score of the match was G-0,
6-3. Dawson's playing was a big sur
prise as he has been unable to practice
this semester owing to his track work,
but his court game seems to have suff
ered but little. Altho at times erratic,
clue to lack of practice, the Freshman's
hard drives and smashes proved too
much for his opponent.
With the completion of this tourna
ment, three of the four men who will
compose the tennis team have been
chosen, the other two being H. S. Mor
gan, '12, and R. L. Murray, '13. The
fourth member of the team will be
selected in the tournament this week.
There will be five matches in the in
tercollegiate tournament this year, —
three singles and two doubles. Ac
cording to the present agreement, part
of the matches will be played on the
morning of April 15 and the rest on the
following Saturday morning. The
division of the matches has not as yet
been made.
