It is high time that Stanford is win
ning a debate. For two long years we
have known absolutely nothing but

defeat. Six successive
intercollegiate decisions
have gone against the
Cardinal. On each occa-

sion we have consoled ourselves with
the old traditional thot that surely next
time Stanford would come into her
own. But it seems that we have waited
in vain. And then, when not only Cal
ifornia, but Oregon and Washington
triumph over us, our patience is in
deed more than over-taxed. It is time
an investigation be made. Something
is wrong somewhere. Surely there is
a reason for this continued ill fortune.
The Daily Palo Alto has two theories
—first, that we as a whole take too
little interest in literary activity,—
second that Stanford has such high
scholarship requirements that her de
baters do not have time for sufficient
forensic preparation. The ability of
the men on our teams leads us to be
lieve that the second theory is the un
derlying cause for our failures.
