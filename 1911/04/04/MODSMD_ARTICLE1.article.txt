# INTER-CLASS TRACK MEET TOMORROW AFTERNOON
## LAST OPPORTUNITY TO SEE VARSITY IN COMPETITION. Transfers and Ineligibles Will Have Opportunity to Enter.â€”Meet Called at 3:30. 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon at 3:30 o'clock,
the rival classes will meet on the Oval
in the Annual Interclass Meet. This
will conclude the program of prelim
inary track meets previous to the In
tercollegiate on April 15, and will lie
the last opportunity to view the entire
Varsity squad in competition. Varsity,
novices, transfers and ineligibles will
all have an opportunity to shine in to
morrow's events.
The members of the Varsity squad
need no Introduction. They will prob
ably without exception all be in the
field to defend the honor of their re
spective classes.
In the sprints H. Smitherum, 11.
and P. B. McKee should be seen cross
ing the tape first. T. L. Coleman. '12,
will probably not. be able to run be
cause of a slight strain.
W. Dawson, '14, who is at present
leading the Varsity quarter milers.
will be opposed by E. P. Campbell, '13.
Campbell, as a transfer, is not eligible
to compete in the Intercollegiate
.Meet, but his time of :i">o.3 made in the
Irish Marathon, gives a position in the
from rank in the quarter tomoirow.
The half is undoubtedly a five point
race for the Seniors with T. M. Cram
er, '11, entered in this event. F. .1.
Gard, '14, should follow him across the
line, and A. W. Robertson, '12, will un
doubtedly figure for a place if he is in
condition.
Eight points should augment the
total score for the Juniors after the
mile is run with K. F. Lee, '12, and C.
L. Moore, '12, in the race. L. H. Price,
'13, who is ineligible looks good for
the remaining place if lie enters. The
outcome of the two mile is doubtful.
R. S. Worthington, '12, will probably
be seen in the race, and will be op
posed by such men as J. E. Shelton,
'10. E. Templeton, '10, and V. M. Smith,
'14.
The weights are all for the Juniors
with J. E. Wool ley, '12, and M. M.
Aldemann, '12, as the probable first
and second place men. E. P. Campbell,
'13, nm.v annex some points here also.
G. L. Horine, '13, and W. M. Arga
brite, '13, are sure of six and possibly
eight points in the high jump. VV. R.
Finney, '12, and Argabrite will fight it
out for the second place.
Captain Bellah can almost give the
Seniors five points without competing
in the pole. The other places will
be hotly contested as none of the other
vaulters has been consistently de
feating his rivals.
The broad jump will go to either
Captain Bellah, M. Morrison, '13, or C.
H. Tallant/'ll, depending on who gets
in his best jump tomorrow.
Much rivalry is shown between the
various relay teams. The Juniors,
Sophomores and Freshmen , all lay
claim to this event and a hot race is
anticipated.
