# WORK ON AUXILIARY FIELDS IS PROGRESSING RAPIDLY.
## Baseball Diamond Will Soon be Ready for Use.â€”Grass to be Sown on Old Saw Dust Field. 
### 
Two turf fields for the football
squad together with a Varsity and
auxiliary baseball diamond will bring
joy to the hearts of the athletes who
turn out for these sports next year.
Work has begun on the new grounds,
and, altho impeded by the inclement
weather, has been renewed once more
since the reign of Jupiter Pluvius has
for a time come to an end.
The new auxiliary turf fields will
cover the ground heretofore occupied
by the saw dust field. Several ploughs
have been put on the job, and it will
not be long before the seed will be
sown.
The future auxiliary baseball dia
mond is also well on the road to com
pletion, and will soon be in a fit con
dition to be laid off by the engineer.
