# INTERSCHOLASTIC TRACK MEET PROMISES TO BE BIG SUCCESS
## Over 175 Athletes to Enter Sixth Annual Affair. Star Performances Assured in Every Event. 
### 
One hundred and seventy-five ath
letes representing thirty-six of Califor
nia's foremost preparatory institutions
will compete for honors in the Stanford
Interscholastic next Saturday. The
list of entries includes a faster bunch
of men than has ever entered the In
terscholastic in previous years, and
several records will be broken if the
preps can repeat their past perform
ances.
Oakland High has evidently entered
the meet with the best she has, and
will journey down next Saturday with
high hopes of carrying home the
laurels. Three men will wear the
blue and white in every event on both
track and field, and if their past rec
ords can be used as a criterion, they
should handily walk away with the
Winning Team Cup.
L, A. High Enters.
Contrary to previous reports, both
Los Angeles High and Los Angeles
Polytechnic will enter teams. Los
Angeles High, although entering only
seven men, will probably have the
strongest tear 1 which w'll ' ome .p
from the South, and should make
things lively for the Oakland boys in
the fight for first place.
To pick the man who will be hon
ored with the Individual Cup this year,
is a difficult task. Maker of Oakland,
and Kelly of Orange Union High
School appear to be the most likely
contenders for this trophy. Maker
runs the hurdle races in:15.4 and
:2f>.2 respectively, covers over 22 feet
in the broad and is accredited with .">
feet. 11 inches in the high jump. Mel
vin another Oakland man has good
records in both the weights and the
polo vault.
Kelly, the lone entry from his school
looks like the most versatile athlete
in the list. He also does the hurdles
with records of :15.4 and :2G.1. He
is doing : 23.2 in the furlong, leaps
over 20 feet, and is expected to make
an excellent showing in the shot
put.
Stars Filtered in Hurdles.
Taking the meet in a general way,
the hurdles seem to be the most popu
lar events for the star athletes in the
secondary schools. It is found that six
of the men in the high hurdles can
boast of :1C).1 or better. Among this
number are Dawson of Los Angeles,
Ward of I*. S. C. and Templeton of
Palo Alto. Maker and Kelly previous
ly mentioned have both done :l. r >.4 this
season, and the Interscholastic Record
of : 1(1 flat should be lowered. The
entries in the low hurdles should also
come thru with some classy exhibi
tions.
Rogers of Lick will have to duplicate
his records of : 10.1 and:22.2 in the
sprints, and will probably have to do
better if he expects to capture these
events this year. Johnson, the speedy
little man from Los Angeles, has cov
ered the ground in:10 flat and : 22.1
and is running in fine form. Thomas

of San Jose should also make a strong
bid in the short distances, having con
sistent performances of :10.1 and
22:3 to back him up. Larner of Oak
land may also be relied upon for:22.3
next Saturday.
JlcClure's Kecord in Danger.
The middle distances will afford
interesting contests. Larner of Oak
land has done :51 but Macauley's rec
ord of :50.3 is in a class by itself and
should stand. The half mile record
held by McClure of Los Angeles at
2:03 will undoubtedly be disputed, and
the present holder will have one more
chance to better it. He will run into
a hard man in Heisen of Oakland, who
has done 2:01.4. Boone of San Ber
nardino will also be seen in the front
ranks at the finish of these races. He
has been timed at :52 fiat and 2:03.2.
No record breakers can be found ui
the mile, Heisen of Oakland being the
only man who has touched the 4:40
mark. He should take this race unless
Mills of Petaluma comes thru phenom
enally well on the day of the meet.
' ru,, t War' l of U. 3. C. Preparatory
School will take the high jump is
almost a foregone conclusion after his
leap of 6 feet, 2 inches made at Ber
keley two weeks ago. McFie of Los
Angeles, Maker of Oakland and Teni
pleton of Palo Alto should press him
hard with their records of 5 feet, 11
inches and better.
Hrond Jump a Good Event.
The broad jump will be close. The
twenty-foot mark seems to be a com
mon lighting place for about a dozen
or more of the contestants. Dawson
of Los Angeles with 22 feet, 5 inches
and Maker of Oakland with 22 feet,
look good in this event.
Oakland offers three men with rec
ords of over 11 feet in the pole vault,
foremost among whom is Melvin with
11 feet, 5 inches. San Jose High also
has two men entered who should clear
11 feet in the meet.
The hammer throw will be easy for
Melvin of Oakland if he can approach
his 172-foot record. Hadley of Modes
to with 155 feet and Drake of Santa
Rosa with 153 feet, will be his closest
competitors, judging from past per
formances.
Rice's record of 49 feet, 8/ inches
in the shot put will be given a close
run by Clement from U. S. C. Pre
paratory School, lie is getting under
the weight in wonderful form and has
heaved it 49 feet, 7' t inches this sea
son. Melvin of Oakland, Couch of
Manzanita, Hurd of Throop and Lee of
Modesto should all give performances
of 45 feet or slightly better.
San Jose High will do every thing
in their power to hold the Relay Cup
for another year. Their team is com
posed of three veterans of last year's
winning delegation, and they expect to
come close to their record of 3:21.4
established in the last meet. Los
Angeles High will also have a crack
bunch in the final event of the day.
