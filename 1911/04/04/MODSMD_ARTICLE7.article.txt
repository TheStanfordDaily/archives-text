This is Interscholastic Week. The
next few days should mean much to
Stanford. On ourselves alone depends

just what they will
mean. Ours is the re
sponsibility.
From present prospects,

the meet augurs well to be the most
successful yet held. This success most
assuredly can be guaranteed if the
Stanford Student Body assumes the
right attitude toward the Interscholas
tic. It is up to every man to do his
very utmost to make the big event the
great success it deserves to be. It will
be our duty and our pleasure as hosts
to show our guests the most enjoyable
time possible, and it will be our priv
ilege to give many of them their first
insight into University life. The in
spiration thus afforded the preparatory
student is undoubtedly the greatest
benefit, of the Interscholastic Track
Meet.
The responsibility of success must
not be left entirely to the Board.
Every Stanford man is on the recep
tion committee and is expected to of
fer the key to the farm to all who
come, give them llie glad hand and let
them know that they are welcome.
The Stanford Spirit means unselfish
ness and hospitabilit.v. (let into the
game and show it.
