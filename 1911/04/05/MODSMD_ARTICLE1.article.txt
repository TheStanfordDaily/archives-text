eteuia, "Dad' fear
ing a possible
breakdown under
the unfavorable
conditions prevail
ing. Captain Bel
lah himself with
drew from the com
petition after mak
ing a couple of
jumps in the broad.

The finishes of the quarter and the
relay both found the bleachers in a
wild uproar. In the former, W. Daw

stretch and held it around the curve.
Gradually gaining when the tape came
