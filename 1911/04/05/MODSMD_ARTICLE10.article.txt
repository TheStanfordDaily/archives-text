Stanford and California will meet in
five Intercollegiate events Friday and
Saturday of next week. The interest
of the Student Body will be keyed to
the highest pitch. It will first find
audible expression in the Rally which
will give our teams the final sendoff.
Notice that we said "teams" and not
team. Second semester rallies have
been too exclusively devoted to Track.
Not that Track deserves any less at
tention, but other activities deserve
more than they have been receiving.
We would suggest that there be speak
ers for Track, Boating, Tennis and
Debating at. the coming Rally. All
should receive an equally hearty re
sponse from the rooters and each act
ivity made to feel that it has the united
cooperation of the Student Body.
