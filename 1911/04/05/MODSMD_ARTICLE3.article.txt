# HAGUE TRIBUNAL FOUND EFFECTIVE
## Baron d'Estournelles de Constant Upholds Efficacy of Arbitration Court, at Well Attended Assembly. 
### 
Admitting that France had suffered
greatly in the past from useless wars,
Baron d'Estournelles de Constant told
a crowded Assembly this morning how
she had learned through her misfor
tunes, and today is taking a leading
part in the splendid movement to re
place war with organized justice as a
means of settling disputes between the
nations of the world.
In opening his talk. Baron Constant
paid a fine tribute to President Jordan
and told of the dismay it had caused
him two years ago, when the news
papers reported that Dr. Jordan had
said that France was a dying nation,
and his relief when he learned the true
attitude of Stanford's president. He
went on to speak of the work of the
French explorers in America, and of
the work of Lafayette and Rocham
beau and expressed the hope that
France still might serve the republic
it. had formerly befriended.
Taking up the main topic of his ad
dress, the substitution of arbitration
for war, he quoted the recent words of
President Wheeler of the University of
California, who said that America's
three foreign wars in the last hundred
years had all been unnecessary. The
wars of France had also been unneces
sary he said, and told graphically how
the uselessness and criminality o! it
had been deeply impressed upon him
on the occasion of the first visit of the
members of the French Parliament
with those of England. It was out of
such interchanges of visits as these lie
said, that a new spirit had grown up
in France, a feeling of amity towards
other nations, a spirit that encouraged
and rendered possible such a visit as
this that he, a member of the French
Parliament, was now making. Under
the old regime his absence on such an
errand would have been condemned,
whereas now it was approved.
Baron de Constant next ridiculed
the recurrent rumor that war between
the United States and Japan is inevita
ble. "Japan has not the least desire

for such a war; it would mean suicide
for her," he said.
The actual achievements of the Court
of the Hague which is to replace war
as the arbiter of disputes between na
tions was the next topic taken up.
As the Supreme Court of the United
States has jurisdiction over the states,
so is the Court of the Hague planned
to have jurisdiction between the na
tions of the world. After its establish
ment by the first Hague Conference, it
remained unused until in 1902, when
Baron de Constant succeeded in getting
the United States to refer the Mexican
case to it for arbitration. The case
was speedily and satisfactorily settled.
It was about this time that the Baron
succeeded in persuading Andrew Car
negie to donate the funds for the Peace
Palace, and he predicted that in
twenty-five years, the nations would
regard it as a lasting disgrace to
themselves that they had allowed a
private individual to perform such a
task that was theirs to do.
Perhaps the most striking work of
the Court was the settlement of the
Dogger Bank case, which arose from
the Russian warships firing on Eng
lish fishing boats. "Fifteen years ago,"
the speaker said, "war would have in
evitably resulted." The Hague courts
decision was just and satisfactory to
both nations involved. Next France
and Germany submitted to it the Casa
Bianca question, an involved and im
portant matter, which in former times
might easily have led to serious
trouble.
"Inevitable war is the dream, the
organization of justice the reality."
"War belongs to the past," said the
speaker," and arbitration is out task,
but it is not the last word. The great
er work, conciliation, remains for
the generations to come."
Before Baron de Constant's address,
M. Merou, French consul in San Fran
cisco, gave a few brief remarks on the
warm friendship existing between
France and the United States.

and rendered possible such a visit as
this that he, a member of the French
Parliament, was now making. Under
the old regime his absence on such an
errand would have been condemned,
whereas now it was approved.
Baron de Constant next ridiculed
the recurrent rumor that war between
the United States and Japan is inevita
ble. "Japan has not the least desire

for such a war; it would mean suicide
for her," he said.
The actual achievements of the Court
of the Hague which is to replace war
as the arbiter of disputes between na
tions was the next topic taken up.
As the Supreme Court of the United
States has jurisdiction over the states,
so is the Court of the Hague planned
to have jurisdiction between the na
tions of the world. After its establish
ment by the first Hague Conference, it
remained unused until in 1902, when
Baron de Constant succeeded in getting
the United States to refer the Mexican
case to it for arbitration. The case
was speedily and satisfactorily settled.
It was about this time that the Baron
succeeded in persuading Andrew Car
negie to donate the funds for the Peace
Palace, and he predicted that in
twenty-five years, the nations would
regard it as a lasting disgrace to
themselves that they had allowed a
private individual to perform such a
task that was theirs to do.
Perhaps the most striking work of
the Court was the settlement of the
Dogger Bank case, which arose from
the Russian warships firing on Eng
lish fishing boats. "Fifteen years ago,"
the speaker said, "war would have in
evitably resulted." The Hague courts
decision was just and satisfactory to
both nations involved. Next France
and Germany submitted to it the Casa
Bianca question, an involved and im
portant matter, which in former times
might easily have led to serious
trouble.
"Inevitable war is the dream, the
organization of justice the reality."
"War belongs to the past," said the
speaker," and arbitration is out task,
but it is not the last word. The great
er work, conciliation, remains for
the generations to come."
Before Baron de Constant's address,
M. Merou, French consul in San Fran
cisco, gave a few brief remarks on the
warm friendship existing between
France and the United States.
Admitting that France had suffered
greatly in the past from useless wars,
Baron d'Estournelles de Constant told
a crowded Assembly this morning how
she had learned through her misfor
tunes, and today is taking a leading
part in the splendid movement to re
place war with organized justice as a
means of settling disputes between the
nations of the world.
In opening his talk. Baron Constant
paid a fine tribute to President Jordan
and told of the dismay it had caused
him two years ago, when the news
papers reported that Dr. Jordan had
said that France was a dying nation,
and his relief when he learned the true
attitude of Stanford's president. He
went on to speak of the work of the
French explorers in America, and of
the work of Lafayette and Rocham
beau and expressed the hope that
France still might serve the republic
it. had formerly befriended.
Taking up the main topic of his ad
dress, the substitution of arbitration
for war, he quoted the recent words of
President Wheeler of the University of
California, who said that America's
three foreign wars in the last hundred
years had all been unnecessary. The
wars of France had also been unneces
sary he said, and told graphically how
the uselessness and criminality o! it
had been deeply impressed upon him
on the occasion of the first visit of the
members of the French Parliament
with those of England. It was out of
such interchanges of visits as these lie
said, that a new spirit had grown up
in France, a feeling of amity towards
other nations, a spirit that encouraged
and rendered possible such a visit as
this that he, a member of the French
Parliament, was now making. Under
