The boxing events will be the same
that were to have taken place in En
cina Hall the Friday before vacation,
but which were postponed owing to
the condition of the floor. There are
but three or four men remaining in
each class, and judging from the show
ing made so far, Friday's bouts ought
to be exceptionally fast and close.
What promises to be a big wrestling
affair will also be contested during the
same evening. The Olympic Club, Cal
ifornia, and Stanford will enter their
best mat men, which insures some
clever contests.
