"We are today consuming three
times as much timber as we are grow
ing," declared Chief Forester of the
United States H. S. Graves, yesterday
evening in addressing the Forestry
Club in the Botany Lecture Room.
"Forests in the eastern and south-east
ern parts of the United States are
practically all gone and unless steps
are taken immediately, this condition
will prevail everywhere."
The Botany Lecture Room was filled
to its fullest capacty by the many in
terested in the forestry movement.
They were not disappointed in finding
Mr. Graves an authority on the sub
ject. Introduced by Professor V. L.
Kellogg, he spoke earnestly for a
greater deference for forestry regula
tion. Since four-fifths of our standing
timber is in private hands it is evident
that the government must take a hand
in timber regulation, he declared.
State reserves and fire patrol was also
advocated by the Chief Forester.
