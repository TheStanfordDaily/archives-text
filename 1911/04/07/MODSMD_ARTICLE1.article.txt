# GILFILLAN IS CHOSEN 1912 VARSITY CAPTAIN
## TEAM ELECTS PITCHER FOR DIAMOND LEADER. New Skipper of Nine Has Played in Two California Series, and is Experienced Pitcher. 
### 
Sennet William Gilfillan, of Los An
geles, Class of 1912, was this afternoon
unanimously elected Captain of the
1912 Varsity baseball team. The Var
sity squad of twelve members met at
Franklin's for their picture at 1:10,
and immediately afterwards chose a
leader for next spring.
Gilfillan has held down the Varsity
mound position for two years. Last
year he alternated with H. B. Reed, '10,
in the box, and in the recent series

with California he was called upon to
do the entire twirling work. Fulfilling
his duty well, in last Saturday's con
test with the Blue and Gold, he pitched
a splendid nine innnings. He will
make a strong head for the team in
1912, and the choice could not be
bettered.
The new captain attended Santa
Clara College before entering Stanford
and there acquired experience that has
aided him in playing a strong diamond
game. Gilfillan is a member of Skull
and Snakes and the Delta Tan Delta
fraternity, majoring in Economics. He
served as a Committeeman for the Jun
ior Prom.
