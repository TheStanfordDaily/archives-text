The interest in girls' boating has
been given a new impetus by the re
cent action of the Women's Athletic
Association,in donating the use of two
rowhoats to the Boat Club members.
The boats and oars have been or
dered from San Francisco, and are
expected to arrive next week. It is
probable that it will be necessary for
the members of the club to sign up for
their use, as an unusually large num
ber of girls have signified their inten
tion of rowing. A nominal rent will
be charged.
