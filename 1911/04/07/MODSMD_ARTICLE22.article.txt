### 
Stanford is to do her share in striv
ing to relieve the famine ravaged dis
tricts of China. At a meeting of rep
resentative men and women, called to
gether yesterday by Dr. D. Charles
Gardner, it was resolved to organize a
committee to lead in this work. The
following were named by the Chaplain
as members of this committee: In the
Faculty, Professor P. J. Treat, Assis
tant Registrar J. E. McDowell, Mrs. J.
C. Branner, Mrs. H. H. Ryan, and Mrs.
E. W. Allan; of the Christian associa
tions, D. W. Weist and Miss Hutchins;
of the Cosmopolitan Club, H. S. Chuck,
'11, and G. D. Keystone, '11; of the
Press, L. L. Hill, '11; students, A. E.
Roth, '09, T. H. Turner, '12, Miss L.
Blanchard, '12, and Miss S. Hyatt.
Earnest endeavors will be exerted by
this committee to raise at least $100 by
Wednesday next through subscriptions.
A committee is also to be selected
by Dr. Gardner to collect in every hall
and house on the campus. It is an
nounced that faculty subscriptions
may be left at the Registrar's office
with J. E. McDowell.
The sum collected in this way will
be sent to China thru the Red Cross
Society, who will use it for relief in
the famine district where it is esti
mated that at least one million child
ren alone are suffering.
