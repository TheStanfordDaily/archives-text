On behalf of the Student Body
the Daily Palo Alto wishes to tell
iiil of the visiting preparatory
school athletes that you are wel
come and that the freedom of the
Cardinal campus is yours. We
are glad to have you with us.
Stanford is glad to have you take
such an interest in the Inter
scholastic Track Meet and Tennis
Tournament and we wish you the
very best of good luck for suc
cessful events tomorrow.
Stanford is anxious that the
sixth annual Interscholastic shall
lie a record breaker and she will
do all in her power toward this
end. It is your Interscholastic.
Moreover, while you are with
us, we want you to see Stanford.
TheStiinford Spirit is doubtless
known to you. May you feel and
enjoy it during your visit. The
farm i* yours.

"To promote good sportsmanship
among the schools of the Pacific
Slope," the purpose for which the Stan
ford Interscholastic was founded in
1906 by W. H. B. Fowler, '06, will
again be the reason for the gathering
of representatives from every corner
of the state in the Sixth Stanford In
terscholastic Track Meet on the Oval
tomorrow.
This year, the number of schools
entered and the number of partici
pants who are scheduled to appear,
shows a steady and encouraging in
crease over the figures of previous
seasons. But twenty-three schools
sent delegates here in the spring of
1906. This number has slowly but
surely grown, thirty-five schools en
tering last year with a representation
of some 150 men. One hundred and
seventy-nine participants will journey
to the country of the Cardinal to rep
resent thirty-seven schools in the

struggle for the championship this
season.
Hani to Pick Winner
Who will carry home the Stanford
Cup (his year? Proverbially a meet
ing of such a large number of prep,
school athletes is a wonderful field for
the dark horse. It is always found
that it is hard to depend on the aver
age young athlete when he gets into
strenuous competition, and when we
consider that twenty points will un
doubtedly bring victory to any team,
an attempt to pick a winner is almost
hopeless. Ten of the seventeen points
which brought the victory to Chico
last year were annexed by Rice in the
weight events, showing that the win
ning team needs only a few star men
to attain the premier position.
Oakland lias Strong Tenm
Keeping these things in mind, and
judging as best we can from past per
formances, It looks as tho Oakland
should bring the high honors back to
the Bay counties with about twenty
points on the final score board. The
wearers of the blue and white give
promise of being well to the front in
many events, and ought to capture
about three first places.
The personnel of their team finds
them well balanced straight thru.
Baxter and Skinnerhave : 10.1 to their
credit in the century; Learner with
:22.3 and:51 flat recorded in his favor
in the furlong and quarter, is their
foremost entry in these events. Heisen
will be their stronghold in the half
and mile, having covered these dis
tances in the fast time of 2:01.4 and
4:40. Nolds, another of their milers, is
said to have done 4::i9 which is equal
to the present Interscholastic record.
Maker, who should make a great bid
for the Encina Cup, will enter four
events, the broad jump, the high jump
and both hurdle races. His past rec
ord stamps him as a versatile athlete
