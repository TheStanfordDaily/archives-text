# STAR ATHLETES WILL COMPETE IN INTERSCHOLASTIC MEET TOMORROW
## Oakland High is Likely Winner Brilliant Performances Anticipated in Struggle for Various Trophies.â€”Preliminary Events Will Be Held in the Morning. WELCOME 
### 
On behalf of the Student Body
the Daily Palo Alto wishes to tell
iiil of the visiting preparatory
school athletes that you are wel
come and that the freedom of the
Cardinal campus is yours. We
are glad to have you with us.
Stanford is glad to have you take
such an interest in the Inter
scholastic Track Meet and Tennis
Tournament and we wish you the
very best of good luck for suc
cessful events tomorrow.
Stanford is anxious that the
sixth annual Interscholastic shall
lie a record breaker and she will
do all in her power toward this
end. It is your Interscholastic.
Moreover, while you are with
us, we want you to see Stanford.
TheStiinford Spirit is doubtless
known to you. May you feel and
enjoy it during your visit. The
farm i* yours.

"To promote good sportsmanship
among the schools of the Pacific
Slope," the purpose for which the Stan
ford Interscholastic was founded in
1906 by W. H. B. Fowler, '06, will
again be the reason for the gathering
of representatives from every corner
of the state in the Sixth Stanford In
terscholastic Track Meet on the Oval
tomorrow.
This year, the number of schools
entered and the number of partici
pants who are scheduled to appear,
shows a steady and encouraging in
crease over the figures of previous
seasons. But twenty-three schools
sent delegates here in the spring of
1906. This number has slowly but
surely grown, thirty-five schools en
tering last year with a representation
of some 150 men. One hundred and
seventy-nine participants will journey
to the country of the Cardinal to rep
resent thirty-seven schools in the

struggle for the championship this
season.
Hani to Pick Winner
Who will carry home the Stanford
Cup (his year? Proverbially a meet
ing of such a large number of prep,
school athletes is a wonderful field for
the dark horse. It is always found
that it is hard to depend on the aver
age young athlete when he gets into
strenuous competition, and when we
consider that twenty points will un
doubtedly bring victory to any team,
an attempt to pick a winner is almost
hopeless. Ten of the seventeen points
which brought the victory to Chico
last year were annexed by Rice in the
weight events, showing that the win
ning team needs only a few star men
to attain the premier position.
Oakland lias Strong Tenm
Keeping these things in mind, and
judging as best we can from past per
formances, It looks as tho Oakland
should bring the high honors back to
the Bay counties with about twenty
points on the final score board. The
wearers of the blue and white give
promise of being well to the front in
many events, and ought to capture
about three first places.
The personnel of their team finds
them well balanced straight thru.
Baxter and Skinnerhave : 10.1 to their
credit in the century; Learner with
:22.3 and:51 flat recorded in his favor
in the furlong and quarter, is their
foremost entry in these events. Heisen
will be their stronghold in the half
and mile, having covered these dis
tances in the fast time of 2:01.4 and
4:40. Nolds, another of their milers, is
said to have done 4::i9 which is equal
to the present Interscholastic record.
Maker, who should make a great bid
for the Encina Cup, will enter four
events, the broad jump, the high jump
and both hurdle races. His past rec
ord stamps him as a versatile athlete
of the first water, his time of :15.4 iu
the high hurdles being one-fifth better
than the present record. Melvin, with
his 11 feet, 5 inches in the pole and 172
feet in the hammer, is conceded a
place among the likely high point
winners.
The strength of Oakland's team lies
in the fact that she has not only sev
eral stars but has also a number of
second and third place men. Unless
the team undergoes a bad reversal of
form, it is doubtful whether any other
school will be able to deprive her of
first place.
Los Angeles Enters Star Men.
The "dope sheet" must also concede
a promising outlook for Los Angeles
and Berkeley High Schools. Dawson,
McClure, and Johnson form a formid
able trio coming from the southern
part of the state. Dawson looks like a
winner in the broad jump and after his
performances of :15.4 in the high
hurdles only a week ago, he must be
conceded a brilliant opportunity to
lower the record of :16 in this event.
McClure, the present holder of the
record of 2:03 in the half mile, will
run both the middle distance races.
He will have to defend his title against
Heisen of Oakland who is said to be

running consistently in the half with
a record of 2:01.4. Johnson is the
speedy little sprinter from the South
land, who has won his events in:10
flat and:22.1. These three men will
make their presence very appreciably
felt in tomorrow's meet, both in the
race for individual honors and in the
struggle for the championship cup.
Berkeley an Unkuowu Quantity.
Berkeley sends no record of the fif
teen men who will wear her colors in
the meet. They have the largest team
in the field and may upset the "dope
sheet" somewhat.
In a field of 179 contestants it is al
most impossible to pick the highest
individual point winner. Any attempt
to pick the man who will carry away
the Encina Cup amounts to little more
than a mere guess. Half a dozen or
more of the young stars are in line for
this honor, being possible winners of
ten or more points. Kelly of Orange
Union, Maker, Heisen and Melvin of
Oakland and Johnson, McClure and
Dawson of Los Angeles will all be in
the running, and which will be able to
eclipse the others, is problematical.
San Jose Out for Relay Cup
The Bittner Cup, the coveted relay
trophy which is at present held by
San Jose, is again looked to by the
team from the Garden City. With three
veterans of last year's victorious
bunch, the team will be chosen from
Adams, Hamlin, Rice, Smitherum,
Thomas and Williams.
San Jose is out to retain that cup
and it is not unlikely that she will.
Los Angeles will also put her best in
the race, and with McClure, Stanton,
Clark, Johnson and Sheldon, should
stand an excellent chance.
Preliminaries in Morning
The meet will be run off as rapidly
as possible beginning at 2 o'clock. Ow
ing to the unwieldly size of the entry
list, all heats in the sprints and pre
liminaries in the field events will be
held on the Oval at 10 o'clock in the
morning. In the afternoon, six men
only will compete in the finals of the
events on the field, and none but the
finals of the track events will be run
at that time.
The relay race and discus-throw
are the only events on the program
which will not be counted on the
score board. Three places will be
counted for their regular value in all
other events.

Baxter and Skinnerhave : 10.1 to their
credit in the century; Learner with
:22.3 and:51 flat recorded in his favor
in the furlong and quarter, is their
foremost entry in these events. Heisen
will be their stronghold in the half
and mile, having covered these dis
tances in the fast time of 2:01.4 and
4:40. Nolds, another of their milers, is
said to have done 4::i9 which is equal
to the present Interscholastic record.
Maker, who should make a great bid
for the Encina Cup, will enter four
events, the broad jump, the high jump
and both hurdle races. His past rec
ord stamps him as a versatile athlete
of the first water, his time of :15.4 iu
the high hurdles being one-fifth better
than the present record. Melvin, with
his 11 feet, 5 inches in the pole and 172
feet in the hammer, is conceded a
place among the likely high point
winners.
The strength of Oakland's team lies
in the fact that she has not only sev
eral stars but has also a number of
second and third place men. Unless
the team undergoes a bad reversal of
form, it is doubtful whether any other
school will be able to deprive her of
first place.
Los Angeles Enters Star Men.
The "dope sheet" must also concede
a promising outlook for Los Angeles
and Berkeley High Schools. Dawson,
McClure, and Johnson form a formid
able trio coming from the southern
part of the state. Dawson looks like a
winner in the broad jump and after his
performances of :15.4 in the high
hurdles only a week ago, he must be
conceded a brilliant opportunity to
lower the record of :16 in this event.
McClure, the present holder of the
record of 2:03 in the half mile, will
run both the middle distance races.
He will have to defend his title against
Heisen of Oakland who is said to be

running consistently in the half with
a record of 2:01.4. Johnson is the
speedy little sprinter from the South
land, who has won his events in:10
flat and:22.1. These three men will
make their presence very appreciably
felt in tomorrow's meet, both in the
race for individual honors and in the
struggle for the championship cup.
Berkeley an Unkuowu Quantity.
Berkeley sends no record of the fif
teen men who will wear her colors in
the meet. They have the largest team
in the field and may upset the "dope
sheet" somewhat.
In a field of 179 contestants it is al
most impossible to pick the highest
individual point winner. Any attempt
to pick the man who will carry away
the Encina Cup amounts to little more
than a mere guess. Half a dozen or
more of the young stars are in line for
this honor, being possible winners of
ten or more points. Kelly of Orange
Union, Maker, Heisen and Melvin of
Oakland and Johnson, McClure and
Dawson of Los Angeles will all be in
the running, and which will be able to
eclipse the others, is problematical.
San Jose Out for Relay Cup
The Bittner Cup, the coveted relay
trophy which is at present held by
San Jose, is again looked to by the
team from the Garden City. With three
veterans of last year's victorious
bunch, the team will be chosen from
Adams, Hamlin, Rice, Smitherum,
Thomas and Williams.
San Jose is out to retain that cup
and it is not unlikely that she will.
Los Angeles will also put her best in
the race, and with McClure, Stanton,
Clark, Johnson and Sheldon, should
stand an excellent chance.
Preliminaries in Morning
The meet will be run off as rapidly
as possible beginning at 2 o'clock. Ow
ing to the unwieldly size of the entry
list, all heats in the sprints and pre
liminaries in the field events will be
held on the Oval at 10 o'clock in the
morning. In the afternoon, six men
only will compete in the finals of the
events on the field, and none but the
finals of the track events will be run
at that time.
The relay race and discus-throw
are the only events on the program
which will not be counted on the
score board. Three places will be
counted for their regular value in all
other events.

"To promote good sportsmanship
among the schools of the Pacific
Slope," the purpose for which the Stan
ford Interscholastic was founded in
1906 by W. H. B. Fowler, '06, will
again be the reason for the gathering
of representatives from every corner
of the state in the Sixth Stanford In
terscholastic Track Meet on the Oval
tomorrow.
This year, the number of schools
entered and the number of partici
pants who are scheduled to appear,
shows a steady and encouraging in
crease over the figures of previous
seasons. But twenty-three schools
sent delegates here in the spring of
1906. This number has slowly but
surely grown, thirty-five schools en
tering last year with a representation
of some 150 men. One hundred and
seventy-nine participants will journey
to the country of the Cardinal to rep
resent thirty-seven schools in the

struggle for the championship this
season.
Hani to Pick Winner
Who will carry home the Stanford
Cup (his year? Proverbially a meet
ing of such a large number of prep,
school athletes is a wonderful field for
the dark horse. It is always found
that it is hard to depend on the aver
age young athlete when he gets into
strenuous competition, and when we
consider that twenty points will un
doubtedly bring victory to any team,
an attempt to pick a winner is almost
hopeless. Ten of the seventeen points
which brought the victory to Chico
last year were annexed by Rice in the
weight events, showing that the win
ning team needs only a few star men
to attain the premier position.
Oakland lias Strong Tenm
Keeping these things in mind, and
judging as best we can from past per
formances, It looks as tho Oakland
should bring the high honors back to
the Bay counties with about twenty
points on the final score board. The
wearers of the blue and white give
promise of being well to the front in
many events, and ought to capture
about three first places.
The personnel of their team finds

Dawson of Los Angeles will all be in
the running, and which will be able to
eclipse the others, is problematical.
San Jose Out for Relay Cup
The Bittner Cup, the coveted relay
trophy which is at present held by
San Jose, is again looked to by the
team from the Garden City. With three
veterans of last year's victorious
bunch, the team will be chosen from
Adams, Hamlin, Rice, Smitherum,
Thomas and Williams.
San Jose is out to retain that cup
and it is not unlikely that she will.
Los Angeles will also put her best in
the race, and with McClure, Stanton,
Clark, Johnson and Sheldon, should
stand an excellent chance.
Preliminaries in Morning
The meet will be run off as rapidly
as possible beginning at 2 o'clock. Ow
ing to the unwieldly size of the entry
list, all heats in the sprints and pre
liminaries in the field events will be
held on the Oval at 10 o'clock in the
morning. In the afternoon, six men
only will compete in the finals of the
events on the field, and none but the
finals of the track events will be run
at that time.
The relay race and discus-throw
are the only events on the program
which will not be counted on the
score board. Three places will be
counted for their regular value in all
other events.
On behalf of the Student Body
the Daily Palo Alto wishes to tell
iiil of the visiting preparatory
school athletes that you are wel
come and that the freedom of the
Cardinal campus is yours. We
are glad to have you with us.
Stanford is glad to have you take
such an interest in the Inter
scholastic Track Meet and Tennis
Tournament and we wish you the
very best of good luck for suc
cessful events tomorrow.
Stanford is anxious that the
sixth annual Interscholastic shall
lie a record breaker and she will
do all in her power toward this
end. It is your Interscholastic.
Moreover, while you are with
us, we want you to see Stanford.
TheStiinford Spirit is doubtless
known to you. May you feel and
enjoy it during your visit. The
farm i* yours.

"To promote good sportsmanship
among the schools of the Pacific
Slope," the purpose for which the Stan
ford Interscholastic was founded in
1906 by W. H. B. Fowler, '06, will
again be the reason for the gathering
of representatives from every corner
of the state in the Sixth Stanford In
terscholastic Track Meet on the Oval
tomorrow.
This year, the number of schools
entered and the number of partici
pants who are scheduled to appear,
shows a steady and encouraging in
crease over the figures of previous
seasons. But twenty-three schools
sent delegates here in the spring of
1906. This number has slowly but
surely grown, thirty-five schools en
tering last year with a representation
of some 150 men. One hundred and
seventy-nine participants will journey
to the country of the Cardinal to rep
resent thirty-seven schools in the

struggle for the championship this
season.
Hani to Pick Winner
Who will carry home the Stanford
Cup (his year? Proverbially a meet
ing of such a large number of prep,
school athletes is a wonderful field for
the dark horse. It is always found
that it is hard to depend on the aver
age young athlete when he gets into
strenuous competition, and when we
consider that twenty points will un
doubtedly bring victory to any team,
an attempt to pick a winner is almost
hopeless. Ten of the seventeen points
which brought the victory to Chico
last year were annexed by Rice in the
weight events, showing that the win
ning team needs only a few star men
to attain the premier position.
Oakland lias Strong Tenm
Keeping these things in mind, and
judging as best we can from past per
formances, It looks as tho Oakland
should bring the high honors back to
the Bay counties with about twenty
points on the final score board. The
wearers of the blue and white give
promise of being well to the front in
many events, and ought to capture
about three first places.
The personnel of their team finds
them well balanced straight thru.
Baxter and Skinnerhave : 10.1 to their
credit in the century; Learner with
:22.3 and:51 flat recorded in his favor
in the furlong and quarter, is their
foremost entry in these events. Heisen
will be their stronghold in the half
and mile, having covered these dis
tances in the fast time of 2:01.4 and
4:40. Nolds, another of their milers, is
said to have done 4::i9 which is equal
to the present Interscholastic record.
Maker, who should make a great bid
for the Encina Cup, will enter four
events, the broad jump, the high jump
and both hurdle races. His past rec
ord stamps him as a versatile athlete
of the first water, his time of :15.4 iu
the high hurdles being one-fifth better
than the present record. Melvin, with
his 11 feet, 5 inches in the pole and 172
feet in the hammer, is conceded a
place among the likely high point
winners.
The strength of Oakland's team lies
in the fact that she has not only sev
eral stars but has also a number of
second and third place men. Unless
the team undergoes a bad reversal of
form, it is doubtful whether any other
school will be able to deprive her of
first place.
Los Angeles Enters Star Men.
The "dope sheet" must also concede
a promising outlook for Los Angeles
and Berkeley High Schools. Dawson,
McClure, and Johnson form a formid
able trio coming from the southern
part of the state. Dawson looks like a
winner in the broad jump and after his
performances of :15.4 in the high
hurdles only a week ago, he must be
conceded a brilliant opportunity to
lower the record of :16 in this event.
McClure, the present holder of the
record of 2:03 in the half mile, will
run both the middle distance races.
He will have to defend his title against
Heisen of Oakland who is said to be

running consistently in the half with
a record of 2:01.4. Johnson is the
speedy little sprinter from the South
land, who has won his events in:10
flat and:22.1. These three men will
make their presence very appreciably
felt in tomorrow's meet, both in the
race for individual honors and in the
struggle for the championship cup.
Berkeley an Unkuowu Quantity.
Berkeley sends no record of the fif
teen men who will wear her colors in
the meet. They have the largest team
in the field and may upset the "dope
sheet" somewhat.
In a field of 179 contestants it is al
most impossible to pick the highest
individual point winner. Any attempt
to pick the man who will carry away
the Encina Cup amounts to little more
than a mere guess. Half a dozen or
more of the young stars are in line for
this honor, being possible winners of
ten or more points. Kelly of Orange
Union, Maker, Heisen and Melvin of
Oakland and Johnson, McClure and
Dawson of Los Angeles will all be in
the running, and which will be able to
eclipse the others, is problematical.
