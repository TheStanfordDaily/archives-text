From across the sea has come a cry
from the famishing millions of China
for help. World wide aid is needed to

save the lives of these
unfortunate people.
The responses must
come from all the na-

tions of the earth if relief can be
effective. These are impossible, how
ever, unless each individual community
contributes its small quota. Stanford
has been asked to give $100. This
seems a small sum when the grand
total needed is considered and we
should gladly extend a helping hand.
Chaplain Gardner has appointed a
relief committee to collect funds and
by Wednesday of next week it is hoped
that a goodly Bum may be sent from
Stanford to our suffering brothers in
the Orient.
