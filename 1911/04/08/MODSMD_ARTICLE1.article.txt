Eighteen points brought vic
tory to the athletes of Los An
geles High School in the sixth
Stanford Interscholastic Track
.Meet held on the Oval this after
noon.
The boys from the Southland
were led by McClure and Daw
son. each of whom captured five
points for the winning team.
To Kelly, of Orange Union
High School, goes the honor of
being the star of the meet. As

the lone entry from Orange Union
High School, he earned the right to
carry home the Thiele, the Encina and
Quadrangle Cups. Two first places
in hurdle races and a second in the
shot-put gave his school second place
on the score boards, and gave him
title to the Encina Cup as the highest
point winner. The Quadrangle Club
Cup, offered by that organization this
year, also goes to him as the highest
individual point winner in the track
events.
To Boone, of San Bernardino, goes
the honor of being the only record
breaker of the day. Running a great
race in the half-mile, he shattered the
record of 2:03 held by McClure, and
established a new figure at 2:02.2.
The Los Angeles team will carry
home the Bittner Cup as well, being
the winners of the relay.
In the morning, the weather was
perfect for atheletic events, but a cold,
brisk wind in the afternoon worked
against the possibility of record break
ing performances. The crowd which
was there eclipses any previous
attendance at an Interscholastic Meet.
Oakland High appeared in force with
blue hats and blue megaphones, and
sported a brass band to encourage its
representatives. Berkeley High and
other schools about the bay aiso had
lar«;e delegations in the bleacher*.
Mile Hiiii.
Heisen, one of Oakland's distance
men, put up a wonderfully heady race
in the mile and won in 4:40.:;. Holding
back for the first three laps, but inn
ing at a steady pace, he did not claim
the lead until rounding the curve com
ing into the home stretch. At this
point, be began to steadily draw away
from his rival contestants and finished
about six yards to the good. Hail of
Chico, who led for the first three laps,
could not keep up the pace and was
unable to finish. Cooper of .Modesto
ran a strong second, holding the lead

for part of the last lap, but was out
classed on the finish.
100-Yard Dasli.
Stevens proved to be the fastest
sprinter on the track when he took
both of his heats in the century and
captured the final event in:10.3. The
brisk wind blowing over the oval
greatly impeded the men, and the time
made was well up to expectations
under these conditions. Stevens held
his lead from the time he left his
marks until the finish altho closely
pressed. Jackson of Citrus Union,
.Johnson of Los Angeles and Rogers of
Lick made a wonderful fight for sec
ond. all finishing within two yards of
the winner.
120-Yard Hurdles.
Running against the wind and leav
ing every hurdle in its original posi
tion, Kelly of Orange Union tied the
record of :16 fiat made by Heath of
Harvard in 1909. The race was won
by inches, Lee of Chico going over the
sticks in great form and almost mak
ing the event a dead heat. Templeton
of Palo Alto, and Ward of U. S. C.
lirej). made a great fight for third hon
ors, lint the Palo Alto boy stretched

out on the finish and went over the
line about a hall" a yard ahead.
2*20-Yard Dash.
Rogers of Lick defended his title in
this event by tying his record of :22.2.
Coming away in the midst of the bunch
at the sound of the gun, his long
ground-covering stride put him to the
front. He came through with a whirl
wind finish and broke the tape well in
the lead. Jackson of Azusa and .John
son of Los Angeles took second and
third honors respectively.
440-Yard Dasli.
Mc Clure and Stanton of Los Ange
les were in a class by themselves in
this event. McClure took a lead of
three yards over his team-mate at the
start and held it all the way, the two
men finishing in this order. McClure's
lead was never in danger, Clark of
Berkeley, who led the pack, finishing
third about five yards behind Stanton.
Half Mile
Breaking the record of 2:03 made by
McClure last year, Boone of San Ber
nardino ran a strong race and won
handily in 2:02.2. Boone fought his
way to the pole and took a substantial
lead of fifteen yards .which he held
right thru to the finish. Tall of Santa
Clara prep, took the second place.
Heisen of Oakland showed a burst of
speed on the finish and sprang into
the third position in the last ten yards
of the race.
220-Yiird Hurdles.
Running in smooth machine-like
form, Kelly of Orange Union annexed
five more points in this event. Gain
ing a slight advantage at the start,
Kelly gradually increased his lead and
shot over the finish line about three
yards ahead of Lee of Chieo who took
second. J. Urban of Mountain View
ran a close third.
Field Events.
Numerous entries made all of the

field events close contests, but the
competition failed to cause any new
records to be established. Ward of I\
S. C. prep, came within one-half an
inch of high jump record of 6 feet, 1
inch, but was unable after winning
the event, to put the mark any higher.
Dawson of Los Angeles annexed five
points in the broad with a leap of 21
feet, fi inches. Stevens of Woodland,
who took the second place, later jump
ed 22 feet, (i/ inches, but will not be
allowed a record in this event as the
jump was not made in competition.
The pole vault went to Eldridge of
Healdsburg at 11 feet, 2 inches.
The weights were good events, but
fell considerably under the phenome
nal records made by Rice last year.
Villas of Berkeley took the hammer
throw, Clement, the big man from U.
S. C. prep, annexed the shot put, while
the discus-throw was claimed by Shel
don of Los Angeles.
Relay.
The relay was another victory to be
added to the laurels already earned
by the Los Angeles boys. The first
la]) was about an even break for Los
Angeles, Oakland and San Jose. Oak
land led easily at the end of the sec
ond and maintained their advantage
through the third. McClure of Los
Angeles then did the work. Passing
the entire field he clipped off a great
lap, and gave his team eight yards
headway at the start of the final round.
Johnson of Los Angeles finished the
race, winning by about four yards
