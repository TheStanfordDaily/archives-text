# STRACHAN OF LOWELL HIGH TENNIS SINGLES CHAMPION
## Defeats Herd of Throop in Brilliant Racquet Contest on Encina Club Courts This Morning. 
### 
John Strachan of Lowell High
School, San Francisco, defeated Clif
ton Herd of Throop Polytechnic In
stitute, Pasadena, and won the Inter
scholastic Singles Championship on
the Encina courts today in one of the
gamiest tennis matches ever played on
the Coast.
Strachan took the first set by a score
of 7 to 5. His brilliant work at the
net, where again and again he re
turned balls that seemed to be far be
yond his reach, won him much ap
plause from the spectators.
Strachan opened the second set by
taking a love game from his opponent,
but lost his lead after the second game
and Herd easily annexed the set.
Score, 6 to 3. By clever up-court plac
ing, Herd tired his opponent and
Strachan's service weakened.
The first game of the third set went
to Strachan, but the next four games
were easy for Herd. Strachan rallied
strongly and fought gamely until he
tied the score, four all. With the score
at five all, Herd displayed strength
and took the set, 7 to 5.
Herd started out strong in the fourth
set, and took the first two games.
Strachan annexed the next four games
by fast net work, resorting to high
lobs when he was driven deep into the
court. Each player took a game, then
Herd pluckily ralied strong and took
two games in succession. Strachan
came back, however, and took the set,
7 to 5, in which Herd fought stub
bornly for every point.
Strachen wrested the first three
games from Herd in the final set by
line play from behind the net, keep
ing his opponent in the back court by
fast play. With the score 4 to 2, the
plucky Pasadena lad attempted to pull
up by driving to the back line. His
opponent's play seemed to benefit
more by the rests between sets how
ever, and he placed more accurately,
taking the next three games.
Herd became a runner-up by de
feating T. Foley of Mission High, Dodge
of Los Angeles High, and W. Fottrell
of St. Ignatius. Strachan defeated
E. Fottrell, who won the champion
ship last year, in straight sets 6-1, 6-1.

for track. The finals will be played

the Encina courts today in one of the
gamiest tennis matches ever played on
the Coast.
Strachan took the first set by a score
of 7 to 5. His brilliant work at the
net, where again and again he re
turned balls that seemed to be far be
yond his reach, won him much ap
plause from the spectators.
Strachan opened the second set by
taking a love game from his opponent,
but lost his lead after the second game
and Herd easily annexed the set.
Score, 6 to 3. By clever up-court plac
ing, Herd tired his opponent and
Strachan's service weakened.
The first game of the third set went
to Strachan, but the next four games
were easy for Herd. Strachan rallied
strongly and fought gamely until he
tied the score, four all. With the score
at five all, Herd displayed strength
and took the set, 7 to 5.
Herd started out strong in the fourth
set, and took the first two games.
Strachan annexed the next four games
by fast net work, resorting to high
lobs when he was driven deep into the
court. Each player took a game, then
Herd pluckily ralied strong and took
two games in succession. Strachan
came back, however, and took the set,
7 to 5, in which Herd fought stub
bornly for every point.
Strachen wrested the first three
games from Herd in the final set by
line play from behind the net, keep
ing his opponent in the back court by
fast play. With the score 4 to 2, the
plucky Pasadena lad attempted to pull
up by driving to the back line. His
opponent's play seemed to benefit
more by the rests between sets how
ever, and he placed more accurately,
taking the next three games.
Herd became a runner-up by de
feating T. Foley of Mission High, Dodge
of Los Angeles High, and W. Fottrell
of St. Ignatius. Strachan defeated
E. Fottrell, who won the champion
ship last year, in straight sets 6-1, 6-1.
The doubles play was held up by the
trackmeet, several of the racquet
wielders registered for doubles being
for track. The finals will be played
tomorrow morning.
