The apparent disregard of the Busi
ness Office for University progress was
exemplified again in a small way last

Friday evening,
when the lights
of the gymnas
ium were turned

out before the completion of the box
ing and wrestling tournament, altho
the proper authorities of the Business
Office had been notified that the lights
were needed, and had in turn, given 110
intimation that the request would not
be granted.
Some weeks before, a like display of
the ineffable pettiness and seeming
spitefulness which so often character
izes the conduct of the Business Office
was seen in the refusal to permit, the
life of the gym mats in Encina Club
room for the wrestling tournament 011
the occasion of the Encina reception
to the Faculty.
Lack of space makes it impossible to
mention briefly all the other similar
affairs of apparently small concern,
which only recently have come to our
notice. We omit to speak of the re
fusal to allow the band to play 011 the
Inner Quadrangle, the Encina Club to
give a little Christmas vacation dance,
the compilers of the Alumni Directory
to have complimentary copies of their
own volume, the Student Body, to have
dirt at a reasonable rate for its base
ball diamond, the departments, equip
ment at reasonable rates, or the stu
dents, dry walks to the Terrace. We
omit to speak of the really fundament
al needs of Stanford for fear that their
mere mention by us would ipso facto
set 1 he Business Office against their
attainment and apparently for no
other reason than that the "Children
of California" desire them. We realize
that the mere demand from the mouth

piece of students for a needed reform
seems in the eyes of the Business Offi
ce to be the most potent argument
against the granting of that reform.
Can a more shameful state of affairs
be imagined? And to think that one
of the greatest of America's universi
ties has to maintain its position with
other universities with such a mill
stone around its neck.
