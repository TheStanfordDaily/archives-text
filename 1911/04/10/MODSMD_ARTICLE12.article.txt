During this week the Stanford com
munity will be given an opportunity to
share in the world-wide movement for
the relief of the terrible
Brotherhood famine in China. Each
year famine rages in
some portion of that unhappy land,
and this spring the conditions are ex
ceptionally appalling. In 1906-1907,
some 2,000,000 Chinese were destroyed
by famine and its accompanying dis
eases. This year, in the provinces of
Kiangsu and Anhwei some 2,500,000
persons are affected. So low is the
standard of living, so poverty-stricken
are the people, so inefficient is the
governmental organization, that relief
from abroad is imperatively necessary
if many of these starving people, es
pecially the women and children, are
to be saved. Our government has ap
propriated $50,000 and loaned an army
transport for the conveyance of sup
plies, but this is a mere pittance in
comparison with the needs of the af
flicted people.
President Taft, as president of the
American Red Cross, has appealed to
our people at large for money or
supplies. In such a movement Uni
versity people should take a prominent
part, and the University of Washing
ton, the American University nearest
the Orient, has commenced the raising
of funds. Stanford, with its increasing
interest in affairs beyond the Pacific,
should be first to follow this humane
lead.
It is not the Intention of the Stan
ford committee to call for large con
tributions, but it asks for the thotful
cooperation of all the students and
faculty in this worthy cause. The
money collected will be turned over to
the American Red Cross which will
cable it to China and render it im
mediately available for relief work.
Every dollar expended will mean tem
! porary relief for a score of people.
