"At a meeting of the Committee on
Student Affairs held on April 6th, the
following case was considered:
"A student received a hook from the
loan desk in the Library for use in the
reading room. The charge slip con
tained the words 'This card does not
entitle you to take the book from the
Library.' The student signed the slip
with a name not his own and unknown

the book from the Library keeping it
for two weeks.
"The Student was suspended from
