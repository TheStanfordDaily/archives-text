# REV. DANA BARTLETT PREACHES ON THE RELIGION OF SERVICE.
## "Loving One's Neighbor" Subject of Talk by Noted Los Angeles Reformer. 
### 
Sincere words from the heart of one
whose helpful life-work has been the
strongest testimony to the value of his
teachings, made the sermon yesterday
morning a special inspiration to all
who know Reverend Dana Bartlett as
one of the foremost of California's
Christian workers. He chose as his
subject, "The Gracious Art of Loving
One's Neighbor," using as his text the
two great commandments of Christ.
"I am glad," said Dr. Bartlett, "that
the first commandment is to love thy
God with all thy heart. . . . Christ
represents complete oneness with God.
. . . Our hearts, too can become God
filled if we practice the presence of
God in our silent moments. . . .
Religion is more than emotion. Love
is reasonable, and so the text contin
ues, 'and with all thy understanding.'
Today in the psychological labora-
Tories we are studying God's deeper
laws and coming to know the scientific
basis for our beliefs."
He then turned to the second part
or the text, "Thou shalt love thy
neighbor as thyself." In this connec
tion two essentials were emphasized,
first that any one any where who is in
need of help is our neighbor; and sec
ond, that, if the measure of our neigh
borly love is to be "as thyself," we
must esteem highly our own possi
bilities and responsibilities as agents
thru whom the will of God is to be
carried out.
At the close of the sermon, Dr. Gard
ner made a short plea on behalf of the
famine sufferers in China, asking for
the cooperation of the students in rais
ing Stanford's pledge of one hundred
dollars before Wednesday afternoon.
Dr. Gardner also announced the
special Daily Chapel services for this
last week of Lent and the celebration
of the Lord's Supper to be held Thurs
day evening in the Vestry.
The music for the morning was tin
usually effective, the choir being as
sisted by a stringed orchestra.
