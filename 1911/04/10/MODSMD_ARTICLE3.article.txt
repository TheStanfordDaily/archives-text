# PINERO'S "AMAZONS" IS PLAY CHOSEN BY SENIOR COMMITTEE
## 1911 Will Present Clever Farce Noted Playwright During Commencement Week.â€”Cast Almost Complete. 
### 
'The Amazons," a farce comedy in
three acts by the famous English dram
atist, Sir A. W. Pinero, will be the
Senior Play presented during Com
mencement Week by the Class of
1911. This is the announcement that
comes today from the committee
whose duty it was to choose a play to
be presented by the Class.
The cast of the play is not quite
complete. One or two minor charac
ters still remain to be chosen, but the
final announcement of the players will
be known within a day or two. It is
admitted, however, by the committee,
that many of the best known thespians
of the University will be seen on the
boards during the Senior Week.
The play is an excellent farce.
Pinero, the author, is by far the best
known of all the English dramatists.
In the opinion of many he is the
world's leading dramatist at the pres
ent time. As a master of dramatic

technique he is without a peer among
living playwrights.
The play deals with the family
troubles of an ancient English house.
The family has always longed for a
son and heir, but at the death of the
head of the house, three comely daugh
ters are the only children. Chagrined
at not having a son, the father has
trained the daughters in all the manly
sports. They ride, fish, hunt, and even
box, and are so extremely boyish that
they wear clothes which are commonly
found on members of the other sex. A
foppish lord, and a young Oxford ath
lete, are put down in this house, and
then the troubles begin. The lines are
full of brilliant humor, and the situa
tions are extremely laughable. The
play ranks among the best of the
author's lighter works and should
make a splendid addition to Stanford's
already long line of dramatic suc
cesses.
