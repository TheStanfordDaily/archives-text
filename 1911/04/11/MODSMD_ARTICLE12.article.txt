# STANFORD BOAT CLUB WILL HOLD CANDY SALE TOMORROW
## 
### 
A candy sale will be held tomorrow
in the Women's Rest Room under the
auspices of the Stanford Boat Club.
All women are urged to patronize
home industry and to forego the temp
tation of "Co-ed Chocolates" for this
once.
The officers of the Boat Club also
wish to announce emphatically that
hereafter the clubhouse will be kept
locked, consequently each house and
also individual members, if they so de
sire, must purchase their own keys at
once from the president, Miss D. Marx,
'11. These are sold at ten cents a piece.
If any girls desire to join the Boat
Club this semester, they may do so by
paying two dollars to Miss Julia Brun
ner or Miss D. Marx.
