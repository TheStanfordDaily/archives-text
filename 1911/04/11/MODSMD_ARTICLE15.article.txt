# JAPANESE NINES WILL SOON PLAY CARDINAL
## WASEDA AND KEIO VARSITIES TO VISIT HERE. Orient's Foremost Baseball Cracksmen Will Tour States.â€”Another Game With Santa Clara. 
### 
Baseball will take a new lease on the
18th., when the touring Nipponese nine
from the University of Waseda, will go
into action against the Cardinal on the
turf diamond. The first week in May
with the 6th, as the probable date, will
see another group of ball tossers from
the Island Kingdom wearing the colors
of the University of Keio, as guests of
the locals for the last baseball "at
home" of the season.
Between these games with the visi
tors from the Far East, the Cardinal
sluggers will meet the Mission Colle
gians from Santa Clara in San Mateo on
April 29, in a benefit game for the Free
Kindergarten of San Mateo. The op
posing teams will be entertained that
noon at the Peninsular Hotel by the
patronesses of the Kindergarten.
Graduate Manager D. W. Burbank has
been exceedingly fortunate in securing
games with these touring Japanese
players. The annual struggle between
these colleges stirs up the same sort
of interest that the Intercollegiate
Series between Stanford and California
awakens along the Pacific Coast of the
United States. The Cardinal will thus
have a chance to stack up with the
foremost exponents of the American
National game in the Orient.
Altho the little brown men have a
strong complement, the Cardinal play
ers should have no especial difficulty
in belting their scalps.
The Wisconsin Varsity made a trip
to Japan last summer to try out their
performers against the native sons,
and in their series of games there cap
tured the sweepstakes. Now the Ori
ental tossers are enroute for a similar
progress thru the United States.
The Waseda Collegians are coming
upon the invitation of the University
of Chicago and are due to arrive
Thursday. They will remain on the
Coast until the 29, and during that
time they will also engage with the
nines from California and Santa Clara.
A game is also scheduled with a nine
selected from the Waseda alumni who
are at present residing in San Fran
cisco. The University of Keio baseball
scientists will tour the North American
republic under the auspices of the Wis
consin baseball management.
