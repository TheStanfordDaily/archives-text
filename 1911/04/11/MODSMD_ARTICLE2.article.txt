# NEW FEATURES OF SENIOR WEEK WILL ATTRACT LOWER-CLASSMEN
## Program Includes Under-Classman Day and Second University Jolly-Up.—Many Novel Festivities Planned. 
### 
If the present plans of the Senior
Class are successful, Commencement
,
Week this year at Stanford will lie
something for which the Underclass
men will remain. Hitherto practically
none of the members of the Student
Body except the Seniors and Holdovers
have remained for the exercises of the
final week, but this year the Seniors
are making a special effort to induce
everyone to stay.
President H. G. Ferguson has ap
pointed as a committee to arrange for
the entertainment of Underclassmen,
E. C. Matthias, E. W. Pugh, and L. S.
Mann. An Underclassmen's day with
special events, and ending with anoth
er University jolly-up such as is plan
ned for April 28, is part of the attrac
tions already arranged for.
Four additional members of the Sen
ior Prom cimmittee have also been ap
pointed; G. Bevier, Jr., II .Boyd, F.
Farnsworth, and E. L. Ford, '11. The
Senior Prom which closes the events of
Class Day takes place on the evening
of Friday, May 19.
The days of Senior Week are crowd
ed with interest for anyone with the
Stanford spirit at heart. The Class
Day Exercises, The Senior Farce, the
Dedication of the Class Plate, The
Senior-Faculty Baseball Game and the
Promenade Concert in the Quadrangle
are only a few of the filings that, every
Stanford student should not fail to see.
