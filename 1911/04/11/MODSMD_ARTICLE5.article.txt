# STANFORD-CALIFORNIA MEET NEXT SATURDAY
## PROGRAM ARRANGED FOR INTERCOLLEGIATE CONTEST. Condition of Coleman May Prevent His Entering.— Sprinter Will Run Trial Friday. 
### 
On Saturday afternoon, tlie besl that
Stanford and the University of Califor
nia can put into the field, will clash on
the Berkeley oval in the Eighteenth
Intercollegiate Track Meet. With one
or two exceptions both teams are in
the pink of condition, and will enter
;he meet prepared to represent the best
the colleges can produce.
The slight breakdown of T. L. Cole
man, '12, while running his trial yes
terday morning has come at a most in
opportune moment. The sprints were
looked upon as the grearo.it point win
ners for the Stanford team, and the
speedy Cardinal veteran of the past
two seasons was conceded his two
first places again with little difficulty.
No new developments appear today
and Coleman's condition is being
watched with great anxiety. Whether
Coleman will enter the meet or not
will not be known until Friday. He
will run a trial at that time, and if all
goes well, he will again grace the
ranks of the Cardinal team Saturday
in his third year of Intercollegiate
competition.
Captain Rellah is well on the road
to recovery from the strain which he
received in the Intel-class meet and
will be fit for the coming contest. It
is doubtful however, that he will be
seen in more than one event.
With the exception of these two men,
the squad is at its best. The trials
run during the past week find the men
coming thru in the best of form, and
give conclusive proof that the squad
can be depended upon for consistent
performances when the crucial mom
ent arrives.
