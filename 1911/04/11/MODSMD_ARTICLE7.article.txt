# Don't Rush Off

It is greatly to be hoped that the de
sire of the Senior Class to make Senior
Week a University Week will meet

with a hearty re
sponse from the
Student Body. Too

few have remained for the final festiv
ities of past years, when as a matter of
fact they are the most enjoyable of
the whole college year, not even ex
cepting Junior Week. Everyone who
has stayed for Senior Week advises
others to do the same.
An exceptionally good program has
been announced by 1911. Altho it. is
two days shorter than previous pro
grams, it includes all the events of
former years besides several new
ones. One of these is the Underclass
man Day, which will be devoted to the
Student Body as a. whole, ending with
a second big University Jolly-up at the
Armory in the evening.
A perusal of the list of events in
another column cannot but impress
the reader with the fact that there
will be "something doing" every min
ute from the time the curtain goes up
at the Farce until the last dance is
danced at the Ball. You had better
stay and enjoy the fun. 1911 will
show you a good time.
