# SWORD AND SANDALS TO CHOOSE STRONG PLAY
## DRAMATIC SOCIETY WILL PICK PIECE SOON. Five New Members are Elected for Work in Recent Dramatic Presentations. 
### 
At the present time "Sword and
Sandals" is considering the choice of
a play to be presented early next
semester. The dramatic society is con
sidering putting on a play of a far
more serious nature next year than any
thing that has been done in the past.
Three pieces are at present under
consideration. They are "The Nigger,"
"The Easiest Way," and "His House in
Order." Altho these plays are differ
ent from anything that has been pre
sented in the past and are all of a
rather serious tone, they are decidedly
vital and are all full of fine scenes and
gripping situations.
At present the balance seems to
swing toward a choice of Sir A. W.
Pinero's "His House in Order." This
play is considered by many to be the
masterpiece of the great English play
write. It deals with a tremendously
strong central situation and offers
wonderful opportunities for the play
ers taking the leading parts. The
other two plays are well known to
theatre goers. One deals with a prob
lem of the South, as its name would in
dicate, and the other with a problem
of a woman in a great city.
No matter which play is chosen the
cast will be completed this semester
and the parts will be learned before
the opening of college next year. Re
hearsals will at once at that
time, and the play has been set for the
evening of September 29. This will
give ample time for a finished per
formance.

At the present time "Sword and
Sandals" is considering the choice of
a play to be presented early next
semester. The dramatic society is con
sidering putting on a play of a far
more serious nature next year than any
thing that has been done in the past.
Three pieces are at present under
consideration. They are "The Nigger,"
"The Easiest Way," and "His House in
Order." Altho these plays are differ
ent from anything that has been pre
sented in the past and are all of a
rather serious tone, they are decidedly
vital and are all full of fine scenes and
gripping situations.
At present the balance seems to
swing toward a choice of Sir A. W.
Pinero's "His House in Order." This
play is considered by many to be the
masterpiece of the great English play
write. It deals with a tremendously
strong central situation and offers
wonderful opportunities for the play
ers taking the leading parts. The
