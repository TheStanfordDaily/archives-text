# STUDENT BODY PRESIDENT DITZ WRITES ON FRESHMAN ELIGIBILITY
## In April Sequoia, Appearing Tomorrow, Prominent Senior Speaks on Fundamental Question. 
### 
Unless Freshmen are allowed to
compete in the Varsity Intercollegiate
contests with the Blue and Gold, ath
letic competition with California is
domed to extinction, is the attitude
taken by Student Body President G. A.
Ditz, '11, in his article on "The Neces
sity of Freshman Intercollegiate Com
petition" which will appear in the
Sequoia tomorrow.
Ditz raises no objection to the sup
pressing of Freshman Intercollegiate
activities but considers that under no
circumstances should the first year
men be barred from the Varsity teams.
If this is done the number of Cardinal
eligibles would he so small that it
would be impossible to pick a team
strong enough to meet the trans-bay
university athletes.
California will allow her Incoming
athletes to compete and this will raise
her athletic prowess far above that of
the Cardinal. This will mean the drop

ping of Intercollegiate relations with
California and the substituting of some
smaller local or southern university
as our intercollegiate rival, says
Ditz.
M. M. Fogel, '12, contributes an arti
cle on the prospects of the Track Meet.
The fiction in tomorrow's number is:
"Nonsense," bv C. E. Fleming, '13.
"The Amateur Burglar," by R. L.
Duffus, '09, "Le Theatre du Peachtree,"
by C. Green, '12, and"After the
Curtain Falls," by Miss M. C. Driscoll,
'13.
Two admirable bits of verse are the
products of the pens of E. J. Hopkins,
ex-'ll, and L. M. Robinson, '12.
Editorially, F. E. Hill speaks of
Ditz's article on freshman competition
and the track meet. "Voices from
Afar," is the title of an editorial upon
the Assemblies held this semester and
"We W 7 ant Some More," deals with the
1912 Junior Opera.
