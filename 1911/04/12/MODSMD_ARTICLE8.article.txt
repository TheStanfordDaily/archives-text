Speaking for the Executive Commit
tee of the Associated Students, Student
Body President George A. Ditz, '11,
writes an article for the April number

of the Sequoia, appear
ing tomorrow, on the
"Necessity of Freshman
Intercollegiate Competi

tion," which should be read by every
one who has Stanford's interests at
heart. Having seen advance proofs of
the article, we have no hesitation in
declaring it one of the most fundamen
tal ever written on Stanford athletic
conditions and we urge the whole Stu
dent Body to read it.
By Ditz's contribution it will he seen
that the whole matter of Freshman
games and Freshman eligibility will be
considered at the May meeting of the
Academic Council. We believe that a
consideration of the question at that
time is unfortunate, as the stress of
final examinations will prevent a full
and just presentation of the student
side of the question. This is a question
which vitally affects a Student Body
which has spent thousands of dollars
for the upbuilding of Stanford ath
letics. If Freshman are kept out of
Varsity Intercollegiate athletics, the
whole Intercollegiate system falls. If
the Academic Council takes any action,
it is of utmost importance to the stu
dents from a financial point alone.
We believe that any problem of vital
concern, especially one financial in
character, should be considered by
those thoroly conversant with that
problem. Expert opinion and decision
is necessary. Those who take but a
passive interest in it, or are not thoroly
informed as to its minutest details
should not be the final arbiters.
We believe that President Jordan
and his Committee on Athletics are
fully informed as to the athletic situa
tion. We believe that in justice to the
splendid and costly system which
Stanford students have built up here,
that hasty action should not be taken
and that such action should he taken
by men who fully understand every de
tail of the problem before them and
who as men in authority in athletic af

fairs naturally take a deep aiul ex
haustive interest in them.
All that the Student Body asks is a
full hearing, such a hearing to lie
granted when it can present its case
unhampered by final examinations, and
the hurry and flurry of the closing of
the college year.
