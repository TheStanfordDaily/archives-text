# INTERCOLLEGIATE DEBATE AT CALIFORNIA TOMORROW
## TWO TEAMS WILL CLASH IN HARMON GYM. Miller, Hilton and Person Will Represent Cardinal in Verbal Battle. 
### 
Stanford and California debaters
will meet on the platform of Harmon
Gymnasium tomorrow evening and
wage a battle royal. This phrase is
trite but amply justified by the charac
ter of the opposing teams and of the
preparations which they have made.
Each university is to be represented by
a trio which probably is the most ef
fective combination possible to obtain
from its student body.
R. Justin Miller, '11, Frank Howard
Hilton, '11, and Harry Robert Person,
'12, will speak for Stanford in this, the
seventeenth annual Intercollegiate De
bate. Their opponents will be N. H.
Drury, '12, F. M. Shipper, '12. and J. J.
Miller, '13, California would appear to
have a slight advantage in the fact that
this is the identical team which repre
sented California in last year's Inter
collegiate contest, while Stanford'.-?
cause is not upheld by any veteran of
;i regular Intercollegiate debate. A
second team Tunned at California to
hold practice debates with their first
team has also considerably aided the
Blue and Gold.
These apparent advantages, it is
hoped, will be offset by the unusually
talented character of Stanford's trio.
Miller has appeared as a Carnot debat
er twice and Hilton once, and both
have won a large share of forensic
honors in the local field during the last
two years. Person is a veteran of bis
Freshman and Sophomore Class de
bating teams. Careful and exhaustive
study has marked the preparation of
these three men for the debate.
Stanford will argue the negative of
the question, "Resolved, That the
United States should establish a cen
tral bank, waiving the constitutional
ity of the question." This topic was
presented by Stanford, and the speak
ers from across the bay were given
their choice of sides.
The men who will decide the out
come of the debate as judges are
Judge Sturtevant, Frank Symmes, and
Rabbi H. Meyer. The presiding officer
will probably be President Wheeler.
Harmon Gymnasium at Berkeley is
the place and eight o'clock tomorrow
evening the time of the debate. Ample
accommodations will be provided for
all supporters of the Cardinal who
wish to be present at the firing of the
first shot in the big "bear hunt" which
is to be brought to successful conclu
sion by the men of track and crew.
