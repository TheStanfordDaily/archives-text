# Crews Leave for Saturday's Regatta
## Varsity and Freshman Eights Ready for Intercollegiate Race.â€”Will Train Tomorrow on Estuary. 
### 
With the seventh annual Intercol
legiate Regatta less than forty-eight
hours away, twenty husky athletes,
comprising the pick of Stanford's oars
men. departed for Oakland this after
noon to put the finishing touches on
their training for the big struggle on
Saturday morning.
After three months of as strenuous
training as any Stanford athletes have
ever gout' through, the crews have
emerged in line t-hape and are ready to

row the race of their lives. The Var
sity starting in the season with con
siderable raw material, but still hav
ing plenty < 112 veterans to form a nucle
us, the Coaching Committee composed
of Captain Schaupp, Seward, and (;u
-rena, have with the great assistance of
the candidates themselves turned out
as gritty a bunch of fighters as ever

| graced a Stanford shell. This is also
I true of the Freshmen, none of whom
1 had ever had any experience in rowing
| before this year.
Result is I'ncertain
To forecast the results of Saturday's
i races is almost impossible for there
j have been no preliminary contests in
i which to get a line on the merits of
| either the Stanford or the California
I eights. In the way of veterans, the
I Cardinal is the better off, having six
oarsmen and a coxswain who have
previously earned their "S" in boat
ing. California will be represented by
five old men.
Moth strokes are veterans and al
tho this will be Captain Schaupp's first
race in that position, his work this
year places him at least on a par with
the veteran Malatesta of the Blue and
Gold. In the coxswain position, which
is perhaps the most important place in
the boat, Stanford is especially fortu
nate in having "Husky" Guerena, who
lias yet to find his equal for the posi
tion on the Coast. Kelly, the Blue and
Gold's coxswain, while not a veteran,
participated in the 1912 Freshmen
race. The Blue and Gold athletes out
weigh the Stanford crew more than
three pounds to the man but the latter
seems to be the best balanced aggrega
tion both in respect to weight and
height. If anything, it appears that
Stanford has a shade the better of the
argument on paper.
Tomorrow morning both the Fresh
men and Varsity will go over the Oak
land Estuary course to acquaint them
selves with the bends and turns, but
no attempt will be made for time.
Freshmen \ew at Game
Both Freshmen crews are composed
of inexperienced oarsmen and it ap
pears to be an even break. During the
spring vacation, the Cardinal babies
