# Crews Leave for Saturday's Regatta
## Varsity and Freshman Eights Ready for Intercollegiate Race.—Will Train Tomorrow on Estuary. 
### 
With the seventh annual Intercol
legiate Regatta less than forty-eight
hours away, twenty husky athletes,
comprising the pick of Stanford's oars
men. departed for Oakland this after
noon to put the finishing touches on
their training for the big struggle on
Saturday morning.
After three months of as strenuous
training as any Stanford athletes have
ever gout' through, the crews have
emerged in line t-hape and are ready to

row the race of their lives. The Var
sity starting in the season with con
siderable raw material, but still hav
ing plenty < 112 veterans to form a nucle
us, the Coaching Committee composed
of Captain Schaupp, Seward, and (;u
-rena, have with the great assistance of
the candidates themselves turned out
as gritty a bunch of fighters as ever

| graced a Stanford shell. This is also
I true of the Freshmen, none of whom
1 had ever had any experience in rowing
| before this year.
Result is I'ncertain
To forecast the results of Saturday's
i races is almost impossible for there
j have been no preliminary contests in
i which to get a line on the merits of
| either the Stanford or the California
I eights. In the way of veterans, the
I Cardinal is the better off, having six
oarsmen and a coxswain who have
previously earned their "S" in boat
ing. California will be represented by
five old men.
Moth strokes are veterans and al
tho this will be Captain Schaupp's first
race in that position, his work this
year places him at least on a par with
the veteran Malatesta of the Blue and
Gold. In the coxswain position, which
is perhaps the most important place in
the boat, Stanford is especially fortu
nate in having "Husky" Guerena, who
lias yet to find his equal for the posi
tion on the Coast. Kelly, the Blue and
Gold's coxswain, while not a veteran,
participated in the 1912 Freshmen
race. The Blue and Gold athletes out
weigh the Stanford crew more than
three pounds to the man but the latter
seems to be the best balanced aggrega
tion both in respect to weight and
height. If anything, it appears that
Stanford has a shade the better of the
argument on paper.
Tomorrow morning both the Fresh
men and Varsity will go over the Oak
land Estuary course to acquaint them
selves with the bends and turns, but
no attempt will be made for time.
Freshmen \ew at Game
Both Freshmen crews are composed
of inexperienced oarsmen and it ap
pears to be an even break. During the
spring vacation, the Cardinal babies


( ]tluiit K. Sehaupp, '12
improved greatly and have since given
the Varsity some close races in prac
tice.
The races coining as they do early in
the morning should find the Estuary
course calm and ready for two pretty
races unless something unforseen hap
pens. The Freshmen race will start
promptly at 9 o'clock from below the
Webster street bridge. The Varsity
contest will begin at 10. Roth races
are three miles long.
The following are men who will see
the Cardinal thru the regatta Satur
day:
Karl Ludwig Schaupp, '12, the Cap
tain of the crew, is one of Stanford's
best athletes and is the premier oars
man in the eight. Besides being cap
tain, Schaupp has also been filling the
position of coach with the aid of other
veterans and he is largely responsible
for the excellent condition the men are
in. Saturday will be his third ap
pearance in an Intercollegiate boat
race, having occupied No. 4 in last
year's Senior Eight and in the 1912
Freshmen crew. This year, the veter
an is filling the most difficult position
in the boat, that of stroke. Schaupp's
home is in Santa Rosa and he majors
iti Physiology. He is a member of Phi
Gamma Delta.
In No. 7., the Cardinal is represented
by the hardest working oarsman in the
shell in the person of Richard Henry
Seward, '12. Seward is a member of
the Coaching Committee and has rend
ered invaluable assistance in training
the crew. This will be the first race
he has rowed in this position, which is
practically that of stroke for the star
board side of the boat. Seward rowed
No. 3 on the 1910 Varsity and the 1912
Freshmen crews. He also was in the
race with the University of Washington
last spring and was substitute on the
northern trip in 1909. Los Angeles is
Seward's home and he is registered in
the Economics department. He is a
member of Delta Upsilon.
Ralph Rensselaer Gilmore who will
row No. t>, has the distinction of lieing
the heaviest man in the crew, tipping
the beam at 188. "Gil" has had a hard
time this season in getting rid of his
superfluous poundage, but he has suc
ceeded and will enter the race Satur
day in the best of condition. He is a
fighter from start to finish and has
unlimited endurance. Gilmore's posi
tion Saturday will not be new to him
for he occupied (he same place in the
Varsity race last spring and on the
1912 Freshmen eight. He also rowed
on Lake Washington last summer. Gil
more is enrolled in the Electrical
Engineering department from Fair
Oaks, and is a member of Encina Club.
No. 5 will be well taken care of by
Robert Francis Duryea. '13, of Palo
! Alto. This will be his first race against
California in Varsity eight, but he is
virtually a veteran, for he rowed
against Washington last year, was No.
3 in the victorious 1913 four and was
captain of the Sophomore Interclass
crew this year. Duryea is one of the
strongest men in the shell. He majors
! in Civil Engineering and is a member
!of Delta IJpsilon. Duryea is the tallest
man in the boat, standing 6:3.
Laurence Hofer, '13, has the No. 4,
oar. Hofer has fulfilled the promises
of last year when he proved himself
so worthy an oarsman that he was
taken out of the Freshmen boat and
placed in No. 2 in the Varsity eight,
where he pulled a strong oar in spite
of his inexperience. Resides compet
ing against California, Hofer rowed up
north against Washington and also on
this year's 1913 four. He belongs to
Sigma Chi fraternity and registers in
the department of History. His home
is in Salem, Oregon.
No. 3 will be looked after by Ray
mond Richard Hails, '12, who rowed
bow in the big race last year. Hails
has bettered his good form of last year
and is a game fighter. He also was a
member of the crew that went north
and besides was substitute for the 1912
Freshmen. Hails is a native of Santa
Barbara and is in the Economics de
partment. He is on the rolls of Phi
Delta Theta.
Carl Henry Benson, '10, at No. 2 Is
a power in the shell. He is also a
veteran, having rowed on the 1908 Var
sity and altho he has not engaged in
crew work the past two years, he has
forgotten none of the fine points of
rowing that he learned under Dan
Murphy. Benson is the only man in
the boat who does not measure 6 feet
and he lacks only a bare one-fourth
inch. Benson lives in Santa Cruz and
is a Mechanical Engineering major.
He is a member of Encina Club.
In the bow position is Roger Wolcott
Olmstead, '13, who rows with the best
form in the boat. Although the light
est man, weighing only 154y 2 , he is
very powerful in proportion to his
weight and can pull his share in any
crew. Saturday will be Olmstead's
first Varsity race, although he occu
pied the same position in the Freshman
four last spring and in this year's
Sophomore crew. Los Angeles is Olm
stead's home and Civil Engineering
his major. He is a member of Encina
Club.
The all-important place of coxswain

will be ably handled by Francis Louis
Guerena, '11. "Husky" knows the
game from beginning to end and can
lie relied upon to get every ounce of
pull out of each man. He is unques
tionably without a peer in his position.
He was a member of the coaching
committee both last year and this and
is in no small way responsible for the
quality of our crews. Guerena helped
to defeat the Blue and Gold in the
1909 race and also held the tiller in the
1911 Freshman contest. Besides he
was member of the crew on Its north
ern trip in 1909 and 1910. Guerena
expects to enter the boat Saturday
weighing about 110 pounds. He majors
in Law from Sonora and is a member
of Encina Club.
There will be two Varsity substi
tutes, Carl Hugh Beal, '13, of Palo
Alto and Augustus Mudge Sanborn, '12,
of Redlands. Both men are strong
oarsmen and in case of accident to any
of the regular men before the race
tljey could step in and give an excel
lent account of themselves. Beal cap
tained and stroked the Freshmen last
year while Sanborn rowed bow on the
1912 Freshmen eight.
None of the men in the Freshman
boat have had any experience in row
ing before this year but they have fast
mastered the essentials of the game
and are strong fighters.
Frederick W. Wickman, the Captain
elect, has shown fine form all season
and will row No. 6. Wickman regis
ters in the History department from
Honolulu and is a member of Phi Kap
pa Psi.
The Important position of stroke
will be well filled by Fred B. Watkins
of Los Angeles. Watkins is probably
the strongest oarsman in the eight and
fights all the way. He was also a
member of the Freshman rugby team
last fall.
Edwin H. Ford will coxswain the
first-year men. Ford is the smallest
man that tried out for the position this
year and he combines with his diminu
tive size ability to handle the tiller.
His weight is and he measures
5:3V£. Ford is registered in the Eng
lish department from Mazeppa, Minn.
