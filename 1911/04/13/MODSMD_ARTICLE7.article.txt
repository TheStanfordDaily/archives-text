# CHAPARRAL TRACK NUMBER DUE TOMORROW MORNING.
## Posters Unintentionally Libellous. Coming Issue Big, Bright and Breezy. 
### 
Thru a distressing typographical
error by which the two words "Not A"
were omitted from the Chaparral post
ers, the number which will appear on
the Quad tomorrow morning has been
widely heralded as "punk." It is more
correctly a Track number, and quite up
to the usual standard of the Chaparral.
The first page cartoon is entitled,
"Daughter Loved Him," and is the
work of Miss M. Hailey, '14. Stan Dix
on, ex-'l2, contributes a picture of a
girl which is said to be in the Harri
son Fisher or Gibson class. "Pete" is
represented by a series of six cartoons
illustrative of "Queenometry." Other
art work is by E. E. Manning, '13. R. H.
Hellman, '11, A. T. King, '12, and E. M.
Albright, ex-'l2.
The front page poem by W. S. Wood,
'14, differs somewhat in tone from the
usual Chaparral poem. "Those Marks,"
by Les Summerfield. '12, next year's
editor, is particularly good. F. H.
Beach, '12, is author of "The Former
Age," an excellent piece of verse. Full
directions as to "How to write a Dille
tante" should be of interest to struggl
ing authors, and the essay on "Men"
should insure a large sale of the num
ber in Roble.
After careful re-reading of his edi
torials, Editor Bliven was unable to
determine just what they were about,
but they occupy the customary two
pages of the book, which will be sold
on the Quad tomorrow at the usual
hour and price.
