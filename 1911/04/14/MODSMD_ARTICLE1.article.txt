# 1Will Battle for Athletic Supremacy
## RIVAL COLLEGE TEAMS TO MEET ON LAND AND WATER Cardinal Athletes Will Attempt to Win Laurels in Eighteenth Annual Contest on Berkeley Oval Tomorrow. 
### 
"Tills Is one of the hardest seasons
I have ever gone thru. We started with
only thirty-three points in sight and
with hard work we developed a team
that looked as tho we had a walkaway.
With Coleman out of the meet, and
Bellah not at his hest, we are left with
just about an even break. .1 think the
tight in this team will turn the trick
and will bring us a well earned vic
tory ."—"Dad" Jloulton.
"I have never seen any team work
harder than the men have this season.
They are a lighting bunch and that is
what is going to do the work on Sat
urday. In my opinion the meet will
not be won until the finish of the re
lay, and that should mean a Stanford
victory."—Captain S. 11. Bellah.
In a spirited rally held in the As
sembly Hall last, evening, the Varsity
Track Team was accorded a final send
off before encountering their Blue
and Gold rivals Saturday. Words of
encouragement from C. Coonan. '09,
Professor D. M. Folsom, '02, and J. O,
Miller, '08, together with a short re
sume of what the men had done and
were expected to do Saturday as told
by Captain S. H. Bellah, '10, and "Dad"
Moulton, gave the athletes and the
Cardinal rooters their last impressions
before the big event.
Thirty-nine .Men on Team
A team of thirty-nine men, larger by
eiglit than the delegation of last year,
now stands ready to defend the colors
of Stanford in the Intercollegiate
struggle for track supremacy over Cal
ifornia. It may be said and without
exception that never before has the
development of a Stanford team re
flected so great credit upon the Cap
tain and Trainer. Unfortunately it
cannot he said that the best of luck
has been with Stanford. It has been
an uphill fight all the way.
Stanford Has Even Break
Starting the season with the most
sanguine of the Cardinal supporters
unable to play the role of optimist,
hard, continuous work on the part of
the athletes and the trainer, has re
sulted in a well-rounded, well-balanced
Varsity. As "Dad" says,"it looked like
a walkaway with Coleman and Bellah
at their best. Now we have an even
break."
What gives us claim to an even
break? Not the first place men alone,
but the large number of second and
third point winners who have been
discovered and developed this season.
The first of the year found Stanford
apparently out of the running. The
sprints looked like the only track
events in which we had a single first
place cinched. As the situation stand?
at present, the hurdle races in which
the best of our rivals are found, are

the only events on the track in which
we have not just as good a chance to
wrest first honors from them as they
has to take the first point places from
us.
Meet Will be Close
Again it is conceded that the 1911
Intercollegiate meet will he closely
contested, and that it is very likely
that the meet will he decided hy the
relay race. An even break is all that
is asked by a Stanford team. We be
lieve that Stanford has more surprises
to spring than California h;ts up her
sleeve.
The "Dope Sheet"
The "dope sheet" is only made to
be upset. No prediction by events for
a track meet of any kind ever came
true to its prophecy in every instanec.
We can only hope that a reversal of
form in one event will be counterbal
anced by a surprise in another and the
final score will remain practically un
changed. On a conservative estimate
we look for Stanford to take the long
end of the score board, probably only
a lew points to the good. Stanford, 02,
California, 60, gives Stanford a mini
mum number of points in each of the
events. According to "Dad" we have
only four chances to fall down whereby
we may lose six points, but we have
six chances to come thru by which we
might arid eleven points.
Fast Men in Sprints
Smitherum and McKee are the
strength of the Cardinal sprinters, and
a great responsibility is placed upon
their shoulders since Coleman will
have to view the meet from the bleach
ers. A fraction under : 10.1 and pos
sibly :10 is going to be just a. little too
fast for Connelly and Woods of Cali-

A Conservative Prophecy.

fornia. Smitherum should bring home
the century. McKee has an excellent
opportunity to show in this race also
but we are only laying claim to five
sure points.
McKee and Simtherum should both
place in the furlong, with a good
chance of the little Freshman captain
crossing the line in the lead. Four
points is a conservative estimate of
our chances here.
Dawson Looks Good in Quarter
The quarter is going to be a fine
exhibition from the bleachers, at least
from one side of the bleachers—the
Stanford side. Butler of California
has a faculty of coming thru in com
petition, but Dawson with bis :. r )l flat
should travel the route in the fore
most position. Taylor is good for a
place and is looked upon as a likely
contender for second honors. He will
make the round under :52 seconds.
We have a wonderful chance to steal
a march on the Berkeley boys in th<>
half milp. Improving with every race,
Cramer and Gard will both place here,
and the veteran Dowd will have to put
the two minute mark in the back
ground if he expects to break the tape.
Both of these Stanford men have been
developed by "Dad" this season, and
are running at their best right now.
(Hood Time Expected in Mile
Lee and Moore will make a formid
able front rank combination which the
gritty Wood of California will find
hard to break up. Lee has 4:28.2 to
his credit and Moore has been timeo
:»t. 4:33. The Californian will have t<
better his time of 4:36 if he is to figure
strong in this race.
Newman, Shelton and Templeton
will be the hope of the Stanford sup
porters in the two mile run. Both
Newman and Shelton did the work last
year in this event, and will again g<
after tlie Blue and Cold thl r
.season. This scoring combination
looks good for six points and possibl'
eight.
