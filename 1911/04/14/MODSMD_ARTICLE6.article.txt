# Support the Teams
## 
### 
The Varsity Captains have promised
that the Cardinal teams will give
Stanford all that they have in the

great intercollegiate bat
tles with the Bine and
Gold tomorrow. It is
needless to say that this

promise will be kept. All that re
mains is for the Student Body to give
the teams all that it has. With such
a combination, only a natural super
iority on the part of the California
athletes will bring us a defeat. We be
lieve that we have men of sufficient
ability to bring us victory instead.
Every event should be given the heart
iest support that Stanford is capable
of.
