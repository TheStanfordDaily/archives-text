# WIN ON WATER-LOSE ON LAND
## CARDINAL CREWS VICTORIOUS IN SEVENTH ANNUAL REGATTA Varsity and Freshman Eights Win Decisively Over Blue and Gold Oarsmen in Faultless Regatta.â€”Seward Captain Elect. 
### 
For the third time in as many years
the Stanford crews demonstrated their
superiority on the water by scoring a
double victory over the Blue and Gold
eights in the annual Intercollegiate re
gatta. Both crews took the lead at the
start and were never headed, the
Freshmen winning by a good two
lengths and the Varsity crossing the
line a bare half length ahead of their
rivals in a finish that sent the specta
tors wild.
The Stanford Varsity averaging 36
strokes to the minute, covered the ap
proximately three mile course in the
remarkably fast time of 14 minutes and
5 seconds. The Blue and Gold boat
maintained a stroke of 38 and finished
with a spurt of 41 but their strokes
wereshorter than Stanford's and they
did not make as hard a catch. The
Cardinal Freshmen rowed a very
steady race hardly changing from the
stroke of 37 to the minute that they
set up at the start. Their time for the
couise was 16 minutes flat.
When the sixteen brawny athletes
and two midget coxswains in two frail
shells swept across the finish line only
half a length apart it made a wonder
ful sight and the 2000 students from
the two universities who had gathered
at the finish were amply repaid for
their appearance on the scene. The
Stanford eight rowed in the prettiest
form and altho not making as many
strokes to the minute they got more
power into their pull. California dis
carded the long body stroke that they
used in the past and used a shorter and
less effective stroke. The great differ
ence in size of the California men also
hindered them from displaying the
same smooth rythmic motion that the
Stanford eight showed.
Neither Freshman eight rowed in as
fine form as the big eights, but that
was not to be expected from inexper
ienced men. The California first-year
men rowed very raggedly the first two
miles but settled down to better form
at the finish. Several of their men had
a tendency to "row out of the boat."
Stanford's Freshmen, while not dis
playing the form that the Varsity did.
showed the results of hard work under
the coaching committee and were a
much better machine than their rivals.
They had worked hard all season and
proved it.
The Stanford eights both showed a
greater knowledge of the rowing game
than did their rivals. They took the
lead at the crack of the pistol, and thus
forced California to fight the whole
distance.
By virtue of Saturday's victory, Stan

Conditions were perfect for the race

Saturday, the Estuary was as smooth
as glass and the tide favored neither
boat. Roth races were started on time,
the Freshmen leaving the start at !>: Ir>

Start
Stanford had the right hand side of
the course. She caught the water first
and set up a stroke of 40 to the min
ute. California started at 39 and be
fore the Webster street bridge was
reached, Stanford was a length ahead.
Up to this point both crews were row
ing with short and fast strokes but on
assuming the lead the Cardinal eight
settled down to a longer and slower
pull.
One Mile.
Rowing steadily at 3f> to the minute
with long strokes and a hard catch,
the Stanford eight increased its lead
to almost two lengths at the end of the
first mile. California was rowing at 38
but their high catch lessened their
pull.
Two Miles.
Both crews had lowered their stroke
during the second mile, Stanford to 35
and California to 36, and Stanford's
lead was now over two lengths. The
Cardinal eight was rowing with macli
ine-like precision, but some of the
California men "washed out" fre
quently. At this point the race ap
peared to he easy for Stanford.
Finish.
On rounding the bend at the end of
the second mile, California increased
her stroke to 38 and began to pick up,
Stanford at he same time increased to
36. At two and a half, Stanford led by
a length and half, but in the last
quarter of the race, California showed
an unexpected spurt and picked it up
to 41. California was rapidly pulling
up, but Stanford increased to 37 and
crossed the line with a half length in
the lead. After posing for a picture
both eights rowed back to the Amador,
the California boat house. Time of

THE FRESHMAN RACE.
Start.
The Stanford eight on the left side
of the course, got a better start than
their rivals and set up a stroke of 37.
California began with 38 to the minute
but took shorter strokes than the Stan
ford men who rowed with prettier
form. As they went under the Web
ster street bridge the Cardinal fresh
men led by half a length.
One Mile.
Neither crew showed exceptional
form but Stanford was better in this
respect. Several of the California
men were "rowing out." The stroke
was the same as at the start, but the
longer Cardinal pull had increased the
distance betwen them to a length and
a half.
Two Miles.
California had lowered to 36, but
Stanford maintained 37 and led by
nearly three lengths at this point. The
Blue and Gold freshmen wasted on
their catch.
Finish.
The California eight settled down
and rowed in better form the last mile.
They gained on the Stanford crew, but
the latter still maintaining 37 finished
two lengths in the lead. California's
coxswain lost about half a length in
turning to go under the bridge at
the finish. Time of race, same course
as Varsity, 16 minutes flat; average
stroke, Stanford 37. California 37.

a length and half, but in the last
quarter of the race, California showed
an unexpected spurt and picked it up
to 41. California was rapidly pulling
up, but Stanford increased to 37 and
crossed the line with a half length in
the lead. After posing for a picture
both eights rowed back to the Amador,
the California boat house. Time of

point of stroke, Stanford 40, California

THE FRESHMAN RACE.
Start.
The Stanford eight on the left side
of the course, got a better start than
their rivals and set up a stroke of 37.
California began with 38 to the minute
but took shorter strokes than the Stan
ford men who rowed with prettier
form. As they went under the Web
ster street bridge the Cardinal fresh
men led by half a length.
One Mile.
Neither crew showed exceptional
form but Stanford was better in this
respect. Several of the California
men were "rowing out." The stroke
was the same as at the start, but the
longer Cardinal pull had increased the
distance betwen them to a length and
a half.
Two Miles.
California had lowered to 36, but
Stanford maintained 37 and led by
nearly three lengths at this point. The
Blue and Gold freshmen wasted on
their catch.
Finish.
The California eight settled down
and rowed in better form the last mile.
They gained on the Stanford crew, but
the latter still maintaining 37 finished
two lengths in the lead. California's
coxswain lost about half a length in
turning to go under the bridge at
the finish. Time of race, same course
as Varsity, 16 minutes flat; average
stroke, Stanford 37. California 37.
For the third time in as many years
the Stanford crews demonstrated their
superiority on the water by scoring a
double victory over the Blue and Gold
eights in the annual Intercollegiate re
gatta. Both crews took the lead at the
start and were never headed, the
Freshmen winning by a good two
lengths and the Varsity crossing the
line a bare half length ahead of their
rivals in a finish that sent the specta
tors wild.
The Stanford Varsity averaging 36
strokes to the minute, covered the ap
proximately three mile course in the
remarkably fast time of 14 minutes and
5 seconds. The Blue and Gold boat
maintained a stroke of 38 and finished
with a spurt of 41 but their strokes
wereshorter than Stanford's and they
did not make as hard a catch. The
Cardinal Freshmen rowed a very
steady race hardly changing from the
stroke of 37 to the minute that they
set up at the start. Their time for the
couise was 16 minutes flat.
When the sixteen brawny athletes
and two midget coxswains in two frail
shells swept across the finish line only
half a length apart it made a wonder
ful sight and the 2000 students from
the two universities who had gathered
at the finish were amply repaid for
their appearance on the scene. The
Stanford eight rowed in the prettiest
form and altho not making as many
strokes to the minute they got more
power into their pull. California dis
carded the long body stroke that they
used in the past and used a shorter and
less effective stroke. The great differ
ence in size of the California men also
hindered them from displaying the
same smooth rythmic motion that the
Stanford eight showed.
Neither Freshman eight rowed in as
fine form as the big eights, but that
was not to be expected from inexper
ienced men. The California first-year
men rowed very raggedly the first two
miles but settled down to better form
at the finish. Several of their men had
a tendency to "row out of the boat."
Stanford's Freshmen, while not dis
playing the form that the Varsity did.
showed the results of hard work under
the coaching committee and were a
much better machine than their rivals.
They had worked hard all season and
proved it.
The Stanford eights both showed a
greater knowledge of the rowing game
than did their rivals. They took the
lead at the crack of the pistol, and thus
forced California to fight the whole
distance.
By virtue of Saturday's victory, Stan
ford becomes the holder for one year
of the handsome silver perpetual chal
lenge trophy presented by Sam I.
Schwabacher, '07. of San Francisco.

Saturday, the Estuary was as smooth
as glass and the tide favored neither
boat. Roth races were started on time,

THE VARSITY If ACE.
Start
Stanford had the right hand side of
the course. She caught the water first
and set up a stroke of 40 to the min
ute. California started at 39 and be
fore the Webster street bridge was
reached, Stanford was a length ahead.
Up to this point both crews were row
ing with short and fast strokes but on
assuming the lead the Cardinal eight
settled down to a longer and slower
pull.
One Mile.
Rowing steadily at 3f> to the minute
with long strokes and a hard catch,
the Stanford eight increased its lead
to almost two lengths at the end of the
first mile. California was rowing at 38
but their high catch lessened their
pull.
Two Miles.
Both crews had lowered their stroke
during the second mile, Stanford to 35
and California to 36, and Stanford's
lead was now over two lengths. The
Cardinal eight was rowing with macli
ine-like precision, but some of the
California men "washed out" fre
quently. At this point the race ap
peared to he easy for Stanford.
Finish.
On rounding the bend at the end of
the second mile, California increased
her stroke to 38 and began to pick up,
Stanford at he same time increased to
36. At two and a half, Stanford led by
a length and half, but in the last

an unexpected spurt and picked it up
