# CALIFORNIA WINS DEBATE
## STANFORD LOSES DECISION AFTER CLOSE CONTEST. Miller, Hilton, and Person Represent Cardinal by Arguing Against. Central Bank. 
### 
California won more laurels for her
wreath when she was awarded the de
cision in the Intercollegiate debate,
Friday evening, after a contest so
close that the result came as a sur
prise even to many supporters of the
Blue and Gold. Six picked debaters,
backed by a thoro knowledge of their
subject, ably argued the question,
"Resolved, That the United States
should establish a Central Bank, waiv
ing the constitutionality of the ques
tion."
Stanford supported the negative and
was represented by R. J. Miller, '11,
F. H. Hilton, *11, and H. R. Person, '12.
These men were chosen at a tryout
held March 21 from a field which in
cluded many of the strongest debaters
in college. T. L. Smith, '14, was elect
ed to be alternate at that time.
California's debaters were N. B.
Drury, '12, F. M. Shipper, *12, and J.
J. Miller, '13, the same men who rep
resented their college in the 1910 in
tercollegiate debate.
J. J. Miller opened the debate with
a memorized introductory speech in
which he clearly outlined the financial
history of the United States and pres
ent conditions existing in the banking
world.
F. H. Hilton for Stanford then ar
gued that a Central Bank would be
entirely impracticable in the United
States. Our size and the nature of our
industries would prevent the success
ful application of such a plan, accord
ing to Hilton, and other remedies for
our financial ills would be far more
certain of results.
N. B. Drury continued for the affirm
ative by following up the general ar
gument in favor of a central form of
financial organization.
H. R. Person, for the negative, re
futed these arguments and argued con
vincingly that the Central Bank would
not be an efficient fiscal agent, and
would, moreover, become an issue in
politics and exert a most dangerous
pressure in political affairs.
Not until this point did California
definitely advance and argue the
scheme which they favored. F. M.
Shipper outlined what is known as the
Aldrich Plan for a Central Bank, and
pointed out the merits of the system.
R. J. Miller in presenting Stanford's
case for the last time ably exposed the
fallacies of the Aldrich Plan, quoting
several personal interviews to sub
stantiate his claims.
