University of California Stan
ford 34'/$. Scoring a decisive victory
over the wearers of the Cardinal, es
tablishing seven new records and ty
ing one other will long be remembered
by the supporters of the Blue and Gold
as the result of one of the brightest
days in the athletic history of that in
stitution. No team ever came thru
like the Californian's did Saturday and
probably no tracK. team in America to
day could have counterbalanced their
wonderful performances.
The "dope sheet" wasn't worth the
paper it was written on after the first
event. Surprises on both teams
coupled with reversals came in practi
cally every event.
Beeson of California was easily the
star of the day. His performances of
:25 flat in the low hurdles. :15.4 in the
high hurdles and 6 feet 3 Inches in the
high jump stamps him as a wonder on
the track. Two of these figures es
tablished new records, while his time
in high hurdles ties the previous Inter
collegiate record.
The crowd, which filled the bleachers
and every inch of standing room, re
mained until Beeson had taken his last
jump in the fight against Horine for
first honors in the high jump. Both
men cleared the bar at 6 feet 3 inches
handily, but neither could gather the
spring to get over the bar at 6 feet 4'4
inches.
McKee. with six points chalked to his
credit, was the highest of the Stanford
point winners. He started the day by
taking third in the century, and fin
ished by annexing five points in the
furlong. He ran beautiful races, but
was held down to :23 flat in latter
not being familiar with the curved
track in this didstance.
The quarter was a surprise to every
body, when Dawson and Butler failed
to place. Both men went out to hold
the premier position going around, and
each was resolved not to let the other
pass him. The result was that after
fighting nearly all the way for the pole,
neither had a finish. It was a wonder
ful race. Taylor and eLaman had been
drawn out to their best and passed all
competitors on the home stretch, cross
ing the line side by side.
Mile Uiin.
The first severe shock came over the

Stanford bleachers, when California
walked away with nine points in the
mile. Lee started the race by taking
the pole but the end of the first lap
found him holding his side and writh
ing in pain. He was forced to drop
out in the second. Wood had assumed
the lead with Moore close on his heels.
The remaining hopes of the Stauford
ites were crushed in the fourth lap
when Moore became the victim of a
cramp and was out of the running.
Wood ran a wonderful race finishing
about fifty yards to the good and es
tablishing a new record at 4:31.
100-I'ard Dash.
Woods, the speedy Californian, suc
ceeded in nosing out Smitherum in this
event in:10.1. Smitherum fought the
race all the way, but was unable to
close up on the lead which Woods
gained at the start. McKee slipped
into the third position less than a yard
behind his teammate.
120-Yard Hurdles.
California, with her phenomenal
hurdling quartet, wiped the boards
clean. Beeson won the event, tying
the record of :15.4, followed closely by
Maclise and Captain Donald. Smith
of Stanford ran a good race, but was
outclassed by the Blue and Gold vet
erans.
440-Yard I)ush.
The quarter was a sight to behold.
Altho Taylor and Leaman ran bet
ter than at any time previous and
broke the tape together, great credit is
due to Dawson for running the much
touted Butler off his feet and keeping
his name off the list of point winners.
Dawson and Butler were both out
for first place, and killed each other off
in a 300-yard fight for the pole. Daw
son held the inside track until turn
ing into the home stretch. Here But
ler gained a slight advantage, but both
he and Dawson were passed in turn
by Taylor, Leaman and Vitousek. Al
tho the time was:51.2, the race was
the most spectacular on the program.
Two Mile Kim.
All credit is due to California's
Freshman Crabbe for running a speedy
strong race over the long distance
course and setting a new figure at
9:59. It was too fast for the Stanford
distance men, Shelton exhausting him
self in trying to hold the lead during
the first eight laps. Wood, the winner
of the mile, showed remarkable staying
power by coining into this event and
finishing a good second. Rathbone
took the third position with Bevier
finishing fourth.
220-Yard Hurdles.
Beeson of California, lowered the
record in this race to : 2T» flat, and was
followed over the line by Maclise and
Emerson. Kern looked good for a
place, but lost bis stride before en
countering the last hurdle and
measured his length on the track.
220-Yard Dash.
Running strong over the furlong,
McKee beat the Californians over the
distance on the curved track. Had the
race been run on a straightaway, the
time would undoubtedly have been
better, but the curves were new to the
Cardinal sprinter. McKee was pressed
by Woods of California, but his lead
was never in any great danger.
880-Yard Rim.
Cramer pressed Dowd to an Inter
collegiate record at 1:58.1 in the half,
coming up with a burst of speed at the
finish and almost making the event a
tie. It was a wonderful race and was
fast enough to take J. O. Miller's name
off the list of record holders by a mar
gin of.one-fifth of a second. Cramer's
time was probably inside the old
figure also.
Relay.
Calkins turned the relay into a Cali
fornia victory in the last lap. Wallace
started the race about one yard ahead
of Rathbone. Leaman and Meyer
fought the second lap to an even
break; Dawson left Vitousek about
two yards behind him at the end of the
third. Taylor led out in the last lap
with Calkins following down the back
stretch. The Californian assumed the
lead and the two men fought from that
time until the finish. Calkins ran the
stronger race and managed to make
the victory clean cut with a lead of
three yards as he broke the tape.
Field Events.
Three out of the five records were
badly shattered in the field events.
The hammer throw brought out a new
record breaker in Shattuck of Califor
nia, who sent the missle thru the air
for a distance of 157 feet ">/• inches,
while neither Rice nor Woolley could
score a point. Third place in ibis
event went at over 145 feet, a distance
at which the event was expected to be
won.
By far the calssiest exhibition of the
day was the high jump,in which Horine
and Heeson fought it out and ended
by sharing the honors for setting the
new mark at f> feet 3 inches. Both
failed to clear the bar when raised to
fi feet 4J4 inches.
Morrison of Stanford led off in the
broad with a jump of 22 feet 10 inches,
but Allen seized with the record break
ing mania, like others on the California
team, made a leap of 23 feet 3 inches.
Rice, as was expected, walked away
with the shot put at 45 feet /> inch,
with Hale, another wearer of the Blue
and Gold, taking second. Woolley
managed to break in for one point in
a field of phenomenal weight heavers..
Miller was the man of the hour in
the pole vault when Captain Bellah
was forced to withdraw from the com
petition. He easily annexed his first
place at 11 feet 8 inches, while Waring
and Stevens tied with four Californians
for the second position.
