Any disappointment in the stinging
defeat which Stanford suffered in
Track Saturday is to a considerable
degree alleviated by the glorious
triumps of our Varsity and Freshman
crews over the Blue and Gold oars
men. The exhibition of the Stanford
crews was in itself the finest tribute
which can be paid to the long monoto
nous weeks and months of continuous
and "consistent training which the
whole squad has gone thru. The ex
hibition of both the Cardinal and the
Blue and Gold eights was a fine tribute
to the status of rowing as a sport on
the Pacific Coast. We were glad to
see such an even, close contest.
In track, the Stanford team which
has worked against great odds all
season was pitted against undoubtedly
the best college track team in America.
Stanford was clearly outclassed. The
sting of defeat however, does not les
sen our respect for the Stanford team
which fought a Stanford fight. Our
defeat only means redoubled effort
next year and a general retrenchment
all along the line. Despite our smaller
student body and our higher scholar
ship requirements we believe we can
win.
