### 
An injustice was done the merchants
of Palo Alto in the article regarding
1912 Quad advertisers which appeared
in the Daily Palo Alto April 6. The
article purported to contain the names
of 1912 Quad advertisers.
Some of the Palo Alto firms listed
therein had not contracted for space,
while others which have consistently
supported the Quad in the past had
been given no opportunity to do so.
The list printed at that time should be
disregarded.
