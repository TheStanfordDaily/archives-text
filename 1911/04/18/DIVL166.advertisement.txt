CIGARETTES
Of all plants that grow,
tobacco gives the greatest
pleasure to man
Fatimas are made of rare
tobaccos skillfully blended
to give a "different" taste,
as delicate as a flavor.
College men say they're
a "Daisy"' cigarette—and
college men know.
The package is not pre
tentious but the cigarette u
excellent and you get ten
additional, 20 for I 5 cents.
