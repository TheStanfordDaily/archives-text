## WILL PLAY ON TURF DIAMOND AT 3 O'CLOCK. Nipponese Players Will Open American Tour at Stanford as Varsity's Opponents. 
### 
Waseda's premier baseball expon
ents will engage with the Varsity on
the turf diamond tomorrow afternoon
at o'clock. This will be the Japanese
collegians first regular game in Amer-

ica. Their pra cti c e
game of yesterday with
their alumni in San
| Francisco proved to be
I t walkaway, for they
rolled up an 18-0 score.
Tomorrow's contest
will be the first in
which this group of
players have met an

American team, but all reports show
them to he familiar with all of the fine
points of the game and to have made
a big improvement in their work since
their forerunners tried conclusions
with the visiting Wisconsins.
Professor Abe, the father of baseball
in Japan and Director of Athletics at
Waseda, is travelling with the team.
It was he who introduced the American
game to the Island Empire nine years
ago and since that time he has built up
a strong Waseda Varsity.
Tomorrow will deteunine in a great
measure, just what is the standing of
the .Japanese players. As it is, they
represent the strongest players that
the Far East collegians have to put
into the field.
Matsuda, the visitors' Captain, will
take the Waseda mound. He is the
strongest of the tourers' twirlers and
is reputed to have a good assortment
of strike bringing curves.
The Cardinal will pit her strongest
players against the visitors and they
should prove the victors of tomorrow's
contest. Gilfillan and Ganong will
manipulate as the local battery. The
only new name on the Stanford line up
is Peters, who takes Cass' position at
the keystone.
