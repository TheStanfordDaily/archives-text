The fact that this year's Combined
Musical Clubs are the first to be
granted permission to take a trip from
the campus in some
The Eastern years, speaks well of
Trip what these organiza
tions have accomplished
this semester and of the regard and
confidence in which they are held.
The permission lately granted is only a
just reward for the work the clubs
have done and a recognition of their
efficiency. We are sure that Stanford
will profit as much by the excursion
as the musicians themselves. A trip
properly conducted means much to the
University.
It is only to be hoped that more will
avail themselves of hearing good music
than have on the campus. The support
given the recent concert was discour
aging to say the least.
