# MUSICAL CLUBS WILL TAKE EASTERN TOUR THIS SUMMER
## Granted Permission to Accept Offer of Santa Fe. This Is the First Excursion from Campus Since 1907. 
### 
Permission has been granted the
members of the Mandolin and Glee
Clubs to accept the trip to Chicago of
fered them by the Sanla Fe Railroad.
The necessary consent was given by
the Student Affairs Committee at its
last meeting.
The clubs will leave San Francisco
soon after the conclusion of the final
examinations in charge of a Santa Fe
official for a trip of two weeks over the
northern or southern route of that
railroad. About thirty-seven men will
compose the party which will travel in
a special Pullman car. All expenses
will be paid by the Santa Fe, including
both the trip east and the return
journey. The clubs will give about
twelve concerts in the Harvey reading
rooms along the route for the benefit
of the railroad employees.
This is the first trip of any length the
clubs have been able to take for three
years. The last trip was in the winter
of 1907 when the musicians travelled
north as far as Vancouver.
The excursion comes as a reward
for the good work that has been ac
complished during the last year. The

high grade of music the Mandolin and
Glee men are capable of producing was
evidenced at the Interscholastic con
cert when they rendered a difficult pro
gram in excellent style. Roth organ
izations have appeared before the
campus public several times during the
present college year.
A very attractive program has been
arranged for the trip and altho the
principal features are made up of
many selections of the more classical
variety, the clubs are prepared to give
popular medleys for encores and thus
vary the nature of their repertoire.
The personnel of the men who will
make the trip will be announced later.
The members will be allowed to stay
in the east as long as they wish and
upon their return to Chicago will find
transportation and expense money
awaiting them for the return trip to
San Francisco.
A stunt man is needed to add to the
personnel of the party. Tryouts will
be announced later when any man in
the University may show his talent. A
good live man is wanted as the stunts
will be featured on the program.
