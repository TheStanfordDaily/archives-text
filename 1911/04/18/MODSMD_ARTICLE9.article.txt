evening by a score of (! to 1 and there

by the Blue and Gold men, while the
other two resulted in draws.
The contest started at 7:30 in Stilus
Hall when the players were paired off
by lot. For the first two or three
hours the contestants struggled for
openings, and then the California men
gradually secured advantages that
finally resulted in a Blue and Gold vic
tory.
The closest contests were those be
tween Captain A. S. Otis, '10, of Stan
ford and N. S. Mickle, '12, of California,
and H. A. Hackett, '13, of Stanford
against C. F. Woods '13, of California.
The results of the remainder of t
contests were as follows: J. de Frc
men, 11, (C) defeated 11. L. Vaughn,
12, (S); E. 11. Trout, '13 (C) defeated
L. G. Smallpage, '09, (S); S. C. Hait,

of the contest was the use of the time

tryout on this occasion. They proved
highly satisfactory.
