# VARSITY OVERWHELMS JAPANESE BALL PLAYERS
## NIPPONESE LOSE BY SCORE OF 11 TO 2. Wasedans Prove Clever Players With Fine Sense of Good Sportsmanship. 
### 
Waseda Varsity nine of Japan went
down to defeat gamely at the hands of
the Stanford team this afternoon on
the turf field, 11-2.
The Japanese proved their reputa
tion for sportsmanlike playing and
were satisfied with all decisions on the
field. They are a nine of small men
and they have to work for everything
they get. Their native smallness
handicaps them in their playing, but
what they lose in size is made up in
quickness, and in their taking advant
age of every opening offered by the
opposing nine. In this they are the
equal of the Americans, and with a
good pitcher today the story might
have been different. For infielding
the little Brown men were guilty of
but one error, but the fourteen hits
scored by the Cardinals placed them
out of the running. Omura, the
mound man, had no speed, and had to
depend on what curves he could find in
bis repertoire to do the work against
the Stanford team.
The Japanese are poor throwers,
and the Cardinal players stole bases
freely, and took extra sacks on hits
with little trouble. In their play, how
ever, there is little difference be
tween the men of the two nations.
Having played the diamond game but
eight years is a handicap, since good
throwing developes from long experi
ence. In batting, they have the same
form as the Americans, but they sel
dom clout out long ones. A two
sacker was the best of the five bingles
they marked up today.
Gilflllan pitched a strong game, and
he only weakened in the last three
innings, when four hits in two frames
gave the scores.
Over half of the spectators present
were fellow countrymen of the Waseda
men.
