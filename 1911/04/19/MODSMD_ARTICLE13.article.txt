# PROFESSOR HARSHE HANGS PAINTINGS IN BOOKSTORE.
## Santa Barbara Mission Scenes in Series of Three Splendidly Portrayed by Art Instructor. 
### 
Three rather remarkable paintings,
the work of Professor R. 13. Ilarshe of
the Department of Graphic Art, were
today hung over the west entrance of
the Bookstore. The subjects protrayed
by Professor Harshe are chosen from
scenes about the Santa Barbara Mis
sion.
One is the Sacred Garden, which is
kept rigidly closed to the outside
world, particularly to women. It was
only thru special dispensation that the
artist gained admission in order to
paint it. The other scenes are the
front of the Mission and the right Mis
sion tower seen from the left tower.
Particularly notable are the panel
decorations, which portray California
trees, the Redwood, Monterey Pine,
Monterey Cypress, and Eucalyptus,
have been fittingly chosen to decorate
this typically Californian series of
paintings.
It is perhaps from a technical stand
point that the work is of greatest sig
nificance. It is thot to be the only ex
ample in this country of work execut
ed in a combination of pempera and
oil. This method is a revival of one
used largely in Mediaeval times.
Aside from the particular interest of
the paintings locally, since the Stan
ford architecture is partly derived
from the mission type, they are of
great merit in themselves. They are
splendidly executed and seem to have
the real California atmosphere, altho
necessarily painted in a brilliant key
because of the trying lighting condi
tions in the Bookstore.
