McKee, 14, and F. .1. Card, '14.
Alderman and Campbell will make
their initial appearance in Intercol
legiate competition as representatives
of the Cardinal. Alderman comes
from lowa college and will try Satur
day to live up to his past reputation
as a weight heaver. At the Western
Conference last year, he easily out
classed all comers in the discuss-throw
and annexed another point by taking
third place in the hammer-throw. He
has made several throws of 150 feet
this year in the latter event.
Campbell is undoubtedly the best all
around track athlete in college at the
present time, having proven his re
markable versatility by making the
highest score ever registered here in
the out-door athletic test. He will be
sr-en in the hurdle rices in the coming
meet besides being entered in the
century and quarter.
Of the Varsity squad, Smitherum and
McKee will again try their ability in
the sprints. Taylor and Leaman, win
ners of the quarter mile last Saturday,
will be entered with Campbell against
the best of the quarter men on the
Coast.
Cramer will have another oppor
tunity to go the half mile route against
California's veteran Dowd, and will be
backed by Card in this event. No
Stanford men will be on the program
in the long distance races.
Horine and Morrison will wear the
Cardinal in the high and broad jumps
respectively, while Miller will be the
lone representative in the pole vault.
All three men came thru in fine style
in the California meet, and should be
sure point cvinners.
In the weights, Woolley and Alder
man should make their presence
felt. Woolley had an off day last Sat
urday, but his previous consistency
puts his name among the best of the
hammer throwers that will be entered.
A four-man relay is to be chosen
from among the twelve men already
named.
