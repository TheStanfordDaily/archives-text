# Eat in "Paly"
## 
### 
The La Liana cafeteria luncheon
planned for Saturday is to lie held for
a worthy purpose. Every meal pur
chased will make the Women's Club

House just so much
more a surety. The
clubhouse if built, will

mean as much to the women of the
University as the Union will to the
men, and the sooner we can lay the
cornerstone of either, the better for
Stanford.
As the trite adage goes concerning
oaks and acorns, we can say with
equal truth, that from well attended
country bazaars and cafeteria lunch
eons will grow our greatest institu
tions. The men as well as the women
not only can be helping a good cause
by a change in their diet Saturday, but
should thoroly enjoy the experience.
The La Liana chefs promise a menu
which will be a distinct relief from our
accustomed bill-of-fare.
