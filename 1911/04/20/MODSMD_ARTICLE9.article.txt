The bullet-ridden, blood-stained flags
under which our gallant soldiers have
fought and bled and died have usually

been retired from active ser
vice at the conclusion of a war.
A view of these battle-scarred

emblems can only be secured at G. A.
R. posts or Memorial Day parades.
Stanford, however, is unusually priv
ileged. Flapping weakly and dis
jointedly from its lofty position on the
University flagpole, the grizzled and
dismantled ensign of many a bloody
campaign may daily be gazed upon by
admiring campus patriots. What an
inspiring sight! How we are moved
as we view with pride this symbol of
all that is good and best, in American
life, which having braved the storm of
shot and shell and sabre thrust refuses
now to rest upon its well earned
laurels, but persists in remaining in
the harness in the defense of American
liberty.
The Daily Palo Alto profoundly
admires the spirit of this old eleven
striped warhorse, despite its inadequate
red and white representation of the
original thirteen colonies. Nevertheless
we plead for humanitarian treatment.
Gently but firmly the news should be
broken to the aged hero that its days
of usefulness are o'er and that it has
fought its last fight. Tenderly then
it should be borne to the Museum,
there to spend its last days in peace
and quite at half pay.
