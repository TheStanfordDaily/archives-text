# SENIOR BALL WILL BE HELD AT HOTEL VENDOME
## COMMITTEE PLANS SPLENDID FESTIVITY. Tickets for Annual Affair to Go On Sale in About Ten Days. 
### 
Hotel Vendome Ball Room, the scene
of so many social affairs, will witness
one of the gayest scenes on the even-

ing of May 22. At
this time the Class
of 1911 will bring
its four year exis
tence to a clo3e
and the festivitie:
of Senior Week to a
climax, in the an
nual Senior Ball.
The Hotel Ven
dome was the scene
of the 1910 Ball, and
so successful was
that, that those who

attended, urged the committee to se
lect it for this year. The beauty of
the room, the excellence of the floor,
and the promised hearty cooperation
of the management, make the choice
of the Vendome a particularly happy
one. The floor will accommodate 150
couples without the slightest crowd
ing, while palm-fringed verandas and
encircling promenades will offer en
ticements for promenades and tete-a
tetes.
Elaborate Supper Claimed
It is upon the supper that the Com
mittee, of which F. L. Guerena is
chairman, has concentrated much of
its thought and preparation. The
problem of new and unique decora
tions and favors has been grappled
with, and as a result something quite
out of the ordinary has been evolved.
The committeemen refuse to disclose
its exact nature, however, preferring
as a slight reward for their labors to
listen to the cries of pleasure from
the surprised dancers. The charm of
the supper will be heightened by its
service in the commodious and beauti
ful Vendome dining room.
Owing to its popularity, the Campus
Orchestra has been secured to furnish
the music.
The programs have been worked
upon by the Committee for some time,
and a most unique design has finally
been arranged. They will show eigh
teen straight dances and no extras,
and this is positively all that will be
allowed.
Transportation With Tickets
In the matter of transportation,
careful arrangements have been made,
and the Peninsula Railway Company
guarantees ample accommodations for
all. Round-trip transportation is in
cluded in the price of the dance tick
ets, which as in previous years, will
be fixed at $0. These tickets will be
placed on sale on the Quad in about
