Six canvases by Arthur Mathews of
San Francisco will be on exhibition

Two paintings in the present ex

"The Three Fates," and"The Conver
sation." The latter is particularly
daring in its color scheme of orange
and blue. Of the four landscapes,
"Hills of California," and "Marine"
are especially fine.
The exhibit is free, and will com
mence tomorrow when it may be seen
from 9 until 12 and from 2 till 5.
Next week it will be open only in the
mornings, from 8:15 to 12:15 daily.
