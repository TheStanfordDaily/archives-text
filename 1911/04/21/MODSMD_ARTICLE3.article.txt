# SENIORS WILL INAUGURATE ROUSING STANFORD CARNIVAL
## Novel Commencement Week Entertainment for Undergraduates.—Free Dances, Big Shows, Big Time. 
### 
Stanford Farm is to have a carnival.
Anyone who wanders up Lasuen on

Thursday evening,
the eighteenth of
May, will discover
an affair in pro
gress that will
make a Portola
Festival, a New
Orleans M a r d i-
Gras, or a Los
Angeles Fiesta re
semble a church
social.
Instead of the
four thrifty lan-

terns of the Business Office, the Row
will be brilliantly illuminated from
end to end. Barkers in front of the big
tents here and there will announce the
attractions of wild and weird shows in
side. The crowds they endeavor to
hypnotize will be clothed in the most
outlandish costumes that are imagin
able. Strains of music from the Delta
Kappa Epsilon, the Beta Theta Pi. the
Kappa Sigma and the Kappa Alpha
houses will announce free dancing in
all.
Everybody to Dress Foolish
It is all to be a part of the big
scheme of this year's Senior Class to
make Commencement Week what it
should be, an affair that all the Stan
ford Student Body will want to re

main and witness. Examinations close
on Wednesday and on that evening
the Senior Class presents the farce,
"The Amazons," in the Assembly Hall.
Next morning a big "Pee-rade" will be
held. In the afternoon, the Senior-
Faculty baseball games comes off, and
at 7::30 in the evening, the big car
nival commences. All the Classes,
and the various fraternities and sor
orities are to be asked to enter shows
after the manner of the old Senior
Circuses and prizes will be offered for
the best. Everyone is asked to come
In foolish costumes, and if he is
dignified, to forget it. All queening
must be strictly unpremeditated and it
wih go hard indeed with any Senior
who endeavors to monopolize his
Commencement Week partner that
evening.
Everything Will l»o Free
At least the four houses mentioned
will be open for dancing, and more
will be thrown open if the crowd de
mands. It is not to be a money-mak
ing affair In the least, and five and
ten cent admission to some of the
shows to cover the necessary expen
ses will be the only charge.
E. C. Matthias, '11, is chairman of
the committee which has the affair in
hand, and Miss Mildred Hayes, '11, is
to look after the entries for the shows
from the sororities.
