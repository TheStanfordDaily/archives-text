twelve men each,
and a merry strug
gle is loked for
ward to in the at-

tempt to carry away first honors.
Gish, the Washington star, who
walked away with seventeen points
last year, is again entered. He will he
seen in five events, the century, quar
ter, broad jump, hammer throw and
javelin throw. Besides these he will
probably be entrusted with a lap in the
relay, and is looked upon again as
the most- likely high point winner.
Half Will ho Close
The half mile will be a three-cor
nered scrap between a fighting trio.
Stoll, of Washington, who ran strong
in this event last year, will appose
Dowd of California and Cramer in
a race which may result in another
lowering of the Coast record.
Horine and Beeson will be in a class
by themselves in the high jump and
will have a chance to jump off the tie
which was the result of last Satur
day's meet.
The Summary of times and distan
ces for the entire meet give promise
of comparing most favorably with any
of the meets in the country. The en
