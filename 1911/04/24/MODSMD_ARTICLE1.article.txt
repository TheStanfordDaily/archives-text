Nine out of fifteen records went
glimmering in the Conference meet of
last Saturday, four of the new figures
being set by the wearers of the Car
dinal. The day was one of those
which are conduslve to wonderful i>er
formances and the contestants made
the best of their opportunities.
Stanford took the second place with
California in the lead, but it is a fact
worthy of note that the team broke
even with their rivals in the record
breaking honors and succeeded in
placing in every event in which they
entered.
Smitherum and Campbell finished
in the first positions in the century
setting a new record of :10.1. McKee
took the furlong easily, and put the
record down in that race to :23 flat.
Horine and Beeson renewed their
fight in the high jump, but neither
was able to show any advantage over
the other. The jump resulted in a tie
at 6 feet 2 inches which gives the two
men a place on the Conference record
sheet at this height.
Stanford was also a record breaker
in the relay. Washington gained a
lead of about 20 yards in the first lap.
Leaman, Wallace and Taylor gradual
ly closed in on this in the next three,
and when Campbell set out in the
last, round, he had a lead of about two
yards over Gish. Campbell held his
own and in fact slightly increased
the gap before crossing the line.
