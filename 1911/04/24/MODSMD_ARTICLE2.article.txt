# AN EIGHT-PAGE DAILY MAY BE PRINTED ON ITS OWN PRESSES
## Plans of Students Will Place the College Paper on a Splendid Financial Basis Next Fall. 
### 
Next fall the Daily Palo Alto will
grow into an eight-page newspaper,
printed on its own big press, and with
type set up on its own linotype, if
plans which have been forming for
several months past can be carried
out by men who have worked for their
realization.
For nineteen years, ever since the
paper's founding in 1592, the college
Daily has not changed its size. Wheth
er news was scarce or easily found, it
had to be crowded into what was left
of four pages after the advertisements
had been secured, necessary for its
printing. In the past three years, and
especially in the last two semesters,
the editor has been forced lo reduce
news "stories" that required two col
umns to do them justice, to almost
nothing, and in many cases, has kept
the news on the table for weeks, be
cause there was lack of space. The
Daily has been up close to a stone wall
because it could not increase its size
and make more space for news. It
could not grow to eight pages when
printed by contract, because no man
ager could get the extra advertise
ments and subscriptions needed to pay
for the contract. The only way to do
was to buy a printing plant of its own
and, by the use of economy, and by
not having to pay fancy prices to an
outside printer, save money enough to
grow to eight pages, and pay off the
debt required for buying the plant.
Daily Could Save $1500
The Daily has been published each
year at a total expense of $4,000. With
its own plant it could # be published for
$2500, everything included, four pages
in size, this amount having been
proved correct by printers, type con
cerns, and other persons competent to
know. There is, then, a sum of $1500
which could be put into the paper,
were it being printed on its own
presses.
IMiint Would Cost #5000
A printing plant necessary for the
needs of the Daily would cost, includ
ing all costs of Installing, $5,000. This
sum includes only second-hand ma
chinery, rebuilt by the companies sel
ling it —a press large enough to carry
the eight pages, and to print 15000

copies per hour, a linotype, a job
press, a paper folder and cutter, and
all advertising type, etc. Such an
outfit would not only be able to fulfill
the needs of an eight-page paper, but
could take care of the Student Body
job work at cost, since that work is
mostly of the simplest kind, including
posters, stationary printing, etc.
It is planned to increase the amount
of advertisements by at least six
columns, making a revenue approxi
mating $1200. Experienced former
managers of the Daily, and the pres
ent manager, agree that it is possible
by hard work to secure at least five
columns more. With a manager who
could spend an unusual amount of
time soliciting, it is reasonably sure
that at least six more columns of ad
vertisements could be added. The
present subscription list totals 750.
Since only four hundred of these come
from the students, it is possible to
secure many more from the campus,
and from the alumni, until the 750
has reached 1,000. That is reasonable,
with a staff of solicitors who have the
spirit.
The total receipts per year would
thus be raised to $6,000. An eight
page paper could be printed for $3,000,
everything mechanical inemded, and
editor's and manager's salaries of $50
per month, etc. That leaves a balance
per year of $3,000. It is planned to
ask the Student Body to buy the plant
and hold it as it does the bleachers,
track, etc. The paper could pay off
its debt of $5,000 at. the rate of at least
$2,000 per year, which would clear the
Daily in two and a half years, and
leaving a margin for unexpected hap
penings .and an over-estimation of
advertisements and subscriptions
mentioned above.
IMiins are Business-like
Members of the Executive Com
mittee have gone carefully into the
figures submitted by men who have
made the plans, and all estimates have
been taken calmly and dispassionately,
and the present standing of the plans
put them upon a remarkably business
like basis. It only remains to secure
the cooperation of the students to
make a Daily everyone will be proud
of.

make a Daily everyone will be proud
of.
Next fall the Daily Palo Alto will
grow into an eight-page newspaper,
printed on its own big press, and with
type set up on its own linotype, if
plans which have been forming for
several months past can be carried
out by men who have worked for their
realization.
For nineteen years, ever since the
paper's founding in 1592, the college
Daily has not changed its size. Wheth
er news was scarce or easily found, it
had to be crowded into what was left
of four pages after the advertisements
had been secured, necessary for its
printing. In the past three years, and
especially in the last two semesters,
the editor has been forced lo reduce
news "stories" that required two col
umns to do them justice, to almost
nothing, and in many cases, has kept
the news on the table for weeks, be
cause there was lack of space. The
Daily has been up close to a stone wall
because it could not increase its size
and make more space for news. It
could not grow to eight pages when
printed by contract, because no man
ager could get the extra advertise
ments and subscriptions needed to pay
for the contract. The only way to do
was to buy a printing plant of its own
and, by the use of economy, and by
not having to pay fancy prices to an
outside printer, save money enough to
grow to eight pages, and pay off the
debt required for buying the plant.
Daily Could Save $1500
The Daily has been published each
year at a total expense of $4,000. With
its own plant it could # be published for
$2500, everything included, four pages
in size, this amount having been
proved correct by printers, type con
cerns, and other persons competent to
know. There is, then, a sum of $1500
which could be put into the paper,
were it being printed on its own
presses.
IMiint Would Cost #5000
A printing plant necessary for the
needs of the Daily would cost, includ
ing all costs of Installing, $5,000. This
sum includes only second-hand ma
chinery, rebuilt by the companies sel
ling it —a press large enough to carry
the eight pages, and to print 15000

copies per hour, a linotype, a job
press, a paper folder and cutter, and
all advertising type, etc. Such an
outfit would not only be able to fulfill
the needs of an eight-page paper, but
could take care of the Student Body
job work at cost, since that work is
mostly of the simplest kind, including
posters, stationary printing, etc.
It is planned to increase the amount
of advertisements by at least six
columns, making a revenue approxi
mating $1200. Experienced former
managers of the Daily, and the pres
ent manager, agree that it is possible
by hard work to secure at least five
columns more. With a manager who
could spend an unusual amount of
time soliciting, it is reasonably sure
that at least six more columns of ad
vertisements could be added. The
present subscription list totals 750.
Since only four hundred of these come
from the students, it is possible to
secure many more from the campus,
and from the alumni, until the 750
has reached 1,000. That is reasonable,
with a staff of solicitors who have the
spirit.
The total receipts per year would
thus be raised to $6,000. An eight
page paper could be printed for $3,000,
everything mechanical inemded, and
editor's and manager's salaries of $50
per month, etc. That leaves a balance
per year of $3,000. It is planned to
ask the Student Body to buy the plant
and hold it as it does the bleachers,
track, etc. The paper could pay off
its debt of $5,000 at. the rate of at least
$2,000 per year, which would clear the
Daily in two and a half years, and
leaving a margin for unexpected hap
penings .and an over-estimation of
advertisements and subscriptions
mentioned above.
IMiins are Business-like
Members of the Executive Com
mittee have gone carefully into the
figures submitted by men who have
made the plans, and all estimates have
been taken calmly and dispassionately,
and the present standing of the plans
put them upon a remarkably business
like basis. It only remains to secure
the cooperation of the students to
make a Daily everyone will be proud
of.
