# The 						Noon Mass Meeting
## 
### 
Matters of extreme importance to
the women of the University are to he
considered at the 12:15 mass meeting

tomorrow. It is plan
ned to completely re
organize the govern
ment of the Women's

League. A more representative plan
of forming the executive board, much
after the method used in selecting the
University Conference is the most im
portant change that will be brought to
a vote. Departmental representation
on our larger governing boards is the
most effectual and democratic method
possible.
Such matters as will be voted on
tomorrow are of vital interest to the
women and should be considered by as
many as can attend.
