The untenable grounds upon which
B. J. O'Donnell and his attorney W. F.
Herron ask for a writ of injunction

against the President of the
University and the Student
Affairs Committee, proves

the real purpose of the action. It is
inconceivable that an injunction could
be granted upon the grounds cited by
the plaintiff. The Quad Board of Con
trol has guaranteed the former man
ager the proceeds of his book sale, so
that no loss will accrue to him thru
bis absence during the sale. As to
the charge that violence will be used
in preventing the book sale, its very
absurdity is its best refutation.
The only purpose of the whole pro
ceeding is one founded on vengeance
and personal spite. Nothing is gained
by the plaintiff and the fair name of
Stanford is only drawn thru slime and
stench by vindictive yellow journals.
