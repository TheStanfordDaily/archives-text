Arrangements for the University
jolly-up, which is to be given by the
Class of 1911 at the Armory in Palo
Alto next Friday evening are complete
and the Committee in charge announce
the final |)lans. Everything that will
add to the success of the evening has
been considered by the Committee and
after a lengthy deliberation they feel
sure that they have hit on a scheme
that will be both novel and entertain
ing.
The jolly-up will bp similar in
character to the Class affairs which
have been given at the Armory in the
past, and have proven so decidedly
successful. The chief difference will
lie in the fact that, the entire Univer
sity will be invited instead of the mem
bers of a particular class.
Junior Opera Songs and Dances.
The program as announced by the
Committee is full of clever features.
Chief among these will be the re-ap
pearance of J. H. Forbes, '13, and his
"Co-ed" chorus. Songs from the
"Uvernian Princess" will be sung, as
well as new songs which have never
been heard on the campus. Another
feature which is sure to make a hit
will be Miss M. Coleman, '13, and G.
H. Be\:rhaus, '13, in tLfe " Ragtime
Rhapsody" and other songs. Still a
third clever act will be a new stunt
which has been arranged by L. Lewis,
'14, and V. W. McCourt, '14. These
two men will be remembered for their
clever work at the 1910 football show.
Overcrowding is Obviated.
There will be no overcrowding even
though a large proportion of the Uni
versity attends the affair. The Com
mittee in their arrangements have con
sidered the problem of the crowd and
believe that they now have it solved so
that all who attend may have at least
a proportionate share of the good time.
The committee have provided for be
tween thirty and forty dances. It is
expected that half the crowd will
dance every other dance. This makes
it equivalent to a twenty dance pro
gram.
During the entire program the Com
mittee has provided for continuous
entertainment, so that those who are
not dancing may be otherwise amused,
As is usual at jolly-ups, "robber"
dances will be in order thruout the
evening, and the regular informality
of such affairs will prevail. Besides
the dances and the special program, a
fine assortment of appetizing dainties
will be provided for the sustenance of
the weary and hungry.
The regular admission price for jol
ly-ups will be charged.
