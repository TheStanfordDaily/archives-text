Editor of Daily Palo Alto:
The statement made last evening in
the Daily by J. A. Quelle in his adver
tisement, that "our contract price for
printing the Daily Palo Alto this year
is $11 an issue, making total cost of
printing 160 issues during the year
$1760" is true as far as it goes. Such
a contract does exist, but that is not
the whole story. Mr. Quelle has not
included the extra items which go into
the cost each month, such as extra
pages, extra copies, etc. These will
make the total average cost per month
$260, as against Mr. Quelle's $220, as
can be proved by the reports of the
Daily manager for the past two years.
The total yearly cost for eight months
printing is therefore $2080 as against
$1760, Mr. Quelle's figures.
Last evening the front page "story"
gave the cost of "publishing" the
paper, $1000. This sum, of course, in
cludes everything connected with the
expenses of the paper, printing, deliv
ering, postage, extra distribution, etc.
When it was stated that an eight-page
paper coud be printed for $3,000, that
included all expenses: wages of lino
typer and pressman, printing paper,
electricity for motors, carriers and
mailing clerk, extra distribution, post
age, miscellaneous expenses of plant,
and salaries of editor and manager.
It also included cost of paper for a
circulation of 1250, as against i,OOO
printed daily now. The paid subscrip
tion list is 750, with 250 gratis copies
to advertisers, etc.
In making these plans for a bigger
Daily the men making them have no
desire to reflect upon Mr. Quelle's
work, or to depreciate what he has
done for the paper in the past ten
years. It is simply a case of economy
thru the Daily owning its own plant,
rather than having the paper printed
by contract, by a publisher who would
naturally not take the interest in the
journal each year that the editor and
manager would. J. C. T.
