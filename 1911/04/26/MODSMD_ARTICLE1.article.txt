# "BIGGER AND BETTER" QUAD OUT NEXT WEEK
## 700 COPIES ASSURED BY PRINTER FOR MONDAY. Will Contain 500 Pages and be First Quad to Chronicle Spring Athletic Events. 
### 
Despite the recent judicial flurry,
the 1912 Quad is due to appear during
the early part of next week. The
printer of the annual has guaranteed
that 700 copies will be completed by
Monday, May 1, and so the distribu
tion will be held either Tuesday or
Wednesday. Furthermore the afore
mentioned distribution of the book in
question will be held on the Quad it
self. It has not, however, been de
termined as yet who will conduct the
sale in person.
The exterior of the book will be
much the same as usual. The cover
is made of Cardinal canvas, long
adopted as the regulation dress for
Quads, but a new feature is promised
in a two-colored decoration of black
and gold. Within the covers, however,
there are almost 500 pages of articles,
statistics, pictures and joshes that
will make the volume well worth the
price.
Only 800 copies of the book are to
be printed and as approximately half
of these have already been subscribed
for by Juniors and other undergrad
uates, those who are desirous of pack
ing a solid chunk of Stanford life to
show admiring relatives during vaca
tion time will do well to place an
order for a book, either at the Book
store or the University Drugstore in
Palo Alto.
The 1912 Quad will be the first, to
chronicle the athletic events of the
season of its issue, and as it also con
tains the records of the spring events
of 1910, the athletic section will be
unusually large and interesting, con
taining over seventy-four pages.
