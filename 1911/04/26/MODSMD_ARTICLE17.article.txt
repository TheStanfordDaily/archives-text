# 1910 to Hold Final Reunion.
## 
### 
Men of the Class of 1910 will hold a
final reunion at 8:30 on Thursday
evening in room 154 in Encina. There
are still forty-five men of last year's
graduating class on the campus, and if
their spirit has not waned since the
days when they tied up this year's
reverend Seniors, there will undoubt
edly be a full response to this last op
portunity to meet before the big re
union that is planned for 1912. Room
154 is on the fourth floor of Encina at
the east end of the main corridor, and
it is earnestly hoped that every loyal
'10 man on the campus will find his
way there tomorrow night.
