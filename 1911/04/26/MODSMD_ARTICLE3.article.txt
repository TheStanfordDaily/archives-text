In one of most ex
citing Student Body
elections that the
Quad has yet wit
nessed the Associat
ed students today
chose the men who
will guide the ship
of state of the asso-.l
ciation for the en
suing year. The
total vote cast was

518 and the count was not completed
until 6 o'clock. The officers chosen
today were K. L. Schaupp, president;
S. H Bellah. v'ce-president; K. S.
Worthington, secretary; D. W. Bur
bank, graduate manager; J.C.Thomas,
Editor, Daily Palo Alto; J. F. Wilson,
Business Manager, Daily Palo Alto;
L. S. Mann, Business Manager
"Sequoia"; T. L. Coleman, '12, S. C.
Kennedy, '12, A. M. Ambrose, '13, and
F. B. Watkins, '14, executive com
mitteemen.
Neither of the trio of aspirants for
the editorial toga of the "Sequoia"
received a majority of the votes cast.
L. L. Hill has a plurality of sixty-five
votes; thirty-three less than a major
ity. There was considerable argument
over the mooted election ot the polls
due to the Fifth Amendment, passed
today which requires the withdrawal
of the candidate receiving the lowest
number of votes cast in a contest in
which no man receives a majority of
the vote. The Constitution, since
adoption has had a provision which
reads as follows:
Sec. 2. It shall require a majority
of the number of votes cast to effect
tlie election of any officer, except!
members of the committees, who may
be elected by a plurality. In case of
failure to elect within tlie prescribed
time, it shall be the duty of the Exec
utive Committee to provide further
elections as early as possible.
From this It can be seen that the
new amendment merely adds to this
old provision that the Executive Com
mittee in providing for «a new election
must, drop from the contest a can
didate receiving the least number of
votes.
Whether or not the Editor of the
"Sequoia" can be chissed as an officer
of the Association was also questioned.
The Student Body officials are desig

nated as a President, Vice-President,
| Secretary and Graduate-Manager. No
! mention is made of the "Sequoia"
editor but it is evident from the fact
I that for twenty-one years the said
I journalist has been classified on the
j ballot as a Student Body official that
I the spirit of the Constitution considers
I him such even tho the letter of the
I law fails to state so. M. M. Fogel, the
I nominee receiving the lowest number
of votes, has announced his withdraw
al, so the field is cleared for another
election between Hill and Robinson.
The new amendment consequently has
no effect on the new election. The
Executive Committee will meet tonight
to decide whether or not the "Sequoia"
; editor shall be classed as an officer
j of the Association under the Article
JV, section 2, of the Constitution. No
i doubt an election will be held soon.
The Amendments dealing with the
classes from which the Associated
officers shall be chosen; with giving
the Editor-in-chief of the"Daily Palo
| Alto",a place on the Executive Com
mittee, and that providing for a rem
| edy in case of elections where no can
| didate receives a majority were passed
,by substantial majorities. The amend
ment to change the salary of the Grad
uate Manager failed to receive the
necessary two-thirds vo'e fnd so was
l lost.

Rosa, the President-elect, has been
prominently identified with undergrad
uate activities since his registration
at Stanford. He was captain of the
11911 crew and has been a member of

In one of most ex
citing Student Body
elections that the
Quad has yet wit
nessed the Associat
ed students today
chose the men who
will guide the ship
of state of the asso-.l
ciation for the en
suing year. The
total vote cast was

518 and the count was not completed
until 6 o'clock. The officers chosen
today were K. L. Schaupp, president;
S. H Bellah. v'ce-president; K. S.
Worthington, secretary; D. W. Bur
bank, graduate manager; J.C.Thomas,
Editor, Daily Palo Alto; J. F. Wilson,
Business Manager, Daily Palo Alto;
L. S. Mann, Business Manager
"Sequoia"; T. L. Coleman, '12, S. C.
Kennedy, '12, A. M. Ambrose, '13, and
F. B. Watkins, '14, executive com
mitteemen.
Neither of the trio of aspirants for
the editorial toga of the "Sequoia"
received a majority of the votes cast.
L. L. Hill has a plurality of sixty-five
votes; thirty-three less than a major
ity. There was considerable argument
over the mooted election ot the polls
due to the Fifth Amendment, passed
today which requires the withdrawal
of the candidate receiving the lowest
number of votes cast in a contest in
which no man receives a majority of
the vote. The Constitution, since
adoption has had a provision which
reads as follows:
Sec. 2. It shall require a majority
of the number of votes cast to effect
tlie election of any officer, except!
members of the committees, who may
be elected by a plurality. In case of
failure to elect within tlie prescribed
time, it shall be the duty of the Exec
utive Committee to provide further
elections as early as possible.
From this It can be seen that the
new amendment merely adds to this
old provision that the Executive Com
mittee in providing for «a new election
must, drop from the contest a can
didate receiving the least number of
votes.
Whether or not the Editor of the
"Sequoia" can be chissed as an officer
of the Association was also questioned.
The Student Body officials are desig

nated as a President, Vice-President,
| Secretary and Graduate-Manager. No
! mention is made of the "Sequoia"
editor but it is evident from the fact
I that for twenty-one years the said
I journalist has been classified on the
j ballot as a Student Body official that
I the spirit of the Constitution considers
I him such even tho the letter of the
I law fails to state so. M. M. Fogel, the
I nominee receiving the lowest number
of votes, has announced his withdraw
al, so the field is cleared for another
election between Hill and Robinson.
The new amendment consequently has
no effect on the new election. The
Executive Committee will meet tonight
to decide whether or not the "Sequoia"
; editor shall be classed as an officer
j of the Association under the Article
JV, section 2, of the Constitution. No
i doubt an election will be held soon.
The Amendments dealing with the
classes from which the Associated
officers shall be chosen; with giving
the Editor-in-chief of the"Daily Palo
| Alto",a place on the Executive Com
mittee, and that providing for a rem
| edy in case of elections where no can
| didate receives a majority were passed
,by substantial majorities. The amend
ment to change the salary of the Grad
uate Manager failed to receive the
necessary two-thirds vo'e fnd so was
l lost.

Rosa, the President-elect, has been
prominently identified with undergrad
uate activities since his registration
at Stanford. He was captain of the
11911 crew and has been a member of
the Varsity crews for two years.

| and also played lock on the 1912 Inter
collegiate Freshman team. At present

; games at London in 1908, competing in
I both the pole vault and broad jump.

In one of most ex
citing Student Body
elections that the
Quad has yet wit
nessed the Associat
ed students today
chose the men who
will guide the ship
of state of the asso-.l
ciation for the en
suing year. The
total vote cast was

518 and the count was not completed
until 6 o'clock. The officers chosen
today were K. L. Schaupp, president;
S. H Bellah. v'ce-president; K. S.
Worthington, secretary; D. W. Bur
bank, graduate manager; J.C.Thomas,
Editor, Daily Palo Alto; J. F. Wilson,
Business Manager, Daily Palo Alto;
L. S. Mann, Business Manager
"Sequoia"; T. L. Coleman, '12, S. C.
Kennedy, '12, A. M. Ambrose, '13, and
F. B. Watkins, '14, executive com
mitteemen.
Neither of the trio of aspirants for
the editorial toga of the "Sequoia"
received a majority of the votes cast.
L. L. Hill has a plurality of sixty-five
votes; thirty-three less than a major
ity. There was considerable argument
over the mooted election ot the polls
due to the Fifth Amendment, passed
today which requires the withdrawal
of the candidate receiving the lowest
number of votes cast in a contest in
which no man receives a majority of
the vote. The Constitution, since
adoption has had a provision which
reads as follows:
Sec. 2. It shall require a majority
of the number of votes cast to effect
tlie election of any officer, except!
members of the committees, who may
be elected by a plurality. In case of
failure to elect within tlie prescribed
time, it shall be the duty of the Exec
utive Committee to provide further
elections as early as possible.
From this It can be seen that the
new amendment merely adds to this
old provision that the Executive Com
mittee in providing for «a new election
must, drop from the contest a can
didate receiving the least number of
votes.
Whether or not the Editor of the
"Sequoia" can be chissed as an officer
of the Association was also questioned.
The Student Body officials are desig

nated as a President, Vice-President,
| Secretary and Graduate-Manager. No
! mention is made of the "Sequoia"
editor but it is evident from the fact
I that for twenty-one years the said
I journalist has been classified on the
j ballot as a Student Body official that
I the spirit of the Constitution considers
I him such even tho the letter of the
I law fails to state so. M. M. Fogel, the
I nominee receiving the lowest number
of votes, has announced his withdraw
al, so the field is cleared for another
election between Hill and Robinson.
The new amendment consequently has
no effect on the new election. The
Executive Committee will meet tonight
to decide whether or not the "Sequoia"
; editor shall be classed as an officer
j of the Association under the Article
JV, section 2, of the Constitution. No
i doubt an election will be held soon.
The Amendments dealing with the
classes from which the Associated
officers shall be chosen; with giving
the Editor-in-chief of the"Daily Palo
| Alto",a place on the Executive Com
mittee, and that providing for a rem
| edy in case of elections where no can
| didate receives a majority were passed
,by substantial majorities. The amend
ment to change the salary of the Grad
uate Manager failed to receive the
necessary two-thirds vo'e fnd so was
l lost.

Rosa, the President-elect, has been
prominently identified with undergrad
uate activities since his registration
at Stanford. He was captain of the
11911 crew and has been a member of
the Varsity crews for two years.

| and also played lock on the 1912 Inter
collegiate Freshman team. At present

; games at London in 1908, competing in
I both the pole vault and broad jump.
Bellah is a member of Encina Club and
of Skull and Snakes honor society.
