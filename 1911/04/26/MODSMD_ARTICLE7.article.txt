## Fourteen's Chance 
### 
As the Freshmen in the coming
weeks are seen counting the hours on
their cards, many a man of them will
be weary of the straight and narrow
road which leads to Phi

Beta Kappa. Neverthe
less each will know much

of that many-sided thing
called college life, and will above all
realize this truth: The real life of a
college is measured largely by the rich
ness and character of its customs and
traditions. Knowing this, the Fresh
men will welcome the opportunity to
help give momentum to one most wor
thy custom. This is the Senior Week
for every Stanford man. ft is to be a
week when Underclassmen and Sen
iors and parents and alumni will all be
joyfully jumbled in Wallace Irwin's
mixing-bowl, the Quad. It is to be a
week similar to those of which Eastern
colleges boast. It is to be a week
which will make for a more loyal and
interested alumni. It is to be a week
when all will be lost in the delights
of barbecues and banquets and merry
making and splendid addresses, and
practically every feature will appeal
as strongly to the first-year man as to
the Senior. When the Freshmen are
themselves Seniors they will extend
heartfelt thanks to the originators of
the idea. This year they can show
their appreciation by remaining to aid
in a successful Senior Week for Nine
teen-eleven. Incidentally, they will
have a mighty fine time, in those days
when carnival reigns on the Row and
finals are things of the past and'every
Palo Alto merchant is getting out the
only official Red Hat for nineteen
fourteen trade. A Freshman who can
stay and does not. is less worthy than
his fellows of this same red hat.
