# COSMOPOLITAN CLUB TALKS AND DINES OUTDOORS.
## 
### 
Under the leadership of President
David Starr Jordan, 25 members of the
Cosmopolitan Club made merry last
night in the bed of San Francisquito
Creek, not far from the Roble Bridge.
A huge bonfire on the bank, a
thoroughly cosmopolitan "feed" and
extemporaneous speeches were the
outward manifestations of the enjoy
ment of the revelers.
Speakers whose open-air oratory
added to the merriment were Presi
dent Jordan, Doctor Gardner, Student
Advisor Roth, Rev. John Gleason,
Professors A. M. Espinosa, A. L. Guer
ard and S. K. Low.
