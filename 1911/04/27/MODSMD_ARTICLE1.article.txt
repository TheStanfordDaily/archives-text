# COLEMAN WILL CAPTAIN VARSITY TRACK TEAM
## SPEEDY SPRINTER IS UNANIMOUS CHOICE OF SQUAD. Veteran of Three Years Will Lead the Stanford Athletes Thru Season of 1912. 
### 
By a nuanimous vote of the Varsity
squad, T. L. Coleman, '12, was named
this afternoon as the man to assume
the duties of captaining the 1912 Var
sity Track Team. The selection of the
Cardinal sprinter comes as a logical
choice and as a just recognition of
three years of invaluable service to
Stanford on the Oval.
Coleman entered college with the
Class of 1912 and was selected in his
first year to captain the Freshman
track team. Carrying away both
sprints in the Freshman and Varsity

Intercollegiate meets, he accomplished
a feat unprecedented in the athletic
history of the college.
During the season of 1910, Coleman
was among the season's highest point
winners, and again led the field on the
day of the meet with California with
ten points to his credit. His Intercol
legiate and Stanford record of :22 flat,
in the furlong has stood unmolested
hy the sprinters of either college. This
is essentially his race and it is ex
pected hy many that he will go under
flat time in the coming season.
His untimely breakdown this year
come as a severe shock to all. He had
been timed at :10 flat and:22 flat in
the sprints and had added greatly to
the Stanford score board in all the
preliminary meets. This one little
mishap is the only thing which could
have interfered with Coleman's making
40 points in the Intercollegiate meets
The newly elected cantain serves
both on the Executive Comimttee and
the Tnterscholastic Hoard of Gover

Angeles and is a member of Skull and
