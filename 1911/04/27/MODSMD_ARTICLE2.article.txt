# EVERYBODY JOLLIES-UP TOMORROW NIGHT!
## Whole University Will Be at Armory For Most Remarkable Festivity in Stanford's Social History. 
### 
Since Jolly-ups for the separate
classes have proved such unqualified
successes as Stanford, it is logical to

presume that the
University Jolly-up
at the Armory to
morrow evening,
which will include
all four classes anr'
the Holdovers, will
be five times as
great a success as
any preceding affair
of the kind.
Laying aside the
mere question of,
numbers that are
expected, the pre-

parations that the Seniors are making,
insure a Jolly-up that even the shadow
of the approaching finals will be un
able to darken. Tho no queening to
and from will be allowed, the affair
will be a splendid opportunity to meet
that queen whom you have been trying
to get an introduction to all semester.
Whatever her class or classiness may
be, she will be there tomorrow even

ing along with everybody else in the
! University.
Dancing, stunts, new features of the
Junior Opera chorus and other attrac
j tive features are promised by the com
j mittee in charge. It will be a fitting
forerunner of the big University Car
nival that will be held during Com
mencement Week, and should do much
to recall the halcyon days of the Pio
neers when the Stanford Student Body
was like one big family.
A double orchestra will be provided
| so that the music will be continuous
and all endurance records for Paul
Jones's are confidently expected to go
by the board. The refreshments plan
ned are new and unusual and will be
supplied in bounteous quantities.
Some very interesting talks are also
scheduled, and it is hard to see what
more could be needed to make the
first University Jolly-up an affair that
will demand successive encores in
years to come. The usual admission
charge of fifty cents will be made at
the door, and special cars will be pro
vided for those coming back to the
