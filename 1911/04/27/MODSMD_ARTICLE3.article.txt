# SECOND ELECTION TOMORROW TO CHOOSE SEQUOIA EDITOR
## Executive Committee Interprets Constitution as Requiring Another Ballot.—Robinson and Hill Candidates. 
### 
A second general Student Body elec
tion to be held on the Quad tomorrow
has been called by the Executive Com
mittee. The Student Body will vote
to elect an editor for the Sequoia, the
two candidates for the position being
L. M. Robinson and L. L. Hill.
The second election has been called
as a result of the Executive Com
mittee's action of yesterday evening in
declaring editors and managers of
student publications, Student Body of
ficers. As such the constitution re
quires a majority vote to elect. Altho
Hill received a plurality in yesterday's
election, he failed to secure a majority
over his two opponents, Robinson and
Fogel. Fogel has since withdrawn, so
that Robinson and Hill are left in the
race.
The polls open at 11:15 and close at
2:.10.
Aside from calling tomorrow's elec
tion, several other matters of import
ance were passed upon by the govern
ing board. Chief among these was
the ordering of a new Stanford debat
ing cup to renlace the one won by
Lowell High School last Saturday and
the granting of minor sport emblems
to the members of the Intercollegiate
tennis team.
The minutes of the Executive Com
mittee meeting follow:
President G. A. Ditz in the chair.
