# WILL REPRINT FAMOUS VERSE AND DRAWINGS
## TOMORROW'S CHAPARRAL TO CONTAIN BEST WORK OF PAST. Wallace Irwin, Larrey Bowman and Many Others Represented in Coming Issue. 
### 
Tho the issue of the Chaparral that
will appear on the Quad tomorrow
morning is called a "Back Number,"
it must be understood that the term
does not carry with it anything of re
proach. Tomorrow's magazine will
have for contents the pick of the best
work of the men who made the Stan
ford Chaparral famous among college
publications.
Prominent among the things Editor
Bliven has selected, will be the peren
nially appropriate "Graduates by Re
quest," which Wallace Irwin contribut
ed long ago. Larrey Bowman's splen
did sonnet "Graduation," which Pro
fessor Newcomer has pronounced the
finest achievement of all Stanford's
undergraduate literary work, is in
cluded. Light verse and pictures from
the same inimitable pen are also fea
tures.
Leo Levy's parody beginning:
""Twas the night after New Years, and
all through the house
Not a creature was stirring save pa
with a souse,"
is part of a worthy company. The
"Sonnets of a Murderer," by Hopkins
and Duffus are excellent examples of
later work on the magazine and lose
nothing by comparison.
The editorials include the very first
"Now That." by Bristow Adams. one
from Oppenheim on the "spy system"
at Stanford, and Dug Ferry's famous
lament at the end of the booze regime.
The art, too, is of the very highest
character. In addition to Bowman's
work there are two half-tones by Vir
gil Bellows. and the best cartonn that
Mick Helmick ever drew. A1 Kocher's
design for a book-plate for Professor
Clark is a singularly appropriate and
well executed idea. A cartoon series
by Stan Dixon amply justifies its in
clusion.
The Chaparral is such a distinctive
feature of Stanford, and tomorrow's
issue will contain such representative
examples of the work that has made it
so, that an unusual sale will undoubt
edly result. It may be purchased on
the Quad tomorrow morning for the
usual price.
