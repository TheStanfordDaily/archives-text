# 1912 QUAD IS READY FOR BINDER. LAST PAGE PRINTED.
## Book Will be Largest Stanford Annual. â€”Is Profusely Illustrated. 
### 
The last page of the 1912 Quad fell
off the press yesterday afternoon and
so now the annual is stacked up in
huge piles, ready for the bindery to
commence operations. So large is Ihe
book to be, that if all the paper on
which the pages are printed, were to
be gathered together, it would form
two towers forty-five feet high and
four feet square.
The volume is illustrated to the ex
tent that there are only seven pages
which are not rendered more artistic
by the presence of a cut. There are
photographs of all the events of the
college year, pictures of all the num
erous organizations, headings, josh
snapshots, and twenty-six full page
drawings by the best members of the
Art department.
