"The editorial policy of the "Sequoia"
will be conducted so as to "reflect what
the Student Body is thinking about,"
said the newly-chosen editor in an
interview this afternoon. "This has
been the aim of my predecessors and
my idea is to publish a wide-awake
journal with a sane attitude. I am
sure that an inestimable amount of
literary talent lies dorment at Stanford
and it will be my aim to foster the
development of this heretofore un
known ability. Under my editorship
the "Sequoia" will not voice the per
sonal opinion of the editor, but that of
the Stanford college public."
