# Rowing and Dancing
## 
### 
The editor of the Daily Palo Alto a
year ago, in speaking editorially of
the Boat Club dance said, "The Stu-

dent Body, collectively,
lias denied its aid to
rowing, but the Student
Body individually, now

has an opportunity to render material
assistance."
Since this statement was made, the
Student Body no longer collectively
denies rowing its aid. This, however,
should not deter us individually from
extending our support to this worthy
sport. It is only because those in
control of it have carried the burden
economically and successfully that it
is on an intercollegiate basis at all.
It is too large a task, however, for a
mere liandfull of men to handle and
everyone should be willing to cooper
ate. We should be glad to show our
appreciation of the wonders that have
been accomplished this year by the
Coaching Committee and the squad.
If you haven't made a date for the
dance do so now and buy a ticket
Tuesday.
