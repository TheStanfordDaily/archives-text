# TICKETS FOR CREW BENEFIT TO GO ON SALE TUESDAY.
## Admissions to Armory Dance May be Secured at Law Steps at $1 Each. 
### 
Tickets for the much looked-forward
to crew dance will go on sale on the
Quad next Tuesday morning at the
Law steps. One dollar per couple will
be the charge for admission.
May 5, as already announced, is the
date of this dance, the last informal of
the semester. All arrangements are
completed and it is hoped to make
this affair as great a success as the
dance given a year ago. Attractive
programs have been secured and the
campus orchestra has promised an
exceptionally good quality of music.
The receipts from the ticket sale
will go into a fund to help pay for
new equipment which will be needed
next semester.
