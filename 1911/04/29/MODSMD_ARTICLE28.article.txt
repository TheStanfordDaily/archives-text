# 1910 Jollies-up.

### 
Ignoring the "come back theory,"
thirty-five members of the Class of
1910 gathered last evening and proved
that the spirit which characterized the
undergraduate days of the class was
still alive. The get-together, which
will be the last before the big re
union planned for 1912, was held in
Encina Hall.
After the usual songs, stories and
eats, the 1910 men entertained several
of the prominent graduates of 1909 by
way of an old time "immersion party."
