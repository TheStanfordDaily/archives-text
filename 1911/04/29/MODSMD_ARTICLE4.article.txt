# CALIFORNIA DRAMATIC SOCIETY TO SEE FARCE
## MASK AND DAGGER WILL ATTEND SENIOR PLAY EN MASSE. "Amazons" Rounding Into Excellent Form Under Able Direction of Coach Mathieu. 
### 
Not only is the campus showing a
remarkable interest in the Senior
"The Amazons," which is to be
given in the Assembly Hall 011 the
opening of May 17, but many outside
the University as well are making
plans to see the performance. This
was particularly shown, when Chair
man T. N. Turner, '11, of the Farce
Committee received a communication
from the dramatic society of the Uni
versity of California, Mask and Dag
ger. that that organization would jour
ney down en masse to see the perform
ance.
In spite of the fact that Coach Math
ieu has not been at rehearsals fr sev
eral days owing to an engagement in
the Southern part of the state, the play
has been progressing nicely. The
lines have been almost learned and the
business is rapidly rounding into form.
Already the work of the leading play
ers is assuming a form that bodes well
for the final performance.
The play is a roaring farce. Some
might be deterred from attending ow
ing to the fact that the playwright is
Pinero, whose works are usually of a
serious character. This is anything
but the case wifh "The Amazons." It
is the author's lightest work. Abound
ing in clever, snappy lines, in excellent
situations, all of them of a more or
less humorous character, the play is
sure to make a hit.
It deals with the adventures of three
young women who have been raised as
young men owing to the fact that their
parents desired heirs, and the he'rs
failed to make their anpearance. Dis
gusted with fate, the inmates of Over
cote Castle, where the entire action is
laid, train their daughters to box,
fence, and hunt, with a truly masculine
air. The intrusion of three suitors on
the scene causes all the trouble.
Reheursals are being held three or
four times each week. Next, week
after the return of Coach Mathieu, they
will probably be held every evening.
