The work of restoring the buildings
completely wrecked by the earth quake
may now be started as a result of the

munificence of
Thomas Welt on
Stanford in donat
ing $100,000 for the

rebuilding of the Stanford Museum.
Once again we express our unbounded
gratitude to Mr. Stanford for his great,
work of restoring the Uinversity to its
original position before the terrible
catastrophe of 1906.
