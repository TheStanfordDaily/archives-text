# A Good Quad

### 
Editor J. W. Howell of the 1012 Quad
lias finished the hardest editorial task
of any editor since Bickel. '07, had

his completed volume
destroyed by the earth
quake. Howell has done

an incalculable service to his class and
to the University in surmounting the
obstacles that have come his way and
in editing the book that he has. Judg
ing from an advanced copy which we
have been privileged to see, we are
glad to assume the responsibility of
recommending it to everyone. Such
a book is well up to the standard of
past annuals and is well worth its
selling price. One graduating without
four volumes of the Stanford Quad in
bis possession does not properly round
out his University career. The Quad
is the connecting link between the past
and the present and grows more val
uable as the years go by.
