# TEMPERANCE PRIZE OFFERED FOR BEST STUDENT ESSAY.
## Palo Alto W. C. T.U. Will Again Award Fifty Dollars for Total Abstinence Paper. 
### 
Definite announcement has been
made of the reoffering by the W. C. T.
U. of Palo Alto of the cash prize of
fifty dollars for the best essay written
by a Stanford student upon the sub
ject of "The Relation of Individual
Total Abstinence to National Pros
perity." Enough interest has been
manifested in this competition to jus
tify the offer of this prize for the third
time and it is hoped that such interest
will continue so that this competition
shall become a permanent one like
the Bonnheim and Peace Prizes.

The essays are to be more than two
thousand and not over three thousand
words in length and must be submitted
on or before July 1, 1911. This is two
months later than has been the cus
tom, but careful consideration on the
part of the authorities has led to the
belief that this is a more convenient
time for the contestants in general.
There are three such competitions
throughout the state, one at Stanford,
one at the University of the Pacific and
one at California. The essays which
win the awards in these local contests
are putin competition with each other
for the state award which also
amounts to fifty dollars. Those es
says which win the state awards are
then submitted to another board of
judges who determine that one which
is to be given the national award of
one hundred dollars.
