# DR. GARDNER PREACHES ON RELATION OF CHURCH TO PEACE.
## Emphasises Necessity of Christian Cooperation in Furthering World Movement. 
### 
"The Peace Movement," was the sub
ject of Dr. Gardner's sermon yesterday
morning. Using as his text, Isaiah
32:17, "The work of righteousness
shall be peace; and the effect of
righteousness, quietness and assur
ance forever,' he harmonized well the
spirit of the old prophets with the idea
of peace which is swaying the world
today.
In presenting his thoughts, Dr. Gard
ner divided his subject into three
parts, discussing the old prophetic
ideal of peace, the lighting instinct in
mankind, and the relation of the
Christian idea to the Peace Movement.
He said that in these days, especially
in republics, war is only possible when
public opinion demands it, and that as
militarism is the evil of our age,
church and school must unite in edu
cating the people to a realization of
the horrors of war and the necessity
of peace.
He showed that the world is ready
for peace, for the nations are stagger
ing under war debts, evidences of in
ternational good will are manifest
everywhere, and the spirit of the age
is that of universal brotherhood. His
plea was that as leadership would
count most in the success of the move
ment, each American should strive to
have our country gain it. He said
that the movement is bound to suc
ceed as it is humanitarian in character
and based on the teachings of Christ,
but that it needs the inspiration of the
church. He called attention to the
surprising lack of Christian literature
on international peace.
