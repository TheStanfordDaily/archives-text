## 
### 
The April number of the Alumnus,
which has recently appeared is a very
strong issue. It treats intimately of
University problems in a way that
makes many points which are gener
ally unknown very clear. Particularly
is this true of the leading article en
titled "Money and Work at the Univer
sity." This article treats of the sen
eral University revenue and the main
sources of expenditure. Many inter
esting points as to the finances of the
institution are explained.
Other articles treat of the Founder's
Day banquet, and the eating club prob
lem ; the work of Dudley, '03, as head
of the state horticultural bureau; the
action of the Trustees at the last meet
ins: the festivities of Junior .Week;
the Roosevelt, Macdonald, and Tarbell
addresses; Student Body finances, and
the athletic history of the past month.
The editorials deal with the needs of
the Alumni Association and the need
of the University for a Department of
Forestry. Several other minor topics
are also touched editorially.
