# QUAD PRINTS EVENTS OF A FORTNIGHT AGO
## FIRST "UP-TO-DATE" ANNUAL ON SALE TOMORROW. 1912 Book is More Convenient and More "Alive" than Previous Editions. 
### 
Stanford's first "up-to date" Quad
appears for sale tomorrow morning
at 9:15 on the Quadrangle near the
Law steps. Only half of the edition
is to be sold tomorrow, because of a
mistake in binding. A second lot will
be disposed of, accordingly, on Wed
nesday, at the same hour. Juniors
cannot secure their reserved copies
without receipts.
The "up-to-dateness" of the annual
consists in twenty-three pages of this
spring's athletic events, an experiment
in "live" matter that has never before
been tried by editors. Quad readers
have been forced to wrinkle their fore
heads over an athletic section that was
"dead" about six months or a year
a.40, and to revive enthusiasm for
races and games that have long since
passed to the record of years. This
time, however, Editor Howell and his
sporting editor have full particulars
and pictures of baseball, track, and
crew events that occurred only two
weeks ago, and the college annual ap
proaches dangerously near to the ter
ritory reserved for the college dally.
Other changed features of the big
book are the omitting of long, stereo
typed articles 011 various subjects con
nected with the University, which are
repeated over and over each year in
different disguises; and the better ar
rangement and printing of larse illus
trations. Instead of pivoting the book
around various angles to view prop
erly a large half-tone picture of the
Prom, such a photograph as this has
been printed from side to side of the
page, rather than end to end. Every
picture in the annual is placed in that
way, a great convenience to everyone.
The 1912 book is one step nearer to
perfection in college yearly publica
tions.
