# LAW MEN CONTRIBUTE TO LIBRARY EXTENSION FUND.
## 
### 
To contribute to a memorial fund to
be used to buy law books along some
particular line, or for some other pur
pose to be devised, is the plan of the
men who expect to receive the Juris
Doctor degree this spring. It is hoped
by this action to set a precedent thru
which other classes, both in and out
of the Law department, may express
their Stanford loyalty.
The members of the class were en
tertained recently at the home of
Professor F. C. Woodward , and in
meeting determined upon this plan.
The details have not as yet been ar
ranged but it is planned to have each
man contribute $1 at the end of this
year, $2 next year, and larger amounts
at stated times so that in the end a
considerable sum will be raised with

out. working any hardship on the in
dividual members of the class.
