# QUAD HAS A LARGE SALE
## 1912 VOLUME IS WELL DECEIVED BY STUDENTS. Original Book Crammed With Interesting Details.â€”Spring Athletics a Feature. 
### 
Every copy of the 460 volumes 1
of the 1912 Quad brought to the
campus were sold today. The re
maining Quads will arrive from
San Francisco tonight and will go
on sale tomorrow morning. The
sale will be open to the general
public as well as to those paying
assessments.

From the impressive and well-print
ed dedication to Coach George J. Pres
ley to the final page of thanks to his
staff by the editor, the 1912 Quad, the
eighteenth volume, issued this morn
ing, marks another mile-stone in Stan
ford annuals. Mingling statistics and
events of popular interest in an at
tractive way, the book deserves to
take its place on the shelf of Stanford
history with the annuals that have
gone before, and to be a standard to
which succeeding Junior Classes may
strive.
The book does not "weigh" in avoir
dupois as much as volumes of former
years, and in that the editor has done
well. He has condensed rather than
expanded, and has omitted many of
the long articles and useless matter
that may well be cvlled "excess
baggage." The chief of the book says,
in his foreword: "Instead of trying
to increase the size of the Quad, we
have endeavored to make this volume
as small as possible, owing to the be
lief that the growth in bulk in recent
years has been abnormal and un
necessary." This year's editor then,
has only quality emphasized, rather
than quality and quantity. And in that
he has made a step forward.
"Quads are Quads," continues the
foreword, "and it is difficult toembelish
a book of statistics." But the 1912
management has succeeded, surely, for
it is no task to follow the pages along
to their end. There are plenty of en
couragements by the way side, also, in
the shape of illustrations. Tt has been
the boast of the present Quad men that
they have left but seven pages in the
four hundred and forty-six, unadorned
by drawing or photograph. The pages
of this spring's athletics, are espec
ially well illustrated.
An unusual method of giving the
Class History and a picturesque fea
ture of the annual is the work of L. D.
Summerfield in his ."History 1912."
He has followed the University group
represented by " '12' by means of a
"syllabus" whose subdivisions, "A-H-
C-D-E-F-G" are headings for the fol
lowing: "Introduction; Political:
Civil Wars and Feuds: International
Wars with the Berkeleyites; Social:
Dramatics and Literary: Conclusion.''
The book will continue on sale on
the Quad tomorrow. It enjoyed an
unusually large sale to-day.

has only quality emphasized, rather
than quality and quantity. And in that
he has made a step forward.
"Quads are Quads," continues the
foreword, "and it is difficult toembelish
a book of statistics." But the 1912
management has succeeded, surely, for
it is no task to follow the pages along
to their end. There are plenty of en
couragements by the way side, also, in
the shape of illustrations. Tt has been
the boast of the present Quad men that
they have left but seven pages in the
four hundred and forty-six, unadorned
by drawing or photograph. The pages
of this spring's athletics, are espec
ially well illustrated.
An unusual method of giving the
Class History and a picturesque fea
ture of the annual is the work of L. D.
Summerfield in his ."History 1912."
He has followed the University group
represented by " '12' by means of a
"syllabus" whose subdivisions, "A-H-
C-D-E-F-G" are headings for the fol
lowing: "Introduction; Political:
Civil Wars and Feuds: International
Wars with the Berkeleyites; Social:
Dramatics and Literary: Conclusion.''
The book will continue on sale on
the Quad tomorrow. It enjoyed an
unusually large sale to-day.
