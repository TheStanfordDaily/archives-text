# Queening at Jolly-Ups
## 
### 
The following communication from
.T. E. Thompson, '11, concerning the
best way to conduct Jolly-ups is

placed in the editorial
column because of tlie
Daily Palo Alto's
strong approval of

the sentiments expressed by the found
er of the Jolly-up as a Stanford insti
tution. This institution should be
maintained as it was originated a year
ago. The communication follows:
"Jolly-ups did not 'just happen.'
They were promoted with the idea of
filling a want. The purpose of the
jolly-up is: 'To permit all the differ
ent factions of a class, or of the Uni
versity, to get. together, mix and min
gle freely, and become acquainted.'
Before their institution there was no
piece of social machinery at Stanford
which accomplished this result.
"Exact equality—whether one be
from the 'Row' or Roble, Encina or
Palo Alto, 'Queener' or 'Kinger'—is
the only medium thru which the pur
pose of the 'jolly-up' can lie fulfilled.
To have exact equality every person
must go and return by himself or her
self and pay his or her own expenses.
Introductions must be swept aside, for
some would meet many, others but
few. Programs are tabooed for many
would have good programs, others
would have full programs and some
would have 'just programs.'
"Friday night a digression from this
fundamental principal of exact equal
ity took place. Some people 'queened'
to the University jolly-up and more
than a hundred couple 'queened' home
Every advertising card and every
write up referring to that jolly-up con
tained directions 'no queening, coming
or going.' At the Senior Class meet
ing held last week the 'non-queening'
element was emphasized. Still, the
majority of the offenders were mem
bers of the Class of 1911. They were
the leaders in abusing an institution
which they themselves had founded.
"Some people have the mistaken
idea that it is all light to 'queen' home,
if everybody goes down alone. No one
thing will defeat more thoroughly the
purpose of the jolly-up or send it to
the grave quicker.
"No girl is going down to the jolly
up and take a chance on coming home

alone if she knows other girls are
'queening' home.
"Many fellows who do not 'queen'
would prefer to stay away rather than
mix with girls who owe their presence
to the fact that some fellow had
'slated' them up before hand.
"There is just one place to draw the*
line —"no queening going or returning
for anybody.' Then everybody will
feel free to come and go, knowing they
are on exactly the same basis as every
oilier person.
"But—women of Stanford —the fel
lows will 'sign' some of you up to
'queen' home, come what will—if you
will let them. Don't let them. Do (he
right thing by the 'jolly-ups!'
"For one time allow everybody to
have a fair field with no favorites."
