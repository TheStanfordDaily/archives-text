# SENIOR FARCE SECURES EFFICIENT PRESS AGENT.
## 
### 
The Business Office has turned press
agent for"The Amazons," the Senior
Farce which promises to score such au
unusual success. It lias provided a
"thriller" far superior to the custom
ary theft, of the leading lady's jewels.
A few days ago small signs advertis
ing the farce were hung on the trees
about the campus, and last night all of
these which could lie found were re
moved, by orders from headquarters.
Whether the strictly scientific eyes of
the authorities were offended by the
sight of such unwonted fruit on the
trees, or whether the glaring question
mark, which the signs bore, struck too
near home, is not, known. The play is
progressing splendidly despite the
cruel blow.
