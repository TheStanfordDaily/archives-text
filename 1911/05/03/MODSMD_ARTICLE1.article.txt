# MAY INCREASE TUITION TO PAY GYM. EXPENSES
## STUDENTS CONFER WITH DR. JORDAN AND TRUSTEES. University Conferences are Consulted Regarding the Proposed Change. 
### 
An unprecedented occurrence took
place yesterday afternoon when Dr.
Jordan and the Trustees of the Univer
sity called a joint meeting of the Stu
dent Conferences in order to secure
the view-point of the undergraduates
on a proposal to raise the entrance
fees. President Timothy Hopkins of
the Board of Trustees and Treasurer
C. G. Lathrop were present at the
meeting and appeared anxious to grasp
the attitude taken by the students.
The proposition as presented by Dr.
Jordan was that the tuition should be
raised to seventeen dollars and a half
a semester, at the most the additional
amount of two dollars and fifty cents
to be assigned to the gymnasium fund
which would be expended in improv
ing the gymnasium equipment and the
athletic fields at present used for
soccer. The income now at the dis
posal of the directors of Roble and
Encina gymnasiums is scarcely suffi
cient to maintain the equipment in
good condition.
Physical Director Long stated that
less than one-half of the men were
registered for gymnasium work and
tliat the men registered hod to bear
the brunt of the expense in keeping up
the equipment. This, Professor Long
seemed to think, was an injustice
which could be remedied by laying a
tax 011 all members of the University,
whether they used the gymnasium or
not. Tt was intimated that this addi
tional fee would allow sufficient funds
for a movement to enlarge the scope of
gymnasium control, with the eventual
outcome of having all games and fields
under the charge of the Physical In
structor.
The suggestion that the tuition fee
be increased for this purpose did not
meet with much approval from the
members of the two Conferences ami
there was a strong undercurrent of
opinion that the present charges were
large enough. Tt was stated by one of
the speakers, however, that the under
graduates would have no objection to
granting the gymnasium part of the
present fee.
Tn the present state of the University
finances, it would appear to be the only
course left open to those in charge of
the institution to appeal to the stu
dents' pocketbooks to secure funds to
successfully operate the necessary ad
juncts of a great university.
The meeting yesterday afternoon not
only opened a new era in regard to the
consultation of the students concern
ing matters of policy vitally interesting
them, but also was the first time that
the University Conference and the Wo
men's Conference have come together
in a joint meeting.
