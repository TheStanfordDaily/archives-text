Frenchman's Lake, one of Stanford'**
historical and beautiful "show" places
is again being
Rubbish Heaps used as a dump
and Reality Spots iug ground for
bricks and rub
bish. Whether this is the fault of an
individual or the University authori
ties, we call attention to it on general
principles. There are surely plenty of
holes around the campus big enough
to hold earthquake ruins without de
stroying beauty spots.
