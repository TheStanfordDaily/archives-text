# LINDAUER VISITS CAMP OF MEXICAN REVOLUTIONISTS.
## 
### 
That nothing can stop a man with
four years of Stanford behind him was
demonstrated recently by S. A. Lin
dauer, '10, who on April 24 penetrated
the lines of Francisco I. Madero, lead
er of the Mexican rebellion, and se
cured an interview with that gentle
man. The San Francisco Bulletin de
votes two and one-half columns to Lin
dauer's account of his experience.
The courage, patriotism, and gentle
manly qualities of the rebel leader and
his staff made a strong impression on
the Stanford man. The following pas
sage is of interest: "Questioning Ma
dero about himself, I elicited the inter
esting information that he attended
the agricultural department of the
University of California for about
eight months in 1893. On my stating
that I came from the rival university,
Stanford, he laughed heartily, and re
plied that he had visited Palo Alto and
remembered well the mission build
ings."
