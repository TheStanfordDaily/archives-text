# DR. JORDAN WRITES FOR SAN FRANCISCO WEEKLY.
## "Argonaut" Contains Article on "Armament Syndicates and War Scares." Roth Also Contributes. 
### 
In the issue of the "Argonaut" for
April 29, President David Starr Jordan
and A. E. Roth, Student Adviser, con
tribute to the column headed "Letters
to the Editor." Dr. Jordan writes on
the subject, "Armament Syndicates
and War Scares," while Roth's letter
is entitled "Concerning College Hood
lumism."
President Jordan shows that the war
talk between the great nations, par
ticularyl England and Germany, and the
United States and Japan, is the result
of conspiracy of the "armament syn
dicates," which could not exist were it
not for the building of Dreadnoughts.
The English policy of maintaining a
navy two and one-tenth times as
large as any other nation's naval arm
ament, and the policy in this country
â€¢of building at least two of the Dread
nought class of ships each year are
the results of the demands of the build
ers of armament. In England the
stock-holders in these concerns are
largely members of famous families or
members of Parliament.
"It is the piling up of useless and
dangerous armament paid for by bor
rowed money which constitutes the
chief menace to the world to-day," said
Dr. Jordan in the article.
Student Adviser Roth denies the
statement made in the "Argonaut" of a
few weeks ago laying the blame for
certain acts of "hoodlumism" on a
Southern Pacific train to Stanford
students. Roth denies that the offend
ers were Stanford men.
