# SEASON TIO [illegible] PLAN WILL BE TR [illegible] SEMESTER
## Five Dollars Will Pay Year's [illegible] ent Body Assessment and Admission to Games and Meets.

Because of the lateness of the se
mester, the Executive Committee has
decided not to submit the season ticket
plan recently considered by it, to the
Associated Students at. this time. It
will, however, propose it 011 Registra
tion Day, August 29, 1911, with the
expectation that it will be favorably
received by the student public. The
plan is outlined here so that it may be
understood by those returning next
college year who may care to take ad
vantage of it. One thousand people
must purchase these tickets in order to
make the plan feasible. As outlined
in a letter by the Graduate Manager,
it is as follows:
"It is proposed for the coming year
to issue non-transferable membership
cards in the Associated Student Body
to be sold at $5.00 each. These cards
will be good for admission to all the
games and meets held on the Stanford
campus in which a Stanford team takes
part under the management of the
Associated Students, excepting Inter
collegiate and Interstate games. They
also take the place of the Student Body

assessment.
"This plan has been adopted and
thoroughly tried at other universities.
Its advantages are obvious.
"First it gives each member the
privilege of attending all games and
meets at less than one-half the aver
age cost for the last two years, besides
paying his Student Body assessment.
The average cost of the twenty-six
games and meets of the past year has
been $8.00 per student. By deducting
the Student Body assessment from the
$5.00 for a season ticket it will be seen
that these twenty-six games will cost
only $2.00 per student.
"Second, it insures larger attendance
at all games and the increased interest
and spirit that naturally result.
"Third, it gives the Association a
definite source of income at a decreas
ed cost, thereby insuring more intelli
gent management.
"Fourth, it means that the many in
stead of the few will carry the burden
of supporting the splendid and ex
pensive system of sport now carried
on."
