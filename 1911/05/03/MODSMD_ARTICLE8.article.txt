# AMBITIOUS PLANS FOR COMING SENIOR PROM
## LIMITS, DECORATIONS AND MUSIC ON QUAD. Distinctive Stanford Affair to be Especially Emphasized this Year by Class of 1911. 
### 
Stanford's great distinctive feature
of Senior Week, the Senior Prom, will
this year return to its old prominence
and realize the ideals of the origina
tors of the event. Such is the inten
tion of Chairman C. E. Newman, '11,
and the other members of the com
mittee in charge, who have numerous
excellent plans for the affair well in
hand. The fact that Stanford is the
only university in the land where a
Prom of this nature is feasible has
been an added inducement to the com
mittee in their efforts to make it par
ticularly unique and pleasing.
The happy company in attendance
at the affair will promenade around
the Innerquadrangle to the music of
the Stanford band, which will render a
carefully arranged program of eigh
teen pieces. Japanese lanterns will
diffuse a soft light over the scene, and
the effectiveness of the decorations
will be further enhanced by the use of
a single color scheme for the whole.
The various sororities and women's
organizations are now making plans
for the booths by which they will be
represented. These booths will this
year be placed within the Quad rather
than under the arches, in order that
they may not be in the least hidden
from view. If present plans are an
indication, the booths will be both
original and beautiful, the schemes of
decoration ranging all the way from
that favored by the American Indian
to the style which comes from far
away Japan.
A neat souvenir program will be
given to all in attendance, to be used
after the fashion of dance programs.
It is emphatically stated by the com
mittee that the affair is not primarily
for Seniors or even for "queeners,"
but is intended for the whole Univer
sity irrespective of age, sex, or prev
ious condition of dryness. The faculty
will be present in force, and President
Jordan will be the guest of honor.
Ample seating capacity will be pro
vided for as large a number as will
attend. There is no admission. Tt is
believed that there will be no lack of
attendance at this affair so typical of
Stanford.
