# The
						Distinctive Feature
## 
### 
In the general preparation being
made by the Class of 1911, we are
glad to see that it intends to restore

the Prom to its original
status in the affairs of
Senior Week. The charm
of the Quadrangle makes
the Promenade the one

distinctive Stanford feature of Senior
Week. Plays, balls, carnivals and re
unions can be held anywhere, but an
outdoor Prom in the heart of a college
campus can only be held under ideal
conditions at Stanford.
The Seniors wish to emphasize that
the Promenade is a University affair.
It is not intended primarily for those
"queening" to Senior Week. In fact
the whole week is a University affair.
There is no reason why all the festivi
ties with the one single exception of
the Ball should not be equally enjoyed
by all, faculty, friends, "queeners" and
"non-queeners." If the students will
cooperate, Senior Week this year will
be a grand reunion of the Stanford
family as it is supposed to be.
