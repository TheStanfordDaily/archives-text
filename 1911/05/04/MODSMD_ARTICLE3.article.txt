Stanford, will not send 11 track team
to the Western Conference meet this
year. The Executive Committee made
this decision after going over the sit
uation thoroly at a meeting last even
ing.
Opposition to the trip of the Cardi
nal athletes to the conference has been
voiced 011 the ground that the benefits
to be derived from representation at
the Minneapolis meeting this year
would not warrant the expense of
sending the team east. Attention also
has been drawn to the l'ect that with
S. H. Bellah, '10, and T. L. Coleman,
'12, disabled, difficulty might be en
countered in choosing a team to com
pete on an equal footing with the
other universities entered in the con
ference.
The Executive Committee also de

cided to sign a new contract with
"Dad" Moulton as trainer, to run three
years, at a salary of $2,000 a year.
This is an increase of $200 a year
over "Dad's" present salary.
The expenses o fthe track team com
peting in the Pacific Athletic Associa
tion meeting also were allowed by the
Executive Committee.
Instructions were given by the com
mittee that a letter of appreciation be
drafted and sent to Coach C. F. Gan
ong, '10, for his services in coaching
the baseball team.
