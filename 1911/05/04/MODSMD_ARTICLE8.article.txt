# FINAL NUMBER OF SEQUOIA HAS STRONG STORY BY BLIVEN.
## May Issue Contains Good Fiction. Robinson Writes on Lime Lighters. 
### 
Another plea for a real University
Commencement, this time by Professor
Pavson .T. Treat, leads the list of con
tents in the last number of the Sequoia
which was issued last evening.
The fiction department is unusually
good this month. "Her Sister in Col
lege," by Pruce Bliven is one of the
strongest stories that has appeared in
the Sequoia since Dora Eckl's "God
Ha' Mercy." "Friends vs. Girl," by L.
D. Summerfield is also an excellent
piece of work.
L. M. Robinson, '12, next year's
editor, writes of the "Limelighter," and
gives an accurate description of his
pernicious activities. The verse this
month is by C. I?. Hammond, '13, M. T.
Pooling, '11, E. ,T. Hopkins, ex-'ll, and
Miss Marjorie Priscoll, '13.
Editor Hill also has a word to say on
the subject of this year's Commence
ment. Tn "The Outside World," he
pleads for a more receptive attitude in
college towards the affairs of the world
at large.
