# TICKETS FOR SENIOR FARCE WILL GO ON SALE MONDAY
## Rehearsals for "Amazons" Are Developing Excellent Work Under Coach Mathieu.â€”Large Seat Sale Expected. 
### 
Never before has so much interest
been shown in a Senior play as is being
displayed over the "Amazons," the
Senior farce for 1911, seats for which
will go on sale next Monday morning
at the Bookstore and at the Stanford
Pharmacy in Palo Alto. Owing to the
fact that the new commencement plan
will bring so many more people to the
campus than have attended other Sen
ior Weeks, the committee in charge of
the production are expecting a crowd
of more than usual size to witness the
performance.
Not only is the interest on the camp
us very strong, but the outside world
is taking notice as well. Numerous
applications have been received by
Chairman Turner for seats. Chief
among these is the announcement of
the Mask and Dagger Society of the
University of California that they
will journey down to see the farce.
Plan Many Rehearsals.
Rehearsals are being held twice a
day by Coach Mathieu, and the entire
production is rapidly rounding into
form. The business introduced by
Coach Mathieu, is full of brilliant
points and humorous situations. The
author, Sir A. W. Pinero, the well
known playwrite, has made of the play
one of the cleanest, snappiest and
cleverest farces of modern times. The
situations, with only the bare business
indicated by the author, are scream
ingly funny. When the additional bus
iness developed in rehearsals is added,
they are convulsing.
Already the work of the principals
is showing a finish that would do
credit to many a professional perform
ance. As the three lioydenish girls,
who have been raised as boys by their
mother, Miss H. Hill, '11. Miss F. Metz
ner, *11, and Miss R. Benjamin, '13,
are doing excellent work. Miss Hill,

in the difficult leading part has drop
ped into the masculine manners of
Lady Thomasin Belturbet with rare
ease. For a truly masculine air, Miss
Benjamin has achieved the best re
sult so far, among the three girls, al
though her part as a part, is not so
difficult. Miss M. Cleveland, in the
role of the "Eccentric" Lady Castle-
Jordan, is making the most of a rather
difficult and somewhat unpleasant
part. Her work is sure to make a hit.
Among the men J. Beman, '12, in the
comedy role, of Lord Tweenwayes, is
at present doing the most finished
work. His part, the biggest real com
edy note in the entire play, is one
continual laugh as it stands in the
book. Beman has added many a fine
touch to the business indicated by the
author. His comedy work is beyond
criticism and will certainly be the hit
of the play.
Seward lias Straight Lead.
R. H. Seward, '12, in the leading
role of Lord Litterley, will appear in a
new guise for this production. This
will be Seward's first atetmpt since
entering the field of Stanford dramat
ics, to play a straight .lead. The part
as written by Pinero is a simple,
straightforward one.
E. C. Mathias, '11, is creating a dis
tinct character in the other comedy
role of de Grival, the French fop, who
attempts to assume English manner
isms. Some of de Grival's funniest
lines are those in which he tries to
use well-known proverbs, and gets
them hopelessly tangled. H. G. Fer
guson, '11, is also doing well in the
part of the Rev. Minchin.
The pictures of the play which were
posted on the Quad this noon have
caused considerable comment. They
are among the best that have ever
been taken of a local production.
