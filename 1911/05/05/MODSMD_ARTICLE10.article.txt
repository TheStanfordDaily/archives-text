# CHOIR AND ORCHESTRA CONCERT WELL RENDERED
## GOUNOD'S "GALLIA" SUNG BY LOCAL TALENT. Pasmore Quartette Please With "A Half Hour With Brahms." 
### 
An audience that taxed to the ut
most the capacity of the Chapel,
greeted the University Choirs and Or
chestra at their annual concert last
evening. Moreover, those who were
present had good reason for the en
thusiastic applause with which each
succeeding number of the program was
received.
Chief credit for the excellence of the
evening's recital is due Mr. Buehrer,
who had charge of the arrangements
for the evening and whose persever
ance and ability in instruction are
largely responsible for the finished
choral work of the student vocalists
and players.
The second part of the program was
rendered by the Pasmore Quartette of
San Francisco, under the direction of
Mr. H. B. Pasmore, and those of the
audience who are familiar with the
work of this organization agreed that
the quality of last evening's perform
ance was in nowise inferior to their
usual fine standard. "A Half Hour
with Brahms," was the title of this
portion o fthe concert and in it were
given a series of pieces selected from
the wo;ks of the famous German com
poser.
The choirs and orchestra were
equally successful In Buck's "Hymn to
Music," and the three selections from
Gounod's "Gallia," while the "March
Nuptiale," of Papini as interpreted by
the piano, organ, and strings suffered
nothing in comparison with the vocal
numbers. Mrs. Bibby-Brown of Palo
Alto, who was the soloist in the "Gal
lia" excerpts, sang with all the feel
ing and sweetness for which her
work is known. The solo parts were
somewhat marred, however, by the
forte intrusion of the piano accom
paniment.
The pastoral selections which form
ed the larger portion of the "Half
Hour with Brahms," were all voiced
trippingly and with unalloyed success
by the members of the Pasmore Quar
tette.
If particular pleasure were derived
from the efforts of any individual,
Mrs. Mora must be mentioned, with
Miss Reusch and Mr. Herold, whose
tenior of the highest quality.
