E. P. Bly, '13, who won the title last
year, was forced to withdraw from the
competition early in the evening ow
ing to a bad ankle. In the events in
which he took part, however, ho
proved himself a wonderful gymnast,
scoring forty-nine points out a pos
sible fifty.
The contest was held on five pieces
of apparatus, the horse, parallel bars,
rings, horizontal bar, and mats. Each
entry performed two exercises of his
own choosing on each of the five
pieces. Prof. R. R. Long and Instruc
tor H. W. Maloney acted as judges and
marked on a basis of ten points perfect
for each feat.
The winner showed remarkable pro
ficiency on all the apparatus, but on
the horizontal bar in particular, where
he executed the "giant swing" in per
fect form.
Burris, who made the second high
est score performed some daring exer
cises. Holeman was not far be
hind the two leaders in excellency,
showing up especially well on the hor
izontal bar.
J. H. Wiggins, '10, hurt his shoulder
on the ninth feat and could not finish
the tournament. His score of 77J4 fÂ° r
the nine exercises is a very good
record.
After the competition, the gymnas
ium club elected G. S. Holeman, '12,
president and A. F. Burris, '14, secre
tary for next semester.
