We note with regret that the Board
of Trustees did not take favorable ac
tion on the eating club problem at its
last meet ing.
God Versus the Aside from an
Finance Committee isolation hospi
tal, we know of
nothing that Stanford students are
more in need of than better eating ac
commodations. We have not publical
ly advocated the establishment of
these institutions for obvious reasons
which we have pointed out before.
It seems, however, that our silence
has been of no avail. A hospital and
eating clubs are as far off as they ever
were. Once again onr wishes have
been disregarded.
Luckily for us, however; the camp
us has not been visited by the annual
second semester epidemic this year.
Possibly an all-wise Providence has a
more kindly appreciation of our dan
gerous plight than the Finance Com
mittee. For this, we as His children,
are very, very thankful. Yet good for
tune cannot always be with us. Small
pox and diptheria are not strangers at
Stanford. These dread diseases can
easily invade our unprotected campus
at any time. Our prayer is that there
will not have to be martyrs to a cause
in an American University.
