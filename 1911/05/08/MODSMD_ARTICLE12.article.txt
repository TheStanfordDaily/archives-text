# MRS. CHOLE LESLEY STARKS EXHIBITS ORIGINAL PAINTINGS.
## 
### 
Several excellent water color pair,
ings by Mrs. Chole Lesley Starks of the
Graphic Art department will be on ex
hibition in the Old Studio every day
this week from 1:30 to 5 p.m.
The work was done during the vaca
tions of the artist in Pacific Grove and
vicinity and on Puget Sound. A few
paintings of particular local interest
are also shown, including some charm
ing vistas of the Stanford Quad. The
Pacific Grove series splendidly por
trays the yellow sand dimes and dis
tant blue water, with the pines and
cypresses so characteristic of Monte
rey Hay.
Among the views of Puget Sound, a
delicate reflection in a stretch of blue
water is especially charming. A scene
showing a warehouse and wharf re
flected in the water is delicately
treated.
