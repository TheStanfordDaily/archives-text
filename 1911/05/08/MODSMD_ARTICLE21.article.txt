# NOTED JEWISH DIVINE DELIVERS EARNEST SERMON.
## Rabbi Kaplain Preaches on Peaceful Relationship of Science and Religion. 
### 
Rabbi Kaplain of the Bush Street
Temple 111 San Francisco preached an
unusually impressive sermon at yes
terday's service. He chose as his
topic the present day relationship be
tween science and religion. Contrast
ing the strife and conflict of former,
years with the peace existing today
between these two, he showed that,
as warfare had resulted from lack of
understanding, so today's peace came
from mutual understanding, mutual
appreciation, and mutual recognition
of each other's services.
He then discriminated between the
differing functions of science and re
ligion, saying that as the one ministers
to the body and material wants, so the
other ministers to the soul and spirit
ual needs. He said that science re
gards man in a cold objective way,
while religion looks upon him with the
affection of a mother; that science
goads on to greater activities, while
religion suppresses passions and am
bitions, for man's good; that science
merely analysis, while religion warns,
beginning where science leaves off to
look for the good in everything and
everybody and utilize it for the glory
of God..
He closed by saying that science and
religion are the two pillars- of cloud
and fire which are today leading hu
manity on its march thru the wilder
ness toward the promised land, that is
bounded on the north by perfect jus
tice; on the south by brotherly love;
on the east by faith and hope; and 011
the west by peace and plenty.
The music for the morning was ex
ceptionally effective as the choir was
assisted by the orchestra, and Mr. N.
Joullin gave a beautiful violin solo.
