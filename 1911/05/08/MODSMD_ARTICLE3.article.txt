# TRUSTEES REFUSE AID TO EATING CLUB PLAN
## BOARD IS UNABLE TO FINANCE PROPOSITION. Hotel Syndicate Buys Old Stanford Estate in Sam Francisco for Quarter Million. 
### 
After an exhaustive study of the re
port of the Advisory Board of the
Alumni Association on the matter of
eating clubs, the Board of Trustees,
decided at their last meeting, that they
could not see their way clear for the
financing of the proposition, it was
deemed unadvisable by the Trustees to
advance money for the financing of the
scheme at this time. It was decided,
however, that the University would
lease lands in the vicinity of Encina,
for the purpose of erecting eating
clubs at a nominal rental.
The resolution passed by the Board
is as follows:
"It was resolved that, after an ex
haustive consideration of the report of
the Advisory Board of the Alumni As
sociation recommending certain pro
visions for eating clubs at the Univer
sity, and as the Finance Committee
cannot see their way clear to advise
the investment of any funds in the
construction of buildings for such
clubs, that the report be received and
placed on file, but that the Board
lease lands for such a purpose at a
nominal rental."
Another event of importance was the
announcement of the sale of the old
Stanford estate in San Francisco to a
hotel syndicate for a quarter of a mil
lion dollars. The property is situated
on Nob Hill and is one of the best
pieces of property for hotel purposes
in that portion of the city. The syndi
cate which has acquired the property
plans to construct a palatial hostelry.
The historic Stanford Mansion will be
razed in order to make room for tha
newer structure.
