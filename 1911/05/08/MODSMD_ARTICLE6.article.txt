The Panama Terrific Exhibition was
opened in a terrific manner this morn
ing by six "celebrities," including rep
resentative athletes, literary lights,
statesmen, a college "Prexette," and
others. The occasion was a Skull and
Snakes initiation, and the candidates
indulged in the usual foolishness of a
frequently mentioned variety. At 9:15
the six men made their appearance in
humorous costumes on the Quad. At
10:15 occurred Olympian Games such
as were never seen on sea or land; at
11:15 the canal was formally opened
and a full-rigged ship, christianed with
Stanford's Best, sailed down it before a
gale of oratory. The Grand Finale
took place on the Post-office steps at
12:15, and consisted of speeches, songs
and dances. The six initiates to the
society were K. S. Jordan, '10, C. C.
Taylor, *11, R'. S. Worthington, '12, J.
W. Howell, '12, J. B. Woolley, '12, and
E. P. Kern, '13.
