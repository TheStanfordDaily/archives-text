## Academic Council Accepts Recommendation of Athletic Committee. Freshmen Still Eligible For Varsity Teams. 
### 
At one blow the University author
ities have abolished the Freshman
Meet, and these events will 110 longer
be a portion of the year's athletic
program. This was decided at a meet
ing of the Faculty Committee on Ath
letics which met on May 2, and took
definite action 011 the subject. Yester
day Dr. Jordan sent a communication
to the Executive Committee of the
Student Body announcing this action,
and asking that affairs be arranged
accordingly. Dr. Jordan's letter is as
follows:
Stanford I niversity, Cal.,
May 8, 15M1.
Mr. George A. Ditz,
President of the student Body,
Stanford University, California.
Dear Sir,
The authorities the University
acting through the Commltteee 011
Athletics have decided to abolish the
Freshman Kugby (ianie with the 1 ni
versity of California and the Freshman
Meet with the same university.
Kindly arrange the affairs of the
Student Ilody in accordance with this
action of the Athletic Committee,
representing the President and Aca
demic Council of the University.
Very truly yours,
DAVID STARK JOKDAX.
The reasons for this action were
carefully explained in a report pre
pared by the Committee on Athletics
to supplement the report of President
Ditz of the Student Body on the condi
tion of athletics at Stanford. This
report said in part:
Lclaud Stanford Junior University
Committee on Athletics.
Stanford University, Cal.,
May 8, 1011.
Pres. D. S. Jordan,
Stanford University, Cal.
Dear Sir,
The Faculty Athletic Committee at
a meeting held May '2d. voted unani
mously that the California-Stanford
Freshman football game and track
meets he discontinued. .The chief
reasons for taking this step are the
undue and disturbing proportions that
these events have assumed during late
years, together with the consequent
publicity which the Committee feels
is an influence by no means beneficial
to a young student in his first year
of College life.
Accompanying this statement, Sir,
is a communication 011 the general
subject of intercollegiate athletics at
Stanford from the President of the
Student Body approved by the Uni
versity Conference and the Executive
Committee of the Associated Students.
This communication, which is a fair
and well-reasoned discussion of the
subject, the Committee desires to
supplement with a few considerations
rather In the way of emphasis than
of criticism.

This action comes as the final result
of the action taken at the beginning
of this semester and reported in the
Daily Palo Alto for January 30. At
that time Dr. Jordan in a letter to Dr.
Angell recommended that the Fresh
men be excluded from all intercollegi
ate contests, including the Varsity
contests. The Academic Council
approved the action of the President
at that time and reported favorably
011 his suggestions.
It was expected that the Academic
Council, at a meeting held today,
would take some action on the com
plete report, including that portion of
the January report referring to Fresh
man participation in Varsity contests.
The Council, however, after listening
to thi report of the Athletic Com
mittee as read by Dr. Angell, raised
110 objection to its statements and thus
struck the two main Freshman con
tests from the athletic program.
Freshman crew does not come under
the ruling of the Council. The reason
for this action lies in the fact that the
Athletic Committee and the Council
believe that the crew does not offer
the distracting elements that accom
pany the other two sports.
The Council took no action in regard
to the competition of Freshman in
Varsity contests. When interviewed
011 this subject today Dr. Jordan said:
"The Academic Council will not
meet again this year except for the
granting of degrees. In all probabil
ity 110 action on Freshman eligibility
for Varsity contests will be taken
before next Christmas, if then. At
that time, if the matter is brought up
at all, the question of paid coaches,
and of general Freshman eligibility
will be considered."
As can be seen from the quotation
given above from the report of the
Athletic Committee, the reasons ad
vanced for the abolition of the Fresh
man contests are the same as those
announced by the Committee after the
report in January. At that time it
was stated that the Freshman games,
as such, cause too mucfi distraction
for their relative importance. It was
further advanced as an argument that
in the first year students should devote
more time to studies and general
collegiate work than to athletics.
The complete arguments on both
sides were discussed in the issue of
the Daily Palo Alto mentioned above.
What action will be taken by Cali
fornia over the matter has not been
'earned. With the withdrawal of
contests they will obviously be strick
en from the calendar as far as Cali
fornia Is concerned. If the Freshmen
are further excluded from competition
in Varsity contests at the fall meeting
of the Council, and California refuses

to take similar action, It, will, accord
ing to the opinion of those in touch
with affairs between the two univer
sities, mean the total abolition of all
Varsity contests.

action of the Athletic Committee,
representing the President and Aca
demic Council of the University.
Very truly yours,
DAVID STARK JOKDAX.
The reasons for this action were
carefully explained in a report pre
pared by the Committee on Athletics
to supplement the report of President
Ditz of the Student Body on the condi
tion of athletics at Stanford. This
report said in part:
Lclaud Stanford Junior University
Committee on Athletics.
Stanford University, Cal.,
May 8, 1011.
Pres. D. S. Jordan,
Stanford University, Cal.
Dear Sir,
The Faculty Athletic Committee at
a meeting held May '2d. voted unani
mously that the California-Stanford
Freshman football game and track
meets he discontinued. .The chief
reasons for taking this step are the
undue and disturbing proportions that
these events have assumed during late
years, together with the consequent
publicity which the Committee feels
is an influence by no means beneficial
to a young student in his first year
of College life.
Accompanying this statement, Sir,
is a communication 011 the general
subject of intercollegiate athletics at
Stanford from the President of the
Student Body approved by the Uni
versity Conference and the Executive
Committee of the Associated Students.
This communication, which is a fair
and well-reasoned discussion of the
subject, the Committee desires to
supplement with a few considerations
rather In the way of emphasis than
of criticism.

This action comes as the final result
of the action taken at the beginning
of this semester and reported in the
Daily Palo Alto for January 30. At
that time Dr. Jordan in a letter to Dr.
Angell recommended that the Fresh
men be excluded from all intercollegi
ate contests, including the Varsity
contests. The Academic Council
approved the action of the President
at that time and reported favorably
011 his suggestions.
It was expected that the Academic
Council, at a meeting held today,
would take some action on the com
plete report, including that portion of
the January report referring to Fresh
man participation in Varsity contests.
The Council, however, after listening
to thi report of the Athletic Com
mittee as read by Dr. Angell, raised
110 objection to its statements and thus
struck the two main Freshman con
tests from the athletic program.
Freshman crew does not come under
the ruling of the Council. The reason
for this action lies in the fact that the
Athletic Committee and the Council
believe that the crew does not offer
the distracting elements that accom
pany the other two sports.
The Council took no action in regard
to the competition of Freshman in
Varsity contests. When interviewed
011 this subject today Dr. Jordan said:
"The Academic Council will not
meet again this year except for the
granting of degrees. In all probabil
ity 110 action on Freshman eligibility
for Varsity contests will be taken
before next Christmas, if then. At
that time, if the matter is brought up
at all, the question of paid coaches,
and of general Freshman eligibility
will be considered."
As can be seen from the quotation
given above from the report of the
Athletic Committee, the reasons ad
vanced for the abolition of the Fresh
man contests are the same as those
announced by the Committee after the
report in January. At that time it
was stated that the Freshman games,
as such, cause too mucfi distraction
for their relative importance. It was
further advanced as an argument that
in the first year students should devote
more time to studies and general
collegiate work than to athletics.
The complete arguments on both
sides were discussed in the issue of
the Daily Palo Alto mentioned above.
What action will be taken by Cali
fornia over the matter has not been
'earned. With the withdrawal of
contests they will obviously be strick
en from the calendar as far as Cali
fornia Is concerned. If the Freshmen
are further excluded from competition
in Varsity contests at the fall meeting
of the Council, and California refuses

to take similar action, It, will, accord
ing to the opinion of those in touch
with affairs between the two univer
sities, mean the total abolition of all
Varsity contests.
At one blow the University author
ities have abolished the Freshman
Meet, and these events will 110 longer
be a portion of the year's athletic
program. This was decided at a meet
ing of the Faculty Committee on Ath
letics which met on May 2, and took
definite action 011 the subject. Yester
day Dr. Jordan sent a communication
to the Executive Committee of the
Student Body announcing this action,
and asking that affairs be arranged
accordingly. Dr. Jordan's letter is as
follows:
Stanford I niversity, Cal.,
May 8, 15M1.
Mr. George A. Ditz,
