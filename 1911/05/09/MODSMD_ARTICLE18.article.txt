# CHAPPARRAL COMMENCEMENT NUMBER OUT TOMORROW.
## Final Issue Of College Comic Is One Of Best Magazines Of Year. 
### 
Tomorrow the Commencement nnm
ber of the Chapparal will make its
debut on the Quadrangle, dressed in
green and lavender. The number is
particularly good in every respect, and
is a worthy close of the year's volume.
R. L. Duffus, '10, is the author of the
first page poem, "Graduation," the
best bit of verse that has appeared
in the Chapparal this year. The
"Dilletante" is by Editor Bliven, and
is a delightful piece of work. N. C.
Wilson, '12 . contributes two short
poems, "Parting" and "Your Room
mate Who Goes"; the latter being
especially good. Duffus also an
nounces the results of the Chapparal's
"Worst Joke" contest and the awards
have been worthily bestowed. Wes
Howell's essay on "Commencement"
is both wise and witty.
Editor Rliven's final "Now Thats"
are altogether excellent, and his fare
well cartoon certainly contains no
undue sentimentality,
sentimentality.
"Artis Racheloris," a full page half
tone by H. Park, '11, is one of the best
things in that line since Virgil Bel
low's time. The cartoons are all good,
and come from E. M. Albright, ex-'l2,
Miss L. M. Rible, '10, A. Hill, '13, A. L.
King, '12, J. Duff, '13, Nix Knight, '11,
and Miss Bailey, '14.
The issue will sell for the regular
price and may be purchased on the
Quad at the usual time.
