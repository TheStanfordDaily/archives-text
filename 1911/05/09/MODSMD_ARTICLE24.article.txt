# NOTED THEOLOGIAN TO GIVE ADDRESSES HERE
## DR. A. HARNACK WILL DELIVER MEMORIAL LECTURES. West Fand Speaker for 1913 is World's Leading Authority on Religious Subjects. 
### 
Dr. Adolph Harnack, foremost
authority of the world on theological
subjects, and Professor of that subject
in the University of Berlin, has been
chosen by the Board of Trustees to
deliver the second series of lectures
under the West Memorial Fund. The
lectures will be given in 1913.
Dr. Haruack is known thruout the
world as an author ot' authoritative
works. He is a writer of tremendous
powers and is as prolific as he is
versatile. The list of his printed
works numbers about fifty separate
volumes. As a theologian he is noted
for his broad minded attitude in all
religious topics. He regards Christ
ianity more as a basis upon which to
build a conduct of life, than as a dog
matic system. He is anything but an
orthodox student of theology.
The entire modern school of critical
theology turns around Dr. Harnack as
its leader. Among the younger schol
ars whoce tendencies are more modern
he is regarded as a master. He has
made a speciality of the antenicene
period and is without a doubt the
foremost living authority 011 this sub
ject. Practically all of his important
works have been translated into Eng
lish as well as into the leading tongues
spoken among other Christian peoples.
Dr. Harnack holds advanced degrees
from all the leading Universities of
Europe. He has occupied the chair of
theology in the largest seats of learn
ing in his native land, and is now
professor extraordinarius at Berlin.
He was born at Dorpat in Germany
in 1851. This leaves him a compara
tively young man. From his earliest
studies he took up theology. He had
just graduated from the University of
Dorpat when he was called to take
the chair of theology at one of the
smaller German universities. From
that time his rise has been steady, until
today he stands as the foremost living
theologist of the strictly modern
school.
