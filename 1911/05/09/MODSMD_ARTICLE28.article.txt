That greater interest is being taken
in this year's Senior Week affairs is
proved by the excellent seat sale for
the Senior Farce. At noon today a
sale totalling $462 was reported,
which is considerably better than any
for a senior play in the past. Some
desirable seats, however, may still be
had at the Bookstore and at the Stan
ford Pharmacy in Palo Alto.
