# COAST MEET WILL BE HELD NEXT SATURDAY
## P. A. A. WILL BRING TOGETHER THE BEST ATHLETES. Five Men Will Wear The Cardinal.â€” Several Other Stanford Performers Are Entered. 
### 
Amateur athletes from every part
of the Coast, representing colleges,
preparatory schools, clubs and in
dependent entries, will come together
in the annual meet of the Pacific
Athletic Association, Saturday. This
meet, which will wind up the athletic
activities on the Coast for this season,
will he held on the Berkeley oval at
2:30. The performances made by the
competing athletes Saturday will be
counted as the first tryouts for the
All-American team to go to Stockholm
next Spring.
Five men, Smitherum, Cramer, Wal
lace, Miller and Boulware, will enter
wearing the colors of the Cardinal,
while Campbell, Horine and Taylor
will enter nuattached. Captain Pel
lab is to enter with the Olympics.
Campbell, Bellah, Horine and Taylor
will not enter as representatives of
Stanford, for by doing so they would
forfeit their privilege to enter any
other A. A. U. meet this year with the
Olympic Club or any other organiza
tion.
Smitherum and Campbell will both
cover the century and the furlong in
the coming meet. In the middle dis
tances, Taylor and Wallace will strive
for honors in the quarter, while Cra
mer will again oppose some of the
best men on the Coast in the half.
Bellah, Miller, Boulware and Horine
are out to shut out the other con
testants in the pole vault. Bellah and
Horine should also bid for the first
places in the broad and high jump.
The men have continued training and
are probably in better condition now
than they have been at any time
during the season.
Much depends upon the results of
this meet. It will probably determine
the men who are to represent the
Olympic Club in the A. A. IT. meet for
the American Championship which
is to be held at Pittsburgh on June
30, and will also give the Coast athletes
their first opportunity to prove their
right to places on the All-American
Lee Scott, '10, and "Jumbo" Morris,
'08, will probably both be entered
bearing the Olympic colors. The
fight between Morris and Beeson for
supremacy in the hurdles is looked
forward to with great interest. Altho
Beeson has been accredited with
better time this season, Morris has
shown up more consistently, having
beaten his rival on several occasions.
The dispute in the high jump
between Horine and Beeson will also
be renewed. Having twice tied for
first honors, once at 6 feet. 2 inches,
and once at 6 feet, 3 inches, these men
are likely to lie forced to record-break
ing marks in order to win the event.
