# Today's Action
## 
### 
We believe that with the abolition
of the Freshmen rugby game and
track meet that those who have not
favored Freshman participation in

intercollegiate athletics have
their main objection remov
ed. In not going further and
excluding Freshmen from

Varsity teams they have acted in
accordance with the best interests of
the Stanford Student Body.
If such action is taken in the future,
however, the results will be dire for
Stanford. It will mean the destruction
of the entire intercollegiate system,
which, in the light of the report of
Student Body President Ditz to the
Athletic Committee, the contents of
which should be known to every mem
ber of the Academic Council, would be
absolutely harmful. Looked at from
an unprejudiced and impartial stand
point we believe that intercollegiate
competition is absolutely necessary to
sustain interest in athletics, which
everyone will admit is necessary for
a healthy, spirited Student Body.
In conclusion, on behalf of the Asso
ciated Students, we wish to congratu
late President Ditz for his sane, fair
minded stand on the matter thruout
the entire controversy. He has served
his constituency in the manner of the
true pubic servant.
