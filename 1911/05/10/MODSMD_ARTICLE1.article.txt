### 
At :i Freshman Class meetine this
afternoon, addressed by Student Ad
viser A. E. Kotli, the faculty dietnni
went forth that next year's

Freshmen are not to he tub
bed or hazed in any manner.
Expulsion from the I'liiver*
sity will be (lie penalty for
an infraction of this ruling.
The aiinouncenieiit was not
received with any hi rue de
gree of enthusiasm by the
near-Sophomores who were
present, as it leaves them in
the unfortunate position of
being: unable to revenue
themselves for the tubbings
they received last fall.
Inability to regulate the
practice of indiscriminate
tubbing, and the fear of
serious" accident resulting:
from it, are the reasons
triv<'ii for the curtailment of
this, the hitherto inalienable
ritrht of the Sophomore. The
only tubbing permitted on
the campus will be that in
the fraternity houses under
the supervision of the ti|>-
perelassmen.
