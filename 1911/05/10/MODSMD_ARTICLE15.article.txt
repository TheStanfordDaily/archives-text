# CARNIVAL
## SENIOR PROMENADE WILL BE ORIGINAL AND UNIQUE INNER QUAD WILL BE SCENE OF FESTIVITY. Class of 1911 Promise to Realize Ideals of This Distinctive Stanford Feature. 
### 
Promising to outdo in completeness,
uniqueness and originality similar
previous affairs, the 1911 Senior Prom
committee of which C. E. Newman, '11,
is chairman, has given assurance that
this year's Inner Quadrangle function
will be a festive occasion which will
take first rank among the social events
of the final week. The annual Senior
Promenade is distinctively a Stanford
affair and this is the one University
where such a decided departure from
the customary elaborate indoor func
tion is feasible. The committee in
charge plan to make this year's festiv
ity as near the ideal established by the
originators of the plan as possible.
The Promenade concert will begin
at 8:10 and the music will be furnish
ed by the forty-piece Stanford band
under the leadership of Professor E.
W. Martin. A carefully arranged pro
gram of eighteen selections will serve
to keep the merry-makers in a jocular
mood during the promenade around
the Inner Quadrangle.
The decorative scheme will be of a
cardinal hue. Japanese lanterns are to
be the means of diffusing a mellow
light over the scene.
In order not to hide the beauty of
the booths which the various sorori
ties and women's organizations have
planned, these will be placed within
the Quad rather than under the arches
as heretofore. Much secrecy and
good natured rivalry is being shown
by the organizations which are to be in
charge of the different booths. Many
original and pleasing surprises await
those who will attend this typical
Stanford affair.
President D. S. Jordan and Mrs. Jor
dan are to be the guests of honor.
The entire faculty will also forget
their educational duties for a time and
join the promenaders.
A souvenir program to be used after
the fashion of dance programs will be
given to every person in attendance.
Miss H. Park, Ml, is the designer of
this artistic souvenir. There is to be
no admission charge. Holdovers,
Seniors, Juniors, Sophomores, Fresh
men, queens, queeners, non-queeners,
drys, rough necks and even the com
muters are expected to show their real
Stanford spirit and lend their presence
to this distinctive Stanford function,
made possible only by Stanford's
superior location and climatic advant
ages.
