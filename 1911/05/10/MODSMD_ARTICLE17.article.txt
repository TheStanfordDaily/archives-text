# SPIRIT WILL REIGN
## Senior Week's Big Festival Will Be Most Elaborate Affair in Stanford's History. 
### 
As the plans for Underclassmen Day,
Thursday, May 18, assume completion,
the assurance that it will be the big
gest and most uproarious celebration
that was ever seen at Stanford be
comes a certainty. From the gather
ing of the monster "Peerade" in the
morning till the last Japanese lantern
of the evening's carnival goes out, it
promises to worthily inaugurate what
has long been needed at Stanford, a
real Senior Week.
"Peerade" Will Open.
The day's activities will be open at
10:30 in the morning when the entries
for the big "Peerade"will assemble on
Lasuen street by the D. K. E. house.
Everyone, costumed or not, is request
ed to enter this characteristic Stanford
event. All the classes in the Univer
sity will have elaborate entries, and
the Seniors offer a prize to the class
whose exhibit is the most striking.
The Freshmen seem to be making the
biggest efforts in this event. Groups
from the Hall, the Row, and from Palo
Alto will represent various of the
picturesque occurences of the college
year.
A tally-ho load of Matthew's and
Frank's Varsity Girls will be the main
feature of the Sophomore entry, The
Junior float will be rendolent of fire
and brimstone, as a forerunner of their
evening exhibition. In just what role
the Seniors will appear has not yet
been made public.
Baseball Game in Afternoon.
After the parade has disappeared,
comparative quiet will reign until the
Senior-Faculty baseball game in the
afternoon. This noteworthy event as
well as the morning's parade will be
enlivened by the music of the full
University Band. The tally-ho of Uni
versity girls will be present, but who
they will root for is not known.
It is around the events of the even
ing, however, that the greatest inter
est centers. Illuminated from end to
end with Japanese lenterns, the Row
will be the setting for the evening's
fun. Every conceivable variety of
show,music by the Band, and nickel
dances galore, will allow no one to
escape having a good time.
Varsity Girls at Alpha Phi House
The Sophomore Class seems to be
making the strongest preparations for
the evening. They will hold forth in
the Alpha Phi house with free dancing
all evening. The twenty-two beauti
ful Varsity Girls whose pictures will
appear on the Quad tomorrow, will be
there and a great variety of free shows
will be staged in the house. Clowns
will cavort on the front lawn, tele
grams will be delivered to any of your
friends on the campus, there will be
gypsy fortune telling, and W. C. Por
terflold will essay the difficult task of
gessing weights. E.W. Anderson will
appear as Ki Ki the strong man, and C.
S. Turpin, as female Impersonator will
represent the College Widow with a
partner whose name will not be re

vealed until the last minute.
The whole affair is to be in the na
ture of an at-home extended by the
Sophomore Class to the entire Univer
sity. A. H. Frank, S. L. Mitchell and
J. H. Mathews will act as an introduc
tion committee, and wish it impressed
that everyone, roughs and queeners
alike, will be welcomed and provided
for. In the intervals between the
dances, Ted Cronyn and his glee club
will sing, and two mandolin quartettes
will also furnish music. Refreshments
will be furnished at an ice-cream con
cession in charge of Matthews and
Frank. All of the entertainments are
promised to be of the highest class,
and Professor and Mrs. Krehhiel,Pro
fessor and Mrs. Treat, and Professor
and Mrs. Smith will chaperone the af
fair.
Juniors and Seniors Enter
The Junior exhibit is to be simply
"HELL." Whether it will be paved
with good intentions, or portray Ber
keley is not known, but its sponsors
guarantee that it will be a very realis
tic representation, and promise a
"Hell" of a time to all who visit it.
After the manner of the night police
courts in the cities, the Seniors will
preside over "Lemon Court," where
all offenders against the laws of the
Carnival may be tried as expeditiously
as possible. The Freshmen will pre
sent a show of some kind, but just
what it will be has not yet been fully
decided.
In the Delta Kappa Epsilon, The
Kappa Alpha, the Beta Theta Pi, and
the Kappa Alpha Theta houses, nickel
dances will be in progress all evening.
In the Kappa Sigma house, which is to
bear the name of "The House of Joys,"
vaudeville is to accompany the danc
ing. Phi Kappa Psi will be in charge
of a miniature "Monte Carlo." Brad Lee
still proposes to dodge eggs in the
Deke's concession. The Delta Chi's
will temporarily forsake the law for
fortune telling. The Kappa Alpha's
announce an Artful Dodger, who is
obsessed with the belief that no one
can knock off his high hat with a base
ball. The Betas will run a shooting
gallery, while the S. A.. E's promise an
ingenious arrangement by which an
accurately thrown baseball will release
a spring and drop a man into a tub
of water.
"Eats" for Clubhouse Benefit.
These constitute the main conces
sions that have been granted so far by
Chairman Matthias. All "eats" that
are sold will be under the general di
rection of T. W. Halliday, '10, and the
proceeds will go for the benefit of tlip
Stanford Union and the Women's Club
house funds.
The committee in charge of the big
affair announces that all of the shows
will be of the highest class, and that
nothing verging in the slightest on
vulgarity will be permitted. The affair
is for the whole University, as much
for the women as the men, and noth
ing will be allowed that might tend to
defeat this purpose.
