## STRONG SENIOR NINE TO MEET FACULTY CRACKS WILL SEND THEIR STRONGEST INTO THE FRAY. Whitaker and Jones Will be Opposing Box Artists in Senior-Faculty Game. 
### 
Sandwiched between the Carnival
"Peerade" and the Carnival in the
evening, the Senior-Faculty Baseball
Game at 2:30 on the afternoon of Un
derclassmen Day, Thursday, May 18,
promises to compete with these events
for the star performance of the day.
Not alone for the startling exhibitions
of nifty sphere handling that will be
forthcoming and the opportunity to
see passing and former ball scientists
in action, will the game go down in
history. It will be one of the foremost
informal social functions of the Senior
Week as well.
The Faculty has a very efficient
mound artist in Professor A. C. Whit
aker, of the Department of Economics.
Previous to his advent, on the Stanford
Faculty, Professor Whitaker was not
known as a practicioneer along the
lines of the national game, but since
that time he has built up a twirling
reputation, and has a choice collection
of assorted plate clinging curves. R.
M. Lhaman, Instructor of Anatomy,
will complete the Faculty battery duo.
"Johnny" Jones, '11, will act as the
Senior curvist. Jones is a steady per
former on the mound and should prove
a strong argument for a victory for
1911. St. Johns will be stationed be
hind the plate.

Faculty—Whitaker, pitcher; Lha
man, catcher; Searles, first base; An
gell, second base; Moser, third base;
