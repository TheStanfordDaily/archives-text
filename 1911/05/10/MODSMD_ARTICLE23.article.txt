# Commencement and Ball Will End the Week
## Strong Addresses to be Feature of Impressive and Interesting Graduating Exercises. 
### 
Commencement Exercises. â€”
Tickets for the graduating class,
admitting guests and friends to
the main floor (four tickets for
each member of the class) may be
obtained at the Registrar's Office
on Thursday and Friday, May 18
and 19. These tickets will not be
held after 5 p.m. Friday.
All members of the graduating
class (first and second degrees)
will meet in the Chapel at 10 a.m.
sharp, on Monday morning.

Fitting and impressive ceremonies
will mark the passage of the Class of
1911 from the world of college life to
the world of real and strenuous life.
Monday, May 22, is the date set for
Stanford's twentieth annual Com
mencement, and at that time some two
hundred and sixty members of the
Class of 1911 will don the time-honored
and appropriate cap and gown, and,
after listening to a few parting words
of advice, receive the long-sought-fof
diplomas.
Bishop Charles David Williams of
Michigan will deliver the Commence
ment Address on the fitting topic,
"The New Patriotism and its Appeal
to College Men." Bishop Williams is
said to he a leader not only in the
Episcopal Church but in the fields of
thought and action, and is expected to
give a penetrating and inspiring dis
course of the "Mac Donald type," so
much admired at Stanford.
The address to the Graduating Class,
following immediately upon the con
ferring of the degrees, will be by
President David Starr Jordan. Speak
ing upon "The Use of Time," Doctor
Jordan will have opportunity to give

forth much of his condensed and for
cibly presented wisdom.
At the beginning of the ceremonies,
the procession will advance to the
platform in the following order:
Candidates for the Degree of Bach
elor of Arts, candidates for the De
gree of Master of Arts, candidates for
the Degree of Master of Engineering,
candidates for the Degree of Doctor of
Philosophy, the Faculty of the Uni
versity, the officers of the University,
the speaker and the President of the
University.
It is especially hoped and urged by
those in charge of the Commencement
exercises that all graduates will wear
the gowns and take their places on the
platform during the exercises. The
absence of a candidate from the plat
form detracts from the impressiveness
of the scene and frequently causes an
embarrasing hitch in the proceedings.
The committee in charge also requests
that at the close of the ceremonies the
audience remain seated until the pro
cession has passed from the hall.
The complete and final commence
ment program is as follows:
ORDER OF EXERCISES.
