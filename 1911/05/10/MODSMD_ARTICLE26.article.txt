### 
The committee requests that no
flowers be carried to the ball.

As the final chapter in the col
legiate history of the Class of 1911, the
Senior Ball will be held on the evening
of May 22 at the Hotel Vendome in San
Jose. All details, ideas and plans that
have entered into the policy of the Ball
Committee this year have now been
accepted or shunned. The final ar
rangements have been passed upon,
and 110 change will be considered. The
committee has gone the limit in an
endeavor to make this dance the
crowning affair of its kind that has
ever been attended by a college set.
In selecting the Vendome as the set
ting for the ball the committee has
followed a precedent inaugurated
years ago when the University was in
its infancy, and which was returned to
by the last graduating class. From
the first until the last dance there will
be a continuous succession of pleas
ures and surprises for the people in
attendance. The hotel management is
cooperating to make the affair the
biggest success of their many under
takings and the d'incers are promised
some startling surprises during the
evening. The grounds surrounding
the hotel are a veritable park contain
ing many secluded corners and it is
safe to say there will be as many
promenaders as dancers.
The Vendome ball-room in which
the dancing will take place will be
elaborately decorated in an attractive
manner. A sumptuous repast served
in the incomparable Vendome style is
promised for about the middle of the
evening.
The music for the eighteen dances
and for supper, which will come as
an extra, will be furnished by the
Campus orchestra with J. L. McDon
ald, '14, as leader. The list of music
approved consists of Junior Opera se

lections and well known popular songs
and waltzes. The following will be
heard: "Blue Danube," Yale Boola,"
"My Hero," "Sugar Moon," "Dollar
Princess," "Dublin Rag," "Merry Wid
ow," "Kiss Me," "I Love a Co-ed,"
"Chicken Reel," "Enchantress," "Rag
time Rapsody," "Message of the Red,
Red, Rose,""Old Gray Bonnet," "Mad
ame Sherry Waltzes," "All That | Ask
is Love," "One, Two, Three, Four,"
and "Love Tales of Hoffman."
The programs are a decided innova
tion and have been designed by Cram
er and Ostrander, the Palo Alto sta
tioners. They may oh obtained in
about one week from the following
men: P. L. Guerena, '11, T. C. Dye,

As the final chapter in the col
legiate history of the Class of 1911, the
Senior Ball will be held on the evening
of May 22 at the Hotel Vendome in San
Jose. All details, ideas and plans that
have entered into the policy of the Ball
Committee this year have now been
accepted or shunned. The final ar
rangements have been passed upon,
and 110 change will be considered. The
committee has gone the limit in an
endeavor to make this dance the
crowning affair of its kind that has
ever been attended by a college set.
In selecting the Vendome as the set
ting for the ball the committee has
followed a precedent inaugurated
years ago when the University was in
its infancy, and which was returned to
by the last graduating class. From
the first until the last dance there will
be a continuous succession of pleas
ures and surprises for the people in
attendance. The hotel management is
cooperating to make the affair the
biggest success of their many under
takings and the d'incers are promised
some startling surprises during the
evening. The grounds surrounding
the hotel are a veritable park contain
ing many secluded corners and it is
safe to say there will be as many
promenaders as dancers.
The Vendome ball-room in which
the dancing will take place will be
elaborately decorated in an attractive
manner. A sumptuous repast served
in the incomparable Vendome style is
promised for about the middle of the
evening.
The music for the eighteen dances
and for supper, which will come as
an extra, will be furnished by the
Campus orchestra with J. L. McDon
ald, '14, as leader. The list of music
approved consists of Junior Opera se

lections and well known popular songs
and waltzes. The following will be

"My Hero," "Sugar Moon," "Dollar
Princess," "Dublin Rag," "Merry Wid
ow," "Kiss Me," "I Love a Co-ed,"

time Rapsody," "Message of the Red,
Red, Rose,""Old Gray Bonnet," "Mad
ame Sherry Waltzes," "All That | Ask
is Love," "One, Two, Three, Four,"
and "Love Tales of Hoffman."
The programs are a decided innova
tion and have been designed by Cram
er and Ostrander, the Palo Alto sta
tioners. They may oh obtained in
about one week from the following
men: P. L. Guerena, '11, T. C. Dye,
