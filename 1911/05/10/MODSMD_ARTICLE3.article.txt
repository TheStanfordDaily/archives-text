# SENIOR WEEK PREPARATIONS COMPLETE
## BRILLIANT FARCE IS SURE TO PLEASE POST-EX CROWD Final Rehearsals of Play Show Good Work. "The Amazons" A Screaming Comedy. 
### 
Final work on the Senior Farce,
"The Amazons," which will he pre
sented in ihe Assembly Hall on the
evening of May 17, the closing night
of final examinations, is progressing

nicely under the direction of Coach
Mathieu.
That the play will rank among the
best of the many good Senior Farces
which have been given here is a fore
gone conclusion, to anyone who wit
nesses the excellent work of the entire
cast at rehearsals. The essentially
comic nature of the entire work has
been grasped by all, even down to the
minor characters, and as a result each
scene is tremendously effective, and
excruciatingly funny. Never within
the last few years has any play given
here possessed the comedy elements
that are found in"The Amazons."
The original pivotal situation is one
that only a master of dramatic form
such as the author, Sir A. W. Pinero,
could conceive and utilize. The play
deals with the adventures of three
sisters, the "Amazons," who have been
raised hy their mother to ride, box,
fence, and hunt, and even to dress in
masculine attire. The reason for this

peculiar state of affairs is that the
parents of the sisters always desired
k son and heir. At the continued fail
ure of such a person to appear, they
do the next best thing. They raise

• their daughters as boys. Secluded in
| the park of the family estate, t lie sis
ters have never known any man ex
| cept the old servants. All leave at the
| same time for house parties. Each
meets a man during her absence and
each is followed into the sacred pre
j cincts of the family park by the man
she has met. Two of these men are
ludicrous characters who make the
fun for the entire play. The third is
the hero—athletic and entirely de
j sirable. The play deals with the ad
ventures of the three suitors —only one
of whom is successful with the three
sisters and their eccentric mother.
There is scarcely a minute of the
entire action in which the audience
will not find more than one oppor
tunity to laugh. The peculiar con
tortions of the French noble and the
English lord fill the entire play with
merriment. Particularly is this true
in the last act where the set represents
a gymnasium. The antics of the two

paratus will keep the audience howl
ing with laughter. It is planned in
