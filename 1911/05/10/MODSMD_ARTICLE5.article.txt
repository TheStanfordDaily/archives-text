# BASKET SUPPER AT LAKE TO OPEN SENIOR WEEK
## INFORMAL AFFAIR NEXT WEDNESDAY EVENING AT 5:15. Everyone to Bring Lunch.â€”Punch and Cake Will be Served in Boat House. 
### 
Senior Week with all its gay festivi-
ties, its impressive ceremonies, and
its significant exercises will be opened
in a very informal way next Wednes
day evening at 5:15 on the green
shores of Lake Lagunita where the
Seniors will gather for their last
"feed" together. All members of the
class are expected to be present with
a basket of lunch. Punch and cake
will be served in the women's boat
house.
Like many of the other features of
this year's final week, this supper is
a new addition to the usual run of
events during Commencement time.
The committee in charge promise that
it will be so successful that like the
evening exercises on the lake to open
Junior Week, it will take a permanent
place on future programs.
