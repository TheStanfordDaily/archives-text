# THE 						NEW PATRIOTISM AND ITS APPEAL TO THE COLLEGE GRADUATE.
## 
### 
"Americans are nothing if not patri
otic. A passionate and utterly con
fident patriotism has always been the
most salient and characteristic note
of our national mind and temper.
Such a patriotism has ever been the
life-blood of our national existence
and the inspiring spirit and motive
power of our great achievements. In
fervor and conviction it has served for
a religion to most of our people and it
is all the religion some of our people
have had.
"But there are two brands of patriot
ism current among us. One I may
style the "old patriotism," for it has
been markedly characteristic of our
past. The other I may call the "new
patriotism," for it is the most hopeful
sign of the new times that are now
upon us, the most promising expres
sion of the new national spirit which
is inspiring us today.
"The shibboleth of the old patriot
ism was "manifest destiny." It was a
more or less unreasoning compound
of a somewhat stupid fatalism, ob
stinate optimism and blind conserva
tism. It was materialistic and un
moral.
The objective of the new patriotism
is the national ideal. It is character
ized by a keen and sensitive consci
ence as to our national sins and a
more or less clear vision of a national
purpose. It is both moral and spirit
ual.
New Patriotism Contrasted
"Perhaps an historical analogy may
serve to bring out this contract be
tween the old and the new patriotism.
One is suggested by the story of
Israel of old. Ancient Israel was also
an intensely patriotic people. And its
patriotism consisted largely in an
over-weening national conceit, a dense
ly confident optimism and a blind fatal
ism which clothed their national con
science as in a triple-plate armor
against any moral appeal.
"That, patriotism was based on two
foundations. First, their national
descent and heredity, "We be the
children of Abraham, the friend of
God" was their stout reliance.
"Very much after this fashion have

we Americans been saying, "We be the
children of the Pilgrim Fathers, we
be the sons and daughters of the
American Revolution. We have in
herited the glorious institutions
which they founded. We are the
chosen people of democracy. We have
therefore a manifest destiny, made
sure in the counsels and predestina
tions of the Almighty.' Empires might
decay and fall, undermined by dry rot
in their foundations. But the democ
racy of America should stand forever,
though the same dry rot was palpably
evident in the substructure of our na
tional life.
Prophets Were Muekrakers
"The prophets who awakened Israel
from its lethargy were the original
"muck-rakers" of history. They were
most uncomfortable folk to have about,
as prophets always are. For they
arouse humanity from their comfort
able lethargy of blind optimism by the
blare of their trumpets and the beat
ing of their tom-toms. And humanity
generally rewards them with curses
and stonings, perhaps with stakes and
crosses at first, but generally ends by
breaking camp and marching forward
another stage 011 the path of progress,
only to settle down again to sleep until
once more aroused.
"It seems to me that we have had an
outburst of this old prophetic spirit in
our American life. It has found utter
ance in pulpit, platform and press,
particularly our periodical press. True
to its ancient genius, it begins with
the appeal to conscience, the passion
ate, penetrative moral appeal which
will not be evaded or put aside. The
moral note is sounded everywhere to
day like a trumpet peal; it is to be
heard even on the stump and in the
halls of Congress. You cannot al
ways today tell a politician from a
preacher. And muck-raking is all the
style.
Evil a Virus of Blood
"The specific evils of political cor
ruption and commercial dishonesty,
the unholy alliance between big busi
ness and legislation, the oppression of
privilege and tyranny of monopoly
which our muck-rakers have been
chiefly engaged in uncovering, root in
a deeper soil. They are the natural
expression of a certain characteristic

national mind and temper which again
are the natural outgrowth of our his
tory the evil effervescence on the sur
face of our body politic and social
which indicate a virus in the blood.
"Our main task is producing wealth,
making money, building up material
prosperity. Indeed prosperity is the
magic word, the wizard's spell which
often charms the American public into
forgetfulness of all else, —religion, jus
tice, righteousness and the common
weal. We worship success.
"There are many consequences
which have flowed from this state of
things. There is the comparative neg
lect of culture in our education. In
our institutions of learning the chief
stress is often laid upon technical
training and little on the humanities
and the cultural courses. There is
among our people a lack of taste and
discernment in the finer things and
little development, of scholarship, lit
erature and art. There is a feebleness
in the social consciousness and con
science and a dimness in the national
ideal, if indeed we have any; a rank
individualism prevails everywhere.
"There is also a characteristic moral
color-blindness among Americans.
We cannot ordinarily distinguish be
tween greatness and bigness. Great
ness can be defined in moral and
spiritual terms only; bigness in purely
material terms.
"We do not so often tliiiik so much
about the quality of the national spirit,
the loftiness of its standards, the fine
ness of its honor, the righteousness
and justice of its dealings with otlier
nations, the wisdom and tenderness
of its laws and customs in their hear
ing ui)on the weak and oppressed. As
a matter of fact in social and protec
tive legislation we are behind every
civilized nation, except perhaps Russia.
(Mir poor ami weak are si ill better off
than those of other nations hut it is
simply because all our natural oppor
tunities and resources have not yet
been seized and closed by monopoly,
lint, they bid fair to become so. And if
they ever are, woe unto our weak and
poor. For there is less consideration
for them under our democracy than
under European imperialism. .Eighty
or ninety per cent of our laws concern
the rights of property or things, only
ten or twenty per cent the rights of

persons or human beings. >Ve have
not yet learned the prophet's standard
of values, —"I will make it man more
precious than fine gold even than the
golden wedge of Ophir.'
"Consequently we have developed a
lop-sided .civilization, like .Ephralm,
4 we are a cake not turned,' luirnt black
on the side of material and individual
development, raw and sodden on the
side of our social and moral develop
ment.
"I put the case strongly as I have
gathered it from many sources. This
indictment may be justly criticised as
overdrawn and out of proportion, but
it is manifestly true of that side of
our national life with which it deals.
And it has been more true of our re
cent past than it is now. For there
is another side, thank God. There are
signs everywhere as we have already
seen, of an awakening public con
science, fuller measure of industrial
justice and a finer humanity in our
civilization. But this is largely the
negative side of the process, the awak
ening of the national conscience. There
is a possitive side also, a new social
consciousness, a new sense of soli
darity and a new vision of the national
ideal. And that, it seems to me, is
the side that needs to be emphasized
and developed just now. What we
need now is not so much more goads
and pricks as wise guidance and di
rection.
Call for College Men
"There is a call for the organization
and development of our higher life as
a people. The establishment of justice
and equality in the industrial world,
the opening of economic opportunity
for the dispossessed, the framing of
new legislation which shall concern
itself chiefly not with the privileges of
the few, as our legislation lias largely
hitherto, but with the rights of the
many, the development of our cities
from mere vast aggregations of popu
lation into true expressions of the
civic ideal, the creation of institutions
and the ministering of ministries
which shall enlarge our general cul
ture and enrich our common life, —
these are some of the causes that, are
pleading on every side.
"But who are answering this call?
Ordinarily the first to offer themselves
are a company of creck-brained re
formers, half-baked enthusiasts and
visionaries, armed with fads and pana
ceas. But I have no word of cheap
denunciation for them. God bless
them; they keep alive the idealism of
our otherwise materialistic people.
But where are the men of knowledge,
power and culture, of ability and train
ing? For the most part they are con
spicious by their absence. They can
not spare time, mind or energy from
the all-absorbing task of making
money to attend to the concerns of
our common life. They are too busy
with business to care for the things
of the Kingdom.
Leaders are Needed
"The paramonut need of today is for
leadership in this new national-wide
movement and it is a call that comes
with especial and imperative force to
those of us who have enjoyed the priv
ileges of culture and education. That
is what education and culture are for;
that is why the state provides them
so liberally in its system of public
schools and universities; that is why
munificent endowments are given to
private institutions, because a democ
racy above all other forms of govern
ment needs leadership and would de
velope her most capable sons for that
leadership.
"It is to our college graduates that
we look naturally for our scholars,
our artists, our social servants, our
statesmen, our prophets in the pulpit
and out of it, our soldiers of the
common good; in a word, for our
seers and leaders. There is the call.
How are you meeting it?
