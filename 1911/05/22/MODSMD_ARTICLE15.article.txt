# THE 						SAVING OF TIME DR. JORDAN'S THEME.
## 
### 
It becomes my duty to send you
forth to your work in the world, with
a bit of advice and a word of confi
dence, that wherever you may find
yourselves you will, as good Stanford
men and women, be happy and hope
ful, effective in your own behalf and
useful to your fellowmen.
And first for the bit of advice.—
The professor in Civil Engineering
in Harvard said to me the other day,
"the best thing I can say to my gradu
ates in Engineering is this, 'Let your
competitors smoke.' "
In other words, if somebody must go
through life carrying a handicap, let
it be the other fellow.
The professor went on to say that, he
did not consider the matter primarily
from the point of view of hygiene or of
good example, but from that of saving
of time. The man who succeeds is
the man who knows how to use time.
Life is a bit short at the best, and it
seems much shorter when you get on
into the middle of it. Its effectiveness
is measured in part by its length. Its
length is measured not by years, but
by that part of it which we use. We
use only that part we spend In sleep,
in training, in play, in effective help
fulness. Smoking does not come under
any of these heads. Smoking is our
disguise for idleness. When a man
smokes, says the professor I have
quoted, he does not realize that he is
idle. He is putting in the time, the
time that he might otherwise use in
some one of the normal purposes of
life. Daudet tells us of certain club
men who meet and "do not think,
neither do they speak—just smoke."
Value of Training Hnlos
One lesson of the college life is the
value of training rules. If a man is
to do his part in a game or a meet he
must have every nerve free from
prejudice. The effect of tobacco is to

trick the nerves. It is a nerve irritant,
and wears the disguise of a narcotic.
But a narcotic is likewise dangerous.
We ought not to be sleepy when awake.
We have the right to sleep when we
have earned it, by nerve exercise which
demands nerve rest. To break the
training rules is to lose the game,
when the game demands accuracy of
sensation and motion, absolute truth
fulness of nerve response.
But the essential purpose of going
to college is to prepare oneself for the
higher games, for the fine play in the
noblest and most difficult of all meets,
the fine art of living. In this game,
one has need of all mental subtelty, of
all virile reserves. Every day, the test
is closer than any athletic game. Every
day, more depends on one's being iti
perfect trim. Every man, sooner or
later, at some time in his life is
brought under training rules. Tf he
is not, he is forced out of the busi
ness. Most usually these rules come
too late. Every enforced lie of the
nervous system makes it harder for it
to tell the truth afterward. Every
strain in accuracy of nerve-response,
makes the mind flabby.
There is an ancient rule of health
which runs in this fashion:
"Rise early, before you are twenty
five, if possible."
Kise Early if Possible
This rule I commend to you. That
you have observed it already is plain
enough. Tf you were not early risers
you would not be here today. Tf you
had not already mastered some of
these precepts, we should not send you
forth with the confidence that today
we are showing. But there are max
ims within maxims.
The secret of early rising is the sav
ing of time. To rise at twenty-five, the
thing to do is to be already thirty old.
Not thirty years old in waste and dis
illusion, like some old young men we
know, but thirty years old through the
saving of time from idleness for
thought and will and achievement.
And in this the waste of smoke is

only one of many kinds of waste, and
the greatest waste of all is the waste
of time. The great achievements of
men have heen for the most part in the
intervals of a busy life. It is an old
saying, that when you want anything
done you must get a busy man to do it.
The man of leisure can not bring his
power together. He may have his
horses, but his hands are not on the
reigns. The years of life are three
score and ten, and we cut off twenty at
one end for training, and nature cuts
off what she pleases at the other. But
any man can make the other forty as
long as he pleases. He can at least get
twice as much time out of them as the
average man does, and effectiveness in
life is proportioned to the square of the
time saved. Momentum is proportion
ed to the square of the velocity. The
velocity is measured by the ground you
get over, by the time you save from
idleness for life.
Waste is Permanent Loss
What is lost in waste must be debuct
ed from our savings. The man who is
thirty years old at twenty In dissipa
tion, despair and illusionment, can
connt his living age at only ten. He
counts ten years of life "and ten of
death, with ten years of childhood to
begin with.
"The gods for labor give us all good
things."
This was part of the philosophy of
the ancient Greeks. They learned it
as a fact of experience long before
Epicharmus first put it into words.
Over and over again each generation
of men tries its own experiments and
comes back to the same unvarying
conclusion. Moreover, we find that
these same gods never give ns any
thing worth having for any other price.
They make loans sometimes, but. theirs
is a high rate of interest. They do not
forget the contract. "By their long
memories the gods are known." By
the gods, the Greeks meant the forces
that lie all about us, the forces that
condition our life. These are our real
ities. The rest is dead matter. Our

knowledge comes from contact with
these ways and forces, onr power de
pends on acting in accord with this
knowledge. In this lies all human pos
sibility. He who knows the truth can
trust all and fear nothing. He who
strikes as the gods strike has the force
of the gods in his blows. He who de
fies them wields a club of air.
It has been a part of your college
training to learn something of the laws
and forces that limit life. To know
where you are and what you can do,
is the first element in the saving of
time. You can rise early when the
time comes for action.
How (lie Strong Work
You will hear men say, "The rich
man must know how the poor man
lives," else humanity can not keep to
gether. But you are poor in gold, I
hope, though rich in the better com
modities of will and hope. So let us say,
"The poor man must know how the
rich man works," not the rich men who
have inherited land and bonds, and
who do not know how to use them be
cause they have not created them.
These gilded paupers are not many in
America, four hundred are they not in
New York, with a few thousand imita
tors, and in San Francisco and else
where in porportion? These do not
count. They are but froth on the hu
man waves and it is not much trouble
for us to carry them. But you must
know how the strong man works, and
if you would be strong you must strug
gle even as he does, and, if may be,
with loftier ideals and more genuine
aspirations.
Your place as Stanford folk will be
among the working men and women.
Your society is a busy society, your
race is a motor race, your nation is a
going concern.
There are other nations of a different
temper, nations where every good and
great work is to be done tomorrow.
Why should we strain ourselves today
when to sit in the shade is so much
pleasanter? Let us do things tomor
row. Tomorrow is time enough. There
comes an endless succession of tomor
row. They have been coming since
eternity. They will surely never fail.
But the land you live in is not the
land of Manana. You may not lose
yourself amidst its flowers and palms
and bananas. You are on the right
way thus far. This we know because
you are here today. If it were not so
you would be here tomorrow. You
would wait for your education, for the
day that never comes. Each of you
has powers and potentialities of his
own, this for one, that for cinotlier.
Success in Life
To make the best of what is in us,
this is success in life. But our duty is
only relative. It goes with the fact of
time. With time enough, any of us
could do anything. With this great
multiplier, it matters little what the
other factor is. Any man could be all
men if he had time enough. With
eternity man becomes as the gods. But
we are not. in business for eternity.
Our days are few, however much we
may stretch them, and, no doubt, as
in Field's Song of the Stanford Red,
"We shall be a long time dead." So
every hour we waste carries away its
toll from our life, as the dropping
water carries away the rock. Every
lost day takes away a bit. or a cubit
from our stature. And so we come
back to our first word again. Let us
be alert, as becomes the Stanford man.
Let us rise early and let us make some
mark in the world — before we are
twenty-five if possible.

There is an ancient rule of health
which runs in this fashion:
"Rise early, before you are twenty
five, if possible."
Kise Early if Possible
This rule I commend to you. That
you have observed it already is plain
enough. Tf you were not early risers
you would not be here today. Tf you
had not already mastered some of
these precepts, we should not send you
forth with the confidence that today
we are showing. But there are max
ims within maxims.
The secret of early rising is the sav
ing of time. To rise at twenty-five, the
thing to do is to be already thirty old.
Not thirty years old in waste and dis
illusion, like some old young men we
know, but thirty years old through the
saving of time from idleness for
thought and will and achievement.
And in this the waste of smoke is

only one of many kinds of waste, and
the greatest waste of all is the waste
of time. The great achievements of
men have heen for the most part in the
intervals of a busy life. It is an old
saying, that when you want anything
done you must get a busy man to do it.
The man of leisure can not bring his
power together. He may have his
horses, but his hands are not on the
reigns. The years of life are three
score and ten, and we cut off twenty at
one end for training, and nature cuts
off what she pleases at the other. But
any man can make the other forty as
long as he pleases. He can at least get
twice as much time out of them as the
average man does, and effectiveness in
life is proportioned to the square of the
time saved. Momentum is proportion
ed to the square of the velocity. The
velocity is measured by the ground you
get over, by the time you save from
idleness for life.
Waste is Permanent Loss
What is lost in waste must be debuct
ed from our savings. The man who is
thirty years old at twenty In dissipa
tion, despair and illusionment, can
connt his living age at only ten. He
counts ten years of life "and ten of
death, with ten years of childhood to
begin with.
"The gods for labor give us all good
things."
This was part of the philosophy of
the ancient Greeks. They learned it
as a fact of experience long before
Epicharmus first put it into words.
Over and over again each generation
of men tries its own experiments and
comes back to the same unvarying
conclusion. Moreover, we find that
these same gods never give ns any
thing worth having for any other price.
They make loans sometimes, but. theirs
is a high rate of interest. They do not
forget the contract. "By their long
memories the gods are known." By
the gods, the Greeks meant the forces
that lie all about us, the forces that
condition our life. These are our real
ities. The rest is dead matter. Our

knowledge comes from contact with
these ways and forces, onr power de
pends on acting in accord with this
knowledge. In this lies all human pos
sibility. He who knows the truth can
trust all and fear nothing. He who
strikes as the gods strike has the force
of the gods in his blows. He who de
fies them wields a club of air.
It has been a part of your college
training to learn something of the laws
and forces that limit life. To know
where you are and what you can do,
is the first element in the saving of
time. You can rise early when the
time comes for action.
How (lie Strong Work
You will hear men say, "The rich
man must know how the poor man
lives," else humanity can not keep to
gether. But you are poor in gold, I
hope, though rich in the better com
modities of will and hope. So let us say,
"The poor man must know how the
rich man works," not the rich men who
have inherited land and bonds, and
who do not know how to use them be
cause they have not created them.
These gilded paupers are not many in
America, four hundred are they not in
New York, with a few thousand imita
tors, and in San Francisco and else
where in porportion? These do not
count. They are but froth on the hu
man waves and it is not much trouble
for us to carry them. But you must
know how the strong man works, and
if you would be strong you must strug
gle even as he does, and, if may be,
with loftier ideals and more genuine
aspirations.
Your place as Stanford folk will be
among the working men and women.
Your society is a busy society, your
race is a motor race, your nation is a
going concern.
There are other nations of a different
temper, nations where every good and
great work is to be done tomorrow.
Why should we strain ourselves today
when to sit in the shade is so much
pleasanter? Let us do things tomor
row. Tomorrow is time enough. There
comes an endless succession of tomor
row. They have been coming since
eternity. They will surely never fail.
But the land you live in is not the
land of Manana. You may not lose
yourself amidst its flowers and palms
and bananas. You are on the right
way thus far. This we know because
you are here today. If it were not so
you would be here tomorrow. You
would wait for your education, for the
day that never comes. Each of you
has powers and potentialities of his
own, this for one, that for cinotlier.
Success in Life
To make the best of what is in us,
this is success in life. But our duty is
only relative. It goes with the fact of
time. With time enough, any of us
could do anything. With this great
multiplier, it matters little what the
other factor is. Any man could be all
men if he had time enough. With
eternity man becomes as the gods. But
we are not. in business for eternity.
Our days are few, however much we
may stretch them, and, no doubt, as
in Field's Song of the Stanford Red,
"We shall be a long time dead." So
every hour we waste carries away its
toll from our life, as the dropping
water carries away the rock. Every
lost day takes away a bit. or a cubit
from our stature. And so we come
back to our first word again. Let us
be alert, as becomes the Stanford man.
Let us rise early and let us make some
mark in the world — before we are
twenty-five if possible.


Portrait of Dr. Jordan 'Presented by Aliinini.
It becomes my duty to send you
forth to your work in the world, with
a bit of advice and a word of confi
dence, that wherever you may find
yourselves you will, as good Stanford
men and women, be happy and hope
ful, effective in your own behalf and
useful to your fellowmen.
And first for the bit of advice.—
The professor in Civil Engineering
in Harvard said to me the other day,
"the best thing I can say to my gradu
ates in Engineering is this, 'Let your
competitors smoke.' "
In other words, if somebody must go
through life carrying a handicap, let
it be the other fellow.
The professor went on to say that, he
did not consider the matter primarily
from the point of view of hygiene or of
good example, but from that of saving
of time. The man who succeeds is
the man who knows how to use time.
Life is a bit short at the best, and it
seems much shorter when you get on
into the middle of it. Its effectiveness
is measured in part by its length. Its
length is measured not by years, but
by that part of it which we use. We
use only that part we spend In sleep,
in training, in play, in effective help
fulness. Smoking does not come under
any of these heads. Smoking is our
disguise for idleness. When a man
smokes, says the professor I have
quoted, he does not realize that he is
idle. He is putting in the time, the
time that he might otherwise use in
some one of the normal purposes of
life. Daudet tells us of certain club
men who meet and "do not think,
neither do they speak—just smoke."
Value of Training Hnlos
One lesson of the college life is the
value of training rules. If a man is
to do his part in a game or a meet he
must have every nerve free from
prejudice. The effect of tobacco is to

trick the nerves. It is a nerve irritant,
and wears the disguise of a narcotic.
But a narcotic is likewise dangerous.
We ought not to be sleepy when awake.
We have the right to sleep when we
have earned it, by nerve exercise which
demands nerve rest. To break the
training rules is to lose the game,
when the game demands accuracy of
sensation and motion, absolute truth
fulness of nerve response.
But the essential purpose of going
to college is to prepare oneself for the
higher games, for the fine play in the
noblest and most difficult of all meets,
the fine art of living. In this game,
one has need of all mental subtelty, of
all virile reserves. Every day, the test
is closer than any athletic game. Every
day, more depends on one's being iti
perfect trim. Every man, sooner or
later, at some time in his life is
brought under training rules. Tf he
is not, he is forced out of the busi
ness. Most usually these rules come
too late. Every enforced lie of the
nervous system makes it harder for it
to tell the truth afterward. Every
strain in accuracy of nerve-response,
makes the mind flabby.
There is an ancient rule of health
which runs in this fashion:
"Rise early, before you are twenty
five, if possible."
Kise Early if Possible
This rule I commend to you. That

trust all and fear nothing. He who
strikes as the gods strike has the force
of the gods in his blows. He who de
fies them wields a club of air.
It has been a part of your college
training to learn something of the laws
and forces that limit life. To know
where you are and what you can do,
is the first element in the saving of
time. You can rise early when the
time comes for action.
How (lie Strong Work
You will hear men say, "The rich
man must know how the poor man
lives," else humanity can not keep to
gether. But you are poor in gold, I
hope, though rich in the better com
modities of will and hope. So let us say,
"The poor man must know how the
rich man works," not the rich men who
have inherited land and bonds, and
who do not know how to use them be
cause they have not created them.
These gilded paupers are not many in
America, four hundred are they not in
New York, with a few thousand imita
tors, and in San Francisco and else
where in porportion? These do not
count. They are but froth on the hu
man waves and it is not much trouble
for us to carry them. But you must
know how the strong man works, and
if you would be strong you must strug
gle even as he does, and, if may be,
with loftier ideals and more genuine
aspirations.
Your place as Stanford folk will be
among the working men and women.
Your society is a busy society, your
race is a motor race, your nation is a
going concern.
There are other nations of a different
temper, nations where every good and
great work is to be done tomorrow.
Why should we strain ourselves today
when to sit in the shade is so much
pleasanter? Let us do things tomor
row. Tomorrow is time enough. There
comes an endless succession of tomor
row. They have been coming since
eternity. They will surely never fail.
But the land you live in is not the
land of Manana. You may not lose
yourself amidst its flowers and palms
and bananas. You are on the right
way thus far. This we know because
you are here today. If it were not so
you would be here tomorrow. You
would wait for your education, for the
day that never comes. Each of you
has powers and potentialities of his
own, this for one, that for cinotlier.
Success in Life
To make the best of what is in us,
this is success in life. But our duty is
only relative. It goes with the fact of
time. With time enough, any of us
could do anything. With this great
multiplier, it matters little what the
other factor is. Any man could be all
men if he had time enough. With
eternity man becomes as the gods. But
we are not. in business for eternity.
Our days are few, however much we
may stretch them, and, no doubt, as
in Field's Song of the Stanford Red,
"We shall be a long time dead." So
every hour we waste carries away its
toll from our life, as the dropping
water carries away the rock. Every
lost day takes away a bit. or a cubit
from our stature. And so we come
back to our first word again. Let us
be alert, as becomes the Stanford man.
Let us rise early and let us make some
mark in the world — before we are
twenty-five if possible.


Portrait of Dr. Jordan 'Presented by Aliinini.
It becomes my duty to send you
forth to your work in the world, with
a bit of advice and a word of confi
dence, that wherever you may find
yourselves you will, as good Stanford
men and women, be happy and hope
ful, effective in your own behalf and
useful to your fellowmen.
And first for the bit of advice.—
The professor in Civil Engineering
in Harvard said to me the other day,
"the best thing I can say to my gradu
ates in Engineering is this, 'Let your
competitors smoke.' "
In other words, if somebody must go
through life carrying a handicap, let
it be the other fellow.
The professor went on to say that, he
did not consider the matter primarily
from the point of view of hygiene or of
good example, but from that of saving
of time. The man who succeeds is
the man who knows how to use time.
Life is a bit short at the best, and it
seems much shorter when you get on
into the middle of it. Its effectiveness
is measured in part by its length. Its
length is measured not by years, but
by that part of it which we use. We
use only that part we spend In sleep,
in training, in play, in effective help
fulness. Smoking does not come under
any of these heads. Smoking is our
disguise for idleness. When a man
smokes, says the professor I have
quoted, he does not realize that he is
idle. He is putting in the time, the
time that he might otherwise use in
some one of the normal purposes of
life. Daudet tells us of certain club
men who meet and "do not think,
neither do they speak—just smoke."
Value of Training Hnlos
One lesson of the college life is the
value of training rules. If a man is
to do his part in a game or a meet he
must have every nerve free from
prejudice. The effect of tobacco is to

trick the nerves. It is a nerve irritant,
and wears the disguise of a narcotic.
But a narcotic is likewise dangerous.
We ought not to be sleepy when awake.
We have the right to sleep when we
have earned it, by nerve exercise which
demands nerve rest. To break the
training rules is to lose the game,
when the game demands accuracy of
sensation and motion, absolute truth
fulness of nerve response.
But the essential purpose of going
to college is to prepare oneself for the
higher games, for the fine play in the
noblest and most difficult of all meets,
the fine art of living. In this game,
one has need of all mental subtelty, of
all virile reserves. Every day, the test
is closer than any athletic game. Every
day, more depends on one's being iti
perfect trim. Every man, sooner or
later, at some time in his life is
brought under training rules. Tf he
is not, he is forced out of the busi
ness. Most usually these rules come
too late. Every enforced lie of the
nervous system makes it harder for it
to tell the truth afterward. Every
strain in accuracy of nerve-response,
makes the mind flabby.
There is an ancient rule of health
which runs in this fashion:
"Rise early, before you are twenty
five, if possible."
Kise Early if Possible
This rule I commend to you. That
you have observed it already is plain
enough. Tf you were not early risers
you would not be here today. Tf you
had not already mastered some of
these precepts, we should not send you
forth with the confidence that today
we are showing. But there are max
ims within maxims.
The secret of early rising is the sav
ing of time. To rise at twenty-five, the
thing to do is to be already thirty old.
Not thirty years old in waste and dis
illusion, like some old young men we
know, but thirty years old through the
saving of time from idleness for
thought and will and achievement.
And in this the waste of smoke is

only one of many kinds of waste, and
the greatest waste of all is the waste
of time. The great achievements of
men have heen for the most part in the
intervals of a busy life. It is an old
saying, that when you want anything
done you must get a busy man to do it.
The man of leisure can not bring his
power together. He may have his
horses, but his hands are not on the
reigns. The years of life are three
score and ten, and we cut off twenty at
one end for training, and nature cuts
off what she pleases at the other. But
any man can make the other forty as
long as he pleases. He can at least get
twice as much time out of them as the
average man does, and effectiveness in
life is proportioned to the square of the
time saved. Momentum is proportion
ed to the square of the velocity. The
velocity is measured by the ground you
get over, by the time you save from
idleness for life.
Waste is Permanent Loss
What is lost in waste must be debuct
ed from our savings. The man who is
thirty years old at twenty In dissipa
tion, despair and illusionment, can
connt his living age at only ten. He
counts ten years of life "and ten of
death, with ten years of childhood to
begin with.
"The gods for labor give us all good
things."
This was part of the philosophy of
the ancient Greeks. They learned it
as a fact of experience long before
Epicharmus first put it into words.
Over and over again each generation
of men tries its own experiments and
comes back to the same unvarying
conclusion. Moreover, we find that
these same gods never give ns any
thing worth having for any other price.
They make loans sometimes, but. theirs
is a high rate of interest. They do not
forget the contract. "By their long
memories the gods are known." By
the gods, the Greeks meant the forces
that lie all about us, the forces that
condition our life. These are our real
ities. The rest is dead matter. Our

knowledge comes from contact with
these ways and forces, onr power de
pends on acting in accord with this
knowledge. In this lies all human pos
sibility. He who knows the truth can
trust all and fear nothing. He who
strikes as the gods strike has the force
of the gods in his blows. He who de
fies them wields a club of air.

every hour we waste carries away its
toll from our life, as the dropping
water carries away the rock. Every
lost day takes away a bit. or a cubit
from our stature. And so we come
back to our first word again. Let us
be alert, as becomes the Stanford man.
Let us rise early and let us make some
mark in the world — before we are
twenty-five if possible.

It becomes my duty to send you
forth to your work in the world, with
a bit of advice and a word of confi
dence, that wherever you may find
yourselves you will, as good Stanford
men and women, be happy and hope
ful, effective in your own behalf and
useful to your fellowmen.
And first for the bit of advice.—
The professor in Civil Engineering
in Harvard said to me the other day,
"the best thing I can say to my gradu
ates in Engineering is this, 'Let your
competitors smoke.' "
In other words, if somebody must go
through life carrying a handicap, let
it be the other fellow.
The professor went on to say that, he
did not consider the matter primarily
from the point of view of hygiene or of
good example, but from that of saving
of time. The man who succeeds is
the man who knows how to use time.
Life is a bit short at the best, and it
seems much shorter when you get on
into the middle of it. Its effectiveness
is measured in part by its length. Its
length is measured not by years, but
by that part of it which we use. We
use only that part we spend In sleep,
in training, in play, in effective help
fulness. Smoking does not come under
any of these heads. Smoking is our
disguise for idleness. When a man
smokes, says the professor I have
quoted, he does not realize that he is
idle. He is putting in the time, the
time that he might otherwise use in
some one of the normal purposes of
life. Daudet tells us of certain club
men who meet and "do not think,
neither do they speak—just smoke."
Value of Training Hnlos
One lesson of the college life is the
value of training rules. If a man is
to do his part in a game or a meet he
must have every nerve free from
prejudice. The effect of tobacco is to

trick the nerves. It is a nerve irritant,
and wears the disguise of a narcotic.
But a narcotic is likewise dangerous.
We ought not to be sleepy when awake.
We have the right to sleep when we
have earned it, by nerve exercise which
demands nerve rest. To break the
training rules is to lose the game,
when the game demands accuracy of
sensation and motion, absolute truth
fulness of nerve response.
But the essential purpose of going
to college is to prepare oneself for the
higher games, for the fine play in the
noblest and most difficult of all meets,
the fine art of living. In this game,
one has need of all mental subtelty, of
all virile reserves. Every day, the test
is closer than any athletic game. Every
day, more depends on one's being iti
perfect trim. Every man, sooner or
later, at some time in his life is
brought under training rules. Tf he
is not, he is forced out of the busi
ness. Most usually these rules come
too late. Every enforced lie of the
nervous system makes it harder for it
to tell the truth afterward. Every
strain in accuracy of nerve-response,
makes the mind flabby.
There is an ancient rule of health
which runs in this fashion:
"Rise early, before you are twenty
five, if possible."
Kise Early if Possible
This rule I commend to you. That
you have observed it already is plain
enough. Tf you were not early risers
you would not be here today. Tf you
had not already mastered some of
these precepts, we should not send you
forth with the confidence that today
we are showing. But there are max
ims within maxims.
The secret of early rising is the sav
ing of time. To rise at twenty-five, the
thing to do is to be already thirty old.
Not thirty years old in waste and dis
illusion, like some old young men we
know, but thirty years old through the
saving of time from idleness for
thought and will and achievement.
And in this the waste of smoke is

only one of many kinds of waste, and
the greatest waste of all is the waste
of time. The great achievements of
men have heen for the most part in the
intervals of a busy life. It is an old
saying, that when you want anything
done you must get a busy man to do it.
The man of leisure can not bring his
power together. He may have his
horses, but his hands are not on the
reigns. The years of life are three
score and ten, and we cut off twenty at
one end for training, and nature cuts
off what she pleases at the other. But
any man can make the other forty as
long as he pleases. He can at least get
twice as much time out of them as the
average man does, and effectiveness in
life is proportioned to the square of the
time saved. Momentum is proportion
ed to the square of the velocity. The
velocity is measured by the ground you
get over, by the time you save from
idleness for life.
Waste is Permanent Loss
What is lost in waste must be debuct
ed from our savings. The man who is
thirty years old at twenty In dissipa
tion, despair and illusionment, can
connt his living age at only ten. He
counts ten years of life "and ten of
death, with ten years of childhood to
begin with.
"The gods for labor give us all good
things."
This was part of the philosophy of
the ancient Greeks. They learned it
as a fact of experience long before
Epicharmus first put it into words.
Over and over again each generation
of men tries its own experiments and
comes back to the same unvarying
conclusion. Moreover, we find that
these same gods never give ns any
thing worth having for any other price.
They make loans sometimes, but. theirs
is a high rate of interest. They do not
forget the contract. "By their long
memories the gods are known." By
the gods, the Greeks meant the forces
that lie all about us, the forces that
condition our life. These are our real
ities. The rest is dead matter. Our

knowledge comes from contact with
these ways and forces, onr power de
pends on acting in accord with this
knowledge. In this lies all human pos
sibility. He who knows the truth can
trust all and fear nothing. He who
strikes as the gods strike has the force
of the gods in his blows. He who de
fies them wields a club of air.
It has been a part of your college
training to learn something of the laws
and forces that limit life. To know
where you are and what you can do,
is the first element in the saving of
time. You can rise early when the
time comes for action.
How (lie Strong Work
You will hear men say, "The rich
man must know how the poor man
lives," else humanity can not keep to
gether. But you are poor in gold, I
hope, though rich in the better com
modities of will and hope. So let us say,
"The poor man must know how the
rich man works," not the rich men who
have inherited land and bonds, and
who do not know how to use them be
cause they have not created them.
These gilded paupers are not many in
America, four hundred are they not in
New York, with a few thousand imita
tors, and in San Francisco and else
where in porportion? These do not
count. They are but froth on the hu
man waves and it is not much trouble
for us to carry them. But you must
know how the strong man works, and
if you would be strong you must strug
gle even as he does, and, if may be,
with loftier ideals and more genuine
aspirations.
Your place as Stanford folk will be
among the working men and women.
Your society is a busy society, your
race is a motor race, your nation is a
going concern.
There are other nations of a different
temper, nations where every good and
great work is to be done tomorrow.
Why should we strain ourselves today
when to sit in the shade is so much
pleasanter? Let us do things tomor
row. Tomorrow is time enough. There
comes an endless succession of tomor
row. They have been coming since
eternity. They will surely never fail.
But the land you live in is not the
land of Manana. You may not lose
yourself amidst its flowers and palms
and bananas. You are on the right
way thus far. This we know because
you are here today. If it were not so
you would be here tomorrow. You
would wait for your education, for the
day that never comes. Each of you
has powers and potentialities of his
own, this for one, that for cinotlier.
Success in Life
To make the best of what is in us,
this is success in life. But our duty is
only relative. It goes with the fact of
time. With time enough, any of us
could do anything. With this great
multiplier, it matters little what the
other factor is. Any man could be all
men if he had time enough. With
eternity man becomes as the gods. But
we are not. in business for eternity.
Our days are few, however much we
may stretch them, and, no doubt, as
in Field's Song of the Stanford Red,
"We shall be a long time dead." So
every hour we waste carries away its
toll from our life, as the dropping
water carries away the rock. Every
lost day takes away a bit. or a cubit
from our stature. And so we come
back to our first word again. Let us
be alert, as becomes the Stanford man.
