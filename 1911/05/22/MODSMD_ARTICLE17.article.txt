# Eleven's Commencement
## 
### 
No one who has "stayed over" for
the 1911 Senior Week has regretted
his action. No one can deny that the

Commencement sea
son is the most de
lightful and inspir
ing of the college

year. Care-free and relaxed from the
responsibility of college activity in
general, and the strain and stress of
"ex" week in particular, the Student
Body has thoroly enjoyed this brief
respite between the hurry and worry
of nine months of campus life and the
recreative and business demands of
three summer months at home. There
can be no doubt but that such a re
spite is positively beneficial and neces
sary from all points of view. The "ex"-
wearied student rushing from his last
test to the station, arrives home in no
fit condition to do justice to himself or
to the University. The woe-begone
condition of some of our law students,
especially, is not one to particularly
inspire the home folks of the ration
ality of a college existence. We be
lieve the examination system as car
ried out by the Law Department to be
an unnatural test of the student's
ability and a burlesque on true schol
arship. A radical change is neces
sary.
1911 in writing its last page of
Stanford history has inscribed deep
its name in Cardinal annals by pro
viding the Senior Week that it has.
Altho the exercises have not received
the support seen in older Eastern Uni
versities, where Commencement is
held in its deserved regard, a great
step in advance has been made. We
predict the time is not far in the future
when Commencement Week at Stan
ford will be as distinctive an event as
such a distinctive University as Stan
ford can make it.
The success the Seniors have at
tained has not been the result of their
individual effort alone, however. Their
best Faculty friends have been untir
ing in their cooperation. 1911 greatly
appreciates this. Especially does it
thank Professors Krehbiel and Treat
for their part in making Senior Week
a University Week.
And now that Eleven is bringing her
existence to an end, she has one Ann I
favor to ask of the University. This
may seem strange in light of what a
benevolent Alma Mater has already
bestowed upon her. However, 1911 is
justly proud of the fact that during
her time she has started a few helpful
traditions in which she is supremely
interested. She asks the favor that
these traditions be kept alive. Tn a
word, her final request is that the
spirit of helpful good fellowship and
whole-hearted democracy now pervad
ing the life of the campus be constant
ly nourished. If the request is ganted,
1911 will feel that her four years on
the Farm have been of some little ser
vice to her Alma Mater.
