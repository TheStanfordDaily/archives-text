We, the Class of 1911 of Lelaiul
Stanford Junior University, of the
State of California, County of Santa

Clara, a duly in
corporated body
under the laws of
the commonwealth,
recognized by the
Student Affa i r s
Committee as suf
flcently sound of
mind and body to
regulate and deter
mine our own time
of departure from

this life, with pangs of sorrow and
spasms of joy in our unconsciousness
of the after life, do hereby declare, de
cree and determine this our last will
and testament, as hereinafter set
forth.
We direct and command that all just
debts, obligations and expenses in
curred by us in the closing days of our
college life be paid and cancelled by
our beneficent and philanthropic Lord
of the Manor, Charles G. Lathrop.
Lest he refuse this trust so confidently
reposed in him, that of paying out
money, and believing this sum might
be put to better advantage by him in
the purchase of an automobile of the
latest design, we decree these personal
expenses of our closing hours be met
by a diploma fee to be collected and
retained as ordained by the Academic
Council.
As a suitable and fitting monument
to the success, the glory and the
achievements of the Class of 1911 we
leave in the memory of the University
the records of its members, entrusting
to the Holdovers in contingent re
mainder dependent upon the length of
their stay over the four score and ten,
the duty of perpetuating our name in
continuous renown. And to the Hold
overs as sole beneficiaries we also
bequeath the right and privilege to the
return of five dollars, once deposited
as beforementioned diploma fee.
Upon the Undergraduates we impose
the obligation to maintain and hold
inviolate the good name and honor of
the University, to love and respect
their professors, to obey and honestly
follow the rules of the University as
layed down and as they know them to
be, but never to hesitate to unflinch
ingly and undauntedly stand for their
rights and liberties as these were
given to them by the Founders of a
democratic institution. We further
entrust to their hands in perpetuity,
to have and hold forever, the Stanford
Spirit, so dear and close to the hearts
of the Class of 1911. This, the richest
and most cherished gift in our power
to bestow, we bequeath with full faith
and belief that in our heirs it will find
able champions and that, it shall
never perish from the old "farm."
The farm and homestead itself we

leave with all its appurtenances to the
able trust and management of the
Class of 1912. Having baptized them
in the tub and reared them by cardinal
rules we leave these precious be
quests with the utmost conlidence that
in the Class of 1912, Nineteen Eleven
will find worthy successors.
To those professors who have given
us human "exams," who have coun
seled us in hours of trouble and who
have treated us as men and women we
leave our confidence and esteem, hop
ing that in succeeding classes they
will find as deep appreciation of their
student interest and kindness.
To the Sophomores we give the right,
title and interest to a pair of corduroy
trousers. Likewise we bequeath the
right and privileges appurtenant to the
Junior plugs hoping they will be in
itiated with all the indignities becom
ing the same and that upon the sum
mit of the Junior's anatomy the blows
of 1912 may find a suitable resting
place.
io the Student Affairs Committee
we grant in trust for next year's Soph
omores, the Class of 1915 with the
firm belief it is a bad plan to elim
inate the clean sport of tubbing, in
addition thereto we bequeath to the
aforesaid committee all the porcelain
tubs in Encina Hall with their con
tents, suggesting that in these recept
acles the Stanford Axe might take its
long-needed bath.
Upon the Class of 1914 we lay the
obligation to punish the unruly Frosh
by two smites upon the wrist thus
causing him great pain and torture in
conformity with the University's policy
of reasonable punishment to the un
fortunate infringer of the rules.
The Bookstore we disinherit and
cut off from all rights to live upon the
Stanford campus. We do, however,
lay upon that abominable institution
the duty and obligation to explain
and prove to the suspecting public
how it can charge twice the normal
retail price and still make no profits.
To "Bennie" Erb we confidently
leave the Rugby Team of 1911 with
our hopes and belief that he will pilot
it triumphantly thru the coming sea
son and that under the efficient
coaching of George Presley, Stanford
will again down the Blue and Gold.
With "Tom" Coleman we leave the
Track Team in trust for a victory in
1912 with the hopes the "Colonel's"
luck may change and that he may
again be able to tear off the laps at
the old time clip.
Gilfillan succeeds to the rights and
honor of leading the baseball men in
a four-forty around the diamond and
with "Gil" in charge we leave to Stan
ford the right to expect a victorious
team.
In the calloused hands of Harry
Seward we leave the oars of the Var
sity shell never doubting but that his
powerful shoulders will once more
pull Stanford ahead of the Blue and
Gold.
The Quadrangle with all its prom
enade advantages are hereby be
queathed to "tough-guy" Martin, the
Class of 1911 agreeing to plead with
the Business Office for sufficient light
ing to protect our Percy from holdups
when queening upon the Quad.
The use of all alleys, back roads,
and such other place of concealment
we leave to Hubbard, the speed
maniac, together with the duty and
obligation to stick to those by-ways,
where he will be better hidden from
the public gaze than at present.
We acknowledge Frank Maeomber
and Ted Higgins as active members of


E. ('. Matthias
the Family Club. We would also sug
gest the Delta Gamma apply for an
honorary membership in their soror
ity for Pat Tallant.
To Ken Lee and his cohorts we
leave all the eats of all the dances to
be given upon the Stanford campus
during the coming year. And to "Cort"
Moore we bequeath the rights and
privileges to one shirt to be worn on
Sundays under his rough-neck sweater.
"Les" Summerfield is left the heav
iest hammer of the University with our
confidence that in him the Chaparral
has found an able leader, student in
terests an enthusiastic champion, and
knockable institutions a powerful op
ponent.
With "Jimmie" Thomas we leave the
Daily Palo Alto knowing full well his
strength and ability already so ably
demonstrated.
Under the leadership of Karl
Schaupp we anticipate another suc
cessful year upon the Stanford Farm
and upon his Herculean shoulders we
place the confidence and hope of the
Student Body.
And now that we have disposed of
our worldly goods, interests, and pos
sessions, we relinquish all claim to
this life, passing into the world where
eternity alone shall determine our
next commencement. The Class of
1911 came In the fall when the sun
kissed hills were smiling 'neath a
coat of tan. We go in the spring when
the green tinted fields and the fra
grant gardens proclaim new life to all.
And so it is with these fond recollec
tions we lay aside our "sombs," break
the ties asunder and stride on to the
distant fields of life where 1911, ever
striving, ever confident, will emblazen
her name forever upon the pages of
history.
Be it so willed.

latest design, we decree these personal
expenses of our closing hours be met
by a diploma fee to be collected and
retained as ordained by the Academic
Council.
As a suitable and fitting monument
to the success, the glory and the
achievements of the Class of 1911 we
leave in the memory of the University
the records of its members, entrusting
to the Holdovers in contingent re
mainder dependent upon the length of
their stay over the four score and ten,
the duty of perpetuating our name in
continuous renown. And to the Hold
overs as sole beneficiaries we also
bequeath the right and privilege to the
return of five dollars, once deposited
as beforementioned diploma fee.
Upon the Undergraduates we impose
the obligation to maintain and hold
inviolate the good name and honor of
the University, to love and respect
their professors, to obey and honestly
follow the rules of the University as
layed down and as they know them to
be, but never to hesitate to unflinch
ingly and undauntedly stand for their
rights and liberties as these were
given to them by the Founders of a
democratic institution. We further
entrust to their hands in perpetuity,
to have and hold forever, the Stanford
Spirit, so dear and close to the hearts
of the Class of 1911. This, the richest
and most cherished gift in our power
to bestow, we bequeath with full faith
and belief that in our heirs it will find
able champions and that, it shall
never perish from the old "farm."
The farm and homestead itself we

leave with all its appurtenances to the
able trust and management of the
Class of 1912. Having baptized them
in the tub and reared them by cardinal
rules we leave these precious be
quests with the utmost conlidence that
in the Class of 1912, Nineteen Eleven
will find worthy successors.
To those professors who have given
us human "exams," who have coun
seled us in hours of trouble and who
have treated us as men and women we
leave our confidence and esteem, hop
ing that in succeeding classes they
will find as deep appreciation of their
student interest and kindness.
To the Sophomores we give the right,
title and interest to a pair of corduroy
trousers. Likewise we bequeath the
right and privileges appurtenant to the
Junior plugs hoping they will be in
itiated with all the indignities becom
ing the same and that upon the sum
mit of the Junior's anatomy the blows
of 1912 may find a suitable resting
place.
io the Student Affairs Committee
we grant in trust for next year's Soph
omores, the Class of 1915 with the
firm belief it is a bad plan to elim
inate the clean sport of tubbing, in
addition thereto we bequeath to the
aforesaid committee all the porcelain
tubs in Encina Hall with their con
tents, suggesting that in these recept
acles the Stanford Axe might take its
long-needed bath.
Upon the Class of 1914 we lay the
obligation to punish the unruly Frosh
by two smites upon the wrist thus
causing him great pain and torture in
conformity with the University's policy
of reasonable punishment to the un
fortunate infringer of the rules.
The Bookstore we disinherit and
cut off from all rights to live upon the
Stanford campus. We do, however,
lay upon that abominable institution
the duty and obligation to explain
and prove to the suspecting public
how it can charge twice the normal
retail price and still make no profits.
To "Bennie" Erb we confidently
leave the Rugby Team of 1911 with
our hopes and belief that he will pilot
it triumphantly thru the coming sea
son and that under the efficient
coaching of George Presley, Stanford
will again down the Blue and Gold.
With "Tom" Coleman we leave the
Track Team in trust for a victory in
1912 with the hopes the "Colonel's"
luck may change and that he may
again be able to tear off the laps at
the old time clip.
Gilfillan succeeds to the rights and
honor of leading the baseball men in
a four-forty around the diamond and
with "Gil" in charge we leave to Stan
ford the right to expect a victorious
team.
In the calloused hands of Harry
Seward we leave the oars of the Var
sity shell never doubting but that his
powerful shoulders will once more
pull Stanford ahead of the Blue and
Gold.
The Quadrangle with all its prom
enade advantages are hereby be
queathed to "tough-guy" Martin, the
Class of 1911 agreeing to plead with
the Business Office for sufficient light
ing to protect our Percy from holdups
when queening upon the Quad.
The use of all alleys, back roads,
and such other place of concealment
we leave to Hubbard, the speed
maniac, together with the duty and
obligation to stick to those by-ways,
where he will be better hidden from
the public gaze than at present.
We acknowledge Frank Maeomber
and Ted Higgins as active members of


E. ('. Matthias
the Family Club. We would also sug
gest the Delta Gamma apply for an
honorary membership in their soror
ity for Pat Tallant.
To Ken Lee and his cohorts we
leave all the eats of all the dances to
be given upon the Stanford campus
during the coming year. And to "Cort"
Moore we bequeath the rights and
privileges to one shirt to be worn on
Sundays under his rough-neck sweater.
"Les" Summerfield is left the heav
iest hammer of the University with our
confidence that in him the Chaparral
has found an able leader, student in
terests an enthusiastic champion, and
knockable institutions a powerful op
ponent.
With "Jimmie" Thomas we leave the
Daily Palo Alto knowing full well his
strength and ability already so ably
demonstrated.
Under the leadership of Karl
Schaupp we anticipate another suc
cessful year upon the Stanford Farm
and upon his Herculean shoulders we
place the confidence and hope of the
Student Body.
And now that we have disposed of
our worldly goods, interests, and pos
sessions, we relinquish all claim to
this life, passing into the world where
eternity alone shall determine our
next commencement. The Class of
1911 came In the fall when the sun
kissed hills were smiling 'neath a
coat of tan. We go in the spring when
the green tinted fields and the fra
grant gardens proclaim new life to all.
And so it is with these fond recollec
tions we lay aside our "sombs," break
the ties asunder and stride on to the
distant fields of life where 1911, ever
striving, ever confident, will emblazen
her name forever upon the pages of
history.
Be it so willed.

rights and liberties as these were
given to them by the Founders of a
democratic institution. We further
entrust to their hands in perpetuity,
to have and hold forever, the Stanford
Spirit, so dear and close to the hearts
of the Class of 1911. This, the richest
and most cherished gift in our power
to bestow, we bequeath with full faith
and belief that in our heirs it will find
able champions and that, it shall
never perish from the old "farm."
The farm and homestead itself we

leave with all its appurtenances to the
able trust and management of the
Class of 1912. Having baptized them
in the tub and reared them by cardinal
rules we leave these precious be
quests with the utmost conlidence that
in the Class of 1912, Nineteen Eleven
will find worthy successors.
To those professors who have given
us human "exams," who have coun
seled us in hours of trouble and who
have treated us as men and women we
leave our confidence and esteem, hop
ing that in succeeding classes they
will find as deep appreciation of their
student interest and kindness.
To the Sophomores we give the right,
title and interest to a pair of corduroy
trousers. Likewise we bequeath the
right and privileges appurtenant to the
Junior plugs hoping they will be in
itiated with all the indignities becom
ing the same and that upon the sum
mit of the Junior's anatomy the blows
of 1912 may find a suitable resting
place.
io the Student Affairs Committee
we grant in trust for next year's Soph
omores, the Class of 1915 with the
firm belief it is a bad plan to elim
inate the clean sport of tubbing, in
addition thereto we bequeath to the
aforesaid committee all the porcelain
tubs in Encina Hall with their con
tents, suggesting that in these recept
acles the Stanford Axe might take its
long-needed bath.
Upon the Class of 1914 we lay the
obligation to punish the unruly Frosh
by two smites upon the wrist thus
causing him great pain and torture in
conformity with the University's policy
of reasonable punishment to the un
fortunate infringer of the rules.
The Bookstore we disinherit and
cut off from all rights to live upon the
Stanford campus. We do, however,
lay upon that abominable institution
the duty and obligation to explain
and prove to the suspecting public
how it can charge twice the normal
retail price and still make no profits.
To "Bennie" Erb we confidently
leave the Rugby Team of 1911 with
our hopes and belief that he will pilot
it triumphantly thru the coming sea
son and that under the efficient
coaching of George Presley, Stanford
will again down the Blue and Gold.
With "Tom" Coleman we leave the
Track Team in trust for a victory in
1912 with the hopes the "Colonel's"
luck may change and that he may
again be able to tear off the laps at
the old time clip.
Gilfillan succeeds to the rights and
honor of leading the baseball men in
a four-forty around the diamond and
with "Gil" in charge we leave to Stan
ford the right to expect a victorious
team.
In the calloused hands of Harry
Seward we leave the oars of the Var
sity shell never doubting but that his
powerful shoulders will once more
pull Stanford ahead of the Blue and
Gold.
The Quadrangle with all its prom
enade advantages are hereby be
queathed to "tough-guy" Martin, the
Class of 1911 agreeing to plead with
the Business Office for sufficient light
ing to protect our Percy from holdups
when queening upon the Quad.
The use of all alleys, back roads,
and such other place of concealment
we leave to Hubbard, the speed
maniac, together with the duty and
obligation to stick to those by-ways,
where he will be better hidden from
the public gaze than at present.
We acknowledge Frank Maeomber
and Ted Higgins as active members of


E. ('. Matthias
the Family Club. We would also sug
gest the Delta Gamma apply for an
honorary membership in their soror
ity for Pat Tallant.
To Ken Lee and his cohorts we
leave all the eats of all the dances to
be given upon the Stanford campus
during the coming year. And to "Cort"
Moore we bequeath the rights and
privileges to one shirt to be worn on
Sundays under his rough-neck sweater.
"Les" Summerfield is left the heav
iest hammer of the University with our
confidence that in him the Chaparral
has found an able leader, student in
terests an enthusiastic champion, and
knockable institutions a powerful op
ponent.
With "Jimmie" Thomas we leave the
Daily Palo Alto knowing full well his
strength and ability already so ably
demonstrated.
Under the leadership of Karl
Schaupp we anticipate another suc
cessful year upon the Stanford Farm
and upon his Herculean shoulders we
place the confidence and hope of the
Student Body.
And now that we have disposed of
our worldly goods, interests, and pos
sessions, we relinquish all claim to
this life, passing into the world where
eternity alone shall determine our
next commencement. The Class of
1911 came In the fall when the sun
kissed hills were smiling 'neath a
coat of tan. We go in the spring when
the green tinted fields and the fra
grant gardens proclaim new life to all.
And so it is with these fond recollec
tions we lay aside our "sombs," break
the ties asunder and stride on to the
distant fields of life where 1911, ever
striving, ever confident, will emblazen
her name forever upon the pages of
history.
Be it so willed.

of departure from

this life, with pangs of sorrow and

of the after life, do hereby declare, de

and testament, as hereinafter set
forth.
We direct and command that all just
debts, obligations and expenses in
curred by us in the closing days of our
college life be paid and cancelled by
our beneficent and philanthropic Lord
of the Manor, Charles G. Lathrop.
Lest he refuse this trust so confidently
reposed in him, that of paying out
money, and believing this sum might
be put to better advantage by him in
the purchase of an automobile of the
latest design, we decree these personal
expenses of our closing hours be met
by a diploma fee to be collected and
retained as ordained by the Academic
Council.
As a suitable and fitting monument
to the success, the glory and the
achievements of the Class of 1911 we
leave in the memory of the University
the records of its members, entrusting
to the Holdovers in contingent re
mainder dependent upon the length of
their stay over the four score and ten,
the duty of perpetuating our name in
continuous renown. And to the Hold
overs as sole beneficiaries we also
bequeath the right and privilege to the
return of five dollars, once deposited
as beforementioned diploma fee.
Upon the Undergraduates we impose
the obligation to maintain and hold
inviolate the good name and honor of
the University, to love and respect
their professors, to obey and honestly
follow the rules of the University as
layed down and as they know them to
be, but never to hesitate to unflinch
