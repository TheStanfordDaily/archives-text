# DULL CARE IN FULL RETREAT AT THE FARCE AND CARNIVAL
## "Amazons" a Scream from First to Last Acts. — Senior Play Scores Big Hit. 
### Paul Eliel 
IT pays to give good plays at Stan
ford. The affirmative of this ques
tion was proven beyond any reas
onable doubt at the formal opening of
Senior Week, when the Class of 1911
presented"The Amazons," on Wednes
day evening. Stanford audiences ap
preciate good plays, as much as does
an urban audience. Paritcularly when
the play is a novel, interesting and
laughable farce, does it appeal to our
local theatre-goers. "The Amazons"
was novel—of that there can be no
denying; it as interesting because of
its novelty; and it was laughable to
the last degree.
Play IMt'iicuH for Amateurs
It may have occured to some few in
the audience on Wednesday evening,
that the play was a more than diffi
cult one for amateurs to attempt. To
maintain the humor of a farce so
thoroly imbued with that element,
thru three acts, is a trying task for
the best and most experienced of pro
fessional players. When given to ama
teurs, the task becomes almost her
culean. With "The Amazons" it be
comes particularly difficult owing to
the fact that the humor, thruoui the
entire play, is like a theme with varia
tions. The grotesque antics of the two
comedy characters, Lord Tweenwayes
and De Grival, play continually on the
same strings. We laughed at. these two
for some absured word or action, and
the same idea in a different guise is
presented to us again and again for
the remainder of the play. Here was
where the great difficulty lay. To
speak these lines and perform these
antics, each with a sufficient variation
to make it stand out distinctly from all
the others, was 110 mean test of the
powers of the players. It would be
unfair to say that this was done 011
Wednesday evening. Likewise it
would be unfair to say that these two
comedy parts were not given with a
rare touch and a singular and happy
appreciation 011 the part of both players.
That the play dragged in spots, par
ticularly in the last of the second, and
in the third acts, was evident to all.
However, the players were 110 more at
fault in this regard than was the play
wright. Pinero, himself, must have
realized that the work was deficient in
spots, for he never allowed the play to
descend into what threatened to he
mere mediocrity, without introducing
some new comedy feature, so entirely
laughable that the audience forgot in
a moment the common place action of
the previous scene, to laugh the harder
over the new one.
In a play, in which every character
receive the intimate attention of the
author, and in which almost every
character might be considered as a
"principal," it is difficult to decide on
"best" work. Such a task is made

doubly difficult when thr play is so
perfectly cast as was "The Amazons."
There may have been "best" work at
Wednesday evening's performance, but
it stood out so little above that of the
other players, that it would be unfair
to all to make mention of it. Each of
the principals had a "best" scene, as
each had a "worst."
.Miss I! ill Houses
Miss H. Hill, '11, in the leading role
of Lady Noeline Belturbet, gave an al
together pleasing and finished render
ing of her part. To show the growth
of the character from a hoydenish,
care-free, unthinking, and occasionally
selfish girl, to a mature and entirely
lovable young woman, was no small
task, and yet Miss Hill did that very
thing to perfection. By far her best
scene was in the second act, with
Litterley, where she tatooes his wrist,
it was especially pleasant to hear
Miss Hill's spontaneous laugh, after
the frequent abortive attempts at
mirth that we have been accustomed
to hear in our plays.
As Lord Litterley, the athletic, kind
ly, but not over-brilliant, straight-lead,
R. II. Seward. '12, had little chance
to display his dramatic ability. The
audience was a little disappointed that
he had no chance. The lack of a truly
strong scene made them feel that
Seward's work was weak. It was not
weak, it was merely a colorless part,
after the fashion of most "hero" parts,
and was well played as such.
Undoubtedly the hardest part in the
play to make convincing and consist
ent was that of Lady Castlejordan,
played by Miss M. Cleveland. A gen
eral infusion of a too youthful spon
taneity detracted considerably from
the conviction that the part should
have carried with it.
Bmiau is Perfect Comedian
J. B. Beman, '12, in the role of the
absurd, and almost impossible Tween
ways would probably have been gen
erally judged as the best performer of
the evening. The part lent itself to
entire appreciation by the audience;
it contained no subtle passages; it was
easy of comprehension: therefore it
was appreciated. Beaman's work was
excellent, however. Slightly crude in
spots, as it was bound to be with the
kind of humor portrayed, it was never
theless remarkably consistent, and had
it only been marked by a slightly
greater variation in presentation,
would have been perfect.
In the part of l)e Grival, Tween
wayes' extremely French companion,
E. C. Matthias, '11. did an excellent
piece of work. A slight over-exagera
tion, due to some extent at least, to
Mr. Mathieu's coaching was its only
fault.
Miss F. Metzner, as the most effi-
nate and most romantic of the three,
"Amazons," gave us a pretty and pleas
ing picture that will long be remem
bered. Miss Metzner's was an easy
part, and left little room for criticism.
Miss R. Benjamin, '13, was good.
She was boyish, and filled her part
quite as it should have been filled.
Such abandon and freedom as she
showed was a pleasure to watch. Oc
casionally a gesture was forced, but
otherwise her work was almost per
fect.
In the minor parts, N. M. Halcome,
'11, as Fitton, gave the most finished
and consistent bit of acting. His work
altho small in quantity, was large in
quality. No professional could have
handled the part better.
The other characters, Rev. Minchin
played by H. G. Ferguson, '11, Sear
geant Shuter, Miss R. Shaw, '11, Orts,
D. .T. Rutherford, '11, and Youatt, S.
W. Guthire, '13, were all well played.

spots, as it was bound to be with the
kind of humor portrayed, it was never
theless remarkably consistent, and had
it only been marked by a slightly
greater variation in presentation,
would have been perfect.
In the part of l)e Grival, Tween
wayes' extremely French companion,
E. C. Matthias, '11. did an excellent
piece of work. A slight over-exagera
tion, due to some extent at least, to
Mr. Mathieu's coaching was its only
fault.
Miss F. Metzner, as the most effi-
nate and most romantic of the three,
"Amazons," gave us a pretty and pleas
ing picture that will long be remem
bered. Miss Metzner's was an easy
part, and left little room for criticism.
Miss R. Benjamin, '13, was good.
She was boyish, and filled her part
quite as it should have been filled.
Such abandon and freedom as she
showed was a pleasure to watch. Oc
casionally a gesture was forced, but
otherwise her work was almost per
fect.
In the minor parts, N. M. Halcome,
'11, as Fitton, gave the most finished
and consistent bit of acting. His work
altho small in quantity, was large in
quality. No professional could have
handled the part better.
The other characters, Rev. Minchin
played by H. G. Ferguson, '11, Sear
geant Shuter, Miss R. Shaw, '11, Orts,
D. .T. Rutherford, '11, and Youatt, S.
W. Guthire, '13, were all well played.
IT pays to give good plays at Stan
ford. The affirmative of this ques
tion was proven beyond any reas
onable doubt at the formal opening of
Senior Week, when the Class of 1911
presented"The Amazons," on Wednes
day evening. Stanford audiences ap
preciate good plays, as much as does
an urban audience. Paritcularly when
the play is a novel, interesting and
laughable farce, does it appeal to our
local theatre-goers. "The Amazons"
was novel—of that there can be no
denying; it as interesting because of
its novelty; and it was laughable to
the last degree.
Play IMt'iicuH for Amateurs
It may have occured to some few in
the audience on Wednesday evening,
that the play was a more than diffi
cult one for amateurs to attempt. To
maintain the humor of a farce so
thoroly imbued with that element,
thru three acts, is a trying task for
the best and most experienced of pro
fessional players. When given to ama
teurs, the task becomes almost her
culean. With "The Amazons" it be
comes particularly difficult owing to
the fact that the humor, thruoui the
entire play, is like a theme with varia
tions. The grotesque antics of the two
comedy characters, Lord Tweenwayes
and De Grival, play continually on the
same strings. We laughed at. these two
for some absured word or action, and
the same idea in a different guise is
presented to us again and again for
the remainder of the play. Here was
where the great difficulty lay. To
speak these lines and perform these
antics, each with a sufficient variation
to make it stand out distinctly from all
the others, was 110 mean test of the
powers of the players. It would be
unfair to say that this was done 011
Wednesday evening. Likewise it
would be unfair to say that these two
comedy parts were not given with a
rare touch and a singular and happy
appreciation 011 the part of both players.
That the play dragged in spots, par
ticularly in the last of the second, and
in the third acts, was evident to all.
However, the players were 110 more at
fault in this regard than was the play
wright. Pinero, himself, must have
realized that the work was deficient in
spots, for he never allowed the play to
descend into what threatened to he
mere mediocrity, without introducing
some new comedy feature, so entirely
laughable that the audience forgot in
a moment the common place action of
the previous scene, to laugh the harder
over the new one.
In a play, in which every character
receive the intimate attention of the
author, and in which almost every
character might be considered as a
"principal," it is difficult to decide on
"best" work. Such a task is made

doubly difficult when thr play is so
perfectly cast as was "The Amazons."
There may have been "best" work at
Wednesday evening's performance, but
it stood out so little above that of the
other players, that it would be unfair
to all to make mention of it. Each of
the principals had a "best" scene, as
each had a "worst."
.Miss I! ill Houses
Miss H. Hill, '11, in the leading role
of Lady Noeline Belturbet, gave an al
together pleasing and finished render
ing of her part. To show the growth
of the character from a hoydenish,
care-free, unthinking, and occasionally
selfish girl, to a mature and entirely
lovable young woman, was no small
task, and yet Miss Hill did that very
thing to perfection. By far her best
scene was in the second act, with
Litterley, where she tatooes his wrist,
it was especially pleasant to hear
Miss Hill's spontaneous laugh, after
the frequent abortive attempts at
mirth that we have been accustomed
to hear in our plays.
As Lord Litterley, the athletic, kind
ly, but not over-brilliant, straight-lead,
R. II. Seward. '12, had little chance
to display his dramatic ability. The
audience was a little disappointed that
he had no chance. The lack of a truly
strong scene made them feel that
Seward's work was weak. It was not
weak, it was merely a colorless part,
after the fashion of most "hero" parts,
and was well played as such.
Undoubtedly the hardest part in the
play to make convincing and consist
ent was that of Lady Castlejordan,
played by Miss M. Cleveland. A gen
eral infusion of a too youthful spon
taneity detracted considerably from
the conviction that the part should
have carried with it.
Bmiau is Perfect Comedian
J. B. Beman, '12, in the role of the
absurd, and almost impossible Tween
ways would probably have been gen
erally judged as the best performer of
the evening. The part lent itself to
entire appreciation by the audience;
it contained no subtle passages; it was
easy of comprehension: therefore it
was appreciated. Beaman's work was
excellent, however. Slightly crude in
spots, as it was bound to be with the
kind of humor portrayed, it was never

lovable young woman, was no small
task, and yet Miss Hill did that very
thing to perfection. By far her best
scene was in the second act, with
Litterley, where she tatooes his wrist,
it was especially pleasant to hear
Miss Hill's spontaneous laugh, after
the frequent abortive attempts at
mirth that we have been accustomed
to hear in our plays.
As Lord Litterley, the athletic, kind
ly, but not over-brilliant, straight-lead,
R. II. Seward. '12, had little chance
to display his dramatic ability. The
audience was a little disappointed that
he had no chance. The lack of a truly
strong scene made them feel that
Seward's work was weak. It was not
weak, it was merely a colorless part,
after the fashion of most "hero" parts,
and was well played as such.
Undoubtedly the hardest part in the
play to make convincing and consist
ent was that of Lady Castlejordan,
played by Miss M. Cleveland. A gen
eral infusion of a too youthful spon
taneity detracted considerably from
the conviction that the part should
have carried with it.
Bmiau is Perfect Comedian
J. B. Beman, '12, in the role of the
absurd, and almost impossible Tween
ways would probably have been gen
erally judged as the best performer of
the evening. The part lent itself to
entire appreciation by the audience;
it contained no subtle passages; it was
easy of comprehension: therefore it
was appreciated. Beaman's work was
excellent, however. Slightly crude in
spots, as it was bound to be with the
kind of humor portrayed, it was never
theless remarkably consistent, and had
it only been marked by a slightly
greater variation in presentation,
would have been perfect.
In the part of l)e Grival, Tween
wayes' extremely French companion,
E. C. Matthias, '11. did an excellent
piece of work. A slight over-exagera
tion, due to some extent at least, to
Mr. Mathieu's coaching was its only
fault.
Miss F. Metzner, as the most effi-
nate and most romantic of the three,
"Amazons," gave us a pretty and pleas
ing picture that will long be remem
bered. Miss Metzner's was an easy
part, and left little room for criticism.
Miss R. Benjamin, '13, was good.
She was boyish, and filled her part
quite as it should have been filled.
Such abandon and freedom as she
showed was a pleasure to watch. Oc
casionally a gesture was forced, but
otherwise her work was almost per
fect.
In the minor parts, N. M. Halcome,
'11, as Fitton, gave the most finished
and consistent bit of acting. His work
altho small in quantity, was large in
quality. No professional could have
handled the part better.
The other characters, Rev. Minchin
played by H. G. Ferguson, '11, Sear
geant Shuter, Miss R. Shaw, '11, Orts,
D. .T. Rutherford, '11, and Youatt, S.
W. Guthire, '13, were all well played.
IT pays to give good plays at Stan
ford. The affirmative of this ques
tion was proven beyond any reas
onable doubt at the formal opening of
Senior Week, when the Class of 1911
presented"The Amazons," on Wednes
day evening. Stanford audiences ap
preciate good plays, as much as does
an urban audience. Paritcularly when
the play is a novel, interesting and
laughable farce, does it appeal to our
local theatre-goers. "The Amazons"
was novel—of that there can be no
denying; it as interesting because of
its novelty; and it was laughable to
the last degree.
Play IMt'iicuH for Amateurs
It may have occured to some few in
the audience on Wednesday evening,
that the play was a more than diffi
cult one for amateurs to attempt. To
maintain the humor of a farce so
thoroly imbued with that element,
thru three acts, is a trying task for
the best and most experienced of pro
fessional players. When given to ama
teurs, the task becomes almost her
culean. With "The Amazons" it be
comes particularly difficult owing to
the fact that the humor, thruoui the
entire play, is like a theme with varia
tions. The grotesque antics of the two
comedy characters, Lord Tweenwayes
and De Grival, play continually on the
same strings. We laughed at. these two
for some absured word or action, and
the same idea in a different guise is
presented to us again and again for
the remainder of the play. Here was
where the great difficulty lay. To
speak these lines and perform these
antics, each with a sufficient variation
to make it stand out distinctly from all
the others, was 110 mean test of the
powers of the players. It would be
unfair to say that this was done 011
Wednesday evening. Likewise it
would be unfair to say that these two
comedy parts were not given with a
rare touch and a singular and happy
appreciation 011 the part of both players.
That the play dragged in spots, par
ticularly in the last of the second, and
in the third acts, was evident to all.
However, the players were 110 more at
fault in this regard than was the play
wright. Pinero, himself, must have
realized that the work was deficient in
spots, for he never allowed the play to
descend into what threatened to he
mere mediocrity, without introducing
some new comedy feature, so entirely
laughable that the audience forgot in
a moment the common place action of
the previous scene, to laugh the harder
over the new one.
In a play, in which every character
receive the intimate attention of the
author, and in which almost every
character might be considered as a
"principal," it is difficult to decide on
"best" work. Such a task is made

doubly difficult when thr play is so
perfectly cast as was "The Amazons."
There may have been "best" work at
Wednesday evening's performance, but
it stood out so little above that of the
other players, that it would be unfair
to all to make mention of it. Each of
the principals had a "best" scene, as
each had a "worst."
.Miss I! ill Houses
Miss H. Hill, '11, in the leading role
of Lady Noeline Belturbet, gave an al
together pleasing and finished render
ing of her part. To show the growth
of the character from a hoydenish,
care-free, unthinking, and occasionally
selfish girl, to a mature and entirely
lovable young woman, was no small
task, and yet Miss Hill did that very
thing to perfection. By far her best
