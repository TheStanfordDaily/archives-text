# CLASS ORATION

During the four years that we have
been here, we have thoroly impressed
ourselves upon the life and customs of
this University. But the organized

unit of activity that
we as individuals
have combined to
form, the Class of
1911, is about to end
its existence. It is
appropriate that its
last acts should be
directed along the
lines, which in the
opinions of our pre
decess or s, most
suitably indicate our

recognition of the true position of each
Class in the history of the University.
From now on we are to represent out-
University as individuals, in the pur
suit of that personal success and direct
usefulness In life, for which, according
to the express desire of our founders,
our work here should have qualified
us.
Progress Justifies Education
Great universities are known, above
all other things, by the quality of their
products. Oxford and Cambridge,
Harvard and Yale are known by the
men they have produced. Classes and
student bodies are mere matters-of
course in an educational system. The
progress of the men who have gradu
ated justify or fail to justify the con
tinued existence of their respective
Alma Maters. So of Staiford. On us.
as finished products of this highly
developed educational institution, de
pends the justification for Stanford's
existence. But the duty that we owe
is not to Stanford as a subject of emo-

tional retrospection, and pleasant
memories of underclass days. It is a
duty to the most advanced intelligence
of the age in which we live. It is
measured in terms of our own intelli
gence, for only to that extent are wo
able to effectually respond.
We sometimes hear of the Stanford
type of men. That doesn't mean that
Stanford men are essentially different
from men from the University of Cal
ifornia, Harvard, Yale, or Chicago. It
means that Stanford men, by reason of
the advantages which have been pro
vided for them here, are better quali
fied to gain personal success, and to be
of different usefulness in life, than
men who have not had those advant
ages. To the extent that each univer
sity provides up-to-date facilities for
work, and a proper educational envir
onment, and to the extent that her
students avail themselves of them, the
type of men produced by each will
tend toward the type of Stanford man
which we desire.
Superiority in Types
When our graduates leave here, each
will inevitably find his place in one of
the many types of men which the
world contains. Their distinction is
that they will be the best of their re
spective types. It is possible, almost
inevitable, when we consider the whole
product of such a large institution as
this, that some should go out defective
in character. Perhaps it is due to a
latent defect in the original material;
perhaps the various forces of Univer
sity activity were not properly ap
plied. Such men will become crooks
and grafters, and ultimately a highly
finished brand of criminal. The fact
that they are the best of their class,
in such a case may well be regretted.
But there are many legimitate lines
in which a man's best may be shown,
and the wide viewpoint which a uni
versity gives will scatter her graduates
even more widely than they would
otherwise have gone. Good business
men, good scientists, good advocates of
many professions, are essential assets
of the world's stock in trade. Stanford's
ambition, and our duty is that we
should be the best in every line.
Dealing With Men and Things
And in the most successful perform
ance of our obligations, one of the
greatest advantages which a univer
sity education should give, is a fine
discrimination in the ability to deal
with men and things. In every phase
of life, in every line of industry, the
successful man is the one who gets the
most done along his particular line
with the best placed effort. So it be
hooves the business man to know the
best accredited methods of trade, the
lawyer the truest forms of logic. So
in our dealings with men, success de
pends upon the ability to see and to
respect the other man's point of view:
to recognize the idiosyncracies which
race, religion, or position in life may
have made him heir to, and neverthe
less to influence his actions along the
lines we desire.
But beyond the obligations involved
in attaining individual success, to
which T have just referred, there is
another duty, which all men have
recognized, and which has been the
predominating motive underlying the
steady progress of the human race. For
some it a question or religion, for some
emotion, for some of hard common
sense, but every man who thinks,
knows that in the long run his chances
for success are better according to the
improvement of the whole community
in which he lives, and that it is better
for him to respect the rights of others
