## 
### 
CONVIVIALITY, plenty of
speeches abounding in sound
wisdom and live humor, an
abundance of the spirit that has made
the Cardinal community famous, Uni
versity professors, refreshments that
refreshed, graduates of twenty classes,
and Seniors of 1911 created an epoch
in.the history of Alumni luncheons in
Roble Hall Saturday afternoon.
Upon W. W. Guth, '95, President of
the Alumni Association, fell the most
important forensic duty of the after
noon, that of presenting to the Univer
sity on behalf of the organization of
which he is the executive head, the
life-size painting of Dr. David Starr
Jordan. President Guth in his presen
tation of the portrait which is the
work of Mrs. R. M. Richardson of San
Francisco and represents the Univer
sity head clothed in his official robes
pointed out the esteem in which Dr.
Jordan is held by the old graduates
and dwelt upon the fact that, the great
er feeling of appreciation for his work
came after graduation and a few en
counters with the forces which go 1o
make up the world. Timothy Hopkins,
President of the Board of Trustees,
accepted the gift to the University.
In an address which produced round
after round of applause Franklin
Swart, '07, District Attorney of San
Mateo County, welcomed the graduates
for the Alumni. R. J. Miller, '11, Sen
ior Class orator, responded to the
greetings of the Association's members
and voiced the appreciative sentiments
of the Class which Is about to depart
from the University.
President Jordan and Professor A.
M. Carthcart, '96, spoke for the Faculty
and pleaded for an increased effort on

the part of the associated graduates
to push forward the work of making
the name of Stanford and her educa
tional advantages known to those
who are yet unlearned.
Loyalty to one's Alma Mater was the
thread which joined all the preceeding
speeches as well as the talks of Mrs.
E. W. Smith, '02, who spoke for the
Stanford Alumnae, and C. C. Coonau
'09, who represented the graduates now
engaged in further and higher
branches of study in the University.
Carrying out the long established
custom of holding particular reunions,
the classes of '96. '01, '06, and '09,
each had a separate table at the lunch
eon.
