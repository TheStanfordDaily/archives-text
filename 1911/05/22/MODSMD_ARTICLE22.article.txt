ONE of the most enjoyable of the
informal affairs of Senior
Week was the Senior-Alumni
Reception held in Encina Clubroom
Saturday evening. A large number of
the visiting Alumni and those re
maining for Senior Week gathered at
the big dormitory for an evening of re
newal of old acquaintanceships, meet
ing present and past Stanford people,
and informal dancing. A program of
twelve dances was furnished by the
Campus Dance Orchestra.
Of the Alumni those representing
'96, '01, '06, and '09. were most in
evidence. They took advantage of the
reception to fittingly close the general
program of Alumni Day, which in

eluded the Senior-Alumni baseball
game in the morning, won by the for
mer by a score of r> to 1, the Alumni
Association meeting, the Luncheon and
the Class Reunions.
The outer lobby of the Clubroom
was tastefully decorated with orna
mental palms and was fitted out as a
lounging room with rugs and easy
chairs. The dancing was confined to
the clubroom proper.
The reception which was conducted
by the combined Senior and Alumni
reception committees with .T. E. Hip
gins and K. L. Dole, as chairmen was
one of the most successful of the an
nual reunions of the present and past
generations of Stanford graduates and
undergraduates.
