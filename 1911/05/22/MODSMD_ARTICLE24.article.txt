# DR. B.E. HOWARD PREACHES BACCALAUREATE SERMON
## Life of Abraham Basis for Penetrating Address on the Meaning of True Greatness. 
### 
44 A STUDY in True Greatness,"
/\ was the suggestive title of
the truly great Baccalau
reate Sermon preached yesterday to
the Graduating Class by Dr. Burt
Estes Howard in the Assembly Hall at
11 o'clock. Taking from the life of
Abraham object lessons of the real
characteristics of greatness, Dr. How
ard delivered a sermon of great force
and incisiveness as a final bit of spir
itual advice to the departing Seniors.
The services in their entirety were
most impressive. The Class of 1911
met first in the Chapel duly capped
and gowned, and from there went in
procession to Assembly Hall, the large
audience rising as the procession filed
into the reserved seats.
The scripture lesson was read by R.
J. Miller, '11. The musical program
was excellent.
Dr. Howard spoke in part as fol
lows:
"Full of days, at an age when men
are wont to loose their hold upon life's
activities, was Abraham born into his
tory. Seventy and five years had he
lived and labored, treading the ways
of his fathers, when something entered
into his life which changed the whole
course and meaning of it. What that
something was and how it seized this
man and mastered him we can only
conjecture. The story handed down is
very brief: 'Now the Lord said to
Abraham, 'Get thee out of thy country
and from thy kindred and from thy
father's house, unto the land which I
will show thee . . . '; so Abraham
went as the Lord had spoken unto him.'
When Duty Calls
"The experience of Abraham is not
unique. This converging of intima
tions and suggestions, of wonderings
and musings, into one clear call to ser
vice and sacrifice is God's way of mak
ing history. There comes a day to us
all, to institutions and to men, when
the whispers and confused mutterings
of divine voices grow swiftly articulate
in the thunder tones of an imperative
duty.
"If there arise in this world of ours
mighty institutions, they are but the
utterance of some man's mighty spirit.
Nations live, Society is organized, Civ
ilization rises because there have been
men great enough to make themselves
of no reputation for the sake of the
world; men who have planted their
very souls in the earth to come forth
as so much uplift for their fellowmen.
Cromwell, Luther, Washington, Lin
coln, —these are not names of bits of
moving flesh and blood that lived their
little day and then faded from the
sight of men. They stand rather for
the incarnation of principles that
saved England, regenerated Europe,
created Democracy, redeemed manhood
and glorified the world.
Be Mighty In Faith
"It is far easier to criticize the vices
of great men than to emulate their vir
tue or duplicate their deeds. Great
men make mistakes. The man who
does not make mistakes does not make
anything. Great men sometimes fail of
recognition. Yet the truly great soul
lms not failed when the world of little

men refuses to rate him at his worth.
Abraham was not great because the
ages have taken note of him and 'writ
ten his name in a book'; but because
he was mighty of faith, which means
that he had mighty convictions of duty
and followed them.
"We are prone to measure the great
ness of men by standards that are not
true, and to weigh the worth of men by
balances that give at the best but a
lying estimate. For most of us begin
to reckon a man's value from that point
at which the world begins to take note
"Among all the heresies of human
thought, there is none so false or so
mischievous as the notion that life gets
its worth from its deeds or its oppor
tunities. Deeds do not make a man
great. They only show that his great
ness has had a chance to utter itself.
Opportunities do not make a man
great. They only serve to spell out in
visible word the greatness that was
there all the while in the silent deeps
of the man's soul. The root of great
ness lies in the great spirit that thinks
great thoughts and dreams great
dreams, though no chance ever comes
to execute those thoughts or make
those visions actual in concrete ac
complishment.
The Truly Great
"Let no man confound true great
ness with the mere opportunity to
exhibit it. The fact of greatness does
not depend on the exploitation of it.
And let no man minimize the worth of
his own life because of the poverty of
its equipment for large activities. The
world needs great souls more than
great conditions today. It does seem
a hopeless task—this standing up
single-handed and alone to fight God's
battle for justice and righteousness
and truth —but the battle is not to the
strong. It is to the strong-hearted.
"In the growing structure of civiliza
tion the average man means more than
the accidental man. Underneath the
huge splendor of our Twentieth Cen
tury civilization and giving to that
civilization its broad and enduring
foundation, lie the myriads on myriads
of men and women whom no man can
number and whose name no man re
members, but because of whose silent
fidelity to so much of the truth as they
knew, all that Ve possess that is of
worth today stands fast as our eternal
heritage.
"And they are truly great,—these
men and women who could live like
gods with only an average man's
chance at life, and who were willing to
live, in the dust of their petty tread
mill existence, a strong, sweet, helpful
life, asking no reward of chattering
fame and no monuments save the en
during fruits of their faithfulness.

44 A STUDY in True Greatness,"
/\ was the suggestive title of
the truly great Baccalau
reate Sermon preached yesterday to
the Graduating Class by Dr. Burt
Estes Howard in the Assembly Hall at
11 o'clock. Taking from the life of
Abraham object lessons of the real
characteristics of greatness, Dr. How
ard delivered a sermon of great force
and incisiveness as a final bit of spir
itual advice to the departing Seniors.
The services in their entirety were
most impressive. The Class of 1911
met first in the Chapel duly capped
and gowned, and from there went in
procession to Assembly Hall, the large
audience rising as the procession filed
into the reserved seats.
The scripture lesson was read by R.
J. Miller, '11. The musical program
was excellent.
Dr. Howard spoke in part as fol
lows:
"Full of days, at an age when men
are wont to loose their hold upon life's
activities, was Abraham born into his
tory. Seventy and five years had he
lived and labored, treading the ways
of his fathers, when something entered
into his life which changed the whole
course and meaning of it. What that
something was and how it seized this
man and mastered him we can only
conjecture. The story handed down is
very brief: 'Now the Lord said to
Abraham, 'Get thee out of thy country
and from thy kindred and from thy
father's house, unto the land which I
will show thee . . . '; so Abraham
went as the Lord had spoken unto him.'
When Duty Calls
"The experience of Abraham is not
unique. This converging of intima
tions and suggestions, of wonderings
and musings, into one clear call to ser
vice and sacrifice is God's way of mak
ing history. There comes a day to us
all, to institutions and to men, when
the whispers and confused mutterings
of divine voices grow swiftly articulate
in the thunder tones of an imperative
duty.
"If there arise in this world of ours
mighty institutions, they are but the
utterance of some man's mighty spirit.

ness with the mere opportunity to
exhibit it. The fact of greatness does
not depend on the exploitation of it.
And let no man minimize the worth of
his own life because of the poverty of
its equipment for large activities. The
world needs great souls more than
great conditions today. It does seem
a hopeless task—this standing up
single-handed and alone to fight God's
battle for justice and righteousness
and truth —but the battle is not to the
strong. It is to the strong-hearted.
"In the growing structure of civiliza
tion the average man means more than
the accidental man. Underneath the
huge splendor of our Twentieth Cen
tury civilization and giving to that
civilization its broad and enduring
foundation, lie the myriads on myriads
of men and women whom no man can
number and whose name no man re
members, but because of whose silent
fidelity to so much of the truth as they
knew, all that Ve possess that is of
worth today stands fast as our eternal
heritage.
"And they are truly great,—these
men and women who could live like
gods with only an average man's
chance at life, and who were willing to
live, in the dust of their petty tread
mill existence, a strong, sweet, helpful
life, asking no reward of chattering
fame and no monuments save the en
during fruits of their faithfulness.

44 A STUDY in True Greatness,"
/\ was the suggestive title of
the truly great Baccalau
reate Sermon preached yesterday to
the Graduating Class by Dr. Burt
Estes Howard in the Assembly Hall at
11 o'clock. Taking from the life of
Abraham object lessons of the real
characteristics of greatness, Dr. How
ard delivered a sermon of great force
and incisiveness as a final bit of spir
itual advice to the departing Seniors.
The services in their entirety were
most impressive. The Class of 1911
met first in the Chapel duly capped
and gowned, and from there went in
procession to Assembly Hall, the large
audience rising as the procession filed
into the reserved seats.
The scripture lesson was read by R.
J. Miller, '11. The musical program
was excellent.
Dr. Howard spoke in part as fol
lows:
"Full of days, at an age when men
are wont to loose their hold upon life's
activities, was Abraham born into his
tory. Seventy and five years had he
lived and labored, treading the ways
of his fathers, when something entered
into his life which changed the whole
course and meaning of it. What that
something was and how it seized this
man and mastered him we can only
conjecture. The story handed down is
very brief: 'Now the Lord said to
Abraham, 'Get thee out of thy country
and from thy kindred and from thy
father's house, unto the land which I
will show thee . . . '; so Abraham
went as the Lord had spoken unto him.'
When Duty Calls
"The experience of Abraham is not
unique. This converging of intima
tions and suggestions, of wonderings
and musings, into one clear call to ser
vice and sacrifice is God's way of mak
ing history. There comes a day to us
all, to institutions and to men, when
the whispers and confused mutterings
of divine voices grow swiftly articulate
in the thunder tones of an imperative
duty.
"If there arise in this world of ours
mighty institutions, they are but the
utterance of some man's mighty spirit.
Nations live, Society is organized, Civ
ilization rises because there have been
men great enough to make themselves
of no reputation for the sake of the
world; men who have planted their
very souls in the earth to come forth
as so much uplift for their fellowmen.
Cromwell, Luther, Washington, Lin
coln, —these are not names of bits of
moving flesh and blood that lived their
little day and then faded from the
sight of men. They stand rather for
the incarnation of principles that
saved England, regenerated Europe,
created Democracy, redeemed manhood
and glorified the world.
Be Mighty In Faith
"It is far easier to criticize the vices
of great men than to emulate their vir
tue or duplicate their deeds. Great
men make mistakes. The man who
does not make mistakes does not make
anything. Great men sometimes fail of
recognition. Yet the truly great soul
lms not failed when the world of little

men refuses to rate him at his worth.
Abraham was not great because the
ages have taken note of him and 'writ
ten his name in a book'; but because
he was mighty of faith, which means
that he had mighty convictions of duty
and followed them.
"We are prone to measure the great
ness of men by standards that are not
true, and to weigh the worth of men by
balances that give at the best but a
lying estimate. For most of us begin
to reckon a man's value from that point
at which the world begins to take note
"Among all the heresies of human
thought, there is none so false or so
mischievous as the notion that life gets
its worth from its deeds or its oppor
tunities. Deeds do not make a man
great. They only show that his great
ness has had a chance to utter itself.
Opportunities do not make a man
great. They only serve to spell out in
visible word the greatness that was
there all the while in the silent deeps
of the man's soul. The root of great
ness lies in the great spirit that thinks
great thoughts and dreams great
dreams, though no chance ever comes
to execute those thoughts or make
those visions actual in concrete ac
complishment.
The Truly Great
"Let no man confound true great
ness with the mere opportunity to
exhibit it. The fact of greatness does
not depend on the exploitation of it.
And let no man minimize the worth of
his own life because of the poverty of
its equipment for large activities. The
world needs great souls more than
great conditions today. It does seem
a hopeless task—this standing up
single-handed and alone to fight God's
battle for justice and righteousness
and truth —but the battle is not to the
strong. It is to the strong-hearted.
"In the growing structure of civiliza
tion the average man means more than
the accidental man. Underneath the
huge splendor of our Twentieth Cen
tury civilization and giving to that
civilization its broad and enduring
foundation, lie the myriads on myriads
of men and women whom no man can
