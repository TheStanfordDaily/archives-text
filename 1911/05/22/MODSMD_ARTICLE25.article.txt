# CHESTER ROWELL DELIVERS PHI BETA KAPPA ADDRESS
## Brilliant Fresno Editor Gives Significant Discourse on the "New Democracy" in Chapel Saturday. 
### 
A scholarly address by a "busy
man in the actual work of do
ing things," was what made
the open meeting of Phi Beta Kappa of
unusual worth to all classes of hear
ers. The speaker, Hon. Chester A.
Rowel 1, chose as his subject, "Educa
tion and the New Democracy." He
dwelt upon the rapid evolution of
democracy in America, the changing
ideas of the people, and the import
ance of education as the only solution
of the complex problems of the New
Democracy.
That American democracy is rapidly
evolving from its present status to
something better is no surprise to
scholarly students of affairs, he held,
but the new and important fact is,
that the people themselves have found
this out. The reason which he gave
for the changing ideas of American
politics is that people are beginning
to analyze and question their own in
herited axioms.
Passing of Individualism
The fundamental change in the
American point of view is the loss of
the old idea of individualism. This
has disappeared with the growth of
large cities, the increasing paternal
ism of government, and the influx of
foreigners accustomed to dependence,
who have brought with them the "col
lectivism of helplessness." Under the
influence of these factors a new view
has been assumed of the old concep
tion of government. The people want
nationalism, ignore the old idea of
Individual and state rights, and de
sire a strong centralization of the gov
erning power.
The speaker brought out the tliot
that, while previously the theory had
been held that pure democracy was
possible only in extremely small com
munities, the idea at present is to
apply the principles of direct democ
racy to the politics of the most com
plex society known. He gave as the
reasons for the growth of this move
ment the peoples' distrust of their
representatives, and the physical pos
sibility, thru the telegraph, the press,
etcetera, of doing things directly on
a large scale. The only limits which
he presented, to the growth of direct
democracy, are political. The startl
ing question, which he put was how
far the will of the people might be
determined by the vote of the people.
This he said could only be found out
by experiment. By several illustrative
cases he demonstrated the ludicrous
extent to which the elective system is
carried out in the United States. He
held that the direct election of the
governor represents the will of the
people, while that of the State printer,
for instance, results only from pro
fessional politics. His idea was for a
shorter ballot and a more practical
mechanism of election.
.Menace of Classes
Another great menace to the new
democracy, as he pointed out. is the
growth of class consciousness. In this
connection he showed the fallacy of
the present "rule of the majority,"
holding that this principle falls down

when people classify themselves. He
pointed out the alarming tendency in
economic conditions as well as in poli
tics toward a dead lock plan of settle
ment.
Faith in the educated men of Amer
ica was the hope which Mr. Rowell
held out for the solution of these com
plex problems of the new time. He
showed the importance of three fac
tors in the system of education, name
ly, the great American public school
system, the universities, and the press.
In the primary schools he showed that
the first problem, that of the "Human
Melting Pot," is successfully dealt
with in the making of real Americans
out of the imigrant children.
University and State
The problem which he presented to
the universities was their necessity as
laboratories of civic affairs. He
showed that the universities must un
dertake systematic investigation of
political conditions and present them
to the public in a comprehensive way.
"Jugments must be complex," he said,
"but action ought to be clear and de
cisive." Thus he showed the com
plementary relationship between in
tellectual training and decisive action.
The importance of the press in edu
cating the people he held could not
be over-estimated. It must be the
forum of the country. "Without a free
press there can be no honest govern
ment."
The annual poem, written and read
by Professor H. D. Gray of the Eng
lish department, was an exceptional
delight. It may well be given a prom
inent place ulnong the achievements
of Stanford's Phi Beta Kappa.
A banquet of the scholarship frater
nity was held at Roble Hall Saturday
evening, at which many able and en
tertaining toasts were given.

That American democracy is rapidly
evolving from its present status to
something better is no surprise to
scholarly students of affairs, he held,
but the new and important fact is,
that the people themselves have found
this out. The reason which he gave
for the changing ideas of American
politics is that people are beginning
to analyze and question their own in
herited axioms.
Passing of Individualism
The fundamental change in the
American point of view is the loss of
the old idea of individualism. This
has disappeared with the growth of
large cities, the increasing paternal
ism of government, and the influx of
foreigners accustomed to dependence,
who have brought with them the "col
lectivism of helplessness." Under the
influence of these factors a new view
has been assumed of the old concep
tion of government. The people want
nationalism, ignore the old idea of
Individual and state rights, and de
sire a strong centralization of the gov
erning power.
The speaker brought out the tliot
that, while previously the theory had
been held that pure democracy was
possible only in extremely small com
munities, the idea at present is to
apply the principles of direct democ
racy to the politics of the most com
plex society known. He gave as the
reasons for the growth of this move
ment the peoples' distrust of their
representatives, and the physical pos
sibility, thru the telegraph, the press,
etcetera, of doing things directly on
a large scale. The only limits which
he presented, to the growth of direct
democracy, are political. The startl
ing question, which he put was how
far the will of the people might be
determined by the vote of the people.
This he said could only be found out
by experiment. By several illustrative
cases he demonstrated the ludicrous
extent to which the elective system is
carried out in the United States. He
held that the direct election of the
governor represents the will of the
people, while that of the State printer,
for instance, results only from pro
fessional politics. His idea was for a
shorter ballot and a more practical
mechanism of election.
.Menace of Classes
Another great menace to the new
democracy, as he pointed out. is the
growth of class consciousness. In this
connection he showed the fallacy of
the present "rule of the majority,"
holding that this principle falls down

when people classify themselves. He
pointed out the alarming tendency in
economic conditions as well as in poli
tics toward a dead lock plan of settle
ment.
Faith in the educated men of Amer
ica was the hope which Mr. Rowell
held out for the solution of these com
plex problems of the new time. He
showed the importance of three fac
tors in the system of education, name
ly, the great American public school
system, the universities, and the press.
In the primary schools he showed that
the first problem, that of the "Human
Melting Pot," is successfully dealt
with in the making of real Americans
out of the imigrant children.
University and State
The problem which he presented to
the universities was their necessity as
laboratories of civic affairs. He
showed that the universities must un
dertake systematic investigation of
political conditions and present them
to the public in a comprehensive way.
"Jugments must be complex," he said,
"but action ought to be clear and de
cisive." Thus he showed the com
plementary relationship between in
tellectual training and decisive action.
The importance of the press in edu
cating the people he held could not
be over-estimated. It must be the
forum of the country. "Without a free
press there can be no honest govern
ment."
The annual poem, written and read
by Professor H. D. Gray of the Eng
lish department, was an exceptional
delight. It may well be given a prom
inent place ulnong the achievements
of Stanford's Phi Beta Kappa.
A banquet of the scholarship frater
nity was held at Roble Hall Saturday
evening, at which many able and en
tertaining toasts were given.
A scholarly address by a "busy
man in the actual work of do
ing things," was what made
the open meeting of Phi Beta Kappa of
unusual worth to all classes of hear
ers. The speaker, Hon. Chester A.
Rowel 1, chose as his subject, "Educa
tion and the New Democracy." He
dwelt upon the rapid evolution of
democracy in America, the changing
ideas of the people, and the import
ance of education as the only solution
of the complex problems of the New
Democracy.
