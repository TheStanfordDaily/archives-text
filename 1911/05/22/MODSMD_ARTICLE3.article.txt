# Cardinal Spirit Run Riot at Underclass Day Festivities.—Every Event Successful.
## 
### 
CARNIVAL, deafening and de
lighful, reigned on the Stan
ford Farm for a day. If those
old denizens of the track, could
but have been there, how they
would have snorted with astonishment
at the sight of the the Ross of the
Farm stripping his coat and pitching
a ball with terrific speed at a trembl
ing batsman! How they would have
opened their eyes with amazement on
seeing grave and dignified near-law
yers showering confetti upon frivolous
Freshman maids, or at the appearance
of a perambulating "damnuisance"
roaming over their green pastures.
Everyone caught the care-free spirit
Thursday and one of the most unique
and commendable of Stanford institu
tions was auspiciously inaugurated.
"I'ernde" Starts Day
Underclassman Day, Number One,
was a great success, and promises
well for the future when this year's
experience shall have taught the wax
to eliminate a few minor faults. TIip
"perade" in the morning started 0r>
day right. Led by the committee rid •
ing in a donated but dignified victoria
and wearing donated but dignified silk
hats, it passed down the row and thru
the streets of Palo Alto. The fairest
daughters of '12 all in white, riding
in state in a automobile; the fairest
daughters of '13, sweater-clad, who
required an automobile and a tally-ho
as well; the funeral procession of the
"dead sports," complete in every de
tail, under the charge of the Fresh
men of Phi Delta Theta, were features
of note. The Stanford Band in neat
marching uniform, bigger and better
than ever, received applause. Clowns
and "rubes" of every description dis
ported in the line of march, and tin 1
ghost of the "damnuisance" caused
the Daily Palo Alto's chief to reach
fiercely for the editorial pen. The
silver cup for the best entry in the
parade alone went to the "damnuis
ance," while the Varsity girls were
fittingly awarded the other cup as the
best feature of the entry day.
Seniors Win Knschnll
In the afternoon the Senior-Faculty
baseball game amused the crowds.
The Seniors won. 8 to ">, but it was i
good game all the way thru, with
none of the comedy element common
in amateur games. Doctor Jordan
pitched the first ball amid applause,
S. L. Mitchell held the indicator. The
line-ups were: Faculty. Whitaker and
Moser, pitchers; L'hamon, catcher;
Searles, first base: Angell, second
base: Moser, Millis, third base; Even
den, short stop: Townley, left field;
Millls, Whitaker. center field: I. M.
Cross, right field. Seniors, Jordan,
pitcher; St. John, catcher; Pall, first
base; Fallas, second base: Tallant,
third base; Guerena, short stop; Ford,

left field; Farnsworth, center field;
Warlow, right field. Although the ped
agogues secured 8 hits and their op
ponents 10, the box work was excel
lent throuout. Moser and L'hamon
made a particularly effective battery.
Three successive strikeouts were
credited to Moser in the fifth.
Long hits by Mi His, Searles, Hall,
and Warlow, the stop of a hot liner
by Jordan, and the effective coaching
of Dr. Angell and others of his team
were features of the game. Although
rooting was conspicuous by its ab
j sence, interest in the game was not
| lacking.
Carnival Climaxes Day
In the evening was the grand climax
jof the day—the carnival proper. The
rancorus tones of many "barkers" be
j sought the crowds of merry-makers
I to purchase their wares, the air was
| full of many-colored confetti, and en
j ticing strains of music announced
| dancing in various houses. The crowd
j was great and the carnival spirit even
more abundant. Walking up the Row,
one came upon a stand in front of the
Beta Theta Pi house where
might be purchased, good for any con
j cession on the grounds. Part of these
1 were at once expended for confetti,
and thus the coffers of the Senior
| Class were enriched. The refresh
ment concession, under the direction
of T. W. Halliday, was popular, and
( sold everything from pink lemonade
Ito "hot dogs." The proceeds from this
! source went to the Stanford Union
1 and the Women's Clubhouse. A shoot
ing gallery run by the Betas vied for
1 popularity with the egg-throwing con
cession of Delta Kappa Epsilon. B.
W. Lee as the "throwee" made an ex
-1 cellent African dodger. The Junior
1 Class entertainment was called "Hell."
! and it was. Badges giving immunity
from the "Lemon Court," of the Sen
iors were in demand, for R. J. Miller
made a most fearsom judge. The Delta
Chi fortune-telling booth was popular,
especially with the ladies, while the
Anaconda and the far-famed "Oscar"
I
lived up to expectations. Supreme
among features, however, was the
Sophomore entertainment of the Alpha
Phi house. Here each man strove for
a dance with one of the twenty two
"Varsity Girls," and between dances
was kept happy with songs and spec
ialties by talented members of the
class. Nickel dancing was also in
progress until a late hour in the Delta
Kappa Epsilon, Kappa Alpha Theta.
Kappa Alpha and Beta Theta Pi
houses.
So ended Undergraduate Day. In
spite of a few imperfections of detail
such as the fact that the parade was
moved too rapidly and in too close
order, the day was a remarkable suc
cess and adds one more feather to the
cap of 1911.
