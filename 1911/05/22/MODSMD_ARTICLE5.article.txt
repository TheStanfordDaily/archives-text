# UNDER STARRY SKIES PROM MAKES DREAMLAND OF MEMORIAL COURT
## Strolling Throngs Delighted With Band Music, Oriental Illumination, Rustic Decorations and Toothsome Refreshments.

ARCHES outlined with lights of
cardinal hue, strains of music
from the band and tinkling
melodies of mandolins gave the magic
touch necessary to transport the gaily
attired throng which paced the walks
of Memorial Court on Friday night, to
the fairyland of dreams.
Under the soft glow of countless red
colored lights and fantastic lanterns of
oriental design, the Senior Promenade
was a thing of beauty to be forever a
fond memory to the Graduating Class.
A more clement night could not
have occurred for the occasion and the
size of the crowd and the length of
the stay of the strollers bore witness
to the utter success of the 1911 Prom
enade.
A pleasing innovation was the re
striction of the affair to the Memorial
Court, instead of allowing the crowd
the liberty of the whole Inner Quad
rangle. Walls of burlap enclosed the
grass carpeted area and severed the
Memorial Court and the promenaders
from the outside world.
At the four corners of the court in
recesses built along the corridors of
the Outer and Inner Quadrangles, the
girls of the University served refresh
ments to whomsoever passed their way
Represented in these oases for the
weary were Alpha Omicron Pi, Kappa
Kappa Gamma, Delta Gamma, Alpha
Phi, Delta Delta Delta, Gamma Phi
Beta, Pi Beta Phi, Kappa Alpha Theta,
Madrona, Roble and the Alumni.
Uninterrupted music made the night
melodious and played a soft accom
paniment to the chatter of the "queen
ers," who were pressing hard the ad
vantage of this, one of their last nights
at the old college sport with which as
yet harsh rule and severe restriction
have not interfered. ,
The Stanford band, ably assisted by
the Combined Musical Clubs, furnished
the musical side of the evening's en
tertainment

Alumni and Undergraduates, Faculty
and Graduates, with parents and
friends of the Senior Class composed
the greater part of the crowd in at
tendance, but there was also inevitably
a fair share of leavening in the shape
of a numerous, more-or-less noisy
group of Palo Alto undesirables.
As the evening drew to a close, the
musicians quit their tuneful occupa
tion and the crowd gradually dwindled
away, it was the unanimous opinion,
that all gratitude is due to the Class of
1911 and especially to the Senior Prom
committee for a delightful innovation
in the characteristic Stanford function.
The committee which labored so effi
ciently and accomplished such results
was composed of Miss Natalie Feraud,
Miss Dorithy Marx, Miss Ray Hannah,
Miss Harriet Park, Geo. Bevier, E.
Ford, H. Boyd, F. H. Hilton, W. E.
Purdue, B. W. Lee, and C. E. New
man chairman.
