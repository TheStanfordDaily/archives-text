leaves under the
auspices of the Pen
insular Rail w a y
Company at half the
price. Who can say
we have not made
progress ? Harken
back if you will to
the time wh en
Tommy Thompson
was preparing the

programs of the Freshman debating
society and George Ditz fought a three
round go with Munger at the Van
couver Smoker. You may then re
member that the campus was without
gas mains, that there were no arc
lights on the Alley to "Pally," that the
boys still used carriages and flowers
at the Prom, and that the money
market was so tight that we had to
pay our room rents in cash. Despite
the statements of the heroes of the
days when spirits were served at Sen
ior Circuses and Menlo was the chief
center of good fellowship and college
conviviality, we must admit that Stan
ford's advance has been most remark
able.
1911 heard its first college yell when
Roy Kellogg and Ed Cunha called for
three for Vice-President Fairbanks.
It was here that we got the first thrill
of the Stanford Spirit from the audi
ence, at least, if not from the speaker.
Some history had been recorded be
fore this however. The Sophs, had
tubbed Mike Hilton eighteen times,
108 of us, including "Cap." Badger had
been bound hand and foot in the first
tying contest between lower classmen,
(although 1910 had to arise two or
three times from the morgue to do it),
and Ken Chamberlain had to purchase
nil the paint in Palo Alto to inscribe
our numerals on the community fences.
We heard our first real yelling, how
ever. at the Freshman football rally

before we sent our Class fifteen up to
Berkeley. Many of the drier sort i ot
their first glimpse of Lanagan anrl
Presley on this occasion. These two
famous coaches had returned from
Australia that semester where they,
together with Parmer Fuller, had
siient the summer studying the finer
points <>l rugby. Their first combined
product was captained by Daly Fletch
er, whose team included Nolan, Wood
ville, Dole, Woodcock, Evans, Visel,
Arnold, Towne, Turner, Garden. Cline.
Reed, St. John, and Brown. tins
team which met the California Fresh
men, October 12, 1907, only one man
was of age. Altho outplayed, this
band of youths showed that in their
short month and a half on the campus,
they had assimilated their share of
Stanford Fighting Spirit and were
game to the core. Floyd Brown was
the first member to make the Varsity
when he replaced Cadwalader at full
in the 21 to 11 game that semester.
It is impossible to describe our im
pressions of our first Varsity Inter
collegiate contest. It was on the fine,
warm, sunny afternoon of November
9, that we were for the first time a
vital, living part of our first red-hatted,
white-"S"ed rooting section and under
the direction of "Bun" Swift, "Ole"
Richardson and Phil Johnson cheered
"Dutch" Koerner's team to a wonder
ful victory. And then, the football
show in the evening, "The College
Widower" with twenty 1911 fraternity
Freshmen as the Beauty Chorus.
"Brad" Lee's footwork of that evening
will never be forgotten, nor will it
ever be known what fair one ensnared
his dainty footwear as it came hurtling
thru the air to the gallery. De
spite the fun of it all, the combination
of a full night's guarding the campus
from the supposed Berkeley foe at the
Big Tree and the Reservoir and the
game celebration was not conducive to
early rising Sunday.
After this, three events stand out
I vividly in our memory, namelyâ€”the
organization of the Civic League for the
protection of the campus natives. Hill,

Hilton's and Porter's representation of,
the Glass in the Interclass debute, and
the Freshman smoker in the old lodge
hall in Mayfield. This was our first
real get-together and it was a success
largely thru the efforts of Ray Wheeler
and "Cap" Badger.
During the whole of our first semes
ter,our Class destinies were presided \
over by Ray Wheeler, president, R. C.
Fleming, secretary, W. H. Cline, treas
urer, and K. L. Dole, sergeant-at-arms. j
Dole and Chamberlain ran a close race
for the latter honor at our first Class
meeting.
Despite our strenuous life of this
semester, not too many of us were
exiled from the farm at its conclusion.
Those who returned saw a very event
ful half year. As Freshmen, we could
only look on, but we kept our eyes
open and learned a number of things
which have been of considerable value
to us since. Because of that semester,
we have lived in two Stanfords. We
have seen the passing of the old
regime and Stanford metamorphose
into a new university with a different
life and a different spirit. Altho we
will always look upon the action of the
faculty at that time as being too severe,
we will at the same time indorse the
abolition of drinking and drunkenness,
which, coming when it did. has given
1911 the privilege of passing most of
its career at Stanford under greatly
improved conditions. The very fact
that the University now has and has
had during our time athletic and ad
ministrative leaders of the fine,strong
stamp of Roth, Shelton, Ditz, Dole and
Schaupp is conclusive proof that we
are today making as many Men on the
campus as they boasted of in days of
yore.
We started the semester with the
election of J. E. Thompson as Class
president. C. M. Ballard, Miss T. M.
Burke, and E. L. Coffin acted as vice
president, secretary and treasurer re
spectively. The month of January
was not far along before "Herb"
Brown was beginning to win races
from the veteran John O. Miller, with
Wyman a close third. In the Inter
collegiate meet. Brown led the point
winners with a total of 9/ points.
Wyman chalked up 2'4 tallies for the
Cardinal. In our Freshman meet, with
our team captained by Wyman, Smith
erum, Towne, Wyman, Brown, Porter,
Bevier, Boyd, Meddick. and Waring
won their Block Elevens. Shortly after
the conclusion of the season, a mon
ster rally-smoker was held in Assem
bly Hall to raise funds to send the
track team east to the Conference
meet. It was at this joyful affair that
Charlie Mason introduced the three
pugnacious Freshmen midgets. Elliott,
Mitchell, and Tallant to the Stanford
fistic world.
The 1911 Freshman crew will be re
membered as the one redeeming ath
letic team of the semester. Of all the
spring sports, Freshman rowing was
the only one accredited with a victory

over the Blue and Gold. Captained by
Dole, steered by Guerena, and stroked
by Chamberlain, the first Freshman
eight ever to row against California,
crossed the line a winner on April 25,
1908. The crew was composed of
Leeds, Visel, Tittle, Smith, Killian,
Dole, Day, Chamberlain, and Guerena.
Along about final examination week
we were again attracted to the bay by
the arrival of the great battleship
lleet under Admiral Hob Evans. A lot
of us took advantage of the holiday to
journey to the city.
1911 made her initial bow in dramat
ics by the appearance of E. L. Cofli'j and
Miss M. E. Coombe in the leading roles
of the 1909 Junior Opera "Butterfly
Isle." Eleven's entries in the Beauty
Chorus are too numerous to mention.
In the Student Body election, Porter
and Tallant were elected to the Execu
tive Committee. Since then, Wheeler,
Fletcher, Ditz, Wyman, Guerena, Dole
and Smitherum have sat on the gov
erning board.
The first semester of our Sophomore
year was started right by the complete
tie-up of 1912 after twenty-four min
utes in the Freshman-Sophomore rush.
The impassioned speeches of Thomp
son and Visel on the eve of the tre
mendous conflict still ring in our carp.
Sophomores! Sophomores!! was the
call to arms. 1912 can testify that the
call was answered.
"Brad" Lee was at the steering
wheel to succeed Thompson, with
George Bevier, Miss Adele Ehrenburg,
and R. J. Miller as vice-president, sec
retary, and treasurer respectively. It
was during their administration that
Bill Pemberton started his dance hall
in Palo Alto, that Taft and Bryan
clubs sprang into being under the
watchful eye of Craven and Horton,
that Debs was not allowed to pitch his
tent on the campus, that Dr. Jordan
first broached the idea of a graduate
school and that a chapter of Delta Del
ta Delta was installed.
Of strictly Class interest, the win
ning of the Freshman-Sophomore de
bate by Miller, Hilton, and Hopkins,
the appearance of Dole, and Evans on
the 12 to 3 Varsity fifteen, the selec
tion of a cast for "7-20-8" from 106
entries, and the Sopohmore Cotillion
| are of foremost importance. "Der
Tanz des Schmetterlings" is yet to be
excelled. More than one of the little
clothes-pin butterflys are still doing
decorative service in Encina rooms.
January to May of a Sophomore
year is always one fraught with in
tense interest. It is at this time that
the second year man is beginning to
feel his position in the University.
He walks with a surer foot, a high
held head, and enforces discipline
without compunction. 1911, as second
semester Sophomores, maintained the
tradition admirably. Shelton and Shel
ton will testify that, the fifty Sopho
mores who ate at two long tables at
the Inn were the noisiest and roughest
bunch they ever had to deal with
