Ten cents was the charge made by
Uncle John and his allied tribe when
they introduced 1911 to Stanford on

Nineteen Eleven
leaves under the
auspices of the Pen
insular Rail w a y
Company at half the
price. Who can say
we have not made
progress ? Harken
back if you will to
the time wh en
Tommy Thompson
was preparing the

programs of the Freshman debating
society and George Ditz fought a three
round go with Munger at the Van
couver Smoker. You may then re
member that the campus was without
gas mains, that there were no arc
lights on the Alley to "Pally," that the
boys still used carriages and flowers
at the Prom, and that the money
market was so tight that we had to
pay our room rents in cash. Despite
the statements of the heroes of the
days when spirits were served at Sen
ior Circuses and Menlo was the chief
center of good fellowship and college
conviviality, we must admit that Stan
ford's advance has been most remark
able.
1911 heard its first college yell when
Roy Kellogg and Ed Cunha called for
three for Vice-President Fairbanks.
It was here that we got the first thrill
of the Stanford Spirit from the audi
ence, at least, if not from the speaker.
Some history had been recorded be
fore this however. The Sophs, had
tubbed Mike Hilton eighteen times,
108 of us, including "Cap." Badger had
been bound hand and foot in the first
tying contest between lower classmen,
(although 1910 had to arise two or
three times from the morgue to do it),
and Ken Chamberlain had to purchase
nil the paint in Palo Alto to inscribe
our numerals on the community fences.
We heard our first real yelling, how
ever. at the Freshman football rally

before we sent our Class fifteen up to
Berkeley. Many of the drier sort i ot
their first glimpse of Lanagan anrl
Presley on this occasion. These two
famous coaches had returned from
Australia that semester where they,
together with Parmer Fuller, had
siient the summer studying the finer
points <>l rugby. Their first combined
product was captained by Daly Fletch
er, whose team included Nolan, Wood
ville, Dole, Woodcock, Evans, Visel,
Arnold, Towne, Turner, Garden. Cline.
Reed, St. John, and Brown. tins
team which met the California Fresh
men, October 12, 1907, only one man
was of age. Altho outplayed, this
band of youths showed that in their
short month and a half on the campus,
they had assimilated their share of
Stanford Fighting Spirit and were
game to the core. Floyd Brown was
the first member to make the Varsity
when he replaced Cadwalader at full
in the 21 to 11 game that semester.
It is impossible to describe our im
pressions of our first Varsity Inter
collegiate contest. It was on the fine,
warm, sunny afternoon of November
9, that we were for the first time a
vital, living part of our first red-hatted,
white-"S"ed rooting section and under
the direction of "Bun" Swift, "Ole"
Richardson and Phil Johnson cheered
"Dutch" Koerner's team to a wonder
ful victory. And then, the football
show in the evening, "The College
Widower" with twenty 1911 fraternity
Freshmen as the Beauty Chorus.
"Brad" Lee's footwork of that evening
will never be forgotten, nor will it
ever be known what fair one ensnared
his dainty footwear as it came hurtling
thru the air to the gallery. De
spite the fun of it all, the combination
of a full night's guarding the campus
from the supposed Berkeley foe at the
Big Tree and the Reservoir and the
game celebration was not conducive to
early rising Sunday.
After this, three events stand out
I vividly in our memory, namelyâ€”the
organization of the Civic League for the
protection of the campus natives. Hill,

Hilton's and Porter's representation of,
the Glass in the Interclass debute, and
the Freshman smoker in the old lodge
hall in Mayfield. This was our first
real get-together and it was a success
largely thru the efforts of Ray Wheeler
and "Cap" Badger.
During the whole of our first semes
ter,our Class destinies were presided \
over by Ray Wheeler, president, R. C.
Fleming, secretary, W. H. Cline, treas
urer, and K. L. Dole, sergeant-at-arms. j
Dole and Chamberlain ran a close race
for the latter honor at our first Class
meeting.
Despite our strenuous life of this
semester, not too many of us were
exiled from the farm at its conclusion.
Those who returned saw a very event
ful half year. As Freshmen, we could
only look on, but we kept our eyes
open and learned a number of things
which have been of considerable value
to us since. Because of that semester,
we have lived in two Stanfords. We
have seen the passing of the old
regime and Stanford metamorphose
into a new university with a different
life and a different spirit. Altho we
will always look upon the action of the
faculty at that time as being too severe,
we will at the same time indorse the
abolition of drinking and drunkenness,
which, coming when it did. has given
1911 the privilege of passing most of
its career at Stanford under greatly
improved conditions. The very fact
that the University now has and has
had during our time athletic and ad
ministrative leaders of the fine,strong
stamp of Roth, Shelton, Ditz, Dole and
Schaupp is conclusive proof that we
are today making as many Men on the
campus as they boasted of in days of
yore.
We started the semester with the
election of J. E. Thompson as Class
president. C. M. Ballard, Miss T. M.
Burke, and E. L. Coffin acted as vice
president, secretary and treasurer re
spectively. The month of January
was not far along before "Herb"
Brown was beginning to win races
from the veteran John O. Miller, with
Wyman a close third. In the Inter
collegiate meet. Brown led the point
winners with a total of 9/ points.
Wyman chalked up 2'4 tallies for the
Cardinal. In our Freshman meet, with
our team captained by Wyman, Smith
erum, Towne, Wyman, Brown, Porter,
Bevier, Boyd, Meddick. and Waring
won their Block Elevens. Shortly after
the conclusion of the season, a mon
ster rally-smoker was held in Assem
bly Hall to raise funds to send the
track team east to the Conference
meet. It was at this joyful affair that
Charlie Mason introduced the three
pugnacious Freshmen midgets. Elliott,
Mitchell, and Tallant to the Stanford
fistic world.
The 1911 Freshman crew will be re
membered as the one redeeming ath
letic team of the semester. Of all the
spring sports, Freshman rowing was
the only one accredited with a victory

over the Blue and Gold. Captained by
Dole, steered by Guerena, and stroked
by Chamberlain, the first Freshman
eight ever to row against California,
crossed the line a winner on April 25,
1908. The crew was composed of
Leeds, Visel, Tittle, Smith, Killian,
Dole, Day, Chamberlain, and Guerena.
Along about final examination week
we were again attracted to the bay by
the arrival of the great battleship
lleet under Admiral Hob Evans. A lot
of us took advantage of the holiday to
journey to the city.
1911 made her initial bow in dramat
ics by the appearance of E. L. Cofli'j and
Miss M. E. Coombe in the leading roles
of the 1909 Junior Opera "Butterfly
Isle." Eleven's entries in the Beauty
Chorus are too numerous to mention.
In the Student Body election, Porter
and Tallant were elected to the Execu
tive Committee. Since then, Wheeler,
Fletcher, Ditz, Wyman, Guerena, Dole
and Smitherum have sat on the gov
erning board.
The first semester of our Sophomore
year was started right by the complete
tie-up of 1912 after twenty-four min
utes in the Freshman-Sophomore rush.
The impassioned speeches of Thomp
son and Visel on the eve of the tre
mendous conflict still ring in our carp.
Sophomores! Sophomores!! was the
call to arms. 1912 can testify that the
call was answered.
"Brad" Lee was at the steering
wheel to succeed Thompson, with
George Bevier, Miss Adele Ehrenburg,
and R. J. Miller as vice-president, sec
retary, and treasurer respectively. It
was during their administration that
Bill Pemberton started his dance hall
in Palo Alto, that Taft and Bryan
clubs sprang into being under the
watchful eye of Craven and Horton,
that Debs was not allowed to pitch his
tent on the campus, that Dr. Jordan
first broached the idea of a graduate
school and that a chapter of Delta Del
ta Delta was installed.
Of strictly Class interest, the win
ning of the Freshman-Sophomore de
bate by Miller, Hilton, and Hopkins,
the appearance of Dole, and Evans on
the 12 to 3 Varsity fifteen, the selec
tion of a cast for "7-20-8" from 106
entries, and the Sopohmore Cotillion
| are of foremost importance. "Der
Tanz des Schmetterlings" is yet to be
excelled. More than one of the little
clothes-pin butterflys are still doing
decorative service in Encina rooms.
January to May of a Sophomore
year is always one fraught with in
tense interest. It is at this time that
the second year man is beginning to
feel his position in the University.
He walks with a surer foot, a high
held head, and enforces discipline
without compunction. 1911, as second
semester Sophomores, maintained the
tradition admirably. Shelton and Shel
ton will testify that, the fifty Sopho
mores who ate at two long tables at
the Inn were the noisiest and roughest
bunch they ever had to deal with


L. L. HILL
Class Historian
Class tables at that epicurean center
have been abolished since that time.
Along with this growing Class spirit.
Class politics were at their highest
pitch. Machines squeaked on every
side. Out of the 259 on Eleven's roles,
246 voted at the Quad election, a total
that we have never reached since..
Likewise we boosted our Sophomore
Comedy to the greatest financial suc
cess known at Stanford. It was thru
this that our "Tommy" got his start,
and became thereby a national figure.
1911 owes Thompson a great debt of
gratitude for what he did for us at that
time and since then as well. By orig
inating the Class Jolly-up, he has
started a permanent tradition that has
meant more to us as a Class and to the
University than any other thing for
which we stand sponsor.
"7-20-8" as played by Miss Estelle
Porter and Walter Pittenger in the
leading roles, supported by Miss Glea
son, Miss Wilson, and Miss Sampson,
and Woodville, Christin, Chamberlain,
Higgins and Wlieaton was up to tho
general high average of Sophomore
plays and met with popular favor, Of
this cast, Walter Pittenger is the only
one who has not been with as a Senior
The untimely death of this beloved
classmate is the one sorrowing note of
our History. 1911 misses Walter Pit
tenger.
When the final expense account of
"7-20-8" was compiled, it contained one
item which occupies a unique position
among historical disbursements. That
was an item of thirty dollars brought
against the Class by the municipality
of Palo Alto. Palo Alto got the thirty
dollars, but "7-20-8" got four times
that in free advertising and four bud
ding lawyers got a glimpse of the life
of the men in whose freedom or lack of
freedom they are soon to traffic in.
Frank Howard Hilton was the pres
ident during this lively semester. W.
M. Wyman as vice-president, Mis 5
Anita McLachlan as secretary and W.
R. Pittenger as treasurer, completed
the roster of officers. Hilton was not
the only orator-maximus in college at
that time, however. Mercer paid his
first visit then, Ambassador James
Bryce spoke at an afternoon Assembly,
Hoover launched the Stanford Union
boom at another Assembly, and Upton
Sinclair addressed Bliven's Socialist
Club. It was then that the Board of
Trustees finally started razing the
Memorial Church, the winery was pro

i posed as a Freshman dormitory., tho
j Museum was re-opened, the Cooper
Keith trophy won from Vancouver, and
i the old "flunk-out" system abolished.
We saw Dole, Killian, Chamberlain.
Day, and Guerena on the winning 1909
! Varsity crew, Wyman and Cline among
j the point winners of the Intercollegiate
1 meet, Miss Bazet and Miss Coombe in
the Junior Opera, F. E. Hill, an alter
nate on the Intercollegiate debating
team, and Miss Sampson, Miss Haig.
xMiss L. Woodliead and Miss F. Wood
head on the first winning basketball
team in the history of the University,
i Floyd Drown returned this semester
and played full against the Wallabies.
Our Class continued to make ath
letic history during the summer as
well, when Ivillan, Day, and Guerena
were members of the Pacific Coast
championship crew which rowed on
Lake Washington, and Wyman placed
in the quarter in the Conference meet
at Chicago. Wyman, on his return,
was honored by election to the Class
presidency. J. A. Visel, Miss Helen
Ely, and H. G. Ferguson held the re
maining offices.
The semester started auspiciously by
sixty members of the Class going out
for rugby. J. E. Thompson appeared
during the season for the first time as
a Varsity yell leader. Dole and Drown
were 1911's representatives on the Var
sity fifteen.
About a week before the Rig Game,
came the presentation of that prize
production of the clever pens of
Bliven, Knight, and Hopkins, "Steer
ing the Bull." Those who went thru
that rush, who captured the Seniors,
and took part in tho thrilling auto
race hardly blame the faculty for de
manding a new style Plug Ugly.
In more legitimate drama, the Jun
iors showed to better advantage, when
Miss Porter, Woodville, Chamberlain,
| Hilton and Christin appeared in
; "Twelfth Night." The latter, with
Kobbe, appeared in the "Chimes of
Normandy." Kobbe together with Miss
I Wilson and Miss Ely were in the cast
of the "Road to Yesterday." F. L.
Guerena as seen in an open air lawn
j fete along about this time when he
I took the part of a Captain in the "1910
! Rugby Burlesque." Miller qualified
for a role in the "Millionaires" by win
ning a pile in the Bonnheim and the
Peace Prize contests.
Miller came into his greatest prom
inence, however, upon registration

(lay of the following semester when the
Sequoia had an unprecedented sale.
His torrid pen lifted the lid off of
things in general and gave us the live
liest semester of our career. Every
one from the Quadrangle Club to the
Plain Stanford Man got terribly ex
cited before Glendenning had paid the
last of the linotyper's bill.
Speaking seriously, however, we be
lieve that conditions have been better
at Stanford since last year's dispute.
The spirit of the University and the at
titude of one man to another has been
fairer and broader-gauged. We have
paid closer attention to public affairs.
One could hardly ask for a more united
or a better spirited Student Body than
we now have. Nor did the disturbance
seriously interfere with the progress
of affairs of that semester, as it was
predicted it would at the time. We
made a clean sweep in track, crew and
baseball; we made the Stanford Union
a surety, (largely thru the support of
1911 it may be added); we sent a track
team which tied for first honors at the
Conference Meet, and our best rugby
men represented Stanford in the Anti
podes on the greatest athletic invasion
ever made by American universities.
As Juniors we contributed Wyman
and Taylor to the Conference team
and Dole and Brown to the Ail-Amer
ican rugby fifteen. Wyman, Dole, Tay
lor, Porter, and Tallant were point
winners in the Intercollegiate track
meet, and Miller was a member of the
Carnot debating team. Miss Sampson,
Miss Bland, Miss Piggott, Miss Haig
Miss Li. Woodhead and Miss F. Wood
bead made the basketball team prac
tically a Junior organization.
1911 as a Class, was as successful as
was the University as a whole. We
won the Tnterclass baseball champion
ship with a team composed of Tiede
mann, captain, St. John, Swigart, Peck,
Langfitt, Carraher, Goode, Watermann,
Small, Farnsworth and Boyd. The
Junior Day regatta also went to 1911
as well as the Marathon with Porter
as our team captain. The Eleven Prom,
with Ferguson as committee chair
man, was the most successful dance
ever given at Stanford; the tradition
of starting Junior Week with evening
festivities was another of our numer
ous innovations; "Tolanthe" was one
of the most spectacular of operas; the
1911 Quad, managed by C. A. Christin,
and edited by L. L. Hill, had the larg
est sale of any Stanford annual.

F. L. Guereua as president with E.
C. Matthias as vice-president, Miss
Daisy Gleason as secretary, and K.
Chamberlain as treasurer, were at the
head of affairs during this highly suc
cessful period.
The semester closed with the elec
tion of George Ditz as Student Body
president, J. E. Thompson as secre
tary, and Wyman and Smitherum as
members of the Executive Committee.
Ferguson was appointed as editor of
the Daily Palo Alto to succeed Fuller.
Shortly before this, announcement was
made that everyone must pay an en
trance fee of fifteen dollars the follow
ing semester.
Those of us who could raise the
necessary fifteen simoleons came back
in quest of sombreros and caps and
gowns at least, if not diplomas. We
have now completed that quest. Our
career as a Class is drawing to a close.
The last year of it has been an ex
tremely busy one. Between a raised
scholarship standard and the respon
sibility of student leadership, we have
had but little time to ourselves. Our
scholarship records and the attain
ments of our leaders show that we
have not in the least shirked our
duty. The records stand at the top of
the list, the attainments speak for
themselves. We have been fortunate
in having two active men, Dole and
Ferguson, as our Class presidents.
Ditz has proven himself a hard work
ing, imaginative, result-getting Student
Body president, Thompson has made a
wide-awake, original yell leader, Dole
has been the most widely respected
football captain since we entered Stan
ford, Ball did all that was possible
against great obstacles to turn out a
winning baseball team, Matthias and
Bliven have edited brilliant Chaparrals.
Frank Hill has maintained a Sequoia
of high literary value, H. G. Ferguson
and L. L. Hill, have kept the Daily
Palo Alto up to its usual standard.
Knight has so successfully led the
musical organizations that they have
been granted their first trip in years,
Stark has led a band which at least
excells the California musicians. Miller
and Hilton have been the premier de
baters. The latter won the Bonnheim
contest and instituted the Tri-State
Debating League. Cap and Gown, with
Miss Mildred Hayes for its president
and with the Misses Campbell, Stein
beck, Park, Porter, Wilson, Haig, Ely,
Williams, Hanna, Sampson, Feraufl
and Horton among its members has
taken active leadership among the
women. Miss Hayes, last semester
edited the first women's edition of the
Daily Palo Alto since 1903. Miss Camp
bell as president of the Women's
League has directed the necessary re
organization of that body. The Senior
women have made possible a women's
boat club, and have kept alive the in
terest in basketball despite its loss of
Intercollegiate standing. Miss Flor
ence Allen has won the University
championship in tennis for two years
and has lead the Intercollegiate teams.
In football, Brown and Dole again
appeared on the Varsity fifteen, Smith
erum, Taylor, Waring, and Cramer
were point winners in the Intercol
legiate meet, Guerena again coxwained
a winning crew and largely thru his
efforts, rowing has again been put on
an Intercollegiate basis. Ball got the
highest fielding average in baseball.
Frank Hill won the Edward Bedwick
Peace Prize, Miss Hanna, Miss Hill,
Miss Shaw, Rockwood and Matthias
are new names in dramatics, and Miss
Stuart, Miss Bell, Miss Clark, Miss
Porter, Miss Westwick, Miss Wood
head, Miss Birch, Miss White, Ditz, F.
E. Hill, Hollmann, LaGrange, Miller,
Newcomer, Peck, Pugh, Hatfield and
Wolff have been elected to Phi Beta
Kappa. Upon Ferguson, Ditz, Miss
Fowle and Miss Gleason has been given
the significant duty of decorating the
Stanford Tomb. Swafford has taken
care of the financial matters of the
Class and it is largely thru his able
management that wo are presenting
the attractive Senior Week that we
are. 1911, in making the festivity at
tractive to the underclassmen and
transforming it into a general Univer
sity Week, is starting another one of
its numerous traditions of incalculable
benefit to the University.
And now that our remaining hours
together on the old farm are but a
precious few, let us take final stock
and see what we have as a Class to
start out into the larger world with,
In the first place we are united. There
is no factional feeling in the Class.
We have a proper amount of self-con
fidence, born of the successes we have
achieved. All of our general projects,
our plays, our dances, our publications,
and our jolly-ups have set enviable
standards. We have a realization of
our own powers. We know that we
have not been a strong Class athleti
cally, but we know that we have ex
celled in other lines. We know that
the most active members of the Class
are numbered among the best stu
dents. There are few drones in the
1911 hive and the work we have ac
complished has tangible results. These
Senior workers represent the Univer
sity ideal. They are of a different
stamp than were in control when we
came to this University. We leave a
better Stanford than we entered.
And so let it be said in conclusion,
that life on the Stanford Farm is now
more wholesome, and more inspiring,
than it was but a few years ago. There
is better feeling, and a more intelligent
understanding between faculty and
student, there is a better fueling and a
higher type of comradship between
students. Reason and common sense
now prevail over prejudice and mis
understanding. A saner attitude gives
up a broader and a clearer outlook.
As a natural result of all this, let it
be fervently hoped that no Eleven man
will censure and abuse his Alma Mater
as some of our prominent alumni are
doing now. Our idea of loyalty is of a
different kind. We have gained our
strongest life assets during our four
years stay on the Stanford Farm and
we intend to repay the University the
debt we owe her. Our love for Stan
ford is unbounded. Our last week here
together will be one of the pleasantest
memories of our lives. The everlast
ing ties of deepest friendship we are
soon to break are only figuratively
severed. In 1911 and in Stanford we
are forever and forever One.
