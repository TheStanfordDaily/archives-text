# LINER WAITS AT HONOLULU WHILE DR. JORDAN SPEAKS
## 
### 
An unusual courtesy was extended
to President David Starr Jordan by the
officials of the Maru Steamship line,
when the Chaiyo Maru sailed from
San Francisco on August 9, with the
President and Mrs. Jordan on the
passenger list. Dr. Jordan was
scheduled to speak in Honolulu on
his arrival there on the subject of
"International Peace." In order that
he might make the address the of
ficials of the company announced that
the big liner would be held in port at
Honolulu overnight instead of sail
ing the evening of arrival as the regu
lations call for.
Dr. Jordan left for the Orient with
the express purpose of delivering a
series of lectures in Japan, Korea, and
China with world peace as his topic.
The itinerary as arranged calls for
the principle stops in Japan. The
President will speak in Tokyo in a
series of addresses. He will talk in
other important Japanese centers. By
special invitation from the authorities
he is to cross over to Korea for
several lectures. China will also be
visited. The President and Mrs. Jor
dan expect to reach this country on
the return trip on October 27.
Dr. Jordan will remain at the Uni
versity for a few days after his arrival
when he will start for the east. There
he will further promote the cause of
peace and disarmament through the

million dollar Ginn foundation, of
which he is chairman. During this
time his headquarters are to be in
Boston.
This trip to the Orient and the trip
east form the second half of the presi
dent's year of sabbatical leave. Up
to this time he has had no vacation
since 1880 other than various trips
in connection with his work on the
International Fisheries Commis
sion.
Before his departure Dr. Jordan
made statements to representatives
of the press in regard to the recent
treaties of general arbitration signed
by Great Britain, France, and the Uni
ted States. At that time the President
expressed it as his opinion that the
treaties were the greatest step toward
the cause of universal peace that had
been taken in the world with the
possible exception of the first Hague
tribunal. He further expressed the
opinion that other countries would not
be long in joining the compact. The
President believes that Germany and
Japan will soon open up negotiations
with other European nations and with
the United States for the signing of
similar treaties.
"These treaties" he said, "are the
greatest achievement of the Taft ad
ministration without any exception.
They will be universal in their signi
ficance."
