# A 						Larger Paper
## 
### 
For the first time in nineteen years
the Daily Palo Alto publishes a larger
paper in a regular issue. Today we

have five columns, and
hope to make the change
permanent. This, of course,
depends upon how the

students and alumni support us in

subscribing, as well as the merchants
in advertising. We particularly ask
each individual student to subscribe
and not depend upon his neighbor or
friend for his news. That is the only
way we can keep up a larger Daily,
and we must work together. No long
er can anyone look sidewise at the
advertisements and ask, '"Where is
the reading matter?" Will you help
us to continue this condition?
