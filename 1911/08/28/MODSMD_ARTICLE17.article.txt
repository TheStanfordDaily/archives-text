# DR.J.C. BRANNER OBTAINS MANY RARE SPECIMENS
## Trip to South America During Summer Adds Much Valuable Material to University Collection. 
### 
Whe' the specimens collected by
the recent Stanford zoological expe
dition to Brazil under the direction of
Dr. J. C. Branner, of the Department
of Geology and Mining, are mounted
and placed upon exhibition, the uni
versity collections from this section
of South America will be unexcelled.
The professors who made up the
expedition are not yet prepared to
announce the results, in fact some of
the most valuable specimens obtained
will not be known until their classi
fication is completed and the reports
prepared.
With the exception of Dr. Fred
Baker of San Diego and W..W. Mann,
'11, of Helena, Montana, who left the
central expedition for a trip up the
Amazon and its tributaries, all the
members have returned.
Dr. Baker and Mann were last
heard from on the Madora river, a
letter to Prof. H. Heath stating that
they intended to follow up the Mamore
river, a tributary of the Madora, in
the remote interior, about one thou
sand miles from the coast.
The expedition, under the leader
ship of Dr. Branner. was composed
of Professors Heath, E. C. Starks,
O. P. Jenkins, and C. Branner, Lieb,
Dr. Baker and Mann. Sailing from
New York in April, the party made
Natal on the northwest coasta. This
was to be the outfitting point, with
Natal on the northwest coast. This
Dr. Branner made a short indepen
dent trip to Bahia soon after the first

landing was made. Because of his
llong acquaintance Ifrazil, he
thoroughly systemized the work in
plans before the expedition was started
and not an accident or hitch occured
to disturb the arrangements.
On the sea voyage going, rough
weather was encountered off Cape
Hatteras and all members of the par
ty retired to their berths, not because
their equilibrium was disturbed, it is
stated, but because the scenery prov
ed uninteresting.
The region penetrated on the north
west caoast is dry and warm, some*
what like the cimate of Arizona and
the fauna is of the same general
character. The expedition made a
thorough geological and zoological
survey of the country visited and nu
merous cases of specimens collected
are being unpacked.
Dr. Branner acted as director-gen
eral of the entire expedition, the com
plete success of which is largely due
to his able management, and super
intended personally, the geological sur
vey. Prof. Starks was official photo
grapher and assembled the fish col
lecting on the trip. Prof. Heath de
voted his efforts largely to gathering
repticles. He also had charge of gen
eral zoology specimens gathered. Dr.
Baker directed his energies on the
main expedition in amassing a col
lection of mollusks and shells. George
Branner, Mann and Lieb served as'
assistants in the different branches of
the work.
