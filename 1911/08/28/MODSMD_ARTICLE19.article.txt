# College Notes.

### 
Yale is to have no more paid coaches
in rowing. She will use the graduate
coaching system so popular in foot
ball. A meeting of captains of eights
for several years back met and agreed
upon a committee.
The faculty of Wesleyan Univer
sity, Massachusetts, has voted that,
beginning in the fall of 1912, no fresh
man will be allowed to participate in
intercollegiate athletics of any kind.
