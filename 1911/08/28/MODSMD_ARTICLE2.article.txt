# NINE VARSITY PLAYERS RETURN FOR SEASON
## 
### 
Rugby is about to take the center
of the stage and prospects as to the
results of the struggle in November
on the Stanford turf seem bright with
the return of nine winners of the "S"
on last season's fifteen. These men
are now on the campus and will don
their togs at the opening of the pig
skin season next Monday. In addition
to them there are veterans who did
not play last year and many plucky
fighters from second team ranks, who
are available.
The football contribution of the
incoming 1915 class is, of course, an
unknown quantity. But even here
hopes are high when they offer such
men as B. Risling, Hutchinson and
Edwin Clark. Risling is well known
to the Cardinal rooters as a consistent
performer on the five-eights line on
the well-trained fifteen from Palo
Alto High School last season. Hutch
inson was a member of this team and
captained it from the position of full
and proved himself a heady player.
Clark was the captain of the star
line-up which the Los Angeles High
School sent into the field in 1910 and
played among the backs.
The biggest gap left in last fall's
Varstiy to be filled will be in the
pack. The giant, side-rankers Dole
and Olmstead are practically sure to
butress the scrum again this year,
and Frank and W. L. Smith will form
the rear-rank mainstay, but the front
rank is void of veterans. Substitute
A. Sanborn is a hard worker and may
fill Cheda's place. Schaupp and Part
ridge are both near Varsity men,
since both played over half of last
season with big team, until injuries
forced them out. Gard, W. L. Smith
and Lull also loom well up among the
list of possibilities. Baumgartner
should make a hard fight for his old
place in the pack if he appears on
Registration Day. Other class and
second team men may make a show
ing.
Woodcock has had experience in
the position left vacant by Sundell
He may not return, however. Boul
ware, also, will make a strong bid
as a roamer.
The backfield positions that are left
vacated were those held by Mitchell
and Thoburn at center three-quarters
and right wing, respectively; but
several veterans are ready to step
into these places, among them T.

Sanborn and Worswick. The back
field returning men are: Erb at half,
Harrigan and Reeves at five-eights,
Geissler at wing and Brown at full.
But Kern is almost a surety for one
of the wing places. Cass, of the 1909
Varsity is available as an experienced
substitute for Captain Erb, if Erb
should be shifted further back.
King plans to be out in togs ready
for a try for a backfield position. The
Freshmen; Risling, Clark and Hutch
inson will stand a strong show for a
tryout in case of any backfield shift.
Rugby will be given its official start
in the Encina Clubroom next Friday
evening. S. Ivepnedy, '12, yell leader,
will begin the evening's enthusiasm
with Stanford yells and songs. The
best rally speakers on the Campus
are on the carpet for talks.
At the close of the rally rugby
candidates sign up for practice.
Coach Presley will return to the cam
pus for his duties next Thursday.
His time at present is well taken up
with duties as an attorney in San
Francisco.
