# NINE VARSITY PLAYERS RETURN FOR SEASON
## 
### 
Rugby is about to take the center
of the stage and prospects as to the
results of the struggle in November
on the Stanford turf seem bright with
the return of nine winners of the "S"
on last season's fifteen. These men
are now on the campus and will don
their togs at the opening of the pig
skin season next Monday. In addition
to them there are veterans who did
not play last year and many plucky
fighters from second team ranks, who
are available.
The football contribution of the
incoming 1915 class is, of course, an
unknown quantity. But even here
hopes are high when they offer such
men as B. Risling, Hutchinson and
Edwin Clark. Risling is well known
to the Cardinal rooters as a consistent
performer on the five-eights line on
the well-trained fifteen from Palo
Alto High School last season. Hutch
inson was a member of this team and
captained it from the position of full
and proved himself a heady player.
Clark was the captain of the star
line-up which the Los Angeles High
School sent into the field in 1910 and
played among the backs.
The biggest gap left in last fall's
Varstiy to be filled will be in the
pack. The giant, side-rankers Dole
and Olmstead are practically sure to
butress the scrum again this year,
and Frank and W. L. Smith will form
