"I'll give joii live dollars for a dollar."
That is what the Associated Students are offering to every stu
dent in the university this year through the season ticket plan. The
tickets are now on sale on the Inner (Juad near the Keiristrai s
office. The cost of the tickets is three dollars. They serve a double
purpose. Sot only do they admit the holder to every game played on
the campus this semester with the exception of the Hip Game and
Inter-state games but they cover the usual Student Body assessment
of two dollars as well.
This means that every holder of a ticket may witness every pre
punitory game of the semester for the sum of one dollar. It is esti
mated that this sum averages at least four dollars si semester per
student under the old plan.
This is the lirst time that this scheme lias been tried at Stanford
although most of the Eastern universities and the I niversity of Cali
fornia employ a similar method, The originators of the plan
believe that it will as successful here as it has been in any other
university.
The advantages of the plan are many. The cost of attending
athletic games and meets is reduced to considerably less than
one half of what it used to amount to. Last year there were
twenty-six games and meets held on the Campus. The season
ticket for the year amounts to five dollars. Deducting the cost of
assessments at three dollars leaves the cost of seeing practically
every athletic contest of the year for two dollars.
In order to bring the tickets within the reach of all. Graduate
Manager Bnrbank has decided to divide them Into semesters.
The ticket for the first semester will sell at three dollars and that for
the second at two.
If the students take proper hold of the plan those in charge feel
that it will mean a greater attendance at games and a correspond
inglv greater spirit.
