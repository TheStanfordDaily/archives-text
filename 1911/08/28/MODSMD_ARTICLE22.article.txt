# GENERAL ITEMS IN BRIEF
## Notes gathered from College Journals, Daily Newspapers, etc. 
### 
The Yale-Harvard combination of
track athletes was defeated by the
Oxford-Cambridge team In London
last July. The Englishmen won five
out of nine. They took the hammer
throw, the quarter, the mile, the two
mile, and the century. America cap
tured the low hurdles, the half, the
high jump, and the broad jump. Each
nation had won two meets of a similar
character and this one was in the na
ture of a rubber contest. No records
were broken. *
There is a split in football relations
among the southern California col
leges. U. S. C. plays rugby this year
and four others are in American foot
ball still, these being Occidental,
Pomona, Whittier, and the University
of Redlauds. Says the Los Angeles
Times: "It is probable that within
two or three years that" the four last,
named "will adopt rugby . . . and then
all will combine in another confer
ence. . . . "That rugby will crowd the
old game completely off the Coast map
is more than probable. . . . When
Stanford and California adopted the
English game five years ago they
stood alone. Followers of the old
game asserted that the northern uni
versities would continue to stand
alone. But gradually it began to
make inroads, and . . . now compara
tively few high schools and colleges
play the American game."
