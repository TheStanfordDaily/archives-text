# THE 						PASSING OF MENLO
## 
### 
Menlo is no more.
After three solid years of litigation
through all the courts of the State
the case of the saloon keepers Avas
passed upon by the Supreme Court.
On July 1 it was declaretLVby that
body that the Menlo liquor houses
came under the mile and a half law.
And with that decision passed one of
the historic spots of Stanford that
had been chronicled in song and story
for almost a fifth of a century, since
the first student walked the arcades.
Some three of four years ago a
California legislature passed an act
making it unlawful for any person to
keep a saloon or liquor house within
one mile and a half of a university
campus. Under this act the estate
brought suit against the Menlo deal
ers. When the case came up for
trial in one of the lower courts the
saloon keepers set up as their defense

i that the dramshops of Menlo were
within one mile and a half of the Stan
ford estate, but not of the campus
proper. They argued that the con
fines of the estate were like any other
of the University's properties: that
it was merely a holding and that the
campus as such was confined to that
area immediately surrounding the
Quad. It devolved upon this lower
court to decide whether all property
owned by and immediately adjacent
i to the university buildings, although
not used regularly by the students to
reach the university and not occupied
by buildings, could be classed as the
campus. The lower court decided in
favor of the saloon keeper's claims.
The case was appealed and argued
through all the courts until the final
decision of July 12, which states that
the confines of the estate form the
limits of the campus.

Immediately following the decision
deputy sheriffs started for Menlo and
closed up the twelve saloons of the
place. One of the..lost notorious of
the owners was placed in jail for a
day or so, when he was released. No
further suits have come of the cases.
And Menlo is no more.
Rumor has it that a Stanford club
in the vicinity of Ptiget Sound, when
they heard of the demise of Charley
Meyers' well-known resort got up a
purse of $5000 to purchase two of the
table-tops bearing the most noted
names of early Stanford history. Ru
mor also has it that the offer was
refused. It also forgot to mention
just what Meyers was going to do
with his tables after he refused the
offers. Be that as it may, Menlo is
no more and the second verse of the
"Gambolier" song cannot be sung
withou thyprocrisy.


One of the famous Meyers' Table Tops. They have been called the"Heal Stanford Register."
