# TOUR OF COMBINED CLUBS AN UNQUALIFIED SUCCESS
## Cover Five Thousand Miles and Give Thirteen Concerts—Well Received at all Points. 
### 
Stanford music and song were scat
tered over twenty-five hundred miles
of railway on the Santa Fe lines to
Chicago this summer by forty members
of the Stanford Glee and Mandolin
Clubs. The tour was one that had
been hanging in the air during three
years. Permission to take it had been
refused the Clubs each summer. He
cause of the conscientious work last
year and their evident desire to com
ply with the rules of the university
the two organizations were given the
necessary permit.
Thirteen concerts were given in less
than two weeks at the more impor
tant establishments of tl\e Harvey
Eating Houses and halls along the
lines of the Santa Fe. These were
attended by largs audiences of em
ployees of the transcontinental line
and friends of the clubs, as well as
alumni. In all their entertainments
the musicians created much friendly
feeling for Stanford and themselves
as representatives of the university.
They were given hearty welcomes
/wherever they stopped. Besides a
high grade of music the clubs left a
good, healty impression of Stanford
spirit of gentlemanly conduct all along
the road.
At one place, Clovis, New Mexico,
they were given a royal welcome. The
mayor of the town had prepared a
huge banner, bearing the words,
"Welcome, Stanford." This was the
first, thing that greeted the eyes of the
Stanford travelers as they left their
private car at the station. A dozen
or so automobiles then gave them a
good idea of what a live town Clovis
was, and they enjoyed it.
Another enjoyable side trip was
made to the Grand Canyon on the
second day from San Francisco. Here
they viewed the great chasm a,nd
woke up the echoes with Stanford
songs, and music.
At Canadian, Texas, a baseball nine
was made up from the forty men avail
able and the railroad employees were
met in a contest, that furthered the
good will of the journey.
The members of the two clubs
assembled at Point Richmond across
the Bay from San Francisco on the
night of May 22. A special Pullman
car had been given by the Santa Fe,
and in that they were to make their
home for two weeks. They were to
have meals served in dining cars and
the famous Harvey Eating Houses.
All speak with special enthusiasm ot
this part of the trip.
The first concert was given the night
of May 22 at Richmond. It was well
received and augured a successful
tour. Albright's cartoons were es
pecially appreciated. The evening's
entertainment was shortened some
what to enable the Stanford car to be
attached to the fast California Lim
ited preparatory to the long pull
through the valley and over the hot
Mojave desert.
The Needles concert was given the
next night, followed by one at Willi
ams and the Grand Canyon. Gallup,
New Mexico, was reached on the 2!),
and Albuquerque on the 26. Clovis
came next. Winfield, Vaughn and
Amarillo were successful. The last
three concerts were given in Cana
dian, Texas; Arkansas City, Arkan
sas. and Chillicote. Indiana.
Chicago, the end of the journey,
saw the men June 5, tired but happy.
They all attended a banquet given to
them in the evening. Then the forty
separated. Some came back to the
the Pacific Coast. Others invaded the
East and South, and one or two of
the party took the trip across the At
lantic. All are loud in their apprecia
tion of the treatment given them by
the Santa Fe and its officials. And
the feeling was returned by the San
ta Fe. Superintendent Busser of the
Harvey Eating Houses told them in a
speech at Chillicote that never before

had he seen college clubs who behav
ed themselves as the Stanford men had
done. He also congratulated them
upon the standard of music they up
held and was enthusiastic over their
programs. The big railroad is anxi
ous to make the tour an annual affair.
Resides the two clubs, the Glee and
Mandolin, who shared equally in num
bers, several specialty acts were in
cluded in the program each night.
These were: a 'cello solo by G. O.
Wilson, '14; a chalk talk by E. M.
Albright, ex-'l2, and a four-man skit
by W. Wilson, '13, J. H. Forbes, *13,
V. W. McCourt, '14, and E. E. Chase,
ex-'ll. The skit was opened by Wil
son with one of his Yiddish mono
logues.
The combined Clubs met in Chicago
before disbanding for a business meet
ing. In order to manage the Clubs
at the beginning of this year a com
mittee was appointed. This is com
posed of A. J. Hall, '13, W. S. Wilson,
'13, and F. H. Forbes, '13. The Man
dolin Club at a similar meeting elect
ed A. J. Hall, '13, leader for the com
ing year, and W. S. Wilson, '13, mana

elected later. The Glee Club held no
elections.

Stanford music and song were scat
tered over twenty-five hundred miles
of railway on the Santa Fe lines to
Chicago this summer by forty members
of the Stanford Glee and Mandolin
Clubs. The tour was one that had
been hanging in the air during three
years. Permission to take it had been
refused the Clubs each summer. He
cause of the conscientious work last
year and their evident desire to com
ply with the rules of the university
the two organizations were given the
necessary permit.
Thirteen concerts were given in less
than two weeks at the more impor
tant establishments of tl\e Harvey
Eating Houses and halls along the
lines of the Santa Fe. These were
attended by largs audiences of em
ployees of the transcontinental line
and friends of the clubs, as well as
alumni. In all their entertainments
the musicians created much friendly
feeling for Stanford and themselves
as representatives of the university.
They were given hearty welcomes
/wherever they stopped. Besides a
high grade of music the clubs left a
good, healty impression of Stanford
spirit of gentlemanly conduct all along
the road.
At one place, Clovis, New Mexico,
they were given a royal welcome. The
mayor of the town had prepared a
huge banner, bearing the words,
"Welcome, Stanford." This was the
first, thing that greeted the eyes of the
Stanford travelers as they left their
private car at the station. A dozen
or so automobiles then gave them a
good idea of what a live town Clovis
was, and they enjoyed it.
Another enjoyable side trip was
made to the Grand Canyon on the
second day from San Francisco. Here
they viewed the great chasm a,nd
woke up the echoes with Stanford
songs, and music.
At Canadian, Texas, a baseball nine
was made up from the forty men avail
able and the railroad employees were
met in a contest, that furthered the
good will of the journey.
The members of the two clubs
assembled at Point Richmond across
the Bay from San Francisco on the
night of May 22. A special Pullman
car had been given by the Santa Fe,
and in that they were to make their
home for two weeks. They were to
have meals served in dining cars and
the famous Harvey Eating Houses.
All speak with special enthusiasm ot
this part of the trip.
The first concert was given the night
of May 22 at Richmond. It was well
received and augured a successful
tour. Albright's cartoons were es
pecially appreciated. The evening's
entertainment was shortened some
what to enable the Stanford car to be
attached to the fast California Lim
ited preparatory to the long pull
through the valley and over the hot
Mojave desert.
The Needles concert was given the
next night, followed by one at Willi
ams and the Grand Canyon. Gallup,
New Mexico, was reached on the 2!),
and Albuquerque on the 26. Clovis
came next. Winfield, Vaughn and
Amarillo were successful. The last
three concerts were given in Cana
dian, Texas; Arkansas City, Arkan
sas. and Chillicote. Indiana.
Chicago, the end of the journey,
saw the men June 5, tired but happy.
They all attended a banquet given to
them in the evening. Then the forty
separated. Some came back to the
the Pacific Coast. Others invaded the
East and South, and one or two of
the party took the trip across the At
lantic. All are loud in their apprecia
tion of the treatment given them by
the Santa Fe and its officials. And
the feeling was returned by the San
ta Fe. Superintendent Busser of the
Harvey Eating Houses told them in a
speech at Chillicote that never before

had he seen college clubs who behav
ed themselves as the Stanford men had
done. He also congratulated them
upon the standard of music they up
held and was enthusiastic over their
programs. The big railroad is anxi
ous to make the tour an annual affair.
Resides the two clubs, the Glee and
Mandolin, who shared equally in num
bers, several specialty acts were in
cluded in the program each night.
These were: a 'cello solo by G. O.
Wilson, '14; a chalk talk by E. M.
Albright, ex-'l2, and a four-man skit
by W. Wilson, '13, J. H. Forbes, *13,
V. W. McCourt, '14, and E. E. Chase,
ex-'ll. The skit was opened by Wil
son with one of his Yiddish mono
logues.
The combined Clubs met in Chicago
before disbanding for a business meet
ing. In order to manage the Clubs
at the beginning of this year a com

pecially appreciated. The evening's
entertainment was shortened some
what to enable the Stanford car to be
attached to the fast California Lim
ited preparatory to the long pull
through the valley and over the hot
Mojave desert.
The Needles concert was given the
next night, followed by one at Willi
ams and the Grand Canyon. Gallup,
New Mexico, was reached on the 2!),
and Albuquerque on the 26. Clovis
came next. Winfield, Vaughn and
Amarillo were successful. The last
three concerts were given in Cana
dian, Texas; Arkansas City, Arkan
sas. and Chillicote. Indiana.
Chicago, the end of the journey,
saw the men June 5, tired but happy.
They all attended a banquet given to
them in the evening. Then the forty
separated. Some came back to the
the Pacific Coast. Others invaded the
East and South, and one or two of
the party took the trip across the At
lantic. All are loud in their apprecia
tion of the treatment given them by
the Santa Fe and its officials. And
the feeling was returned by the San
ta Fe. Superintendent Busser of the
Harvey Eating Houses told them in a
speech at Chillicote that never before

had he seen college clubs who behav
ed themselves as the Stanford men had
done. He also congratulated them
upon the standard of music they up
held and was enthusiastic over their
programs. The big railroad is anxi
ous to make the tour an annual affair.
Resides the two clubs, the Glee and
Mandolin, who shared equally in num
bers, several specialty acts were in
cluded in the program each night.
These were: a 'cello solo by G. O.
Wilson, '14; a chalk talk by E. M.
Albright, ex-'l2, and a four-man skit
by W. Wilson, '13, J. H. Forbes, *13,
V. W. McCourt, '14, and E. E. Chase,
ex-'ll. The skit was opened by Wil
son with one of his Yiddish mono
logues.
The combined Clubs met in Chicago
before disbanding for a business meet
ing. In order to manage the Clubs
at the beginning of this year a com
mittee was appointed. This is com
posed of A. J. Hall, '13, W. S. Wilson,
'13, and F. H. Forbes, '13. The Man
dolin Club at a similar meeting elect
ed A. J. Hall, '13, leader for the com

Stanford music and song were scat
tered over twenty-five hundred miles
of railway on the Santa Fe lines to
Chicago this summer by forty members
of the Stanford Glee and Mandolin
Clubs. The tour was one that had
been hanging in the air during three
years. Permission to take it had been
refused the Clubs each summer. He
cause of the conscientious work last
year and their evident desire to com
ply with the rules of the university
the two organizations were given the
necessary permit.
Thirteen concerts were given in less
than two weeks at the more impor
tant establishments of tl\e Harvey
Eating Houses and halls along the
lines of the Santa Fe. These were
attended by largs audiences of em
ployees of the transcontinental line
and friends of the clubs, as well as
alumni. In all their entertainments
the musicians created much friendly
feeling for Stanford and themselves
as representatives of the university.
They were given hearty welcomes
/wherever they stopped. Besides a
high grade of music the clubs left a
good, healty impression of Stanford
spirit of gentlemanly conduct all along
the road.
At one place, Clovis, New Mexico,
they were given a royal welcome. The
mayor of the town had prepared a
huge banner, bearing the words,
"Welcome, Stanford." This was the
first, thing that greeted the eyes of the
Stanford travelers as they left their
private car at the station. A dozen
or so automobiles then gave them a
good idea of what a live town Clovis
was, and they enjoyed it.
Another enjoyable side trip was
made to the Grand Canyon on the
second day from San Francisco. Here
they viewed the great chasm a,nd
woke up the echoes with Stanford
songs, and music.
At Canadian, Texas, a baseball nine
was made up from the forty men avail
able and the railroad employees were
met in a contest, that furthered the
good will of the journey.
The members of the two clubs
assembled at Point Richmond across
the Bay from San Francisco on the
night of May 22. A special Pullman
car had been given by the Santa Fe,
and in that they were to make their
home for two weeks. They were to
have meals served in dining cars and
the famous Harvey Eating Houses.
All speak with special enthusiasm ot
this part of the trip.
