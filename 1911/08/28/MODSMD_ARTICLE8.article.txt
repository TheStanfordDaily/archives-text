# The

It has been said by a university
president that if the college daily
newspaper is a "gentleman" that it

has more influence for
good and the right than
any other force among
the undergraduates.

Give us then to be a gentleman in all
our connections with this paper.
But even a gentleman has to do
unpleasant things sometimes. In any
difficulties that may arise we are going
to tell the students they are wrong
just as fearlessly and sincerely as we
shall tell the faculty or anyone else
in our community. We believe that with
care and a thorough sifting of facts
that the college paper can become no
mean agent for harmony and a more
friendly spirit between all parts of
the university.
With this word of preparation, or
warning, as you please, the editor
begins his long and perilous journey
through the months of this semester.
