# Where Angels Fear to Tread
## 
### 
The Daily Palo Alto is glad to note
that a dozen or more saloons were
closed at Menlo last July by order of
the State Supreme Court. Drinking

among college men
may be inevitable and
a good outlet for
"surplus steam," but

it is certainly not a good thing to
have the wherewithal at your back
door, within reach of five cents by
railroad or an average pair of legs.
In writing the above sentment we
fully realize that we may be walking
"where angels fear to tread," an'
that such opinions in a college paper
are few and far between. We know
that we will be regarded with amaze
ment by many .called a mollycoddle
by some, and "faculty pet" by others.
But to the broad-mindness and com
mon sense of all we appeal.
The editorial column of the paper
belongs to the editor; the news col
umns to the student body, and the
column next to this one on the right
is reserved for communications from
anyone who wants to "come back.''
While we're here we intend to ex
press our honest and sincere beliefs,
not held back by fear of suspension
from college or loss of "popularity."
