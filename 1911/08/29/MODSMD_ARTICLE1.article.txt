# ATHLETIC IMPROVEMENTS FAR EXCEED FORMER YEARS
## New Baseball Diamond Is Nearly Complete.—Many Betterments in Football, Track, Tennis and Soccer Fields. 
### 
Improvements on the athletic fields
of the University have been made*
during the summer at a total cost of
over $5000. Never in the history of
the institution with the single ex
ception of the year in which the
present football field was built has
so much work been done in increasing
the efficiency of the grounds. Work
has been done in practically every line
of athletic activity. The new base
ball diamond has been nearly finished;
the track has been totally reconstruct
ed; the tennis courts, which will be as
fine as the best in the country have
only been delayed in their completion
owing to trouble with the contractor
who had the work in charge; numer
ous improvements have been made
in the football field and bleachers; and
the rowing facilities of the University
have been materially increased by the
ordering of a new shell.
According to Graduate Manager Bur
bank the University is better prepared
at the beginning of this year's work
for the carrying on of all lines of ath
letic activities than it has ever been
in the past.
-New Diamond Soon Heady.
The most important step which was
taken was the commencing of work on
the new baseball diamond on the far
side of the football bleachers. Work
on this field began about the middle of
•Tuly. A large force of men were
employed to rush the excavations and
heavier parts of the construction
through as rapidly as possible. The
plans for the construction of the dia
mond were taken from the plans used
in the construction of the baseball field
at the University of Illinios. Some few
modifications were made. These were
decided upon on account of the differ
ent nature of the soil in the two places.
When completed the diamond will
be a turfed and "skinned" field sim
ilar to those upon which the big
leagues play in the east. After the
diamond bad been laid out excava
tions were made along the base line
around 'the entire diamond. Into
these excavations crumbled rock was
dumped as a foundation and on top
of this the finest quality of loam was
placed. This was rolled down until
it was of the proper hardness.
In order, however, that the baselines
should always be comparatively dry
a drainage system was installed along
all four of them. It is similar to the
drainage system employed on the foot
ball field. Tiled ditches were run
under the baselines and over these
the crushed rock was dumped.
According to experts this system in
sures perfect drainage for the infield.
Infield Turf Growing.
The turf was planted as early as
possible and is already well grown.
My forced irrigation for the entire
field the grass will be in perfect play
ing shape by the opening of the base
ball season.
Early this fall the work on the con
struction of the bleachers will begin.
They are to be built in the form of a
semi-circle extending around the dia
mond from behind first base to be
hind third. The two ends of these
bleachers will be connected to the
fence of the football bleachers by
long fences on either side. The whole
field is to be effectually enclosed.
The total cost including the blea
chers is estimated to be a little over
' Mr.*
Track Is He-Cindered.
The track was completely recon
structed during the summer. Owing
to the original wrong construction it
had packed down and hardened dur
ing the years of service until as a
result the University faced the dis
heartening series of breakdowns in
the track team of last semester. In
order that such a condition should
never occur again the track was com
pletely plowed up with big road gang
plows. The work of tearing up was
not confined to the track proper as

even the take-offs for the broad jump
high jump, and pole vault, were plow
ed up as well. Many wagon loads ot'
hard material similar to that taken
from long used roads were removed
from the field. When the track had
been lowered to the required level
the bottom was covered with crushed
lime and this in turn was covered with
a fine grade of loam. One hundred
and thirty tons of cinders purchased
in car load lots were then purchased
for the field and seventy tons of
these were dumped on the track and
rolled down. The other thirty tons
have been saved for future use on
the track. As a result of these im
provements the track is better
than at any time since its construc
tion. It. is springy and has just the
proper degree of hardness to insure
the greatest possible speed without
any mishaps resulting. The level of
the track in the center is about five
inches higher than the old level. The
drainage system was also improved.
The total cost of this work on the j
track amounts to about $1000. The
track bleachers were also partially
painted.
Splendid New Tennis Courts.
The foundation for the new tennis
courts have been ready for over two
months, but, owing to the slowness o*
the contractor in getting a steam
roller on the scene the work has been
delayed.
It is expected that the courts will
be ready for use within a short time.
A new material is being used in their
construction. It is a combination of
asphaltum and concrete and has neve'*
before had any particular trial on
good courts but has shown up remark
ably well in tests. It is expected thai
this combinntion will give all the
speed of the cement courts without
any of the disadvantages of their hard
ness, and without the poor wearing
qualities of the asphaltum style. The
surface which they will have is fully
as good as that obtained with the best
straight cement courts. The cost of
installation amounts to about $2000.
Many Football Changes.
The turf of the gridiron is in the
best condition that it has ever been in.
During the summer it was allowed to
go to seed and the new grass has filled
in many of the bare spots. As usual,
the rush between the underclassmen
will be held in one corner in order
to cut up the grass as little as pos
sible.
In the football training house sixty
new steel lockers have been installed
for the use of the men. In past years
the locker problem has been a very
decided one in the training house.
New benches for the use of the men
have also been placed in the quarters
and the entire interior has been re
painted.
Two men were employed for three
weeks during the summer making
necessary repairs on the football
bleachers. They were strengthened in
places where the timbers had weaken
ed and at present they are in practi
cally as good condition as the day they
were built.
Drinking water for the use of spec
tators at the games has also been piped
to a convenient place near the west
corner of the bleachers on the outside.
Five sanitary drinking faucets will be
installed here. Sam, the caretaker,
has also been building a brick foun
! tain near the field during the summer.
! it will be completed in the near future.
The auxiliary football field has been
turfed and is now ready for use.
Crew to Have Special Shell.
Rowing interests were taken care of
during the summer. A new eignt wa?
ordered from Sims, the English boat
builder. It is being made especially
for the Stanford crew. With a Sims
boat it is expected that the crews will
row faster time than ever before as
this firm is the best known in this lin* 1
in the world. It will be shipped from
England around the Horn and will
arrive early in the spring.
When seen this afternoon Manager
Burbank said: "The various fields
and courts of the University are in
far better shape than they ever were
before. Everything is in the very
best of condition. There is one thing,
however, that I want to say in regard
to the work that has been done this
summer around the University. All
credit for the excellent condition of
the various fields should go to Sam
Mac Donald. He supervised the recon
struction of the track, and the work
on the baseball field. Many of his own
ideas were employed in this work and
aided materially in bringing every
thing into as fine shape as it now is.
He had his own ideas and his own sys
tem for everything and the work abso
lutely could not have been done with
out him. He carried all the details
through in an able and capable man
ner. Credit for the fine work of the
summer should go to him."

When seen this afternoon Manager
Burbank said: "The various fields
and courts of the University are in
far better shape than they ever were

best of condition. There is one thing,
however, that I want to say in regard

credit for the excellent condition of
the various fields should go to Sam

Improvements on the athletic fields
of the University have been made*
during the summer at a total cost of
over $5000. Never in the history of
the institution with the single ex
ception of the year in which the
present football field was built has
so much work been done in increasing
the efficiency of the grounds. Work
has been done in practically every line
of athletic activity. The new base
ball diamond has been nearly finished;
the track has been totally reconstruct
ed; the tennis courts, which will be as
fine as the best in the country have
only been delayed in their completion
owing to trouble with the contractor
who had the work in charge; numer
ous improvements have been made
in the football field and bleachers; and
the rowing facilities of the University
have been materially increased by the
ordering of a new shell.
According to Graduate Manager Bur
bank the University is better prepared
at the beginning of this year's work
for the carrying on of all lines of ath
letic activities than it has ever been
in the past.
-New Diamond Soon Heady.
The most important step which was
taken was the commencing of work on
the new baseball diamond on the far
side of the football bleachers. Work
on this field began about the middle of
•Tuly. A large force of men were
employed to rush the excavations and
heavier parts of the construction
through as rapidly as possible. The
plans for the construction of the dia
mond were taken from the plans used
in the construction of the baseball field
at the University of Illinios. Some few
modifications were made. These were
decided upon on account of the differ
ent nature of the soil in the two places.
When completed the diamond will
be a turfed and "skinned" field sim
ilar to those upon which the big
leagues play in the east. After the
diamond bad been laid out excava
tions were made along the base line
around 'the entire diamond. Into
these excavations crumbled rock was
dumped as a foundation and on top
of this the finest quality of loam was
placed. This was rolled down until
it was of the proper hardness.
In order, however, that the baselines
should always be comparatively dry
a drainage system was installed along
all four of them. It is similar to the
drainage system employed on the foot
ball field. Tiled ditches were run
under the baselines and over these
the crushed rock was dumped.
According to experts this system in
sures perfect drainage for the infield.
Infield Turf Growing.
The turf was planted as early as
possible and is already well grown.
My forced irrigation for the entire
field the grass will be in perfect play
ing shape by the opening of the base
ball season.
Early this fall the work on the con
struction of the bleachers will begin.
They are to be built in the form of a
semi-circle extending around the dia
mond from behind first base to be
hind third. The two ends of these
bleachers will be connected to the
fence of the football bleachers by
long fences on either side. The whole
field is to be effectually enclosed.
The total cost including the blea
chers is estimated to be a little over
' Mr.*
Track Is He-Cindered.
The track was completely recon
structed during the summer. Owing
to the original wrong construction it
had packed down and hardened dur
ing the years of service until as a
result the University faced the dis
heartening series of breakdowns in
the track team of last semester. In
order that such a condition should
never occur again the track was com
pletely plowed up with big road gang
plows. The work of tearing up was
not confined to the track proper as

even the take-offs for the broad jump
high jump, and pole vault, were plow
ed up as well. Many wagon loads ot'
hard material similar to that taken
from long used roads were removed
from the field. When the track had
been lowered to the required level
the bottom was covered with crushed
lime and this in turn was covered with
a fine grade of loam. One hundred
and thirty tons of cinders purchased
in car load lots were then purchased
for the field and seventy tons of
these were dumped on the track and
rolled down. The other thirty tons
have been saved for future use on
the track. As a result of these im
provements the track is better
than at any time since its construc
tion. It. is springy and has just the
proper degree of hardness to insure
the greatest possible speed without
any mishaps resulting. The level of
the track in the center is about five
inches higher than the old level. The
drainage system was also improved.
The total cost of this work on the j
track amounts to about $1000. The
track bleachers were also partially
painted.
Splendid New Tennis Courts.
The foundation for the new tennis
courts have been ready for over two
months, but, owing to the slowness o*
the contractor in getting a steam
roller on the scene the work has been
delayed.
It is expected that the courts will
be ready for use within a short time.
A new material is being used in their
construction. It is a combination of
asphaltum and concrete and has neve'*
before had any particular trial on
good courts but has shown up remark
ably well in tests. It is expected thai
this combinntion will give all the
speed of the cement courts without
any of the disadvantages of their hard
ness, and without the poor wearing
qualities of the asphaltum style. The
surface which they will have is fully
as good as that obtained with the best
straight cement courts. The cost of
installation amounts to about $2000.
Many Football Changes.
The turf of the gridiron is in the
best condition that it has ever been in.
During the summer it was allowed to
go to seed and the new grass has filled
in many of the bare spots. As usual,
the rush between the underclassmen
will be held in one corner in order
to cut up the grass as little as pos
sible.
In the football training house sixty
new steel lockers have been installed
for the use of the men. In past years
the locker problem has been a very
decided one in the training house.
New benches for the use of the men
have also been placed in the quarters
and the entire interior has been re
painted.
Two men were employed for three
weeks during the summer making
necessary repairs on the football
bleachers. They were strengthened in
places where the timbers had weaken
ed and at present they are in practi
cally as good condition as the day they
were built.
Drinking water for the use of spec
tators at the games has also been piped
to a convenient place near the west
corner of the bleachers on the outside.
Five sanitary drinking faucets will be
installed here. Sam, the caretaker,
has also been building a brick foun
! tain near the field during the summer.
! it will be completed in the near future.
The auxiliary football field has been
turfed and is now ready for use.

Many Football Changes.
The turf of the gridiron is in the
best condition that it has ever been in.
During the summer it was allowed to
go to seed and the new grass has filled
in many of the bare spots. As usual,
the rush between the underclassmen
will be held in one corner in order
to cut up the grass as little as pos
sible.
In the football training house sixty
new steel lockers have been installed
for the use of the men. In past years
the locker problem has been a very
decided one in the training house.
New benches for the use of the men
have also been placed in the quarters
and the entire interior has been re
painted.
Two men were employed for three
weeks during the summer making
necessary repairs on the football
bleachers. They were strengthened in
places where the timbers had weaken
ed and at present they are in practi
cally as good condition as the day they
were built.
Drinking water for the use of spec
tators at the games has also been piped
to a convenient place near the west
corner of the bleachers on the outside.
Five sanitary drinking faucets will be
installed here. Sam, the caretaker,
has also been building a brick foun
! tain near the field during the summer.
! it will be completed in the near future.
The auxiliary football field has been
turfed and is now ready for use.
Crew to Have Special Shell.
Rowing interests were taken care of
during the summer. A new eignt wa?
ordered from Sims, the English boat
builder. It is being made especially
for the Stanford crew. With a Sims
boat it is expected that the crews will
row faster time than ever before as
this firm is the best known in this lin* 1
in the world. It will be shipped from
England around the Horn and will
arrive early in the spring.
When seen this afternoon Manager
Burbank said: "The various fields
and courts of the University are in
far better shape than they ever were
before. Everything is in the very
best of condition. There is one thing,
however, that I want to say in regard
to the work that has been done this
summer around the University. All
credit for the excellent condition of
the various fields should go to Sam
Mac Donald. He supervised the recon
struction of the track, and the work
on the baseball field. Many of his own
ideas were employed in this work and
aided materially in bringing every
thing into as fine shape as it now is.
He had his own ideas and his own sys
tem for everything and the work abso
lutely could not have been done with
out him. He carried all the details
through in an able and capable man
ner. Credit for the fine work of the
summer should go to him."
Improvements on the athletic fields
of the University have been made*
during the summer at a total cost of
over $5000. Never in the history of
the institution with the single ex
ception of the year in which the
present football field was built has
so much work been done in increasing
the efficiency of the grounds. Work
has been done in practically every line
of athletic activity. The new base
ball diamond has been nearly finished;
the track has been totally reconstruct
ed; the tennis courts, which will be as
fine as the best in the country have
only been delayed in their completion
owing to trouble with the contractor
who had the work in charge; numer
ous improvements have been made
in the football field and bleachers; and
the rowing facilities of the University
have been materially increased by the
ordering of a new shell.
According to Graduate Manager Bur
bank the University is better prepared
at the beginning of this year's work
for the carrying on of all lines of ath
letic activities than it has ever been
in the past.
-New Diamond Soon Heady.
The most important step which was
taken was the commencing of work on
the new baseball diamond on the far
side of the football bleachers. Work
on this field began about the middle of
•Tuly. A large force of men were
employed to rush the excavations and
heavier parts of the construction
through as rapidly as possible. The
plans for the construction of the dia
mond were taken from the plans used
in the construction of the baseball field
at the University of Illinios. Some few
modifications were made. These were
decided upon on account of the differ
ent nature of the soil in the two places.
When completed the diamond will
be a turfed and "skinned" field sim
ilar to those upon which the big
leagues play in the east. After the
diamond bad been laid out excava
tions were made along the base line
around 'the entire diamond. Into
these excavations crumbled rock was
dumped as a foundation and on top
of this the finest quality of loam was
placed. This was rolled down until
it was of the proper hardness.
In order, however, that the baselines
should always be comparatively dry
a drainage system was installed along
all four of them. It is similar to the
drainage system employed on the foot
ball field. Tiled ditches were run
under the baselines and over these
the crushed rock was dumped.
According to experts this system in
sures perfect drainage for the infield.
Infield Turf Growing.
The turf was planted as early as
possible and is already well grown.
My forced irrigation for the entire
field the grass will be in perfect play
ing shape by the opening of the base
ball season.
Early this fall the work on the con
struction of the bleachers will begin.
They are to be built in the form of a
semi-circle extending around the dia
mond from behind first base to be
hind third. The two ends of these
bleachers will be connected to the
fence of the football bleachers by
long fences on either side. The whole
field is to be effectually enclosed.
The total cost including the blea
chers is estimated to be a little over
' Mr.*
Track Is He-Cindered.
The track was completely recon
structed during the summer. Owing
to the original wrong construction it
had packed down and hardened dur
ing the years of service until as a
result the University faced the dis
heartening series of breakdowns in
the track team of last semester. In
order that such a condition should
never occur again the track was com
pletely plowed up with big road gang
plows. The work of tearing up was
not confined to the track proper as

even the take-offs for the broad jump
high jump, and pole vault, were plow
ed up as well. Many wagon loads ot'
hard material similar to that taken
from long used roads were removed
from the field. When the track had
been lowered to the required level
the bottom was covered with crushed
lime and this in turn was covered with
a fine grade of loam. One hundred
and thirty tons of cinders purchased
in car load lots were then purchased
for the field and seventy tons of
these were dumped on the track and
rolled down. The other thirty tons
have been saved for future use on
the track. As a result of these im
provements the track is better
than at any time since its construc
tion. It. is springy and has just the
proper degree of hardness to insure
the greatest possible speed without
any mishaps resulting. The level of
the track in the center is about five
inches higher than the old level. The
drainage system was also improved.
The total cost of this work on the j
track amounts to about $1000. The
track bleachers were also partially
painted.
Splendid New Tennis Courts.
The foundation for the new tennis
courts have been ready for over two
months, but, owing to the slowness o*
the contractor in getting a steam
roller on the scene the work has been
delayed.
It is expected that the courts will
be ready for use within a short time.
A new material is being used in their
construction. It is a combination of
asphaltum and concrete and has neve'*
before had any particular trial on
good courts but has shown up remark
ably well in tests. It is expected thai
this combinntion will give all the
speed of the cement courts without
any of the disadvantages of their hard
ness, and without the poor wearing
qualities of the asphaltum style. The
surface which they will have is fully
as good as that obtained with the best
straight cement courts. The cost of
installation amounts to about $2000.

provements the track is better
than at any time since its construc
tion. It. is springy and has just the
proper degree of hardness to insure
the greatest possible speed without
any mishaps resulting. The level of
the track in the center is about five
inches higher than the old level. The
drainage system was also improved.
The total cost of this work on the j
track amounts to about $1000. The
track bleachers were also partially
painted.
Splendid New Tennis Courts.
The foundation for the new tennis
courts have been ready for over two
months, but, owing to the slowness o*
the contractor in getting a steam
roller on the scene the work has been
delayed.
It is expected that the courts will
be ready for use within a short time.
A new material is being used in their
construction. It is a combination of
asphaltum and concrete and has neve'*
before had any particular trial on
good courts but has shown up remark
ably well in tests. It is expected thai
this combinntion will give all the
speed of the cement courts without
any of the disadvantages of their hard
ness, and without the poor wearing
qualities of the asphaltum style. The
surface which they will have is fully
as good as that obtained with the best
straight cement courts. The cost of
installation amounts to about $2000.
Many Football Changes.
The turf of the gridiron is in the
best condition that it has ever been in.
During the summer it was allowed to
go to seed and the new grass has filled
in many of the bare spots. As usual,
the rush between the underclassmen
will be held in one corner in order
to cut up the grass as little as pos
sible.
In the football training house sixty
new steel lockers have been installed
for the use of the men. In past years
the locker problem has been a very
decided one in the training house.
New benches for the use of the men
have also been placed in the quarters
and the entire interior has been re
painted.
Two men were employed for three
weeks during the summer making
necessary repairs on the football
bleachers. They were strengthened in
places where the timbers had weaken
ed and at present they are in practi
cally as good condition as the day they
were built.
Drinking water for the use of spec
tators at the games has also been piped
to a convenient place near the west
corner of the bleachers on the outside.
Five sanitary drinking faucets will be
installed here. Sam, the caretaker,
has also been building a brick foun
! tain near the field during the summer.
! it will be completed in the near future.
The auxiliary football field has been
turfed and is now ready for use.
Crew to Have Special Shell.
Rowing interests were taken care of
during the summer. A new eignt wa?
ordered from Sims, the English boat
builder. It is being made especially
for the Stanford crew. With a Sims
boat it is expected that the crews will
row faster time than ever before as
this firm is the best known in this lin* 1
in the world. It will be shipped from
England around the Horn and will
arrive early in the spring.
When seen this afternoon Manager
Burbank said: "The various fields
and courts of the University are in
far better shape than they ever were
before. Everything is in the very
best of condition. There is one thing,
however, that I want to say in regard
to the work that has been done this
summer around the University. All
credit for the excellent condition of
the various fields should go to Sam
Mac Donald. He supervised the recon
struction of the track, and the work
on the baseball field. Many of his own
ideas were employed in this work and
aided materially in bringing every
thing into as fine shape as it now is.
He had his own ideas and his own sys
tem for everything and the work abso
lutely could not have been done with
out him. He carried all the details
through in an able and capable man
ner. Credit for the fine work of the
summer should go to him."
