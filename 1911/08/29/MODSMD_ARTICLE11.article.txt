# A 						Means to an End
## 
### 
There is no encouragement for an
athletic team like that of seeing a
thousand men or so on the bleachers

during games. And there is
a vast amount of relaxation
from the week's classroom
work for that same thous

and to watch contests from a bleacher
seat in the cool of the afternoon twice
a week. And when the price of ad
mission has been reduced to an almost
nominal rate, attendance at Stanford
Field seems an easy thing to accom
plish for the individual student.
Gradutae Manager Burbank has gone
a long way to put a spectator seat at
every game within reach of the pocket
of the average student and has gone
earnestly about the problem of getting
larger crowds out for the practice con
tests. For one dollar a semester ticket
to over a dozen matches can be bought
providing two dollars is added for the
regular student body assessment made
every year.
Let all help together and understand
what is being attempted. The new
plan is simply another means to the
single end—a victory from California
next November. To accomplish that
end we must work together; there
must lie a large attendance at the
rugby field; the team must know
without a shadow of a doubt that the
students are behind them.
Let the Freshmen buy the tickets,
and let the other three classes fall
in after them until the thing thei
football men are attempting is at
tained.
