President of the Student Body
Schaupp has combined an unusual
amount of common sense and sound
advice in his article addressed to the
Freshmen in the current Sequoia.
Plain talking is a thing rarely found
in a student community, and the more
we have of it the better. The quicker
the Freshmen understand what is ex
pected of them ihe easier it will be
for everyone. In many cases they are
not given enough instruction in the
rules and traditions of the campus,
and cannot be blamed too much for
mistakes. With Schaupp's article be
fore them they should at least be set
to thinking.
We heartily concur in the following
sentiment upon the subject of hazing.
It hits the nail on the head:
"The committee has done what it
considers to be best for the student
and the university. When those in
authority, however, say that a Fresh
man is not to be tubbed, they do not
say that he is to lie spoiled. His place
will be, as it has always been, that of
the youngest brother. If any Fresh
man should feel that he deserves a
slightly higher position, he will find
that there are other vehicles beside the
tub by which he can be brought again
to earth."
