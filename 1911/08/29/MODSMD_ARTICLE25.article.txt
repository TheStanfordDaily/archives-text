## OUR FRIEND THE ENEMY Points of Interest at the University of California.

M. Morris, Varsity scrum half, has
not registered yet and there is some
doubt as to whether he will be in a
suit this year.
A reception was tendered to the
incoming University of California
freshmen by President and Mrs. Ben
jamin Ide Wheeler, last Tuesday even
ing.
Ray Maynard, '12, who rowed in the
"five" seat in last year's shell was
elected to the crew captaincy, when
it was definitely announced that
"Hunk" Beall, captain-elect, would not
return to college.
The University of California sum
mer session enrolled an eighty year
old student in the person of Mrs. A. W.
Truesdell. English, with emphasis on
poetry, was the subject which attracted
her.
F. H. Allen, '13, holder of the Inter
collegiate and Pacific Coast records
in the running broad jump, will be
kept from track training this semes
ter, because of a recent operation.
Graduate Manager Farmer recently
recommended to the Executive Com
mute that Walter Christie, veteran
track coach and trainer, be appointed
assistant footbal coach for the cur
rent year. Since the inception of the
game at California Christie has been
an ardent student of the sport and has
an excellent working knowledge of
the game. His experience as a track
coach is expected to materially assist
the speedy backfield men.
The Rugby ball made its first
appearance of the season at Califor
nia Field yesterday, when over a hun
dred husky athletes began work under
Coach Schaeffer's eagle eye. Most of
the aspirants for freshman honors
showed a surprising knowledge of
the game. Their experience came
from preparatory school coaching.
Several familiar faces were seen
among the players.
During the last few years the wear
ing of Junior Plugs has become more
and more unusual. Jt is now only the
most courageous enthusiast who ven
tures out with such a scenic piece of
head gear. Each succeeding Junior
class had long discussions as to
whether the traditions were of suffi
cient moment to be worthy of con
tinuance. All classes decided it was
and passed resolutions urging the
members to keep up the custom. The
efforts did not succeed, however, and
the painted hats became fewer each
term.
Regents of the university have
offered a prize of $250 for a design
for a medal to be presented annually
to the best student from each grad
uating class. A second prize of $r>o
is also offered.
The sum of two thousand dollars
was expended during the summer by
the Associated Students to install an
elaborate tiling drainage system on
California Field. It is similar to the
system used to drain the Stanford
track. The total length of piping is
approximately 12,000 feet.
Twenty-five women, and but twenty
men have registered in the new Scout
craft course offered by the university.
This course is simiar in its scope to
the Roy Scouts movement.
Registration at the university this
year has surpassed all previous marks
with a total of 3500 students. Of this
number about. 1000 are new under
graduates.
The musical score of the 1911 Ex
travangaza, "The Hop King," is being
published at the request of last year's
Seniors. The book, which will appear
soon will contain nearly sixty pages
of matter.
So great lias been the demand for
junior plugs and sophomore caps at
the official hatters, that the supply
has been completely exhausted. it
was necessary to order a new con
signment.
Several members of the faculty
abroad are representing the Univer
sity in ceremonies at foreign univer
sities. Dr. R. T. Crawford is the
official delegate at the exercises com
memorating the one hundreth anni
versary of the foundation of the Uni
versity of Breslau. Prof. R. O. Moody
has been appointed delegate to the
exercises celebrating the reunion of
Brittany and France. Prof. Moser
will attend exercises commemorating
the hundreth anniversary of the found
ing of the Royal University at Chris
tiana.
