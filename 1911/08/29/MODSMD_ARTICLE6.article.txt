# BOTH VARSITY AND FRESHMAN FIFTEENS TO HAVE NINE GAMES
## Varsity Journeys to Los Angeles as the Only Off-Campus Trip; All Other Games Here. 
### 
Los Angeles will be the niecca for
the only off-campus pilgrimage of the
Stanford Varsity, according to the
schedule announced today by Grad
uate Manager D. W. Burbank, '09.
For the past two years the journey
lias been made to Reno but the com
bining of the Law and Classical
departments at the University of
Southern California to form a rugby
unit made it possible to secure a
game in the Southland with a team
that could make a showing against
the Cardinal Varsity. The trip to the
south of the Tehachapi is set for the
week-end of October 21.
The rugby fifteen from the Sage
brush is slated for a campus appear
ance on October 14. A fairly hard
proposition is promised here by the
rumors from across the desert. Last
year's Nevada line-up will remain
almost intact and several promising
beginners are said to be on hand.
Frank Meyers, a wing forward on
Stanford's '07 Varsity, and Nevada
coach for three years past, has re
signed to take up the practice of
law. Meyers' place in the coaching
position will be filled by E. Bennett.
Bennett was undoubtedly the best
rugby player that ever entered the
"Alkali" College and was one of the
travelers with the All-American team
in the invasion of the Antipodes in
the summer of 1910.
The first two November dates will
be held for the Vancouver aggrega
tion. These should be the most pop
ular and most hotly contested of the
preliminary games, The last time
that this combination met the Car
dinal. during the Christmas holidays
of a year ago, saw the Stanford inva
ders take two of the series, one in
a snowstorm and the other on a fro
zen field. This year the champion
ship test will be beneath the sunny
skies of the more southern Pacific
slope, and promises to be a struggle
worthy of the Cardinal. It will be
worth going many miles to sit in the
bleachers and be a spectator of the
contest.
The remaining dates are divided
between the Olympics and the Bar
barians of San Francisco. These clubs
are working to put the strongest rug
by teams into the field that have worn
their insignia, and worthy opponents
may be looked for in one or both of
these groups. All thb games we
scheduled for the home sod with the
exception of the Los Angeles game.

Nine games have been secured by
Manager Burbank for the baby team
which Coach Presley will pick from
the incoming class and send into the
Held. A game with Santa Clara on
the 14th of October will replace the
Freshman Intercollegiate with the
California first-year men. Excepting
this, the schedule reads the same as
last year's.
The newcomers will be given two
weeks on the turf before being called
on to defend the Cardinal against an
opponent. This will give the rooters
ample chance to size up the new as
pirants to rugby honors before they
are first called to account.
No matter how many Freshmen
sign up to wear togs, they will be
given ample opportunities to trod the
grass in the Wednesday and Saturday
set-to's. This year's policy will be
to get all of the new men into the
game, and as often as possible. With
this plan operating it will serve to
speed the finding of new stellar mater
ial and send them quicker into the
first team.
The usual snappy season is called
for by the schedule and the best teams
that were available have been secured
to meet the Cardinal Freshman. All
of the games are to be played on the
local turf gridiron.

Los Angeles will be the niecca for
the only off-campus pilgrimage of the
Stanford Varsity, according to the
schedule announced today by Grad
uate Manager D. W. Burbank, '09.
For the past two years the journey
lias been made to Reno but the com
bining of the Law and Classical
departments at the University of
Southern California to form a rugby
unit made it possible to secure a
game in the Southland with a team
that could make a showing against
the Cardinal Varsity. The trip to the
south of the Tehachapi is set for the
week-end of October 21.
The rugby fifteen from the Sage
brush is slated for a campus appear
ance on October 14. A fairly hard
proposition is promised here by the
rumors from across the desert. Last
year's Nevada line-up will remain
almost intact and several promising
beginners are said to be on hand.
Frank Meyers, a wing forward on
Stanford's '07 Varsity, and Nevada
coach for three years past, has re
signed to take up the practice of
law. Meyers' place in the coaching
position will be filled by E. Bennett.
Bennett was undoubtedly the best
rugby player that ever entered the
"Alkali" College and was one of the
travelers with the All-American team
in the invasion of the Antipodes in
the summer of 1910.
The first two November dates will
be held for the Vancouver aggrega
tion. These should be the most pop
ular and most hotly contested of the
preliminary games, The last time
that this combination met the Car
dinal. during the Christmas holidays
of a year ago, saw the Stanford inva
ders take two of the series, one in
a snowstorm and the other on a fro
zen field. This year the champion
ship test will be beneath the sunny
skies of the more southern Pacific
slope, and promises to be a struggle
worthy of the Cardinal. It will be
worth going many miles to sit in the
bleachers and be a spectator of the
contest.
The remaining dates are divided
between the Olympics and the Bar
barians of San Francisco. These clubs
are working to put the strongest rug
by teams into the field that have worn
their insignia, and worthy opponents
may be looked for in one or both of
these groups. All thb games we
scheduled for the home sod with the
exception of the Los Angeles game.

Nine games have been secured by
Manager Burbank for the baby team
which Coach Presley will pick from
the incoming class and send into the
Held. A game with Santa Clara on
the 14th of October will replace the
Freshman Intercollegiate with the
California first-year men. Excepting
this, the schedule reads the same as
last year's.
The newcomers will be given two
weeks on the turf before being called
on to defend the Cardinal against an
opponent. This will give the rooters
ample chance to size up the new as
pirants to rugby honors before they
are first called to account.
No matter how many Freshmen
sign up to wear togs, they will be
given ample opportunities to trod the
grass in the Wednesday and Saturday
set-to's. This year's policy will be
to get all of the new men into the
game, and as often as possible. With
this plan operating it will serve to
speed the finding of new stellar mater
ial and send them quicker into the
first team.
