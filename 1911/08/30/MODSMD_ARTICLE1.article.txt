Misstatements.
That Stanford, "a small and select
University," regarded as the most im
portant educational experiment of
the century, is made up entirely of
studious studes who endeavor to make
the institution typical of western free
dom and independence, is the opinion
of William E. Curtis in a lengthy
article of the Chicago Record-Herald
of June 2. Curtis is a special writer
for the Windy City journal.
Mr. Curtis' writing on the Stanford
Student Body's appearances and ac
tions is just as educating to the Stu
dent Body itself as to the people of
far off Chicago. For he says,"The
Seniors wear the costume of the cow
boy, sombrero and corduroys, which
are very appropriate.. The Juniors
dress like tramps. They call them
selves 'plug-uglies' and wear stiff
white hats decorated with pictographs
showing the owner's fraternity, his
achievements in the classroom and
the athletic field, his adventures, his
ambitions, and the incidents of his
academic career, after the manner of
the Indian warriors."
The intercollegiate base-ball game,
witnessed by Mr. Curtis, must have
been played when the students were
not on hand, for he says, "until the
result was announced the student
body seemed to have lost their senses
as well as their self-respect, but when
the game was over, the team that had
been playing took their places in front
of the Stanford section of rooters
and joined reverently in the singing
of the college hymn. . . . Then bed
lam broke loose again."
Although many students admit liv
ing on the Stanford Farm, yet it will
be a surprise to know that they also
came from a farm. The article says
that because of the strict entrance
requirements "the student popula
tion has been reduced to earnest, hard
working, ambitious young people,
most of whom are from the farms and
small towns of California, and very
few from the cities. The women are
chiefly preparing themselves for teach
ing, the men for professional life."
"The women stand higher than the
men because they work harder" is a
most amazing and hitherto unthot of
reason for the somewhat higher
scholarship of the women advanced
by Mr. Curtis.
"It is a most striking tact that both
men and women who have the highest
standing live outside the campus."
"The freshman year at Stanford is
a terrible ordeal for a poorly prepared
young man or woman. Before he can
go up into the sophomore class a
freshman must demonstrate his wor
thiness. ... It is as severe and in
tolerant as West Point."
"Six sororities occupy comfortable
and picturesque villas, each in charge
of a chaperon who acts as house
keeper."
Strictly speaking the following is
incorrect, "Members of fraternities
room and take their meals in the chap
ter houses and sororities."
In describing the architecture and
appearances of Stanford the writer
says—
"The low red quadrangles, with their
Moorish arches and overhanging
eaves, look more like a hacienda in
Spain, or a Moslem monastery in the
deserts of North Africa. It is as
different from the orthodox order of
scholastic architecture as the campus
of nine thousand acres in the valley
and the foot hills differs from the
Elms of New Haven and the undulat
ing hills of Williamstown. The effect
could not be obtained anywhere else,
and in appearance as well as in char
acter. there is more individuality in
Stanford University perhaps than in
any other great educational institu
tion. The theories and methods of
education practiced by the faculty.
the rules and regulations that govern
the students, the habits and customs
of the undergraduates—and we must
Hot forget the forceful personality
of the president—are without prece
dent or imitation. But, taking every
thing into consideration, the public
can afford to overlook the eccentrici
ties, vanities and affectations that
accompany an endowment of $30,000,
000, for the manufacture of useful 1
citizens, and regard Stanford Uni
versity as the most important educa
tional experiment that has been
attempted for a century."
The article in question pays a high
tribute to Mrs. Stanford, Dr. Jordan,
and the whole University in general,
but is weakened by many erroneous
and misleading statements.
