# Dr. Blodgett to Give Recitals.
## 
### 
Many friends of Dr. B. C. Blodgett
and others unknown to him will be
pleased to hear that ho will continue
his usual organ recitals at the differ
ent churches in Palo Alto the coming
year. Dr. Blodgett's strength is still
sufficient to enable him to give the
short programs of five or six numbers
twice a week. He extends a special
invitation to students in the univer
sity to come and listen to the half
hour or so of music. Bach program,
with the church in which he will play,
will be printed a day in advance in
the Daily Palo Alto.
