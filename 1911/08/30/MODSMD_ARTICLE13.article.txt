# Life Blood of the Paper
## 
### 
Because of the increased size, and
the greater amount of news matter
needed and a larger staff to secure it,

there is a much better
opportunity for editor
ial candidates this year
than in any previous.

There are places for Juniors and
Sophomores as well as Freshmen.
Freshmen, of course, are the life blood
of the paper, and it needs them. They
will be guiding its destinies at the eml
of four years. They must be chosen
carefully, with the strict purpose of
getting the best men only. The Daily
will have places for many of the first
year class, and looks to them with
faith in their ability and willingness
to work.
For the Freshman there is no better
way of making friends and getting
acquainted with the men who are
doing things here on the campus, than
in gathering news for the college
paper. There is no better way to
learn the inner workings of the whole
vast machinery, the traditions and
facts of history that all loyal mem
bers of the university should know.

The Daily issues a call for report
ers from all classes, and particularly
Freshmen, for next Monday after
noon at two o'clock. Candidates will
report to the editor at the Daily Palo
Alto office. He especially requests
that all Freshmen come upon their
own merits, unattended by upperclass
men or others. In order to give an
absolutely fair and just try-out the
editor plans to know men by their
names only during the first two weeks
of work. Later on the personality of
the candidates will be taken into
account. It has been the custom in
former years for older men in the
university to bring their Freshmen
friends to the office on the opening
day. This has been a perfectly nat
ural thing to do, and the editors in
former have appreciated that it was
not so much for selfish reasons as for
the desire to start the men right and
to aid the editor in his task.
All men reporting will be given
assignments, which they will keep as
long as they show their ability to do
the work. The try-outs extend usu
ally over a period of from six weeks
to two months, when elections will
be announced.
