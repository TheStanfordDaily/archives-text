						Thoughtless Injustice.

Here is an injustice which might be
remedied to the mutual advantage of
the Daily Palo Alto and about four or

five hundred members
of the student body.
It has been the cus
tom for fraternities,

sororities and clubs on the campus to
order Dailies for each year depending
upon each successive club manager's
idea of economy and reducing the bud
get. Each year the number of papers
taken has dwindled, until now about
ninety copies must present the news
to five hundred readers, each one of
whom is vitally interested in the
day's happenings. This condition, we
believe, has been brought on thought
lessly by the thirty or so managers.
They look at their estimates for the
year, see the clubhouse slated for
four copies of the Daily, and decide
they can save three dollars very easily
by reducing the allowance to
The next year the same thing might
happen and the ratio will come down
to one paper for eight people, all of
whom wish to see the issue at the
same time.
This has been unfair to the Daily
and to the members of the organiza
tions as well. The Daily is supported
by five hundred people with only
ninety subscribers, while it must de
pend upon the remaining five or six
hundred students of those interested
in the paper for four or five hundred
subscriptions. This is manifestly un
fair. Further, underclassmen in the
various Greek letter houses have com
plained again and again that their
copies of the paper are snatched up
by the upperclassmen. They are taken
to the rooms and then wholly disap
pear The result is. that the Freshmen
and Sophomores, who most of all
should understand the changes in the
university as given day by day in the
Daily, and their significance, do not
have an opportunity to follow the

news, and are dependent upon chance
talk and gossip for vital topics.
Encina Hall has three hundred men.
One man in every two takes the Daily.
They are roommates, to be sure, but
also may the men in the clubs be
considered as voommaies.' In the
private rooming-houses, also, the aver
age is about one in three. It is readily
seen, therefore, that the fraternities,
societies and clubs are not giving the
Daily the support it deserves, whether
they do so intentionally or not. It is
our opinion that it is thoughtlessness.

Everyone knows the state of finan
ces of the paper. Each year accounts
barely balance. The editor has the
care and constant worry of a daily
paper on his hands for from six to
twelve hours a day, besides doing his
college work and sleeping. He is
probably the poorest paid college edi
tor in the country. The manager has
a problem of securing advertisements
for a paper thirty-three miles from a
city, and has his work also marked out
for him.
In subscribing for the coming year
we earnestly ask the chapters of the
various fraternities, sororities, and the
clubs, to talk this over and to increase
their number of papers for the House.
This will serve the double purpose
mentioned above.
