# Pride in Our Campus

### 
Years ago it may have been the
right and proper thing to decorate the
reservoir fence on the top of the hill

southwest of the uni
versity with class nu
merals. That was in
the days when brown

grass and a cow-path or two were the
only things to keep the big reservoir
company on the hill. Now, however,
there are dozens of beautiful houses
there, with the owners taking especial
pride in their appearance and in their
gardens, and macadamized streets
lead to them.
Members of a certain class have
neglected to remember the changed
conditions on the hill, and now a huge
numeral in the reddest of red paint
makes that formerly neat corner of
the campus an unsightly place. The
fence had but recently been painted
and creosoted and to destroy its clear
appearance seems unusual vandalism.
Would it not be the part of decency
and pride in our campus to paint a
nive cover of green over those red
letters? We watch with interest for
results.
