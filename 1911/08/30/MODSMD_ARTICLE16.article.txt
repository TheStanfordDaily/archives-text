# The 						First Assembly
## 
### 
Tomorrow an opportunity is offered
for all of us to get acquainted, to see
how large an audience we can make,
and what amount of spirit we have.

This opportunity is given in
the first assembly of the
year. As Mr. Treat of the
committee says, there was

a good quantity of spirit left when the
university closed last May; why not
join the end of last semester to the
beginning of this and have a continua
tion of the good will that was evident
last semester. The best way to do
this is for every student in the univer
sity to attend the gathering.
