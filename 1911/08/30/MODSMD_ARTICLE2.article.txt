# Changes in Courses Add Strength
## New Courses and Professors Noted in Many Departments, While Other Changes Come as Result of Experience. 
### 
Many new courses and the modifi
cation or enlargement of old ones this
year mark the continual broadening
and strengthening of the Stanford
curriculum. Some subjects have for
various reasons been dropped, others
have been placed in the hands of new
Professors, and to others an addition
al hour has been given.
Economics Department.
Changes are most numerous in the
Economics Department. Professor
A. A. Young, former acting head of
the department, goes to Washington
University of St. Louis, and Professor
Alvin Saunders Johnson becomes per
manent head. Professor Johnson is a
recognized authority in the political
and social sciences. He has been Pro
fessor of Economics in the State Uni
versities of Nebraska and Texas, and
Associate Professor of Economics in
the University of Chicago, from which
college he conies to Stanford. He will
take charge of most of the classes
formerly conducted by Professor
Young, as well as the popular course
in Economics I, thus giving Instruc
tor I. B. Cross more time to devote to
his particular fields of social problems
and economic history. The new
courses in this department include
number 7. "Tariffs and Commercial
Policy," 9, "Financial History of the
United State3," 12, "Charities and
Corrections," 14a, "Economic History
of the United States," and 8, "Public
Finance." Course 7 will be an inten
sive study of the tariff question, with
special reference to reciprocity, pref
erential tariffs, and subsidies. Pro
fessor Johnson will handle this sub
ject. Course 5, Railway Transporta
tion, will be given the second semester
by Professor A. S. Johnson, and course
schedule has been made by the depart
ment. Associate Professor A. H. Millis
is to give the course in "Financial
History of the United States," the
nature of which is fully described by
the title. Instructor 1. B. Cross, who
will give the new Economics 12, an
nounces that it will include a general
survey of the leading economic, so
cial, and individual causes of social
disorder and poverty, methods of relief
for these ills, social legislation and

other current movements for social
betterment. Professor Cross will also
teach the "Economic History of the
United States." "Public Finance,"
under Professor H. A. Millis, is a gen
eral course dealing with the principles
underlying public expenditures, debts,
and financial administration. It is
substituted for the course formerly
numbered 8, "Principles of Taxation,"
which has been dropped. Other sub
jects in this department no longer giv
en are those formerly numbered 18,
20, 21, and 23, which are seminary
courses, or courses of an intensive
nature.
German Department.
In the Department of Germanic Lan
guages, Boezinger is raised from the
rank of Instructor to that of Assistant
Professor. G. W. Hauschild is a new
Instructor and Anetta Haffner Hilnier
a new Assistant. Mrs. Hilmer and
Professor Hauschild will instruct
classes in German 1, "Elementary," 2,
"Reading, and 2b, "Reproduction and
Production." These are some of the
subjects taught last year by Assistant
Professor Macy Millmore Skinner, who
is absent in Europe on Sabbatical
leave. Professor Skinner's former
three-hour course on "Schiller'" will
be reduced to two hours and taught by
Professor Cooper.
History Department.
In the History Department the prin
cipal change to be noted is the fact
that courses 4a and b, "English His
tory." are not, as formerly, a prere
quisite to most other courses in the
department. In place of it History 3a
and b, becomes the general Freshman
course, though not a prerequisite to
many other historical studies. This
is a course by Professor A. B. Show,
and is a general study course of the
early and late Middle Ages. Course
17, "Periodical Literature," is new this
year. It is given by Professor H. L.
Cannon, for one hour both semesters,
Is open to a limited number of advan
ced students, and comprises a study
of current historical articles. Course
19. "History of the Southwest," for
merly given by Professor Bolton, is
omitted in 1910-11.

English Department.
i The journalistic work in connection
with the English Department, will be
materially strengthened by the addi
tion of English 27, "Current Newspa
pers" which will include a study and
comparison of the policies, methods
and ideals of current daily news
-1 papers. It is to be given by Instruc
; tor E. W. Smith. English 25, "Short
Story Writing," under Miss Mirrielees,
which supersedes course 23, "Narra
tion," will also be greeted with approv
al. It consists in a study of short
stories and practice in their com
position. Announcement is also made
by the English Department that the
statement in the Announcement of
Courses that English 22, "Oral Debate,"
is not to be given in 1911-12, is incor
rect. This course will be conducted
by Professor L. E. Bassett, assisted
by P. F. Batkin, '10, and is open to
twenty-four students, who must sign
for it at once in Professor Bassett's
office.
