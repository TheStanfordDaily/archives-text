# LETTER ON SCHOLARSHIP SENT TO FRATERNITIES
## PRESIDENT JORDAN WRITES ON CLASS WORK. Asks for Explanations and Opinions. No Immediate Action to be Taken in Matter. 
### 
Fraternities at Stanford have been
warned in a letter from President Da
vid Starr Jordan that the scholarship
of their members is lower than that'
of the non-fraternity men. He calls
attention to the fact that this condi
tion prevails all over the United
States, and he expresses himself as
certain that it will not be allowed to
continue.
Doctor Jordan is a firm believer
in the fraternity system, being a fra
ternity man himself, but he says he
thinks that in some cases the chap
ter houses are too much given over to
other issues besides studies result
ing in low averages and often failures
in the college work.
A part of his letter reads as fol
lows, "The authorities of the Univer
sity of Wisconsin have given these
matters an extended investigation,
and have resolved on the following
limitation of fraternity activities:
1. That the pledging of high school
students by the fraternities be dis
continued.
2. That no freshman be permitted to
lodge or board in a fraternity house.
3. That no student be initiated into
a fraternity until the beginning of the
sophomore year.
4. That no student be initiated into
a fraternity while on probation.
"With no purpose of drastic action
nor of any action at present, and
appreciating the efforts of all the fra
ternities at Stanford to improve the
scholarship of their members, I ask
you again to consider these problems,
and to give me your best judgment,
(1) as to the cause of the average
low scholarship of fraternity men,
(2) the undue number of failures, and
(3) as to remedies which may be ap
plied, (a) by the local fraternities
themselves, (b) by the national sec
retary of each fraternity or (c) by the
University faculty. I should also like
the views of your chapter as to wheth
er the main fault does not lie in se
lection, on the basis of surface qual
ities, of too many men who are in
capable of forming an interest in Uni
versity work, and who, lacking such
interest ought not to be in the Univer
sity at all. No man gets much good
from a university until he realizes that
his future success depends in large
degree on the way he uses his oppor
tunities. There is no culture worth
the name which does not involve hard
work."
