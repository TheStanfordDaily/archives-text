of the Department of Zoology, will
report to the United States Bureau of
Fisheries in a few weeks his findings
in investigating the Sockeye salmon
this summer in the Pacific Northwest.
Professor Gilbert passed four weeks

ham hatcheries in the State of Wash
ington. He has been employed by the
government for several seasons as an
expert in this kind of work.
His studies this summer were con
fined chiefly to a study of the age of
individual fish by their structures.
He examined a large number of speci
mens to determine the proportions
of indivduals and the percentage of
four-year fish in streams where Try
had been introduced.
On concluding his observations for
the Bureau of Fisheries, Professor Gil
bert made a three weeks' visit to Paci
