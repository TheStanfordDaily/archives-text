# MANAGES WILL NO LONGER BE OWNER OF CHAPARRAL.
## Hammer and Coffin Society Takes Over the Paper and Profits Go to Improvements. 
### 
Interesting news to the college
community is the announcement just
made by Hammer and Coffin, the so
ciety which publishes the "Chaparral,"
that in the future that paper will be
run on a new system. The society is
to take a more active interest in the
welfare of the paper than heretofore,
the ownership of the publication being
vested in the members of the society.
Heretofore the paper has been owned
by the manager.
As a result of the new arrangement
it is expected that a much larger per
centage of receipts from the pub
lication than has previously been
available will be put back into the
Chaparral, in the way of increased
number of pages, more illustrations,
and general improvement in the man
ner of publication. The Chaparral is
also making plans for the fitting up of
one room in the Stanford Union to be
known as Chappie's headquarters.
In it will be placed complete files of
the paper, the offices of editor and
manager, and various interesting rel
ics of Chappie's career.
