# CUP WILL GIVE IMPETUS TO WORK IN SOCCER
## INTERCOLLEGIATE GAME IS ARRANGED. All Old Players Except .Captain McCann Will Be Out For Practice Monday. 
### 
Soccer enthusiasts are unusually
cheerful this semester, the cause being
the unusually bright prospects for the
coming year in that sport. For the
second time in the history of the
rival universities, an intercollegiate
soccer game will be played between
Stanford and California. Manager
M. T. Farmer of California recently
applied for the admission of his team
to the California Soccer League, and
the application was granted. Upon
this being done, C. Y. Williamson, of
the Barbarian and Olympic Clubs, an
enthusiast in both soccer and rugby,
agreed to present a cup to be contested
for by the two colleges. This cup is
to become the permanent property of
the university winning it three times.
During the summer the Stanford
soccer field has been repaired and
placed in splendid condition, and all
is in readiness for the first practice.
This is scheduled for Monday. A short
meeting of those interested in soccer is
announced for Friday. At that time
the captain who is to guide the des
tinies of the team for the semester
will be elected.
All play in soccer is to be under the
supervision of H. W. Maloney, who
was in charge of the work last year.
He states that all of last year's team
will again be in the game with the
exception of former Captain R. J.
McCann, who is registered this sem
ester but will not be out for soccer.
Maloney considers the prospects for
success in the English game the bright
est he has ever known, and expects to
see soccer recognised as a minor inter
collegiate sport before the end of the
season.
