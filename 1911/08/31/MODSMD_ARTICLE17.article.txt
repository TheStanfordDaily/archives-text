ranker Olmstead would sign up for
college work, but the lists this morn
ing failed to record his signature.

away and the rest of the veterans
enrolled.

country and in the Antipodes a summer
ago, is ready to try for a wing position.
F. C. Brown, '11, the long distance
touch punter and last stonewall of
defense will again be eligible as full.
Partridge will sign up at the rally

eligible candidate yesterday, after a
visit to the Registrar's Office.
Woodcock is out for the wing for
ward position as an eligible.
Cass, T. Sanborn, Worswick, and
