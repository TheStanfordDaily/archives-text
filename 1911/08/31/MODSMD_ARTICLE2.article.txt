# COURSE IN ESPERANTO WILL BE GIVEN.
## Professor Guerard Has Charge of A New Course On the International Language. 
### 
Esperanto, the international tongue,
has been added to the list of modern
language courses offered at Stanford,
and Professor A. L. Guerard has
charge of a class which is scheduled
to meet regularly throughout the year.
This new language was constructed
several years ago in such a manner as
to make it easy for people from all
countries to learn it in a short time.
The purpose was to give to the world
a new and universal tongue which
would enable foreigners to under
stand each other, simplify commerce
and help representatives at internat
ional conventions to transact business.
Since its construction Esperanto has
gained popularity rapidly, and today
schools and clubs all over the world
are niakng a study of it.
Dr. Jordan is one of the advocates
of Esperanto, and it.was greatly
through bis efforts that the new course
was added here at Stanford. It was
printed on the schedules as a one hour
course to be given on Tuesday and
Thursday at 9:15, provided sufficient
number could be secured to register
for it. This morning there were a
number present who wished to take it.
The language will therefore be given
a thorough tryout.
Esperanto is comparatively simple
and can be mastered in a short time
by university students. There seems to
be little doubt but that in a short time
it will become universally used.
The list of summer weddings stilll
continues to grow, the latest being
that of Associate Professor W. A.
Hillebrand, formerly of the Stanford
faculty in the Department of Electrical
Engineering, to Miss Antoinette Berry
of Palo Alto. Mr. Hillebrand is now
