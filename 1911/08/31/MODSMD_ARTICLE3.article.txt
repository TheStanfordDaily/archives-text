# Semester is Formally Launched
## Opening Assembly of Welcome Brings Student Body Together.—Pointed Addresses Are Made by Several Members of Faculty. Enthusiasm Reigns. 
### 
In a splendid
assembly, vibrant
with the pent-up
Stanford Spirit
which had lain
dormant during
the summer the
semester was for
mally launched
this morning.
Long before the
hour set for the

opening of the exercises the hall had
begun to fill and by the time Yell
leader S. C. Kennedy, '12, started the
appropriate songs and yells the assem
bly contained but few empty seats.
As is invariably the case, the first
"Varsity," barked out by hundreds
of lusty throats, caused the new stu
dents to sit up. It was a rousing
cheer and boded well for the spirit
which is to be seen on the bleachers
and on the athletic field during the
semester. Kennedy called for the
best known of the yells and songs
and they were all given in a manner
that quite belied the opinion preva
lent among a minority of students
that Stanford has lost the old-time
spirit.
At the close of the last song the
speakers appeared on the platform.
They were J. C. Tlranner, Vice-presi
dent of the University; Professor
.1. M. Stillman, of the Chemistry De
partment; Professor E. P. Cubberlev
of the Department of Education and
Dr. D. Charles Gardner, the Univer
sity Chaplain.
Dr. Brainier (Jives Welcome.
Dr. Branner opened the exercises.
After welcoming the new and old
members of the Faculty and the new
and old students in the name of the
Faculty and the Board of Trustees,
he extended a special welcome to sev
eral members of the Faculty coming
to Stanford for the first time. Dr. Wil
bur, the new head of the Department ot
Medicine, Dr. A. S. Johnston, the new
head of the Economics department,
and Dr. N. F. Drake, who takes his
place as an associate professor of eco
nomic geology, were among those
formally welcomed by the Vice-presi
dent. Dr. Wilbur, the new head of
the Department of Medicine, was given
an especial word of appreciation.
Continuing, Dr. Branner said: "New
students, I congratulation you on
your presence here, and I extend to
every one of you our heartiest wel
come. I dare say you have not found
your bearings, and you are probably
to busy looking about you to pay much
attention to our well meant sugges
tions, so I shall make but few.
"Beginning with this very day be
careful not to miss the first lectures
in any of your studies. Whether you
are going to get through your univer
sity work satisfactorily will have
been pretty well settled by you by the
end of next week, and settled by your
keeping either ahead of or behind
your work. Fifteen hours is enough to
carry as a rule.
"And let me remind you that the
professors in the university, one and
all. and without any exceptions what
ever. are your friends, and are sincere
ly interested in your welfare. The
exaggerated and picturesque stories
you may hear occasionally about the
unfairness, injustice and general in
competency of this and that and the
other professor, you are safe in setting
down as the figments of a lively im
agination. If these men were not
worthy of your respect and confidence
they would be here.
"The Trustees wish me to call the
attention of every one to the fact that
while everything that belongs to the
university, its campus, its buldings,
books, benches, apparatus, and every
thing else. Is for the use and benefit of
the students, it is expected of us all

that we shall pass these things to fu
ture students in good condition.
"I am asked what progress is being
made here in the way of government
by the students. I should like to put
that question to the students them
selves. Student government must of
necessity rest with the students, and
whenever they are ready to undertake
it, you may be sure it will be gladly
putin their hands.
"A last word to new students: Most
of you, I have no doubt, realize that
you have now arrived at a time and
place when you are to be entrusted
with some of the serious responsibili
ties of life. Do not forget that flabbi
ness of body and mind and character
come from the lack of effort —from
the habitual use of the way of least
resistance.
"You will find, every one of you,
that it is a Man's work that lies before
you—now and henceforth. Do not be
appallel by it, but do not underesti
mate its difficulties and importance.
Be of good courage, take care of your
bodies, take a cheerful view of life,
and if the way seems rough or even
impossible, remember that struggle,
effort, training, self-mastery—these,
and these only, make men and women
of force and fibre."
Dr. Stillniii 11 Speaks.
Dr. Stillman was the next speaker.
After briefly outling his recent trip,
which he took during his seven month's
absence from the campus, he said:
"After I had seen all these things, I
was glad, nay even inpatient, to turn
my face back to California and to Stan
ford University. It is fine to be in a
nation that is young, and in a univer
sity that is young and not too much
overloaded with traditions. I am glad
to be back at work again. The back
bone of happiness consists in working
at an occupation that demands steady,
hard work.
"I, too. wish to extend a word ot
welcome to the new students. You
will find generally that the men of the
faculty are hard working men, and
that they enjoy their work. They
work hard in order that they may en
joy their work. They enjoy their con
tact with students.
"As a student here you should lie
interested in everything that is ger
mane to and not destructive of the pur
poses of the university. You will have
to work for your professors. That
is demanded of you. You on the other
may work the professors as much as
you can."
Opportunities for Work.
Professor Cubberley was introduced
as the next speaker by Dr. Branner.
He said in part:
"It is good to be back —as Chappie
says—and to feel that you are once
more in this delightful place. I ha\*
drifted here and there for the last five
years among educational centers, Ihk
nowhere do you find such climate,
nowhere do you find such opportuni
ties for work, nowhere do you find
a faculty so much at your service a
you do here.
"You are not likely to appreciate
the advantages until you are away.
1 met an old grad not very long ago.
Ho said 'I am sorry that I ever went to
Stanford. It has made me absolutely
unfitted to live anywhere else."
After comparing some of the points
of similarity between Harvard and
Stanford, the speaker continued:
"Stanford was the gift of all that
a man and woman had for the founding

E. J. Hadley, 'OS. is visiting on the
campus. He was a former editor of
the Chaparral. Since his graduation
he has been connected with eastern
magazines. H. Raymond. '08. who was
manager of Chappie during Hadley's
time, is also here.

tain of the 12-3 game in 1908. is here.

of an institution
for all the men
and women of
California. Both
Stanford and Har
vard were found
ed in the spirit of
devotion. Harvard
stands for service
to the state, the
highest ideals, pi
ety, learning, and
gentlemanly con-

(luct. Stanford was founded pre
eminently for service. Religious de
votion has been replaced by devotion
to the state, however, since Harvard
was founded.
"Our whole life here at Stanford
stands for an ideal and energy to pur
sue that ideal—a devotion to some
thing worth while.
"Harvard and Stanford are much
alike as to the future. Stanford, like
the eastern universities, must depend
on its alumni for its support, to ad
vance the interests of the university,
for endowments, and for its good
name. At present we have one of the
finest of engineering schools. We
have recently established a slendid
school of law. And we are building
up a school of medicine which will
find its purpose in coping with and
solving the questons of Oriental dis
eases.
"We may soon need a great school
of Political Science, a great school of
Sanitation, of Education. We may
found a school of religion without
denomination, but which shall have as
its purpose the teaching of those
eternal verities which underlie every
thing. This university should be
made even stronger by effort.
"The demand of the university is for
men who will prepare for leadership,
men who have the vision, who keep
their eyes on the horizon, who have
a broad outlook on life.
"In comparison with Harvard this
university is greatest in its opportun
ites. It has advantages which should
make it a university greater than any
on the Atlantic coast —a truly great
university built on the basis of ser
vice rendered."
The Exposition Class.
Dr. Gardner spoke in part as fol
lows: "You members of the class of
1915 are the Exposition class. When
I look at you I wonder which among
you will write the class will, and
which the class history. You must
build day by day and hour by hour
so that that will and history will con
tain nothing except events worthy of
recording.
"You have two privileges here at
Stanford that are offered to but few
men. The first is the privilege of
friendship. And if you can choose a
friend among this group of the most
democratic young women on the con
tinent you are a lucky dog.
"More and more the students of
Stanford are recognizing in the faculty
their friends. And the friendship that
exists between Stanford men extends
around the world. You will find it in
Rome and in China. It is, however,
not something to trade on but some
thing to be worthy of.
"The second privilege that you have
here is the privilege of opportunity.
Your clothes may count at the sta
tion but they do not count in the uiv
versity. Remember that. Be thank
ful for the privileges you enjoy. Do
all you can to elevate the life of your
fellow students, by elevating friend
ship. by making Stanford the glorious
mother of noble hearted, clean limb
ed. Christian gentlemen, and modest
spiritually minded women.
"I welcome you to the moonlight
on the Quad: to the sunlight on the
hills: to the fellowship of Stanford
spirit that makes all comrades and
makes all of us brave and true."
