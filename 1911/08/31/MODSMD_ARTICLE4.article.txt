## GATHERING IS SET FOR SEVEN In Evening. Schaupp, Angell, Moulton, Presley, and Erb, Will Address Enthusiastic Rooters. 
### 
Beneath the historic sandstone walls
of Encina's Clubroom tomorrow night,
at 7 o'clock, there will be ushered in
with songs, yells and cheers, the twen
ty-first year of football at Stanford.
Every man, whether Upperclassman
or Underclassman, who is physically
fit to play rugby, will be asked to sign
up.
The best of the Rally talkers have
been secured to mount the table, and
the highest brand of live wire talk is
ready. K. L. Schaupp, '12, Student
Body President and Captain of the
victorious eight of last spring, is.
chalked up for the opening speech.
Into no better hands could the start
of the enthusiasm be given.
Professor F. Angell, Chairman of the
Faculty Committee on Athletics, wiii
come next. Dr. Angell has been a keen
supporter of athletics since they were
started at Stanford, and in all his rela
tions with them he has been a strong
champion of true sportsmanship.
Every Stanford man listens eagerly
to all that "Dad" Moulton has to say,
and he will be the third speaker.
"Dad" always has some wholesome
advice and never fails to tell a clever
story.
Coach George J. Presley's appear
ance on the boards as the next speaked
will be a sufficient cause for any
amount of enthusiasm. Presley sel
dom gives much information, but what
he says he means. He has a way of
stating things that make people think.
Captain B. E. Erb, probably one of
the best all-round players who ever
trod the Stanford gridiron, will be tho
last talker of the evening. Then men
of all classes will be called to sign
the roster for the fall training season.
Cheers, songs and yells will inter
sperse the evening's program, under
the direction of S. C. Kennedy, '12.
