# Stanford, the Under Dog.
## 
### 
Tomorrow night the football rally
calls every Stanford man to give per
sonal support to a coach we believe

in and a man we res
pect, G. J. Presley, and
to the Varsity's cap-
B. E. Erb. The least

that the students can do is to show by
their presence that they are with these
two leaders. Let us enter the coming
season with confidence in them and
the men they chose for a team, with
no criticisms and with every ounce
of spirit and faith in victory that we
have in us.
Every year Stanford must get a
team out of a student body less than
one-half the size of our opponents.
Not only have we held our own against
such great odds, but we have created
a record in consecutive victories that
was only ended two years ago. 1907
saw Stanford victorious over Califor
nia in the five leading sports. Such
an exhibition of pluck and fight is
perhaps unequalled among American
colleges. Brown competing with Yale
and Harvard in the East is probably
the nearest approach to it.
Conditions have not changed since
1907. We still have the men and tlu
confidence in ourselves. Living in a
concentrated community as we are
here we can still hold our own. And
the more credit to us if we do. The
underdog deserves double praise when
he comes out on top.
