# PRESIDENT JORDAN WRITES APPRECIATION OF DR. DUDLEY
## Life of Stanford's Great Botanist Who Died June 4, is Reviewed by Friend of Forty Years. 
### 
William Russell Dudley, Professor
of Systematic Botany in Stanford
University, was born on March 1, 1849,
and died at Los Altos, June 4, 1911.
A biographical sketch appears in
the August 4th issue of "Science,"
written by Dr. David Starr Jordan,
The two scientists were intimately
associated while Professor Dudley was
a member of the Freshman Class at
Cornell University, in September, 1870.
Dr. Jordan was at that time "Instruc
tor in Botany" in Cornell.
By DAVID STARR JORDAN.
Young Dudley had an intense de
light in out-door things and especially
in flowers and birds. He wanted to be
a botanist, and had turned from old
Yale, to which as a descendant of
Chittendens, Griswolds and Dudleys
he would naturally have gone, to new
Cornell, because Cornell offered spec
ial advantages in science, and because
at Cornell a good man could, if need
be, pay his own way. For the rest
of my stay at Cornell, Dudley was my
room-mate. For a time Dudley paid
his way by rising at four o'clock to
milk cows at the farm. Later he was
made botanical collector, and this con
genial work he kept up until he became
my successor as instructor in botany.
In college Dudley was a member of
the Delta Upsilon fraternity. He was
also a charter member in the honorary
scientific society of Sigma Xi.
Dudley graduated from Cornell in
1874, with degree of B. S. In 1876.
he received the degree of M. S., after
which he spent some time hi botanical
study in Strassburg and Berlin. From
1572 to 1876 he was instructor in
botany at Cornell, his eminent know
ledge of the eastern flora overbalancing
the fact that at first he had not yet re
ceived a degree. From 1876 to 1592
he was assistant professor of botany
at Cornell, with a year's absence in
ISBO, in which he served as acting pro
fessor of Biology in the University of
Indiana, in the absence of the present
writer, who then held that chair.
In 1892. Professor Dudley became
professor of systematic botany at Stan
ford University, which position he
held until, in January, 1911, failing
health caused his retirement on the
Carnegie Foundation as professor
emeritus, his work being then taken
by one â€¢ of his students. Associate
Professor Le Roy Abrams.
.Many of the leading botanists of
the country have been students of
Professor Dudley.
In Stanford University, Dudley was
one <if the most respected as well as
best beloved members of the faculty.
No one could come near to him with
out recognizing the extreme refine
ment of his nature; a keen intellect,
an untiring joy in his chosen work,
and the perceptions of his own duties
to himself and a generous recogni
tion of the rights and the aspirations
of others.
Dudley entered with great joy into
the study of the California flora. He
became especially interested in the
study of trees, the evolutionary re
lations of forms and especially the
problems of geographical distribution.
The conifers of California were hit?
special delight, and he made many
field trips with his students to all
parts of the state, notably to the
Sierra Nevada and the Sierra Santa
Lucia. His extended collections were
presented to Stanford University,
where, with the collections of Dr.
Abrams, they form the major part of
the large "Dudley Herbarium."
Dudley was instrumental in induc
ing the state of California to purchase
a forest of redwoods (Sequoia seni
pervirens), that this, the second of
California's giant trees, might be pre
served in a. state of nature. Two
thousand five hundred acres in the
Big Basin" of Santa Cruz Countv

were thus bought and established as
the "Sempervlrens Park." For sever
al years Dudley served on the board of
control of this park.
Of the Sierra Club of California,
Dudley was a leading member and for
some years a director.
As an investigator, Professor Dud
ley was persistent and accurate, doing
his work for the love of it. A partial
list of his papers is given below. A
large work on the conifers of the west
was long projected, but still exists
only in uncompleted manuscript.
