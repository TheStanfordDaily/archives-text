Oakland, reveals the names of C. C.
Taylor, '11, and E. P. Campbell, '13,

Taylor has been a consistent per

spring he ran a dead heat with Lea

The veteran athlete has also been a

Campbell and Taylor are entered as
scratch men in furlong and quarter
mile dashes. These events, however,
are shortened to 176 and 352 yards
