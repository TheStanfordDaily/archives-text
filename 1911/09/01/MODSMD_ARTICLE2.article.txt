# SOPHOMORE PLANS PERFECTED FRESHMEN GET TOGETHER.
## Both Under Classes Complete Their Filial Arrangements for Rush Tomorrow Afternoon. 
### 
The big annual Freshman-Sopho
more rush will tomorrow hold the
attention of the college public. Com
mittees from 1914 and 1915 have been
engaged today in marking out the
field and building "morgues" for the
reception of captives. All details were
perfected by both classes in meetings
today.
The Sophomores will meet in front
of Encina at 3 o'clock tomorrow. Offi
cial bandages and final instructions
will be given to the men by F. W.
Wickman, chairman of the Sophomore
Committee.
The Freshmen will gather on the
Encina Gymnasium field at the same
hour.
All men who have tennis shoes are
requested to wear them. The rule
that both hands and feet must be
tied is especially emphasized.
