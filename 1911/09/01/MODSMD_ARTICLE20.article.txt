Prospects for tennis are brighter this

veterans of last year's team are back
and are eligible. These men are: Cap
tain R. L. Murray, '12, H. S. Morgan,
'12, last season's captain, F. S. Pratt,
'13, and H. W. Dawson, '14, Tennis
champion of the University. Two very
promising players have entered with
the 1915 class, W. Hutchinson, of Palo
Alto, and V. Sheldon, of Los Angeles.
Both were interscholastic champions
last year.
Added impetus has been given to the
fall tournament by the donation of a
beautiful loving cup by the Regent
Haberdashery, of Palo Alto. This
trophy is to be contested for each
September and is to be a perpetual
prize. The tourney will be a handi
cap affair and open to all. Further
details will be announced later.
