# CORNELL METHOD WILL BE USED HERE
## CROSS COUNTRY RUNNING TO DEVELOP TRACK MEN. Club Formed for Purpose of Strengthening Distance Men for the Track Squad. 
### 
Primarily for the purpose of devel
oping distance track men among
undergraduates, a Cross Country Club
is being organized by several Stan
ford athletes. A special call has
been issued to all undergraduates,
particularly Freshmen and Sopho
mores, to identify themselves with
the organization and to turn out for
practice runs.
The club is the outgrowth of a con
ference of Trainer "Dad" Moulton,
Captain T. L. Coleman, '12, C. L.
Moore, '12, and G. Bevier, '11, at the
conclusion of the 1911 spring track
season. Although plans have not yet
been completed, a half dozen of last
season's track squad already have
signed with the club.
Practice runs three times a week,
Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, at
4:30, from the training houses are
planned. It is quite probable that
a full credit in hygiene will be allowed
by the department, as setting up exer
cises will be given preliminary to each
day's work. A cross country meet,
open to all students in the university,
is arranged for this fall. The Regent
store in Palo Alto has offered a cup
for this contest. When held three
times by one athlete, the cup becomes
his property. The names of the win
ners will be engraved thereon.
"Victory in the Stanford-California
track meet will rest largely with the
distances, this year," said "Dad" Moul
ton, today.
"Cross country clubs were greatly
responsible for Cornell's remarkable
victories in the distances this spring.
It generally is conceded that Cornell
has the best distance men in 'the
East and the Cornell Cross Country
club has been a powerful factor in
developing these men.
"On the coast, Pomona college owes
the development of her winning dis
tance men largely to the cross coun
try club. This work has put Pomona
leges in the distances."
The successful organization and per
manence of the club depends much
upon the number of men who sign up
now. In the beginning the work wili
be light. For the first two or three
weeks the practice will not be heavy
in order that those who have had no
previous track experience may have
opportunity to become accustomed to
the runs. Every Stanford man inter
ested may communicate at once with
C. L. Moore, at Chi Psi Lodge, or G.
Bevier, in Encina Hall.
