# RUGBY RULES COMMITTEE MEETS TOMORROW.
## Erb and Burbank Will Represent Stanford at Annual Gathering at, St. Francis Hotel. 
### 
At the St. Francis Hotel, tomorrow
evening, at 8:30, the representatives
from Stanford and California on the
Intercollegiate Rules committee will
hold a meeting to discuss a revision
of the Rugby Code now in force be
tween the two universities. Coach
Presley, Captain Erb and Graduate
Manager Bnrbank will represent the
Cardinal. Coach Schaeffer, Captain
Elliott and Graduate Manager Farmer
will represent the Blue and Gold con
tingent.
The rules relating to the drop-out
from the twenty-five yard line and the
position of the ball after a player
runs into touch have been changed
recently by the English Rugby Union,
and these points will undoubtedly be
dwelt upon at the meeting with a view
to standardizing them with the Eng
lish code.
This meeting is the annual affair
called for by the present Intercollegi
ate agreement which sets the first
Saturday in September as a day of
meeting.
