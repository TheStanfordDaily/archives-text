# PROSPECTS IN DEBATING LOOK REASSURING
## OPPORTUNITY THIS SEMESTER FOR ORATORS. Intercollegiate Debate Date May be Changed to First Semester by Action of Committee. 
### 
Disciples of the forensic art have a
busy season in store for them, and the
opening of the semester finds deba
ting interest and prospects both of the
best. Chances seem bright for a suc
cessful year in the literary societies
and victories on the platform in the
inter-collegiate contests.
Euphronia Literary Society has an
nounced a business meeting for next
Tuesday evening, and it is expected
that the Nestorians will convene at
the same time, while both clubs will
hold their first literary sessions one
week from that date. Presidents E. E.
Tincher, *12, of Nestoria, and W. Tuck
er, Jr., '12, of Euphronia, extend a
cordial invitation to all freshmen in
terested in forensic or literary work,
whether experienced or not ,to attend
these literary meetings.
Numerous debating events are
scheduled for this semester. The
first of these will be the annual Fresh
man-Sophomore debate, and the time
honored rivals are already evincing
interest in this clash.
It is probable that the intercollegiate
debate will take place this year on the
Friday before the Big Game. Senti
ment is strong, both here and at Cal
ifornia in favor the change, which
would relieve the crowded debating
calendar of the second semester. The
matter will be decided next week, when
the debating committees of the two
colleges hold their joint meeting.
The fifty dollar Edward Berwick,
Jr., Peace Prize will be competed for
in the latter part of November, and the
Bonnheim Ethical Dissertations and
Discussion are also on the docket for
this semester. The general subject
of this contest for 1911 has been an
nounced as "Professional Ethics."
The essays are due at the Registrar's
Office, November 9. The judges will
announce the Bonnheim premiums
November 22, and the discussion is to
take place December 1.
While H. R. Person, '12, and E. E.
Tincher, '12, are the only two eligible
veterans of an Intercollegiate Debate
who have registered this semester, it
is believed that with these two men as
a nucleus and a wealth of less experi
enced material to draw from winning
teams can be evolved. A debater who
is expected to prove of much strength
to the Cardinal during the remaining
three years of his college course is
W. B. Owens, '14, who last year won
places on the team which debated the
University of Oregon, and on the
Freshman class team. Owens' col
league in the Washington debate, A. G.
Bradford, '13, is sure to be heard from,
and the other members of the victori
ous Freshman team, C. C. Close and
O. H. Castle, have returned to Stan
ford. The entering class contains nu
merous speakers with enviable pre
paratory school reputations, and, with
the old stand-bys and these new re
cruits to draw upon, it seems safe to
believe that when the year's debating
record is reviewed in the Spring of
1912 it will bring a glow of satisfac
tion to the Stanford orators.
