# AMONG THE COLLEGES
## OUR FRIEND THE ENEMY 
### 
Football.—California has lost a num
ber of veteran Varsity men. Last
year's captain, Dwiggins, Jordan, the
giant lock, Harris, the shifty rear
ranker, Markwart, front rank, Ashley,
side rank, Dills, wing three-quarters,
and Dolan, the Nevada forward, who
was eligible this year, are gone. No
new material of previous Rugby
reputation has entered with the Fresh
man class.
The veteran scrum men who are
eligible this year are Pauly, Swarts,
Phleger, Hansen, Hardy, Carpenter,
and Wheeler. King, a 220 pound soph
omore, and Fleming should make
strong bids for the team. California's
weakness at the outset of the season
will be a weak scrum.
The one hole in the backfield which
needs filling is the fullback position
left vacant by Dwiggins. Price, who
played the position against Victoria,
last Christmas, will be a strong can
didate for the place, as will Rodgers,
who played well in many games last
year. Should these men not perform
satisfactory Peart may be given the
place and his place on the line filled
by Evans, a last year's player.
E. G. Clewe and H. N. Rogers have
been nominated for president of the
Senior class. R. G. Sproul was unani
mously elected to lead the Junior class,
E. R. Crabbe and O. B. Smith will con
test the Sophomore presidency. C. R.
Hills and J. B. Junor are in nomina
tion for the Freshman leadership. The
elections in the four classes will be
held on September 6.
With elections in the air, the ques
tion of politics has pushed itself 1
forward into the limelight. A year or
more ago active agitation was begun
against "politics" as they then existed.
The methods in vogue at that time
included frequent caucuses, card sys
tems and the absolute pledging of
votes. The reform movement brought
about a complete reversal of the old
order and led the methods to (he
extreme in the opposite direction. At
the next elections the habits of the
past were discontinued, and the "no
politics" slogan caused a lack of in
terest and almost a complete avoid
ance of discussion of candidates. For
this election the happy medium in
politics is recommended. The"Daily
Calfornian" says "Actual pledging is
not to be tolerated at all, but frank,
sensible discussion of the merits of
the respective candidates is greatly
to be desired. If a man earnestly be
leves in the ability of another and
thinks him the best for the position,
it is his privilege and perhaps his duty
to attempt to convince others of his
friends' worth. But here in college
no man is justified in pledging his
vote or in attempting to obtain a
pledge, either written or verbal, from
another.
The "perfect man" has been discov
ered among the Freshmen in the per
son of C. H. A. McKim. It has been
found that he typifies the desired pro
duct for the physical culture depart
ment of the institution. The purpose
of careful study of every student and
of scientific training in the gymasium
exercises is to graduate from the uni
versity men who will in some degree
represent the standard of physical
fitness that was McKim's possession
when he enrolled as a student. McKim
is registered from Pomona.

the next elections the habits of the
past were discontinued, and the "no

this election the happy medium in

not to be tolerated at all, but frank,

The "perfect man" has been discov

son of C. H. A. McKim. It has been
found that he typifies the desired pro

of careful study of every student and
of scientific training in the gymasium
exercises is to graduate from the uni

represent the standard of physical

number of the year is now on sale.
H. L. Meyer is being given a trial
at center with the blue and gold
babies. Meyer has had considerable
experience in the San Francisco Rugby
Football.—California has lost a num
ber of veteran Varsity men. Last
year's captain, Dwiggins, Jordan, the
giant lock, Harris, the shifty rear
ranker, Markwart, front rank, Ashley,
side rank, Dills, wing three-quarters,
and Dolan, the Nevada forward, who
was eligible this year, are gone. No
new material of previous Rugby
reputation has entered with the Fresh
man class.
The veteran scrum men who are
eligible this year are Pauly, Swarts,
Phleger, Hansen, Hardy, Carpenter,
and Wheeler. King, a 220 pound soph
omore, and Fleming should make
strong bids for the team. California's
weakness at the outset of the season
will be a weak scrum.
The one hole in the backfield which
needs filling is the fullback position
left vacant by Dwiggins. Price, who
played the position against Victoria,
last Christmas, will be a strong can
didate for the place, as will Rodgers,
who played well in many games last
year. Should these men not perform
satisfactory Peart may be given the
place and his place on the line filled
by Evans, a last year's player.
E. G. Clewe and H. N. Rogers have
been nominated for president of the
Senior class. R. G. Sproul was unani
mously elected to lead the Junior class,
E. R. Crabbe and O. B. Smith will con
test the Sophomore presidency. C. R.
Hills and J. B. Junor are in nomina
tion for the Freshman leadership. The
elections in the four classes will be
held on September 6.
With elections in the air, the ques
tion of politics has pushed itself 1
forward into the limelight. A year or
more ago active agitation was begun
against "politics" as they then existed.

included frequent caucuses, card sys
tems and the absolute pledging of
votes. The reform movement brought
about a complete reversal of the old
