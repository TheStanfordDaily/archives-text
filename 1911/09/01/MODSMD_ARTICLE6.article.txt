# "FATINITZA" IS INITIAL OPERA OF SEMESTER.
## Schubert Club Anonunces Presentation on October 20. Preliminary Tryouts Monday Afternoon. 
### 
The Schubert Club has announced
a production of "Fatinitza," by Franz
Von Suppe, for October 20, as the
initial operatic effort of the semester.
Preliminary tryouts for the princi
pal parts will be held at 2:."]0 o'clock,
Monday afternoon at the Delta Gamma
house. The entire cast will lie chosen
as soon as possible in order that ample
time may be had to rehearse the piece
to a noteworthy production.
The direction of the opera ifc to be
in the hands of Walter Bartlett, whose
professional and amateur work is well
known to university students. Mr.
Bartlett has directed other produc
tions of "Fatinitza," and is exception
ally prepared to handle the Stanford
presentation in view of this experi
ence. The success of the "Mikado,"
"The Chimes of Normandy," and the
"Uvernian Princess," by university
students is largely due to the efficient
direction of Mr. Bartlett.
The Schubert club desires that a
large number enter the tryout that
a wide selection may be given for the
individual parts. " 'Fatinitza' offers
splendid opportunity for a magnificent
production, and the characters are
sufficiently diversified to afford vehi
cles for the ingenuity of many who
have taken part in former campus
comic operas," said .Miss I. Burnside,
of the Schubert club.
"The selection of the cast and the
arrangement of the choruses will be
carried through with dispatch by the
director, assisted by club committees."
The opera is in three acts with
twenty-six characters in the cast.
The story presented concerns the diffi
culties of a young Circassian lieu
tenant, Vladimir Samoiloff. with whom
a rough old general. Count Timofey
Kanchukoff. becomes enamored while
the young officer is masquerading in
girl's dress.
