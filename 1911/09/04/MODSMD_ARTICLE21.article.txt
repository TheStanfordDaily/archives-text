# SPECIAL CHURCH SERVICE SECURES BIG ATTENDANCE
## MANY NEW STUDENT PRESENT AT CHAPEL. Leaders of Student Life on Campus Speak of Spiritual Life of College. 
### 
Dr. Gardner's assertion that "today
there is a more earnest and reverent
attitude toward religion than ever
before among Stanford students" was
apparently sustained by the large
attendance at the Matriculation Ser
vice yesterday. K. L. Schaupp, '12,
President of the Student Body, read
the scripture lesson. Short addresses
were given by Student Adviser Roth
and Chaplain D. Charles Gardner.
Roth's talk consisted of a welcome
to the new students and a straight
forward appeal to them to appreciate
the chapel service and what it stands
for in their university life. He likened
the four years of college to the con
struction of a bulding, and laid before
the Freshmen the most important
materials with which to build. He
said that the University offers thrÂ«e
fields in which to dwell: That for
mental training, for physical develop
ment, and for character building. He
asserted that the only true type of
Stanford man is he who leaves his
Alma Mater perfectly established in
all three.
Dr. Gardner preached a sermon
without a text, choosing as his gen
eral subject "The University and its
Ideal of Character Building." He
followed the same train of thought as
the preceding speaker. While the Uni
versity aims to build fhe body strong
and mould the mind, yet its supreme
interest is the education of the con
science, in the moral quality of the
student life. He emphasized the idea
that we are here to learn to live as
well as to think. Three great needs
of the student were outlined, power
and purpose, loyalty to the better self,
and will to carry the good thought
into the deed. In closing, Dr. Gard
ner impressed three warnings upon
the Freshmen: first, since study
creates scepticism, to remember that
the final test of truth is in our own
soul; secondly, to begin college life
in the spirit of consecration; and,
thirdly, to seek in religion a motive
and purpose of life and then to prac
tice what you profess."
