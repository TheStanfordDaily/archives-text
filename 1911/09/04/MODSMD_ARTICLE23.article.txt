## NO FACULTY MEMBER MAY SERVE AS HEAD OF HALL. Miss Hyatt Will Remain at Stanford As Assistant in Physics Department. Miss Shirley Hyatt, who for two 
### 
years has acted as matron of Roble
Hall, has resigned her position, and
will devote her entire time to her work
as assistant in the Physics department.
Miss Hyatt's resignation was brought
about under a ruling which makes it
impossible for a matron of Roble
Hall to hold a faculty position.
During her two years as matron
Miss Hyatt has installed and per
fected a system of student government
by which the members of Roble Hall'
have entire charge of the hall. That
this system has been founded and
successfully worked is due entirely
to the interest and efforts of Miss
Hyatt, who, herself a Roble girl, has
given much thought and work to the
upbuilding of the hall.
Miss Hyatt's many friends in the
university will be glad to know that
the ending of her connection with
Roble Hall will not mean her depar
ture from Stanford, but that she will
remain as a member of the PhysicS
faculty, a position she has held for
several years.
