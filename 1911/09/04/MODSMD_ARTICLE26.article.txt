dition of Watt's knee is a serious
proposition for the coach to face.
Watts may round into shape.
♦ * * *
G. Stroud is moved forward to fill
the gap left by Harris. Allen and
Elliott will probably compose the five
eights line as they did two years ago.
Morris is first choice for half-back,
with Evans pushing him hard
♦ * * *
Of the second fifteen men, Mini,
Price and O'Hara will bid strong for
the fifteen.

A great museum of Anthropology
will be ready for the public soon at

ten years of work by experts from the
University sent out at the expense of
Mrs. P. A. Hearst into all parts of the
world. The cost of collecting these
works of uncivilized man has been
about $1,000,000, and the collection is
worth many times that sum.
