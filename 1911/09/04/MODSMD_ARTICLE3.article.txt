Twenty-five minutes after
Referee A. E. Roth fired the
starting gun, the last struggling
Freshman was dragged into
the overflowing Sophomore
"morgue," in the annual Cnder
class Rush last Saturday.
The Freshmen made a pood
fiirlit Imt the superior organiza
tion of the second-year fighters
and their familiarity with their
own men brought them victory.
The greatest struggles, and
those which furnished the most
amusement for the spectators,
were single-handed combats
near the Freshmen jail. Many
of the contestants picked out
former acquaintances and
strove to show their superiority
on the field of battle.
The 1915 contestants were
organized on the old Encina
baseball field by the members
of the Junior Class and were
properly instructed as to the
best means of passing through
the rope-tying contest. Each
Freshman was marked with
green paint in order that he
might be easily recognized by
his fellow classmen.
Final plans were made by the
Sophomores on the tennis
courts. Both classes marched
to the scene of action in battle
array, shouting the familiar
rush war-cries. The two or
ganizations seemed very evenly
divided as to numbers. A total
of three hundred and seventy
five men entered the contest.
The crowds took special de
light in the serpentine of the
battle-scarred and clothes-torn
victors after the contest.
