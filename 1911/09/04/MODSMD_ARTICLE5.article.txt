# PLAY CHOSEN BY SWORD AND SANDALS TO OPEN SEASON.
## "The World and His Wife" to be Presented Here September 29.- A Strong Play. 
### 
Sword and Sandals have chosen for
their first dramatic presentation of the
year the well known drama, "The
World and His Wife," by Nirdlinger.
Among all the strong plays that have
ever been chosen to be presented be
fore a Stanford audience this one
would probably rank the highest. It
is an Intense, stirring and wonder
fully written drama. The play is an
English adaptation by Nirdlinger from
the Spanish of Echegaray's "The
(Ireat Galeoto." This work is gen
erally acknowledged by students of
the drama to be the greatest play of
the greatest Spanish playwright.
Hesides the fact that the drama is so
supremely great it lacßs none of the
intense dramatic quality which is so

much a part of all Spanish drama. Tt
is a play that holds the audience from
the rise of the first curtain until the
close of the last act. Some idea of
the success of the work as a dramatic
vehicle can be gathered from the fact
that it was successfully played in New
York for a long run and on the road
as well by the N famous players, William
Faversham and Julie Op]).
Wherever the play was presented
it was received with rare appreciation
by all classes of audiences and by all
critics. It deals with the old situa
tion of the triangle—a man, his wife,
and a friend. In the case of this play,
however, the treatment is entirely new.
Scandal without cause or foundation
so surrounds these three in its meshes
that a tragedy of the blackest kind en
gulfs them all. The wife, the friend,
and the husband are all involved in
the lying scandal. Duels—for the play
is laid in Spain—follow, and the end
ing is as unexpected as it is tratcic.

The best talent of Sword and San
dals. the dramatic society, will be seen
in the performance. The cast has
been carefully chosen by P. L. Ma
thien. of San Francisco, who has been
chosen to coach the production. Re
hearsals began on Saturday and will
be held almost daily until the final
production on September 29. Already
many of the lines have been learned.
The lines are well adapted to quick
memorization and the hard work on
performance will begin within very few
rehearsals.
The east for the performance is as
follows: Don Julian, S. Brown, *13;
Donna Teodora, his wife, Miss Ger
trude Workman, '12; Don Severo,
E. F. Kern. '13; Don Pepito, their son,
C. S. Turpin. 13; Captain Reaulleu,
of the English Embassy, J. R. Reman,
'12; Don Ernesto, R. H. Seward, '12;
(ietiaro, concierge, I. T. Ingraham, '13;
The part of a servant is still to be
assigned.
