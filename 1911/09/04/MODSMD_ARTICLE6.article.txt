# ALUMNI WILL MAKE REPORT ON EATING HOUSE.
## Plan Submitted by Board of Trustees is Being Arranged by Advisory Committee. 
### 
In pursuance of the plans outlined
last year for the building of eating
clubs on the campus, the Advisory
Board of the Alumni Association are
at present at work on the plans made
by the Hoard of Trustees of the Uni
versity, when the question was brought
up last semester. On October 9 the
Advisory Board wil meet on the cam
pus when they will look over the local
situation and complete their report.
The method suggested by the Uni
versity Trustees is that the Advisory
Board lease the ground suitable for
the erection of the buldings at a nom
inal rent. This is the plan at present
employed by the Associated Students
in connection with the athletic fields
of the university.
Two men from the Alumni Associa
tion have promised to invest a certain
amount of money to help the venture
financially. The Advisory Board feel
sure that the rest of the money can be
raised and will appoint a committee
with that object in view, if their re
port is accepted by the Board of Trus
tees. The final work which will com
plete the report will be done by the
Advisory Board when they meet here
It will be necessary to raise in the
neighborhood of $15,000 to erect the
1 buldings as planned. Although the
i arrangements for the final buldings
1 are still uncertain, it is known that the
plans call for the erection of either
| one large structure or four smaller
ones which would take the place of
the large one.
I Elaborate preparations for the en
, tertainment of the Advisory Board
I when they visit the campus are being
1 made by a committee on the campus.
The Board will reach here early in
the morning and will remain for the
