When a coach who has had two
defeats is cheered seven minutes what
will happen when victory comes?
The rally, Saturday,
The Rally was a good proof of
and its Success the broad-minded
ness of the Stan
ford Student Body. And the spirit
shown was not manufactured for the
occasion. It filled the hearts of all,
and anyone who could sit still and
feel nothing when he heard the Band
playing the old tunes and the straight
from the shoulder talk from the spee
ches must have been a poor man, in
deed.
The rally succeeded. It brought
out the greatest number of men in the
history of Stanford football. It achiev
ed not only the immediate purpose of
securing men for the team, but it
helped clear the problem of a general
participation in athetics.
We must enter the coming season
with clear headedness, and under
standing of what we have to do. if
we defeat California we will have
accomplished a great thing. If we are
defeated we still have accomplished
much. For athletics will have opened
to a larger number of men, a result
in some respects more to be desired
even than trailing the Blue and Gold
in the dust. The California game must
be considerer as a means, not an end
in itself. It is the means to give
spirited enthusiasm to athletics. Tt is
the means to build up a splendid and
inspiring athletic machine, the Var
sity Team, and to give exercise and
training to all the men of the big
football squad.
