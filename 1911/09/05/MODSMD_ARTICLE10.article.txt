# English Club Play Committee Meets.
## 
### 
The English Club Play committee
met for the second time this year at
the Alpha Phi house to discuss the
play to be given this year. As yet
the date has not been decided, but it
is expected that it will be presented
sometime after the Schubert Club pre
sentation. The committee which has
this matter in charge includes Miss M.
Driscoll, '12, G. Parkinson, '13, D.
Parkinson, '18, and Messrs, G. In
gelow, '13, and L. Pickering, '09.
At the time of going to press no
definite plans have been decided upon,
but it is probable that a modern play
will be presented.
