# Suffrage League Discusses Plans.
## 
### 
The Suffrage League met yesterday
to discuss new plans and to give the
new members a general idea as to
what the club is doing. A short re
sume of the work done this summer
was given. It was suggested that a
competition be held for the writing
of an article on the Suffrage question.
The articles must be submitted dur
ing the next week to either Miss F.
Williams, '12, Miss L. Blanchard, '12,
or Miss R. A. Sampson, '09. The best
will be sent to the various counties
of the State.
An announcement was made that
Kate Haley, of Chicago, will speak
this Friday in Palo Alto on the sub
ject of Suffrage. Miss Haley is an able
speaker and is noted for her interest
and insight into the subject.
