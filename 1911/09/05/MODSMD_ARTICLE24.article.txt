# The 						Isolation Hospital.

### 
The isolation hospital is a reality.
Guild Hoards came and Guild Boards
went but the hospital stayed on.
Facts, however, brought to light in

a most marvelous way
and seemingly never
thought of before, show
the real magnitude of

the problem of a site for the isolation
of contagious plagues, the bugbear
of ordinarily sane people the world
over when their homes and children
are in danger through dangerous
diseases.
Private persons, municipalities, the
county government themselves all
joined seemingly to make this prob
lem a perplexing one, by refusing all
possible locations for the hospital.
It is no wonder then that in the
tangle and in the successive changes
of the Guild Boards that misunder
standings of a personal nature arose;
that ill-feeling grew up like a mush
room in the night; and that enemies
were made where they had been
friends before.
The Daily Palo Alto believes in
justice and frank speaking. It seems
that the Board of Trustees were simply
showing unusual care in not putting
the hospital too near the crowded cam
pus, and that they, too, had their
troubles in securing a site that was at
once far enough away from a concen
trated community of two thousand
people, and not too close to other
communities who had their rights and
also possessed the ordinary human
quality of fright at things they don't
see.
It is therefore apparent that a cer
tain amount of injustice has been done
the Trustees, although there may be
some injustice to be considered on the
other side as well. The main thing is,
we have the hospital.
