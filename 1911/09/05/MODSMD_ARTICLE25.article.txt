# What we Need.
## 
### 
Tomorrow's assembly is the con
tinuance of a custom begun last year.
Its purpose is to bring the Student
Rody together at once in order that

all members may get a
clear and accurate under
standing of what is being
attempted each semester

in the way of policy, needed improve
ments and changes. Kvery man and
woman interested in harmony should
be present.
Criticism and ill-feeling often grow
out of misunderstanding. If members
of the Student Rody try their best to
enter into the plans put forward by
their officers, we see no reason why the
year should not be one of cooperation
and goodwill. A good way to uncover
the motives of the student leaders and
their sincerity is to be on hand to
morrow and listen to them.
An added stimulus to attendance
conies from the news note in another
column that the Women Students are
to have their share in the gathering
for the first time. There is no sane
or just reason why they should not
be represented. It. will lend interest
to the Assembly and will at the same
time correct a thoughtless omission
of last year.
