Editor Daily Palo Alto:
The Hoard of Directors of the Stu
dents' Guild wishes to announce that
the Board of Trustees of the Univer
sity has offered, and that the Guild
Board has accepted, a site for an isola
tion hospital for the care of such
contagious diseases us may occur
from time to time. The site consists
of a tract of about two and a half
acres, situated at the corner of the
Felt Ranch, near Felt Lake.
Until the establishment of a proper
hospital building, the Guild can assume
responsibility only in cases of such
contagious diseases as small-pox,
diptheria, measles, and scarlet fever,
as was undertaken last year, i.e., to
allow patients while under quarantine
and in care of a trained nurse, expense
money up to two dollars and a half
per day per patient
After the establishment of the isola
tion hospital all contagious diseases
that cannot be cared for under our
present contract will be kept in quar
antine in the new establishment under
the direct control of the Guild, thus
minimizing danger of an epidemic by
removing sources of infection from
the thickly populated portions of the
University community. The present
contract with the Peninsula Hospital
provides accommodations for all pa
tients except those suffering from dis
eases of such a nature as mentioned
above, which cannot safely be taken
into a general hospital, thereby mak
ing necessary the establishment of
such an institution as contemplated.
Yours very truly,
E. G. Cary, '09, President.
H. E. White, '11, Secretary.
