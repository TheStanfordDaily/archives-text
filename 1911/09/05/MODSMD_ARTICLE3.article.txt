# Orchestra Will Begin Year's Work.
## 
### 
The Orchestra will meet to-morrow
night, at 7:30 o'clock, in room OS, for
the purpose of re-organizing. The
first-year men are best adapted to a
permanent organization for the next
four years. R. Heal. '12, will succeed
H. D. Owens, '11, as leader. He makes
an especial appeal for new material.
It is proposed to have at least twen
ty instruments in the orchestra. Last
year there were considerably less than
this..1. H. Paine, '12, who was mana
ger last year will continue in that
position.
The orchestra is a prominent fea
ture in many of the University activi
ties. Its first appearance this year
is to be on September 29, at the
play "The World and His Wife," which
will lie presented in Assembly Hall,
bv Sword and Sandals.
