As anonunced in a communication
from the Hoard of Directors of th£
Students' Guild, printed in another
portion of this issue, the University
is to have an isolation hospital for
the care of contagious diseases. Af
ter hanging fire for several years
because of the difficulty of securing
a site for the building the negotiations
have finally been brought to a con
clusion by the final conference be
tween the Board of Trustees of the
University and the Directors of the
Guild.
Ever since the small-pox epidemic
of several years ago and particularly
since the measles epidemic of 1910,
the Directors of the Guild have ex
tended every effort to secure a suit
able location for the erection of tl£
hospital. Almost half a dozen sites
have been carefully considered but
for one reason or other it was
found necessary to abandon the pros
pect of securing them. The site that
has finally been secured from the
University Trustees is at the corner
of the Felt Ranch, Felt Lake.
One of the first sites considered was
one offered in Mayfield. It was suit
able for the erection of an isolation

hospital, but owing to the fact that it
was within the limits of an incor
porated town it could not be used for
such a purpose without violating thS
law. Another site was considered in
the Ravenswood tract to the south of
Palo Alto. This plot of two acres was
outside the city limits of Palo Alto,
but was unsuitable for the purposes
of a hispital owing to the fact that it
was too far from the Campus. An
other fact which prevented the ac
quisition of this site was the prohibi
tive price set upon it by the owner.
Another site was considered near the
Manzanita school. The owners of the
school objected to the erection of the
hospital there on the grounds that it
would jeopardize the health of the
pupils of the school. For this reason
this site was also abandoned.
At the time of the measles epidemic
in 1910 a site was chosen for the care
of the patients across the San Fran
cisquito creek. This was objected to
by the authorities of San Mateo county
as it is illegal to carry a person suffer
ing from a contagious disease from one
county to another. In this dilemna
it was decided that the only solution
of the problem was to place the hospi
tal on University ground. The tract
at Felt Lake was finally chosen.
Officers of the Guild are highly elat
ed over the outcome of the affair.
E. G. Cary, '09, President of the Guild,
said this morning:
"The officers of the Guild are well
pleased with the final result of their
efforts to secure the isolation hos
pital. We feel that the Student Body
of Stanford owe a debt of gratitude to
the University Trustees for the use of

the Felt Lake property for the erec
tion of the building."
With the announcement that the
plans for the hospital have been ar
ranged conies the statement that Dr.
C. H. Gilbert has resigned his position
as one of the Faculty representatives
on the Guild's Board of Directors. He
has been a member of this Hoard since
the Guild first came into existence. It
is to Dr. Gilbert more than to any one
person falls the credit of the success
of the Guild. Time and # time again
he has backed up the institution finan
cially, and his advise has been in
valuable at all times. As a final work
for the Guild immediately before his
resignation, he cleared the organiza
tion of a small deficit which it had
incurred. The other officers of the
Board of Directors feel that it will be
next to impossible to fill Dr. Gilbert's

has paid off the last $250 on the $5000

them for several years. The money
realized from this note was used to
purchase the old Peninsular Hospital
building in Palo Alto. Besides this
building the Guild owns two lots in
Palo Alto. In order to construct the
isolation hospital it will be necessary
to raise between eight and ten thou
sand dollars. This sum they expect
to realize from the sale of the two
lots. During the years in which the
note has been outstanding Dr. Gilbert
and Dr. J. O. Griffin have carried the
entire debt for the Guild. Had it not
been for the generositv of these two
members of the Faculty the Guild
and the isolation hospital would be
utter impossibilities.
