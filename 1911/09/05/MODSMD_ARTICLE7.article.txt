# Girls' Boat Club to Fleet Officers.
## 
### 
Though Lake Lagunita is dry it
does not follow that the girls' Hoat
Club is a thing of the past, and to
prove this an important meeting has
been called for next Friday at 1:10,
in room 200. The Boat Clubhouse at
the Lake has been painted a dark
green this summer. Vines have been
planted and the house further im
proved.
The meeting is called to discuss
the furnishings of the club. All Class
repesentatives will be elected.
