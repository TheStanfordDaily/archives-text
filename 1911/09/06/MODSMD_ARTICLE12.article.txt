in favor of their movement for the
franchise when suffragists en masse
from Palo Alto and the campus filled
room 214 of the English building and
listened to the forensic efforts of the
members of Euphronia to settle the
question of woman suffrage. G. N.
Wood, '13, and W. B. Owens, '14, up
held the claims of the fair sex, and
P. L. Leib, '13. with C. C. Close, '11.

gathered by the affirmative speakers.
The small sprinkling of the sterner
