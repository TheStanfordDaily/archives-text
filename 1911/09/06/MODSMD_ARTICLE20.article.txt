# HILL AND PICKERING AGREE WITH SHERMAN
## THEY SEE MEXICAN REVOLUTION NOT AS GUESTS. Stanford Men's Explanations in Spanish Fail to Explain Their Part In Warfare. 
### 
War is a glorious thing to peruse
In courses of the history department,
and to view from a distance through
glass lenses, but actual participation
therein is very likely to interfere
with meals and -lead to other un
pleasantness.
If this does not coincilde with pop
ular belief the experiences of L. Pick
ering, '09, and L. L. Hill, Ml, ex-editor
in-chief of the Daily Palo Alto, can be
brought to bear.
Pickering and Hill left Los Angeles
June 29 for an automobile tour.
Arriving across the border from Tia
Juana, they decided that it would be
a fine thing to go down where the to
basco was being opened by the Ma
eristas.
It was not quite clear why they
went, although the suspicion lurks
that war experience might prove ef
fective material for queening on the
Row this fall.
Disguised as newspaper corres
pondents, Pickering and Hill stepped
across the line and into trouble im
mediately. Hill did not get very far on
the other side beyond the protecting
wing of Uncle Sam's regulars, when
a squad of Maderistas detected his
presence. He was asked why he was
where he was, but his Spanish did not
explain. After being treated to sev
eral hours of suspense, in which he
saw visions of dungeons, he was re
turned across the line with a polite,
but unmistakable, warning to remain
there.
Pickering had better luck —at first,
His way was opened as far as the
troops of Governor Vega, where he
joined a detachment in search of
stragglers, said to be mostly Ameri
can vagabonds.
Pickering lost his way, and was
picked up by another party. He was
relieved of all his valuables and held
as a prisoner of war.
Meanwhile. Hill was enjoying the
hot sun on the American side, await
ing Pickering's return. When he did
not come back. Hill appealed to Cap
tain Williams, of the IT. S. regulars.
Pickering was found, and both return
ed to the United States and peace.
