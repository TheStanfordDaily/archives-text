# FRESHMEN ARE IMPROVING ON TURF FIELD.
## Scrum, With Plenty of Big Men, Looks Very Promising in Presley's Hands. 
### 
Setting-up exercises opened yester
day's rugby practice on the Auxiliary
Turf Field at 4:45. A slight note of
acceleration of speed was apparent
in the workout, over Monday's initial
appearance.
The Freshmen are rounding rapidly
into shape. Coach Presley has taken
the Freshman forwards into hand and
yesterday afternoon put them thru
scrum bucking. In this forward posi
tion there are plenty of big men and
the 101 r> scrum promises to be a stone
wall of defense, with plenty of spirit,
in offense.
Captain Erb had the Freshmen backs
in charge and divided the time between
drop kicking and the handling of the
pigskin on the run.
