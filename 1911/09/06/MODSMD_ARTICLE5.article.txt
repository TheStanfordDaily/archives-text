# Frankness Characterizes First Student Assembly
## Leaders of Organizations Deal With Big Questions in an Unusual Way. Greatest Year in History Is the Prediction 
### 
"Until the students of the univer
sity show that they are fit for self
government, the time for it has not
come," declared Karl L. Schaupp, '12,
President of the Student Body, in
his talk in the student assembly today.
"There is no doubt that this is going
to be the best year at Stanford, but
we must all pull together to make it
so, and stand together to see that it
is so.
"When a Stanford man sees a fel
low student doing wrong—and this
applies especially to the upper
classmen —it is his place to tell him
he is wrong. The executive committee
and the officers are not mind readers,
and it is the duty of each individual
to do all he can.
"We want student control and this
is the first step toward getting it
and getting it right. What we want
is a strong feeling of unity between
the faculty and the students.
"The faculty is now disposed to be
more favorable than at any time since
1 have been in the university," con
tinued President Schaupp. "Right
here, I would say a few words, es
pecially to the Freshmen. Do not let
someone else influence you to form
opinions prematurely. We expect
those in authority to do their duty.
Harsh measures are sometimes nec
essary, and it behooves the new stu
dents to understand this.
"The function of the great univer
sity is to produce men—big men. They
are never developed by petty squab
blings. Stanford men always stand
for Stanford out in the world, let us
stand for Stanford all the stronger
here.
"The general spirit of getting to

gether shown at the rally was magni
ficent. Coach Presley has managed a
losing team for two years. Did the
rally show lack of confidence in him?
No! The students knew that he had
put his best efforts into the team
under overtowering difficulties.
"It was not the game, but the spirit
of the university. California, with
double our number of students, sign
ed 190 for football. Two hundred and
nine Stanford men signed up, and 200
of them turned out for first practice."
President Schaupp explained the
organization of the student body and
the constitution of the various boards,
to the new students, imploring them to
get behind the officers —their servants.
Miss Moise Represents Women.
"One day, on Stanford field, a father
of two Stanford students enthusiasti
cally slapped Dad Moulton on the
back at a critical point in the game,"
related Miss N. E. Moise, President of
the Woman's League.

" J have two children in that tine
hunch,' said the father to Dad, point
ing to the bleachers.
" Why don't you have 'em sign up
for football?' asked the trainer.
'They're girls, man, they're girls,'
almost shouted the proud father.
"Girls can't play football, but they
are behind athletics every minute,"
continued Miss Moise. The invariable
purpose of the woman's League is to
interest as many girls as possible in
athletics.
"The Woman's League includes
every woman in the university. It is
the opportunity of the girls to show
the real Stanford spirit.
"For several years efforts have
been directed toward a clubhouse.
Pledges by the three higher classes
have furnished $6,500 cash, with
$5500 in pledges yet unpaid.
"We planned to start the clubhouse
in October, but it will require at least
$12,500 to begin the work. It is up to
you, 1915, to contribute to this fund,
that the dreams may be realized. It
will be your clubhouse for the longest
time. The higher classes have con
tributed loyally toward it, even though
it will not be theirs for long."
"You are Citizens,"
"Although primarily students, men
and women, I want you to forget that
you are students and remember that
| you are citizens of the Stanford world,"
said Graduate Manager D. W. Bur
bank.
"If you are Stanford citizens as you
must be, you hold the year in the hol
low of your hand. Its success is
yours. To you is given the task of
making it ideal by binding it in head

and heart. This will be the best
year Stanford ever had."
"The graduate manager, the stu
dent body officers and other officials
should reflect the ideas of the entire
student body. We need your help in
providing permanent things for Stan
ford.
"We have $45,000 invested in ath
letic fields, and money has been left
over in the last two years for per
manent improvements, clear of ex
penses. Hut the new baseball field,
the tennis courts and other new faci
lities will more than consume all of
this fund that is left.
"The season ticket plan has been
introduced this year, and every stu
dent should get behind the university
by buying a ticket."
H. C. Xelson, president of the Uni
versity Conference, addressed the
assemblage on behalf of this body.
The Ideal Student Control.
"A great deal is heard of student
control these days," said President
Nelson. "Doctor Branner told us
recently that as soon as we want it
we may have it.
"It is the broad idea of student con
trol that we want. The faculty offer
ed it to us once, but only a limited
idea of it. We want it in its entirety.
"There are vacancies on the Uni
versity Conference that soon must be
filled. (Jet together and putin the
best men, those who will give their
best efforts to the work. Students, do
your share in contributing to the work
of your officials, for they reflect you.
and you alone."
The address scheduled by A. E.
Roth. Student Adviser, was omittpd
because of insufficient time.
The Stanford Band played several
selections while the seats were filling,
and the music did much to make the
assembly a success.
Songs and yells were led by Yell
leader Kennedy. "12. "Hail. Stanford.
Hail." was sung in closing.
