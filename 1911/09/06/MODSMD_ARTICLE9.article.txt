# The
						Assembly and Frankness.
## 
### 
Plain speaking, and more of it. The
Assembly this morning was a good
example of frankness, and we need

it. It has been the
custom here to let
some things remain
unsaid, and it has

been just these things which gave rise
to idle talk, rumor, and the unstable
condition of the student mind caused
by false information. Few leaders
of our student body have ever said
what they meant and said it with em
phasis. Either it did not occur to
them to talk that way or they did not
dare.
Never before has the complete plan
of student control been taken out of
the province of dreams and uncertain
talk. The Daily Palo Alto is of the
opinion that few students 011 the cam
pus ever knew just exactly what was
required of them for control or what
"control" was. There were many
words "about and about" but never
before has a solid, concrete idea of
the long-looked for thing come to
light.
And the plan is to have a meeting
like this one has been each month.
The idea is a good one. After the new
ness of such gatherings has been worn
away, any amount of good may be
accomplishedâ€”but only by sincere
talking and 110 "beating about the
bush." Today has made a good begin
ning. Last year such an Assembly
was held and much was achieved.
But it did not go far enough. If the
officers of the Associated Students will
keep well in mind the example they
set, themselves, this morning, this
year will be a history-making one,
indeed.
