# NEW RULE MAY CAUSE BIG CHANGE IN RUGBY GAME
## TOUCH KICKING WOULD GO OUT OF USE. Eight Minute Set-tos Engaged in by Cardinal Squad on Stanford Field Yesterday. 
### 
Eight minute set-tos on Stanford
Field yesterday afternoon comprised
the rugby program for the Cardinal
squad. For only two days of prac
tice to base their work on, the after
noon's showing was entirely satis
factory.
The first scrummage was called be
tween the first Senior and first Sopho
more teams. This match was played
under the new rulings that are to be
adopted or discarded by the Intercol
legiate Agreement Committee at its
next meeting in San Francisco on
Saturday evening.
The rulings as tried yesterday
afternoon, read as follows: First—
Where the ball is kicked and pitches
into touch, it shall be played by a
scrum at the point from which it was
kicked. Second —When the ball is
kicked and rolls into touch it shall
be played by a scrum at right angles
to, and ten yards from, the point
where it passes into touch. The new
rulings do away with the line out,
transferring the ball to a scrum.
They aim to prevent the stalling and
delaying of the game, that a lineout
is prone to do, and bring more speed
and openness into the game. The
eventual effect of an adoption of the
rules is difficult to estimate.
The present football code known as
the American game was a split from
the English game of rugby and deve
loped along this line. To cut out the
line-out in the game now played
along the Pacific slope may be the
first step towards the creation of a
new style of football.
The remainder of the afternoon's
matches were played according to old
rules and the lineouts were again in
vogue. The four eight minute scrum
mages that followed were between the
second Seniors and second Sopho
mores; .juniors and first Freshmen;
second Juniors and second Freshmen,
and third and fourth Freshmen.
The afternoon's interest settled in
the onset between the Juniors and the
premier Freshmen aggregation. The
new men proved a tough argument for
the Juniors and the game netted
about even results, with the Juniors
playing better as a unit. The Fresh
men pack proved to be a heavy one,
and longer practice in the heeling
should make them a formidable group.
In the backfield some good combina
tion work was to be seen and some
very creditable passes cleanly engin
eered.. E. Clark, half; Risling and
Steinhart, fives; Sim, center: Harnett
and Wynne, wings, and Hutchinson
showed up well in the backfield divi
sion. Further practice promises
much for a Freshmen back division
In the other teams good material
was observed, and a hotly contested
fight is in sight for the positions in
the first group.
Saner, half on the third Freshman,
received a slight scratch across his
cheek that called for bandaging, lmt
it will not be serious enough to keep
him out of togs today.
1.. Hausawa, 'in, the first Japanese
to ever try out for a Cardinal rugby
team was seen in the front rank of
the third Freshmen. The staunch
son of Nippon played on the Lick
High fifteen forward division for two
years.

loped along this line. To cut out the
line-out in the game now played
along the Pacific slope may be the
first step towards the creation of a
new style of football.
The remainder of the afternoon's
matches were played according to old
rules and the lineouts were again in
vogue. The four eight minute scrum
mages that followed were between the
second Seniors and second Sopho
mores; .juniors and first Freshmen;
second Juniors and second Freshmen,
and third and fourth Freshmen.
The afternoon's interest settled in
the onset between the Juniors and the
premier Freshmen aggregation. The
new men proved a tough argument for
the Juniors and the game netted
about even results, with the Juniors
playing better as a unit. The Fresh
men pack proved to be a heavy one,
and longer practice in the heeling
should make them a formidable group.
In the backfield some good combina
tion work was to be seen and some
very creditable passes cleanly engin
eered.. E. Clark, half; Risling and
Steinhart, fives; Sim, center: Harnett
and Wynne, wings, and Hutchinson
showed up well in the backfield divi
sion. Further practice promises
much for a Freshmen back division
In the other teams good material
was observed, and a hotly contested
fight is in sight for the positions in
the first group.
Saner, half on the third Freshman,
received a slight scratch across his
cheek that called for bandaging, lmt
it will not be serious enough to keep
him out of togs today.
1.. Hausawa, 'in, the first Japanese
to ever try out for a Cardinal rugby
team was seen in the front rank of
the third Freshmen. The staunch
son of Nippon played on the Lick
High fifteen forward division for two
years.
Eight minute set-tos on Stanford
Field yesterday afternoon comprised
the rugby program for the Cardinal
squad. For only two days of prac
tice to base their work on, the after
noon's showing was entirely satis
factory.
The first scrummage was called be
tween the first Senior and first Sopho
more teams. This match was played
under the new rulings that are to be
adopted or discarded by the Intercol
legiate Agreement Committee at its
next meeting in San Francisco on
Saturday evening.
The rulings as tried yesterday
afternoon, read as follows: First—
Where the ball is kicked and pitches
into touch, it shall be played by a
scrum at the point from which it was
kicked. Second —When the ball is
kicked and rolls into touch it shall
be played by a scrum at right angles
to, and ten yards from, the point
where it passes into touch. The new
rulings do away with the line out,
transferring the ball to a scrum.
They aim to prevent the stalling and
delaying of the game, that a lineout
is prone to do, and bring more speed
and openness into the game. The
eventual effect of an adoption of the
rules is difficult to estimate.
The present football code known as
the American game was a split from
the English game of rugby and deve
loped along this line. To cut out the
line-out in the game now played
