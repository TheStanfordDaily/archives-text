## 
### 
Debating enthusiasts from the
Freshman class gathered last night
in room 214 of the English building
in answer to the call of F. H. Hilton,
I'll, chairman of the Intersociety He
bating League. The purpose of tlie
meeting was to interest the new mei.
in the forensic art and to discuss th
advisability of forming a Freshmen
debating society, as has been the cus
tom in the past.
Several of the upperclass orators
pointed out the disadvantages of such
a move, and after considerable discus
sion the first year men decided not to
.form an organization. Hilton and W.
Tucker. '12, president of Euphronia.
gave the 1915 debaters an outline of
the contests of the year and urged
every man to come out and try for
positions on the university teams.
