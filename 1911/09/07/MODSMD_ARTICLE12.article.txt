We regret to hear of the resigna
tion of the Permanent Secretary of
the Stanford Union. Mr. Barrett has

been ready always to
do his best in advanc
ing the interests of the
Club House. He luu

accomplished much among under
graduates and alumni, and especially
among the latter. Hut he resigned in
order that a Secretary might be ap
pointed who is near to the conditions
on the campus, a resident here, and
possibly a student. The alumni have
more than done their share towards
the erection of the building. Mr. Bar
rett has seen to that. The thing to
do now is to secure the support of the
students more substantially.
