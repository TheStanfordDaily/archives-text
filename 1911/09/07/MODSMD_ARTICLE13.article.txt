# The 						Stanford Name.
## 
### 
Is the Stanford name to be used
indiscriminately by anyone for their
own profit and at their pleasure, for
any function whatsoever? The stu
dent Affairs Committee, in the first
communication in the next column
very properly calls attention to the
fact that the Stanford name "requires
its proper safeguard and authoriza
tion." That seems to us right.
It may appear that there is a goo.,
deal of "red tape" in the necessity
for securing permission for these
various events. But it suits its pur
pose and acts as an automatic check
on an immense amount of "activities
and "affairs" that the campus and the
students could well get along without.
And there is no doubt that the per
mission to use the Stanford name is
a good thing to require in such a
case as is outlined in the second com
munication in this page. An outside
person desires to call his entertain
ment the "Stanford Dance," and to
profit by the use of the name. No
member of the university would be in
favor of permitting this, we are sure.
