# WASHINGTON JOURNALISM SCHOOL USES DIGEST
## FAMOUS NEW YORK WEEKLY IS A TEXTBOOK. College Writers Take Paper's Method of News Writing as a Model. 
### 
For one semester The Literary Di
gest has been the chief textbook of a
college course in journalism. At the
University of Washington Professor
Merle Thorpe used it during the last
five months as the basis of class
work for "Interpretation of the News,"
a course offered for the first time by
the department, and from week to
week the students have been required
to make up a dummy as tho they were
members of the publication's editorial
board. These are then compared with
the real Digest when it reaches
Seattle, and the differences studied.
The department of journalism sub
scribes to all the leading newspapers
of the country and to several of the
English dailies. The advanced stu
dents are required to read these regu
larly and critically. Each week every
one in the class brings in a table of
contents for the next week's Digest,
together with cartoons to be repro
duced, editorial paragraphs and arti
cles on contemporary drama, science,
religion, and the other departments.
In addition to this skeleton, the stu
dents are obliged to write, as for pub
lication, reviews on assigned topics.
One may be given the Mexican situa
tion, the Standard Oil decision, or the
Mormon invasion of England. With
this material a dummy for the maga
zine is built up.
Then once a month the students are
asked to combine the information they
have acquired during the past four
weeks, eliminate what they think is
inconsequential, and emphasize what
was of most striking import, con
structing of this material a dummy
for a magazine of the Review of Re
views or Current Literature type.
The aim of the course, as implied
by its name, is to give the student po
wer to interpret current events in
telligently, to show him what is of
lasting import and what of only pres
ent Interest. He is led to understand
the difference in news value between
a mine disaster or railroad wreck and
a reciprocity agreement with Canada.
His faculty of judgment is stimulated,
and he is given much practise in
writing news exposition. Incidentally
the student thus acquires a wide
knowledge of the differences in policy
and method between the various
papers of the country.
The course has been so successful
the past semester that it is be repeat
ed next year with some changes
Among other innovations it is prob
the class will actually publish, on the
department's press, one edition df
its Literary Digest for comparison
with the original and for circulation
among its friends as a souvenir.
This course is one of ten or a dozen
on various phases of journalism offer
ed by the department. The depart
ment is a unit in the Liberal Arts
college and the remainder of the stu
dents' work is done in the usual cul
tural fields, especial emphasis being
laid on political and social science,
psychology, history and English litera
ture. The department now has 100
students taking their major work in
its courses.
The Digest says it "aims to preserve
a becoming modesty, but it can not
pretend to be insensible" to the above
"genuine admiration."

For one semester The Literary Di
gest has been the chief textbook of a
college course in journalism. At the
University of Washington Professor
Merle Thorpe used it during the last
five months as the basis of class
work for "Interpretation of the News,"
a course offered for the first time by
the department, and from week to
week the students have been required
to make up a dummy as tho they were
members of the publication's editorial
board. These are then compared with
the real Digest when it reaches
Seattle, and the differences studied.
The department of journalism sub
scribes to all the leading newspapers
of the country and to several of the
English dailies. The advanced stu
dents are required to read these regu
larly and critically. Each week every
one in the class brings in a table of
contents for the next week's Digest,
together with cartoons to be repro
duced, editorial paragraphs and arti
cles on contemporary drama, science,
religion, and the other departments.
In addition to this skeleton, the stu
dents are obliged to write, as for pub
lication, reviews on assigned topics.
One may be given the Mexican situa
tion, the Standard Oil decision, or the
Mormon invasion of England. With
this material a dummy for the maga
zine is built up.
Then once a month the students are
asked to combine the information they
have acquired during the past four
weeks, eliminate what they think is
inconsequential, and emphasize what
was of most striking import, con
structing of this material a dummy
for a magazine of the Review of Re
views or Current Literature type.
The aim of the course, as implied
by its name, is to give the student po
wer to interpret current events in
telligently, to show him what is of
lasting import and what of only pres
ent Interest. He is led to understand
the difference in news value between
a mine disaster or railroad wreck and
a reciprocity agreement with Canada.
His faculty of judgment is stimulated,
and he is given much practise in
writing news exposition. Incidentally
the student thus acquires a wide
knowledge of the differences in policy
and method between the various
papers of the country.
