"The students of Stanford Univer
sity must show an interest in the

Stanford Union if
it is to become a
reality in the new
future," said G. E.
Crothers, '95, at
a meeting of the
Board of Trustees
of the Stanford
Union this after
noon in C. D.
Marx's office in
the Engineering

Building. He explained that the
Trustees had decided to take action on
the matter as soon as approximately
fifty per cent of the amount subscribed
had been collected.
Professor C. D. Marx, president of
the board, reported that to date $45,000
has been subscribed and $15,000 col
lected. The former sum is not as
large as the board would like to have
it.and steps are to be taken in the
near future to raise this total with
student subscriptions. The Freshman
Class in particular, will be urged to
subscribe, as its members will receive
the most benefit from the Union.
Several plans were suggested for
the realization of this scheme.
R. W. Barrett, '04, tendered his res
ignation as Permanent Secretary of
the Union in order that a secretary
might be appointed who lives on or
near the campus, this man to be a
graduate or undergraduate, as the
board might see lit. He said that he
hud r."en most of the alumni, and it
was his opinion that what was now
needed was a man who could be on the
campus, and keep in touch with the
students. Mr. Barrett has made an ex
cellent secretary for the Union, and it
was with regret that his resignation was
accepted. The truth of his remarks
was clear to the board, however. A
committee, composed of Professor E.
D. Adams, K. L. Schaupp, '12, and J.
E. Wooley, '12, was appointed to select
and recommend a permanent campus
secretary for the Union. The members
of the board will be notified by letter
of the selection and they will undoub
tedly voice their approval in the same
manner.
Mr. Barrett has held the position of
permanent secretary for the Board of
Trustees of the Stanford Union ever
since the scheme was launched. It
has been due entirely to his efforts
that the subscriptions from the alumni
have lieen raised, and the money col
lected. With headquarters in San
Francisco be has been able to get in
close touch with a large body of the
alumni. His work has been very
successful.
A suggestion was made that a date
be set at which time the subscriptions
by classes be published in the Daily
Palo Alto. In this way the spirit of
class rivalry will probably help the
subscription lists.
Professor Adams said he believed
it would be a good plan to have a cer
tain percent of the net receipts of all
Stafford entertainments set aside'
for the Union, not so much for the
amount of money that would be rea
lised in th's manner as for the publi
c'ty that the Union would receive.
For the purpose of stimulating in
terest the board had a drawing of a
proposed Stanford Union, sent out
from New York by .1. K. Branner, 'Oft,
placed in the window of the Engineer
ing Building, and will later have it
published in one of the Stanford pa-

student subscriptions. The Freshman
Class in particular, will be urged to
subscribe, as its members will receive
the most benefit from the Union.
Several plans were suggested for
the realization of this scheme.
R. W. Barrett, '04, tendered his res
ignation as Permanent Secretary of
the Union in order that a secretary
might be appointed who lives on or
near the campus, this man to be a
graduate or undergraduate, as the
board might see lit. He said that he
hud r."en most of the alumni, and it
was his opinion that what was now
needed was a man who could be on the
campus, and keep in touch with the
students. Mr. Barrett has made an ex
cellent secretary for the Union, and it
was with regret that his resignation was
accepted. The truth of his remarks
was clear to the board, however. A
committee, composed of Professor E.
D. Adams, K. L. Schaupp, '12, and J.
E. Wooley, '12, was appointed to select
and recommend a permanent campus
secretary for the Union. The members
of the board will be notified by letter
of the selection and they will undoub
tedly voice their approval in the same
manner.
Mr. Barrett has held the position of
permanent secretary for the Board of
Trustees of the Stanford Union ever
since the scheme was launched. It
has been due entirely to his efforts
that the subscriptions from the alumni
have lieen raised, and the money col
lected. With headquarters in San
Francisco be has been able to get in
close touch with a large body of the
alumni. His work has been very
successful.
A suggestion was made that a date
be set at which time the subscriptions
by classes be published in the Daily
Palo Alto. In this way the spirit of
class rivalry will probably help the
subscription lists.
Professor Adams said he believed
it would be a good plan to have a cer
tain percent of the net receipts of all
Stafford entertainments set aside'
for the Union, not so much for the
amount of money that would be rea
lised in th's manner as for the publi
c'ty that the Union would receive.
For the purpose of stimulating in

proposed Stanford Union, sent out
from New York by .1. K. Branner, 'Oft,

fifty per cent of the amount subscribed
had been collected.
Professor C. D. Marx, president of
the board, reported that to date $45,000
has been subscribed and $15,000 col
