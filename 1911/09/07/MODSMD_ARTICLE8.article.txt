# WILL SUBMIT PROBLEMS IN SPECIAL ASSEMBLIES
## STUDENT BODY OFFICERS WILL TEST OPINION. Public Exorcises Committee To Arrange for Special Meetings When Students Desire. 
### 
In the future, Stanford students will
he afforded the opportunity to dis
cuss questions of university policy
or of general interest to the univer
sity public in special open assemblies
to be called whenever occasion for
such discussion arises.
This announcement has been made
by K. L. Schaupp, '12, president of the
student body, following a conference
of student body officers with the com
mittee on Public Eexercises. This
plan was tentatively stated in yester
day assembly.
Such assemblies long have been agi
tated by members of the student body
and are distinctly welcome for tht
opportunity they afford of obtaining
unity on questions of vital interest to
the entire student public.
. The student officers were desirous
that a regular date be set each month
for such a meeting, that they might
refer questions of import to the stu
dents assembled.
Members of the Committee stated,
however, that there might not be suffi
cient business to ocupy the entire
hour set aside for assemblies so
frequently, but agree to arrange for
special metings whenever desired.
The submission of student affairs
directly to the students themselves
for discussion will be of material
assistance to the officials directing
activities in that they may know
thereby the exact attitude of the
majority and minority of the students
on important subjects.
Another feature that especially is
appreciated is the closer relation thai
will undoubtedly result among stu
dents and their representatives by
such assemblies.
President Schaupp also has drawn
attention to provisions of the consti
tution that permit any one of the four
classes of the university, or any group
of fifteen or more students, to apply
to the student president for a univer
sity assembly to discuss any propo
sition that concerns the students as
a whole.
