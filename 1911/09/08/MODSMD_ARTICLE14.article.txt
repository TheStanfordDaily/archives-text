# Orchestra Will Elect Officers.
## 
### 
The Orchestra met for the first time
last night, and discussed plans for
the coming year. No definite outline
of work has as vet been decided on,
however. Of the fifteen men who re
ported for rehearsal, most of them
were old men. The Freshmen did not
respond in the way it was desired.
On next Wednesday night, in room
68, there will he an election of officers
for the ensuing year.
