# Sequoia Will Boost Clubhouses.
## 
### 
In order to give the members of the
Student Body additional information
regarding the proposed Stanford
Union for men, and the Woman's Club
House for women students, the next
issue of the Sequoia will be composed
for the most part of articles regarding
the work which has already been done
and the general features of the club
houses. Much data has been collected
by Editor L. M. Robinson, '12. Several
very interesting articles have been
prepared. J. K. Branner, '09, of New
York, has forwarded a drawing of a
proposed Stanford Union and this will
be published in the coming number.
