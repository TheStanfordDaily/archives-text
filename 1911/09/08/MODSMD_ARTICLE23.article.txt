The appointment of the campus
Secretary of the Stanford Union
means that there will be no further

delay in starting the work
to collect money. The new
official is well suited foi
the position, and we look

for activity that will count for some
thing within the next month. Man>
students have subscribed, and many
more want to. But human nature is
the same the world over and very few
men will ever bring their money to
the Committee on their own initiative.
We believe that students will pay up
pledges when their personal attention
has bene called to them and not until
that time. Experience at other col
leges and schools has proved this
point. It requires a superior degree
of loyalty for anyone to approach the
Union officials and say, "Here is you *
money."
The Chairman and his committee
should divide the campus into terri
tories and each member be respon
sible for a certain number of men.
The comittee should be as large as
possible. The more men interested
the better, and the more chance of
securing money. One college com
munity which raised funds for a simi
lar purpose as the Union, appointed
a committee of a hundred members.
As a consequence, no one in the uni
versity escaped from the net set by
the collectors. We hope that a good,
workable plan may be decided upon
within a few days and the work begun.
A good deal of what has been said
above is applicable to the Women's
Club House as well. The women o.
the university have shown an unusua,
amount of spirit in their collections,
and have, indeed, done almost as
much in a year as the men have done
in more than two. May they keep up
the work.
