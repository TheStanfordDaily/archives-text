# The
						Games Tomorrow.
## 
### 
Tomorrow will be the best opportun
ity for a majority of the college to
see what has been accomplished dur
ing the opening week of football prac
tice, in the first games in the after
noon, on Stanford Field. As Coach

Presley said, do noi
hold all youi* enthusiasm
for rugby and the men
you have faith in until

two days before the Big Game. Show
some of it now. It will help the
players who are working hard on the
field, and it will do you good.
The relaxation from a week's
study that comes from attendance af
the games cannot be estimated. And
when you have enjoyed the contests
and want to go again, the best way
to do so is by buying a season ticket.
In that way you will assure yourself
of this privilege twice a week.
