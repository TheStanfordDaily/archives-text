The Hygiene Department no longer
exists as a separate department. It
has become a division of the College
of Medicine. The work which it for
merly did is now carried on by the
Health Committee.
That part pertaining to personal
hygiene has been taken over by the
Gymnasiums, under Professor R. R.
Long, of Encina Gymnasium, and Dr.
C. D. Mosher, of Roble Gymnasium.
They are at present arranging for a
physical examination of all students
in athletics, including those on Var
sity teams.
The University Committee on Public
Health, which existed before the
Hygiene Department, and which then
acted in conjunction with it, now has
full charge of all general matters of
health pertaining directly or indirect
ly to the campus. To see that the
vaccination regulations are observed
is one of its duties. This committee
has inspected the rooms of all the
lodging-houses In Palo Alto, and has
also re-inspected nearly all student
houses on the campus, including
fratenrities and clubs.
The Committee has done much to
keep the conditions on the campus
sanitary. Its members are: Professor
H. Zinsser, of the Medical Depart
ment, (chairman); Professors C. H.
Gilbert, and C. S. Stoltenberg, of thv
Zoology Department; S. B. Mitchell,
of the Library; Professor R. R. Long,
of the Hygiene Department, and Di
rector C. D. Mosher, of the Roble
Gymnasium. Miss H. Campbell, '11,
is secretary.
