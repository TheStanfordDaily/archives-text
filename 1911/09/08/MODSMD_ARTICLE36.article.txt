With the idea of putting soccer
football on an intercollegiate basis,
C. Y. Williamson, of San Francisco,
offered the handsome trophy cup to
be contested for by teams from Stan
ford and the University of California.
As announced not long ago, the
donor of the trophy is an enthusiast
over the English games of soccer and
rugby and has financed several ath
letic undertakings along these lines
for the Barbarian Club, of which he
is a member. Under the conditions of
the donation, the cup is to be contest
ed for in a series of three games this
season. The winner of the series
shall l:e awarded the cup. William
son is so eager that soccer shall be an
established game between the two uni
versities that he has proffered his
services to the California team in
view of the fact that they are without
a coach at present. He will accept'
nothing in return for his work with
the Blue and Gold soccer players. .
