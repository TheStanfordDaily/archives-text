# Fall Baseball Practice Delayed.
## 
### 
The Cardinal Varsity beseball team
will have a week's delay in the open
ing of fall practice, because the new
diamond is not yet available.
A meeting of the baseball men for
the purpose of signing up was called
for today, but conflicts of class meet
ings permitted only a few to appear.
Announcement of the first practice,
when the men will sign up, will be
made in the Daily Palo Alto in a few
days.
The first practice probably will be
on a diamond supplementary to the
regular baseball field.
Dr. Angell announces that work is
being rushed on the supplementary
diamond, and that it probably will be
completed in a week, when fall prac
tice may begin.
