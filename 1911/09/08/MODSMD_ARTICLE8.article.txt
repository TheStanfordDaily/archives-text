# NEW RULINGS WILL BE GIVEN FINAL WORKOUT
## TOUCH BOOTS WILL BE TABOOED TO-MORROW. Twenty Minutes Scrummages Are Featured on Turf Field Between Class Teams. 
### 
Ten teams are scheduled for a
twenty minute appearance, each, on
Stanford Field, tomorrow afternoon,
beginning at 2:30. This special prac
tice is to replace the game generally
set for the end of the first week
for both the Varsity and Freshmen
fifteens.
The first scrummage of the week
end matinee will probably be between
the Senior premier fifteen and the
first group picked from the second
year class. This opportunity will be
used by Coach Presley for a final try
out in the workings of the new rulings
which do away with the lineout and
touch kicking. As the Intercollegiate
Agreement Committee meets in the
St. Francis Hotel in San Francisco
tomorrow evening to come to a final
decision regarding the proposed
changes in the California rugby code,
this will be the last chance to see
these rules tried by a rugby team
before they are adopted or rejected.
Following this tryout, the old rules
will be in vogue for the rest of the
afternoon, when spiralings for a long
distance touch will be as frequent as
the previous awarded scrum for such
tactics.
The twenty minute matches follow
ing this game will be between the se
cond Seniors and second Sophomores;
then the first Juniors and Freshmen,
and fourthly, the second aggregations
from these classes. The afternoon
will close after the set-to between the
third and fourth groups from the baby
class.
The provisional line-up for the first
Freshmen will be as follows: Rives,
Rooks, Ross, front rank; Dutton and
Hails, middle rank; Soper, Haley, and
Wilson, rear rank; Anderson and E.
Clark, half; Risling and Steinhart,
fives; Sim, center; Wynne and Tem
pleton, wings; Hutchinson, full. Shifts
are fast among the new men, and
after tomorrow's game several changes
may be made before Monday's prac
tice. The majority of these men have
shown plenty of willingness and the
match tomorrow will be a revealatio
to those who have not followed thp
entire week's grind of the new men.
