matches were all between class units

If>ls Second and Third Meet.
The first game of the afternoon en
gaged the second and third Freshmen.
The play was slow, thru the men's
lack of scrum knowledge and frequent
penalizations for picking the ball from
the ruck came from A. E. Roth, who
held the whistle. A. L. Erb was a
close follower-up of the pigskin antf
should have engineered several rushes
if he had been accorded better support.
(11 the last few minutes of play the
second group was kept 011 the defense,
and the awarding of a free kick for
offside scored three points for the
third team when Doheny dropped
goal. Score, 3-0.
I»14 Defeat First Freshmen.
Sophomores and Freshmen lined up
against each other in the next game
for the first underclassman rugby
match of the season. The kick off
carried the game into 1914's territory.
The Freshmen were gradually driven
back, and from midfield Tilton reachec
touch on If>ls's 25 after two kicks.
Here Reeves' fearlessness brought
him into trouble, and an injured tendon
sent him into the training house. The
injury, while not serious, will keep
him out of the game for a few days.
Rucking gave the ball to the mid
field again. McCrary, who replaced
Reeves, secured from the loose and
netted a forty yard gain. Fighting on
heir 15 the Freshmen held firm lot
several minutes, when Geissler secur
ed and went across for a try. He cap
ped this with a conversion. The se
cond half proved to be an even strug
gle, with both sides fighting hard. No
scores were registered. Garu provid
ed the spectacle in the last few min
utes when he ran thru the loose for
a 50 yard gain. I int the Sophomores
were unable to follow up their ad
vantage.
