# No New Songs Needed.

### 
The Daily Palo Alto understands
that no attempt will be made this yeai
to secure new songs and yells to adu
to the already long list. The rare old

tunes that have been
crowded out by inferi
or songs will be re
vived, and a change

or two made in the yells. That is a
move in the right direction. Stanford
has plenty of good melodies that have
been allowed to lie idle in recent
years. Money has been wasted, practi
cally, in giving money prizes for songs
that we don't need, many of whicli an
ordinary sane man would not sing.
It has always been the complaint ot
the alumni in out-of-the-way places,
when the undergraduate teams and or
ganizations visited their cities, thai
they could not join with them in songs,
or even yells, because of the flood
new compositions that the yell-leadeiv
accept each year. What we want is i
few songs that will hold their plat/,
year in and year out. There are sev
eral compositions by graduates of the
university which we might well pre
serve, and which have not been used
for the past four or five years.
