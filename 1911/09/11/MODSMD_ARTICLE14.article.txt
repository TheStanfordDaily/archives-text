L. L. Burlingame, Dr. Campbell and
Professor B. E. Howard. Miss Gract
Davis rendered a solo.
Dr. Brainier, in the course of his
address, said:
"One supreme test of the teacher
that is often lost sight of in an ad
dress of this nature, is his results.
Judged by this standard Professor
Dudley was one of the greatest teach
ers of Botany that this country has
ever known. He was a warm-hearted,
genuine lover of nature in all its
forms. At heart he was a poet and
always had about him the works ot
the best poets. To be, rather than to
appear, was the steadfast purpose
of his life. He did nothing for the
sake of display and never courteu
popularity. He was a man of the fi
nest possible fibre.
"It behooves us not to lose sight of
the blessed truth that there are fine
men and women in this world who
keep out of the limelight. One of
these men was William Russell Dud
ley.
Dr. Branner's remarks were follow
ed by an address by Dr. Campbell. "T
first met Professor Dudley at Stras
bury, in Germany," he began, "and
shortly after when he visited Berlin
had the pleasure of renewing our
friendship. Later it was a great sat
isfaction to know that the Department
of Botany at Stanford was to have
such a man at its head.
"Professor Dudley entered upon his
duties at the time of the Panic of
1898, when Stanford was laboring un
der great financial difficulties. He
was confronted at the start by the
problem of finding a place to carry
on his work.
"Professor Dudley took an interest'
in the forest problems of America.
This brought him into intimate rela
tions with the men who have done so
much for American forestry. He was
a personal friend of Gifford Pincliot
and was entirely in sympathy with
him. It was largely through the eff
orts of Professor Dudley that Red
wood Park in the Santa Cruz Moun
tains was made into a reservation, t<
be forever the property of the citizens
of California."
