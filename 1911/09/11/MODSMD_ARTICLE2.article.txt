# POWER IN CASES OF DISCIPLINE MAY BE TAKEN BY WOMEN'S BOARD
## New Committee of Five Representative Women May Assume Student Control at Any Time.â€”Will Take No Action Until President's Return. 
### 
With the formation of the Judicial
Board of the Executive body of the
Women's League the women of the
University have taken the final step
in the practical assumption of women
student control. It was to this that
Miss N. Moise. 12, referred in her ad
dress at the Assembly of Wednesday
last when she said, "The women of the
University are now ready for the
assumption of student control."
Although at the present time, the
functions of the Judicial Board are
rather nominal it is generally ad
mitted that at any time they choose
they can take control of the reins of
student government for women. It is
probable, however, that they will wail
until the return of President Jordan
from the Orient, as it was from hin".
that the suggestion originally came
and it is from him that they wish to
receive the final powers of control.
Until last semester the women of
the university had no definite body of
representatives corresponding to the
University Conference of the men.
Their only body 11 p to that time con
sisted of the presidents of the various
women's activities, who, although

practically representative, were not
actually so in the sense of being elect
ed by popular vote. Last semester Dr.
Jordan suggested to the women that
they organize a body similar to the
University Conference. With this o
ject in mind an election was held an
representatives to the number of fi;
teen were elected from the various
departments on the ratio of one repre
sentative to every thirty-five women.
At the first meeting of the body
this semester, names were balloted on
! for five members of the Judicial
(Board. The following were elected:
Miss N. Moise, '12, chairman; Miss
L. Bell, '11, Miss D. Marx, '11, Miss R.
Sampson,'l2, and Miss G. Workman,'l2.
These five representatives are
women who have been extremely ac
tive in women's affairs since their
matriculation at the university. All
of them have taken a vital part in
forwarding the work of the various
organizations in which they have bee
interested.
This Board corresponds in all de
tails to the Advisory Board of the
University Conference, it is admitted
by those in touch with affairs that this
Board can at any time it sees fit take
over the problems of student govern
ment and discipline among the women.
In case such action was taken it would
not be final but merely in the nature
of a recommendation to the Student
Affairs Committee that certain thing?,
be done. At the same time, even
though the Student Affairs Com
mittee might be considered a court of
appeal from the decisions of the Ju
dicial Board, it is doubtful if they
would ever overrule any recommenda
tion sent to them by the Board.

This is practically the state of aff
airs at California, where the work of
student control has been completely
worked out. There the committee 01
seniors recommend all action in cases
of discipline to the Student Affairs
Committee and that Committee passes
them without cptestion. In all the
cases which have been passed upon by
the student committee at California
none of them have been repealed by
the faculty committee.
In the case of the women, however,
the elements of a committee to act
on cases of discipline enter into the
consideration but slightly. In the en
tire history of the university there
have probably not been more than
three of four cases where it has been
necessary to take drastic action in the
disciplining of women in cases other
than of cheating.
The new organization of five will
not interfere with the functions of the
old body composed of the presidents
of the women's activities. That body
will still continue and will meet witi*
the Executive Board of the Women's
League in all except executive and
judicial sessions.

Their only body 11 p to that time con
sisted of the presidents of the various
women's activities, who, although

practically representative, were not
actually so in the sense of being elect
ed by popular vote. Last semester Dr.
Jordan suggested to the women that
they organize a body similar to the
University Conference. With this o
ject in mind an election was held an
representatives to the number of fi;
teen were elected from the various
departments on the ratio of one repre
sentative to every thirty-five women.
At the first meeting of the body
this semester, names were balloted on
! for five members of the Judicial
(Board. The following were elected:
Miss N. Moise, '12, chairman; Miss
L. Bell, '11, Miss D. Marx, '11, Miss R.
Sampson,'l2, and Miss G. Workman,'l2.
These five representatives are
women who have been extremely ac
tive in women's affairs since their
matriculation at the university. All
of them have taken a vital part in
forwarding the work of the various
organizations in which they have bee
interested.
This Board corresponds in all de
tails to the Advisory Board of the
University Conference, it is admitted
by those in touch with affairs that this
Board can at any time it sees fit take
over the problems of student govern
ment and discipline among the women.
In case such action was taken it would
not be final but merely in the nature
of a recommendation to the Student
Affairs Committee that certain thing?,
be done. At the same time, even
though the Student Affairs Com
mittee might be considered a court of
appeal from the decisions of the Ju
dicial Board, it is doubtful if they
would ever overrule any recommenda
tion sent to them by the Board.

This is practically the state of aff
airs at California, where the work of
student control has been completely
worked out. There the committee 01
seniors recommend all action in cases
of discipline to the Student Affairs
Committee and that Committee passes
them without cptestion. In all the
cases which have been passed upon by
the student committee at California
none of them have been repealed by
the faculty committee.
In the case of the women, however,
the elements of a committee to act
on cases of discipline enter into the
consideration but slightly. In the en
tire history of the university there
have probably not been more than
three of four cases where it has been
necessary to take drastic action in the
disciplining of women in cases other
than of cheating.
The new organization of five will
not interfere with the functions of the
old body composed of the presidents
of the women's activities. That body
will still continue and will meet witi*
the Executive Board of the Women's
League in all except executive and
judicial sessions.

With the formation of the Judicial
Board of the Executive body of the
Women's League the women of the

student control. It was to this that

last when she said, "The women of the
University are now ready for the
assumption of student control."
Although at the present time, the
functions of the Judicial Board are
rather nominal it is generally ad

they can take control of the reins of
student government for women. It is
probable, however, that they will wail
