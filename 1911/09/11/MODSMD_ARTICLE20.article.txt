# CARDINAL FENCING CLUB HAS BEEN REORGANIZED.
## Club Has Been Dormant for Five Years.â€”Attempt Made For Permanent Form. 
### 
Mask and Foil, the Cardinal fencing
club, has been re-organized, and is t<*
be permanent from now on.
Fencing clubs exist in all the east
ern colleges, and most of the western
colleges. California boasts a ver.\
good organization. The Stanford clui
will try its skill against them in tlu
coming year.
The club held its place at Stanford
for several years before it was sus
pended about five years ago. At that
time the Caroline brothers, who were
its last presidents,, graduated from
Stanford. After their departure the
club soon disbanded. Nothing was
done toward its revival until last year,
when Director Maloney, of the Stan
ford Gymnasium, brought forward
the idea. A constitution was then
drawn up and approved.
This constitution provides for fenc
ing matches to be held twice a month.
They will be in the nature of round
robin bouts, and both men and women
may compete. There will be many
intercollegiate matches, the one with
California probably being of greatest
interest to Stanford students.
Mask and Foil is under Mr. Ma
loney's special supervision. A meet
ing will be held next Wednesday for
election of officers and other business.
All interested are asked by the men in
charge to attend this first meeting of
the semester.
