# SWORD AND SANDALS TO PRESENT STRONG PLAY
## "THE WORLD AND HIS WIFE" IS GREAT MODERN DRAMA. It is a Problem Play Without a Problem and is Unusually True to Life. 
### 
When Sword and Sandals presents
Nirdlinger's "The World and His
Wife," in the Assembly hall on Sep
tember 29, the Stanford audience which
gathers to witness the performance
will see what will without doubt go
down in the annals of local dramatics
as the strongest play that has ever
been presented here. Not only are
the actors themselves intensely in
terested in the work but impartial
people who have witnessed even the
preliminary rehearsals are enthusi
astic over the piece.
Contrary to the average run of plays
by the greater dramatists, "The World
and His Wife" is intensely interesting
and gripping from the first speech
until the end. Xirdlinger, who has
written the English adaptation of
Echegara.v's greatest play, "The Great
Galeoto" has, if anything, improved
on the work of the famous Spanish
playwright.
"The World and His Wife" is a
"problem" play without a problem.
In the hands of a less skillful drama
tist it would never have risen above
mere mediocrity, but Xirdlinger has
produced a work which stands head
and shoulders above the average run
of modern popular drama.
The play deals with the terrible
consequences which may result fron.
idle gossip. It is laid in Spain, and
the characters are prominent in dip
lomatic crcles in Madrid. Causeless
scandal arises among the high society
of the city. As a result of this talk
duels are fought to vindicate the false

position in which the leading charac
ters find themselves. The play works
upward with terrific cumulative force
to an ending, unexpected, convincing,
and satisfying. And when it is all
over the problem play without a prob
lem has taught a lesson without din
ning it into the ears of the spectators,
and without intense mental effort on
their part to grasp every hidden mean
ing in the author's lines. The play
stands out life-like in every detail.
It is real, and the characters who
walk up and down on the stage in
their mimic world and repeat the
written words of another are real,
and their sufferings and joys are real.
Many call that the true test of a great
play. "The World and His Wife"
satisfies all of these conditions.
