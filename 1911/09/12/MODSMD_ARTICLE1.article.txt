# VARSITY DEBATE WILL PRECEDE BIG GAME
## DATE IS CHANGED FROM SECOND TO FIRST SEMESTER. Stanford and California Committees Finally Agree on Shifting Intercollegiate Contest. 
### 
The Stanford-California Varsity de
bate will be held this year on Novem
ber 10, the night before the Big Ganif.
The selection of this date comes as
the result of the meeting, Saturday
afternoon, between the representatives
of the two universities at Berkeley.
The contest has never before been
held in the first semester.
California was unwilling, for un
known reasons, to change the time of
the debate. In years previous the
debating calendar for the spring sem
ester has been overcrowded with
events for the college orators. For
sometime the local societies have agi
tated the shifting of the date of the
Intercollegiate contest from the cus
tomary April evening to some time in
November. After much discussion
tlie California members of the Agree
ment Committee decided to postpone
further action in the matter until a
meeting of their debating council
might be held. This body met yester
day morning. President N. B. Drury,
'12, of the organization, then tele
phoned the local committee that the
proposed change had been ratified.
Berkeley was represented Saturday
by N. B. Drury, '12, F. M. Shipper, '12,
both of whom are Car not medalists,
and T. B. Kittredge, '12, who was a
member of the intercollegiate team
last semester. The men who repre
sented the Cardinal were: P. .). Bat
kin, '10, former intercollegiate debat
er, F. H. Hilton, '11, and E. E. Tincher,
members of the 1911 trio.
Only one debater who has competed
against the Blue and Gold orators
has registered in the University. This
is E. E. Tincher, '12, president of Nes
toria society and a member of both
the Carnot and the Oregon Tri-State
teams last spring. Many of the men
who are interested in forensic con
tests and who have taken part in
various inter-class and inter-society
contests have returned to college and
will be eligible this year. Among
these are A. (J. Bradford, '13, CI. N.
Wood. '13. K. L. Leili, '13, C. C. Close,
'14, \V. B. Owens, '14, and O. H. Cas
tie, '14.
The Freshman class is expected to
furnish its quota of speakers. Because
of the several contests which are reg
ular events and the new debates which
have been considered for the coming
year, the first year men are assured
of an excellent opportunity of mak
ing one of the University teams.
