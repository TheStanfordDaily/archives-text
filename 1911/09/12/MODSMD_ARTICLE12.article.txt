# ORGAN OF MEMORIAL CHURCH TO BE PLACED IN ASSEMBLY HALL
## 
### 
The immense pipe organ, which was
originally in the Memorial Church,
is now being installed in the Assembly
Hall, It was built into the "Stanford
Minster" in 1902, but has been silent
,stnce 1906, the earthquake year.
About sixty seats at the rear of the
balcony have been removed to make
room for the huge instrument. On
account of the low celling, the organ

will lie somewhat changed in appear
ance. In addition, some minor
changes will be made which are ex
pected to improve the tone.
Ever since the earthquake the or
gan. which was uninjured in the fall
of the church, has been in the store
room, n:.d all parts are in excellent
condition.
The work of reconstructing is being

done by the builders, the Murray M.
Harris Co., of Los Angeles, under the
personal direction of Walter Gibson,
who superintended the original in
'tailing iii the Church nine years ago.
As near as can lie ascertained, it
should 1e ready for use in about six
wepks. It is probable that Sunday
service* will be held in the Assembly
Hall when the work in completed.
