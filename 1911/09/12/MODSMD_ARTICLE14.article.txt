# Squad Works On Tackling Bag.
## 
### 
Strict training for all rugby candi
dates went into effect yesterday after
noon, according to the decree of Coach
Presley. This tabooes the use of to
bacco in all forms and advises due
regard to diet and the keeping of late
hours. For the time being week-end
dances will not be forbidden, however.
The tackling bag was used for the
first time this afternoon. Moth old and
new forwards were given a chance to
show their ability in bringing down
the canvas dummy. The scrum men
also practiced dribbling and scrum
ming. The backs were sent down the
field for passing and cross kicking
work. Practice in dribbling was in
cluded in the repertoire of the backs'
program.
