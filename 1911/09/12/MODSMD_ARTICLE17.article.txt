# The 						Spread of Rugby.
## 
### 
The Marines have taken up rugby.
Inch by inch American football is
giving way and the "saner" game tak
ing its place. California shows almost

a sold front for rugby.
It has invaded both ends
of the State, and in the
south one of the most

important of the colleges has aban
doned the "old game." Even snch
strongholds of American football as
Belmont, the preparatory school, where
the famous Harvard coach "Bill"
Reid was in power, has had to give up
the fight because a schedule could not
be made owing to lack of schools
playing the eleven-man sport.
The middle west has been giving
way. Wisconsin will use rugby in
class contests. Kansas adopted the
game about a year ago, and hired a
Stanford coach, but was forced to give
up the reform because no other uni
versities of her caliber were playing
rugby. Many colleges and schools are
investigating the sport as played on
the Pacific coast.
Hut not only in the middle west is
rugby being watched, but in the east
as well. Last fall Coach Walter Camp,
of Yale, made short stays at the uni
versities and centers on the Coast.
He protested that he was here on "bus
iness." But it was noticed that he
visited Stanford, California, and the
British Columbia cities, hotbeds of
rugby.
Rugby has been so successful be
tween Stanford and California, why
cannot the two universities join to
spread the playing of the game through
the United States. American football
has been changed in such a great
many ways that it could hardly be
recognized by its best friends. News
papers, college presidents, and sport
followers alike, are dissatisfied with
it. The old American game is on
trial. Now. at what might be called
the right moment, why not send the
Stanford and California Varsities
to several of the larger eastern cities
to play exhibition games during the
Christmas vacation, inviting college
players and coaches to the contests.
The standard of rugby which they
develope would surprise many of our
friends in the effete east.
