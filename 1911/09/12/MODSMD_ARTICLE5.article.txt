# MARINES TO SUBSTITUTE RUGBY FOR OLD GAME.
## Mare Island Officials Drop American Football as Athletic Exercise For Sailors. 
### 
Rugby football has been adopted
by the marine corps of the navy yard
at Mare Island as a substitute for
American football. For the naval
athletes, rugby will be especially
valuable, as it is played all over the
world, and will allow the sailors to
engage in matches with foreign aggre
gations during the visit of an Ameri
can war vessel in foreign waters.
This is the first time that any
Government employees have been
given a, chance to play the rugby
game of football as it. is interpreted
by the universities and athletic clubs
situated on the western slope of the
Rocky Mountains. The adoption of
the game by the Mare Island marines
is one of the biggest steps towards a
general recognizance of the sport in
America in the last few years.
The officers in charge of athletics
at the San Francisco naval base is
now on the lookout for a competent
teacher of the game, and when a coach
is found practice will be started. As
soon as the men round into shape,
games will be booked with the clubmen
of the metropolis across the bay. The
candidiates for the marine fifteens
are a husky group of athletes and a
strong team should soon be forth
coming from among their number. As
the date books of Stanford and Cali
fornia are now filled for the entire
season there will be no opportunity
during the present year to see them
in action on the local field. Future
schedules will undoubtedly see them
down for a campus appearance.
As these new recruits to rugby scat
ter over the country and carry the
memories of the game with them and
its advantages as an athletic means
of Intercourse with the sailors of other
nations, a great step in advance will
1 e made. Their playing of the game
will also be a good aid in the invasion
of the East, where the old game has
ruled and re-ruled until it is on its
"last legs."
