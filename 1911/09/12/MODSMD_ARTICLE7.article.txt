# PERMANENT SECRETARY APPOINTED FOR UNION
## PERMANENT SECRETARY APPOINTED FOR UNION. Active Campaign to Arouse Student Interest Will be Carried on by New Officer. 
### 
E. W. Smith, '09, Instructor in the
English Department, has been elected
permanent secretary of the Stanford
Union to fill the place left vacant by
the resignation of R. W. Barrett, '04,
from that position. The election to
that office lies in the hands of the
Board of Trustees of the Union. Five
of tiie members of the Board have
been heard from and have cast their
ballots in favor of Smith. Two mem
bers have not polled their votes as
yet but in all probability the election
will be unanimous.
During Barrett's tenure of office as
secretary the chief duty connected
with that position was to stir up the
alumni of the university to take an
active interest in the Fnion. At pres
ent much that can be done in the way
of financial assistance from the alumni
has been accomplished. A good part
of the remainder of the money must
come from the students themselves.
With this object in mind it was de
cided to appoint the permanent sec
retary from the alumni living on the
campus. It was hoped in this way to
make it possible for the secretary to
keeii in active touch with the student
part of the collections and subscrip
tions.
The duty of the secretary from now
on will be to keep up the interest of
the students. Smith will be in active
touch with the Campus Chairman for
the Stanford Union —A. W. Ambrose,
"13.
While an undergraduate at the
university in the early days, Smith
was unusually active in student acti
vities. He was a track man of note
and for many years the Stanford- Cal
ifornia record in the mile was held
by him. Besides his work in athletic
lines he was one of the early editors
of the Daily Palo Alto. During the
last semester in which he was in col
lege he was captain of the track
team, editor of the Daily Palo Alto,
and also its manager.
Following his graduation he en
tered the journalistic field in San
Francisco and shortly afterwards
was engaged in New York with the
"Sun." While there he rose rapidly
and at the time of leaving held an
important position on the staff. Since
coming to Stanford in tlie fall of 1910
he has taught in the English depart
ment and has introduced here the
courses in journalism.
