## Mohonk Conference Offers Prize for Best Article on "International" Arbitration," by Men. 
### 
For the best essay on "International
Arbitration," submitted by any under
graduate male student of any college
or university in the United States or
Canada, the Lake Mohonk Conference
on International Arbitration offers a
prize of $100. The contest closes
March 1.1, 1912, and the awards will
be made at the Lake Mohonk Confer
ence in May, 1912. The winner of the
prize will be invited to the 1912 con
ference.
Judges for the competition are
Oscar Straus, member of the Hague
Court and former United States am
bassador to Turkey, Elmer Ellsworth
Brown, chancellor of New York Uni
versity, and Rear Admiral Chas. H.
Stockton, U. S. N., retired.
Essays submitted should be of not
more than five thousand words. Those
in charge of the conference suggest
that the students confine themselves
to three thousand. The essays should
be sent to H. C. Phillips, secretary of
the Lake Mohonk Conference at Mo
honk Lake, N. Y., not later than
March 15, 1912.
A similar prize in 1910-11 brought
out sixty-one essays from all parts of
the United States and Canada. The
prize was won last year by Harry
Posner, of West Point, Mississippi,
a student in the Mississippi Agricult
ural and Mechanical College. The
donor is C. D. Pugsley, of Peekskill,
N. Y.
It is thought that Stanford students
will be especially prepared to enter
this competition because of the ex
cellent course in Arbitration given
each year by the History Department,
with lectures by Dr. Jordan, the first
class in that subject ever offered in
American colleges.
Those desiring more information
and particulars concerning the . con
test will find circulars on the bulletin
boards of the Library and History
Department.
