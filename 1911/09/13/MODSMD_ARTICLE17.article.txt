# UNDERCLASSMEN PLAY ON THE TURF TOMORROW
## FRESHMEN WILL PROVE WORTHY ANTAGONISTS. Winners Listed to Meet the Seniors On Tuesday to Deride the Championship. 
### 
To decide which of the underclasses
shall have the right to play the vic
torious Senior fifteen next Tuesday
for the fnterclass Championship for
1911, the Sophomores will meet the
Freshman aggregation on Stanford
Field tomorrow afternoon at 4:45.
Both of these classes have a plucky
group of fighters on their fifteens. A
battle that should compare favorably
with yesterday's fast game may be an
ticipated. In the scrum the two team";
will break about even, with a shade the
advantage falling to the baby team.
The Freshmen have a somewhat heav
ier team according to the judgment of
the eye, and with the ten days' prac
tice in working together they should
prove a hard nut to crack.
In the backfield the Sophomores
have a heavier set of ball-passers, but
the Freshmen, have, perhaps, on the
whole, more rugby scientists which
may swing the advantage their way in
a tight place.
The confidence of tried mettle is
behind the second year men, while the
new men have their rugby reputations
to make. Individually many of the
incoming players have enviable pre
paratory records and give promise of a
similar reputation in college.
But two Varsity veterans will be
seen on the Sophomore side. Geissler
is undoubtedly slated for his wing
position. P. F. Harrigan is also ex
pected to be out in togs to play at a
five position. These two men will
make for strength at all times,
whether on defense or offense. Reeves
will be unable to leave the side lines.
The fearlessness of the speedy veter
an will be a great loss to the red
hatted players.
The line-ups will not be given out
until tomorrow afternoon, following
custom.
