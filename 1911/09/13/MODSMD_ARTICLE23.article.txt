# Corduroys and Democracy.
## 
### 
The western college creed is democ
racy and simplicity. Out here we have
no excess of "blue blood" and repre
sentatives of the "best families." Our
democracy is represented by corduroys

and the sombrero,
articles of apparel
which would never be
tolerated in the uni-

versity centers of the eastern United
States. May Stanford retain these
customs of clothes, which, small as
they may seem, are one of the dis
tinguishing marks of this university.
American colleges seem to follow a
pattern—same architecture in build
ings, many identical traditions, un
dergraduates all apparently madft
from the same mold. Stanford, how
ever, tucked away here in a corner of
the Santa Clara valley, with plenty of
room to move in, and no possibility
of being crowded out by cities or
railroads, has an atmosphere of its
own. Travelers coming here for the
first time, notice this, and see that
difference before all other details).
If we need traditions, this one of
being distinctive is better than any we
know of, and is a good one to keep,
when all others fail.
Many people are against the custom
of the corduroys, the soft shirt, and
the sombrero. They are only waiting
for the time when these things will go.
We earnestly hope that they will be
disappointed. They do not understand
the ideals of our university.
We are a family here and we need
not be disturbed by outside influences.
Collars go with aristocracy and not
neatness, only. If it is desired to have
the Stanford man identical with the
Harvard man, the Oxford or Michigan
man. then do away with all such
"trivial" things, that separate him
from them. We hope never to see that
day come.
