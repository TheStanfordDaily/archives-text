## PROFESSOR SNYDER DOES WORK FOR COMMISSION. Stanford Receives Duplicates of all Specimens.â€” Medical Courses Have Been Strengthened. 
### 
Much has been done to enrich Stan
ford's collection of fish data. This
lias been accomplished thru the work
of Professor O. Snyder, of the
Department of Zoology, in connection
with the Government Fish Commission.
The Commission is desirous of
obtaining knowledge as to the specie.?,
life, habits, and peculiarities of the
various fishes to lie found in the ba
sins of the Truckee, Humboldt, Car
son, and Walker rivers, and of Honey
Lake, in the states of Nevada and
California.
It is thought that these streams
at one time flowed into, and that th?
lake formed a part of, an immense
body of water which covered Western
Nevada and Eastern California, just
north of the Lake Tahoe region.
The Commissioners are to discover
all possible statistics for fish dwell
ing in the rivers of the United States.
In this particular case they wish to
know what characteristics the fish, in
the bodies of water mentioned, ac
quired after the disappearance of the
former lake, how they happened to be
there, their peculiarities because of
environment, and just how much they
differ from each other.
During the summer months. Pro
fessor Snyder has been taking investi
gating trips of this kind for the Co.n
mission for several seasons. His in
vestigations this summer were merely
a continuation of his work from past
seasons. He was accompanied by
C. H. Richardson, '12. Their investi
gations kept them away for ten weeks,
in which time they made a large col
lection of fish and reptiles. Mr.
Richardson took charge of the rep
tiles, from data on which he is now
compiling a book, which will soon be
published.
Professor Snyder assumed the care
of the fish specimens, and now has
several cases of them at Stanford.
Although these specimens are intended
for the United States Fisli Commis
sion, Stanford will receive copies of
each specimen, and full data concern
ing it. All necessary funds for the
trip were furnished by the United
States Bureau of Fish Commissioners.
