# Spanish Club Begins Activity.
## 
### 
Thursday afternoon, the first meet
ins of the Spanish Club for the cur
rent semester was held. President
(5. L. Laurence, '13, presided. He ex
plained that it was desired to include
in the club membership all who had
some acquaintance with Spanish ano*
were interested in the language and
literature. Last year, he said, it was
the current impression that member
ship in the club was restricted to
upperclassmen. This was erroneous.
Underclassmen are welcome, and are
cordially invited, both to enroll as
club members and to attend the social
meetings.
No business was transacted, save
to decide on the character of the next
meeting, which is to be purely social.
Several new members were enrolled.
