# JUNIORS DOWNED BY SHEER VETERAN WEIGHT
## 1912 STEPS INTO LINE FOR CHAMPION'S TITLE. First of Interclass Series is Replete With Good Rugby and Fighting Spirit. 
### 
Yesterday's first of the class series
on Stanford Field proved to he one of
the hottest, contested games ever wit
nessed between two Cardinal aggre
gations. Thruont the halves the Se
nior fifteen with their predominance
of Varsity giants had the better of
the argument.
The game settled down to a contest
in the Junior territory immediately
after the kick-off. Playing against
Dole and Partridge, such tremendous
prodigies of attack in a line out or
scrum, the speedy 1913 forwards were
often hard pressed, but they were un
yielding until twenty-four minutes had
gone by. Then one of the passing
rushes that the Seniors had kept hurl
ing, as opportunity or chance offered,
at the Juniors, broke thru, Partridge,
Schaupp, and A. Sanborn turning the
trick for a try from the ten yard line.
The first half featured hard fought
scrums and well contested lineuots.
Every man fought like a veteran and
was up and after the ball minute by
minute of the game. The second half
saw a reversal of tactics and kicking
became the order of the day. In this
department Captain Brb shone es
pecially and repeatedly found touch
with difficult boots.
Belcher showed up well among the
hard fighters, and soon after the
kickoff opening the second period, he
took the ball away from the loose
around 1913's 20 and, alone, broke thru
the Seniors defense, and dribbled to
their 40 before he was checkmated.
The 1912 backfield then began to seek
touch with their kicks and time on
time Worswick was allowed to down
the ball behind his line when their
boots went wide of their mark.
H. J. Smith starred for the Seniors
when he secured at midfield for a
thirty-five yard run but was nailed
by Worswick before he got dan
gerously near chalking up a score.
Erb, thrice, in the last period sought
to drive the pigskin between the goal
posts. First, from a free kick at 1913's
40 he narrowly failed from placement
and similiarly from play at 25. The
last minute saw him realize three
points when he goaled the leather
oval from a free kick at placement on
1913's 2f>.
Owing to a slight injury received on
Saturday, Frank was not included in
tiie Junior lineup. His aggressive
work was missed.
