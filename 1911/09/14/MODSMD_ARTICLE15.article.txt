# The
						Man Who Tries.

### 
Why laugh at the other fellow when
he is doing his best to learn? Men
in the bleachers at practice sanies
have so far forgotten the principle of

helping the man who is
trying his utmost, that
comments, able to be
heard on the field, have

been made concerning the rugby play
ers on several days. Especially has
this sort of thing been directed at
Freshmen, who least of all, are ex
pected to understand all the points of
the football game.
Stanford never before boasted of so
many candidates in football. We have
told of our good fortune, spirit and
sportmanship with loud voices. And
now, slighting remarks and jeers are
thrown at the men who have helped
to swell the rugby list, and who are
doing the very best they can. That
is not right. Everyone will admit that
there is no argument there. Tf we
can't play football and can only look
on, let us at least respect and honor
the men who take the hard knocks,
who grind away trying to learn the
game through long hours, and who
know that there are two hundred men
all endeavoring to make thirty posi
tions on the Varsity and Freshman
teams.
