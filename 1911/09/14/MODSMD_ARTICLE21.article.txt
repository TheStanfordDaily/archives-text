Springs Concert.â€”Miss Rebecca Thay
er Hillis, the talented young soprano
coloratura, will contribute several
solos to the program for the after
noon concert at Congress Springs
next Sunday, September 17. Miss
Hillis, who is now in San Francisco
taking advanced vocal studies under
Michelena, and who is as yet at the
very entrance of her career, already
possesses unusual excellence in tech
nique in addition to a voice of remark
able range and power. There is no
doubt that a very large audience will
greet Miss Hillis. This is her native
valley, and she has hosts of friends
here; but besides that, there are very
many who will be glad to avail them
selves of the opportunity to verify
the current reports of her unusual
talent and ability. As usual, the or
chestral numbers will be furnished by
the d'Ablaing Orchestra.
These concerts are without charge to
the public. Cars leave Palo Alto for
Congress Springs on Sundays on the
hour, commencing at 9 a.m. Round
trip tickets, 35c, sold at S. P. ticket
office. No tickets sold on cars.
