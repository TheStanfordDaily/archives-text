# "RAM'S HEAD" FORMED TO ENCOURAGE LOCAL TALENT
## New Society Organized to Foster Production of Original Work in All Light Dramatic Lines. 
### 
To-day comes the announcement
! that a new society has joined the ranks
of Stanford's organizations. The ne'.v
body is to be known as the "Ram's
Head." its purpose is to encourage
original work in the production or in
terpretation of sketches, songs, musi
cal comedies, and the like.
The society is the outgrowth of ideas
of certain members of the student body
; and faculty. In many of the larger
j eastern universities societies with a
similar purpose have been eminently
successful. Certain men who are in
terested in this line of work decided
that there was a place for such an
I organization at Stanford.
Ten Men Organize.
With this object in mind three mem
bers of the faculty and seven students
organized the society. Although the
| details have been completed for some
i days they are made public this even
| ing for the first time. The members
are: Professor F. ('. Woodward, head
of the Law Department, Professors
! E. B. Krehbiel and P. J. Treat, of the
j Department of History, S. C. Kennedy,
j '12, J. B. Beman, '12, P. P. Ward, '12.
J. H. Forbes, '13, W. S. Wilson, '13.
P. Eliel '13, and .T. L. McDonald, '14.

These se\ sn students have all taken
an active interest in the production of
original work since their matricula
tion in the unversity. Kennedy has
done good work in local vaudeville, as
have Ward and Beman. Ward is an
excellent black face comedian, while
Beman has for the past two years ta
ken the comedy parts in all the local
dramatic productions. Forbes and Mc-
Donald. with Miss M. Herdman, ex-'l2,
were the co-authors of the 1912 Ju
nior opera, "The Uvernian Princess."
Wilson and Eliel have also written an
opera, and Wilson has published sev
eral original songs.
The three faculty members have
taken a more than active interest in
the organization. Professor Wood
ward has worked in framing the con
stitution, while Professors Treat and
Krehbiel have offered many valuable
suggestions as to arrangements and
plans.
Will Kncourage Originality.
The object of the organization can
best be understood by a quotation from
the constitution: "The objects of this
society shall be the encouragement of
musical and dramatic composition by
the Students of Stanford University,
and the presentation, for the benefit of
the Stanford Union or' other student
body enterprises, of original musical
plays and other entertainments."
The constitution continues: "Mem
bership shall be limited to such grad
uates. upperclassmen and sophomores
as evince unusual ability in the com
position or presentation of musical,
dramatic, or other forms of entertain
ment."
It is the plan of the "Rams Head'
to produce annually a performance
either in the line of a musical comedy
or some other form of light dramatic
work. This performance will be con
ducted entirely by the society. It will
advertise for students to submit orig
inal work in any line for production.
The members will also submit work. A
portion of the show will in all proba
bility be given over to the work of
members and the remainder to others.
Those who show unusual ability in the
work they submit or present will be
eligible for membership in the organi
zation.
Members Constantly Productive.
Besides the annual public perform
ance the "Rams Head" expects to
give invitation performances each
semester, it is the plan of the society
to keep the members constantly pro
ductive. Each man will be expected
as a pledge of membership to produce
some original work of worth each
semester.
Plans are already under way for a
series of sketches or a light operetta
composed of sketches strung on a
light plot. This work will be sub
mitted to the sub body of the Execu
tive Committee, which have in charge
the production of the Football Show
on November 11. This work has gone
beyond the embryonic stage and con
siderable of the show in the line of
songs and short sketches is rapidly
approaching completion. The entire
operetta will undoubetdly be completed
in the course of a few weeks.
Anyone desiring to obtain any fur
ther information in regard to the
class of work desired, or having
sketches which they consider suitable
for incorporation in such a work, can
communicate with any of the member?.
In Other Universities.
Organizations of practically the
same nature as the Ramshead are very
popular in other colleges. At Wis
consin the Haresfoot Club is one of
the best known university societies.
This club was organized three years
ago and has given an opera each
soring since that time. Its produc
tions are easily the most popular dra
