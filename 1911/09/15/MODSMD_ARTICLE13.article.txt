# EDUCATOR FROM JAPAN TO ADDRESS ASSEMBLY
## DR. NITOBE. TOURING COUNTRY, SPEAKS MONDAY. "Peace Over the Pacific," Chosen as Topic by Distinguished Author and Traveler. 
### 
The first university assembly of the
semester to be addressed by a distin
guished speaker from abroad, will be
held on Monday at 10:15, when Dr.
Tnazo Nitobe will deliver an address
on "Peace over the Pacific." Dr.
Nitobe is one of the most widely
known educators of Japan. He was
educated at Johns Hopkins Univer
sity and at the University of Bonn,
in Germany. While at Johns Hop
kins he published a thesis on the rela
tions between the United States and
Japan. He later wrote the chapter
on "The influence of the West upon
Japan," in the standard history, "Fi
fty Years of New Japan." In Japan
Dr. Nitobe has served as professor
in the Sapporo Agricultural College,
as Director of Agriculture in Formosa,
as Principal of the first Tokyo High
School, and as a professor in the two
Imperial Universities at Kyoto and
Tokyo.
Wrote Hook on Japan.
Great as have been his services as
scholar and teacher, Dr. Nitobe's fame
depends mainly upon a collection of
essays known as "Bushido" which was
originally written in English and has
been translated and widely circulated
in many of the European languages.
Probably no Japanese work of litera
ture has received such world-wide re
cognition. The little book endeavors
to interpret for the western world
the spirit of chivalry which was go
highly developed in feudal Japan and
which accounts in large measure for
the wonderful advance of Japan in
recent years. Few American writers
have shown a mastery of their mother
tongue superior to that shown by Di.
Nitobe in "Bushido."
Will Arrive Today.
The distinguished educator will
arrive today or Saturday, and will
spend ten days in California, after
which he will journey eastward and
visit a number of our eastern institu
tions of learning. He will deliver
addresses there on subjects connected
with international peace and the rela
tions between bis country and the
United States.
Stanford is Fortunate.
Stanford is very fortunate in that, by
arrangement with the Japanese Asso
ciation of California, which has charge
of his engagements, it has been able
to secure the presence of Dr. Nitobe
for an assembly. Without doubt, there
is no part of the country in which
his message will be received with
greater interest than here on the Pa
cific coast. The assembly will be
one hour in length, beginning at 10:15.
Regular exercises will be resumed at
11:15.
