# Empty Front Seats.
## 
### 
The news that the students are to
hear an unusually timely address in
Assembly Hail next Monday morning
brings back the old question of the

empty front seats in
the big auditorium.
Not only do they offend
the visiting speaker,

but an especially ridiculous situation
is also created when the yell-leaders
are forced to go through pantomimic
motions with the human objects of
their efforts twenty or thirty feet
away.
Something should be done . One
good way has been suggested, that
these seats of vantage be presented to
Freshmen, and that the other classes
might regularly take positions in the
Hall according to their standing in
the university. A plan similar to this
has succeeded at other colleges, nota
bly at the University of California.
It could become a tradition. The
ushers might have the duty of seeing
that the class order was carried out
in the beginning until the custom was
established.
We respectfully submit this sug
gestion to the Faculty Committee on
Public Exercises, and to the Student
Body.
