Tomorrow the Student Hody can
show just how much faith they have
in the rugby coaches and teams and
in victory next November, by attending

the opening game of the
schedule. The Varsity
plays for the first time.
If there is any joy in

watching a well-trained group of men
playing a fine, manly game on green
turf, there will be no incentive lack
ing for a large attendance at Stanford
Field tomorrow.
Now is the time, early in the day,
to prove that we believe in final vic
tory over California. We may not be
able to play football, but there is
plenty of opportunity to cheer on the
men who do play, and at the same time
give ourselves one solid afternoon of
enjoyment watching the teams on the
field.
