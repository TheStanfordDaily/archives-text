# CARDINAL TEAMS START SCHEDULE ON STANFORD FIELD TOMORROW
## Varsity Lines Up Against Barbarians.-Freshmen Meet the Fast Fifteen from Berkeley High to Inaugurate Fall Rugby Season on Local Turf. Varsity vs. Barbarians. Freshmen vs. Berkeley High. 
### 
Rugby has its first official opening
tomorrow afternoon when the Varsity
lines ui> against the Barbarians and
the Freshmen try conclusions with

Berkeley High School on Stanford
Field. The Freshmen game is set for
2:l!0. The veterans will play the San
Franciscans an hour later.
This will he the first time this fall
that, the Varsity have had a chance to
play together. They were given their
first practice as a Varsity group during
the workout hour this afternoon.
Every one of the men have been under
fire this season in the hard fought
games that distinguished the eliminat
ing rounds of the interclass series.
In these scrummages each one of
these men were in the thick of the
work and showed excellent condition
for an appearance so early in the sea
son.
Eight-man Serum Used.
The eight-man scrum will be used,
as has been the practice so far this
year. The notables in this department
are: A. Sanborn, hooker, who cinched
his reputation as a scrummager in the
post-season series last fall; Corbett
and Hall will ballast him; Dole and

Partridge will form the center support
and as such are without their peers
as forwards on the Pacific Slope;
Schaupp, Watkius, and Frank are
the rear rankers. Frank was one of
the stars of last year's fifteen while
Schaupp and Watkins are second team
veterans.
Big ItiM-kticid Change.
! On the backline will be seen a
change that has been anticipated by
the rooters who have watched the
Seniors in action. Erb is to be brought
back to the full position while Brown
is sent to the line for center three
quarters. Cass, veteran half of the
1909 Varsity, is to again play scrum
half. This will make a great change
in the back line and promises to create
a more powerful backfield than the
Cardinal has had for some time. Har
rigan and Reeves, on the side lines
nursing minor injuries, will be sub
stituted for by King and Noble. These
two men are heady players and will
make the most of their Varsity appear
ance. Geissler and Kern will work
together on the wings.
The Freshman line-up will read the
same as was posted for yesterday's
great battle, with the exception of
substitutes for Haley, llisling and Sim,
the trio who sustained minor injuries
during the struggle, should they nof
he able to appear.
Following the custom of the first
outside game practically the entire
lineup of the first year men will be
changed during the match in order to
test as many men as possible under
fire.
Two Strong Opponents.
Both of the opponents for the Car
dinal teams have a strong group of
players. The Barbarians have twice
outplayed the California Varsity, and
have taken some of the best of the
local high schools into camp. The
Berkeley High lads have beaten the
Blue and Gold babies to the tune of
: 17-3. They should therefore afford
the Cardinal Freshmen plenty of op
| portunity to repeat the showing made
by them on Stanford Field yesterday.

An admission of fifty cents will be
charged for the two games. An oppor
tunity will be given to buy a season
ticket from the ticket sellers at the
gates. These will admit their holder
to tomorrow's game as well as the
future Saturday games, not. however,

including tlie inter-state and intercol
legiate games.
