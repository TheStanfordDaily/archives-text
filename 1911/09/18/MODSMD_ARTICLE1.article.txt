# FRESHMAN AND VARSITY VICTORIES OPEN SEASON
## Veterans Overwhelm Barbarians 23 to 3.—Berkeley High Rugby Squad Vanquished by Cardinal Novices with 3 to 0 Score. 
### 
Never has a rugby season opened
more auspiciously at Stanford, than
did the double-headed victory on Stan
ford Field, Saturday afternoon, which
inaugurated the 1911 schedule. The
Freshman game was the first on the
boards and the fast Berkeley High
School fifteen was taken into camp
the Cardinal novices with a 3-0 score.
The Veterans walked away with the
Barbarians in the next set-to, the
veterans tallying 211 points to the club
men's lone 3. This was the first score
this team has scored on a Stanford
Varsity for several years.
Score After .Minute and Half.
The Varsity side, altho playing to
gether for the first time this fall,
started out with the precision of a ma
chine before the shrill echo of Referee
Cameron's whistle signalling the kick
off had died away. One and a half
minutes later the scoreboard registered
Stanford's first try. Partridge, (leiss
ler and Noble were the scoring trio,
with the latter putting the ball across.
Score, Varsity, 3; Barbarians, 0.
From then on the Barbarians fought
hard on the defense but the Cardinal
players broke thru their line almost
at will. Several tries were lost at the
last minute by the Varsity, which
would have been realized on in a later
season game.
One of the neatest combines that a
rugby enthusiast ever witnessed was
the team work for the second try. At
a lineout on the visitors 30, Kern threw
into Dole, waiting five yards in, then
striding back into the field over the
touch line. Kern received the ball back
from Dole, and, passing via Schaupp
and A. Sanborn, sent Watkins across
for three points. Score, 6-0.
The remainder of the first half saw
no addition to the scoreboard, and as
the half advanced the game steadied
around the clubmen's 25. Several
times Cardinal rushes, passing, or
dribbling, were narrowly averted from
scoring when the Barbarians saved.
The only dangerous moment for the
Varsity was during the two tries, when
a dribbling rush led by Pomeroy and
Tufts was stopped by Cass at his 20.
Erb hurled the Barbs back a few min
utes later when he found touch at mid
field.
Broun Drops u Gonl.
But half a minute of play in the last

period had passed before Brown se
cured in the loose at the visitors 2.">
and dropped a goal, netting four
points.
Ten minutes later W. L. Smith was
sent into the game to replace Frank.
He signalized his appearance by a try
thru the loose from 10. Erb convert
ed. Score l. r >-0.
The game then hung for several
minutes around the half-way line.
From the Barbs 2"», Dole, Cass, San
born and Card sent the leather oval
over for a try. Score 18-0.
Two minutes saw the Stanford score
hook close, when a passing rush via
Dole, Cass, and Hubbard, gave Schaupp
the ball for a tally. Erb converted.
Score, 23-0.
Burks Score Only Try.
The last few minutes of play mark
ed the only tally for the visitors, when
after a long dribbling rush from near
tnidfield. Tufts secured at Stanford's
10 and jumped across for a try.
McElrath failed to convert.
Final score: Stanford. 23, Barbari
ans, 3.
Freshmen, 3; Berkeley Iligli. 0.
The scrummage between the Fresh
en and the Berkeley High boys was
closely contested. 191."> started out
handicapped with a case of stage
fright and Berkeley nearly rushed
them off their feet, before the Cardinal
babies awoke. But, in general, they
showed plenty of dash and proved
themselves more than a match for
the trans-bay men.
Berkeley Onrush Stopped.
With the opening half about half
over. Wines stopped the onrush. Ris
liug then secured at his 4ft, dodged
thru to the visitors 40, and booted 20.
Erb added ten more by dribbling.
Stanford offside alone prevented a
score. Forbes kicked to midfleld. As
the half ended Wines blocked a free
kick from placement at 1915's 35.
The only score of the game was
made before five minutes of the se
cond half had passed. Risling started
the movement on a free kick front
Berkeley's 4. r > to the loose at 25.
There Hausawa took charge and
dribbled to a five yard scrum. Berke
ley, fighting hard, drove back the Car
dinal to 2. r ». From the loose Erb se-
cured. He passed to Soper, to Tho
burn, who went across. Risling failed
on a difficult conversion.
The Freshmen were just getting
their real stride by this time. Twice
more in the next few minutes they
should have scored.
