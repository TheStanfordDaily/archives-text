# STANFORD BAND WILL HAVE TWO DIVISIONS.
## RIVALRY TO BE ADDED BY A GOOD SCHEME. Plan to Have Music for Visiting Teams. Two Leaders Have Been Appointed. 
### 
According to present plans the
Stanford Hand is to be divided into
two sections, known as the First and
Second Bleacher Hands. This scheme
was worked out by the Executive
Committee of the organization, con
sisting of Professor E. W. Martin,
R. R. Heal, '12, B. A. Stephenson, '12,
and F. R. s. Mifesner, '13.
H. A. Stephenson, '12, and (J. P.
Ross, '14, have been chosen to lead
the two sections, each of which is to
be composed of twenty-five men. As
nearly as possible men who have play
ed in the original Hand are to be
placed in the first division, whtle the
new players will take places in the
second organization.
The purpose of this new plan is to
add a spirit of rivalry to band work on
the campus which has previously been
unknown, except at the time of the
inter-collegiate contests with Califor
nia. If it is agreeable to the yell
leader all visiting teams who come to
| (he campus without a musical organi
zation will be furnished one of the
local bands to play for them during
the afternoon.
Ihe two divisions will practice at
different times in order that one half
may always be available for bleacher
work. Each division's purpose is to
do its best to surpass ihe other in the
matter of perfection. A final contest
will probtbly be held on Junior Day
to decide the supremacy.
For concert work and at the big
intercollegiate contests the two divi
sions will combine, making a total of
fifty pieces.
The financial condition of the band
is excellent, through the aid of the
Student Hody. In addition, a number
of pieces have been added to the equip
ment, including two french horns, one
Muegel horn, and several clarinets.
Officers for this year are as follows:
R. R. Heal, '12, leader; R. A. Stephen
son, '12, assistant leader; F, R. S.
Missner, '13, business manager; Horn,
grâ€ž librarian; W. M. Bradford, '15,
assistant librarian; L. R. Reynolds.
'15, property man.
