# CALIFORNIA HAS ORIENTOPHOBIA, SAYS DR. NITOBE
## Speaker in Assembly Address on "Peace Over the Pacific," Lauds Words of President Jordan. 
### 
Dr. Inazo Nitobe, a graduate of
.Johns Hopkins University and one of
the best known of .Japanese educators,
presented a remarkably impartial
view of the Japanese-American situa
tion in an address on "Peace of the
Pacific" at the first university assem
bly of tlie semester at 10:15 today.
Exchange of Peace.
In introducing Dr. Nitobe, Dr. J. C.
Brainier, acting head of the univer
sity, happily referred to the visit of
Dr. Nitobe to America and President
Jordan's voyage to Japan as an ex
change of the Occident's and orient's
peace experts.
Dr. Nitobe extended a rare tribute
to President Jordan, ' whose scientific
achievements have placed him upon a
pedestal of immortal fame," he de
clared, in speaking of the president's
visit at his home In Japan.
"America has done much in the edu
cation of Japan; but if there is any
message which you must send to us
; just at this juncture, it is the one
which Dr. Jordan is carrying to my
country," declared Dr. Nitobe.
Mischievous Rumors Afloat.
"For one reason or other there
seems to be afloat in the air the most
inischievious and unfortunate rumors
of a possible war between the United
j States and Japan. I know that you
j as members of the Leland Stanford
J Junior university have imbibed the
spirit of peace."
"But there are not a few business
concerns which profit by talks about
war; there are not a few individuals
who utilize the falsest reports for their
own promotion or profit. My sus
picions are well grounded that many
an individual, many a business con
cern, and many a nation, is bent upon
stirring up strife ltetween the two na
tions. solely from a selfish motive.
Many a company can get good orders
from ship-building materials, arma
ment and provisions by inciting a war
scare."
"Not a grain of reason is left among
the air bubbles of the scare-mongers
that can lie given as a just ground of
war, whereas there is every reason to
believe that the two nations which
fringe the Pacific are tied by the bonds
of friendship, stronger than any bond
which binds any other two nations."
Concerning the oft-given racial ob

jection, Dr. Nitobe referred to the his
tory of the intercourse of the two na
tions as proof that it is not substanti
ated. Commodore's Perry's visit to
Japan, reflected America's purposes,
and peacefully, in that when Perry
asked if he might use force in the
event diplomacy failed, he was told to
refrain from it.
The other Americans that followed
Perry to Japan were just the type of
true Americans, declared the Japanese
educator. He referred at length to the
benefits Japan derived from the visits
of Townsend Harris, foreign minister
to Japan, Ambassador Ruck. Bingham
and Hubbard.
Dr. Nitobe laid the duty of preserv
ing the amicable relations of the two
countries on the individuals as well as
the governments. To exclude a race
011 account of a racial difference, he
declared, was to admit the incapacity
of American institutions to assimilate
all races.
Assails Labor Argument.
The arguments of the economists
that cheap labor must be excluded, Dr.
Nitobe assailed vigorously, inferring
that it would be as logical to burn all
the latest inventions in machinery.
"Just as nature abhors a vacuum,
social economy abhors a dearth of la
bor when land and capital can be had
in abundance," asserted Dr. Nitobe.
"California, a great State of over
165,000 square miles, larger than the
area of Japan itself by some 10,000
square miles, provided with only two
and one third million population, equal
to one twenty-second of ours, with &
density of only fifteen to the square
mile, must depend upon foreign labor
for the proper cultivation of its soil.
"I wish some Stanford man would
take up for scientific treatment the
subject of the economic loss sustained
by California 011 account of oriento
phobia," the Japanese educator assert
ed. He complimented the work of
Miss Mary Roberts Coolidge, whose
impartial researches he said had made
clem- many points relating to the
Chinese.
Dr. Nitobe condoned the attitude of
the United States in continuing to
appeal to the honor of Japan, by a
sort of gentlemen's agreement among
nations, to restrict immigration to
America, quoting Professor Coolidge,
of Harvard, that America "cannot de
pend indefinitely 011 the generosity,
real or presumed, of a neighbor."
The efforts of demagogues to make of
trifling Incidents, issues of interna
tional magnitude in both nations. Dr.
Nitobe found 110 excuse for.
111 closing the Japanese professor
stated his sincere hope "that all
rumors of war may prove a transient
dream, a horrible nightmare that
passes witli the coming of the dawn."
The custom of the varsity yell at
the conclusion of the hymn was aban
doned today.

"But there are not a few business
concerns which profit by talks about
war; there are not a few individuals
who utilize the falsest reports for their

Concerning the oft-given racial ob

jection, Dr. Nitobe referred to the his
tory of the intercourse of the two na
tions as proof that it is not substanti
ated. Commodore's Perry's visit to
Japan, reflected America's purposes,
and peacefully, in that when Perry
asked if he might use force in the
event diplomacy failed, he was told to
refrain from it.
The other Americans that followed
Perry to Japan were just the type of
true Americans, declared the Japanese
educator. He referred at length to the
benefits Japan derived from the visits
of Townsend Harris, foreign minister
to Japan, Ambassador Ruck. Bingham
and Hubbard.
Dr. Nitobe laid the duty of preserv
ing the amicable relations of the two
countries on the individuals as well as
the governments. To exclude a race
011 account of a racial difference, he
declared, was to admit the incapacity
of American institutions to assimilate
all races.
Assails Labor Argument.
The arguments of the economists
that cheap labor must be excluded, Dr.
Nitobe assailed vigorously, inferring
that it would be as logical to burn all
the latest inventions in machinery.
"Just as nature abhors a vacuum,
social economy abhors a dearth of la
bor when land and capital can be had
in abundance," asserted Dr. Nitobe.
"California, a great State of over
165,000 square miles, larger than the
area of Japan itself by some 10,000
square miles, provided with only two
and one third million population, equal
to one twenty-second of ours, with &
density of only fifteen to the square
mile, must depend upon foreign labor
for the proper cultivation of its soil.
"I wish some Stanford man would
take up for scientific treatment the
subject of the economic loss sustained
by California 011 account of oriento
phobia," the Japanese educator assert
ed. He complimented the work of
Miss Mary Roberts Coolidge, whose
impartial researches he said had made
clem- many points relating to the
Chinese.
Dr. Nitobe condoned the attitude of
the United States in continuing to
appeal to the honor of Japan, by a
sort of gentlemen's agreement among
nations, to restrict immigration to
America, quoting Professor Coolidge,
of Harvard, that America "cannot de
pend indefinitely 011 the generosity,
real or presumed, of a neighbor."
The efforts of demagogues to make of
trifling Incidents, issues of interna
tional magnitude in both nations. Dr.
Nitobe found 110 excuse for.
111 closing the Japanese professor
stated his sincere hope "that all
rumors of war may prove a transient
dream, a horrible nightmare that
passes witli the coming of the dawn."

Dr. Inazo Nitobe, a graduate of
.Johns Hopkins University and one of

presented a remarkably impartial
view of the Japanese-American situa
tion in an address on "Peace of the
Pacific" at the first university assem
bly of tlie semester at 10:15 today.
Exchange of Peace.
In introducing Dr. Nitobe, Dr. J. C.
Brainier, acting head of the univer
sity, happily referred to the visit of
Dr. Nitobe to America and President
Jordan's voyage to Japan as an ex
change of the Occident's and orient's
peace experts.
Dr. Nitobe extended a rare tribute
to President Jordan, ' whose scientific
achievements have placed him upon a
pedestal of immortal fame," he de
clared, in speaking of the president's
visit at his home In Japan.
"America has done much in the edu
cation of Japan; but if there is any
message which you must send to us
; just at this juncture, it is the one
which Dr. Jordan is carrying to my
country," declared Dr. Nitobe.
Mischievous Rumors Afloat.
"For one reason or other there
