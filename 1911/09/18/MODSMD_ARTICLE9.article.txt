# Gentlemen For Yell-leaders.
## 
### 
Probably no student on the campus
realizes the importance of the yell
leaders. Nor does he realize the
necessity for electing the most capable

men for the positions.
On the face of it the
yell-leader seems a
machine, to take care

of cheering and organize enthusi
asm on the field. But it should be
remembered that the leader, in mo
ments of excitement, must do the
thinking for over a thousand people,
and must combine all their gentle
manly qualities into his conduct. Me
should be a "gentleman."
At every Big Game fifteen or twenty
thousand people are watching the rival
rooting sections. They are comparing.
There are noting where one fails and
the other succeeds; how much true
sportsmanship and gentleinanliness
the two reveal. And there is the real
test for the yell-leader. He must be
chosen wisely.
Four straw votes will be held with
in the next week to select two assistant
leaders from sixteen candidates. The
first principle in this should be: "(let
the best men." For the sake of all that
is good in student sports and activities
leave all partisanship out of your vot
ing. Vote for the man you respect
and have faith in: who has the ability.
No one will know how you vote.
Choose as you believe and forget class
feelings, and all the petty rivalries
that may easily enter into a contest of
this kind.
