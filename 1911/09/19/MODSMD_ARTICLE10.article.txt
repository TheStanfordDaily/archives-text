First Half Starts Slow.
The first, half started off with rather
slow work around midfield, with the
Sophomores having a shade the advan
tage. The play was confined chiefly
to kicking duels that netted little for
either group.
Because of quickness in the scrums
and in smothering opposition, both
sides were unable to carry out any
effective passing rushes.
Seniors Score Twice.
The Seniors, using their opportun
ity, and aided by stellar running and
headwork, were twice able to score.
McCreary and Geissler were the 1014
back stars. Clover and Boulware
were hard scrum workers. T. San
born was 1012's consistent star.
John O. Miller, '08, held the whistle.

The first score for the Seniors came

picked up out of the ruck and ran forty
yards to a try. Erb converted. Se
