# STANFORD WOMEN WILL HEAR SUFFRAGE LEADER.
## Margaret Haley, of Chicago, Will Address the League on Emancipation of Women. 
### 
Miss Margaret Haley is to give an
informal talk next Thursday evening
at 8:15, at the Delta Gamma house.
Miss Haley is a Chicago woman, hav
ing been a teacher in one of the pub
lic schools of that city. She is a wo
man with a keen intelligence and un
derstanding of present economic con
ditions, and on Thursday evening will
tell the story of her struggle against
several large business corporations in
Chicago, and how they were forced to
pay taxes that had long been due.
Being a teacher herself, she is
especially interested in the question
of teachers' salaries, and, thru her
efforts, salaries in Chicago have been
considerably raised. To hear Miss
Haley speak on Thursday evening is
to have the opportunity of hearing
the question of Equal Suffrage dis
cussed from an economic point of view
and it is to be hoped that the men as
well as the women of the University
will be interested enough, and fair
minded enough, to avail themselves
of this opportunity.
