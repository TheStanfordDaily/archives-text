# "WORLD AND HIS WIFE" IS AN UNUSUAL PLAY
## "WORLD AND HIS WIFE" BEST PLAY FOR YEARS. Coming Production Sure to be a Success.—Drama Will Appeal to All Who Witness It. 
### 
For a group of college thespians to
decide to produce a play which ran to
a year of packed houses in New York
aiul a similar time on the road is
certain evidence that they have chosen j
a good vehicle for their local pre
sentation. Such is the case with the
play which Sword and Sandals will
give on September 29: "The World
and His Wife," by Nirdlinger.
William Faversham the famous ac
tor who made such a pronounced hit
in the western play "The Squaw Man"
choose as his play for the following
year, "The World and His Wife.'
It played to crowded houses during its
entire two years run. The reason is
not far to seek. It is a play which
appeals equally to the student of lit
erature or to the hardened theatre-

goer who is looking merely for some
excitement in the form of a play. It
is well written and contains tense
dramatic situations; it is exciting dur
ing every minute of its three acts.
For a college audience the play will
appeal equally to the "highbrow" and
the "rough." Diversity of appeal is
one of the ultimate tests of good
drama. "The World and His Wife"
stands up perfectly under the test.
Outside of a few Shakesperean pro
ductions which have been given at
Stanford it is the best play that lias
ever been offered to tbe local public.
In tbe opinion of many who are com
petent to judge tbe original in Span
ish, "The Great Galeoto" is the world's
most gripping play. In the English
adaptation in the form of "The World
and His Wife." the play has lost little
of that elemental strength which
makes it appeal to all.
The adaptation from the Spanish
still retains considerable of the hot
southern atmosphere of the original.
Although certain of the situations
are essentially Spanish in their na
ture the central theme is universal.
Duels and affairs of honor are foreign
to an American code of ethics, but
the central Idea of the terrible con
sequences of unrestricted gossip are
as patent in America as in Spain, or


Miss <«. I). Workman, '12. as 1 Ik* Wife,
any other country of the world. And
the play deals with the disastrous
effects of gossip and unfounded
scandal on the universal, but in this
case innocent, triangle of husband,
wife and friend.
That the college will talk about
"The World and His Wife" long after
every other play is forgotten seems
beyond the slightest question of doubt.
That those who miss it will be re
gretting it for the rest of their col
lege days is quite as evident.
The following characters appear
in the play:
In the leading woman's role Miss
G. Workman, '12, has been excellently
cast as "the wife." The part gives the
portrayer every opportunity to dis
play the best histrionic talent that
she possesses.
Playing opposite to Miss Workman
in the role of Ernesto, R. H. Seward,
'12, has the best part that he has ever
had an opportunity to play at Stan
ford. It is full of the suppressed fire
and poetic charm which when combin
ed are best suited to this versatile
actor.
In the part of Don Julian, S. Brown,
'13, will for the first time have a
true chance to show a Stanford au
dience that he has rare ability as an
interpreter of certain kinds of parts.
E. F. Kern, '13, will have the most
dilicult task that he has ever attempt
ed in a dramatic way when he steps
on the stage as Don Severo, the villain
of the piece, if it can be said to have
a villain. It is a part requiring rare
skill and dramatic appreciation.
As Mercedes, Dona Severo's wife,
Miss D. Parkinson, '13, will have a
big part with big possibilities. It is
through the unconscous machinations
of Severo and his wife that the
trouble which has long been brewing
reaches the boiling point.
Don Pepito will be played by C. S.
Turpin, '13. It is not an easy part,
tint Turpin's spontaneity will carry
him through.
For the first time since his appear
ance on the Stanford stage, J. n. Be
ma-i, 12, will not play the comedy
role. Although his part of Captain
Beaulieu has light touches it is never
putin the play merely as a fun
maker. Heman carries his new role
with ease.
I. I. Ingraham, '13, will play the
part of Genaro. It is well suited to
Ingraham's powers, and those who
saw him in the "Senator" will see
something quite as good in Genaro.

skill and dramatic appreciation.
As Mercedes, Dona Severo's wife,
Miss D. Parkinson, '13, will have a
big part with big possibilities. It is
through the unconscous machinations
of Severo and his wife that the
trouble which has long been brewing
reaches the boiling point.
Don Pepito will be played by C. S.
Turpin, '13. It is not an easy part,
tint Turpin's spontaneity will carry
him through.
For the first time since his appear
ance on the Stanford stage, J. n. Be
ma-i, 12, will not play the comedy
role. Although his part of Captain
Beaulieu has light touches it is never
putin the play merely as a fun
maker. Heman carries his new role
with ease.
I. I. Ingraham, '13, will play the
part of Genaro. It is well suited to
Ingraham's powers, and those who
saw him in the "Senator" will see
something quite as good in Genaro.
For a group of college thespians to
decide to produce a play which ran to
a year of packed houses in New York
aiul a similar time on the road is
certain evidence that they have chosen j
a good vehicle for their local pre
sentation. Such is the case with the
play which Sword and Sandals will
give on September 29: "The World
and His Wife," by Nirdlinger.
William Faversham the famous ac
tor who made such a pronounced hit
in the western play "The Squaw Man"
choose as his play for the following
year, "The World and His Wife.'
It played to crowded houses during its
entire two years run. The reason is
not far to seek. It is a play which
appeals equally to the student of lit
erature or to the hardened theatre-

goer who is looking merely for some
excitement in the form of a play. It
is well written and contains tense
dramatic situations; it is exciting dur
ing every minute of its three acts.
For a college audience the play will
appeal equally to the "highbrow" and
the "rough." Diversity of appeal is
one of the ultimate tests of good
drama. "The World and His Wife"
stands up perfectly under the test.
Outside of a few Shakesperean pro
ductions which have been given at
Stanford it is the best play that lias
ever been offered to tbe local public.
In tbe opinion of many who are com
petent to judge tbe original in Span
ish, "The Great Galeoto" is the world's
most gripping play. In the English
adaptation in the form of "The World
and His Wife." the play has lost little
of that elemental strength which
makes it appeal to all.
The adaptation from the Spanish
still retains considerable of the hot
southern atmosphere of the original.
Although certain of the situations
are essentially Spanish in their na
ture the central theme is universal.
Duels and affairs of honor are foreign
to an American code of ethics, but
the central Idea of the terrible con
sequences of unrestricted gossip are
as patent in America as in Spain, or


Miss <«. I). Workman, '12. as 1 Ik* Wife,
any other country of the world. And
the play deals with the disastrous
effects of gossip and unfounded
scandal on the universal, but in this
case innocent, triangle of husband,
wife and friend.
That the college will talk about
"The World and His Wife" long after
every other play is forgotten seems
beyond the slightest question of doubt.
That those who miss it will be re
gretting it for the rest of their col
lege days is quite as evident.
The following characters appear
in the play:
In the leading woman's role Miss
G. Workman, '12, has been excellently
cast as "the wife." The part gives the
portrayer every opportunity to dis
play the best histrionic talent that
she possesses.
Playing opposite to Miss Workman
in the role of Ernesto, R. H. Seward,
'12, has the best part that he has ever
had an opportunity to play at Stan
ford. It is full of the suppressed fire
and poetic charm which when combin
ed are best suited to this versatile
actor.
In the part of Don Julian, S. Brown,
'13, will for the first time have a
true chance to show a Stanford au
dience that he has rare ability as an
interpreter of certain kinds of parts.
E. F. Kern, '13, will have the most
dilicult task that he has ever attempt
ed in a dramatic way when he steps
on the stage as Don Severo, the villain
of the piece, if it can be said to have
a villain. It is a part requiring rare
skill and dramatic appreciation.
