# "WORLD AND HIS WIFE" IS AN UNUSUAL PLAY
## "WORLD AND HIS WIFE" BEST PLAY FOR YEARS. Coming Production Sure to be a Success.—Drama Will Appeal to All Who Witness It. 
### 
For a group of college thespians to
decide to produce a play which ran to
a year of packed houses in New York
aiul a similar time on the road is
certain evidence that they have chosen j
a good vehicle for their local pre
sentation. Such is the case with the
play which Sword and Sandals will
give on September 29: "The World
and His Wife," by Nirdlinger.
William Faversham the famous ac
tor who made such a pronounced hit
in the western play "The Squaw Man"
choose as his play for the following
year, "The World and His Wife.'
It played to crowded houses during its
entire two years run. The reason is
not far to seek. It is a play which
appeals equally to the student of lit
erature or to the hardened theatre-

goer who is looking merely for some
excitement in the form of a play. It
is well written and contains tense
dramatic situations; it is exciting dur
ing every minute of its three acts.
For a college audience the play will
appeal equally to the "highbrow" and
the "rough." Diversity of appeal is
one of the ultimate tests of good
drama. "The World and His Wife"
stands up perfectly under the test.
Outside of a few Shakesperean pro
ductions which have been given at
Stanford it is the best play that lias
ever been offered to tbe local public.
In tbe opinion of many who are com
petent to judge tbe original in Span
ish, "The Great Galeoto" is the world's
most gripping play. In the English
adaptation in the form of "The World
and His Wife." the play has lost little
of that elemental strength which
makes it appeal to all.
The adaptation from the Spanish
still retains considerable of the hot
southern atmosphere of the original.
Although certain of the situations
are essentially Spanish in their na
ture the central theme is universal.
Duels and affairs of honor are foreign
to an American code of ethics, but
the central Idea of the terrible con
sequences of unrestricted gossip are
as patent in America as in Spain, or
