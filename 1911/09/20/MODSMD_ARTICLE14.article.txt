# Faculty Fencing Club is Formed.
## 
### 
Desirous of becoming proficient in
the art of fencing, and to receive the
exercise and pleasure the sport affords,
a number of members of the faculty
have organized a fencing class. The
organization is in no way connected
with the Foil and Mask although a
few of its members have expressed
their willingness to become honorary
members of the students' club. The
class meets once a week to receive
instruction from Director Maloney, of
the Encina Gymnasium.
The members are: B. O. Foster, H.
Zinsser, W. A. Cooper, H. V. Poor,
E. W. Martin, E. B. Krehbiel and E. M.
Espinosa. Invitations to join have
been given to other members of the
faculty.
