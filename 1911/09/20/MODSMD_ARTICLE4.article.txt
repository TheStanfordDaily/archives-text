Victoria and Vancouver to Cnitc in
Sending Championship Team
To California Soil.

"If the best men from the
Victoria and Vancouver teams
are able to come south, we will
have a great team to line up
against, and the g:aiue should
he a splendid exhibition," said
football coach Presley, upon
hearing of t.lte new plans of the
Northerners.

To play the Varsities of Stanford and
California this year, an All-Star fifteen
will be picke d from the Canadian
rugby teams of Vancouver and Vic
toria. Word of this has just been re
ceived by Graduate Manager D. W.
Burbank from the British Columbia
Rugby Union. Such a plan will do
away with the games scheduled with
the Vancouver team alone for Novem
ber 1 and 4. The games with the Nor
thern combination will replace these
dates.
Varsities <»r«i <111 all > Conquer.
Year after year, since rugby first
entered the Varsity field, teams from
the southland have journeyed north
to play the teams of Vancouver and
Victoria, or the northern teams have
come south to play the Stanford and
California aggregations. At first the
Canadians were the victors by a wide
margin, but gradually the new recruits
began to make inroads on the scoring
department and then to win the laur
els of the victors. Now we have the
wo champion British Columbia fifteens
combining to send south a team pick
ed from their star performers in an
endeavor to again swing the line of
victories back to Canada.
Last Christmas squads represent
ing" the Universities of Stanford and
I California, strong fighting groups but
not tbe veteran composition that had
I lined up against each other at, the
Intercollegiate in November, were
j sent North. In both instances the in
vaders were successful, two out of
the series of three games in each case
being chalked up as victories for
! American collegians.
Northerners Will lie Strong.
This combination of the "Double
IV" will lethe strongest rugby team
| that has ever invaded California.
They should make a strong bid for
i victories over both t!ie Cardinal and
Blue and Gold Varsities. Vancouver
and Victoria have heretofore been bit
ter rugby opponents and the yearly

"If the best men from the
Victoria and Vancouver teams
are able to come south, we will
have a great team to line up
against, and the g:aiue should
he a splendid exhibition," said
football coach Presley, upon
hearing of t.lte new plans of the
Northerners.

To play the Varsities of Stanford and
California this year, an All-Star fifteen
will be picke d from the Canadian
rugby teams of Vancouver and Vic
toria. Word of this has just been re
ceived by Graduate Manager D. W.
Burbank from the British Columbia
Rugby Union. Such a plan will do
away with the games scheduled with
the Vancouver team alone for Novem
ber 1 and 4. The games with the Nor
thern combination will replace these
dates.
Varsities <»r«i <111 all > Conquer.
Year after year, since rugby first
entered the Varsity field, teams from
the southland have journeyed north
to play the teams of Vancouver and
Victoria, or the northern teams have
come south to play the Stanford and
California aggregations. At first the
Canadians were the victors by a wide
margin, but gradually the new recruits
began to make inroads on the scoring
department and then to win the laur
els of the victors. Now we have the
wo champion British Columbia fifteens
combining to send south a team pick
ed from their star performers in an
endeavor to again swing the line of
victories back to Canada.
Last Christmas squads represent
ing" the Universities of Stanford and
I California, strong fighting groups but
not tbe veteran composition that had
I lined up against each other at, the
Intercollegiate in November, were
j sent North. In both instances the in
vaders were successful, two out of
the series of three games in each case
being chalked up as victories for
! American collegians.
Northerners Will lie Strong.
This combination of the "Double
IV" will lethe strongest rugby team
| that has ever invaded California.
They should make a strong bid for
i victories over both t!ie Cardinal and
Blue and Gold Varsities. Vancouver
and Victoria have heretofore been bit
ter rugby opponents and the yearly
series of the British Columbia I'nioi
for the championship have generally
found there two groups in the finai
I match. Now for the first time t!iev
| combined and are ready to in
: vade a foreign land in order *o pre
serve fie rugby traditions of Old Eng
i land.
Such games as the two planned
would probably be as gruelling 112 ti
the two Varsities as the Stanford-
California match.
