# "WORLD AND HIS WIFE" WILL BE FINISHED PIECE.
## Rehearsals Assuming Form That is Near Perfection.â€”Play Not Dark Tragedy. 
### 
With the Sword and Sandals play
little more than a week off. the cast
is rapidly rounding into form. The
lines were found to have a certain pe
culiar difficulty when it came to mas
tering them, but that has been over
come and now they are completely
learned and the remainder of the work

will be centered on making the pro
duction go through with perfect
smoothness.
The business, which has been devised
fcr the play by Coach F. L. Mathieu,
is particularly good, and he is well
pleased with the progress of the piece.
This is particularly true of the lighter
spots in the production. For, although
the entire play is of a rather sombre
tone, it contains many fanciful touches
that make it particularly attractive.
It has bee 1 imagined by some that the
play is without any redeeming touches
of any kind and is from one end to the
other a dark tragedy. This is not
true. There are tragical elements but
it is tremendously satisfactory as a
whole.
Already in rehearsals the work of
the leading characters is impressed
with the stamp of the best that has
ever been given at Stanford. With
another week in which to add the
finishing touches, the performance
should be truly professional.
