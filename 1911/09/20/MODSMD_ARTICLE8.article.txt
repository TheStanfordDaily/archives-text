# FIFTY CANDIDATES SIGN FOR FALL TRAINING
## TRACK RALLY LAST NIGHT IS WELL ATTENDED. Captain T.L. Coleman, "Dad" Moulton and C.L. Moore Speak to Path Athletes. 
### 
Fifty aspirants for cinder path
honors signified their intention last
night to do fall training, by signing
up with Track Captain T. L. Coleman,
'12, at the rally in the training house.
This number will be greatly augmented
in a few weeks, since many of the
football candidates will then devote
part of their time to work on the oval.
The rally was opened by Captain
Coleman, who briefly outlined the pur
pose of the fall training. He urged
every man who was able to do so to
begin light work at once. Coleman
pointed out the necessity of getting
an early start, especially for the men
who had never before competed in
track and field sports.
"Dad" Moulton, the veteran Cardin
al trainer, expressed himself as being
well-pleased with the fall outlook,
and explained to the men the oppor
tunity for success this year. "Right
now, stated "Dad," "we have at least
thirty more points in sight than at
the same time last September. The
outlook for a successful season against
California is more than bright and
with conscientious training there is
no reason why Stanford should not be
returned the winner of the inter
collegiate meet in 1912."
Cross-Country Explained.
Cross-country running, as outlined
by the members of the newly organ
ized cross-country club, was explained
by C. L. Moore, '12. For this work the
gymnasium authorities have granted
the usual credit to the men registered
for a regular gymnasium period. The
running, however, is not confined to
gymnasium students only, but is open
to all interested.
The runs will start every Monday,
Wednesday and Friday afternoons at
4:4. r t, from Encina gym. The cross
country training is in charge of the
more experienced trackmen, and the
length of the runs will be determined
by them. It is hoped to develop many
excellent distance men by this method.
Trainer Moulton will be at tlie track
every morning from 10 to 12; and in
the afternoon from 3 to 4. In addition
to "Dad," many of last season's veter
ans will be on hand to assist in coach
ins tlie new men. All candidates who
have not signed up for tall work are
requested to hand in their names to
Captain Coleman or to Trainer Moul
ton. The list of those who signified
their intention to comence light work
