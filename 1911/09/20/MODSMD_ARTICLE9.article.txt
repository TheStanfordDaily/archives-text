# FRESHMEN DEFEAT CRIPPLED PALO ALTANS
## WELL-FOUGHT GAME PLAYED ON TURF TODAY. 1915 and Strong Fifteen From the High School Squad Give Good Exhibition. 
### 
Finail Score: 1915, S; l'alo Alto, l>.
Both tries by Wilson.
Palo Alto High's crack fifteen lined
np against the Cardinal Fresljm.en this
afternoon on Stanford Field. The
preparatory school men were weaken
ed by the loss of E. Kisling, captain
of the team, and Mills, a strong scrum
player. The 1915 line-up was unim
paired.
The game opened up with each side
testing the other's strength. Palo
Alto proved faster at dribbling, but
were outweighed by the Freshman
pack huskies. The high school men
used the eight-man scrum for the first
time this semester.
At the end of a quarter of an hour
the Freshmen first showed scoring
ability, when Wilson dribbled over,
aided by Erb. Templeton, a former
Palo Alto player, converted.
Stevens was a good touch finder for
Palo Alto, and Erb evened up matters
for 1915.
Palo Alto was penalized five times
in the first half for offside, over
anxiousness causing it.
The line-ups were:
Freshmen: Wines, Hausawa. Soper,
Dutton, Bloeser, Ramsay, Haley, Wil
son, forwards; Clark, half; Risling,
Erb, fives; Ross, center; Cookson,
Templeton, wings; Hutchinson, full.
Palo Alto: Nagle, McGilvray, O'Lane,
Murray, Card, Dubendorf, Gladstone,
Clark, forwards; B. Stevens, half;
Davidson (capt.) first five; Campbell,
Matheson, centre threequarters; Ding
lev, Lachmund, wings; Bell. full.
