Eating Clubs Laid Over.
Due to the fact that the Advisory
; Hoard of the Alumni Association will
i not make their report on the eating
cluhs until October 9. the Executive
Committee delayed any action on the
question until that time. It is ex
pected that the alumni will offer a
favorable report in regard to the pro
gress in the securing of the eating
clubs, but no definite work can be
done on the plans until after their
report is completed. This indefinite
action on the part of the Executive
Committee is not a withdrawal of
support for any proposition that may
be suggested, but merely a necessary
move awaiting further developments.
Eliminations Begun.
Of the sixteen men originally try
ing-out. for the position of asistant
yell-leader, the Executive Committee
deemed that the straw vote taken
on the bleachers at Saturday's game
and again yesterday, indicate that the
rooters' choice is limited to five men.
The votes on these five far outbalanc
ed all competitors for the places. The
men are: L. S. Mann, '11, C. H. Shat
tuck, '12, P. P. Ward. '12, W. S. Wil
son. '13, and H. R. Spence. '13. Final
voting on the candidates will be held
at the next Saturday and Wednesday
games. The choice will be made at
the meeting of the Executive Com
mittee next Wednesday night.
S!h>» Chairman Appointed.
Believing that the work of staging
the annual football show on the even
ing of November 11, could better be

accomplished if a man was appointed
who was cognizant with all details of
such a preformance, rather than leav
ing the entire work to the Executive
Committee members, ,T. H. Forbes, '13,
was made chairman of the sub-com
mittee appointed one week ago.
Forbes is ably suited to conduct all
the details of putting on an accept
able football show. His work in con
nection with his original opera, "The
Uvernian Princess," staged last sem
ester as the Junior opera, makes him
especially fitted for such a task. S. C.
Kennedy, '12, who was first appointed
as chairman of the show committee,
resigned because of his yell-leading
and rally duties at the time of the
I fig Game.
Soccer 1<» be' Aided.
In accordance with the plan adopted
last year to recognize soccer, in so
far as giving it the support of the
Student Body is concerned, Professor
R. R. Long, of the Hygiene Depart
ment, spoke last evening and asked
that this support be continued. Last
season the soccer team was enrolled
in the soccer league, and it was neces
sary, in order to complete the sched
ule, that trips be made to San Fran
cisco and other points where soccer
was played. Professor Long asked
that $15 per trip be allowed the team,
with a total of fifteen trips contem
plated, bringing thp entire appropria
tion to $22. r >. It was decided to lay
the matter over for one week.
Lasker to Visit Campus.
At the present time Dr. Emmanuel
Lasker, chess champion of the world,
is traveling across the continent play
ing exhibition games. This trip is
attracting a great deal of interest from
the devotees of chess. In order that
it might be possible to bring Dr. Las
ker to the campus during his stay in
San Francisco, the Chess Club asked
that $10 be given them to add to a
fund already started for that purpose.
The request was granted.
Vacancies Filled.
The vacancies in the Board of Con
trol made by the graduation of G. A.
Ditz, Ml, and the failure of J. E.
Thompson, ex-'ll, to return to college,
made it necessary for the Executive
Committee to name new members in
their places. K. L. Schaupp, '12, and
T. L. Coleman, '12, were appointed to
the positions.
Papers Sent lo llitrli Schools.
Last year the Student Body inau
gurated the custom of sending copies
of tlie Daily Palo Alto to the leading
high schools of the State in the hopes
of increasing the general high school
interest in Stanford. This custom, by
the action taken last evening, will be
continued this year. About seventy
five papers will be sent out every day
with the same arrangement with the
management of the Daily Palo Alto
as to cost as was made in 1910.
Kennedy Takes Hats.
It has been the custom in the past
to give the head yell-leader charge of
the securing and sale of rooters' hats.
This plan will be followed this year.
S. C. Kennedy, '12, will handle them
for the Student Body.
