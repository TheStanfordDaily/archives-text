# Elect Men Not Figureheads.
## 
### 
Elections to the University Confer
ence have been announced for next
Wednesday. Men eligible to vote will

understand the
true importance of
this organization.
They will see the

necessity of getting only the most
representative men in the Conference,
—those who are well in touch with
topics usually considered to be a
source of trouble on the campus,
whether between students, or between
faculty and students.
Elect men and not figureheads—
men who will do some sensible, delib
erate thinking and not merely repre
sent their particular group of sup
porters, whether those supporters be
members of clubs, fraternities or dor
mitories.
* * * *
The announcement of elections such
as these are usually followed by the
worst type of narrow-mindedness.
Factions among the students of all
classes see here an opportunity of
getting "their man" in, to have a
representative. The real meaning of
the Conference and its right to the
best men and straight thinking, is
lost sight of. Votes are bartered and
support traded as though this most
efficient mouthpiece of the students
—the Conference —were some sqrt of
a social gathering, where each polit
ical group on the campus might have
a representative.
The electors next Wednesday will
be practically all upperclassmen.
These men know through experience
the evils of the game of selling votes.
* * * *
Now for once let us forget that we
are members of any faction whatso
ever. and remember that we are mem
bers of the University, to look out for
what will be its good. Vote for the
right man among the names posted
on the department bulletin boards.
Elect him, if you believe in his ability,
whether he is roommate or brother,
or whether he supported you in Ihe
last election. Forget these details.
