# FENCERS OF TWO UNIVERSITIES MAY MEET
## FOIL AND MASK PLANS TOURNAMENT WITH CALIFORNIA. Athletic Committee is Requested to Place Sport on Intercollegiate Basis This Year. 
### 
It the Faculty Athletic Committee
of the University grants the request
of the Foil and Mask Club and places
fencing on an intercollegiate basis,
the women students of Stanford and
California will meet shortly in two
matches, one to be held here and the
other at Berkeley. A meeting of the
club was held last evening at Itoble
Gym. Much interest was displayed
by the members in the affairs of the
young organization. The secretary
was instructed to enter a request
that intercollegiate fencing matches
be allowed.
The action was taken last evening
as the result of the declaration of the
University of California Athletic Com
mittee to make fencing an intercol
legiate sport for women.
Should representatives of the fenc
ing clubs of the two universities meet,
Stanford bids fair to make an excel
lent showing, as among the local
women students are several proficient
with the foil and mask. Director
H. W. Maloney, of Encina Gymnasium,
who is acting as coach to the fencing
enthusiasts, is jubilant over the pros
pects, and declares he is positive an
excellent team of fencers can be picked
from the women of Stanford.
At the proposed meeting of repre
sentatives of the two universities,
both individual and team matches oc
cur. Teams of three members will be
picked and open competition will also
be held. It, is probable the first meet
ing will be held in Berkeley about the
middle of the semester, and the se
cond at Stanford shortly before the
holiday vacation.
The meeting last night was largely
attended, there being over twenty-five
in attendance. Four new members
were elected to membership. A coni
mitte consisting of Miss R. M. Ben
nett, '12, Miss C. Cook, and A. Taylor,
'11, was appointed to select the de
signs and secure pins for the members.
Following the business session last
night all the members, divided into
two teams, under the leadership of Mr.
Maloney and Mr. Howard, held a
"Round Robin," which resulted in a
draw.
In the future the meetings of the
Foil and Mask will be held in Roble
Gym every second Wednesday.
