"It is gratifying to know that the University of California Glee Club
has made such a fine record in Eu-rope. This may lead to the discarding of
of a few professors of .the science and arts and the substitution of some
high-class instructors of ragtime at the university. Glee-clubbing is much
easier to learn than the dead languages and the sciences. Why not enroll
all the students in the Glee Club and discard all the excess education?"â€”
"San Francisco Post."
