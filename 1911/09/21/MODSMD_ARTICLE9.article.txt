# ROUTINE PRACTICE ROUNDS SQUAD INTO GOOD FORM.
## Names of Reeves, Ramesay and King on Injured List of Rugby Players. 
### 
Hard and earnest routine practice
on the auxiliary field is the order of
the day for Varsity and Freshman
rugby aspirants, every afternoon when
a game is not scheduled for the turf.
Coach Presley takes the difficult task
of instilling the mysteries of scrum
work into the Freshman forwards,
while J. O. Miller, '08, succeeds Dole
in charge of the Varsity forwards.
A. E. Roth, '09, drills the Varsity backs
and Captain Erb the Freshman backs.
Presley, Erb, Miller, and Dole form
a quintet of field coaches difficult to
equal.
Coach Presley has not as yet made
any cut in the squad, but a few of the
original number of aspirants have
dropped out, either because of lack of
time or slight injuries. This leaves
the squad much less unwieldy. Of
the injured ones, King, the Senior
back, Ramesay, the Freshman, and the
veteran Reeves, are still on crutches.
King has blood poisoning as the result
of an injury sustained in practice last,
week. The injury to Reeves' knee is
proving more serious than was at first
anticipated. No definite date can be
set when he will be able to return to
the game. Ramesay, the promising
young Freshman from Palo Alto High
School has a sprained ankle.
