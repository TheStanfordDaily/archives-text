# "WORLD AND HIS WIFE" TICKETS ON SALE MONDAY
## One of the Best Plays Stanford Has Seen, To Hold Boards Friday.—Seats at Bookstore and at Weingartner's. 
### 
Seats for "The World and His Wife,"
one of the most interesting plays that
has ever been presented at Stanford,
will go on sale Monday morning at the
Stanford Bookstore and at Weingart
ner's Pharmacy in Palo Alto. To say
that "The World and His Wife" is
the best play that has ever been pre
sented here is no exaggeration.
Coach Mathieu says that it is the best.
Those who are in the play and have
been in plays in Stanford during every
semester of the present college gen
eration. say that it is the best. And
those who understand the ins and outs
of playwriting and acting say that the
drama is one of the best plays ever
presented anywhere.
"The World and His Wife" is a play
that a million people have seen and
enjoyed. When it is presented, one
week from tonight, September 29, the
number who have seen and enjoyed it
will have been increased to one million
and a thousand.
It is certain that all who see the
play will enjoy it. It is equally certain
that those who fail to see it will re
gret it. Saturday morning, if the pre
dictions of Coach Mathieu are realiz
ed, the entire college will be talking
"The World and His Wife."
In the twenty odd plays which have
been given at Stanford since the pres
ent Senior class were Freshmen, none
can compare in the slightest degree
with this play for true interest; for
tremendous gripping dramatic situa
tions; or for lasting impressions on
the audience. Those who see the pre
sentation will never forget it.
When William Faversham and his
wife, Juile Op]), played this piece for
a year's run in New York, and, late,
for a year on the road, they were met
with unqualified success everywhere.
All pronounced the play as the sea
son's one best offering. As it was the

best play of the season when it was
presented by professional players so
will it be the best play in Stanford's
long line of successful dramatic
presentations.
"The World and His "Wife" deals
with a group of people high up in
Spanish governmental circles. The
time is the present. It is the old story
of husband, wife, and friend—"the
usual and universal three." Problem
plays—so called—are almost invari
ably built 011 this ancient topic of the
domestic triangle. Nirdlinger, in his
play, however, has given an altogether
new and different picture of this
group. Instead of presupposing or
bringing some unpleasant and guilty
intrigue into the play and building
around that, he takes the same con
ditions, establishes the absolute in
nocence of all the parties and then
goes on to show how gossip among
scandal loving outsiders, even when
directed at these innocent parties, can
lead up to consequences almost as
terrible as any that could be conceived.
Duels, misunderstandings, and even
worse things result. And yet, when
the play is over, and the final curtain
has fallen, the audience believes in
the characters; respects them; and
leaves the theatre with a pleasant
taste of things well done. Although
there is a decided note of tragedy in
the play, the ending is so sublimely
idealized and is so perfect in all its
details that one forgets the tragedy
in the fierce, exultant joy which per
vades the final scene.
Never in the history of things dra
matic at Stanford has the equal of
"The World and His Wife," as a play,
been attempted, and never will a Stan
ford audience be so seriously satisfied
as will the one which leaves the
Assembly Hall on the evening of
September 29.

terrible as any that could be conceived.
Duels, misunderstandings, and even
worse things result. And yet, when
the play is over, and the final curtain
has fallen, the audience believes in
the characters; respects them; and
leaves the theatre with a pleasant
taste of things well done. Although
there is a decided note of tragedy in
the play, the ending is so sublimely
idealized and is so perfect in all its
details that one forgets the tragedy
in the fierce, exultant joy which per
vades the final scene.
Never in the history of things dra
matic at Stanford has the equal of
"The World and His Wife," as a play,
been attempted, and never will a Stan
ford audience be so seriously satisfied
as will the one which leaves the
Assembly Hall on the evening of
September 29.


The I'siinl ami Universal Three.
Seats for "The World and His Wife,"
one of the most interesting plays that
has ever been presented at Stanford,
will go on sale Monday morning at the
Stanford Bookstore and at Weingart
ner's Pharmacy in Palo Alto. To say
that "The World and His Wife" is
the best play that has ever been pre
sented here is no exaggeration.
Coach Mathieu says that it is the best.
Those who are in the play and have
been in plays in Stanford during every
semester of the present college gen
eration. say that it is the best. And
those who understand the ins and outs
of playwriting and acting say that the
drama is one of the best plays ever
presented anywhere.
"The World and His Wife" is a play
that a million people have seen and
enjoyed. When it is presented, one
week from tonight, September 29, the
number who have seen and enjoyed it
will have been increased to one million
and a thousand.
It is certain that all who see the
play will enjoy it. It is equally certain
that those who fail to see it will re
gret it. Saturday morning, if the pre
dictions of Coach Mathieu are realiz
ed, the entire college will be talking
"The World and His Wife."
In the twenty odd plays which have
been given at Stanford since the pres
ent Senior class were Freshmen, none
can compare in the slightest degree
with this play for true interest; for
tremendous gripping dramatic situa
tions; or for lasting impressions on
the audience. Those who see the pre
sentation will never forget it.
When William Faversham and his
wife, Juile Op]), played this piece for
a year's run in New York, and, late,
for a year on the road, they were met
with unqualified success everywhere.
All pronounced the play as the sea
son's one best offering. As it was the

best play of the season when it was
presented by professional players so
will it be the best play in Stanford's
long line of successful dramatic
presentations.
"The World and His "Wife" deals
with a group of people high up in
Spanish governmental circles. The
time is the present. It is the old story
of husband, wife, and friend—"the
usual and universal three." Problem
plays—so called—are almost invari
ably built 011 this ancient topic of the
domestic triangle. Nirdlinger, in his
play, however, has given an altogether
new and different picture of this
group. Instead of presupposing or
bringing some unpleasant and guilty
intrigue into the play and building
around that, he takes the same con
ditions, establishes the absolute in
nocence of all the parties and then
goes on to show how gossip among
scandal loving outsiders, even when
directed at these innocent parties, can
lead up to consequences almost as
terrible as any that could be conceived.
Duels, misunderstandings, and even
worse things result. And yet, when
