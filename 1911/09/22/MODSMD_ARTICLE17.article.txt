True loyalty is that seen in the
strict observance of training rules.
To see, night after night, men who

are candidates for athletic
teams give up their pleas
ures and work to follow the
commands of the coach and

to assure themselves the best possible
condition is a fine sight. Many men
observe these rules absolutely and
it has been the reputation of Stanford
that this ig" so. We should be proud
of the men who obey.
