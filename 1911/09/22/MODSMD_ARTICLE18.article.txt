# More Posters Taken.

What a narrow, mean mind any in
dividual must have who will deliber
ately steal an expensive and artistic

poster from Quad win
dows. We see no pos
sible excuse for it,
and the person who

makes use of such methods for his own
advantage must be of a peculiar make
up, indeed. A large photograph pos
ter, costing several dollars, has been
removed from a casement, as a repe
tition of the disappearance of several
dozen printed advertising cards a day
or so ago. Apparently there is no
appeal that will act as a check upon
anyone of such a disposition.
