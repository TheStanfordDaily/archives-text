# NO SQUAD CUT FOR FIRST TIME IN YEARS
## ALL FOOTBALL MEN TO CONTINUE ON LISTS. Players Will be Given EVery Possible Opportunity to Show Their Rugby Ability. 
### 
For the first time in years no cut
will lie made in the Cardinal football
squad. All men will be kept on the
lists and will be given every possible
chance to show their worth. All will
have plenty of opportunity to learn
the game, and no men will be released.
The bulky squad is to be divided into
two groups. The Varsity, under Coach
Presley, will practice on Stanford
Field. The second group consisting
of Freshmen and those who are not
on the Varsity squad, will have the
auxiliary turf field for their use, with
A. E .Roth as their coach.
This scheme will permit Coach
Presley to devote more of his
time to the veterans and to those
men who show Varsity class, fn the
past the coach has been handicapped
by having too many men to give his
personal attention to, but now he can
devote his time to putting the fine
touches on the Varsity machine. At
the same time no men will be dropped
to accomplish this easing of the coach,
and the general participation in ath
letics so much desired will be nearer
attainment.
A regular schedule of games will be
secured for the second group men,
consisting, as mentioned above, of
players not on the first Varsity or
Freshman fifteens. In these games
they will have the chance to distin
guish themselves under the eyes of
their coach. Should they show ability
unknown before they will be put into
the Varsity group, to show their mettle
when lining tip against the veterans.
Thus, the new plan will keep in active
athletic exercise the greatest number
of met thruout the season. It will
also accomplish a no less important
purpose of making possible a greater
Varsity by having a greater group of
hardened men from which to pick.
The main objection to athletics that
has lieen broached is, that in college
it is only the few who can participate
in them. The new plan of Coach Pres
ley answers that objection, and allows
all who wish to play on a Cardinal
rugby squad to receive the coaching
of a competent man. Even though the
player has had no previous experi
ence in the game he has ample oppor
tunities now to get started right and to
make the Varsity thru hard work.
This idea conforms with the state
ment made by Doctor Angell at the
rally which opened the season this
fall, when he told about the different
conditions prevailing in the university
across the bay, where there is twice
as large a student body as at Stanford.

with no probation rule; that to meet
them in the long run the Cardinal
must have a great turnout of men,
which enn lie developed into rugby
players.
The first step in the change was
inaugurated yesterday afternoon on
the turf field. Coach Presley, who has
previously hud the Freshman forwards
under his wing, turned them over to
.1. O. Miller, 'nfl. The veteran coach
put the Varsity forwards thru their
paces. Captain Erb will have the old
men under his charge hereafter, and
A. E. Roth will take the Freshmen
backs.

fall, when he told about the different
conditions prevailing in the university
across the bay, where there is twice
as large a student body as at Stanford.

with no probation rule; that to meet
them in the long run the Cardinal
must have a great turnout of men,
which enn lie developed into rugby
players.
The first step in the change was
inaugurated yesterday afternoon on
the turf field. Coach Presley, who has
previously hud the Freshman forwards
under his wing, turned them over to
.1. O. Miller, 'nfl. The veteran coach
put the Varsity forwards thru their
paces. Captain Erb will have the old
men under his charge hereafter, and
A. E. Roth will take the Freshmen
backs.
For the first time in years no cut
will lie made in the Cardinal football
squad. All men will be kept on the
lists and will be given every possible
chance to show their worth. All will
have plenty of opportunity to learn
the game, and no men will be released.
The bulky squad is to be divided into
two groups. The Varsity, under Coach
Presley, will practice on Stanford
Field. The second group consisting
of Freshmen and those who are not
on the Varsity squad, will have the
auxiliary turf field for their use, with
A. E .Roth as their coach.
This scheme will permit Coach
Presley to devote more of his
time to the veterans and to those
men who show Varsity class, fn the
past the coach has been handicapped
by having too many men to give his
personal attention to, but now he can
devote his time to putting the fine
touches on the Varsity machine. At
the same time no men will be dropped
to accomplish this easing of the coach,
and the general participation in ath
letics so much desired will be nearer
attainment.
A regular schedule of games will be
secured for the second group men,
consisting, as mentioned above, of
players not on the first Varsity or
Freshman fifteens. In these games
they will have the chance to distin
guish themselves under the eyes of
their coach. Should they show ability
unknown before they will be put into
the Varsity group, to show their mettle
when lining tip against the veterans.
Thus, the new plan will keep in active
athletic exercise the greatest number
of met thruout the season. It will
also accomplish a no less important
purpose of making possible a greater
Varsity by having a greater group of
hardened men from which to pick.
The main objection to athletics that
has lieen broached is, that in college
it is only the few who can participate
in them. The new plan of Coach Pres
ley answers that objection, and allows
all who wish to play on a Cardinal
rugby squad to receive the coaching
of a competent man. Even though the
player has had no previous experi
ence in the game he has ample oppor
tunities now to get started right and to
make the Varsity thru hard work.
This idea conforms with the state
ment made by Doctor Angell at the
rally which opened the season this
fall, when he told about the different
conditions prevailing in the university
across the bay, where there is twice
as large a student body as at Stanford.
