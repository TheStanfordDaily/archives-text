# THIRD VARSITY TO PLAY PACIFIC TEAM TOMORROW.
## Game For Squad Men Arranged. Freshmen May Have Match October 18. 
### 
Stanford rugby teams will probably
be seen in action in at least two games
as additions to the schedule. The
first of these set-tos has been defi
nitely decided upon, and will take
place tomorrow, when the third Var
sity men will journey to College Park,
at San Jose, and meet the pigskin
followers of the University of the Pa
cific. This team has been coached
during the season by Markwart, for
ward of last year's California Var
sity, and should be able to defend its
goal line against too many visitations
from the Cardinal scrubs. The game
will lie in progress at the time that
the first string men are trying con
clusions with the winged-0 on Stan
ford Field.
An interesting change will prob
ably also be made in the Freshman
schedule. The effect of this will be
to extend the playing dates of the
team about a week longer than was
originally planned. Another gaim
wlth the Berkeley High School com
bination will probably be the final
match, on October IS. The schedule
will not be extended longer than this,
however, in order that it may not in
terfere with the concentration of
attention upon the Varsity.
