# OKAYS AND BLACKS IN SCRUMMAGE PRACTICE.
## Given Twenty Minutes of Hard Play on Turf by Couch Presley Yesterday. 
### 
For the first time this season, two
teams of Varsity rugby candidates
were seen in action against each other
011 the turf field yesterday afternoon.
Coach Presley lined up the "Grays"
and "Blacks," and the resulting score
alter two ten-minute halves read 19-0
with the "Grays" on the long end.
The winning aggregation showed more
finished work in every department of
the game, and kept the Blacks 011 the
defensive for the entire time with the
exception of three short periods when
their own goal was threatened.
Soon after the kick-off Erb was
awarded a placement from the Blacks'
—but failed. After (! minutes of play
Kern took the ball after a dribbling
and passing rush and scored. Erb
failed 011 the conversion. A 30-yard
dash by Frank brought the next Gray
try, and Brown converted. Other
additions to the score were made by
Brown's awarded placement from 25,
and by a pass from Gard to Brown
which followed a 50-yard passing rush.
The attempt at conversion was again
unsuccessful. In the second half a
passing rush, Gard to Dooling, brought
a 2-yard scrum, and Gard was sent
across; Brown added the extra two
points.
Substitutes were used freely during
the second halt' of this game. After
wards, the third and fourth team men
