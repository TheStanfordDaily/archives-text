# WORLD'S CHAMPION CHESS PLAYER TO COME HERE.
## Dr. Lasker Will Give Addresses and Exhibitions.â€”Details for Fall Tournament Arranged. 
### 
Dr. Emanuel Lasker, World's Chess
champion, will return to this country
in October. He proposes then to make
a short tour giving addresses on Chess,
accompanied by exhibitions. The chess
club has been fortunate in having Dr.
Lasker consent to come to the campus
during his stay in San Francisco. He
will give an address upon the "Platonic
Idea of Chess," and afterwards will
proceed against about twenty "boards"
of the game.
These matches are to begin October
15, in Encina Hall. The public will be
invited and a position secured where
all may see the champion. Dr. Las
ker is to have his expenses paid for
the trip from contributions from mem
bers of the faculty, the Student Body,
and the Chess Club.
At a recent meeting of the club the
details for the annual Fall Tourna
ment for novices were arranged.
Among the entries received are E.R.
Nusbaum, H. A. Fore, Z. Osterling,
and L. L. Tfiorasen. All desiring to
enter the Fall Tournament must pre
sent their names to H. A. Hackett, 16
Alvarado, by October 1.
