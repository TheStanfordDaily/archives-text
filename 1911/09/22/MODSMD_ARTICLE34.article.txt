# GYM CLUB PLANS DANCE TO SECURE EQUIPMENT.
## Organization Decides to Raise Needed Funds by Benefit Dance After Big Game. 
### 
The Gym Club, at its meeting last
night in Encina Gymnasium, decided
to give a dance this semester. The
proceeds will be used in buying
needed equipment.
Last semester the Gym Club secured
the Armory, and from the proceeds of
that dance were able to purchase a
seventy-dollar mat. In giving outside
exhibitions, certain equipment is es
sential, and the members hope to ob
tain it this way. The dance will
probably be given soon after the Big
Game.
There will be several new men taken
in this semester, but the names have
not yet been announced. The Club
has promised to give one or two cam
pus exhibitions this year, showing
just what they have accomplished in
the gymnastic line. Hereafter a short
business meeting will be held each
Thursday evening. It will be followed
by a general practice.
