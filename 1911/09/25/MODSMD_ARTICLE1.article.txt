# NEW VARSITY DIAMOND READY IN ONE WEEK
## BASEBALL PRACTICE TO BEGIN SOON. Constructor-In-Chief McDonald Has Overcome Sun Bugbear In Mapping Ideal Field. 
### 
The new baseball diamond will be
ready for use one week from today,
and fall practice will begin as soon
thereafter as is practicable. Gradu
ate Manager Burbank gave assurance
today that the diamond would be in
condition for fast work on that. date.
In order that the fall turnout of the
baseball men may not he further de
layed, the work of the last week wil
lie centred on the diamond itself. The
turf will not be set until later. Con
struction of bleachers to seat sixteen
hundred will be started as soon as the
more difficult work of putting the dia
mond in the best condition is com
pleted.
The Student Body owes much to S.
McDonald for his services as foreman
of construction of the new ball field.
McDonald has practically assumed the
position of contractor for the student
body. He has been constructor-ln
chief, and has other official titles that
go with hard work.
The work of finishing the diamond
has been carried on deliberately for
the reason that the field may be first
class in every particular. McDonald
has taken special care that the dia
mond itself be graded in the best pos
sible manner that it. may drain prop
erly. It has been this delicate work
in connection with accurate grading
and packing of base-lines that has de
layed the field's completion.
The lines, plate and pitcher's box
have also been laid with more care
than usually is exercised, that the
diamond may be permanent. Much ex
pense has been saved the student body
through the services of McDonald.
The field itself is almost ideal, in
that it is so laid out that the players
will not have to face the sun. Here
tofore this feature has been the bug
bear of those whose task it has been
to lay out diamonds.
The location of the sun at different
seasons of the year brings its rays
onto the diamond at a different angle
almost every week. This objection
lias been mimimized in the new field,
which is set a few points off of the
compass. The pitcher faces north
west. The left fielder is probably the
only player who will receive unwel
come attention from Old Sol, and he
only on occasion.
Captain (Jilfillan will announce the
first practice in a few days, when the
men will sign up for work.
