We take the greatest pleasure in
advancing to Associate Editorship,
Henry Lawrence Loud, '13, of Pomona.
Loud has given his time and efforts
unsparingly with other members of the
staff, in spite of the unusual amoivn*
of time required because of the in
creased size of the Daily Palo Alto.
We wish to emphasize a few details
in the singing of "Hail, Stanford, Hail"
on the football field, that have been
forgotten this year, or that were never
fully understood by every-
Forgotten one. While the students
Details. in the bleachers are rev
erntly singing the Stan
ford hymn, with bared heads, foot
bulls and antics are mingled in seem
ing derision down on the field. Dur
ing tlie minute or so of the singing it
has been the custom in former years
for all present, whether players or
spectators, to stop whatever they are
doing, and join in showing reverence
to the University. When the game is
over and the hymn is to be sung,
bleachers and players should have the
same thought and purpose.
