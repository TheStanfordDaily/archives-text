During the last semester, a few wo

Woman's Civic Forum, and elected
Miss B. Rible, gr., president, and Miss

mote parliamentary law and topics of
current interest. The club will have
regular monthly meetings. The first
one of this semester will occur in
October. At this meeting the pending
arbitration treaties between the Uni

be discussed.
