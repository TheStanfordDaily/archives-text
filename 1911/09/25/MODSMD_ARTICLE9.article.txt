# BROWN HELPS DEFEAT STRONG OLYMPICS BY FIELD GOAL
## Varsity Overcomes Winged "O" Team by Hard Fighting—Many Injuries—First Freshmen Win—Second Freshmen Lose. Varsity, 19; Olympics 0. First Freshmen, 39; Mission, 3. Second Freshmen, 3: Palo Alto, 27.

With twenty-nine men on all sides !
of him in a particularly sharp skir
mish on the forty-yard line in the
Olympic game Saturday, Brown, at
center, catching up the ball, with
barely enough turf space from which
to drop a punt, sent the pigskin
squarely between the goal-posts, one
of the most difficult and seldom suc
cesful plays from that distance in
football, American or rugby.
Brown's four points came in the se
cond half, to make the total for the
Varsity 14. One try following his
score, and a conversion, made the com
plete tally for the game, 19, the Olym
pics being unable to make an impres
sion on the score-board.

Winged-"0" contest, left, the First

Olympics Have Stanford Men.
The Winged "O" had nine former
Stanford men on their lineup. They
were McGregor, Miller, Sundell, Fit
ting, Tallant, Sundell, McCrearv, Lau
meister and Decius.
The game was fast from the time
that Referee Fuller's whistle started
off the contest until the gun stopped
the play at the end of the second
thirty minute half. Never have the
Olympics brought such a fast aggre
jgation to the campus. The visitors
used the seven man scrum and broke

about even with the powerful eight
man forward formation of the Car
dinal. J. O. Miller, as the Clubmen's
wing forward and captain, was prom
inent at all times during the battle.
He was responsible in putting tbe
damper on several Varsity rushes in
embryo. Miller is undoubtedly one of
the best wing forwards that the game
has produced in this country.
For work in the rough the Olympics
excelled, but the Cardinals proved
their excellence by ready knowledge
of the science of rugby, and when to
use it. Never has a Stanford team
showed such skill in such an early
season game,
lirown and Erfo Score.
Brown played up to great form, ex
celling in kicking and passing. In all,
Brown added ten of Stanford's 19
points to the game, four for his field
goal and six for his three conversions
of the trio of tries that fefl to the Car
dinal's share. Captain Erb played well
in his alternated positions of full and
center.
Risling was under fire in a Varsity
line up for the first time. Although
in the game as first five for only a few
minutes before a slight injury with
drew him, he gave promise of further
Varsity appearances. Risling is the
first. Freshman that Coach Presley has
added to the Varsity squad.
Next to Miller, Fletcher, a former
fullback on Nevada's fifteen, shared
the afternoon's honors for the visitors.
Whenever the ball shot, thru the de
fence he was there to secure it and
return it with interest to a lineout.
During the last period frequent
changes were made in the Stanford
lineup. Even the recognized star vet
erans were sent to the side lines,
showing that new men will be given
more of a chance to make a bid for
a Varsity place and that even the
veterans will have to work up to par
thruout the entire season if they are
to keep their positions on the team.
The game brought forth more than
its usual quota of injuries of a minor
nature. Cass was carried from the
field with what was thought to be a
serious injury. Later examination,
however, proved his hurt to be slight,
and the veteran half will be in togs
again in two or three days. Risling
has the same diagnosis. Decius had
a tendon torn in his elbow and will
be forced to rest for two or three
weeks.
(ieissler Scores.
After ten minutes of play Stanford
was wading in to the Olympics terri
tory when Lunt and Fletcher turned
them back to midfield by passing and
dribbling. There Kern secured. Ho
cross-kicked to Geissler, waiting at
2, r >, who shot across. Brown converted.
Score, Stanford, 5; Olympics, 0.
In the loose, following a lineout at
the visitors 10, Cass picked up, passed
to Harrigan, Gard, Brown, and sent
(Jeissler across. Brown converted.
Score, Stanford, 10; Olympics, 0.
To open the second half Brown add
ed four with a field goal from about
the forty yard line.. Tbe score sheets
were closed when Schaupp took the
ball from a quick line-out at the Wing
ed "O's" 10 and tore thru for a try.
Brown again converted. Final score,
Stanford, 19; Olympics, 0.
A. K. Roth held the whistle during
the two Freshmen games. In the
Varsity-Olympic struggle W. p Ful

Freshmen—Mission High.
With tlie whistle the Freshmen be
gan to force the Missioners into defen
sive work and the rest of the game saw
them fighting for ground, never able
to drive the light back to the Car
dinal's side. The one exception was a
star performance during the closing
minutes of the second period, and be
fore the Freshmen could force matters
again the game was over.
The Freshmen gave a splendid ex
bition of the game and most all of
their moves were successfully carried
to a conclusion. Mission was out
classed. The pace set by 191 r» was
too hot for the city lads and these
cond half saw the visitors vainly try
ing to stem the onrushing tide by con
stant boots to touch. For five minutes
this method was successful. Then the
Frosh began to tally tries for the next
fifteen minutes. The last five minutes
gave the Missioners their lone tally,
by a show of spirit not evidenced be
fore.
Waymire, Mission's first five, was
practically their only back who was
able to secure the ball. He put up
a good defense with snappy touch
finding boots.
The Freshman pack played strong,
both in their own department and in
participating in passing rushes. Wines,
Haley, and Dutton, were prominent.
Haley has a powerful boot that would
suggest backfield calibre.
Clark Proves Converter.
The backfield lacked the impetus of
Risling, the first graduate of the in
coming class to the Varsity squad.
Clark was first used as a converter in
this contest, and proved to be a find,
netting ten points. Erb is steadily
coining into the first ranks of rugby
dom. Saturday he showed his heels
to the entire Mission line-up when he
secured the ball at his own 45 and,
unassisted, sped across midfield, dodg
ed their fullback and with the Mission
ers following far back in his wake, laid
the ball beneath their goalposts.
The Freshman's first tally was made
nearly five minutes of hard rushing.
The ball was given to a three yard
scrum. A pass down the route, Clark,
Erb, Ross, sent Templeton across.
Score, 101"), 3; Mission, 0.
The last five minutes the visitors
took charge. Stafford and Waymire
in a passing rush from 19ir>'s 40,
tallied. Final score. Freshmen, 39,
Mission, 3.
Second Freshmen —Palo Alto.
Hitherto untried, and playing to
gether for the first time as a rugby
unit, the second Freshmen met defeat
at the hands of the local high school
players by the score of 27 to 3. Even
when the score was piling up against
them the second Freshmen played the
game for all that was in them.

Risling was under fire in a Varsity
line up for the first time. Although
in the game as first five for only a few
minutes before a slight injury with
drew him, he gave promise of further
Varsity appearances. Risling is the
first. Freshman that Coach Presley has
added to the Varsity squad.
Next to Miller, Fletcher, a former
fullback on Nevada's fifteen, shared
the afternoon's honors for the visitors.
Whenever the ball shot, thru the de
fence he was there to secure it and
return it with interest to a lineout.
During the last period frequent
changes were made in the Stanford
lineup. Even the recognized star vet
erans were sent to the side lines,
showing that new men will be given
more of a chance to make a bid for
a Varsity place and that even the
veterans will have to work up to par
thruout the entire season if they are
to keep their positions on the team.
The game brought forth more than
its usual quota of injuries of a minor
nature. Cass was carried from the
field with what was thought to be a
serious injury. Later examination,
however, proved his hurt to be slight,
and the veteran half will be in togs
again in two or three days. Risling
has the same diagnosis. Decius had
a tendon torn in his elbow and will
be forced to rest for two or three
weeks.

Freshmen—Mission High.
With tlie whistle the Freshmen be
gan to force the Missioners into defen
sive work and the rest of the game saw
them fighting for ground, never able
to drive the light back to the Car
dinal's side. The one exception was a
star performance during the closing
minutes of the second period, and be
fore the Freshmen could force matters
again the game was over.
The Freshmen gave a splendid ex
bition of the game and most all of
their moves were successfully carried
to a conclusion. Mission was out
classed. The pace set by 191 r» was
too hot for the city lads and these
cond half saw the visitors vainly try
ing to stem the onrushing tide by con
stant boots to touch. For five minutes
this method was successful. Then the
Frosh began to tally tries for the next
fifteen minutes. The last five minutes
gave the Missioners their lone tally,
by a show of spirit not evidenced be
fore.
Waymire, Mission's first five, was
practically their only back who was
able to secure the ball. He put up
a good defense with snappy touch
finding boots.
The Freshman pack played strong,
both in their own department and in
participating in passing rushes. Wines,
Haley, and Dutton, were prominent.
Haley has a powerful boot that would
suggest backfield calibre.
Clark Proves Converter.
The backfield lacked the impetus of
Risling, the first graduate of the in
coming class to the Varsity squad.
Clark was first used as a converter in
this contest, and proved to be a find,
netting ten points. Erb is steadily
coining into the first ranks of rugby
dom. Saturday he showed his heels
to the entire Mission line-up when he
secured the ball at his own 45 and,
unassisted, sped across midfield, dodg
ed their fullback and with the Mission
ers following far back in his wake, laid
the ball beneath their goalposts.
The Freshman's first tally was made
nearly five minutes of hard rushing.
The ball was given to a three yard
scrum. A pass down the route, Clark,
Erb, Ross, sent Templeton across.
Score, 101"), 3; Mission, 0.
The last five minutes the visitors
took charge. Stafford and Waymire
in a passing rush from 19ir>'s 40,
tallied. Final score. Freshmen, 39,

Second Freshmen —Palo Alto.
Hitherto untried, and playing to

The game was fast from the time
that Referee Fuller's whistle started
off the contest until the gun stopped
the play at the end of the second
thirty minute half. Never have the
Olympics brought such a fast aggre
jgation to the campus. The visitors
used the seven man scrum and broke

about even with the powerful eight
man forward formation of the Car
dinal. J. O. Miller, as the Clubmen's
wing forward and captain, was prom
inent at all times during the battle.
He was responsible in putting tbe
damper on several Varsity rushes in
embryo. Miller is undoubtedly one of
the best wing forwards that the game
has produced in this country.
For work in the rough the Olympics
excelled, but the Cardinals proved
their excellence by ready knowledge
of the science of rugby, and when to
use it. Never has a Stanford team
showed such skill in such an early
season game,

Brown played up to great form, ex

Brown added ten of Stanford's 19

minutes of the second period, and be
fore the Freshmen could force matters
again the game was over.
The Freshmen gave a splendid ex
bition of the game and most all of
their moves were successfully carried
to a conclusion. Mission was out
classed. The pace set by 191 r» was
too hot for the city lads and these
cond half saw the visitors vainly try
ing to stem the onrushing tide by con
stant boots to touch. For five minutes
this method was successful. Then the
Frosh began to tally tries for the next
fifteen minutes. The last five minutes
gave the Missioners their lone tally,
by a show of spirit not evidenced be
fore.
Waymire, Mission's first five, was
practically their only back who was
able to secure the ball. He put up
a good defense with snappy touch
finding boots.
The Freshman pack played strong,
both in their own department and in
participating in passing rushes. Wines,
Haley, and Dutton, were prominent.
Haley has a powerful boot that would
suggest backfield calibre.
Clark Proves Converter.
The backfield lacked the impetus of
Risling, the first graduate of the in
coming class to the Varsity squad.
Clark was first used as a converter in
this contest, and proved to be a find,
netting ten points. Erb is steadily
coining into the first ranks of rugby
dom. Saturday he showed his heels
to the entire Mission line-up when he
secured the ball at his own 45 and,
unassisted, sped across midfield, dodg
ed their fullback and with the Mission
ers following far back in his wake, laid
the ball beneath their goalposts.
The Freshman's first tally was made
nearly five minutes of hard rushing.
The ball was given to a three yard
scrum. A pass down the route, Clark,
Erb, Ross, sent Templeton across.
Score, 101"), 3; Mission, 0.
The last five minutes the visitors
took charge. Stafford and Waymire
in a passing rush from 19ir>'s 40,
tallied. Final score. Freshmen, 39,

Second Freshmen —Palo Alto.
Hitherto untried, and playing to
gether for the first time as a rugby

when the score was piling up against

With twenty-nine men on all sides !

Olympic game Saturday, Brown, at
center, catching up the ball, with
barely enough turf space from which
to drop a punt, sent the pigskin
squarely between the goal-posts, one
of the most difficult and seldom suc
cesful plays from that distance in
football, American or rugby.
Brown's four points came in the se
cond half, to make the total for the
Varsity 14. One try following his

Olympics Have Stanford Men.
The Winged "O" had nine former
Stanford men on their lineup. They
were McGregor, Miller, Sundell, Fit
ting, Tallant, Sundell, McCrearv, Lau
meister and Decius.
The game was fast from the time
that Referee Fuller's whistle started
off the contest until the gun stopped
the play at the end of the second
thirty minute half. Never have the
Olympics brought such a fast aggre
jgation to the campus. The visitors
used the seven man scrum and broke

about even with the powerful eight
man forward formation of the Car
dinal. J. O. Miller, as the Clubmen's
wing forward and captain, was prom
inent at all times during the battle.
He was responsible in putting tbe
damper on several Varsity rushes in
embryo. Miller is undoubtedly one of
the best wing forwards that the game
has produced in this country.
For work in the rough the Olympics
excelled, but the Cardinals proved
their excellence by ready knowledge
of the science of rugby, and when to
use it. Never has a Stanford team
showed such skill in such an early
season game,
lirown and Erfo Score.
Brown played up to great form, ex
celling in kicking and passing. In all,
Brown added ten of Stanford's 19
points to the game, four for his field
goal and six for his three conversions
of the trio of tries that fefl to the Car
dinal's share. Captain Erb played well
in his alternated positions of full and
center.
Risling was under fire in a Varsity
line up for the first time. Although
in the game as first five for only a few
minutes before a slight injury with
drew him, he gave promise of further
Varsity appearances. Risling is the
first. Freshman that Coach Presley has
added to the Varsity squad.
Next to Miller, Fletcher, a former
fullback on Nevada's fifteen, shared
the afternoon's honors for the visitors.
Whenever the ball shot, thru the de
fence he was there to secure it and
return it with interest to a lineout.
During the last period frequent
changes were made in the Stanford
lineup. Even the recognized star vet
erans were sent to the side lines,
showing that new men will be given
more of a chance to make a bid for
a Varsity place and that even the
veterans will have to work up to par
thruout the entire season if they are
to keep their positions on the team.
The game brought forth more than
its usual quota of injuries of a minor
nature. Cass was carried from the
field with what was thought to be a
serious injury. Later examination,
however, proved his hurt to be slight,
and the veteran half will be in togs
again in two or three days. Risling
has the same diagnosis. Decius had
a tendon torn in his elbow and will
be forced to rest for two or three
weeks.

was wading in to the Olympics terri

them back to midfield by passing and

With twenty-nine men on all sides !
of him in a particularly sharp skir
mish on the forty-yard line in the
Olympic game Saturday, Brown, at
center, catching up the ball, with
barely enough turf space from which
to drop a punt, sent the pigskin
squarely between the goal-posts, one
of the most difficult and seldom suc
cesful plays from that distance in
football, American or rugby.
Brown's four points came in the se
cond half, to make the total for the
Varsity 14. One try following his
score, and a conversion, made the com
plete tally for the game, 19, the Olym
pics being unable to make an impres
sion on the score-board.

Olympics Have Stanford Men.
The Winged "O" had nine former
Stanford men on their lineup. They
were McGregor, Miller, Sundell, Fit
ting, Tallant, Sundell, McCrearv, Lau
meister and Decius.
The game was fast from the time
that Referee Fuller's whistle started
off the contest until the gun stopped
the play at the end of the second
thirty minute half. Never have the
Olympics brought such a fast aggre
jgation to the campus. The visitors
used the seven man scrum and broke

about even with the powerful eight
man forward formation of the Car
dinal. J. O. Miller, as the Clubmen's
wing forward and captain, was prom
inent at all times during the battle.
He was responsible in putting tbe
damper on several Varsity rushes in
embryo. Miller is undoubtedly one of
the best wing forwards that the game
has produced in this country.
For work in the rough the Olympics
excelled, but the Cardinals proved
their excellence by ready knowledge
of the science of rugby, and when to
use it. Never has a Stanford team
showed such skill in such an early
season game,
lirown and Erfo Score.
Brown played up to great form, ex
celling in kicking and passing. In all,
Brown added ten of Stanford's 19
points to the game, four for his field
goal and six for his three conversions
of the trio of tries that fefl to the Car
dinal's share. Captain Erb played well
in his alternated positions of full and
center.
Risling was under fire in a Varsity
line up for the first time. Although
in the game as first five for only a few
minutes before a slight injury with
drew him, he gave promise of further
Varsity appearances. Risling is the
first. Freshman that Coach Presley has
added to the Varsity squad.
Next to Miller, Fletcher, a former
fullback on Nevada's fifteen, shared
the afternoon's honors for the visitors.
Whenever the ball shot, thru the de
fence he was there to secure it and
return it with interest to a lineout.
During the last period frequent
changes were made in the Stanford
lineup. Even the recognized star vet
erans were sent to the side lines,
showing that new men will be given
more of a chance to make a bid for
a Varsity place and that even the
veterans will have to work up to par
thruout the entire season if they are
to keep their positions on the team.
The game brought forth more than
its usual quota of injuries of a minor
nature. Cass was carried from the
field with what was thought to be a
serious injury. Later examination,
however, proved his hurt to be slight,
and the veteran half will be in togs
again in two or three days. Risling
has the same diagnosis. Decius had
a tendon torn in his elbow and will
be forced to rest for two or three
weeks.
(ieissler Scores.
After ten minutes of play Stanford
was wading in to the Olympics terri
tory when Lunt and Fletcher turned
them back to midfield by passing and
dribbling. There Kern secured. Ho
cross-kicked to Geissler, waiting at
2, r >, who shot across. Brown converted.
Score, Stanford, 5; Olympics, 0.
In the loose, following a lineout at
the visitors 10, Cass picked up, passed
to Harrigan, Gard, Brown, and sent
(Jeissler across. Brown converted.
Score, Stanford, 10; Olympics, 0.
To open the second half Brown add
ed four with a field goal from about
the forty yard line.. Tbe score sheets
were closed when Schaupp took the
ball from a quick line-out at the Wing
ed "O's" 10 and tore thru for a try.
Brown again converted. Final score,
Stanford, 19; Olympics, 0.
A. K. Roth held the whistle during
the two Freshmen games. In the
Varsity-Olympic struggle W. p Ful
ler, '10, refereed the match.
Freshmen—Mission High.
With tlie whistle the Freshmen be
gan to force the Missioners into defen
sive work and the rest of the game saw
them fighting for ground, never able
to drive the light back to the Car
dinal's side. The one exception was a
star performance during the closing
minutes of the second period, and be
fore the Freshmen could force matters
again the game was over.
The Freshmen gave a splendid ex
bition of the game and most all of
their moves were successfully carried
to a conclusion. Mission was out
classed. The pace set by 191 r» was
too hot for the city lads and these
cond half saw the visitors vainly try
ing to stem the onrushing tide by con
stant boots to touch. For five minutes
this method was successful. Then the
Frosh began to tally tries for the next
fifteen minutes. The last five minutes
gave the Missioners their lone tally,
by a show of spirit not evidenced be
fore.
Waymire, Mission's first five, was
practically their only back who was
able to secure the ball. He put up
a good defense with snappy touch
finding boots.
The Freshman pack played strong,
both in their own department and in
participating in passing rushes. Wines,
Haley, and Dutton, were prominent.
Haley has a powerful boot that would
suggest backfield calibre.
Clark Proves Converter.
The backfield lacked the impetus of
Risling, the first graduate of the in
coming class to the Varsity squad.
Clark was first used as a converter in
this contest, and proved to be a find,
netting ten points. Erb is steadily
coining into the first ranks of rugby
dom. Saturday he showed his heels
to the entire Mission line-up when he
secured the ball at his own 45 and,
unassisted, sped across midfield, dodg
ed their fullback and with the Mission
ers following far back in his wake, laid
the ball beneath their goalposts.
The Freshman's first tally was made
nearly five minutes of hard rushing.
The ball was given to a three yard
scrum. A pass down the route, Clark,
Erb, Ross, sent Templeton across.
Score, 101"), 3; Mission, 0.
The last five minutes the visitors
took charge. Stafford and Waymire
in a passing rush from 19ir>'s 40,
tallied. Final score. Freshmen, 39,
Mission, 3.
Second Freshmen —Palo Alto.
Hitherto untried, and playing to
gether for the first time as a rugby
unit, the second Freshmen met defeat
at the hands of the local high school
players by the score of 27 to 3. Even
when the score was piling up against
them the second Freshmen played the
game for all that was in them.
1915's lone tally was made early in
the second half.
