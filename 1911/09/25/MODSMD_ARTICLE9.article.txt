### 
With twenty-nine men on all sides !
of him in a particularly sharp skir
mish on the forty-yard line in the
Olympic game Saturday, Brown, at
center, catching up the ball, with
barely enough turf space from which
to drop a punt, sent the pigskin
squarely between the goal-posts, one
of the most difficult and seldom suc
cesful plays from that distance in
football, American or rugby.
Brown's four points came in the se
cond half, to make the total for the
Varsity 14. One try following his
score, and a conversion, made the com
plete tally for the game, 19, the Olym
pics being unable to make an impres
sion on the score-board.

Winged-"0" contest, left, the First
Freshmen victors over Mission High,

Second Freshmen.
Olympics Have Stanford Men.
The Winged "O" had nine former
Stanford men on their lineup. They
were McGregor, Miller, Sundell, Fit
ting, Tallant, Sundell, McCrearv, Lau
meister and Decius.
The game was fast from the time
that Referee Fuller's whistle started
off the contest until the gun stopped
the play at the end of the second
thirty minute half. Never have the
Olympics brought such a fast aggre
jgation to the campus. The visitors
used the seven man scrum and broke

about even with the powerful eight
man forward formation of the Car
dinal. J. O. Miller, as the Clubmen's
wing forward and captain, was prom
inent at all times during the battle.
He was responsible in putting tbe
damper on several Varsity rushes in
embryo. Miller is undoubtedly one of
the best wing forwards that the game
has produced in this country.
For work in the rough the Olympics
excelled, but the Cardinals proved
their excellence by ready knowledge
of the science of rugby, and when to
use it. Never has a Stanford team
showed such skill in such an early
season game,
lirown and Erfo Score.
Brown played up to great form, ex
celling in kicking and passing. In all,
Brown added ten of Stanford's 19
points to the game, four for his field
goal and six for his three conversions
of the trio of tries that fefl to the Car
dinal's share. Captain Erb played well
in his alternated positions of full and
center.
Risling was under fire in a Varsity
line up for the first time. Although
in the game as first five for only a few
minutes before a slight injury with
drew him, he gave promise of further
Varsity appearances. Risling is the
first. Freshman that Coach Presley has
added to the Varsity squad.
Next to Miller, Fletcher, a former
fullback on Nevada's fifteen, shared
the afternoon's honors for the visitors.
Whenever the ball shot, thru the de
fence he was there to secure it and
return it with interest to a lineout.
During the last period frequent
changes were made in the Stanford
lineup. Even the recognized star vet
erans were sent to the side lines,
showing that new men will be given
more of a chance to make a bid for
a Varsity place and that even the
veterans will have to work up to par
thruout the entire season if they are
to keep their positions on the team.
The game brought forth more than
its usual quota of injuries of a minor
nature. Cass was carried from the
field with what was thought to be a
serious injury. Later examination,
however, proved his hurt to be slight,
and the veteran half will be in togs
again in two or three days. Risling
has the same diagnosis. Decius had
a tendon torn in his elbow and will
be forced to rest for two or three
weeks.
