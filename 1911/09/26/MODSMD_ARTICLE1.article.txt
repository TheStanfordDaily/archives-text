# ENGLISH CLUB TRYOUTS BEGIN SATURDAY
## LINES OF CHARACTERS WILL BE PRINTED. Committee of Throe Will Have Charge of Coaching Professor Gray's Play, "Compromise." 
### 
Tryouts for Professor H. D. Gray's
play, "Compromise," to be given by
the English Club on November 24, will
be held during Saturday morning, Sep
tember 30, beginning at nine o'clock,
in room 231 of the English Bulding.
These tryouts are open to all students
of the University, subject to the regu
lation that no student may appear in
more than one production during one
semester.
A pamphlet has been printed con
taining a synopsis of the play and
scenes, introducing all of the charac
ters with enough of their lines to give
an indication of each part. The pam
phlets may be secured by all interested
in trying out for the parts, either from
Professor Gray or from any member
of the committee, including Miss M.
Driscoll, .Miss (!. Workman, .Miss D.
Parkinson, G. C. Ingelow, and L. C.
Pickering. Those wishing to enter
the tryouts may obtain the pamphlets
on Thursday, when they will be
ready for distribution. They will lie
given until Saturday morning to pre
pare the lines.
One scene included in the selections
printed brings in practically all of the
characters, and it has been suggested
that this might be read by a number
of persons, assuming the various roles,
a method which would give the judges
a better idea of the abilities of each
contestant. Professor Gray, Profes
sor L. E. Bassett and Miss G. Work
man, who has been secured to assist
with the coaching, will conduct the
tryouts. The Committee is looking
for a large number of students who
will try for the parts.
The pamphlet containing the selec
tions for the tryouts is an attractive
publication of several pages, giving an
outline of the plot, a complete cast
of characters, place and time of the
action, and passages chosen with a
view to revealing the characters of
the persons of the play. "Compromise"
is a drama of modern life, dealing
wth a striking political situation, and
the denouement is unusual enough to
satisfy the most critical audience.
The roles offer many opportunities
for excellent acting and the lines lend
themselves well to reading.
A number of students have already
signified their intention of trying for
the parts and il is expected that many
more will appear at the hour set.
A sufficiently large number of the
pamphlets will be printed to insure
plenty for distribution.
