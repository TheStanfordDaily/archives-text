# MISSION COLLEGIANS MEET 1915 TOMORROW
## CLOSE, SCRAPPY CONTEST FOR MID-WEEK SET-TO. Santa Clara Fifteen, Flashed With Success Over California Freshmen, Ready For Cardinals. 
### 
Santa Clara's group of rugby play
ers will line up against the Freshman
fifteen tomorrow afternoon on Stan
ford Field at 4:45. The team from the
Mission town comes here fresh from
their victory over the lllue and (Jold
babies of last Saturday, in which they
found little difficulty in disposing of
California's novice line-up. The final
score of the game was - 13 to 3, the
trans-bay Frosh slipping in their lone
tally when the second period was half
gone. Furthermore, the California
Freshmen seemed unable to put tip
any effectual defense.
Tomorrow the Mission Collegians
will find an unusually well-balanced
Freshman unit, the veterans of three
games and the undisputed victors in
each case. To defeat them the visitors
will have a hard proposition on their
hands. From the way that the new
men are playing another Freshman
victory will be expected by the Car
dinal rooters.
No change is to be made in the
Freshman backfieid and the same line
up that went into action against the
Mission High fifteen on Saturday will
again be listed for the game. The loss
of Risling, promoted to the Varsity
squad, was not so apparent on Satur
day as it will be tomorrow against
such strong opponents as Santa Clara.
Hut the material ready to wear his
shoes will give good account of them
selves.
The usual admission of twenty-five
cents will be charged. Season tickets
will be on sale at the gates, which ad
mit to this game and the remaining
games of the season, excluding only
those with the British Columbia team
and the Intercollegiate. The Faculty
may secure tickets, as well as students.
