The Basketball season will open
Thursday, when old players and new
aspirants will sign up at Roble gym
nasium. Although the match games
will be played early next semester, the
fall season has been inaugurated to
develop team work and coach new
players who have no knowledge of
the game. Miss M. Cleveland, in
structor in Physical Training, assisted
by Miss B. Whelan, '12, Captain-Elect,
will coach both the class teams and
the beginners.
Every girl in the University, whether
or not she has any knowledge of the
game, is urged to sign up for the fall
semester, so that the two months'
training required for eligibility, can be
disposed of before the interclass series
begins. Owing to the introduction of
hockey, this sport will be given the
preference this semester, Tuesdays.
Wednesdays and Fridays being de
voted to it, while Basketball practice
games will take place on Monday and
Thursday afternoons.
A large number of the 1912 class
team who won the Tournament cup
last year, are now in college, and in
tend to play in the fall practice games.

Misses B. Whelan, captain, R. Overman,
R. Seeley, B. Van Zwalenberg, L. Si
monds, I). Alderton, M. Graham, R.
Ryerson, and F. Swift. In addition,
the large number of players from
the 1913 and 1914 teams make the
basketball outlook exceptionally prom
ising.
Intercollegiate relations with Cali
fornia are still suspended, but sched
ules will probably be arranged with
various club teams in San Francisco.
