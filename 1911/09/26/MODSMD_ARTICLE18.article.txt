# The 						Conference Election.
## 
### 
The Daily Palo Alto has today taken
up two columns of space to give the
list of eligible voters in the Con
ference elections tomorrow afternoon.

The personnel of
last year's Confer
ence is also printed.
We do this with

the desire to have every eligible voter
in the University know the men who
can be elected, and to let him know the
caliber of the members in 1910-11.
It is necessary that all votes be
registered tomorrow, and that a clear
headed and deliberate conference be
selected. The results of such an elec
tion can not be measured today. One
year from now we will know what
grade of men were chosen. Let us
see that we do not regret our choice.
