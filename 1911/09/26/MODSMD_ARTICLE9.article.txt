Following the long-established policy
| of the University authorities of engag-
I ing the most prominent men of the
| cloth of California to occup the Chapel
I pulpit at various times during the col
lege year, the University Chaplain, Dr.
D. Charles Gardner, has secured eight
j ministers with state-wide reputations
to address the students during the
â–  present semester. These eminent di
vines are more or less known to the
I Stanford public, as many of them have
j visited the Campus before. These men
j are representatives of various denom
i illations and are the leaders in their
| respective churches. Most of them are
from the Bay cities.
Among those best remembered here
are Rev. C. F. Aked, Congregationalist,
late pastor of the Fifth Avenue Bap
tist Church of New York City, who
spoke on "Abraham Lincoln" at one
j of last, semester's brilliant assemblies.
| Bishop Hughes, of the Methodist
church, who preached the Baccalaure
ate sermon in 1909 and spoke in the
Chapel last semester; Bishop Nicholas
of the Episcopal church; Rabbi Meyer
of the Hebrew Synagogue, San Fran
cisco, and Rev. A. W. Palmer, of Oak
land, a Congregationalist. The other
speakers who will address the stu
dents are Rev. B. Leavitt, Unitarian,
Rev. G. E. Burlingame, Baptist, and
Rev. Robert Freeman, Presbyterian.
Dr. Gardner will preach on alternate
Sundays, one of the above ministers
taking charge of the service on Sun
j days given over to outside preachers.
