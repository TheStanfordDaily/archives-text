# COMBINED MUSICAL CLUBS ACCEPT NEW CONSTITUTION
## Thanksgiving Trip Off Campus Is Planned, Together With Several Week-end Journeys. Main Points of Agreement Given 
### 
As tlie first step in their endeavor
to form u closer organization, the
members of the Combined Musical
Clubs have drawn up a new constitu
tion. It will supersede the one in
force, and will he the instrument un
der which the musical clubs will be
directed from now on. C. H. Hayes,
'12, is president of the clubs.
The prospect of several trips in the
near future have given added enthu
siasm to the work of the .Mandolin and
CI lee Clubs. Concert trips to Mills
College and San Mateo are almost a
certainty while the idea of a big con
cert in San Francisco is being looked
into, it has been several years since
the club performed in the metropolis.
A Thanksgiving recess trip is also
under consideration.
The main features of the Constitu
tion are as follows:
Art. lll.—The Executive functions
of the Executive Committee shall be
confined to matters related only to
the Combined Clubs as a unit. It is
intended that the functions of the two
clubs in themselves shall he separate
and distinct from each other in every
detail.
Sec. I.—li is intended that the Com
mittee will ,in its decisions, voice the

sentnient of the two clubs thru their
representatives on said Committee.
This method will facilitate business
coftiing before the Clubs and should
accurately voice the sentiment of said
Clubs.
Art. V. —Elections of Officers of the
Combined Clubs shc'ill be held at the
beginning of the first semester of each
Academic year. In the event of re
signation or failure to return to the
University special elections may be

Club officers a majority of votes shall
elect.

bined Clubs is given the power to call
a meeting of the Combined Clubs by
request of any five members of either
or both clubs, and on his own initia
tive.

fore either club and concerning that
club alone shall be decided by said
club alone according to the constitu
tion adopted by aforesaid club.
Art. VII.—In journeys away from
the University the two clubs will tra
vel as a unit and the executive power
on these trips shall be in the hands of
the Executive Committee of the Com
bined Cluln,.
