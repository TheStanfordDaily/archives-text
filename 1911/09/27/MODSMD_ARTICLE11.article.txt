# WOMEN SHOW INTEREST IN CLUB HOUSE.
## One Hundred and Thirty-Five New Pledges Are Made and Paid In Full. 
### 
One hundred and thirty-five new
pledges made and paid in full, and
one thousand four hundred and thirty
eight dollars paid in cash since the
opening of college signify the enthu
siastic interest in the Woman's Club
House campaign. Seven thousand
four hundred and three dollars and
seventy-two cents appears today as
the cash balance on the Treasurer's
books. Amounts due in pledges on
October first would be sufficient to
swell the total to approximately
twelve thousand dollars.
Spurred on by these encouraging
! signs of activity, the Board of Direc
tors are energetically working. "$12,-
500 by October 11" is their motto.
The committee is expecting that more
I of the new women students will catch
; the spirit which has inspired the one
: hundred and thirty-five who have al
; ready paid their share. Pledges and
payments should be sent to Mrs. F. H.
Fowler, the treasurer.
At this time, there has been much
discussion with regard to the pro
per relationship of the Club House
j membership to that of the Women's
League. At the last league meeting
the suggestion was made that, if the
j building is constructed, technically as
well as theoretically, under the aus
pices of the Women's League, its
usefulness and support will be doubly
insured. This being the ultimate aim
of the Board of Directors, plans to
ward this end are being carefully
considered.
Actual building plans are also form
ing in the minds of the Directors,
following the ideas contained in the
prize drawings submitted by Miss L.
Woodhead, '11. and Miss L. Titus. '14,
at the close of last semester. The
coming edition of the Sequoia will
contain a long descriptive article on
the Club House, telling of the attrac
tive features to be included in the
building. Among these are a splendid
music and dancing hall, rest rooms,
small private meeting rooms, nnd
I guest rooms for visiting alumnae.
