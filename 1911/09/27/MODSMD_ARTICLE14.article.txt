Stanford Union money is not coming
in as fast as expected. Parallel to
that statement comes the news that
the Women's Club House has received
one hundred and thirty-five new pled
ges paid in full. Something is wrong
somewhere. Is there a general feel
ing of indifference among the men
students toward the Union, or is the
big Committee appointed ten days ago
at fault? Collecting money for any
purpose is without a doubt one of the
most difficult of occupations and the
object of it must be kept constantly
before the student eve.
The Union will accomplish a splen
did purpose in the life of the Univer
sity students, and we need it. Such
a universal gathering place for stu
dents fills a permanent place at Har
vard and other of the larger eastern
universities.
