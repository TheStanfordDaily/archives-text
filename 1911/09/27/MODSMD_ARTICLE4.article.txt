# VARSITY GRAYS DEFEAT BLACKS ON THE TURF.
## Score of 13-3 Registered, but Consistent Playing Was Not Order of Day. 
### 
Interesting from the standpoint of
the "Meacherite," though rather rag
ged on the part of the Varsity men,
was the set-to between the Grays and
Blacks yesterday afternoon on the
turf. 13 to 3 to the advantage of the
"Grays" appeared as the final score,
hut few of the trys of either team wer ,j
the result of consistent playing. The
Varsity was slightly disorganized by
the trying-out of a few new men on
the line-up.
Almost an entire change of line-up
on both teams was used during these
ootid period. It was during this half
that the lone try of the Blacks was
made, when Rounds secured from a
cross-kick and went forty yards.
\'i interesting feature of the line
up was the retention of Brown at
