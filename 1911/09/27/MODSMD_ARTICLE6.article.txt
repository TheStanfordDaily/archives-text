With a lineup including the veter
ans of other rugby seasons, Santa
Clara College met the Cardinal Fresh
men on Stanford Field this afternoon.
The visitors possessed a husky group
of men who are well versed in (he
fine points of rugby and in how to

ninety. The seven-man scrum was
used by the Mission Collegians with
the breakaways playing at the scrum
corners instead of locked together
behind the middle rankers.
Sims again appeared on the Fresh
men backline, after a week and a
half layoff with injuries.
The Cardinal Freshmen nearly ran

visitors kept 1915 from tallying.

to their backs. They started passing
rushes. By the last two minutes they
had perfected this department of their
Play so as to he able to send the ball
over the Freshmen line for a score.

dered by the Santa Clara onslaught
and after the first few minutes did not
show up to their par style.
