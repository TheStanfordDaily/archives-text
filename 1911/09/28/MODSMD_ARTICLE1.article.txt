# FINAL REHEARSAL HELD OF "WORLD AND HIS WIFE"
## Professional Performance in Acting and Details Assured for Tomorrow Evening—Few Good Seats Left. 
### 
"If 1 was paying two dollars for my
seat and the performance was given
by a standard professional company
I wouldn't ask for or expect a better
presented play than this." Such was
the opinion at the dress rehearsal
last evening of a person well-fitted
to judge of the merits of "The World
and His Wife" which will be given to
morrow night in the Assembly hall.
The little group of privileged persons
who were admitted to the final re
hearsal of the play were unanimous
in their opinions that it was without
doubt the best and strongest play
that has been given at Stanford at
least within the present college gen
eration. Nor were these people lauda
tory merely from a sense of duty.
They came to the rehearsal to criti
cize and discover if possible the weak
points of the play. They found prac
tically none.
After almost a month of continuous
rehearsing "The World and His Wife"
is ready for presentation tomorrow
evening. It is not an easy play to
give, and the actors found many a
snag in each of the three difficult acts.
Each of these has been worked over
again and again and polished and
repolished until now the performance
runs along with the ease of a per
fectly put together bit of mechanism.
Never before have Stanford thes
pians been able to inject into a play
such a sincere professional tone.
Every part has been happily cast and
in every case the players have en
gulfed their own personalities in that
of the part. The usual stiffness that
is found in amateur performances is
entirely lacking in"The World and
His Wife," owing to the long experi
ence and peculiar abilities of the play
ers in dramatc lines.
The play is laid in Spain in strictly
modern times. The Spanish-Ameri
can war is spoken of in one or two
places, it deals with the effects of
the "insidious poison" of unfounded
scandal. Three people, husband, wife,
and friend—the ancient domestic tri
angle—are involved in the gossip.
It leads them on through terrible mis
understandings to an absolute rup
ture of the triangle. Duels and even
a death result. Yet in the end there
is an ideal and uplifting thought that
will carry the big audience out of the
hall thinking of the true meaning of
the play.
In the part of Donna Teodora, "the
wife," Miss G. Workman, '12, will have
the best opportunity of showing her
true merit as an actress of unusual
ability that has ever been given her at
Stanford. Through the entire ation
she retains a certain youthful matu
rity which is so seldom represented
on the stage by amateur actors.
To R. H. Seward, '12, falls the part
of Ernesto, the friend in the triangle.
This is without doubt the most diffi
cult of the male parts to portray. It
is full of a poetic fire and impetuosity,
combined with an inherent manli
ness that makes the audience sym
pathize with the misunderstood Er
nesto from the start.
As the husband, Don Julian. S.
Hrown, '13, has a part which is exact
ly suited to his particular abilities.
He plays the scenes with a rare ap
preciation of the meaning of the part.
In the last act he is especially good
as the dying and unforgiving hus
band.
"The World" is represented in Don
Severe-, played by E. F. Kern. '13.
It is a hard part to make convincing,
but Kern handles it well. He has
devised one of the best make-ups
of the entire play. It alone, almost
without a spoken line, would carry
the character of the man to the au
dience as quickly as many words with
a poor make-up.
ft is Don Severo and his wife. Donna
Mercedes, played by Miss D. Parkin
son. '13, who are the unconscious
causers of all the trouble of the plav.
Miss Parkinson has a splendid part in

Donna Mercedes and she does it de
lightfully, with a certain regal touch
that is at one time pleasing and again
almost "cat-like."
As the wilful, happy, and thought
less Pepito, son of Don Severo, C. S.
Turpin, '13, will make his first Stan
ford appearance in a part of some
seriousness. He is always the dapper
and spontaneous boy whose thought
less tongue makes hearts bitter, and
estranges friends.
To see J. B. Beman, '12, in any but
a laughing comedy role will be a new
experience for a Stanford audience.
Yet, as Captain Bealieu, he will play
such a part tomorrow evening. What
ever fun there is in the play is given
to him it is true, but it is essentiall>
a serious part. Beman shows his ver
satility by the ease with which he
stepped into this new atmosphere.
I. I. Ingraham, '13, will be seen as
Genaro, the master of the house to
which Ernesto goes in his difficulty.
Ingrahani's work in the "Senato.
was extraordinaryly good and his part
in this play, though small, is of the
same nature. He carries it quite as
well.
The part of a servant will be taken
by A. R. McConnell, '14.
A few good seats are still for sale
at the usual prices at the Bookstore
and at Weingartner's pharmacy in
Palo Alto. The unsold seats will be
at the box office on Friday evening
for late purchasers.
