# Stanford Needs Money.
## 
### 
Today conies the news of a decision
on the part of the Board of Trustees
that cannot be entirely estimated,

The long awaited has
come to pass, and a
gift from friends of
the University has

been placed in a trust separate from
the Stanford family endowment. This
means that gifts of money or build
ings will now be received by the Trus
tees and established here under the
name of the donor.
It is believed that when the alumni
and friends of the University not con
nected with it understand that gifts
will not only be accepted but will be
welcomed, and put under their name's,
that Stanford will benefit bj' alumni
endowments in as great a degree,
comparatively, as other American
universities.
Whenever Stanford and the large
endowment of $110,000,000 is mention
ed it is taken for granted by every
one that no more money is needed or
asked. They do not understand the
difficulties in the way of investing
such a large sum in a way to bring
the largest income, nor the fact that
the university is growing continually,
and needs more money each succeed
ing year with which to carry on the
work of education. Moreover, the
University has been set back many
years by the loss in the earthquake.
Since the principal cannot be used,
and interest only, money for improve
ments and re-building is available
only gradually. For that reason the
University asks money, and not only
asks for it, but welcomes it.
