# PLANS PERFECTED FOR GATHERING OF FUNDS.
## Stanford Union Committeemen Will Canvass Palo Alto and Arouse Underclass Enthusiasm. 
### 
Those in charge of the collections
for the Stanford Union announce today
the first moves in the campaign to
complete the gathering of funds pledg
ed to the Union. Two men have been
appointed to canvass Palo Alto as
soon as the "bawl-out" is published
and the names of new students there
are learned. The canvassers are C. H.
Beal, *13, and L. H. Price, '13.
In addition to this meetings of the
two underclasses will be held next
week to arouse enthusiasm over the
Union. The Sophomores will meet on
Tuesday while the 1915 men will hold
their meetings on Wednesday. At
these gatherings Student Adviser A. E.
Roth, Student Body President K. L.
Schaupp, '12, and E. W. Smith. '99,
Permanent Secretary of the Union,
will speak. They will probably ex
plain the purposes of the Union and
will urge underclassmen to pledge
their support.
