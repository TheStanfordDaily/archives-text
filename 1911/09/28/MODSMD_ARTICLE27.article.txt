# HARRIS IS INELIGIBLE FOR THE BIG GAME.
## Clever California Forward Will Not Be Permitted to Play on Varsity Fifteen. 
### 
M. Harris, star forward ot' last
year's University of California Var
sity fifteen, has been declared in
eligible to play in the Intercollegiate
big game in November. The retire
ment of the clever breakaway forward
comes as a result of an investigation
into his standing by the Berkeley
faculty committee on athletics, of
which Professor E. O'Neill is chair
man.
Harris is a duly registered student
at the university but he does not at
tend classes often enough to be
classified as a student within the
meaning of the intercollegiate agree
ment. He was late in registering,
having played with the Olympic club
on September 16, and immediately
after the contest enrolled as a stu
dent so as to be within the 2f> day
rule.
Harris is also a star baseball player
having been a member of professional
nines since his graduation last Mav.
