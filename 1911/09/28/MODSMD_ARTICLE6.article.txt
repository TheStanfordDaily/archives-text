### 
Making a decided innovation in pol
icy, the Trustees of the University
today made known the acceptance of
a $10,000 endowment from Dr. A.
Barkan, of San Francisco, Professor
Emeritus of the Department of Medi
cine. This is the first endowment for
the upkeep of any department of the
University received from sources oth
er than the Stanford family.
The gift of $10,000 will set aside
as a trust fund and its income used
according to Dr. Barkan's wishes, in
the maintenance of a special library
for the Eye and Ear Department of
the Medical School.
The following resolution of ac
ceptance was passed by the Board of
Trustees:

"RESOLVED, That the gift of Dr.
Barkan, Professor Emeritus of the
Department of Medicine, of $10,000
for the endowment of " a special de
partment of the medical library for
ophthalmology, otology and the cog
nate sciences, about one-half of the
income to be expended in the pur
chase of publications and periodicals,
the balance to be used for the pur
chase of encyclopaedic works, works
of reference, text books, atlases, etc.,
etc., lie accepted, and that in accord

American universities which are will
ing to accept contributions for scien
tific pursuits. Last year the Alumni

expected that the present attitude of
the University Trustees will result in
a great increase of gifts to be added
to the Stanford funds.
Dr. Barkan, the donor of the new
department trust, has for years been
one of the prominent physicians of
the coast, having a national name as
a specialist on diseases of the eye,

been given with the proviso that its
income be used for a series of lec
tures on religous topics.

the thanks of this Board be extended
to Dr. Barkan for this most munificent
and generous addition to the funds

of the medical library, and that the
Secretary be requested to communi

Balkan."
The acceptance of this gift brings
Stanford into the ranks of the great
American universities which are will
ing to accept contributions for scien
tific pursuits. Last year the Alumni
Association started a movement to
collect a fund of $250,000 which will
be available for use in 1921, and it is
expected that the present attitude of
the University Trustees will result in
a great increase of gifts to be added
to the Stanford funds.
Dr. Barkan, the donor of the new
department trust, has for years been
one of the prominent physicians of
the coast, having a national name as
a specialist on diseases of the eye,
ear and throat.
Charles G. Lathrop, Treasurer of.
the University, has also donated
$5,000 for the general purpose of the
Cooper library, and several other
persons have taken privileges of life
membership in the Library at $100

the largest in the United States con
nected with a medical school, contain
ing 37,500 volumes and 250 period
icals.
Stanford has from time to time re
ceived small donations for the pur
chase of books. One large gift, the
West Foundation Fund of $10,000, has
been given with the proviso that its
income be used for a series of lec
tures on religous topics.
