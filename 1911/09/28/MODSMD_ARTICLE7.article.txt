# JUNIORS MAKING PLANS FOR ANNUAL PLUG UGLY.
## Arrangements Being Made for Posters. Members of Committee Are to Write Play. 
### 
Plans for the annual Plug Ugly
are being made by the committee
appointed by President Frank of the
Junior Class and, from present indica
tions, the coming event bids fair to
outclass all previous affairs of its
nature.
A meeting of the committee was held
last evening and besides the general
discussion, a number of definite plans
were made. A sub-commit tee was
appointed to arrange for the writing,
printing and placing of the posters.
The committee will advertise through
the columns of the Daly Palo Alto
and at the class meetings for contri
butions to the poster. All Juniors
who desire to make suggestions re
garding the poster or make contribu
tions to the literary department of
the affair may send their offerings to
the members of the committee. The
names of the senders are not to be
signed to the contributions.
Contrary to the custom of previous
years, the Juniors will not advertise
for plays. The 1913 Plug Ugly farce
will be written entirely by members
of the committee.
No date has yet been set for the
annual upper-class affair, but it will
probably be held about October 28.
