# UNCONQUERED CARDINAL TEAMS PLAY TOMORROW
## USUAL DOUBLE HEADER WILL BE PLAYED. Barbarians Meet Varsity.—Palo Altans Will Play Freshmen to Replace St. Mary's Date. 
### 
Two different propositions face the
two Cardinal fifteens on the Stanford
Field tomorrow afternoon. The Var
sity will meet the Barbarians who will
prove game fighters but not danger
ous opponents. The Freshmen will play
the fast Palo Alto High School fifteen,
who will prove a formidable enemy.
The Freshman —Palo Alto match is
first on the boards, with the kickoff
at 2:30, and the Varsity play the Bar
barians at 3:30.
An unusually strong defensive game
was played by the Barbarians when
they met the Varsity two weeks ago
for the first set-to with Cardinal group
this season, but the superior work of
the local collegians proved too much
for the visitors, Stanford winning by
the score of 23 to 3. This was the
first time in the Cardinal rugby his
tory that the Barbs were able to go
thru the Stanford defense for a tally.
But six points were registered in the
first period by the Varsity and these
during the fast work with which the
Cardinal opens each game. These
tries were skillfully engineered and
should have scored against any rugby
unit. It was only in the last period
that the city players slackened their
defense before the unceasing attack
and allowed the Cardinals to score.
Tomorrow they will make a showing
that will he worth seeing.
St. Mary's {'liable to Come.
All athletic activities at St. Mary's
have bene postponed for the next week
due to the death yesterday afternoon
of Brother Michael. Immediately on
the receipt of this information Gradu
ate Manager Burbank sought to secure
another team to take the Catholic
Collegians' place and the snappy ball
handlers from Palo Alto were dated
up for the Saturday afternoon game.
Palo Alto will see five of her last
year's stars on the Freshman side in
the scrummage tomorrow. In the for
ward division will be Soper and Wil
son. Ramsay, however, another of
their players in the Cardinal ranks,
is still on ths injured list. In the back
li >e, Thoburn Templeton and Hutch
inson were former strong players on
t'leir team who are now wearers of
the Cardinal colors. B. Risling, who
faced his former fellow team-mates
in the game of a week ago Wednesday,
is now on the Varsity squad.
The big stand-bys of the Varsity
squad will be called upon tomorrow
and the scrum will be almost entirely
changed before the close of the game.
Worswick will play the half posi
tion, replacing Cass now on the in
jured lists. Worswick is a hard player
and will give Cass a hot contest for
his place.
T. Sanborn is the only new face in
the backfield. Sanborn is a strong
player with the veteran strength and
courage of the 1909 Varsity, when lie
played on the backline.
The names of Harrigan, Brown,
Kern, Geissler and Erb fill the back
field slate. Their presence in a Car
dinal lineup insures a great game.
A new combination that has been
tried in the practice lineups this week
will be tried again tomorrow. Brown
will be putin at the full position and
Erb will be advanced to the line as
center threequarters.
