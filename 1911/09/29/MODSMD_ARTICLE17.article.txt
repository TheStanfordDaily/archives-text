# The 						Pan-Hellenic.

### 
Stanford students are on trial again
tomorrow to prove that they are gen
tlemen. men in every sense of the
word and not recent graduates of prep
schools. The "breaking" of the Pan-

Hellenic has been a
problem during every
year of its existence.
Three years ago the

conduct of the students reached the
height of thoughtlessness, and in the
following year the University Confer
ence by hard work was able to reduce
the nuisance in great degree, so that
there was little or no complaint. Last
fall, however, the old custom seemed
in danger of returning, and at the
present time it has seemed necessary
to take as many measures as possible
to prevent any unpleasantness.
The Conference has sent out a let
ter, meetings have been held, and more
are called. Appeal has been made
to the best feelings in the students,
and they have been warned, also, that
some penalty must be paid if a repi
tition of former years is the order of
tomorrow.
There is no doubt that the idea of
this custom on the part of the men is
wrong. Every man who understands
gentlemanly conduct will admit that.
There is. therefore, only one right
course to pursue tomorrow, to per
mit the sorority women to carry on
their plans unmolested and in silence.
Whether this trouble that has arisen
each successive year is entirely the
fault of the men students is another
matter. The fact remains that any
childish conduct is totally out of har
mony with Stanford ideals, and not
becoming true gentlemen, and gentle
men in the sense of "men," and not
"sissies."
