# SIX MEN SELECTED TO ENTER P. A. A. MEET.
## Alderman, Bevier, Horine, Campbell, Dodge and Miller Will Represent Stanford at Berkeley Meet. 
### 
Six men have been chosen by "Dad"
Moulton and track captain T. L. Cole
man, '12, to represent the cardinal
at the annual fall track and field meet,
of the Pacific Association of the Ama
teur Athletic league which will be
held on the Berkeley cinder path on
October 12. Four or five other names
will be added to the Stanford entry
list within the next few days.
The trackmen who have already
been selected are: G. Bevier,
M. W. Alderman, '12, E. P. Campbell,
'13, G. L. Horine, '13, W. J. Dodge, '13,
and.1. A. Miller, '13. Bevier and
Dodge will he entered in the five mile
event. Alderman is to contest in the
weights, discus and javelin throws
Horine will be expected to place in
the high jump. Campbell will probably
enter the sprints, four-forty and
weights. Miller will pole vault.
The entry of the local men in the
five mile grind will be watched with
interest by the cinder-path devotees
as this will be the first time that
Stanford athletes have contested in
races of longer duration than the two
mile event of the intercollegiate
meets. Neither of the cardinal color
bearers have ever participated in the
longer races. Bevier has been a mem
!er of the Varsity track squad with
the two mile as his event. Dodge
placed in several of the lesser meets
of last spring in the half mile.
With the advent of the cross-con n
try club and the interest which is be
ing taken in the long runs of the
organization it is probable that Stan
ford will be represented in several of
the distance contests of the bay city
clubs.
