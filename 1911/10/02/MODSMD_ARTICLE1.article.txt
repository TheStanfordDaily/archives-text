# University Was Twenty Years Old Yesterday
## FIFTH OF A CENTURY HAS SEEN RAPID PROGRESS Momentous Day, October 1, 1891, Found the Eyes of the World Centered on Stanford Educational Experiment. 
### 
Twenty years ago yesterday, Oct
ober 1, 1891, Leland Stanford Junior
University was officially and formally
opened. The dedicatory exercises of
the then completed Inner Quad were
held in the morning of the first regis
tration day, and in the afternoon the
original five hundred and fifty-nine
students filed the first registration
blanks in the office of Registrar O. 1...
Elliott.
It was a momentus occasion. Stan
ford represented a new and daring
idea in educational circles. The eyes
of the scholastic world were directed
here that day. The nation waited the
first words spoken from the univer
sity which represented the most ad
vanced and democratic educational
ideas in a century which had seen al
most a complete revolution in univer
sity ideas and ideals.
Many Doubted Success.
In the minds of many who had
watched the growth and development
of the Stanford plan there was felt a
decided doubt as to the ultimate suc
cess of the undertaking. Men. trained
to know of such things, felt that a
university, without tuition and rely
ing wholly on endowment for revenue,
could not succeed. Others believed
with the optimistic and far-seeing
Stanfords, that the idea had such a
firm and sure foundation that noth
ing could accomplish its failure. It
was with minds doubtful of success
on the most part, that the big as
semblage filed into the Inner Quad
on the morning of October 1, 1891,
for the dedicatory exercises.
The Inner Quad had been specially
prepared for the day. At the west
arch the speaker's platform had been
erected. Stretching away from this
on both sides of the central walk were
the chairs for the ladies of the audi
ence. At eleven In the morning the
speakers mounted to the platform.
The San Francisco "Call" describes
the scene in its issue of October 2, as
follows:
Scene In Inner Quad.
"The platform for the orators of
the day had been erected near the
west entrance to the Quadrangle, and
below in chairs were nearly a thous
and women representing the beauty
and fashion of Central California.
Flags and bunting covered the stand
around which were woven garlands of
flowers, hung with bunches of grapes
and evergreens. Above the Chair
man's seat was hung a large oil paint
ing of the late Leland Stanford Jr.,
and around the frame was twined a
fla*< of silk. Palms and semi-tropical
shrubs and trees contrasted with the
gay gowns and parasols of the ladies."
Fully eight thousand •curious and
interested spectators were crowded in
to the west end of the quadrangle.
Among them were the first of the
student body, whose numbers up to
this time had been a matter of specu
lation and, perhaps, worry on the part
of the university authorities. The
seeds of the Stanford Spirit were
sown that morning, when without
rehearsal or practice, the men of the
university-to-be, gathered in a little
group and surprised the still air of
the Santa Clara valley with the first
Stanford yell.
First Stanford Yell.
"Wah. hoo! Wall, hoo! L. S. J. U.
Stanford, Rah. Rah!", they repeated
three times, and the big audience
cheered vociferously. The doubt in
the minds of the pessimistic had al
ready begun to clear.
The opening exercises of that first
day were in accordance with the fol
lowing program:

Music: "Glory be to God 011 High,

"f desire to state in the few re
marks I am about to make I speak
for Mrs. Stanford, as well as for my
self, for she has been my active and
sympathetic coadjutor and is co
grantor with me in the endowment
and establishment of this University.
Corner-stone Laid 1887.
On the 14th day of May, 1887, the
corner-stone of this quadrangle was
laid, and 011 the first day of October.
1891, we meet to formally throw open
the doors of the institution. Of those
present at the laying of the corner
stone many are hero to-day, but some
of them are with us only in spirit
and in memory.
"for Mrs. Stanford and myself this
ceremony marks an epoch in our lives,
for we see in part the realization of the
hopes and efforts of years; for you.
Faculty and students, the work be
gins now, and it is to commemorate
this commencement of your labors
that we are here assembled.
"We believe that a wise system of
education will develop a future civil
ization as much in advance of that of
the present as ours is in advance of
the condition of the savage. We may
always advance toward the infinite.
"Students of the Leland Stanford
Jr. University, upon the individual

with happiness to yourself and benefit
to humanity. All that we can do for
you is to place, the opportunities with
in your reach; it rests with you to
grasp and improve them. Remember
that life is, above all, practical; that
you are here to fit yourselves for a
useful career; also, that learning
should not only make you wise in the
arts and sciences, but should fully
develop your moral and religious na
tures. The humanizing influences
come from the proper understanding

President Jordan Speaks.
President David Starr Jordan in his
first address as the head of the Univer
sity spoke in part these words;
"We come together today for the
first time as teachers and students.
With this relation the life of the Ice
land Stanford Junior University be
gins. rt is such personal contact of
young men and young women with
scholars and investigators which con
stitutes the life of the University. It
is for us as teachers and students in
the University's first year to lay the
foundations of a school which may
last as long as human civilization.
Ours is the youngest of the Univer
sities, but it is heir to the wisdom of
all the ages, and with this inheritance
it has the promise of a rapid and
sturdy growth.
"Our University has no history to

fall back upon; no memories of great
teachers haunt its corridors; in none
of its rooms appear the traces which
show where a great man has ever
lived or worked. No tender associa
tions cling, ivy-like, to its fresh new
wqlls. It is hallowed by no tradi
tions; it is hampered by none. Its
finger-posts still point forward. Tra
ditions and associations it is ours to
make. From our work the future of
the University will grow as a splendid
lily from a modest bulb.
"We hope to give our students the
priceless legacy of the educated men,
the power of knowing what really is.
The higher education should bring
men into direct contact with the truth.
It should help to free them from the
dead hands of old traditions and to
enable them to form opinions worthy
of the new evidence each new day
brings before them. An educated
man should not be the slave of the
past, not a copy of the men who have
gone before him. He must be in
some degree the founder of a new in
tellectual dynasty, for each thinker
is a new type of man. Whatever is
true is the truest thing in the uni
verse, and mental and moral strength
come alike from our contact with it.
"Thirst After Knowledge."
"I need not recall to you the history
of the foundation of the Leland Stan
ford Junior University. It has its
origin in the shadow of a great sor
row, and its purpose is the wish to
satisfy for the coming generations the
hunger and thirst after knowledge—
that undying curiosity which is the
best gift of God to man. The influ
ence of the boy, to the nobility of
whose short life the Leland Stanford
Junior University is a tribute and
a remembrance, will never be lost in

our country. To him we owe the in
spiration which led the founders to
devote the earnings of the successful
ventures of a busy life to the work of
higher education.
"The Golden Age of California
begins when its gold is used for pur
poses like this. From such deeds
must rise the new California of the
coming century, no longer the Cali
fornia of the gold seeker and the ad
venturer, but the abode of hlgh-mind
ed men and women, trained in the
wisdom of the ages, and imbued with
the love of nature, the love of man,
and the love of God. And bright in
deed will be the future of our State
if, in the usefulness of the University,
every hope and prayer of the founders
shall be realized."
Purpose of Founding.
The original purpose of the Univer
sity as stated in the founding grant
was worded as follows:
"We, Leland Stanford and Jaue La
throp Stanford, husband and wife,
grantors, desiring to promote the pub
lic welfare by founding, endowing,
and having maintained upon our es
tate known as the Palo Alto Farm,
and situated in the Counties of San
Mateo and Santa Clara, State of Cali
fornia, United States of America, a
university for both sexes, with the
colleges, schools, seminaries of learn
ing, mechanical institutes, museums,
galleries of art, and all other things
necessary and appropriate to a uni
versity of high degree, to that end,
and for that purpose, do hereby
grant," etc.
"And that the trust hereby created
may be executed according to the
wishes of the grantors and each of
them, they do hereby designate the
Nature, Object, and Purposes of the
Institution hereby founded to be:
"Its nature, that of a University,
with such seminaries of learning as
shall make it of the highest grade, in
cluding mechanical institutes, muse
ums, galleries of art, laboratories, and
conservatories, together with all
things necessary for the study of agri
culture in all its branches, and for
mechanical training, and the studies
and exercises directed to the culti
vation and enlargement of the mind;
For Usefulness In Life.
"Its object, to qualify students for
personal success and direct useful
ness in life;
"And its purposes, to promote the
public welfare by exercising an influ
ence in behalf of humanity and civil
ization, teaching the blessings of lib
erty regulated by law, and inculcating
love and reverence for the great prin
ciples of government as derived from
the inalienable rights of man to life,
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."
"Since the idea of establishing an
institution of this kind, for the benefit
of mankind, came directly and largely
from our son and only child, Leland,
and in the belief that had he been
spared to advise as to the disposition
of our estate, he would have desired
the devotion of a large portion thereof
to this purpose, we will that for all
time to come the institution hereby
founded shall bear his name, and
shall be known as The Leland Stan
ford Junior University."
With this general idea of a demo
cratic, non-sectarian, and advanced
university, the institution was found
ed. Tt was planned as an eternal
legafcy to the youth of California.
The Government Si^es.
For two years from 1894 to 1896
the life of the University hung in the
balance. The government of the
United States sued the Stanford es
tate as part holder in the original
Central Pacific company for money
which had been loaned to the railroad
company on bonds.
When the project of a transconti
nental road was first broached it was
necessary to secure government aid
to carry through the scheme. A loan
was floated with the government of
$100.000,000. Security on this loan


(Continued on Pape 6)
was given in the shape of an equal
quantity of Central Pacific bonds,
bearing the usual interest.
At" first it appeared that the rail
road was going to be a failure and
the government feafed the loss of the
total loan. They believed that not
only was the loan an entire loss, but
that both the principal and interest on
the huge mass of bonds would never
be paid.
In Probate Court.
This was after the death of Senator
Stanford in 1893 and the estate was
in probate court. This was the only
portion of the original four holdings
in the railroad which the government
could lay hands upon and they
brought suit for a pro rata share of
the debt.
The suit was opened in the United
States Circuit court. While it was
being tried Mr. C. P. Huntington, then
president of the railroad, was in
Washington trying to secure a revo
cation of a portion of the indebted
ness. His attempts failed, but the
first court in which the case was tried

returned a verdict in favor ot' the
University.
The case was appealed and carried
to the next higher court where the
! decision of the lower court was af-
I firmed. Mrs. Stanford, through her
influence, had the court calendar
changed and the case was finally
brought up before the Supreme Court
of the United States in record time.
I'nhersitj »ins Cnsp.
On March 2, ISfMi thie Supreme
Court again supported the judgements
of the lower courts and the govern
ment had lost its suit. The Univer
sity had been saved.
During all this time while the litl
gation lasted the funds of the Uni
versity were tied up. There was not"
even sufficient money with which to
pay the salaries of the Faculty. It
was a period of heroic sacrifices.
During the entire two years, those
men of the Faculty who were loyal
to the University remained at their
posts in spite of financial difficulties
and the uncertainty as to whether the
University would ever again bp able
to liquidate its debts. The Institution,
however, weathered the storm, and
the judgement and loyalty of the
members of the Faculty and the
friends of the University was amply
repaid.
Twenty years ago yesterday, Oct
ober 1, 1891, Leland Stanford Junior
University was officially and formally
opened. The dedicatory exercises of
the then completed Inner Quad were
held in the morning of the first regis
tration day, and in the afternoon the

The original purpose of the Univer

The Government Si^es.
For two years from 1894 to 1896
the life of the University hung in the
balance. The government of the
United States sued the Stanford es

Central Pacific company for money
which had been loaned to the railroad
company on bonds.
When the project of a transconti
nental road was first broached it was
necessary to secure government aid
to carry through the scheme. A loan
was floated with the government of
$100.000,000. Security on this loan


(Continued on Pape 6)
was given in the shape of an equal
quantity of Central Pacific bonds,
bearing the usual interest.
At" first it appeared that the rail
road was going to be a failure and
the government feafed the loss of the
total loan. They believed that not
only was the loan an entire loss, but
that both the principal and interest on
the huge mass of bonds would never
be paid.
In Probate Court.
This was after the death of Senator
Stanford in 1893 and the estate was
in probate court. This was the only
portion of the original four holdings
in the railroad which the government
could lay hands upon and they
brought suit for a pro rata share of
the debt.
The suit was opened in the United
States Circuit court. While it was
being tried Mr. C. P. Huntington, then
president of the railroad, was in
Washington trying to secure a revo
cation of a portion of the indebted
ness. His attempts failed, but the
first court in which the case was tried

returned a verdict in favor ot' the
University.
The case was appealed and carried
to the next higher court where the
! decision of the lower court was af-
I firmed. Mrs. Stanford, through her
influence, had the court calendar
changed and the case was finally
brought up before the Supreme Court
of the United States in record time.
I'nhersitj »ins Cnsp.
On March 2, ISfMi thie Supreme
Court again supported the judgements
of the lower courts and the govern
ment had lost its suit. The Univer
sity had been saved.
During all this time while the litl
gation lasted the funds of the Uni
versity were tied up. There was not"
even sufficient money with which to
pay the salaries of the Faculty. It
was a period of heroic sacrifices.
During the entire two years, those
men of the Faculty who were loyal
to the University remained at their
posts in spite of financial difficulties
and the uncertainty as to whether the
University would ever again bp able
to liquidate its debts. The Institution,
however, weathered the storm, and
the judgement and loyalty of the
members of the Faculty and the
friends of the University was amply
repaid.
Twenty years ago yesterday, Oct
ober 1, 1891, Leland Stanford Junior
University was officially and formally
opened. The dedicatory exercises of
the then completed Inner Quad were
held in the morning of the first regis
tration day, and in the afternoon the
original five hundred and fifty-nine
students filed the first registration
blanks in the office of Registrar O. 1...
Elliott.
It was a momentus occasion. Stan
ford represented a new and daring
idea in educational circles. The eyes
of the scholastic world were directed
here that day. The nation waited the
first words spoken from the univer
sity which represented the most ad
vanced and democratic educational
ideas in a century which had seen al
most a complete revolution in univer
sity ideas and ideals.
Many Doubted Success.
In the minds of many who had
watched the growth and development
of the Stanford plan there was felt a
decided doubt as to the ultimate suc
cess of the undertaking. Men. trained
to know of such things, felt that a
university, without tuition and rely
ing wholly on endowment for revenue,
could not succeed. Others believed
with the optimistic and far-seeing
Stanfords, that the idea had such a
firm and sure foundation that noth
ing could accomplish its failure. It
was with minds doubtful of success
on the most part, that the big as
semblage filed into the Inner Quad
on the morning of October 1, 1891,
for the dedicatory exercises.
The Inner Quad had been specially
prepared for the day. At the west
arch the speaker's platform had been
erected. Stretching away from this
on both sides of the central walk were
the chairs for the ladies of the audi
ence. At eleven In the morning the
speakers mounted to the platform.
The San Francisco "Call" describes
the scene in its issue of October 2, as
follows:
Scene In Inner Quad.
"The platform for the orators of
the day had been erected near the
west entrance to the Quadrangle, and
below in chairs were nearly a thous
and women representing the beauty
and fashion of Central California.
Flags and bunting covered the stand
around which were woven garlands of
flowers, hung with bunches of grapes
and evergreens. Above the Chair
man's seat was hung a large oil paint
ing of the late Leland Stanford Jr.,
and around the frame was twined a
fla*< of silk. Palms and semi-tropical
shrubs and trees contrasted with the
gay gowns and parasols of the ladies."
Fully eight thousand •curious and
interested spectators were crowded in
to the west end of the quadrangle.
Among them were the first of the
student body, whose numbers up to
this time had been a matter of specu
lation and, perhaps, worry on the part
of the university authorities. The
seeds of the Stanford Spirit were
sown that morning, when without
rehearsal or practice, the men of the
university-to-be, gathered in a little
group and surprised the still air of
the Santa Clara valley with the first
Stanford yell.
First Stanford Yell.
"Wah. hoo! Wall, hoo! L. S. J. U.
Stanford, Rah. Rah!", they repeated
three times, and the big audience
cheered vociferously. The doubt in
the minds of the pessimistic had al
ready begun to clear.
The opening exercises of that first
day were in accordance with the fol
lowing program:

in the first address of the day Sen
ator Stanford as founder of the Uni

"f desire to state in the few re
marks I am about to make I speak
for Mrs. Stanford, as well as for my
self, for she has been my active and
sympathetic coadjutor and is co
grantor with me in the endowment
and establishment of this University.
Corner-stone Laid 1887.
On the 14th day of May, 1887, the
corner-stone of this quadrangle was
laid, and 011 the first day of October.
1891, we meet to formally throw open
the doors of the institution. Of those
present at the laying of the corner
stone many are hero to-day, but some
of them are with us only in spirit
and in memory.
"for Mrs. Stanford and myself this
ceremony marks an epoch in our lives,
for we see in part the realization of the
hopes and efforts of years; for you.
Faculty and students, the work be

this commencement of your labors
that we are here assembled.
"We believe that a wise system of
education will develop a future civil
ization as much in advance of that of
the present as ours is in advance of
the condition of the savage. We may
always advance toward the infinite.

you is to place, the opportunities with
in your reach; it rests with you to
grasp and improve them. Remember
that life is, above all, practical; that
you are here to fit yourselves for a
useful career; also, that learning
should not only make you wise in the
arts and sciences, but should fully
develop your moral and religious na

President Jordan Speaks.
President David Starr Jordan in his
first address as the head of the Univer
sity spoke in part these words;
"We come together today for the
first time as teachers and students.
With this relation the life of the Ice
land Stanford Junior University be
gins. rt is such personal contact of
young men and young women with
scholars and investigators which con
stitutes the life of the University. It
is for us as teachers and students in
the University's first year to lay the
foundations of a school which may
last as long as human civilization.
Ours is the youngest of the Univer
sities, but it is heir to the wisdom of
all the ages, and with this inheritance
it has the promise of a rapid and
sturdy growth.
"Our University has no history to

fall back upon; no memories of great
teachers haunt its corridors; in none
of its rooms appear the traces which
show where a great man has ever
lived or worked. No tender associa
tions cling, ivy-like, to its fresh new
wqlls. It is hallowed by no tradi
tions; it is hampered by none. Its
finger-posts still point forward. Tra
ditions and associations it is ours to
make. From our work the future of
the University will grow as a splendid
lily from a modest bulb.
"We hope to give our students the
priceless legacy of the educated men,
the power of knowing what really is.
The higher education should bring
men into direct contact with the truth.
It should help to free them from the
dead hands of old traditions and to
enable them to form opinions worthy
of the new evidence each new day
brings before them. An educated
man should not be the slave of the
past, not a copy of the men who have
gone before him. He must be in
some degree the founder of a new in
tellectual dynasty, for each thinker
is a new type of man. Whatever is
true is the truest thing in the uni
verse, and mental and moral strength
come alike from our contact with it.
"Thirst After Knowledge."
"I need not recall to you the history
of the foundation of the Leland Stan
ford Junior University. It has its
origin in the shadow of a great sor
row, and its purpose is the wish to
satisfy for the coming generations the
hunger and thirst after knowledge—
that undying curiosity which is the
best gift of God to man. The influ
ence of the boy, to the nobility of
whose short life the Leland Stanford
Junior University is a tribute and
a remembrance, will never be lost in

our country. To him we owe the in
spiration which led the founders to
devote the earnings of the successful
ventures of a busy life to the work of
higher education.
"The Golden Age of California
begins when its gold is used for pur
poses like this. From such deeds
must rise the new California of the
coming century, no longer the Cali
fornia of the gold seeker and the ad
venturer, but the abode of hlgh-mind
ed men and women, trained in the
wisdom of the ages, and imbued with
the love of nature, the love of man,
and the love of God. And bright in
deed will be the future of our State
if, in the usefulness of the University,
every hope and prayer of the founders
shall be realized."
Purpose of Founding.
The original purpose of the Univer
sity as stated in the founding grant
was worded as follows:
"We, Leland Stanford and Jaue La
throp Stanford, husband and wife,
grantors, desiring to promote the pub
lic welfare by founding, endowing,
and having maintained upon our es
tate known as the Palo Alto Farm,
and situated in the Counties of San
Mateo and Santa Clara, State of Cali
fornia, United States of America, a
university for both sexes, with the
colleges, schools, seminaries of learn
ing, mechanical institutes, museums,
galleries of art, and all other things
necessary and appropriate to a uni
versity of high degree, to that end,
and for that purpose, do hereby
grant," etc.
"And that the trust hereby created
may be executed according to the
wishes of the grantors and each of
them, they do hereby designate the
Nature, Object, and Purposes of the
Institution hereby founded to be:
"Its nature, that of a University,
with such seminaries of learning as
shall make it of the highest grade, in
cluding mechanical institutes, muse
ums, galleries of art, laboratories, and
conservatories, together with all
things necessary for the study of agri
culture in all its branches, and for
mechanical training, and the studies
and exercises directed to the culti
vation and enlargement of the mind;
For Usefulness In Life.
"Its object, to qualify students for
personal success and direct useful
ness in life;
"And its purposes, to promote the
public welfare by exercising an influ
ence in behalf of humanity and civil
ization, teaching the blessings of lib
erty regulated by law, and inculcating
love and reverence for the great prin
ciples of government as derived from
the inalienable rights of man to life,
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."
"Since the idea of establishing an
institution of this kind, for the benefit
of mankind, came directly and largely
from our son and only child, Leland,
and in the belief that had he been
spared to advise as to the disposition
of our estate, he would have desired
the devotion of a large portion thereof
to this purpose, we will that for all
time to come the institution hereby
founded shall bear his name, and
shall be known as The Leland Stan
ford Junior University."
With this general idea of a demo
cratic, non-sectarian, and advanced
university, the institution was found
ed. Tt was planned as an eternal
legafcy to the youth of California.
The Government Si^es.
For two years from 1894 to 1896
the life of the University hung in the
balance. The government of the
United States sued the Stanford es
tate as part holder in the original
Central Pacific company for money
which had been loaned to the railroad
company on bonds.
When the project of a transconti
nental road was first broached it was
necessary to secure government aid
to carry through the scheme. A loan
was floated with the government of
$100.000,000. Security on this loan


(Continued on Pape 6)
was given in the shape of an equal
quantity of Central Pacific bonds,
bearing the usual interest.
At" first it appeared that the rail
road was going to be a failure and
the government feafed the loss of the
total loan. They believed that not
only was the loan an entire loss, but
that both the principal and interest on
the huge mass of bonds would never
be paid.
In Probate Court.
This was after the death of Senator
Stanford in 1893 and the estate was
in probate court. This was the only
portion of the original four holdings
in the railroad which the government
could lay hands upon and they
brought suit for a pro rata share of
the debt.
The suit was opened in the United
States Circuit court. While it was
being tried Mr. C. P. Huntington, then
president of the railroad, was in
Washington trying to secure a revo
cation of a portion of the indebted
ness. His attempts failed, but the
first court in which the case was tried

returned a verdict in favor ot' the
University.
The case was appealed and carried
to the next higher court where the

I firmed. Mrs. Stanford, through her

brought up before the Supreme Court
of the United States in record time.

university for both sexes, with the
colleges, schools, seminaries of learn
ing, mechanical institutes, museums,
galleries of art, and all other things
necessary and appropriate to a uni
versity of high degree, to that end,
and for that purpose, do hereby
grant," etc.
"And that the trust hereby created
may be executed according to the
wishes of the grantors and each of
them, they do hereby designate the
Nature, Object, and Purposes of the
Institution hereby founded to be:
"Its nature, that of a University,
with such seminaries of learning as
shall make it of the highest grade, in
cluding mechanical institutes, muse
ums, galleries of art, laboratories, and
conservatories, together with all
things necessary for the study of agri
culture in all its branches, and for
mechanical training, and the studies
and exercises directed to the culti
vation and enlargement of the mind;
For Usefulness In Life.
"Its object, to qualify students for
personal success and direct useful
ness in life;
"And its purposes, to promote the
public welfare by exercising an influ
ence in behalf of humanity and civil
ization, teaching the blessings of lib
erty regulated by law, and inculcating
love and reverence for the great prin
ciples of government as derived from
the inalienable rights of man to life,
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."
"Since the idea of establishing an
institution of this kind, for the benefit
of mankind, came directly and largely
from our son and only child, Leland,
and in the belief that had he been
spared to advise as to the disposition
of our estate, he would have desired
the devotion of a large portion thereof
to this purpose, we will that for all
time to come the institution hereby
founded shall bear his name, and
shall be known as The Leland Stan
ford Junior University."
With this general idea of a demo
cratic, non-sectarian, and advanced
university, the institution was found
ed. Tt was planned as an eternal
legafcy to the youth of California.
The Government Si^es.
For two years from 1894 to 1896
the life of the University hung in the
balance. The government of the
United States sued the Stanford es
tate as part holder in the original
Central Pacific company for money
which had been loaned to the railroad
company on bonds.
When the project of a transconti
nental road was first broached it was
necessary to secure government aid
to carry through the scheme. A loan
was floated with the government of
$100.000,000. Security on this loan


(Continued on Pape 6)
was given in the shape of an equal
quantity of Central Pacific bonds,
bearing the usual interest.
At" first it appeared that the rail
road was going to be a failure and
the government feafed the loss of the
total loan. They believed that not
only was the loan an entire loss, but
that both the principal and interest on
the huge mass of bonds would never
be paid.
In Probate Court.
This was after the death of Senator
Stanford in 1893 and the estate was
in probate court. This was the only
portion of the original four holdings
in the railroad which the government
could lay hands upon and they
brought suit for a pro rata share of
the debt.
The suit was opened in the United
States Circuit court. While it was
being tried Mr. C. P. Huntington, then
president of the railroad, was in
Washington trying to secure a revo
cation of a portion of the indebted
ness. His attempts failed, but the
first court in which the case was tried

returned a verdict in favor ot' the
University.
The case was appealed and carried
to the next higher court where the
! decision of the lower court was af-
I firmed. Mrs. Stanford, through her
influence, had the court calendar
changed and the case was finally
brought up before the Supreme Court
of the United States in record time.
I'nhersitj »ins Cnsp.
On March 2, ISfMi thie Supreme
Court again supported the judgements
of the lower courts and the govern
ment had lost its suit. The Univer
sity had been saved.
During all this time while the litl
gation lasted the funds of the Uni
versity were tied up. There was not"
even sufficient money with which to
pay the salaries of the Faculty. It
was a period of heroic sacrifices.
During the entire two years, those
men of the Faculty who were loyal
to the University remained at their
posts in spite of financial difficulties
and the uncertainty as to whether the
University would ever again bp able
to liquidate its debts. The Institution,
however, weathered the storm, and
the judgement and loyalty of the
members of the Faculty and the
friends of the University was amply
repaid.
Twenty years ago yesterday, Oct
ober 1, 1891, Leland Stanford Junior
University was officially and formally
opened. The dedicatory exercises of
the then completed Inner Quad were
held in the morning of the first regis
tration day, and in the afternoon the
original five hundred and fifty-nine
students filed the first registration
blanks in the office of Registrar O. 1...
Elliott.
It was a momentus occasion. Stan
ford represented a new and daring
idea in educational circles. The eyes
of the scholastic world were directed
here that day. The nation waited the
first words spoken from the univer
sity which represented the most ad
vanced and democratic educational
ideas in a century which had seen al
most a complete revolution in univer
sity ideas and ideals.
Many Doubted Success.
In the minds of many who had
watched the growth and development
of the Stanford plan there was felt a
decided doubt as to the ultimate suc
cess of the undertaking. Men. trained
to know of such things, felt that a
university, without tuition and rely
ing wholly on endowment for revenue,
could not succeed. Others believed
with the optimistic and far-seeing
Stanfords, that the idea had such a
firm and sure foundation that noth
ing could accomplish its failure. It
was with minds doubtful of success
on the most part, that the big as
semblage filed into the Inner Quad
on the morning of October 1, 1891,
for the dedicatory exercises.
The Inner Quad had been specially
prepared for the day. At the west
arch the speaker's platform had been
erected. Stretching away from this
on both sides of the central walk were
the chairs for the ladies of the audi
ence. At eleven In the morning the
speakers mounted to the platform.
The San Francisco "Call" describes
the scene in its issue of October 2, as
follows:
Scene In Inner Quad.
"The platform for the orators of
the day had been erected near the
west entrance to the Quadrangle, and
below in chairs were nearly a thous
and women representing the beauty
and fashion of Central California.
Flags and bunting covered the stand
around which were woven garlands of
flowers, hung with bunches of grapes
and evergreens. Above the Chair
man's seat was hung a large oil paint
ing of the late Leland Stanford Jr.,
and around the frame was twined a
fla*< of silk. Palms and semi-tropical
shrubs and trees contrasted with the
gay gowns and parasols of the ladies."
Fully eight thousand •curious and
interested spectators were crowded in
to the west end of the quadrangle.
Among them were the first of the
student body, whose numbers up to
this time had been a matter of specu
lation and, perhaps, worry on the part
of the university authorities. The
seeds of the Stanford Spirit were
sown that morning, when without
rehearsal or practice, the men of the
university-to-be, gathered in a little
group and surprised the still air of
the Santa Clara valley with the first
Stanford yell.
First Stanford Yell.
"Wah. hoo! Wall, hoo! L. S. J. U.
Stanford, Rah. Rah!", they repeated
three times, and the big audience
cheered vociferously. The doubt in
the minds of the pessimistic had al
ready begun to clear.
The opening exercises of that first
day were in accordance with the fol
lowing program:

Music: "Glory be to God 011 High,

in the first address of the day Sen
ator Stanford as founder of the Uni

marks I am about to make I speak

self, for she has been my active and
sympathetic coadjutor and is co
grantor with me in the endowment
and establishment of this University.
Corner-stone Laid 1887.
On the 14th day of May, 1887, the
corner-stone of this quadrangle was
laid, and 011 the first day of October.
1891, we meet to formally throw open
the doors of the institution. Of those
present at the laying of the corner
stone many are hero to-day, but some
of them are with us only in spirit
and in memory.
"for Mrs. Stanford and myself this
ceremony marks an epoch in our lives,
for we see in part the realization of the
hopes and efforts of years; for you.
Faculty and students, the work be

this commencement of your labors
that we are here assembled.
"We believe that a wise system of
education will develop a future civil
ization as much in advance of that of

the condition of the savage. We may
always advance toward the infinite.

liecl to make your way through life
with happiness to yourself and benefit
to humanity. All that we can do for
you is to place, the opportunities with
in your reach; it rests with you to
grasp and improve them. Remember
that life is, above all, practical; that
you are here to fit yourselves for a
useful career; also, that learning
should not only make you wise in the
arts and sciences, but should fully
develop your moral and religious na
tures. The humanizing influences

his Creator. With a full appreciation

President Jordan Speaks.
President David Starr Jordan in his
first address as the head of the Univer
sity spoke in part these words;
"We come together today for the
first time as teachers and students.
With this relation the life of the Ice
land Stanford Junior University be
gins. rt is such personal contact of
young men and young women with
scholars and investigators which con
stitutes the life of the University. It
is for us as teachers and students in
the University's first year to lay the
foundations of a school which may
last as long as human civilization.
Ours is the youngest of the Univer
sities, but it is heir to the wisdom of
all the ages, and with this inheritance
it has the promise of a rapid and
sturdy growth.
"Our University has no history to

fall back upon; no memories of great
teachers haunt its corridors; in none
of its rooms appear the traces which
show where a great man has ever
lived or worked. No tender associa
tions cling, ivy-like, to its fresh new
wqlls. It is hallowed by no tradi
tions; it is hampered by none. Its
finger-posts still point forward. Tra
ditions and associations it is ours to
make. From our work the future of
the University will grow as a splendid
lily from a modest bulb.
"We hope to give our students the
priceless legacy of the educated men,
the power of knowing what really is.
The higher education should bring
men into direct contact with the truth.
It should help to free them from the
dead hands of old traditions and to
enable them to form opinions worthy
of the new evidence each new day
brings before them. An educated
man should not be the slave of the
past, not a copy of the men who have
gone before him. He must be in
some degree the founder of a new in
tellectual dynasty, for each thinker
is a new type of man. Whatever is
true is the truest thing in the uni
verse, and mental and moral strength
come alike from our contact with it.
"Thirst After Knowledge."
"I need not recall to you the history
of the foundation of the Leland Stan
ford Junior University. It has its
origin in the shadow of a great sor
row, and its purpose is the wish to
satisfy for the coming generations the
hunger and thirst after knowledge—
that undying curiosity which is the
best gift of God to man. The influ
ence of the boy, to the nobility of
whose short life the Leland Stanford
Junior University is a tribute and
a remembrance, will never be lost in

our country. To him we owe the in
spiration which led the founders to
devote the earnings of the successful
ventures of a busy life to the work of
higher education.
"The Golden Age of California
begins when its gold is used for pur
poses like this. From such deeds
must rise the new California of the
coming century, no longer the Cali
fornia of the gold seeker and the ad
venturer, but the abode of hlgh-mind
ed men and women, trained in the
wisdom of the ages, and imbued with
the love of nature, the love of man,
and the love of God. And bright in
deed will be the future of our State
if, in the usefulness of the University,
every hope and prayer of the founders
shall be realized."
Purpose of Founding.
The original purpose of the Univer
sity as stated in the founding grant
was worded as follows:
"We, Leland Stanford and Jaue La
throp Stanford, husband and wife,
grantors, desiring to promote the pub
lic welfare by founding, endowing,
and having maintained upon our es
tate known as the Palo Alto Farm,
and situated in the Counties of San
Mateo and Santa Clara, State of Cali
fornia, United States of America, a
university for both sexes, with the
colleges, schools, seminaries of learn
ing, mechanical institutes, museums,
galleries of art, and all other things
necessary and appropriate to a uni
versity of high degree, to that end,
and for that purpose, do hereby
grant," etc.
"And that the trust hereby created
may be executed according to the
wishes of the grantors and each of
them, they do hereby designate the
Nature, Object, and Purposes of the
Institution hereby founded to be:
"Its nature, that of a University,
with such seminaries of learning as
shall make it of the highest grade, in
cluding mechanical institutes, muse
ums, galleries of art, laboratories, and
conservatories, together with all
things necessary for the study of agri
culture in all its branches, and for
mechanical training, and the studies
and exercises directed to the culti
vation and enlargement of the mind;
For Usefulness In Life.
"Its object, to qualify students for
personal success and direct useful
ness in life;
"And its purposes, to promote the
public welfare by exercising an influ
ence in behalf of humanity and civil
ization, teaching the blessings of lib
erty regulated by law, and inculcating
love and reverence for the great prin
ciples of government as derived from
the inalienable rights of man to life,
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."
"Since the idea of establishing an
institution of this kind, for the benefit
of mankind, came directly and largely
from our son and only child, Leland,
and in the belief that had he been
spared to advise as to the disposition
of our estate, he would have desired
the devotion of a large portion thereof
to this purpose, we will that for all
time to come the institution hereby

the power of knowing what really is.
The higher education should bring
men into direct contact with the truth.
It should help to free them from the
dead hands of old traditions and to
enable them to form opinions worthy
of the new evidence each new day
brings before them. An educated
man should not be the slave of the
past, not a copy of the men who have
gone before him. He must be in
some degree the founder of a new in
tellectual dynasty, for each thinker
is a new type of man. Whatever is
true is the truest thing in the uni
verse, and mental and moral strength
come alike from our contact with it.
"Thirst After Knowledge."
"I need not recall to you the history
of the foundation of the Leland Stan
ford Junior University. It has its
origin in the shadow of a great sor
row, and its purpose is the wish to
satisfy for the coming generations the
hunger and thirst after knowledge—
that undying curiosity which is the
best gift of God to man. The influ
ence of the boy, to the nobility of
whose short life the Leland Stanford
Junior University is a tribute and
a remembrance, will never be lost in

our country. To him we owe the in
spiration which led the founders to
devote the earnings of the successful
ventures of a busy life to the work of
higher education.
"The Golden Age of California
begins when its gold is used for pur
poses like this. From such deeds
must rise the new California of the
coming century, no longer the Cali
fornia of the gold seeker and the ad
venturer, but the abode of hlgh-mind
ed men and women, trained in the
wisdom of the ages, and imbued with
the love of nature, the love of man,
and the love of God. And bright in
deed will be the future of our State
if, in the usefulness of the University,
every hope and prayer of the founders
shall be realized."
Purpose of Founding.
The original purpose of the Univer
sity as stated in the founding grant
was worded as follows:
"We, Leland Stanford and Jaue La
throp Stanford, husband and wife,
grantors, desiring to promote the pub
lic welfare by founding, endowing,
and having maintained upon our es
tate known as the Palo Alto Farm,
and situated in the Counties of San
Mateo and Santa Clara, State of Cali
fornia, United States of America, a
university for both sexes, with the
colleges, schools, seminaries of learn
ing, mechanical institutes, museums,
galleries of art, and all other things
necessary and appropriate to a uni
versity of high degree, to that end,
and for that purpose, do hereby
grant," etc.
"And that the trust hereby created
may be executed according to the
wishes of the grantors and each of
them, they do hereby designate the
Nature, Object, and Purposes of the
Institution hereby founded to be:
"Its nature, that of a University,
with such seminaries of learning as
shall make it of the highest grade, in
cluding mechanical institutes, muse
ums, galleries of art, laboratories, and
conservatories, together with all
things necessary for the study of agri
culture in all its branches, and for
mechanical training, and the studies
and exercises directed to the culti
vation and enlargement of the mind;
For Usefulness In Life.
"Its object, to qualify students for
personal success and direct useful
ness in life;
"And its purposes, to promote the
public welfare by exercising an influ
ence in behalf of humanity and civil
ization, teaching the blessings of lib
erty regulated by law, and inculcating
love and reverence for the great prin
ciples of government as derived from
the inalienable rights of man to life,
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."
"Since the idea of establishing an
institution of this kind, for the benefit
of mankind, came directly and largely
from our son and only child, Leland,
and in the belief that had he been
spared to advise as to the disposition
of our estate, he would have desired
the devotion of a large portion thereof
to this purpose, we will that for all
time to come the institution hereby
founded shall bear his name, and
shall be known as The Leland Stan
ford Junior University."
With this general idea of a demo
cratic, non-sectarian, and advanced
university, the institution was found
ed. Tt was planned as an eternal
legafcy to the youth of California.
The Government Si^es.
For two years from 1894 to 1896
the life of the University hung in the
balance. The government of the
United States sued the Stanford es
tate as part holder in the original
Central Pacific company for money
which had been loaned to the railroad
company on bonds.
When the project of a transconti
nental road was first broached it was
necessary to secure government aid
to carry through the scheme. A loan
was floated with the government of
$100.000,000. Security on this loan


(Continued on Pape 6)
was given in the shape of an equal
quantity of Central Pacific bonds,
bearing the usual interest.
At" first it appeared that the rail
road was going to be a failure and
the government feafed the loss of the
total loan. They believed that not
only was the loan an entire loss, but
that both the principal and interest on
the huge mass of bonds would never
be paid.
In Probate Court.
This was after the death of Senator
Stanford in 1893 and the estate was
in probate court. This was the only
portion of the original four holdings
in the railroad which the government
could lay hands upon and they
brought suit for a pro rata share of
the debt.
The suit was opened in the United
States Circuit court. While it was
being tried Mr. C. P. Huntington, then
president of the railroad, was in
Washington trying to secure a revo
cation of a portion of the indebted
ness. His attempts failed, but the
first court in which the case was tried

returned a verdict in favor ot' the
University.
The case was appealed and carried
to the next higher court where the
! decision of the lower court was af-
I firmed. Mrs. Stanford, through her
influence, had the court calendar
changed and the case was finally
brought up before the Supreme Court
of the United States in record time.
I'nhersitj »ins Cnsp.
On March 2, ISfMi thie Supreme
Court again supported the judgements
of the lower courts and the govern
ment had lost its suit. The Univer
sity had been saved.
During all this time while the litl
gation lasted the funds of the Uni
versity were tied up. There was not"
even sufficient money with which to
pay the salaries of the Faculty. It
was a period of heroic sacrifices.
During the entire two years, those
men of the Faculty who were loyal
to the University remained at their
posts in spite of financial difficulties
and the uncertainty as to whether the
University would ever again bp able
to liquidate its debts. The Institution,
however, weathered the storm, and
the judgement and loyalty of the
members of the Faculty and the
friends of the University was amply
repaid.
Twenty years ago yesterday, Oct
ober 1, 1891, Leland Stanford Junior
University was officially and formally
opened. The dedicatory exercises of
the then completed Inner Quad were
held in the morning of the first regis
tration day, and in the afternoon the
original five hundred and fifty-nine
students filed the first registration
blanks in the office of Registrar O. 1...
Elliott.
It was a momentus occasion. Stan
ford represented a new and daring
idea in educational circles. The eyes
of the scholastic world were directed
here that day. The nation waited the
first words spoken from the univer
sity which represented the most ad
vanced and democratic educational
ideas in a century which had seen al
most a complete revolution in univer
sity ideas and ideals.
Many Doubted Success.
In the minds of many who had
watched the growth and development
of the Stanford plan there was felt a
decided doubt as to the ultimate suc
cess of the undertaking. Men. trained
to know of such things, felt that a
university, without tuition and rely
ing wholly on endowment for revenue,
could not succeed. Others believed
with the optimistic and far-seeing
Stanfords, that the idea had such a
firm and sure foundation that noth
ing could accomplish its failure. It
was with minds doubtful of success
on the most part, that the big as
semblage filed into the Inner Quad
on the morning of October 1, 1891,
for the dedicatory exercises.
The Inner Quad had been specially
prepared for the day. At the west
arch the speaker's platform had been
erected. Stretching away from this
on both sides of the central walk were
the chairs for the ladies of the audi
ence. At eleven In the morning the
speakers mounted to the platform.
The San Francisco "Call" describes
the scene in its issue of October 2, as
follows:
Scene In Inner Quad.
"The platform for the orators of
the day had been erected near the
west entrance to the Quadrangle, and
below in chairs were nearly a thous
and women representing the beauty
and fashion of Central California.
Flags and bunting covered the stand
around which were woven garlands of
flowers, hung with bunches of grapes
and evergreens. Above the Chair
man's seat was hung a large oil paint
ing of the late Leland Stanford Jr.,
and around the frame was twined a
fla*< of silk. Palms and semi-tropical
shrubs and trees contrasted with the
gay gowns and parasols of the ladies."
Fully eight thousand •curious and
interested spectators were crowded in
to the west end of the quadrangle.
Among them were the first of the
student body, whose numbers up to
this time had been a matter of specu
lation and, perhaps, worry on the part
of the university authorities. The
seeds of the Stanford Spirit were
sown that morning, when without
rehearsal or practice, the men of the
university-to-be, gathered in a little
group and surprised the still air of
the Santa Clara valley with the first
Stanford yell.
First Stanford Yell.
"Wah. hoo! Wall, hoo! L. S. J. U.
Stanford, Rah. Rah!", they repeated
three times, and the big audience
cheered vociferously. The doubt in
the minds of the pessimistic had al
ready begun to clear.
The opening exercises of that first
day were in accordance with the fol
lowing program:

Music: "Glory be to God 011 High,

in the first address of the day Sen
ator Stanford as founder of the Uni
versity spoke in part as follows:
"f desire to state in the few re
marks I am about to make I speak
for Mrs. Stanford, as well as for my
self, for she has been my active and
sympathetic coadjutor and is co
grantor with me in the endowment
and establishment of this University.
Corner-stone Laid 1887.
On the 14th day of May, 1887, the
corner-stone of this quadrangle was
laid, and 011 the first day of October.
1891, we meet to formally throw open
the doors of the institution. Of those
present at the laying of the corner
stone many are hero to-day, but some
of them are with us only in spirit
and in memory.
"for Mrs. Stanford and myself this
ceremony marks an epoch in our lives,
for we see in part the realization of the
hopes and efforts of years; for you.
Faculty and students, the work be

this commencement of your labors
that we are here assembled.
"We believe that a wise system of
education will develop a future civil
ization as much in advance of that of
the present as ours is in advance of
the condition of the savage. We may
always advance toward the infinite.

you is to place, the opportunities with
in your reach; it rests with you to
grasp and improve them. Remember
that life is, above all, practical; that
you are here to fit yourselves for a
useful career; also, that learning
should not only make you wise in the
arts and sciences, but should fully

President Jordan Speaks.
President David Starr Jordan in his
first address as the head of the Univer
sity spoke in part these words;
"We come together today for the
first time as teachers and students.
With this relation the life of the Ice
land Stanford Junior University be
gins. rt is such personal contact of
young men and young women with
scholars and investigators which con
stitutes the life of the University. It
is for us as teachers and students in
the University's first year to lay the
foundations of a school which may
last as long as human civilization.
Ours is the youngest of the Univer
sities, but it is heir to the wisdom of
all the ages, and with this inheritance
it has the promise of a rapid and
sturdy growth.
"Our University has no history to

fall back upon; no memories of great
teachers haunt its corridors; in none
of its rooms appear the traces which
show where a great man has ever
lived or worked. No tender associa
tions cling, ivy-like, to its fresh new
wqlls. It is hallowed by no tradi
tions; it is hampered by none. Its
finger-posts still point forward. Tra
ditions and associations it is ours to
make. From our work the future of
the University will grow as a splendid
lily from a modest bulb.
"We hope to give our students the
priceless legacy of the educated men,
the power of knowing what really is.
The higher education should bring
men into direct contact with the truth.
It should help to free them from the
dead hands of old traditions and to
enable them to form opinions worthy
of the new evidence each new day
brings before them. An educated
man should not be the slave of the
past, not a copy of the men who have
gone before him. He must be in
some degree the founder of a new in
tellectual dynasty, for each thinker
is a new type of man. Whatever is
true is the truest thing in the uni
verse, and mental and moral strength

liecl to make your way through life
with happiness to yourself and benefit
to humanity. All that we can do for
you is to place, the opportunities with
in your reach; it rests with you to
grasp and improve them. Remember
that life is, above all, practical; that
you are here to fit yourselves for a
useful career; also, that learning
should not only make you wise in the
arts and sciences, but should fully
develop your moral and religious na

come from the proper understanding

President Jordan Speaks.
President David Starr Jordan in his
first address as the head of the Univer
sity spoke in part these words;
"We come together today for the
first time as teachers and students.
With this relation the life of the Ice
land Stanford Junior University be
gins. rt is such personal contact of
young men and young women with
scholars and investigators which con
stitutes the life of the University. It
is for us as teachers and students in
the University's first year to lay the
foundations of a school which may
last as long as human civilization.
Ours is the youngest of the Univer
sities, but it is heir to the wisdom of
all the ages, and with this inheritance
it has the promise of a rapid and
sturdy growth.
"Our University has no history to

fall back upon; no memories of great
teachers haunt its corridors; in none
of its rooms appear the traces which
show where a great man has ever
lived or worked. No tender associa
tions cling, ivy-like, to its fresh new
wqlls. It is hallowed by no tradi
tions; it is hampered by none. Its
finger-posts still point forward. Tra
ditions and associations it is ours to
make. From our work the future of
the University will grow as a splendid
lily from a modest bulb.
"We hope to give our students the
priceless legacy of the educated men,
the power of knowing what really is.
The higher education should bring
men into direct contact with the truth.
It should help to free them from the
dead hands of old traditions and to
enable them to form opinions worthy
of the new evidence each new day
brings before them. An educated
man should not be the slave of the
past, not a copy of the men who have
gone before him. He must be in
some degree the founder of a new in
tellectual dynasty, for each thinker
is a new type of man. Whatever is
true is the truest thing in the uni
verse, and mental and moral strength
come alike from our contact with it.
"Thirst After Knowledge."
"I need not recall to you the history
of the foundation of the Leland Stan
ford Junior University. It has its
origin in the shadow of a great sor
row, and its purpose is the wish to
satisfy for the coming generations the
hunger and thirst after knowledge—
that undying curiosity which is the
best gift of God to man. The influ
ence of the boy, to the nobility of
whose short life the Leland Stanford
Junior University is a tribute and
a remembrance, will never be lost in

our country. To him we owe the in
spiration which led the founders to
devote the earnings of the successful
ventures of a busy life to the work of
higher education.
"The Golden Age of California
begins when its gold is used for pur
poses like this. From such deeds
must rise the new California of the
coming century, no longer the Cali
fornia of the gold seeker and the ad
venturer, but the abode of hlgh-mind
ed men and women, trained in the
wisdom of the ages, and imbued with
the love of nature, the love of man,
and the love of God. And bright in
deed will be the future of our State
if, in the usefulness of the University,
every hope and prayer of the founders
shall be realized."
Purpose of Founding.
The original purpose of the Univer
sity as stated in the founding grant
was worded as follows:
"We, Leland Stanford and Jaue La
throp Stanford, husband and wife,
grantors, desiring to promote the pub
lic welfare by founding, endowing,
and having maintained upon our es
tate known as the Palo Alto Farm,
and situated in the Counties of San
Mateo and Santa Clara, State of Cali
fornia, United States of America, a
university for both sexes, with the
colleges, schools, seminaries of learn
ing, mechanical institutes, museums,
galleries of art, and all other things
necessary and appropriate to a uni
versity of high degree, to that end,
and for that purpose, do hereby
grant," etc.
"And that the trust hereby created
may be executed according to the
wishes of the grantors and each of
them, they do hereby designate the
Nature, Object, and Purposes of the
Institution hereby founded to be:
"Its nature, that of a University,
with such seminaries of learning as
shall make it of the highest grade, in
cluding mechanical institutes, muse
ums, galleries of art, laboratories, and
conservatories, together with all
things necessary for the study of agri
culture in all its branches, and for
mechanical training, and the studies
and exercises directed to the culti
vation and enlargement of the mind;
For Usefulness In Life.
"Its object, to qualify students for
personal success and direct useful
ness in life;
"And its purposes, to promote the
public welfare by exercising an influ
ence in behalf of humanity and civil
ization, teaching the blessings of lib
erty regulated by law, and inculcating
love and reverence for the great prin
ciples of government as derived from
the inalienable rights of man to life,
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."
"Since the idea of establishing an
institution of this kind, for the benefit
of mankind, came directly and largely
from our son and only child, Leland,
and in the belief that had he been
spared to advise as to the disposition
of our estate, he would have desired
the devotion of a large portion thereof
to this purpose, we will that for all
time to come the institution hereby
founded shall bear his name, and
shall be known as The Leland Stan
ford Junior University."
With this general idea of a demo
cratic, non-sectarian, and advanced
university, the institution was found
ed. Tt was planned as an eternal
legafcy to the youth of California.
The Government Si^es.
For two years from 1894 to 1896
the life of the University hung in the
balance. The government of the
United States sued the Stanford es
tate as part holder in the original
Central Pacific company for money
which had been loaned to the railroad
company on bonds.
When the project of a transconti
nental road was first broached it was
necessary to secure government aid
to carry through the scheme. A loan
was floated with the government of
$100.000,000. Security on this loan


(Continued on Pape 6)
was given in the shape of an equal
quantity of Central Pacific bonds,
bearing the usual interest.
At" first it appeared that the rail
road was going to be a failure and
the government feafed the loss of the
total loan. They believed that not
only was the loan an entire loss, but
that both the principal and interest on
the huge mass of bonds would never
be paid.
In Probate Court.
This was after the death of Senator
Stanford in 1893 and the estate was
in probate court. This was the only
portion of the original four holdings
in the railroad which the government
could lay hands upon and they
brought suit for a pro rata share of
the debt.
The suit was opened in the United
States Circuit court. While it was
being tried Mr. C. P. Huntington, then
president of the railroad, was in
Washington trying to secure a revo
cation of a portion of the indebted
ness. His attempts failed, but the
first court in which the case was tried

returned a verdict in favor ot' the
University.
The case was appealed and carried
to the next higher court where the
! decision of the lower court was af-
I firmed. Mrs. Stanford, through her
influence, had the court calendar
changed and the case was finally
brought up before the Supreme Court
of the United States in record time.
I'nhersitj »ins Cnsp.
On March 2, ISfMi thie Supreme
Court again supported the judgements
of the lower courts and the govern
ment had lost its suit. The Univer
sity had been saved.
During all this time while the litl
gation lasted the funds of the Uni
versity were tied up. There was not"
even sufficient money with which to
pay the salaries of the Faculty. It
was a period of heroic sacrifices.
During the entire two years, those
men of the Faculty who were loyal
to the University remained at their
posts in spite of financial difficulties
and the uncertainty as to whether the
University would ever again bp able
to liquidate its debts. The Institution,
however, weathered the storm, and
the judgement and loyalty of the
members of the Faculty and the
friends of the University was amply
repaid.
Twenty years ago yesterday, Oct
ober 1, 1891, Leland Stanford Junior
University was officially and formally
opened. The dedicatory exercises of
the then completed Inner Quad were
held in the morning of the first regis
tration day, and in the afternoon the
original five hundred and fifty-nine
students filed the first registration
blanks in the office of Registrar O. 1...
Elliott.
It was a momentus occasion. Stan
ford represented a new and daring
idea in educational circles. The eyes
of the scholastic world were directed
here that day. The nation waited the
first words spoken from the univer
sity which represented the most ad
vanced and democratic educational
ideas in a century which had seen al
most a complete revolution in univer
sity ideas and ideals.
Many Doubted Success.
In the minds of many who had
watched the growth and development
of the Stanford plan there was felt a
decided doubt as to the ultimate suc
cess of the undertaking. Men. trained
to know of such things, felt that a
university, without tuition and rely
ing wholly on endowment for revenue,
could not succeed. Others believed
with the optimistic and far-seeing
Stanfords, that the idea had such a
firm and sure foundation that noth
ing could accomplish its failure. It
was with minds doubtful of success
on the most part, that the big as
semblage filed into the Inner Quad
on the morning of October 1, 1891,
for the dedicatory exercises.
The Inner Quad had been specially
prepared for the day. At the west
arch the speaker's platform had been
erected. Stretching away from this
on both sides of the central walk were
the chairs for the ladies of the audi
ence. At eleven In the morning the
speakers mounted to the platform.
The San Francisco "Call" describes
the scene in its issue of October 2, as
follows:
Scene In Inner Quad.
"The platform for the orators of
the day had been erected near the
west entrance to the Quadrangle, and
below in chairs were nearly a thous
and women representing the beauty
and fashion of Central California.
Flags and bunting covered the stand
around which were woven garlands of
flowers, hung with bunches of grapes
and evergreens. Above the Chair
man's seat was hung a large oil paint
ing of the late Leland Stanford Jr.,
and around the frame was twined a
fla*< of silk. Palms and semi-tropical
shrubs and trees contrasted with the
gay gowns and parasols of the ladies."
Fully eight thousand •curious and
interested spectators were crowded in
to the west end of the quadrangle.
Among them were the first of the
student body, whose numbers up to
this time had been a matter of specu
lation and, perhaps, worry on the part
of the university authorities. The
seeds of the Stanford Spirit were
sown that morning, when without
rehearsal or practice, the men of the
university-to-be, gathered in a little
group and surprised the still air of
the Santa Clara valley with the first
Stanford yell.
First Stanford Yell.
"Wah. hoo! Wall, hoo! L. S. J. U.
Stanford, Rah. Rah!", they repeated
three times, and the big audience
cheered vociferously. The doubt in
the minds of the pessimistic had al
ready begun to clear.
The opening exercises of that first
day were in accordance with the fol
lowing program:

Music: "Glory be to God 011 High,

ulty.
in the first address of the day Sen
ator Stanford as founder of the Uni
versity spoke in part as follows:
"f desire to state in the few re
marks I am about to make I speak
for Mrs. Stanford, as well as for my
self, for she has been my active and
sympathetic coadjutor and is co
grantor with me in the endowment
and establishment of this University.
Corner-stone Laid 1887.
On the 14th day of May, 1887, the
corner-stone of this quadrangle was
laid, and 011 the first day of October.
1891, we meet to formally throw open
the doors of the institution. Of those
present at the laying of the corner
stone many are hero to-day, but some
of them are with us only in spirit
and in memory.
"for Mrs. Stanford and myself this
ceremony marks an epoch in our lives,
for we see in part the realization of the
hopes and efforts of years; for you.
Faculty and students, the work be
gins now, and it is to commemorate
this commencement of your labors
that we are here assembled.
"We believe that a wise system of
education will develop a future civil
ization as much in advance of that of
the present as ours is in advance of
the condition of the savage. We may
always advance toward the infinite.
"Students of the Leland Stanford
Jr. University, upon the individual
efforts of each of ydu mainly depends

university may lie bounded by you.:
in it you may study for years, under

University shortly after the opening
day, are still numbered with the Fac

in the first address of the day Sen
ator Stanford as founder of the Uni
versity spoke in part as follows:
"f desire to state in the few re
marks I am about to make I speak
for Mrs. Stanford, as well as for my
self, for she has been my active and
sympathetic coadjutor and is co
grantor with me in the endowment
and establishment of this University.
Corner-stone Laid 1887.
On the 14th day of May, 1887, the
corner-stone of this quadrangle was
laid, and 011 the first day of October.
1891, we meet to formally throw open
the doors of the institution. Of those
present at the laying of the corner
stone many are hero to-day, but some
of them are with us only in spirit
and in memory.
"for Mrs. Stanford and myself this
ceremony marks an epoch in our lives,
for we see in part the realization of the
hopes and efforts of years; for you.
Faculty and students, the work be
gins now, and it is to commemorate
this commencement of your labors
that we are here assembled.
"We believe that a wise system of
education will develop a future civil
ization as much in advance of that of
the present as ours is in advance of
the condition of the savage. We may
always advance toward the infinite.

liecl to make your way through life
with happiness to yourself and benefit
to humanity. All that we can do for
you is to place, the opportunities with
in your reach; it rests with you to
grasp and improve them. Remember
that life is, above all, practical; that
you are here to fit yourselves for a
useful career; also, that learning
should not only make you wise in the
arts and sciences, but should fully
develop your moral and religious na

President Jordan Speaks.
President David Starr Jordan in his
first address as the head of the Univer
sity spoke in part these words;
"We come together today for the
first time as teachers and students.
With this relation the life of the Ice
land Stanford Junior University be
gins. rt is such personal contact of
young men and young women with
scholars and investigators which con
stitutes the life of the University. It
is for us as teachers and students in
the University's first year to lay the
foundations of a school which may
last as long as human civilization.
Ours is the youngest of the Univer
sities, but it is heir to the wisdom of
all the ages, and with this inheritance
it has the promise of a rapid and
sturdy growth.
"Our University has no history to

fall back upon; no memories of great
teachers haunt its corridors; in none
of its rooms appear the traces which
show where a great man has ever
lived or worked. No tender associa
tions cling, ivy-like, to its fresh new
wqlls. It is hallowed by no tradi
tions; it is hampered by none. Its
finger-posts still point forward. Tra
ditions and associations it is ours to
make. From our work the future of
the University will grow as a splendid
lily from a modest bulb.
"We hope to give our students the
priceless legacy of the educated men,
the power of knowing what really is.
The higher education should bring
men into direct contact with the truth.
It should help to free them from the
dead hands of old traditions and to
enable them to form opinions worthy
of the new evidence each new day
brings before them. An educated
man should not be the slave of the
past, not a copy of the men who have
gone before him. He must be in
some degree the founder of a new in
tellectual dynasty, for each thinker
is a new type of man. Whatever is
true is the truest thing in the uni
verse, and mental and moral strength
come alike from our contact with it.
"Thirst After Knowledge."
"I need not recall to you the history
of the foundation of the Leland Stan
ford Junior University. It has its
origin in the shadow of a great sor
row, and its purpose is the wish to
satisfy for the coming generations the
hunger and thirst after knowledge—
that undying curiosity which is the
best gift of God to man. The influ
ence of the boy, to the nobility of
whose short life the Leland Stanford
Junior University is a tribute and
a remembrance, will never be lost in

our country. To him we owe the in
spiration which led the founders to
devote the earnings of the successful
ventures of a busy life to the work of
higher education.
"The Golden Age of California
begins when its gold is used for pur
poses like this. From such deeds
must rise the new California of the
coming century, no longer the Cali
fornia of the gold seeker and the ad
venturer, but the abode of hlgh-mind
ed men and women, trained in the
wisdom of the ages, and imbued with
the love of nature, the love of man,
and the love of God. And bright in
deed will be the future of our State
if, in the usefulness of the University,
every hope and prayer of the founders
shall be realized."
Purpose of Founding.
The original purpose of the Univer
sity as stated in the founding grant
was worded as follows:
"We, Leland Stanford and Jaue La
throp Stanford, husband and wife,
grantors, desiring to promote the pub
lic welfare by founding, endowing,
and having maintained upon our es
tate known as the Palo Alto Farm,
and situated in the Counties of San
Mateo and Santa Clara, State of Cali
fornia, United States of America, a
university for both sexes, with the
colleges, schools, seminaries of learn
ing, mechanical institutes, museums,
galleries of art, and all other things
necessary and appropriate to a uni
versity of high degree, to that end,
and for that purpose, do hereby
grant," etc.
"And that the trust hereby created
may be executed according to the
wishes of the grantors and each of
them, they do hereby designate the
Nature, Object, and Purposes of the
Institution hereby founded to be:
"Its nature, that of a University,
with such seminaries of learning as
shall make it of the highest grade, in
cluding mechanical institutes, muse
ums, galleries of art, laboratories, and
conservatories, together with all
things necessary for the study of agri
culture in all its branches, and for
mechanical training, and the studies
and exercises directed to the culti
vation and enlargement of the mind;
For Usefulness In Life.
"Its object, to qualify students for
personal success and direct useful
ness in life;
"And its purposes, to promote the
public welfare by exercising an influ
ence in behalf of humanity and civil
ization, teaching the blessings of lib
erty regulated by law, and inculcating
love and reverence for the great prin
ciples of government as derived from
the inalienable rights of man to life,
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."
"Since the idea of establishing an
institution of this kind, for the benefit
of mankind, came directly and largely
from our son and only child, Leland,
and in the belief that had he been
spared to advise as to the disposition
of our estate, he would have desired
the devotion of a large portion thereof
to this purpose, we will that for all
time to come the institution hereby
founded shall bear his name, and
shall be known as The Leland Stan
ford Junior University."
With this general idea of a demo
cratic, non-sectarian, and advanced
university, the institution was found
ed. Tt was planned as an eternal
legafcy to the youth of California.
The Government Si^es.
For two years from 1894 to 1896
the life of the University hung in the
balance. The government of the
United States sued the Stanford es
tate as part holder in the original
Central Pacific company for money
which had been loaned to the railroad
company on bonds.
When the project of a transconti
nental road was first broached it was
necessary to secure government aid
to carry through the scheme. A loan
was floated with the government of
$100.000,000. Security on this loan


(Continued on Pape 6)
was given in the shape of an equal
quantity of Central Pacific bonds,
bearing the usual interest.
At" first it appeared that the rail
road was going to be a failure and
the government feafed the loss of the
total loan. They believed that not
only was the loan an entire loss, but
that both the principal and interest on
the huge mass of bonds would never
be paid.
In Probate Court.
This was after the death of Senator
Stanford in 1893 and the estate was
in probate court. This was the only
portion of the original four holdings
in the railroad which the government
could lay hands upon and they
brought suit for a pro rata share of
the debt.
The suit was opened in the United
States Circuit court. While it was
being tried Mr. C. P. Huntington, then
president of the railroad, was in
Washington trying to secure a revo
cation of a portion of the indebted
ness. His attempts failed, but the
first court in which the case was tried

returned a verdict in favor ot' the
University.
The case was appealed and carried
to the next higher court where the
! decision of the lower court was af-
I firmed. Mrs. Stanford, through her
influence, had the court calendar
changed and the case was finally
brought up before the Supreme Court
of the United States in record time.
I'nhersitj »ins Cnsp.
On March 2, ISfMi thie Supreme
Court again supported the judgements
of the lower courts and the govern
ment had lost its suit. The Univer
sity had been saved.
During all this time while the litl
gation lasted the funds of the Uni
versity were tied up. There was not"
even sufficient money with which to
pay the salaries of the Faculty. It
was a period of heroic sacrifices.
During the entire two years, those
men of the Faculty who were loyal
to the University remained at their
posts in spite of financial difficulties
and the uncertainty as to whether the
University would ever again bp able
to liquidate its debts. The Institution,
however, weathered the storm, and
the judgement and loyalty of the
members of the Faculty and the
friends of the University was amply
repaid.
Twenty years ago yesterday, Oct
ober 1, 1891, Leland Stanford Junior
University was officially and formally
opened. The dedicatory exercises of
the then completed Inner Quad were
held in the morning of the first regis
tration day, and in the afternoon the
original five hundred and fifty-nine
students filed the first registration
blanks in the office of Registrar O. 1...
Elliott.
It was a momentus occasion. Stan
ford represented a new and daring
idea in educational circles. The eyes
of the scholastic world were directed
here that day. The nation waited the
first words spoken from the univer
sity which represented the most ad
vanced and democratic educational
ideas in a century which had seen al
most a complete revolution in univer
sity ideas and ideals.
Many Doubted Success.
In the minds of many who had
watched the growth and development
of the Stanford plan there was felt a
decided doubt as to the ultimate suc
cess of the undertaking. Men. trained
to know of such things, felt that a
university, without tuition and rely
ing wholly on endowment for revenue,
could not succeed. Others believed
with the optimistic and far-seeing
Stanfords, that the idea had such a
firm and sure foundation that noth
ing could accomplish its failure. It
was with minds doubtful of success
on the most part, that the big as
semblage filed into the Inner Quad
on the morning of October 1, 1891,
for the dedicatory exercises.
The Inner Quad had been specially
prepared for the day. At the west
arch the speaker's platform had been
erected. Stretching away from this
on both sides of the central walk were
the chairs for the ladies of the audi
ence. At eleven In the morning the
speakers mounted to the platform.
The San Francisco "Call" describes
the scene in its issue of October 2, as
follows:
Scene In Inner Quad.
"The platform for the orators of
the day had been erected near the
west entrance to the Quadrangle, and
below in chairs were nearly a thous
and women representing the beauty
and fashion of Central California.
Flags and bunting covered the stand
around which were woven garlands of
flowers, hung with bunches of grapes
and evergreens. Above the Chair
man's seat was hung a large oil paint
ing of the late Leland Stanford Jr.,
and around the frame was twined a
fla*< of silk. Palms and semi-tropical
shrubs and trees contrasted with the
gay gowns and parasols of the ladies."
Fully eight thousand •curious and
interested spectators were crowded in
to the west end of the quadrangle.
Among them were the first of the
student body, whose numbers up to
this time had been a matter of specu
lation and, perhaps, worry on the part
of the university authorities. The
seeds of the Stanford Spirit were
sown that morning, when without
rehearsal or practice, the men of the
university-to-be, gathered in a little
group and surprised the still air of
the Santa Clara valley with the first
Stanford yell.
First Stanford Yell.
"Wah. hoo! Wall, hoo! L. S. J. U.
Stanford, Rah. Rah!", they repeated
three times, and the big audience
cheered vociferously. The doubt in
the minds of the pessimistic had al
ready begun to clear.
The opening exercises of that first
day were in accordance with the fol
lowing program:

Music: "Glory be to God 011 High,
Mozart.
Chorus led by Mr. J. H. Ellwood.

rehearsal or practice, the men of the
university-to-be, gathered in a little
group and surprised the still air of
the Santa Clara valley with the first
Stanford yell.
First Stanford Yell.
"Wah. hoo! Wall, hoo! L. S. J. U.
Stanford, Rah. Rah!", they repeated
three times, and the big audience
cheered vociferously. The doubt in
the minds of the pessimistic had al
ready begun to clear.

versity spoke in part as follows:
"f desire to state in the few re
marks I am about to make I speak
for Mrs. Stanford, as well as for my
self, for she has been my active and
sympathetic coadjutor and is co
grantor with me in the endowment
and establishment of this University.
Corner-stone Laid 1887.
On the 14th day of May, 1887, the
corner-stone of this quadrangle was
laid, and 011 the first day of October.
1891, we meet to formally throw open
the doors of the institution. Of those
present at the laying of the corner
stone many are hero to-day, but some
of them are with us only in spirit
and in memory.
"for Mrs. Stanford and myself this
ceremony marks an epoch in our lives,
for we see in part the realization of the
hopes and efforts of years; for you.
Faculty and students, the work be
gins now, and it is to commemorate
this commencement of your labors
that we are here assembled.
"We believe that a wise system of
education will develop a future civil
ization as much in advance of that of
the present as ours is in advance of
the condition of the savage. We may
always advance toward the infinite.

liecl to make your way through life
with happiness to yourself and benefit
to humanity. All that we can do for
you is to place, the opportunities with
in your reach; it rests with you to
grasp and improve them. Remember
that life is, above all, practical; that
you are here to fit yourselves for a
useful career; also, that learning
should not only make you wise in the
arts and sciences, but should fully
develop your moral and religious na
tures. The humanizing influences
come from the proper understanding
of the rights of man and his duties to
his Creator. With a full appreciation
of these he will comprehend and have
developed in him the active principles
of religion, to wit: Benevolence, tol
eration, kindness, patience, forbear

general interests of his fellow crea
tures with a charity that will reach
evei*y condition of life."
President Jordan Speaks.
President David Starr Jordan in his
first address as the head of the Univer
sity spoke in part these words;
"We come together today for the
first time as teachers and students.
With this relation the life of the Ice
land Stanford Junior University be
gins. rt is such personal contact of
young men and young women with
scholars and investigators which con
stitutes the life of the University. It
is for us as teachers and students in
the University's first year to lay the
foundations of a school which may
last as long as human civilization.
Ours is the youngest of the Univer
sities, but it is heir to the wisdom of
all the ages, and with this inheritance
it has the promise of a rapid and
sturdy growth.
"Our University has no history to

fall back upon; no memories of great
teachers haunt its corridors; in none
of its rooms appear the traces which
show where a great man has ever
lived or worked. No tender associa
tions cling, ivy-like, to its fresh new
wqlls. It is hallowed by no tradi
tions; it is hampered by none. Its
finger-posts still point forward. Tra
ditions and associations it is ours to
make. From our work the future of
the University will grow as a splendid
lily from a modest bulb.
"We hope to give our students the
priceless legacy of the educated men,
the power of knowing what really is.
The higher education should bring
men into direct contact with the truth.
It should help to free them from the
dead hands of old traditions and to
enable them to form opinions worthy
of the new evidence each new day
brings before them. An educated
man should not be the slave of the
past, not a copy of the men who have
gone before him. He must be in
some degree the founder of a new in
tellectual dynasty, for each thinker
is a new type of man. Whatever is
true is the truest thing in the uni
verse, and mental and moral strength
come alike from our contact with it.
"Thirst After Knowledge."
"I need not recall to you the history
of the foundation of the Leland Stan
ford Junior University. It has its
origin in the shadow of a great sor
row, and its purpose is the wish to
satisfy for the coming generations the
hunger and thirst after knowledge—
that undying curiosity which is the
best gift of God to man. The influ
ence of the boy, to the nobility of
whose short life the Leland Stanford
Junior University is a tribute and
a remembrance, will never be lost in

our country. To him we owe the in
spiration which led the founders to
devote the earnings of the successful
ventures of a busy life to the work of
higher education.
"The Golden Age of California
begins when its gold is used for pur
poses like this. From such deeds
must rise the new California of the
coming century, no longer the Cali
fornia of the gold seeker and the ad
venturer, but the abode of hlgh-mind
ed men and women, trained in the
wisdom of the ages, and imbued with
the love of nature, the love of man,
and the love of God. And bright in
deed will be the future of our State
if, in the usefulness of the University,
every hope and prayer of the founders
shall be realized."
Purpose of Founding.
The original purpose of the Univer
sity as stated in the founding grant
was worded as follows:
"We, Leland Stanford and Jaue La
throp Stanford, husband and wife,
grantors, desiring to promote the pub
lic welfare by founding, endowing,
and having maintained upon our es
tate known as the Palo Alto Farm,
and situated in the Counties of San
Mateo and Santa Clara, State of Cali
fornia, United States of America, a
university for both sexes, with the
colleges, schools, seminaries of learn
ing, mechanical institutes, museums,
galleries of art, and all other things
necessary and appropriate to a uni
versity of high degree, to that end,
and for that purpose, do hereby
grant," etc.
"And that the trust hereby created
may be executed according to the
wishes of the grantors and each of
them, they do hereby designate the
Nature, Object, and Purposes of the
Institution hereby founded to be:
"Its nature, that of a University,
with such seminaries of learning as
shall make it of the highest grade, in
cluding mechanical institutes, muse
ums, galleries of art, laboratories, and
conservatories, together with all
things necessary for the study of agri
culture in all its branches, and for
mechanical training, and the studies
and exercises directed to the culti
vation and enlargement of the mind;
For Usefulness In Life.
"Its object, to qualify students for
personal success and direct useful
ness in life;
"And its purposes, to promote the
public welfare by exercising an influ
ence in behalf of humanity and civil
ization, teaching the blessings of lib
erty regulated by law, and inculcating
love and reverence for the great prin
ciples of government as derived from
the inalienable rights of man to life,
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."
"Since the idea of establishing an
institution of this kind, for the benefit
of mankind, came directly and largely
from our son and only child, Leland,
and in the belief that had he been
spared to advise as to the disposition
of our estate, he would have desired
the devotion of a large portion thereof
to this purpose, we will that for all
time to come the institution hereby
founded shall bear his name, and
shall be known as The Leland Stan
ford Junior University."
With this general idea of a demo
cratic, non-sectarian, and advanced
university, the institution was found
ed. Tt was planned as an eternal
legafcy to the youth of California.
The Government Si^es.
For two years from 1894 to 1896
the life of the University hung in the
balance. The government of the
United States sued the Stanford es
tate as part holder in the original
Central Pacific company for money
which had been loaned to the railroad
company on bonds.
When the project of a transconti
nental road was first broached it was
necessary to secure government aid
to carry through the scheme. A loan
was floated with the government of
$100.000,000. Security on this loan


(Continued on Pape 6)
was given in the shape of an equal
quantity of Central Pacific bonds,
bearing the usual interest.
At" first it appeared that the rail
road was going to be a failure and
the government feafed the loss of the
total loan. They believed that not
only was the loan an entire loss, but
that both the principal and interest on
the huge mass of bonds would never
be paid.
In Probate Court.
This was after the death of Senator
Stanford in 1893 and the estate was
in probate court. This was the only
portion of the original four holdings
in the railroad which the government
could lay hands upon and they
brought suit for a pro rata share of
the debt.
The suit was opened in the United
States Circuit court. While it was
being tried Mr. C. P. Huntington, then
president of the railroad, was in
Washington trying to secure a revo
cation of a portion of the indebted
ness. His attempts failed, but the
first court in which the case was tried

returned a verdict in favor ot' the
University.
The case was appealed and carried
to the next higher court where the
! decision of the lower court was af-
I firmed. Mrs. Stanford, through her
influence, had the court calendar
changed and the case was finally
brought up before the Supreme Court
of the United States in record time.
I'nhersitj »ins Cnsp.
On March 2, ISfMi thie Supreme
Court again supported the judgements
of the lower courts and the govern
ment had lost its suit. The Univer
sity had been saved.
During all this time while the litl
gation lasted the funds of the Uni
versity were tied up. There was not"
even sufficient money with which to
pay the salaries of the Faculty. It
was a period of heroic sacrifices.
During the entire two years, those
men of the Faculty who were loyal
to the University remained at their
posts in spite of financial difficulties
and the uncertainty as to whether the
University would ever again bp able
to liquidate its debts. The Institution,
however, weathered the storm, and
the judgement and loyalty of the
members of the Faculty and the
friends of the University was amply
repaid.
