# CARDINAL TEAMS ARE SATURDAY’S VICTORS
## VARSITY AND FRESHMEN LACK SNAP UNITY. Varsity Beats Barbarians, 31 to 3.—Freshmen Rally in Time to Defeat Palo Alto. 
### 
Neither of the two teams which rep
resented the Cardinal against visiting
fifteens on Stanford Field Saturday
afternoon came up to form. They,
together with the bleachers, showed
a dis-spiriting lack of "pep." So far
as the scores were concerned the
Stanford teams annexed victories, the
Varsity disposing of the Barbarians
to the tune of 31 to 3, and the Fresh
men defeating the Palo Alto High,
8-5.
In the Varsity-Barbarian contest,
the visitors used the seven man scrum
and were completely outclassed by the
gigantic Cardinal pack, who sent the
ball ont to their backs almost at will.
The entire Varsity was able to get
together for a score Ly means of using
their extra feight to take the ball
close to the Barbs line and then pass
it across. The Barbarians made the
most of the defensive tactics that
they had at their command to hold
down the score. Kicking to touch was
their main safety asset.
Individual Work Good.
As to the players; Geissler proved
an unusually aggressive player, Ris
ling was speedy, Harrigan a strong
contender, and in the pack, Dole and
Schaupp were strong workers. Brown
was a long distance gainer when it
came to reaching touch.
The Story of the Scores—First Half:
Worswick, Harrigan, Risling, Kern,
passing rush across from the Barbs
15. The score was tied when Brown
of the Barbarians tallied a 25 yard
boot from placement. Rucking at five
shot the ball over the line. Kern was
first to reach it and Brown converted.
Score: Varsity, 8; Barbarians, 3.
Second 11 si If:
Geissler spiraled 40 yards from
in id field. Schaupp secured and loped
across. Brown converted. Near mid
field Risling passed to Erb, who booted
35 yards to Dole to send him over for
a tally. From 10 the Harrigan-Geiss
ler combine were responsible for three
points. Gard soon duplicated and
Brown added a conversion. Wors
wick was on the end of the last scor
ing rush and Brown sent the leather
oval between the posts for a conver
sion. Final score: Stanford, 31; Bar
barians, 3.
Freshmen Slump.
In the game between the local high
school and 1915, the Freshmen took
a slump and the Palo Altans, resplen
dent in their new suits, nearly, scored
a victory over the Cardinal novices.
Kicking played a prominent part, in
which honors were divided between
Bell, of Palo Alto, and Haley, of Stan
ford. Palo Alto had several good
touch finders who were frequently in
evidence.
Steinhart, the little Freshman half,
made the most of his position, stick
ing behind the pack and following
up.
The first half saw the visitors hav
ing the advantage, kicking rather
than passing rushes filling out the
half. In the second half the visitors
pressed the Freshmen a little harder.
Then Davidson scored a spectacular
run when he secured at his 25 and ran
until downed at 1915's 25, one Fresh
man after another left sprawling on
the grass where they had misjudged
in tackling the swerving runner. Then
Soper, Frost and Templeton carried
the ball back in a passing rush.

Second 11 si If:
Geissler spiraled 40 yards from
in id field. Schaupp secured and loped
across. Brown converted. Near mid
field Risling passed to Erb, who booted
35 yards to Dole to send him over for
a tally. From 10 the Harrigan-Geiss
ler combine were responsible for three
points. Gard soon duplicated and
Brown added a conversion. Wors
wick was on the end of the last scor
ing rush and Brown sent the leather
oval between the posts for a conver
sion. Final score: Stanford, 31; Bar
barians, 3.
Freshmen Slump.
In the game between the local high
school and 1915, the Freshmen took
a slump and the Palo Altans, resplen
dent in their new suits, nearly, scored
a victory over the Cardinal novices.
Kicking played a prominent part, in
which honors were divided between
Bell, of Palo Alto, and Haley, of Stan
ford. Palo Alto had several good
touch finders who were frequently in
evidence.
Steinhart, the little Freshman half,
made the most of his position, stick
ing behind the pack and following
up.
The first half saw the visitors hav
ing the advantage, kicking rather
than passing rushes filling out the
half. In the second half the visitors
pressed the Freshmen a little harder.
Then Davidson scored a spectacular
run when he secured at his 25 and ran
until downed at 1915's 25, one Fresh
man after another left sprawling on
the grass where they had misjudged
in tackling the swerving runner. Then
Soper, Frost and Templeton carried
the ball back in a passing rush.
Neither of the two teams which rep
resented the Cardinal against visiting
fifteens on Stanford Field Saturday
afternoon came up to form. They,
together with the bleachers, showed
a dis-spiriting lack of "pep." So far
as the scores were concerned the
Stanford teams annexed victories, the
Varsity disposing of the Barbarians
to the tune of 31 to 3, and the Fresh
men defeating the Palo Alto High,
8-5.
In the Varsity-Barbarian contest,
the visitors used the seven man scrum
and were completely outclassed by the
gigantic Cardinal pack, who sent the
ball ont to their backs almost at will.
The entire Varsity was able to get
together for a score Ly means of using
their extra feight to take the ball
close to the Barbs line and then pass
it across. The Barbarians made the
most of the defensive tactics that
they had at their command to hold
down the score. Kicking to touch was
their main safety asset.
Individual Work Good.
As to the players; Geissler proved
an unusually aggressive player, Ris
ling was speedy, Harrigan a strong
contender, and in the pack, Dole and
Schaupp were strong workers. Brown
was a long distance gainer when it
came to reaching touch.
The Story of the Scores—First Half:
Worswick, Harrigan, Risling, Kern,
passing rush across from the Barbs
15. The score was tied when Brown
of the Barbarians tallied a 25 yard
boot from placement. Rucking at five
shot the ball over the line. Kern was
first to reach it and Brown converted.
Score: Varsity, 8; Barbarians, 3.
