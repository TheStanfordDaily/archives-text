# NEW BULLETIN-BOARDS WILL HOLD ALL NOTICES.
## Six Are Placed by Committee for Posting of Announcements and Advertising Signs. 
### 
Six large bulletin-boards are being
put up on the campus. The Execu
tive Committee planned the innovation
last year, but the work has been de
layed until the present time. All
signs, notices and posters that have
formerly been placed in the "Quad"
windows are now to be put on the
boards. This regulation was includ
ed in a resolution made by the Com
mittee last year. Permission to post
anything, however, must be obtained
from D. W. Burbank, graduate man
ager.
Very prominent positions have been
chosen for the boards, so that adver
tising by means of them will be much
more efficient than by the former
method. One is to be opposite the
Bookstore, another opposite the Law
steps, a third at the end of the Encina
walk nearest the. Quad, a fourth at
the end of the Roble walk nearest
the Quad, and two at the main Palo
Alto entrance to the campus, near the
County road.
S. McDonald, overseer of athletic
fields, is installing the boards.
Physiology Club To Have Speakers.
The Physiology Club has set Octo
ber 14 as the date for its meeting at
the Sigma Chi house. It is regretted
that this date conflicts witlx the Soph
omore jolly-up. Three prominent
medical men had been engaged to
speak that evening, before the date
of the jolly-up was changed. The
speeches will be upon such subjects
as will interest Pre-medical students.
Music and refreshments are on the
program. "Rough neck" dress may
be expected.
