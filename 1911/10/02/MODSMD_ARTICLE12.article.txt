# Fremont Met 1915 Today.

### 
Fremont High's crack rugby fifteen
met the Cardinal Freshmen on Stan
ford Field this afternoon at 4:45. This
was the only chance for the city high
schoolers to play the first-year team,
and special permission was granted
to their fifteen to make a mid week
trip away from the city to come here.
