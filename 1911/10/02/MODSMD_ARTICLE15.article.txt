# BASEBALL PRACTICE STARTS TO-MORROW
## HEFTING OF CANDIDATES SET IN ROOM 68. New Field Now Ready for Tuesday and Thursday Play.â€”Outside Game Saturday. 
### 
Fall baseball practice starts to
morrow. Captain S. W. Gilflllan, '12,
has called a meeting of all baseball
men for that day at 1:10 in room 68.
The new baseball field is so far
enough completed to allow prelim
inary work. Practice will be held on
Tuesdays and Thursdays and will con
tinue until the rains. Games with
outside teams may be scheduled for
Saturday mornings.
As yet nothing is known of the new
men, but under the guidance of J. D.
Peters, '11, and A. Shafer, *15, their
powers will be noted. Peters has
just returned from a successful sea
son with the Trenton Club in the Tri-
State League. Shafer is a former mem
ber of the New York Giants, and of
the Santa Clara nine of 1909. These
men will, with Captain Gilflllan, have
charge of the coaching.
Eight veterans are now in college
and should make strong bids Jfoi*
their former places. They are: Cap
tain Gilflllan, '12, pitcher: A. M. Don
ovan, '12, center-field; M. B. Hen
shaw, '12, left field; H. A. Reeger, '13,
right field: L. Cass, '13, second base;
L. Childs, '13, left field; Z. A. Terry,
'15, short-stop; and M. Obear, '12,
center-fielder of the 1909 Cardinal
Varsity.
