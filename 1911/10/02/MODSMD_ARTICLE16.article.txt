## Superior Team Work Aided By Wino Contribute to the Cardinal Downfall. 
### 
Handicapped by a lack of coaching
and playing against a strong wind
Stanford's soccer eleven suffered de
feat by a score of 1 to 1 in their ini
tial contest of the season played at
Fruitvale with the crack Independent
team Saturday afternoon. The su
perior teamwork of the trans-bay ag
gregation and the advantages of play
ing on a familiar field with a favoring
wind was the cause of the defeat of
the Cardinal soccerites. but the local
players made their opponents extend
themselves to defeat them. The only
Stanford indenture on the score board
was the result of a clever piece of
work on the part of Pnng, the Cardinal
center forward.
The line-up of the Cardinals was as
printe 1 last Friday.
