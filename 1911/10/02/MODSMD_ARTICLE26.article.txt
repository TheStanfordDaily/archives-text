# Juniors Slow in Getting Pictures.
## 
### 
That the Juniors are unusually be
hind time in having their pictures
placed in the Quad, is the opinion of
S. W. Guthrie, business manager of
the year-book. The assessments also
are being paid in very slowly, and lack
of funds has hindered the preliminary
work of the publishing. All pictures
should lie taken within the next few
days, since the Quad management plan
to have the first part of the volume
set ui> and printed by the end of the
semester. This year the book is to
contain a record of all the events of
next semester, including crew and
track results, as was done last spring,
and this will necessitate an early
start on other material It will be
impossible to include class pictures
taken after the holidays, as the con
tract with the photographer expires
at that time. Address remittances to
