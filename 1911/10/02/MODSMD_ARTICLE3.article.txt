Twenty years old. Compared to
other universities in age, a mere be
ginning. But in a fifth of a century

Stanford has become a
world university. Her
graduates are doing
the world's work in

every part of the globe. The enroll
ment includes men and 'women from
every land. In twenty years Stanford
University has become known and
respected for her scholastic standards
side by side with the oldest and most
famous institutions.
As the student newspaper, The Daily
Palo Alto asks the students of the
University to remember that day, Octo
ber first, eighteen ninety-one, and to
keep in mind what it meant for them
and those who follow after they have
gone. We ask them to reverence the
feeling and purpose that gave to Cali
fornia and America a great and dis
tinctive University.
We take this opportunity to respect
fully offer our congratulations to Pre

brought the university from its begin

to the end of twenty successful years;
to those eleven members of the Facul

a. fifth of a century, Messrs. Branner,
Jenkins. Anderson, Stillman, San

Elliott, and Newcofllgf, and to Other
members of the Faculty who have
done service a score of y#$ars. To the
many friends of the University every
where. the Alumni and all who have
entered the Stanford gates, we fend
greeting.
To the Board of Trustees we giv'e
our thanks for whatever they have
done with sincere purpose and in good
faith; and more especially for main
taining for us the University grounds,
perhaps the most beautiful in the
world. May any unpleasantness that
has occurred in the past twenty years
be foruottpn. and a new era betrin.
