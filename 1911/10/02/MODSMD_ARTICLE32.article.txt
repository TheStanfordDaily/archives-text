# SCHOLARSHIP OFFERED BY THE HARVARD CLUB.
## Change in System of Appointment Renders Money Available for Stanford Men This Year. 
### 
That the Harvard Club Scholarship
will be awarded according to merits,
and nut upon the principle of alterna
tion between Stanford and the Univer
sity of California, as it has in the past,
is welcome news to the present Seni
ors. If there had been no change,
appointment to the scholarship would
be open only to students of Califor
nia this year, since the present holder
of the scholarship is F. P. Anderson,
'11, who majors in the Romanic Lan
guages department.
The scholarship is offered by the
Harvard Club, of San Francisco, for
the purpose of aiding graduates of the
University of California and Stanford
to pursue graduate work at Harvard
University. Applications for appoint
ment to the scholarship for the year
of 1912-12 should be handed in to the
Registrar on or before the first day of
March, 1912. Students of both univer
sities may apply for appointment. The
scholarship has an income of $400, and
is given to a new applicant each
year.
