## MEETINGS CALLED THIS WEEK FOR THAT PURPOSE. Sophomores to Hear Plans Tomorrow, Freshmen on Wednesday. Chandler Appointed Assistant. 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon at 1:10 in room'
68 a. meeting will be held to explain I
the nature and benefits to be derived ;
from the Stanford Union to the Sopho
more men of the University. On Wed
nesday afternoon at the same time
and place a similar meeting will be
held for the members of the class of
1915. These announcements are made
to-day by Chairman A. W. Ambrose,
'13, of the committee appointed to col
lect funds for the union. He further
announces that he has added to his j
corps as a special assistant, W. R.
Chandler, '13. Besides other duties.
Chandler will till the position of cor
responding secretary for the Campus
Committee.
At the meeting tomorrow for the
l Sophomores E. W. Smith, '99, Perma-
I nent Secretary of the Union, and A. E.
Roth, '09, Student Adviser, will be the
speakers. They will tell of the
growth of the Union idea; the orig
inal contribution by H. C. Hoover, '9T>;
the enthusiasm attending the original
Union assembly; and the necessity of
securing additional funds to insure
the consummation of the original idea.
They will show the underclassmen
how they are to be benefited by the
early completion of the Union, to a
far greater extent than the other
classes now in the University.
When the Freshmen meet on Wed
nesday the speakers will be the same
with the addition of Student Body
President K. L. Schaupp, '12. Both
the meetings will be short so that no
one will be detained from afternoon
classes.
"We must look largely to the under
classmen", said Ambrose to-day, "for
the completion of the $25,000 fund
necessary to start building operations.
$5,000 is needed before building will
begin. We expect that the men who
have signed pledges will be making
regular payments in the near future
so that the pledged sum may be paid
off by the specified time in next March.
This will not be sufficient, however, to
give us the $25,000. We must have
additional funds from the underclass
men."
Chairman Ambrose asks that all
upperclassmen in fraternities im
press on,their underclassmen the ne
cessity of attending these meetingsâ€”
the one for the 1914 men tomorrow,
and for the 1915 men on Wednesday.
If possible, he requests that the under
classmen be sent to the meetings. Not
only c'oes be wish that the fraternity
upperclassmen urge their underclass
men, and particularly the Freshmen
t/> attend the meeting, but he also
asks that all upperclassmen who have
the good of the Union at heart, see
that some underclassmen whom they
kvow attend the meeting.
