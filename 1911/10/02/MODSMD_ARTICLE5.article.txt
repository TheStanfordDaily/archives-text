# ARTISTIC SUCCESS IS SCORED FRIDAY NIGHT
## PROFESSIONAL FINISH GIVEN TO DRAMA. "World and His Wife," Pleases.—Miss Workman, and Seward and Brown Star. 
### F.C. Woodward 
Again Sword and Sandals has dem
onstrated its worth to the University
community. This society has an en
viable reputation among student or
ganizations for seriousness of purpose
and excellence of attainment. It's
annual production is always awaited
with confidence that it will be well
worth seeing, and when the curtain
rises one settles down in his seat
with the comfortable feeling that he
can be as critical as he likes —that
he will not be called upon to indulge
the slips and breaks, the slowness and
awkwardness, of the ordinary amateur
performance.
Adaptation of the "(Jaleoto."
The play presented Friday evening,
"The World and His Wife," is an
adaptation by Charles Frederick Nird
linger, of Echegaray's "El Gran Gale
oto." The theme is already familiar
to the readers of the "Daily Palo Alto."
I am not acquainted with Echegaray's
work, but in the English form the play
impressed me as one of exceptional
power. It is true that in the last act
Ernesto's confession of love for Teo
dora, before the body of her heroic
husband is cold, and more particular
ly Teodora's unprotesting acceptance
of it, comes with something of a shock
to the highly sensitized feelings of the
audience. One wonders if the author
might not have accomplished his pur
pose with greater art by concluding
with such a declaration by Ernesto of
devotion to Teodora and of defiance
to her traducers as would have just
hinted at the awakening of love." But
with this possible exception the play
moves with swiftness and cumulative
force. And what makes it a particu
larly happy choice for undergraduate
production is that, unlike so many of
the serious dramas of today, it is prac
tically free from the cynical and mor
bid sentiments that one dislikes to
hear, even in the theatre, from the lips
of healthy, wholesome, young men and
women.
First Mention to Miss Workman.
Of those in the cast. Miss Work
man—an artist such as one rarely sees
on the amateur stage—is entitled to
first mention. The role of Teodora,
the romantic but loyal wife of Don
Julian, was well suited to her powers,
and, besides investing it with a great
deal of personal charm, she played it
with a nice appreciation of all it#
subtleties and with admirably re
strained emotional intensity. in the
climax of the last act she was especi
ally good. Every gesture was elo
quent; every expression carried its
meaning. Her horror-stricken retreat
from the death-chamber of Don Julian
was something one will not soon
forget. ' "" ,
Sewanl and Brown Surcessfui.
In the two other leading rotes, Mr.
Seward and Mr. Brown Were about
equally successful. Mr. Steward's
voice and presence aided not a little
in the realization Of the spirited Don
Ernesto, find his worff throughout'the
evening wfis characterized by the
poise and Assurance of the experienced
actor. In the third act his denuncia
tion of Dion Severo and his kind, and
confession of love for Teodora
were spoken with a fiery exaltation
that drove home with telling effect
the lesson of the play. Mr. Brown,
who was remembered for good work
in "The Setiator" last year, revealed
unsuspected talent. He somehow
managed to lie more vividly the Span
ish Nobleman than did Mr. Seward,
and though he" ctmimenced so quietly
us to be heard With difficulty, he was
thereby enabled, in the critical part
r>f the play, to suggest that reserve of
power which is always so Impressive.
Kern \ot Well Cast.
Mr. Kern ought to have" a legal rent

edy against the man who persuaded
him to take the role of the haughty
and cruel Don Severo. As well ask
VV. H. Crane to play Macbeth! tis no
reflection upon Mr. Kern's recognized
ability as a comedian to say that he
simply could not do the work required
of him Friday night. That he stuck
to the task is a tribute to his courage
and perseverance. Miss Parkinson,
in the somewhat less ungrateful role
of Donna Mercedes, achieved an im
pressive dignity and was in every way
thoroughly satisfying. Mr. Beman, as
the English attache, was capital. He
had some of the cleverest lines in the
play and invariably made the most of
them. Mr. Turpin, as the youthful
Pepito—by no means an easy role —ac-
quitted himself well, and Mr. Ingra
ham managed to give an amusing
touch of individuality to the insignifi
cant part of the concierge.

viable reputation among student or
ganizations for seriousness of purpose
and excellence of attainment. It's
annual production is always awaited
with confidence that it will be well
worth seeing, and when the curtain
rises one settles down in his seat

can be as critical as he likes —that
he will not be called upon to indulge
the slips and breaks, the slowness and
awkwardness, of the ordinary amateur
performance.
Adaptation of the "(Jaleoto."
The play presented Friday evening,
"The World and His Wife," is an
adaptation by Charles Frederick Nird
linger, of Echegaray's "El Gran Gale
oto." The theme is already familiar
to the readers of the "Daily Palo Alto."
I am not acquainted with Echegaray's
work, but in the English form the play
impressed me as one of exceptional
power. It is true that in the last act
Ernesto's confession of love for Teo
dora, before the body of her heroic
husband is cold, and more particular
ly Teodora's unprotesting acceptance
of it, comes with something of a shock
to the highly sensitized feelings of the
audience. One wonders if the author
might not have accomplished his pur
pose with greater art by concluding
with such a declaration by Ernesto of
devotion to Teodora and of defiance
to her traducers as would have just
hinted at the awakening of love." But
with this possible exception the play
moves with swiftness and cumulative
force. And what makes it a particu
larly happy choice for undergraduate
production is that, unlike so many of
the serious dramas of today, it is prac
tically free from the cynical and mor
bid sentiments that one dislikes to
hear, even in the theatre, from the lips
of healthy, wholesome, young men and
women.
First Mention to Miss Workman.
Of those in the cast. Miss Work
man—an artist such as one rarely sees
on the amateur stage—is entitled to
first mention. The role of Teodora,
the romantic but loyal wife of Don
Julian, was well suited to her powers,
and, besides investing it with a great
deal of personal charm, she played it
with a nice appreciation of all it#
subtleties and with admirably re
strained emotional intensity. in the
climax of the last act she was especi
ally good. Every gesture was elo
quent; every expression carried its
meaning. Her horror-stricken retreat
from the death-chamber of Don Julian
was something one will not soon
forget. ' "" ,
Sewanl and Brown Surcessfui.
In the two other leading rotes, Mr.
Seward and Mr. Brown Were about
equally successful. Mr. Steward's
voice and presence aided not a little
in the realization Of the spirited Don
Ernesto, find his worff throughout'the
evening wfis characterized by the
poise and Assurance of the experienced
actor. In the third act his denuncia
tion of Dion Severo and his kind, and
confession of love for Teodora
were spoken with a fiery exaltation
that drove home with telling effect
the lesson of the play. Mr. Brown,
who was remembered for good work
in "The Setiator" last year, revealed
unsuspected talent. He somehow
managed to lie more vividly the Span
ish Nobleman than did Mr. Seward,
and though he" ctmimenced so quietly
us to be heard With difficulty, he was
thereby enabled, in the critical part
r>f the play, to suggest that reserve of
power which is always so Impressive.
Kern \ot Well Cast.
Mr. Kern ought to have" a legal rent

edy against the man who persuaded
him to take the role of the haughty
and cruel Don Severo. As well ask
VV. H. Crane to play Macbeth! tis no
reflection upon Mr. Kern's recognized
ability as a comedian to say that he
simply could not do the work required
of him Friday night. That he stuck
to the task is a tribute to his courage
and perseverance. Miss Parkinson,
in the somewhat less ungrateful role
of Donna Mercedes, achieved an im
pressive dignity and was in every way
thoroughly satisfying. Mr. Beman, as
the English attache, was capital. He
had some of the cleverest lines in the
play and invariably made the most of
them. Mr. Turpin, as the youthful
Pepito—by no means an easy role —ac-
quitted himself well, and Mr. Ingra
ham managed to give an amusing
touch of individuality to the insignifi
cant part of the concierge.
Again Sword and Sandals has dem
onstrated its worth to the University
community. This society has an en
viable reputation among student or
ganizations for seriousness of purpose
and excellence of attainment. It's
annual production is always awaited
