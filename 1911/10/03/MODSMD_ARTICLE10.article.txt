# SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS SUBSCRIBED FOR UNION
## SOPHOMORES PLEDGE BIG SUM TO-DAY. Meeting is Addressed by Roth and Smith.—Amount Raised in Fifteen Minutes. 
### 
The sum of six hundred dollars was I
subscribed by the men of the Sopho
more Class in fifteen minutes at a
meeting held to-day to raise funds for
the Stanford Union. This is con
sidered by Chairman A. W. Ambrose,
13, of the Campus Stanford Union
Committee, to be a very satisfactory
addition to the funds by the men of
1914. About one in four of those pres
ent filled out the blanks pledging
money.
The meeting was addressed by Stu
dent Adviser A. E. Roth, '09, and E.
W. Smith, '99, the permanent secre
tary of the Union. Roth explained in
detail to the men the purposes and
plans of the institution. He told of
the origination of the plan in the
mind of H. C. Hoover, '95, of the elev
en thousand dollars subscribed by
Hoover to start the fund; of the na
ture of the structure as planned—as a
meeting place for the men of the
University, and a headquarters for the
student body. He continued by tell
ing of the sites that had been con
sidered for the structure, and of the
certainty of commencing on the actual
work of construction as soon as the
necessary sum had been raised.
Smith followed Roth as a sneaker.
He explained the present financial
condition of the Union. According to
bis statements it will be necessary to
raise $10,000 before the work of the
I nion can be commenced. This means
that at present about $15,000 has been
collected.
"When we have collected $25,000",
said Smith, "the work on the building
can begin." The Trustees of the Uni
versity will advance the remaining
half of the full amount if we raise the
first half. They want the assurance
of the student support to the Union.
The alumni have paid in as much as
they will until some actual building
operations commence.
At the close of the meeting the
pledge blanks were passed around and
signed by all present, who wished to
subscribe for the Union.
"At present we are at a dead center.
We need the stimulus of the under
classmen's subscriptions to drive us
beyond this point. if the present
student body makes it plain to the
alumni that they take the Union ser
iously, the alumni themselves will in
crease the amounts which they have
subscribed. Now they all say that
they will do nothing more until build
ing operations commence, and that
they will give no more financial sup
port until this happens. And not one
of them can be persuaded to do any
thing until the students who are to
get the benefits of the Union show a
will'niness to assist in its construc
tion." said E. W. Smith Permanent
Secretary of the Union at the meeting
