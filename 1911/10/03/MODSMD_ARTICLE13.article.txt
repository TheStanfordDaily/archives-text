# MEMBERSHIP CAMPAIGN TO BEGIN TOMORROW
## Y.M.C.A. WILL TRY TO ENLIST NEW MEN. Stanford Organization Needs More Students and Money to Carry on Extensive Work. 
### 
Tomorrow morning the Y. M. C. A.
will begin its annual college wide
membership campaign, and will at
tempt to reach all the students of the
University in the next few days and
if possible get each of them to take
some active part in the work. Mem
bership in the Association means
that a man shall take a deep interest
in the work, give it his moral and fi
nancial support, and also approve of
the organization and its policies.
Four years ago there were but 14/
members. Last year 450
joined the Association, and this year
the goal is set at 700. The most prom
inent men of Stanford have already
identified themselves as members of
the Association and given their hearty
endorsements to its work.
The problem of furnishing work
for all the students who need it to
make their way through college has
practically been solved by the organ
ization. Over 225 students have come
to the Y. M. C. A. for information con
cerning employment, rooms, board and
the like, and in nearly every instance
the institution has been able to give
satisfaction. Last year $5000 worth
of work was distributed to those who
needed it. 1000 handbooks have been
printed and these, with letters of wel
come, have been sent to all the new
students.
In the social and religious educa
tional lines the work of the Associa
tion has been exceptionally fine. Al
ready over 200 'men are receiving in
struction in 12 Bible Classes, and it
is expected that 350 will be the total
before the year is over.
. Weekly meetings are held every
Wednesday evening and prominent
men are engaged to address the stu
dents.
The Board of Directors composed
of business men and members of the
Faculty assist in raising funds for the
maintainence of the work. This year
they will attempt to raise over $100?
of the $3500 needed. Already six sub
scriptions of $100 each have been se
cured. The Board of Directors audit
the books of the Association each year
and last year's expenditures are as
follows:
Bible Study $ 75.20*
Men's Room 134.64
Finance Committee 337.15
Supervision and office 1983.98
Meetings 192.40
Social 112.40
New Students 23.45
State and International
Committees 40.00
Conventions 67.30
Miscellaneous 19.05
Total $2985.57
During the next few days every man
will bo given an opportunity to help
the work in the coming year by mak
i ing himself a member of the Y. M.
C. A., and paying his membership fee
I of one dollar.
