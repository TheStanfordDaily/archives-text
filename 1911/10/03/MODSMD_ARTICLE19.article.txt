Stanford boasts ot' her sportsman
ship. Yet at one of the best and clos
est games of the football season the
bleachers, composed of university men,
hoot and jeer at worthy opponents
who dispute some minor point of the
rugby rules. That sounds very much
like childishness on the face of it, with
a touch of rowdyism added to it. Such'
principles of conduct, if carried to an
extreme, would destroy the Stanford
idea of good sportsmanship that has
been built up gradually through the
years. An influence like this on the
bleachers does not go well with the
splendid spirit instilled into the teams
on the turf each year by such men
as our coaches have been in the past
few reasons.
But the fault lies not only* with the
average students themselves, but
with the yell-leaders as well. They
are not performing their duty when
they do not do all in their power to
stop these jeers. We realize that the
yell-leading staff is at a disadvantage
at this time because of try-outs for
assistants, yet at the same time. this,
perhaps their most important func
tion, should be the last thing to be
forgotten. The yell-leader must be
the gentleman and the good sports
man for the bleachers.
