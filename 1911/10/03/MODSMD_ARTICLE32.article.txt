# FRESHMEN DOWNED BY FREMONT'S FAST TEAM
## 1915 LOSES FIRST CONTEST OF SEASON. In Battle of Forwards Stanford Rallies Are Unable to Utilize Full Strength. 
### 
As a ninth hour engagement, the
Fremont High fifteen met and defeated
the Cardinal Freshmen on Stanford
Field, yesterday afternoon, at 4:45, by
the score of 8 to 5. The game went
very much like the way of all the
Freshmen games, but with a changed
ending. The first half gave a slight
advantage to the first-year men, just
enough for them to break through
the visitors line for a tally. In the
last period frequent changes in the
line up of the Freshmen were made,
because of the recent frequency of
games for the younger players. On
the other hand, the Fremont lads had
cancelled their game scheduled for
last Saturday to be fresh to meet the
Stanford babies.
The visitors used the seven man
scrum and during the first half they
could not cope with the Cardinal
eight. Although Fremont held their
own, yet the Freshmen were able to
heel out the ball steadily to their
backs. The second half saw a
reversal.
The Fremont fifteen is a splendid
team. Their forwards were fast fol
lowers up and played an aggressive
game, bringing havoc to 1915's back
field rushes. Their backs, however,
were good for little else than kicking.
Trio of Star.-.
Steinhart, Templeton and Haley
formed a trio of Cardinal players who
played the lion's part for their side.
If better support had been accorded
them the story of the afternoon's work
would undoubtedly have been different.
Steinhart was a great half and used
his boot to good advantage to find
touch. Templeton time after time
broke through the Fremont line with
the ball, but was smothered with none
of his teammates ready to take the
pass. Haley's boot was a substantial
touch finder.
The Freshmen scored in the first
half when Templeton booted the ball
into the air at Fremont's 15. Has
kins failed to mark and a long pass
rush down the Stanford line sent Ross
swerving across. Clark's conversion
made the score 5 to 0.
In the last period the Freshmen
fought hard in their own territory, but
twice from 1915's 5 Fremont went
through to carry the ball over. First,
VVieden drove across and was follow
ed a few minutes later by Haskins.
McElrath converted the second try.

As a ninth hour engagement, the
Fremont High fifteen met and defeated
the Cardinal Freshmen on Stanford
Field, yesterday afternoon, at 4:45, by
the score of 8 to 5. The game went
very much like the way of all the
Freshmen games, but with a changed
ending. The first half gave a slight
advantage to the first-year men, just
enough for them to break through
the visitors line for a tally. In the
last period frequent changes in the
line up of the Freshmen were made,
because of the recent frequency of
games for the younger players. On
the other hand, the Fremont lads had
cancelled their game scheduled for
last Saturday to be fresh to meet the
Stanford babies.
The visitors used the seven man
scrum and during the first half they
could not cope with the Cardinal
eight. Although Fremont held their
own, yet the Freshmen were able to
heel out the ball steadily to their
backs. The second half saw a
reversal.
The Fremont fifteen is a splendid
team. Their forwards were fast fol
lowers up and played an aggressive
game, bringing havoc to 1915's back
field rushes. Their backs, however,
were good for little else than kicking.
Trio of Star.-.
Steinhart, Templeton and Haley
formed a trio of Cardinal players who
played the lion's part for their side.
If better support had been accorded
them the story of the afternoon's work
would undoubtedly have been different.
Steinhart was a great half and used
his boot to good advantage to find
touch. Templeton time after time
broke through the Fremont line with
the ball, but was smothered with none
of his teammates ready to take the
pass. Haley's boot was a substantial
touch finder.
The Freshmen scored in the first
half when Templeton booted the ball
into the air at Fremont's 15. Has
kins failed to mark and a long pass
rush down the Stanford line sent Ross
swerving across. Clark's conversion
made the score 5 to 0.
In the last period the Freshmen
fought hard in their own territory, but
twice from 1915's 5 Fremont went
through to carry the ball over. First,
VVieden drove across and was follow
ed a few minutes later by Haskins.
McElrath converted the second try.
