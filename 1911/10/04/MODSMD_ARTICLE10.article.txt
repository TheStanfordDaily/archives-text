Pledging almost two thousand dol
lars in five minutes for the Stanford
Union, the Freshmen of the Univer
sity this afternoon completely outdis
tanced their rivals of the class of 1914
and set up a mark over three time.',
as big as that made by the second
year men at the meeting held for them
yesterday. Of this sum $100 was
pledged in actual cash, to he paid to
day and about $200 more was promised
before the end of October. This re
duces to $3000 the total amount of
money to he pledged before the $f>o,
000 required is reached.
The meeting was an enthusiastic
one in a quiet way. The first year men
listened with interest to the explana
tions of the Union and its purposes as
set before them by A. E. Roth, Student
Adviser, K. L. Schaupp, '12, President
of the Student Body, and E. W. Smith,
Permanent Secretary of the Union.
Roth was the lirst speaker called
upon. He said in part:
Union's True Meaning.
"The upperclassmen of the Univer
sity have a good idea of the aims and

plans of the Stanford Union. But
there seems to be some doubt in the
minds of the underclassmen as to its
true meaning and worth as a factor
in our life at Stanford.
"Some three years ago, when H. C.
Hoover, '9:., visited the campus after
an absence of many years, he saw at
once that conditions were absolutely
j different from what they were in the
i days when he was an undergraduate.
. He realized that something was needed
I to unify the student body to a greater
j degree and he decided that the Union
j idea, as exemplified in other univer
sities, offered the best solution. With
I this object in mind he pledged on his
| own account $1 1,000 to the Union.
'"Arrangements were completed
| whereby the control of the Union was
j to be vested in a Board of Trustees,
| who were to supervise the collection*
jof funds. An active campaign was
begun. Two years ago $14,000 was
, pledged by the undergraduates of the
University.
Like liiir City Club.
"When it is completed the Union
! will he run on the plan of the big city
clubs. It will be a common meeting
ground for all the men of the Univer
-1 sity. Jolly-ups will be held here in-
I stead of in Palo Alto. All the organ
izations of the University will have
rooms in t lie building. This Union is
no idle dream. It is a crying need.
Stanford needs the Union as badly as
it needs anything. What we need now
; is the co-operation of the underclass-
I men."
Student Body President Schaupp fol
lowed Roth. He spoke in part as
follows:
"None of you can realize what this
Union is goiirr to mean to the Student
