Pledging almost two thousand dol
lars in five minutes for the Stanford
Union, the Freshmen of the Univer
sity this afternoon completely outdis
tanced their rivals of the class of 1914
and set up a mark over three time.',
as big as that made by the second
year men at the meeting held for them
yesterday. Of this sum $100 was
pledged in actual cash, to he paid to
day and about $200 more was promised
before the end of October. This re
duces to $3000 the total amount of
money to he pledged before the $f>o,
000 required is reached.
The meeting was an enthusiastic
one in a quiet way. The first year men
listened with interest to the explana
tions of the Union and its purposes as
set before them by A. E. Roth, Student
Adviser, K. L. Schaupp, '12, President
of the Student Body, and E. W. Smith,
Permanent Secretary of the Union.
Roth was the lirst speaker called
upon. He said in part:
Union's True Meaning.
"The upperclassmen of the Univer
sity have a good idea of the aims and

plans of the Stanford Union. But
there seems to be some doubt in the
minds of the underclassmen as to its
true meaning and worth as a factor
in our life at Stanford.
"Some three years ago, when H. C.
Hoover, '9:., visited the campus after
an absence of many years, he saw at
once that conditions were absolutely
j different from what they were in the
i days when he was an undergraduate.
. He realized that something was needed
I to unify the student body to a greater
j degree and he decided that the Union
j idea, as exemplified in other univer
sities, offered the best solution. With
I this object in mind he pledged on his
| own account $1 1,000 to the Union.
'"Arrangements were completed
| whereby the control of the Union was
j to be vested in a Board of Trustees,
| who were to supervise the collection*
jof funds. An active campaign was
begun. Two years ago $14,000 was
, pledged by the undergraduates of the
University.
Like liiir City Club.
"When it is completed the Union
! will he run on the plan of the big city
clubs. It will be a common meeting
ground for all the men of the Univer
-1 sity. Jolly-ups will be held here in-
I stead of in Palo Alto. All the organ
izations of the University will have
rooms in t lie building. This Union is
no idle dream. It is a crying need.
Stanford needs the Union as badly as
it needs anything. What we need now
; is the co-operation of the underclass-
I men."
Student Body President Schaupp fol
lowed Roth. He spoke in part as
follows:
"None of you can realize what this
Union is goiirr to mean to the Student
Body. In the early days of the Univer
sity it was unnecessary. The student
body and the faculty were much small
er. The Stanford's home was the
general meeting place for all. and all
the members of the university were
acquainted. As the institution grew
larger this became more and more
impossible, until now the Freshman
enters here with the idea that he has
no friends and that the Faculty are
his deadly enemies. We want to get
rid of this.
To Consolidate Students.
"We also want to get rid of the
small factional units that now exist
around the University. The Hall is
more or less of a unit but the men
there are not. all acquainted. Each
house on the Row is a unit. We want
to consolidate them all into a Ann
and loyal student body.
"At the Union you will have the op
portunity to meet other men. Through
it you will increase your friendships
among the student body and the fa
culty alike. The Union will lie for
you as much as for anyone else.
You are going to be the men to en
joy it."
"I need," said Smith when called
upon, "live thousand dollars more in
pledges and ten thousand more in
hand. Then the Union will become a
reality to you all. The Union will be
yours. You can meet trustee, profes
sor, and student there on an equal
basis —as Stanford men.
"This is the first chance that the
Freshmen have had to take an active
part in a University enterprise. What
will you do to live up to your part?
"Cold Cash" Wonted.
"With the right start we can get
the building going in a year. Now is
the accepted time. It is more impor
tant right now for me to get ten dol
lars in actual money than fifty dollars
in pledges.
"There is no 'hot air' here. We
could get up a lot of excitement if we
wished and we could make you all
stand up on your chairs and yell 'I
pledge a million dollars,' or something
like that. But we are not going at
that way. We want you to go at this
seriously. 1 am talking to you seri
ously. 1 am Smith. '99, talking to you
Smith, '15."
As Smith passed around the pledge
slips there was a buzz of excitement
over the entire room. It. could bo seen
that the men were pondering the ques
tion seriously. There was but one
Freshman who left, the room before
the meeting broke up and failed to see
his class make an enviable record in
furthering the cause of the Union.

Pledging almost two thousand dol
lars in five minutes for the Stanford
Union, the Freshmen of the Univer
sity this afternoon completely outdis
tanced their rivals of the class of 1914
and set up a mark over three time.',
as big as that made by the second
year men at the meeting held for them
yesterday. Of this sum $100 was
pledged in actual cash, to he paid to
day and about $200 more was promised
before the end of October. This re
duces to $3000 the total amount of
money to he pledged before the $f>o,
000 required is reached.
The meeting was an enthusiastic
one in a quiet way. The first year men
listened with interest to the explana
tions of the Union and its purposes as
set before them by A. E. Roth, Student
Adviser, K. L. Schaupp, '12, President
of the Student Body, and E. W. Smith,
Permanent Secretary of the Union.
Roth was the lirst speaker called
upon. He said in part:
Union's True Meaning.
"The upperclassmen of the Univer
sity have a good idea of the aims and

plans of the Stanford Union. But
there seems to be some doubt in the
minds of the underclassmen as to its
true meaning and worth as a factor
in our life at Stanford.
"Some three years ago, when H. C.
Hoover, '9:., visited the campus after
an absence of many years, he saw at
once that conditions were absolutely
j different from what they were in the
i days when he was an undergraduate.
. He realized that something was needed
I to unify the student body to a greater
j degree and he decided that the Union
j idea, as exemplified in other univer
sities, offered the best solution. With
I this object in mind he pledged on his
| own account $1 1,000 to the Union.
'"Arrangements were completed
| whereby the control of the Union was
j to be vested in a Board of Trustees,
| who were to supervise the collection*
jof funds. An active campaign was
begun. Two years ago $14,000 was
, pledged by the undergraduates of the
University.
Like liiir City Club.
"When it is completed the Union
! will he run on the plan of the big city
clubs. It will be a common meeting
ground for all the men of the Univer
-1 sity. Jolly-ups will be held here in-
I stead of in Palo Alto. All the organ
izations of the University will have
rooms in t lie building. This Union is
no idle dream. It is a crying need.
Stanford needs the Union as badly as
it needs anything. What we need now
; is the co-operation of the underclass-
I men."
Student Body President Schaupp fol
lowed Roth. He spoke in part as
follows:
"None of you can realize what this
Union is goiirr to mean to the Student
Body. In the early days of the Univer
sity it was unnecessary. The student
body and the faculty were much small
er. The Stanford's home was the
general meeting place for all. and all
the members of the university were
acquainted. As the institution grew
larger this became more and more
impossible, until now the Freshman
enters here with the idea that he has
no friends and that the Faculty are
his deadly enemies. We want to get
rid of this.
To Consolidate Students.
"We also want to get rid of the
small factional units that now exist
around the University. The Hall is
more or less of a unit but the men
there are not. all acquainted. Each
house on the Row is a unit. We want
to consolidate them all into a Ann
and loyal student body.
"At the Union you will have the op
portunity to meet other men. Through
it you will increase your friendships
among the student body and the fa
culty alike. The Union will lie for
you as much as for anyone else.
You are going to be the men to en
joy it."
"I need," said Smith when called
upon, "live thousand dollars more in
pledges and ten thousand more in
hand. Then the Union will become a
reality to you all. The Union will be
yours. You can meet trustee, profes
sor, and student there on an equal
basis —as Stanford men.
"This is the first chance that the
Freshmen have had to take an active
part in a University enterprise. What
will you do to live up to your part?
"Cold Cash" Wonted.
"With the right start we can get
the building going in a year. Now is
the accepted time. It is more impor
tant right now for me to get ten dol
lars in actual money than fifty dollars
in pledges.
"There is no 'hot air' here. We

that the men were pondering the ques

his class make an enviable record in
furthering the cause of the Union.

Pledging almost two thousand dol
lars in five minutes for the Stanford
Union, the Freshmen of the Univer
sity this afternoon completely outdis
tanced their rivals of the class of 1914
and set up a mark over three time.',
as big as that made by the second
year men at the meeting held for them
yesterday. Of this sum $100 was
pledged in actual cash, to he paid to
day and about $200 more was promised
before the end of October. This re
duces to $3000 the total amount of
money to he pledged before the $f>o,
000 required is reached.
The meeting was an enthusiastic
one in a quiet way. The first year men
listened with interest to the explana
tions of the Union and its purposes as
set before them by A. E. Roth, Student
Adviser, K. L. Schaupp, '12, President
of the Student Body, and E. W. Smith,
Permanent Secretary of the Union.
Roth was the lirst speaker called
upon. He said in part:
Union's True Meaning.
"The upperclassmen of the Univer
sity have a good idea of the aims and

plans of the Stanford Union. But
there seems to be some doubt in the
minds of the underclassmen as to its
true meaning and worth as a factor
in our life at Stanford.
"Some three years ago, when H. C.
Hoover, '9:., visited the campus after
an absence of many years, he saw at
once that conditions were absolutely
j different from what they were in the
i days when he was an undergraduate.
. He realized that something was needed
I to unify the student body to a greater
j degree and he decided that the Union
j idea, as exemplified in other univer
sities, offered the best solution. With
I this object in mind he pledged on his
| own account $1 1,000 to the Union.
'"Arrangements were completed
| whereby the control of the Union was
j to be vested in a Board of Trustees,
| who were to supervise the collection*
jof funds. An active campaign was
begun. Two years ago $14,000 was
, pledged by the undergraduates of the
University.
Like liiir City Club.
"When it is completed the Union
! will he run on the plan of the big city
clubs. It will be a common meeting
ground for all the men of the Univer
-1 sity. Jolly-ups will be held here in-
I stead of in Palo Alto. All the organ
izations of the University will have
rooms in t lie building. This Union is
no idle dream. It is a crying need.
Stanford needs the Union as badly as
it needs anything. What we need now
; is the co-operation of the underclass-
I men."
Student Body President Schaupp fol
lowed Roth. He spoke in part as
follows:
"None of you can realize what this
Union is goiirr to mean to the Student
Body. In the early days of the Univer
sity it was unnecessary. The student
body and the faculty were much small
er. The Stanford's home was the
general meeting place for all. and all
the members of the university were
acquainted. As the institution grew
larger this became more and more
impossible, until now the Freshman
enters here with the idea that he has
no friends and that the Faculty are
his deadly enemies. We want to get
rid of this.
To Consolidate Students.
"We also want to get rid of the
small factional units that now exist
around the University. The Hall is
more or less of a unit but the men
there are not. all acquainted. Each
house on the Row is a unit. We want
to consolidate them all into a Ann
and loyal student body.
"At the Union you will have the op
portunity to meet other men. Through
it you will increase your friendships
among the student body and the fa
culty alike. The Union will lie for
you as much as for anyone else.
You are going to be the men to en
joy it."
"I need," said Smith when called
upon, "live thousand dollars more in
pledges and ten thousand more in
hand. Then the Union will become a
reality to you all. The Union will be
yours. You can meet trustee, profes
sor, and student there on an equal
basis —as Stanford men.
"This is the first chance that the
Freshmen have had to take an active
