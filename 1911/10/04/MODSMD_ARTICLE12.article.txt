and 8-0, with 1915 on the long end.

made through a lucky opening and
no similar piece of luck found its
way to the Freshmen's side. Twice
the Freshmen should have scored but
over anxiousness at Palo Alto's 10,'
gave the visitors free kicks that sav
ed their side from being scored upon.
The Freshmen played a better brand
of ball than they have exhibited in the
last two games, being ready to follow
up and fight every minute. The Fresh
men pack huskies were enabled to
heel out the pigskin from the scrum
almost at will.
Palo Alto exhibited some clever
backfield passing, the best that they
have shown this season. Their little
scrum half, Stevenson, was a good
blanketer of the Freshmen passes.
