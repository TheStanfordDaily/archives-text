The Freshmen have done their part
and more and have put to shame other
classes in the University, in support

of the Union. Theirs
will be the greatest bene
fit from the building of
the club, it. is true, but

they have shown that they realize this.
Not only has money been pledged, but
what is more to the point, cash is
being paid in.
Members of the three other classes
and everyone in the University should
wake up and understand where mat
ters stand. Many alumni are only
waiting for the time when the stu
dents bring the total cash on hand up
ro twenty-five thousand. When that
is done the other half of the fifty
thousand will be paid in immediately.
H. C. Hoover will hand in a check for
eight thousand dollars, the remainder
of his pledge, and a good number of
other graduates will send in amounts
ranging from two hundred and fifty to
five hundred dollars. Let everyone
join to make a committee of one
thousand here on the campus to col
lect money for the building. We need
the Union.
