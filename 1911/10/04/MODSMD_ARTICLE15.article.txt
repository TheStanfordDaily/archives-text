# GRAYS AND BLANKS IN SCRUMMAGE PRACTICE.
## Varsity Wins, 18-0, in Game Marred By Ragged Playing in Spots. 
### 
Playing a game similar to that dis
played by them last Saturday, the
Varsity Grays defeated the Blacks on
the turf yesterday afternoon, their
efforts winning them eighteen points
to their opponents' nothing. The
game was deadened by a lack of pass
ing rushes, kicking being the main
stay of both teams. Risling again
appeared on the Gray line-up, with
Gard in a scrum position.
Eight familiar faces were absent
from the line-up. These were Skin
•tier, Watkins, Reeves, Prank, Kern,
Erb, and Cass. Of these. Cass has
almost recovered his injury and was
on the side-lines in togs last night,
while most of the others have minor
injuries and are kept out of the game
as a matter of safety.

used yesterday during the second
half. The original line-ups were:
