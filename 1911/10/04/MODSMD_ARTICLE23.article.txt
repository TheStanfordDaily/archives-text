# SIX YEARS OF SILENCE WILL BE BROKEN SOON
## ORGAN SOON TO BE READY FOR USE IN HALL. Tones of Memorial Church Instrument Will be Unimpaired by Transfer to Assembly. 
### 
Three weeks more will be required
to complete the installation of the pipe
| organ in Assembly Hall. Mr. Gibson.
I of the Murray M. Harris Organ Com
pany, who is in charge of the work,
! says that the organ will probably be
heard before it is entirely set up. It
,is his belief that the volume of
j sound will seem even greater
I than in the Memorial Church. The
I instrument has always been renowned
: for its beauty of tone, and while this
i was enhanced by the line acoustic
properties of its former position, no
harm is done by the change, since the
Assembly Hall carries sound as well
as the Church.
The organ is a very handsome in
strument, of which Stanford may well
he proud. The case is of polished
oak and the pipes decorating the front
are made of ninety-five per cent tin
and will never tarnish. In proof of
their line quality their condition after
years of storing need only be noticed.
The organ is somewhat altered in
appearance. The two halves have
been rearranged, with the former
sides in the front. There are over
three thousand pipes in the instru
ment, ranging from those of a sixteen
feet speaking length to those of a
three-quarters inch speaking length.
In 1901, when the organ was built,
it was the second largest pipe organ
in California, and is even now one of
the largest in the state. It is an
electro-pnuematic instrument. The
bellows, which are installed in the
basement, are operated by a three
and a half horse-power motor. The
organ was first placed in the Mechan
ics' Pavilion, San Francisco, for the
Christian Endeavor Convention held
there in 1901. It was planned to have
President William McKinley be the
first to open it. He was unable to
carry out the ceremony, however.
In September of that year the organ
was installed in the Memorial Church.
