## 
### 
Although there has been very good
material obtained for most of the
parts in the play, "Compromise," the
principal parts are still open. There
is a splendid chance for good acting,
and any who desire to try for these
places may arrange for a special an
pointment at once. When the entire
cast is decided on an announcement
will be made in the Daily Palo Alto.
A meeting of the club will be held
tonight at Roble Bridge, in the form
of a. picnic.
