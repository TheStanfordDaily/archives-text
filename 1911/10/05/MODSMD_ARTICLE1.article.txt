# "FATINITZA" WILL BE SCENIC MASTERPIECE
## UNUSUAL STAGE PICTURES ARE PROMISED. Schubert Club Has Chosen Work Containing Many Attractive Features For First Performance. 
### 
Scenically, "Fatinitza", the play
which the Shubert Club will present
in the Assembly hall on October 20,
is probably the most pretentious
thing that has ever been attempted
at Stanford. It is a splendid example
of the best in comic opera. It com
bines in one the humor and catchi
ness of '"The Mikado" and the gor
geous costuming effects of the "Uver
nian Princess", with additional ad
vantage of a unique and attractive
setting.
Camp and Harem.
Laid alternately in a Russian mili
tary camp and a Turkish harem the
play offers unusual scenic opportu
nities. Nothing in the way of stage
pictures that are known to Stanford
compares with the opening apt. Here
we see the camp of the forces of the
Czar. It is early morning in winter.
The ground is covered with snow.
Camp lires burn fitfully on all sides.
In the distance the fires of the Turk
ish camp twinkle through the night.
The broad Danube in the back ground
is frozen completely over. On the
rivers's far bank rise the domes and
minarets of a typical and picturesque
Russian city. That is the scenic of
fering.
In the field of costuming we are in
troduced to the gaudy uniforms of
Russian officers and soldiers, and a
little later to those of the Turkish
forces.
Innocent prank.
The play itself is rather modern in
its nature. Into the Russian camp
comes Lieutenant Vladimir Samoiloff.
He is a young dare-devil officer of
the line, who is so good looking and
so smooth-skinned, that he can easily
disguise himself as a woman. Short
ly before the opening of the play he
has indulged in an innocent prank
which necessitated his assuming this
disguise. And what is much worse
a gruff Russian officer has fallen in
love with him. During some private
theatricals Vladimir again takes the
woman's part and at this untimely
situation the Russian officer arrives
on the scene. It is difficult to explain
the case and this has hardly been
done when the entire company is
captured by a band of roving Turks.
In the meantime the complications
have been doubled by the fact that
Vladimir's sweetheart reaches the
camp and fails to understand why
the pretty actress whom everyone
calls Fatinitza is so like her lover.
Captured by Turks.
The captives are taken by the Turks
to the harem of a radical Mohamedan.
Here the comical situations pile up
one after another until the compli
cations are se deep that they look
quite inextricable.
The last act is laid in a summer
palace with all its splendors. Of
course everything comes out in the
end but it is necessary to resort to
some extraordinary methods before
the lovers are truly united.
The music of the play is extremely
catchy. Written by Franz von Suppe
in 1876 it enjoyed an extended suc
cess wherever it was played. For
many years, in fact until the modern
light opera began its vogue through
Gilbert and Sullivan, "Fatinitza" was
the high watermark in this field.
There are a thousand and one
unique things in the work. There
are pretty choruses; a Turkish shad
ow show; mock battles on the stage;
and over all the romance and mystery
of the East.
There are an even two dozen songs
and practically every one of them has
a happy chorus that goes with it.
Coach Bartlett promises some unique
and intricate dances for both prin
cipals and chorus. The part of Vlad
imir. the dashing lieutenant, and the
disguised Fatinitza, was written by
Suppe for a soprano voice. It is al
ways played by a woman.
