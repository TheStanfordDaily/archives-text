# Spirit on a. Vacation
## 
### 
The assistant yell-leaders have been
chosen. Now for a united student
body, united encouragement for the

team, and a united spirit
to win from California
next November. There
are a few things better

than defeating California, to be sure,
but not many. It is our opinion that
the work of the bleachers so far this
season has been poor, to put it mildly.
Three weeks has been too long for
the try-outs for the assistant leaders;
and just at a time when the teams in
the middle of their long grind, need
the support that a thousand men can
give them. The bleachers have been
worn out by the try-outs, and real en
thusiasm has been made a mock of.
We hope to see the men at the
games and cheering the team in the
old way. Stanford spirit has gone on
a vacation somewhere, but it may be
because of a lack of good organization.
The Big Game is but a month or so
away, and it is time that the student's
were showing'their faith in their team.
For here is a team, and one that will
!
win, if we can prove that we believe
in them.
