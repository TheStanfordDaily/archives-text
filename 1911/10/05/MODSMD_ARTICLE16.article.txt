# PALO ALTO GAME DEVELOPED FINE RUGBY.
## Freshmen Played Better Than 10-8 Score Indicates.—Showed Much Improved Form. 
### 
Playing simon-pure rugby from the
kick-off to the final gun, Palo Alto
High School yesterday won the long
end of the 10-8 score from the Fresh
men. This score is the exception to
the rule that figures never lie, how
ever, as the Freshmen were the ag
gressors throughout and should at
least have tied. Many times they
menaced the visitors' goal, only to be
thrown back by a timely boot, a burst
of speed in a passing rush, or an
awarded kick. Only a touch of stage
fright on Clark's part prevented him
from negotiating an easy straight
away goal and making the story of
the game read 10-10.
The game as a whole was one of
the most interesting exhibitions of
Rugby yet played on Stanford field.
The high school players were notable
for their splendid passing, and Bell's
work at fullback also featured. For
Stanford, Steinhart and Templeton
again proved themselves cool, nervy,
fast, and heady. The Freshmen as a
whole exhibited gratifying form and
team work.
The babes will continue to 1 have
Wednesday and Saturday games,
while the Varsity will be prevented
from suffering from lack of scrum
mage practice by set-tos with the
blacks on Tuesdays and Thursdays
and regular scheduled games oh Sat
urday. The twenty-first Is the date
set for their pilgrfyjipge to Los Ange
