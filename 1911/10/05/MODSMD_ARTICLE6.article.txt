# HEMPL TAKES PART IN LANGUAGE CONFERENCE
## PROFESSOR RETURNED MONDAY FROM LONDON. Authority on Tongues Represents Spelling Board in Meeting With English Society. 
### 
Professor George Hempl, head of
the Germanic Languages Department,
returned on Monday from a six weeks
trip abroad in the interest of the Sim
plified Spelling Board of America.
Professor Hempl was one of a com
mittee of five, the other members be
ing Professors Calvin Thomas and
Brander Matthews, of Columbia Uni
versity, -Professor Grandgent, of Har
vard, and Professor Bright, of Johns
Hopkins. The Chairman of the com
mittee representing the Simplified
Speling Society . of England, was
George Gilbert Murray, Regius Pro
fessor of Greek at Oxford.
No Reform Yet.
In speaking of the conference Pro
fessor Hempl said that the committees

took no definite steps toward spelling
reform, as their purpose was rather to
discuss the different aims and situa
tions of the two national bodies.
"Those taking part were not author
ized to take any action and the results
of the conference consist in recom
mendations made to the two societies,
which can not be made public until
the bodies take action upon them. A
Simplified Spelling Board has existed
in the United States for five or six
years, while the 'English Simplified
Spelling Society,' ap it is called, was
formed about three years ago. Seve
ral me£i in the English Society are
members of the American Board and
have come over n<JV and then to the
meetings in New York. It was found
that the two aides had different points
of view in important questions', and
so it seamed desirable to hold a Con
ference representatives- of
Great Britain and the tlnited States.
A\ committee was appointed by the ex
ecutive committee of the American
Board to jfttpet. a corresponding com
mittee of the English society, and the
meetings of the conference were held
at the University of London during
the second week of September.
Board Goes Slow.
"In general it has been the policy
of the American Board to go slowly,
correcting the spelling of such words
as would almost, certainly ultimately
be changed, and not to take any steps
until it had been approved not only by
a majority of the board but also Wy
the majority of a large advisory com
mittee. In this way it has been
thought that the public generally
would become accustomed to the idea
of simplification by seeing it in these


Profes«M»r Geonre llompl.
words that most needed it, and in
which it could most easily take place.
"The English committee, on the con
trary, at least the most active mem
bers of it, regarded this policy as a
halting and unsatisfactory one, and
desire at once to make a thorough
revision of the spelling of the whole
language."
With Schoolmate.
Professor Hempl returned to Ameri
ca on the Cunard liner "Caronia," his
stay in Londyn being limited to one
week. Another member of the com
mittee, Professor Calvin Thomas, of
Columbia, is a former school mate
and intimate friend, and this made the
trip especially enjoyable. On the way
home, Professor Hempl delivered lec
tures on his Etruscan researches at
Columbia, the University of New York,
and the University of Michigan, at
Ann Arbor.
A few early Etruscan descrip
ti( us by Professor Hempl, are' about
to appear in the Matzke volume, and
his own book on the subject will be
issued in a few months.

Board Goes Slow.
"In general it has been the policy
of the American Board to go slowly,
correcting the spelling of such words
as would almost, certainly ultimately
be changed, and not to take any steps
until it had been approved not only by
a majority of the board but also Wy
the majority of a large advisory com
mittee. In this way it has been
thought that the public generally
would become accustomed to the idea
of simplification by seeing it in these


Profes«M»r Geonre llompl.
words that most needed it, and in
which it could most easily take place.
"The English committee, on the con
trary, at least the most active mem
bers of it, regarded this policy as a
halting and unsatisfactory one, and
desire at once to make a thorough
revision of the spelling of the whole
language."
With Schoolmate.
Professor Hempl returned to Ameri
ca on the Cunard liner "Caronia," his
stay in Londyn being limited to one
week. Another member of the com
mittee, Professor Calvin Thomas, of
Columbia, is a former school mate
and intimate friend, and this made the
trip especially enjoyable. On the way
home, Professor Hempl delivered lec
tures on his Etruscan researches at
Columbia, the University of New York,
and the University of Michigan, at
Ann Arbor.
A few early Etruscan descrip
ti( us by Professor Hempl, are' about
to appear in the Matzke volume, and
his own book on the subject will be
issued in a few months.
Professor George Hempl, head of
the Germanic Languages Department,
returned on Monday from a six weeks
trip abroad in the interest of the Sim
plified Spelling Board of America.
Professor Hempl was one of a com
mittee of five, the other members be
ing Professors Calvin Thomas and
Brander Matthews, of Columbia Uni
versity, -Professor Grandgent, of Har
vard, and Professor Bright, of Johns
Hopkins. The Chairman of the com
mittee representing the Simplified
Speling Society . of England, was
George Gilbert Murray, Regius Pro
fessor of Greek at Oxford.
No Reform Yet.
In speaking of the conference Pro
fessor Hempl said that the committees

took no definite steps toward spelling
reform, as their purpose was rather to
discuss the different aims and situa
tions of the two national bodies.
"Those taking part were not author
ized to take any action and the results
of the conference consist in recom
mendations made to the two societies,
which can not be made public until
the bodies take action upon them. A
Simplified Spelling Board has existed
in the United States for five or six
years, while the 'English Simplified
Spelling Society,' ap it is called, was
formed about three years ago. Seve
ral me£i in the English Society are
members of the American Board and
have come over n<JV and then to the
meetings in New York. It was found
that the two aides had different points
of view in important questions', and
so it seamed desirable to hold a Con
ference representatives- of
Great Britain and the tlnited States.
A\ committee was appointed by the ex
ecutive committee of the American
Board to jfttpet. a corresponding com
mittee of the English society, and the
meetings of the conference were held
at the University of London during
the second week of September.
