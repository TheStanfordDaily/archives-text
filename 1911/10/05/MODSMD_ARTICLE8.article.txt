Monday next the Advisory Board of

with a similar meeting held here last
year, and it is probable that the ga
thering in future will be an annual

The day will be divided into three
parts. The various members of the
organization will be the guests at
luncheon of the fraternities and a
number of the professors. One mem
ber of the Hoard will be assigned to
each house. In the afternoon the
Executive Committee of the Board
will hold a meeting, and in the even
ing the entire Committee will attend
an informal dinner to be given at the
Sigma Nil house.
It is the purpose of the Board in
meeting here to keep in touch with
undergraduate life at the University,
and to cover with information gained
at first hand, any problems which they
may be called upon to solve.
To Consider Fitting Clubs.
When the Executive Committee of
the Board meets on Monday afternoon
it will be to hear and pass on the
important report of the sub-committee
appointed to look into the question of
eating houses on the Campus. It was
announced some time ago in these
columns that certain arrangements
pursuant to the eating club plans had
been completed and that it was only
necessary for the sub-committee of the
Board, to consider them before turn
ing in a report on the matter.
The plan suggested for the clubs
is, that the Advisory Board lease from
the University Trustees for a nominal
sum, the ground offered by them, and
suitable for the erection of the clubs.
This plan is the one at present in force
between the Associated Students and
the Trustees in obtaining ground for
athletic fields.
In order to help the venture from a
financial standpoint, if the committee
hands in a favorable report on the
plan, two members of the Alumni
Association have pledged themselves
to invest a considerable sum of money
in the venture. This will not cover
the total expenditure of building the
clubs, but the Advisory Board feel
that if a satisfactory report 's. re
turned they can raise the remainder
of the money. To do this they will
appoint a special committee if their
report is accepted by. the Board of
Trustees.
The total sum which would have to
be raised to complete the structures
is in the neighborhood of $15,000.
There are no definite plans as to the
arrangement of the building or .build
ings as yet, but it is-known that there
will be either one large buiiding or
four small ones.— • — -
The informal'dinner which will"be
given them on Monday evening at the
Sigma Nu house will be tendered by

'GO, and Dr, T. M. Williams, '97. Be
