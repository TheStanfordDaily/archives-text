# Memorial Church To Be Rebuilt Within Year
## Details Will Take More Time for Completion Contract Is Let for Earthquake-Proof Structure To Be Erected of Concrete and Steel. 
### 
Memorial Church, costing origin
ally over a million and a half dollars,
and erected in 1901-03 by Mrs. Stan
ford. in memory of her husband, Le
land Stanford, will be restored in
all its former magnificence and with
its original plan. This is the news
that came from San Francisco today
from the Board of Trustees. The ac
tion was taken at their meeting of last
Tuesday.
The main structure of the "Stanford
.Minster,'' as it has been called, will be
built within one year, according to
the terms of the contract made by the
Trustees with the McGilvray Stone C..
contractors for the pteel, reinforced
concrete and stone work, The details
of the construction, including, of
course, the costly mosaics, pictures,
stained glass windows, and statuary,
cannot be putin place, probably before
the end of two years. They will be
putin place again, as they stood before
the earthquake, with the exception of
those few pieces of decoration which
were completely destroyed by the cat
astrophe. Mrs. Stanford spent $600,
000 on these details of interior decora
tion, the main body of the church cost
ing $1,000,000. The contract for the
decorations has not been let, but will
be later.
The architects chosen to carry out
the restoration of the splendid Mem
orial are Ward and Blohme, of Alaska-
Commercial Building, San Francisco.
Mr. Ward is the Architect-in-Chief of
the Panama-Pacific Exposition.
The only change in the plans from
the original, will be that the edifice
is to be constructed in steel and re
inforced concrete, instead of brick ve
neer. This method of building will
make the church practically earth*
quake-proof.
The McGilvray contract calls for an
amount to be paid in excess of $100,
000. The steel work is practically all
completed, at a cost of over $100,000,
the construction being done last year.
It is probable that the total cost of
restoring the "Minster" will not be
anything like the original expense*
since most of the decorations are ready
and many of them need only be repair
ed. The cost, however, will very like
ly approach half-a-million dollars.
Description of Original Church.
Following are extracts taken from a
special booklet published at Stanford
at the time of the completion of the
church. Its story is told in the pres
ent tense. Since the Church is to be
restored exactly as it was, the des
cription may be applied to the new
structure.
"Cruciform in plan, with apsidal
Transepts and Chancel, the Church
has an extreme length of two hun
dred feet and lifts its gilded cross one
hundred and eighty-six feet. Its walls
are of native sandstone, rough dress
ed on the outside. It is noble in mas
siveness and finely proportioned parts
and in the cumulative beauty of butt
resses and turrets assembled around
its shapely and commanding tower.
There, high above surrounding build
ings, are chimes like those of Parli
ment House on the Thames, that strike
the quarter hours, and the illuminated
clock that publishes the flight of time.
Interior Design Perfect.
"The interior design and symmetry
of the Church are perfect. Four wide
Roman arches laced with delicate car
ving rest on four great pillars and
support a domed ceiling. The round
ed walls of Chancel and Transepts
complete the Romanesque effect and
give a sense of singular unity and
great spaciousness. There is warmth
in the buff color of the smooth faced
sandstone, instead of the suggestive

chilliness common in stone walls.
The low tones of natural color in sur
faces of wood and stone leave colo.-
decoration to be supplied by the win
dows. Their beauty is thus enhanced
and in return they illumine the sculp
tured marble and richly carved arches,
pillars and galleries, with a thousand
tints.
Chancel Lined With .Mosaics.
"Portal led by one of the great
arches and a flight of wide marble
steps spread from pulpit to lectern,
is the Chancel. Its walls are lined

with glowing mosaics, an upper ser
ies depicting prophets of Old Testa
ment, revelation, and a lower show
ing seraphic choirs on either hand,
hymning the wonder of the incarnation
and the victory of the World's Re
deemer. Statues of the twelve apos
tles surround the altar and on it
stand figures of the Holy Family, copi
ed from Thorwaldsen, all in finest
marble. The Entombment sculptured
on the face of the altar deserves es
peeial study and the Last Supper, in
mosaic on the reredos, is a treasure,
the only copy ever permitted of its
original in the Sistine Chapel, done by
Cosimo Roselli five hundred years
ago. Over all glow three great win
dows portraying the Birth, the Cruci
fixion and the Ascension of our Lord,
(irent Rose Window.
"Looking from the Chancel through
the Nave of the Church, the eye is
caught by a blaze of brilliant colors.
Above the Choir gallery, overhung by
the sombre oaken roof and flanked on
either side by gleaming pipes of the
wonderful organ, shines a great rose
window. Only sunset can surpass its
rich display. Flooding the body of
tlie church, tinting every object, ray
ing up into the shadowy spaces of the
roof, it mingles its magnificence into
the general scheme. One recognizes
a masterful plan underlying the color
decoration of the Church, which seeks
not only the best result in individual

pictures but beyond this a harmony in
all and an aggregate effect that will
exhibit and enhance every other beauty
of the edifice. ,
The Youthful Christ.
This window forms the splendid set
ting for a single simple figure, the
youthful Christ, in which Hoffman
has blended the lovable aspect of
natural boyhood with attributes that
transcend humanity, too subtly for
analysis, but with unfailing charm.
Surely it will waken worship in thou
sands of young hearts through the
long years to come, when for an hour
toward the close of day the organ
fills the place with music. The story
of the Christ life is told in the lower
windows of the Church. To select
originals for these pictures from the
world's store of sacred art, was Mrs.
Stanford's loving study for years.

Their translation into glass was a task
worthy of genius. Most of the origi
nals are of greater length than height.
The windows are high and narrow.
The originals are of various size and
scale and style. The reproductions
must harmonize in these respects so
as to form a series. To work within
these limitations, to modify composi
tion _ and details where necessary, to
transfer color effects from canvas to
so unlike a medium as glass, and
faithfully present the meaning and
beauty of a masterpiece in this more
luminous form, demands the finest,
artistic sensibility and skill.
"Beginning in the North Nave the
pictures are: The Annunciation, after
Shields; The Flight into Egypt, after
Plockhorst, and The Home at Naza
reth. after Hoffman. Beyond, in the
North Transept are: Christ in the
Temple, after. Holman Hunt; The
Baptism of Christ, after Gustave Dorfe;
The Sermon on the Mount, after Hoff
man: Christ Calming the Tempest, af
ter Dietrich; The Raising of Jairus'
Daughter, after Hoffman. The Chan
cel windows form a group by them
selves. The Nativity follows a pic
ture by Fellowes-Pr.vnne; The Cruci
fixion is an adaptation from Degger;
The Ascension is from Carlotti.
"In the South Transept are: The
Miracle of Loaves and Fishes, after
Murillo: Christ and the Adultress, af
ter Hoffman; The Good Shepherd, af-

All! gentle stranger, you who look upon
This stately monument, this noble Church
By deep affection raised, tell, if you can,
What sentiment it doth inspire; see how
Its massive tower is outlined on the deep
Blue sky, list to the music of its chimes,
As now their strain floats on the gentle breeze
Pass through its portal, enter in, and while
You stand transfixed, amazed, as slowly one
Ask what it is that makes you meditate; â€”
For dead and spiritless indeed are you,
Who coldly can such rudient glories view.

ter C. S. Parker, Christ in the Home
at Bethany, and Christ in Gethsemene,
both from pictures by Hoffman.
"Completing the series in the
South Nave are: The Dream of Pilate's 1
Wife, after Dor 6; The Angel at, the
Tomb, after Ender, and an original
by Paoletti, "Lo, I am with you."

"The windows of the clerestory con
tain single figures, nearly all of them
original designs by Mr. Frederick S.
Lamb. Taken in the same
those in the North wall represent
Abraham, Hagar, Moses, Pharaoh's
Daughter, Joshua, Deborah; in the
Transept are: David, Ruth.

"Looking from the Chancel through
the Nave of the Church, the eye is
caught by a blaze of brilliant colors.
Above the Choir gallery, overhung by
the sombre oaken roof and flanked on
either side by gleaming pipes of the
wonderful organ, shines a great rose
window. Only sunset can surpass its
rich display. Flooding the body of
tlie church, tinting every object, ray

roof, it mingles its magnificence into
the general scheme. One recognizes
a masterful plan underlying the color

not only the best result in individual

The Youthful Christ.
This window forms the splendid set
ting for a single simple figure, the
youthful Christ, in which Hoffman
has blended the lovable aspect of
natural boyhood with attributes that
transcend humanity, too subtly for
analysis, but with unfailing charm.
Surely it will waken worship in thou
sands of young hearts through the
long years to come, when for an hour
toward the close of day the organ
fills the place with music. The story
of the Christ life is told in the lower
windows of the Church. To select
originals for these pictures from the
world's store of sacred art, was Mrs.
Stanford's loving study for years.

Their translation into glass was a task
worthy of genius. Most of the origi
nals are of greater length than height.
The windows are high and narrow.
The originals are of various size and
scale and style. The reproductions
must harmonize in these respects so
as to form a series. To work within
these limitations, to modify composi
tion _ and details where necessary, to
transfer color effects from canvas to
so unlike a medium as glass, and
faithfully present the meaning and
beauty of a masterpiece in this more
luminous form, demands the finest,
artistic sensibility and skill.
"Beginning in the North Nave the
pictures are: The Annunciation, after
Shields; The Flight into Egypt, after

Mcmorliil Church.


After the Earthquake.
Memorial Church, costing origin
ally over a million and a half dollars,
and erected in 1901-03 by Mrs. Stan
ford. in memory of her husband, Le
land Stanford, will be restored in
all its former magnificence and with
its original plan. This is the news
that came from San Francisco today
from the Board of Trustees. The ac
tion was taken at their meeting of last
Tuesday.
The main structure of the "Stanford
.Minster,'' as it has been called, will be
built within one year, according to
the terms of the contract made by the
Trustees with the McGilvray Stone C..
contractors for the pteel, reinforced
concrete and stone work, The details
of the construction, including, of
course, the costly mosaics, pictures,
stained glass windows, and statuary,
cannot be putin place, probably before
the end of two years. They will be
putin place again, as they stood before
the earthquake, with the exception of
those few pieces of decoration which
were completely destroyed by the cat
astrophe. Mrs. Stanford spent $600,
000 on these details of interior decora
tion, the main body of the church cost
ing $1,000,000. The contract for the
decorations has not been let, but will
be later.
The architects chosen to carry out
the restoration of the splendid Mem
orial are Ward and Blohme, of Alaska-
Commercial Building, San Francisco.
Mr. Ward is the Architect-in-Chief of
the Panama-Pacific Exposition.
The only change in the plans from
the original, will be that the edifice
is to be constructed in steel and re
inforced concrete, instead of brick ve
neer. This method of building will
make the church practically earth*
quake-proof.
The McGilvray contract calls for an
amount to be paid in excess of $100,
000. The steel work is practically all
completed, at a cost of over $100,000,
the construction being done last year.
It is probable that the total cost of
restoring the "Minster" will not be
anything like the original expense*
since most of the decorations are ready
and many of them need only be repair
ed. The cost, however, will very like
ly approach half-a-million dollars.
Description of Original Church.
Following are extracts taken from a
special booklet published at Stanford
at the time of the completion of the
church. Its story is told in the pres
ent tense. Since the Church is to be
restored exactly as it was, the des
cription may be applied to the new
structure.
"Cruciform in plan, with apsidal
Transepts and Chancel, the Church
has an extreme length of two hun
dred feet and lifts its gilded cross one
hundred and eighty-six feet. Its walls
are of native sandstone, rough dress
ed on the outside. It is noble in mas
siveness and finely proportioned parts
and in the cumulative beauty of butt
resses and turrets assembled around
its shapely and commanding tower.
There, high above surrounding build
ings, are chimes like those of Parli
ment House on the Thames, that strike
the quarter hours, and the illuminated
clock that publishes the flight of time.
Interior Design Perfect.
"The interior design and symmetry
of the Church are perfect. Four wide
Roman arches laced with delicate car
ving rest on four great pillars and
support a domed ceiling. The round
ed walls of Chancel and Transepts
complete the Romanesque effect and
give a sense of singular unity and
great spaciousness. There is warmth
in the buff color of the smooth faced
sandstone, instead of the suggestive

chilliness common in stone walls.
The low tones of natural color in sur
faces of wood and stone leave colo.-
decoration to be supplied by the win
dows. Their beauty is thus enhanced
and in return they illumine the sculp
tured marble and richly carved arches,
pillars and galleries, with a thousand
tints.
Chancel Lined With .Mosaics.
"Portal led by one of the great
arches and a flight of wide marble
steps spread from pulpit to lectern,
is the Chancel. Its walls are lined

with glowing mosaics, an upper ser
ies depicting prophets of Old Testa
ment, revelation, and a lower show
ing seraphic choirs on either hand,
hymning the wonder of the incarnation
and the victory of the World's Re
deemer. Statues of the twelve apos
tles surround the altar and on it
stand figures of the Holy Family, copi
ed from Thorwaldsen, all in finest
marble. The Entombment sculptured
on the face of the altar deserves es
peeial study and the Last Supper, in
mosaic on the reredos, is a treasure,
the only copy ever permitted of its
original in the Sistine Chapel, done by
Cosimo Roselli five hundred years
ago. Over all glow three great win
dows portraying the Birth, the Cruci

contractors for the pteel, reinforced
concrete and stone work, The details
of the construction, including, of
course, the costly mosaics, pictures,
stained glass windows, and statuary,
cannot be putin place, probably before
the end of two years. They will be
putin place again, as they stood before
the earthquake, with the exception of
those few pieces of decoration which
were completely destroyed by the cat
astrophe. Mrs. Stanford spent $600,
000 on these details of interior decora
tion, the main body of the church cost
ing $1,000,000. The contract for the
decorations has not been let, but will
be later.
The architects chosen to carry out
the restoration of the splendid Mem
orial are Ward and Blohme, of Alaska-
Commercial Building, San Francisco.
Mr. Ward is the Architect-in-Chief of
the Panama-Pacific Exposition.
The only change in the plans from
the original, will be that the edifice
is to be constructed in steel and re
inforced concrete, instead of brick ve
neer. This method of building will
make the church practically earth*
quake-proof.
The McGilvray contract calls for an
amount to be paid in excess of $100,
000. The steel work is practically all
completed, at a cost of over $100,000,
the construction being done last year.
It is probable that the total cost of
restoring the "Minster" will not be
anything like the original expense*
since most of the decorations are ready
and many of them need only be repair
ed. The cost, however, will very like
ly approach half-a-million dollars.
Description of Original Church.
Following are extracts taken from a
special booklet published at Stanford
at the time of the completion of the
church. Its story is told in the pres
ent tense. Since the Church is to be
restored exactly as it was, the des
cription may be applied to the new
structure.
"Cruciform in plan, with apsidal
Transepts and Chancel, the Church
has an extreme length of two hun
dred feet and lifts its gilded cross one
hundred and eighty-six feet. Its walls
are of native sandstone, rough dress
ed on the outside. It is noble in mas
siveness and finely proportioned parts
and in the cumulative beauty of butt
resses and turrets assembled around
its shapely and commanding tower.
There, high above surrounding build
ings, are chimes like those of Parli
ment House on the Thames, that strike
the quarter hours, and the illuminated
clock that publishes the flight of time.
Interior Design Perfect.
"The interior design and symmetry
of the Church are perfect. Four wide
Roman arches laced with delicate car
ving rest on four great pillars and
support a domed ceiling. The round
ed walls of Chancel and Transepts
complete the Romanesque effect and
give a sense of singular unity and
great spaciousness. There is warmth
in the buff color of the smooth faced
sandstone, instead of the suggestive

chilliness common in stone walls.
The low tones of natural color in sur
faces of wood and stone leave colo.-
decoration to be supplied by the win
dows. Their beauty is thus enhanced
and in return they illumine the sculp
tured marble and richly carved arches,
pillars and galleries, with a thousand
tints.
Chancel Lined With .Mosaics.
"Portal led by one of the great
arches and a flight of wide marble
steps spread from pulpit to lectern,
is the Chancel. Its walls are lined

with glowing mosaics, an upper ser
ies depicting prophets of Old Testa
ment, revelation, and a lower show
ing seraphic choirs on either hand,
hymning the wonder of the incarnation
and the victory of the World's Re
deemer. Statues of the twelve apos
tles surround the altar and on it
stand figures of the Holy Family, copi
ed from Thorwaldsen, all in finest
marble. The Entombment sculptured
on the face of the altar deserves es
peeial study and the Last Supper, in
mosaic on the reredos, is a treasure,
the only copy ever permitted of its
original in the Sistine Chapel, done by
Cosimo Roselli five hundred years
ago. Over all glow three great win
dows portraying the Birth, the Cruci
fixion and the Ascension of our Lord,
(irent Rose Window.
"Looking from the Chancel through
the Nave of the Church, the eye is
caught by a blaze of brilliant colors.
Above the Choir gallery, overhung by
the sombre oaken roof and flanked on
either side by gleaming pipes of the
wonderful organ, shines a great rose
window. Only sunset can surpass its
rich display. Flooding the body of
tlie church, tinting every object, ray
ing up into the shadowy spaces of the
roof, it mingles its magnificence into
the general scheme. One recognizes
a masterful plan underlying the color
decoration of the Church, which seeks
not only the best result in individual

pictures but beyond this a harmony in
all and an aggregate effect that will
exhibit and enhance every other beauty
of the edifice. ,
The Youthful Christ.
This window forms the splendid set
ting for a single simple figure, the
youthful Christ, in which Hoffman
has blended the lovable aspect of
natural boyhood with attributes that
transcend humanity, too subtly for
analysis, but with unfailing charm.
Surely it will waken worship in thou
sands of young hearts through the
long years to come, when for an hour
toward the close of day the organ
fills the place with music. The story
of the Christ life is told in the lower
windows of the Church. To select
originals for these pictures from the
world's store of sacred art, was Mrs.
Stanford's loving study for years.

Their translation into glass was a task
worthy of genius. Most of the origi
nals are of greater length than height.
The windows are high and narrow.
The originals are of various size and
scale and style. The reproductions
must harmonize in these respects so
as to form a series. To work within
these limitations, to modify composi
tion _ and details where necessary, to
transfer color effects from canvas to
so unlike a medium as glass, and
faithfully present the meaning and
beauty of a masterpiece in this more
luminous form, demands the finest,
artistic sensibility and skill.
"Beginning in the North Nave the
pictures are: The Annunciation, after
Shields; The Flight into Egypt, after
Plockhorst, and The Home at Naza
reth. after Hoffman. Beyond, in the
North Transept are: Christ in the
Temple, after. Holman Hunt; The
Baptism of Christ, after Gustave Dorfe;
The Sermon on the Mount, after Hoff
man: Christ Calming the Tempest, af
ter Dietrich; The Raising of Jairus'
Daughter, after Hoffman. The Chan
cel windows form a group by them
selves. The Nativity follows a pic
ture by Fellowes-Pr.vnne; The Cruci
fixion is an adaptation from Degger;
The Ascension is from Carlotti.
"In the South Transept are: The
Miracle of Loaves and Fishes, after
Murillo: Christ and the Adultress, af
ter Hoffman; The Good Shepherd, af-

As now their strain floats on the gentle breeze
Pass through its portal, enter in, and while
You stand transfixed, amazed, as slowly one

ter C. S. Parker, Christ in the Home

both from pictures by Hoffman.
"Completing the series in the
South Nave are: The Dream of Pilate's 1

Tomb, after Ender, and an original
by Paoletti, "Lo, I am with you."

"The windows of the clerestory con

decoration of the Church, which seeks
not only the best result in individual

pictures but beyond this a harmony in
all and an aggregate effect that will
exhibit and enhance every other beauty
of the edifice. ,
The Youthful Christ.
This window forms the splendid set
ting for a single simple figure, the
youthful Christ, in which Hoffman
has blended the lovable aspect of
natural boyhood with attributes that
transcend humanity, too subtly for
analysis, but with unfailing charm.
Surely it will waken worship in thou
sands of young hearts through the
long years to come, when for an hour
toward the close of day the organ
fills the place with music. The story
of the Christ life is told in the lower
windows of the Church. To select
originals for these pictures from the
world's store of sacred art, was Mrs.
Stanford's loving study for years.

Their translation into glass was a task
worthy of genius. Most of the origi
nals are of greater length than height.
The windows are high and narrow.
The originals are of various size and
scale and style. The reproductions
must harmonize in these respects so
as to form a series. To work within
these limitations, to modify composi
tion _ and details where necessary, to
transfer color effects from canvas to
so unlike a medium as glass, and
faithfully present the meaning and
beauty of a masterpiece in this more
luminous form, demands the finest,
artistic sensibility and skill.

pictures are: The Annunciation, after

All! gentle stranger, you who look upon
This stately monument, this noble Church
By deep affection raised, tell, if you can,
What sentiment it doth inspire; see how
Its massive tower is outlined on the deep
Blue sky, list to the music of its chimes,
As now their strain floats on the gentle breeze
Pass through its portal, enter in, and while
You stand transfixed, amazed, as slowly one
Ask what it is that makes you meditate; â€”
For dead and spiritless indeed are you,
Who coldly can such rudient glories view.

at Bethany, and Christ in Gethsemene,
both from pictures by Hoffman.
"Completing the series in the
South Nave are: The Dream of Pilate's 1
Wife, after Dor 6; The Angel at, the
Tomb, after Ender, and an original
by Paoletti, "Lo, I am with you."

"The windows of the clerestory con
tain single figures, nearly all of them
original designs by Mr. Frederick S.
Lamb. Taken in the same
those in the North wall represent
Abraham, Hagar, Moses, Pharaoh's
Daughter, Joshua, Deborah; in the
Transept are: David, Ruth.


Mcmorliil Church.


After the Earthquake.
Memorial Church, costing origin
ally over a million and a half dollars,
and erected in 1901-03 by Mrs. Stan
ford. in memory of her husband, Le
land Stanford, will be restored in
all its former magnificence and with
its original plan. This is the news
that came from San Francisco today
from the Board of Trustees. The ac
tion was taken at their meeting of last
Tuesday.
The main structure of the "Stanford
.Minster,'' as it has been called, will be
built within one year, according to
the terms of the contract made by the
Trustees with the McGilvray Stone C..
contractors for the pteel, reinforced
concrete and stone work, The details
of the construction, including, of
course, the costly mosaics, pictures,
stained glass windows, and statuary,
cannot be putin place, probably before
the end of two years. They will be
putin place again, as they stood before
the earthquake, with the exception of
those few pieces of decoration which
were completely destroyed by the cat
astrophe. Mrs. Stanford spent $600,
000 on these details of interior decora
tion, the main body of the church cost
ing $1,000,000. The contract for the
decorations has not been let, but will
be later.
The architects chosen to carry out
the restoration of the splendid Mem
orial are Ward and Blohme, of Alaska-
Commercial Building, San Francisco.
Mr. Ward is the Architect-in-Chief of
the Panama-Pacific Exposition.
The only change in the plans from
the original, will be that the edifice
is to be constructed in steel and re
inforced concrete, instead of brick ve
neer. This method of building will
make the church practically earth*
quake-proof.
The McGilvray contract calls for an
amount to be paid in excess of $100,
000. The steel work is practically all
completed, at a cost of over $100,000,
the construction being done last year.
It is probable that the total cost of
restoring the "Minster" will not be
anything like the original expense*
since most of the decorations are ready
and many of them need only be repair
ed. The cost, however, will very like
ly approach half-a-million dollars.
Description of Original Church.
Following are extracts taken from a
special booklet published at Stanford
at the time of the completion of the
church. Its story is told in the pres
ent tense. Since the Church is to be
restored exactly as it was, the des
cription may be applied to the new
structure.
"Cruciform in plan, with apsidal
Transepts and Chancel, the Church
has an extreme length of two hun
dred feet and lifts its gilded cross one
hundred and eighty-six feet. Its walls
are of native sandstone, rough dress
ed on the outside. It is noble in mas
siveness and finely proportioned parts
and in the cumulative beauty of butt
resses and turrets assembled around
its shapely and commanding tower.
There, high above surrounding build
ings, are chimes like those of Parli
ment House on the Thames, that strike
the quarter hours, and the illuminated
clock that publishes the flight of time.
Interior Design Perfect.
"The interior design and symmetry
of the Church are perfect. Four wide
Roman arches laced with delicate car
ving rest on four great pillars and
support a domed ceiling. The round
ed walls of Chancel and Transepts
complete the Romanesque effect and
give a sense of singular unity and
great spaciousness. There is warmth
in the buff color of the smooth faced
sandstone, instead of the suggestive

chilliness common in stone walls.
The low tones of natural color in sur
faces of wood and stone leave colo.-
decoration to be supplied by the win
dows. Their beauty is thus enhanced
and in return they illumine the sculp
tured marble and richly carved arches,
pillars and galleries, with a thousand
tints.
Chancel Lined With .Mosaics.
"Portal led by one of the great
arches and a flight of wide marble
steps spread from pulpit to lectern,
is the Chancel. Its walls are lined

with glowing mosaics, an upper ser
ies depicting prophets of Old Testa
ment, revelation, and a lower show
ing seraphic choirs on either hand,
hymning the wonder of the incarnation
and the victory of the World's Re
deemer. Statues of the twelve apos
tles surround the altar and on it
stand figures of the Holy Family, copi
ed from Thorwaldsen, all in finest
marble. The Entombment sculptured
on the face of the altar deserves es
peeial study and the Last Supper, in
mosaic on the reredos, is a treasure,
the only copy ever permitted of its
original in the Sistine Chapel, done by
Cosimo Roselli five hundred years
ago. Over all glow three great win
dows portraying the Birth, the Cruci
fixion and the Ascension of our Lord,
(irent Rose Window.
"Looking from the Chancel through
the Nave of the Church, the eye is
caught by a blaze of brilliant colors.
Above the Choir gallery, overhung by
the sombre oaken roof and flanked on
either side by gleaming pipes of the
wonderful organ, shines a great rose
window. Only sunset can surpass its
rich display. Flooding the body of
tlie church, tinting every object, ray
ing up into the shadowy spaces of the
roof, it mingles its magnificence into
the general scheme. One recognizes
a masterful plan underlying the color
decoration of the Church, which seeks
not only the best result in individual

pictures but beyond this a harmony in
all and an aggregate effect that will
exhibit and enhance every other beauty
of the edifice. ,
