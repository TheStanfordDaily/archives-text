# FAST OLYMPICS PLAY VARSITY ONCE MORE
## SECOND OF THREE-GAME SERIES TO-MORROW. Freshmen Meet Oakland High Team—Varsity Scrum Will Be a Formidable One. 
### 
Two strong fighting teams will
journey to the campus tomorrow to
play the Cardinal rugby units on
Stanford Field. At 3:30 o'clock the
Varsity will line up against the fast
Olympic fifteen for the second of the
three games scheduled with the city
clubmen. Preceding the big game the
Freshmen will take on the strong
aggregation from the Oakland High
School, at 2:30.
The Varsity has a team facing them
tomorrow that have always proved
game fighters and the Cardinal have
always paid strict attention to the
business in hand in order to swing
the victory to their side. Their ranks
will be strengthened, as usual, by the
names of several men who formerly
were on the Cardinal line when Stan
ford went into battle. These men
are McGregor, Miller, Sundell, Fit
ting, Tallant and Laumeister.
In Critical Place.
The Freshmen seem to be in a criti
cal place. Up to two games ago they
were unconquered. At present the
last two games have gone against
them and they have only three more
games to play before their schedule
is finished, one week from tomorrow.
Tomorrow afternoon they meet the
Oakland High players, who come here
victors over the California babies, and
who twice held the St. Mary's huskies
to hotly contested ties. Any let up
on the part of the representatives of
the Cardinal may swing the victory to
the side of the visitors, and tight play
must be the order of the day.
On Monday, in the game with Fre
mont lads the Freshmen met their
first defeat and learned the speed of
the better secondary schools when
they are given a chance to use the
ball. Success crowns the Freshmen's
movements when they fight hard from
the whistle. The use of this method
tomorrow means another Freshman
victory.
Freshmen Strong Tomorrow.
The Freshmen will have a strong
unit to send into the field tomorrow.
But one loss is threatened to their
fifteen. Cookson twisted his ankle in
the scrimmage on Wednesday and was
removed from the game. While not
serious the injury is similar to one he
received last year and may necessi
tate a rest over tomorrow and perhaps
for the remainder of the short season.
Erb has l>een removed front the in
jured list and is expected to be on
deck again tomorrow. The rest of
the backfield of the 191 r» aggregation
is unchanged.
The Freshmen will use the same
huskies in the foreground with Haley
as their spiraler-in-chief to touch,
and hooter of the awarded kicks.

Two strong fighting teams will
journey to the campus tomorrow to
play the Cardinal rugby units on
Stanford Field. At 3:30 o'clock the
Varsity will line up against the fast
Olympic fifteen for the second of the
three games scheduled with the city
clubmen. Preceding the big game the
Freshmen will take on the strong
aggregation from the Oakland High
School, at 2:30.
The Varsity has a team facing them
tomorrow that have always proved
game fighters and the Cardinal have
always paid strict attention to the
business in hand in order to swing
the victory to their side. Their ranks
will be strengthened, as usual, by the
names of several men who formerly
were on the Cardinal line when Stan
ford went into battle. These men
are McGregor, Miller, Sundell, Fit
ting, Tallant and Laumeister.
In Critical Place.
The Freshmen seem to be in a criti
cal place. Up to two games ago they
were unconquered. At present the
last two games have gone against
them and they have only three more
games to play before their schedule
is finished, one week from tomorrow.
Tomorrow afternoon they meet the
Oakland High players, who come here
victors over the California babies, and
who twice held the St. Mary's huskies
to hotly contested ties. Any let up
on the part of the representatives of
the Cardinal may swing the victory to
the side of the visitors, and tight play
must be the order of the day.
On Monday, in the game with Fre
mont lads the Freshmen met their
first defeat and learned the speed of
the better secondary schools when
they are given a chance to use the
ball. Success crowns the Freshmen's
movements when they fight hard from
the whistle. The use of this method
tomorrow means another Freshman
victory.
Freshmen Strong Tomorrow.
The Freshmen will have a strong
unit to send into the field tomorrow.
But one loss is threatened to their
fifteen. Cookson twisted his ankle in
the scrimmage on Wednesday and was
removed from the game. While not
serious the injury is similar to one he
received last year and may necessi
tate a rest over tomorrow and perhaps
for the remainder of the short season.
Erb has l>een removed front the in
jured list and is expected to be on
deck again tomorrow. The rest of
the backfield of the 191 r» aggregation
is unchanged.
The Freshmen will use the same
huskies in the foreground with Haley
as their spiraler-in-chief to touch,
and hooter of the awarded kicks.
The line-ups:
Fresh men — Wines, Frost, Soper,
Button, Haley, Jacomini, Wilson, for
