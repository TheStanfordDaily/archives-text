# RAM'S HEAD WILL HAVE SECOND OPEN MEETING
## FOOTBALL SHOW, ONLY, OUTLINED YESTERDAY Prospective Performers Asked to Show Their Ability at Big Gathering Tomorrow. 
### 
No tryouts were held yesterday af
ternoon at the open meeting of the
Ram's Head Club, which is planning
the 1911 Football Show subject to the
approval of the Executive Committee.
The candidates were merely given op
portunities to outline their skits and
to receive hints as to the best manner
of working up the vaudeville acts.
The actual performances are to be giv
en t'o-morrow morning in room 68
at ten o'clock and everyone desiring to
figure in the program, whether at yes
terday's meeting or not, should be
present.
Continuous Vaudeville.
As those who attended yesterday
were told, the general scheme of the
show is two hours of continuous vau
deville in two acts—without delays
caused by change of scene. The skits 4
songs, playlets and dances are to suc
ceed each other in rapid succession,
each being distinct in its originality
but yet connected with the rest in a
certain plot of general interest. The
idea is a distinctly novel one and
should result in something different
from anything that has ever been seen
in the Assembly Hall.
Liano for Tryouts.
A piano will be placed in the room
set for the place of meeting tomor
row, so that the musical stunts can be
heard as well as those without songs.
No costumes will be required of the
performers, as the club does not in
tend to decide as yet on its selection
of the program. The object of the
meeting is mainly a desire to find out
just what line of performance the com
mittee shall be able to rely upon.
