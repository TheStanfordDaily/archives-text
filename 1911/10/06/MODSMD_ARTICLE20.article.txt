# California Notes.

President Wheeler, in an article
which appears in"The Outlook" of
last week —-"A Forecast for Califor
nia and the Pacific Coast" —pictures
for this state a future of wide op
portunity and expansion. California,
he says, is to become the front-door
of the Western world, looking out
across the Pacific to the East, which
was so long isolated from European
civilization.
