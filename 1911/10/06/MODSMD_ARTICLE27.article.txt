Captain Howe is one of Yale's si
lent and serious captains and his
energy has pushed the team far ahead
of the usual development in the begin
ning of the season, but the coaches
fear that he is overworking and are
urging him to retire from the early
games. Howe's form this year is
stellar in every particular and it is
predicted that he will become the
equal of Tad Jones, the best quarter
Old Eli ever had, before the season
is over.
