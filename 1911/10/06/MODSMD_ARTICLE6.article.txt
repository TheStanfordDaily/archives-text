# The

### 
Memorial Church is to be rebuilt.
Once again the chimes and the heavy
boom of the clock will sound over the
campus, as in days before the earth
quake. Although money is needed

in countless ways for
the University use, yet
it is perhaps only right

that this beautiful Memorial should be
restored as soon as possible. There is
a certain feeling of reverence embod
ied in the Church, the same spirit that
made the University possible, and not
to see that reverence continue in the
present generation would be unfitting.
It was decided immediately after the
great destruction of the University
buildings that the Church should be the
first to be reconstructed. This action
of the Trustees is therefore a following
out of that plan. We thank them for
this. The news will be welcome to the
hundreds of alumni who have return
ed each year to the campus, and have
missed the music of the chimes, and
the tall spire lifting above the Quad.
It will be welcome news to the present
students who have long passed by the
great ruin with a feeling of desolation.
