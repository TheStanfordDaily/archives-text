### 
About ninety Stanford men and wo
men gathered in the Sigma Nu house
last night at the dinner given in hon
or of the Advisory Board of the Alum
ni Association by .J. E. McDowell,
'00, and Dr. T. M. Williams, '97, local
members of the Board. The purpose
of the dinner was to afford an oppor
tunity for the various classes of Staf
ford people, students, alumni, and
faculty, to become better acquainted
and to discuss informally all sorts
of questions tbftt affect the University.
There was about an equal division be
tween the three classes in the men and
women present, and the spirit of the
meeting was most clearly indicated
when upon the motion of K. L.
Schaupp, '12, Student Body president,
a message of affectionate greeting was
prepared to be sent in the name of
this representative gathering of Stan
ford people to Dr. Jordan, who was
just setting sail for Japan on his way
home. Schaupp's suggestion was
made just after Dennis Searles, '95,
had spoken of some of the things the
Advisory Board, of which he is presi
dent, had learned in their visits to the
Campus and had paid high and sincere
tribute to Dr. Jordan. The sugges
tion was enthusiastically ratified and
a committee, representing the stu
dents, alumni, and faculty was ap
pointed to draft the message.
No Set Speeches
There were no set speeches, but
Schaupp, Searles, Dr. J. M. Stillman,
and Acting President Branner were
called upon for informal talks.
Schaupp presented the sentiments
and general attitude of the students
towards the University, the Faculty
and the Alumni. We are ready to take
advice", he said. "We want to take
advice. We realize that we are
younger than the alumni and that
they have been through much the
same experiences that we are going
through now, and that the members
of the faculty also have been through
the same stages. We are determined
to do our best to promote harmony
in the University and to make its ef
forts effective."
Mr. Searles reviewed some of the
work that has been accomplished by
the Advisory Board, going into da
tails concerning the steps in the e"-
forts for eating houses that have just
been brought to a successful con
clusion. Speaking of the visits of the
Board to the campus, he said, "We
didn't know until we had inspected
the departments here, what a tremen
dous enterprise this university is
Our hearts went out to Dr. Jordan
when we understood it a little. Wc
hadn't realized what a tremendous
task he has, to get all this equip
ment, and especially to bring to the
University the kind of men we have
here teaching the students. It is ai
immense responsibility. Dr. Jordan
is recognized everywhere now as one
of the greatest men of the world. At
times we who are so close to him
don't realize it. lb»-t~Tve have see V
recently how the world regards hi n.
and we are going to give him a
howling reception when he gets home.
We are going to show him how we re
gard him."
Dr. Stillu'un Spriks.
Dr. Stillman recalled how five year
ago he gathered statistics from all th">
departments, as to how much money
they thought they ought to have, on a
reasonable basis, to conduct thei'-
work and do all that the University
had a right to exnect of them, estimat
ing five years into the future. After
thee conservative estimates had been
pruned somewhat, it was found that
the University, according to the head •
o r the Departments needed about
? 150,000 a year more than they were
getting. There has been an increase o"
maybe one-third that amount and yet
the work has been carried on some
how, largely by the personal sacri

fice, and the extra work of the facul
; ty. Dr. Stillman ran through the var
ious suggestions that have been made
as to ways to cut. expenditures so
that they would be nearer to the in
| come, and showed the flaws in all.
"One other remedy has been -suggest
! Ed", he haid. "and that is that we
increase our income. I commend that
[suggestion to the alumni."
C'l" Help University.
Dr. Branner pointed out that Stan-
I ford men and women can often help
j the University, hot by the expendi
ture o" monev alone, but by loyal
j and sympathetic support. "There are
many wav sin which the alumni can
! support th 1 Univers'tv besides the fi
nancial way," he said. "We need
money, but above all we need the
bya'ty which every man owes to the
university. One way in which the
alumni can help to make this a more
effertive university is by advising the
young men who come here to get into
nersonal touch with the faculty.
are some of the finest men in
the world on this faculty. The young
men who come here are not getting
all there is in college for them if they
fill to tnke advantage of their oppor
tunity to come into intimate contact
with these men."

prepared to be sent in the name of
this representative gathering of Stan
ford people to Dr. Jordan, who was
just setting sail for Japan on his way
home. Schaupp's suggestion was
made just after Dennis Searles, '95,
had spoken of some of the things the
Advisory Board, of which he is presi
dent, had learned in their visits to the
Campus and had paid high and sincere
tribute to Dr. Jordan. The sugges
tion was enthusiastically ratified and
a committee, representing the stu
dents, alumni, and faculty was ap
pointed to draft the message.
No Set Speeches
There were no set speeches, but
Schaupp, Searles, Dr. J. M. Stillman,
and Acting President Branner were
called upon for informal talks.
Schaupp presented the sentiments
and general attitude of the students
towards the University, the Faculty
and the Alumni. We are ready to take
advice", he said. "We want to take
advice. We realize that we are
younger than the alumni and that
they have been through much the
same experiences that we are going
through now, and that the members
of the faculty also have been through
the same stages. We are determined
to do our best to promote harmony
in the University and to make its ef
forts effective."
Mr. Searles reviewed some of the
work that has been accomplished by
the Advisory Board, going into da
tails concerning the steps in the e"-
forts for eating houses that have just
been brought to a successful con
clusion. Speaking of the visits of the
Board to the campus, he said, "We
didn't know until we had inspected
the departments here, what a tremen
dous enterprise this university is
Our hearts went out to Dr. Jordan
when we understood it a little. Wc
hadn't realized what a tremendous
task he has, to get all this equip
ment, and especially to bring to the
University the kind of men we have
here teaching the students. It is ai
immense responsibility. Dr. Jordan
is recognized everywhere now as one
of the greatest men of the world. At
times we who are so close to him
don't realize it. lb»-t~Tve have see V
recently how the world regards hi n.
and we are going to give him a
howling reception when he gets home.
We are going to show him how we re
gard him."
Dr. Stillu'un Spriks.
Dr. Stillman recalled how five year
ago he gathered statistics from all th">
departments, as to how much money
they thought they ought to have, on a
reasonable basis, to conduct thei'-
work and do all that the University
had a right to exnect of them, estimat
ing five years into the future. After
thee conservative estimates had been
pruned somewhat, it was found that
the University, according to the head •
o r the Departments needed about
? 150,000 a year more than they were
getting. There has been an increase o"
maybe one-third that amount and yet
the work has been carried on some
how, largely by the personal sacri

fice, and the extra work of the facul
; ty. Dr. Stillman ran through the var
ious suggestions that have been made
as to ways to cut. expenditures so
that they would be nearer to the in
| come, and showed the flaws in all.
"One other remedy has been -suggest
! Ed", he haid. "and that is that we
increase our income. I commend that
[suggestion to the alumni."
C'l" Help University.
Dr. Branner pointed out that Stan-
I ford men and women can often help
j the University, hot by the expendi
ture o" monev alone, but by loyal
j and sympathetic support. "There are
many wav sin which the alumni can
! support th 1 Univers'tv besides the fi
nancial way," he said. "We need
money, but above all we need the
bya'ty which every man owes to the
university. One way in which the
alumni can help to make this a more
effertive university is by advising the
young men who come here to get into
nersonal touch with the faculty.

the world on this faculty. The young
men who come here are not getting
all there is in college for them if they
fill to tnke advantage of their oppor
tunity to come into intimate contact
with these men."
About ninety Stanford men and wo
men gathered in the Sigma Nu house
last night at the dinner given in hon
or of the Advisory Board of the Alum
ni Association by .J. E. McDowell,
'00, and Dr. T. M. Williams, '97, local
members of the Board. The purpose
of the dinner was to afford an oppor
tunity for the various classes of Staf
ford people, students, alumni, and
faculty, to become better acquainted
and to discuss informally all sorts
of questions tbftt affect the University.
There was about an equal division be
tween the three classes in the men and
women present, and the spirit of the
meeting was most clearly indicated
when upon the motion of K. L.
