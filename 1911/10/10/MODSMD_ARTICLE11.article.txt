# Last Nights Gathering.
## 
### 
Here is cooperation and friendly
feeling. Trustees, faculty, alumni,
students all in one big gathering*
The meeting last night could not have

been a greater success
or more significant of
what is to be the order
of things here in the fu-

ture. Everyone will know what the
other man's motives are and the good
that can come from this is difficult
to measure. The telegram sent to
Dr. Jordan wishing him Godspeed and
welcome back to America and the
University was the culmination of a
day and a night of gratifying results.
The speeches of last evening, as re
ported tonight in the Daily Palo Alto,
were singularly full of that spirit
which gives credit to those who are
trying and doing their best. The year
begun last August is gaining ground
as a year of a new era full of results.
