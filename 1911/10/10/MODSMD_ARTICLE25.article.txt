# UNDERCLASS DEBATERS DIVIDE INTO SQUADS
## TO TRY FOR PLACES ON TEAMS OCTOBER 24. Freshmen Are Showing More Interest In the Coming Contest Than the Sophomores. 
### 
Announcement is made today by the
committee in charge of the try-outs
for places on the Sophomore-Fresh
man debating teams, that the men who
have already signed up have been
divided into squads and have been
given hides on which to argue. The
question which the underclassme i
will discuss in trying out for places
on lhe two teams is the same as thai
which will be the theme for argument
in the Intercollegiate debate with Cali
frnia, namely, that of the recall of
the judiciary.
Those men who signified a prefer
ence were given the side they desired.
Those who allowed the committee to
choose the contention which they will
uphold were placed by lot. This divi
sion was affected so as to enable the
debaters to begin work on preparation
of arguments immediately. The try
outs will be held on October 24 in the
Chapel. The Intersociety Debating
Committee is to have charge and the
selection of the underclass trio will
be carried out in the same way as in
previous years.
The first-year class has shown a
great interest in the debate and a
large number of 1915 orators have
handed in their names to the com
mittee. The Sophomores thus far
have exhibited an apathetic disposi
tion to try for their team. Within the
next week, however, many more of
the second-year men are expected to
sigrt up. All the men who sign late
will be assigned to squads as have
those who presented their names
earlier. The squads follow:
Sophomores—Squad I—Affirmative
S. V. Claggett, C. C. Close, P. Pier,
Negative, V. M. Brydolf, T. L. Smith.
