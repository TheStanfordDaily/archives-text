# PLANS BEING SHAPED FOR JUNIOR PLUG UGLY.
## Committee Still Desirous of Securing Suggestions For Poster From Members of Class 
### 
All the plans of the committee in
charge of the Junior Plug Ugly are
rapidly becoming shaped and in a
short time those in the cast of charac
ters of the play will be busy rehears
ing.
Material for the poster is in the
hands of the committee but as the
poster will not lie finally written un
til the last of the week, the juniors
have yet time to send in their con
tributions. Suggestions should be
unsigned and sent to P. O. Box 1092,
before the end of the present week.
The Plug Ugly show is to be held
at the track, on a platform similar to
that constructed for the same affair
last year. October 28 has been defi
nitely decided as the date.
The members of the committee are
writing the play and expect to soon
complete their labors. The cast will
then be selected from among the com
mittee members and other Juniors,
and rehearsals commenced.
