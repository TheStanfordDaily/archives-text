# Indians Will Benefit By Box.
## 
### 
The Indians of Northern California
are soon to reap the benefit of the
work of Stanford women of late. As
has been the custom for several years
past, the Social Service Committee of
the Young Women's Christian Associa
tion is preparing a box to be sent
t ) the northern dwellers.
Weird and wonderful are the pack
ages of discarded finery which are
daily being dropped into the two col
lection boxes, one in the Rest Room,
and the other at the Delta Gamma
house. All women students who have
contributions of cast off ribbons, trin
kets, hats, etc., may bring them to one
of these places immediately. The com
mittee will send the box about October
30.
