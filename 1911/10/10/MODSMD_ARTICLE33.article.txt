So many substitutes were on the
second Varsity that no one who was
in the original line-up was playing at
the end of the second half.
• • • •
The rest of the substitutes in the
scrum, including Smith, Lyons, Stein
dorff, R. C. Shaw, and Voorhies, fought
hard while they were in the game.
* * * *
In the second half, Harlowe, E. C.
Shaw, Copeland, Hinrichsen, Amund
sen, Davis and Morris were respon
sible for many long gains in passing
bouts.
• • • •
As inside live, Fenstermacher played
a vigorous game. He was in the play
all of the time and figured in several
passing rushes. His passing is some
what inaccurate as yet.
♦ * * *
Meyer and Driver showed weak
ness on the defense, both in selecting
chances to tackle and in letting their
men slip away through their arms.
Roth men are playing a faster game
than earlier in the season.
• * * •
Rogardus played a clever game as

ways found touch at the outermost
limit. On the defense, his tackling
saved a St. Mary's score several times.
* * * *
Dolan, the big Nevada forward, was

stage of the game managed to buck
every onslaught of the heavy Marine
scrum.

Considering the short time which
