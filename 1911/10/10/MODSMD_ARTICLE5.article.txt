Entries iu Mile and Half.
Moore and Cramer are entered in
the mile and half mile respectively.
Moore was a member of the varsity
track squad in 1910 and showed well
in the early meets of last season.
Cramer placed second in the half,
last year in the big meet at Berkeley.
He pressed Dowd of California to a
record breaking time in both the In
tercollegiate and Pacific Coast Con
ference meets, and if he is in shape
is a likely contender. Alderman, a
weight man, was ineligible last year
because of the transfer rule. He was
a star at Illinois University for two
years, being captain-elect in 1910. He
won many points for his former alma
mater ' at the Chicago conference
meets. Alderman wil compete in the
weights, and in the discus and javelin
throws.
Campbell is another man who was
kent out of the big struggle last spring
because of the transfer rule. He is
entered in the sprints, four-forty and
weights. Horine and Finney will rep
resent the Cardinal in the high
iump. Both were members of the
Varsity team last year. Horine has
added many points to Stanford score*
'n the past by his wonderful leapÂ®.
Dawson is a Freshman with a record
as a broad jumper in the southland
He is scheduled to enter this event
next Thursday.
