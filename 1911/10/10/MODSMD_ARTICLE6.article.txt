# ALL WILL TAKE PART IN WECOMING DR. JORDAN
## BIG BANQUET IS PLANNED FOR OCTOBER 27. President Will Arrive In San Francisco From Japan In About Two Weeks. 
### 
When President Jordan arrives in
San Francisco on the liner Manchuria
from his tour in the Orient, the Alum
ni Association of the University plan
to tender a banquet of welcome to him.
This will probably be given, if the
present plans of the Alumni go
through, on the evening of October
27, when the liner is due to arrive in
San Francisco.
It is planned to make the banquet
one in which all the members of the
University may participate in ex
pressing to President Jordan a wel
come at his return. University Trus
tees, Faculty, Alumni, and Undergrad
uates, men and women alike, will be
expected to attend the banquet. The
cost of service will be nominal and
will probably not exceed one dollar
per plate.
When the Advisory Board of the
Alumni Association met yesterday they
decided to hold the banquet. At the
meeting last evening at the Sigma Nu
house further details of the arrange
ments were completed.
It was at first decided to send a cable
gram to the President on the eve of
his sailing from Japan asking him to
set a date for the affair. When the
time tables were consulted, and the
difference in time between here and the
Orient was taken into consideration,
it was found that it would be impos
sible to reach him before the depart
ure of the "Manchuria." When this
was brought up before the meeting
it was decided to. send a letter at once
to the President, to be delivered on
the arrival of the steamer at Honolulu,
and asking for a cable reply. A com
mittee was appointed to draft the
letter and it was sent last evening.
According to the present plans Dr.
Jordan will arrive in San Francisco
in the, morning or early afternoon of
October 27, and unless he has some
previous engagement it is probable
that the banquet will be held that
evening.
It is hoped to make the banquet
representative of all departments of
the University. All the members of
the Board of Trustees, the Faculty,
the Alumni within reach of San Fran
cisco, and the Undergraduates, both
men and women, will be extended a
general informal invitation.
The Alumni feel that the occasion
's one which offers an unusual oppor
tunity for the entire collegiate body
to welcome the President on his re
turn from an extended absence from
the campus on sabbatical leave. They
further feel that it will be a suitable
time to cement the bonds of co-opera
tion and friendliness between the vari
ous departments of the University
control, and the student body, past
and present.
