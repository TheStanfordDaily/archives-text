# ST. MARY'S VARSITY TO ENGAGE 1915 TOMORROW
## STRONG OPPONENTS TO FACE FRESHMEN. Two Games Left-Santa Clara on Saturday and Berkeley High Next Wednesday. 
### 
St. Mary's football aggregation will
make their tirst campus appearance as
opponents to the Freshmen fifteen
on Stanford Field tomorrow after
noon at 4:45. This game was origin
ally scheduled with the Palo Alto
High School but a change of dates
was made on September 29, whereby
Palo Alto agreed to play on the 30th
with tomorrow's date filled by the
trans-bay Catholics.
The Blue and Gold Freshmen played
the St. Mary's fifteen last Saturday,
defeating them by the score of 16 to 6.
The Freshmen from the trans-bay
university opened up on the St. Mary's
players with a fast line-up. •
St, Mary's Strong.
St. Mary's has a strong team with
husky material in her scrum, and a
fast backline. Crack veterans of
their last year's Varsity form nearly
a majority in both divisions. With
such a team as their opponents Cali
fornia was fortunate to take a victory
from them. Tomorrow's game will de
termine to a great extent the relative
strengths of the two Freshman
fifteens, who are now unable to do
battle against each other.
In the one game this season with
the Mission Collegians from Santa
Clara the Freshmen were only able to
tie the visitors.. Since the dope
sheets credit St. Mary's with the
strongest of the two Catholic colleges,
a victory for the Freshmen will only
come after a hard battle.
No change is made in the forward
division of 1915's line-up. Wines,
Frost and Soper will appear in the
front rank, Dutton and Bloeser will
play at middle rank, while Wilson,
Haley and Jacomini are found in the
rear rank. Hausawa is to substitute
for the front row of packmen, Phares
and Hails in the middle rank and Bur
ns for the rear row men. Each of
these substitutes will probably be
used during the closing period-
In the backfield the only change in
positions will be the Return of Clark
to his original place at half; i-
The two five-eights positions are
safe in the hands of the Erb-Sim com
bine. Ross is slated for the center
position, while the wings will be bal
anced by the Templeton and Cookson
duet. Cookson has had ankle trouble
and will probably be used only in the
opening period. Hutchinson remains
the possessor of the full-back spot on
the line up. Steinhart is to be on the
side lines ready to step into the half
position at any point in the game.
This fast player is giving Clark a close
rub for the half title. Thoburn and
Wynne will also be on the side lines
and one or both of these men will
probably be called into the game be
fore its close.

tie the visitors.. Since the dope
sheets credit St. Mary's with the
strongest of the two Catholic colleges,
a victory for the Freshmen will only
come after a hard battle.
No change is made in the forward
division of 1915's line-up. Wines,
Frost and Soper will appear in the
front rank, Dutton and Bloeser will
play at middle rank, while Wilson,
Haley and Jacomini are found in the
rear rank. Hausawa is to substitute
for the front row of packmen, Phares
and Hails in the middle rank and Bur
ns for the rear row men. Each of
these substitutes will probably be
used during the closing period-
In the backfield the only change in
positions will be the Return of Clark
to his original place at half; i-
The two five-eights positions are
safe in the hands of the Erb-Sim com
bine. Ross is slated for the center
position, while the wings will be bal
anced by the Templeton and Cookson
duet. Cookson has had ankle trouble
and will probably be used only in the
opening period. Hutchinson remains
the possessor of the full-back spot on
the line up. Steinhart is to be on the
side lines ready to step into the half
position at any point in the game.
This fast player is giving Clark a close
rub for the half title. Thoburn and
Wynne will also be on the side lines
and one or both of these men will
probably be called into the game be
fore its close.
