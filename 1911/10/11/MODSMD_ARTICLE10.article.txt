# FRESHMEN DOWN ST. MARY'S IN HOTLY CONTESTED GAME
## Both Teams Strive Hard to Capture Laurels in Only Contest Scheduled Between These Two Aggregations. 
### 
Final Score, 15)ir>, 3; St. Mary's, 0.
One of the closest games of the
Freshman season was played this af
ternoon on Stanford Field when St.
Mary's met the first-year team.
This was the ouly game schedlued
between the Catholic collegianss from
Oakland X and the 1915 fifteen.
Santa Clara, the old time rival of
St. Mary's was represented in the
bleachers by a number of men watch
ing their intercollegiate opponent-to
be, planning to get advance "dope"
on the team.
The game opened with a forward
battle, the backs figuring only when
the ball leaked through, and then
returning it to line-outs. When eight
minutes of the twenty-five minute
half was left St. Mary's dribbled
through a lucky opening in the 1915
line and nothing stopped them until
they reached a 5-yard line-out. For
the next five minutes St. Mary's tried
hard to tally but could not engineer
one across.
St. Mary's Play Strongly.
The St. Mary's collegians played
a strong fighting game and showed up
to good advantage. Diavala and Leon
hardt, stars of former seasons, played
consistently.
For Stanford every man played for
all there was in him. The backfield
carried through several creditable
passing rushes, but the speed of the
visitors checkmated them before they
had covered much ground.
Erb figured prominently, especially
in touch-finding kicks. Haley and
Dutton played well in the forward
division.
The second half developed plenty
of excitement, although the general
character of play was ragged. The
last period opened with St. Mary's
having slightly the best of the mat
ter. The visitors even got confident
enough to try passing rush in the
backfield division but here they made
the vital mistake of the game. This
maneuver opened their heretofore well
kept defense. Sims intercepted and
started the Stanford forwards through
the opening to dribble till they were
under the shadow of St. Mary's goal
posts. Here Clark secured and sent
Krb across.
Swiftly Changing Game.
From this time on the bleachers
were kept on their feet by the swiftly
changing game. Spectacularly, the
ball jumped from one side of the field
to the other through a series bf rag
ged plays. Neither side was able to
lift the ball over, the line.
The playing of the two new wing.?,
who were introduced, in this perio 1

al material gains with his boots to
touch. Wynne executed a clever 20
yard run after he had secured the
pigskin on a lucky bounce and neatly
swerved the onrushing visitors.

Final Score, 15)ir>, 3; St. Mary's, 0.
One of the closest games of the
Freshman season was played this af
ternoon on Stanford Field when St.
Mary's met the first-year team.
This was the ouly game schedlued
between the Catholic collegianss from
Oakland X and the 1915 fifteen.
Santa Clara, the old time rival of
St. Mary's was represented in the
bleachers by a number of men watch
ing their intercollegiate opponent-to
be, planning to get advance "dope"
on the team.
The game opened with a forward
battle, the backs figuring only when
the ball leaked through, and then
returning it to line-outs. When eight
minutes of the twenty-five minute
half was left St. Mary's dribbled
through a lucky opening in the 1915
line and nothing stopped them until
they reached a 5-yard line-out. For
the next five minutes St. Mary's tried
hard to tally but could not engineer
one across.
St. Mary's Play Strongly.
The St. Mary's collegians played
a strong fighting game and showed up
to good advantage. Diavala and Leon
hardt, stars of former seasons, played
consistently.
For Stanford every man played for
all there was in him. The backfield
carried through several creditable
passing rushes, but the speed of the
visitors checkmated them before they
had covered much ground.
Erb figured prominently, especially
in touch-finding kicks. Haley and
Dutton played well in the forward
division.
The second half developed plenty
of excitement, although the general
character of play was ragged. The
last period opened with St. Mary's
having slightly the best of the mat
ter. The visitors even got confident
enough to try passing rush in the
backfield division but here they made
the vital mistake of the game. This
maneuver opened their heretofore well
kept defense. Sims intercepted and
started the Stanford forwards through
the opening to dribble till they were
under the shadow of St. Mary's goal
posts. Here Clark secured and sent
Krb across.
Swiftly Changing Game.
From this time on the bleachers
were kept on their feet by the swiftly
changing game. Spectacularly, the
ball jumped from one side of the field
to the other through a series bf rag
ged plays. Neither side was able to
lift the ball over, the line.
The playing of the two new wing.?,
who were introduced, in this perio 1
was excellent. Thoburn found sever
al material gains with his boots to
touch. Wynne executed a clever 20
yard run after he had secured the
pigskin on a lucky bounce and neatly
swerved the onrushing visitors.

Final Score, 15)ir>, 3; St. Mary's, 0.
One of the closest games of the
Freshman season was played this af
ternoon on Stanford Field when St.
Mary's met the first-year team.
This was the ouly game schedlued
between the Catholic collegianss from
Oakland X and the 1915 fifteen.
Santa Clara, the old time rival of
St. Mary's was represented in the
bleachers by a number of men watch
ing their intercollegiate opponent-to
be, planning to get advance "dope"
on the team.
The game opened with a forward
battle, the backs figuring only when
the ball leaked through, and then
returning it to line-outs. When eight
minutes of the twenty-five minute
half was left St. Mary's dribbled
through a lucky opening in the 1915
line and nothing stopped them until
they reached a 5-yard line-out. For
the next five minutes St. Mary's tried
hard to tally but could not engineer
one across.
St. Mary's Play Strongly.
The St. Mary's collegians played
a strong fighting game and showed up
to good advantage. Diavala and Leon
hardt, stars of former seasons, played
consistently.
For Stanford every man played for
all there was in him. The backfield
carried through several creditable
passing rushes, but the speed of the
visitors checkmated them before they
had covered much ground.
Erb figured prominently, especially
in touch-finding kicks. Haley and
Dutton played well in the forward
division.
The second half developed plenty
of excitement, although the general
character of play was ragged. The
last period opened with St. Mary's
having slightly the best of the mat
ter. The visitors even got confident
enough to try passing rush in the
backfield division but here they made
the vital mistake of the game. This
maneuver opened their heretofore well
kept defense. Sims intercepted and
started the Stanford forwards through
the opening to dribble till they were
under the shadow of St. Mary's goal
posts. Here Clark secured and sent
Krb across.
Swiftly Changing Game.
From this time on the bleachers
were kept on their feet by the swiftly
changing game. Spectacularly, the
ball jumped from one side of the field
to the other through a series bf rag
ged plays. Neither side was able to
lift the ball over, the line.
The playing of the two new wing.?,
who were introduced, in this perio 1
was excellent. Thoburn found sever
al material gains with his boots to
touch. Wynne executed a clever 20
yard run after he had secured the
pigskin on a lucky bounce and neatly
swerved the onrushing visitors.

First Hall'.
On Haley's kick-off a fiercely con
tested ruck resulted which ended in
touch on Stanford's 40. Erb found

ey and Clark by booting gained mid
field touch. Erb kicked to the side
lines at 35, and Hutshinson stopped
the St. Mary's advance with a boot
to the same mark. Stoltz gained
touch at the Freshman 40. The bat
tle centered at the midfield of the
turf until the Catholic forwards drib
bed out at 30. Another of Erb's pret
ty spirals found touch at midfield.
Cookson added 20 Dribbling out
from a ruck , Cann booted on the
ground nearly to the goal line, but
Hausawa's 10 yard run stopped the
advance. Wilson dribbled to touch at
the Oakland team's 40. Leonhardt
free-kicked to touch at the Freshman

players until Incell and Simpson
sprinted 40. Haley free-kicked 35
yards to touch from his own goal line.
