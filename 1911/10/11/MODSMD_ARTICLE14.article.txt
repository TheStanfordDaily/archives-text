It is not too early to warn the Jun
ior Class that arrangements should
be made for the Opera to be given
next semester. Two years ago the

committee chosen by the
class president did not
begin work until January,
with the result that the

performance was far from satisfac
tory, and far below standard. The ex
ample set by this fault helped the
Juniors of last year to begin their
preparations early in the first semes
ter. Because of the warning one of
the most successful of original operas
was produced. Productions that will
be remembered and that will not be
weak performances cannot be written
even in a few months. Announce
ment should be made that the Class
desires manuscripts.
