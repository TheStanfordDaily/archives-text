# VARSITY RUGBY SEASON IS HARROWING DOWN.
## Five Games Remain Before the California Contest.—Most Important, November 1 and 4. 
### 
With the present week the Stan
ford Varsity steps into the final and.
most interesting section of its rugby
season. On next Saturday the rugby
ites of the University of Nevada will
forsake the sagebrush for the Stan
ford turf. The comparative-score
"dopesters" will find exercise here,
since this team was beaten on their
Own field by California last Saturday,
by a score of 29-0.
On the following Saturday, October I
2i, the players will pack their grips
for the Southland, where they will
face the strong team representing the i
combined departments of the ITniver
sity of Southern California at Los
Angeles. This will be the only oppor
tunity of the Varsity men to journey
away from the scholastic atmosphere
o!' fie campus for a game.
Afti ■ another set-to with the Olym
pics on October 28, the dates, Novem
ber- 1 and 4, will see contests which
will almost, rival the intercollegiate
contests in interest. The games with
the All-British Columbia, or "Double
V" team, prom'ses to develop gru ol
ling and spectacular rugby. Thi 1 1 '
doubt as to the certainty of this ga i
has now lnei removed, and the co ■
bined Victcrii aid Vancouver teanni
are now ha ' at. practice for their
invasion o the "States." Tliey pro
pose to wipe out the defeats wbic'i
they have suffered individually at th *
hands of California and Stanford
These will be the last games before
the premier contest with the wearers
of the big "C" o'i November 11.
