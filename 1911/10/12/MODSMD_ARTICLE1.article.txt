### 
The officers of the Students' Guild,
the organization of Stanford men and
women designed to care for all cases
of sickness occuring among students,
has completed the preliminary ar
rangements for the sale of a part of
its abandoned hospital property o i
L.vtton avenue, Halo Alto. The por
tion sold is what was known as the
nurses' cottage. J. .1. Morris, a real
estate dealer of the nearby city, is the
purchaser. The order of court sanc
tioning the sale has been received by
the Guild and the final papers will he
filed in a few days. $2500 is the
amount received for the property.
The old Palo Alto hospital of the
Guild has not beeen used by the stu
dents since 1909. At that time it wai
leased to the Peninsula Hospital com
pany, who used it for six months, fi
nally abandoning it to occupy their
new building.
It is the purpose of the members
of the Guild to place the money in the
Building and Loan Association of Palo
Alto and later to use it in the con
struction of the new hospital near
Felt Lake. Although the amount is
by no means sufficient to erect the
new buildings it will make a basis
upon which to work. It is probable
that the Guild will dispose of the ba
lance of their Palo Alto property, thus
securing more money for the new in
stitution. Actual construction work
on the Felt Lake house will not be
started until next spring.
