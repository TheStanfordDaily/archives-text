# TRACKMEN MEET TODAY ON BERKELEY OVAL.
## Stanford Team is Competing With State's Best Athletesâ€”"Dad" Moulton goes. 
### 
Twelve athletes, in charge of trainer
"Dad" Moulton, left this morning for
Berkeley to compete in the big track
meet of the P. A. A., which is being
held on the California oval today.
The men who are representing the
Cardinal are contesting with many of
the best trackmen in the state and
are giving a good account of them
selves. The contest is more of an in
dividual affair than a team match.
The men who represent Stanford are
T. M. Cramer, '11, R. S. Worthington,
'12, C. L. Moore. ' 12, M. N. Alderman,
'12. W. R. Finney, '12, E. P. Campbell.
'13. J. A. Miller. '13, G. L. Horine, '13,
W. J. Dodge, '13, C. G. Dnffin, '13, V. M.
Smith. '14, and D. Dawson, '15. This
number of men making up the team
broke the hoodoo of thirteen, since G.
Bevier, '11, was unable to make the
trip.
