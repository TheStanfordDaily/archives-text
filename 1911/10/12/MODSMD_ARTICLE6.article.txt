### 
A memorial volume in honor of
Professor .John Ernst Matzke, late
head of the Department of Romanic
Langua ;es, is being prepared at the
office oi the Stanford Press as one
cf the University publications. The
volume contains, besides two unpub
lished papers by Professor Matzke,
inierrus other contributions in his
memory by his colleagues in the vari
ous language departments. The pub
lication of the book is in direct charge
o" Professor Ewald Fliigel, of the
Department of English Philology.
Dr. Matzke died in September, 1910,
in the City of Mexico, while attending
the celebration of the founding of the
National University of Mexico, as the
representative of Stanford University.
Besides the two unpublished papers
by Professor Matzke the book will con
tain thirteen other contributions cov
nacademic discussions of works
i i Italian, German, French, Old Eng
lish. Latin, and Etruscan, and a bib
!iography of Professor Matzke's works.
The lock is to le bouhd in boards,
a id will be printed on the best paper.
r t will contain a cut of Professor
Matzke on a special insert of finished
paper.
The two unnubiished papers by Pro
fessor Matzke are entitled "Gaston
Paris" and"The Development of Ro
manic Dialectology." The first is in
the nature of a tribute to Paris, the
great French student of Roman Phil
ology, and the second is self-explana
tory. There follows Professor M. B.
Anderson's rhymed translation of the
Lord's Prayer, as given in Dante's
"Purgatorio." This is an excerpt from
I'ie translation of the "Divide Comedy,"

which Professor Anderson has been
working on for several years.
"The Doctrine of Versiniilitude in
French and English Criticism of the
Seventeenth Century," by Professor
H. M. Alden, late professor of Eng
lish at Stanford and now connected
with the Faculty of the University of
Illinois, is the next contribution.
Professor C. G. Allen, of the Ro
manic Languages Department, dis
cusses the relation between two old
legends in French and German deal
ing with the same story, that of the
life of Pope Gregory. The results
of his investigations lead to an inter
esting conclusion in regard to the
priority of the legends.
Professor W. D. Briggs, of the Eng
lish Department, in his contribution,
points out the relation between a por
tion of the "Faerie Queene" and Boc
caccio's "Fiametta." He compares
them passage for passage and shows
that Spencer drew from the Boccaccio
story in his later poem.
There are many other contributions
of note, but probably that which will
attract the widest notice is the pub'i
cation by Professor G. Hempl, of the
Germanic Languages Department, of
his findings in regard to the decipher
ing of the mysterious Etruscan in
scriptions. The discussion is highly
technical. It involves many of the
remarkable discoveries made by Dr.
Hempl concerning the Etruscan writ
ings as originally announced some two
years ago. At that time the inscrip
tions were declared decipherable, af
ter some of the world's most able
philologists had failed to solve their
riddle.

legends in French and German deal
ing with the same story, that of the
life of Pope Gregory. The results
of his investigations lead to an inter
esting conclusion in regard to the
priority of the legends.
Professor W. D. Briggs, of the Eng
lish Department, in his contribution,
points out the relation between a por
tion of the "Faerie Queene" and Boc
caccio's "Fiametta." He compares
them passage for passage and shows
that Spencer drew from the Boccaccio
story in his later poem.
There are many other contributions
of note, but probably that which will
attract the widest notice is the pub'i
cation by Professor G. Hempl, of the
Germanic Languages Department, of
his findings in regard to the decipher
ing of the mysterious Etruscan in
scriptions. The discussion is highly
technical. It involves many of the
remarkable discoveries made by Dr.
Hempl concerning the Etruscan writ
ings as originally announced some two
years ago. At that time the inscrip
tions were declared decipherable, af
ter some of the world's most able
philologists had failed to solve their
riddle.
