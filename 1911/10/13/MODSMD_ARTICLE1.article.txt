## TWENTY-SIX POINTS TAKEN BY VARSITY. Olympic Club Wins Meet With Veteran Entries.—Alderman Sets Record in Discus. 
### 
Placing second in the meet hehl by
the Pacific Athletic Association and
fixing the championships for this year
the Stanford track and field men
covered themselves with a world of
glory yesterday on the Berkeley ova 1 .
First place was won by the Olymp'c
Club of San Francisco with a team o
world's champions, American cham
pions and veterans of many meets
with a total of fifty-three points
The Stanford team piled up a total o'
twenty-six points, nosing ont the Pas
time Athletic Club by two points for
second position.
One American record was broke"
and a P. A. A. record was established
during the meet. Snedigar, the ver
satile verteran from the Olympic CIu
broke hi* own record of 1C5 feet in ,
the javelin throw made last year at
the Pittsburg championships, by hurl- |
ing the stick 166 feet and 1 inch yester- i
day. A Stanford man was accredited |
with a record when Alderman, '12,
chalked up a win in the discus throw
at. 121 feet and 1 inch. This is the
first time that this event has received
a recognized place in the P. A. A.
championships.
Take Four Firsts.
Other point winners for Stanford
were Campbell in the 440; Dawson in
the broad jump; Horine and Finney in
the high jump; and Miller in the pole
vault. Alderman, Campbell, Dawson,
and Horine were credited with first
places in their events, while Miller |
and Finney took seconds. Miller at
the close of the last three jumps for
the pole vault was tied with Kendrick j
of the Olympic club, but in the jump
off he received the second place dec - ;
sion.
The meet was characterized by th
wonderful work of the veterans en
tered in the meet. Men who had been
out of college for years took fir't
places with ease from the younger
athletes and set up extraordinary
marks during the competition. Sicd ; -
gar, six years cut of college, was th j
best individual performer. He won
seventeen points, consisting o! four
seconds and a first. One of the se
conds was not allowed by (he official
been use of the failure of one of the
weights to reach standard require
ment:'. Gerhardt. another veteran
who has been on the track for years
adde 1 ten points to the Olympic scor?
1;v taking two first places in the
dashes in speedy time. Morris, th"
Stanford graduate, wearing the color
of the Olympic club, added another
brae2 of firsts to their big score when
lie romped in a winner in both hurdle
anion-,' a slow field which never press
ed him. Still another veteran win
made ten -points was Mahoney, un
attached, who captured both the sho
a v, d the hammer.
<••rKj'bcll Wins HO,
Campbell covered himself with
glory in the 140 by winning the event
in 51 seconds flat. This is considere 1
very gcod time for this season of th
year. He ran a heady race, hanging
bn rt k for the first half of the distance
and allowing Hoenisch of the Pa -
times to run himself out setting th"
pace. Campbell then came up strong
and finished three yeards in front o'
Vitousek of California, who nosed on
the drooping Moenisch in the last
fifty yards.
One of the surprises of the day wa 1
the victory of Dawson, "ir>, over the
veteran Snedigar in the broad jump
Snedigar has seldom been beaten in
this event and placed in it in the classv
National Championships at Pittsburg
Dawson's jump of 22 feet, and 3 1-2
inches defeated Snedigar by 3-4 of a -
inch. The jump is considered remark
ably good for a man who has had sue''
little training as Dawson.
Miller tied with Kendrick In the pole
at 11 feet, 4 inches. On the jump-off
for the medals and points, however,
he was given second place.
lloriiu> Easy Winner.
Horine won the high jump in easy
fashion with his faultless form. Fin
ney was second for Stanford. The i
height of the bar at the winning jump j
was 5 feet, 11 1-4 inches.
Alderman's winning throw in the i
discus was far ahead of all competi
tors. He will be credited with the 1
P. A. A. record for the performance.
Campbell started in the 220 yard j
dash and won his heat against a fast I
field in 23 2-5. lie did not start in j
the finals, however.
In the five mile event Stanford had !
three entries. Worthington, Bevier and
Dodge. N'one of these men were with
in striking distance at the finish, but
this was clue more to inexperience
in running through the long grind,
than to any lack of ability or endur
ance. Worthington finished and would
probably have placed had he had more j
experience in the event. The run
ners went around the tiny Berkeley j
oval twenty-six and a half times in J
this event before the finish was
reached.
Rose, world's champion shot putter
could not chalk up a. mark better than
45 feet and 8 inches in his favorite
event. This is five feet short of his
record. Other good marks were those
of Benneson, representing Santa Clara
i in the mile, Mahoney in the hammer,
and Lee of the Pastime club, who fin
ished first in the five mile grind.

In the five mile event Stanford had !
three entries. Worthington, Bevier and
Dodge. N'one of these men were with
in striking distance at the finish, but
this was clue more to inexperience
in running through the long grind,
than to any lack of ability or endur

Stanford graduate, wearing the color

<••rKj'bcll Wins HO,
Campbell covered himself with
glory in the 140 by winning the event
in 51 seconds flat. This is considere 1
very gcod time for this season of th
year. He ran a heady race, hanging
bn rt k for the first half of the distance
and allowing Hoenisch of the Pa -
times to run himself out setting th"
pace. Campbell then came up strong
and finished three yeards in front o'
Vitousek of California, who nosed on
the drooping Moenisch in the last
fifty yards.
One of the surprises of the day wa 1
the victory of Dawson, "ir>, over the
veteran Snedigar in the broad jump
Snedigar has seldom been beaten in
this event and placed in it in the classv
National Championships at Pittsburg
Dawson's jump of 22 feet, and 3 1-2
inches defeated Snedigar by 3-4 of a -
inch. The jump is considered remark
ably good for a man who has had sue''
little training as Dawson.
Miller tied with Kendrick In the pole
at 11 feet, 4 inches. On the jump-off
for the medals and points, however,
he was given second place.
lloriiu> Easy Winner.
Horine won the high jump in easy
fashion with his faultless form. Fin
ney was second for Stanford. The i
height of the bar at the winning jump j
was 5 feet, 11 1-4 inches.
Alderman's winning throw in the i
discus was far ahead of all competi
tors. He will be credited with the 1
P. A. A. record for the performance.
Campbell started in the 220 yard j
dash and won his heat against a fast I
field in 23 2-5. lie did not start in j
the finals, however.
In the five mile event Stanford had !
three entries. Worthington, Bevier and
Dodge. N'one of these men were with
in striking distance at the finish, but
this was clue more to inexperience
in running through the long grind,
than to any lack of ability or endur
ance. Worthington finished and would
probably have placed had he had more j
experience in the event. The run
ners went around the tiny Berkeley j
oval twenty-six and a half times in J
this event before the finish was
reached.
Rose, world's champion shot putter
could not chalk up a. mark better than
45 feet and 8 inches in his favorite
event. This is five feet short of his
record. Other good marks were those
of Benneson, representing Santa Clara
i in the mile, Mahoney in the hammer,
and Lee of the Pastime club, who fin
ished first in the five mile grind.
