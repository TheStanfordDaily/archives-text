# NEVADANS HERE READY TO MEET CARDINAL TEAM
## SAGEBRUSH PLAYERS REACH THE CAMPUS TODAY. Freshmen in Fine Fettle Will Play the Fast Santa Clarans Tomorrow Afternoon. 
### 
Nevada's rugby representatives ar
rived 011 the campus this morning
ready to meet the Stanford Varsity
on Stanford Field tomorrow afternoon
at. 3:30 o'clock. The Sagebrush ath
letes will be given a chance to prac
tice on the turf this afternoon so as
to familarize themselves with the low
land climate. Reno is some five thous
and feet above the sea and the visitors
will have only one practice in which to
become acclimated. They are familiar
with the play on a sod field, as their
own field is an exceptionally fine one,
being patterned after the local grass
gridiron.
Xevada Fighting Team.
The Nevada players have always
proved a hard fighting group and have
won the admiration of the Stanford
players for the strong team they de
velop from a University of only two
hundred students. Last Saturday they
lost to the Blue and Gold players at
I Reno by a score of 29 to 0, but the
I sturdy fight and hard defence of the
Desert players is not shown by this
score. Last year Nevada held the
Stanford team to an 8-0 score in Reno.
The visitors tomorrow will use the
seven man scrum with the eighth man
as a rover. Their pack is lighter than
I Stanford's but is credited with unusual
| speed. Four Freshmen are included in
I their backfield, as follows: Bringham
and Knight, fives: Curtin, center; and
Sitz, fullback.
Coach Presley will send the strong
est fifteen possible into the field,
omitting Watkins, Frank, Gard, Reeves
and Kern. These men are practically
in perfect shape again and have been
out in togs this week. It is advisable,
however, to keep them out of harm's
way tomorrow.
The usual pack, eight strong, will
be pitted against the visitors tomor
row. Cass will play at half. Harrigan
and Risling will be placed at the fives.
Erb takes the center three position.
Geissler and T. Sanborn are to bal
ance the wings. Brown again assumes
the fullback responsibility.
IDir, Plays Santa Clara.
The Freshman-Santa Clara curtain
raiser to the Varsity's set-to at 2:30.
promises to be of the same caliber
as Hie 1915—St. Mary's contest last
Wednesday. St. Mary's teams have
generally proved the better of the two
Cathclic Colleges in their yearly
matches. For this reason the victory
and hard playing of last Wednesday
presage a wiping out the tie score to
which the Santa Clarans held thjf
Fre;-hmen on September 27. This will
br the last Freshman appearance but
one. The present schedule closes on
next Wednesday, when 1915 will play
the Berkeley High fifteen.
The Mission collegians have an un
usually heavy pack, said to average
190. In the last game they used the
seven man formation with breakaways
playing at the corners. This seemed
to work effectively and will probably
be used tomorrow.
One Change Among Freshmen.
The only change in the Cardinal
babes' forwards will be the appear
ance of Burris as Button's middle rank
partner. Bloeser, whose place he will
fill, will be out of the game on
account of minor injuries.
t'i the backfield. Cookson and Tho
burn will alternate at center. Wynne
will be the running mate to Templeton
on the wing. Wynee won his place on
the backline in the showing that he
made in second half of the game
w'th the St. Mary's team. No further
changes are announced.
