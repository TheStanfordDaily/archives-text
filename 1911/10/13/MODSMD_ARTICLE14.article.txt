# A 						Bad Practice.

### 
All off-color jokes at public initia
tions have been condemned by the
University Conference, an organiza
tion composed of men representative

of the Student Body. That
is a right move. It is a
wonder to us that some
thing was not done before,

or that some action has not been taken
to do away with the decidedly un-
Stanford-like practice. The custom
of injecting an additional amount of
"spice" into each initiation has grown
in about three years from a harmless
usage to a condition of which notice
must be taken.
It has been the belief of many men
ui>on being initiated and the organiza
tions which direct the performances
that the day's entertainment falls
short of a success unless it includes
in its make-up a number of broad
allusions which the men themselves
would hesitate to utter in any gather
ing where they were not decorated in
the absurd initiation costumes appear
ing as individuals which they are not.
It is only a question of applying the
rules of ordinary conduct to these ini
tiations. When ladies are present
there is only one right way of talking
and acting. We see no room for deny
ing that. We believe that the prac
tice is merely another case of thought
lessness, and a custom that has been
gaining ground as it went along, with
no apparent opposition.
