game.

The California backfield from pres
ent indications will be the same as in
the varsity game last year except for
the position left vacant by Dwiggins.
Morris at half, Elliott and Stroud at
five-eights and Peart, Allen and Watts
on the three-quarter line are all play
ing in good form and it is hardly likely
that any <>112 them will be displaced.

ing in Hearst Hall yesterday, discuss
ing plans for a spring festival to be
given by the women of the University

Coach Schaeffer announced yester
day the names of the freshmen who
will represent the blue and gold
in the game against the University of
'Southern California fifteen tomorrow.
No last-minute surprises were sprung
by the California coach, who was
largely influenced in his selection by
L. Watts, for the simple reason the
varsity wing has done much to develop
the baby squad and has devoted more
time to this department than Schaeffer
himself.

In selecting Bogardus, however, as
baby captain, a mild sensation wa i
slipped over on the prophets, as an
other name had been frequently men
tioned as the probable recipient of
the honor. The baby skioper is regis
tered from Berkeley High School, and
has easily outdistanced his rivals for
the occupancy of the fullback position.
