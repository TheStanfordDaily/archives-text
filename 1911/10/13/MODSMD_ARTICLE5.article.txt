# PROGRAM OF SURPRISES IN "FOLLIES OF STANFORD"
## Football Show Cast Is Announced by Chairman Appointed by Executive Committee.â€”Ram's Head Club Compiles the Stunts. 
### 
Two and one half hours of music,
against a background of a summer
resort hotel, with all its features of
"guests," elevator and bell boys, and
clerks, will make up the Stanford Foot
ball Show of 1911. The program and
full list of the cast was given out today
by the Committee apointed by the Ex
ecutive Committee to take charge of
the performance this year. Chairman
J. H. Forbes, '13, has been much aided
in the compiling of the Show by the
Ramshead Society and members of
other organizations.
Over forty persons will give twenty
five distinct songs and stunts, whether
individually, in choruses or in small
companies in skits. The performance
consists of two acts with continuous
vaudeville, and the curtain will not
fall between the different scenes. To
change scenery between the acts the
stage will simply be darkened, and
stunts will continue throughout the
scene-shifting, so that, literally, there
w 11 be "continuous vaudeville."
Among the original musical compo
sitions all written for the Show, and to
be g'ven mostly by their composers,
are: "Everybody's Busy," "Dreaming,"
"Little Bantam Rooster Rag." "I Can't
Satisfy My Family," "Puppy Love."
etc.
With the general background of the
summer resort hotel, the two acts
have their scenery set for the hayfield
adjoining the hotel, and the lobby of
the hostelry. Every possible excuse

will be used to make the Show a rush
of comedy and music. There will be a
comparatively small amount of "talk"
and the action will be fast. The main
aim of the Show Committee is to make
the entire production a surprise, and
in keeping with the spirit of the night
after the Big Game.
It will be the order of the evening
that as fast as one stunt is completed
another will be on the boards. The
different songs or skits will contain
plenty of local color, with the "Follies
j of Stanford" emphasized.
