# WE NEED THE UNION
## AUGUST EXAMINATIONS HAVE BEEN ABOLISHED ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS TO COME IN JUNE. College Entrance Board Questions Are To Be Used Entirely at Stanford Hereafter. 
### 
The University authorities have
abolished August entrance examina
tions and from now on all wishing to
enter Stanford without regular prep
aration must take the tests given by
the College Entrance Examination
Board in June. For the past few
years the numbers that have taken
entrance examinations in August
have fallen off to such a degree that
the University does not think it worth
while to continue the custom.
The questions given by the College
Enhance Examination Board are pre
pared by a committee Ghosen from the
representatives of twenty univer
sities and twenty preparatory schools
in America. The questions are sent
sealed to the various places where
the examinations may be taken. The
papers are then sent on to New York,
where they are corrected and marked
by three different judges. In this
way absolute fairness is assured.
As educational progress increases
and the preparatory schools adjust
their curriculums to the requirements
of the universities, entrance examina
tions are becoming less important.
This is very noticeable all over the
United States, particularly so in Cali
fornia.
