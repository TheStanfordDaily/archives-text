Haley was chosen captain of
the Freshman fifteen by his
teammates before their appear
ance on the lield Saturday
afternoon. The 1J)1.» captain
lias been the mainstay of the
pack at break-atvay during the
season. II is powerful boot has
been a regular feature of each
frame. Haley registers in the
Pre-Legal Department from
San Francisco, and is a mem
ber of the Kappa Sigma fra
ternity.

Fight, fight, fight, throughout the
duration of thirty minute halves and
no score, is the summing up of the
hardest game on the Freshman sched
ule, between 1915 and Santa Clara on
Stanford Field, Saturday afternoon.
For the second time in one season
two strong teams met. and tie scores
resulted. Nothing shows better the
consistency of the play of these rugby
units.
In general, the course of events was
a repetition of the game with St.
Mary's on Wednesday, a rapid shifting
of the play from the visitors' territory
to the Freshman's; a rapid change
from the tactics of defense to those of
offense.
Passing: Hushes Figure.
Clark started off the backfield in
several well-engineered passing rushes
but they were unable to pierce the
Missioners' defensive armor. The

Santa Clara collegians fought all the
way through with never the let up
that allows a chance score to get
through.
Weighing in the balance the play
of the teams,, a slight advantage goes
to the Cardinal Freshmen. At least
three times the babies were on the
point of scoring but access to the
scoreboard was denied through Santa
Clara's firm defense. Again a little
luck would have given a tally to
Clark's missed goal from a 25 yard
free kick.
Game Starts Slow.
The game started slow, with each
team trying the others strength. Af
ter ten minutes Santa Clara was
close to the Freshman's line. Tho
burn secured from the loose and was
hard pressed. But a pass to Sim
found a kick out of danger to 25.
Clark immediately added 20 yards
more with a touch finding kick.
Santa Clara continued to keep the
ball dangerously near 1915's line,
piercing to the 5 and again to the 10.
The Cardinal forwards then massed
behind thp ball and carried it to mid
field. Templeton, Sim and Wynne
completed the reversal by a passing
rush to Santa Clara's 20.
A neat passing rally. Erb, Sim. Tho
burn. Wynne, Thoburn, took the ball
from 25 to 10. An immediate turn
about followed through kicks by Stew
art and Hotels .and a substantial run
by Best.
Two minutes later the Freshmen
