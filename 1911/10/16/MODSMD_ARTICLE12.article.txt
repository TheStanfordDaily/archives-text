# ALL-AROUND TEAMWORK OVERWHELMS NEVADA
## VARSITY PILES UP 41—0 SCORE SATURDAY. Continual Improvement in Cardinal Team Brings Joy to Watchers. Good Kicking Evident. 
### 
Altho fighting gamely on the de-'
fence in the game on Stanford Field
last Saturday, Nevada,.was unable to
prevent the Cardinal machine from
rolling up a big score, until at the
close of the second half the tally
board read, Stanford 41, Nevada 0.
The visitors had a team decidedly
lighter than the Varsity's, and were
unable to cope with their opponents,
tactic for tactic. Their speed in fol
lowing up when the Cardinal forwards
heeled out the ball, sent many a clean
Stanford passing rush awry. They
were especially quick in securing from
the loose. Nevada was good in kick
ing and saved several Cardinal tries
by substantial, yard gaining, touch
finders.
Nevada Weak In Liqeonts.
The Blue men could do little in the
lineouts with such giants aa Dole,
Smith and Schaupp ready to tower
above them. They took scrums when
ever the choice was up to them.
The Cardinal playing was at par
throughout the game. The entire
team showed a splendid ability in
passing and dribbling. The backs
took a hand in dribbling, and the for
wards furnished plenty of excitement
with passing rushes when not rolling
the ball over the ground. Of the nine
tries made, six were tallied by for
wards: two each by Schaupp and
Gard; and one each by Dole and W.
Smith.
It was a game in which every Car
dinal player was a star. Gard, how
ever, was the most brilliant player of
the day. Several times he brought
the bleachers to (heir feet with his
sensational runs.
Brown was in splendid converting
form, scoring seven out of nine
chances, several of them from acute
angles. Harrigan opened up a couple
of additional speed notches and was
a strong unit at all times.
T. Sanborn gave good account of
himself as a wing.
Schaupp proved himself a sturdy
forward and is steadily advancing in
the rugby limelight.
Score in Five Minutes.
The first score was made in five
minutes, previous to which Nevada
had saved twice. King secured in the
ruck at Nevada's 25 and ran to a scrum
at 5. The scrum shot the ball across

Dole secured at 25, and crossed for
a tally, when Nevada was sleeping
secure in the belief that the ball was
out of bounds. Brown converted.
Stanford 10, Nevada 0.
The scoring of the first half was
ended when Schaupp went over from
a scrum at 5 and Brown again added
two.
