There was once an old codger in
Rome whose name was Cato the
Censor. • 1-Ie had a habit
There's- a of ending all his
Hflral Here, speeches in the Roman
-Senate in this fashion:
"CaVtlmgo -est delendum." That sounds,
to the average student more like
"lending" than "Carthage must be
destroyed." Hut Cato continued his
custom year in and year out; and
after a while the people grew tired
of hearing him say the same thing,
even* at the end of his best speeches,
so they all joined together and des
troyed Old Carthage—and, moreover.
We Need the Union.
