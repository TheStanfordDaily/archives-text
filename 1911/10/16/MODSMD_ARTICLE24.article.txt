# SECOND COCCER TEAM TO PLAY WEEKLY GAMES.
## Combination Eleven Form Bay Counties League Will Meet Stanford in Practice contests. 
### 
Beginning next Saturday the sec
ond soccer squad will be given an op
portunity to play regular weekly
games that the first team plays,
games on the same days . that
the first team plays. Through the
| efforts of Professor R. R. Long
and Instructor H. W. Malowey
of the Gymnasium division, a team
I picked from the. best players in the
bay counties soccer league will con
: test with the second e-leveu regularly.
The idea of a,combination team was
suggested in order to insure a high
class article of ball. This is n<ot ob
tainable by meeting the regular teams
lof the smaller league, composed of
i four clubs devoted to the promotion
of the English game. The contests
will be held on the home grounds of
the bay cities teams. By affording
the players of the both Stanford and
1 the Bay Counties league the chance
to compete in a series of matches as
have been planned the brand of soccer
played on the Pacific coast will be
greatly fwproved.
