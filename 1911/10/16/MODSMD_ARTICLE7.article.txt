'14, representing Chi Psi and Beta
Theta Pi, respectively, will play for
the championship. ♦ k
Previous to Saturday's competition
the tournament had narrowed down
from the original thirty-two entries
to seven players. Of these matches
those between Phi Delta Theta and
Chi Psi, Morgan and Sheldon, and
Kappa Alpha and Beta Theta Pi, Mur
ray and Dawson, were the fastest.
The first match was especially in
teresting and exciting. Many times
the games were prolonged after they
had gone to deuce. Twenty games
were required to win the second set
of this contest. Both Morgan and
Sheldon played especially fine tennis
and will be among the highest con
testors for next semester's Varsity
tennis team. Score, 6-3 and 11-9.
The other semi-final match was won
by Dawson over Murray, 6-2, 6-2, al
though all but two games went to
deuce. Dawson's play was excellent
and probably of a higher grade than
has been seen at the University for
many years.
The doubles tournament is now
half completed. The championship
will be won by one of the following
remaining teams—Phi Delta Theta,
Sigma Chi, Phi Gamma Delta, Kappa
Alpha, Delta Chi, Encina, and Beta
Theta Pi.
Two players are left in the singles
of the Interelub tennis tournament.
