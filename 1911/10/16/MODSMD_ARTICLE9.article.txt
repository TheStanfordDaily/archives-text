### 
The part of Lawrence Worthing in
the English Club play, which was
unassigned at the recent announce
ment of the cast, has been given to

full of good possibilities and the new
player has shown himself capable of
making the most of these.
Rannells gave an excellent interpre
tation of the character of Alexander
Armstrong in last semester's Sopho
more play, "The Senator."
