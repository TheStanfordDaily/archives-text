# CANADIANS TO REACH CALIFORNIA TUESDAY
## WILL PLAY BLUE AND GOLD ON THE NEXT DAY. After Two Games At Berkeley the Northern Men Will Meet Stanford Here. 
### 
Invading American soil for the first
time as a single rugby team the com
bined Canadian squads of Vancouver
and Victoria will reach San Francisco
next Tuesday, according to a letter
received by Graduate Manager Bur
bank last night. In writing, A. B.
Scott, the secretary of the Northern
Rugby organization, did not state how
many men would be brought down
here, or how the division would be
made between Victoria and Vancouver.
This is the first time that the former
city players have come to this part of
the Coast to compete with Stanford
or California.
The big combined squad will play
California at Berkeley next Wednes
day afternoon in the first game of the
series, and on Saturday afternoon for
the final game. These matches should
attract more attention than any con
tests of an international nature in
past years.
Afer the Canadians have tried con
clusions with the Blue and Gold they
will meet Stanford on Stanford Field
on Wednesday, November 1, and on
Saturday, November 4. Rugby interest
will then be transferred to the Stan
ford Farm. The match will be the
last contest before the Big Game, and
will serve to test the Cardinal Varsity
to its utmost.
Following is a list of the northern
players who will make the trip to
California:
Fullback Locke: This player is a
steady and reliable man, though lack
in- brilliance of Brown of Stanford or
Dwiggins of California.
Johnson another fullback who
will make the trip. He lacks the
reliability of Locke, but has that man's
missing quality, namely, occasional
brilliance.
Three-quarters line: Nanson, Vin
cent. Ross, Deane and McGuigan.
These are all good men. Ross is the
most spectacular, but not steady, while
Deane fast but inexperienced. Mc-
Guigan is fast, tall and heavy, a rare
combination of rugby virtues, and
when in form is a tower Â«of strength
tr> the team.
Halves: Newcombe, Watkins and
Luke: Newcombe is the only man ot
the team who has ever played on Cali
fornia soil. Me is a gcod all-round
player, particularly strong on defence.
Watkins and Luke :u-e also valuable
men. tbe former having the faculty
of presenting either shoe to the ball
with results disastrous to his oppon
ents.
Of Hie forward list, the first nine
fire from Victoria and the remainder
from Vancouver. It includes the fol
lowing. Sweeny, Jeffs. Miller, Helncke.
Gillespie, Brown, St raker, Axkland,
Simpson, Gray, McLellan, Durant,
Holy rood. Smith and McDermid.
Sweeny was formerly seen in action
with the Olympic Club. This combina
tion of forwards is a formidable one,
and is likely to give the Cardinal
more cause for alarm than the back
field.
