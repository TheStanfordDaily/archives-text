# FRESHMEN MAKE LAST APPEARANCE TOMORROW
## BERKELEY HIGH WILL BE THEIR OPPONENTS. 1915's Premier Rugby Players Will Close Their Successful Season With Fast Game. 
### 
For their last game of the season
the Cardinal Freshmen will play the
Berkeley High School on Stanford
Field tomorrow afternoon at 4:45.
This game will be a hardly contested
one, since the Stanford plavers have
played a consistent season of rugby
that puts them into the first water of
first year players. On the other hand
the Berkeley men have been just as
successful in their program and will
send into the field tomorrow a well
balanced rugby unit.
Freshmen Have Beaten Berkeley.
Te first game of the year for 1915
last September was with the Berkeley
High fifteen. The Freshmen developed
a case of stage fright in the opening
minutes of this set-to, and were nearly
rushed off their feet before they were
able to recover and hurl back the
swift onset of the visitors. The Car
dinal babies just managed to get away
with the laurels by one unconverted
try to a blank for the trans-bay ath
letes. 3-0. Tomorrow's game should
show just how much the Freshmen
have been able to learn since the first
game. Tt should also be a means of
measuring the ability of preparatory
schools in contests with University
Freshmen in the condition in which
they now are at the end of the sched
ule, and at a time when Stanford and
California usually meet.
Ten matches have been played by
the first year team, two of these were
ties and both were with the speedy
players from the Mission College at
Santa Clara in two fast contests that
were the sensation of l!)15's season.
Two defeats were administered to the
Stanford Freshmen, in succession,
when they played four games in eight
days, Palo Alto and Fremont High
Schools being their opponents on these
two losing days.
Tn this last game for the Freshmen
the only thing at stake is to end their
season with a victory to round out
their schedule. Tn former years the
last game was an intercollegiate af
fair. on which depended the winning
of their numerals under the trying
circumstances of one afternoon's
showing. Now a whole season's
showing is the basis of the winning
of their numerals, making a more
easy-going tryout.
Prep School Wanted Game.
The Schedule as first made includ
ed only one game with the Berkeley
players. Upon their request, however,
after the first game, another was given
them by extending the schedule over
to an additional Wednesday match.
Berkeley has a well-balanced and
all around team. Austin, their first
five, is accredited by the sporting
writers on the San Francisco papers
as being one of the best players of the
English brand of football in the sec
ondary schools surrounding the bay.
Tn the first game here he gave an
excellent account of himself as the
leader of the backline. S. Forbes, at
full on the visitors aggregation, is a
strong defender with a ready boot to
drive the pigskin back to a safe line
