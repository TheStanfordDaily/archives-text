# Something Wrong Here.

On the one hand is the communica
tion published today asserting that the
Freshmen are lacking in spirit, and on

the other is the specta
cle of the first-year men
making a beginning on
their bonfire a month

before the Big Game, in the hope of
establishing a record. There is no
doubt as to the reality of the bonfire,
for there is the proof before our eyes
on the gymnasium field. Spirit to be
praised and carefully preserved is
surely overflowing there.
But that there is truth in the Fresh
man attitude on the bleachers is also
evident we are sorry to say. It may
be that they do not understand what
is required of them. That, however,
is impossible to believe, after the open
ing Assembly and the many warnings
written on the subject. There will
surely lie no excuse hereafter, at
least.
