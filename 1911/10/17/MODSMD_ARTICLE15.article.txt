Editor, Daily Palo Alto:
I have attended most of the games
this fall, and I think 1 have discovered
the reason for the remarkable lack of
response when we are called upon
for a bleacher x.ong. I have observed
that the upperclassmen, and to a some
what lesser extent, the sophomores,
respond with spirit: but in my four
years' experience here I have never
seen such a pronounced lack of "pep"
on the part of the freshmen as the
191." men show in this regard. Since
the freshmen comp.ose a good share
of the rooting section, this indifference
on their part is felt keenly. I wish to
suggest that, the upperclassmen in the
rooting section put the freshmen
right in the matter, and, in case they
do not learn the songs and sins; them,
help them to a teal in the adjoining
section.
HOLD OVER.
