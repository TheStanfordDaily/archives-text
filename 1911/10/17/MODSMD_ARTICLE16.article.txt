# Sequoia Sells Out October Issue.
## 
### 
Hecause of the large demand for
the October issuo of the Sequoia, in
â€¢which the Stanford Union and thr
Women's clubhouse were features,
the late number of the campus peri
odical has been entirely sold out.
Considerable call has been made for
the iffJigazine but owing to the fact
that the forms have been destroyed
by the printers 110 additional copies
will be obtainable.
