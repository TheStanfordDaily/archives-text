# ROOSEVELT WHITES ON STANFORD ARCHITECTURE.
## Says It Is Refreshing to See Scholarship In Attractive Surroundings and Housing. 
### 
Theodore Roosevelt in an article
entitled, "The People of the Pacific
Coast," in a recent number of "The
Outlook" speaks of the beauty of cer
tain Universities. He says in refer
ence to Stanford and California:
"In Leland Stanford (and the Uni
versity or California, aside from the
older buildings) one of the refreshing
things was to see scholarship in an
attractive housing, in attractive sur
roundings. The average Eastern uni
versity, even Harvard or Yale, for in
stance, has none of the beauty which
gives st> peculiar a charm to Oxford
and Cambridge. Here and there in
Eastern universities this beauty is de
veloping, but it is only developing.
In Leland Stanford, however, a really
great architect—Richardson—was al
lowed to develop a distinctive native
type of architecture, the old Spanish-
American type; not to copy it merely,
but to adapt it to the needs of an
American university. The result is
a beauty wholly distinct from and un
like the beauty of Old World universi
ties, but a beauty quite as great in its
own way—which makes the ideal to
ward which we should strive.
In the University of California, the
old buildings, as I have said, are not
attractive, but the new ones are at
tractive, and the open-air theatre 1?
something, the like of which could
hardly be elsewhere found in any oth
er university. Of course such a thea
tre is possible for wide and contin
uous use only in a climate like that of
California. At the University there
are now plenty of students who repre
sent the third generation of Califor
nian life, students who represent a
life that has now gotten its roots down
into the soil, and from them we have
a right to expect much creative work
of permanent value along many dif
ferent lines."
