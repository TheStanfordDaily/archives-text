Although a report was circulated
last week to the effect that regular
Varsity training rules had gone into
effect, the rumor was not founded on
fact. Coach Schaeffer advised Cap
tain Elliott Saturday night that the
men would begin strict training Mon
day.

With the freshman contest over,
the hardest work for the coaches still
remains: to prepare a team for the
intercollegiate game in less than four
weeks. With the aid of Cerf, who
has been signed as an assistant
coach, Schaeffer will put the Varsity
through strenuous practice each night.

The Executive Committee for the
A. S. U. C. has accepted the offer of
the Beta Theta Pi house for the use
of the football squad for the training
table. The house will be handed over
to the use of the rugby men about
the end of the week.

Coach Schaeffer has permitted
eleven of the freshman team to re
main out for Varsity practice. The
entire scrum will work with the
regulars, while only three of the
back-field are given this privilege.
The trio from the backs are Canfield,
half-back, Pogardus, freshman captain
and full-back, and Driver, five-eighths.
The rest of the freshmen are: Miller,
Crane, Newell, McKim, Chapman, Hos
kins, Hunt, Holden. They reported
with the Varsity yesterday.

Owing to the fact that the number
of entries for the third annual Peace

The winners in the tryout will
compete for a $no prize in Hearst
Hall, Saturday, October 21, at 8 p.m.

form a team to meet a similar team
from Stanford. A prize of .$lOO will
be awarder to the best speaker in the
intercollegiate contest.

Although showing a great improve
ment over their playing in previous

Through a mistake of the railroad
employees, the tickets for the Califor
nia-Stanford football game were sent
to El Paso, Texas, instead of to
Berkeley, and as a result of this.
Graduate Manager Farmer announces
that the distribution of tickets, which
was to have begun today, will be
delayed until the latter part of this
week.
