# RICHNESS OF EASTERN HAREM WILL BE SEEN FRIDAY NIGHT
## 
### 
Friday night's presentation of
"Fatinitza" promises to equal any
thing ever before attempted by the
Schubert Club.
Both in scenic effects and rich cos
tuming "Fatinitza" will long be re
membered. The richness of the East
ern Harem and the very atmosphere
of a Russian military camp are
brought out to an extent seldom seen
in amateur productions.
In costuming this Oriental Opera
vies with the"The Uvernian Princess"
which has generally been accepted as
the best costumed production attempt
ed at Stanford.
As to the cast, one need only to read
over the names to be assured of a fine
performance. Fatinitza is portrayed

by Miss A. Maloney, '14, who is well
known to the University world. It
was her excellent work that had much
to do with the success of the last
Junior Opera.
H. B. Maguire, '13, in the part of
Julian Hardy, is again proving his
ability, and all remember his ex
cellent work in the "Mikado."
Miss N. Beach, '13, H. Broomell, '13,
E. E. Manning, '13, B. Sanford, '13,
L. Lewis, '14, and other members of
the cast are daily showing their
ability to carry their parts.
The seat sale began yesterday morn
ing and promises a full house. As is
always the case there are a few good
seats left but the number is excep
tionally small.
