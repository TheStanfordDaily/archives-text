# VARSITY LEAVES FOR THE SOUTH TOMORROW
## TWENTY MEN ARE CHOSEN BY COACH PRESLEY. Full Cardinal Strength Will Be On Bovard Field For Game, Saturday Afternoon. 
### 
Coach Presley has chosen twenty
men to make the trip to Los Angeles
for the game with the University of
Southern California, next Saturday
afternoon, at 2:30 o'clock, on Bovard
Field. The Cardinal squad leaves on
the Sunset Express tomorrow after
noon from Palo Alto, the limited train
being stopped for them.
The squad includes every veteran
who has been on the injured list this
fall, and the full strength of the Var
sity will be on hand to meet the
Southerners. Five substitutes are
taken, two for the pack, one for half,
and two for the remainder of the
backfield.
Twenty Good Men and True.
The forward division is represented
by Card, A. Sanborn, VV. L. Smith,
Partridge, Frank, Schaup, Watkins,
Woodcock, Corbett, and Boulware.
For the halfback position Cass and
Worswick are being taken. Harrigan,
Risling and Reeves appear for first
five, and there will likely develop a
quantity of the fastest kind of competi
tion for those two places among the
three men; center three is filled by
Captain Erb, alone, and he can take
care of it; wings are provided for by
T. Sanborn, Kern, and Geissler;
Brown is depended upon alonp to look
out for the fullback's duty.
Besides these men and Coach G. J.
Presley, Graduate Manager Burbank
and Trainer "Dad " Moulton are to
accompany the men to see that every
thing goes well in the managing and
conditioning, respectively.
Opposing Varsity Weaken.
The IT. S. C. Varsity that the Car
dinal will meet is the samp that played
at Berkeley last Saturday, with the
exception of a man or two in the back
field who is out of the running with
injuries. It is difficult to say how
large a score the Stanford fifteen will
roll up if allowed to run loose, since
the California Freshmen defeated the
southern varsity by 14-0, and, of
course, there is no comparison be
tween the Varsity and Freshman
teams.
Manager Burbank has secured ac
commodations for them during their
stay in Los Angeles at the Hollenbeck
Hotel. They will attend the Orpheum
theatre on Friday evening, and will,
leave for home Saturday night after
the game at 6:15 on the northbound
Sunset, arriving here at 10: 4rÂ» Sunday
morning.
It is possible that some sort of
welcome will he made by the alumni
of the Angel City to the Cardinal
team, but no word of it has been re
ceived here. ft is known, however,
that the Stanford graduates have been
boosting the contest unceasingly in
Los Angeles newspapers, and that a
large crowd is expected to be present.
Two Dozen Players Out For Practice.
Batting practice was given the base
ball men yesterday afternoon in the
place of the usual practice game gen
erally held on Tuesday afternoons.
The warm weather seemed to have a
strenuous effect on the candidates, as
only two dozen men appeared for
work.
.1. T). Peters, who is helping to get
the Freshmen players into shape, was
on deck to steer the new men along
the right batting lines. The 1915 can
didates are showine up to good ad
vantage under the tutelage of the
national game veteran.
