# Frenchman's Lake.

### 
Here Is welcome news. French
man's Lake. lons thought destined to
be wiped out of existence after a few

years of service as a
"dumping ground" for
earthquake rubbish, is
to be brought back

into a part ot' its former picturesque
beauty. We are glad, and give our
thanks once more for giving back
this small souvenir of the erratiq
Frenchman. It is more than probable
that this was the purpose of the Uni
versity authorities all along, and that
many editorials, communications and
articles on the subject were all for
naught. But no matter what was the
intention in regard to the Lake, all
its many admirers may now rest con
tent with knowing that within a year
or so the row of poplars around its
edge will not be the only thing of
beauty in that vicinity.â€”We need the
Union.
