# VARSITY SQUAD EASES PRACTICE FOR WARM DAYS.
## First and Second Trains in Set-to on Auxiliary Field During Freshman Contest. 
### 
Lighter practice suitable for hot
weather took the place of the usual
scrimmage between the Grays and
Blacks on Stanford Field, yesterday
afternoon. Tackling the bag and
work on other special points of the
game occupied the men.
Probably the only scrummage of
the week, outside of Saturday's game,
was fought between the two Varsity
teams this afternoon on the outside
field at the same time that the Fresh
men were contending with Berkeley
High.
Practically all of the injured players
are once more with the team, while
a few are out in togs but only indulge
in light passing and dribbling prac
tice. Bayly is the latest addition to
this squad, an injured leg entitling
him to admission.
Coach Presley has not as yet posted
a rubbing list, but a number of the
players are receiving this attention
each afternoon. These men are chief
ly the first Freshmen fifteen and the
members of the "Gray" squad.
