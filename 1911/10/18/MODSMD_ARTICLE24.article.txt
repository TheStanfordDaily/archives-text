# Second Encina Comes Next Saturday.
## 
### 
Next Saturday evening, the second
Encina of the semester will be given
in the Club room of the Hall. While
training rules will prevent members
of the football squad from attending,
an unusual number of outsiders have
been invited. The committees are
planning to make this second dance
as successful as the first Encina, and
have been working hard on the details
for the evening.
