# BEAUTY OF FRENCHMAN LAKE TO BE RETAINED
## SHOW SPOT WILL NOT BE USED AS DUMP. Bottom is to be Filled and Lake Made Sanitary.â€”Mosquitoes too Numerous. 
### 
Announcement comes today from the
Business Office, that Frenchman's
Lake, one of the beauty spots of the
campus, will not be used in future
as a dump, and that the natural
scenic beauties of the place will be
preserved. This was decided on when
it was discovered that the soggy
ground at the bottom" of the lake, and
the stagnant water which collected
there during the rainy season formed
the chief breeding place for mosqui
toes in the vicinity of the campus
proper. It was deemed advisable, be
cause of the dangers arising from
mosquitoes, to alleviate this condi
] tion, if possible.
It is planned to continue the dump
i ing of cans and solid refuse of that.
I kind into the lake bottom until suffl
j C'ent has been putin to cover the
I entire bottom of the lake to a height
lof a few feet. Qu top of these cans,
and using them as a foundation, dirt
i will be dumped, which will form a
j hard bottom for the lake. At the level
j of this dirt, or slightly below it, in
order to give proper drainage, an
! outlet will he constructed.
| Stagnant Water Removed.
By this plan there will never he
any stagnant water in the lake, and
when the rainy season is over the dirt
bottom will dry out rapidly enough to
prevent mosquitoes from breeding.
These plans will in no way inter
fere with the natural scenic beauties
of the place. They will overcome the
j present unsightly array of cans, scrap
| iron and the like, and will act as a
I check to one of the most prolific mos
! Quito breeding grounds in the neigh
' borhood of Stanford. The lake itself
j will not be injured and its original
i appearance will only be changed in so
far as it will be slightly shallower.
Work on the building of the outlet
will be rushed at once and the entire
work will probably be finished before
the beginning of the rainy season
proper.

Ten Freshmen lmve been ad
ded to the Vnrslty riiirby squad,
now that the baby season Is
over. These men will continue
under the direction of Coach
Presley, while the remainder
of the Freshmen will irivc tip
their footlmll work for this
year.
