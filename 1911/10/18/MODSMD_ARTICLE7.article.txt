## Berkeley High Team Showed Game Spirit of Fight But Could Not Stem Onrush of the Cardinal. 
### 
Final Score, 1915, ]S; Berkeley, 0.
The curtain went down on the 1915
rugby team this afternoon when the
Freshmen ended their schedule with
the game with Berkeley high school
fifteen.
Austin, Berkeley's premier first five
and their consistent performing star,
is not included in their lineup. Ac
cording to the San Francisco writers
he is one of the best fives on the Coast
today. His loss to the visitors leaves
Listless Playing.
The Frosh started off with listless
playing and were pushed by Berkeley
for five minutes though not danger
ously. The Cardinal backs failed to
make the most of the passing rushes.
They constantly sent the passes amiss.
After five minutes 1915 began to
get into a better stride, although at
least two tries were thrown away.
Berkeley was further crippled by
the loss of her two best wings Clopton
and S. Forbes, in addition to Austin.
The Freshmen were able to take ad
vantage of this weakness in the sec
ond half but during the first period
Berkeley did not show her loss.
Second Half Ten Minutes.
But ten minutes were given to the
second period but the Freshmen by
that time had gotten into their sride

over the line. Some of the most spec
tacular rugby that 1915 has shown
this year was made a part of these
tries.
Templeton, Haley, Erb, Sims, and
Clark were the stars for the Cardinal.
Haley used his boot to perhaps bet
ter advantage than ever. Wynne also
deserves credit for several neat com
binations that he used.
While the Freshmen did not show
their best form in the first period
the brace that they took in the sec

ond closed their season with credit,
not only to the men who made the
first Freshman team, but those who
contributed the competition necessary
to create so strong a group.

The curtain went down on the 1915
rugby team this afternoon when the
Freshmen ended their schedule with
the game with Berkeley high school
fifteen.
Austin, Berkeley's premier first five
and their consistent performing star,

After five minutes 1915 began to
get into a better stride, although at
least two tries were thrown away.
Berkeley was further crippled by

Berkeley did not show her loss.

this year was made a part of these
tries.
Templeton, Haley, Erb, Sims, and
Clark were the stars for the Cardinal.
Haley used his boot to perhaps bet
ter advantage than ever. Wynne also
deserves credit for several neat com
binations that he used.
While the Freshmen did not show

not only to the men who made the
first Freshman team, but those who
contributed the competition necessary
to create so strong a group.
