# Game Ticket Sale Numbers Go Fast.

### 
All the numbers for the choice of
seats at the "Rip: Game" were down
before two o'clock to-day. The line
of men extended from the law build
ings out to the end of the Quad and
from there past the English building.
When the last of the five hundred
numbers had boen drawn there were
still students left in the line.
From two to three hundred women
were on hand to secure numbers near
the south entrance of the English
building.
