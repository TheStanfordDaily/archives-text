# FRESHMEN HAVE MADE CREDITABLE SHOWING
## RUGBY SEASON IS UNUSUAL ONE THIS YEAH. Twenty Numerals Have Been Given On Basis of Season's Work, An Innovation. 
### 
The Freshman season Is over, and
the rugby unit that played as the rep
resentatives of the class of 1915, has
passed out of existence. Their sched
ule is completed, and the rewarding
of numerals has been based on the
showing of a season and not on tha'
of one short afternoon. The block
"15" has been awarded to twenty men
who have worked faithfully during
the eleven games that comprised the
season. In former years, because of
the intercollegiate rule, eighteen men
only could win these letters, yet
competition has been just as strong
as in other seasons.
Eleven men have been chosen from
among these players to continue to
play rugby but under the direct tute
lage of Coach Presley, and as mem
bers of the Varsity squad. That their
practice and season's work has been
just as successful as last year's is
shown by the fact that eleven players
from the Freshmen team have been
kept over for the Varsity squad, while
last year but seven of the first-year
men were reserved for this group.
Better Average Tit is Year.
Ten games were played by the
Freshman team of a year ago and the
total scores give 1914 85 points to
their opponents 22, while the total
scores of the season just past gives
the Freshmen 104 to their opponents'
26, in a series of 11 games.
The best games that 1915 played
were with the Catholic Colleges of
St. Mary's and Santa Clara. The one
game with Oakland Collegians was
on October 11, the Freshmen winning
by the score of 3 to 0. The game was
a fast one with the tide of fortune
rapidly shifting and was perhaps the
closest of the non-tie games. The
forwards on each side played hard.
The Cardinals got through several
creditable passing rushes but were
checkmated by the speed of the visi
tors. The lone tally was made in a
fortunate moment in the second peri
od when the visitors got confident
enough to try a passing rush. Th's
went awry and was intercepted by
191." and u'ili'ced bv them for a score
through the ragged opening that St.
Mary's loft exposed.
Two Tip Contests.
The two games with the Missioners
from Santa Clara resulted in tie con
tests. The first was fought on Sen
tember 27, and was the second mil
week game of the Freshmen. The
babies started off the afternoon's pro
ceeding with a rush and had nearlv
sent a try across the line before the
visitors were able to stem their on
set. Then Santa Clara began to re
verse the argument and began to
push. Hurling passing rush after
passing rush against the Cardinal de
fenders they were at last able to
break through for an unconverted
try. In the second period the Fresh
men awoke and fought until thev
were awarded a free kick which Clark
utilised to goal the leather between
the uprights.
On last Saturday the Freshmen
again trior! conclusions with this
strong aggregation, in a game in
which neither side was able to put
the ball over their onponents' ha"k
line. This wai the severest tost tha 112
either of the c e strong rugby unit"
were put nn against this season and
speaks highly for the consistent plav
ing tint th» Cardinal novices strnwe 1
in this their last hard battle of
six weeks schedule. Tt was flgh f
clear through from whistle to gun and
no let tip.

Only One Slump.
Only once did the Freshmen slump
during their season and that was
when an extra game was pressed into
their already full schedule. At that
time they were sent out to play with
Fremont High on a Monday after
noon after a hard game on the pre
ceeding Saturday and another on the
coming Wednesday. So they lost that
Monday game as well as the mid-week
one.
1 alo Alto High School sent a for
mi '.able team against the Freshmen
three times and captured one of the
trio of games. Their earnest working
during every minute of the°e games
speaks highly of the rugby spirit that
Stanford has taug't them.
It was net entirely due to the twen
tv men who were chosen by the
! conches to receiva their block "15"
t'lat so successful a team was craat° 1.
A great measure of credit is due to
the men who did not win their m
rrerals but furnished the competition
tVt is neces~ary to build a strong
tea" v > of any kind.
