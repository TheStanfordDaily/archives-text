The Daily Palo Alto announces to
day, with pleasure, the election of
new members to the staff, as follows:
Stanley Stoddard Simon-
Staff son '15, of Merced; Sam
Elections. Miller Hawkins *15, of
Watsonville; Frederick C.
Hamilton *15, of Cranford, New Jersey,
Martin Whitney Allen '15, of Spokane,
Washington; Arthur William Wynn-3
'15, of San Anselmo, and Hamilton B.
Rollins, Jr., '15, of Los Angeles.
The six men have shown their
ability during a seven weeks tryout
and the choice was based on that
work. Three considerations deter
mined the election; ability to write,
to "cover" the news, and to work.
The new members have done their
work faithfully and thoroughly.
The Daily Palo Alto is also glad to
announce the election of Miss C. S.
Smith, '14, of La Crescenta, who has
carried out her duties unusually well
during the try-out.â€”We need the Un
ion.
