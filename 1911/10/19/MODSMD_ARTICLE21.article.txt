Freshmen Get Numerals.
Contrary to the motion passed at
the meeting of the Executive Commit
tee for October 21, twenty men in
stead of eighteen were granted their
block letters for participating in a
majority of games for the season of
the Freshman schedule. These twenty
men have shown Cieir ability in the
game at all times, and in the opinion
of the coaches justly deserve the re
ward of numerals. An interesting
fact is noticed in regard to the grant
ing of these letters. Hirawasa. who
played with the forwards in the ma
jority of the games throughout the
year, is the first Japanese to receive
athletic recognition at Stanford in the
way of numeral or letter.
Austriilian Boys to Visit.
At the present time there are about
forty boys from Australia in this coun
try on a protracted vi?it of three
months. These boys have been meet
ing various teams in their class in
athletic lines and have been enter
tained in San Francisco and other
points around the Bay. At present
they are in San Jose. The Executive
Committee plans to extend them an
invitation to visit the campus on Octo
ber 28, the date of the last appearance
of the Varsity against the strong
Olympic team. If the invitation is
accepted the boys will come up from
San Jose in a special car to the cam
pus. On their arrival they will be
allotted to the various fraternitv
houses on the Row. A committee will
be appointed to show them around
the campus and they will be the
guests of the Student Body at the
game in the afternoon. They will re
turn to San Jose that evening.
T'Â» Keep Hooters Off Turf. ..
Because of the danger of injury to
the turf, a ruling was made that pre
paratory school rooters, who attend
gimes between their rival teams on
Stanford Field. Saturday mornings
and other days, should keep off the
field after the game is over. Tt has
been the custom to assemble on the
field at the conclusion of the match
to celebrate victory. This custom,
however, does more harm to the turf
than a hard-fought game. Stanford
Field is to be kept in as good condi
tion as possible for the Big Game.
