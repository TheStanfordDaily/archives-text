Last year the custom of having Sun
day concerts in tlie Inner Quad was
started, but as objections were raised
by the Trustees the plan was discon
t'nued. This year , however, the band
men were again in favor of having the
concerts, but it was proposed to give
them outside of the Quad. The large
cement area in front of where the
Memorial Arch one stood was selected
as the most advantageous place.
'' here 's nlenty of room for the entire
band while th° audience may sit on
the lawns on either side.
If the concert meets with approval
the plan will be continued In the fu
ture on every other Sunday.
