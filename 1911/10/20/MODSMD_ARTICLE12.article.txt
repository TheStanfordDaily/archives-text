# Staff Change
## 
### 
Tonight the Daily Palo Alto an
nounces a change in the make-up ol
the editorial staff, occasioned by the

growth in the paper from
four to five columns. Five
men have been chosen from
among the Associates and

Assistants to act as News Editors for
the five publication days in the week.
The position of News Editor has here
tofore been a mere title, simply show
ing the member who hail reached the
third place on the staff. The duties
of the editor have continually increas
ed. with the result that the broader
view of the university happenings has
been buried in a mass of routine work
each day. About one-half of this task
is now taken over by the News Edi
tors. They will be responsible for
the day's news.
We take pleasure" in advancing the
following five men: From the Asso
ciates, Irving I. Ingraham, of Bristol;
Paul Eliel, of Pasadena; and Henry
Lawrence Loud, of Pomona; and from
the Assistants, Otis Henry Castle, of
Pasadena and Earl Charles Behrens,
of Redding.
