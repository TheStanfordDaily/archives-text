"The college girl has been vindi
cated—if she really needed vindica
tion. Statistics have been compiled
which show that the percentage of
divorce among college girl graduates
is one out or fifty-seven, while in
ordinary feminine circles it runs at
one to ten or twelve
"Which means that girls at college
have learned how to keep a husband,
a very rare and uncertain thing in
these days when divorce can be ob
tained with so little sacrifice of time
money and social standing.
"And it would appear that it is
much better to putin a few years at
college learning how to keep a hus
band than to be floating about in
society prematurely trying to get
one."—San Francisco Examiner.
"Now that the football season is
here the question arises a3 to whether
the cheers of women at a game are
a hindrance or a help to the team
they are trying to encourage.
"Miss Ida Comstock, dean of women
at the University of Minesota, charac
terizes the yells of women as the
"moanings of a sleeper in the throes
of a nightmare."
"The captain of the university elev
en disagrees. 'I like to hear girls
cheering,' he says. 'I can distinguish
the cheers of the co-eds and I find
them inspiriting.'
"If the co-eds were organized and
worked with the men the combined
result ought to produce something
unique in the cheering line, but until
they do the girls who wish to pro
duce a real effect will accomplish it
best by waving flags and looking
pretty."San Francisco Examiner.
