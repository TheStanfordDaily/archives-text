# ANGEL PLAYERS MEET VARSITY TOMORROW
## BOVARD FIELD TO BE SCENE OF BATTLE. Game Should Be Easy For the Stanford Fifteen In Its Full Strength. 
### 
At the Bovard Field in the South
land Metropolis tomorrow afternoon at
2:30 o'clock the Cardinal Varsity will
meet the rugby representatives of the
University of Southern California.
The game is being well advertised by
the Stanford Alumni in Los Angeles
and a record breaking crowd is ex
pected to be in attendance.
This is the only away-from -campus
game for the hard working Varsity
squad men and will serve as a needed
recreation from the six-days-a-week
grind on the Stanford turf. It is about
this time in the schedule that the
Varsity begins to feel the hard work.
A shaking up on the Pullman sleep
ers, a new field, and a game before
an audience not so enthusiastically
supporting them will serve to awaken
new interest in the game for them.
Easy Game Expected.
The Angel City players are not a
formidable group and should prove
the easiest of the contenders that the
Cardinals have had to meet this sea
son. The Blue and Gold freshmen de
feated this same aggregation last Sat
urday on California Field by the score
of 15 to 0. As there are no standards
to compare the playing of a varsity
and freshman team, however, it should
make an interesting problem in guess
work as to just how large a score the
Stanford premier aggregation should
be able to record against the south
erners on their home field and backed
by their rooters.
Twenty men besides Coach Presley,
Graduate Manager Burbank and "Dad"'
Moulton are now in Los Angeles, ar
riving on the Sunset Express this
morning. The headquarters of the
Stanford rugby delegation will be at
the Hollenbeck, which is managed by
"Mow" Mitchell, captain of the 1909
Varsity. The visitors are sure to re
ceive the best that the house affords.
Tonight the team will attend the per
formance at the Orpheum. The re
turn trip will be started on Saturday
night at 6:15 on the northern bound
Sunset, reaching Palo Alto on Sunday
morning at 10:45.
