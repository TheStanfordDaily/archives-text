# SECOND TEAM WILL PLAY OFF CAMPUS TO-MORROW.
## Strong Fifteen of Near-Varsity Men Are Selected For the Mission Game. 
### 
By far the strongest second team
that has been sent into action this
year will try conclusions with Santa
Clara College at the Mission town to
morrow afternoon. The team has
been reinforced by the addition of a
number of Freshman stars and Var
sity substitutes who did not make the
southward journey and should be able
to keep the striped sweater men on
their toes.
The line-up will be as follows: Hall,
Bly, Skinner, Hubbard, Whitaker, Dar
sie, Haley, Wilson, forwards; Tilton,
half; King, Noble, fives; Sim, center;
11. J. Smith, Templeton, wings; Kauff
man, full. A. E. Roth '09, will be in
charge of the team.
Cardinal mettle will be well tested
by the Catholic aggregation. No bet
ter recommendation can be given the
Santa Clara team than to say that it
twice held one of the fastest Stanford
Freshman rugby units to a tie score.
3-3 and 0-0 were the tallies in the two
baby games. The Mission school has
a fast and experienced rugby combina
tion, strong on defense and particular
ly heavy in the pack.
Their line-up on paper presents a
peculiar appearance, as it includes
two halves and four three-quarters.
It will be as follows:
Gauahl, Barry, Quill, TTogan, Hatch,
Batten, Gilman, Tramatola, forwards:
Yberrando, Oalagher, halves; Best,
Stewart. Munson, Curry, three-quart
ers; Detels, full.
