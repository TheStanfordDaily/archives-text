# UNION COLLECTIONS TO DATE ARE ANNOUNCED
## JUNIORS AND FRESHMEN LEAD IN CASH. Sophomores Have to Their Credit Only One Sixth of Amount Paid by 1915. 
### 
W. R. Chandler '13, assistant to
A. W. Ambrose '13, who is in charge
of the collection of funds for the Stan
ford Union, reports today that a total
of $425 has been raised toward the
Union so far this year in actual cash.
Although this sum is not so large as
those in charge hoped to be able to
announce as collected at this time,
they consider tbat the results are fair
ly gratifying.
Of this sum so far collected the
Juniors have contributed the largeest
amount, with the Freshmen closely
pressing them for first honors. The
Holdovers have the next largest
amount to their credit. They lead the
class of 1912 by $10. The lowest
amount collected is from the Sopho
more class and the results show that
but five members of 1914 have paid
anything towards the Union.
Sophomores Indifferent.
t "The apparent lack of interest on
the part of the Sophomores," said a
member of the Union Committee, to
day, "is unaccountable. Although' the
other classes are not paying' up as
rapidly as we would desire we are
nevertheless fairly pleased with the
results. It is the members of the
class of 1914 who are lax in their pay
ments and show but slight interest
in the Union. This is difficult to un
derstand, as it will be the present
underclassmen who will be benefitted
by the Union. Rapid payments mean
a Union in the near future. The
Freshmen realize this but the Sopho
mores are indifferent, apparently."
Payments by classes to date are as
follows:
Holdovers $ 75
1912 65
1913 130
1914 25
1915 125
Total $425
That something will he done in the
near future to arouse more interest
in the Union now seems probable.
Just what the nature of this cam
paign will be is unknown but it is
certain that something will be done.
A particular effort will be made to
arouse enthusiasm among the tardy
second-year men.
