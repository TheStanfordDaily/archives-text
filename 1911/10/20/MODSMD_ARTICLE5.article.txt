Cardinals Improving.
The Cardinal players have been
making rapid advancement since their
first game. Twice the Stanford eleven
has met defeat. The first defeat was
plainly the result of a lack of prac

San Fianciscans the Stanford team
deserved a tie score. Tomorrow prac

sent the Cardinal as have appeared in
the previous contests. Captain J. L.
Reynolds will be in command of the
Stanford fighters.
This will be the only soccer game
which will be played on the campus
until after the rugby season. The
game is called for 3:45 on Encina
gymnasium field. No admission will
be charged.
