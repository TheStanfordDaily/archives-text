# STANFORD PROFESSOR SOLVES GREAT PROBLEM
## S.W. YOUNG DISCOVERY TO END SHELTER NUISANCE. Method known as Thiogen Process Will Save State Millions of Dollars Annually. 
### 
Professor S. VV, Young 4 / of the Chem
istry' department, has discovered a
chemical method whereby millions of
dollars will he saved annudlly to the
State of California in vegetation and
livestock; a valuable by-product will
be created out of the poisonous fumes
of ore smelters; and an industry saved
which has hitherto brought only des
truction to the surrounding country.
The discovery was made after four
months of work with the help of a
few assistants.
Professor Young calls his method
the thiogen process. Four months
ago he became interested in the prob
lem, due to the closing of the Oro
ville smelter because of the destruc
tion its fumes were causing. Of the
three deleterious substances contained
in the sulphur fumes, arsenic com
pounds, sulphur trioxide and sulphur
dioxide, the last has until now never
yielded to chemical treatment. In
form it is a true gas, differing from
the others which are found as solid
substances. Professor Young is now
working on the engineering problem
connected with treating this huge vo
lume of gas chemically without stop
ping up the flues of the smelter stacks.
He expects to announce complete suc
cess in a few weeks.
Describing his process Professor
Young stated:
"The reduction of the sulphur diox
ide to free sulphur or brimstone is ex
tremely simple. It may be accom
plished by means of a hydrocarbon,
such as crude petroleum. There is no
cheaper reducing agent. The gas
could be converted into sulphuric acid,
but for this there is a limited market.
The posibility of converting the sul
phur dioxide into free sulphur seems
to have received little attention. Sul
phur supplies for'many years to come
would be established, and the present
serious check to the smelting industry
would be overcome."
Profesosrs G. J. Peirce and R. S.
Swain, of the Botany and Chemistry
departments, respectively, are joined
with Profesosr Young in the discovery,
which is one of the most important in
its practical aspects that has ever
emanated from the University. It
will prove a boon to California, Mon
tana and other Western states where
in the gmelter industry is an impor
tant feature.
Financial and scientific aid in work
ing on the process was received from
three San Franciscans; J. T. Over
bury, H. G. McMahon and H. Sanborn.
Professor Young has received flatter
ing offers from some of the big smelt
ing interests during the last week. A
complete description of the process
appears in a recent number of the
"Mining and Scientific Press."
