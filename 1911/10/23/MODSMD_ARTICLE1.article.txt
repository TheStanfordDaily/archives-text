# OPERA IS DIFFICULT FOR COLLEGE CAST
## "FATINITZA‚Äù NEITHER SUCCESS NOR FAILURE. Miss Maloney's Voice Pleases.-Lewis, Manning and Maguire Are Successful In Playing. 
### PAUL ELIEL 
"Fatinitza" was neither a suc
cess nor a failure. Since failures
are more difficult to avert than medio
cre successes to attain, Saturday's
performance may be said to have
been close to a very mediocre suc
cess. Had it not been for the excel
lent work of a few members of the
cast and the unusual novelty of the
scenes presented, it would undoubted
ly be necessary to record a failure.
As it turned out, the poor portions
of the piece just about balanced the
good parts.
Opera Bad Selection.
The primary fault lay not so much
with the cast as with the opera itself.
"Fatinitza" was an unfortunate se
lection for a college opera in no mat
ter what light it is viewed. The mu
sic was difficult; the lines were aged
and time worn and lacked the spon
taneity and natural humor which one
looks for in light operas. In a word,
the piece, with the exception of an
occasional scene, was slow.
The music was undoubtedly good
but it had none of the lyric qualities
which make an air haunting. We hear
no tunes from "Fatinitza" whistled
around the Quad this morning as we
did after the "Mikado" or the "Uver
nian Princess." It is probable that
in the light of advanced musical com
position, it would stand up better un
der a test than either of these other
operas which we have mentioned, but
for a college audience it was im
measurably inferior to either.
It was apparent from the very open
ing either that more time had been
spent on the coaching of the music
than on the lines and business of the
actor, or else that Mr. Bartlett was
unable to properly coach an opera in
anything outside of the music. The
lafet proposition probably contains the
larger modicum of truth, as from past
experiences it is well known that his
forte lies in the coaching of the mu
sic.
Anachronisms Creep In.
Anachronisms managed to creep in
with surprising regularity throughout
the entire opera. We wondered in the
first act if Miss Beach might not be
a triffle chilly in her short sleeved
dress, when the poor soldiers only
managed to keep themselves warm by
violent stampings and calisthenics.
Hassan Bey was able to produce an
up-to-date Colt revolver to cover the
nonchalant newspaper correspondent,
when this cohorts carried ancient
flintlocks wonderful to behold and of
a pattern never before seen in the
Eastern or Western hemisphere.
In the last act the dress suits were
of a surprisingly modern cut. These
things, however, did not spoil the
parts in which they occurred.
Scenically the opera was one of the
best produced here. The first act was
realistic. The snow-balling scene was
almost chilly in its reality. The sec
ond act presented a scene of volup
tuous Oriental splendor such as would
do credit to any professional stage.
The little black twins waving the pea
cock feather fans over the reclining
beauties were a splendid touch. The
shadow play was tremendously inter
esting and novel. And the costuming
of the first two acts excellent.
A note of unconscious comedy crept
into one rather serious place when
Hardy produced from his over-loaded
grip a "bawl-out" and announced in
all seriousness that it was a tragedy
in one act. Perhaps he spoke mor'
wisely than he knew.

Acting honors for the evening un
doubtedly fall to L. W. Lewis, Jr. '14,
in the part of Tsset Pasha. His
work bore an unmistakable stamp
of originality from his first appearance
until his last. Whenever he entered
it was evident that the audience un
conciously said "Now, we shall see
something very worth while." His
dance steps as they properly should
have been were models of absurdity.
His gestures were well timed and
caused many a ripple of pleased
laughter. He assumed throughout ex
actly the proper attitude of broad en
