# OPERA IS DIFFICULT FOR COLLEGE CAST
## "FATINITZA” NEITHER SUCCESS NOR FAILURE. Miss Maloney's Voice Pleases.-Lewis, Manning and Maguire Are Successful In Playing. 
### PAUL ELIEL 
"Fatinitza" was neither a suc
cess nor a failure. Since failures
are more difficult to avert than medio
cre successes to attain, Saturday's
performance may be said to have
been close to a very mediocre suc
cess. Had it not been for the excel
lent work of a few members of the
cast and the unusual novelty of the
scenes presented, it would undoubted
ly be necessary to record a failure.
As it turned out, the poor portions
of the piece just about balanced the
good parts.
Opera Bad Selection.
The primary fault lay not so much
with the cast as with the opera itself.
"Fatinitza" was an unfortunate se
lection for a college opera in no mat
ter what light it is viewed. The mu
sic was difficult; the lines were aged
and time worn and lacked the spon
taneity and natural humor which one
looks for in light operas. In a word,
the piece, with the exception of an
occasional scene, was slow.
The music was undoubtedly good
but it had none of the lyric qualities
which make an air haunting. We hear
no tunes from "Fatinitza" whistled
around the Quad this morning as we
did after the "Mikado" or the "Uver
nian Princess." It is probable that
in the light of advanced musical com
position, it would stand up better un
der a test than either of these other
operas which we have mentioned, but
for a college audience it was im
measurably inferior to either.
It was apparent from the very open
ing either that more time had been
spent on the coaching of the music
than on the lines and business of the
actor, or else that Mr. Bartlett was
unable to properly coach an opera in
anything outside of the music. The
lafet proposition probably contains the
larger modicum of truth, as from past
experiences it is well known that his
forte lies in the coaching of the mu
sic.
Anachronisms Creep In.
Anachronisms managed to creep in
with surprising regularity throughout
the entire opera. We wondered in the
first act if Miss Beach might not be
a triffle chilly in her short sleeved
dress, when the poor soldiers only
managed to keep themselves warm by
violent stampings and calisthenics.
Hassan Bey was able to produce an
up-to-date Colt revolver to cover the
nonchalant newspaper correspondent,
when this cohorts carried ancient
flintlocks wonderful to behold and of
a pattern never before seen in the
Eastern or Western hemisphere.
In the last act the dress suits were
of a surprisingly modern cut. These
things, however, did not spoil the
parts in which they occurred.
Scenically the opera was one of the
best produced here. The first act was
realistic. The snow-balling scene was
almost chilly in its reality. The sec
ond act presented a scene of volup
tuous Oriental splendor such as would
do credit to any professional stage.
The little black twins waving the pea
cock feather fans over the reclining
beauties were a splendid touch. The
shadow play was tremendously inter
esting and novel. And the costuming
of the first two acts excellent.
A note of unconscious comedy crept
into one rather serious place when
Hardy produced from his over-loaded
grip a "bawl-out" and announced in
all seriousness that it was a tragedy
in one act. Perhaps he spoke mor'
wisely than he knew.

Acting honors for the evening un
doubtedly fall to L. W. Lewis, Jr. '14,
in the part of Tsset Pasha. His
work bore an unmistakable stamp
of originality from his first appearance
until his last. Whenever he entered
it was evident that the audience un
conciously said "Now, we shall see
something very worth while." His
dance steps as they properly should
have been were models of absurdity.
His gestures were well timed and
caused many a ripple of pleased
laughter. He assumed throughout ex
actly the proper attitude of broad en
nui that one would expect in an in
digent Eastern gentleman, bowed down
with the care of supporting four wives,
and maintaining them in neutral and
non-belligerent states of mind.
Second honors fall to E. E. Manning
'13, who played Steipann, and R. Ben
nett '15, as Mustapha. Manning made
a small part stand out as one of the
best in the entire opera. His work
throughout was consistent and good.
His accent was the best we have ever
heard at Stanford. The business which
he introduced into the part almost by
force, was nevertheless anything but
forced. He made the most of a small
opportunity. Bennett carried his
work through in much the same way.
His part was a thankless one at best,
and he was given but few lines. His
business carried him along splendid
ly, however, and he was never out
of the action for a moment.
Miss Moloney's Good Voice.
Among the women who played prin
cipal parts there seemed to be a gen
eral indifference as to the progress of
the Dlav. The chorus alone showed a

happy spontaneity—in those scenes
where spontaneity was possible. Miss
Maloney '14, again demonstrated be
yond any reasonable doubt that she
is the possessor of one of the best
voices that Stanford has ever heard
from a student. Her tones were rich,
full and pleasing, and all her solos
were well rendered. In the quar
tettes the volume of her tone may have
given her a slightly too great predomi
nance, but it was never unpleasant,
and not infrequently added just the
right touch of quality to these num
bers.
.Miss N. Beach '13, as the Princess
Lydia, had, we understand, an unfortu
nate cold on the evening of the per
formance. Her voice, even so, was
pleasing, although quite husky. The
cold seemed to chiefly effect the vol
ume of the voice and it was here that
it was most painfully felt. Sometimes,
it was difficult to hear it above the
orchestra. Miss Beach, had, however,
a pleasing and easy manner on the
stage and gave us an altogether satis
factory picture to carry away.
Mc(*uire Carries Part Well.
As the cool, nervy, and rescourceful
correspondent for an American news
paper, H. B. McGuire '13, carried off
the part of Julian Hardy well. Among
the men he undoubtedly had the best
voice. In the several solos that he
sang his voice was clear and pleasant
and his enunciation good. His best
work was when he described in song
the troubles of a correspondent at the
front. In the other numbers in which
he appeared his well-trained and
smooth tenor showed up to good ad
vantage. His acting was always easy
and well timed and his stage pres
cence, excellent.
H. F. Broomel M3, as the Russian
commander, General Kantchukoff, had
one of the most difficult parts of the
opera to play. It is a happy piece of
luck in a college production, partic
ularly in an opera, when a good sing
ing voice can be found joined to act
ing abilities in the same person.
Broomel pleased with his gruff voice,
exactly portraying the violent gen
eral, but in his acting scenes he fell
short. His make-up was splendid,
however, and was a redeeming fea
ture.
Others in minor parts played very
well. Tn fact the minor parts were

played quite as well as were those of
the principals, with but one or two
exceptions.
We hope, though, that in the future
the Schubert Club will choose, from
among the vast field of available light
and comic operas, something more
suitable for presentation at Stanford
than was "Fatinitza." It is possible,
and it is necessary, if we are to con
tinue to produce standard professional
operas.

did after the "Mikado" or the "Uver
nian Princess." It is probable that
in the light of advanced musical com
position, it would stand up better un
der a test than either of these other
operas which we have mentioned, but
for a college audience it was im
measurably inferior to either.
It was apparent from the very open
ing either that more time had been
spent on the coaching of the music
than on the lines and business of the
actor, or else that Mr. Bartlett was
unable to properly coach an opera in
anything outside of the music. The
lafet proposition probably contains the
larger modicum of truth, as from past
experiences it is well known that his
forte lies in the coaching of the mu
sic.
Anachronisms Creep In.
Anachronisms managed to creep in
with surprising regularity throughout
the entire opera. We wondered in the
first act if Miss Beach might not be
a triffle chilly in her short sleeved
dress, when the poor soldiers only
managed to keep themselves warm by
violent stampings and calisthenics.
Hassan Bey was able to produce an
up-to-date Colt revolver to cover the
nonchalant newspaper correspondent,
when this cohorts carried ancient
flintlocks wonderful to behold and of
a pattern never before seen in the
Eastern or Western hemisphere.
In the last act the dress suits were
of a surprisingly modern cut. These
things, however, did not spoil the
parts in which they occurred.
Scenically the opera was one of the
best produced here. The first act was
realistic. The snow-balling scene was
almost chilly in its reality. The sec
ond act presented a scene of volup
tuous Oriental splendor such as would
do credit to any professional stage.
The little black twins waving the pea
cock feather fans over the reclining
beauties were a splendid touch. The
shadow play was tremendously inter
esting and novel. And the costuming
of the first two acts excellent.
A note of unconscious comedy crept
into one rather serious place when
Hardy produced from his over-loaded
grip a "bawl-out" and announced in
all seriousness that it was a tragedy
in one act. Perhaps he spoke mor'
wisely than he knew.

Acting honors for the evening un
doubtedly fall to L. W. Lewis, Jr. '14,
in the part of Tsset Pasha. His
work bore an unmistakable stamp
of originality from his first appearance
until his last. Whenever he entered
it was evident that the audience un
conciously said "Now, we shall see
something very worth while." His
dance steps as they properly should
have been were models of absurdity.
His gestures were well timed and
caused many a ripple of pleased
laughter. He assumed throughout ex
actly the proper attitude of broad en
nui that one would expect in an in
digent Eastern gentleman, bowed down
with the care of supporting four wives,
and maintaining them in neutral and
non-belligerent states of mind.
Second honors fall to E. E. Manning
'13, who played Steipann, and R. Ben
nett '15, as Mustapha. Manning made
a small part stand out as one of the
best in the entire opera. His work
throughout was consistent and good.
His accent was the best we have ever
heard at Stanford. The business which
he introduced into the part almost by
force, was nevertheless anything but
forced. He made the most of a small
opportunity. Bennett carried his
work through in much the same way.
His part was a thankless one at best,
and he was given but few lines. His
business carried him along splendid
ly, however, and he was never out
of the action for a moment.
Miss Moloney's Good Voice.
Among the women who played prin
cipal parts there seemed to be a gen
eral indifference as to the progress of
the Dlav. The chorus alone showed a

happy spontaneity—in those scenes
where spontaneity was possible. Miss
Maloney '14, again demonstrated be
yond any reasonable doubt that she
is the possessor of one of the best
voices that Stanford has ever heard
from a student. Her tones were rich,
full and pleasing, and all her solos
were well rendered. In the quar
tettes the volume of her tone may have
given her a slightly too great predomi
nance, but it was never unpleasant,
and not infrequently added just the
right touch of quality to these num
bers.
.Miss N. Beach '13, as the Princess
Lydia, had, we understand, an unfortu
nate cold on the evening of the per
formance. Her voice, even so, was
pleasing, although quite husky. The
cold seemed to chiefly effect the vol
ume of the voice and it was here that
it was most painfully felt. Sometimes,
it was difficult to hear it above the
orchestra. Miss Beach, had, however,
a pleasing and easy manner on the
stage and gave us an altogether satis
factory picture to carry away.
Mc(*uire Carries Part Well.
As the cool, nervy, and rescourceful
correspondent for an American news
paper, H. B. McGuire '13, carried off
the part of Julian Hardy well. Among
the men he undoubtedly had the best
voice. In the several solos that he
sang his voice was clear and pleasant
and his enunciation good. His best
work was when he described in song
the troubles of a correspondent at the
front. In the other numbers in which
he appeared his well-trained and
smooth tenor showed up to good ad
vantage. His acting was always easy
and well timed and his stage pres
cence, excellent.
H. F. Broomel M3, as the Russian
commander, General Kantchukoff, had
one of the most difficult parts of the
opera to play. It is a happy piece of
luck in a college production, partic
ularly in an opera, when a good sing
ing voice can be found joined to act
ing abilities in the same person.
Broomel pleased with his gruff voice,
exactly portraying the violent gen
eral, but in his acting scenes he fell
short. His make-up was splendid,
however, and was a redeeming fea
ture.
Others in minor parts played very
well. Tn fact the minor parts were

played quite as well as were those of
the principals, with but one or two
exceptions.
We hope, though, that in the future
the Schubert Club will choose, from
among the vast field of available light
and comic operas, something more
suitable for presentation at Stanford
than was "Fatinitza." It is possible,
and it is necessary, if we are to con
tinue to produce standard professional
operas.
"Fatinitza" was neither a suc
cess nor a failure. Since failures
are more difficult to avert than medio
cre successes to attain, Saturday's
performance may be said to have
been close to a very mediocre suc
cess. Had it not been for the excel
lent work of a few members of the
cast and the unusual novelty of the
scenes presented, it would undoubted
ly be necessary to record a failure.
As it turned out, the poor portions
of the piece just about balanced the
good parts.
Opera Bad Selection.
The primary fault lay not so much
with the cast as with the opera itself.
"Fatinitza" was an unfortunate se
lection for a college opera in no mat
ter what light it is viewed. The mu
sic was difficult; the lines were aged
and time worn and lacked the spon
taneity and natural humor which one
looks for in light operas. In a word,
the piece, with the exception of an
occasional scene, was slow.
The music was undoubtedly good
but it had none of the lyric qualities
which make an air haunting. We hear
no tunes from "Fatinitza" whistled
around the Quad this morning as we
did after the "Mikado" or the "Uver
nian Princess." It is probable that
in the light of advanced musical com

Eastern or Western hemisphere.
In the last act the dress suits were
of a surprisingly modern cut. These
things, however, did not spoil the
parts in which they occurred.
Scenically the opera was one of the
best produced here. The first act was
realistic. The snow-balling scene was
almost chilly in its reality. The sec
ond act presented a scene of volup
tuous Oriental splendor such as would
do credit to any professional stage.
The little black twins waving the pea
cock feather fans over the reclining
beauties were a splendid touch. The
shadow play was tremendously inter
esting and novel. And the costuming
of the first two acts excellent.
A note of unconscious comedy crept
into one rather serious place when
Hardy produced from his over-loaded
grip a "bawl-out" and announced in
all seriousness that it was a tragedy
in one act. Perhaps he spoke mor'
wisely than he knew.

Acting honors for the evening un
doubtedly fall to L. W. Lewis, Jr. '14,
in the part of Tsset Pasha. His
work bore an unmistakable stamp
of originality from his first appearance
until his last. Whenever he entered
it was evident that the audience un
conciously said "Now, we shall see
something very worth while." His
dance steps as they properly should
have been were models of absurdity.
His gestures were well timed and
caused many a ripple of pleased
laughter. He assumed throughout ex
actly the proper attitude of broad en
nui that one would expect in an in
digent Eastern gentleman, bowed down
with the care of supporting four wives,
and maintaining them in neutral and
non-belligerent states of mind.
Second honors fall to E. E. Manning
'13, who played Steipann, and R. Ben
nett '15, as Mustapha. Manning made
a small part stand out as one of the
best in the entire opera. His work
throughout was consistent and good.
His accent was the best we have ever
heard at Stanford. The business which
he introduced into the part almost by
force, was nevertheless anything but
forced. He made the most of a small
opportunity. Bennett carried his
work through in much the same way.
His part was a thankless one at best,
and he was given but few lines. His
business carried him along splendid
ly, however, and he was never out
of the action for a moment.
Miss Moloney's Good Voice.
Among the women who played prin
cipal parts there seemed to be a gen
eral indifference as to the progress of
the Dlav. The chorus alone showed a

happy spontaneity—in those scenes
where spontaneity was possible. Miss
Maloney '14, again demonstrated be
yond any reasonable doubt that she
is the possessor of one of the best
voices that Stanford has ever heard
from a student. Her tones were rich,
full and pleasing, and all her solos
were well rendered. In the quar
tettes the volume of her tone may have
given her a slightly too great predomi
nance, but it was never unpleasant,
and not infrequently added just the
right touch of quality to these num
bers.
.Miss N. Beach '13, as the Princess
Lydia, had, we understand, an unfortu
nate cold on the evening of the per
formance. Her voice, even so, was
pleasing, although quite husky. The
cold seemed to chiefly effect the vol
ume of the voice and it was here that
it was most painfully felt. Sometimes,
it was difficult to hear it above the
orchestra. Miss Beach, had, however,
a pleasing and easy manner on the
stage and gave us an altogether satis
factory picture to carry away.
Mc(*uire Carries Part Well.
As the cool, nervy, and rescourceful
correspondent for an American news
paper, H. B. McGuire '13, carried off
the part of Julian Hardy well. Among
the men he undoubtedly had the best
voice. In the several solos that he
sang his voice was clear and pleasant
and his enunciation good. His best
work was when he described in song
the troubles of a correspondent at the
front. In the other numbers in which
he appeared his well-trained and
smooth tenor showed up to good ad
vantage. His acting was always easy
and well timed and his stage pres
cence, excellent.
H. F. Broomel M3, as the Russian
commander, General Kantchukoff, had
one of the most difficult parts of the
opera to play. It is a happy piece of
luck in a college production, partic
ularly in an opera, when a good sing
ing voice can be found joined to act
ing abilities in the same person.
Broomel pleased with his gruff voice,
exactly portraying the violent gen
eral, but in his acting scenes he fell
short. His make-up was splendid,
however, and was a redeeming fea
ture.
Others in minor parts played very
well. Tn fact the minor parts were

played quite as well as were those of
the principals, with but one or two
exceptions.
We hope, though, that in the future
the Schubert Club will choose, from
among the vast field of available light
and comic operas, something more
suitable for presentation at Stanford
than was "Fatinitza." It is possible,
and it is necessary, if we are to con
tinue to produce standard professional
operas.
"Fatinitza" was neither a suc
cess nor a failure. Since failures
are more difficult to avert than medio
cre successes to attain, Saturday's
performance may be said to have
been close to a very mediocre suc
cess. Had it not been for the excel
lent work of a few members of the
cast and the unusual novelty of the
scenes presented, it would undoubted
ly be necessary to record a failure.
As it turned out, the poor portions
of the piece just about balanced the
good parts.
Opera Bad Selection.
The primary fault lay not so much
with the cast as with the opera itself.
"Fatinitza" was an unfortunate se
lection for a college opera in no mat
ter what light it is viewed. The mu
sic was difficult; the lines were aged
and time worn and lacked the spon
taneity and natural humor which one
looks for in light operas. In a word,
the piece, with the exception of an
occasional scene, was slow.
The music was undoubtedly good
but it had none of the lyric qualities
which make an air haunting. We hear
no tunes from "Fatinitza" whistled
around the Quad this morning as we
did after the "Mikado" or the "Uver
nian Princess." It is probable that
in the light of advanced musical com
position, it would stand up better un
der a test than either of these other
operas which we have mentioned, but
for a college audience it was im
measurably inferior to either.
It was apparent from the very open
ing either that more time had been
spent on the coaching of the music
than on the lines and business of the
actor, or else that Mr. Bartlett was
unable to properly coach an opera in
anything outside of the music. The
lafet proposition probably contains the
larger modicum of truth, as from past
experiences it is well known that his
forte lies in the coaching of the mu
sic.
Anachronisms Creep In.
Anachronisms managed to creep in
with surprising regularity throughout
the entire opera. We wondered in the
first act if Miss Beach might not be
a triffle chilly in her short sleeved
dress, when the poor soldiers only
managed to keep themselves warm by
violent stampings and calisthenics.
Hassan Bey was able to produce an
up-to-date Colt revolver to cover the
nonchalant newspaper correspondent,
when this cohorts carried ancient
flintlocks wonderful to behold and of
a pattern never before seen in the
Eastern or Western hemisphere.
In the last act the dress suits were

things, however, did not spoil the
