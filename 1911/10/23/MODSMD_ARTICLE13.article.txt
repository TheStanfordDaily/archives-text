# DEFENSE IS CARRIED TO A FINE POINT
## NEGATIVE TACTICS ARE USED BY SOUTHERNERS. U.S.C. Holds Varsity to 6-0 Score.—Cardinals Do Not Play in Form. 
### 
Stanford Varsity tucked away an
other victory on Saturday In the only
away from the campus game on the
schedule, winning from the players
of the University of Southern Califor
nia, on Bovard field, Los Angeles, by
the score of G to 0. The long and
short of the matter was that the Car
dinal players took this opportunity to
indulge in the annual slump. No
other explanation holds.
Southerners Play Defense.
A week ago these players from the
southern metropolis engaged the
Freshmen from the university across
the bay and went down to defeat
before their onslaught to the score
of 14 to 0. A great lesson was ham
mered home to them as the result of
this game: that they were no match
for the northern aggregations who
had been playing the English game for
several years and that they could not
meet the Stanford Varsity one week
later at their game without being
swamped under a big score. Result:
for one week the southerners prac
ticed the science of defence, relying
simply on keeping the visitors from
crossing their line too frequently.
They did not even try to break in on
the score board. Throughout the du
ration of the match the Angels worked
the principles of defence for all they
were worth. Holding on to the ball
when downed proved effective, especi
ally as the referee could see no infrac
tion of the rules of rugby in this meth
od of play.
Brown Plays Best.
Brown played the best game for the
Cardinals. At all times he was on
deck. He failed to convert the two
tries that were made, but they were
so close to the side lines that only
phenomenal luck would have carried
the ball between the narrow gap
across the top of the goalposts. The
sensation of the day was sprung by
this sturdy Cardinal player when he
captured the ball at Stanford's 50 yard
line and sped the ball with his sure
boot across the horizon until it went
out across the side lines one foot
from the white flag at the southerners'
corner.
The kickoff as usual was followed
up by the swift rush of the Cardinal
rugby legion going through the defend
ing homers. But the practice in de
fence that the Angels had been given
stood them in good stead, and, al
though the Cardinals pressed hard
for a score they were unable to down
the ball behind the white chalked
line. The last ten minutes of the first
period was devoted to midfield scrum
ming, and the first half ended with the
score board as bare as the opening of
the game found it.
Two fries in Second Half.
During the latter period the fifteen
Stanford players rallied long enough
to send two tries over from near the
side lines. Geissler broke through
the defending line and netted a thirty
yard gain, then he shot the ball across
to the loose, with a side kick. A scrum
at 15 started a dribbling rush, and
Schaupp fell on the ball across the
line for the first try.
Brown soon followed this up with
his 60 yard spiral, but the Cardinal
players were unable to take it the rest
of the way. In the first well executed
passing rush of the day Cass, Harri
gan, Geissler, to Risling, paved the
way for another try, Erb taking the
ball over from a one-yard scrum. The
game ended with the ball at midfield,
and the score stood Stanford, 6;
Southern California, 0.
The line-ups were:
Stanford —W. L. Smith, A. Sanborn,
Watkins, Partridge, Boulware, Card,
Schaupp, Frank, Woodcock, forwards;
Cass, half; Harrigan, Reeves, Risling,
T. Sanborn, fives; Erb, center; Geiss
ler, Kern, wings; Drown, full.
University of Southern California —
Keller Livernach, Harrell, Adamson,
Olsen, Maddock, Schwartz, Murphy,
forwards; Albers, half; Foss, Wright,
Manning, fives; Mil liken, center; Hus
ton, Rubio, Davis, wings; Wright,
Wallace, full.

Stanford Varsity tucked away an
other victory on Saturday In the only
away from the campus game on the
schedule, winning from the players
of the University of Southern Califor
nia, on Bovard field, Los Angeles, by
the score of G to 0. The long and
short of the matter was that the Car
dinal players took this opportunity to
indulge in the annual slump. No
other explanation holds.
Southerners Play Defense.
A week ago these players from the
southern metropolis engaged the
Freshmen from the university across
the bay and went down to defeat
before their onslaught to the score
of 14 to 0. A great lesson was ham
mered home to them as the result of
this game: that they were no match
for the northern aggregations who
had been playing the English game for
several years and that they could not
meet the Stanford Varsity one week
later at their game without being
swamped under a big score. Result:
for one week the southerners prac
ticed the science of defence, relying
simply on keeping the visitors from
crossing their line too frequently.
They did not even try to break in on
the score board. Throughout the du
ration of the match the Angels worked
the principles of defence for all they
were worth. Holding on to the ball
when downed proved effective, especi
ally as the referee could see no infrac
tion of the rules of rugby in this meth
od of play.
Brown Plays Best.
Brown played the best game for the
Cardinals. At all times he was on
deck. He failed to convert the two
tries that were made, but they were
so close to the side lines that only
phenomenal luck would have carried
the ball between the narrow gap
across the top of the goalposts. The
sensation of the day was sprung by
this sturdy Cardinal player when he
captured the ball at Stanford's 50 yard
line and sped the ball with his sure
boot across the horizon until it went
out across the side lines one foot
from the white flag at the southerners'
corner.
The kickoff as usual was followed
up by the swift rush of the Cardinal
rugby legion going through the defend
ing homers. But the practice in de
fence that the Angels had been given
stood them in good stead, and, al
though the Cardinals pressed hard
for a score they were unable to down
the ball behind the white chalked
line. The last ten minutes of the first
period was devoted to midfield scrum
ming, and the first half ended with the
score board as bare as the opening of
the game found it.
Two fries in Second Half.
During the latter period the fifteen
Stanford players rallied long enough
to send two tries over from near the
side lines. Geissler broke through
the defending line and netted a thirty
yard gain, then he shot the ball across
to the loose, with a side kick. A scrum
at 15 started a dribbling rush, and
Schaupp fell on the ball across the
line for the first try.
Brown soon followed this up with
his 60 yard spiral, but the Cardinal
players were unable to take it the rest
of the way. In the first well executed
passing rush of the day Cass, Harri
gan, Geissler, to Risling, paved the
way for another try, Erb taking the
ball over from a one-yard scrum. The
game ended with the ball at midfield,
and the score stood Stanford, 6;
Southern California, 0.
The line-ups were:
Stanford —W. L. Smith, A. Sanborn,
Watkins, Partridge, Boulware, Card,
Schaupp, Frank, Woodcock, forwards;
Cass, half; Harrigan, Reeves, Risling,
T. Sanborn, fives; Erb, center; Geiss
