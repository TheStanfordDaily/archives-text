# Welcoming Dr. Jordan.
## 
### 
The setting forward of the date for
the banquet welcoming Dr. Jordan
back to America will give another
week needed time for making pre-

parations for the event.
We wish to particularly
call attention to the plan
that all social affairs on

the campus wherever possible should
be cancelled, leaving the evening
clear for every undergraduate to go to
San Francisco.
Several organizations with large
membership and with consequent wide
interest among students saw fit to
change to a later date affairs set for
next Friday, before it was known that
the Jordan welcome would not come
until November 3. Such spirit of
coming forward unasked is rare. Why
wouldn't it be a good thing for all
social happenings of that evening to
be cancelled, thus taking away every
possible excuse for not attending the
dinner in San Francisco. This oc
casion io an unusual one, in fact, un
precedented in Stanford history. Let
us use the opportunity in an unusual
way.
