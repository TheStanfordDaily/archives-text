# SECOND VARSITY HAS PACK SUPERIORITY
## SANTA CLARA IS DEFEATED BY 8-0 MARGIN. Saturday's Game in Mission Town Redeems Two Tie Games Played by 1915. 
### 
| Superiority in thfe' scrum and occa
| sional brilliant flashes by the backs
gave the Second Varsity the long end
of the score in the Santa Clara game
at the Mission town, Saturday, by an
8-0 margin. This Second team victory
redeemed the two tie scores to which
the fast Santa Clara combination held
the Cardinal Freshmen.
A clever dodging run by Templeton
brought the first try after fifteen
minutes of play. The little wing also
executed the easy conversion. Soon
after this Santa Clara rushed and
dribbled the ball down the field in a
burst of speed, and only fast work
and a clever boot by Tilton saved a
score. With the ball on Stanford's
25, the gun ended the first half.
After Yberrando's kickoff, White, in
an awarded kick for offside, shifted the
play to the vicinity of the Second
team's goal.
Haley's Hun Features.
Haley's 20-yard run and boot to
touch at Santa Clara's 5 relieved the
danger. After an exchange of free
boots, Best secured Haley's cross-kick
and dribbled to touch, whereupon San
ta Clara in passing rushes again
threatened the Cardinal line. Tilton's
timely kick once more figured, and
Stanford rushed the ball down the
field until a boot forced Best to save.
On Hogan's drop-out the ball again
went back to Stanford's 10.
On a line-out, Hubbard passed to
Tilton who kicked to midfield. On a
throw-in at the turf's center, Yberran
do passed to Ramage. The latter's
knock-on gave a scrum, from which
the Stanford hookers dribbled out so
that Santa Clara was forced to strenu
ously defend her goal. On an inter
cepted pass Haley found touch at the
Mission team's 10. From a throw in,
a passing rush, Hubbard, Darsie, Ha
ley, led to a try. Templeton could
not convert.
A. E. Roth held the whistle to the
