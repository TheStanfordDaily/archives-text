# Dr. Gardner Has Practical Subject.
## 
### 
Dr. Gardner spoke Sunday at the
University Chapel on "Social Morality
the Basis of Judgment." The subject
is one well fitted to interest college
students as it takes into consideration
a survey of practical ethics.
Mr. E. Joullin rendered a violin solo
and the choir gave an anthem, the
"Choral from St. Paul," as well as
the Canticle, "Jubilate."
