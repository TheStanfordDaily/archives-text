# CABLE SETS NOVEMBER 3 AS DATE OF WELCOME.
## President Jordan Replies to Question Of Alumni Association For Time For Banquet. 
### 
Coming across two thousand miles
; O r
of ocean the words "November 3"
were flashed by cable yesterday as t,he

answer of Presj-j
dent Jordan, at
Honolulu, to the
query sent by the
Alumni Association
about ten days ago,
asking for a date
for the banquet of
welcome in San
Francisco. All ar-

rangements had been made for next
Friday evening, October 27. Dr.
Jordan's cable, however, will put the
affair one week forward.
Advancing the time to November 3
will do away with any conflicts with
other events on that night, and all
campus happenings can be regulated
according to the new time set. Sev
eral organizations on the campus had
already cancelled their invitations for
next Friday night, very willingly.
The added margin of time will give
many other people a chance to pre
pare for attending the dinner on No
vember 3. All arrangements as to
banquet, railroad rates, and times,
will be continued for the new date set,
according to the plans of the alumni
committee in charge of the prepara
tions.
All planning to attend the banquet
should notify the Registrar's Office not
later than Monday, October 30.


DR. JORDAN.
