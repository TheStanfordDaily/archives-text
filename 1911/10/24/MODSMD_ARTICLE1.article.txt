# RUGBY FOR EVERYBODY IS PLAN NOW ADOPTED
## ROTH TO CONDUCT IMPROMPTU AFTERNOON GAMES. Any Stanford Man Desiring to Play Rugby Asked to Report To-morrow Afternoon. 
### 
In line with the movement, to give
every Stanford man an opportunity to
participate in athletics, conies an in
teresting announcement from the
oSlice of Student Adviser A. E.'Roth,
'00, This is to the effect that the mem
bers of rugby squad "A," the men tak
ing gymnasium work who have elected
rugby, and any other men in the Uni
versity who desire to play, may indulge
in impromptu rugby games on stated
afternoons on the Auxiliary Field.
Roth will appoint captains to chose
up sides from the men who appear
each afternoon, will organize the
teams, and referee the game.
The afternoons on which these
games will be held have not been de
cided upon as yet. but they will prob
ably occur upon the days when the
outside field is left free by a Varsity
scrummage on the turf. These scrum
mages are held at the discretion of
Coach Presley, and as many factors,
such as the condition of the team and
the state of the weather affect them,
he is not always able to set the date
for them in advance. It is probable,
however, that the games between the
pick-up teams will be held on Mon
day, Wednesday and Friday afternoons.
First Game To-morrow.
It has at least been definitely de
cided to hold the first one tomorrow
afternoon on the ontside field at 4:45,
and everyone who is interested in rug
by and feels the need of a little not
too-strenuous exercise is urged to re
port to Roth at that hour.
Material for these games will be
plentiful. It will include, in the first
place, members of "Squad A," which
consists of men who have been out for
rugby all season but have not been
connected with the Varsity or Fresh
men squads. It will also include gym
nasium men signed up for rugby and
members of the Freshmen team and
squad who were not retained with the
Varsity. Before the Freshmen were
disbanded Roth asked for an expres
sion from those who would desire
to come for such a series of games,
and a majority signified their inten
tion of doing so. It is hoped numer
ous other men around the University
who have not been out for rugby will
also respond to Roth's call. Those
interested should report at the Aux
iliary Field tomorrow afternoon at
4:45.
