All men who were in the University
last year and pledged money to the
Stanford Union, but who have not
returned this semester, have been
mailed personal letters by the campus
committee urging them to pay up their
pledges.
One hundred and fifty-four men have
been so notified, letters being sent to
all parts of the United States. The

or undergraduates.
A meeting of the big Union com

days to talk over matters with Instruc

that the Alumni and campus com
mittees may co-operate to secure bet

The committees, who are busy col
lecting money for the Union, are leav
ing no stones unturned in their efforts
to raise the sum needed to start the
clubhouse.
