# Row Rivalry Cause of Terrific Fight.
## 
### 
The first instance of rivalry between
the houses on the Row was apparent
this morning. In fact, matters had
gone to a degree far greater and worse
than any expected. ft was a case
of sorority vs. fraternity.
It was not a case of mere suffrage
argument, or piercing glances, or cut
ting words, but was a case of blows
and rough and tumble fight. Accord
ing to eye-witnesses to the unfortu
nate affair, she started it by scratch
i-iir. Then he hit her and the contest
was over. The Phi Psi bull-dog killed
the Kappa cat.
