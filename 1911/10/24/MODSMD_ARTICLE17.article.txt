When a man who has never attended
either university, offers a prize of mon
ey to be competed for at Stanford and
California an unusual
Interest amount of interest is
In Stanford, shown in us, more, com
paratively, even, than
when the alumni come forward to the
support of the institution. It is an in
terest which ought to be jealously
guarded and kept. The opinion of out
side people and their support, espec
ially, is something that every univer
sity requires. Stanford is in need of
this more than other institutions, and
the interest of people outside the uni
versity walls has not been built up
upon years and years of history.
The best way to keep this interest
is to pay it back. This will be best
done by a large number of law men
competing for this particular prize.
We need the Union.
