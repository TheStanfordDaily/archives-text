# BRANNER EXPEDITION FISHES HAVE ARRIVED
## SPECIMENS BEING CLASSIFIED IN LABORATORIES. Duplicates Will be Sent to New York. Maker and Mann Still in Brazil. 
### 
The fishes, collected by the Stanford-
Branner expedition to Brazil, have
arrived by freight from the Southern
republic and are being arranged for
exhibition in the laboratories of the
Zoology department under the direc
tion of Professor E. C. Starks, who
superintended the gathering of the
specimens.
Notwithstanding the long trip by
steamer and rail, the collection arrived
in perfect condition. The specimens
were prepared in formalin and solder
ed air-tight, in large kerosine cans,
in Brazil.
Nearly every locality visited by the
expedition is represneted in the col
lection, the larger part of which is of
fresh water species. Especially repre
sentative collections were made in
the vicinity of Natal, where the Stan
ford men made their headquarters at
the beginning of the exploration.
The specimens from the Amazon are
not as completely representative be
cause of the limited time at the dis
posal of the professors there.
Professor Starks states that it will
be impossible to determine the number
of species composing the collection un
til the fish have been classified. It
probably will be a year before this
is completed and the reports published.
Many Peculinr Species.
The collection, which fills about 150
large jars, includes a large number
of odd forms totally different from any
fresh water species of fish in North
America.
The specimens will be added to the
university collections as fast as they
are classified, with the exception of a
set of duplicate specimens to be sent
to the American Museum in New York
City, which contains the largest col
lections of this kind in the world.
Dr. J. C. Brainier, head of the Min
ing Department, who directed the ex
pedition, is desirous that the report of
the fishes be included in the univer
sity publications. This matter, as yet,
has not been decided upon.
The reptiles collected on the expedi
tion by Professor H. Heath for the
Academy of Sciences in San Francisco,
will be worked up in the laboratories
of the Academy.
W. M. Mann and Dr. Fred Baker, of
San Diego, who remained in Brazil,
were last heard from in the Madero
river country of the interior. They
probably will return before the first
of the year,
Mann has collected a vast number
of insect specimens which probably
will be brought here. The university
collections will receive duplicates of
all the species. Mann intends to take
advanced work in Entomology at Har
vard, and probably part of his collec
tion will be sent there.
The shells collected by Dr. Baker
will be sent to San Diego for prepara
tion as exhibits and classification.
Later they will be shipped to the uni
versity.
