Editor E. M. Einstein, '12, of the
"Daily Californian," has begun a cam
paign against the practice of filling
out dance programs for affairs that
are weeks off. Editorially he says:
"The filling of cards in advance for
the big dances is at best a matter of
necessity rather than of choice. The
ideal way, as generally accepted, is to
make out the program at the dance.
This is done at all the small dances,
but is necessarily impractical at the
big formal affairs. However, there is
no need of beginning months in ad
vance." He advises the control of the
abuse by the dance committees.

Athletic relations with Nevada have
become badly strained because of the

substitute the second team in the Ne

strong in their denouncement of the
treatment they have received.
