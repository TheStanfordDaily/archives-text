# SOCCER ELEVEN NOW HAS SECOND PLACE
## CARDINALS ARE CLOSE UP IN FOOTBALL LEAGUE. Pastimes Lead in Victories. University of California Are Tailenders in Championship Race. 
### 
Stanford's soccer eleven is now tied
for second place in the California foot
ball league. The forfeiture of the
Thistles to the Cardinal team last
Saturday and the action of the league
schedule committee in ordering the
Standford-San Francisco game replay
ed has given the local players the same
standing to date as the Burns, Thistles
and San Francisco clcbzs. According
to the official records the Stanford
team has taken part in three contests.
Two of these are accredited as vic
tories, and the one is a defeat. Three
times the Cardinal has kicked the ball
into their opponent's goal. Five
points have been scored against them.
The Pastimes, of San Francisco, lead
the league with a record of five
straight wins. The University of Cali
fornia Is the tail-ender in the race for
the championship. The. Berkeley
players have yet to record their first
victory.
Kx-Cliamipions Lose.
Last season the Vampires were the
California football league champions.
Thus far, they have not performed up
to their previous standard and occupy
a place in the middle of the percentage
column.
Coach Maloney has not been notified
as to the reason for the order to re
play the Stanford-San Francisco game,
made by the league schedule com
mittee. The most probable reason is
that the city team played a man who
was not eligible under the existing
registration rules. The contest was
played in San Francisco on October 14
and resulted in a defeat for the Stan
ford eleven.
