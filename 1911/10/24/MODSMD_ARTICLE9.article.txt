sities. W. J. T. Mackay, of Vancouver,
has the position of manager and the
halfback Newconibe is captain of the
team. The men will be quartered at
the fraternity houses in Berkeley.

for the Stanford team. Coach Schaef
fer has been playing a new formation
in his backfield in preparation for the
contest. Elliott and Allen have been
putin as fives, with Stroud at center.

nia team will be can not be judged
after their work against the Olympics
last Saturday.

California broke her date with Ne
vada for next Saturday in order to
meet the British Columbians. Octo
ber 28 had been decided upon at the
beginning of the year as the time for

the Northerners at that time, and be
cause California had no date open,
that day was named for the "Double-
V" game.

team being scheduled for a week from
