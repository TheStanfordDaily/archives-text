# TWO STRONG TRIOS ARE SELECTED FOR DEBATE
## SOPHOMOREâ€”FRESHMAN TEAMS ARE CHOSEN. Tryouts Held Last Night Follow Precedent and Are Well Contested Among Many Candidates. 
### 
Six underclassmen were chosen last
night after a competitive try-out to
represent the Sophomore and Fresh
man classes in the annual interclass
forensic contest. The successful sec
ond year debaters are C. C. Close, of
Spokane, Washington, O. H. Castle,
of Pasadena, and T. L. Smith, of Ir
win, Pennsylvania. V. M. Brydolf, of
San Bernardino, was chosen alternate
on the Sophomore team. P. L. Hig
gins, A. F. Coyle, both of San Jose,
and W. F. Kilcline, of San Mateo, will
represent the 1915 class. S. A. Oyen,
of Everett, Washington, was chosen as
the substitute for the trio.
Try-outs Well Contested.
The try-outs were keenly contested
and many of the speakers presented
excellent arguments. The first year
men did not come up to the standard
set by their older brothers, but most
of the contestants showed a wide
knowledge of the subject. The ques
tion used for the try-outs of both
classes was the recall of judges. A
large number tried out for the two
teams.
The judges of the Freshmen tryout
were Professor W. D. Briggs, of the
English Department, W. F. Hyde and
Reverend R. Campbell, both of Palo
Alto. W. Tucker '12, president of Eu
phronia, presided during the contests
of the first year men. E. E. Tincher,
'12, president of Nestoria, served as
chairman for the Sophomores. The
intersociety debating committee had
charge of the debate.
Professor B. E. Howard of the Econ
omics department, Professor H. L.
Cannon of the Department of History,
and Professor R. L. Green of the
Mathematics department, passed on
the merits of the second year orators.
From the view point of experience
the Sophomores have a slight advan
tage over their opponents. Two of the
members of the 1914 trio represented
their class on the winning Freshman
team of last year. These men are
C. C. Close and O. H. Castle. The
third speaker, T. L. Smith, was alter
nate on the 1911 intercollegiate team.
Close will act in that capacity in the
big contest next month. He is a mem
ber of Euphronia and Phi Kappa Psi
fraternity. Smith and., Castle belong
to Nestoria. The former has member
ship in Encina club and the latter
owes allegiance to Delta Chi. Brydolf,
the alternate, is also a thember of
Nestoria. Sigma Nu is his fraternity.
Fresh Mien Are Experienced.
Iliggins and Coyle of the first year
team competed as members of the
San .lose high school team for the
Stanford debating cup against Lowell
high school. Both men took part in
many oratorical battles for their pre
paratory school. Coyle is enrolled in
Euphronia society. Higgins is a Nes
torian and wears the pin of Theta
Delta Chi fraternity. He is also o"
of the speakers who will meet Cali
fornia in the intercollegiate debate
Kilcline is the holder of the Lela"
Stanford Junior Scholarship and de
bates for Euphronia. The Freshma
substitute, Oyen. is the only man se
lected for either team who is not a
pre-legal student. His major is Econ
omics.
The debate will take place during
the early part of next semester, prob
ably the last week in January.

Try-outs Well Contested.
The try-outs were keenly contested
and many of the speakers presented
excellent arguments. The first year
men did not come up to the standard
set by their older brothers, but most
of the contestants showed a wide
knowledge of the subject. The ques
tion used for the try-outs of both
classes was the recall of judges. A
large number tried out for the two
teams.
The judges of the Freshmen tryout
were Professor W. D. Briggs, of the
English Department, W. F. Hyde and
Reverend R. Campbell, both of Palo
Alto. W. Tucker '12, president of Eu
phronia, presided during the contests
of the first year men. E. E. Tincher,
'12, president of Nestoria, served as
chairman for the Sophomores. The
intersociety debating committee had
charge of the debate.
Professor B. E. Howard of the Econ
omics department, Professor H. L.
Cannon of the Department of History,
and Professor R. L. Green of the
Mathematics department, passed on
the merits of the second year orators.
From the view point of experience
the Sophomores have a slight advan
tage over their opponents. Two of the
members of the 1914 trio represented
their class on the winning Freshman
team of last year. These men are
C. C. Close and O. H. Castle. The
third speaker, T. L. Smith, was alter
nate on the 1911 intercollegiate team.
Close will act in that capacity in the
big contest next month. He is a mem
ber of Euphronia and Phi Kappa Psi
fraternity. Smith and., Castle belong
to Nestoria. The former has member
ship in Encina club and the latter
owes allegiance to Delta Chi. Brydolf,
the alternate, is also a thember of
Nestoria. Sigma Nu is his fraternity.
Fresh Mien Are Experienced.
Iliggins and Coyle of the first year
team competed as members of the
San .lose high school team for the
Stanford debating cup against Lowell
high school. Both men took part in
many oratorical battles for their pre
paratory school. Coyle is enrolled in
Euphronia society. Higgins is a Nes
torian and wears the pin of Theta
Delta Chi fraternity. He is also o"
of the speakers who will meet Cali
fornia in the intercollegiate debate
Kilcline is the holder of the Lela"
Stanford Junior Scholarship and de
bates for Euphronia. The Freshma

lected for either team who is not a
pre-legal student. His major is Econ
omics.
The debate will take place during
the early part of next semester, prob
ably the last week in January.
Six underclassmen were chosen last
night after a competitive try-out to
represent the Sophomore and Fresh
man classes in the annual interclass
forensic contest. The successful sec
ond year debaters are C. C. Close, of
Spokane, Washington, O. H. Castle,
