## Class Votes Money to Cap and Gown. Large Attendance at Meeting. 
### 
Discussion of the coming Plug Ugly
and the entertainment of the Califor
nia Seniors on the day of the Big Game
occupied the attention of the Senior
Class at this afternoon's meeting. The
meeting was the largest in point of
attendance the class has held this
semester. Over one hundred members
were present. The large number of
women students attending the meeting
was particularly noticeable.
Miss M. Graham reported 011 the
luncheon which is to be tendered the
Berkeley Senior women by Cap and
Gown 011 the day of the game. On mo
tion, the class voted to donate $rÂ»0 out
of the treasury towards this entertain
ment.
In order to establish a closer bond of
friendship between the Seniors of the
Universities and to begin a custom
which shall result in a closer relation
ship between the upperclassmen of the
institutions, the class authorized the
president to appoint three members to
look into the possibility of holding a
luncheon for the men of the class of
1912 at Berkeley. A. M. Donovan, L. D.
Summerfield and A. G. Budge, were
appointed to consider the matter.
Stunts to enliven the Plug Ugly next
Saturday night were discussed. Final
action will be left to the hands of a
committee, which will have complete
charge and will direct the men of 1912
on that occasion.
