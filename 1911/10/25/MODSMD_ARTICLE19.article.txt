# NEW FINANCIAL POLICY PLANNED FOR Y. W. C. A.
## System Will Promote Giving Among Members.â€”Treasurer Reports Disclose Important Facts. 
### 
The announcement of a new finan
cial policy was the general topic of
yesterday's open business meeting of
the Young Women's Christian Associa
tion. The detailed report of the treas
urer, prepared since the recent visit
of the state student secretary, revealed
startling facts.
While Stanford has at present more
members than any other student or
ganization in the territory, it appears
that the contributions are less than
several smaller institutions. The fail
ure to assume a proper share of finan
cial responsibility is especially notice
able in the case of payments for the
National and State Hoards, and for the
Y. W. C. A. work in Tokio, which the
student associations of California are
supporting. Stanford pays a smaller
secretary's salary than any of the
other associations under discussion.
While the present budget covers
sufficiently all present expenses, still
it allows nothing for these necessary
expansions. It was agreed that the
association should assume these extra
obligations. The discussion then turn
ed to ways and means of increasing the
present income. After many sugges
tions, it was finally agreed to adopt a
plan of systematic giving. Each mem
ber will be given the opportunity of
pledging to contribute a certain small
amount a week, varying according to
her ability and desire. Thirty women
were named as collectors. It is hoped
thereby to increase the revenues of
the Association materially, and at the
same time to encourage each member
in systematic giving.
