# GRAYS DEFEAT BLACKS 34-0 IN GOOD GAME.
## Many Passing Rushes Aid In Victory of First Varsity Over Second Team. 
### 
The Gray backs found the trail to
the other side of the Black goal line
yesterday, and the score, 34-0, indicates
the extent to which they used it. The
game marked a partial return to form
on the part of the Varsity, but a field
sloppy because of the recent presence
of the sprinklers, and the gathering
darkness in the second half, made
Class "A" rugby impossible.
Effective use of the cross kick and
Brown's consistency in converting
were noteworthy elements of the game.
In all but two instances his accurate
boot transformed the 3 of the try into
5.
The prettiest try of the afternoon
came when Harrigan received after a
passing rally and went 35 yards for
the score. This dashing little five was
in evidence at all stages of the game,
and together with his classmate, Geis
sler, was easily the star of the after
noon. These two players are not only
individually brilliant, but aid in the
precision of the team work.
Varsity Passing Good.
Several excellent passing rushes led
to substantial gains for the Varsity,
while others which should have been
successful were spoiled by poor pass
ing or fumbling.
A crowd of goodly proportions and
enthusiasm was present in the bleach
ers during the contest.

In less than twenty-four
hours after the tickets for the
dinner to President and Mrs.
Jordan in San Francisco, No
vember a were placed on sale
at the Registrar's Office over
one hundred were sold, a little
less than one-third of the ban
quet room at the Hotel Von
Dorn. This means that because
of the demand for tickets in
Sail Francisco by alumni that
undergraduates and local peo
pie must secure places Imme

Frank, have sustained only slight in
juries and will be in suits this after

Los Angeles, again injured the leg
which has prevented him from playing
for most of the season. Tt is not
known at present how long he will

Grays — Corbett, Sanborn .Haley,

Geissler, Whip
The Gray backs found the trail to
the other side of the Black goal line
yesterday, and the score, 34-0, indicates
the extent to which they used it. The
game marked a partial return to form
on the part of the Varsity, but a field
sloppy because of the recent presence
of the sprinklers, and the gathering
darkness in the second half, made
Class "A" rugby impossible.
Effective use of the cross kick and
Brown's consistency in converting
were noteworthy elements of the game.
In all but two instances his accurate
boot transformed the 3 of the try into
5.
The prettiest try of the afternoon
came when Harrigan received after a
passing rally and went 35 yards for
the score. This dashing little five was
in evidence at all stages of the game,
and together with his classmate, Geis
sler, was easily the star of the after
noon. These two players are not only
individually brilliant, but aid in the
precision of the team work.
Varsity Passing Good.
Several excellent passing rushes led
to substantial gains for the Varsity,
while others which should have been
successful were spoiled by poor pass
ing or fumbling.
A crowd of goodly proportions and
enthusiasm was present in the bleach
ers during the contest.

In less than twenty-four
hours after the tickets for the
dinner to President and Mrs.
Jordan in San Francisco, No
vember a were placed on sale
