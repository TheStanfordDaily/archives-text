were able to score four tries on pass
ing rushes. Three points were mark
ed up on a free kick.
The scores were made as follows:
First Half.
From a difficult angle on a free kick
Stroud scored three points. Score,
3-0.
Canfield, Elliott, and Evans sent the
latter over in a passing rush. Stroud
converted. Score. 8-0.
Vancouver here catne the closest to
scoring, when McGuigan barely
missed a free kick.
Second llnlf.
The Canadians held California for a
while, but after about ten minutes
play, a passing rush engineered by
Morris, Stroud, Elliott and Allen sent
