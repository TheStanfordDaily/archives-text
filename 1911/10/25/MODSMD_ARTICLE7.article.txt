# MIDDLE COURSE TAKEN FOR PLUG UGLY RULES
## RUSH WILL BE NEITHER FARCE NOR COMBAT. Definite Course of Rush In Inner Quad Is Set.—Referee Is Provided. 
### 
In order to again conform with the
objections of the Faculty against the
continuing of a set fight in the Up
perclass Plug Ugly, the Advisory
Hoard of the student University Con
ference has drafted two new additions
to the rules made last year. Because
of the general dissatisfaction shown
by members of both the two upper
classes last fall and the Conference,
alike, a definite agreement was made
as to the course which the two classes
will follow during the process of
cristening the plugs. This rule reads
as follows:
"There shall be a running fight
from the Law building proceeding
along the inner Quad in front of the
Registrar's Office, through the west
arch, down the middle of the inner
Quad, and through the east arch."
Seniors Will Mass In Arcli.
This virtually means that a prelim
inary "breaking in" of t the plugs will
take place in front of the Law build
ing, and that, while the Juniors are
circling through the west arch, that
the Seniors will mass in the east arch,
where a short contest for superiority
will take place. This arch was chosen
particularly in order that the fight
there should not be longer than a few
minutes duration. It was continually
emphasized at the meeting of the up
perclaas committees and the Advisory
Hoard ot tile Conference that anything
like a prolonged fight was to be avoid
ed. For this reason the following rule
was added to those of last year:
"There shall be a referee with full
power to terminate the rush by pistol
shot at any time when it asumes the
character other than that prescribed
by these rules."
1 he rules of last year were re
adopted in their entirety except in
the case of rule 3, where minor chang
es were made. The four rules of the
1911 Plug Ugly follow:
(1) The Juniors shall be allowed to
place their poster upon the campus
without any interferance whatsoever
by the Seniors.
(2) There shall be no roughhousing
of the show. The Juniors shall be al
lowed to produce the burlesque with
out such continued interruption as will
make it Impossible for the audience to
hear the lines. Any act which tends
to make the production of the show
impossible, such as stealing scenery
and kidnapping members of the cast,
is considered objectionable.
(3) The Plug Ugly shall be in the
nature of a running fight from the
Law building, proceeding along the
Inner Quad in front of the Registrar's
Office through the west arch down the
middle of the Inner Quad, and through
the east arch, with the customary
"plug smashing" by the Seniors. The
object of the rust shall be, as it was
in the original Plug Ugly, to christen
the plugs and not to carry on a set
rush between the two classes. The
Juniors may enter the Outer Quad at
any point, and their approach upon
the Quad shall be unopposed by the
Seniors.
(4) There shall be a referee with
full power to stop the rush by
pistol shot, at any time when it as
'sumes a character other than that,
prescribed by these rules.
The "referee" rule was put into the
regulations in order to provide some
means of safeguard over the rush in
case it becomes a long-drawn out
fight between the classes, such as
happened two years ago between 1910
and 1911. It will eliminate any dang
er of unfortunate accidents likely to
cause the abandoning of the Plug
Ugly in following years.
Meetings of both classes will be call
ed next Friday to agree on these rules
and to discuss anything relative to
th«m.
