# The 						Plug Ugly
## 
### 
A midway course has been chosen
by the University Conference between
the flght-to-the-finish Plug Ugly'Of

two years* ago and the
loose rush of last year, in
making out their rules.
We are glad that this

has been done. The rush of last year
was a farce and the year previous a
barbarous, childish struggle. There
is 110 reason for having a set contest
between the classes, like organized
pugilists. The tradition does not re
quire this, and it would be right that
such a tradition if carried out in
that way, should be abolished. We
would favor and applaud its abolish
ment. The christening of the plugs is
a peculiarly Stanford custom and one
that we ought not to lose. But it
should be kept in mind always that the
christening is the main thing and not
the fight.
To our mind, for upperclassmen, old
in he University and supposed to have
acquired some idea of seriousness, to
engage in what is practically a pugil
istic struggle, where combatants are
"laid out" and need medical attend
ance as in a prize fight, is childish.
It is not only childish; it is not need
ed.
Upperclassmen are not underclass
men, yet it seems necessary to
some members of the two olderclasses
that the underclass rush of two months
before should be repeated now in the
same spirit with only vaudeville and
more casualties added.
