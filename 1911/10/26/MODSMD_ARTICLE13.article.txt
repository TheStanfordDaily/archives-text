The plan to give the proceeds of the
Football Show this year to the Union
and Clubhouse should be carried out,
and as much money as possible be
turned over for the construction of
the two buildings. In such a plan,
money paid in by every student, prac
tically, is given in one lump sum for
the help of construction. There will
be no saying that any one student or
group of students gave money.
There has been such a narrow-mind
ed idea on the campus, that the Union,
particularly, will help one class of
men more than another, and that the
building will be of most benefit to
them. We can't understand how such
a rumor started, or how any men's
minds could be so narrow and petty
as to lose sight of the primary and
splendid purpose of the "Union",
where Stanford men join and meeu on
common ground. It is a shame that
any such idea could have gained
ground at all, and yet it has. The
Union is one huge fraternity house,
Hall and Palo Alto rooming house,
where all meet and get acquainted,
and learn to know the other fellow
and to help him. That has been the
trouble at other universities, and may
become so here, although now the men
stand upon a remarkably democratic
and equal footing, more so perhaps,
than at any institution we know of.
But if this new idea of the Union
works itself into men's minds there
is danger of this ideal condition chang
ing for the worse and becoming one
which ought to be avoided before all
else.
So let there be no obstacle set in
the way of giving money collectively
to the Union. The more of this kind
of giving the better. —We need the
Union.
