# AUSTRALIAN BOYS CLUB ON CAMPUS TOMORROW.
## Visitors From Antipodes Cannot Keep Saturday Date.â€”Entertainments Will be as Planned. 
### 
Announcement comes today that the
Australian Hoys who were expected
to visit the campus on Saturday next
cannot keep their engagement for that
time but will be the guests of the Stu
dent Body tomorrow instead. The
visitors will arrive some time tomor
row morning on a special train from
San Jose. A committee representing
the Student Body will meet the Anti
podeans and escort them to the cam-
Mis. The travelers will he shown
over the Stanford grounds during the
morning. At noon the guests will be
entertained at the various fraternity
houses.
The change in the day was made
necessary by an unexpected date
which arose today. At present the
boys are at the farm of the Boy
Scouts near San Jose. A long dis
tance telephone message was received
from them today asking if it would be
possible to change the date.
After luncheon the boys will see
any other points of interest which
they failed to cover in their morning
expedition and will then return to San
Jose on the special car.
The initial traveling expenses of the
boys were paid as far as San Fran
cisco. From that point they have
been rustling for themselves. They
expect to work their way from city to
city and see all the points of interest
in the United States.
