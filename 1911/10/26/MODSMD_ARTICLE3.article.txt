# FOOTBALL SHOW FUNDS MAY GO TO STANFORD UNION
## Net Proceeds Will Be Divided, Two Thirds to Union and Remainder to Women's Club House. 
### 
To assist the Stanford Union
and Women's Clubhouse in obtaining
sufficient funds to begin construction
at an early date a plan is on foot to
have the Executive Commttee of the
Student Body vote the proceeds of the
football show, "The Follies of Stan
ford," to the two student enterprises.
Two-thirds of the money over and
above expenses is to be devoted to the
Union and the remaining third to the
Women's Club House, according to
those who are agitating the proposal.
Big House Assured.
Every indication points to a record
! house at the show. Continuous vaude
ville will be the feature of the per-
I formance and the forty performers
who have taken places in the cast
promise to provide plenty of entertain
ment of the rollicking variety. Basing
an estimate on the receipts of football
shows of previous years on the Stan
ford stage, a net profit of $1000 should
lbe available for distribution to the
Union and Women's Club House. The
Executive Committee has not taken
j any action on the plan of turning over
the proceeds to the two special funds
j but definite action will probably be
. taken at the next meeting of that body.
The idea of having the money re
ceived from the show on the night of
the Big Game has met with the ap
proval of the men who are in charge
; of the collection of the money for the
Union. Such assistance, they say,
would be of material benefit to the
| committee which is now engaged in
active work of getting in the money
i which has been promised.

| Committee Will Meet Soon.
Early next week the committee ap
pointed by A. W. Ambrose '13, campus
chairman of the Stanford Union, will
meet with E. W. Smith '99, permanent
secretary of the Union, and will dis
cuss plans for an active continuance
of the campaign to gather funds for
the immediate construction of the pro
posed building. In order to give each
of the fifty assistant collectors a defi
nite idea of the amount of the money
outstanding from unpaid pledges held
by the undergraduates, Secretary
Smith will go over each of the pledges
with the lieutenant in whose territory
the pledgee resides. Men from the
various fraternity houses, from Encina
and from Palo Alto have representa
tion on the committee which has been
appointed to push forward the collec
tion of the money. The collectors
are divided into districts and each man
lias an allotted number of residents
to interview in regards to the Union.
Much of the preliminary work has al
ready been done and the committee
men will endeavor to bring the cam
paign to a successful close by getting
a sum sufficient to start work on the
Union immediately.
Plan For Union Submitted.
The above drawing of the proposed
Stanford Union is the work of J. K.
Branner '09, now a resident of New
York City. The structure as shown in
the drawing does not represent the
plan that will finally be selected by
the Board of Trustees of the Union.
However, it gives one a comprehensive
idea of the nature of the building.
