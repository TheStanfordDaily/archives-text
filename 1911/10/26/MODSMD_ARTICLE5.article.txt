# Foil and Mask Hold Regular Meeting.
## 
### 
The regular fortnightly meeting of
the Foil and Mask Fencing Club, was
held last evening at Roble Gymnasium.
The gathering was notable for the
large number of members in attend
ance. Fencing contests and exhibi
tions by the students were the features
of the evening, there being nothing of
general interest transacted at the busi
ness meeting.
