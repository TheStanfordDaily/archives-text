# EVERYMAN'S RUGBY IS AUSPICIOUSLY BEGUN
## TWO FULL TEAMS REPORT ON TURF YESTERDAY. Roth Referees Game Which Develops Surprisingly Good Brand of Football for Beginners. 
### 
By the appearance of two full teams
aside from the Varsity squad on the
turf field yesterday afternoon, the new
plan to insure general participation in
rugby was stamped as a success from
the start.
A. E. Roth, '09, called the men to
gether at 5 o'clock and organized two
teams, which were shortly locked in
a life and death struggle. The score
was a mystery to most at the close of
the contest, but the score was not the
important thing. Thirty men were re
ceiving enjoyable if rather strenuous
exercise, and were being initiated into
the mysteries of Stanford's major
sport.
A number of the players were entire
ly new to rugby, but Roth's coaching
coupled with half an hour of the live
liest kind of practical experience, in
stilled into them the principles of the
games. The fact that most of the
players were in the same class to'Â»k
away any possible emban-assment
which the neophytes might have felr.
While the game had its comedy ele
ments and tickled the bleachers great
ly, the general order of rugby exhib
ited was surprisingly good. Among
the bright stars were Peters, Stein
hart, and Campbell.
Although the games, which are open
to all Stanford men, will undoubtedly
be continued, the dates for the next
ones cannot be definitely determined
upon at present owing to the inter
ference of Varsity practice and games
with the Canadians for the next ten
days.
