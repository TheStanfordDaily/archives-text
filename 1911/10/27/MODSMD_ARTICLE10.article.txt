# SCHOLARSHIP RECORD SHOWS MARKED GAIN.
## Ninety-Three Double Warnings Sent Out.â€”Fraternity Men Make Big Improvement. 
### 
Scholarship at Stanford shows a
very perceptible increase over this
time last year. Today there were but
93 double warnings sent out, as
against 119 last October.
A marked gain in the scholarship of
the fraternity members is particularly
noticeable. Of the total 87 men warn
ed, 35 or 40 per cent, belong to fra
ternities. The remaining 52 men, or
GO per cent, are non-fraternity mem
bers. Of the total registration about
27 per cent belong to fraternities.
Of the 52 non-fraternity men re
ceiving warnings, 25 live in Palo Alto,
13 in Encina, 9 on the Row, and 5 are
commuters.
Last year's statistics show that 103
men. which was 9 per cent of the
total male registration, received warn
ings and sixteen women or 3 per cent
of the women students were sent
"smoke-ups."
The comparison of the figures of the
two college years show that this year
2fi less double-warnings were issued.
Sixteen men and 10 women were the
differences in numbers.
