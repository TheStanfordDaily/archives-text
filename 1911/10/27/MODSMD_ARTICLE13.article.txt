It is necessary for the spirit and
the continuance of the Plug Ugly in
its present form that every member
of each of the upperclasses observe the
rules tomorrow as published tonight in
the Daily Palo Alto. The personal
element in the rush should be kept
in the background, and the rivalry of
the classes and the christening of the
plugs brought to the fore. Especially
should there be obedience to the rule
providing for the ending of the rush
by a pistol shot if an emergency
arises. We need the Union.
