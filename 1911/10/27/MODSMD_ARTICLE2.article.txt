# UNABLE TO CHANGE DATE FOR DEBATE
## CONTEST MUST BE HELD ON NOVEMBER 3. Two Universities Could Not Agree on Shifting of Date Back to November 10. 
### 
November 3 is today announced as
the date of the intercollegiate debate
with California which was originally
set for the night before the rugby
contest between the two universities.
The changing of the time first settled
upon for the annual forensic battle
was necessitated by the refusal of the
Executive Committee of the California
Debating Council to ratify November
10 as the date of the contest. Because
of the custom of the alumni and
classes of the University of California
to hold reunions and banquets the
night previous to the Big Game, the
Blue and Gold committee considered
it inadvisable to agree to the former
date. The Stanford Agreement Com
mittee then proposed November 4, but
this time would not be accepted by
the Californians. It was found impos
sible to settle upon any evening
other than the one announced. This
date conflicts with the banquet to be
tendered to Dr. and Mrs. Jordan, and
as such was strenously objected to by
the Cardinal representatives.
The debate will begin at 8 o'clock,
and will be held in the Assembly Hall.
The judges have not yet been selected,
owing to the difficulty of securing men
o.' wide experience who have not al
ready taken a decided stand on the
question which will be discussed,
namely, that of the judiciary recall.
For the first time in several years
the Stanford debating team does not
include a member who has had pre
vious experience as an intercollegiate
debater. The trio of debaters who
comprise the Cardinal team form one
o". the most evenly balanced teams
which has ever represented Stanford.
Ml of the men who will speak on the
evening of November ?> have had a
large amount of experience in minor
forensic contests. W. B. Owens '11, is
the O 'ly one who has ever contested
for Stanford with an outside team.
Last spring he was one of the men
to make the journey to Seattle to meet
the University of Washington speakers
in the tri-state debates. Simpson has
appeared in numerous occasions in his
debating society, Nestoria. Higgins
is a Freshman with a record as a de
bater at San .Tose high school. He
was a member of the team which con
tested for the Stanford debating cup
against Lowell high school last year.
