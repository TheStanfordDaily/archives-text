# Brown Injures Shoulder.
## 
### 
More than ordinary alarm has been
experienced by the rugby enthusiasts
over the injury received by F. C.
Brown, Varsity fullback, during prac
tice yesterday. An X-ray of Brown's
damaged shoulder was taken by Dr.
Williams this morning, but the physi
cian has not yet been able to deter
mine the exact nature of the injury.
It is probable that the shoulder is dis
located. but the hurt may be even more
serious.
The veteran fullback will certainly
not appear in any games before the
intercollegiate contest, but it is hoped
that he will be sufficiently recovered
to play on November 11.
