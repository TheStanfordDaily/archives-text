# ROOTERS' HATS ORDERED FROM SAN FRANCISCO.
## New Hats For This Year Secured Finally Through Agency of The Regent. 
### 
After more trouble than that ex
perienced by the average woman in
supplying herself with new millinery,
the Stanford rooters have been assured
new hats for this year. The only re
spect in which the men have the ad
vantage is that their head coverings
are to cost only forty cents.
The order for the rooter hats has
been placed with a San Francisco
firm through the agency of The Regent
of Palo Alto. They will arrive the
latter part of this month and be placed
on sale on the Quad. The new hats
will be of the usual Cardinal hue, but
will in pattern somewhat resemble
those worn by the Sophomores.
SiifFicinet. hats have been provided
for all, and the price is within the
reach of the impecunious.
