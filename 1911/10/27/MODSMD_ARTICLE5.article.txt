# WOMEN WILL DECORATE FOR JORDAN DINNER.
## Hoard of Control Asks For Helpers to Bring Flowers to San Francisco. 
### 
The women of the University will
contribute their share and more to
the success of the dinner to President
and Mrs. Jordan at the Hotel Von
Horn next Friday night. The Board
of Control of the Women's League has
appointed a committee to gather red
geraniums from the oval to decorate
the tables at the dinner.
The members of the committee,
Miss G. Gill '12, and Miss V. Marshall
'12, have decided to ask the help of
all the women of the University to
take the flowers to the city. All
those who wish to assist can procure
flowers on Friday, the third of Novem
ber, at the rest room. The board has
decided to do as much as possible
toward stirring up enthusiasm over
the reception to Dr. Jordan, so that
tlie women of the University may be
well represented.
A decision was made at the meeting
of the Hoard last Thursday to place
photographs of the board in the Quad
and arrangements were made to have
them taken today.
