# PLUG UGLY PLANS REMAIN A SECRET
## JUNIORS PREPARED TO SPRING SURPRISES TOMORROW. New Rules For Rush Expected to Produce an Interesting But Non- Injurious Fight. 
### 
Plans for the Plug Ugly rush and
show were discussed today at the
meeting of the Junior class, it was
decided that the best arrangement for
securing a successful outcome of the
rush proper was to appoint a captain
to direct the force of the 1913 men.
R. F. Duryea was chosen to fill this
position. lie will give the word for
the advance of the Juniors from the
track to the Quad and again for the
actual commencement of hostilities
Tor the rush proper.
Student Adviser A. E. Roth spoke
to the men telling them of the require
ments for the rush and the necessity
of maintaining and living up to the
rules established, if the Plug Ugly is
to continue.
Volunteers were asked for help to
build and arrange the stage for to
morrow evening's performance.
Because of an undue reticence on
the part of the Plug Ugly Committee to
divulge the name of the play which
will be presented on the oval to
morrow evening, it is impossible for
the Daily Palo Alto to publish today
the title of the production. The name
must remain a mystery, however, until
tomorrow morning when the posters
will be put down by *he Juniors on
prominent parts of the campus.
A New Rule.
A new rule which should work well
this year has been adopted in regard
to the play which is to be given to
morrow evening. In the past, with
the partial exception of last year's pro
duction, the Seniors have been so voci
ferous in their applause, that it has
been impossible for the audience to
gather the least idea of what the play
was about. This year a new plan will
be adopted. The Seniors promise that
they will not lie niggardly with their
applause, even though it may take un
usual forms at times, in return for
this the Juniors promise that they will
i'low the fourth year men to present
such incidental attractions as they
have planned without interruption by
those on the stage.
According to the plans made today
the rush itself, following the play, will
not be so much of a farce as was the
case last year. Neither will it assume
the character of the set fight of the
Plug Ugly of 1909. Tt is hoped to
steer a middle course that will be both
I exciting and sane.
The following are the rules adopted
for the regulation of this year's Plug
Ugly:
(1) The Juniors shall be allowed to
place their poster upon the campus
without any interference whatsoever
by the Seniors.
(2) There shall be no roughhousing
of the show. The Juniors shall be al
lowed to produce the burlesque with
out such continued interruption as will
make it impossible for the audience to
hear the lines. Any act which tends
to make the production of the show
impossible, such as stealing scenery
and kidnapping members of the cast,
is considered objectionable.
(3) The Plug Ugly shall be in the
nature of a running fight from the
Law building, proceeding along the
Inner Quad in front of the Registrar's
Office through the west arch down the
middle of the Inner Quad, and through
the east arch, with the customary
"plug smashing" by the Seniors. The
object of the rush shall be, as it was
in the original Plug Ugly, to christen
the plugs and not to carry on a set.

Juniors may enter the Outer Quad at
any point, and their approach upon
the Quad shall be unopposed by the
Seniors.
(4) There shall be a referee with
Tii 11 power to stop the rush by
pistol shot, at any time when it as
-unies a character other than that
prescribed by these rules.

Plans for the Plug Ugly rush and
show were discussed today at the
meeting of the Junior class, it was
decided that the best arrangement for
securing a successful outcome of the
rush proper was to appoint a captain
to direct the force of the 1913 men.
R. F. Duryea was chosen to fill this
position. lie will give the word for
the advance of the Juniors from the
track to the Quad and again for the
actual commencement of hostilities
Tor the rush proper.
Student Adviser A. E. Roth spoke
to the men telling them of the require
ments for the rush and the necessity
of maintaining and living up to the
rules established, if the Plug Ugly is
to continue.
Volunteers were asked for help to
build and arrange the stage for to
morrow evening's performance.
Because of an undue reticence on
the part of the Plug Ugly Committee to
divulge the name of the play which
will be presented on the oval to
morrow evening, it is impossible for
the Daily Palo Alto to publish today
the title of the production. The name
must remain a mystery, however, until
tomorrow morning when the posters
will be put down by *he Juniors on
prominent parts of the campus.
A New Rule.
A new rule which should work well
this year has been adopted in regard
to the play which is to be given to
morrow evening. In the past, with
the partial exception of last year's pro
duction, the Seniors have been so voci
ferous in their applause, that it has
been impossible for the audience to
gather the least idea of what the play
was about. This year a new plan will
be adopted. The Seniors promise that
they will not lie niggardly with their
applause, even though it may take un
usual forms at times, in return for
this the Juniors promise that they will
i'low the fourth year men to present
such incidental attractions as they
have planned without interruption by
those on the stage.
According to the plans made today
the rush itself, following the play, will
not be so much of a farce as was the
case last year. Neither will it assume
the character of the set fight of the
Plug Ugly of 1909. Tt is hoped to
steer a middle course that will be both
I exciting and sane.
The following are the rules adopted
for the regulation of this year's Plug
Ugly:
(1) The Juniors shall be allowed to
place their poster upon the campus
without any interference whatsoever
by the Seniors.
(2) There shall be no roughhousing
of the show. The Juniors shall be al
lowed to produce the burlesque with
out such continued interruption as will
make it impossible for the audience to
hear the lines. Any act which tends
to make the production of the show
impossible, such as stealing scenery
and kidnapping members of the cast,
is considered objectionable.
