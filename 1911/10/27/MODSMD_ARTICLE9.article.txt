# VARSITY PLAYS OLYMPICS, VALIANT FOES OF CALIFORNIA
## Last Appearance of Clubmen on Stanford Field Finds Cardinal Team Without Full Strength of Lineup. 
### 
The Olympic rugby aggregation of
San Francisco will make its last
appearance of the season on Stanford
Field tomorrow afternoon, at 3:30, as
the last of the local teams to play the
Varsity before the Pig Game with Cali
fornia. This promises to be the best
game of the schedule thus far.
Tomorrow's game will be a signifi
cant one, since the Olympics have the
fastest team of the club fifteens. They
gave the Blue and Gold Varsity a hard
set-to last Saturday. The Californians
were kept hard at work through the
entire game and the Winged-0 men
were able to put one clean try through
their line. At least two more of their
plays should have taken the ball over.
Xever have the clubmen broken
the Cardinal defence for a try.

Flushed with ability to break through
the Blue and Gold line, however, the
Winged-0 players will do their best to
repeat their record tomorrow.
Clubmen Have Played Defence.
In former games the visiting club
men have been content to play the
safer game of defence in order to hold
the Varsity to as low a score as pos
sible. Last Saturday the clubmen en
gineered several creditable passing
rushes and showed a marked improve
ment in their work in the loose. Such
tactics used against the local Varsity
will be invaluable practice for the
locals, accustomed as they are to meet
little or no aggressive tactics from
their opponents in the contests before
the intercollegiate game in November.
Olympic captain J. O. Miller is slated
for the wing forward position on the
club's lineup. He is, undoubtedly, the
best player at this position that the
game of rugby has developed in the
United States. One of the rugby au
thorities on a San Francisco daily
paper recently said: "With J. O. Miller
as wing forward I would pit a seven
man scrum against any eight man
scrum in this hemisphere." Miller did
not play against California last Satur
day and his presence in the game to
morrow will greatly strengthen the
visitors.
Haley, A. Sanborn and W. L. Smith
will form the Cardinal front pack,
with Corbett and Watkins in
readiness to step into any vacancy
among the trio. The hard booting
Freshman captain, Haley, is the latest
addition to the training table, and is
out to make a place for himself on
the front of the scrum. Dole
and Partridge will play at middle
rank. On the rear rank will be Gard,
Schaupp and Boulware. Frank is out
of the game with his bad knee.
Cass backs the scrum as the half.
Harrigan takes the head of the back
line as first live. For second five
Noble is slated to take the second
five position. He has not occupied
that berth since the Nevada game
when he took Risling's place during
the course of the game..
Kisling Plays for Brown.
The biggest change in the order of
events is that caused by the recent,
injury to Brown, full back. The
Freshman Risling is to fill the vet
eran's place, and thereby is ended a
good deal of conjecture as to who
would take the place in case of such
an accident as forced the temporary
retirement of Brown. Risling has had
liitlo experience as full, in fact, prac
tically none, since he played for the
last few minutes of the Santa Clara
-1915 match two weeks ago. His po
sition in preparatory school and while
on the Varsity squad has been five.
He may, however, develop into a
worthy substitute for the hooter Brown
tf> hold the place until the latter's re
turn to the line-up.
Erb will be stationed at center.
Geissler and Kern will again stride
together on the wings.
