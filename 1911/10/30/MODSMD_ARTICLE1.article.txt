# DR. JORDAN RETURNS FROM VISIT TO ORIENT
## President Brings Back Interesting Data in Regard to Japan.—Sixty-four Addresses Given on Trip. 
### 
After an absence from this country
of over ten weeks, President David
Starr Jordan arrived on the campus
Saturday morning. During this time
Dr. Jordan has been in Japan and
Corea lecturing on the topic of "Inter
national Peace." The steamer "Mon
golia," bearing the President and Mrs.
Jordan, arrived in quarantine at 7:30
a.m., on Saturday, and docked about
an hour and a half later at Pier 44.
During his absence the President
spoke no less than sixty-four times
before representative Japanese audi
ences of statesmen, students, profes
sors in institutions of learning, and
business men.
lirings Encouraging Message.
The President received a wonderful
reception at all times during his visit
to the Flowery Kingdom. He was ex
tended many unusual courtesies at
every point at which he stopped.
The Japanese apparently extended
themselves to give to America's fore
most advocate of peace all the innate
hospitality of the country. Dr. Jor
dan was invited to speak at gatherings
of every kind. Banquets were given
in his honor in almost all of the prin
cipal cities in which he stopped and
at each of these he spoke on his fa
vorite topic. At all of these affairs,
according to Japanese custom, the
President, as the guest of honor, was
given some gift as a token of apprecia
tion. He returned to this country
loade 1 down with rare and extra
ordinary examples of the peculiar art
forms of the Japanese.
President Jordan returns to America
with the encouraging message that
Japan neither desires or is prepared
for an international war of any kind.
"In Japan," said the President,
"there is less danger of the war fever
than in most nations. At present there
i : little of the spirit of war for war's
sake among the civilized nations. Ja
pan does not desire an exhausting and
draining international contest. She
still feels and must continue to feel
for years to come the loss in manhood
and money which a great war brings,
and the present burden of taxation on
the working people who must pay for
wars.
"I found in Japan an unprecedented
demand for lectures on 'Peace.' There
is at present little of the exaltation of
militarism above the duties of civil
and industrial life in Japan. The na
tural love of strife among men finds
its adequate outlet in baseball and
football in Japan as in America.
Sixty-four Addresses Given.
"I spoke in all sixty-four times in
Japan and Corea, mostly under the
auspices of the numerous peace so
cieties flourishing in the Kingdom. 1
addressed mass meetings in Tokio,
Yokohama, Sebdad, Kasnizawa, Na
goya, Osaka, Kobe, Okayama, and
Seoulin, Corea. 1 also spoke to uni
versity and other audiences in these
cities and in Kyoto and Fusan,"
Probably one of the most signifi
cant messages which the President
brought back to this country was the
one in regard to the present revolu
tion in China. According to Dr. Jor
dan, the revolution points to the fall
of the Manchu dynasty which has so
long been in control of Chinese affairs.
Although the revolution broke out af
ter the "Mongolia" had sailed, with
the President aboard, the news of its
progress was (lashed to the big liner
by wireless for many days after its
departure. The President is not ac
quainted with conditions as he is with
Japan. He said, however, in regard
to the revolution:
"There is no question but that the

Manchu must go. Although there was
no trouble during my stay in the
Orient, it would appear that the
people are displeased with the im
perial government and had made pre
parations to overthrow."
Explains True Cost of War.
Referring again to his lectures on
peace, Dr. Jordan said:
"Among other things I tried to show
the Japanese why no nation ever had
a great army, a great navy, a great
war debt, and prosperity all at the
same time. The cost of war is three
fold, —the loss of manhood, the loss
of morals, and the loss of money. It
means absolute bondage on the part
of the nation to the money lender.
"Japan is moving cautiously," he
continued, "in military ways. Like
other great nations she is spending
more than she can afford on guns and
war ships. To a large degree this is
to keep up the fashion, to retain her
standing as one of the "great powers,"
and partly to guard against surprises,
real or imaginary. It is clear that
Japan neither expects or desires war,
but she cannot quite keep above the
influence of the professional maker of
war scares.
Japan Is Friendly to America.
"Japan recognizes in America her
best customer and nearest friend,
sometimes a bit estranged for a mo
ment, but never for long. Her own
interests lie wholly in Asia. She has
nothing to spend on an international
war."
When the "Mongolia" dropped an
chor in Quarantine at the foot of
Powell street, the revenue cutter
"Golden Gate" pulled out from the
head of the Revenue of San Francisco
that President and Mrs. Jordan be ta
ken off on the cutter without waiting
for the tedious process of bringing
the giant ship to dock. The President,
however, preferred to remain aboard,
so that his baggage might pass the
custom house with the least possible
delay.
During his entire visit in the Orient
Dr. T. Kunia '97. acted as special sec
retary and interpreter for the Presi
dent. The itinerary for the seven
weeks stay was planned by another
alumnus, F. Kukakita '99.
Dr. Jordan reports that there are at
present about fifty alumni of the Uni
versity in Japan. Two of these are
connected with the United States em
bassy.
Transportation Facilities Poor.
The President states that transpor
tation facilities have not improved in
the eleven years since his last visit as
have other economic factors in the
land of the Mikado. He says that
ihere are at present but two hundred
automobiles in the entire Kingdom.
Sunday, Dr. Jordan will leave for
the East, where he will deliver a
series of addresses before prominent,
bodies on "International Peace."
