# REDLANDS PREACHER SEES TEXT IN REVELATION
## CHAPEL SPEAKER CHOOSES AN INSPIRING SUBJECT. Real Good of Humanity Contrasted With Purely Mercenary Ideals by Dr. Blaisdell. 
### 
Reverend Blaisdell, of Redlands,
took for the text of his sermon at the
Chapel yesterday, the first verse of
the fourth chapter of Revelation,
"Come lip Hither and I Will Show
Thee Things Which Must be Here
after."
He said that had both char
acteristics and tenses. Some minds
live always in the past, having no
spirit of venture and progress; some
live in the present, having the idea
that what is, is right enough; and still
others live in the future with ideals
of the betterment of mankind always
i-i view.
The message that Mr. Blaisdell
wished to convey was that the great
est things to come and the greatest
t > be done in the world are not in
material fields, but in the advance
ment of humanity. It is also his
belief that no ideas for progress are
over too daring to attempt, although
the world now asks, "Will this change
hurt my dividends or unsettle my
comfort," instead of asking, as it
should, "Is this thing worthy or ought
it to exist."
The choir sang an anthem, "Dedi
cation," by Dudley Buck.
