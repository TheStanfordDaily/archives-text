# CARDINAL’S BRILLIANCY DOWNS OLYMPIC FIFTEEN
## Backfield Substitutes Play the Game Like Veterans. Forwards Show Splendid Unity of Action. 
### 
In one of the best games played on
I Stanford field this season, the Cardinal
1 Varsity defeated the visiting Olympics
by the score of 39 to 3, on Saturday
afternoon. Although the Cardinals
were weakened by the absence of
Brown at full, Geissler at left wing,
and the lack of a veteran at second
five, a surprising amount of brilliancy
and unity was the order of the game.
The match was fought, mainly, in
the forward division. This was par
ticularly true of the Olympics, who
failed to show the passing ability in
the Imckfield that they demonstrated
against California a week ago. This
was offset, however, by their speed
and effective kicking, especially when
hard pressed near their backline.
Varsity Showing Gratifies.
The showing of the Cardinal Var
sity was gratifying to all. For the
first time the rooters were impressed
with the fact that Coach Presley has
perfected one of the most versatile
teams that have ever been turned out
to defend the Cardinal. The Varsity
went into the field with three of the
most important of the backfield posi
tions filled with new men, but in each
case the places were played with en
tire satisfaction.

Noble at second five played well.
He was a sure tackier and never slip
ped a notch on the passing route.
Templeton, the Freshman, played at
wing as Kern's mate, with all the bril
liancy that he showed on the Fresh
man fifteen. Once in the opening
minutes he faltered, but not seriously,
but this was perhaps due to stage
fright. Never again did he loosen his
playing. Templeton's tackling effec
tiveness was best shown soon after the
opening of the second half when he
spilled Decius so hard that the ball
was knocked from the Olympic's
grasp with the result that Erb secured
and went over for a try. Risling was
a surprise at full. His defense needs
more polishing up at the crucial
point but his offense was splendid.
As a runner-in with the ball through
a scattered field, to find a distant
touch, he came near to equaling
Brown.
<*ood Biickiiclil Work.
Cass played in the best form that
he has shown this season. He got
away several splendid boots and care
fully timed his passes. One of the
tries he took over unassisted, when
he secured at the Olympics 35, booted
a short lift over the closing-in Olym
pics, picked up again and went over.
Erb played well and used his long
distance boots to touch to perfection.
The first tally was a splendid one,
made from 30 by a passing rush by
Noble, Dole, Cass, Harrigan to Tem
pleton. Cass made the next from 35
and Erb added a conversion. The
"coring of the first period was closed
when Gard dribbled through the loose
from 25, caught up the ball, and went
across. Kern failed to convert. Score,
11-0.
Twenty-Eight Points Added.
Templeton paved the way for the
opening try of the last half one min
te and a half after the period was
opened, when he tackled Decius at the
Olympic's 30, and extracted the ball.
Erb finished the work by taking the
pigskin over.
The lone tally of the visitors was
sandwiched in as the next diversion.
From near mid, Peters broke through
rhe loose, transferred to Sundell, and
then the pair dribbled past Risling,
Peters falling on the ball behind the
Cardinal line.
Pressing for a score. Miller hoisted
the leather across the field away from
the Cardinal pack, but only to drop
it into Erb's hands on the Cardinal
35. Erb carried to mid and passed to
Kern. The speedy wing outdistanced
his pursuers and, at the end of tlie
fifty-five yards, placed the ball down
'or a try. After an exchange of kicks,
Templeton blocked Fletcher's return,
and Hubbard secured at 3 and drove
across. The Stanford forwards put
the next try through with dribbling
tactics, Taylor falling on the ball for
the tally. Soon after the kickoff Noble
was across with another score. Erb
converted the last four tries. Final
score, Stanford. 39; Olympics, 3.
