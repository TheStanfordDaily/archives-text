# PLUG UGLY SATURDAY ENJOYED BY HUNDREDS.
## Classes Observe Rules to Letter.â€”Seniors Rival the Juniors in Writing Fosters. 
### 
"Slams" of both a physical and men
al nature were in order, Saturday,
among the Juniors and Seniors, the
occasion being the 1911 Plug Ugly
' ow and rush. The show was held
before nearly 1,000 people at the track
Saturday night, and the wisdom of
tiie new Plug Ugly rules was dis
played, as none of the actors were
missing and all the hits went over the
footlights while no missiles flew the
other way.
Following the show, the rush was
held on the Quad. With their newly
frescoed plugs on exhibition for the
first time, the Juniors made the cir
cuit of the Inner Quad with the
Seniors at their side, bent oil christen
ing the new headgear. The Seniors
massed at the Law Building for the
first affray and later at the outer arch,
where the most formidable resistance
to the march of the Juniors was made.
The rush was witnessed by hundreds
and so great was the crowd that many
spectators received taps intended for
the participants.
Long before the sun was up Satur
day morning the Juniors were about,
decorating the Quad with their pos
ters, but when the light arrived theirs
was found to be not the only poster
on display, the Seniors having also
decorated the walks with a placard.
Both posters were cleverly arranged,
and teeming with remarks concerning
those who had '"made" them.
The show was of a similar nature.
"The Death of the Dirty Dozen," was
the official title and the scenes were
'aid in the Library, on the shores of
Lake Lagunita, and on the Quad.
Only two scenes were given, however.
In both, the "take-offs" were good and
readily recognized by the audience.
Strains of several of the songs render
ed at the affair caught the popular ear
;it once and the following day heard
them on the Quad.
An innovation at the show was the
appearance of the Juniors in a body.
The third year men, with their new
plugs, held seats of honor directly
beneath the stage, while the other
classes watched the show from the
bleachers.
