# Home Coming.
## 
### 
From an absence of many weeks in
Japan we welcome President Jordan
back to the University and friends.

It is certain that every stu
dent looks forward to the
Assembly on Wednesday, at
which the whole Student

Body can be present to show their
appreciation of the home-coming. The
week will be a splendid one in all
respects, ending as it does with the
bfc; dinner in San Francisco. To se
cure the full meaning of the occasion
it is necessary that at least half of
those present be undergraduates. So
each individual student should count
up his or her pence and, if possible,
reserve a place for the dinner before
tomorrow morning.
