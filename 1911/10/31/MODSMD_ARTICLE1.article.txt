# CALIFORNIA WILL AGAIN SEND VETERAN TEAM
## POSITION OF FULL THEIR BIG WEAK SPOT. But One Position Will Be Filled By Novice.—Many Veteran Substiutes Eligible. 
### 
Almost the identical problem of a
year ago again confronts the Cardinal
Varsity, with conditions at Stanford
somewhat changed, however. Last
year fourteen Blue and Gold veterans
faced the Cardinal. This year four
teen again faces Stanford, but three
of theae were substitutes last fall.
Notwithstanding this, the situation is a
grave one. One weakness alone is to
be found in the California team and
that is at full. Price and Bogardns
are the candidates for this place.
Price sprang into the limelight by his
clever work with the California team
in their games with Victoria during
the Christmas holidays a year ago.
Bogardus, however, has made the best
showing this year, having played on
his Freshman team during their season
and, until recently, substituting for
Price. By his showing against the
British Columbia team last Saturday
he practically cinched the fullback
position.
Heavy Eight-Man Scrunu
Carpenter and the Phleger brothers
form the front rank. The Phlegers
are hard workers, effective hookers
and blockers. The middle rankers,
Hardy and Hansen, form the giant
center duo. They are sturdy players
but lack the brilliancy of Dole in the
lineouts. Hardy is a good booter and
is used for difficult conversions.
Swartz and Pauly form a breakaway
pair that is hard to beat. They are
speedy and sure. Both of these men
can handle the ball on a passing com
bine, like backs. Pauly is, perhaps,
the star of the pack, and is a factor
that must be reckoned with at all the
stages of the game. King, at lock,
completing the rear-rank trio, holds
them well together.
The forwards as a whole are fast
in following up. In the working of
the scrum they are adepts. Quick to
heel out and to screw the scrum, using
to good advantage all the allowed
methods of blocking their opponents
when they try to break through. On
the lineouts they are not so sure.
Seemingly unable to make the most of
getting i!]) after the ball and snapping
it out to their waiting backs. Though
when the ball gets into their hands
they are quick to form around it and
use their feet.
Morris Net Infallible.
Morris heads the backfleld as the
scrum half. He is quick at getting
the ball to his backs, handling it
easily in whatever way it. is heeled out
to him. He is not infallible, however,
and is subject to occasional slumps.
Captain Elliott plays the first five, but
mi t i last, Saturday he did not come up
i i his reputation of previous years on
the gridiron. Tin is a good touch finder
for distance, and when playing at par
if always on deck. At second live,
Stroud is a strong passing unit and
a clever dolger through the loose
Allen and Pert nre slated for, th"
center and wing positions. Both of
these men at-e df* small stature but
are wonderfully quick on the aggres
sive and are able to kick effectively
when there is need. All of these backs
ar:» the ve'ernns of last year's Var
sity. Elliott and Stroud were :il«o o-<
the 1909 Varsity, the others were sub
stitutes in 1909. Whatever may be
their .shortcomings in the preliminary
games they are formidable factors
when the intercollegiate struggle is on
tV boards.
M"tts B"s1 nil Team.
Watts plays the other wing as
Feart's mate. The show ing that he has
made this season stamps him as the
greatest player on the Blue and Gold
aggregation. He is brilliant at all

times and stars when in a tight place,
always seeming to make the best move.
; Bogardus seems slated for full and is
j a mediocre though steady player.
The team as a whole is a strong one,
but it is not so powerful or so well
balanced as that of last year. Their
! be t game is played when on the ag
! -essive. On the defense they seem
I almost weak and when hard pressed
I resent a tar from invulnerable wall.

aggregation. He is brilliant at all

times and stars when in a tight place,
always seeming to make the best move.
; Bogardus seems slated for full and is
j a mediocre though steady player.
The team as a whole is a strong one,

balanced as that of last year. Their

Almost the identical problem of a
year ago again confronts the Cardinal
Varsity, with conditions at Stanford
somewhat changed, however. Last
year fourteen Blue and Gold veterans
faced the Cardinal. This year four
teen again faces Stanford, but three
of theae were substitutes last fall.
Notwithstanding this, the situation is a
grave one. One weakness alone is to
be found in the California team and
that is at full. Price and Bogardns
are the candidates for this place.
Price sprang into the limelight by his
clever work with the California team
in their games with Victoria during
the Christmas holidays a year ago.
Bogardus, however, has made the best
showing this year, having played on
his Freshman team during their season
and, until recently, substituting for
Price. By his showing against the
British Columbia team last Saturday
he practically cinched the fullback
position.
Heavy Eight-Man Scrunu
Carpenter and the Phleger brothers
form the front rank. The Phlegers
are hard workers, effective hookers
and blockers. The middle rankers,
Hardy and Hansen, form the giant
center duo. They are sturdy players
but lack the brilliancy of Dole in the
lineouts. Hardy is a good booter and
is used for difficult conversions.
Swartz and Pauly form a breakaway
pair that is hard to beat. They are
speedy and sure. Both of these men
can handle the ball on a passing com
bine, like backs. Pauly is, perhaps,
the star of the pack, and is a factor
that must be reckoned with at all the
stages of the game. King, at lock,
completing the rear-rank trio, holds
them well together.
The forwards as a whole are fast
in following up. In the working of
the scrum they are adepts. Quick to
heel out and to screw the scrum, using
to good advantage all the allowed
methods of blocking their opponents
when they try to break through. On
the lineouts they are not so sure.
Seemingly unable to make the most of
getting i!]) after the ball and snapping
it out to their waiting backs. Though
when the ball gets into their hands
they are quick to form around it and
use their feet.
Morris Net Infallible.
Morris heads the backfleld as the
scrum half. He is quick at getting
the ball to his backs, handling it
easily in whatever way it. is heeled out
to him. He is not infallible, however,
and is subject to occasional slumps.
Captain Elliott plays the first five, but
mi t i last, Saturday he did not come up
i i his reputation of previous years on
the gridiron. Tin is a good touch finder
for distance, and when playing at par
if always on deck. At second live,
Stroud is a strong passing unit and
a clever dolger through the loose
Allen and Pert nre slated for, th"
center and wing positions. Both of
these men at-e df* small stature but
are wonderfully quick on the aggres
sive and are able to kick effectively
when there is need. All of these backs
ar:» the ve'ernns of last year's Var
sity. Elliott and Stroud were :il«o o-<
the 1909 Varsity, the others were sub
stitutes in 1909. Whatever may be
their .shortcomings in the preliminary
games they are formidable factors
when the intercollegiate struggle is on
tV boards.
