# INTERNATIONAL RUGBY PLAYED HERE TOMORROW
## VARSITY MEETS THE CANADIANS AT 4. Canadians Excel in Dribbling, Tackling, and Kicking, But Are Weak In Passing. 
### 
Coming from a distance of over a
thousand miles, the British Columbia
Rugby "All-Stars" will meet the Stan
ford Varsity tomorrow afternoon, at
4 o'clock, for the first of a two game
series to be played here, the second
match coming on Saturday. In former
years the Canadians have been con
tent to pit the team of Vancouver or
Victoria against the universities on
the Pacific Coast, but now the Rugby
i Unions of these two cities have com
| bined to send a fifteen for the games
i here.
The visitors have brought a team
j that plays a brilliant and spectacular
game. From the scores that Califor
j nia were able to chalk up against
! them, however, they should not be able
to take a victory from the Cardinals.
In the two games across the bay last
week the Blue and Gold took both, the
first, 21 to 0; and the second, 24-0.
Canadians Good Dribblers.
The visitors are expert in advanc
i ing the ball with their feet, carrying
I the leather oval at their toe points
through the loose almost as effectively
jas in their hands. In fact, in this
department of play the Canadians have
reached a high point of perfection.
Their one weakness is the passing
between their backs, and, but for
i their brilliance in all the other de
j partments of play they would be swept
i off their feet.
Effective kicking is featured con
| stantly by the visitors. All the Cana
i dians are proficient in this, finding
: the furtherest possible touch and
I using either foot at will. At cross
, kicking they are not so skilled as the
j Americans, however. Tackling is
; another of their strong points and they
I tackle hard, seldom missing their
J mark. They have a trio of front
I rankers who are adept at heeling the
; ball out of the scrum and the local
j hookers will have to hustle to break
' even with them.
Blue and Gold Hard Pressed.
The scores that California rolled up
; against the Beaver-shirted-men does
! not indicate how close that the Blue
! and Gold were pressed, time and time
I again, throughout the game. The
i visitors held a tight defense, for long
! time periods, close to their backline,
and only after repeated hammerings
against their wall was a loophole
I finally opened.
For the visitors, Watkins and Mc-
Guigan are the stars. Watkins is one
of the halves and is a fast follower-up.
• He is especially good when heading a
dribbling rush, and excels at tackling,
j YTcGuigan is on the three-quarters
line at a point corresponding to our
wing. He is the best handler of the
hall on tho lino and has a long boot.
Erb, Kern Exchange Places.
, An interesting change is to be made
! i'i the Cardinal backfield. Erb and
j Kern are slated to exchange places.
Erb will play a wing and Kern is
advanced to center. The developments
| here should be interesting. Risling
; will again take full. Noble is slated
; for second five. Saturday he was
under fire at this position and played
well. In the practices this week he
has shown an added improvement and
is fast proving a strong unit in the
handling of the ball. Geissler, who
has been out of togs on account of
an ulcerated tooth, returns to fill his
old berth.
The line-ups are.

Partridge, Watkins, Woodcock, Gard,
Schaupp, forwards; Cass, half; Harri
gan, Noble, fives; Kern, center; Geis
sler, Erb, wings; Risling, full.

Victoria against the universities on
the Pacific Coast, but now the Rugby
i Unions of these two cities have com
| bined to send a fifteen for the games
i here.
The visitors have brought a team
j that plays a brilliant and spectacular
game. From the scores that Califor
j nia were able to chalk up against
! them, however, they should not be able
to take a victory from the Cardinals.
In the two games across the bay last
week the Blue and Gold took both, the
first, 21 to 0; and the second, 24-0.
Canadians Good Dribblers.
The visitors are expert in advanc
i ing the ball with their feet, carrying
I the leather oval at their toe points
through the loose almost as effectively
jas in their hands. In fact, in this
department of play the Canadians have
reached a high point of perfection.
Their one weakness is the passing
between their backs, and, but for
i their brilliance in all the other de
j partments of play they would be swept
i off their feet.
Effective kicking is featured con
| stantly by the visitors. All the Cana
i dians are proficient in this, finding
: the furtherest possible touch and
I using either foot at will. At cross
, kicking they are not so skilled as the
j Americans, however. Tackling is
; another of their strong points and they
I tackle hard, seldom missing their
J mark. They have a trio of front
I rankers who are adept at heeling the
; ball out of the scrum and the local
j hookers will have to hustle to break
' even with them.
Blue and Gold Hard Pressed.
The scores that California rolled up
; against the Beaver-shirted-men does
! not indicate how close that the Blue
! and Gold were pressed, time and time
I again, throughout the game. The
i visitors held a tight defense, for long
! time periods, close to their backline,
and only after repeated hammerings
against their wall was a loophole
I finally opened.
For the visitors, Watkins and Mc-
Guigan are the stars. Watkins is one
of the halves and is a fast follower-up.
• He is especially good when heading a
dribbling rush, and excels at tackling,
j YTcGuigan is on the three-quarters
line at a point corresponding to our
wing. He is the best handler of the
hall on tho lino and has a long boot.
Erb, Kern Exchange Places.
, An interesting change is to be made
! i'i the Cardinal backfield. Erb and
j Kern are slated to exchange places.
Erb will play a wing and Kern is
advanced to center. The developments
| here should be interesting. Risling
; will again take full. Noble is slated
; for second five. Saturday he was
under fire at this position and played
well. In the practices this week he
has shown an added improvement and
is fast proving a strong unit in the
handling of the ball. Geissler, who
has been out of togs on account of
an ulcerated tooth, returns to fill his
old berth.
The line-ups are.
Varsity—Corbett, Sanborn, Haley,
Partridge, Watkins, Woodcock, Gard,
Schaupp, forwards; Cass, half; Harri
gan, Noble, fives; Kern, center; Geis
sler, Erb, wings; Risling, full.
Canadians —Ackland, Smith, Straker.
Holroyd, Miller, Sweeney, Durant,
Jeffs, forwards; Newcombe, Watkins,
halves; McGuigan, Stoess, Vincent,
Vincent, Dean, three-quarters; John
son, full.
Coming from a distance of over a
thousand miles, the British Columbia
Rugby "All-Stars" will meet the Stan
ford Varsity tomorrow afternoon, at
4 o'clock, for the first of a two game
series to be played here, the second
match coming on Saturday. In former
