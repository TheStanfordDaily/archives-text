# Rugby and American Football.

Here is an editorial writer who has
either never seen a game of rugby, or

is grouping all
"injuries in foot
ball" under one
head and not

giving the "sane game" credit for its
comparatively few and seldom serious
hurts.
Writing in the San Jose Mercury of
yesterday morning in a leading article
under the title "High School Football,"
this writer says: "It is a good indica
tion of rising Western standards of
culture that both Berkeley and Stan
ford will shortly follow the lead of
older Eastern universities and intro
duce golf as a substitute for the pace
killing, rough-and-tumble brutality of
football. In the Scottish game no
muscle escapes, the lungs are expand
ed, narrow shoulders are widened, and
the physique made powerful without
the danger of wrecking it for life."
In the first place the Eastern uni
versities are not introducing golf as
a substitute for football, and Stanford
and California are not, therefore, fol
lowing their "lead." In the next place
rugby, as played in the west, cannot
possibly be compared with football in
the east. There may be "pace-killing
brutality" there, but, certainly, such a
charge cannot be applied to rugby.
No more sane, healthful, and compara
tively harmless sport could be found.
It strikes the middle place between
that same golf and the injurious
American football. It is neither a
"pink tea" game nor war.
Injuries in rugby are few, and when
they do occur, are seldom long-con
tinuing in their effects. Added to this
advantage, there are the many fea
tures of the games which place it, in
our opinion, far ahead of American
football. Where in the "old game"
can be found necessary the skill that
is needed by the fast-flying rugby
backs in executing a long distance
kick in mid-air? Where is there any
thing ,.in the old > game to equal the
skill and beauty, of precision in the
perfect passing rush. Rugby is a
"sane" game, and at the same time
is not in the mollycoddle class. It
combines safety with all the excite
ment and training needed that appeals
to the players and to the spectators.
American football is being constant
ly revised, a»id is fighting for its life
in every part of the United States. At
a half dozen different institutions the
game has been abolished because of
injuries to players resulting in death.
We ask the newspapers and the San
Jose Merciiry to make some.' distinc
tion when using the term "football.
We Need the Union.
