# Erb and Kern Change Places.
## 
### 
Coach Presley put the Cardinal
backs through their workout yester
day afternoon. Kicking for touch,
dropping on the ball to check a drib
bling rush and passing rushes, started
from the scrum, was the order of their
practice.
An interesting change was made by
Coach Presley in switching Erb and
Kern. In -the passing bouts Erb was
Geissler's mate at wing and Kern
played at center.
The forwards were coached in scrum
work, lineouts and dribbling by J. O.
Miller.
