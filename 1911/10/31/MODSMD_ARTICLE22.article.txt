# Canadian Stars on Campus.
## 
### 
The Canadians are here. The squad
of husky British Columbia athletes
arrived yesterday, and were assigned
quarters at Encina and the houses
along the row.
The visitors indulged in light prac
tice on the turf yesterday afternoon,
confining themselves to running, pass
ing, and dribbling. This was their
first introduction to Stanford field, and
they expressed themselves as more
than delighted with the turf as a play
ing surface. Their second practice,
which was of a more thorough nature,
was held this morning on the turf.
