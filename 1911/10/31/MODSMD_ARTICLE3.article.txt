# ROOTING PRACTICE ON BLEACHERS TO-MORROW
## Only Four More Bleacher Practices to Be Held Before Intercollegiate Rugby Game. 
### 
Rooters' practice for the Big Game
will begin in earnest to-morrow at the
Vancouver match. It is \irged by the
Yell Leaders that all men be in the
bleachers to-morrow by 3:30 o'clock,
so that a thorough song and yell prac
tice can be held.
As there are no new songs or yells
this year, it is hoped by Yell Leader
S. C. Kennedy '12, to have the old
ones given perfectly. He said, "It is
absolutely necessary that every man
who expects to sit in the rooters' sec
tion at the Big Game on November 11,
should be present at the four remain
ing bleacher practices, to be held to
morrow and Saturday, and next week
Tuesday and Thursday.
G. N. Richardson '09, a former yell
leader, who observed the rooting from
the opposite side of the field last Sat
urday at the Stanford-Olympic game,
said, "The yelling is good, but in the
rendering of the songs the words
cannot be heard."
