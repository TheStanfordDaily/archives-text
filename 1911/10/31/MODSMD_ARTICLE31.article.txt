ball championship has resolved itself
into a three-cornered struggle between
Chicago, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.
At the opening of the season Minne
sota was doped as the easy winners
of the title, but injuries and ineligi
bilities have practically destroyed the
Gophers' chances. Wisconsin has
come back strong in the last two
weeks, and is the present favorite.

One of the greatest athletes of mod
ern times has been developed at the
Carlisle Indian School, in the person
of James Thorp. He can play any
position on the diamond, but is an
exceptionally good pitcher. He puts
the shot 43 feet, broad jumps 22feet,
10 inches, runs the hundred in 10
fiat, high jumps 6 feet, and negotiates
the high hurdle's in 15 4-5 seconds. He
is a crack basketball player, a good
rifle shot and an expert in tennis, la
crosse, handball and hockey, but as
a football star he is seen at his best.
Thorp is 22 years old, 6 feet tall, and
weighs 178.
