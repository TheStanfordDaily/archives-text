With Price out of the game there
is doubt as to who will occupy the
position of fullback. Bogardus, the
freshman, seems the most likely can
didate. A report is prevalent that
Evans will play at wing and Peart at
full.

The coaching force of California is
composed of "Jimmie" Schaeffer, Ced
ric Cerf and Walter Christy. Schaeffer
is the head coach and has turned out
victorious teams for the Blue and
Gold after five successive defeats. At
present he is confining his attentions
principally to the forwards. Cerf is
an assistant coach and played half on
the 1909 Varsity which won the Inter
collegiate game that year for the first
time in six years. Christy is the Cali
fornia trainer but he is also helping
to round the team into shape.
