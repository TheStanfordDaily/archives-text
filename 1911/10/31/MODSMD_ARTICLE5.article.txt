# FALL CREW TRAINING WILL BEGIN THURSDAY
## CAPTAIN SEWARD ISSUES CALL FOR OARSMEN. Light Training Will be the Order of Work.â€”New Shell Will Arrive Soon. 
### 
Fall crew training, for Stanford
oarsmen, will be started Thursday
afternoon at 4:45. At this time the
men who intend to come out for places
in the Cardinal boats, will sign up at
the Boat house on Lake Lagunita.
Exception is made, however, to those
who are out for football. The prelim
inary work will be of a light nature
and will be intended especially for
Freshmen. All who expect to come
out next spring are urged to report
now, as the fall training will be of
great benefit later. The first year
crew will be an eight as was the case
last season.
The early training will consist in
cross country runs, setting up exer
cises and working on the rowing
machines in the gymnasium. After
the football season is over the Var
sity men will make trips to Redwood
City two or three times a week, for
light workouts on the bay.
Two-Fold Purpose.
The idea of beginning fall training
at this juncture is for a two-fold pur
pose. In the first place, the light exer
cise will gradually tone the oarsmen
I) for the hard work of next semester
and put them in mid-season condi
ion. Secondly, by accomplishing the
preliminary work now, regular train
ing can be begun early next January
without any loss of time.
Crew Captain R. T-L Seward '12, has
not as yet decided upon the number of
times a week training will be held.
\nnouncement of this is to be made
later. He has requested that all those
who report Thursday bring their suits
if possible. The coaching system of
the past two years, that of a student
coaching committee, will be used again
this season. The personnel of the
committee will be given out later.
Stanford will boast of a complete
equipment of four boats when the new
$500 purchase arrives in December.
At present the first and second Var
sity rowers each have a shell and the
remaining boat is allotted to the first
year aspirants.

To welcome President Jordan
home an Assembly will be held
to-morrow morning, during the
10:15 and 11:15 periods. Dr.
Jordan will address the stu
dents on the interesting and
important events of his jour
ney. K. L. Sehaupp '12, Presi
dent of the Student Body, will
give iiu address of welcome to
Dr. Jordan. The Stanford Band
