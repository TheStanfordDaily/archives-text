dinal are determined to break this
string of California victories. The
Blue and Gold team is composed of
ore experienced men, but Stanford

Hard To Get Judges.

bate have not as yet been choosen but
the selection will be announced in a
day or so. The committee which has
the naming of officials in hand are
experiencing difficulty in getting
judges, because of the fact that most

cussed. The question for debate is
that of the judiciary recall.
