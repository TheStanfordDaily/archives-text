# PRESIDENT JORDAN TELLS OF TRIP TO THE ORIENT
## University Head Delivers Splendid Address Before Big Assembly This Morning.—Characterizes War Scares as Lies. 
### 
"True patriotism has nothing to do
with the martial spirit. To respond
to the drum is not patriotism. The
patriot is not a soldier of fortune.
The patriot is the man who loves his
country, who believes in what his na
tion stands for, and who will give
his life, if necessary, that his nation
may stand for righteousness. The
martial spirit belongs to the mediae
val world, when fighting was the chief
business of men, and when plunder
was the chief motive for fighting. The
growth of science, the development of
invention, the spread of religion are
all bound up in the maintenance of
peace. Virility depends on struggle,
the struggle against the evils of the
world and the conditions of life. It
is in no way dependent on drums and
flags, nor on the killing of men, either
individually or collectively. War was
once universal. We have driven it to
the boundaries of nations. We have
made it illegal everywhere else. We
have made it so costly that its con
tinuance means national ruin. The
whole world is still paying the bills
incurred by Napoleon, Bismarck, and
the grafting adventurers of the
Orient. Just as baronial wars, reli
gious wars, feudal wars, inquisitions,
crusades and coats of mail vanished
when people saw them with clear
vision, so international wars will come
to an end, all of a sudden, when people
see them as they are. That time has
now come, and only the money that is
in it to builders and promoters keeps
alive the standing armies and the
navies of today.—David Starr Jordan.
"All war talk between the United
States and Japan is the malicious gos
sip of either fools or knaves," Thus
President David Starr Jordan briefly
summarized the relations existing at
the present time between these two
great world powers in his significant
address before the University this
morning.
The Assembly was a splendid one.
The hall was packed with students,
faculty and visitors who came to hear
America's foremost advocate of peace
tell of his impressions of Japan after
a seven weeks intimate visit in the
land of the Mikado.
As. a welcome to Dr. Jordan the
Assembly was a marked success.
When the President of the University
appeared on the platform with Acting
President Brannner, and Student Body
President K. L. Schaupp '12, the au
dience broke out into spontaneous a;>-
plau.e such as is seldom heard in
the Assembly Kail. Back and forth,
ri-in v and falling, it thundered forth
its welcome to the President who re
turner! to the University a greater
wcrld-fisure and world-mind than ever
before.
Preceding the arrival of the speak
ers on the stage the big audience in
dulged in yells and songs, and listen
ed to several selections by the band.
The (Jlee Club was also heard in sev
eral numbers.
Dr. Branner, as chairman for the
day, announced that the Faculty had
expressed their welcome to Dr. Jor
dan individually and collectively on
other occasions since his return. It
remained for the students to express
their appreciation through their Pre
sident.
S«'lisiii |t|» Welcomes President,
Schaupp spoke in part as follows:
"It is not necessary for me to say
that we are glad to see you hack
As president of the Student Body I
have been asked to express our wel
come to you. We appreciate the work
which you have been doing not only
for this University but for the world
in general.

"I can report to you that the con
dition that exists now in the Student
Body and between them and the Fa
culty was never better. All looked
to tiiis semester with some fear as to
its outcome. That fear has been
shown to be without foundation. The
days of conflict between Faculty and
student are past. It is not good to
look too far into the future or back
Into the past. We are living in the
present and it is to the present we
must look.
"No University can be great without
making some sacrifices. We gave up
the Freshman game not so much be
cause we wanted to as because we had
to. Now we want to meet the mem
bers of the Faculty on an equal foot
ing—on a common plane. We feel
that we are getting toward the point
of co-operation. I hope the future
will bear me out when I say that we
look forward to a more prosperous
time for Stanford that she has ever
seen."
President Jordan Speaks.
"I needn't say I am glad to get
home,'' said Dr. Jordan when he rose
to speak, "even though I am not here.
I am at present officially represented
in Boston. Since 190 Git has been my
duty to travel some 25,000 miles every
year on other people's business. In
that time I have been gratified that
the University goes along better dur
ing the times when I am not here than
when I am here.
"I am gratified to see that you elect,
and have elected for some years, men
as president of your Student Body who
are fit to be president of anything.
"I want the students to realize that
there never was a time when there
was such a Golden Age at Stanford.
At present we have the best men that
have ever been here, they are getting
the best instruction that Stanford men
ever got, and they are graduating
with the best preparation for life work j
that Stanford men ever had.
"Every • University has a system of
customs and traditions which repre
sent the attitude of the average of
] the student body. The Faculty of
Stanford realize that this system is
good. They will let it run just as
far as is good so long as the honor or
good name of the university is not
affected.
Purposes of Japanese Trip.
"I went over to Japan partly at the
invitation of the numerous and thriv
ing peace socities there, and partly
: because I wanted to know what the
Japanese people are thinking and say
ing in regard to the great matter of
international peace. I wanted to add
I a little bit to the public opinion
against war and the putting of money
j into armaments. Armaments are not
| protection but are means of getting
up war scares and making people buy
i more armaments.
"International war has played out
because of its expensiveness. Civil
wars still continue to exist and will
so continue until all the nations have
j a truly representative and democratic
i form of government. The people in
I China prefer a civil war to having
their heads cut off in bundles of one
hundred. Turkey has long since been
bankrupt. She must realize on her
! assets. She owes over one-fourth of
I her wealth to the "Unseen Empire" of
' the Rothschilds. It is an unwritten
j law of nations that they cannot sell
j their assets until after a war. This
is the cause of the war in Tripoli, as
near as I can judge.
The speaker next dwelt upon the
many beauties of Japan, declaring
that in many ways it is the most lovely
country in the world. He told of the
good-natured attitude toward all I
things of the Japanese, of their muni
ficence, and politeness.
"The trouble with the adverse re
ports which travellers bring home
from Japan," he continued, "is that
they are taken only from one point
of view. In any place if one wishes
to they can hear anything about any
thing. That is the trouble with the
reports from Japan."
President Meets Mikado.
After telling of many interesting J
i Japanese customs and speaking of a
tremendous meeting which he address
ed in Osaka, the President told of
his audience with the Emperor of
Japan.
"I was invited," he said, "to meet
the Emperor through his representa
tives. The Mikado's residence is a
large palace in the general fashion of
the better Japanese houses. I came
to the palace with the American
charge de affaires in the absence of
the minister. As is the custom, we
took off our shoes at the door of the
palace and donned slippers. On gen
era] principles I took off my glasses
and found later that T had done the
right thing. There are only two rules
in meeting the Emperor. The first !
of them is to take your cue from his j
speech and the second is not to turn
I your hack. T found the Emperor to be
j a quiet person with apparently an
, unusual amount of sense. One would
[ consider him a very excellent person
! were he not an emperor. T also met
! the Empress. They are two of the
: really good people in the world, ir
respective of their positions."
After discussing the condition in ;
fovea as it exists at the present time
and telling of the causes of the Russo-
Japanese war, Dr. Jordan concluded
by discussing the attitude of Japan to
ward the United States.
"All war talk between the United
' States and Japan is the malicious gos
; sip of either fools or knaves," he said,
j "It is the desire of certain men to
boost the armament business, or else
a certain desire to find something to
| do with the warships. The Japanese
do not want to fight anybody. They
| are as peaceful as any civilized na-
I tion.
Three Elements in Friendship.
"Three elements enter into their
! friendship with the United States.
[ They love America distinctly. The
United States is Japan's nearest

friend. Sometimes the conditions are
a little estranged, but it is not for
long. In the second place Japan is
trying to do one thing and one thing
only, and that is on the continent of
Asia with relation to Corea. She is
playing for big stakes there. In the
third place one-fifth of her total
wealth of seven thousand million dol
lars is covered by her tremendous war
debt. Unless Japan is forced to the
wall she cannot raise money for an
international war.
"The bond brokerage house of
Rothschild is the most powerful na
tional factor in the world. They will
loan no money for two big nations to
go to war but only for one big nation
to gobble a smaller one or a civilized
one to grab a barbarous one."
"True patriotism has nothing to do
with the martial spirit. To respond
to the drum is not patriotism. The
patriot is not a soldier of fortune.
The patriot is the man who loves his
country, who believes in what his na
tion stands for, and who will give

sip of either fools or knaves," Thus
President David Starr Jordan briefly
summarized the relations existing at
the present time between these two
great world powers in his significant
address before the University this
morning.
The Assembly was a splendid one.
The hall was packed with students,
faculty and visitors who came to hear
America's foremost advocate of peace
tell of his impressions of Japan after
a seven weeks intimate visit in the
land of the Mikado.
As. a welcome to Dr. Jordan the
Assembly was a marked success.
When the President of the University
appeared on the platform with Acting
President Brannner, and Student Body
President K. L. Schaupp '12, the au
dience broke out into spontaneous a;>-
plau.e such as is seldom heard in
the Assembly Kail. Back and forth,
ri-in v and falling, it thundered forth
its welcome to the President who re
turner! to the University a greater
wcrld-fisure and world-mind than ever
before.
Preceding the arrival of the speak
ers on the stage the big audience in
dulged in yells and songs, and listen
ed to several selections by the band.
The (Jlee Club was also heard in sev
eral numbers.
Dr. Branner, as chairman for the
day, announced that the Faculty had
expressed their welcome to Dr. Jor
dan individually and collectively on
other occasions since his return. It
remained for the students to express
their appreciation through their Pre
sident.
S«'lisiii |t|» Welcomes President,
Schaupp spoke in part as follows:
"It is not necessary for me to say
that we are glad to see you hack
As president of the Student Body I
have been asked to express our wel
come to you. We appreciate the work
which you have been doing not only
for this University but for the world
in general.

"I can report to you that the con
dition that exists now in the Student
Body and between them and the Fa
culty was never better. All looked
to tiiis semester with some fear as to
its outcome. That fear has been
shown to be without foundation. The
days of conflict between Faculty and
student are past. It is not good to
look too far into the future or back
Into the past. We are living in the
present and it is to the present we
must look.
"No University can be great without
making some sacrifices. We gave up
the Freshman game not so much be
cause we wanted to as because we had
to. Now we want to meet the mem
bers of the Faculty on an equal foot
ing—on a common plane. We feel
that we are getting toward the point
of co-operation. I hope the future
will bear me out when I say that we
look forward to a more prosperous
time for Stanford that she has ever
seen."
President Jordan Speaks.
"I needn't say I am glad to get
home,'' said Dr. Jordan when he rose
to speak, "even though I am not here.
I am at present officially represented
in Boston. Since 190 Git has been my
duty to travel some 25,000 miles every
year on other people's business. In
that time I have been gratified that
the University goes along better dur
ing the times when I am not here than
when I am here.
"I am gratified to see that you elect,
and have elected for some years, men
as president of your Student Body who
are fit to be president of anything.
"I want the students to realize that
there never was a time when there
was such a Golden Age at Stanford.
At present we have the best men that
have ever been here, they are getting
the best instruction that Stanford men
ever got, and they are graduating
with the best preparation for life work j
that Stanford men ever had.
"Every • University has a system of
customs and traditions which repre
sent the attitude of the average of
] the student body. The Faculty of
Stanford realize that this system is
good. They will let it run just as
far as is good so long as the honor or
good name of the university is not
affected.
Purposes of Japanese Trip.
"I went over to Japan partly at the
invitation of the numerous and thriv
ing peace socities there, and partly
: because I wanted to know what the
Japanese people are thinking and say
ing in regard to the great matter of
international peace. I wanted to add
I a little bit to the public opinion
against war and the putting of money
j into armaments. Armaments are not
| protection but are means of getting
up war scares and making people buy
i more armaments.
"International war has played out
because of its expensiveness. Civil
wars still continue to exist and will
so continue until all the nations have
j a truly representative and democratic
i form of government. The people in
I China prefer a civil war to having
their heads cut off in bundles of one
hundred. Turkey has long since been
bankrupt. She must realize on her
! assets. She owes over one-fourth of
I her wealth to the "Unseen Empire" of
' the Rothschilds. It is an unwritten
j law of nations that they cannot sell
j their assets until after a war. This
is the cause of the war in Tripoli, as
near as I can judge.
The speaker next dwelt upon the
many beauties of Japan, declaring
that in many ways it is the most lovely
country in the world. He told of the
good-natured attitude toward all I
things of the Japanese, of their muni
ficence, and politeness.
"The trouble with the adverse re
ports which travellers bring home
from Japan," he continued, "is that
they are taken only from one point
of view. In any place if one wishes
to they can hear anything about any
thing. That is the trouble with the
reports from Japan."
President Meets Mikado.
After telling of many interesting J
i Japanese customs and speaking of a
tremendous meeting which he address
ed in Osaka, the President told of
his audience with the Emperor of
Japan.
"I was invited," he said, "to meet
the Emperor through his representa
tives. The Mikado's residence is a
large palace in the general fashion of
the better Japanese houses. I came
to the palace with the American
charge de affaires in the absence of
the minister. As is the custom, we
took off our shoes at the door of the
palace and donned slippers. On gen
era] principles I took off my glasses
and found later that T had done the
right thing. There are only two rules
in meeting the Emperor. The first !
of them is to take your cue from his j
speech and the second is not to turn
I your hack. T found the Emperor to be
j a quiet person with apparently an
, unusual amount of sense. One would
[ consider him a very excellent person
! were he not an emperor. T also met
! the Empress. They are two of the
: really good people in the world, ir
respective of their positions."
After discussing the condition in ;
fovea as it exists at the present time
and telling of the causes of the Russo-
Japanese war, Dr. Jordan concluded
by discussing the attitude of Japan to
ward the United States.
"All war talk between the United
' States and Japan is the malicious gos
; sip of either fools or knaves," he said,
j "It is the desire of certain men to
boost the armament business, or else
a certain desire to find something to
| do with the warships. The Japanese
do not want to fight anybody. They
| are as peaceful as any civilized na-
I tion.
Three Elements in Friendship.
"Three elements enter into their
! friendship with the United States.
[ They love America distinctly. The
United States is Japan's nearest

friend. Sometimes the conditions are
a little estranged, but it is not for
long. In the second place Japan is
trying to do one thing and one thing
only, and that is on the continent of
Asia with relation to Corea. She is
playing for big stakes there. In the
third place one-fifth of her total
wealth of seven thousand million dol
lars is covered by her tremendous war
debt. Unless Japan is forced to the
wall she cannot raise money for an
international war.
"The bond brokerage house of
Rothschild is the most powerful na
tional factor in the world. They will
loan no money for two big nations to
go to war but only for one big nation
to gobble a smaller one or a civilized
one to grab a barbarous one."
"True patriotism has nothing to do
with the martial spirit. To respond
to the drum is not patriotism. The
patriot is not a soldier of fortune.
The patriot is the man who loves his
country, who believes in what his na
tion stands for, and who will give
his life, if necessary, that his nation
may stand for righteousness. The
martial spirit belongs to the mediae
val world, when fighting was the chief
business of men, and when plunder
was the chief motive for fighting. The
growth of science, the development of
invention, the spread of religion are
all bound up in the maintenance of
peace. Virility depends on struggle,
the struggle against the evils of the
world and the conditions of life. It
is in no way dependent on drums and
flags, nor on the killing of men, either
individually or collectively. War was
once universal. We have driven it to
the boundaries of nations. We have
made it illegal everywhere else. We
have made it so costly that its con
tinuance means national ruin. The
whole world is still paying the bills
incurred by Napoleon, Bismarck, and
the grafting adventurers of the
Orient. Just as baronial wars, reli
gious wars, feudal wars, inquisitions,
crusades and coats of mail vanished
when people saw them with clear
vision, so international wars will come
to an end, all of a sudden, when people
see them as they are. That time has
now come, and only the money that is
in it to builders and promoters keeps
alive the standing armies and the
navies of today.—David Starr Jordan.

come to you. We appreciate the work
which you have been doing not only
for this University but for the world
in general.

"I can report to you that the con
dition that exists now in the Student
Body and between them and the Fa
culty was never better. All looked
to tiiis semester with some fear as to
its outcome. That fear has been
shown to be without foundation. The
days of conflict between Faculty and
student are past. It is not good to
look too far into the future or back
Into the past. We are living in the
present and it is to the present we
must look.
"No University can be great without
making some sacrifices. We gave up
the Freshman game not so much be
cause we wanted to as because we had
to. Now we want to meet the mem
bers of the Faculty on an equal foot
ing—on a common plane. We feel
that we are getting toward the point
of co-operation. I hope the future
will bear me out when I say that we
look forward to a more prosperous
time for Stanford that she has ever
seen."
President Jordan Speaks.
"I needn't say I am glad to get
home,'' said Dr. Jordan when he rose
to speak, "even though I am not here.
I am at present officially represented
in Boston. Since 190 Git has been my
duty to travel some 25,000 miles every
year on other people's business. In
that time I have been gratified that
the University goes along better dur
ing the times when I am not here than
when I am here.
"I am gratified to see that you elect,
and have elected for some years, men
as president of your Student Body who
are fit to be president of anything.
"I want the students to realize that
there never was a time when there
was such a Golden Age at Stanford.
At present we have the best men that
have ever been here, they are getting
the best instruction that Stanford men
ever got, and they are graduating
with the best preparation for life work j
that Stanford men ever had.
"Every • University has a system of
customs and traditions which repre
sent the attitude of the average of
] the student body. The Faculty of
Stanford realize that this system is
good. They will let it run just as
far as is good so long as the honor or
good name of the university is not
affected.
Purposes of Japanese Trip.
"I went over to Japan partly at the
invitation of the numerous and thriv
ing peace socities there, and partly
: because I wanted to know what the
Japanese people are thinking and say
ing in regard to the great matter of
international peace. I wanted to add
I a little bit to the public opinion
against war and the putting of money
j into armaments. Armaments are not
| protection but are means of getting
up war scares and making people buy
i more armaments.
"International war has played out
because of its expensiveness. Civil
wars still continue to exist and will
so continue until all the nations have
j a truly representative and democratic
i form of government. The people in
I China prefer a civil war to having
their heads cut off in bundles of one
hundred. Turkey has long since been
bankrupt. She must realize on her
! assets. She owes over one-fourth of
I her wealth to the "Unseen Empire" of
' the Rothschilds. It is an unwritten
j law of nations that they cannot sell
j their assets until after a war. This
is the cause of the war in Tripoli, as
near as I can judge.
The speaker next dwelt upon the
many beauties of Japan, declaring
that in many ways it is the most lovely
country in the world. He told of the
good-natured attitude toward all I
things of the Japanese, of their muni
ficence, and politeness.
"The trouble with the adverse re
ports which travellers bring home
from Japan," he continued, "is that
they are taken only from one point
of view. In any place if one wishes
to they can hear anything about any
thing. That is the trouble with the
reports from Japan."
President Meets Mikado.
After telling of many interesting J
i Japanese customs and speaking of a
tremendous meeting which he address
ed in Osaka, the President told of
his audience with the Emperor of
Japan.
"I was invited," he said, "to meet
the Emperor through his representa
tives. The Mikado's residence is a
large palace in the general fashion of
the better Japanese houses. I came
to the palace with the American
charge de affaires in the absence of
the minister. As is the custom, we
took off our shoes at the door of the
palace and donned slippers. On gen
era] principles I took off my glasses
and found later that T had done the
right thing. There are only two rules
in meeting the Emperor. The first !
of them is to take your cue from his j
speech and the second is not to turn
I your hack. T found the Emperor to be
j a quiet person with apparently an
, unusual amount of sense. One would
[ consider him a very excellent person
! were he not an emperor. T also met
! the Empress. They are two of the
: really good people in the world, ir
respective of their positions."
After discussing the condition in ;
fovea as it exists at the present time
and telling of the causes of the Russo-
Japanese war, Dr. Jordan concluded
by discussing the attitude of Japan to
ward the United States.
"All war talk between the United
' States and Japan is the malicious gos
; sip of either fools or knaves," he said,
j "It is the desire of certain men to
boost the armament business, or else
a certain desire to find something to
| do with the warships. The Japanese
do not want to fight anybody. They
| are as peaceful as any civilized na-
I tion.
Three Elements in Friendship.
"Three elements enter into their
! friendship with the United States.
[ They love America distinctly. The
United States is Japan's nearest

friend. Sometimes the conditions are
a little estranged, but it is not for
long. In the second place Japan is
trying to do one thing and one thing
only, and that is on the continent of
Asia with relation to Corea. She is
playing for big stakes there. In the
third place one-fifth of her total
wealth of seven thousand million dol
lars is covered by her tremendous war
debt. Unless Japan is forced to the
wall she cannot raise money for an
international war.
"The bond brokerage house of
Rothschild is the most powerful na
tional factor in the world. They will
loan no money for two big nations to
go to war but only for one big nation
to gobble a smaller one or a civilized
one to grab a barbarous one."
"True patriotism has nothing to do
with the martial spirit. To respond
to the drum is not patriotism. The
patriot is not a soldier of fortune.
The patriot is the man who loves his
country, who believes in what his na
tion stands for, and who will give
his life, if necessary, that his nation
may stand for righteousness. The
martial spirit belongs to the mediae
val world, when fighting was the chief
business of men, and when plunder
was the chief motive for fighting. The
growth of science, the development of
invention, the spread of religion are
all bound up in the maintenance of
peace. Virility depends on struggle,
the struggle against the evils of the
world and the conditions of life. It
is in no way dependent on drums and
flags, nor on the killing of men, either
individually or collectively. War was
once universal. We have driven it to
the boundaries of nations. We have
made it illegal everywhere else. We
have made it so costly that its con
tinuance means national ruin. The
whole world is still paying the bills
incurred by Napoleon, Bismarck, and
the grafting adventurers of the
Orient. Just as baronial wars, reli
gious wars, feudal wars, inquisitions,
crusades and coats of mail vanished
when people saw them with clear
vision, so international wars will come
to an end, all of a sudden, when people
see them as they are. That time has
now come, and only the money that is
in it to builders and promoters keeps
alive the standing armies and the
navies of today.—David Starr Jordan.
"All war talk between the United
States and Japan is the malicious gos
sip of either fools or knaves," Thus
President David Starr Jordan briefly
summarized the relations existing at
the present time between these two
great world powers in his significant
address before the University this
morning.
The Assembly was a splendid one.
The hall was packed with students,
faculty and visitors who came to hear
America's foremost advocate of peace
tell of his impressions of Japan after
a seven weeks intimate visit in the
land of the Mikado.
As. a welcome to Dr. Jordan the
Assembly was a marked success.
When the President of the University
appeared on the platform with Acting
President Brannner, and Student Body
President K. L. Schaupp '12, the au
dience broke out into spontaneous a;>-
plau.e such as is seldom heard in
the Assembly Kail. Back and forth,
ri-in v and falling, it thundered forth
its welcome to the President who re
turner! to the University a greater
wcrld-fisure and world-mind than ever
before.
Preceding the arrival of the speak
ers on the stage the big audience in
dulged in yells and songs, and listen
ed to several selections by the band.
The (Jlee Club was also heard in sev
eral numbers.
Dr. Branner, as chairman for the
day, announced that the Faculty had
expressed their welcome to Dr. Jor
dan individually and collectively on
other occasions since his return. It
remained for the students to express
their appreciation through their Pre
sident.

are fit to be president of anything.
"I want the students to realize that
there never was a time when there
was such a Golden Age at Stanford.
At present we have the best men that
have ever been here, they are getting
the best instruction that Stanford men
ever got, and they are graduating
with the best preparation for life work j
that Stanford men ever had.
"Every • University has a system of
customs and traditions which repre
sent the attitude of the average of
] the student body. The Faculty of
Stanford realize that this system is
good. They will let it run just as
far as is good so long as the honor or
good name of the university is not
affected.
Purposes of Japanese Trip.
"I went over to Japan partly at the
invitation of the numerous and thriv
ing peace socities there, and partly
: because I wanted to know what the
Japanese people are thinking and say
ing in regard to the great matter of
international peace. I wanted to add
I a little bit to the public opinion
against war and the putting of money
j into armaments. Armaments are not
| protection but are means of getting
up war scares and making people buy
i more armaments.
"International war has played out
because of its expensiveness. Civil
wars still continue to exist and will
so continue until all the nations have
j a truly representative and democratic
i form of government. The people in
I China prefer a civil war to having
their heads cut off in bundles of one
hundred. Turkey has long since been
bankrupt. She must realize on her
! assets. She owes over one-fourth of
I her wealth to the "Unseen Empire" of
' the Rothschilds. It is an unwritten
j law of nations that they cannot sell
j their assets until after a war. This
is the cause of the war in Tripoli, as
near as I can judge.
The speaker next dwelt upon the
many beauties of Japan, declaring
that in many ways it is the most lovely
country in the world. He told of the
good-natured attitude toward all I
things of the Japanese, of their muni
ficence, and politeness.
"The trouble with the adverse re
ports which travellers bring home
from Japan," he continued, "is that
they are taken only from one point
of view. In any place if one wishes
to they can hear anything about any
thing. That is the trouble with the
reports from Japan."
President Meets Mikado.
After telling of many interesting J
i Japanese customs and speaking of a
tremendous meeting which he address
ed in Osaka, the President told of
his audience with the Emperor of
Japan.
"I was invited," he said, "to meet
the Emperor through his representa
tives. The Mikado's residence is a
large palace in the general fashion of
the better Japanese houses. I came
to the palace with the American
charge de affaires in the absence of
the minister. As is the custom, we
took off our shoes at the door of the
palace and donned slippers. On gen
era] principles I took off my glasses
and found later that T had done the
right thing. There are only two rules
in meeting the Emperor. The first !
of them is to take your cue from his j
speech and the second is not to turn
I your hack. T found the Emperor to be
j a quiet person with apparently an
, unusual amount of sense. One would
[ consider him a very excellent person
! were he not an emperor. T also met
! the Empress. They are two of the
: really good people in the world, ir
respective of their positions."
After discussing the condition in ;
fovea as it exists at the present time
and telling of the causes of the Russo-
Japanese war, Dr. Jordan concluded
by discussing the attitude of Japan to
ward the United States.
"All war talk between the United
' States and Japan is the malicious gos
; sip of either fools or knaves," he said,
j "It is the desire of certain men to
boost the armament business, or else
a certain desire to find something to
| do with the warships. The Japanese
do not want to fight anybody. They
| are as peaceful as any civilized na-
I tion.
Three Elements in Friendship.
"Three elements enter into their
! friendship with the United States.
[ They love America distinctly. The
United States is Japan's nearest

friend. Sometimes the conditions are
a little estranged, but it is not for
long. In the second place Japan is
trying to do one thing and one thing
only, and that is on the continent of
Asia with relation to Corea. She is
playing for big stakes there. In the
third place one-fifth of her total
wealth of seven thousand million dol
lars is covered by her tremendous war
debt. Unless Japan is forced to the
wall she cannot raise money for an
international war.
"The bond brokerage house of
Rothschild is the most powerful na
tional factor in the world. They will
loan no money for two big nations to
go to war but only for one big nation
to gobble a smaller one or a civilized
one to grab a barbarous one."
"True patriotism has nothing to do
with the martial spirit. To respond
to the drum is not patriotism. The
patriot is not a soldier of fortune.
The patriot is the man who loves his
country, who believes in what his na
tion stands for, and who will give
his life, if necessary, that his nation
may stand for righteousness. The
martial spirit belongs to the mediae
val world, when fighting was the chief
business of men, and when plunder
was the chief motive for fighting. The
growth of science, the development of
invention, the spread of religion are
all bound up in the maintenance of
peace. Virility depends on struggle,
the struggle against the evils of the
world and the conditions of life. It
is in no way dependent on drums and
flags, nor on the killing of men, either
individually or collectively. War was
once universal. We have driven it to
the boundaries of nations. We have
made it illegal everywhere else. We
have made it so costly that its con
tinuance means national ruin. The
whole world is still paying the bills
incurred by Napoleon, Bismarck, and
the grafting adventurers of the
Orient. Just as baronial wars, reli
gious wars, feudal wars, inquisitions,
crusades and coats of mail vanished
when people saw them with clear
vision, so international wars will come
to an end, all of a sudden, when people
see them as they are. That time has
now come, and only the money that is
in it to builders and promoters keeps
alive the standing armies and the
navies of today.—David Starr Jordan.
"All war talk between the United
States and Japan is the malicious gos
sip of either fools or knaves," Thus
President David Starr Jordan briefly
summarized the relations existing at
the present time between these two
great world powers in his significant
address before the University this
morning.
The Assembly was a splendid one.
The hall was packed with students,
faculty and visitors who came to hear
America's foremost advocate of peace
tell of his impressions of Japan after
a seven weeks intimate visit in the
land of the Mikado.
As. a welcome to Dr. Jordan the
Assembly was a marked success.
When the President of the University
appeared on the platform with Acting
President Brannner, and Student Body
President K. L. Schaupp '12, the au
dience broke out into spontaneous a;>-
plau.e such as is seldom heard in
the Assembly Kail. Back and forth,
ri-in v and falling, it thundered forth
its welcome to the President who re
turner! to the University a greater
wcrld-fisure and world-mind than ever
before.
Preceding the arrival of the speak
ers on the stage the big audience in
dulged in yells and songs, and listen
ed to several selections by the band.
The (Jlee Club was also heard in sev
eral numbers.
Dr. Branner, as chairman for the
day, announced that the Faculty had
expressed their welcome to Dr. Jor
dan individually and collectively on
other occasions since his return. It
remained for the students to express
their appreciation through their Pre
sident.
S«'lisiii |t|» Welcomes President,
Schaupp spoke in part as follows:
"It is not necessary for me to say
that we are glad to see you hack
As president of the Student Body I
have been asked to express our wel
come to you. We appreciate the work
which you have been doing not only
for this University but for the world
in general.

"I can report to you that the con
dition that exists now in the Student
Body and between them and the Fa
culty was never better. All looked
to tiiis semester with some fear as to
its outcome. That fear has been
shown to be without foundation. The
days of conflict between Faculty and
student are past. It is not good to
look too far into the future or back
Into the past. We are living in the
present and it is to the present we
must look.
"No University can be great without
making some sacrifices. We gave up
the Freshman game not so much be
cause we wanted to as because we had
to. Now we want to meet the mem
bers of the Faculty on an equal foot
ing—on a common plane. We feel
that we are getting toward the point
of co-operation. I hope the future
will bear me out when I say that we
look forward to a more prosperous
time for Stanford that she has ever
seen."
President Jordan Speaks.
"I needn't say I am glad to get
home,'' said Dr. Jordan when he rose
to speak, "even though I am not here.
I am at present officially represented
in Boston. Since 190 Git has been my
duty to travel some 25,000 miles every
year on other people's business. In
that time I have been gratified that
the University goes along better dur
ing the times when I am not here than
when I am here.
"I am gratified to see that you elect,
and have elected for some years, men
as president of your Student Body who
are fit to be president of anything.
