# PRESIDENT JORDAN TELLS OF TRIP TO THE ORIENT
## University Head Delivers Splendid Address Before Big Assembly This Morning.—Characterizes War Scares as Lies. 
### 
"True patriotism has nothing to do
with the martial spirit. To respond
to the drum is not patriotism. The
patriot is not a soldier of fortune.
The patriot is the man who loves his
country, who believes in what his na
tion stands for, and who will give
his life, if necessary, that his nation
may stand for righteousness. The
martial spirit belongs to the mediae
val world, when fighting was the chief
business of men, and when plunder
was the chief motive for fighting. The
growth of science, the development of
invention, the spread of religion are
all bound up in the maintenance of
peace. Virility depends on struggle,
the struggle against the evils of the
world and the conditions of life. It
is in no way dependent on drums and
flags, nor on the killing of men, either
individually or collectively. War was
once universal. We have driven it to
the boundaries of nations. We have
made it illegal everywhere else. We
have made it so costly that its con
tinuance means national ruin. The
whole world is still paying the bills
incurred by Napoleon, Bismarck, and
the grafting adventurers of the
Orient. Just as baronial wars, reli
gious wars, feudal wars, inquisitions,
crusades and coats of mail vanished
when people saw them with clear
vision, so international wars will come
to an end, all of a sudden, when people
see them as they are. That time has
now come, and only the money that is
in it to builders and promoters keeps
alive the standing armies and the
navies of today.—David Starr Jordan.
"All war talk between the United
States and Japan is the malicious gos
sip of either fools or knaves," Thus
President David Starr Jordan briefly
summarized the relations existing at
the present time between these two
great world powers in his significant
address before the University this
morning.
The Assembly was a splendid one.
The hall was packed with students,
faculty and visitors who came to hear
America's foremost advocate of peace
tell of his impressions of Japan after
a seven weeks intimate visit in the
land of the Mikado.
As. a welcome to Dr. Jordan the
Assembly was a marked success.
When the President of the University
appeared on the platform with Acting
President Brannner, and Student Body
President K. L. Schaupp '12, the au
dience broke out into spontaneous a;>-
plau.e such as is seldom heard in
the Assembly Kail. Back and forth,
ri-in v and falling, it thundered forth
its welcome to the President who re
turner! to the University a greater
wcrld-fisure and world-mind than ever
before.
Preceding the arrival of the speak
ers on the stage the big audience in
dulged in yells and songs, and listen
ed to several selections by the band.
The (Jlee Club was also heard in sev
eral numbers.
Dr. Branner, as chairman for the
day, announced that the Faculty had
expressed their welcome to Dr. Jor
dan individually and collectively on
other occasions since his return. It
remained for the students to express
their appreciation through their Pre
sident.
S«'lisiii |t|» Welcomes President,
Schaupp spoke in part as follows:
"It is not necessary for me to say
that we are glad to see you hack
As president of the Student Body I
have been asked to express our wel
come to you. We appreciate the work
which you have been doing not only
for this University but for the world
in general.

"I can report to you that the con
dition that exists now in the Student
Body and between them and the Fa
culty was never better. All looked
to tiiis semester with some fear as to
its outcome. That fear has been
shown to be without foundation. The
days of conflict between Faculty and
student are past. It is not good to
look too far into the future or back
Into the past. We are living in the
present and it is to the present we
must look.
"No University can be great without
making some sacrifices. We gave up
the Freshman game not so much be
cause we wanted to as because we had
to. Now we want to meet the mem
bers of the Faculty on an equal foot
ing—on a common plane. We feel
that we are getting toward the point
of co-operation. I hope the future
will bear me out when I say that we
look forward to a more prosperous
time for Stanford that she has ever
seen."
President Jordan Speaks.
"I needn't say I am glad to get
home,'' said Dr. Jordan when he rose
to speak, "even though I am not here.
I am at present officially represented
in Boston. Since 190 Git has been my
duty to travel some 25,000 miles every
year on other people's business. In
that time I have been gratified that
the University goes along better dur
ing the times when I am not here than
when I am here.
"I am gratified to see that you elect,
and have elected for some years, men
as president of your Student Body who
are fit to be president of anything.
"I want the students to realize that
there never was a time when there
was such a Golden Age at Stanford.
At present we have the best men that
