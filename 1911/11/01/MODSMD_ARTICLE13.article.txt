# SAYS COLLEGE WOMEN MAKE GOOD WIVES
## ALUMNAE OF BIG COLLEGES HAVE GATHERED STATISTICS. Convention in New York City Proves Education Not Harmful to Home Making. 
### 
That college women make the best
wives is the declaration of the Associa
tion of Collegiate Alumnae, recently
in convention in New York City. In
order to prove this they have gathered
convincing figures, hard facts, and ir
refutable statistics, which will be pre
sented to the world at large during the
next month.
the Association is also ready to
prove that the college girl is not to
be found among the transient guests
at Reno —that when she marries for
good she bears more children than her
noncollege sister and that they do not
die in infancy. In fine, that she
develops into an all round sane,
healthy, home loving woman.
Investigation has established the
axiom that college girls marry two
years later in life than noncollege
girls, the actual age being 25; that
they have healthier children and more
of them, and that they select the men
as husbands who are best fitted for
intellectual companionship, as well
as best able t,o support them —namely,
professional men.
The association sent out letters to
college women all over the country, to
their brothers and to their noncollege
sisters. Replies to these have been
received from 3,600 college .women,
.rom 1,000 brothers and from 1,300
sisters. The answers show that 50
per cent of the girls who spend four
years in college are married at the
average age of 25. The number of
marriages is not small, comparatively,
for of the sisters and cousins of col
lege graduates who have not them
selves been to college, about the same
percentage marry, thus proving that
they come of a class only one-half
of whose women marry under any cir
cumstances.
It has long been contended that the
woman student is too deeply interested
in Browning and too much a student
;>? eugenics to have a large family.
This theory will be proved an utter
fallacy by the publication of the
report.
