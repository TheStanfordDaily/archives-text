Statistics just compiled in the State
University indicate that ri'gby football
players tend to be good students. It
has been found that members of the
Freshman team in intellectual capa
city and success in their studies rank
far above the total number of eligible
Freshmen and the group of Freshmen
who failed to make the team. Over 56
per cent ol' the Freshman fifteen had
no deficiencies' while of the others
only ;>0 per cent were free from defi
ciencies. In attendance at classes the
team members also rank far above the
others.
