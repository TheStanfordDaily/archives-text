# BAND WILL NOT PLAY SUNDAY AFTERNOON.
## Too Many Appearances in Next Ten Days Necessitate Rest on Next Sabbath. 
### 
No concert will be given by the
Stanford Hand next Sunday afternoon,
owing to the number of appearances
this week and next. Today they
served double duty by playing at the
assembly in the morning and at the
game in the afternoon. The whole
band will play at Saturday's game and
at the rally on the following Thurs
day.
As a final for two weeks of stren
uous work the band will put forth its
best efforts on the day of the big
game. The result bids faid to sur
pass the work of any band ever put
out by either university.
The excellence displayed by the or
ganization at the Assembly this morn
ing comes as a reward for two months
of hard practice. Much credit for the
showing is due to Professor E. W.
Martin, who has been the central
figure in organizing the band.
