# VARSITY IN FINE FORM DEFEATS CANADIANS
## British Columbia Secures Three Points on Penalty Kick, but Stanford Wins Easily by Score 27-3. 
### 
International rugby took the center
of the stage this afternoon when the
Varsity met the British Columbia
fifteen on Stanford Field. The Cana
dians sent most of their strongest men
into the game, picked from the show
ing that they made in the two con
tests against California last week.
Three of their players are on the in
jured list, however. Jolinson, their
best full, was not in the game because
of a bad knee received in the scrum
mage last Wednesday. Dean, a wing,
was on the sidelines, as was Ackland,
the crack hooker. Other than this
trio the northerners are in excellent
condition.
The Varsity stepped right into the
lead after the first five minutes of the
second period. Then the Cardinal be
gan to get in several perfect passing
rushes. The try by the Gard, Erb,
Geissler, Erb, Noble combine, from 25
was perfectly carried through. An
other by practically the same group
went through soon after.
Erb played the best game that he
has ever played. His kicks and passes
were of the highest order. Frequently
he booted for a 25 yard gain and at
least three were for 40 yards. Geis
sler also played a heady game that
beat any of his previous showings this
season. At one time when Noble kick
ed a short one at mid he secured and
outran the Canadians until he had
laid the ball over their line.
Every Stanford player played for
all he was worth.
