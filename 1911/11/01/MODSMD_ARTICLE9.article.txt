That was a fine sight at the Assem
bly this morning, when the President
of the Student Body spoke face to faco
with Dr. Jordan, the
An Unusual President of the Uni-
Siglit. versity, in plain words
and as man to man, and
not as student to faculty member. And
the way in which the unpretentious
and unadorned sentiments expressed
by the Student Body head were return
ed by the University President gives
hope of the most encouraging kind of
intercourse between faculty and stu
dents. Especially was that shown
when Schaupp said: "We have not
given up the Freshman game without
a protest because we lack spirit, but
because we realize that its abolish
ment was for a good purpose."
That is the spirit we need, and as
soon as the Faculty come to under
stand that the students are not school
boys, and the students to understand
that the Faculty are not taking radical
steps simply to be arbitrary, a great
deal of good can be accomplished dur
ing the coming year. The semester so
far has been a record making one.
Let us keep it so.—We need the Union.
