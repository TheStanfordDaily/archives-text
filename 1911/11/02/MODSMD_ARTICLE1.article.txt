# STUDENTS HEAR LECTURE ON CHINESE AWAKENING
## DETAILS OF REVOLUTION TOLD AT FIRST HAND. Y.M.C.A. Secretary Recently From China Gives Interesting Talk On Crisis. 
### 
"That same spirit of democracy
which exists here in America, which
has gripped Russia, secured a hold on
Turkey, and is entering Persia, is one
of the many underlying causes of the
unrest in the Chinese nation," said
F. O. Leiser, Y. M. C. A. secretary, of
Hongkong and Canton, China, recently
returned from the Far East, who ad
dressed a number of students in the
Chapel, yesterday evening, on the sub
ject, "The Awakening of China and
the Present Crisis."
The speaker went on to show that
the endeavors of the Manchus to con
trol the railroads, the putting off of
the democratic parliament, and the
new educational system, which has
trained the people to think, are other
motives behind the revolutionary
movement.
He also told of how loath the
Chinese were to come under the
Manchu Yoke in 1G44. It required
50 years to make the people of Canton
wear cues, the sign of submission to
the Manchu dynasty. This was ac
complished only after a massacre of
eighty thousand people.
Leiser not only showed that he had
a keen interest in his subject, and was
well acquainted with the existing con
ditions, but his method of relating his
topics pleased the audience.
The lecture was a further evidence
of the policy of the Y. M. C. A. to in
terest students in the foreign activities
of the Christian Association. The
Stanford branch has shown its interest
by agreeing to pay $150 this year to
wards the salary of R. R. Service,
U. C., '02, who is at present secretary
of the Y. M. C. A. at Chintu, China.
All of the colleges on the Pacific
Coast have banded together to pay
the money, and the local organization
made a creditable beginning last
night towards raising its apportion
ment..
