# ANNUAL DEBATE TAKES PLACE FRIDAY NIGHT
## STANFORD TRIO FORM WELL-BALANCED TEAM. Simpson, Owens and Higgins Will Represent Cardinal in Ninteenth Intercollegiate Debate. 
### 
Friday evening's intercollegiate de
bate will mark the nineteenth time
that Stanford and California have met
in this classic forum battle. The Blue
and Gold orators have triumphed in
ten of these contests and Stanford has
the remaining eight to her credit. In
the last three debates the California
speakers have been declared the win
ner.
With this record in view debaters
who will represent the Cardinal to
morrow evening will enter the contest
with the determination to win the
judge's decision and mar the record
of California wins. Each university,
however, is represented by a trio
which is the best in the respective
student bodies of the two rival institu
tions. The question for debate is,
"Resolved, That Judges Should be
Exempt From Recall.'"
The men who will speak for Stan
ford are: W. E. Simpson *13, W. B.
Owens '14, and P. L. Higgins '15.
These debaters form a remarkably
well-balanced team and are able ex
ponents of the forensic art. Careful
and exhaustive preparation has mark
ed the study of the trio in preparing
for the contest. The second team,
composed of C. C. Close *14, alternate
for the intercollegiate debate, G. Wood
13, and E. C. Smith '13, have aided
materially in the preliminary work of
the team. Regular weekly arguments
on various phases of the question
which will be discussed tomorrow
night have formed a large part of the
work of preparation.
Judges Are Well Known.
The judges chosen to decide upon
the merits of the contesting teams are
Fairfax Wheelan, San Francisco at
torney and classmate of former presi
dent Roosevelt, Frank Morton, princi
pal of Lowell high school, and Rev.
Father Joseph Gleason, of Palo Alto.
Professor F. C. Woodward, of the Law
department, will be the chairman of
the evening.
California Has Strong Team.
California's representatives will be
T. B. Kittredge '12, H. H. Phleger '12,
and L. E. Goodman '12. Kittredge
was a member of the 1911 Carnot
team. Phleger was alternate on last
year's intercollegiate team. Both he
and Goodman, the third of the trio,
have taken an active part in the inter
society contest at their university.
Phleger is also a member of the Var
sity rugby squad. The alternate for
the team will be F. D. Stephens '13.
Like the Stanford speakers but one of
the team has over represented his
U"iver?ity in a contest with another
institution. Kittredge is the experi
enced debater of the trio. Last spring
lie was a member of the Carnot team
wh'ch spoke in the Stanford Assembly
Hall.
Of the Stanford speakers, W. B.
Owens is the only one who has ever
ppheld the Cardinal colors against an
opposing university. Last spring he
made the trip to Seattle and debated
with the Wnshingtonians in the tri
state contest. He represented his
class in the 1911 Sophomore-Fresh
men debate. Euphronia is his society.
Simpson and Higgins are both very
fnrci'le speaker o . The former has
appeared in numerous debates in Nes
toria literary societv and belonged to
the trio which spoke for the 1913 class
in the underclassmen struggle last
spring. Higeins is a Freshman with a
splendid preparatory school record.
Th-? Stanford team will uphold the
negative side of the question. "Re
solved, That Judges Should be Exempt
From Recall."
