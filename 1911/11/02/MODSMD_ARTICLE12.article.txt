The curtesy of the Los Angeles
Times in offering to send the big new
paper to the Stanford Library to be
kept on file there, should
Newspaper receive recognition. The
Curtesy. Daily Palo Alto does not
believe in advertising ex
cept in the regular columns allotted
for that purpose, yet, when such a
journal as the Times goes out of its
way to make a gratuitous contribu
tion to the Library, under the cir
cumstances in which that gift was
made, it should be noted with thanks.
