# FOOTBALL SHOW STUNTS ARE PROGRESSING WELL.
## Finished Performance Assured on Night of Big Game.â€”Seats on Sale Monday. 
### 
A full rehearsal of "The Follies of
Stanford" will be held tonight at As
sembly Hall, the orchestra working
with the cast for the first time. So
far, concentrated work has been done
011 the dancing and individual skits
with gratifying results. The stunts
have rounded into shape so well that
little remains to be done except the
polishing. The original work and lo
cal hits, together with the effort that
has been exerted to make the show a
finished production, bid fair to insure
an exceptional success.
Last evening a rehearsal of the
dancing portions of the program was
held and carried through with grati
fying results to all concerned. The
intricate steps which have up to this
time proven more or less of a stum
bling block, went through with a rare
snap and finish. The remaining time
will be putin in rehearsals of the
sketch and songs and in polishing the
work already learned.
The tickets go on sale Monday
morning at the Bookstore, and from
all indications there will be a record
run.
