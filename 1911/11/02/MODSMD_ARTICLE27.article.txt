# WOMEN PREPARING FOR VARSITY TENNIS MATCH
## Players Have Been Divided Into Three Squads According to tirade of Play. 
### 
In anticipation of winning the wo
men's intercollegiate tennis match this
year, the women of the University are
putting forth their best efforts. The
Stanford players have never won over-
California, but this year the prospects
are bright for reversing the string of
defeats. Many strong players have
been developed during the past year.
Last semester California had a big
advantage in having Miss Hotchkiss,
national champion, as a player and
coach. This year California has the
same team with the exception of their
former star. The California women
also had the advantage last year of
practicing and playing the intercol
legiate match on their own asphalt
courts.
To obtain still better playing, Miss
A. Yoch '12, captain of the team, has
divided the women into three squads.
The members of the different squads
will play only with the women in their
own division and in that way close
and exciting matches are sure to fol
low. Whenever a woman shows her
self to be a better player than the
other members of her squad she will
be promoted to a higher division..
The number of women who signed
for practice on the Encina courts has
been so large that the squads have
been reduced practically to those in
the tennis club. Those who will prac
tice on Tuesday and Thursday after
noons on the Encina courts are: First
squad, Misses B. Bingham '14, L. Her
ron '14, E. Parker '12, A. Yoch '12.
Second squad, H. Batcheler '14, J.
Waud '14, L. Legge '11, M. Brown '14,
A. Wells '15. Third squad, M. Gard
'15, V. Murray '15, I. Clark '14, E. Mur
phy '12, G. Sheridan '14, C. Cox '12,
E. White '12, M. Lockwood '14, E.
Ireland '13, M. Merriman '13, and A.
Boone '14.
Any of these women who do not re
port twice a week for regular practice
will be dropped from the squads and
any outsider can take their place by
handing in her name to Miss A. Yoch
'12.
