# Los Angeles Paper in Library.
## 
### 
Newspaper files in the Library have
received a material increase by the
addition to them of the Los Angeles
Times. In response to a letter written
by a member of the student body, say
ing that no copies of Los Angeles pa
pers were to be found in the Library,
a letter was received recently from
the management of the Times. It
reads as follows:
"Responding to the good case which
you appear to make in yours of the
24th inst., we have decided to send the
Times to Stanford without charge, for
the time at least, for the files of your
Library.
"We have for years made a half
rate for public libraries everywhere.
This case of yours will be the single
exception where the Times has been
sent free."
