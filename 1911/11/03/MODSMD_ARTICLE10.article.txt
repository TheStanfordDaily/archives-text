## OPPOSE THE VARSITY IN FINAL PRACTICE GAME. Mare Island Marines Will Play Second Team at 2 O'clock as Curtain Raiser. 
### 
International Rugby on Stanford
Field to-morrow afternoon, at 3:30,
closes the preliminary season for the
Varsity, and cleans the boards for the
Big Game one week later. The
"Double V" combine from across the
border will oppose the Cardinal play
ers for the second game with Stan
ford, and the last of their series with
the American universities. Last Wed
nesday the Canadians met defeat be
fore the formidable rush of the Car
dinal speed giants but it was only
alter they had played the best game
that has been witnessed on the local
field this season.
Canadians Out For Victory.
The British Columbians are out for
a victory tomorrow. They arrived on
the sod of California nearly two weeks
ago and went into the first game in
which they had ever played together
as a single rugby unit. Previously
they had played on separate organiza
tions who battled yearly for the cham
pionship of British Columbia. Twice
they went down to defeat before Cali
fornia, but in those two games they
had learned the Americans' method of
play and had learned to know each
other better, this making for a strong
er team. The third game that they
played was with Stanford, but they
came at a time when the Cardinal
Varsity was feeling the full extent
of its power and the science that
Coach Presley had taught them during
a hard season's training.
Dribbling a Fine Art.
The rugby that the visitors played
on Wednesday was a revelation.
Never had such dribbling been seen in
America. With their feet the Cana
dians were able to handle the ball al
most as easily as the Cardinals with
their hands in passing rushes. At
tackling they surpassed the Varsity
and seldom failed to bring down their
mark unless it be the swerving Geis
sler or Erb. They were the most
skillful touch finders, when on the
defense, and checked the Cardinal
line several times by their quick kicks
when they were pressing hard for a
score.
Coach Presley will send the strong
est team possible into the field. In
the scrum W. L. Smith, Dole and
Frank will be missed in those de
partments of play for which each is
especially noted. The pack has be
come used to the absence of Smith and
Frank and have learned how to play
effectively without them. The taking
away of Dole has been more recent
and the scrum is not yet quite sure of
itself without Dole to rally around
and to reach up after the ball in the
lineouts. It seems probable that Wat
kins may be kept out of middle rank
to let his ankle rest.
The same forward combination that
worked so effectively Wednesday will
again face the Northern stars. Cor
bett, A. Sanborn and Haley will play
the front rank. Partridge and Wat
kins, or his substitute, will form the
middle rank. Gard, Schaupp, and
Woodcock will play the rear rank.
Another disruption takes place in
the backfield. Erb was taken to the
Peninsula Hospital yesterday after
noon with a slight injury to his knee
as the imminence of the Big Game
made it advisable to take extra pre
cautions. Templeton, the brilliant
Freshman substitute for Erb, will take
bis place to-morrow. He is the small
est player on the Varsity squad but
his natural ability and nerve more
than offsets this.
Harrigan will also be on the side
lines tomorrow, to rest an injured
ankle received in the game on Wed
nesday afternoon. His place will be
taken by Worswick. Kern is in the
same boat and will be excused from
appearing in togs tomorrow afternoon.
T. Sanborn will play his position.
Geissler and Cass will play their old
stands. Risling stays at full and
Noble at the second five.
Second Team Plays Marines.
At Mare Island Navy Yard, the
Marines will be given a holiday to
morrow for the purpose of journeying
to Stanford to play the second team
on Stanford Field at 2 o'clock,' as a
curtain raiser to the Varsity-British
Columbia game. The marines are
playing the game for the first time
this season but they have a husky
group of natural athletes on their
squad, which now numbers fifty. They
have only been playing the game about
six weeks but at least one game per
week has been played during that time,
and the result has been to build up a
surprisingly strong team for a group
playing rugby for their first season.
They should not, however, prove very
formidable opponents for the fast
second team, who are used to the
hard scrummages with the Varsity.
Still, the machine-like precision ga
thered in the years of military service
by the marines, should make them
opponents who will not lose their
heads in a tight place.
The game tomorrow should be an
interesting one to watch. The marines
are hard workers and twice have tried
to register a victory from the Blue and
Gold second team. The first game was
about three weeks ago, at which time
they were easily defeated. Last Sat
urday they played their second game
with the Blue and Gold and showed
a decided improvement over their first
appearance. The main weakness of
the marines lays in their too strict
adherence to the old game style of
play. This, however, makes them ef
fective tacklers.

ley, Partridge, Watkins.Gard.Schaupp,
