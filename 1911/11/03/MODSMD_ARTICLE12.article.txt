# United Efforts.
## 
### 
Once more the efforts of a group of
men are to be given to aid in raising
funds for the Stanford Union, and

money secured not by in
dividuals but by students
joining for one good pur
pose will be advanced for the

building. We repeat, again, that the
Union will be that much stronger for
having been helped by all the men in
the University banding together with
a common aim. Money given by indi
viduals is a good thing, to be sure, and
ought to be solicited, if the students as
a whole cannot join together to give
money, but we believe that if all are
together in the same project the in
terest will be universal, and that is the
spirit that is wanted.
The Musical Clubs have, therefore,
once again shown their usefulness in
a timely and noteworthy way. More
over, we need the Union.
