# STANFORD AND CALIFORNIA IN TWO SOCCER CONTESTS.
## 
### 
Stanford and California will meet
on the soccer field in the regular
scheduled games of the California
Football league on the morning pre
ceeding the Big Game and again on
Thanksgiving Day. Both of these con
tests will he played on the Encina
gymnasium field. The place of the
two contests was not decided by the
league committee but as the result of
a conference between H. W. Maloney,
coach of the Cardinal team, and
Graduate Manager Farmer of Califor
nia.
From a conservative comparison of
the merits of the rival teams the
prospects of a Stanford victory in both
of these matches is extremely bright.
The Cardinal players have been mak
ing a wonderful showing in the league
games against the strong San Fran
cisco elevens. Although not the lead
ers in the championship race the Stan
ford team is well up in the percentage
column of the league. The Califor
nian's are the cellar champions of the
eight clubs composing the league.
They have yet to win their first game.
