# DEBATERS READY FOR ANNUAL FORUM BATTLE.
## Forensic Enthusiasts Anticipate Close Contest in Intercollegiate Struggle Tonight in Assembly Hall. 
### 
Intercollegiate debaters will occupy
the center of the stage tonight, when
the speakers of Stanford and Califor
nia meet at 8 o'clock in the Assembly
Hall in the annual forensic contest
between the two universities. The de
bate promises to be the closest in
years as the rival trios are evenly
matched and exceptionally well bal
anced.
Stanford's representatives, W. E.
Simpson '13, W. B. Owens '14, and
P. L. Iliggins '15, have devoted much
time to an exhaustive study of the
subject of the judiciary recall, the
question which will be argued by the
debaters. All of the men are forceful
orators and form a rare combination
both as logical reasoners and as pre
senters of argument. Simpson and
Owens are debaters with much experi
ence at Stanford but Owens is the only
one of the team who has ever appeared
on the forum as a member of a Car
dinal debating team. He was a tri
state orator last spring. Simpson
represented his class in the under
classmen contest last semester. Ilig
gins is the first Freshman who has
won a place on a Stanford debating
team for many years. He was one of
the speakers for San Jose against
Lowell in the 1911 interscholastic de
bate for the Stanford cup. C. C. Close
'14, is the alternate on the team. He
was also on his class debating team
and will again uphold the 1914 colors
in this year's Sophomore-Freshman
struggle.
T. B. Kittredge '12, H. H. Phleger
'12, L. E. Goodman '13, with F. I).
Stephens '13, as alternate, compose
the Blue and Gold trio. These speak
ers wil argue on the affirmative side
of the question.
The intercollegiate agreement com
mittees of the two universities are
fortunate in the choice of the men who
will judge the debate. The three who
will act in this capacity are: Fairfax
Wheelan, of San Francisco, Frank
Morton, principal of Lowell high
school of San Francisco, and Rev.
Father Joseph Gleason, of Palo Alto.
F. C. Woodward, of the Department
of Law, is to be the chairman of
the evening.
