# CLUBS TO GIVE RECEIPTS OF TRIPS TO AID UNION
## Musical Organizations Will Stage Entertainments at Monterey and Watsonville in December. 
### 
Two off-the-campus concerts will be
given in December by the Combined
Musical Clubs, as benefits for the Stan
ford Union. The first will be in Mon
terey at the Monterery theatre, on the
night of December 8, while the second
will occur the following evening in
Watsonville.
About thirty men will make up the
party taking the trip. The personnel
will be divided about equally between
the members of the Mandolin and Glee
clubs. The trip will he undertaken
by the Combined Clubs upon their
own responsibility and the net profits
of the two concerts wil] be divided
between the Stanford Union fund and
the Club's treasury.
Stanford alumni in and near both
cities are booming the concerts and
doing all in their power to secure
record-breaking audiences. The clubs

I should prove a great drawing card in
| Monterey, particularly as this city is
j in the midst of a locality strongly
! Stanford in sentiment. The proximity
; of Pacific Grove and Carmel will fur
| nish many interested spectators at the
I first concert.
i The program will be made up of
j musical numbers and two or three
j skits of a musical nature. Instrument
jal and vocal selections will be dis
j tributed about equally between each
lof the clubs. Both organizations have
, a number of new pieces ready for
i presentation, which will be featured
â–  along with some of the numbers which
, made a hit in the recent Eastern tour.
The necessary permission to take
j the trip has been secured from the
| Student Affairs Committee. President
. C. H. Hayes '12, of the Combined Clubs,
is in charge of all the arrangements.
