# OARSMEN SIGN UP FOR FALL CREW TRAINING.
## Forty-Four Aspirants For Scats in Cardinal Boats Work-out Under Captain Seward. 
### 
Fall training for crew candidates
was inaugurated for the first time at
Stanford yesterday afternoon, when
over forty men answered captain Ft. H.
Seward's '12. call for oarsmen, and
signed up at the meeting at the boat
house on L:ike Lagunita. But thir
teen of those who signed up at the
first workout have ever had any prev
ious training on the water. The early
training will he done under the train
ing of captain Seward and will he pri
marily for the new aspirants for crew
honors. The Varsity men are expect
ed to,commence active preparation for
next- spring's race immediately after
the close of the rugby season.
After the preliminary instruction
and the signing of the roll the oars
men were put through a short setting
up exercise and taken for a cross
country run. The fall training will
consist in this sort of workout each
day. In addition to this the candi
dates are to train on the rowing ma
chines in the Encina gymnasium.
Every man who is out for places on
either the Freshman or Varsity crews
must report each afternoon at the
Hoat house at 4:45 on all days except
Saturday, when the time is set for
9:30 in the morning. Only those who
have gymnasium at the hour men
tioned or who are out for football
will be excused.
The object in beginning instruc
tion for the rowers at this time is for
a two-fold purpose. The men will be
able to get into condition this semes
ter and will be ready to start the work
on the water early next January. The
period of preliminary training neces
sarily takes up a large amount of
valuable time and this will be accom
plished before the active work begins.
