# REFEREE TO BE CHOSEN BY ALUMNI COMMITTEE.
## Lanagan, Folsom and Nelson Represent Stanford Tonight at Conference at Palace Hotel. 
### 
Three joint meetings of the Inter
i collegiate Agreement Committees hav
j ing brought no definite action to-
I having brough no definite action to
| wards the selection of a referee for
; the Big Game, it has been decided to
; leave the matter to a committee of
three alumni of each university.
These men will meet this evening in
the Palace Hotel, San Francisco, and
make strenuous efforts to agree upon
the prime official for November 11.
The men selected to represent Stan
ford in this conference are J. F. Lana
gan '00, Professor I). M. Folsop 'o:'>.
and H. C. Nelson '10. The members of
this trio are all interested in rugby,
and are sufficiently in touch with the
I present situation to make them es
pecially well fitted for the selection of
the referee.
Meetings of the Intercollegiate
agreement committee were held last
Saturday, Wednesday, and Thursday,
j When last evening's gathering proved
I unavailing, Coaches Schaeffer and
j Presley refused to waste time in fur
; ther meetings. Presley, Schaeffer, and
Graduate Manager M. T. Farmer of
California were the only participants
j in the session.
At each meeting, various men have
1 been suggested for the position of ref
l eree, but not one of them was deemed
i by all present to he competent to hold
| the whistle on November 11. The
j appointment of the joint alumni com
mute.' will go far toward clarifying a
i muddled situation.
