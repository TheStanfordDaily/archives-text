# CALIFORNIA TRIUMPHS IN THE ANNUAL DEBATE
## STANFORD TEAM LOSES IN A CLOSE CONTEST. Cardinal Trio Surprises Supporters With Argument and Presentation. Work is Good. 
### 
California added another intercol
legiate victory to her number Friday
evening, when the speakers represent
ing the lilue and Clold were awarded
a hair-line decision in the nineteenth
annual debate with Stanford. The
subject of the debate was "Resolved,
That Judges Should be Exempt From
Recall." The forum contest was held
in the Assembly Hall.
The Cardinal trio, W. E. Simpson '13,
W. B. Owens '14, and P. L. Higgins '15,
upheld the negative of the question.
They clearly excelled in presentation,
and more than held their own in ar
gumentation. Although none of the
three men had ever appeared before in
an intercollegiate contest, the team
made an excellent showing and sur
prised many of its ardent supporters.
The winning speakers were H. H.
Phleger '12, T. 13. Kittredge '12, and
Le. E. Goodman '13. C. C. Close '14 and
F. D. Stephens '13, alternates for Stan
ford and California, respectively .acted
as timekeepers.
The judges of the debate were Fair
fax Wheelan and Frank Morton of San
Francisco, and Rev. Father Joseph
Gleason, of Palo Alto. Professor F. C.
Woodward, of the Law Department,
was chairman of the evening.
Phleger and Goodman Strong.
Phleger was the first speaker for
the affirmative. He ably outlined the
evils which should be corrected in our
judiciary, namely, inefficient and dis
honest judges. His contention that
the recall would not accomplish the
desired results but that the remedy
was the appointment of all judges by
the governor for long terms but sub
ject to recall by him. His qualifica
tions for a good judge were that he
should be honest, have technical
qualifications, and be of a judicial
temperament.
Perhaps the most effective member
of the California team was Goodman.
He maintained that the recall would
not work in the case of the tricky, dis
honest judge who would court popular
favor at the expense of the law. The
recall would not supply brains to an
ignorant judge. The great fault of
this system was that the best of the
judiciary might make occasional mis
takes and suffer for a single decision
at the expense of the country. Kitt
redge reviewed the arguments of his
colleagues and brought out further
evidence for the appointive system.
Owens Best Speaker.
Owens was the best of the Stanford
debaters and made the most logical
and forceful speech of the contest. He
denied the contention of the affirma
tive that power over the judiciary
should be placed in the hands of a few.
He showed that the people want direct
methods and that the plan advocated
by his opponents was practically the
recall system. Owens' refutation of
the California speaker's points was
well taken by the well-filled Assembly
Hall.
Simpson opened the debate for the
Cardinal, and pointed out the fact that
unfit men are on the bench in spite of
the fact that recall by the legislature
is allowed in many state. He was
against legislative recall in preference
to recall by the people. He supported
the idea that the recall was such an
extraordinary measure that it would
be used but in extreme cases.
Higgins showed himself to be an ex
ceptionally fluent speaker, and while
his argument was more abstract than
his teammates, yet he made a very
favorable impression in his initial
