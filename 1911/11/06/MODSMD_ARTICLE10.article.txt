# A
						Good Chance Lost.

### 
Although the fact may not be ap
preciated, yet we believe that every
student who did not attend the dipper

to Dr. Jordan in San
Francisco last Friday
lost one of the best and
most unusual oppor

tunities to get acquainted with Stan
ford ideals, and with men who, above
all others, are making and maintain
ing them. It is always the complaint
of the students that they do not have
a chance to see and be close to these
who are really responsible for the
University's policies. That charge is
valid no longer, and Friday night's
dinner was a history-making and a
unique way of disproving it. More
over, we need the Union.
