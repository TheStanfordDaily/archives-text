# Thin Ice.
## 
### 
A case recently came before the
Students' Affairs Committee of the Fa
culty in which permission was asked

for an undergraduate who had
already taken part in one dra
matic performance this semestr
to play a second time in a forth

coming production. A ruling was
made two years ago, and it was a
good one, that no students should be
allowed to play in more than one per
formance each half-year. There was
nothing to be done except to keep the
rule, in fairness to other students
who might desire the same permis
sion. There were, indeed, circum
stances deserving of unusual con
sideration, a case of illness, yet there
was still plenty of time left in which
to secure a substitute other than
one who had already played this fall.
Moreover, it was planned to give
university credit to the student who
was to play the part, an out and out
admission that this paricular student
activity was deserving of credit with
any course in the Stanford curriculum.
There is thin ice. If one activity in
a class with dramatics, receive credit,
why not all that class? Tt would be
a dangerous precedent. To break a
rule before every means of escaping
its breaking has been exhaused. sets
a bad example. Moreover, We Need
the Union.
