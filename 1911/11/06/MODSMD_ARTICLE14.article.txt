# EVERY SEAT SOLD FOR THE FOOTBALL SHOW.
## Large Number Unable to Secure Tickets For the "Follies." New Record Established. 
### 
Every seat for the football show was
sold by ten o'clock this morning, es
tablishing a record which has never
before been equaled. Long before
eight, students began gathering at the
Book Store on the campus and Wein
gartner's Pharmacy. Two hundred
and fifty numbers were drawn at the
Rook Store and there was still a long
line waiting for tickets. The lucky
holders of the low numbers soon
bought all the choice seats, and by
ten o'clock the "S. R. O." sign was out.
Quite a number of campus people
were unable to obtain seats, and a
good many of these are expecting to
secure standing room.
