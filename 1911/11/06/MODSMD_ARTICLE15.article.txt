# Rooters Again Break Loose.
## 
### 
Again the Cardinal enthusiasm
aubbled over on Saturday evening, and
after the serpentining rooters had
gone the length of the row, they
assembled before the headquarters of
the Varsity squad. Here they yelled
for Coach Presley, who, although he
had been in the house a few minutes
before, was not to be found. How
ever, H. C. Nelson '10, and .T. O. Mil
ler '08, gave short talks which helped
to swell the enthusiasm of the rooters.
"California is going to have an awful
job to carry home many points next
Saturday. I have been pessimistic up
to now, but tonight I am very opti
mistic," said J. O. Miller.
