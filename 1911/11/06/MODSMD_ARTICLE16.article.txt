# Freshmen Will Guard Bonfire Tonight.
## 
### 
Tonight the Freshmen will for the
first time watch their bonfire. The
pile is assuming such proportions that
the first year men are confident of
eclipsing last year's monster pile, and
are planning to set a strict watch over
it during the three remaining nights.
V. L. Sheldon, chairman of the bon
fire committee, has divided the squad
of workers into sections, the first do
ing the piling from 4:30 to 6:00, and
working by moonlight until 10 p.m.,
and the second watching the pile from
that time until daybreak. The sections
will be subdivided into relays by the
classmen, so that no one will have to
spend more than a few hours on the
field.
Every Freshman has been urged to
join one squad or the other, and to
spend his spare hours on the Gym
field.
