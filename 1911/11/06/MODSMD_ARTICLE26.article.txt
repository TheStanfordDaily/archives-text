California defeated the Olympic
Club fifteen 60 to 0 In the final game
of the preliminaries last Saturday.
• * * *
The game was one of the poorest
ever contested on California Field.
Few good plays were executed. To
wards the end of the second half the
Olympics put up no defense at all,
and the Blue and Gold men scored at
will. The overwhelming score was
largely due to the weakness of the
Winged-0 team.

Peart was shifted from wing to full
back during the first half. He re
lieved Bogardus. The chief criticism
of the latter is that his kicks are two
short. The general impression is that
Peart will play the position in the Big
Game. He was plainly unused to the
berth.

Evans played wing throughout the
contest and seems a certainty for
one of the two end positions. He play
ed a clever game.
• • • •
Pauly played a wonderful game at
breakaway. He is easily the star man
in the scrum.
