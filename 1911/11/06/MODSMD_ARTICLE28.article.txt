### 
The subject of Dr. Gardner's sermon
yesterday morning was "Faith, the
First Word of Religion."
He showed that faith was not con
fined to self. We go about our daily
life in faith and with it we plan our
future. It enters into the sanctities
of domestic life as the basis of true
marriage. Faith is the goddess of the
hearthstone. It is also the working
i ' *
basis of commercial life.
©n the political side it is often the
case that men vote without knowledge
of the man running for office but with
faith in him. The government is run
on the same plan—men trust their
officers. In college life it is the same.
Using football as an example, the
speaker showed the trust of the team
in their captain.
Faith lies at the basis of everyday
life —it inspires our deepest affections,
influences our highest ambitions, and
vitalizes our dearest hopes. It is the
watchw®j*d of the righteous and the
first word of religion.
We cannot verify God by our own
senses, according to Dr. Gardner.
Love, Truth and Divinity we cannot
see, hear, nor touch, but we believe
in these things. Doubt may come from
reason or from sin. When it comes
from reason, reason must heal the
breach.
