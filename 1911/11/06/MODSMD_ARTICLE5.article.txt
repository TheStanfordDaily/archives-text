# BANQUET FOR DR. JORDAN IS TREMENDOUS SUCCESS
## Three Hundred and Sixty People Connected with University Welcome President.—Inspiring Toasts Heard. 
### 
To say that the dinner given in San
Francisco for Dr. Jordan on Friday
evening was a success is putting it al
together to mildly .Every man and
woman of the three hundred and sixty
three who were present felt, after it
was all over, that the dinner would
long remain in their memory as one
of the pleasantest and most profitable
evenings of his or her life.
Crowded to capacity, and almost be
yond, the dining room of the Von Dorn
hotel presented a gala spectacle. The
stiff informality of a dress affair was
totally lacking. Throughout the even
ing there was a certain spontaneous,
jovial seriousness which pervaded
every diner. Trustees, Faculty, Alum
ni, and undergraduates mingled to
gether in a democratic manner which
would have caused those familar with
many an eastern university to open
their eyes in amazement.
The hall was prettily decorated with
red geraniums, taken for the occasion
by the women of the University from
the borders of the oval in front of the
Quad. The long tables were daintily
set for the occasion. The toasts were
ably and cleverly responded to. The
cuisine was excellent. Everything
combined to make the evening an un
qualified success.
Professor A. M. Cathcart of the Law
Department was the toastmaster for
the evening. With his clever remarks
the speakers were fittingly introduced.
After a few preliminary words he call
ed on K. L. Schaupp 12, President of
the Student Body, to respond to the
toast "Undergraduate Conditions."
Seluiupp Speaks For Students.
"The Stanford student body," he
said, "has begun to think. We at
last realize that we must have peace
in order to properly conduct our por
tion of the affairs of a great univer
sity. In the old days we started
'peerades' when we considered that
our rights had been infringed on. Now
we do not start 'peerades'; we have
our Student Conference to cooperate
with the students and the Faculty for
ihe amicable settling of disputes.
"Now we know beforehand if an ac-
Tion is coming and we also know why.
It used to come as a surprise—as a
thunderclap. It does not come like
that any longer.
"There was a time, and it was not
so long ago, when the student posed
as a martyr. This attitude is no long
er necessary. We know now why cer
tain actions are taken, through the
medium of our University Conference.
Now the Faculty are doing all they
can to help us, and we are beginning
to realize that their advice is good.
"We wish to thank the Alumni for
the last meeting of the Advisory Board
held on the campus. Tt opened our
eyes to things as they are."
Miss Henrietta Stadtmuller '95, rep
resenting the women among the alum
ni, was the next speaker. Her topic
for the evening developed in a clever
manner, was"The Obvious."
"It is 'the obvious,'" said Miss
Stadtmuller, "that we liave come here
tonight to do honor to President and
Mrs. Jordan.
Berry Tjilks on "Balance."
Introduced as "Mr. Berry of the
Sagebrush State," F. L. Berry '99,
spoke to the toast "Balance." He com
pared the balance necessary to prop
erly conduct a great university such
as Stanford to the balance found in a
submarine boat, which allows it to
rise or sink or maintain a single un
deviating level. After carrying out
this idea at some length he continued:
"They brought Dr. Jordan to Stan

ford to do the hard work which it was
necessary to do to effectually launch
the University. He did it; all of us
know how well.
"I feel that we can never lose Dr.
Jordan—that we can't lose him. He
has left his ineffacable impress upon
the University. I now call upon every
good Stanford man and woman to
stand by that record which Dr. Jordan
has made and live up to it."
Dr. R. L. Wilbur '96, head of the
Department of Medicine, was the next
speaker. His topic was "A Few Re
marks." In introducing him Professor
Cathcart said: "We will now hear a
few remarks by Dr. Wilbur on why he
quit practising medicine."
Dr. Wilbur began by telling remin
iscenses of Dr. Jordan during the
early days of the University. They
were so delightfully characteristic of
the President that every graduate and
undergraduate in the room appreciated
them as though they had been his own.
Referring to the members of the Fa
culty who had been in the service of
the University since its formation, Dr.
Wilbur said:
"The Roll of Honor that is the core,
the nucleus, of the University is an
undying monument to Dr. Jordan's
credit. It is a perfect testimonial to
his ability as an executive head that
he was able to gather around him such
an unusual and capable body of men
for his force of instruction. We hope
that we may carry on that great op
timism that is so characteristic of
our great president."
Professor Smith Speaks Next.
Professor H. L. Smith of the Law
Department was the next speaker. He
used as his topic for the evening
"Something From an Outsider." He
said in part:
"This is so distinctly a family affair
that I feel in accepting the invitation
of the toastmaster that I am breaking
into the family circle. This is simply
another evidence of the great hospital
ity I have enjoyed at Stanford.
"If I should name the two things
which have been most impressed upon
me since my stay at Stanford I should
say its hospitality and its President.
In introducing a story about the
President he said: "Of course you
cant'talk very long about fish without
eventually getting around to Dr. Jor
dan."
"The crusade against war," he con
tinued, "is a cause to which every
man may well give his time and all
his powers. And when it comes to
that, Stanford University can well give
up its claim to Dr. Jordan.
"I do not think that the Faculty and
Alumni hear any more welcome sound
than that of Dr. Jordan's returning
feet.
"It is his broad human sympathies;
his broad moral ideals, that make him
a man to be admired and loved. He
has enough ideals to build here the
one university above all the material
things of the world. He inspires the
faculty and students with the fire of
his own enthusiasms. We live in a
world where there is altogether too
little of moral aspiration. We think
too much of the dollar mark,
"So long as David Starr Jrtfdan is
president of Stanford University it will
not succumb to the material things
around it.
"And when the story of history is
told it may well be that Dr. Jordan' 3
name will go down as the greatest
scientist since Aristotle, the greatest
philosopher since Plato."
Dr. Brainier <»ives Testimony.
Responding to the toast "The Fa
culty's Testimony to Dr. Jordan,"
Acting President J. C. Branner said:
"Every year there are several vol
umes written and published by the
members of each department of the
University. There are twenty-eight
departments at Stanford and by group
ing the departments it seems that
there will be between fifteen and
twenty of these volumes from each
department. These will be printed a3
the Faculty's momento to Dr. Jordan
when he retires, and we hope it will
be some years yet."
Dr. Jordan is Last Speaker.
Toastmaster Cathcart, in introduc
ing Dr. Jordan said:
"We are not here to honor Dr. Jor
dan as one of the greatest living apos
tles of peace: nor as one of the ablesr.
champions in the world of the clean
life: nor as one of the greatest scien
tists—we are here to thank him that
for twenty years he had done his
level best for Stanford."
Dr. Jordan's speech was as follows:
"There is a time when one would
like to say the least thing that he
could say.
"This is now the golden age of
Stanford and there is every reason
why it should remain golden. The
system which we now have, with the

men as president of the student body
which .we have had recently, is as
nearly ideal as it has ever been in any
university at any time, in any place..
"Stanford is not destined to be the
richest university, because the state
universities will continually have gold
poured into their coffers from the leg
islature. Nor can it hope to be the
largest university. Rut it can and
must strive to be the best of all en
dowed schools of learning, one
which shall set the standards for all
others."

that, Stanford University can well give

"I do not think that the Faculty and
Alumni hear any more welcome sound

"It is his broad human sympathies;
his broad moral ideals, that make him
a man to be admired and loved. He
has enough ideals to build here the
one university above all the material

his own enthusiasms. We live in a

"And when the story of history is

Dr. Brainier <»ives Testimony.
Responding to the toast "The Fa
culty's Testimony to Dr. Jordan,"
Acting President J. C. Branner said:
"Every year there are several vol
umes written and published by the
members of each department of the
University. There are twenty-eight
departments at Stanford and by group
ing the departments it seems that
there will be between fifteen and
twenty of these volumes from each
department. These will be printed a3
the Faculty's momento to Dr. Jordan
when he retires, and we hope it will
be some years yet."
Dr. Jordan is Last Speaker.
Toastmaster Cathcart, in introduc
ing Dr. Jordan said:
"We are not here to honor Dr. Jor
dan as one of the greatest living apos
tles of peace: nor as one of the ablesr.
champions in the world of the clean
life: nor as one of the greatest scien
tists—we are here to thank him that
for twenty years he had done his
level best for Stanford."
Dr. Jordan's speech was as follows:
"There is a time when one would
like to say the least thing that he
could say.
"This is now the golden age of
Stanford and there is every reason
why it should remain golden. The
system which we now have, with the

men as president of the student body
which .we have had recently, is as
nearly ideal as it has ever been in any
university at any time, in any place..
"Stanford is not destined to be the
richest university, because the state
universities will continually have gold
poured into their coffers from the leg
islature. Nor can it hope to be the
largest university. Rut it can and
must strive to be the best of all en
dowed schools of learning, one
which shall set the standards for all
others."
To say that the dinner given in San
Francisco for Dr. Jordan on Friday
evening was a success is putting it al
together to mildly .Every man and
woman of the three hundred and sixty
three who were present felt, after it
was all over, that the dinner would
long remain in their memory as one
of the pleasantest and most profitable
evenings of his or her life.
Crowded to capacity, and almost be
yond, the dining room of the Von Dorn
hotel presented a gala spectacle. The
stiff informality of a dress affair was
totally lacking. Throughout the even
ing there was a certain spontaneous,
jovial seriousness which pervaded
every diner. Trustees, Faculty, Alum
ni, and undergraduates mingled to
gether in a democratic manner which
would have caused those familar with
many an eastern university to open
their eyes in amazement.
The hall was prettily decorated with
red geraniums, taken for the occasion
by the women of the University from
the borders of the oval in front of the
Quad. The long tables were daintily
set for the occasion. The toasts were
ably and cleverly responded to. The
cuisine was excellent. Everything
combined to make the evening an un
qualified success.
Professor A. M. Cathcart of the Law
Department was the toastmaster for
the evening. With his clever remarks
the speakers were fittingly introduced.
After a few preliminary words he call
ed on K. L. Schaupp 12, President of
the Student Body, to respond to the
toast "Undergraduate Conditions."
Seluiupp Speaks For Students.
"The Stanford student body," he
said, "has begun to think. We at
last realize that we must have peace
in order to properly conduct our por
tion of the affairs of a great univer
sity. In the old days we started
'peerades' when we considered that
our rights had been infringed on. Now
we do not start 'peerades'; we have
our Student Conference to cooperate
with the students and the Faculty for
ihe amicable settling of disputes.
"Now we know beforehand if an ac-
Tion is coming and we also know why.
It used to come as a surprise—as a
thunderclap. It does not come like
that any longer.
"There was a time, and it was not
so long ago, when the student posed
as a martyr. This attitude is no long
er necessary. We know now why cer
tain actions are taken, through the
medium of our University Conference.
Now the Faculty are doing all they
can to help us, and we are beginning
to realize that their advice is good.
"We wish to thank the Alumni for
the last meeting of the Advisory Board
held on the campus. Tt opened our
eyes to things as they are."
Miss Henrietta Stadtmuller '95, rep
resenting the women among the alum
ni, was the next speaker. Her topic
for the evening developed in a clever
manner, was"The Obvious."
"It is 'the obvious,'" said Miss
Stadtmuller, "that we liave come here
tonight to do honor to President and
Mrs. Jordan.
Berry Tjilks on "Balance."
Introduced as "Mr. Berry of the
Sagebrush State," F. L. Berry '99,
spoke to the toast "Balance." He com
pared the balance necessary to prop
erly conduct a great university such
as Stanford to the balance found in a
submarine boat, which allows it to
rise or sink or maintain a single un
deviating level. After carrying out
this idea at some length he continued:
"They brought Dr. Jordan to Stan

ford to do the hard work which it was
necessary to do to effectually launch
the University. He did it; all of us
know how well.
"I feel that we can never lose Dr.
Jordan—that we can't lose him. He
has left his ineffacable impress upon
the University. I now call upon every
good Stanford man and woman to
stand by that record which Dr. Jordan
has made and live up to it."
Dr. R. L. Wilbur '96, head of the
Department of Medicine, was the next
speaker. His topic was "A Few Re
marks." In introducing him Professor
Cathcart said: "We will now hear a
few remarks by Dr. Wilbur on why he
quit practising medicine."
Dr. Wilbur began by telling remin
iscenses of Dr. Jordan during the
early days of the University. They
were so delightfully characteristic of
the President that every graduate and
undergraduate in the room appreciated
them as though they had been his own.
Referring to the members of the Fa
culty who had been in the service of
the University since its formation, Dr.
Wilbur said:
"The Roll of Honor that is the core,
the nucleus, of the University is an
undying monument to Dr. Jordan's
credit. It is a perfect testimonial to
his ability as an executive head that
he was able to gather around him such
an unusual and capable body of men
for his force of instruction. We hope
that we may carry on that great op
timism that is so characteristic of
our great president."
Professor Smith Speaks Next.
Professor H. L. Smith of the Law
Department was the next speaker. He
used as his topic for the evening
"Something From an Outsider." He
said in part:
"This is so distinctly a family affair
that I feel in accepting the invitation
of the toastmaster that I am breaking
into the family circle. This is simply
another evidence of the great hospital
ity I have enjoyed at Stanford.
"If I should name the two things
which have been most impressed upon
me since my stay at Stanford I should
say its hospitality and its President.
In introducing a story about the
President he said: "Of course you
cant'talk very long about fish without
eventually getting around to Dr. Jor
dan."
"The crusade against war," he con
tinued, "is a cause to which every
man may well give his time and all
his powers. And when it comes to
that, Stanford University can well give
up its claim to Dr. Jordan.
"I do not think that the Faculty and

Introduced as "Mr. Berry of the
Sagebrush State," F. L. Berry '99,
spoke to the toast "Balance." He com
pared the balance necessary to prop
erly conduct a great university such
as Stanford to the balance found in a
submarine boat, which allows it to
rise or sink or maintain a single un
deviating level. After carrying out
this idea at some length he continued:
"They brought Dr. Jordan to Stan

ford to do the hard work which it was
necessary to do to effectually launch
the University. He did it; all of us
know how well.
"I feel that we can never lose Dr.
Jordan—that we can't lose him. He
has left his ineffacable impress upon
the University. I now call upon every
good Stanford man and woman to
stand by that record which Dr. Jordan
has made and live up to it."
Dr. R. L. Wilbur '96, head of the
Department of Medicine, was the next
speaker. His topic was "A Few Re
marks." In introducing him Professor
Cathcart said: "We will now hear a
few remarks by Dr. Wilbur on why he
quit practising medicine."
Dr. Wilbur began by telling remin
iscenses of Dr. Jordan during the
early days of the University. They
were so delightfully characteristic of
the President that every graduate and
undergraduate in the room appreciated
them as though they had been his own.
Referring to the members of the Fa
culty who had been in the service of
the University since its formation, Dr.
Wilbur said:
"The Roll of Honor that is the core,
the nucleus, of the University is an
undying monument to Dr. Jordan's
credit. It is a perfect testimonial to
his ability as an executive head that
he was able to gather around him such
an unusual and capable body of men
for his force of instruction. We hope
that we may carry on that great op
timism that is so characteristic of
our great president."
Professor Smith Speaks Next.
Professor H. L. Smith of the Law
Department was the next speaker. He
used as his topic for the evening
"Something From an Outsider." He
said in part:
"This is so distinctly a family affair
that I feel in accepting the invitation
of the toastmaster that I am breaking
into the family circle. This is simply
another evidence of the great hospital
ity I have enjoyed at Stanford.
"If I should name the two things
which have been most impressed upon
me since my stay at Stanford I should
say its hospitality and its President.
In introducing a story about the
President he said: "Of course you
cant'talk very long about fish without
eventually getting around to Dr. Jor
dan."
"The crusade against war," he con
tinued, "is a cause to which every
man may well give his time and all
his powers. And when it comes to
that, Stanford University can well give
up its claim to Dr. Jordan.
"I do not think that the Faculty and
Alumni hear any more welcome sound
than that of Dr. Jordan's returning
feet.
"It is his broad human sympathies;
his broad moral ideals, that make him
a man to be admired and loved. He
has enough ideals to build here the
one university above all the material
things of the world. He inspires the
faculty and students with the fire of
his own enthusiasms. We live in a
world where there is altogether too
little of moral aspiration. We think
too much of the dollar mark,
"So long as David Starr Jrtfdan is
president of Stanford University it will
not succumb to the material things
around it.
"And when the story of history is
told it may well be that Dr. Jordan' 3
name will go down as the greatest
scientist since Aristotle, the greatest
philosopher since Plato."
Dr. Brainier <»ives Testimony.
Responding to the toast "The Fa
culty's Testimony to Dr. Jordan,"
Acting President J. C. Branner said:
"Every year there are several vol
umes written and published by the
members of each department of the
University. There are twenty-eight
departments at Stanford and by group
ing the departments it seems that
there will be between fifteen and
twenty of these volumes from each
department. These will be printed a3
the Faculty's momento to Dr. Jordan
when he retires, and we hope it will
be some years yet."
Dr. Jordan is Last Speaker.
Toastmaster Cathcart, in introduc
ing Dr. Jordan said:
"We are not here to honor Dr. Jor
dan as one of the greatest living apos
tles of peace: nor as one of the ablesr.
champions in the world of the clean
life: nor as one of the greatest scien
tists—we are here to thank him that
for twenty years he had done his
level best for Stanford."
Dr. Jordan's speech was as follows:
"There is a time when one would
like to say the least thing that he
could say.
"This is now the golden age of
Stanford and there is every reason
why it should remain golden. The
system which we now have, with the

men as president of the student body
which .we have had recently, is as
nearly ideal as it has ever been in any
university at any time, in any place..
"Stanford is not destined to be the
richest university, because the state
universities will continually have gold
poured into their coffers from the leg
islature. Nor can it hope to be the
largest university. Rut it can and
must strive to be the best of all en
dowed schools of learning, one
which shall set the standards for all
others."
To say that the dinner given in San
Francisco for Dr. Jordan on Friday
evening was a success is putting it al
together to mildly .Every man and
woman of the three hundred and sixty
three who were present felt, after it
was all over, that the dinner would
long remain in their memory as one
of the pleasantest and most profitable
evenings of his or her life.
Crowded to capacity, and almost be
yond, the dining room of the Von Dorn
hotel presented a gala spectacle. The
stiff informality of a dress affair was
totally lacking. Throughout the even
ing there was a certain spontaneous,
jovial seriousness which pervaded
every diner. Trustees, Faculty, Alum
ni, and undergraduates mingled to
gether in a democratic manner which
would have caused those familar with
many an eastern university to open
their eyes in amazement.
The hall was prettily decorated with
red geraniums, taken for the occasion
by the women of the University from
the borders of the oval in front of the
Quad. The long tables were daintily
set for the occasion. The toasts were
ably and cleverly responded to. The
cuisine was excellent. Everything
combined to make the evening an un
qualified success.
Professor A. M. Cathcart of the Law
Department was the toastmaster for
the evening. With his clever remarks
the speakers were fittingly introduced.
After a few preliminary words he call
ed on K. L. Schaupp 12, President of
the Student Body, to respond to the
toast "Undergraduate Conditions."
Seluiupp Speaks For Students.
"The Stanford student body," he
said, "has begun to think. We at
last realize that we must have peace
in order to properly conduct our por
tion of the affairs of a great univer
sity. In the old days we started
'peerades' when we considered that
our rights had been infringed on. Now
we do not start 'peerades'; we have
our Student Conference to cooperate
with the students and the Faculty for
ihe amicable settling of disputes.
"Now we know beforehand if an ac-
Tion is coming and we also know why.
It used to come as a surprise—as a
thunderclap. It does not come like
that any longer.
"There was a time, and it was not
so long ago, when the student posed
as a martyr. This attitude is no long
er necessary. We know now why cer
tain actions are taken, through the
medium of our University Conference.
Now the Faculty are doing all they
can to help us, and we are beginning
to realize that their advice is good.
"We wish to thank the Alumni for
the last meeting of the Advisory Board
held on the campus. Tt opened our
eyes to things as they are."
Miss Henrietta Stadtmuller '95, rep
resenting the women among the alum

for the evening developed in a clever

"It is 'the obvious,'" said Miss
Stadtmuller, "that we liave come here

evenings of his or her life.
Crowded to capacity, and almost be
yond, the dining room of the Von Dorn
hotel presented a gala spectacle. The
stiff informality of a dress affair was
totally lacking. Throughout the even
ing there was a certain spontaneous,
jovial seriousness which pervaded
every diner. Trustees, Faculty, Alum
ni, and undergraduates mingled to
gether in a democratic manner which
would have caused those familar with
many an eastern university to open
their eyes in amazement.
The hall was prettily decorated with
red geraniums, taken for the occasion
by the women of the University from
the borders of the oval in front of the
Quad. The long tables were daintily
set for the occasion. The toasts were
ably and cleverly responded to. The
cuisine was excellent. Everything
combined to make the evening an un
qualified success.
Professor A. M. Cathcart of the Law
Department was the toastmaster for
the evening. With his clever remarks
the speakers were fittingly introduced.
After a few preliminary words he call
ed on K. L. Schaupp 12, President of
the Student Body, to respond to the
toast "Undergraduate Conditions."
Seluiupp Speaks For Students.
"The Stanford student body," he
said, "has begun to think. We at
last realize that we must have peace
in order to properly conduct our por
tion of the affairs of a great univer
sity. In the old days we started
'peerades' when we considered that
our rights had been infringed on. Now
we do not start 'peerades'; we have
our Student Conference to cooperate
with the students and the Faculty for
ihe amicable settling of disputes.
"Now we know beforehand if an ac-
Tion is coming and we also know why.
It used to come as a surprise—as a
thunderclap. It does not come like
that any longer.
"There was a time, and it was not
so long ago, when the student posed
as a martyr. This attitude is no long
er necessary. We know now why cer
tain actions are taken, through the
medium of our University Conference.
Now the Faculty are doing all they
can to help us, and we are beginning
to realize that their advice is good.
"We wish to thank the Alumni for
the last meeting of the Advisory Board
held on the campus. Tt opened our
eyes to things as they are."
Miss Henrietta Stadtmuller '95, rep
resenting the women among the alum
ni, was the next speaker. Her topic
for the evening developed in a clever
manner, was"The Obvious."
"It is 'the obvious,'" said Miss
Stadtmuller, "that we liave come here
tonight to do honor to President and
Mrs. Jordan.
Berry Tjilks on "Balance."
Introduced as "Mr. Berry of the
Sagebrush State," F. L. Berry '99,
spoke to the toast "Balance." He com
pared the balance necessary to prop
erly conduct a great university such
as Stanford to the balance found in a
submarine boat, which allows it to
rise or sink or maintain a single un
deviating level. After carrying out
this idea at some length he continued:
"They brought Dr. Jordan to Stan

ford to do the hard work which it was
necessary to do to effectually launch
the University. He did it; all of us
know how well.
"I feel that we can never lose Dr.
Jordan—that we can't lose him. He
has left his ineffacable impress upon
the University. I now call upon every
good Stanford man and woman to
stand by that record which Dr. Jordan
has made and live up to it."
Dr. R. L. Wilbur '96, head of the
Department of Medicine, was the next
speaker. His topic was "A Few Re
marks." In introducing him Professor
Cathcart said: "We will now hear a
few remarks by Dr. Wilbur on why he
quit practising medicine."
Dr. Wilbur began by telling remin
iscenses of Dr. Jordan during the
early days of the University. They
were so delightfully characteristic of
the President that every graduate and
undergraduate in the room appreciated
them as though they had been his own.
Referring to the members of the Fa
culty who had been in the service of
the University since its formation, Dr.
Wilbur said:
"The Roll of Honor that is the core,
the nucleus, of the University is an
undying monument to Dr. Jordan's
credit. It is a perfect testimonial to
his ability as an executive head that
he was able to gather around him such
an unusual and capable body of men
for his force of instruction. We hope
that we may carry on that great op
timism that is so characteristic of
our great president."
Professor Smith Speaks Next.
Professor H. L. Smith of the Law
Department was the next speaker. He
used as his topic for the evening
"Something From an Outsider." He
said in part:
"This is so distinctly a family affair
that I feel in accepting the invitation
of the toastmaster that I am breaking
into the family circle. This is simply
another evidence of the great hospital
ity I have enjoyed at Stanford.
"If I should name the two things
which have been most impressed upon
me since my stay at Stanford I should
say its hospitality and its President.
In introducing a story about the
President he said: "Of course you
cant'talk very long about fish without
eventually getting around to Dr. Jor
dan."
"The crusade against war," he con
tinued, "is a cause to which every
man may well give his time and all
his powers. And when it comes to
that, Stanford University can well give
up its claim to Dr. Jordan.
"I do not think that the Faculty and
Alumni hear any more welcome sound
than that of Dr. Jordan's returning
feet.
"It is his broad human sympathies;
his broad moral ideals, that make him
a man to be admired and loved. He
has enough ideals to build here the
one university above all the material
things of the world. He inspires the
faculty and students with the fire of
his own enthusiasms. We live in a
world where there is altogether too
little of moral aspiration. We think
too much of the dollar mark,
"So long as David Starr Jrtfdan is
president of Stanford University it will
not succumb to the material things
around it.
"And when the story of history is
told it may well be that Dr. Jordan' 3
name will go down as the greatest
scientist since Aristotle, the greatest
philosopher since Plato."
Dr. Brainier <»ives Testimony.
Responding to the toast "The Fa
culty's Testimony to Dr. Jordan,"
Acting President J. C. Branner said:
"Every year there are several vol
umes written and published by the
members of each department of the
University. There are twenty-eight
departments at Stanford and by group
ing the departments it seems that
there will be between fifteen and
twenty of these volumes from each
department. These will be printed a3
the Faculty's momento to Dr. Jordan
when he retires, and we hope it will
be some years yet."
Dr. Jordan is Last Speaker.
Toastmaster Cathcart, in introduc
ing Dr. Jordan said:
"We are not here to honor Dr. Jor
dan as one of the greatest living apos
tles of peace: nor as one of the ablesr.
champions in the world of the clean
life: nor as one of the greatest scien
tists—we are here to thank him that
for twenty years he had done his
level best for Stanford."
Dr. Jordan's speech was as follows:
"There is a time when one would
like to say the least thing that he
could say.
"This is now the golden age of
Stanford and there is every reason
why it should remain golden. The
system which we now have, with the

men as president of the student body
which .we have had recently, is as
nearly ideal as it has ever been in any
university at any time, in any place..
"Stanford is not destined to be the
richest university, because the state
universities will continually have gold
poured into their coffers from the leg
islature. Nor can it hope to be the
largest university. Rut it can and
must strive to be the best of all en
dowed schools of learning, one
which shall set the standards for all
others."
