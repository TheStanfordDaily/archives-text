# "Compromise" Cast Progressing.
## 
### 
As Miss A. Holmes is expected to
return to the campus next Wednesday,
it is probable that she will resume her
role in the "Compromise," the English
Club play, which is to he given in the
Assembly Hall on November 24. Dur
ing her absence the remainder of the
cast has been actively and ably coach
ed by Professor H. D. Gray, the author
of the drama, and is now well along
in the interpretation of the respective
parts. Consequently Mr. Gray, having
eliminated most of the detail work,
will be able to give the major part of
his time to the leads and insure a
finished production.
