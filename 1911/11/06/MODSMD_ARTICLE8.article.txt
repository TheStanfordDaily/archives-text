# CANADIANS CAPTURE A GAME FROM CARDINALS
## MANY SUBSTITUTE FILL PLACES OF VETERANS. Varsity Closes Seasonâ€”Second Team Easily Defeats Marines in Preliminary Game, 20-3. 
### 
With the Captain and over half of
the regular team out of the line-up
the Stanford Varsity met defeat for
the first time this season, 011 Stan
ford Field, last Saturday afternoon,
losing to the British Columbians by
the score of ii-5. About half of the
first-line forwards and practically all
of the backfield were not in the game,
because of more or less serious in
juries. For this reason very little
criticism of the play, either individu
ally or as a team, can be attempted.
When a list of the injured men who
were out of the game last Saturday is
printed it included almost an entire
fifteen men who have been making up
the Stanford Varsity this season. Yet
these men were out of the game for
mostly minor hurts and wil be able to

They are, Brown, Kern, Geissler,
Captain Erb, Harrigan, Cass (who
played only a part of the first half),
Dole, Corbett, Partridge, W. L. Smith,
Watkins, and Frank. The majority of
these players are now merely resting
up from injuries, some of which are
important and some minor.
Looseness of Play.
Looseness of play was almost a con
stant feature of the game, both r 3S
contributing. The backfield, In ig
made up of men who have not d
together of late, did not, of cour.<n,
show any teamwork. Balancing the
play of the forwards and backs, the
packmen were responsible for the best
game. They even attempted passing
rushes. The wheeling of the scrum
was one of the best things in the
game.
Cass played his usual position at
half until an injury to his ankle forced
his withdrawal. Tilton took his place
and surprised the onlookers by his
work.
Fox Good Hooter.
For the visitors Fox and Sweeney
played a strong forward game. Their
kicking was especially noteworthy.
Fox proved himself to be the same
hard hooter that he showed himself
to be in the first game. Luke played
a star game at half. He was an ex
pert dribbler and fearless all round
player. McGuigan was a strong con
tender as a wing. He was a hard
worker, using either foot to propel
the ball along the ground or through
the air as a touch finder. This quar
tet figured prominently in holding the
Cardinal line to long time defenses
and checking them when they assumed
the aggressive.

Second Team Boats Marines.
Stanford second team made its first
public appearance on the home turf
Saturday, when it defeated the Ma
rines, 20-3. As in most Second Var
sity games, the brand of rugby dis
played was not remarkable from the
point of team work, but several in
dividual players of brilliance were
discovered to the bleacherites.
The Mare Islanders have been play
ing the game for only one season, and,
consequently, do not possess a very
complete box of rugby tricks. Their
mainstay is their weight. They have
a team averaging around 170 pounds.
Tn addition, they have an aggregation
of clean players, many of them natural
athletes. The visitors showed pro
mise. and in a year their coach. Lewis
of the Barbarians, should make a rug
by team of the first order.
The game started off slowly with the
ball see-sawing between scrums and
line-outs near the halfway mark. The
advance to the Northerners' territory
