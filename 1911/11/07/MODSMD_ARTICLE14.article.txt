## BIG GAME NUMBER WILL BE UNUSUALLY GOOD. Coming Issue the Largest Ever Published. Many Innovations Are Introduced. 
### 
Crammed with art and material of
the highest order the Football Number
of the Chaparral will make its appear
ance on Friday morning. In size and
general quality of material this issue
tops all previous records in the his-
I tory of the publication and is a com
plete vindication of the optimistic
promises made at the beginning of the
j present semester.
In keeping with the spirit of the
occasion, as a Football number, the
cover design has been completely al
tered by A1 King '12, and will present
i a most striking effect according to the
preliminary reports made on the issue
by Editor L. D. Summerfield '12.
One promising innovation has been
i introduced in the present number of
the magazine which promises to in
crease its appearance many fold. Not
- content with a quality which already
1 surpassed the majority of college com
ics, and equalled the best, the publ
ishers. Hammer and Coffin, have se
cured India tint paper such as is used
in Life and other noted humorous
publications. This stock, although
very expensive, reproduces cuts so
faultlessly, and gives to the general
book a tone of elegance, that it was
deemed advisable by the publishers
to incorporate it in the Chaparral.
It will be used throughout the number
and will be in the nature of a perman
ent change.
Clover Art Work Featured.
The number will be filled with a
mass of cuts and engravings. As the
initial piece of art Tt. H. Hellman '11,
has contributed a catchy girl's head.
T his is supplemented with the usual
bit of clever and appropriate verse.
Following this will be found another
finely executed cut by A. T. King
'12, with the caption "The Same Old
Haunt." Editor Summerfield an
nounces that this will he more than
appreciated by everyone.
Several small sketches have been
done by .T. L. Dnff '13, the best of
j which is properly entitled "Caught
i With the Goods." "Still at it in 1911,"
by G. Smith '10, is a particularly clever
(drawing, filling a half page and pack
ed with action of the laugh producing
kind. W. R. Davenport 'ot, and E. E.
Manning '13, are both responsible for
humorous bits described as "human
sketches." Miss M. Hailey '14, has
surpassed ail her previous excellent
efforts in the line of art work and has
turned out several pieces for this
number, which, to quote the Editor,
"are sure winners."
A Designed Soul Kiss.
The best of these is one labeled "A
Timely Expression." M. W. Allen 'ir>,
in his half-tone " A Soul Kiss," has
executed an exceptionally fine piece of
designing. The full page half-tone
by Miss H. Clark 'in, depicting the
"Girl of the Game" is one of the art
features of the issue. In addition to
these special features the same people
have contributed a. vast amount of
other clever art.
j Chappie's Word to the Team.
The front page poem is particularly
! timely, being a few words "To the
Team." Among the longer articles
| a. burlesque re-write of "The Common
! Law," by M. T. Pooling '11. and illus
trated by J. L. Duff, is exceptionally
! clever. The "Dilettante" this time is

up to the usual standard. A review of
"Fatinitza" has a paee to itself.
The "Story of the Game," a parody
newspaper article, will be interesting
