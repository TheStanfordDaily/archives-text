It seems that in giving the Fresh
man class as a whole credit for an
unusual amount of spirit in starting
the construction of their bonfire six

weeks ago, that this
should have been applied
to only a small group of
the first-year men. But

few of them have been taking any very
active part in helping raise the pile,
and the work has fallen upon the
shoulders of the chairman of the com
mittee and a comparative minority of
the class.
Leaving out of the question the am
bition of the 1915 class or any class
of making the bonfire the "largest yet"
we say that it is not quite fair that a
few loyal men should appear day after
day to carry on the work, while other
members of the class, who will re
ceive part of the credit, are con
tributing nothing in the way of labor.
It is apparent, also, that if the bonfire
is to have any appearance of being
completed in time for the rally Thurs
day night, that more men must come
out and do some real work. Moreover,
We Need the Union.
