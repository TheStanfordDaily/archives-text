# GENERAL ITEMS IN BRIEF
## 
### 
Coach Williams is having a hard
time developing a strong eleven at
Minnesota this season Five veterans
are back but only two have been used
in their old positions. The quarter
back job is causing the most trouble
and as yet no suitable successor to
McGovern has been found. Williams
is being assisted by Shelvin, the old
Yale end and McGovern and Harris.
