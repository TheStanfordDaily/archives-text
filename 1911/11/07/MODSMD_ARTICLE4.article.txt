# STANDING ROOM WILL ACCOMMODATE OVERFLOW.
## New Stands and Drinking Fountain in Construction Near Football Field. 
### 
In anticipation of a record-break
ing crowd for Saturday, a platform,
upon which standing room will be sold
is being built at the east end of the
Stanford Field. Three thousand per
sons can be accommodated in this
s ; :>ace, and they will pay one dollar
each for admission. The platform is
being constructed well back from the
goal line, in order that 110 Stanford
man may collide with it in making a
try at that end of the field.
Another improvement which is meet
ing with popular approval is the
drinking fountain which has been
placed at the west end of the field,
outside the fence and near the train
ing house. The fountain is of solid
brick and masonry construction, and
is to be covered by a pergola.
