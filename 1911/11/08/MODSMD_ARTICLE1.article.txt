## BIRMINGHAM POST GIVES GOOD HISTORY. Clipping From English Paper Will Interest Many—Extract Sent by Vancouver Player.

"Who gave us Rugby football?"
asks the "Weekly Post" of Birming
ham, England. It answers the ques
tion in its issue of September 1, 1911,
as follows:
"There is memorial tablet in the
School Close at Rugby which supplies
the answer to this interesting ques
tion, and to which attention may ap
propriately be drawn at this, the open
ing of another season of the game as
played under the handling code. The
tablet, which is let into the wall of
the garden attached to the residence
of the headmaster of the world-famous
school, bears an inscription in the
following terms: —
This Stone
Commemorates the Exploit of
William Webb Ellis,
Who With a Fine Disregard For the
Rules of Football
As Played in His Time,
First Took the Ball in His Hands and
Ran With It,
Thus Originating the Distinctive Fea
ture of
The Rugby Game,
A.D. 1823.
"Rugby football in that distant day
was, it is hardly necessary to explain,
a vastly different pastime from the
game aa wo know it today under tfcvi
regis of the Rugby Union. As again?',
the present ideals of combined skill,
strength, and speed, its predominant
characteristic was an appeal to physi
cal force which, in our modern eyes,
would seem almost revolting in its un
restrained brutality. Hacking—i. e..
the intentional kicking of an oppo
nent's legs from under him, tripping
and scragging—i. e., twisting the play
er's neck —were practices which for
many years were regarded as perfect
ly legitimate, and which continued
for several years at Rugby after the
institution of the Rugby Union in
1871.
Once Had Twenty Players.
"Three old Rugbeians, it is interest
ing to note, assisted in the coding of
the first set of laws promulgated by
the Union —Messrs. Mq,ton, Rutter, a id
Holmes. At that time it was custom
ary to have twenty players a-side, and
it was not until the Oxford and Cam
bridge University authorities had set
the example in 1875 that the national
unions controlling England and Scot
land recognised the reduction of the
playing strength to fifteen a side, a3
is thi rub' nowadays, except, o' course
in the Northern Union. There there
are thirteen players, aside."
