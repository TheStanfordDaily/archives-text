# H.L. SMITH MEETS YUAN SHI KI
## TELLS OF MEETING THE CHINESE PRIME MINISTER. Faculty Member Throws Inside Light On the Orient's "Man of the Hour." 
### 
Professor H. L, Smith, of the Law
department, has furnished the Daily
Palo Alto with an interesting account
of Yuan Shi Ki, the recently ap
pointed Prime Minister of China, who
has been chosen to save the throne
for the infant emperor. Professor
Smith had the good fortune to meet
the distinguished Chinaman on his
recent trip to the Orient.
"It was on June 11, 1910," said
Professor Smith, "that I arrived in
Macao, a decayed and decaying Por
tuguese colony situated about forty
miles south of Hong Kong 011 a little
peninsula wrested !>y Portugal from
China in the seventeenth century. It
was in the hot season of the year and
I was not surprised to find myself the
sole European guest at the Macao
Hotel. A rather distinguished-looking
Chinaman, of more than average size,
erect bearing, clear eye, and a general
air of intelligence as well as of
mastery, was also at the hotel. Nu
merous servants did his bidding ob
sequiously, and it was easy to see that
he was a person of some importance,

special ambassador to the United

health. The climate of Pekin, whither
i intended going, he thought would
probably not be as bad for me as it

character and alertness, and had the

Professor H. L, Smith, of the Law
department, has furnished the Daily
Palo Alto with an interesting account
of Yuan Shi Ki, the recently ap
pointed Prime Minister of China, who
has been chosen to save the throne
for the infant emperor. Professor
Smith had the good fortune to meet
the distinguished Chinaman on his
recent trip to the Orient.
"It was on June 11, 1910," said
Professor Smith, "that I arrived in
Macao, a decayed and decaying Por
tuguese colony situated about forty
miles south of Hong Kong 011 a little
peninsula wrested !>y Portugal from
China in the seventeenth century. It
was in the hot season of the year and
I was not surprised to find myself the
sole European guest at the Macao
Hotel. A rather distinguished-looking
Chinaman, of more than average size,
erect bearing, clear eye, and a general
air of intelligence as well as of
mastery, was also at the hotel. Nu
merous servants did his bidding ob
sequiously, and it was easy to see that
he was a person of some importance,
fn the evening as wo sat on the veran
da overlooking the sea. the host in
troduced me to Yuan Shi Ki, ex-vice
roy of the province of Shantung, ex
special ambassador to the United
States, and now Prime Minister of
China.

with things occidental, not at all

| Pekin after he had regained his
health. The climate of Pekin, whither
i intended going, he thought would
probably not be as bad for me as it
had been for him. He conveyed an
impression of combined solidity of
character and alertness, and had the
air of easy and unabashed superior
ity which the absolute mastery of
millions of inferiors may well give
one.
