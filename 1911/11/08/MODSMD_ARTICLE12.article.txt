# BIG SMOKER TO BE HELD THURSDAY EVENING
## ALUMNI SENIORS TO RALLY IN ENCINA Annual Smoker Will be on Campus For First Timeâ€”All Seniors Urged to Attend. 
### 
On Thursday the annual Alumni-
Senior smoker will be held in Encina
clubroom. The affair will assume the
nature of past events of the kind. An
informal program will be given during
the evening, and light refreshments
will be served.
It is hoped that, through the smoker,
alumni of the University can be
brought into intimate contact with the
leading undergraduates of today.
Such a meeting, it is thought, will in
crease the bonds connecting the alum
ni to the University and the under
graduates to the alumni. The com
mittee in charge ask that every Senior
in college attend the smoker. It is
only in this way that the best results
can be obtained from the affair.
In the past the gathering of the men
at the Alumni-Senior smoker has
taken place in San Francisco. Be
cause of the fact that the Big Game
is to occur on the campus this year,
and a large number of prominent
alumni have signified their intention
of returning, it was thought better
by the committee to hold the smoker
here instead of away from the Uni
versity.
Arrangements have been completed
with those in charge of the big rally
tomorrow evening that all old Varsity
men returning to the University for
the game and attending the rally, shall
be seated in a body on the lower floor
of the Assembly hall. This is a new
custom but it is expected that it will
work better than having the old men
scattered through the crowd.
Alumni returning to the campus will
be found good accommodations either
in Encina or on the Row. Rooms have
been secured in both these places for
the use of returning men. The com-
I mittee announce that they will be able
to accommodate all who may be with
out a place to stay.
