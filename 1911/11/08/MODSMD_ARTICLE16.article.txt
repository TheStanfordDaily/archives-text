## Euphronia Holds Weekly Meeting. 
### 
"Resolved, That the Use of the Pri
mary Boycott is Justifiable," was the
question which occupied the attention
of Euphronia last night at the regular
weekly meeting. G. G. Howard '14,
and J. D. Hartsock *15, upheld the
affirmative of the argument against
E. C. Smith '13, and C. T. Dunham '13.
No decision was announced on the
question and, after the set debate, the
society heard several speeches from
the floor.
