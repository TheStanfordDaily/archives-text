# INTERCLUB TOURNAMENT WILL BE FINISHED TODAY
## Kappa Alpha and Sigma Chi Compete In Finalsâ€”Inteclass Contest to be Played Soon. 
### 
This afternoon the third tennis
tournament of the year will be com
pleted, when the final of the Inter
club Tournament is played. Kappa
Alpha, represented by Murray and
Geary will go up against Peabody and
Jones, representing Sigma Chi.
The singles of this tournament were
won last week by Dawson, playing
for Beta Theta Pi.
Singles in the Interclass Tourna
ment are well under way and should
be finished immediately after the Big
Game. Morgan, Murray, Dawson,
Hutchinson and Sheldon each has a
good chance to win this tournament
for his class. The first three mention
ed are probably the best players par
ticipating.
Play in the Interclass Doubles will
start in about one week and promises
some of the best tennis of the year.
For the Seniors, a team will prob
ably be picked from Morgan, Geary,
Grace, and W. G. Murray.
Last year's second doubles Varsity
team of R. L. Murray and Pratt will
represent the Juniors.
It is doubtful if a Sophomore team
will be entered as no partner has as
yet signed to play with Dawson.
The Freshmen have an exceptionally
good chance to win this tournament.
Sheldon and Hutchinson should form a
pair hard to beat.
Immediately after the Interclass
comes the Thiele Tournament, for
which the handsome Thiele Trophy is
awarded. This contest should bring
out a record-beaking entry list.
