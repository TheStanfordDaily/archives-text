# GENERAL ITEMS IN BRIEF
## 
### 
Princeton furnished the surprise of
the football season, Saturday, when
the Tigers defeated Harvard 8 to 6.
The Crimson eleven went into the
game a 2 to 1 favorite, but the stone
wall defense of the Tiger's line was
more than Harvard could overcome.
Wendell, Harvard's right half, was
the star of the game, and he was
directly responsible for the Crimson's
only score. This game is the first
contest between the two Universites
for fifteen years.
