# ERB AND CASS WILL BE IN SHAPE FOR BIG GAME.
## Dr. Williams Makes Positive Statement of Men's Conditionâ€”Other Cripples in Form. 
### 
"Erb and Cass will be in condition
for the game Saturday," was the posi
tive statement of Dr. T. M. Williams
'97, physician to the injured men, this
afternoon. While yesterday's develop
ments appear to have discouraged
some of the Cardinal enthusiasts, the
medical man's statement shows this
pessimism to be without foundation.
Erb.was operated upon yesterday for
the injury to his leg, with successful
results. Thorough examination has
verified the original diagnosis that
Cass has suffered no broken bones in
his ankle, and it appears probable
that a slight soreness will be the only
thing to hinder the halfback's speed
during the Big Game.
Brown and Dole are rapidly regain
ing form through light practice each
afternoon, and have almost forgotten
their hospital experience. Perhaps
the gravest doubts as to condition
attach to Frank. His knee still
bothers him, and he has been able to
take no hard workouts for some time.
W. L. Smith has practically recover
ed from his strained back, and Wat
kins is once more in the game. No
alarm is felt over the condition of Har
rigan, Partridge, Geissler, Kern and
Corbett, who were kept out last Satur
day on account of minor bruises.
