## ENCINA LAWN SELECTED FOR SENIOR LUNCHEON. California and Stanford 1912 Men Will Hold Al Fresco Affair at 12:30 Saturday. 
### 
Encina Hall lawn will present a
gay scene on the day of lhe Big Game.
This site has been selected as the
place for holding the luncheon to be
tendered the California Seniors by the
Stanford men of this year's graduating
class.
The occasion will be an excellent
one for (he Seniors to become better
ncqiiainted with the fourth year men
from across the bay. Informal affairs
of this nature will do more than any
thing else to cement a bond of friend
ship between the men of the two
institutions which will result in a
friendlier attitude between the two
University student bodies than exists
at present.
A buffet lunch will be served. The
menu has. not been decided on as yet,
but will probably lie in the nature of
a "dutch feed," with coffee as the
beverrtee.
Every man in the Senior class is
urged to be present and help make the
aff iir a success. Informality will be
the spirit of the occasion and it is
hoped that the men of the two Uni
versities will mingle freely.
In cnsfe the weather is unpleasant
the Gym will be pressed into service.
The a! fresco lunch will commence
about twelve-thirty.
The committee-in charge is made in
|of the following men of 19 J2: It. H.
Seward, S. W. Gilfillnn, C. R. Nunan,
It. F. Stever, J. \V. Howell, H. Murray,
G. 11. Lantz, M..L. Ward, and R. S.
Worthington, chairman.
