# HOPKINS WILL DONATE TROPHY FOR FOOTBALL.
## President of Board of Trustees to Give Award For Rugby Proficiency. 
### 
To focus interest in some particular
branch of rugby and promote suprem
acy in that line of the sport. Timothy
Hopkins, President of the Board of
Trustees of the University, has offered
to donate a trophy cup or medal to
the player excelling in whatever line
is chosen for the competition. As to
whether a cup or medal will be pre
sented depends on the sentiment of
those interested. This prize will prob
ably be competed for beginning with
next season, as it is doubtful whether
it will be finished in time for presenta
tion this year.
In what department of the game the
award will be made has not as yet
been determined. General sentiment
seems to be that it should be awarded
for punting or touch finding profici
ency. The exponents of dribbling, and
tackling, and the other fine points of
the game all have a word to say i
regard to their favorite branch
sport, it does not seem pro' .lic
it will be offered for any
some branch of kicki*.
