A surprise came this afternox n w ith
the official announcement by i>> a ch
Presley of the 1911 Stanford Vars*v
which meets the rugby representatives,
of the University of California on
next Saturday. E. C. Woodcock
lias been chosen to play in the front
rank. After five years of consistent
work this steady player has won rugby
recognition. He has made an excel
lent reputation this year and won his
place through his ability to hook and
dribble. Noble won the position of
second five-eighths through steadiness
of play. He is not a brilliant player
but can be counted on under the most
trying conditions. He is a good pass
er, but his special ability lies in sure
and hard tackling.
As to the substitutes, there is no
surprise. Everyone won his place be
cause of ability, and a strong man is
ready for any vacancy that may be
created on the team. The side-line
men this fall make an unusually hardy
group of men.
