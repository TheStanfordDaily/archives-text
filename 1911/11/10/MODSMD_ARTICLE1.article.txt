# OPPOSING FIFTEENS READY TO DO BATTLE TOMORROW
## Review of Season's Rugby History at Each University Offers Material for Interesting Comparisons. 
### 
Two years ago California checked
the chain of defeats that the Cardinal
Varsities had been accustomed to give
her for six successive years, plus a tie,
and clearly superior, won from Stan
ford 011 her own field, by the score of
19 to 13. Last year she repeated the
performance on California field by a
still lavf-'fir sonrfi, that of 2"> tu 0.
According to the experts 011 the San
Francisco papers the rival teams are
pretty evenly matched this year, with
the odds slightly in favor of Califor
nia. This is supplemented by the
Betting Trust, who. through their
commissioner, Tom Corbett, announce
the odds on Saturday's contest as 10
to 6, with Stanford on the short end.
To listen to the report from the south
land the Cardinal hopes are already
embalmed and laid away with a third
defeat. Hut on the Stanford campus
another idea prevails. Not the feeling
of cocksure certainty, but the belief
in the work of Coach Presley and the
men that be has coached so faithfully
this season, and that the Cardinal will
turn the trick on Saturday and take a
well-deserved victory.
Propitious Beginning.
The rugby season had a propitious
opening. A wealth of material was
on hand for Coach Presley to mold a
forward division from, and the scrum
was practically decided in the first few
days. Card proved a find as Frank's
breakaway partner and the pair of
speedy rear rankers immediately took
their stride and solved this problem.
Then all anxiety was removed regard
ing the forward players. In the back
field but one vacancy was found. Who
should be Harrigan's five mate? Here
half a season was spent trying to solve

[ the problem. In Noble was found the
answer. Steadygoing, he is a sure
1 tackier and the position is safe in his
| hands.
A shift in the backfield was intro
\ duced as the se;ison matured and Cap
tain Erb, who had been playing at
center, was moved back 011 the wing
and Kern was brought to center.
Then the backfield had assumed its
permanency. From then on the team
played with admirable efficiency and
unity. No serious setbacks were ex-
I perienced in men being lost to the
Varsity through injuries such as the
loss of Kern and Schaupp last year,
j Only when the schedule was fast
j drawing to a close did minor injuries
to the stars creep in. But by this
time these men were in a high state
of perfection and their withdrawal
gave them a few days of needed rest
without the danger of their growing
stale. Everyone of the minor injured
j men is now in condition to enter the
game to-morrow.
California Outweighs Stanford.
California outweighs Stanford 5
pounds to the man, while in the scrum
she weighs 8 pounds to the player
more than the Cardinal. Stanford's
combined scrum weight is 141 <>%
pounds to the visitors 1475. The aver
age height of the two teams gives the
Blue and Gold an inch more for each
man than the Cardinal, Stanford aver
aging 5 feet, 10% inches to the Cali
fornians' 5:11%, In the ages there is
only the variation of one-third of a
year. Stanford has the only player
who is less than twenty years old.
The difference in weights is the widest
margin in years, especially in the
s-crum, though it is not so serious as

wculd at first appear. Last year
Coach Presley used the seven-man
scrum and the Blue and Cold had a
pushing advantage of 100 pounds with
t'leiv e'gh forwards. This year the
cross-bay pack will have a heft of
(! 1 prunds over the local collegians.

Now as to the season scores rolled

complete records of which are con
tained in another column, and a table
with the comparisons. The Barbari
an and Olympic aggregations make the
best combinations for judging the
merits of the teams. As to the
Winged-0 matches: these players have
been able to press the trans-bay col
legians as they have never been press
ed before; they have forced the Cali
fornians to withdraw to the defense
and have broken through their line for
several tries. This they have not done
against the Cardinals, where their
lone tally was gleaned from a penalty
kick for a meager three points in one

game and in the two others to draw
blank results. This statement, how
ever, has to be amended, in that in
the first game with the Californians
that the Olympics played, it seems
that the college fifteen was chiefly a
second team. This then, discards one
of the games from our figuring, and
the city clubmen may be said to have
tallied three points from each group;
from Stanford, three on a penalty
kick, and from California, three from
a try.
The Babarians tripled the score in
their cross-bay games that they made
in their visits to the local campus. In
two games here they took six points
to the local Varsity's 54. In Berkeley,
in three games, they annexed 17 to
their opponents' 45. The shifting line
ups of these city groups, which never
sent the same team against one col
lege that it sent against the other,
makes these figures unreliable. The
Olympics had the most regular fifteens
and the comparison of the scores
with them, as noted above, is very
close.
Both Blanked "Nevada.
Each university met the sagebrush
collegians once. Both blanked Neva
da. California rolled up 20 points
on a strange field, while Stanford, at
home, met the Plainsmen and improv
ed on the Blue and Gold score by
twelve points. This tells us little.
Nor can we find much to balance be
tween the two rivals in their games
with the Canadians. Stanford equal
led the California showing when the
Cardinal met the Dominion stars for
the initial contest. The last game saw
the local Varsity, of practically sec
ond team composition, take the only
defeat of the season from their hands.
California used her full force in each
of her two games with the Northern
invaders.
For a general statement, each Var
sity played nine games during the
past season. Stanford totaled 207
points and allowed visiting teams to
take 18. California netted 221 to
her all-season opponents' 17.
Taken all in ail, California should
win Saturday. Her scrum outweighs

the opposing pack eight pounds to
the man. Her veteran line of backs,
despite the loss of Dwiggins, is a great
ground gainer, an ever real danger
to the goal line. It is not that Cass,
Harrigan, Noble, Kern, Erb, and Geis
sler are poor rugby players; far from
it, but they have been shifted here and
there, they have been kept out of the
game through minor injuries; they are
strong, as individuals, but they lack
the perfection of team work that
makes the Blue and Gold backs so
hard to stop. California realizes the
game is going to be a hard fight from
the first whistle to the final gun, but
she expects to win through the greater
unity of action among the players
composing her team.
C. F. Laumeister, '07, will be the
Cardinal linesman and the flags for
California will be held by G. V. Bell,
captain of the 1908 Blue and Gold
Varsity. The two brothers, E. J.
Brown, U. C. '97, and D. E. Brown, S.
'97, will be the timekeepers for the
eleventh time.
Iteferee From Vancouver.
Again Canada will be called upon
to furnish a referee for the Inter
collegiate contest. T. E. D. Byrne, of
Vancouver, will be the extra man on
the field to-morrow. This is the first

time that Byrne has refereed a rugby
match in the United States, but he
conies highly ecommended.
