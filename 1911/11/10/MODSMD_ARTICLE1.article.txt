# OPPOSING FIFTEENS READY TO DO BATTLE TOMORROW
## Review of Season's Rugby History at Each University Offers Material for Interesting Comparisons. 
### 
Two years ago California checked
the chain of defeats that the Cardinal
Varsities had been accustomed to give
her for six successive years, plus a tie,
and clearly superior, won from Stan
ford 011 her own field, by the score of
19 to 13. Last year she repeated the
performance on California field by a
still lavf-'fir sonrfi, that of 2"> tu 0.
According to the experts 011 the San
Francisco papers the rival teams are
pretty evenly matched this year, with
the odds slightly in favor of Califor
nia. This is supplemented by the
Betting Trust, who. through their
commissioner, Tom Corbett, announce
the odds on Saturday's contest as 10
to 6, with Stanford on the short end.
To listen to the report from the south
land the Cardinal hopes are already
embalmed and laid away with a third
defeat. Hut on the Stanford campus
another idea prevails. Not the feeling
of cocksure certainty, but the belief
in the work of Coach Presley and the
men that be has coached so faithfully
this season, and that the Cardinal will
turn the trick on Saturday and take a
well-deserved victory.
Propitious Beginning.
The rugby season had a propitious
opening. A wealth of material was
on hand for Coach Presley to mold a
forward division from, and the scrum
was practically decided in the first few
days. Card proved a find as Frank's
breakaway partner and the pair of
speedy rear rankers immediately took
their stride and solved this problem.
Then all anxiety was removed regard
ing the forward players. In the back
field but one vacancy was found. Who
should be Harrigan's five mate? Here
half a season was spent trying to solve

[ the problem. In Noble was found the
answer. Steadygoing, he is a sure
1 tackier and the position is safe in his
| hands.
A shift in the backfield was intro
\ duced as the se;ison matured and Cap
tain Erb, who had been playing at
center, was moved back 011 the wing
and Kern was brought to center.
Then the backfield had assumed its
permanency. From then on the team
played with admirable efficiency and
unity. No serious setbacks were ex-
I perienced in men being lost to the
Varsity through injuries such as the
loss of Kern and Schaupp last year,
j Only when the schedule was fast
j drawing to a close did minor injuries
to the stars creep in. But by this
time these men were in a high state
of perfection and their withdrawal
gave them a few days of needed rest
without the danger of their growing
stale. Everyone of the minor injured
j men is now in condition to enter the
game to-morrow.
California Outweighs Stanford.
California outweighs Stanford 5
pounds to the man, while in the scrum
she weighs 8 pounds to the player
more than the Cardinal. Stanford's
combined scrum weight is 141 <>%
pounds to the visitors 1475. The aver
age height of the two teams gives the
Blue and Gold an inch more for each
man than the Cardinal, Stanford aver
aging 5 feet, 10% inches to the Cali
fornians' 5:11%, In the ages there is
only the variation of one-third of a
year. Stanford has the only player
who is less than twenty years old.
The difference in weights is the widest
margin in years, especially in the
s-crum, though it is not so serious as

wculd at first appear. Last year
Coach Presley used the seven-man
scrum and the Blue and Cold had a
pushing advantage of 100 pounds with
t'leiv e'gh forwards. This year the
cross-bay pack will have a heft of
(! 1 prunds over the local collegians.
