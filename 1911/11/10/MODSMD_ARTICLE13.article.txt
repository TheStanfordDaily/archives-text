Those California veterans have
been mighty troublesome to Stanford
since Cedric Cerf led them to victory
and the subsequent serpentine on
Stanford field. They commenced their
victorious march at the expense of a
fouth year veteran team, and there is
a grain of comfort for the Cardinal
rooter in the hope that they, like so
many of their predecessors, may bite
the dust against less experienced but
younger opponents.
♦ Both coaches have done their work
except for a final talk to the men be
fore entering the field, and it is up
to the thirty Varsity players to work
out their own salvation. This is es
pecially the case in Rugby, where
every man has to depend on his own
skill rather than that of the coach
who is omnipotent in the old game.
Only one surprise was sprung in
the announcement of the teams, this
being the substitution of Woodcock
for Haley, but those with their ears
closest to the ground anticipated this
move, as the Portland student has
been showing wonderful improvement
in the latest games and finally won
out after a strenuous practice earlier
in the week.
The game promises to be one of
the most keenly contested exhibitions
of Rugby ever seen on the Pacific
Coast, and I, for one, am very diffi
dent of attempting to pick a winner.
The Stanford players have suffered
to a great extent in the preliminary
games through injury, and, unfortu
nately, in most cases the men removed
to the hospital for temporary repairs
have been rated as stars of the team.
Captain Erb, Louis Cass, Ted Geis
sler, A1 Frank, Kenny Dole, and Floyd
Brown, have been the principal suffer
ers, and, though every one of these
players have been given their walking
papers from the hospital, and pro
nounced fit, it remains to be seen
whether they can go through SO min
utes of the most strenuous action of
their athletic career without the slip
ping of a cog. This leaves the ques
tion open whether the Stanford team
will enter the field at its best, but,
accepting this as a fact, let us look at
the two fifteens.
The California Varsity team is made
up largely of veterans, who have elec
trified the fans with their brilliant
passing rallies in the backfield. A
year ago the backs were undoubtedly
at their best and they have never yet
shown this season the same class as
they did in 1910. On the other hand,
the Cardinal backs are infinitely bet
ter behind the scrum than they were
last season. Geissler and Haralgan
were Freshman members of that team
and, though they fought pluckily, it
was a losing fight throughout and
they did as well as could be expected
from them. But today a different
story will have to be told of the two
! Southerners, who bear all the ear
marks of class and can take care of
themselves in any company. Harri
gan is today one of the most accurate
punters on the Pacific Coast and his
kicking is one of the features of
every game in which he participates.
(Teissier is considered the best winger
and is certainly in a class by himself
as an opportunist. With this pair of
brilliant players added to the veterans,
the equalizing process of the two
back divisions draws nearer.
Chet Allen is paid the tribute by
all critics of being the best scattered
field runner playing Rugby today and
the Blue and Gold players are relying
mainly on this player's work and the
work of Captain Elliott to carry their
colors to victory. Elliott made a poor
beginning this year but in his last
game gave promise of reaching his
best form and as he has always figured
such a big factor in previous inter
collegiate contests, it is easy to Im
agine what a critical position he oc
cupies for his team. Without Elliott
at his best the California backs will
not be given any opportunities to fig
ure in their brilliant dashes but the
team, with Elliott working like Elliott,
is a formidable proposition. The Car
dinal backs are all clever hooters and

figure quite a big margin over their
rivals who however discount this ad
vantage by their clever passing rallies.
The fight between the two packs
figures to be a close one. The Blue
and Gold front rankers, by virtue of
their larger, experience, are given a
shade over the Stanford men and the
giant pair of Cardinals in the middle
ranks are considered better than the
California pair. Schaupp, the Stan
ford lock, is the strongest man on the
team and King, his vis a vis, is the
heaviest. Pauly and Swartz, two of
the cleverest forwards on the Coast
in the loose must be given preference
over Frank and Card, but the work
of the latter pair has been one or the
most pleasing features of the prep
season at Stanford, (lard is easily
the fastest forward on the Coast and
his short experience in the back field
has helped him considerably in hand
ling the ball in passing bouts. Frank,
if sound, is well above the average as
a breakaway.
Making a forecast of the winner
this year is much more difficult to
me than it seems to be for other
Uugbv critics, who apparently figure
a walkover for California. This will
no doubt be true if Captain Erb and
some of his star cripples have not
recovered from their injuries suffi
ciently to stand a gruelling game;
otherwise I throw up my hands and
expect luck and the breaks to furnish
the victor.

item in holding the scrum together,
and during the season King has been
taught how to use those pounds so
that they may do the most good.
Pauly and Swartz play the break
aways, and their work has been one of
the features of the games played so
far. Pauly is a shifty dribbler, an
expert at leading rushes, and one of
the cleverest men in the loose on the
Pacific Coast today. Swartz is a com
bination of the forward and back, and
fltarts dribbling or passing rushes
with equal facility. These men weigh
17(5 and 160 pounds, respectively, and
therefore are not only invaluable in
loose work, but pull down the scrum
average only a few pounds.
Morris at halfback is small and fast,
and has mastered a pass that allows
him to get the ball out more quickly
than any other half in either univer
sity. Like practically the entire back
field. he is a veteran, and the first cog
in a scoring machine that lias worked
as a unit until every man has come in
to perfect harmony with his fellows.
Captain Elliott is undoubtedly the
best first five on the coast. His pass
ing and receiving are too well known
to need further comment, to gay
nothing of the ground he gains by
picking holes between the scrum and
backs. Stroud at outside five shines
especially on the defensive, but getv
the ball out well to the three-quarters
line, and is himself a good ground
gainer.

Allen, at center three, is one of the
shiftiest players on either team, won
derfully clever at passing and dodg
ing. Watts knows the game from the
ground up and is a fast player with
a good boot. His injured knee kept
him out of some of the preliminary
games, but he is now playing in the
form that, has made him a fixture
on the team for the last three years.
A problem is presented by the posi
tions of the other wing and fullback.
I'eart is a sure man in either place,
a strong scoring factor on the wing,
a strong defensive man at full. His
long boots to touch make him especi
ally valuable on the-V.TitT of
fense. IV.it Evans, though a hard
worker and a good man, is not up to
the standard of the rest of the backs,
and can not equal Peart's work at
wing. On the other hand, Price is a
good fullback, but light for the posi
tion, and handicapped through being
kept from practice by an injury for
the last few games. The freshman
Bcgardus has played the position in
some of the contests, hut hardly has
the speed or experience to make good
in a Vasity game.
However, these places may be filled,
California will be weaker than last,
vra • here, either through a less effi
clent three-quarers line or a more un-
fullback.

out after a strenuous practice earlier
in the week.
The game promises to be one of
the most keenly contested exhibitions
of Rugby ever seen on the Pacific
Coast, and I, for one, am very diffi
dent of attempting to pick a winner.
The Stanford players have suffered
to a great extent in the preliminary
games through injury, and, unfortu
nately, in most cases the men removed
to the hospital for temporary repairs
have been rated as stars of the team.
Captain Erb, Louis Cass, Ted Geis

players have been given their walking
papers from the hospital, and pro

whether they can go through SO min
utes of the most strenuous action of
their athletic career without the slip
ping of a cog. This leaves the ques
tion open whether the Stanford team
will enter the field at its best, but,
accepting this as a fact, let us look at
the two fifteens.
The California Varsity team is made
up largely of veterans, who have elec
trified the fans with their brilliant
passing rallies in the backfield. A
year ago the backs were undoubtedly
at their best and they have never yet
shown this season the same class as
they did in 1910. On the other hand,
the Cardinal backs are infinitely bet
ter behind the scrum than they were
last season. Geissler and Haralgan
were Freshman members of that team
and, though they fought pluckily, it
was a losing fight throughout and
they did as well as could be expected
from them. But today a different
story will have to be told of the two
! Southerners, who bear all the ear
marks of class and can take care of
themselves in any company. Harri
gan is today one of the most accurate
punters on the Pacific Coast and his
kicking is one of the features of
every game in which he participates.
(Teissier is considered the best winger
and is certainly in a class by himself
as an opportunist. With this pair of
brilliant players added to the veterans,
the equalizing process of the two
back divisions draws nearer.
Chet Allen is paid the tribute by
all critics of being the best scattered
field runner playing Rugby today and
the Blue and Gold players are relying
mainly on this player's work and the
work of Captain Elliott to carry their
colors to victory. Elliott made a poor
beginning this year but in his last
game gave promise of reaching his
best form and as he has always figured
such a big factor in previous inter
collegiate contests, it is easy to Im
agine what a critical position he oc
cupies for his team. Without Elliott
at his best the California backs will
not be given any opportunities to fig
ure in their brilliant dashes but the
team, with Elliott working like Elliott,
is a formidable proposition. The Car
dinal backs are all clever hooters and

figure quite a big margin over their
rivals who however discount this ad
vantage by their clever passing rallies.
The fight between the two packs
figures to be a close one. The Blue
and Gold front rankers, by virtue of
their larger, experience, are given a
shade over the Stanford men and the
giant pair of Cardinals in the middle
ranks are considered better than the
California pair. Schaupp, the Stan
ford lock, is the strongest man on the
team and King, his vis a vis, is the
heaviest. Pauly and Swartz, two of
the cleverest forwards on the Coast
in the loose must be given preference
over Frank and Card, but the work
of the latter pair has been one or the
most pleasing features of the prep
season at Stanford, (lard is easily
the fastest forward on the Coast and
his short experience in the back field
has helped him considerably in hand
ling the ball in passing bouts. Frank,
if sound, is well above the average as
a breakaway.
Making a forecast of the winner
this year is much more difficult to
me than it seems to be for other
Uugbv critics, who apparently figure
a walkover for California. This will
no doubt be true if Captain Erb and
some of his star cripples have not
recovered from their injuries suffi
ciently to stand a gruelling game;
otherwise I throw up my hands and
expect luck and the breaks to furnish
the victor.

fltarts dribbling or passing rushes
with equal facility. These men weigh
17(5 and 160 pounds, respectively, and
therefore are not only invaluable in
loose work, but pull down the scrum
average only a few pounds.
Morris at halfback is small and fast,
and has mastered a pass that allows
him to get the ball out more quickly
than any other half in either univer
sity. Like practically the entire back
field. he is a veteran, and the first cog
in a scoring machine that lias worked
as a unit until every man has come in
to perfect harmony with his fellows.
Captain Elliott is undoubtedly the
best first five on the coast. His pass
ing and receiving are too well known
to need further comment, to gay
nothing of the ground he gains by
picking holes between the scrum and
backs. Stroud at outside five shines
especially on the defensive, but getv
the ball out well to the three-quarters
line, and is himself a good ground
gainer.

out after a strenuous practice earlier
in the week.
The game promises to be one of
the most keenly contested exhibitions
of Rugby ever seen on the Pacific
Coast, and I, for one, am very diffi
dent of attempting to pick a winner.
The Stanford players have suffered
to a great extent in the preliminary
games through injury, and, unfortu

to the hospital for temporary repairs
have been rated as stars of the team.
Captain Erb, Louis Cass, Ted Geis

whether they can go through SO min

their athletic career without the slip
ping of a cog. This leaves the ques
tion open whether the Stanford team
will enter the field at its best, but,
accepting this as a fact, let us look at
the two fifteens.
The California Varsity team is made
up largely of veterans, who have elec
trified the fans with their brilliant
passing rallies in the backfield. A
year ago the backs were undoubtedly
at their best and they have never yet
shown this season the same class as
they did in 1910. On the other hand,
the Cardinal backs are infinitely bet
ter behind the scrum than they were
last season. Geissler and Haralgan
were Freshman members of that team
and, though they fought pluckily, it
was a losing fight throughout and
they did as well as could be expected
from them. But today a different
story will have to be told of the two
! Southerners, who bear all the ear
marks of class and can take care of
themselves in any company. Harri
gan is today one of the most accurate
punters on the Pacific Coast and his
kicking is one of the features of
every game in which he participates.
(Teissier is considered the best winger
and is certainly in a class by himself
as an opportunist. With this pair of
brilliant players added to the veterans,
the equalizing process of the two
back divisions draws nearer.
Chet Allen is paid the tribute by
all critics of being the best scattered
field runner playing Rugby today and
the Blue and Gold players are relying
mainly on this player's work and the
work of Captain Elliott to carry their
colors to victory. Elliott made a poor
beginning this year but in his last
game gave promise of reaching his
best form and as he has always figured
such a big factor in previous inter
collegiate contests, it is easy to Im
agine what a critical position he oc
cupies for his team. Without Elliott
at his best the California backs will
not be given any opportunities to fig
ure in their brilliant dashes but the
team, with Elliott working like Elliott,
is a formidable proposition. The Car
dinal backs are all clever hooters and

figure quite a big margin over their
rivals who however discount this ad
vantage by their clever passing rallies.
The fight between the two packs
figures to be a close one. The Blue
and Gold front rankers, by virtue of
their larger, experience, are given a
shade over the Stanford men and the
giant pair of Cardinals in the middle
ranks are considered better than the
California pair. Schaupp, the Stan
ford lock, is the strongest man on the
team and King, his vis a vis, is the
heaviest. Pauly and Swartz, two of
the cleverest forwards on the Coast
in the loose must be given preference
over Frank and Card, but the work
of the latter pair has been one or the
most pleasing features of the prep
season at Stanford, (lard is easily
the fastest forward on the Coast and
his short experience in the back field
has helped him considerably in hand
ling the ball in passing bouts. Frank,
if sound, is well above the average as
a breakaway.
Making a forecast of the winner
this year is much more difficult to
me than it seems to be for other
Uugbv critics, who apparently figure
a walkover for California. This will
no doubt be true if Captain Erb and
some of his star cripples have not
recovered from their injuries suffi
ciently to stand a gruelling game;
otherwise I throw up my hands and
expect luck and the breaks to furnish
the victor.

and during the season King has been
taught how to use those pounds so
that they may do the most good.
Pauly and Swartz play the break
aways, and their work has been one of
the features of the games played so
far. Pauly is a shifty dribbler, an
expert at leading rushes, and one of
the cleverest men in the loose on the
Pacific Coast today. Swartz is a com
bination of the forward and back, and
fltarts dribbling or passing rushes
with equal facility. These men weigh
17(5 and 160 pounds, respectively, and
therefore are not only invaluable in
loose work, but pull down the scrum
average only a few pounds.

a walkover for California. This will
no doubt be true if Captain Erb and
some of his star cripples have not
recovered from their injuries suffi
ciently to stand a gruelling game;
otherwise I throw up my hands and
expect luck and the breaks to furnish
the victor.

item in holding the scrum together,
and during the season King has been
taught how to use those pounds so
that they may do the most good.
Pauly and Swartz play the break
aways, and their work has been one of
the features of the games played so
far. Pauly is a shifty dribbler, an
expert at leading rushes, and one of
the cleverest men in the loose on the
Pacific Coast today. Swartz is a com
bination of the forward and back, and
fltarts dribbling or passing rushes
with equal facility. These men weigh
17(5 and 160 pounds, respectively, and
therefore are not only invaluable in
loose work, but pull down the scrum
average only a few pounds.
Morris at halfback is small and fast,
and has mastered a pass that allows
him to get the ball out more quickly
than any other half in either univer
sity. Like practically the entire back
field. he is a veteran, and the first cog
in a scoring machine that lias worked
as a unit until every man has come in
to perfect harmony with his fellows.
Captain Elliott is undoubtedly the
best first five on the coast. His pass
ing and receiving are too well known
to need further comment, to gay
nothing of the ground he gains by
picking holes between the scrum and
backs. Stroud at outside five shines
especially on the defensive, but getv
the ball out well to the three-quarters
line, and is himself a good ground
gainer.

Allen, at center three, is one of the
shiftiest players on either team, won
derfully clever at passing and dodg
ing. Watts knows the game from the
ground up and is a fast player with
a good boot. His injured knee kept
him out of some of the preliminary
games, but he is now playing in the
form that, has made him a fixture
on the team for the last three years.
A problem is presented by the posi
tions of the other wing and fullback.
I'eart is a sure man in either place,
a strong scoring factor on the wing,
a strong defensive man at full. His
long boots to touch make him especi
ally valuable on the-V.TitT of
fense. IV.it Evans, though a hard
worker and a good man, is not up to
the standard of the rest of the backs,
and can not equal Peart's work at
wing. On the other hand, Price is a
good fullback, but light for the posi
tion, and handicapped through being
kept from practice by an injury for
the last few games. The freshman
Bcgardus has played the position in
some of the contests, hut hardly has
the speed or experience to make good
in a Vasity game.
However, these places may be filled,
California will be weaker than last,
vra • here, either through a less effi
clent three-quarers line or a more un-
fullback.
