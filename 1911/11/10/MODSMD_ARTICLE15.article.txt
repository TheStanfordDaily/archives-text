# CLAIMS THAT TEAM WORK WILL BEING VICTORY.
## Sporting Writer on Daily Californian Tells Fine Points of Cross-Bay Team. 
### J.L. Simpson, U.C., '13 
California's expectations of winning
the intercollegiate rugby game Satur
day are based not merely on the loyal
ty which prompts each university to
look for victory, but upon an actual
comparison of the relative merits of
the two teams. It is not claimed that
the Blue and Gold is so far superior
to the Cardinal as to eliminate all
shadow of a doubt. Those who have
followed the two teams through that
past season well know that Stanford
will send a formidable aggregation on
the field and prophesy no overwhelm
ing score. But, taking the opposing
players man for man and judging
them as impartially as is possible for
one whose interests are centered on
one side, the advantage seems clearly
to rest with California.
The general opinion throughout the
preliminary games has marked Cali
fornia as an easy favorite, and this
sentiment has been carried much far
ther than circumstances warrant. One
of the stock remarks is that the Blue
and Gold forwards are inferior to
Stanford's, but that the wonderful cork
of the backfield more than offsets this
handicap. Probably such a statement
lias a large element of truth in it, but
it fails utterly to describe fully the
real situation: to point out the strong
points of the scrum which will jour
ney to Palo Alto, Saturday, to give
credit to the breakaways for their re
markably clever work all season, and
to show the weakness which the loss
of Dwiggins will occasion no matter
how the positions of fullback and win'.?
are finally adjsuted.
In all liklihood the two Phlegers and
Carpenter will play the front rank in
the Blue and Gold scrum. C. A. Phle
ger is competing for the fourth time,
and is a hard, consistent, experienced
player. Carpenter is also a "C" man.
11. H. Pleger, at the position of num
ber two, has had considerable exper
ience as substitute and is an extremely
clever backer. This front rank out
weighs by two pounds to the man any
opposing two Stanford is apt to send
in.
Hardy and Hansen at side rank are
both hard workers and have played the
game for years. Hardy, in particular,
is a fast forward and has taken part
in two Varsity games. Hansen
weighs two hundred pounds even, and
both these men use their weight and
size to good advantage in backing up
the front rank. This is not an attempt
to show a superiority over Dole, of
whose work too much can not be
said, but to make it clear that side
rank is no "weak spot" in the scrum.
King at lock is green timber and
Schaupp may be conceded to outplay
Mm. But 210 pounds are no small
