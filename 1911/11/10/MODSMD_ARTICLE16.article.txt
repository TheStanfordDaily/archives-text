# WRITES THAT TEAM WORK WILL CAPTURE GAME.
## Stanford Man and Referee Thinks Season's Injuries Will Work Hardship for Cardinal. 
### W.P. Fuller, Jr 
If good luck had followed Stanford
from the beginning to the end of the
present football season, she would
still have a difficult task to get the
better of her opponents next Saturday.
Accordingly, with bad luck on her
heels from start to finish, the chances
are most distinctly not bright. Even
though every man on the injured list
is able to go into Saturday's game,
still the team as a whole will suffer
immeasurably because of the various
recent shake-ups occasioned by mis
haps and the consequent loss of com
bined practice to the fifteen finally
chosen.
Stanford has not developed a back
field that could be called a strong
scoring machine, and consequently
her greatest hope lies in the possibility
of a small-score contest.
On the other hand, the Blue and
Gold have a set of veteran backs un
usually powerful on attack. Although
it seemed for a time that despite their
individual ability these backs were
not "getting together" as they did
during 3910, that impression has been
dispelled by their most recent efforts,
the California backfield, having, ap
parently, "come to life'' simultaneous
ly. Throughout the season the Cali
fornia attack has succeeded in getting
started more swiftly than has Stan
ford's, and should this advantage ob
tain on Saturday, it will go hard with
the Cardinal, as there is no more im
portant element in offensive play.
On defense, the two backflelds ap
pear far more evenly matched. In
fact, if each had the same attack to
repel, Stanford might have a shade
the Letter of the argument, provided
always that half-healed injuries do
not prevail among the Cardinal backs.
Forward, the game should be a close
fight and a pretty one. Granting the
California hookers a possible superi
ority, the writer looks for the remain
der of the Stanford scrum to at least
even matters up. Both scrums follow
the ball well. Neither has much to
boast in the matter of combined drib
bling, while individually Stanford is
probably the more fortunate.
It's mighty hard to say it, hut-
California figures to win.
