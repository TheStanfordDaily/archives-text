# ROOTERS YELL FOR FIFTEEN MINUTES AT BIG RALLY
## Unparalleled Enthusiasm Greets Arrival of Varsity and Coach Presley at Assembly Hall Last Evening. 
### 
For fifteen minutes the Cardinal
mad enthusiasts, standing 011 the back
of the seats, rocked back and forth,
yelling and chanting their welcome
to the 1911 Varsity and substitutes
at the send off Rally, in the Assembly
flail last evening. Above their heads
vari-colored strips of paper shot out
and fell gently over the rugby players,
as the tributes of the fair rooters in
the galleries.
"The streaming paper tape fell on
that howling mass in the pit, like the
tape from a stock broker's ticker tell
ing of the soaring of stock in the Var
sity and a prediction of a corner in
the rugby contest on Saturday by
Stanford," was the statement of an on
looker.
As Encina Club came lining in, full
three hundred strong, the noise began.
As soon as they were seated the Yell-
Leaders called for the first Varsity
and the curtains were parted as the
Stanford Band pealed forth a stirring
march. A few minutes later the
middle door of the Hall was thrown
open and the team and substitutes
entered. Simultaneosuly they were
greeted with the thunderous acclama
tion of the expectant rooters. Three
times the men stood up in their seats,
swaying and yelling. Fearing that
the enthusiasts would break down the
seats, as they swayed back and forth,
the Yell Leaders tried to check the
outburst but they only succeeded in
making the uproar worse. Finally
the audience was quieted for the or
ganized cheering, but the call for a
skyrocket for Coach Presley sent the
Cardinal supporters up on their seats
again, to pay tribute to their rugby
coach.

Professer P. J. Treat, the first,
speaker of the evening, said, in part,
"We have a certain kind of confidence.
The kind we feel is that the team
we have this year is worthy of the
best Stanford traditions. I mean, men
who are going to fight hard and
clean. We have confidence that Ben
nie Erb is fit to captain that team.
We have confidence in "Dad" Moul
ton. In Presley we have a man who
has fairly inherited that mantle that
Lanagan has left him. We may be
lieve him to be without a peer in the
game."
Dr. T. M. Williams, '97, spoke next.
"Men who have made good 011 the
Stanford football field, have, in the
majority of cases, made good," said
the former half of the old game. Then
to the team, "Meet Berkeley 011 Satur
day with the smile that shows the steel
beneath and by the end of the day
they will know the depth of the Stan
ford spirit."
"Billie" Erb said, "We have a re
markable way of doing things, at
Stanford, when we have to. They have
been disappointed so often, up there in
the city, in hearing that you have a
losing team down here and then come
down here to witness a Stanford vic
tory that rumors don't fool them any
longer."
"Dad" Moulton was the next talker.
"I believe the condition of the team is
letter than last year's," said the veter
an trainer. "All of the men are in
good physical condition and we have
never had a. better fighting team ready
to go onto the field. We certainly
have an even break."
Coach Presley was the last speaker
of the evening. "In the first place,"
said the coach, "I want to express my
appreciation of the men on the second
team who have shown so much sacri
fice, sand and spirit to stand the hard
knocks that come to those who play on
the fifteen that opposes the Varsity
in the practice games during the sea
son."
"The men on this year's Varsity,"
continued Presley, "deserve to win.
They have worked in a self-sacrificing
and willing spirit and they are as
fine a bunch of fighters as we have
ever had. The Student Body spirit is
the best since I have been here. The
effect will be seen in the work of the
men 011 the field Saturday. The men
do not underestimate Berkeley. They
know that they have got to fight.
They are going to fight with that de
termined spirit that they have got to
win and wipe out the defeats of the
past two years.
Then followed the whirling serpen
tine around the "cardinal" fire on the
Inner Quad. As the flames of the
monster bonfire, built by the Fresh
men, lit the eastern sky, the serpentine
was transferred to the gymnasium
field, where the residents of the red
tiled principality of the Stanford's
brought to a close by the singing of
the University hymn one of the most
wonderful football rallies in the his
tory of Stanford.

"The men on this year's Varsity,"
continued Presley, "deserve to win.
They have worked in a self-sacrificing
and willing spirit and they are as
fine a bunch of fighters as we have
ever had. The Student Body spirit is
the best since I have been here. The
effect will be seen in the work of the
men 011 the field Saturday. The men
do not underestimate Berkeley. They
know that they have got to fight.
They are going to fight with that de
termined spirit that they have got to
win and wipe out the defeats of the
past two years.
Then followed the whirling serpen
tine around the "cardinal" fire on the
Inner Quad. As the flames of the
monster bonfire, built by the Fresh
men, lit the eastern sky, the serpentine
was transferred to the gymnasium
field, where the residents of the red
tiled principality of the Stanford's
brought to a close by the singing of
the University hymn one of the most
wonderful football rallies in the his
tory of Stanford.
For fifteen minutes the Cardinal
mad enthusiasts, standing 011 the back
of the seats, rocked back and forth,
yelling and chanting their welcome
to the 1911 Varsity and substitutes
at the send off Rally, in the Assembly
flail last evening. Above their heads
vari-colored strips of paper shot out
and fell gently over the rugby players,
as the tributes of the fair rooters in
the galleries.
"The streaming paper tape fell on
that howling mass in the pit, like the
tape from a stock broker's ticker tell
ing of the soaring of stock in the Var
sity and a prediction of a corner in
the rugby contest on Saturday by
Stanford," was the statement of an on
looker.
As Encina Club came lining in, full
three hundred strong, the noise began.
As soon as they were seated the Yell-
Leaders called for the first Varsity
and the curtains were parted as the
Stanford Band pealed forth a stirring
march. A few minutes later the
middle door of the Hall was thrown
open and the team and substitutes
entered. Simultaneosuly they were
greeted with the thunderous acclama
tion of the expectant rooters. Three
times the men stood up in their seats,
swaying and yelling. Fearing that
the enthusiasts would break down the
seats, as they swayed back and forth,
the Yell Leaders tried to check the
outburst but they only succeeded in
making the uproar worse. Finally
the audience was quieted for the or
ganized cheering, but the call for a
skyrocket for Coach Presley sent the
Cardinal supporters up on their seats
again, to pay tribute to their rugby
coach.

Professer P. J. Treat, the first,
speaker of the evening, said, in part,
"We have a certain kind of confidence.
The kind we feel is that the team
we have this year is worthy of the
best Stanford traditions. I mean, men
who are going to fight hard and
clean. We have confidence that Ben
nie Erb is fit to captain that team.
We have confidence in "Dad" Moul
ton. In Presley we have a man who
has fairly inherited that mantle that
Lanagan has left him. We may be
lieve him to be without a peer in the
game."
Dr. T. M. Williams, '97, spoke next.
"Men who have made good 011 the
Stanford football field, have, in the
majority of cases, made good," said
the former half of the old game. Then
to the team, "Meet Berkeley 011 Satur
day with the smile that shows the steel
beneath and by the end of the day
they will know the depth of the Stan
ford spirit."
"Billie" Erb said, "We have a re
markable way of doing things, at
Stanford, when we have to. They have
been disappointed so often, up there in
the city, in hearing that you have a
losing team down here and then come
down here to witness a Stanford vic
tory that rumors don't fool them any
longer."
"Dad" Moulton was the next talker.
"I believe the condition of the team is
letter than last year's," said the veter
an trainer. "All of the men are in
good physical condition and we have
never had a. better fighting team ready
to go onto the field. We certainly
have an even break."
Coach Presley was the last speaker
of the evening. "In the first place,"
said the coach, "I want to express my
appreciation of the men on the second
team who have shown so much sacri
fice, sand and spirit to stand the hard
knocks that come to those who play on
the fifteen that opposes the Varsity
in the practice games during the sea
son."
"The men on this year's Varsity,"
