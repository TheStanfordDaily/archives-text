# The 						Stanford Team.
## 
### 
To-morrow's football game has been
looked at from every angle by writers
in all parts of the country, and the

outcome forecasted
with the advantage to
one side or the other.
But, when everything

is said and all prophecies made, it is
the team that we look at, and in this
case, the Stanford team. May every
man be a hero to-morrow, and, win or
lose, we are with them. After all, the
California game is a means, not an
end. If good sportsmanship rules both
sides, and the contest is hard and well
fought, winning is only an
stimulus.
The California team are hard fight
ers and good sportsmen. Let the
Stanford supporters remember that
there are good men and true on both
sides. May the best team win. More
over, We Need the Union.
