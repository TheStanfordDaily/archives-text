# The
						Football Show.
## 
### 
11l order that there may not be a
repetition of what occurred at the
Junior Opera last spring, we wish to
make an especial appeal tonight that

the Football Show
should not be inter
fered with in any
way. The chorus

work, particularly, requires much diffi
cult management, and it is necessary
that the acts have all the opportunity
possible for making the performance
successful. Moreover, We Need the
Union.
