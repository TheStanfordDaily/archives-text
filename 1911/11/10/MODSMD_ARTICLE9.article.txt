# CARDINAL SHOULD HAVE SLIGHT SCRUM ADVANTAGE.
## Steady Playing of Backfield Has Not Been Paralleled by Blue and Gold. 
### I.I. Ingraham, '13 
Stanford is fortunate in having the
best balanced team to send into the
field tomorrow that has ever lined up
for the Cardinal since the inception
of rugby on the coast. Not a weak
spot is to be found in the lineup, fore
or aft. Injuries found their way into
the lineup and tore a hole in the Car
dinal line when they went against the
British Columbians a week ago. But
none of these were of a serious nature
and all of the men are in fit condition
to meet California tomorrow. In each
case the men were in such excellent
training that the rest should be a
positive good rather than negative.
If California has an advantage it will
be through injuries that may befall the
Cardinal players during the game.
The seven-man scrum formation,
with the wing forward roaming as a
free lance, wad used by the Cardinal
Varsities in the last two matches
with California. This year the eight
man formation has been adopted and
used since the first practice this sea
son. For this formation we have a
great set of men, equal in all respects
tA the Blue and Gold aggregation.
In the hooking of their forwards - i.ey
should have a slight advantage, but
in following up and dribbling the Car
dinal has the better of the bargain.
In the lineouts California has 110 man
so adept at getting up after the ball
as Dole. The speed trials between the
opposing breakaways promise some
strong competition. Pauly and Swartz
are famous at this, but in the Frank-
Card duet they will at least meet their
match. Both pairs are speed burners
and handle the leathern oval like
backs. The aggressiveness of Schaupp
will outclass the California lock, King.
The Cardinal backfield has proved a
strong unit, 011 either the defensive or
aggressive, and their steady playing has
not been paralleled by the backs acoss
the bay. The visitors have a veteran
playing at half in the person of Morris,
but ne h;is not been a consistent top
notch performer and during the past
week a substitue half, McMahon, has
been added to their training table. lie
may be used during the entire game.
A similar position faces the Blue and
Gold at full. After many trials of
rather mediorcre men, Peart has been
selected to fill the bill. He is an un
certain quantity.
Harrigan will have to cope with El
liott. The Cardinal first five is a
sturdy player, quick to act and never
losing his head. His work has been
constantly improving and he will
prove a worthy opponent for the bril
liant Blue and Gold captain. In
Noble there is a wealth of solid rugby
material that has stood the strain of
a Varsity season and he will be a flaw
less link in the Cardinal machine.
Kern's ability will be matched against
Allen and he certainly has an even
break to take the laurels from the
clever Californian. The Erb-Geissler
wing unit should prove the strongest
on the team and will give Watts and
Evans plenty of excitement. Watts
will be a danger at all times, and is
considered by many to be the star
among the California players. Brown
at full will have things all his own
way. 'I he confidence that Brown in
stills in the team when he is in the !
game brings out the best possible re- j
suits. It would cause little surprise J
among the Stanford contingent to see
Brown bag a goal or so.
