# "FOLLIES OF STANFORD" CHEERS UP BIG CROWD
## SCORES BIG HET DESPITE THE GENERAL DEPRESSION. Originality of Words, Music and Action Marks Success of Football Show. 
### L.L. Hill, '11 
It was just two years ago tonight [
that Stanford, with the versatile
"Geoff." Morgan at thp wheel, made
its first plunge into vaudeville. The
initial leap was a successful one. The
memory of Parmer Fuller and his
Beauty Chorus in "Hello People" and
"Cupid's Telephone" is still a delight
to us.
Hut of those who saw that show,
how many dreamed that two years
later we would not only he putting on
vaudeville, hut be putting on our own
vaudeville. There wasn't an original
act in the 1909 Football Show. In the
1911 show there wasn't an act which
was not original. Stanford is surely
in her ' Golden Age" of dramatic pro
duction'. The progress of the past
two years in creative work lias been
remarkable. The Forbes-McDonald-
I!e:dman regime is illustrious.
No new play winning over a crowd
of first-nighters had a harder task
i t achieved a great triumph than did
th" "Follies of Stanford." A critical |
crowd is at least interested. The
audience in Assembly Hall was not
critical. It was depressed—it was
out of. s?pirit3—indifferent. It came
from Stanford Field bearing the men
tal burden of "three straight." To the
c edit o the "Follies" it went home
i ) a much more cheerful and hopeful
mood.
The major portion of credit for Sat
urday night's success of course goes to
.1 H. Forbes '1'?. The Executive Com
mittee could not have put the manage
ment and the c aching into better
hands than his. r i hore was a great
deal of serious work to l e done in a
short time, and Forbes, with the able
cc-one. itinn < 112 .1. L. McDonald '14,
did it. The show could not have been
the great success that it was without
the invaluable aid of the latter, for
M-c D-o-v.-a-l-d spoils originality.
"Follies of Stanford" was not only
rrent've in ith originality. It "brought
cut" a lot of new talent. New reputa
tions were made. Parmer Fuller at
last has a successor in "Brick"
S 'okiv H. H. I/isky had a chance
to show what he could do and made a
hit. His work was original in its
creation and its presentation. We
li t'e realized what a lot of clever
individual dancers we have until
Saturday night Terpischore ought to
feel as much at home here as in her
classical abode.
J. 11. Forbes was uniformly first
class in all of his work. Both he and
Vi-n Coleman scored, especially in
' l) ;n't He Angry With Me," and his
turn with the "Twins" in "Honest
People—Ain't it Fierce" was very
pleasing. Miss Kemp and Miss Cur
