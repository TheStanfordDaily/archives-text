# "FOLLIES OF STANFORD" CHEERS UP BIG CROWD
## SCORES BIG HET DESPITE THE GENERAL DEPRESSION. Originality of Words, Music and Action Marks Success of Football Show. 
### L.L. Hill, '11 
It was just two years ago tonight [
that Stanford, with the versatile
"Geoff." Morgan at thp wheel, made
its first plunge into vaudeville. The
initial leap was a successful one. The
memory of Parmer Fuller and his
Beauty Chorus in "Hello People" and
"Cupid's Telephone" is still a delight
to us.
Hut of those who saw that show,
how many dreamed that two years
later we would not only he putting on
vaudeville, hut be putting on our own
vaudeville. There wasn't an original
act in the 1909 Football Show. In the
1911 show there wasn't an act which
was not original. Stanford is surely
in her ' Golden Age" of dramatic pro
duction'. The progress of the past
two years in creative work lias been
remarkable. The Forbes-McDonald-
I!e:dman regime is illustrious.
No new play winning over a crowd
of first-nighters had a harder task
i t achieved a great triumph than did
th" "Follies of Stanford." A critical |
crowd is at least interested. The
audience in Assembly Hall was not
critical. It was depressed—it was
out of. s?pirit3—indifferent. It came
from Stanford Field bearing the men
tal burden of "three straight." To the
c edit o the "Follies" it went home
i ) a much more cheerful and hopeful
mood.
The major portion of credit for Sat
urday night's success of course goes to
.1 H. Forbes '1'?. The Executive Com
mittee could not have put the manage
ment and the c aching into better
hands than his. r i hore was a great
deal of serious work to l e done in a
short time, and Forbes, with the able
cc-one. itinn < 112 .1. L. McDonald '14,
did it. The show could not have been
the great success that it was without
the invaluable aid of the latter, for
M-c D-o-v.-a-l-d spoils originality.
"Follies of Stanford" was not only
rrent've in ith originality. It "brought
cut" a lot of new talent. New reputa
tions were made. Parmer Fuller at
last has a successor in "Brick"
S 'okiv H. H. I/isky had a chance
to show what he could do and made a
hit. His work was original in its
creation and its presentation. We
li t'e realized what a lot of clever
individual dancers we have until
Saturday night Terpischore ought to
feel as much at home here as in her
classical abode.
J. 11. Forbes was uniformly first
class in all of his work. Both he and
Vi-n Coleman scored, especially in
' l) ;n't He Angry With Me," and his
turn with the "Twins" in "Honest
People—Ain't it Fierce" was very
pleasing. Miss Kemp and Miss Cur
lice created very pretty pictures in
both their acts. "Modern Inconveni
ences" was the best song of the even
ing. This with "Gee, but it's Great
to be a College Kid" have professional
"class."
W. B. Forbes '15, with Miss Long in
"Puppy Love" got the greatest ap
plause. The music was catchy, the
words bright and the clever juvenile
impersonations even appealed to some
of the campus gray hairs.
Miss Boone and Miss Henderson
were "cuteness" and sprightliness it
self in their "Dance of the Stanford
Joys." The Big Game glooms (led as
one man on their entrance. Papinta
has a rival in Miss F. Willard '15,
whose work was professional.
Miss McDermott showed the clever
est footwork and most grace of all the
dancers. We knew that Miss McDer
mott could act and now we know she
can dance equally as well. Her danc
ing pleased more than her singing,
but both of her entrances were well
received.
Siience divided honors with Forbes
in the second scene. These two were
the center of action most of the time
and carried their parts well. Spence
and his chorus of waitresses are the
best memory of the evening's enter
tainment. The impersonation of "The
World and His Wife" was one of the
biggest hits.
The "Follies of Stanford" as a whole
deserve the greatest of highest of
deserve the highest of praise. For its
good clean fun, marked by the absence
of "off color" humor, it is especially
praiseworthy.
Scene two can be criticised for a
little too much sameness and unifor
mity in action and song. It was also
a trifle too long. The dialogue drag
ged in spots, but taken in all, there
was nothing serious to complain of.
The whole show went off with plenty
of snap and go and everyone was kept
in a good humor despite the unfavor
able outcome of the afternoon. Scor
ing such a success after a defeat,
what would it have scored had we
won?
