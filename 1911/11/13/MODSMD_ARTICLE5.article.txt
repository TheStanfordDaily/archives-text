# Stanford Loses in Stubborn Contest
## CALIFORNIA'S SUPERIOR TEAM WORK WINS BIG GAME 1911 Intercollegiate Contest Fought in the Forward Division.—Backs Figure Little in Day's Work. 
### 
Again the veteran rugby combina
t on of California proved too strong
for the Cardinal and at the end of the
second forty minute half the score
ttood Strr'ord 3, California 21. But
the story of the never-letting-up fight
of the Cardinal Varsity is not told in
tiie score, nor does it reveal how close
the tables came to he turned. It was
the triumph of the veteran combina
tion of the visitors, who had played
together all season with no injuries.
The weakness of California at full
failed to materialize. Peart played
the last outpost position with all his
veteran steadiness. His first plays
;it this position were weak but when
the opening moments had sped by he
settled down to steady work and used
his boot readily for long touch gains.
An unfortunate change had to be
made in the original Cardinal lineup.
It was found a few minutes before
the opening of the game that Cass
was unable to play his half position
and Erb was moved to his place with
out any recent practice at this post.
Rislins was put on the wing to re
place Erb. Erb played a starring role
at half, but the backfield unity had
been broken.
Hat 11c Between Forwards.
The battle was fought in the for
ward divisions and during the first
half the Cardinals had the better of
the argument, but in the second period
California did the beter work. Only
a chance opportunity now and then
let the backs into the game. But
three or four cross kicks were tried
and each of these transferred the ball

to the opposing team. The kicking
was for touch and when touch was not
found a booting bout took place which
gained nothing.
Dole was a prominent figure for
the Cardinal, and, rallying aroiund
him the forwards played in unity.
Frank was the star of the pack and
Pauly had all he could do to cope
with speedy Cardinal breakaway. At
all times Frank was in the game,
brilliant in defense and offense. Al
though playing with an injured knee,
that lias kept him from active work
for some time, be never faltered until
an injury to his leg brought him to
(lie sidelines. Gard was a master of
speed and made a strong partner for
Frank. In combination, they put Stan
ford's only try across. Schaupp, at
lock, was on deck at all times and
could never be checked, breaking
through the California defense and
participating in all the dribbling work.
Time after time he was in the van
guard with the ball.
Erl» Plays Well.
Captain Erb played a marvelous
game at half and outgeneralled Mor
ris. When be was checkmated by the
speedy Blue and Gold breakaway pah
am! cut off from backfleld aid he
gave the ball to the forwards to drib
ble. Noble played a steady game and
seldom missed a tackle. Long dives
to bring his man down were bis
specialty. Kern at center was the
star of-the backlield, and Allen, oppos
ing him, caused him little trouble.
Kern was never at a loss to make the
best move that opportunity offered.
Geissler and Risling were given few
chances to use their abilities. Geis
sler was always ready to advance the
ball with a charge when it came his
way. His other abilities were never
given a chance to show.
Brown never varied from steady
playing. He was overworked through
out the game but filled every gap. He
never worked the full position better.
Injuries Disastrous.
i Every one of the Cardinal's fifteen
J players and two substitutes deserve
! high mention. Never once did they
falter, but fought from opening to
close. This applies as well to the Cali
fornians. Stanford was unfortunate
in the injuries that fell to the lot of
their men in the last stretch of the
preliminary season, but it was the best
team that won. California's veterans
and their ability to follow the ball
decided the day's struggle.
Referee T. E. D. Byrne was the hes»
extra man on the field that ever held
the whistle in an intercollegiate
match. He was impartial and never
slowed the game by too strict adher
ence to technicalities.

Captain Erb played a marvelous
game at half and outgeneralled Mor
ris. When be was checkmated by the
speedy Blue and Gold breakaway pah
am! cut off from backfleld aid he
gave the ball to the forwards to drib
ble. Noble played a steady game and
seldom missed a tackle. Long dives
to bring his man down were bis
specialty. Kern at center was the
star of-the backlield, and Allen, oppos
ing him, caused him little trouble.
Kern was never at a loss to make the
best move that opportunity offered.
Geissler and Risling were given few
chances to use their abilities. Geis
sler was always ready to advance the
ball with a charge when it came his
way. His other abilities were never
given a chance to show.
Brown never varied from steady
playing. He was overworked through
out the game but filled every gap. He
never worked the full position better.
Injuries Disastrous.
i Every one of the Cardinal's fifteen
J players and two substitutes deserve
! high mention. Never once did they
falter, but fought from opening to
close. This applies as well to the Cali
fornians. Stanford was unfortunate
in the injuries that fell to the lot of
their men in the last stretch of the
preliminary season, but it was the best
team that won. California's veterans
and their ability to follow the ball
decided the day's struggle.
Referee T. E. D. Byrne was the hes»
extra man on the field that ever held
the whistle in an intercollegiate
match. He was impartial and never
slowed the game by too strict adher
ence to technicalities.

Again the veteran rugby combina
t on of California proved too strong
for the Cardinal and at the end of the
second forty minute half the score
ttood Strr'ord 3, California 21. But
the story of the never-letting-up fight
of the Cardinal Varsity is not told in
tiie score, nor does it reveal how close
the tables came to he turned. It was
the triumph of the veteran combina
tion of the visitors, who had played
together all season with no injuries.
The weakness of California at full
failed to materialize. Peart played
the last outpost position with all his
veteran steadiness. His first plays
;it this position were weak but when
the opening moments had sped by he
settled down to steady work and used
his boot readily for long touch gains.
An unfortunate change had to be
made in the original Cardinal lineup.
It was found a few minutes before
the opening of the game that Cass
was unable to play his half position
and Erb was moved to his place with
out any recent practice at this post.
Rislins was put on the wing to re
place Erb. Erb played a starring role
at half, but the backfield unity had
been broken.
Hat 11c Between Forwards.
The battle was fought in the for
ward divisions and during the first
half the Cardinals had the better of
the argument, but in the second period
California did the beter work. Only
a chance opportunity now and then
let the backs into the game. But
three or four cross kicks were tried
and each of these transferred the ball

to the opposing team. The kicking
was for touch and when touch was not
found a booting bout took place which
gained nothing.
Dole was a prominent figure for
the Cardinal, and, rallying aroiund
him the forwards played in unity.
Frank was the star of the pack and
Pauly had all he could do to cope
with speedy Cardinal breakaway. At
all times Frank was in the game,
brilliant in defense and offense. Al
though playing with an injured knee,
that lias kept him from active work
for some time, be never faltered until
an injury to his leg brought him to
(lie sidelines. Gard was a master of
speed and made a strong partner for
Frank. In combination, they put Stan
ford's only try across. Schaupp, at
lock, was on deck at all times and
could never be checked, breaking
through the California defense and
participating in all the dribbling work.

Again the veteran rugby combina

for the Cardinal and at the end of the
second forty minute half the score
ttood Strr'ord 3, California 21. But
the story of the never-letting-up fight
of the Cardinal Varsity is not told in
tiie score, nor does it reveal how close
the tables came to he turned. It was
the triumph of the veteran combina
tion of the visitors, who had played
together all season with no injuries.
The weakness of California at full
failed to materialize. Peart played
the last outpost position with all his
veteran steadiness. His first plays
;it this position were weak but when
the opening moments had sped by he
settled down to steady work and used
his boot readily for long touch gains.
An unfortunate change had to be
made in the original Cardinal lineup.
It was found a few minutes before
the opening of the game that Cass
was unable to play his half position
and Erb was moved to his place with
out any recent practice at this post.
Rislins was put on the wing to re
place Erb. Erb played a starring role
at half, but the backfield unity had
been broken.
Hat 11c Between Forwards.
The battle was fought in the for
ward divisions and during the first
half the Cardinals had the better of
the argument, but in the second period
California did the beter work. Only
a chance opportunity now and then
let the backs into the game. But
three or four cross kicks were tried
and each of these transferred the ball

to the opposing team. The kicking
was for touch and when touch was not
found a booting bout took place which
gained nothing.
Dole was a prominent figure for
the Cardinal, and, rallying aroiund
him the forwards played in unity.
Frank was the star of the pack and
Pauly had all he could do to cope
with speedy Cardinal breakaway. At
all times Frank was in the game,
brilliant in defense and offense. Al
though playing with an injured knee,
that lias kept him from active work
for some time, be never faltered until
an injury to his leg brought him to
(lie sidelines. Gard was a master of
speed and made a strong partner for
Frank. In combination, they put Stan
ford's only try across. Schaupp, at
lock, was on deck at all times and
could never be checked, breaking
through the California defense and
participating in all the dribbling work.
Time after time he was in the van
guard with the ball.
Erl» Plays Well.
Captain Erb played a marvelous
game at half and outgeneralled Mor
ris. When be was checkmated by the
speedy Blue and Gold breakaway pah
am! cut off from backfleld aid he
gave the ball to the forwards to drib
ble. Noble played a steady game and
seldom missed a tackle. Long dives
to bring his man down were bis
specialty. Kern at center was the
star of-the backlield, and Allen, oppos
ing him, caused him little trouble.
Kern was never at a loss to make the
best move that opportunity offered.
Geissler and Risling were given few
chances to use their abilities. Geis
sler was always ready to advance the
ball with a charge when it came his
way. His other abilities were never
given a chance to show.
Brown never varied from steady
playing. He was overworked through
out the game but filled every gap. He
never worked the full position better.
Injuries Disastrous.
i Every one of the Cardinal's fifteen
J players and two substitutes deserve
! high mention. Never once did they
falter, but fought from opening to
close. This applies as well to the Cali
fornians. Stanford was unfortunate
in the injuries that fell to the lot of
their men in the last stretch of the
preliminary season, but it was the best
team that won. California's veterans
and their ability to follow the ball
decided the day's struggle.
Referee T. E. D. Byrne was the hes»

Again the veteran rugby combina

for the Cardinal and at the end of the
second forty minute half the score
ttood Strr'ord 3, California 21. But
the story of the never-letting-up fight
of the Cardinal Varsity is not told in
tiie score, nor does it reveal how close
the tables came to he turned. It was
the triumph of the veteran combina
tion of the visitors, who had played
together all season with no injuries.
The weakness of California at full
failed to materialize. Peart played
the last outpost position with all his
veteran steadiness. His first plays
;it this position were weak but when
the opening moments had sped by he
settled down to steady work and used
his boot readily for long touch gains.
An unfortunate change had to be
made in the original Cardinal lineup.
It was found a few minutes before
the opening of the game that Cass
was unable to play his half position
and Erb was moved to his place with
out any recent practice at this post.
Rislins was put on the wing to re
place Erb. Erb played a starring role
at half, but the backfield unity had
been broken.
Hat 11c Between Forwards.
The battle was fought in the for
ward divisions and during the first
half the Cardinals had the better of
the argument, but in the second period
California did the beter work. Only
a chance opportunity now and then
let the backs into the game. But
three or four cross kicks were tried
and each of these transferred the ball

to the opposing team. The kicking
was for touch and when touch was not
found a booting bout took place which
gained nothing.
Dole was a prominent figure for
the Cardinal, and, rallying aroiund
him the forwards played in unity.
Frank was the star of the pack and
Pauly had all he could do to cope
with speedy Cardinal breakaway. At
all times Frank was in the game,
brilliant in defense and offense. Al
though playing with an injured knee,
that lias kept him from active work
for some time, be never faltered until
an injury to his leg brought him to
(lie sidelines. Gard was a master of
speed and made a strong partner for
Frank. In combination, they put Stan
ford's only try across. Schaupp, at
lock, was on deck at all times and
could never be checked, breaking
through the California defense and
participating in all the dribbling work.
Time after time he was in the van
guard with the ball.
Erl» Plays Well.
Captain Erb played a marvelous
game at half and outgeneralled Mor
ris. When be was checkmated by the
speedy Blue and Gold breakaway pah
am! cut off from backfleld aid he
gave the ball to the forwards to drib
ble. Noble played a steady game and
seldom missed a tackle. Long dives
to bring his man down were bis
specialty. Kern at center was the
star of-the backlield, and Allen, oppos
ing him, caused him little trouble.
Kern was never at a loss to make the
best move that opportunity offered.
Geissler and Risling were given few
chances to use their abilities. Geis
sler was always ready to advance the
ball with a charge when it came his
way. His other abilities were never
given a chance to show.
Brown never varied from steady
playing. He was overworked through
out the game but filled every gap. He
never worked the full position better.
Injuries Disastrous.
i Every one of the Cardinal's fifteen
J players and two substitutes deserve
! high mention. Never once did they
falter, but fought from opening to
close. This applies as well to the Cali
fornians. Stanford was unfortunate
in the injuries that fell to the lot of
their men in the last stretch of the
preliminary season, but it was the best
team that won. California's veterans
and their ability to follow the ball
decided the day's struggle.
Referee T. E. D. Byrne was the hes»
extra man on the field that ever held
the whistle in an intercollegiate
match. He was impartial and never
slowed the game by too strict adher

Again the veteran rugby combina

for the Cardinal and at the end of the
second forty minute half the score
ttood Strr'ord 3, California 21. But
the story of the never-letting-up fight
of the Cardinal Varsity is not told in
tiie score, nor does it reveal how close
the tables came to he turned. It was
the triumph of the veteran combina
tion of the visitors, who had played
together all season with no injuries.
The weakness of California at full
failed to materialize. Peart played
the last outpost position with all his
veteran steadiness. His first plays
;it this position were weak but when
the opening moments had sped by he
settled down to steady work and used
his boot readily for long touch gains.
An unfortunate change had to be
made in the original Cardinal lineup.
It was found a few minutes before
the opening of the game that Cass
was unable to play his half position
and Erb was moved to his place with
out any recent practice at this post.
Rislins was put on the wing to re
place Erb. Erb played a starring role
at half, but the backfield unity had
been broken.
Hat 11c Between Forwards.
The battle was fought in the for
ward divisions and during the first
half the Cardinals had the better of
the argument, but in the second period
California did the beter work. Only
a chance opportunity now and then
let the backs into the game. But
three or four cross kicks were tried
and each of these transferred the ball

to the opposing team. The kicking
was for touch and when touch was not
found a booting bout took place which
gained nothing.
Dole was a prominent figure for
the Cardinal, and, rallying aroiund
him the forwards played in unity.
Frank was the star of the pack and
Pauly had all he could do to cope
with speedy Cardinal breakaway. At
all times Frank was in the game,
brilliant in defense and offense. Al
though playing with an injured knee,
that lias kept him from active work
for some time, be never faltered until
an injury to his leg brought him to
(lie sidelines. Gard was a master of
speed and made a strong partner for
Frank. In combination, they put Stan
ford's only try across. Schaupp, at
lock, was on deck at all times and
could never be checked, breaking
through the California defense and
participating in all the dribbling work.
Time after time he was in the van
guard with the ball.
Erl» Plays Well.
Captain Erb played a marvelous
game at half and outgeneralled Mor
ris. When be was checkmated by the
speedy Blue and Gold breakaway pah
am! cut off from backfleld aid he
gave the ball to the forwards to drib
ble. Noble played a steady game and
seldom missed a tackle. Long dives
to bring his man down were bis
specialty. Kern at center was the
star of-the backlield, and Allen, oppos
ing him, caused him little trouble.
Kern was never at a loss to make the
best move that opportunity offered.
Geissler and Risling were given few
chances to use their abilities. Geis
sler was always ready to advance the
ball with a charge when it came his
way. His other abilities were never
given a chance to show.
Brown never varied from steady
playing. He was overworked through
out the game but filled every gap. He
never worked the full position better.
Injuries Disastrous.
i Every one of the Cardinal's fifteen
J players and two substitutes deserve
! high mention. Never once did they
falter, but fought from opening to
close. This applies as well to the Cali
fornians. Stanford was unfortunate
in the injuries that fell to the lot of
their men in the last stretch of the
preliminary season, but it was the best
team that won. California's veterans
and their ability to follow the ball
decided the day's struggle.
Referee T. E. D. Byrne was the hes»
extra man on the field that ever held
the whistle in an intercollegiate
match. He was impartial and never
slowed the game by too strict adher
ence to technicalities.

Again the veteran rugby combina
t on of California proved too strong
for the Cardinal and at the end of the
second forty minute half the score
ttood Strr'ord 3, California 21. But
the story of the never-letting-up fight
of the Cardinal Varsity is not told in
tiie score, nor does it reveal how close
the tables came to he turned. It was
the triumph of the veteran combina
tion of the visitors, who had played
together all season with no injuries.
The weakness of California at full
failed to materialize. Peart played
the last outpost position with all his
veteran steadiness. His first plays
;it this position were weak but when
the opening moments had sped by he
settled down to steady work and used
his boot readily for long touch gains.
An unfortunate change had to be
made in the original Cardinal lineup.
It was found a few minutes before
the opening of the game that Cass
was unable to play his half position
and Erb was moved to his place with
out any recent practice at this post.
Rislins was put on the wing to re
place Erb. Erb played a starring role
at half, but the backfield unity had
been broken.
Hat 11c Between Forwards.
The battle was fought in the for
ward divisions and during the first
half the Cardinals had the better of
the argument, but in the second period
California did the beter work. Only
a chance opportunity now and then
let the backs into the game. But
three or four cross kicks were tried
and each of these transferred the ball

to the opposing team. The kicking
was for touch and when touch was not
found a booting bout took place which
gained nothing.
Dole was a prominent figure for
the Cardinal, and, rallying aroiund
him the forwards played in unity.
Frank was the star of the pack and
Pauly had all he could do to cope
with speedy Cardinal breakaway. At
all times Frank was in the game,
brilliant in defense and offense. Al
though playing with an injured knee,
that lias kept him from active work
for some time, be never faltered until
an injury to his leg brought him to
(lie sidelines. Gard was a master of
speed and made a strong partner for
Frank. In combination, they put Stan
ford's only try across. Schaupp, at
lock, was on deck at all times and
could never be checked, breaking
through the California defense and
participating in all the dribbling work.
Time after time he was in the van
guard with the ball.
Erl» Plays Well.
Captain Erb played a marvelous
game at half and outgeneralled Mor
ris. When be was checkmated by the
speedy Blue and Gold breakaway pah
am! cut off from backfleld aid he
gave the ball to the forwards to drib
ble. Noble played a steady game and
seldom missed a tackle. Long dives
to bring his man down were bis
specialty. Kern at center was the
star of-the backlield, and Allen, oppos
ing him, caused him little trouble.
Kern was never at a loss to make the
best move that opportunity offered.
Geissler and Risling were given few
chances to use their abilities. Geis
sler was always ready to advance the
ball with a charge when it came his
way. His other abilities were never
given a chance to show.
Brown never varied from steady
playing. He was overworked through
out the game but filled every gap. He
never worked the full position better.
Injuries Disastrous.
i Every one of the Cardinal's fifteen
J players and two substitutes deserve
! high mention. Never once did they
falter, but fought from opening to
close. This applies as well to the Cali
fornians. Stanford was unfortunate
in the injuries that fell to the lot of
their men in the last stretch of the
preliminary season, but it was the best
team that won. California's veterans
and their ability to follow the ball
decided the day's struggle.
Referee T. E. D. Byrne was the hes»
extra man on the field that ever held
the whistle in an intercollegiate
match. He was impartial and never
slowed the game by too strict adher
ence to technicalities.
