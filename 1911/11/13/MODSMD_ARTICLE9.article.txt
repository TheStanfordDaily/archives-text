ads and too little news"
on for the failure of an
in college newspaper ex
pansion which the Daily Palo Alto

endeavored to carry out
this semester, it is safe
to say that for the past
ten years it had been the

dream of editors and managers to
make the paper larger, and make
available more space for news and
advertisements, thereby increasing the
revenue.
It is hard to say that the thing
couldn't be done. Had the money
held out it might have been possible
to keep the larger size, but even then
it would have placed too great a bur
den on the staff to secure the news
needed. There are few college daily
newspapers published in the evening,
and it is generally admitted that an
afternoon paper entails double the
amount of work and effort that the
morning edition requires. The foot
ball season at Stanford is the greatest
source of news in the fall. With the
weekly games discontinued, it is a
problem to fill the paper. Then is
when news must be "made." it is im
possible to find enough items to fill
the larger paper without an increased
amount of advertisements. Since this
cannot be done there is nothing for
it but to return to the smaller size,
with 110 hope for our successor in
office.
Perhaps it is not such a bad thing
after all.I—Moreover,1—Moreover, We Need the
