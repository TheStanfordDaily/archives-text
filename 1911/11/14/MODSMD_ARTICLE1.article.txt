# ZOOLOGISTS RETURN TO AMERICA FROM BRAZIL
## BAKER AND MANN BRING BACK VALUABLE SPECIMENS. Latter is Appointed Entomological Assistant at Harvard.â€”Still a Stanford Man. 
### 
The return of W. M. Mann, '13, and
Dr. Fred Baker, of San Diego, from
Brazil, word of which has just been
received here, brings to a close the
Branner-Stanford Expedition to the
southern republic. All the other mem
bers of the party returned before the
beginning of the semester.
In a letter to Professor H. Heath,
Mann announces that he has accepted
an appointment in the Entomological
department of Harvard University and
has already taken up his work there.
Dr. Baker, the conchologist of the
expedition, is at the Philadelphia
Academy of Sciences, where he is
studying the shell specimens collected
on the expedition.
Mann and Baker parted from the
other members of the party this sum
mer when they made ready to return
to the United States. The two men
followed the tributaries of the Amazon
into the little known Madero river
country, where they made many dis
coveries of great interest to zoologists.
Remarkable Monkey Captured.
Mann brought back to New York
with him the first specimen of the
Howling Monkey ever to reach this
country alive. Despite the fact that
the animal was captured near the
1 order of Bolivia and 2000 miles from
the sailing port of Para on the Bra
zilian coast, it reached New York in
perfect health and has been placed o i
exhibition in the Bronx Zoo, where
many biological experts have viewed
it.
The other livestock which Mann
brought back with him includes two
boa constrictors, three other species
of monkey and several smaller ani
mals.
Pe.tt Irate Wilds of Brazil.
The region penetrated is the wild
est part of Brazil, where the vegeta
tion is very dense and collecting is
extremely difficult. Among other in
tvresting mat:er in Mann's letter is
an account of a tapir hunt at night in
the jungle.
Some idea of the danger from tropi
cal fever of the region can be gained
from Mann's account of meeting a car
go of a ton of quinine and three mil
lion gelatine capsules, the first of
the drug to reach the portion of Brazil
t'-e men visited.
The city of Manaos, according to
Mann, in Northern Brazil, is the only
place in that section where ice cream
soda may be had. It costs 50 cents a
glass to indulge this appetite.
