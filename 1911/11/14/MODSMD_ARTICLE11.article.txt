# Worth While Spirit
## 
### 
It is probable that very few stu
dents or any outsiders know of an
incident that occurred last Saturday

afternoon 'at the Big
Game, among the Stan
ford team, an incident
which makes athletics,

and intercollegiate contests, particu
larly, most worth while. It was but
a minute or so before the kick-off.
The coach had made his final choice
of the Stanford fifteen and the men
had taken their run down the field.
Everything seemed settled. One play
er, however, had been selected to
start, the game who had been off the
field for several days with an injury.
The doctors had said he could play;
the coach had chosen him; he was
about to make the team. When the
fifteen was preparing for the contest,
the Stanford player told the coach he
could not play; that if he were put
into the game it would be only a mat
ter of moments before his withdrawal
from the line-up would necessitate a
disastrous change in the arrangement
and fighting strength of the fifteen.
He told the coach sincerely and frank
ly that he was unable to play. Then,
although the entire team had been an
nounced for two days, one whole- half
of the fifteen was re-organized, and
this player was left on the side-lines.
That is the real Stanford spirit. It
is the spirit that the newspapers, the
cartoonists and the general public
never seesâ€”but it is real. It is better
than winning a game; it is better than
anything else we know of.
Add to that the spirit of the coach
after defeat congratulating the op
posing coach and captain for their
victory, and you have something
worth while. We believe that is the
spirit that has won for Stanford a
majority of the football games in the
past twenty years, and which won
"six straight" at one time. It is still
here and we are proud of it. Victory
is a fine thing, but this is even finer.
Moreover, We Need the Union.
