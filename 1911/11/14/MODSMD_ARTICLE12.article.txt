In last Friday's Daily Palo Alto
appeared a signed article predicting
defeat for Stanford. It has met with

a good deal of criticism
and unfriendly talk. Hut
why should it? Is a whole

column of reading matter, signed by

the name of the writer, to be a mere
husk of praise and joyful prophecy?
It is the proper thing for a rally, and
has its time and place there. But for
definite statements in a newspaper,
considering the merits of the two
teams, why not state your honest
opinion? The Daily Palo Alto believes
in sincerity. Moreover, We Need the
the Union.
