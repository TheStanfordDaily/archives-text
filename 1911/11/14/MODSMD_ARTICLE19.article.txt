Editor, Daily Palo Alto:
May I be permitted space in your
columns to speak of the lecture to be
g ven by Mr. Loyal Lincoln Wirt, ex-
Coinmissioner of Education of Alaska,
Wednesday evening, under the aus
pices of the English Club. Not long
ago I had the pleasure of hearing
Mr. Wirt give this address on his ex
periences in the Arctic regions. It is
an account of a journey taken by him
in the dead of winter across twelve
hundred miles of snow and ice, that
relief might l:e brought to a large
settlement of ice-bound miners who
were suffering an epidemic of typhoid
fever. The story is told with vivid
ness and humor and is an absorbing
and thrilling narrative of personal
adventures. I understand that the lec
ture is free to the public, and I can
assure those who attend an evening
of rare interest.
L. E. BASSETT.
