# LOVE AND POLITICS THEME IN "COMPROMISE"
## PLOT IS LIVE AND STRICTLY UP-TO-DATE. Last Play of Semester Is Another Original Production.—Miss Workman Coaching. 
### 
"Follies of Stanford" will not be
the only original play of the semester.
"Compromise," to be presented by the
English Club on Friday evening,
November 24, will be strictly in keep
ing with the new dramatic ideals of
the University. True the author is
not a "stoode," but he is one of our
♦'profs," and original work among
our faculty friends is as welcome and
commendable as among ourselves. We
would fain have more of it.
Like the "Follies," "Compromise"
will not only be creative in its origin
ality, but it will, likewise, "bring out"
new talent. And judging from the re
hearsals, Stanford will be as satisfied
with the new Thespians as she was
with the new stare uncovered by the
Football Show.
"Compromise" is a live story of
love and politics. Love and politics
are both gambles but both games are
played with good results in the coming
play. It is strictly down to date and
will give many people their first in
sight into how it is possible for some
people to be Republicans, Democrats,
Socialists, "Goo-Goos," all at the
same time, and still "get away with it."
Miss Gertrude Workman, '12, who
needs no introduction to Stanford
theatre-goers is assisting the author
Professor H. D. Gray in the coaching
of the "Compromise." Daily rehear
sals are being held and finished work
is being done by the entire cast.
