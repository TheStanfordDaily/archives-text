# FIFTY OARSMEN TRAIN DAILY AT BOAT HOUSE.
## Crew-Captain Seward is in charge of Candidates.â€”Freshmen Are Promising. 
### 
More than fifty aspirants for places
in the Stanford boats, are now train
ing daily under the direction of R. H.
Seward, '12, crew captain. The men
meet every afternoon at 4:45, and on
Saturday mornings at 9:30, at the
Boat-house on Luke Lagunita. The
new candidates, mostly Freshmen, are
showing up exceptionally well. Only
a few of the first year men have ever
pulled an oar before but they are a
likely looking squad and it is a safe
prediction that a strong crew will
face the California babies next semes
ter. Light setting-up exercises, work
on the rowing machines, and cross
country runs, constitute the work of
the oarsmen. The heavier training
for the rowers will not be taken up
until next January. By accomplishing
the rudimentary work during the fall
season, no time will he wasted in
getting the candidates on the water
in the four shells which the Varsity
and Freshmen will have at their dis
posal. The new boat, which the older
crew will use, is expected to arrive
within the next week.
