# DEPARTMENTAL RUGBY GAME WILL BE SPEEDY
## FLAYERS OF NOTE TO BE SEEN IN CONTEST. Geology and Mining Majors to Rattle With Civil Engineering Students On the Turf. 
### 
Rousing rugby, roaring rooters, aud
a real referee, will lend "class" to next
week's rugby game between the Civil
Engineering and Geology and Mining
departments. The proceeds will be
donated to the Stanford Union. The
battle will be waged on the turf
field, and Dr. F. Angell, of the Psych
ology department, will be the man be
hind the whistle. Professors J. C.
Branner and C. E. Marx, of the Geo
logy and Civil Engineering depart
ments, respectively, will officiate as
timers and fearlessly shoot the pistol
at the conclusion of each and every
half. Professor J. P. Smith for the
Geology and Professor C. B. Wing for
the Civil Engineering departments
will bear the official designations of
touch judges.
Stars Will Flay.
The game can be fairly listed as a
Class A contest, owing to the coinci
dence that a large number of the Car
dinal rugby stars are registered in
these two departments. The teams
will almost exclusively consist of Var
sity, ex-Varsity, and Second Team
players. Among the stellar lights of
the rugby world upon whom the Civil
Engineering team will rely are Brown,
Partridge, Reeves, T. Sanborn and J.
O. Miller. The Geology and Mining
lineup may include Cass, Corbet, and
other prominent players.
Further details of the contest will
be arranged within a few days.
