Full line of Fall Suitings,

XMAS VACATION WORK.
We have a clean cut selling propo
sition which appeals to high grade
men. No house to house work —
strictly business. Last year a fresh
man without previous experience made
$200. We are going to start a few
men this Xmas vacation so that they
will be in good shape for making
money next summer.
