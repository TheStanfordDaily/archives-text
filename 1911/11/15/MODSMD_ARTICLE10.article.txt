# PLANS FOR SWELLING UNION FUND DEVELOPE
## RECEIPTS FROM GAMES SHOULD ADD GOOD SUM. Letters Sent to Alumni Subscribers Receive Favorable Replies in Short Time. 
### 
Plans are now on foot to leave no
! stone unturned to increase the amount
of money flowing into the Stanford
I Union fund. Letters have been sent
out to Alumni who have graduated
| since the active work for the Union
! began two years ago, asking them to
' complete their subscriptions. Foot
: ball games will be played, the receipts
of which will be turned over to the
I Union, and the Executive Committee
will probably vote this evening to turn
over a certain portion of the net pro
| ceeds of the Football Show to the
building fund.
Saturday afternoon if the weather
is propitious, two departmental teams
I will battle on Stanford Field. The
j game between the members of the
Civil Engineering and Geology and
Mining departments, promises, from
the present outlook, to be the best
post-season affair of the year. A nom-
I inal admission fee will be charged and
the proceeds will be given to the
I Union.
It is probable that the Executive
Committee will authorize the charg
ing of admission to the post-season
inter-fraternity and inter-club series
I for the purpose of adding more money
to the cause. This will be an innova
tion but should add considerably to the
j Union fund.
Two weeks ago Campus Chairman
j A. W. Ambrose, '13, sent out a number
j of letters to alumni who have pledged
life memberships to the Union, asking
that these be paid as promptly as cir
cumstances would allow. The number
;of replies received from these men
inclosing additions to the amounts
credited to them towards life member
ships, is more than encouraging, con
sidering the short time that the letters
have been sent out. Numerous men to
! whom letters were sent replied that
i they could pay nothing toward the
fund at the present time, but announc
-1 ed that they would complete the re
i quired sum at a definite future date.
Although it is not known at present
! what the net proceeds from the "Fol
j lies of Stanford" will be. nor is it defi
nitely known that the Executive Com
i mittee will vote a portion of the funds
to the Union, it seems probable that
two-thirds of the net receipts will be
turned into the Union fund. The
gross receipts for the show amounted
to approximately $1250. Expenses will
probably cut this almost in two. if
the Executive Committee votes this
money to the Union they should re
ceive close to $100 as their share. The
remainder will probably be turned
I over to the Women's Club House.
