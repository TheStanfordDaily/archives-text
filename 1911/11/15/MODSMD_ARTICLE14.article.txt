# HERO OF "COMPROMISE" "GETS IN WRONG" AT DANCE.
## 
### 
An entrancing hall room scene will
be the setting for the climax of "Com
promise," the play to be presented by
the English Club on Friday evening,
November 24. The ball is given at the
home of Brash, the political boss, and
"among those present" are three ri
val candidates for mayor. All the
candidates are named by Brash and
are called upon for speeches. Mur
dock, the independent candidate, "gets
in wrong" from the start by appear
ing at a formal dance in very infor
mal clothing. He is humiliated at
the dance by every one but the "boss"
who is too good a politician to be dis
courteous. When the speeches are
called for, Murdock has a splendid
chance to return the compliment to
his snobbish fellow guegts and makes
the most of his opportunity. The ma
chine gets a terrific jolt at the dance.
