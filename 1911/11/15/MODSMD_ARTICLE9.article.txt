On a date as yet undecided, the Ger
man Club is to produce, in the original
German, the one-act farce, "Annette's
Wis." The staging of the playlet was
decided upon at a recent meeting. It
has but four roles, which will be
taken by Miss E. Englehard, '12, Miss
H. Horton, '15, Miss T. Tag, '12, and
F. Boezinger, '13.
