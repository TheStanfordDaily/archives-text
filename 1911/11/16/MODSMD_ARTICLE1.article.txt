# "GIVE 'EM THE AX," SAYS HONORABLE WAR GOD
## MINISTER OF GOOD-LUCK MAKES STANFORD HIS HOME. Celestial Diety, Guided by H.S. Crocker, of San Francisco, Makes Safe Journey From Japan. 
### 
Honorable War God has come to
Stanford. His home was in Japan
until Mr. H. S. Crocker, head of the
publishing company of that name in
San Francisco, saw him seated in front
of a temple in his native land. The
fact that Honorable God of Rattle was
painted a fair cardinal and held
upraised a formidable looking axe,
caused Mr. Crocker to decide that he
belonged to Stanford. That is why he
purchased the idol and sent it over.
This new addition to our posses
sions is about three feet high. He is
seated in a most uncomfortable posi
tion, which perhaps accounts for the
disagreeable expression of his face.
He is scowling fiercely and his black
hair and drooping black mustache
add to the somberness of his visage.
His axe makes him look most blood
thirsty.
Honorable War God came over on
the steamer "Chio Maru," and arrived
at Stanford last Saturday. He was so
overcome by his long journey and the
disconcerting trip to the football
field, during which he stood on his
head in the back of the an automobile,
that he couldn't get himself together
and work any good luck business.
However, he is now fully recovered
and in good working order.
The Executive Committee has decid
ed to place the image in the Museum,
and, later on, in the Union. They also
sent a vote of thanks to Mr. Crocker
for his gift.
