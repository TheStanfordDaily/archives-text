# Smoking on the Quad.
## 
### 
One of the finest and most reverent
traditions that Stanford has is the
custom of not smoking on the Quad
rangle. Last night the Executive

Committee of the stu
dents drew up a reso
lution defining what
should be considered as

the limits within which the prohibition
should be valid. For several years it
has been the habit of men frequenting
the terrace in front of the general
Library to indulge in the recreation
of a "smoke" between classes and at
other times. Probably a majority of
the men have been guilty of this small
violation of the tradition, without
knowing of the offense. This also
applies to the men who gather at the
Law steps. Any part of the Quad is
the Quad, whether it be in the center
of Memorial Court or on the outer
steps and terraces. Let us see that
tliis, one of the best of Stanford's tra
ditions, be observed to the letter.
Moreover, We Need the Union.
