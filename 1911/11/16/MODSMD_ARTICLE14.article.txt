# STANFORD PROFESSORS CONTRIBUTE ARTICLES
## CURRENT MAGAZINES CONTAIN ALSO ALUMNI WORK. Fiction, Poetry, and Technical, Historical, and Economic Capers Are of Local Interest. 
### 
Numerous articles and papers in
current periodicals bear witness to
the extensive creative work which is
being accomplished by the members
of the Stanford faculty. These pro
ductions all appear in standard pub
lications of a high grade. They cover
a wide variety of subjects, each writer
taking up some subject in which he
luis carried on independent investiga
tions.
Recent magazines also bear the sig
natures of several Stanford graduates
upon prose and poetical contribu
tions. This marks the entry of the
Stanford graduate upon a field in
which he will become more and more
prominent as the University grows
older.
President David Starr Jordan's ad
dress on the "Unseen Empire" which
he delivered in Honolulu on August
15 is printed in the "Mid-Pacific"
magazine for December. A repro
duction of Mrs. Richardson's recent
portrait of Dr. Jordan accompanies the
article. This magazine is now in the
Periodical Room of the Library.
