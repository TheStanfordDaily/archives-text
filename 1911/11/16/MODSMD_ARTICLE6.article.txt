# POST-SEASON RUGBY IS ASSURED FOR THIS YEAR.
## Representatives From Clubs and Fraternities Will Meet To-morrow to Arrange Schedule. 
### 
Post-season rugby will again afford
amusement and exercise to Stanford
club and fraternity men. This deci
sion was reached at the meeting of
the Executive Committee last evening.
To arrange a schedule and launch the
series, a representative delegate from
each fraternity and club will meet
with three special representatives of
the Executive Committee in the office
of Student Adviser Roth, to-morrow
afternoon at 1:15. This special com
mittee appointed at the meeting last
evening consists of A. E. Roth, '09,
J. O. Miller, '08, and B. E. Erb, '12.
These men, in conjunction with the
fraternity representatives, will per
fect the schedule and conduct the
games.
Whether the teams will be picked
from combinations of clubs and frater
nities, as was the system last year, or
whether each of these units will put
into the field a team of its own, will
be determined at to-morrow's confer
ence. It may be found desirable to
make the number of competing teams
as small as possible, owing to the fact
that playing time is limited. The
games will be started this year a week
later than last, and the oncoming
final examinations will interfere with
a lengthy schedule. It seems prob
able that it will be necessary to play
games nearly every evening of the
week. The possession of two excellent
fields, however, the auxiliary and the
regular turf, will go far to relieve the
congestion.
