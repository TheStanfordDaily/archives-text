# SMOKING ON THE QUAD SCORED BY CONFERENCE
## LIBRARY LAWN AND LAW STEPS INCLUDED IN QUADRANGLE. Bonfire Will Be Limited in Size.-No More Uninvited Guests at Dunces. 
### 
Smokers who have made of the Law
steps and the Library lawn convenient
resting places came in for a severe
grilling at last night's meeting of the
Student Conference. This habit is
regarded as a violation of the old
custom which prohibits smoking on
the Quad, as the limits of the Quad
rangle extend to the bottom of all
steps and to the balustrade in front of
the Library.
Old Stanford men returning to the
game last Saturday were the first to
call attention to the breaking down
of the tradition and requesed that the
Sudent Body take some action in the
matter.
Rally bonfires, which have gone
soaring in cost and height during the
past few years, will, in the future,
lie of a prescribed size. Competition
of Freshman classes has caused each
ssucceeding fire to expand in size, and
it was felt that the limit was reached
this year. A committee, composed of
M. E. Mitchell, '11, and H. L. Loud, "13,
was appointed to investigate the cost
and construction of the bonfires.
The Advisory Boards of the two con
ferences, acting jointly, will also un
dertake the supervising of sorority and
fraternity visiting dances. An attempt
will be made to confine visitors at
campus dances to those who come by
way of the front door.
