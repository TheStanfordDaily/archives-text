The order issued by the health au
thorities against the holding of the
Cotillion, the Encina, and other dances

may cause a great
deal of hardship
among the various
committees and stu

dents who have completed all arrange
ments for the evenings, hut surely
there is no doubt that the ruling is
for the good of everyone. There
should be no ill-feeling toward any
one, nor any feeling except regret that
the situation requires this action.
It is far better that such measures
should be taken now, before a spread
of the disease, which would cause
the closing of the University and re
sult in countless fatalities. It is al
was the habit of students before the
danger has come close to them to ask
"Why all this trouble about nothing,"
and then, when the trouble has struck
them to say, "Why wasn't this ordei
issued long ago? Let the students use
common sense now and look at the
thing iu a sane light and see what are
the best interests of everyone. More
over, We Need the Union.
