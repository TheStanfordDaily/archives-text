# EXCHANGES WILL BE PLACED IN LIBRARY
## EASTERN COLLEGE PUBLICATIONS AT STUDENTS' SERVICE. Daily Palo Alto and Chaparral Will Give University Papers and Magazines to Public. 
### 
Exchanges of the Daily Palo Alto
and Chaparral are to be placed in the
library in the future through the
courtesy of Librarian G. T. Clark, who
has fitted up a table for them.
Up to this time the exchanges which
the editors of the two papers have
received have not been turned over to
the public as a suitable place was not
available. A short time ago editors
J. C. Thomas, '12, and L. D. Summer
field, '12, talked over a plan for having
these papers putin the library.
Librarian Clark approved of the
scheme, and set up a table in the
Trophy Room, where, beginning to
morrow evening, the publications from
the other universities will be found.
It will l)e up to the readers to see that
they are not carried away or destroy
ed. In case they are the custom of
placing them there will be discon
tinued.
IVill Aid Rroadmindedness.
The idea in turning the papers over
to the students is to give them an op
portunity to read of the happenings
at the other colleges in more detail
than given in the local sheets, and
also to show them how well the Stan
ford publications compare with the
papers from much larger universities.
The exchanges of the two papers
are: Daily Palo Alto —Harvard School
