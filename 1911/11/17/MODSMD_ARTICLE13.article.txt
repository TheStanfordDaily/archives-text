# A 						Leading Question.

"How much change have you?"
$1.25.
"Just enough *to buy a Stanford
Calendar."
Have you a friend or relative who
has never seen Stanford and who
wants to know how the campus and
the buildings look, and what the stu
dent activities are? Send him (her)
a Calendar. They are all ready for
mailing in a cardboard box. Because
of the expensiveness of the leather
cover and the printing the edition is
limited. Give an order for one now,
or you may not get one.
