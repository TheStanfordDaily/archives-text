# Blodgett Recital Postponed.
## 
### 
In consideration of the request of
the Board of Health that all public
exercises in Palo Alto next Sunday be
omitted, the organ recital by B. C.
Blodgett, scheduled for 4:30 o'clock
that afternoon, has been postponed.
The recital probably will be given the
afternoon of Sunday, November 25,
in the Congregational church, as orig
inally planned.
