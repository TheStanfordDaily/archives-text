noon as a branch of the Woodrow
Wilson League of College Men, by
thirty-two undergraduates and alumni,
thirteen of whom were women. This
surprising complication of almost half

the newly-enfranchised suffragettes

the starting of the movement, especi

vertised for "men." But the women
were gladly welcomed and one of them
elected to the vice-presidency of the
Club.
Following are those who will follow
th? slogan "We Want Wilson":
