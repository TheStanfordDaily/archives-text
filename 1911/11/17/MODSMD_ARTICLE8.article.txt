# SOPHOMORE COTILLION HAS BEEN POSTPONED
## PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES ARE TAKEN. Encina and Other Week-End Affairs Are Called Off to Safeguard Public Health. 
### 
The Sophomore Cotillion, the En
cina at Home, and all fraternity and
sorority dances scheduled for the
week-end have been indefinitely post
poned by the university authorities,
awaiting the outcome of the alleged
cases of infantile paralysis in Palo
Alto.
So far, however, there have been ab
solutely no supposed cases of the dis
ease or even of suspicious illness on
the campus.
While there is no occasion whatso
ever for alarm, the university authori
ties though it advisable to take the
precaution to prevent unnecessary
gatherings of the students until the
suspicious cases in Palo Alto are
either proved or disproved.
On Safe Side.
This action is simply in line with the
precautions taken by the Palo Alto
Board of Health in closing the
theaters, churches and schools to be
on the safe side, and was taken in
view of the close relationship into
which the students are thrown with
Palo Alto.
The university authorities are keep
ing in close touch with the situation,
and have taken measures to be inform
ed of any cases of unusual illness 011
the campus immediately they occur.
The closing of the public gatherings
in Palo Alto and the postponement of
the campus dances are purely pre
cautionary measures, taken in view of
the fact that it is not known definitely
how infantile paralysis in communi
cated, should the cases in Palo Alto
be of this disease.
Efforts are being made to arrange a
date for the Sophomore Cotillion be
fore the end of the semester, in view
of the extensive preparations that
have already been made. Saturday,
November 25 and one day of the
Thanksgiving vacation have been
suggested as possible dates for the
affair.
The chief difficulty which confronts
the committee is the conflict with
other campus dances already sched
uled for these dates.
Health Committee Reports.
"In view of the fact that it has been
deemed advisable to request the post
ponement of the dances planned for
the evenings of November 17 and 18,
it seems proper that the student body
and others interested should be placed
in possesion of the facts regarding the
situation. There have been two cases
of probable acute anterior poliomye
litis in Palo Alto. These occurred on
November 8 and 10. Since that time a
number of cases have been suspected
of showing symptoms of the same
condition, hut most of these have been
ruled nut both by local physicians and
by the inspector sent by the State
Board of Health, who has had a large
clinical experience in this disease. At
' the present time there is one case in
Palo Alto probably suffering from tho
disease in a mild form, and showing
daily improvement. Another case
slightly suspicious yesterday is prac
tically negative today. During the
last two days no new cases have turn
ed up. There have been at no time dur
ing this period any cases even slight
ly suspicious on the campus, and
none of the above mentioned cases
have been university students.
\o Epidemic.
"The action regarding the dances
has been taken on the following
grounds: We have no definite know
ledge of the method of transmission
of this disease. We do know that it
can be transmitted to monkeys by in
oculation with material from the
nasal mucous membrane of infected
human beings. Tt is advisable, there
fore, when the disease appears, to
strictly isolate cases, and destroy dis
charges from the nose and throat.
This is being carried out by the
health officers in Palo Alto on the sus
picious cases. There is no epidemic
at present and the failure of appear
ance of new cases during the past
few days makes it seem unlikely that
there will be one. There is, there
fore. no reason at present for closing
class mom work or other university
exercises. Nevertheless, it, seems un
wise to expose the student body to
the additional and unnecessary risks
and the peculiarly unhygienic condi
tions of a large dance—where long
continued close association of many
people in a dusty and poorly ventilatei
atmosphere furnish conditions par
ticularly dangerous in the case of a
disease which may possibly be trans
mitted to the upper respiratory pas
sages—ncse and throat.
"The situation will, of course, lie
closely watched, and in a week or sn
we will be able to tell whether or not
we are to look forward to more seri
ous measures or whether the present
occurrence of the disease has bee* l
merely a sporadic outbreak of a few
isolated eases. Tlie latter seems to
''o the case at present and the situa
tion, while calling for conscientious
vigilance, is not alarming.
