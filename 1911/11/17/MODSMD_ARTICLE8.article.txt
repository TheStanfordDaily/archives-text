# SOPHOMORE COTILLION HAS BEEN POSTPONED
## PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES ARE TAKEN. Encina and Other Week-End Affairs Are Called Off to Safeguard Public Health. 
### 
The Sophomore Cotillion, the En
cina at Home, and all fraternity and
sorority dances scheduled for the
week-end have been indefinitely post
poned by the university authorities,
awaiting the outcome of the alleged
cases of infantile paralysis in Palo
Alto.
So far, however, there have been ab
solutely no supposed cases of the dis
ease or even of suspicious illness on
the campus.
While there is no occasion whatso
ever for alarm, the university authori
ties though it advisable to take the
precaution to prevent unnecessary
gatherings of the students until the
suspicious cases in Palo Alto are
either proved or disproved.
On Safe Side.
This action is simply in line with the
precautions taken by the Palo Alto
Board of Health in closing the
theaters, churches and schools to be
on the safe side, and was taken in

The university authorities are keep

the campus immediately they occur.
The closing of the public gatherings
in Palo Alto and the postponement of
the campus dances are purely pre
cautionary measures, taken in view of
the fact that it is not known definitely
how infantile paralysis in communi
cated, should the cases in Palo Alto
be of this disease.
Efforts are being made to arrange a
date for the Sophomore Cotillion be
fore the end of the semester, in view
of the extensive preparations that
have already been made. Saturday,
November 25 and one day of the
Thanksgiving vacation have been
suggested as possible dates for the
affair.
The chief difficulty which confronts
the committee is the conflict with
other campus dances already sched
uled for these dates.
Health Committee Reports.
"In view of the fact that it has been
deemed advisable to request the post
ponement of the dances planned for
the evenings of November 17 and 18,
it seems proper that the student body
and others interested should be placed
in possesion of the facts regarding the
situation. There have been two cases
of probable acute anterior poliomye
litis in Palo Alto. These occurred on
November 8 and 10. Since that time a
number of cases have been suspected
of showing symptoms of the same
condition, hut most of these have been
ruled nut both by local physicians and
by the inspector sent by the State
