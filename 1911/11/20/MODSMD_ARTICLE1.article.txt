to battle in a tenrific rugby : .struggle

This was assured last evening when
the challenge of the combined team of
correspondents, and members of the
staffs of the Sequoia and Chaparral,

Palo .AItUJ /j.nn.;. ~ ~,n .
To those with the- least touch of

unlimited field for conjecture and wild
flights of fancy. Instead of the usual
cries heard on the football field, the
scribes' game will be conducted in the
language of the printing shop, the
poet, and the funny man.
"lambic pentameter for the first
five," the Sequoia cheer leader will
cry, when one of the members of the
staff of that famous publication lies
bleeding on the field. And his men
in the rooting section will come back

Chaparral like last week's breakfast."
It is to be hoped that the answer will
be lost in the roar of the game.
Definite arrangements for time and
players will undoubtedly be completed
within a few days. Until then the an
xious public must solace themselves
with news of the cheerful little epi
demic in Palo Alto. . ,
