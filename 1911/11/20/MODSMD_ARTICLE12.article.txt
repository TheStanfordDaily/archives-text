Stanford's football show this year
brought in the largest cash total in
the history of Stanford dramatics.
Almost thirteen hundred dollars was
taken in, which is a sum considerably
beyond the hopes of the committee.
Out of this amount, expenses of about
five hundred dollars are to be deduct
ed which will leave a handsome sum
of eight hundred dollars. Two-thirds
of this is to go to the Stanford Union
and the other third is for the Woman's
Club House.
