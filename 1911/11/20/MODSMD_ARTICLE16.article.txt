# Right About Face

### 
At the most serious time when cave
and thoughtfulness are most required
someone can usually be depended upon

to play the fool and do
the wrong thing. Last
Friday while the camp
us and everyone in this

vicinity were more or less excited
over the approach of an epidemic and
quarantine, signs were posted on the
bulletin board telling of the cancel
lation of the Cotillion and other dances
someone, who saw only the chance for
a joke and did not see what the con
sequences might be added that classes
had been suspended in the University.
That was foolish. Any number of
people might have seen the board and
made plans that would have been dif
ficult to change, and which might
have caused a good deal of worry.
We understand that the man who
possessed a funny bone at this very
serious time was an underclassman.
Decidedly, times need changing. The
education of someone has been sadly
neglected. And not only in this case
lÂ»ut at other times by other meubers
of the same class it has been demon
strated that a new order of hings is
needed. Moreover, We Need the Tin
ion! .
