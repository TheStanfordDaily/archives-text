# UNDERCLASSMEN TO ACT IN EASTERN SUCCESS
## "CHRISTOPHER, JR.," CHOICE OF SOPHOMORES Splendid Comedy Selected by Second Year Committee for Annual Theatrical Production. 
### 
"Christopher, Jr." is the title of the
comedy selected by the Sophomore
Play Committee lor the annual produc
tion of the second year class. The
play has recently been published
and is thoroughly up-to-date, snappy,
vivacious and has all the requirements
necessary for a modern theatrical suc
cess. Maud Adams and John Drew
scored heavily as leads in this comedy.
The play enjoyed a long run in New
York and the EaSt, and was one of
the biggest money-makers in which
Miss Adams and Drew appeared. The
1911 committee chose the play because
of the fact that it differed from any
production attempted by Sophomores
of late years and is of the light comedy
type with a splendid plot as a ground
work.
Chairman i l "'. W. Wickman of the play
committee announces that the try outs
for places in the cast will he held as
scon as possible so that those selected
for the parts may commit their lines
during the Christmas vacation. F. L.
Mathieu of San Francisco will act as
coach. Definite dates for the first try
uuts will be made within the next few
days.
"Christopher, Jr." will be presented
on the eighth of March.
