# TASK OF RECONSTRUCTING MEMORIAL CHURCH BEGUN.
## Completed Church Will Be Counterpart In Construction of Most Modern Religious Edifices. 
### 
The work of rebuilding the Stanford
Memorial church was begun in earnest
today under the direction of .T. D. Mc-
Gilvray, of the McGilvray Stone Com
pany. contractors. It is estimated
that at least a year will he required
to complete the building as a steel and
reenforced concrete church as near
riro and earthquake proof as modern
architecture knows.
An I-beam skeleton is being erected
to replace the old frame structure, and
the work of laying cement floors at the
ground level and in the galleries will
begin next week. The main floor will
be the same as before, with the ex
ception that heavier girders will sup
port it.
The preliminary work of preparing
for the masons is going 011 apace today
and it is expected that the stone cut
ters will begin their task tomorrow or
next day.
The contour of the church when
completed will lie exactly as before the
disaster. The framework And the
structure itself will be far stronger,
and will duplicate in construction the
most modern church edifices.
