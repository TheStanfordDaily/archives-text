# CARDINAL SOCCER TEAMS LOSERS IN BOTH GAMES
## Stanford Players Fail to Show Best Form, and Are Defeated by Close Scores. 
### 
Stanford's soccer elevens were de
feated in both of their contests Satur
day afternoon. The first team lost to
the Independents of the Encina gym
nasium field in the regular scheduled
match of the California Football
' ea'rue by the score of 3 to 0. The
"Reds," as the second team is desig
nated, suffered a t to ?, defeat.
In spite of the fart that the visitors
were playing with but ten men, the
Cardinal first team was unable to catch
the fast green-jerseyed men, who

showed such marked ability to pass
accurately and shoot goals from dif
ficult angles.
White, Balmain and Kempton were
responsible for the three points of
the Independents. Erb, King, Hig
gins and Reynolds were the best for
Stanford.
The second team journeyed across
the bay and met a picked eleven from
the Bay Counties League. A penalty
goal was the undoing of the Cardinal
players who lost by the close margin
of a point.
