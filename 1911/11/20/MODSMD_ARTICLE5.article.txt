# DOCTORS BELIEVE DANGER OF EPIDEMIC HAS PASSED.
## Developments Show Only Two Additional Cases of Paralysis.â€” Schools Reopen Tuesday. 
### 
Serious danger of epidemic is over
and everything will soon -resume its
normal state according to H. C. Jen
kins, the health officer of Palo Alto,
who states that the Stanford Uni
versity health officers have cooperated
with those of Palo' Alto and have
agreed to open the schools, theatres,
and the Library on Tuesday. It is five
days since the occurrence of the two
deaths from infantile paralysis, and
the appearance of four more probable
cases made an incipient epidemic ap
parent. Two of the cases were ruled
out by consultation and the third case
developed into the disease. The
fourth case showed very suspicious
symptoms of infantile paralysis. The
case appeared Friday, making a
total of two cases, now in quaran
tine. Although the danger that the
rif ease may spread is past, the situ
ation will be closely observed, and all
possible preventitive measures taken.
Late this afternoon Professor H.
Zinsser, Chairman of the Health Com
mittee, made the following statement:
"All cases of infantile paralysis that
have occnred were sporadic, and no
epidemic of the disease is to he feared.
Unless there should be a number of
new cases, there will be no further
interference with campus activities by
the Health Committee."
