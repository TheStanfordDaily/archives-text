# SOPHOMORE COTILLION PLANS TO BE DECIDED.
## Committee Meeting to Be Held Tomorrow Evening.â€”Financial Loss Is Large. 
### 
For the purpose of straightening I
'out matters and making new plans,
the Sophomore Cotillion Committee
will meet tomorrow evening.
Whether or not the Cotillion can be
held this semester will be decided ul-
On at that time . Outside of the
Thanksgiving Vacation period there
remain only three posible dates, but
as hese evnings ar alrady filld by
dances, i is imyrobable that any one
of them will be selected. The va
cation is not considered a good time
to hold the dance because of the crob
able large number of absentees from
the campus.
As matters now stand the
more Class will have a loss of approxi
mately eighty dollars because of the
postponement. Although it was known
Thursday night that the Armory
would not be available because of the
action of Health Officer Gundrum,
plans were made and worked upon for
holding the dance in Encina. It was
rot until about one o'clock Friday af
ternoon that final word was given that
Encina could not be used.
