# A
						Stanford Flower.

### 
We print today a communication
concerning the wearing or a Cardinal
flower. The writer evidently does not

remember that for sev
eral years at least the
dark red chrysanthemum
has been worn by Stan-

ford supporters as a sign of their
loyalty. It is true, that the flower is
not entirely appropriate on account of
its color. The suggestion that gera
niums be used may be accepted on
its merits. Moreover. We Need the
Union.
