To the Editor of "The Daily Palo
Alto": At the inter-collegiate game
one week ago, the California support
ers were far more conspicious than
those of Stanford.The reason was that
the Berkeley enthusiasts had a com
mon emblem which they all wore, the
yellow chrysanthemum—which every
one will admit was beautiful and
made a most pleasing effect.
Of the Stanford supporters, few
wore flowers which were conspicious
at all; the roses and carnations be
ing too small to make any effect.
We regret that there are no cardi
nal chrysanthemums, but unless some
thing better can be found, would it
not be well for Stanford students and
their friends to unite in wearing
several of the dark-red geranium blos
soms? These may be placed to
gether so that the appearance is that
of one large flower, and it could be
seen much farther than rosos or car
nations, with the added advantage of
being easily obtainable by all.
Respectfully yours,
A loyal "Stanfordite."
