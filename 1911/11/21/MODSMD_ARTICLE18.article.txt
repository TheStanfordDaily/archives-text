# BRITISH SHELL BUILDER FASHIONS STANFORD BOAT
## ADDITIONAL EIGHT ADDED TO CARDINAL NAVY. New Acquisition Will Arrive From Putney, England, About December 4.â€”Oarsmen Train Daily. 
### 
Sim, lioat fashioner for Oxford and
Cambridge universities, is the builder
of the latest addition to the Cardinal
rowing equipment. Direct from Put
ney-on-the-Thames, where the biggest
regattas of the English are held and
where the blue-ribbon event of the
water world of the continent is decided
between the two great British univer
sities, this specially constructed shell
is coming on its long ocean voyage
around Cape Horn. By December 4
the Cardinal Varsity expects to be in
possession of their boat.
When the new shell arrives the total
equipment which the Stanford oars
men will have to prepare themselves
for the annual race with California
will consist, of three eight-oared boats
and one four-oared shell. The first
and second Varsity crews will work
out in two larger boats and the Fresh
men candidates will have the use of
the extra eight.
Half of the Cardinal flotilla was
purchased from Columbia and Cor
nell. The Columbia, boat is the oldest
of the Stanford navy. When the Cor
nell acquisition arrived it was the idea
to have the crew use this shell in the
intercollegiate regatta. The eight
proved to be much slower than the
Columbia boat, which has rendered
excellent service to the Stanford
rowers. The new boat is said to be
one of the most finished specimens of
boat craftsmanship. The stamp of
Sim is in itself a guarantee of ex
cellence.
Every afternoon the aspirants for
honors in the Stanford races do pre
liminary training under the direction
of crew captain R. H. Seward, '12.
The men are divided into three squads
and alternate days work on the row
i'l'i machines in Encina gymnasium.
Regular setting-up drill and cross
country runs constitute the routine of
the oarsmen. The Boat-house on La
gunita is the scene of most of this
fall work of the men.
