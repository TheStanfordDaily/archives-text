# T.H. CLAUSSEN, '14, WILL STAR IN "COMPROMISE.'
## Youthful Impersonations in Each Act Will Add Realistic Touches to English Club Play. 
### 
Some of the brightest comedy in
"Compromise," Friday night, will be
seen in the "kid" scenes. There are
several of these in each act and the
juvenile impersonations will all be ex
cellent. All of them will not be im
personations, however, for in the first
act a number of the campus young
sters and several youthful sons of
Stanford professors living in Palo
Alto will star.
Of the impersonators, Miss Ruth
Sampson, '11, and T. H. Claussen, '14,
will make big hits. "Blondy" causes
a stir at every rehearsal for the orig
inal interpretation of his "kid" part.
"Blondy" is a different "kid" every
rehearsal, so it is not known just what
surprise he will spring Friday night.
He can always be relied upon to
carry his part to perfection, however,
so whatever his characterization, it is
bound to be satisfying.
