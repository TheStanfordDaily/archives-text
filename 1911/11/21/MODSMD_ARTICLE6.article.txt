# PROMOTERS OF PEACE ANNOUNCE SUBJECTS
## Six Contestants For Edward Berwick Peace Prize Will Speak in Chapel Tonight. 
### 
In the Chapel, tonight, six students
will contest for the Edward Berwick
Jr., Peace Prize. This is the third
annual peace prize contest, and as the
two speakers making the best show
ing are eligible for the intercollegiate
peace debate, unusual interest is taken
by the devotees of forensic art. Ed
ward Berwick, of Pacific Grove, who
donates the award of fifty dollars, is
to be one of the three judges.
The speakers and subjects are:
Grant Holcomb — "Cooperation and
Competition."
Patterson Dane Nowell — "More
Money For Peace."
Edgar Clarence Smith—"Uncondi
tional Arbitration Treaties."
Ichiji Miyata Akahoshi—"A World
Language and Peace."

of Truth."
Frank Howard Hilton —"War and
National Strength."
