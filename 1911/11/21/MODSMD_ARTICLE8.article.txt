# TIE MATCH RESULTS IN FIRST INTERCLUB GAME
## STRONG BREAKER TEAM FAILS TO SCORE. Exciting Rugby In Set-to Between Teams 1 and 7 on Stanford Field. 
### 
Until darkness descended upon Stan
ford Field last evening, Teams 1 and
7 fought to a tie in the first of the
Post-Season Rugby series. Team 1 is
composed of Breakers; Team 7, Delta
Upsilon, Kappa Alpha, Delta Kappa
Epsilon, and Madrono. The contest
was one of the closest games ever
witnessed between two campus aggre
gations. The match was a forward
battle from the start to the finish.
Team 1, the Breakers fifteen, used
the eight man scrum formation and
had a slight advantage over the seven
man forward group of Team 7. The
ball was played almost entirely with
the feet. A few passing rushes were
gotten under way but they simply
resulted in carrying the ball across
the field with little or no gain.
The Breakers proved to be the
liest workers in the scrum and their
opponents were forced to put most of
their energy into holding the bigger
scrum against them. In the loose the
ball wandered about the field accord
ing to luck.
Breakers Best in First Half.
In the first period the Breakers had
the advantage. Only twice did the
ball make a sojourn into Breakerland,
the rest of the time they were press
ing for a score but were never able to
take the ball over at the critical mo
ment. The last half was even livelier
than the first. Several times the ball
went nearly the length of the field
before it was checked. The game was
allowed to go over a few minutes of
the allotted time but neither team was
able to push their advantage far
enough to bring a score.
V. M. Smith, '14, was the star of
the game. Playing at wing he used the
position to secure the ball time and
time again and ran the leather oval
in or to reach touch when close-press
ed. Ambrose and Fyfe played well.
Both were in the thick of the work and
were fast to get the forwards into
action. Peters figured several times.
He got away several good kicks.
The line-ups were:
Team I—Grace, Williams, Swanson,
Boyd, Jacomini, Peck, Watkins. Wood
cock, forwards; Ambrose, half; Tay
lor, Dooling, fives; Fletcher, center;
Campbell, V. Smith, Wings; R. Brown,
full.
Team 7 —Pyle, Heilbron, Phares,
Bloeser, Runyon, Clover, Chandler,
forwards; Fyfe, wing forward; Clau
sen, half; H. Andrews, Peters, fives:
Kauffman, center; Macread.v, F. Roth,
wings; R. Andrews, full.
