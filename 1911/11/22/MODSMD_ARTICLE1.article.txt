# LAYING FOUNDATIONS FOR THE NEW POWER HOUSE
## PROFESSOR DURAND DRAWS UP PLANS. Building Will Furnish Heat to an Extended Portion of Campus.â€” Cost, $14,000. 
### 
Building activity on the campus is
thriving. Not only are the contractors
beginning to work on the reconstruc
tion of the Memorial Church, but
another contractor arrived on the
scene yesterday to begin the work on
the new power house for the Univer
sity. The foundations for a building
have been laid out at a point on the
left hand side of the car-tracks look
ing north and about half-way between
the Encina walk and the athletic
grounds. Here the building will be
erected.
The plans for the structure have
been prepared by Professor W. F.
Durand, of the Mechanical Engineer
ing department. They call for a one
story stone and concrete structure
similar in general design to the pres
ent power houses and the shops at the
rear of the Quad. The main portion
of the buUding will measure 115x48
feet with an ell on the front measur
ing 27x48 feeet.
Economical Use of Buildings.
When the need of new buildings for
laboratory purposes was found to have
become a necessity the Hoard of Trus
tees decided that the most economical
and expeditious way to get the space
for the shops was to move the power
house from its present quarters to a
new location. The boilers and ma
chinery for the present power-house
occupy two buildings. By placing the
machinery and boilers from these two
buildings in a new structure two new
shops will be opened up for an out
lay of less than the construction of
two new shop buildings would necessi
tate.
The new situation of the power
house will have many advantages
over the present one. As a center of
distribution for the Quad proper it
will not be much more out of the way
than the quarters now used for that
purpose. The Hoard of Trustees ex
pect in the near future to connect
the Chemistry and Museum buildings
which are now heated by separate
plants with the main power house.
The new site is much more conveni
ent for this purpose than the one
now occupied. It is further pointed
out by those in charge that if the
Board of Trustees everd ecide to re
build the wrecked gymnasium and
library buildings, the new power
plant will be in their immediate
vicinity.
Not Much Work Involved.
No vast amount of work will be
necessary to connect the new power
house to the present distribution sys
tem of tunnels and conduits by which
the University buildings are heated.
A tunnel runs at the present time from
the Quad to Encina and it will be to
some point in this that the main dis
tributing line of the new power house
will he carried, either by tunnel or
conduit.
New equipment, in the shape of
boilers, machinery and the like may
be purchased in future but nothing
definite has been done in this regard
as yet. The single building will con
tain, however, the boilers, heating
and lighting machinery for the entire
Quadrangle. A new oil tank consider
ably larger than the one now used for
the storage of liquid fuel will be in
stalled.
The contract price for the building
calls for an expenditure of about
$14,000. This sum will he consider
ably increased before the machinery
has been moved, a new stack pur
chased, tunnels and conduits built and
other work of installation completed.
