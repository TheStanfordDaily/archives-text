# Misinformed.

Here is someone who is "misin
formed." The following is taken from
a recent issue of the "University of
Washington Daily."
"Decision that the rugby brand of
football is inferior to the old type
was reached Saturday evening at a
banquet of the alumni of Stanford
:;nd the University of California, the
only two co-educational institutions
in the United States where the Eng
lish game is played.
"Despite the opposition of Pres. Da
vid Starr Jordan and Benjamin Tde
Wheeler, it was decided to take ac
tive steps at once toward the intro
duction of the American game into
the two colleges and toward arrang
ing a Pacific Coast championship
schedule."
Where the news of the above came
from is more than the Daily Palo
Alto would care to say. It does not
matter particularly, at any event. Yet
we wish to make it known as coming
from Stanford that this "decision" is
the product of a dreamer or news
paper correspondent writing for the
joy of it. Moreover, We Need the
Union.
