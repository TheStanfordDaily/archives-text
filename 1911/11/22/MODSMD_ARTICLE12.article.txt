To the Editor of "The Daily Palo Alto:
A proposition lias been made to
unite the Women's League and the
Stanford's Women's Club under the
former name. This is to be considered
Thursday at 12:15, an hour when
only those interested in the change
will make the effort to be present.
As an alumna, a member of the Club
House and not of the League, I should
like to suggest some difficulties. The
Stanford Women's Club is a financial
and executive organization for the pur
pose of raising money for a clubhouse.
Later, it will have the responsibility
of running the clubhouse for a largely
non-resident membership. The club
has been incorporated as the Stanford
Women's Club to build this house, and
money has been raised for that pur
pose.
The League is purely social. It
exists for the sake of bringing to
gether Stanford women and its dues
are purely nominal, enough to serve
light refreshments once a month.
The Club House, on the contrary,
cannot exist on nominal dues. Any
such club is rather expensive to run.
Why should the undergraduate who
could afford to enjoy the social inter
course of the League be forced to pay
the heavier clubhouse dues or forego
boths The League meetings will
doubtless be held in the clubhouse,
but the aims of the two clubs are so
different that there seems to be no
object, as there is certainly no econ
omy, in uniting them.
It should be borne in mind that the
present membership of the Stanforl
Women's Club consists of all Stanford
women who have taken out a life mem
bership, but when the club is built
those who are paying the yearly dues
will also be members.
