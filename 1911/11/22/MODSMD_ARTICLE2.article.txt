# SOCIALIST CLUB OF STANFORD ORGANIZED.
## Organization Will Not Be Affiliated With National Party.â€”Membership Open to Women. 
### 
For the purpose of discusing plans
relative to forming a Socialist Club
about twenty men met this afternoon
and presented their views. There
were two factions, one wanting the
club as a political propaganda and
the other as an association to study
the economic problems of the day.
It was finally decided to organize the
club for the purpose of the study of
social problems with particular em
phasis on the socialistic point of view
and to be known as the Socialist Club
of Stanford. A committee was ap
pointed to draw up by-laws and a
constitution. A meeting for the pur
pose of organization will be held on
Sunday night, the place to be an
nounced later in the week. Member
ship in the club is not limited to men.
but may include women also.
