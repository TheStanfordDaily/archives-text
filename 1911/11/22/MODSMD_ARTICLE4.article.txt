The call of the missionary field to
the college woman in her choice of
a vocation was the special subject
of the talk by Deaconess Hodgkin of
Oakland, yesterday afternoon at the
Young Women's Christian Associa
tion.
An important change in the ad
ministrative work of the Association
was announced by the President, Miss
L. Blanchard, '12. Hereafter, a plan
known in other universities as the
Council system will be adopted.
These council meetings will be open
for others besides the appointed dele
gates. The first one will be in the
Vestry nt seven-fifteen Thursday even

are urged to come and participate in
the discussions.
