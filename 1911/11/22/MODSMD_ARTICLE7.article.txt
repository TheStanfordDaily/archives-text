# TEAM TWO VICTOR IN POST-SEASON CONTEST
## PALO ALTO AGGREGATION WINS 8-0 YESTERDAY. Dashing Run Feature of Game on Turf in Which Many Stars Appear. 
### 
In a game which showed every
brand of rugby play, ranging from
rather ludicrous efforts to rallies
which would not have been out of
place in an intercollegiate contest,
Team Two, the Palo Alto players, de
feated Team Eight, the Phi Kappa
Psi, Phi Gamma Delta, and Kappa
Sigma combination, by an 8-0 score
on the turf yesterday afternoon. Dark
ness brought an end to the contest in
the second half, while the players
were apparently eager for more, and
not showing any signs of fatigue.
IJoth teams went on the field with
a sprinkling of well-known rugby
stars, but several dashing players in
Palo Alto's backfield brought her
victory. Good boots to touch were
often in evidence, hut passing rushes
on the part of either were infrequent.
However, when Palo Alto succeeded
in getting the leather to her speedy
fives or wings, a good gain was sure
to result, while Gard and Durns
proved consistent ground gainers for
the campus aggregation, each featur
ing with a good run. Risling, Tem
pleton and Durns were stars of the
game.
Palo Alto's first try came early in
the opening period, when Risling se
cured on a pass at 25 and went
straight across for the tally. Risling
failed on the conversion. After this,
play zigzagged throughout the half.
Team Eight several times threaten
ing Team Two's goal, but neither fif
teen being able to put the ball over
the white mark.
Detween halves Captain Doulware,
of Palo Alto, gave his men an earnest
talk, which sent them into the fray
with renewed determination. The
first result of this came in the shape
of a tally by Smith, who secured from
the loose at 25. Templeton made the
three a five. After this play became
open, booting along the ground and
kicking in the loose being the order
of the day.
J. O. Miller, '08, was the man with
the whistle.
