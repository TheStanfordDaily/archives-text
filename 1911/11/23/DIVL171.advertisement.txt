THE greatest joy that follows the
hardships of training, is the moment
that you can heap the briar bowl with
good old Velvet. Superb leaf —the
tenderest leaf —aged over two years —
perfect maturity —disappearance of all
leaf harshness—leaving that rare degree of
mellowness —superb flavor —the smooth
ness so enjoyable. Velvet is free from
all harshness. Smoke Velvet as often as
you like, always cool burning —"good
old stuff!" At all dealers.
