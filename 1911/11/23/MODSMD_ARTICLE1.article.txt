Golfers (Jet Recognition.
In future, golfers representing the
University in intercollegiate contests
will bear officially the name of Stan
ford teams. This was decided upon
last evening, when the question of
whether the golf teams should be re
cognized as a branch of the Univer
sity's athletic groups was brought up.
The team will play in all coming con
tests as the regular golf team of Stan
ford.
Through an unfortunate oversight in
the issue of the Daily Palo Alto for
November 16, reporting the actions of
the Executive Committee for the meet
ing of November 15, the names of L.
Cass, '13, and E. B. Corbet, '11, were
omitted from the list of those re
ceiving emblems for football. Cass re
ceives a block "S" even though he did
not play in the last intercollegiate
game, and Corbet is given a German
"S" among the others on the substitute
list.
