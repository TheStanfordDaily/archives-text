We are glad to note that the women
of the University have secured stu
dent control, within limits, .lust how
much they can accomplish now and

what use they will make of
their newly-acquired power
will depend upon the capa
cities of the Committee of

live who represent them.
It may now be said that the men of
the University are backward in not
securing this same control for them
selves. There is no comparison, how
ever, between either the number or
the character of the cases that the
men's committee and the women's
committee would have to deal with.
The men are at this time doing much
more to help keep things in smooth
running order than most people, prob
ably, appreciate.
But the women have made one step
forward at least, and we wish them
luck. Moreover, We Need the Union.
