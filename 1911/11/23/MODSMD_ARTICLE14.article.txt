To the Editor of the Daily Palo Alto:
The author of the communication In
the Wednesday evening edition of the
Daily Palo Alto, with reference to
centralizing the women's organizations
on the campus, so misunderstands the
club situation upon the campus and
the desirability of a central organiza
tion as many of us see it, that I am
constrained to say a few words by way
of explanation.
In the first place, the name "Wo
men's League" is not proposed for the
contemplated organization. On the
contrary, though many of us would
regretfully give up a name of nine
years' standing, we would waive our
feeling in the larger interest, provided
a better name could be agreed upon.
The author speaks of the Women's
Club as a "financial and executive or
ganization." its finance committee,
only, has this function. This financial
committee was apointed by the Wo
men's League to exercise this func
tion.
The new central organization pro
poses to retain this finance com
mittee for this function. This com
mittee has proven faithful and respon
sible and its work is appreciated by
every interested woman in the Uni
versity.
"The clubhouse," the author goes
on to state, is to be run"for a largely
non-resident membership." Well, what
ever the non-resident membership
may be , and we want it to be large,—
we wish it could include every alumna
and ex-alumna of the University.
What we all want is a clubhouse
that shall be for the use of every wo
man connected with the University in
any way, and for every alumna whose
interest leads her back to her Alma
Mater.
"The League is purely social," says
the article, "and exists for the sake
of bringing together Stanford women."
So it is, and that is just the reason
we need the clubhouse bring to
gether the Stanford women, to make
us a more united and more efficient
body, to give us an opportunity of
knowing each other better and of be
coming more useful to one another
and to the University.
"The clubhouse cannot exist," says
the writer, "on nominal dues." The
clubhouse cannot exist without sup
port, certainly, and so the question of
clubhouse suport is a larger ques
tion than the question of the building
fund, which is already provided for
through the life membership system.
Tt seems like good economy, there
fore to unite the efforts of all for the
good of all.
It is for this reason that the Wo
men's League are asking the Women's
Club to co-operate with them in bring
ing about the organized relationship
that is certainly desirable if the club
house, when built, is to have the place
and the support that it should have
upon the campus.
Moreover, We Need the Union, also.

poses to retain this finance com
mittee for this function. This com
mittee has proven faithful and respon
sible and its work is appreciated by
every interested woman in the Uni
versity.
"The clubhouse," the author goes
on to state, is to be run"for a largely
non-resident membership." Well, what
ever the non-resident membership
may be , and we want it to be large,—
we wish it could include every alumna
and ex-alumna of the University.
What we all want is a clubhouse
that shall be for the use of every wo
man connected with the University in
any way, and for every alumna whose
interest leads her back to her Alma
Mater.
"The League is purely social," says
the article, "and exists for the sake
of bringing together Stanford women."
So it is, and that is just the reason
we need the clubhouse bring to
gether the Stanford women, to make
us a more united and more efficient
body, to give us an opportunity of
knowing each other better and of be
coming more useful to one another
and to the University.
"The clubhouse cannot exist," says
the writer, "on nominal dues." The
clubhouse cannot exist without sup
port, certainly, and so the question of
clubhouse suport is a larger ques
tion than the question of the building
fund, which is already provided for
through the life membership system.
Tt seems like good economy, there
fore to unite the efforts of all for the
good of all.
It is for this reason that the Wo
men's League are asking the Women's
Club to co-operate with them in bring
ing about the organized relationship
that is certainly desirable if the club
house, when built, is to have the place
and the support that it should have
upon the campus.
Moreover, We Need the Union, also.
