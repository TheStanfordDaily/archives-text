# CALIFORNIA NOTES
## 
### 
The"Daily Caiifornian'' is making
an editorial attack on professors who
impose too much work on their
classes.
Berkeley High won the majority of
the points in the recent swimming
meet with the University swimmers.
Berkeley won the six man relay by a
lap.
The "Occident" is to inaugurate a
prize system in connection with the
sale of the December issue. Each
copy will be numbered and corres
ponding numbers will be placed in a
ballot box. The drawing will take
place on December 8. Four prizes
will be awarded.
The manager of the last "Blue and
Gold" has reported a surplus of $210.
70 on hand from the publication. The
editor has been awarded a gift of
$100 by the class of 1912.
Although California has not received
an invitation from the Canadian Rugby
Union to make the Christmas holiday
visit it is almost certain that the
players will make the trip. Vancouver
and Victoria play for the championship
on December 3, and it is not until
after that date that the invitation will
be extended. Hardy and Watts are
the only Varsity men unable to go.
