# TWO FUNDS ESTABLISHED BY UNIVERSITY GUILD.
## Provisions Are Being Made For An Isolation Hospital and Proper Handling of Epidemics. 
### 
At the last meeting of the Official
Board of the Students' Guild, a build
ing fund and an emergency fund were
established, into which yearly sur
pluses may be placed. There is $2400
in the building fund, which was ob
tained through the sale of a cottage
in Lytton street in Palo Alto, which
the Guild owned. This fund at pres
ent is in the hands of the Palo Alto
Building and Loan Association, and is
drawing six per cent interest. It is
the desire of the Guild to equip an
isolation hospital when the occasion
demands it, and as the present fund
is not large enough to furnish one
completely, money will be added to it
from time to time. The emergency
fund contains $2000, which has been
set aside to be used in case of an epi
demic. If a serious epidemic should
arise, extra nurses and accommoda
tions would have to be provided, and
this fund would enable the Guild to
cope with it properly.
The organization has been exceed
ingly fortunate so far this semester,
in that its bills have been lower than
they ordinarily are. Hopes of a small
surplus at the end of the semester are
being entertained.
