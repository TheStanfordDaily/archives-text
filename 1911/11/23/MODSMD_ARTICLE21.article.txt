# LACK OF INTEREST IN ORIGINAL PRODUCTIONS.
## 
### 
That the Students are showing a
surprising lack of interest in original
musical productions for the Stanford
stage, is the opinion of J. H. Forbes,
chairman of the Junior Opera Com
mittee. Only one opera has yet been
submitted to the committee and tho
the time limit was extended once or
twice, there apparently has been bo
effort made to prepare a libretto and
score for competition.
At the last meeting of the Com
mittee, December 1 was definitely set
as the day on which the opera must
be submitted. It is advisable to in
"'ude i 1 the manuscript the settine; of
the opera, or at least to indicate it.
Manuscripts should be signed and
sent to Chairman J. H. Forbes of the
Opera Committee.
