# DISCIPLINARY CONTROL IS GIVEN TO WOMEN
## STUDENT AFFAIRS COMMITTEE DELEGATES POWERS. All Cases of Deportment and General Matter in Hands of Judicial Board. 
### 
What practically amounts to full
student control for the women of the
University was tendered yesterday to
the Judicial Board of the Women's
Conference by the Student Affairs
Committee of the University. This
was made known when the letter
quoted below was received and sub
scribed to by the members of the
Judicial Board. This move was not
unexpected, as the women had signi
fied their readiness to assume the re
sponsibility of student control some
time ago and were only waiting the
sanction of the Student Affairs Com
mittee to take charge.
The letter reads as follows:
"The Judicial Board of the Women's
Conference of the University having
expressed its readiness and desire to
assume responsibility for the govern
ment of the women of the University,
the Committee on Student Affairs here
by authorize this assumption of re
sponsibility and delegates its functions
to the Judicial Board under the follow
ing conditions:
"1. The standards of conduct and
regulations governing students adopt
ed by the University and exercised
through its Committee on Student Af
fairs shall remain in force and be
maintained by the Judicial Board.
"2. The Judicial Board is author
ized to make such other rules, not in
consistent with University regulations,
as it may deem wise and expedient.
"3. Cases involving discipline shall
be considered by the Judicial Board
and recommendations made to the
Committee on Student Affairs.
"4. At the end of each semester a
written report of the activities of the
Judicial Board shall be filed with the
Committee on Student Affairs.
The authority hereby delegated
may be withdrawn at any time when
the interests of the University shall
seem to require such action."
The meaning of all the conditions
is clear with the possible exception
of the third. This clause means that
the Judicial Board will hereafter de
cide the penalty in cases of discipline
and recommend their decision to the
Student Affairs Comittee. Probably
in no case will this decision be
changed, but it is a rule of the Univer
sity that the Student. Affairs Com
mittee be the body to take action.
Last spring, at a mass meeting, the
women of the University voted in
favor of having a Judicial Board
chosen from the Executive Board of
Women's League to undertake stu
dent government for the women. The
members chosen were Miss N. Moise,
'12, Miss G. Workman, '12, Miss R.
Sampson, '12, Miss L. Bell, '12, and
Miss D. Marx, '11.
