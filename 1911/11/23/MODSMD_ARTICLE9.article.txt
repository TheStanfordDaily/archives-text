# TEAM 5 DEFEATS TEAM 6 IN POST-SEASON SERIES
## SNAPPY BRAND OF RUGBY MARKS EVEN CONTEST. Team Work Causes 5 to 0 Victory in Fastest Game of Interclub Schedule. 
### 
In one of the best games seen on
Stanford Field this year for speed and
general snappiness of play, team 6,
composed of players from Beta Theta
Pi, Delta Chi, and Alpha Tan Omega,
went down before the sturdy group
picked from Phi Delta Theta, Delta
Tau Delta, and Chi Psi. It was a
clear case of superiority of team work
that won the game.
For a few minutes after the opening
of the game team 6 rushed the ball
down the field and threatened their
opponents' goal. This state of affairs
did not last long, however, and for the
greater portion of the game the ball
was in team G territory.
In no post-season game of this year
has such general speed of both for
wards and backs been shown as was
exhibited in last evening's contest.
Apparently forgetting that there was
any such word in the book as "train
ing" both teams fought with a fury
and determination that would have
done credit to a Varsity contest. The
game never stopped for a moment.
Passes, short kicks, and all the tricks
of trade of the experienced rugby
player were exhibited.
Ball in Team <> Territory.
In the second half with occasional
breaks the ball was almost entirely
in team 6 teritory. ft was not until
near the end of this period, however,
that the ball was rushed down to
their 15 yard line, where from a ruck
the spheroid was carried over after
a pretty passing rush, Roberts to T.
Sanborn, to Noble, who made the try
and caried the ball directly under the
posts. T. Sanborn converted.
With only a few minutes left to
play and with total darkness rapidly
approaching, team G made a desperate
fight to tie the score. The odds
against them were too great, however.
The game ended with the ball in
mid-field.
