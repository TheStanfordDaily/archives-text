Three is composed of players from

representing Sigma Alpha Epsilon and
Sigma Nu. Seven tries were made by
the victors, two of them being con
verted by B. E. Erb, '12. The final
score came in the last seconds of play,

comparison with the star contest ot
the previous day, it still evidenced the

rallies were not frequent, although oc
casionally the fast Team Four back
field in attacking formation sent the
ball down the route from half to
wing in their effort to advance it.
