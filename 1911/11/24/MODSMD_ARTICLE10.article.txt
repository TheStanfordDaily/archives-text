At 2:30 he will see rugby of the first
water, when the Civil Engineers play
the Miners. At 3:30 the Barbarians
play the Stanford soccer team.
The inter-department game will be
a fast set-to. Since the close of the
major rugby season this game has
been discussed between the two fac
tions and rivalry is keyed high. With
each side having their fifteen well
padded with the veterans of the past
rugby schedule the game should be
filled with the spectacular plays of the
stars. With the rugby adepts
sprinkled throughout the lineups a
surprising degree of efficient team
work will be seen.

Soccer Teams Clash.
At 3:30 the Stanford soccer team
will meet the Barbarians in the regu
lar weekly contest of the California
Football League. This is the second
clash of the two elevens. In the for
mer game the Cardinal players were
victorious by a 2 to 1 score. Coach
H. W. Maloney thinks that his men
will repeat their win but he expects a
hard battle. He has given consider
able time of late to polishing off the
rougher edges of the Stanford team
and believes that the combination
play and team work of the Cardinal
eleven will show marked improvement
to-morrow.
