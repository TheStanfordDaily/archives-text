Rugby for the benefit of the Stan
ford Union will be served up for all
tastes to-morrow afternoon on the

turf — the good game
scheduled between the
Mining and Engineering
departments, the soccer

contest, and last, but by no means
least, the struggle of the newspaper
correspondents and the staffs of the
Daily Palo Alto, the Chaparral and the
Sequoia, for supremacy.
The games will be worth seeing, for
the small admission charge and, being
also for the purpose of helping the
Union, should bring a good crowd to
the field. These additions to the build
ing fund, made from time to time will
do much toward raising the necessary
money and will serve also to keep the
project before the students. Moreover,
We Need the Union.
