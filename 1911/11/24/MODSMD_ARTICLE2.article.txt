# FALL TRACK SEASON TO BE OPENED TO-MORROW.
## Distances Will Be Shortened.—Meet Scheduled for 10 O'clock.—Excellent Times Expected. 
### 
To-morrow morning at ten o'clock
the initial track meet of the fall
season will be held on the Stanford
cinder path. All of the longer dis
tances will be shortened as is custom
ary at this period of training. Most
of the entries are men who have never
won their letter on the oval. The
meet should prove highly interesting
and some early season records are
likely to be established as some of the
athletes have been showing up un
usually well.
T. L. Coleman, '12, track captain,
and "Dad" Moulton will be in charge
of the meet. The officials announced
lirt '''ght are requested to be at the
training house at the appointed hour
so that the events may be run off as
scheduled.
