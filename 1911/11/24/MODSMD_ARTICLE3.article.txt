# THE 						TIMES BUILDING IS AGAIN DESTROYED.
## Phi Delta Phi Initiates Eight Members Before the College Public This Morning. 
### 
"The Destruction of the Times
Building" caused considerable fun and
excitement on the Quad this morning.
Eight initiates into Phi Delta Phi
legal fraternity, presented this
heavy melodrama in three parts. At
9:15 the troupe made their "grand en
try" in an automobile and on bicycles.
"A Rushen' Anarchist" took the op
portunity to denounce the existing or
der of things and offered $10,000 to
the man who would destroy the Times
Building.
At 10:15 the plot thickened and the
deed was done. "Cicero Mutt" and his
mother bewailed their need for money.
Then "Mutt" and "Jeff" arrived and af
ter the customary horse-play "MiP.t"
burned the "Times" and "Jeff" agreed
to take the blame.
It took "Defective Burns" just one
hour to capture his man. "Jeff" was
accused, arrested, and hung to the ap
parent satisfaction of everyone. "Joy"
and "Gloom" were "also present."
"Fooleries of Stanford" on the Post
Office steps were exceptionally good.
The take-offs and imitations of charac
ters in the recent football show were
clever.
