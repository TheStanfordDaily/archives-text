# "COMPROMISE" IS A DESERVED SUCCESS
## CRITIC GIVES GOOD ACCOUNT OF PLAY. Congratulates English Club on Presentation.â€”Faults and Virtues of Drama Are Noted. 
### 
The performance last Friday even
ing of Professor Gray's play, "The
Compromise," under the auspices of
the English Club, was a success, and
on the whole a deserved success. I say
on the whole, because the audience
felt that the first act dragged on ac
count of its somewhat obviously ex
planatory character and its lack of
action. The theme of the whole play
too was somewhat blurred, since it
was not clear whether after all the
dramatist was mainly concerned with
a political problem involving a con
llict of principles, or with the simpler
private problem ot" getting Murdock
married to Barbara. Just what com
promise did Murdock make? Be that
as it may, Murdock did win Barbara,
thanks to a very skilful and ingenious
management of the final situation.
The third act, in short, was good
throughout, and was at times brilliant.
Actors Show Self-Reliance.
It is of course an amateur and not
a professional standard that must be
applied to the performance itself. The
actors showed self-reliance, although
in the first act the whole cast was ap
parently a little nervous, and some or
the dialogue was smothered in conse
quence. They got bravely over this
difficulty, however, and except for a
little haste in delivering lines when
the audience laughed or applauded,
they seemed to have all their wits
about them. Of the men, Mr. Soper
and Mr. Washburn did excellent work
in character parts. Worthington's 'ex
pressive back* in Act 111 was really
capital, and one should call attention
to Simpkins' first entrance as particu
larly good. More difficult parts to
sustain were those of Brash and Mur
dock. Mr. Beach showed commend
able restraint, and was especially ef
fective in the management of his
voice. Every intonation told. One
asks, however. whether Murdock
should not have been a little cruder,
for example, a little less completely
master of himself under the awkward
conditions of the second act. Mr.
Owens carried off a very difficult part
with considerable credit, but perhaps
it would be a little unfair to any un
dergraduate to ask him to represent
the part of a maturely cynical man of
tlie world. Miss Holmes, as Barbara,
played the role in too intense a vein.
If Barbara took life as seriously as
Miss Holmes made her ont to do in
the first act, why on earth didn't she
marry Murdock at once? Surely the
kind of society by which she was sur
rounded in the second act could hardly
have been a real temptation. (By the
way, aren't the vulgarity and bad man
ners of 'high society' in Act II some
what exaggerated?). At times, more
over. Miss Holmes did not speak loud
enough. so that many of her lines
were lost, a criticism that in some
measure applies also to Miss Bullis.
Otherwise, both of these young ladies
