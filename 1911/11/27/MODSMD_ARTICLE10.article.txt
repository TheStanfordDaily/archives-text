The giving of a cup for rugby con
tests by President Hopkins of the
Board of Trustees is, to our mind, a

awakened interest be

been the main cause of complaint on
the part of the undergraduates for
years. With the overcoming of this
lack there should be and undoubtedly
will be appreciation of the new order.
Moreover, We Need the Union.
