Editor, Daily Palo Alto:
As a last word in response to the
communication in Thursday's paper,
I would call attention to the much
more democratic appeal made by the
Woman's Club House than by the
League to every alumnus, faculty
member and undergraduate. The
Woman's Club House is to be a cen
tral meeting place for every social or
ganization of the university, whether
it be the league or any other club.
The girls have united for this club
house with unprecedented enthusiasm,
while at times there has been a lack of
enthusiasm in the league among the
undergraduates. Therefore I believe
that it would be a mistake to combine
these two organizations. The League
dues only suffice to meet the current
expenses, therefore we do not see any
financial help to be gained thereby
for the clubhouse. If the League were
bringing any great accession of in
terest to the clubhouse, perhaps all
other issues could be overlooked. But
since the interest in most enthusiastic
now I see no object to be gained in
the proposed incorporation.
