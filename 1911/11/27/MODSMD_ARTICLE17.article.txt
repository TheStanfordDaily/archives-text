priate drawings and articles will ap
pear tomorrow morning. The con
tributions this month have been par
ticularly fine and the best issue of
the semester is expected.
The front page drawing is a pretty
girl's head on a stippled background
by Stan Dixon, ex-'l2, with the cus
tomary verse under it. "Thankfully
Too Tough" is the title of a very comi
cal full page cut by Miss M. Bailey,
'14, which is one oL' the cleverest
sketches the magazine has had in
some time. A third full page draw
ing is from the pen of Miss Hazel
Clark, '15, and is in keeping with the
general theme of the issue.
Karl Green, '13, is the author of the
front page poem on the subject of
"Thanksgiving." The "Dilettante" is
written by M. T. Dooling, '11, and is
an especially clever one. E. W. Pugh,
'11, has contributed a very humorous
article on the subject of "Turkey For
All," in which he explains how every
one on the campus may secure free
turkey for Thanksgiving. A burles
que story, "Johnny Scramble Makes a
Million," by M. T. Dooling, '11, the
author of "Get Rich Slick Falling
Hard," is one of the most amusing
pieces in the paper. It is illustrated
by J. L. Duff. '13.
Other drawings in the issue are by
G. C. Smith, '10, E. E. Manning, '13.
M. W. Allen, '15, and J. Olson, *15.

Wood, '13, W. F. Kilcline, '15.
Editor Ij. D. Summerfield, '12,
has some snappy "Now Thats" on
"Thanksgiving," what we have to be
thankful for, "Dress Suits," and the
English Club's use of the Chaparral's
"Now Thats" to advertise the Com
promise.
