# CALIFORNIA NOTES
## 
### 
The spirit of senior control in the
University received new impetus at
the last Senior Singing, which was
attended by faculty members. Better
ment of conditions through the oppor
tunities afforded by student govern
ment was the theme of most of the
speeches.
The graduate students have a regu
lar organization similar to that of
the classes. A. J. Eddy, *10, is presi
dent.
The total appropriations from the
state treasury to the University have
been $127,546.23 to date. It is esti
mated that they will total $760,000 at
the end of the year.
The Glee Club is to journey north
during the Christmas holidays. Port
land, Seattle, Vancouver and other
cities will he visited. Funds were
raised at a concert last Friday.
