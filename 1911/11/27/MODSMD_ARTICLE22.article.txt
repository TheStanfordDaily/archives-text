# STANFORD DEFEATED BY BARBARIANS IN SOCCER.
## City Players Score the Most Points Despite the Cardinal's Aggressiveness. 
### 
Ability to kick goals at the proper
time was responsible for the victory
of the Barbarians over the Stanford
soccer eleven by the score of 3 to 1
Saturday afternoon. The game was
played on the rugby turf instead of the
Encina gymnasium field. Clever block
ing on the part of the visiting backs
and the failure of the Cardinal players
to score many apparent goals were the
features of the contest. Stanford kept
the ball in her opponent's territory
throughout the game, but was unable
to kick into the net.
Darkness settled over the field be
fore the end of the game and the last
of the clubmen's points was made at
a time when the goalkeeper was un
able to see the ball. Elliott and Mc-
Kenzie made the scores for the Bar
barians and Iliggins shot the lone
Stanford tally.
Reynolds, B. Erb, A. Erb and Stuart
were the best for the losers, Elliott,
Buckingham and Stevenson played
well for the city men.
