# CARNIVAL OF RUGBY IS WEEK-END FEATURE
## NOVICES AND VETERANS PLAY SIDE BY SIDE. Breakers, Civil Engineers, and Palo Alto Win From Opponents in Snappy Set-to's. 
### 
Fifteen husky players from the
Civil Engineering department put the
ball over the Geology and Mining line
once Saturday, and, converting, won
by a 5-0 score. The game was hard
fought and fast, and the ball journeyed
from one end of the field to the other
often enough to lend the game plenty
of spice and interest.
While each team contained in its
lineup the names of several well
known rugby stars, the general stan
dard of rugby was so good that these
men did not stand out head and
shoulders above the others. Individu
al playing on both sides was of the
first water, team work being the only
lacking aspect.
Dr. Brainier Kick-oft'.
Dr. J. C. Branner, of the Geology de
partment, kicked off at about 2:45,
kicked off twice, in fact. The hardest
kind of fighting then ensued. The
Civil Engineering score came when
Taylor received a pass from the loose
at 10 and went across, Miller convert
ing and making it five. In the second
period the Geology and Mining play
ers threatened for some time to tie
the score. A hard battle was fought
around the Civil Engineers' goal but
the score board remained unaltered.
Dr. F. Angell, of the Psychology de
partment, proved his right to be
classed among real referees by act
ing as arbitrator in a highly satis
factory manner.
Palo Alto Wins Close Game.
Team 2, Palo Alto, won from team 5,
Phi Delta Theta, Delta Tau Delta, and
Chi Psi, in the first game of the semi
finals of the post-season rugby series
on Saturday. The final score was
13-0.
The first half was close throughout
and numerous chances to score were
lost to both sides by over-anxiety. At
the end of this period Palo Alto led
5-0.
During the second half the play was
more open and many long runs were
made. For Palo Alto W. L. Smith and
Templeton put up the best game, while
T. Sanborn and Noble starred for
team 5.

Breakers Wallop Team 7.
Team No. 1 overwhelmed team No.
7 in a fast contest Friday, emerging
on the long end of a 13-0 score. The
game was marked by consistent play
ing of both aggregations and it was
only the fact that the victors had more
older players in their ranks, that de
cided the outcome.
