SMOOTHEST
TOBACCO
OVER the hills with dog and Velvet is
companionship indeed!
Velvet, famous as the finest leaf from old Ken
tacky—aged by time —the only make-sure pro
cess. The leaf hangs in the old warehouse for
over 2 years —gradually changing from green
to mellow — then you get the smooth, full
flavored, good tasting smoke that the southern
planters themselves like. Never a bite in
such tobacco.
Velvet! Don't forget!
