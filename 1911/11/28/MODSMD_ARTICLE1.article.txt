# WOMEN VOTE TO JOIN LEAGUE AND CLUBHOUSE.
## Two Separate Organizations Will be Merged if Measure Is Accepted By Club. 
### 
The two measures recommended by
the committe appointed to inquire into
the existing relationship between the
two organizations, Women's League
and the Stanford Women's Club, were
passed by a two-thirds vote at the
mass meeting held at 12:15 today in
the Chapel.
These measures read as follows:
1. That the Stanford Women's
League vote its willingness to unite
with the Stanford Women's Club in
organized relationship.
2. That the Stanford Women's
League ask the Stanford Women's
Clul) by formal petition to cooperate
with them in bringing about this or
ganized relationship.
These recommendations have been
before the women of the University
for some time and they were passed
today after due consideration and dis
cussion.
Organizations Would Merge.
If the Stanford Women's Club ac
cept the invitation, as it is extended
in the recommendations, it means
that the two separate organizations as
they exist today shall become one or
ganization known either as the Wo
men's League or as the Stanford Wo
men's Club, acting under one consti
tution, the final aim and purpose be
ing to procure a Club House for the
women of the University. But whether
or not the Stanford Women's Club will
accept these conditions is an unknown
question.
The Women's League has been an
organization devoting its energies to
the interests of the undergraduate
women of the University. In this
work it has amply justified its exist
ence. The Stanford Women's Club
was originally a committee appointed
by the League in 1908 to act as a per
manent finance committee to raise
funds for the building of a Women's
Club House. In 1910 this committee
was incorporated into a separate or
ganization distinct from the League,
and, as such, has continued its work
most successfully to the present time.
Through its efforts the Club House has
become almost a reality instead of a
far-off possibility. If the incorpora
tion takes place the Stanford Women's
Club will probably become a com
mittee still having as its purpose the
raising of funds for the Club House.
