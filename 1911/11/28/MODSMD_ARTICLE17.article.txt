# MASQUERS TO PRESENT "ADMIRABLE CRIGHTON.‚Äù
## Miss G. Workman, '12, and R.H. Seward, '12, Will Appear in Leading Roles. 
### 
The Masquers will present .1. M.
Barrie's, "The Admirable Crighton," in
the Assembly Hall on February 8.
This play is exceptionally well adapted
to a college audience and will come
up to, or even exceed, 1909's great
success, "The Road to Yesterday."
"The Admirabe Crighton" is a very
clever four art comedy and was play
ed by William Gillett. Two of the
scenes are laid on a desert island,
which will make a very artistic and
elaborate production.
The leading roles wil be taken by
Miss G. Workman, '12, and R. H.
Seward, '12, whose ability and success
is well known to the college com
munity. All the Masquers will have
parts, namely, Miss A. Holmes, '12,
Miss F. Wendling, '12, Miss D. Parkin
son, '13, Miss N. Moise, '12, and Miss
O. McDermott, '14.
The comedy will be cast this semes
ter so that all the parts may be
learned during the vacation and the
polish can be added by Coach Mathieu
after the holidays.
