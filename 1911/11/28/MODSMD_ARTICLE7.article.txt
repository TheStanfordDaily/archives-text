fell over the line with the ball. Mil
ler, from near the sidelines, failed of
conversion. Team 1, 3; Team 4, 0.

In the following play Taylor's good
boot featured. Miller missed a drop
for goal. From his 40, Erb booted to
the Breakers' 40, and again to their
20. A chance kick led to a lineout at
5. Taylor saved, and the gun ended
a hard-fought half with the Breakers
team having a shade of advantage.
Varsity Fight Shown.
A scrum battle took the ball to
Breakers' 20 early in the second half.
At his 10, Brown marked and booted
to 30. Fighting was as hard here as
in a Varsity contest. Efforts by Am
brose and Miller changed the tide of
battle. On a pass from A. Erb near
midfield, Reeves dashed to Breakers'
20. Now the long attack began. Time
and time again the fraternity team
surged against the defenders stone
wall, only to have their efforts frus
trated by boots by Brown, Miller and
others. Once McMjllan dribbled over,
Grau saved, and Miller dropped out of
danger. Erb slid over from 5, but a
try was not allowed. Again a tackle
by Brown saved a score.
The game was not only interesting
as an usually hard-fought contest, but
was a splendid exhibition of rugby.

In a game featuring the most sensa
tional finish seen on Stanford Field
this year, Team 1, the Breakers, and
Team 4, the Sigma Alpha Epsilon-Sig
ma Nu combination battled to a 3-0
victory for the former last evening un
til early darkness put an end to the
fray. The last few minutes of play
found the fraternity combination with
in a few yards of the club goal, at
tacking with a great spirit of fight;
found the other team defending with
equal desperation, counting the sec
onds until time should be called;
found the spectators crowding on the
field and straining their eyes in the
twilight to see the battle. Once their
cheers rose louder as Erb slid over
the line for what seemed a try; but
the referee decided that the ball had
been grounded before crossing the
white mark.
Campbell Falls on Hall.
In the first half, after a hard fight
around the turf's center. Miller took
Smith's mark at 40 but failed a drop

ler, from near the sidelines, failed of
conversion. Team 1, 3; Team 4, 0.
