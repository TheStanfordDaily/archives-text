## JUNIORS NOMINATE CASS. TWO SOPHOMORES NAMED. Executive Committee Proposes an Amendment to Protect Bona-fide Student Body Members. 
### 
Twenty-five men, or approximately
one-fortieth of the male membership
of the Student Body, met today at
noon for the regular Fall nomina
tions. President K. L. Schaupp, '12,
presided.
For Sophomore representative to
the Executive Committee, two men
were nominated. The name of F. W.
Wickman was proposed by J. B. Be
man, '12, and that of P. B. McKee by
11. S. Worthington, *12. The only can
didate for Junior representative nom
inated was L. Cass by E. F. Kern, '13.
C. R. Nunan, '12, was nominated
for the office of Editor-in-Chief of the
Daily Palo Alto by J. C. Thomas, '12.
No Benefits For Non-Members.
A proposed amendment from the
hands of the Executive Committee
proposes to prevent any person not a
regular member of the Student Body
Association from receiving certain
benefits and rewards from the same.
It proposes that any person who
does not join the Associated Student
Body by registering and paying all
regular dues shall be prevented from
holding any class or association office,
from receiving any benefits or rewards
such as emblems, sweaters, or free
hospital care.
As explained by President Schaupp,
this action is only fair to the members
of the association and will protect
them from outside encroachments up
on their rights. A two-thirds vote
will be necessary to carry this amend
ment.
Further nominations for offices are
allowable through the columns of the
Daily Palo Alto up to and including
Monday evening of next week. No
more proposed amendments will be
received as the time is now past for
their submission.
The proposed amendment reads as
follows:
Article I Sec. 2.
All students of L. S. J. U. are elig
ible to membership in this Associa
tion and become such upon registra
tion and payment of all regula rdues.
Only members of this association shall
be entitled, (1), to represent Stan
ford, or shall be entitled, (2), to hold
any association or class office, or
shall be entitled, (3), to receive any
benefits or emblems given by the
association.
