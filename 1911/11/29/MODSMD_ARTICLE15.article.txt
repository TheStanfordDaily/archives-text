# A 						Place For Waste Paper.
## 
### 
We wish to call attention to a
habit on the campus that has grown
up in the past year or so, and which

can be corrected with
a little care and
thoughtfulness. It has
become the custom for

post-office patrons to leave the wrap
pings of their mail strewn along the
block or so of sidewalk leading Quad
ward, with the result that that part
of the campus is hardly in keeping
with other more tidy places. It has
been suggested that boxes for the re
ceiving of waste paper be located near
the building to remind people that
there is the place for waste paper and
not the wayside. Moreover, We Need
the Union.
