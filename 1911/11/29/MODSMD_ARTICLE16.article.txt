# FOUNDRY DEPARTMENT GIVES EXHIBITION.
## Molten Liquid Cast in Fantastic Shapes.â€”Serviceable Articles Are Forged by Class. 
### 
The entire Founday department gave
an interesting exhibition of iron cast
ing last night, in the campus foundry.
About four thousand ponds of molten
metal were pound into the molds
made by the students. Iron dumb
bells, floor plates and tables for the
forge building were among the articles
made.
A huge "give 'em the" with a six
foot iron ax of molten iron below was
the feature which delighted the large
audience which gathered to watch the
casting.
An exhibition of this nature is given
every semester, but this latest is one
of the most original productions ever
given by the department.
