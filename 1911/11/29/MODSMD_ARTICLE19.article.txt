# THIELE CUP TOURNEY WILL BEGIN TOMORROW
## NEW HOLDER OF TROPHY TO BE KNOWN SATURDAY. Arrangement of Handicaps Promises To Make the Tennis Matches Very Close Contests. 
### 
During the next few days the tennis
matches for the Thiele Cup will be
run off on the Encina courts and it
is expected that by Saturday night
the winner will be named. As the
handicaps have been very carefully
arranged, the matches promise to be
very closely contested.
H. W. Dawson, '14, the present hol
der of the Thiele cup, has not entered
the coming tournament, but R. L.
Murray, '1.°., winner of two years ago,
is enrolled among the aspirants. The
presence of a former champion will
add interest to the affair.
Owing to the limited number of en
tries, all those enrolled who are not
on the courts at their scheduled time,
will be defaulted. An entrance fee
of fifty cents is to be charged.
