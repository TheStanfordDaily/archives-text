# "GRATITUDE" IS TOPIC OF MRS. T. P. RUSSELL.

"Some Immoral Aspects of Grati
tude," was the subject of Mrs. T. P.
Russell's talk yesterday at the
Thanksgiving service of the Young
Women's Christian Association.
"Gratitude for objects which are
not free to all, but with which we are
particularly blessed, and gratitude
which is merely a passive emotion is
not expressive of the true Thanks
giving spirit. Only that dynamic gra
titude which comes after the giving
of joy to others is truly acceptable,"
said Mrs. Russell.
The special music for the after
noon was furnished by Miss C. San
ford, '15, and Miss E. Coleman, '13.
Next week's meeting is to be one of
special importance. It will be in
charge of the Social Service com
mittee, of which Miss M. Graham, *12,
is chairman, ft will be an open meet
ing for all those interested in this
work and will take the place of the
regular Y. W. C. A. services.
