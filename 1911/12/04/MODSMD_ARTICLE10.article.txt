# The
						Amendment.
## 
### 
The proposed amendment to the
Student Body constitution having
caused a certain amount of comment
and criticism, the Daily Palo Alto

took the opportunity to
secure the opinions ot
students most concerned
in the change—debaters

and athletes. A communication has
been sent to us and is printed in the
adjoining column. It is to be left to
the individual student voter to decide
upon the merits of the amendment.
The writer of the communication
published today is mistaken in one or
two minor-details, such as the fact that
that the second team man does not
receive a free ticket, and, again, that
the giving of the sweater is the big
thing for which the student body
should have financial help in the form
of dues from each student representing
Stanford.
The student body does not object
to giving a sweater with the bldck let
ter to the man who has secured his
place on the team, nor fobs to de
baters. It is the fact that hospital
bills of non-members, very often
mount up into the hundreds—for non
members who have simply taken the
football squad as a means of exercise
and pleasure.
The amendment is not aimed at any
particular man or class of men. It
is simply felt that It is not fair to the
men who have paid their assessments
to pay the bills of non-members. It
is true that the amendment will hit
the man who has worked hard for the
University and has been giving his
best effort. But to secure fairness for
all it is necessary that some few men
be sacrificed. Moreover, We Need the
Union.
