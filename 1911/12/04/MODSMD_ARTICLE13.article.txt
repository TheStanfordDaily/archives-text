To the Editor of the Daily Palo Alto:
In regard to the proposed amend
ment to Art. I, Sec. 2, of the constitu
tion, I apply to you for discussion and
information through the columns of
the Daily. This is an amendment that
should receive the most careful atten
tion of everyone concerned, not on
account of any loss or miserly gain,
financially, but on account of the dis
gust which it will produce among
those who stop and consider the
amendment from every standpoint.
First let us see whom the proposi
tion affects. Primarily, it is directed
at the athlete, and secondarily at
those in debating and dramatics. If
the amendment applied to everybody
in the student body then there could
be no objection, but, as it does not
affect the worst class in the Univer
sity at all, the student who loafs
around and never helps with any ac
tivity that comes up and then refuses
to pay his dues, it must be classed
as the worst kind of discrimination.
Why this discrimination against the
most energetic group of men we have?
If a man spends every afternoon 011
the turf for months and then fights
for his Alma Mater as hard as he can
in the intercollegiate, does he still
owe the Student Ilody the sum of one
dollar 011 the gift that it has decided
to bestow on him for his services.
What are his services worth? Can
you judge them from the returns of
the game? Surely not, those are due
entirely to the business manager or
someone else, anybody, just as long
as it is not the athlete. Can you
judge them by what he receives? Yes.
That's it. A man always gets what
he's worth. There's that sweater and
then all the glory, you know; the re
turns of the game are all consumed,
and the two dollars that each man paid
just makes up the deficit.
Then there is that fellow who was
never on the turf or any other place
where there is anything to do to keep
things going. He still has two dollars
in his pocket and 110 magnet to draw
it out either; that means a free ticket
to the game, doesn't it? Does the sec
ond team man, who worked hard all
season, get a free ticket when he finds
he didn't make the team?
Then again, who is to vote on this
matter? Is it' the man who has not
paid up? No. Maybe he has a good
reason, has he got the right to voice
it?
What are the conclusions to be
drawn? Primarily, that athletics are
not on a paying basis and, in order to
keep up expenses the athlete, the de
bater, etc., must be assessed and com
pelled to pay up. What can be said
in regard to this? Simply that some
one has made a very poor attempt at
forming an amendment, or that we
need a new management. Moreover,
We Need the Union.
