# MILLER'S KICK BRINGS VICTORY TO OLYMPICS.
## Many Wearers of the Cardinal Play With Clubmen in Their Annual Struggle. 
### 
J. O. Miller, '08, won the yearly
match between the Olympic and Bar
barian Clubs, in San Francisco, on

Saturday afternoon
by dropping a field
goal from play,
making it a 4-0 vic
tory. The game
was a sturdily con
tested one from the
first whistle which
ifreed the ball to
the play until the
crack of the gun
closed the match.
The first half pass
ed without a score
and th e game pro
mised to close with
a tie. Soon after
the opening of the
second period a
momentary open
ing in the oppos
ing side gave the
Cardinal roamer
his long looked for

opportunity . He sent the ball whirl
ing between the white uprights and
the Olympics had scored the only
points of the afternoon.
Peters figured in a cleverly inter
cepted pass, and in a long run down
the field almost added another brace
of points to the Winged "O" side of
the score board.

Cardinal were included in the Olympic
line up. They were: C. Decius, '13,
.J. Peters, Ml, A. Erb, '15, J. O. Miller,
