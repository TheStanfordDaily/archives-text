# REPRESENTATIVE MEN EXPRESS OPINIONS
## ATHLETES AND DEBATERS DISCUSS AMENDMENTS. Change in Student Body Constitution Brings Varied Ideas as to its Merits. 
### 
Below are printed opinions express
ed by representative debaters and ath
letes in regard to the proposed
amendment to the student body consti
tution, Article I, Section 2. This pro
vides that a student who is not
a member of the Associated Students
shall not represent Stanford and
shall not hold any association or class
office, or shall be entitled to receive
any benefits or emblems given by the
Association. Benefits include the pay
ing of hospital dues of students who
are hurt while competing on Stanford
teams, etc.
"I think that the amendment is all
right—that if any man belongs to the
Student Body, and is going to get
benefits from it that he ought to pay
up his dues."—F. 11. Hilton, '11, inter
collegiate and Carnot debater.
"I am strongly in favor of the pro
posed amendment. Th e constitution
of the Student Body calls for certain
dues which are necessary for the run
ning expenses. A person who does
not pay these dues is not a member
of the Student Body and so I can not
see why he should receive the benefits
and gifts offered the members. It is
only fair to th e members of the Stu
dent Body that they be protected by
this amendment." —K. L. Sehaupp, '12,
Varsity football player and ex-crew
captain.
"The proposed amendment is a fair
and just one. I think it only right to
the real members of the Student Body
that this amendment carries. A per
son who does not pay his dues is re
fused the right to vote and also should
be refused other privileges and favors
granted Student Body members.**—
K. L. Dole, Ml, ex-football captain.
Varsity crew and track man.
"The amendment is poorly worded
and open to criticism on that account.
It should be remembered that the free
hospital care offered participants hurt
in athletics is distinct and separate
from the care entitled a person upon
payment of his guild fee. As it is
generally understood, I favor the
amendment."—.l. E. Nliclton, inter
colleiriute debater and track man.
"T see no reason why this amend
ment is not a good thing. At other
universities the same method has been
tried and proved successful."—€. 112.
Taylor. '11. Varsity track man.
"If taken as it is generally under
tood, I believe in the proposed amend
ment. Just what the words "benefit"
and "represent" cover and mean is
not clearly defined in the wording of
the article."—\\. E. Simpson, inlercol
lecriate debater.
"The amendment taken as a whole.
I favor, but the clause referring to
benefits, such as hospital care, I be
lieve is wrong. Everyone paying his
guild fee I consider entitled to this
care, no matter whether he has paid
his Student Body dues or not." —J. 0.

not clearly defined in the wording of
the article."—\\. E. Simpson, inlercol
lecriate debater.
"The amendment taken as a whole.
I favor, but the clause referring to
benefits, such as hospital care, I be
lieve is wrong. Everyone paying his
guild fee I consider entitled to this
care, no matter whether he has paid
his Student Body dues or not." —J. 0.

Below are printed opinions express
ed by representative debaters and ath
letes in regard to the proposed
amendment to the student body consti
tution, Article I, Section 2. This pro
vides that a student who is not
a member of the Associated Students
shall not represent Stanford and
shall not hold any association or class
office, or shall be entitled to receive
any benefits or emblems given by the
Association. Benefits include the pay
ing of hospital dues of students who
are hurt while competing on Stanford
teams, etc.
"I think that the amendment is all
right—that if any man belongs to the
Student Body, and is going to get
benefits from it that he ought to pay
up his dues."—F. 11. Hilton, '11, inter
collegiate and Carnot debater.
"I am strongly in favor of the pro
posed amendment. Th e constitution
of the Student Body calls for certain
dues which are necessary for the run
ning expenses. A person who does
not pay these dues is not a member
of the Student Body and so I can not
see why he should receive the benefits
and gifts offered the members. It is
only fair to th e members of the Stu
dent Body that they be protected by
this amendment." —K. L. Sehaupp, '12,
Varsity football player and ex-crew
captain.
"The proposed amendment is a fair
and just one. I think it only right to
the real members of the Student Body
that this amendment carries. A per
son who does not pay his dues is re
fused the right to vote and also should
be refused other privileges and favors
granted Student Body members.**—
K. L. Dole, Ml, ex-football captain.
Varsity crew and track man.
"The amendment is poorly worded
and open to criticism on that account.
It should be remembered that the free
hospital care offered participants hurt
in athletics is distinct and separate
from the care entitled a person upon
payment of his guild fee. As it is
generally understood, I favor the
amendment."—.l. E. Nliclton, inter
colleiriute debater and track man.
"T see no reason why this amend
ment is not a good thing. At other
universities the same method has been
tried and proved successful."—€. 112.
Taylor. '11. Varsity track man.
"If taken as it is generally under
tood, I believe in the proposed amend
ment. Just what the words "benefit"
and "represent" cover and mean is
not clearly defined in the wording of
the article."—\\. E. Simpson, inlercol
lecriate debater.
"The amendment taken as a whole.
I favor, but the clause referring to
benefits, such as hospital care, I be
lieve is wrong. Everyone paying his
guild fee I consider entitled to this
care, no matter whether he has paid
his Student Body dues or not." —J. 0.
