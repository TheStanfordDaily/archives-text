# MEMORIAL ORGAN WILL BE HEARD NEXT SUNDAY
## PIPES HAVE BEEN SILENT SINCE EASTER, 1906. Special Christmas Service Arranged By Dr. Garner.-Dr. Blodgett Will Give Recital. 
### 
For the first time since Easter Sun
day, April 10, 1906, the majestic tones
of the great Memorial Church organ
will peal forth in impressive cere
mony next Sunday afternoon in a spec
ial Christmas service in Assembly
hall. The chaplain has arranged for
the service to begin promptly at 3:30
o'clock. There will be no morning
chapel.
The occasion will be memorable for
two reasons. The church organ, si
lenced by the earthquake, will again
speak, and, remembering all the sen
timent attaching to the organ, G,
Buehrer, the university organist, has
very generously invited Dr. B. C. Blod
gett to give a recital in connection with
the service.
In order to preserve the unity of the
service, Dr. Gardner requests the
members of the university and friends
In the community to be in their seats
before 3:30 o'clock. Dr. Blodgett will
begin the Vorspiel to "Lohengrin"
promptly at that time.
