# The 						New Order.

### 
Who wishes more proof than this
of the new order of things at Stan
ford? Not long ago, after it had been
agreed between students and faculty
that hazing would be stopped, and,

after a penalty of suspen
sion for the offense had
been published, two under
classmen in Palo Alto were

found to have been guilty of hazing by
no means mild. After sifting matters
thoroughly and investigating every de
tail, the Students Affairs Committee
decided to let the matter drop as an
isolated case.

More recently, the Musical Clubs,
after repeated warnings that it was
necessary and right that they should
secure the permission of the Univer
sity authorities before giving concerts
off the campus in the name of Stan
ford. several times neglected to do
this, although after each case the offi
cers of the clubs were warned against
a repetition of the occurrence. The
men did not wilfully refuse to get per
mission. It was simply carelessness
and thoughtlessness, with a lack of an
understood bead of the clubs who
should arrange for off-campus con
certs and the permission to make
them. The Committee recognized that
the offense was not intentional, and
took two weeks to decide fully upon
whom the blame should rest.

At the end of that time, yesterday,
the Committee asked the Advisory
Hoard of the Students Conference, a
group of five men selected by the un
dergraduates to co-operate with the
faculty, to attend their meeting at
which time final action on the Clubs
would be taken, in order that there
might be co-operation which has l>een
so much desired and which has boon
so evident this year.

In both of the above cases the Con-,
mitte decided to take no action, al

though in each case there was surely
some chance for a penalty. Several
individual students, of an ordinary
state of mind, when asked what should
have been the punishment in the case
of the hazing, since the men had been
duly warned, replied: "Fire 'em." In
the case of the Musical Clubs it was
admitted that the officers has been
careless and foolish to have permitted
several repetitions of the same thing.

The Daily Palo Alto believes in
printing these facts whenever it can
secure them, and in letting the under
graduates know what is going on. The
truth is hard to find and the students
ought to know it, if possible. The
students should appreciate (he action
of the Committee. They should appre
ciate that matters are not going so
arbitrarily as they may have gone in
the past. We think they will appre
ciate it. Moreover, We Need the
Union.
