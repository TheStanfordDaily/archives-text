Editor, Daily Palo Alto:
The writer of last night's communi
cation asks why there should be "dis
crimination against the most energetic
group of men we have." Tn this he
is mistaken, for the amendment is
I not meant for any "group" of men,
but for all. But since we cannot
reach all we should reach those that
we can or else change our constitu
tion to that 110 fee shall be levied.
Our constitution demands a certain
fee which shall make a man a member
of the Association. If that fee is not
paid he cannot be a member and not
being a member he cannot expect
to derive any of the benefits that are
extended by those who have paid.
The man who "fights for bis alma
mater" gets more out ot' the fight than
the Student Body can ever give him.
We are not trying to pay a man "what
bis services are worth." We want to
get away from just such a state of
affairs, because it is a bad thing for
a man to go into a competition for the
sweater or medal that might be given
him. We want men who love the
game, who have the idea that it is
the competition and not the reward
that counts.
The money that has been saved for
the Student Body in the last three
years by a good, sound management
has gone to pay off debts, to build now
fields and to make permanent im
provements, which are surely better
investments than rewards for college
heroes.
Athletics do pay financially, as well
as otherwise. But they will never
pay a college athlete "what he is
worth." In one sense payment is im
possible and in another it is undesire
able.
In order to be allowed the privilege
to compete for bis college, the athlete,
the debater and chess player all
should first show that they are worthy
representatives, by being first of all
worthy upholders of their constitution.
