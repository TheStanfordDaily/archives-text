### 
The three act opera "The Girl and
the Voice," was selected by the Junior
Opera Committee last night at the
manuscript tryout held before the
committee and coach Fred Carlyle of
San Francisco. The book is the work
of P. Eliel, '13, and the music is com
posed by W. S. Wilson, '13, and E. E.
Chase, ex-'ll. March 28 was selected
as the date of the performance, thus
setting the Junior Week festivities for
March 28-30.
The Junior Opera Committee, which
will be responsible for the production,
is composed of the following mem
bers: J. H. Forbes, chairman, C. S.
Turpin, C. T. Keefer, R. W. Wilcox,
R. McNeely, A. W. Ambrose, S. Brown,
the Misses M. Emmons, F. Ober, L.
Raker, E. Coleman, H. Volkmor, and
H. Montague.
Cast Will Be Large.
The large number of singing and
speaking parts will afford an oppor
tunity for a large cast. In all there
are about twenty-live roles and two
choruses. The plot is decidely clever
and the music novel and snappy. The
motive which runs through the piece,
sung by the 'girl with the voice' is
especially attractive and will undoubt
edly become a popularized melody be
fore March 28.
The plot is concerned with the in
fatuation of the Varsity baseball cap
tain for the voice of a girl whom he
has not seen, Virginia Stetson, an
Eastern society girl, who has been
singing with the Metropolitan Opera
Company, has become tired of the
stage, and has avoided her contract
by dropping out of sight. She enters
Stanford as a Christmas freshman,
and gossip soon starts about the
beautiful voice of the unknown singer.
The baseball captain spends most of
his time looking for the owner of the
voice.
The Three Acts.
The first scene is laid upon the
Post Office steps on the day of the
baseball game and the crew races.
The second act is at Pacific Grove
during the summer session where the
hero plays summer baseball and the
heroine gathers sea cucumbers for
the summer biology course. Fourth
of July at Salinas furnishes the third
act setting, when a team of ex-St.au
ford men plays the Salinas team. The
play is full of decidely clever situa
tions and a large number of catchy
songs.
