# QUAD ASSESSMENTS MUST BE PAID BY NEXT FRIDAY.
## 
### 
All Juniors who have not paid their
Quad assessment will be allowed until
Friday, December 8, to pay the fee.
November 30 was originally set as the
date when all the dues had to be in,
but as this day came during the
Thanksgiving vacation Manager Guth
rie has consented to extend the time
one week so as to give those who were
off the campus during the recess a
chance to get their picture in the
annual.
Positively no assessment will be
received after next Friday, for nearly
every member of the class has paid
the $5.00 and the editing of the book
would be greatly delayed if the forms
are held open for the few tardy ones.
Those who have paid their assess
ment, and have not had their pictures
taken yet are urged to attend to this
immediately. Davey is the official
photographer and appointments may
be made with him any time between
now and the end of the semester.
