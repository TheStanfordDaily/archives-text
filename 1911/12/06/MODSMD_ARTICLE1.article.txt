### 
Tomorrow the Christmas number of
the Sequoia will mark the final
appearance of the magazine for the
semester. This issue of the campus
periodical contains many very read
able contributions on varied topics.
The first article is by Professor H.
Fairclougli, of the Latin department,
who was acting director of the Ameri
can School of Classical Studies in
Home last year. It is entitled a
"Sojourn in Rome," and in it the
writer has given his views on the arts,
music, politics, and conditions of the
Eternal City.
C. B. Hammond, '13, is the author of
an essay relating to the development
of the University, under the title of
"The Protest of Anarchy." C. C.
Ingelow, '13, writes of the "Golden
Age of Music" at Stanford. The musi
cal condition is discussed and the ad
vancement in the art at Stanford is
dwelt upon. Another exciting event,
an aftermath of the axe escapade, is
told under the head of "The Cardinal's
Retaliation," by E. C. Behrens, '14.
The fiction department of the De
cember number contains stories by
Miss O. McDermott, '13, and B. O.
Bliven, '11. The former writes a
charming, naive story, "Man's Estate."
"The Son of His Father" is the con
tribution of Bliven. It is a tale of
Western life and is considered to be
a stronger story than "Her Sister in
College" written by the same author
and published in the Sequoia last sem
ester.
The verse includes poems by Miss
M. Driscoll, '12, F. E. Hill, '11, and
M. T. Dooling, '11. Miss Driscoll is
the writer of a Celtic song. The lat
ter two contribute poems under the
captions of "Russian People" and "A
Pot of Flowers."
The features of the Hatter and the
Hare section are anomynous articles
on "Debating" and "A Suggestion."
The editorials deal with post season
rugby, popularity, and the point sys
tem. dress suits and Six Stanford
Women! Editor Robinson agrees with
his contemporary "Chappie," on the
subject of wearing dress suits to shows
and takes occasion to condemn the
women on the question of dress.
