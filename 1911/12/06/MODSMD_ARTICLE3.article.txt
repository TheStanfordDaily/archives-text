### 
Cyril R. Nuunii,
'12, of Stockton,
who was this af
ternoon elected
Editor-in-chief of
the Daily Palo

Alto, has heen a hard worker
on the college paper since his
freshman year. The past sem
ester he has been serving in
the position of Managing Edi
tor and in the past three years
tins done his work well and
willingly. Nuiiaii is a major
in the History department, and
is enrolled i i the Press Club,
Phi Delta Phi, iiud the Phi Del
ta Theta fraternity.

Balloting in today's election, which
was surprisingly heavy in spite of the
inclemency of the weather, resulted
in the election of L. Cass, '13, and P.
P. Harrigan, '14, to the Executive
Committee, C. R. Nunan, '12, to the
editorship of the Daily Palo Alto, and
the passage of the amendment to the
constitution by an overwhelming ma
jority. Approximately one-third of
the total number of eligible students
voted during the three hours that the
polls were open. The total number
of those who cast their ballots was
273.
Numerous ballots had to be thrown
out owing to mistakes or uncertainty
of intention in marking. Approximate
ly six per cent of the voters turned
in slips that had to be rejected for
one of these reasons.
The vote on the amendment to the
constitution making it necessary for
all persons engaged in student acti
vities to be members of the Student
Body was a distinct surprise. It was
thought by many that it might be diffi
cult to secure the necessary two-thirds
majority to add the amendment to the
constitution. But when the final tal
lies were made it was found that the
amendment had passed by a vote of
over ten to one. The exact figures
were 229 for the clause to 22 against.
L. Cass, who was elected to fill the
vacancy in the Executive Committee
caused by the closing of the term of
the present Junior representative, won
his Varsity letter in two branches of
sport. Cass played on the 1909 Var
sity football team as scrum half, lie
was the regular second baseman for
the 1910 baseball aggregation and was
picked to play scrum half on this
yeir's football team. He is the foot
ball captain-elect for 1912. He also
played wing on his Freshman team.
Cass registers in the Geology depart
ment from Los Angeles. He is a mem
ber of Zeta Psi.
P. F. Harrigan. the newly elected
representative of 1914 on th r> Executive
Committee h also a football man. He
defeated F. W. Wickman 162 to S(?

Harrigan played first fiive on the 1914
Freshman team, and was picked to
fill the same berth on the 1910 Var
sity. At the opening of the football
reason this year he was again placed
at his old position and held it during
the entire season including the final
intercollegiate contest. Harrigan is
registered in the Department of Elec
trical Engineering from Los Angeles.
He is enrolled in Beta Theta PI.
