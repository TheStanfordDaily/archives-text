# NOTABLE PEACE ADVOCATE GIVES FORCEFUL ADDRESS
## Hamilton Holt Arraigns International Warfare in an Interesting Talk Before Student Assembly This Morning. 
### 
"The Federation of the World" as
his subject, Hamilton Holt, managing
editor of the Independent magazjine
and a leader in the peace movement,
today arraigned international warfare
in a decisive manner before the as
sembled students in Assembly Hall.
Mr. Holt presented the peace move
ment as one of the four great social
political problems of the age, and
described in detail the master struggle
of the leaders in the war against war.
"These four great problems, all of
which I believe will be solved in the
lifetime of members of this audience,
are, the Economic problem of the
proper distribution of wealth, includ
ing capitalism and socialism; the Wo
man problem, a puzzle largely of
liberty, equality and sorority; the
Race problem, which implies the sub
stitution of hopefulness for hateful
ness; and, lastly, International Peace,"
declared Mr. Holt.
"Today war is the only legal, com
mon and final method of settling dis
putes between nations. The purpose
of the peace movement is to provide
a new solution, and until this solution
is provided combat between nations
is inevitable.
Is War Romance?
"The late Professor James of Har
vard attempted to prove in an essay
'War is the Romance of History.'

Most women prefer brass buttons to
sold shirt studs. I found that out
when as an underclassman in Yale I
went to a dance with a West Point
man.
"All healthy men like to fight and all
healthy women like to see them tight.
Who is not more stirred by the war
veterans marching through the streets
than a parade of the Amalgamated
Order of Hod Carriers?"
"But there is just as strong evidence
on the other side," continued Mr. Holt.
"Martin Luther said that 'Guns were
a direct invention of the devil.' And
Napoleon, who was so great a general
that nobody thought of calling him
'Hell-Roaring Jake' of 'Fighting Bob,'
declared that he was 'becoming more
and more convinced of the inability
of war to do anything that would
last.' "
"In any popular appeal to the emo
tions, however, you will find as many
people shouting the 'Army and Navy
Forever' as you will 'Peace, Perfect
Peace.' Personally, 1 believe that a
man who can look at a Decoration
Day parade without feeling something
stir in him is either a fool or a molly
coddle.
31 ii st Develop Interimtioi al Law.
"It is in the substitution of law for
war that the solution of the problem
lies," declared Mr. Holt. "At present
there is no code of international law
binding nations, only a bunch of
maxims, precedents and opinions,
which the nations reject as they please
or as the force of public opinion
directs.
"Government is only a great big
peace society, that arranges that the
fast and slow, rich and poor, may
have justice. It operates so that the
masses won't exploit the classes in the
future or that the classes won't ex
ploit the masses, as some say they are
doing now.
"Now, why should nations settle
differences in a manner for which they
put their own subjects to death for
imitating? There are forty-six civil
ized sovereign nations, and with the
exception of Turkey, Italy and China,
all are at peace. Yet the only way
the rest of the forty-six have to secure
their lights is by force. History has
been called the decline of war. Un
doubtedly it is the story of the growth
of law, and with this spread of the
power of justice, war will ultimately
cease.
Democracy and Peace.
"Emmanuel Kant once declared that
'we never will have universal peace
until the world is politically organized
and not until all nations have repre
sentative and popular government.'
The world nations, practically all of
them, have representative govern
allment, but we have yet to organize
politically. James Bryce, ambassador
of England, admitted that "All nations
of the world today, some slowly, some
faster, are coming to adopt the Ameri
can plan of government.'
"We all know that United States
government is founded on sacrifice,
that part of the sovereigns have to
when the general exigency demands it.
"The world is smaller today in 1911
than were the 13 colonies in 177G.
This is because of the inventions that
have annihilated space and time and
brought the nations of the civilized
commonwealth closer together, such as
steam and electricty.
"Look what the wireless telephone
is doing! ido not doubt that some of
your professors will tell you that some
day, if you turn your ears back, you
can hear yourselves talking around
the world.
Supreme Court of the World.
"The United Nations of the World
does now exist in the Hague court,
the supreme court of the world. Let
us now look at how this court was
established:
"The czar of Russia called the first
Hague conference but it was largely
due to Frederick W. Holls, a little
known hero, that we have it today.
The proposition of universal disarma
ment made by the czar was premature.
Mr. Holls was one of the United State3
delegation to the conference.
"The United States proposed the
Hague court scheme, first to England.
Later, France and Russia came in.
13ut when Mr. Holz went to Prince
Von Ruelow, of Germany, the prince
did not fall in with it. Von Ruelow
promised, however, that if England
agreed, Germany would not oppose.
Rut Germany did oppose it afterwards.
"Mr. Holz again went to Prince
Von Buelow for an explanation, the
prince pulled a manuscript from a
drawer, on which was written in the
strong, clear-cut writing of the Kaiser,
the short and ugly word 'Nein.' The
United States representatives told Ger
many that they would consider it an
unfriendly act if the reason for their
opposition were not given on the floor
of the Hague Convention. So when
Von Buelow threatened to resign, the
Kaiser gave in.
The World Union.
"This was the first attempt to or
ganize the world politically. What are
some things it accomplished? In
the first place, the principle laid down
kept England, Italy and Germany from
a war over Venezuela. Again, it was
the mens of peacefully settling the
North Sea di'flculty between England
and Russia, and finally the influence
of the Hague court brought recogni
tion of the principle that enabled Pre

sident Roosevelt to step in and ter
minate the Russo-Japanese war, even
after war had begun.
"The Peace movement is spreading
rapidly over the civilized world. Every
nation has its multitude of peace so
cieties. An international peace con
gress meets every year in some na
tion's capital, and in America we have
semi-annual meetings of a peace con
gress. Even the colleges have taken
up the problem in earnest and there
is a peace congress among the Middle
West universities.
"I would like to tell you of the
statue of the Christ which stands on
the summit of the Andes telling the
whole world that the warfare between
Argentina and Chile is forever ended.
Problem Not Yet Solved.
"But the problem is not yet solved
by a long way. There are yet four
supreme court of the world effective.
"They are, first, a supreme court
like that of the United States to be
completed before the next peace con
gress at the Hague. This court will
not interfere with the present Hague
court.
"Second, the step from voluntary to
compulsory arbitration.
"Third, further steps to reduce the
possibility of war between the Eastern
and Western hemispheres.
"Finally, an arrangement to make
the Hague conferences self-perpetu
ating.
"We now have the machinery to pre
vent war, if the nations will permit it
to be employed. This calls for a treaty
bringing them together.
"I believe that it is the destiny of
the United States to lead in this world
1 movement. The United States has ar
bitrated more disputes than any other
country.
Army of Peace.
"Everywhere leaders are flocking to
the call for Peace. Joseph Ginn found
ed the Peace Society,of which President
Jordan is an official, with a million
dollars, and Andrew Carnegie has
since made a greater donation to the
cause.
"We must make war on war. in
stead of a declaration of independence,
it will be a declaration of interde
pendence. Then there will be 'Peace
on Earth, Good Will Toward Men," de
clared Mr. Holt in conclusion.
Mr. Holt was decorated by the Mi
kado on his visit to Japan in 1909
with the Order of the Sacred Trea
sure for his efforts in the cause of
world wide peace.
