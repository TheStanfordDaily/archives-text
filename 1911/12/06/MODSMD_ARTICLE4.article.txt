# NOTABLE PEACE ADVOCATE GIVES FORCEFUL ADDRESS
## Hamilton Holt Arraigns International Warfare in an Interesting Talk Before Student Assembly This Morning. 
### 
"The Federation of the World" as
his subject, Hamilton Holt, managing
editor of the Independent magazjine
and a leader in the peace movement,
today arraigned international warfare
in a decisive manner before the as
sembled students in Assembly Hall.
Mr. Holt presented the peace move
ment as one of the four great social
political problems of the age, and
described in detail the master struggle
of the leaders in the war against war.
"These four great problems, all of
which I believe will be solved in the
lifetime of members of this audience,
are, the Economic problem of the
proper distribution of wealth, includ
ing capitalism and socialism; the Wo
man problem, a puzzle largely of
liberty, equality and sorority; the
Race problem, which implies the sub
stitution of hopefulness for hateful
ness; and, lastly, International Peace,"
declared Mr. Holt.
"Today war is the only legal, com
mon and final method of settling dis
putes between nations. The purpose
of the peace movement is to provide
a new solution, and until this solution
is provided combat between nations
is inevitable.
Is War Romance?
"The late Professor James of Har
vard attempted to prove in an essay
'War is the Romance of History.'

Most women prefer brass buttons to
sold shirt studs. I found that out
when as an underclassman in Yale I
went to a dance with a West Point
man.
"All healthy men like to fight and all
healthy women like to see them tight.
Who is not more stirred by the war
veterans marching through the streets
than a parade of the Amalgamated
Order of Hod Carriers?"
"But there is just as strong evidence
on the other side," continued Mr. Holt.
"Martin Luther said that 'Guns were
a direct invention of the devil.' And
Napoleon, who was so great a general
that nobody thought of calling him
'Hell-Roaring Jake' of 'Fighting Bob,'
declared that he was 'becoming more
and more convinced of the inability
of war to do anything that would
last.' "
"In any popular appeal to the emo
tions, however, you will find as many
people shouting the 'Army and Navy
Forever' as you will 'Peace, Perfect
Peace.' Personally, 1 believe that a
man who can look at a Decoration
Day parade without feeling something
stir in him is either a fool or a molly
coddle.
31 ii st Develop Interimtioi al Law.
"It is in the substitution of law for
war that the solution of the problem
lies," declared Mr. Holt. "At present
there is no code of international law
binding nations, only a bunch of
maxims, precedents and opinions,
which the nations reject as they please
or as the force of public opinion
directs.
"Government is only a great big
peace society, that arranges that the
fast and slow, rich and poor, may
have justice. It operates so that the
masses won't exploit the classes in the
future or that the classes won't ex
ploit the masses, as some say they are
doing now.
"Now, why should nations settle
differences in a manner for which they
put their own subjects to death for
imitating? There are forty-six civil
ized sovereign nations, and with the
exception of Turkey, Italy and China,
all are at peace. Yet the only way
the rest of the forty-six have to secure
