# A 						Bad Tendency.
## 
### 
It has been found necessary by the
Executive Committee of the students
to make a protest against the appear
ance recently of bad sportsmanship in

the post-season rugby
series â€” "undue rough
ness" being apparent to
not a few undergraduates

and faculty members. It is too bad
that this sort of thing should have
occurred, but it is by no means im
possible to remedy. If it were not
possible to do away with it, then we
would be the first to say that athletics
were having an evil tendency, and
should be radically changed. But we
believe that it is merely a matter of
laxness on the part of the referee ap
pointed for the games, and, also, let
it be noted, a lack of spirit on the part
of the students to back up his deci
sions. Referees should be chosen with
greater care, ami the student specta
tors should not hesitate to voice their
protess at any out and out violation of
the rules. Moreover, We Need the
Union.
