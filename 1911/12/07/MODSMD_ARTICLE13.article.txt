# Junior Opera Authors to Get Medals.
## 
### 
Gold medals will be given to the
composers of the Junior Opera this
year, instead of the customary $50.
This change was decided upon by the
1913 class this afternoon. The former
sum that was given for the produc
tion never compensated for the work
put in, and, furthermore, it was con
sidered impossible to ever pay a really
sufficient pecuniary amount for the
opera. On the other hand it was
thought that the awarding of medals
would be a significant reward and one
that could he kept permanently. The
authors of "The Girl and the Voice,"
who will receive medals, are E. E.
Chase, ex-'il, P. Eliel, '13, and W. S.
Wilson, '13.
