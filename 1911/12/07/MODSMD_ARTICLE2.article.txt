# INTERSCHOLASTIC MEET GETS PERMANENT DATE.
## Second Saturday in April Set as Regular Time for Holding Annual Affair. 
### 
The second Saturday in April has
been set by the Interscholastic Board
of Governors as a permanent date for
the annual interscholastic track meet.
This motion was passed at a meeting
of the board held yesterday, when it
was decided that a regular yearly
date would lie advantageous for the
visiting athletes in planning their
trips, and would also assist the local
managers in arranging for the affair.
Every effort is being made this year
to make the meet the most successful
on record. Last spring one hundred
and seventy five athletes, representing
thirty-six schools participated. This
year more invitations are to be sent
out to try and increase the large total
of last year.
The meets held so far have been
v'ery successful in bringing out high
school athletes who have never been
heard of before. Last year Kelly of
Orange, sprung a surprise by being
the highest individual scorer, winning
out over men who were conceded easy
victories. Los Angeles High School is
the present holder of the cup given to
the winner of the meet. A team of six
men from the Angel City succeeded
in totaling the largest number of
points last spring.
