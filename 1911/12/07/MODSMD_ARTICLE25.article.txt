# Chemists' Society Has Informal Feed.
## 
### 
A noon-day feed was held yester
day in the Chemestry Building by
the members of Mini Kaph Mini, at
which a large number were present.
The custom of holding feeds at the
building is observed every once in a
while by the Chemistry honor society
and the affair yesterday was highly
successful and enjoyable. Everything
was of an informal nature. During
the hcur, talks were given by R. C.
Pollock, gr., and L. H. Jones, '12.
