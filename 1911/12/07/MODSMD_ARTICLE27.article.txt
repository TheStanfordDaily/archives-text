# WELL KNOWN CHARACTER MUST LEAVE STANFORD.
## Spike, the Snoring Dog, Falls Under the Ban for Delinquent Scholarship. 
### 
Although no official notice of the
affair has been posted where it came
under the eye of the observant stu
dent, another ardent Stanfordite has
fallen under the ban and has been re
quested to leave these classic halls.
Spike, the prognathic jawed bull,
whose presence on the Campus has
given rise to many a canine struggle
of dire consequences, and whose deep
and full-toned snore has broken into
the quiet of many a serious lecture,
has been requested to leave. It
seems that Spike was carrying more
hours than he was allowed to take. In
fact, he failed to properly discriminate,
and visited classes in one day in al
most every department of the Univer
sity. It is estimated that he carried
a least fifty hours.
Now no longer will his classic
snore disturb the peaceful quiet of
the classroom, nor his bloody fights
make business for the veterinaries.
Spike has been asked to leave. He is
too much of a disturbing element.
Today sees his last official appear
ance as a member of the Student Body
