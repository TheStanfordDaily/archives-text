# "CHRISTOPHER, JR.," CAST WILL BE SELECTED SOON.
## Sophomores Show Decided Lack of Interest in Tryouts.-Manuscripts Have Arrived. 
### 
Tryouts for places in the cast of
"Christopher, .1r.," will be held Mon
day and Tuesday afternoon in room
68. The manuscript containing the
lines to be interpreted by each person
trying out has arrived. The women
of the class may obtain their parts
from Miss A. Boone, the men from
L. W. Lewis.
A lack of interest anil a general
apathy on the part of the Sophomores
has been evidenced thus far and but a
relatively small number have signi
fied their intention to contest for
places. The Play Committee wish to
urge every member of the 1914 class
to secure copies of the parts and to
enter the competition. In previous
years the number who have taken
part in the tryouts has been large
and the present situation is unexpect
ed.
