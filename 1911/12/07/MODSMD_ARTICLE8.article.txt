# CARDINAL TO CLASH IN RUGBY WITH VANCOUVER
## FOOTBALL SQUAD WILL AGAIN TAKE NORTHERN TRIP. Twenty Men Will Leave December 21 to Play Three Games in Northern City. 
### 
International rugby, with the scene
now shifted to far-away British Co
lumbia, will again hold the attention
of the sporting world during the
Christmas holidays. At last evening's
meeting of the Executive Committee it
was voted to accept the invitaion ex
tended to the Stanford Varsity by the
rugby interests of Vancouver to play
three games in that city during
Christmas week. The invitation was
contained in a communication recently
received from the Canadian rugby en
thusiasts.
While no definite dates for the
games have been decided upon, it is
probable that they will be played on
Christmas Day, on December 28, aud
on New Year's Day. The present
plan is for the Stanford team to leava
on Thursday, December 21, the day
after the completion of final examina
tions. The return journey will be
commenced Tuesday, January 2.
The team which will make the
northern trip has not as yet been
picked, and no guess as to its per
sonnel can be hazarded by the author
ities. It is probable, however, that
the party bound for the land of snow
wil include about twenty men. Neith
er Coach Presley of Trainer "Dad"
Moulton will accompany the squad,
which will be in charge of Graduate
Manager 1). W. Burbank, '09.
Some excellent rugby should be the
result of the trip. The results of past
contests indicate a decisive Cardinal
victory. Last year on the northern
trip Stanford won two out of the three
games played with Vancouver, the
scores being fi-13, 10-3, and!)-0.
The whole stay in the Canadian
city will also heyond doubt be a
round of pleasure for the Stanford
men. Last year, from the time of its
arrival until the "Princess Victoria"
steamed southward again, the Car
dinal party was royally entertained
l>y its hosts. A Grand Hall on New
Year's eve and numerous minor en
tertainments in their honor were ten
dered the Stanford athletes.
