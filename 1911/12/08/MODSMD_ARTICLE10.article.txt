# The 						Game Tomorrow.
## 
### 
Tomorrow's game of rugby on Stan
ford Field between two well-matched
teams will perhaps make an end of

student activities for
this semester. It will be
the last chance to en
gage in campus diver

sions before the final examinations.
There will be a good referee for the
contest, Coach Presley having con
sented to enforce the rules, and spec
tators are therefore assured of a game
without the objectionable features of
one or two recent contests. A small
admission is to be charged, with the
receipts of the day to go to the Stan
ford Union Fund. There will be, then,
another chance for the undergraduates
to aid in raising money, and in help
ing the Union collections this semes
ter to reach the two thousand mark.
Moreover, We Need the Union.
