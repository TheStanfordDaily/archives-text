Editor, Daily Palo Alto:
It is announced that there is to be
a sermon preached in the course of
Dr. Blodgett's organ recital Sunday
afternoon. His former connection
with the organ made it generally un
derstood on the campus that the re
cital was chiefly in honor of Dr. Blod
gett, and many will doubtless be dis
appointed because he and the organ
are made subordinate. Since there
will probably be plenty of opportu
nities to hear able sermons and few
opportunities to hear recitals of such
interest, would it not be well to give
Dr. Blodgett and the organ more room
on the program?
Respectfully yours,
MUSISITS.
