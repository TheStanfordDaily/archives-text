# Socialist Club of Stanford Formed.
## 
### 
Believing in the ideals and prin
ciples of true democracy and that
such a state does not exist at present
in this country, the Socialist Club of
Stanford has recently been formed.
H. D. Durst is president, and C. V.
Park, '11. secretary-treasurer of this
new organization.
It is the plan of the club to hold
monthly meetings, which will be ad
dressed by outside speakers. Women
will be admitted to the society at a
later date.
