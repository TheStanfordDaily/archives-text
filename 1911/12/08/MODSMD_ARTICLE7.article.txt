# FAST FINAL GAME TO INCREASE UNION FUNDS
## PALO ALTO AND BREAKERS TO RATTLE TOMORROW. Coach Presley Will Referee Championship Game in Post-Season Rugby Series. 
### 
In less than twenty-four hours the
much-mooted University rugby cham
pionship will have been decided. Ei
ther the Breakers fifteen or the Palo
Alto combination will have been re
turned winner from the final struggle
of the post-season series. The game
will begin at 3:30 on Stanford Field.
Both teams will put their strongest
line-ups into the field. A liberal
sprinkling of Varsity and near-Var
sity players will add spice to a con
test which promises to be the most
interesting since the affair of Novem
ber 11. Another contribution to the
interesting features of the game is the
fact that Palo Alto will use the 3-4
scrum arrangement. This combina
tion of forwards was used for the only
time this season on Stanford Field by
the Marines in their game with the
second team during the preliminary
season.
Presley Will Referee.
