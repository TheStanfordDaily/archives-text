# TINCHER WINS MILLS PEACE PRIZE CONTEST
## STANFORD MAN IS THE VICTOR FROM CALIFORNIA. Tincher, Drury, and Nowell Present Strong and Finished Orations Friday Evening. 
### 
E. E. Tincher, '12, was returned
winner in the intercollegiate Mills
Peace Oratorical contest, Friday even
ing, and became possessor of the one
hundred dollar award. "The Power of
Truth,"was Tincher's subject. A. W.
Drury, of California, and P. D. Nowell,
'13, were the other competitors. M.
Marks, who was selected at Califor
nia's preliminary contest to be Drury's
team-mate, was unable to be present.
The contest was throughout of a
remarkably high order. The speeches
were regarded by the judges as being
in reality practical contributions to
the cause of world peace. Each ora
tion was a finished and worthy produc
tion. but that Tincher was the premier
speaker of the evening was the pro
nounced opinion of the audience as
well as of the judges.
Tincher's Address Strong.
In discussing "The Power of Truth,"
Tincher gave practically the same ad
dress with which he won the Edward
Berwick, Jr., Peace Prize contest at
Stanford two weeks ago. His theme
was that proper education as to the
effects of war, especially in the sec
ondary schools of the country, would
tend powerfully to eliminate interna
tional strue. Instructors and text
books in history, by presenting truth
fully war and its results, would be
most efficient agents of peace.
Tincher's address was strong and
practical. In language and presenta
tion it was finished and forceful.
Tincher's forensic ability is well
known, and has been frequently dem
onstrated on the Stanford forum. His
previous appearances in contests with
California were in the Intercollegiate
and Carnot contests of last year.
In his oration Drury showed ex
cellent style and thought and a force
ful personality in presentation. The
means which ho advocated to put an
end to the war evil, were, however,
more theoretical and impracticable.
Nowell also gave much the same
speech which won for him second
place in the recent Berwick Peace con
test. He, too, laid stress upon the
value of education. He forcibly urgued
that the money now used for military
and naval purposes be applied to the
distribution of peace propaganda in
the form of lectures and literature.
Nowell is a member of Euphronia and
Encina Club, and has previously ap
peared as a member of debating teams.
The prize won by Tincher is pre
sented by James .Mills of Riverside, a
hearty exponent of the peace move
ment. It is to be contested for annual
ly by two speakers from Stanford and
two from California.
At the suggestion of the University
of California officials, three members
of the Stanford faculty. Professor A. G.
Newcomer, of the English department.
Pro'p«sor E. E. Robinson, of the His
tory department, and Professor E. P.
CuMierlev. of the Education depart
ment. officiated as judges.

Peace Oratorical contest, Friday even
ing, and became possessor of the one
hundred dollar award. "The Power of
Truth,"was Tincher's subject. A. W.
Drury, of California, and P. D. Nowell,
'13, were the other competitors. M.
Marks, who was selected at Califor
nia's preliminary contest to be Drury's
team-mate, was unable to be present.
The contest was throughout of a
remarkably high order. The speeches
were regarded by the judges as being
in reality practical contributions to
the cause of world peace. Each ora
tion was a finished and worthy produc
tion. but that Tincher was the premier
speaker of the evening was the pro
nounced opinion of the audience as
well as of the judges.
Tincher's Address Strong.
In discussing "The Power of Truth,"
Tincher gave practically the same ad
dress with which he won the Edward
Berwick, Jr., Peace Prize contest at
Stanford two weeks ago. His theme
was that proper education as to the
effects of war, especially in the sec
ondary schools of the country, would
tend powerfully to eliminate interna
tional strue. Instructors and text
books in history, by presenting truth
fully war and its results, would be
most efficient agents of peace.
Tincher's address was strong and
practical. In language and presenta
tion it was finished and forceful.
Tincher's forensic ability is well
known, and has been frequently dem
onstrated on the Stanford forum. His
previous appearances in contests with
California were in the Intercollegiate
and Carnot contests of last year.
In his oration Drury showed ex
cellent style and thought and a force
ful personality in presentation. The
means which ho advocated to put an
end to the war evil, were, however,
more theoretical and impracticable.
Nowell also gave much the same
speech which won for him second
place in the recent Berwick Peace con
test. He, too, laid stress upon the
value of education. He forcibly urgued
that the money now used for military
and naval purposes be applied to the
distribution of peace propaganda in
the form of lectures and literature.
Nowell is a member of Euphronia and
Encina Club, and has previously ap
peared as a member of debating teams.
The prize won by Tincher is pre
sented by James .Mills of Riverside, a
hearty exponent of the peace move
ment. It is to be contested for annual
ly by two speakers from Stanford and
two from California.
