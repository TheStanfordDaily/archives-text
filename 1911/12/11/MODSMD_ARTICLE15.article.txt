# CARDINAL SOCCER TEAM MEETS DEFEAT SATURDAY
## SPEEDY THISTLES ARE VICTORS BY 5 TO 2 SCORE. First Game of Williamson Cup Series To be Played February Twentysecond. 
### 
Stanford's soccer eleven was un
able to stem the tide of defeat which
has been hovering over the team for
the past few weeks and was compell
ed to lower its colors to the fast
Thistles by a score of 2 to 5, Saturday
afternoon. The winning players are
the leaders in the race for the cham
pionship of the California football
league and are acknowledged to be
the fastest combination of the associa
tion. The defeat of the Cardinal soc
cerites was not accomplished by any
easy means, as the Stanford players
fought an aggressive uphill game,
After they were clearly beaten the
team surprised the spectators by
rushing their mere skilled opponents
and forcing them to exhibit all the
finer points of the game learned by
long experience.
Reynolds and lliggins Score.
Coach 11. NY. Maloney played in the
forward line for his team. 15. Erb and
Shelton were absent from the Car
dinal squad. The two points which
the Stanford eleven made were the
results of a penalty award which Rey
nolds dropped into the net and a pass
ing rush engineered by the forwards,
ending in I-liggins' pretty shot to the
Thistles goal. Many times during the
contest the losers carried the ball into
the city men's territory, but excellent
blocking and good work on the part
of the Thistles' goalkeeper prevented
scores.
