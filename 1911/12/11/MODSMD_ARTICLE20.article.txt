Many of the big eastern coaches, in
cluding Camp of Yale, Williams of
Pennsylvania, and Haughton of Har
vard, are urging a return to the old
game as played in 1890 and 1891.
Yale has awarded 22 "Y's" to play
ers who took part in the Princeton
and Harvard games. This is the
largest number ever given in a single
season and has called forth a storm
of protest from the old grads.
Among other changes in the foot
ball rules advocated by Walter Camp,
four downs are to be given to gain
the necessary ten yards and a limiting
of the number of substitutes.
