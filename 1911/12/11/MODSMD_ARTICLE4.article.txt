# "Uncle John" Andrews Passes Away.
## 
### 
J. A. Andrews, known to the people
of this community as "Old Uncle
John," a pioneer carriage driver of
Palo Alto, died of heart disease last
night. "Uncle John'' had been failing
for some months past, and his count
less friends had slight, hope of his
surviving the winter, though he met
the trains regularly and was at his
accustomed post on the day of his
death.
Andrews was formerly an official of
the New York Central railroad, and
his only son is now an agent of the
same line. "Uncle John" began driv
ing between the station and the cam
pus nearly seventeen years ago. All
efforts to communicate with the son
in New York have so far been futile.
