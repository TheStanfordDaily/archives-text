# ORGAN IS HEARD AGAIN AFTER LONG SILENCE
## DR. BLODGETT PLAYS AT FIRST ASSEMBLY RECITAL. Instrument Retains Tone in Spite of Disaster and Five Years of Disuse. 
### 
Before a crowd of fully two thou
sand people, which taxed the Assem
bly hall to its fullest capacity, the
great organ of the Memorial Church
was wakened to life, Sunday, after
a silence of almost five years. To
Dr. B. C. Blodgett, of Palo Alto, or
ganist before the disaster of 190G, fell
the task of bringing into being again
the wonderful tones of the famous
instrument.
The nature of the Assembly Hall
probably did not work to the best ad
vantage for the proper playing of the
organ. It is difficult to maintain si
lence at any time among a crowd of
two thousand people, but when these
people are placed in a building such
as that in which the recital was given,
silence is impossible. This was the
opinion of many of those who heard
Sunday's program. On the other hand,
it seems probable that many more of
those in the audience appreciated and
enjoyed the recital to the extreme, in
spife of these unforunate accompani
ments to the program.
Organ Tone Beautiful.
The tone of the organ was all that
its most sanguine hearers of the pre -
earthquake days claimed for it. It
was rich and full at all times, although
during a considerable portion of the
program, when the softer stops were
used, it was difficult to catch every
tone. Some felt the disadvantage of
sitting with their backs- to the organ
ist. As it was, only those in the gal
lery could see the face and hands of
the player.
In spite of all these features, in
cident more to the unfortunate con
struction of the hall than to any
fault of the program, the recital was
a thorough success. The huge crowd
which attended witnessed this by their
silent and thoughtful appearance as
they left the building. The organ,
after five years of disuse, was still
as potent as it had been in the days of
old.
The solos and choral selections
were all excellently rendered, with an
accompaniment by the University
Orchestra. Dr. D. C. Gardner preach
ed the sermon of the day, a short talk
appropriate to the Christmas season.
