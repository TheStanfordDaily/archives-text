# PALO ALTO STUDENTS WIN CHAMPIONSHIP
## BREAKERS LOSE TO OFF-CAMPUS MEN, 8-0. Novel Formation of 4-3 Scrum is Responsible For Good Part of Victory Saturday. 
### 
By an 8-0 score the Palo Alto fifteen.
! team one, took the final post-season
j rugby game and the University cham
j pionship from team two, the Breakers,
j Saturday. The game was fast and
i furious from start to finish, and the
j class of rugby displayed throughout
j was truly of championship order.
Both teams adhered during the
whole contest to the open game, in
j which style of play Palo Alto had a
shade of advantage. A noticeable
j feature was the splendid passing,
which has seldom been excelled on
j Stanford Field this year. Had the
i teams practised together sufficiently
i to develop more teamwork, some sen
j national passing rushes would have
; resulted from the excellence in this
| department of the game. Cross kicks
; and other favorite tricks were also
i demonstrated to the delight of the
I bleachers.
Lineups Both Star,
j Both teams put star lineups into
; the field, and the game was notable as
1 bringing into the limelight several
! new players of excellent promise.
! Palo Alto possessed a dashing back
\ field and also appeared to advantage
I i'.i the forward division, but had no
easy time with the fast and veteran
[ Breakers fifteen. Of the Varsity play
! ers who appeared in suits, Risling
was the only one who displayed his
. usual form.
Palo Alto's interesting choice of the
1-3 and wing-forward scrum forma-
I tion was apparently vindicated. Time
after time their hookers were able to
1 a:et the ball out to Steinhart, who shot
| it to the backs for gains.
No Seore First Half.
After Miller's kickoiT, Palo Alto
rushed the ball down the field and
I Templeton found touch at the eating
; club's 20. After Brown's free boot
! Murray returned with good distance,
j Several times during this half the
Villagers threatened the campus ag
j gregation's goal, but by general kick
ing and the work of their forwards in
the loose, the latter team each time
prevented a score. Once, Smith saved
just in time to prevent Risling falling
on the ball over the line. Fighting
was of the hardest and kicking good.
! that of Howe being noticeable. At
1 the last of the period the Breakers
I marched down the field and the gun
found the ball on Palo Alto's 15.
Early in the second half, W. L.
i Smith bucked to a 5-yard scrum. But
I the ball was soon in Palo Alto terri
tory and Miller and Taylor attempted
I drops for goal unsuccessfully. When
| the town boys had forced the ball to
> midfleld, H. J. Smith sprinted to 25.
j After a long, hard fight the hall was
j put over, Vanderburg to Check turn-
I ing the trick. Templeton failed to
| convert.
The Breakers now rushed down the
i field and threatened a score, but TT. .T.
j Smith ran the ball out. With the ball
near midfield, the sensational play of
the game ensued. From the loose,
Kislin? secured, sprinted 30 yards,
and, by a timely pass, gave the ball
to Templeton, who dashed another 30
for a try. Howe converted. Palo Alto,
8; Breakers, 0.
This ended the scoring. Tlie game
was over with the ball on the Break
ers' 2f).
