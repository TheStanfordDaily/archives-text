# Conflicts In Dates.
## 
### 
With the closing of this semester to
social, dramatic and other dates, and
the making of new engagements, it

should be remembered that
a book to prevent con
flicts in dates of any
character is on hand at

the Registrar's Office. A deliberate
and unnecessary duplicating of an im
portant date of one organization by
another group of individuals occurred
this semester, causing a conflict that
was disastrous. It should become a
matter of popular opinion that dates
are not to lie selected which are al
ready taken. The recording of these
engagements, for whatever affair and
no matter how unimportant, should
be religiously kept in the book at the
Registrar's Office. It is hardly fair
to expect a dramatic production to
compete with a dance of any nature,
since it is common and humorous
knowledge that the patrons of the one
are usually those who attend the
other, and that the revenue derived
from this source is double and not
single.
Hut not only is there a falling off
in profits on account of the duplica
tion of a date, but ill-feeling enters
in also, and disturbs the smooth
running of the University machine.
Everyone should look out for the other
man, then, and save trouble. More
river. We Need the Union.
