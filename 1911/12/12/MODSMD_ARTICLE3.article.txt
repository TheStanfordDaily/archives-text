# PROSPECTS FOR WINNING IN CREW AND TRACK GOOD
## New and Undeveloped Material Strengthens Cardinal Teams and Repairs Losses Occurring Recently. 
### 
Stanford and California have met on
the water in intercollegiate regattas
seven times. In four of these races
the Cardinal has been returned the
winner. For the past three years
Stanford has not been defeated. The
1912 regatta should not result in a
break in this string of wins. Six vet
erans of last spring's eight are regis
tered in the University and a seventh
will be back next semester. In ad
dition to the rowers, F. L. Gnerena,
'11, coxswain, is also in college and
eligible for next year's crew.
The same system of coaching that
has been in vogue since the reestab
lishment of boating on an intercol
legiate basis will be used next semes
ter. The men who will assist Captain
R. 11. Seward, '12, in instructing his
candidates in the water art will be
chosen early in January. Light fall
training has been indulged in for some
time.
Few of the Varsity men, however,,
have been working out, since the early
training has been intended especially
for the Freshmen. By teaching the
new men the minor details necessary
for ail oarsman to know, and by get
ting the aspirants for crew honors
into fair condition at this time, much
valuable work will be saved next
spring. This is the first time fall
training has been tried at Stanford,
and the results are sure to be very
beneficial. Early next year the actual
work on the water will be undertaken.
Many of the Varsity men have been
out for football and so will have little
difficulty in getting into excellent
shape early in the season. Part of the
training will be done on Lake Lagun
ita, which will be filled about the time
college opens in January. The heavier
rowing will have the estuary at Red
wood as the scene of action.
Four Shells For Crews.
The Stanford crews will have four
boats in which to work on the water.
Two of these are eight oared shells
and the fourth has seat-! for a quartet
of rowers. The new shell purchased
from Sim, the boat builder of Putney.
England, who fashions the craft for
Cambridge and Oxford, will be used by
the first Varsity.
The veteran oarsmen who are regis
tered and are eligible for the 1012
crews are: Captain Seward. K. L.

With a nucleus of six point win
ners of last year's team, and seven
men who have previously scored
points in an intercollegiate meet,
around which to build a winning track
team for 1912, the opportunities for
a victory over California are hopeful,
but none too bright. The strength of
the Cardinal lies in the number of
men who were undeveloped last sea
son, and in the new men. Several cer
tain point winners were unable to com
pete in the last meet for various rea
sons. either through injuries or in
eligibility. "Dad" Moulton is sanguine
of the ability of the Stanford athletes
to make a winning team and from the
past showing of his charges is certain
of a victory on track and field next
spring.
In the dashes, Stanford will be es
pecially strong. Captain T. L. Cole
man, '12, was the winner of the sprints
for two seasons past, and was only
kepi from making a clean sweep last
year by an eleventh hour injury.
McKee, the 1914 sprinter who cap
tured first in the 220 yard dash and
third in the century, should again an
nex points in his events. If Campbell.
'K'>, is entered in the shorter distances,
prospects for an addition to the Stan
ford total are almost certain.
Good Men in Quarter.
Once more the quarter mile dash
will present a strong list of Cardinal
entries. C. C. Taylor, '11, and J. H.
Leman, '13, ran a dead heat for first
place last year. The former is again
eligible, and the latter may re-enter
the University at Christmas. W. Daw
son, '14, and R. E. Millsap, "12, will
also be relied on to capture points in
this race.
In the loss of T. M. Cramer, '11, who
took second in record time last spring,
and who was numbered among the
most likely winners in 1912, Stanford
will be compelled to develop new men
for the half mile. F. K. McClure, the
speedy Freshman 440-yard runner, will
probably be ranked high in this event
as well as in the mile. F. .T. (lard, '14,
must also be reckoned as a strong con
tender in the half. The mile and two
mile races are weak spots for the Car
dinal. California has record holders
in both events. In the former, L. II.

event in 1910 and who was ineligible

and are eligible.
Seward Hani Worker.
Seward is one of the hardest workers
who has ever pulled an oar in a Stan
ford boat. He has twice before repre
sented his University as an oarsman,
lie also served in the northern races
against Washington. Schaupp was the
leader of last year's crew and was the
premier oarsman of the eight. He has
had a seat in two races against Cali
fornia, having rowed at number 4 and
as stroke. Gilniore was the heaviest
man in the Stanford shell last spring.
He has twice rowed in an intercollegi
ate regatta. Hails held number 4 in
1911, and won his "S'' the year before
as bow. Duryea and Olmstead made
the crew for the first time last semes
ter. If Guerena does not come out
for a position next January, a cox
swain must be found to take his place.
J. W. Howell, '12, who made a strong
bid last semester, will probably be a
candidate for the position. He occu
pied the seat in his Freshman crew.
From the ranks of the 1914 Fresh
man eight several very promising can
didates are to be found, who will give
the older men a hard fight. F. W.
Wickman, F. B. Watkins, and R. R.
Blase are all hard fighters and showed
up extremely well last year. The.mid
get, Ford, who directed the '14 oars
men, will be out for coxswain. Many
other likely candidates will also be
found numbered among those who
aspire to honors in an intercollegiate
regatta when the season is formally
opened next January. The Freshman
class contains a wealth of crew ma
terial, and the men who have been
doing fall training give promise of
developing into an excellent squad.
last year, will again don spikes, as
will W. D. Fletcher, '11. C. L. Moore,
'12, did excellent work in this event
last season and must be considered
in conceding places in the next inter
collegiate mile.
Tmo-JIIUts Promised.
W. J. Dodge, '13, promises to develop
into a sensational runner in the long
two mile grind. In the fall prelimin
ary meet held several weeks ago he
set a new early season mark in this
event by going the distance in 10:17.
\\ r . H. Newman, "12, who won this race
in 1910, may also enter. Several new
men have been showing to advantage
in the cross-country runs of the pres
ent semester.
For several years past Stanford has
been weak in the hurdles. The next
meet should show several surprises
among the timber-toppers. Campbell
will make the Californians extend
themselves to the utmost to annex first
place. R. R. Templeton, '15, will also
be among tlie first to break the tape.
He has shown great form over the
high sticks and should do well in the
big meet. E. F. Kern, '13, is expected
to make good time in the longer hur
dles. lie was robbed ot' a certain third
in the last intercollegiate meet by a
s'iiht mishap. D. Dawson, '15, is an
other performer who may develop into
a speedy runner in the jumping races.
In the field events the Cardinal team
will have a much better chance to
register points than in 1911. M. N.
Alderman. '12, former Conference meet
star of the middle-west colleges, must
be reckoned with in the shot put and
hammer throw. The latter event will
undoubtedly be his strong forte. .1. E.
Wool ley, '12, has always been able to
make points for Stanford in the
weights. He will be a good teammate
for Alderman.
High-.lumpers Still Here.
The high jump resulted in one of
the surprises of the last Stanford-
California meet. (!. L. Horine, '13, will
again represent the Cardinal and he
should lie able to win points as he lias
consistently done in the past. Al
though he was compelled to accept a
tie last spring, yet he should do better
in 1912. W. R. Finney, '12, will also
be an entry in the high jump and
should place in the next intercollegiate
meet. W. M. Argabrite, '13. who placed
in 1910, may be aide to repeat next
season.
A number of good men are left for
the pole vault. J. A. Miller, '13, the
winner of the pole vault in the last
meet, V. .T. Stephens, C. Boulware, '14,
and It. R. Templeton, '15, must be
given recognition. The pole vault has
been a Stanford event for some years,
and "Dad" is expected to develop more
vaulters of the quality of Lanagan,
Scott, and Bellah. The Freshman,
Templeton. promises to make another
great leaper.
1). Dawson, '15, is the jumper who is
expected to do the most in the broad
jump. He has leaped over twenty-two
feet in practice, and should increase
bis mark materially.
The relay should be another certain
Stnfor l event. With W. Dawson,
Ta' lor Milsap. Wallace, Card. Carter,
and McClure as a combination to bank
on. and the likelihood of the develop
ment of additional fast men there

seems little cause for anxiety over
this event.
"Dark Horses."
Among the men who may be reckon
ed with next season, may be numbered
many who gave signs of making speedy
trackmen in past years. It takes time
I for some athletes to show their true
j worth, and every teams returns point
winners who have not been ceded a
chance in previous seasons.
In the distances, G. Bevier, '11, C. G.
Duffln, '13, E. T. Worthy, '14, V. M.
Smith, '14, R. L. Murray, '13, T. F.
Angell, '15, G. E. Needham, '13. may be
[expected to give a good account of
themselves. Many of the underclass
men will be included in the list of
probabilities in 1912. The Freshman
class is sure to contribute some excel
lent second rate men. With the long
list of veteran first place men who
have returned to California, the chance
for a Stanford victory rests mainly
in the ability of the Cardinal athletes
I to cut into her column of first and to
j develop second and third place win
j ners in all events.

For several years past Stanford has

among the timber-toppers. Campbell
will make the Californians extend
themselves to the utmost to annex first
place. R. R. Templeton, '15, will also
be among tlie first to break the tape.
He has shown great form over the

to make good time in the longer hur

The high jump resulted in one of
the surprises of the last Stanford-
California meet. (!. L. Horine, '13, will
again represent the Cardinal and he
should lie able to win points as he lias
consistently done in the past. Al
though he was compelled to accept a

in 1912. W. R. Finney, '12, will also
be an entry in the high jump and
should place in the next intercollegiate
meet. W. M. Argabrite, '13. who placed
in 1910, may be aide to repeat next
season.
A number of good men are left for
the pole vault. J. A. Miller, '13, the
winner of the pole vault in the last
meet, V. .T. Stephens, C. Boulware, '14,
and It. R. Templeton, '15, must be
given recognition. The pole vault has
been a Stanford event for some years,
and "Dad" is expected to develop more

Templeton. promises to make another

"Dark Horses."
Among the men who may be reckon
ed with next season, may be numbered
many who gave signs of making speedy
trackmen in past years. It takes time
I for some athletes to show their true
j worth, and every teams returns point
winners who have not been ceded a
chance in previous seasons.
In the distances, G. Bevier, '11, C. G.

Smith, '14, R. L. Murray, '13, T. F.
Angell, '15, G. E. Needham, '13. may be
[expected to give a good account of
themselves. Many of the underclass
men will be included in the list of
probabilities in 1912. The Freshman
class is sure to contribute some excel

list of veteran first place men who
have returned to California, the chance
for a Stanford victory rests mainly
in the ability of the Cardinal athletes
I to cut into her column of first and to
j develop second and third place win
j ners in all events.
Stanford and California have met on
the water in intercollegiate regattas
seven times. In four of these races
the Cardinal has been returned the
winner. For the past three years
Stanford has not been defeated. The
1912 regatta should not result in a
break in this string of wins. Six vet
erans of last spring's eight are regis
tered in the University and a seventh
will be back next semester. In ad
dition to the rowers, F. L. Gnerena,
'11, coxswain, is also in college and
eligible for next year's crew.
The same system of coaching that
has been in vogue since the reestab
lishment of boating on an intercol
legiate basis will be used next semes
ter. The men who will assist Captain
R. 11. Seward, '12, in instructing his
candidates in the water art will be
chosen early in January. Light fall
training has been indulged in for some
time.
Few of the Varsity men, however,,
have been working out, since the early
training has been intended especially
for the Freshmen. By teaching the
new men the minor details necessary
for ail oarsman to know, and by get
ting the aspirants for crew honors
into fair condition at this time, much
valuable work will be saved next
spring. This is the first time fall
training has been tried at Stanford,
and the results are sure to be very
beneficial. Early next year the actual
work on the water will be undertaken.
Many of the Varsity men have been
out for football and so will have little
difficulty in getting into excellent
shape early in the season. Part of the
training will be done on Lake Lagun
ita, which will be filled about the time
college opens in January. The heavier
rowing will have the estuary at Red
wood as the scene of action.
Four Shells For Crews.
The Stanford crews will have four
boats in which to work on the water.
Two of these are eight oared shells
and the fourth has seat-! for a quartet
of rowers. The new shell purchased
from Sim, the boat builder of Putney.
England, who fashions the craft for
Cambridge and Oxford, will be used by
the first Varsity.
The veteran oarsmen who are regis
tered and are eligible for the 1012
crews are: Captain Seward. K. L.

With a nucleus of six point win
ners of last year's team, and seven
men who have previously scored
points in an intercollegiate meet,
around which to build a winning track
team for 1912, the opportunities for
a victory over California are hopeful,
but none too bright. The strength of
the Cardinal lies in the number of
men who were undeveloped last sea
son, and in the new men. Several cer
tain point winners were unable to com
pete in the last meet for various rea
sons. either through injuries or in
eligibility. "Dad" Moulton is sanguine
of the ability of the Stanford athletes
to make a winning team and from the
past showing of his charges is certain
of a victory on track and field next
spring.
In the dashes, Stanford will be es
pecially strong. Captain T. L. Cole
man, '12, was the winner of the sprints
for two seasons past, and was only
kepi from making a clean sweep last
year by an eleventh hour injury.
McKee, the 1914 sprinter who cap
tured first in the 220 yard dash and
third in the century, should again an
nex points in his events. If Campbell.
'K'>, is entered in the shorter distances,
prospects for an addition to the Stan
ford total are almost certain.
Good Men in Quarter.
Once more the quarter mile dash
will present a strong list of Cardinal
entries. C. C. Taylor, '11, and J. H.
Leman, '13, ran a dead heat for first
place last year. The former is again
eligible, and the latter may re-enter
the University at Christmas. W. Daw
son, '14, and R. E. Millsap, "12, will
also be relied on to capture points in
this race.
In the loss of T. M. Cramer, '11, who
took second in record time last spring,
and who was numbered among the
most likely winners in 1912, Stanford
will be compelled to develop new men
for the half mile. F. K. McClure, the
speedy Freshman 440-yard runner, will
probably be ranked high in this event
as well as in the mile. F. .T. (lard, '14,
must also be reckoned as a strong con
tender in the half. The mile and two
mile races are weak spots for the Car
dinal. California has record holders
in both events. In the former, L. II.

event in 1910 and who was ineligible

Seward is one of the hardest workers
who has ever pulled an oar in a Stan
ford boat. He has twice before repre

lie also served in the northern races
against Washington. Schaupp was the
leader of last year's crew and was the
premier oarsman of the eight. He has
had a seat in two races against Cali
fornia, having rowed at number 4 and
as stroke. Gilniore was the heaviest
man in the Stanford shell last spring.
He has twice rowed in an intercollegi
ate regatta. Hails held number 4 in
1911, and won his "S'' the year before
as bow. Duryea and Olmstead made
the crew for the first time last semes

for a position next January, a cox
swain must be found to take his place.
J. W. Howell, '12, who made a strong

From the ranks of the 1914 Fresh

Four Shells For Crews.
The Stanford crews will have four
boats in which to work on the water.
Two of these are eight oared shells
and the fourth has seat-! for a quartet
of rowers. The new shell purchased
from Sim, the boat builder of Putney.
England, who fashions the craft for
Cambridge and Oxford, will be used by
the first Varsity.
The veteran oarsmen who are regis

With a nucleus of six point win
ners of last year's team, and seven
men who have previously scored
points in an intercollegiate meet,
around which to build a winning track
team for 1912, the opportunities for
a victory over California are hopeful,
but none too bright. The strength of
the Cardinal lies in the number of
men who were undeveloped last sea
son, and in the new men. Several cer
tain point winners were unable to com
pete in the last meet for various rea
sons. either through injuries or in
eligibility. "Dad" Moulton is sanguine
of the ability of the Stanford athletes
to make a winning team and from the
past showing of his charges is certain
of a victory on track and field next
spring.
In the dashes, Stanford will be es
pecially strong. Captain T. L. Cole
man, '12, was the winner of the sprints
for two seasons past, and was only
kepi from making a clean sweep last
year by an eleventh hour injury.
McKee, the 1914 sprinter who cap
tured first in the 220 yard dash and
third in the century, should again an
nex points in his events. If Campbell.
'K'>, is entered in the shorter distances,
prospects for an addition to the Stan
ford total are almost certain.
Good Men in Quarter.
Once more the quarter mile dash
will present a strong list of Cardinal
entries. C. C. Taylor, '11, and J. H.
Leman, '13, ran a dead heat for first
place last year. The former is again
eligible, and the latter may re-enter
the University at Christmas. W. Daw
son, '14, and R. E. Millsap, "12, will
also be relied on to capture points in
this race.
In the loss of T. M. Cramer, '11, who
took second in record time last spring,
and who was numbered among the
most likely winners in 1912, Stanford
will be compelled to develop new men
for the half mile. F. K. McClure, the
speedy Freshman 440-yard runner, will
probably be ranked high in this event
as well as in the mile. F. .T. (lard, '14,
must also be reckoned as a strong con

Seward Hani Worker.
Seward is one of the hardest workers
who has ever pulled an oar in a Stan
ford boat. He has twice before repre
sented his University as an oarsman,
lie also served in the northern races
against Washington. Schaupp was the
leader of last year's crew and was the
premier oarsman of the eight. He has
had a seat in two races against Cali
fornia, having rowed at number 4 and
as stroke. Gilniore was the heaviest
man in the Stanford shell last spring.
He has twice rowed in an intercollegi
ate regatta. Hails held number 4 in
1911, and won his "S'' the year before
as bow. Duryea and Olmstead made
the crew for the first time last semes
ter. If Guerena does not come out
for a position next January, a cox
swain must be found to take his place.
J. W. Howell, '12, who made a strong
bid last semester, will probably be a
candidate for the position. He occu
pied the seat in his Freshman crew.
From the ranks of the 1914 Fresh
man eight several very promising can
didates are to be found, who will give
the older men a hard fight. F. W.
Wickman, F. B. Watkins, and R. R.
Blase are all hard fighters and showed
up extremely well last year. The.mid

men, will be out for coxswain. Many
other likely candidates will also be

aspire to honors in an intercollegiate
regatta when the season is formally

class contains a wealth of crew ma

doing fall training give promise of
developing into an excellent squad.

will W. D. Fletcher, '11. C. L. Moore,
'12, did excellent work in this event
last season and must be considered
in conceding places in the next inter

Tmo-JIIUts Promised.
W. J. Dodge, '13, promises to develop
into a sensational runner in the long
two mile grind. In the fall prelimin
ary meet held several weeks ago he
set a new early season mark in this
event by going the distance in 10:17.
\\ r . H. Newman, "12, who won this race
in 1910, may also enter. Several new
men have been showing to advantage
in the cross-country runs of the pres
ent semester.
For several years past Stanford has
been weak in the hurdles. The next
meet should show several surprises
among the timber-toppers. Campbell
will make the Californians extend
themselves to the utmost to annex first
place. R. R. Templeton, '15, will also
be among tlie first to break the tape.
He has shown great form over the
high sticks and should do well in the
big meet. E. F. Kern, '13, is expected
to make good time in the longer hur
dles. lie was robbed ot' a certain third
in the last intercollegiate meet by a
s'iiht mishap. D. Dawson, '15, is an
other performer who may develop into
a speedy runner in the jumping races.
In the field events the Cardinal team
will have a much better chance to
register points than in 1911. M. N.
Alderman. '12, former Conference meet
star of the middle-west colleges, must
be reckoned with in the shot put and
hammer throw. The latter event will
undoubtedly be his strong forte. .1. E.
Wool ley, '12, has always been able to
make points for Stanford in the
weights. He will be a good teammate
for Alderman.
High-.lumpers Still Here.
The high jump resulted in one of
the surprises of the last Stanford-
California meet. (!. L. Horine, '13, will
again represent the Cardinal and he
should lie able to win points as he lias
consistently done in the past. Al
though he was compelled to accept a
tie last spring, yet he should do better
in 1912. W. R. Finney, '12, will also
be an entry in the high jump and
should place in the next intercollegiate
meet. W. M. Argabrite, '13. who placed
in 1910, may be aide to repeat next
season.
A number of good men are left for
the pole vault. J. A. Miller, '13, the
winner of the pole vault in the last
meet, V. .T. Stephens, C. Boulware, '14,
and It. R. Templeton, '15, must be
given recognition. The pole vault has
been a Stanford event for some years,
and "Dad" is expected to develop more
vaulters of the quality of Lanagan,
Scott, and Bellah. The Freshman,
Templeton. promises to make another
great leaper.
1). Dawson, '15, is the jumper who is
expected to do the most in the broad
jump. He has leaped over twenty-two
feet in practice, and should increase
bis mark materially.
The relay should be another certain
Stnfor l event. With W. Dawson,
Ta' lor Milsap. Wallace, Card. Carter,
and McClure as a combination to bank
on. and the likelihood of the develop
ment of additional fast men there

seems little cause for anxiety over
this event.
"Dark Horses."
Among the men who may be reckon
ed with next season, may be numbered
many who gave signs of making speedy
trackmen in past years. It takes time
I for some athletes to show their true
j worth, and every teams returns point
winners who have not been ceded a
chance in previous seasons.
In the distances, G. Bevier, '11, C. G.
Duffln, '13, E. T. Worthy, '14, V. M.
Smith, '14, R. L. Murray, '13, T. F.
Angell, '15, G. E. Needham, '13. may be
[expected to give a good account of
themselves. Many of the underclass
men will be included in the list of
probabilities in 1912. The Freshman
class is sure to contribute some excel
lent second rate men. With the long
list of veteran first place men who
have returned to California, the chance
for a Stanford victory rests mainly
in the ability of the Cardinal athletes
I to cut into her column of first and to
j develop second and third place win
j ners in all events.
Stanford and California have met on
the water in intercollegiate regattas
seven times. In four of these races
the Cardinal has been returned the
winner. For the past three years
Stanford has not been defeated. The
1912 regatta should not result in a
break in this string of wins. Six vet
erans of last spring's eight are regis
tered in the University and a seventh
will be back next semester. In ad
dition to the rowers, F. L. Gnerena,
'11, coxswain, is also in college and
eligible for next year's crew.
The same system of coaching that
has been in vogue since the reestab
lishment of boating on an intercol
legiate basis will be used next semes
ter. The men who will assist Captain
R. 11. Seward, '12, in instructing his
candidates in the water art will be
chosen early in January. Light fall
training has been indulged in for some
time.
Few of the Varsity men, however,,
have been working out, since the early
training has been intended especially
for the Freshmen. By teaching the
new men the minor details necessary
for ail oarsman to know, and by get
ting the aspirants for crew honors
into fair condition at this time, much
valuable work will be saved next
spring. This is the first time fall
training has been tried at Stanford,
and the results are sure to be very
beneficial. Early next year the actual
work on the water will be undertaken.
Many of the Varsity men have been
out for football and so will have little
difficulty in getting into excellent
shape early in the season. Part of the
training will be done on Lake Lagun
ita, which will be filled about the time
college opens in January. The heavier
rowing will have the estuary at Red

In the field events the Cardinal team
will have a much better chance to

High-.lumpers Still Here.
The high jump resulted in one of
the surprises of the last Stanford-
California meet. (!. L. Horine, '13, will
again represent the Cardinal and he
should lie able to win points as he lias
consistently done in the past. Al
though he was compelled to accept a
tie last spring, yet he should do better
in 1912. W. R. Finney, '12, will also
be an entry in the high jump and
should place in the next intercollegiate
meet. W. M. Argabrite, '13. who placed
in 1910, may be aide to repeat next
season.
A number of good men are left for
the pole vault. J. A. Miller, '13, the
winner of the pole vault in the last
meet, V. .T. Stephens, C. Boulware, '14,
and It. R. Templeton, '15, must be
given recognition. The pole vault has
been a Stanford event for some years,
and "Dad" is expected to develop more
vaulters of the quality of Lanagan,
Scott, and Bellah. The Freshman,
Templeton. promises to make another
great leaper.
1). Dawson, '15, is the jumper who is

"Dark Horses."
Among the men who may be reckon
ed with next season, may be numbered
many who gave signs of making speedy
trackmen in past years. It takes time
I for some athletes to show their true
j worth, and every teams returns point
winners who have not been ceded a
chance in previous seasons.
In the distances, G. Bevier, '11, C. G.

Smith, '14, R. L. Murray, '13, T. F.

men will be included in the list of
probabilities in 1912. The Freshman
class is sure to contribute some excel

list of veteran first place men who
have returned to California, the chance
for a Stanford victory rests mainly
in the ability of the Cardinal athletes
I to cut into her column of first and to
j develop second and third place win
j ners in all events.
Stanford and California have met on
the water in intercollegiate regattas
seven times. In four of these races
the Cardinal has been returned the
winner. For the past three years
Stanford has not been defeated. The
1912 regatta should not result in a
break in this string of wins. Six vet
erans of last spring's eight are regis
tered in the University and a seventh
will be back next semester. In ad
dition to the rowers, F. L. Gnerena,
'11, coxswain, is also in college and
eligible for next year's crew.
The same system of coaching that
has been in vogue since the reestab
lishment of boating on an intercol
legiate basis will be used next semes
ter. The men who will assist Captain
R. 11. Seward, '12, in instructing his
candidates in the water art will be
chosen early in January. Light fall
training has been indulged in for some
time.
Few of the Varsity men, however,,
have been working out, since the early
training has been intended especially
for the Freshmen. By teaching the
new men the minor details necessary
for ail oarsman to know, and by get
ting the aspirants for crew honors
into fair condition at this time, much
valuable work will be saved next
spring. This is the first time fall
training has been tried at Stanford,
and the results are sure to be very
beneficial. Early next year the actual
work on the water will be undertaken.
Many of the Varsity men have been
out for football and so will have little
difficulty in getting into excellent
shape early in the season. Part of the
training will be done on Lake Lagun
ita, which will be filled about the time
college opens in January. The heavier
rowing will have the estuary at Red
wood as the scene of action.
Four Shells For Crews.
The Stanford crews will have four
boats in which to work on the water.
Two of these are eight oared shells
and the fourth has seat-! for a quartet
of rowers. The new shell purchased
from Sim, the boat builder of Putney.
England, who fashions the craft for
Cambridge and Oxford, will be used by
the first Varsity.
The veteran oarsmen who are regis
tered and are eligible for the 1012
crews are: Captain Seward. K. L.

With a nucleus of six point win
ners of last year's team, and seven
men who have previously scored
points in an intercollegiate meet,
around which to build a winning track
team for 1912, the opportunities for
a victory over California are hopeful,
but none too bright. The strength of
the Cardinal lies in the number of
men who were undeveloped last sea
son, and in the new men. Several cer
tain point winners were unable to com
pete in the last meet for various rea
sons. either through injuries or in
eligibility. "Dad" Moulton is sanguine
of the ability of the Stanford athletes
to make a winning team and from the
past showing of his charges is certain
of a victory on track and field next
spring.
In the dashes, Stanford will be es
pecially strong. Captain T. L. Cole
man, '12, was the winner of the sprints
for two seasons past, and was only
kepi from making a clean sweep last
year by an eleventh hour injury.
McKee, the 1914 sprinter who cap
tured first in the 220 yard dash and
third in the century, should again an
nex points in his events. If Campbell.
'K'>, is entered in the shorter distances,
prospects for an addition to the Stan
ford total are almost certain.
Good Men in Quarter.
Once more the quarter mile dash
will present a strong list of Cardinal
entries. C. C. Taylor, '11, and J. H.
Leman, '13, ran a dead heat for first
place last year. The former is again
eligible, and the latter may re-enter
the University at Christmas. W. Daw
son, '14, and R. E. Millsap, "12, will
also be relied on to capture points in
this race.
In the loss of T. M. Cramer, '11, who
took second in record time last spring,
and who was numbered among the
most likely winners in 1912, Stanford
will be compelled to develop new men
for the half mile. F. K. McClure, the
speedy Freshman 440-yard runner, will
probably be ranked high in this event
as well as in the mile. F. .T. (lard, '14,
must also be reckoned as a strong con
tender in the half. The mile and two
mile races are weak spots for the Car
dinal. California has record holders
in both events. In the former, L. II.

event in 1910 and who was ineligible

Seward Hani Worker.
Seward is one of the hardest workers
who has ever pulled an oar in a Stan
ford boat. He has twice before repre
sented his University as an oarsman,
lie also served in the northern races
against Washington. Schaupp was the
leader of last year's crew and was the
premier oarsman of the eight. He has
had a seat in two races against Cali
fornia, having rowed at number 4 and
as stroke. Gilniore was the heaviest
man in the Stanford shell last spring.
He has twice rowed in an intercollegi
ate regatta. Hails held number 4 in
1911, and won his "S'' the year before
as bow. Duryea and Olmstead made
the crew for the first time last semes
ter. If Guerena does not come out
for a position next January, a cox
swain must be found to take his place.
J. W. Howell, '12, who made a strong
bid last semester, will probably be a
candidate for the position. He occu
pied the seat in his Freshman crew.
From the ranks of the 1914 Fresh
man eight several very promising can
didates are to be found, who will give
the older men a hard fight. F. W.
Wickman, F. B. Watkins, and R. R.
Blase are all hard fighters and showed
up extremely well last year. The.mid
get, Ford, who directed the '14 oars
men, will be out for coxswain. Many
other likely candidates will also be
found numbered among those who
aspire to honors in an intercollegiate
regatta when the season is formally
opened next January. The Freshman
class contains a wealth of crew ma
terial, and the men who have been
doing fall training give promise of
developing into an excellent squad.

last season and must be considered

Tmo-JIIUts Promised.
W. J. Dodge, '13, promises to develop
into a sensational runner in the long
two mile grind. In the fall prelimin
ary meet held several weeks ago he
set a new early season mark in this
event by going the distance in 10:17.
\\ r . H. Newman, "12, who won this race
in 1910, may also enter. Several new
men have been showing to advantage
in the cross-country runs of the pres
ent semester.
For several years past Stanford has
been weak in the hurdles. The next
meet should show several surprises
among the timber-toppers. Campbell
will make the Californians extend
themselves to the utmost to annex first
place. R. R. Templeton, '15, will also
be among tlie first to break the tape.
He has shown great form over the
high sticks and should do well in the
big meet. E. F. Kern, '13, is expected
to make good time in the longer hur

'K'>, is entered in the shorter distances,
prospects for an addition to the Stan
ford total are almost certain.
Good Men in Quarter.
Once more the quarter mile dash
will present a strong list of Cardinal
entries. C. C. Taylor, '11, and J. H.
Leman, '13, ran a dead heat for first
place last year. The former is again
eligible, and the latter may re-enter
the University at Christmas. W. Daw
son, '14, and R. E. Millsap, "12, will
also be relied on to capture points in
this race.
In the loss of T. M. Cramer, '11, who
took second in record time last spring,
and who was numbered among the
most likely winners in 1912, Stanford
will be compelled to develop new men
for the half mile. F. K. McClure, the
speedy Freshman 440-yard runner, will
probably be ranked high in this event
as well as in the mile. F. .T. (lard, '14,
must also be reckoned as a strong con
tender in the half. The mile and two
mile races are weak spots for the Car
dinal. California has record holders
in both events. In the former, L. II.

event in 1910 and who was ineligible

of the 1909 Varsity and Washington
eights, C. H. Beal, '13, and A. M. San

and are eligible.
Seward Hani Worker.
Seward is one of the hardest workers
who has ever pulled an oar in a Stan
ford boat. He has twice before repre
sented his University as an oarsman,
lie also served in the northern races
against Washington. Schaupp was the
leader of last year's crew and was the
premier oarsman of the eight. He has
had a seat in two races against Cali
fornia, having rowed at number 4 and
as stroke. Gilniore was the heaviest
man in the Stanford shell last spring.
He has twice rowed in an intercollegi
ate regatta. Hails held number 4 in
1911, and won his "S'' the year before
as bow. Duryea and Olmstead made
the crew for the first time last semes
ter. If Guerena does not come out
for a position next January, a cox
swain must be found to take his place.
J. W. Howell, '12, who made a strong
bid last semester, will probably be a
candidate for the position. He occu
pied the seat in his Freshman crew.
From the ranks of the 1914 Fresh
man eight several very promising can
didates are to be found, who will give
the older men a hard fight. F. W.
Wickman, F. B. Watkins, and R. R.
Blase are all hard fighters and showed
up extremely well last year. The.mid
get, Ford, who directed the '14 oars
men, will be out for coxswain. Many
other likely candidates will also be
found numbered among those who
aspire to honors in an intercollegiate
regatta when the season is formally
opened next January. The Freshman
class contains a wealth of crew ma
terial, and the men who have been
doing fall training give promise of
developing into an excellent squad.
last year, will again don spikes, as
will W. D. Fletcher, '11. C. L. Moore,
'12, did excellent work in this event
last season and must be considered
in conceding places in the next inter
collegiate mile.
Tmo-JIIUts Promised.
W. J. Dodge, '13, promises to develop
into a sensational runner in the long
two mile grind. In the fall prelimin
ary meet held several weeks ago he
set a new early season mark in this
event by going the distance in 10:17.
\\ r . H. Newman, "12, who won this race
in 1910, may also enter. Several new
men have been showing to advantage
in the cross-country runs of the pres
ent semester.
For several years past Stanford has
been weak in the hurdles. The next
meet should show several surprises
among the timber-toppers. Campbell
will make the Californians extend
themselves to the utmost to annex first
place. R. R. Templeton, '15, will also
be among tlie first to break the tape.
He has shown great form over the
high sticks and should do well in the
big meet. E. F. Kern, '13, is expected
to make good time in the longer hur
dles. lie was robbed ot' a certain third
in the last intercollegiate meet by a
s'iiht mishap. D. Dawson, '15, is an
other performer who may develop into
a speedy runner in the jumping races.
In the field events the Cardinal team
will have a much better chance to
register points than in 1911. M. N.
Alderman. '12, former Conference meet
star of the middle-west colleges, must
be reckoned with in the shot put and
hammer throw. The latter event will
undoubtedly be his strong forte. .1. E.
Wool ley, '12, has always been able to
make points for Stanford in the
weights. He will be a good teammate
for Alderman.
High-.lumpers Still Here.
The high jump resulted in one of
the surprises of the last Stanford-
California meet. (!. L. Horine, '13, will
again represent the Cardinal and he
should lie able to win points as he lias
consistently done in the past. Al
though he was compelled to accept a
tie last spring, yet he should do better
in 1912. W. R. Finney, '12, will also
be an entry in the high jump and
should place in the next intercollegiate
meet. W. M. Argabrite, '13. who placed
in 1910, may be aide to repeat next
season.
A number of good men are left for
the pole vault. J. A. Miller, '13, the
winner of the pole vault in the last
meet, V. .T. Stephens, C. Boulware, '14,
and It. R. Templeton, '15, must be
given recognition. The pole vault has
been a Stanford event for some years,
and "Dad" is expected to develop more
vaulters of the quality of Lanagan,
Scott, and Bellah. The Freshman,
Templeton. promises to make another
great leaper.
1). Dawson, '15, is the jumper who is
expected to do the most in the broad
jump. He has leaped over twenty-two
feet in practice, and should increase
bis mark materially.
The relay should be another certain
Stnfor l event. With W. Dawson,
Ta' lor Milsap. Wallace, Card. Carter,
and McClure as a combination to bank
on. and the likelihood of the develop
ment of additional fast men there

seems little cause for anxiety over
this event.
"Dark Horses."
Among the men who may be reckon
ed with next season, may be numbered
many who gave signs of making speedy
trackmen in past years. It takes time
I for some athletes to show their true
j worth, and every teams returns point
winners who have not been ceded a
chance in previous seasons.
In the distances, G. Bevier, '11, C. G.
Duffln, '13, E. T. Worthy, '14, V. M.
Smith, '14, R. L. Murray, '13, T. F.
Angell, '15, G. E. Needham, '13. may be
[expected to give a good account of
themselves. Many of the underclass
men will be included in the list of
probabilities in 1912. The Freshman
class is sure to contribute some excel
lent second rate men. With the long
list of veteran first place men who
have returned to California, the chance
for a Stanford victory rests mainly
in the ability of the Cardinal athletes
I to cut into her column of first and to
j develop second and third place win
j ners in all events.
Stanford and California have met on
the water in intercollegiate regattas
seven times. In four of these races
the Cardinal has been returned the
winner. For the past three years
Stanford has not been defeated. The
1912 regatta should not result in a
break in this string of wins. Six vet
erans of last spring's eight are regis
tered in the University and a seventh
will be back next semester. In ad
dition to the rowers, F. L. Gnerena,
'11, coxswain, is also in college and
eligible for next year's crew.
The same system of coaching that
has been in vogue since the reestab
lishment of boating on an intercol
legiate basis will be used next semes
ter. The men who will assist Captain
R. 11. Seward, '12, in instructing his
candidates in the water art will be
chosen early in January. Light fall
training has been indulged in for some
time.
Few of the Varsity men, however,,
have been working out, since the early
training has been intended especially
for the Freshmen. By teaching the
new men the minor details necessary
for ail oarsman to know, and by get
ting the aspirants for crew honors
into fair condition at this time, much
valuable work will be saved next
spring. This is the first time fall
training has been tried at Stanford,
and the results are sure to be very
beneficial. Early next year the actual
work on the water will be undertaken.
Many of the Varsity men have been
out for football and so will have little
difficulty in getting into excellent
shape early in the season. Part of the
training will be done on Lake Lagun
ita, which will be filled about the time
college opens in January. The heavier
rowing will have the estuary at Red
wood as the scene of action.
Four Shells For Crews.
The Stanford crews will have four
boats in which to work on the water.
Two of these are eight oared shells
and the fourth has seat-! for a quartet
of rowers. The new shell purchased
from Sim, the boat builder of Putney.
England, who fashions the craft for
Cambridge and Oxford, will be used by
the first Varsity.
The veteran oarsmen who are regis
tered and are eligible for the 1012
crews are: Captain Seward. K. L.

With a nucleus of six point win
ners of last year's team, and seven
men who have previously scored
points in an intercollegiate meet,
around which to build a winning track
team for 1912, the opportunities for
a victory over California are hopeful,
but none too bright. The strength of
the Cardinal lies in the number of
men who were undeveloped last sea
son, and in the new men. Several cer
tain point winners were unable to com
pete in the last meet for various rea
sons. either through injuries or in
eligibility. "Dad" Moulton is sanguine
of the ability of the Stanford athletes
to make a winning team and from the
past showing of his charges is certain
of a victory on track and field next
spring.
In the dashes, Stanford will be es
pecially strong. Captain T. L. Cole
man, '12, was the winner of the sprints
for two seasons past, and was only
kepi from making a clean sweep last
year by an eleventh hour injury.
McKee, the 1914 sprinter who cap
tured first in the 220 yard dash and
third in the century, should again an
nex points in his events. If Campbell.
'K'>, is entered in the shorter distances,
prospects for an addition to the Stan
ford total are almost certain.
Good Men in Quarter.
Once more the quarter mile dash
will present a strong list of Cardinal
