# PROSPECTS FOR WINNING IN CREW AND TRACK GOOD
## New and Undeveloped Material Strengthens Cardinal Teams and Repairs Losses Occurring Recently. 
### 
Stanford and California have met on
the water in intercollegiate regattas
seven times. In four of these races
the Cardinal has been returned the
winner. For the past three years
Stanford has not been defeated. The
1912 regatta should not result in a
break in this string of wins. Six vet
erans of last spring's eight are regis
tered in the University and a seventh
will be back next semester. In ad
dition to the rowers, F. L. Gnerena,
'11, coxswain, is also in college and
eligible for next year's crew.
The same system of coaching that
has been in vogue since the reestab
lishment of boating on an intercol
legiate basis will be used next semes
ter. The men who will assist Captain
R. 11. Seward, '12, in instructing his
candidates in the water art will be
chosen early in January. Light fall
training has been indulged in for some
time.
Few of the Varsity men, however,,
have been working out, since the early
training has been intended especially
for the Freshmen. By teaching the
new men the minor details necessary
for ail oarsman to know, and by get
ting the aspirants for crew honors
into fair condition at this time, much
valuable work will be saved next
spring. This is the first time fall
training has been tried at Stanford,
and the results are sure to be very
beneficial. Early next year the actual
work on the water will be undertaken.
Many of the Varsity men have been
out for football and so will have little
difficulty in getting into excellent
shape early in the season. Part of the
training will be done on Lake Lagun
ita, which will be filled about the time
college opens in January. The heavier
rowing will have the estuary at Red
wood as the scene of action.
Four Shells For Crews.
The Stanford crews will have four
boats in which to work on the water.
Two of these are eight oared shells
and the fourth has seat-! for a quartet
of rowers. The new shell purchased
from Sim, the boat builder of Putney.
England, who fashions the craft for
Cambridge and Oxford, will be used by
the first Varsity.
The veteran oarsmen who are regis
tered and are eligible for the 1012
crews are: Captain Seward. K. L.

With a nucleus of six point win
ners of last year's team, and seven
men who have previously scored
points in an intercollegiate meet,
around which to build a winning track
team for 1912, the opportunities for
a victory over California are hopeful,
but none too bright. The strength of
the Cardinal lies in the number of
men who were undeveloped last sea
son, and in the new men. Several cer
tain point winners were unable to com
pete in the last meet for various rea
sons. either through injuries or in
eligibility. "Dad" Moulton is sanguine
of the ability of the Stanford athletes
to make a winning team and from the
past showing of his charges is certain
of a victory on track and field next
spring.
In the dashes, Stanford will be es
pecially strong. Captain T. L. Cole
man, '12, was the winner of the sprints
for two seasons past, and was only
kepi from making a clean sweep last
year by an eleventh hour injury.
McKee, the 1914 sprinter who cap
tured first in the 220 yard dash and
third in the century, should again an
nex points in his events. If Campbell.
'K'>, is entered in the shorter distances,
prospects for an addition to the Stan
ford total are almost certain.
Good Men in Quarter.
Once more the quarter mile dash
will present a strong list of Cardinal
entries. C. C. Taylor, '11, and J. H.
Leman, '13, ran a dead heat for first
place last year. The former is again
eligible, and the latter may re-enter
the University at Christmas. W. Daw
son, '14, and R. E. Millsap, "12, will
also be relied on to capture points in
this race.
In the loss of T. M. Cramer, '11, who
took second in record time last spring,
and who was numbered among the
most likely winners in 1912, Stanford
will be compelled to develop new men
for the half mile. F. K. McClure, the
speedy Freshman 440-yard runner, will
probably be ranked high in this event
as well as in the mile. F. .T. (lard, '14,
must also be reckoned as a strong con
tender in the half. The mile and two
mile races are weak spots for the Car
dinal. California has record holders
in both events. In the former, L. II.
Price, '13, who was second in this
event in 1910 and who was ineligible
