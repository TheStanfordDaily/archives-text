The Christmas number of the Chap
an al is scheduled to appear next Wed
nesday morning, and will be the last
issue of this semester. The edition as
a whole is an exceptional one, hut the
art department in particular has some
of the finest drawings that the paper
has ever received. Editor L. D. Sum
inerfield, '12, stated that the cuts are
the best he has printed this semester.
In addition to the art, the other de
partments of the paper are especially
good in this number.
What is regarded as the best draw
ing in the issue is a pen and ink
sketch by W. R. Davenport, '02, en
titled, "A Hit of Christmas Fiction."
The sketch is a wonderful piece of
drawing, coming from a man who is
an expert at this kind of work. A
letter is printed along with the cut.
Full Page Drawing.
The first full page drawing is by
Miss M. Bailey, '14, with the title,
"The Coming Event and the Shadow."
It is semi-humorous in character. Art
editor A. T. King, '12, is responsible
for a very amusing full page sketch.
"For What We are About to Receive,
Oh Lord, May We be Truly Thank
ful." It has a special significance for
this time of year.
Miss Hazel Clark. '15, has succeeded
in combining a pretty girl's head, a
wreath of holly, and a bunch of mis
tleloe in a very effective manner. The
work is done in charcoal and wash
and is given a full page half tone in
the paper. A half page cut by
G. C. Smith, '10, called "The Prodigal
Frosh," pictures the home coming of
the freshman in a very comical way.
