There is more or less criticism now
adays among llie students of the policy
of the Trustees in building up the
church before the gymnasium is re
paired and in use. To us that seems

the very height of what
would be called looking
at the dollars and cents

side of things. Why not take the one
hundred thousand dollars allotted each
year for the reconstruction of the
"Minster" and erect a fully-equipped
concrete Stadium to compete with
Harvard and other Universities. There
is little enough of sentiment of rever
ence and gratefulness, ordinarily, in
a new university, but this expressed
preference for a gymnasium rather
than a church, is, we believe, very
close to the limit.
We do not believe there is a ma
jority of the students who want the
gymnasium rather than the church,
nor even many who want the gym
nasium before the new Library. When
it eoir.es to a matter of building one
or the other of these structures, the
characters of which are at opposite
extremes from each other, there are
bound to be conflicting opinions. It
is only a matter of a few years before
all the wrecked buildings will be re
built—probably before 1915. Why not
then look at the broader idea of re
construction, and the outcome of plans
in the long run, especially when the
long run is only a few years away.
