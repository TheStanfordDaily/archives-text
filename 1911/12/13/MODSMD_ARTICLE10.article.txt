In rolling the "copy-paper" over the
typewriter platen for the last editorial
of the semester, we cannot say that

we are sorry to be
through with the work.
It has been pleasant

from several standpoints—not the
least being that the average student,
and the outsider, even, appreciates the
effort and constant application that is
required to edit the college paper and
at the same time to carry on a side
line known as "college work." Prob
ably there is no one who would re
gret having had the varied experi
ences that go with the editor's duty.
We do not.
One of the most stimulating and
gratifying things we know of in con
nection with the paper has been the
knowledge that A group of men. will
ing and unselfish, lias been "behind"
us at every turn in the road —the
group of men who make up the staff
(not to mention the women). Words
as well as gifts that could be made
are worthless in thanking them. The
service they give is of the finer sort
and they give it freely. We believe
that the majority of the readers of the
university daily appreciate what those
men are doing.
The present volume of the Daily
Palo Alto ends with the present issue.
The paper will appear in January at
the opening of the second semester
under the editorship of Cyril Raymond
Nunan, of Stockton, to whom we wish
good lurk. Moreover, We Need the
Union.
