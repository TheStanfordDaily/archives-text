Red Cross Christmas stamps have
been placed on sale, under the aus
pices of the Social Service Club, at
the Bookstore and in the various
houses.
Three-fourths of the money obtain
ed from their sale is used in this
country for the care and prevention of
tuberculosis. The rest of the receipts
are divided equally between the State
and National Red Cross Societies for
the furtherance of this work.
Last year a free clinic, was started
in San Jose on one thousand dollars,
received from the sale of stamps in
this country.
