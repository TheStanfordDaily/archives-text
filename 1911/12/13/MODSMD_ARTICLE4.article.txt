# INDICATIONS POINT TO A WINNING VARSITY
## ALL BUT THREE VETERANS WILL BE BACK IN 1912. Victory Next Year Will Bring Delayed Emits of Great Presley Regime. 
### 
Every man that played on the Var
sity this season will be back next fall,
with the exception of three veterans
who are taken by the five-year limit
from the rugby fold. As to the sub
stitutes, the same situation holds
good. The scrum loses two men
whose services have been invaluable
to the Cardinal. These are Dole and
Woodcock, both being retired by the
five year rule.
Dole has been one of the most
powerfully efficient scrum giants that
have ever played at Stanford, having
been captain in his fourth year, and in
fifth keeping his post at middle rank
without a peer at. this position in the
new world. Woodcock won his spurs
for the first time this year on the Var
sity, and played his front rank place
at par.
Racliticld Loses Brown.
The backfield loses one of the
greatest fullbacks that ever booted the
English pigskin, and in him the Car
dinal loses a man who probably can
not be replaced during the present
college generation. He has rendered
invaluable services to the Stanford
rugby cohorts. The rest of the line
up remains intact.
A. Sanborn and W. L. Smith return
to fill the premier scrum rank. Part
ridge will be back for the middle
rank. Frank, Card and Schaupp will
Ite ready to fill the back rank trio of
places. Captain-elect Cass will skip
per from half. Harrigan and Noble
will be in togs next fall. Kern is
another sure returner. Geissler will
be absent next semester but will reg
ister again next fall. Erb will be
back to round out his versatile career
o'i the sod. Along with these return
ing veterans will come the peerless S.
Mitchell to wear the Cardinal on the
gridiron once more. Never has a
steadier player handled the leather
oval on the Pacific Coast. Risling
will return a Sophomore ready to
play any position along the bnckline
Formidable Array of Substitutes.
As to the substitutes, Haley, Wat
kins. and Boulware will be on deck
ready not only to fill the two vacan
cies in the forward division, but also
to make the veterans of this year's
Varsity look out for their laurels on
the turf next fall. Worswick and Til
ton are coming back. Reeves and
Templeton are returning. Both of
these men are Varsity calibre, the
former having made his letter in
1910.
The prospects for next yrar need no
commentary. They chronicle the out
look by themselves. One needs no
Cardinal colored optics to read the
forecast of thp rugby results of next
November's intercollegiate contest.
Such an array of returning gridiron
stars has seldom been recorded.
These ar 1 the heritages of the Pres
lev regime. A Cardinal victory next
p nll will bring the delayed but well
earned laurels to the coach that has

served Stanford so well for four
years.
