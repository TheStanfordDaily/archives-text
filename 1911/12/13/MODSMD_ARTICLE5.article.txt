# STANFORD SHOULD HAVE VICTORIOUS BALL TEAM
## LONG LIST OF CANDIDATES FOR EVERY PLACE. Three or Four Men Will Contest for Every Position.â€”Will be Taught Inside Ball. 
### 
Prospects for a winning baseball
team were never brighter at Stanford
than they are for next semester.
Seven regular members of the 1911
Varsity will register in college for
the spring term and all these men
have signified their intention of mak
ing a bid for their old place on the
team. In addition to these men two
of the substitutes on last year's team
will be eligible to compete. Prob
ably the brightest prospects, however,
lie in the new men who have regis
tered in college this year. The Fresh
men present an unusual array of base
ball talent. Numerous men of the 191")
class have shown unusual promise of
becoming Varsity material.
It seems probable, according to the
present outlook, that there will he
three or four excellent men contest
ing for every position on the team.
Fall practise brought out the majority
of these novices on the Cardinal dia
mond, but several dark horses with
unusually good preparatory school
records, who did no work this fall,
have signified their intention of trying
for positions on the team in the
spring.
In the past, according to those who
are on the inside of baseball at Stan
ford. the chief fault of all the Car
dinal teams has been the difficulty of
securing a good battery. Tf the catcher
has been good the pitcher has not
been up to standard, and if the pitch


Rasebull Captain Gillillun
er showed big league form the catcher i
could not hold him. This will not be '
the case this year, however. In both '
of these most essential positions it is '
certain that Stanford will have prac- i
tical 1> as strong men as ever repre
sented the Cardinal on the diamond, j
Inside Baseball Taught.
This year the team will be coached
to the exclusion of almost everything j
else in inside baseball and team work.
Nothing was so evident in the 1911
series as the lack of knowledge of j
these fundamentals by the team. J.
1). Peters, '11, late of the Athletics,'
who has been assisting Captain S. YV.
Gilfillan, '12, in the fall work believes
that this portion of the game should
be especially emphasized next spring.
Of pitchers there will be more than j
enough. The coach and captain will |
bo able to pick bis twirling staff from
the following field. M. F. Enderle,
'12, 15 P. Van Dyke, '12, both substl- j
tuies on the 15)11 Varsity; C. B. Bar-j
nett, '14, T. B. Tompkins, '15, A. .1. ,
Howe, '15, and J. Couch who will en
ter from Manzanita school at Christ-1
mas. All of these men have enviable j
high school reputations.
\ catcher must be developed from
among three men who have signified
tlici:' intention of trying out for the i
position. M. A. Donovan '12, outfield-j
er on the 1911 Varsity; M. B. Hen-I
shaw, '12: also an outfielder on the
same team, and F. A. Scofield, '12.
All of these men are players of un
usual ability although none of them
have ever worn a catcher's mask in
an intercolleejiate game.,
Many Excellent In fielders.
For first base, Captain S. W. Gil
flllan, '12, M. Obear, '12, center field
er on the 1910 team, and M. 15. I-len
shaw '12, will be the contesting play
ers. Gilfillan has decided not to pitch
this year, but to play at first, his
logical position..
At s?cond and third, many men of
unusual ability will try for places
Thr\y are, L. Cass, '13, who filled the
second base berth on the 1911 Var
n'tv; W. M. Argabrlte, '13, R. McNeely,
'13, P. M. McCloskey, '15, and G. W.
Reed, '15. At short, Z. A. Terry '14,
is a fixture.
Outfielders will probably be chosen
from among the following men: R. M.
Noble, '12, H. A. Beeger, '13, right
fielder on the 1911 team; L. Childs.
'13. who played on both the 1910 and
1911 Varsities; A. Hagerman, '13, and
" T . Obear, '12, who will try to again
f'il his pes'tion in the center field
garden.

Outfielders will probably be chosen

Seven regular members of the 1911
Varsity will register in college for
the spring term and all these men
have signified their intention of mak

of the substitutes on last year's team
will be eligible to compete. Prob
ably the brightest prospects, however,
lie in the new men who have regis
tered in college this year. The Fresh
men present an unusual array of base
ball talent. Numerous men of the 191")
class have shown unusual promise of
becoming Varsity material.
It seems probable, according to the
present outlook, that there will he
three or four excellent men contest
ing for every position on the team.
Fall practise brought out the majority
of these novices on the Cardinal dia

unusually good preparatory school

In the past, according to those who
are on the inside of baseball at Stan
ford. the chief fault of all the Car
dinal teams has been the difficulty of
securing a good battery. Tf the catcher
has been good the pitcher has not
been up to standard, and if the pitch

could not hold him. This will not be '
the case this year, however. In both '
