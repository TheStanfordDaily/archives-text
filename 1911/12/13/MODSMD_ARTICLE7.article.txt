# MEMORIAL CHURCH WILL BE EARTHQUAKE PROOF
## CONSTRUCTION WILL BE BEST THAT IS KNOWN. Walls to be Bound Together in Practically Solid Unit.-Reinforced Concrete Used. 
### 
That the Memorial Church, when
completed, will be as near earthquake
proof ass it is possible to build a struc
ture, is the gist of the advices re
ceived today from Ward & Blohme, the
San Fransico architects who have
had charge of preparing the plans for
the rebuilding. For tliree years this
firm has been occupied in the com
pletion of the huge mass of plans and
details covering the reconstruction.
Sheet alter sheet of blue prints have
been prepared by the firm, covering
every possible feature of the structure.
it has been the aim of the architects
to use every known engineering fact
in construction which would insure
an absolutely earthquake building.
It is the firm belief of the men who
have prepared the plans that if after
the completion of the Church another
earthquake should strike the Univer
sity that the Chapel would be the
last building to be affected, no matter
how violent the shock.
In the building before the earth
quake, the construction depended en
tirely for its security upon a light
cement bond which connected the
various portions of the walls. Tn this
original plan an interior and exterior
wall of sandstone were put up, and
between these stability was secured
by laying a solid core of ordinary
brick. The result was that the wall
was in practically three sections, con
nected only by the bond of cement
filler spoken of above. When the
earthquake struck the building the
strain was altogether too great for
this bond. It tore lojse, wrecking the
supports for the roof, which fell
through the building and blew out the
ends through the force of the air
pressure. Large portions of the side
walls also fell.
Steel to Hind Walls Together.
Under the new plan of construction
as worked out by Ward & Blohme, the
central idea of the old building will
he retained. That is the two walls
forming the shell will be put up from
the sandstone bocks. These stones
will be run up to scaffold height and
will be securely hound together by
moaiis o! steel reinforcing rods, which
will run both horizontally and verti
cally. These in turn will lie made
fast by anchors buried in the earth
and the walls of the building, bind
ing the whole together.
Between this shell of sandstone,
with the metal reinforcing, concrete
will be poured, completely filling the
space between the two outside walls.
When this has been alowed to set.
the resulting wall will he a solid un
i leakable mass of concrete, steel, and
'tone, bound together so intricately
and securely that no amount of shak
ing or displacement can wreck it.
instead of being a wall composed of
thousands of separate units of brick
and stone it will be practically a sin
gle unit.
Form of Tower Ktil! Uncertain.
The plans have been prepared so
that almost any kind of a tower can
be placed on the structure. The Board
of Trustees of the University have
come to no definite decision as yet as
to whether the olrl tower will be re
built or a new one put on. Tn either
case the plans have been prepared so
that the building will bold the tower
safely.

by laying a solid core of ordinary
brick. The result was that the wall
was in practically three sections, con
nected only by the bond of cement
filler spoken of above. When the
earthquake struck the building the
strain was altogether too great for
this bond. It tore lojse, wrecking the
supports for the roof, which fell
through the building and blew out the
ends through the force of the air
pressure. Large portions of the side
walls also fell.
Steel to Hind Walls Together.
Under the new plan of construction
as worked out by Ward & Blohme, the
central idea of the old building will
he retained. That is the two walls
forming the shell will be put up from
the sandstone bocks. These stones
will be run up to scaffold height and
will be securely hound together by
moaiis o! steel reinforcing rods, which
will run both horizontally and verti
cally. These in turn will lie made
fast by anchors buried in the earth
and the walls of the building, bind
ing the whole together.
Between this shell of sandstone,
with the metal reinforcing, concrete
will be poured, completely filling the
space between the two outside walls.
When this has been alowed to set.
the resulting wall will he a solid un
i leakable mass of concrete, steel, and
'tone, bound together so intricately
and securely that no amount of shak
ing or displacement can wreck it.
instead of being a wall composed of
thousands of separate units of brick
and stone it will be practically a sin
gle unit.
Form of Tower Ktil! Uncertain.
The plans have been prepared so
that almost any kind of a tower can
be placed on the structure. The Board
of Trustees of the University have
come to no definite decision as yet as
to whether the olrl tower will be re
built or a new one put on. Tn either
case the plans have been prepared so
that the building will bold the tower
safely.
That the Memorial Church, when
completed, will be as near earthquake
proof ass it is possible to build a struc
ture, is the gist of the advices re
ceived today from Ward & Blohme, the
San Fransico architects who have
had charge of preparing the plans for
the rebuilding. For tliree years this
firm has been occupied in the com
pletion of the huge mass of plans and
details covering the reconstruction.
Sheet alter sheet of blue prints have
been prepared by the firm, covering
every possible feature of the structure.
it has been the aim of the architects
to use every known engineering fact
in construction which would insure
an absolutely earthquake building.
It is the firm belief of the men who
have prepared the plans that if after
the completion of the Church another
earthquake should strike the Univer
sity that the Chapel would be the
last building to be affected, no matter
how violent the shock.
In the building before the earth
quake, the construction depended en
tirely for its security upon a light
cement bond which connected the
various portions of the walls. Tn this
original plan an interior and exterior
wall of sandstone were put up, and
between these stability was secured
by laying a solid core of ordinary
brick. The result was that the wall
was in practically three sections, con
nected only by the bond of cement
filler spoken of above. When the
earthquake struck the building the
strain was altogether too great for
this bond. It tore lojse, wrecking the
supports for the roof, which fell

ends through the force of the air
