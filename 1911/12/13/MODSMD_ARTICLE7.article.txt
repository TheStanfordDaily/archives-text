# MEMORIAL CHURCH WILL BE EARTHQUAKE PROOF
## CONSTRUCTION WILL BE BEST THAT IS KNOWN. Walls to be Bound Together in Practically Solid Unit.-Reinforced Concrete Used.

That the Memorial Church, when
completed, will be as near earthquake
proof ass it is possible to build a struc
ture, is the gist of the advices re
ceived today from Ward & Blohme, the
San Fransico architects who have
had charge of preparing the plans for
the rebuilding. For tliree years this
firm has been occupied in the com
pletion of the huge mass of plans and
details covering the reconstruction.
Sheet alter sheet of blue prints have
been prepared by the firm, covering
every possible feature of the structure.
it has been the aim of the architects
to use every known engineering fact
in construction which would insure
an absolutely earthquake building.
It is the firm belief of the men who
have prepared the plans that if after
the completion of the Church another
earthquake should strike the Univer
sity that the Chapel would be the
last building to be affected, no matter
how violent the shock.
In the building before the earth
quake, the construction depended en
tirely for its security upon a light
cement bond which connected the
various portions of the walls. Tn this
original plan an interior and exterior
wall of sandstone were put up, and
between these stability was secured
by laying a solid core of ordinary
brick. The result was that the wall
was in practically three sections, con

filler spoken of above. When the
earthquake struck the building the
