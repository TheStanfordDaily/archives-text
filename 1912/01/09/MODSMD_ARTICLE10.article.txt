# A 						Task.
## 
### 
We of this present generation of the
Daily Palo Alto have a task before
us in issuing a paper as good

as Volume I. If we can equai
the standard set in the past we
will be satisfied; if we can im-

prove upon the paper in any way, that
improvement will more than repay
us for all the time and labor spent in
effecting it.
For our policy during the coming
few months we can only say that we
will work honestly and with a light
heart in any cause which will advance
the best interests of Stanford.
