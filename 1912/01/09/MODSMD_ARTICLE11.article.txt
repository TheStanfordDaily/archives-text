There may be some perfectly gooii
reason for requiring the filing or

study-cards on registration
day, but from our side of the
fence it seems a trifle incon-

siderate. Few underclassmen know
exactly what courses they wish to take
and with the present inadequate sys
tem of conferences with major depart
ment professors, the luckless fresh
man or sophmore is often at his wits
end in finding suitable courses.
