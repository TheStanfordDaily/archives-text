with a footway like the football
And track seats. Entrances every
sixty feet provide ample means of ac
cess to the stands.

for about two thousand spectators..
The seats in back of the plate will be
protected by a wire screen which will
serve to stop foul balls.
Standing room sections will prob
ably be built at each end of the stands

tically finished and is in excellent
shape. The recent heavy rains had
no effect whatever on the surface of
the infield. The water drained through
the loam and out through the crushed
rock foundation, leaving the field un
impaired. All that is necessary tt,
put the diamond in shape for practise
is to roll it and place the plate and
sacks in position. The outfield is
practically as level as I he infield.

ball field has received its share of
attention. New take-offs and run
ways have been made for the jumps

ones. With these two sets the athletes
will not be at the mercy of the wind
but will be able to have the wind at
their backs. Shelter tents have been
constructed to place over the take-offs
as rain protectors.
A large crew of men is engaged on
the fields and the work will be finished
