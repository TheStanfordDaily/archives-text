## Hard Fighting Team Loses Three Games in which the Contending Forwards Are the Chief Figures.

Without a single victory to theii
credit, hut with that feo"i;i i? o' satis
faction which co:ne3 from having
struggled hard a >ai ist adverse cir
cumstances, the S'anford rugby men
have returned frc m their northern
trip. Lack of practice as a team; un

Sorhl {'unctions. ,
"Royally e tortni led every miaul
is the way in which the Stanford i 1-
vadera de cri'ie their stay i:i Van

couver and vicinity. The Cardinal
rugby men were guests of honor at
many linners and dunces. A big bah
and a boat ride were especially en
joyed .y the southerners.
The Hrst Two Gaines.
The scores in the three games of
the se-ies were 1S-S, G-3, and S-3. At
<!:«' time of the first encounter a re
cent s.iowfall was thawing and covet
ed the field with slush. The first try
i:i this game, made by Stanford, came
as a lesult of some of the snappiest
rugby seen during the series. Nearly
every member of the Stanford team,
forward and back, handled the bah
duriu : a beautiful passing rush. No
ble went over for the try.
Fighting as hard or harder than
that teen in the Stanford-California
match marked the second game. Van
couver's winning score came as tht
result of a penalty kick.
A Forward Battle.
The same determined work on the
part of the Cardinal players was evi
denced in the third game. For most of
the contest Stanford kept the home
team on the defensive and territorially
had the better of tiie argument. In
spite of this the stone wall of the
r'ar held, and the Stanford team
could iot attain the one notch of speeu
and effort necessary to a score. In
this, is in both of the other contests
the Vancouver forwards deserved the
lion's share of the credit for victory.
As a matter of fact all the battles
were largely between the forwards, in
pack work and in the loose, and here
Stanford found herself outplayed.
In this game the principal shift in
the lineup, ordered by Captain Erb at
any time, was made. Cass was switch
ed to wing, Til ton taking his berth at
half. This proved a strong defensive
arrangement.
The I.ns( (Jsimc.
The first try in this game came after
a sensational dribble by Leggatt and
Gray of the Vancouver team, covering
more than half the length of the field,
lust before this Stanford came close
to a score when a penalty shot at goal
was awarded, but Erb failed.
Stanford's own score came also by
the dribbing route, the rush starting
near midfield. Tenipleton was the
man to take the ball over. Erb barely
missed a difficult conversion.
A rush in the forward division,
followed by passing by the three-

quarters, gave Vancouver the deciding
try. After some fighting McLorU
found touch at the goal line. On the
throw-in he received and sprinted over.
Thomas converted.
For the rest of the half Stanford
was again 011 the aggressive, bui
could not negotiate a try. Once again
opportunity knocked when the foi
wards hroke away with a dribble after
Sweeney had missed a punt. A clear
field was ahead of them, but about
twenty yards from the line they over
ran the ball and Vancouver booted li
into touch.
The second half was scoreless. IHu
ing tliis period A. Erb received a kick
and was forced to retire badly dazed.
For the rest of the game Stanford
played with fourteen men. This game,
was played with air tingling with cold
and 011 a frozen field.
Stanford Played Well.
Everything considered, the Stanford
men played as well throughout tlio
t lies as could have been expected.
Since they played under difficult cir
cumstances, against strong opponents,
and with a team which had never
v/ork'(I together before and did not
represent Stanford's full rugby
I rength, a victory could hardly have
!i"oi anticipated. Several particular
i!. appeared, among them Noble,
< ;tptain Erb, and Schaupp. Temple
t m and others also played brilliantly,
• '>d, in fact, every member of the
tram gave a good account of himself.
The squad making the northern trip
included Corbet, Taylor, J. Harrigan,
Ulv, Woodcock, Hall, Whitaker, Wat
kins, Haley, Boulware, Darsie, Part
ridge. Schaupp forwards; Cass, Tilton,
Risling, A. Erb, Noble, Sim, Temple
tou, Kern, B. Erb backs.
