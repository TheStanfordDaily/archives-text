rugby men were guests of honor at
many linners and dunces. A big bah
and a boat ride were especially en
joyed .y the southerners.
The Hrst Two Gaines.
The scores in the three games of
the se-ies were 1S-S, G-3, and S-3. At
<!:«' time of the first encounter a re
cent s.iowfall was thawing and covet
ed the field with slush. The first try
i:i this game, made by Stanford, came
as a lesult of some of the snappiest
rugby seen during the series. Nearly
every member of the Stanford team,
forward and back, handled the bah
duriu : a beautiful passing rush. No
ble went over for the try.
Fighting as hard or harder than
that teen in the Stanford-California
match marked the second game. Van
couver's winning score came as tht
result of a penalty kick.
A Forward Battle.
The same determined work on the
part of the Cardinal players was evi
denced in the third game. For most of
the contest Stanford kept the home
team on the defensive and territorially
had the better of tiie argument. In
spite of this the stone wall of the
r'ar held, and the Stanford team
could iot attain the one notch of speeu
and effort necessary to a score. In
this, is in both of the other contests
the Vancouver forwards deserved the
lion's share of the credit for victory.
As a matter of fact all the battles
were largely between the forwards, in
pack work and in the loose, and here
Stanford found herself outplayed.
In this game the principal shift in
the lineup, ordered by Captain Erb at
any time, was made. Cass was switch
ed to wing, Til ton taking his berth at
half. This proved a strong defensive
arrangement.

The first try in this game came after
a sensational dribble by Leggatt and
Gray of the Vancouver team, covering
more than half the length of the field,
lust before this Stanford came close
to a score when a penalty shot at goal
was awarded, but Erb failed.
Stanford's own score came also by
the dribbing route, the rush starting
near midfield. Tenipleton was the
man to take the ball over. Erb barely
missed a difficult conversion.
