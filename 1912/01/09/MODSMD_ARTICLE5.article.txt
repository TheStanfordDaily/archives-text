The Masquers will present "ThÂ«
Admirable Crichton" on the ninth of
February instead of on the eighth as
was announced by the posters this
morning.
The parts have already been learned

Taking into consideration the facts
that most of the parts are to be taken
by experienced thespians and that
such an early start has been made,
