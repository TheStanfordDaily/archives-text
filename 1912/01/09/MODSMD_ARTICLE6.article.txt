# STANFORD MEN HOLD BIG ENGINEERING JOBS
## STUDENT RETURNS FROM NORTH WITH FINE REPORT. C.A. Vrang. '13, Has Interesting Experiences in Alaska.â€”Walks 300 Miles to Railroad. 
### 
Seven Stanford graduates, in the de
partments of Engineering, are at tho
present time prominently identified
with mining interests in Alaska, ac
cording to the report of C. M. Vrant,
'13, who has just returned from a half
year's stay in the northern territory.
These men are C. A. Thomas, '93, resi
dent manager for the Yukon Gold
company; A. E. Austin, '9!), superin
tendent; 1). 11. Ferry, 'OS, superinten
dent of drills; H. Perring, '01, assist
ant superintendent of dredges; G. Ccs
tar, head draughtsman; E. G. McCann,
'10, foreman; and H. O. McNaught, '05,
engineer.
These men were all employed by
the Yukon Gold company, one of tht,
largest operating concerns in Alaska.
The headquarters of the company are
at Dawson. According to Vrang, oihe\
engineers from Stanford are employed
in the territory. They invariably hold
responsible positions.
The company by which these men
are employed does all its work by
means of dredges. It is one of the
largest concerns of this kind in the
world. The dredges can only be oper
ated during about eight or nine months
of the year as the streams and lakes
freeze over so heavily in mid-winter
that no work can lie done.
Vrang, who was in the employ of
the company for about three months,
left them to spend two months mort.
in the wilds of the interior, hunting
and fishing. About the first of Decem
ber he decided to return to Stanford.
At this time he was three hundred
miles from the nearest railroad. The
days were only four hours long, and
the thermometer registered fifty de
grees below zero. Alone, Vrang began
to "mush" it out to the railroad.
It was toward the famous White
Pass, of Klondike days, that he head
ed. Here in the gold rush of '98 ana
'99 hundreds of men lost their lives in
attempting to reach the vicinity of
Dawson. Vrang traveled the three hun
dred miles on foot in a little less
than two weeks. This was about
twenty-one miles a day.
Although the snow on the Pass wa*
almost fifteen feet deep, the railroad
still ran two trains per week between
White Pass and Skagway, its southern
terminus. Although thpse trains are
light and the engines very powerful,
it required a snowplow assisted by six
engines to buck the enormous drifts
that banked the track.
Vrang had no particular adventure
in coming out, with the exception of
the natural difficulties accompanying
such a trip under such weather con
ditions.
"Such a trip," he said, "means no
thing to an Alaskan. People up there
are taking them all tlie time. It is
the only way one can get over a large
portion of the country."
He broucht back with him wonder
ful tales of hunting and fishing. Game
of all kinds are plentiful up there, ac
cording to his reports. Bear, numer
