# TRACK MEN WILL SOON BEGIN ACTIVE WORK
## NEW MEN MUST BE DEVELOPED FOR MANY VACANCIES. Failure of Athletes to Register and Ineligibility Places Difficult Task Before "Dad." 
### 
With the failure of several of the
most promising trackmen to return to
the University and the ineligibility ol
others, "Dad" Moulton is confronted
with an extremely difficult task in
developing a winning cinder path com
bination to meet California this spring.
Many new men must be found to fill
the vacancies in almost every event.
In the sprints, Stanford is assured
of a goodly proportion of the points
with Captain T. L. Coleman, '12, win
ner of firstjjlace in both the hundred
and two-twenty yard dashes in thu
1909 ami 491ft meets and P. B. McKee,
'14, who to<& first in the furlong and
third in theifehojjer race last sprint,
as the principal contenders. E. P.
Campbell, '13, may be entered in thes; 5
races, but his star event will be the
hurdles, where he is expected to make
a considerable impression on the score
column. Campbell is an all-around
athlete on the track and can do the
quarter mile in remarkably fast time.
C. C. Taylor, '11, who has won his
letter in previous meets and who has
been a representative of the Cardinal
in several eastern meets, will again
don his spikes. R. E. Millsap, '12,
uud B. Wallace, '12, are two members,
of the varsity squad who should give
a good account of themselves in the
four-forty. W. Dawson, '14, was class
ed among the fastest quarter and re
lay men but he did not return to col
lege.
Weak in Distance Kuns.
F. L. Card. '14, is looked upon as a
comer in the half mile. \\ ith the non
return of Cramer, the Cardinal suffer
ed the loss of a certain winner in this
event, and Card will be the main hope
against the Californians. The longei
races are the weakest spots for the
Cardinal. L. H. Price, '13, second
point man in the 1910 meet, is the
most likely runner in the mile. C. L.
Moore, '12, who was looked upon as a
promising candidate last fall did not
return to the University. W. J.
Dodge, '13, and G. Bevier, '11, should
