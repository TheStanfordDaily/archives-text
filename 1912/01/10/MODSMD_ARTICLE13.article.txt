# Painless Surgery.
## 
### 
A painless method of extracting stu
dent body dues from reluctant under

graduates has apparently
become a necessity. When
the Graduate Manager an
nounces a drop of ovei

three hundred in the number of per
sons paying dues and buying season
tickets it is surely time to seek some
such heroic remedy.
At the end of the registration period
last semester, some nine hundred per
sons had paid their assessments and
purchased season tickets. This year,
however, only 541 season tickets have
been sold, and these mostly to uppei
classmem.
Since the passage of the amend
ment at the last student body election,
no person is qualified to hold office,
play on a varsity team or act for the
student body in any capacity what
ever, who has not paid the regular
fees.
Only a very small portion of those
who have paid their dues are mem
bers of the two lower classes. Evi
dently 1914 and 1915 do not intend
to take an active part in the Univer
sity during the coming season.
