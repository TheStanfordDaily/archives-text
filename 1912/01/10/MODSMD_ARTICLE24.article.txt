# Work on Church Floor Delayed.
## 
### 
The lack of electrical power for the
cement mixer has delayed work on
the concrete floor of the Memorial
Church for some days past, and it is
not thought likely that the necessary
juice will be obtained before next
week.
The wooden forms for the concrete
have been putin, and unless the
weather takes a hand in the game, the
.work will be finished in a short tine.
The steel reinforcing rods have been
set in the foundation on either side of
the main entrance and the actual re
building of the walls will be started
this month.
