# FRESHMEN WILL TENDER DINNER TO PRESIDENT
## JANUARY 19 IS DATE ARRANGED FOR THE AFFAIR. Time Chosen Will Be President's Sixty-First Birthday.—Tickets On Sale Soon. 
### 
Owing to the fact that Dr. Jordan
was away from the campus at the time
of the usual reception to the Fresli
' man class, the Freshmen will this
| semester reverse matters by tender
! ing an informal dinner to the Presi
| dent on his return to the University.
It is planned to give this dinner on the
evening of Friday, January 19. My
choosing this date a double purpose
will be served. Not only will the af
fair be a welcome to the President on
his return but it will also be an es
! pecially appropriate date as it is his
■ sixty-first birthday.
According to those in charge of the
! affair its success or failure rents al
most entirely with the Freshman class.
To make the dinner a truly representa
tive one it will be necessary, say tin.
co nmittee, for every Freshman in the
University to lie present for the even
ing.
The committee, in choosing this
| date for the dinner, believe that they
; have secured a time which will b*.
convenient for securing the largest
attendance for the evening. The sem
ester will not be fully enough under
! way at this time so that either activi
! ties or studies will interfere with those
| who desire to attend the dinner.
Absolute informality will be the
keynote of the evening. In this re
gard the dinner will not be essentially
different from the one given to Dr.
Jordan last semester on the occasion
of his return from the Orient. The
dinner itself, in its semi-buffet nature,
will make for informality.
The time which has been set ror
tho opening of the affair is 0:30, and
the place is Encina Clubroom. Tick
ets for the dinner will be on sale, be
ginning either tomorrow or Friday
at the Registrar's office, and from the
members of the Committee appointed
to take charge of the affair. This
committee has the following
W. E. Rhinehart, R. R. Tenipleton,
S. S. Simonson, O. A. Hind, and Miss
M. Clark, Miss M Parkinson, Miss E.
Nagel, Miss K. Chandler, and Miss E.
Tal'f.
