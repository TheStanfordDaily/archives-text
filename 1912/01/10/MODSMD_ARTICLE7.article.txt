# BASEBALL PRACTICE TO BEGIN ON MONDAY.
## Captain S.W. Gilfillan, '12, Registered Today, and Lays Plans For Coining Season. 
### 
Baseball Captain S. W. Gilfillan, '12,
registered in the University today.
Although arriving a day late. Captain
Gilfillan has already made plans foi
the coming baseball season and has
issued a call for practice to begin on
Monday afternoon.
At that time light practice will
start under the guidance of Captain
Gilfillan and one or two veterans. The
schedule of games will be announced
later and wil probaby start in a couple
of weeks, weather permitting.
The new field is now completed and
offers a perfect playing surface in
both the infield and outfield. The
stands are nearing completion and will
fi lished before the first game.
"The University fans will be treated
to a higher class of baseball than ha&
ever before been shown here,' said
Captain Gilfillan today. "I base this
assertion on the brand of ball played
during the recent fall practice, which
was every bit as good as that generally
played in the late spring."
Baseball, like foootball, needs sup
port, and with the completion of one
of the best baseball fields on the
coast on our campus, there should lie
no reason why the team should not
have it. The bleachers should be
filled every afternoon, and if this is
done the spectators will be treated to
some extra good baseball."
