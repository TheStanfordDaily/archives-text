# STANFORD MAN TELLS OF CONDITIONS IN CHINA
## PROFESSOR BATEMAN DRIVEN OUT BY REVOLUTION. Speaks of the Terrible State of Population and Talks on Civil Strife. 
### 
W. (J. Bateman, '09, who, until re
cently, has been professor of chemis
try at the Pei Yang University at
Tientsin, China, has returned to the
campus on his way home from China.
He was forced to leave, together with
many other foreigners, 011 account
of the revolution. The natives, ac
cording to Bateman, seemed ver>
anxious for them to leave. He has
no intention of returning in the near
future.
Professor Bateman says that it is
hard for the average American to con
ceive of the terrible condition that
China is in. Famine, war, disease,
and ignorance have all had a share
in undermining and breaking down the
people. One calamity seems to follow
another in rapid succession, keeping
the country in a constant state of un
rest and turmoil.
Speaking of the present revolution,
he said that it had been going 011 for
several months before the outsidb
world heard of it, while it has bee?i
expected every year for the past cen
tury. Owing, however, to the ignor
ance and patience of the Mongolians
the revolution was not brought to a
head until the Manchus aroused them
to action by giving the railroads tr>
the foreigners.
Not Ready For Republic.
Professor Bateman thinks that if a
republic should be established in
China it would hardly improve matters
as the people are very ignorant of
self-government. If an enlightened
despot could be found to rule the
country, Professor Bateman believes
he would give China the best pos
sible government, but as such a man
is not likely to get into power, a limit
ed monarchy will probably be tht
form of government for some time
to come.
