# OARSMEN PREPARE FOR ACTIVE WORK ON WATER
## FOUR VETERANS FOR NUCLEUS OF WINNING EIGHT. Schaupp, Howell, Partridge and Seward Form Coaching Committee.â€”Boats Overhauled. 
### 
With four veterans as a nucleus
around which to build a winning Var
sity eight and many promising candi
dates to fill the vacancies in the Car
dinal boat, Stanford crewmen are pre
paring to enter upon an active train
ing season in order to successfully
meet California on the water next
spring. Beside Captain R. H. Seward,
'12, the Cardinal will have the services
of two rowers who made their "S"
against the Blue and Gold crew in the
1911 intercollegiate race. These men
are R. W. Olmstead, '13, bow, and
R. F. Duryea, '13, who pulled oar num
ber five. .T. F. Partridge, '12, who
stroked the 1910 crew but who was
absent from the University last season
is the other member of the veteran
quartet.
K. L. Scliaupp, '12, and R. It. Hails,
'12, veterans of last season, both of
whom are registered and eligible, will
not be out for the Varsity this year.
Schaupp was counted upon to occupy
a seat in the Stanford boat, but he
has announced his intention not to
row again. Hails decided early last
semester that he would not again be
a "candidate for honors on the crew.
Coaching Committee Appointed.
The same system of coaching will
be employed this season as has been
in vogue since the paid coaches were
abolished. The men who will aid
Captain Seward on the coaching com
mittee are Schaupp, Partridge and
J. W. Howell, '12. The latter was
coxswain on his Freshman eight.
The second year men are expected
to furnish several rowers for the Var
sity eight as many of the candid
dates gave promise of developing into
excellent oarsmen. Of the eight who
composed the 1914 crew, Mitchell,
Wickman, Clover, Adams, Blase, Wat
kins, Hloeser and Ford, the coxswain,
are again registered.
The Freshman class will undoubted
ly furnish many rowers for another
victorious crew. The fall training
which was intended principally for
th 3 new men brought out a wealth of
candidates who should become excel
lent oarsmen. The effect of this early
work should aid considerably in get
ting the aspirants for seats in the
Cardinal shells into condition early
in the season.
S-M'iis Completely Overhauled.
The Stanford navy has been under
going a complete overhauling, and
when the tlotilla is taken from dry
d< ok it will be in the best possible
condition for active work. The new
shell ordered from Putney, England,
has not yet arrived in San Francisco.
