## ALFRED MOSELY TO SPEAK ON "MODERN TENDENCIES." Famous Publicist and Educational Reformer to be Heard Tomorrow Morning at 11:15. 
### 
Alfred Mosely, the distinguished
British publicist, and the man to whom
the government of Great Britain is
indebted for the tremendous advances
recently made in the educational sys
tem of that country, will speak tomor
row morning at the first Assembly of
the year. The subject which he has
chosen for his address is, "Modern
Tendencies." The Assembly will be
held in the 11:15 hour.
The people of the United States
know Mr. Mosely as the organizer of
the industrial and educational com
missions, which visited America in
1902 and 1903 for the purpose of study
ing American educational methods and
systems, and get. new and profitable
ideas to introduce into tlv English
system.
While in South Africa, a little pre
vious to the time of the lloer war, the
work of two American engineers at
tracted his notice as being some of the
lest work completed there, and during
the Boer war another American engin
eer showed himself to be indispensable
at repairing bridges. Mr. Mosely
found these men to be graduates of
American technical schools, and de
cided that in order to turn out such
men the training given here must be
superior to that in Great Britain. Af
ter visiting America alone, he reurned
to England and organized a commis
sion of twenty-five educational experts
to investigate American methods.
Report on American Successes.
Among the causes of American suc
cesses, it was noted by the commis
sion that a great deal more money
was spent on education here than in
England; rich Americans gave more
money to educational institutions than
to sports; the American boy can stay
in school longer and for less money
than in England; more practical sub
jects are taught in the technical
schools here than in any other coun
try; vacations come at the time of the
year when the boys can work in vari
ous lines of endeavor. The report of
the commission showed also some dis
advantages, the chief one being that
not enough men were giving them
selves to teaching or preparation for
teaching.
Committee. Well Received.
Matter.? were made easy for the
commission, wherever its members
went, by the superintendents of the
schools permitting thorough inspec
tions. In this manner relations be
tween educators of both countries
came into closer friendly relations.
In 1906-7 he organized a visit on the
part of several hundred school teach
ers of Great Britain to the United
States and Canada, and the following
year he arranged for the reception of
a thousand teachers from America on
a return visit. Mr. Mosely is now
itudying educational conditions in
California, and the students are for
tu.iate in securin thi; favorable op
portunity to hear him.
