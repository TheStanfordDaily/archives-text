higher standard of general scholar
ship, and a marked iniprove mnet in
the scholarship of fraternity men, are
features of the comparative statistics
for December, 1910, and December,
1911, made public by the Registrar's
office today. These figures show that
(he tola! registration for this semester
has been, to date, 1 ITS, an increase of
just 50 over that of a year ago. Of the
fraternity men in college, the percen
tage that were failed and suspended
at the end of last semester was 12%,
while one year ago 14.0% of the fra
ternity men were among the unfor
tunates. Of non-fraternity men, the
failures were 5.5% and 5.8% respec
tively for the two years. The showing
for the fraternity members is made
even better by the fact that last year
year, when 14.6% of them failed they
numbered 27% of the total registra
tion, while this year with a lower per
centage of failures their proportion
of the total enrollment rises to 32%.
