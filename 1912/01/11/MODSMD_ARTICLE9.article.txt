# Scholar?
## 
### 
The fraternities of Stanford are able
to congratulate themselves upon a de
cided improvement in scholarship dur

ing the past semester, al
though they should remem
ber that this improvement

is only noticeable on account of the
abnormally low standards which pre
viously prevailed in their ranks.
The statistics of the Registrar's of
fice show that only one out of every
eight fraternity men was flunked last
semester. We extend the fraternities
our felicitations upon this showing,
and recommend to them a careful
scrutiny of the table printed on the
front page.
