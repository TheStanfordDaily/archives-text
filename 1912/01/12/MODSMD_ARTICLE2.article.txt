# AMERICAN EDUCATION RECEIVES MUCH PRAISE
## Mr. Mosely Addresses Assembly on Advantages of System Employed in Our Schools. 
### 
Public education and edification in 1
the United States received brickbats
and bouquets in the words ot' Alfred
Mosely, British publicist and education
expert, in an assembly this morning
on "Modern Tendencies." Hut there
were so many more bouquets than
brickbats that the president of the
Crane company would have found
scant comfort therein for his cam
paign against technical education.
Mr. Mosely offered unstinted praise
of the great system of free instruc
ion of this country that reaches from
the kindergarten to the university, anil
condoned the fact that Great Britain
had not yet progressed that far in
education,
ristocracy Educated in England
"In England, university education
is for the aristrocracy, not the
r.asses." said Mr. Mosely. "fn bygone
times, it was the aristrocracy that
ruled the world, but today it is to
democracy that we must look to learn
whether it is forward or backward
that development must lead. That
the rule may be intelligent and in
the line of progress, the universities
and common schools must prepare
people for the task.
"The aristocracy of England have
ruled wisely because they have a
thousand years of tradition behind
them. They dare not tear down their
good name, and hence have been above
petty and bad politics. An honorable
name ia worth more than all the
r.oney you can get. That the rule
may be wise, we must have culture,
education, and, above all character."
Tlio Square l>eal
"Modern tendencies today are to
ward the 'square deal' as President
Roosevelt would say," continued Mr.
Mosely. "The laws which rule the
people must be developed in educa
ion. There must be no more devil
lodging and seeking of loopholes to
avoid punishment. ,
"The lawyer of the next decade
must be a peacemaker, not a seeker
simply after the best for his client,
cr an overcomer of opposition, what
ever it may be. He must have a bet

ter argument for settlement than try
ing to get the best of the other man.
In sohr, he must be an honest aroiter.
"Now this is in the lines of modern
science, and science is the greatest
keynote of the future, if the world is
going to move on the lines we wish,"
affirmed Mr. Mosely. "in some ways
you have followed the right path in
this country and in others you have
gone astray.
American Newspapers a Disgrace
"The newspapers in the United
States are a disgrace to your country.
They are a maze of murder sensations
and black headlines. Who cares if
Mrs. Jones' cat fell down three flights
of stairs. It is nut the purpose of a
good newspaper to record such.
"You should read the London Times
as a really great publication, ft does
not rave or rant."
Mr. Mosely was interrupted by
laughter which brought from him a
good natured smile.
"You may laugh at the dryness of
the Times," he continued, "but it is
the true pulse of the world. The
Times has correspondents in every
large city. It contains a vast amount
of real information.
America Lacking in Art
"Art and music are somewhat neg
lected in the United States. You have
not yet produced a really great com
poser. Of course, your composers
have written some really nive music;
I do not criticize, because it is in the
natural trend of your affairs in this
country. You will produce some
great artist and musicians as time
goes on; if you do not, it will be bad
for you.
We Lead in Invention
"In nventions and manufacure. I be
lieve that America largely leads. Al
though it was Bessemer who gave to
the world the great steel process, Uni
ted States engineers have largely de
veloped it to what it is today.
"As a young man, 112 went to South
Africa to the mines. There, Gardiner
Williams, a San Francisco engineer,
wa3 able to show us how to mine in
