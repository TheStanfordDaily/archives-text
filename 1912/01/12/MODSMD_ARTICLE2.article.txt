# AMERICAN EDUCATION RECEIVES MUCH PRAISE
## Mr. Mosely Addresses Assembly on Advantages of System Employed in Our Schools. 
### 
Public education and edification in 1
the United States received brickbats
and bouquets in the words ot' Alfred
Mosely, British publicist and education
expert, in an assembly this morning
on "Modern Tendencies." Hut there
were so many more bouquets than
brickbats that the president of the
Crane company would have found
scant comfort therein for his cam
paign against technical education.
Mr. Mosely offered unstinted praise
of the great system of free instruc
ion of this country that reaches from
the kindergarten to the university, anil
condoned the fact that Great Britain
had not yet progressed that far in
education,
ristocracy Educated in England
"In England, university education
is for the aristrocracy, not the
r.asses." said Mr. Mosely. "fn bygone
times, it was the aristrocracy that
ruled the world, but today it is to
democracy that we must look to learn
whether it is forward or backward
that development must lead. That
the rule may be intelligent and in
the line of progress, the universities
and common schools must prepare
people for the task.
"The aristocracy of England have
ruled wisely because they have a
thousand years of tradition behind
them. They dare not tear down their
good name, and hence have been above
petty and bad politics. An honorable
name ia worth more than all the
r.oney you can get. That the rule
may be wise, we must have culture,
education, and, above all character."
Tlio Square l>eal
"Modern tendencies today are to
ward the 'square deal' as President
Roosevelt would say," continued Mr.
Mosely. "The laws which rule the
people must be developed in educa
ion. There must be no more devil
lodging and seeking of loopholes to
avoid punishment. ,
"The lawyer of the next decade
must be a peacemaker, not a seeker
simply after the best for his client,
cr an overcomer of opposition, what
ever it may be. He must have a bet

ter argument for settlement than try
ing to get the best of the other man.
In sohr, he must be an honest aroiter.
"Now this is in the lines of modern
science, and science is the greatest
keynote of the future, if the world is
going to move on the lines we wish,"
affirmed Mr. Mosely. "in some ways
you have followed the right path in
this country and in others you have
gone astray.
American Newspapers a Disgrace
"The newspapers in the United
States are a disgrace to your country.
They are a maze of murder sensations
and black headlines. Who cares if
Mrs. Jones' cat fell down three flights
of stairs. It is nut the purpose of a
good newspaper to record such.
"You should read the London Times
as a really great publication, ft does
not rave or rant."
Mr. Mosely was interrupted by
laughter which brought from him a
good natured smile.
"You may laugh at the dryness of
the Times," he continued, "but it is
the true pulse of the world. The
Times has correspondents in every
large city. It contains a vast amount
of real information.
America Lacking in Art
"Art and music are somewhat neg
lected in the United States. You have
not yet produced a really great com
poser. Of course, your composers
have written some really nive music;
I do not criticize, because it is in the
natural trend of your affairs in this
country. You will produce some
great artist and musicians as time
goes on; if you do not, it will be bad
for you.
We Lead in Invention
"In nventions and manufacure. I be
lieve that America largely leads. Al
though it was Bessemer who gave to
the world the great steel process, Uni
ted States engineers have largely de
veloped it to what it is today.
"As a young man, 112 went to South
Africa to the mines. There, Gardiner
Williams, a San Francisco engineer,
wa3 able to show us how to mine in
a scientific way. He built up the
mines of South Africa to what they
are today.
"It.was while in South Africa that
I learned what is responsible for the
greatness of your men in such fields.
It is your great system of education
which reaches from lhe kindergarten
to the university.
"In the United States you Leach the
young to reason. A British school
boy learns his lesson and recites it
and thai is all. In America the youth
is asked to explain why he gives the
answer, and he learns to think for
himself. There is the secret of Ameri
can success: The habit of reasoning
things out is responsible for your
great progress."
Interchange of Instructors
Mr. Mosely told of his efforts to im
prove the educational systems of
Great Britain and America by the in
tervisits of scholars and schoolmas
ters. These visits had been chiefly
valuable in enabling the instructors
better to understand modern tenden
cies in education.
He spoke of the great value placed
on education by the 'Greeks, which
lead students to. pay as much as $10.-
000 for a course of lectures, and ab
jured Americans to make the most of
their great opportunities in educa
tional fields.
Affirming that the "hand which
rocks the cradle rules the world," Mr.
Mosely declared that to the women of
the world is the task of implanting
character in the rising generation.
"Education is not the dry bones of
learning, but the building of charac
ter," declared Mr. Mosely. "Character
is the keynote of all you are going to
do. But the last thing you can afford
to part with is your self-respect.
There is no permanent success ex
cept that built up on square-dealing
and honor.
"In conclusion, I will say that the
modern tendency in America is ex
pansion. I do not mean of the soil,
but from within your country. The
training of your men is the heritage
of your future. Justice is the one
aim that rules the world of tomor

"In nventions and manufacure. I be
lieve that America largely leads. Al
though it was Bessemer who gave to
the world the great steel process, Uni
ted States engineers have largely de
veloped it to what it is today.
"As a young man, 112 went to South
Africa to the mines. There, Gardiner
Williams, a San Francisco engineer,
wa3 able to show us how to mine in
a scientific way. He built up the
mines of South Africa to what they
are today.
"It.was while in South Africa that
I learned what is responsible for the
greatness of your men in such fields.
It is your great system of education
which reaches from lhe kindergarten
to the university.
"In the United States you Leach the
young to reason. A British school
boy learns his lesson and recites it
and thai is all. In America the youth
is asked to explain why he gives the
answer, and he learns to think for
himself. There is the secret of Ameri
can success: The habit of reasoning
things out is responsible for your
great progress."
Interchange of Instructors
Mr. Mosely told of his efforts to im
prove the educational systems of
Great Britain and America by the in
tervisits of scholars and schoolmas
ters. These visits had been chiefly
valuable in enabling the instructors
better to understand modern tenden
cies in education.
He spoke of the great value placed
on education by the 'Greeks, which
lead students to. pay as much as $10.-
000 for a course of lectures, and ab
jured Americans to make the most of
their great opportunities in educa
tional fields.
Affirming that the "hand which
rocks the cradle rules the world," Mr.
Mosely declared that to the women of
the world is the task of implanting
character in the rising generation.
"Education is not the dry bones of
learning, but the building of charac
ter," declared Mr. Mosely. "Character
is the keynote of all you are going to
do. But the last thing you can afford
to part with is your self-respect.
There is no permanent success ex
cept that built up on square-dealing
and honor.
"In conclusion, I will say that the
modern tendency in America is ex
pansion. I do not mean of the soil,
but from within your country. The
training of your men is the heritage
of your future. Justice is the one
aim that rules the world of tomor
row."
Public education and edification in 1
the United States received brickbats
and bouquets in the words ot' Alfred
Mosely, British publicist and education
expert, in an assembly this morning
on "Modern Tendencies." Hut there
were so many more bouquets than
brickbats that the president of the
Crane company would have found
scant comfort therein for his cam
paign against technical education.
Mr. Mosely offered unstinted praise
of the great system of free instruc
ion of this country that reaches from
the kindergarten to the university, anil
condoned the fact that Great Britain
had not yet progressed that far in
education,
ristocracy Educated in England
"In England, university education
is for the aristrocracy, not the
r.asses." said Mr. Mosely. "fn bygone
times, it was the aristrocracy that
ruled the world, but today it is to
democracy that we must look to learn
whether it is forward or backward
that development must lead. That
the rule may be intelligent and in
the line of progress, the universities
and common schools must prepare
people for the task.
"The aristocracy of England have
ruled wisely because they have a
thousand years of tradition behind
them. They dare not tear down their
good name, and hence have been above
petty and bad politics. An honorable
name ia worth more than all the
r.oney you can get. That the rule
may be wise, we must have culture,
education, and, above all character."
Tlio Square l>eal
"Modern tendencies today are to
ward the 'square deal' as President
Roosevelt would say," continued Mr.
Mosely. "The laws which rule the
people must be developed in educa
ion. There must be no more devil
lodging and seeking of loopholes to
avoid punishment. ,
"The lawyer of the next decade
must be a peacemaker, not a seeker
simply after the best for his client,
cr an overcomer of opposition, what
ever it may be. He must have a bet

ter argument for settlement than try
ing to get the best of the other man.
In sohr, he must be an honest aroiter.
"Now this is in the lines of modern
science, and science is the greatest
keynote of the future, if the world is
going to move on the lines we wish,"
affirmed Mr. Mosely. "in some ways
you have followed the right path in
this country and in others you have
gone astray.
American Newspapers a Disgrace
"The newspapers in the United
States are a disgrace to your country.
They are a maze of murder sensations
and black headlines. Who cares if
Mrs. Jones' cat fell down three flights
of stairs. It is nut the purpose of a
good newspaper to record such.
"You should read the London Times
as a really great publication, ft does
not rave or rant."
Mr. Mosely was interrupted by
laughter which brought from him a
good natured smile.
"You may laugh at the dryness of
the Times," he continued, "but it is
the true pulse of the world. The
Times has correspondents in every
large city. It contains a vast amount
of real information.
America Lacking in Art
"Art and music are somewhat neg
lected in the United States. You have
not yet produced a really great com
poser. Of course, your composers
have written some really nive music;
I do not criticize, because it is in the
natural trend of your affairs in this
country. You will produce some
great artist and musicians as time
goes on; if you do not, it will be bad
for you.
