# SEVEN VETERANS TO REPORT FOR BASEBALL
## FOUR OUTFIELDERS AND THREE INFIELDERS ARE BACK Practice Will Start on the New Field Promptly at 4:30 Monday. 
### 
Including Captain S. W. Gilfillan,
'12, seven baseball veterans will be on
hand for the first practice of the
season on Monday. Six of these men
payed on last year's team, while one
was a member of the victorious 1910
Varsity.
But three of these men are infield
ers, Captain Gilfillan, pitcher, L. Cass,
'13, second base, and Z. A. Terry, '14,
short-stop. M. B. Henshaw, '12, L.
Childs, '13, and H. A. Beeger, '13,
played the out-field last season, while
M. Obear, '12, played center-field in
1910.
M. F. Enderle, '12, and B. I'. Van
Dyke, '12, substitute pitchers last
season, and W. L. Scofield, '11, sub
stitute catcher on the 1909 Varsity,
are all expected to report for action
on the opening day.
First base, catcher, and third base,
will all have to be filled with new
material. It is not improbable that
in case another first-cass pitcher is
found that Captain Gilfillan will play
the first bag himself. The veteran
out-field looks to be a strong one, but
it is not at all certain that these men
will all find a berth on the intercol
legiate team.
From last season's squad should
develop some likely ball-players, who,
together with new material from the
Freshman class will probably make a
number of interesting fights for places
on the nine.
The Fall practice was a big success
and was especially pleasing to Cap
tain Gilfillan because of the new ma
terial that was brought out and the
kind of ball played in the games.
The matter of a coach has not yet
been decided upon, but until that
time it is highly probable that .1. I).
Peters, '12, will be asked to serve in
(hat capacity.
Graduate Manager D. W. Burbank.
'09, has already outlined a schedule of
games which will be given out in a
few days and calls for the first game
at an early date.
