To hear an honest appraisal of one's
merits or demerits is a luxury not often
enjoyed. Those who attended the

assembly this morning were
fortunate in hearing such an
estimate of the American na
tion and the American people.

Mr. Mosely spoke not in a spirit of
captious criticism nor with that fine
feleing of superiority which so often
clouds the judgment of visiting Eng
lishmen, but rather with an intimate
knowledge and appreciation of his
topic.
While giving the newer country
credit for its tremeurous strides along
industrial and technical lines, and for
the experiment of making democracy
workable through the general educa
tion of the masses, he deplored the
spirit of greed and graft, and express
ed a wish that something of the code
of public honor prevalent in English
public life could be transported across
the Atlantic.
The views of America entertained
by Mr. Mosely are undoubtedly those
held by many of his fellow country
men. It is of such kindly criticism
that benefit is reaped.
