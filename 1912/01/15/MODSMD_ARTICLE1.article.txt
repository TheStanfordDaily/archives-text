# FIFTY-EIGHT MEN SIGN UP FOR BASEBALL
## FIRST PRACTICE OF YEAR STARTS TODAY. J.D. Peters, '11. Consents to Act as Coach to Help Captain Gilfillan. 
### 
Fifty-eight men today signified their
candidacy for places on the 1912 Var
sity baseball team. When compared
with the number who signed at last
year's first baseball meeting this num
ber is very favorable, for at that time
but 45 men showed their intention of
playing ball.
This year's list will lie enlarged
still more by a number of men who
were absent at today's meeting but
who will report at practice.
Of the men who have signed, seven
are veterans and three are Varsity
substitutes. A large number of last
year's Varsity squad also added their
names, and, together with the new
material, should cause much competi
tion for places. Hut twelve Fresh
men signed at today's meeting. This
was somewhat of a surprise.
J. D. Peters, '11, has consented to
act as coach and together with Cap
tain Gilfillan will have complete
charge of the squad. Peters will re
ceive no compensation for his ser
vices, which will be invaluable to the
players because of his experience
gained in the ranks of professional
ball.
