# SOCCER TEAM DEFEATED IN HARD FOUGHT BATTLE.
## Stanford Players, Unaccustomed to Positions, Give Pastimes Busy Afteroon. 
### 
The hardest fought soccer battle of
this season resulted in the triumph of
the fast Pastimes over the Stanford
eleven in San Francisco Saturday af
ternoon. The final score was 5 to 2.
The Cardinal players held their more
experienced opponents to three points
up until ten minutes of the final half
time. The city team was compelled
to put up one of the best games that
it has played in during the schedule
of the California Football league.
The Stanford combination played
several new men and part of the
Pastimes' points were made because
of the fact that the Cardinal repre
sentatives were unaccustomed to their
positions. In two weeks the same
teams will contest on the Encina
gymnasium field.
H. W. Maloney has been named by
the league as the official referee for
the next two games. On next Satur
day the Vampires will journey to the
campus and meet the University team.
