In the course of his interesting ad
dress at Encina last night, President
David Starr Jordan dwelt upon the

place university train
ed men occupy in the
political life of the

country and the making of its history.
A little farther 011 Dr. Jordan cen
sured the undergraduates for their
neglected opportunities, for their fail
ure to become acquainted with the
instructors who impart wisdom to the
Stanford students.
We agree entirely with this. The
student misses the best part of his
college course in failing to make the
acquaintance of his instructors, but
how about the instructors, what of
their neglected opportunities?
At Stanford there are approximately
one thousand men, the majority of
whom, as trained professional men,
will have not a little influence upon
the development of the country, per
haps leading "new insurgent move
ments," as Dr. Jordan has said.
We do not think that a more per
sonal contact with these men would
have any permanently harmful effect
upon the 150 instructors. On the
other hand, it might do them good.
To be absolutely fair, we will say
there are many faculty members who
are approachable by students, and for
their friendship we are thankful; but
these men are certainly not in the
majority.
