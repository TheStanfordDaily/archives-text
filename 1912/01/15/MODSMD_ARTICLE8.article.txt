### 
While speaking to the men of the
University, assembled In Encina Club
room, Sunday evening on the subject,
"Resolutions and Decisions — How
They Make Men," President Jordan
emphatically stated that there are
three resolutions which every man
should make. These were, to know
himself, finding where he stands in
life and recognizing his own short
comings and strong points; to make
the most of himself in any line that
lie has chosen for his life work: and
to be a good husband, father and citi
zen. He showed clearly that every
one of these is essential for a man's
success and happiness in life.
He impressed upon the minds of
the men that negative resolutions are
not the right kind to make, as they
seldom succeed.
I). W. VVeist, secretary of the Y. M.
C. A., presided at the meeting, which
was attended by a great number of
men.
