# CAST OF JUNIOR OPERA WILL BE CHOSEN SOON
## LARGE NUMBER OF CONTESTANTS INSURES GOOD CAST. Tryouts Under Coach Carlyle to be Held the End of this Week. 
### 
Junior Opera Tryouts for parts wiW
lie held Friday and Saturday of this
week under the direction of Fred
Carlyle of San Francisco, who has
been engaged to coach the production
of the Eliel-Wilson-Chase opepa on
March 2S.
'"The Girl and the Voice," the opera
selected by the 1913 Opera Committee,
has been in the hands of Coach Car
lyle during the holidays, and the piece
has been orchestrated and arranged
for stage presentation.
Tryouts will be conducted upon the
basis of voice and acting ability, and
separate tryouts will probably be held
for each. The large number of sing
ing and speaking parts affords a
splendid opportunity for a number of
campus songsters who have already
shown their ability upon the Assembly
Hall stage. To select a cast of
twenty-five, and two choruses, will be
a large undertaking, but the great
number who have already announced
their intention of trying-out indicates
a successful production. Further par
ticulars of the tryouts will be an
nounced after the meeting of the
Junior Opera Committee on Tuesday.
The medals awarded by the Junior
Class to the authors of the opera,
have been sent to the campus, and
are of exceedingly artistic design. P.
Eliel, '13, W. S. Wilson, '13, and E. E.
Chase, ex-'ll, are the winners who
will receive these medals.
