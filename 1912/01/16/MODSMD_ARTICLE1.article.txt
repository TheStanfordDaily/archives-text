# MASQUERS WILL SECURE COMPLETE NEW SCENERY
## "ADMIRABLE CRICHTON" TO HAVE COMPLICATED SETS. Local Color Will be Secured by Importing Material From South Sea Islands. 
### 
The audience which attends the Mas
quers' play, "The Admirable Crich
ton," on Febraury ninth, will see
elaborate and unique new scenery
which has been procured from San
Francisco.
One very fine setting represents an
island on which some of the characters
have been ship-wrecked. The sandy
beach will be shown with waves toss
ing and a wind blowing the high grass
and other tropical foliage which is to
form a jungle at the back of the beach.
In the distance will be seen the wreck
of the deserted ship.
Another scene in which the setting
and properties will be particularly in
teresting and unique shows the in
terior of the little hut built by the
castaways on the island. Many of
the articles used will be particularly
interesting, as they are genuine, being
imported from the South Sea islands.
The lights will be lantern fish. Much
rude pottery will be used together
with utensils made of shells and stone.
A great contrast will be found in
the setting for the drawing room
scenes. For these most elaborate fur
niture and decorations have been ar
ranged. They will be rich and beauti
ful, with every detail blended into a
most harmonious whole.
This is the first time in many years
that entirely new scenery has been
procured for a play at Stanford.
