gaged for several weeks in preparing
their arguments and one of the closest
debates ever engaged in by the two
lower classes is expected. The present
Sophomore class was the second in
the history of Stanford to win as
Freshmen, and its representatives are
resolved to round out its victorious
record next month, while on the other
hand the Freshmen are determined to
firmly establish the precedent of a
victory by the baby class.
Resolved, That judges should be
subject to popular recall, constitution
ality granted," is to be the topic of
the speakers. C. C. Close, 0. H. Castle
and T. L. Smith will represent the
Sophomores, and the Freshman de
baters will be P. L. Higgins, A. F.
Coyle and W. F. Kilcline. Close and
Castle were members of the victorius
Freshman trio last year, Smith having
served as alternate on one of the Var
sity debating teams in 1911. One of
the Freshmen, Higgins, has already
won his spurs in Stanford debating by
winning a place on this year's inter
collegiate team. The other two, Coyle
and Kilcline, are men with excellent
preparatory school reputations and
should make the Sophomore speakers
extend themselves to prove their
mastery in the forensic art.
