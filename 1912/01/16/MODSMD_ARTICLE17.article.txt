The Stanford student ha?
held a deep-down belief th* ur . t
who represented the Univc r.n

the various athlei
fields were not me.
athletes but were also

clean sportsmen who believed and put
into practice the doctrine of "the
square deal."
That this belief is shared by others
is a matter of satisfaction, and from
accounts received from British Colum
bia our neighbors across the boundary
line agree in our estimate of Stan
ford athletes.
Among several commendatory let
ters from Canada is one from a leading
athlete of British Columbia who high
ly compliments Stanford upon the
sportsmanlike conduct of her teams.
In his communication published else
where, Dr. Frank Angell quotes at
length this gentleman's appreciation
of . the way Stanford's teams play
rugby.
We thank our friend for the bou
quet he casts at our feet, but we are
immodest enough to say we think the
1911 team deserve them.
