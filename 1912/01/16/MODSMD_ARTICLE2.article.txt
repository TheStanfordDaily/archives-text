Francisco announce that the new
shell ordered last semester from Sim
in England has arrived in the Expo
sition city and will he shipped down
to lied wood as soon as the boat house

shell is the best that can be secured
in the world and is practically similar

and this country by the championship

shipped around the Horn on a slow
freighter.
The boat is practically ready for use
as it stands, except for a few minor
attachments which could not be put
on before crating for shipment. It
is planned to try the boat out for the
first time with all the old Varsity men
i;i the University as a crew. It will
probably be placed in the water some
time this week.
