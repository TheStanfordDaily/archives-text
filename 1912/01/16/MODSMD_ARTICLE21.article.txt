I give be'nw some extracts from a
letter writ English gentle
man livinf. mver, who is an
enthusiast] • of rugby foot
ball.
"Your iiicii iino j ear have greatly
enhanced their reputations with our
people. They played desperately hard
games, losing two of them after hold
ing the lead and there was never a
grouch or murmur from any one of
them, nor the semblance of any un
derhand tactics or any attempt to beat
■o rules or olllcials. Every endeavor
1 be made to perpetuate these fine
•r contests and retain the high
standard that, we have now
d."
,ie tenor of the letter is like that
all the reports on the playing of
our teams which have come down from
Vancouver, and it is needless to say
that such reports are of far more
value to the University than the win
ning of many games.
As regards the technical aspects of
the Stanford game, my correspondent,
who is an "expert" in Rugby tactics,
criticises our style of play as being
too "stereotyped."
