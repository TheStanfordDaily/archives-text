# SEISMOLOGICAL SOCIETY RECEIVES LARGE GIFT.
## Money Will be Used to Publish Journal Describing Temblor Phenomena. 
### 
The Bulletin of the Seismological
Society of America, edited by Profes
sor S. D. Townley of the Mathematics
department, and issued from the Stan
ford University Press, is the recipient
of a gift of $.3,000. R. W. Sayles, a
member of the society and curator of
the geology section of Harvard mu
seum, is the donor. This amount is
to be used to defray the expenses of
the Bulletin, and will be sufficient to
insure its continued publication for
five years.
The journal, of which Professor
Townley is editor, has been published
at Stanford for one year. It is the
official organ of the society, a grow
ing organization composed largely of
scientista. Geologists studying the
phenomena of earthquakes make up
a large portion of its membership.
The great temblor of lOOii brought
about its foundation, members of the
Stanford faculty who had made a
study of that disastrous quake being
responsible for its organization. These
men effected a local organization
which was so rapid in its growth thai
at the present time its members are
counted under every tlag in the two
Americas. Dr. Sayles, the donor of
its recent gift, is himself an active
member, being a contributor on the
subject of frequency in relation to
climatic circles.
The December number of the bulle
tin contains an excellent article by
E. C. Templeton, '10, of the Geology
department, on "The Central Califor
nia Earthquake of July 1, 1911,'
which is illustrated with a map show
ing the isoseismals of the temblor.
J. S. Hook and Professor V. L. Kel
logg of Stanford are announced as
elected to the society in this issue of
the bulletin.
