A second dia he use of the
baseball men v readiness by
the end of the he new Held
is situated over beyond the auxiliary
gridiron In the direction of the county
road. It is being built upon the same
lines as those along which the new
Varsity diamond was constructed.
The only change will be to omit the
underground drainage system of the
the sandy nature of the soil
locality making it possible to
• ; aid yet have a dry diamond
i rain is past.
n these two diamonds and the
jibility of using the faculty's field
■i t- games, baseball will become a
sport in which more of the students
can participate than at present.
Through an increase in the bound
aries of the present athletic domain,
by the Trustees, it will be possible
to build another football field to the
north of the Varsity oval and adjacent
to the trolley tracks . This gridiron
will be completed before the opening
of next fall's rugby season. An in
crease in the treasury of the Student
Hody will be awaited before this field
is grassed.
The additions to the athletic equip
ment at Stanford raises it to a par
with any university in the country.
All this has been the work of the
Hoard of Control of Athletic Fields
which was called into existence by
the Board of Trustees in November,
190 a. With the taking in charge of
the football field at that time the
present regime was started and all
the rest of the equipment was pur
chased with the funds accruing from
the Student Hody assessments and
from half of the yearly surplus from
the gate receipts at athletic contests.
