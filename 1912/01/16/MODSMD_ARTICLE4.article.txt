# Record Number Start Baseball Practice On New Diamond
## 
### 
Nearly seventy players reported for
the first baseball practice yesterday.
Fifty-eight men signed-up at the meet
ing yesterday noon, while many more
signed on the field in the afternoon.
Light warming-up practice was at
first indulged in and was followed by
batting and infield work. Coach
Peters explained the rudiments of
meeting the ball squarely when at the
bat and the art of bunting. Light
practice of a similar kind will be the
order of play until such a time as the
men are accustomed to the afternoon
work.
In order to keep the entire squad
out until late in the season, Coach
Peters has devised a plan whereby
everyone will be given a chance to
play. It is his intention to pick a
squad of probable first and second
team players and to organize the
remaining number into a four-team
league.
The second team will have a regular
schedule of games and will receive
more than usual attention from the
captain and coach.
The league teams will be picked
in a manner to make them all as
nearly evenly matched as possible.
A reguar schedule of games will be
played, and watched closely by the
Coach in order that he may find any
new or improved material. A per
centage will be kept and the winner
named at the conclusion of the series.
Class teams will not be formed un
til later in the season. Thus when
the class championship games take
place a higher grade of ball will be
played than is usual at these times.
