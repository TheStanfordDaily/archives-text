# Representatives Meet Tonight To Discuss Boating Agreement
## 
### 
Representatives from Stanford and
California will meet tonight in San
Francisco to discuss the boating
agreement which now exists betwÂ«yyi
the two universities and to talk over
the situation in general before the
regular meeting of the Agreement
Committees of the rival institutions
is held a week hence. K. L. Schaupp,
'12, president of the Student Body,
and R. H. Seward, '12, crew captain,
will represent Stanford. Crew cap
tain S. Malatesta and probably T. A.
Davidson will take care of the Cali
fornia interests.
Boating as an Intercollegiate sport
must be placed on this basis in the
Intercollegiate Agreement this year,
as last season the regatta was only
temporarily recognized because of the
fact that it was taken off the list the
year previous. The crew leaders
wish to have the agreement in such
a shape that when the Committees of
Stanford and California meet in regu
lar .session next week there will be
no necessity of any prolonged discus
sion. The four men who will talk
over the situation will meet in the
Palace Hotel, where the Agreement
Committees will also have their ses
sion.
While in San Francisco, Seward and
Schaupp will make arrangements for
the towing down of the new eight
oared shell whicji the Cardinal rowers
have just received from England.
The boat will be brought to Redwood
City by a steam launch and is to be
kept 011 the estuary for immediate
use.
