condition.
S. W. Guthrie, manager of the 1918
Quad, spoke to the class for a few
minutes emphasizing the necessity of
having all organization pictures in
the hands of the editor before the end
of this month. He said that no pic
tures would be taken for use in the
book after that time, as any such ac
tion would delay the printing of the
volume, or else make it necessary to
leave the books for too short a time
in the bindery.
On motion, the class voted $125 to
the Junior Opera Committee. This
money will be used to defray the cost
of orchestration and other minor
details.
