Again this spring the University of
California will be represented by a
wonderful collection of track athletes.

To defeat this well balanced
team, which last year hail
scarcely an equal in the Uni-

ted States, will be the task confront-?
ing Captain T. L. Coleman and Trainer
Moulton.
With only a handful of experienced
men from which to build, Trainer
Moulton faces the impossible, unless
the Student Body vigorously supports
him.
The rally tomorrow night will be ft
good sign of what Stanford can do
when it faces defeat. Shall we have
only a few men of proven ability sigr)
up for track work, or shall every man
who is able to hobble around the field
willingly undergo a season's training?
We have sufficient equipment in the
way of athletic fields and training
houses to accommodate every man in
the University. Let us forget our
criticisms of so-and-so's ability as a
hurdler or sprinter, and try to do
something ourselves.
