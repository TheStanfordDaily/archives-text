"It was my duty to have .loved the
highest." These words of Tennyson
was the test.-chosen by- Dr. Jordan for
his talk before the Young Women's
Christian Association yesterday after
noon.
Belief and self-denial were the two
essentials which he pointed out were
required in the performance of one's
highest duty.
"Wisdom consists in knowing what
to do next and virtue is the doing of
it,"was the main lesson of the talk.
The special music was furnished by
Miss N. Beach.
