# EMINENT SCHOLAR TO LECTURE IN CHAPEL.
## Tomorrow Evening's Talk Will be Illustrated With Especially Prepared Lantern Slides. 
### 
Seldom does an American scholar
become a professor in one of the great
German universities, but such is the
position held by Professor Caspar R.
Gregory, who will deliver an illus
trated lecture in the Memorial Chapel
tomorrow evening at 8 o'clock, upon
"Mount Sinai â€”Its Monasteries and
Manuscripts." Dr. Gregory is Profes
sor of Theology at the University of
Leipsic and came to this country at
the invitation of the Archaeological
Institute of America as the Charles
Eliot Norton Memorial Lecturer for
1912.
Professor Gregory was born in
Philadelphia and received his educa
tion at the University of Pennsylvania
and the Princeton Theological Sem
inary. For his scholarly work in the
study of Greek manuscripts he has
received honorary degrees from the
Universities of Pennsylvania, Yale and
Glasgow. In Germany his name is
known to every citizen for the share
be has taken in the movement to
bring about closer sympathy between
the church and the workingman. His
long residence in Germany, during
which he has been actively engaged in
theological research and teaching, and
also taken part in politics, insures his
command of the matters on which he
vi'.l speak.
