# RECOMMENDATIONS MADE BY CREW MEN FOR RACE
## STANFORD AND CALIFORNIA MEN REACH AGREEMENT. Varsity to Row Over Three Mile, Freshmen Over Two Mile Course. 
### 
Representatives from Stanford and
California interested in crew met last
night at the Palace hotel to discuss
the recommendations which they
should make to the Intercollegiate
Agreement Committee in regard to the
boating agreement between the two
universities. Stanford's representa
tives were K. L. Schaupp, '12, cap
tain of the 1911 crew, and R. H. Sew
ard, '12, this year's captain. Califor
nia's men were T. A. Davidson, '11,
captain of the 1911 boat, and Captain
Maynard of the 1912 crew.
After some discussion it was de
cided to recommend to the Agreement
Committee what was considered by
the representatives to be the most
suitable features for a permanent
agreement.
The course, as in the past, will be
on the Oakland estuary. Whether the
upper or lower course will be chosen
is not yet known. The upper course
over which the race was rowed last
year insures smoother water to the
crews but offers the disadvantage of
being more or less crooked. The low
er course on the other hand is
straighter but not so safe from the
standpoint of smooth water. It is a
fairer course for both crews. It may
be possible to secure an observation
train for spectators if the lower course
is chosen.
Varsity Course Three Miles.
The Varsity race this year will be
over a course of three miles. The
Freshmen will only cover a two mile
course. In the past when the Fresh
men have rowed in eights the race
has been over a three mile course.
The race will be rowed on the morn
ing of the third baseball game at Cali
fornia, provided there is such a game.
Otherwise it will be rowed on the
morning of the Intercollegiate Track
meet. There will be no attempt to
row the race, however, if the weather
is not favorable.
Officials and such minor details as
the time of the starts and the like will
be decided on by the respective cap
tains and managers at least two weeks
before the proposed time for the
races. This insures a satisfactory
choice of officials.
Ih case there should be any acci
dent to equipment within the first fif
teen strokes, such as the breaking of
an oar or a rigger, the race shall be
started again.
In case of swamping of either boat
due to outside elements, the race shall
be re-rowed. The decision as to the
cause of the swamping shall be left
with the referee.
Race From Lock Start.
Probably the most important action
from the standpoint of the crews is
the decision to have the races begin
from what is known as a lock start.
In this method of starting two boats
are moored in the stream at right an
gles to the course. A man in each of
these boats holds on to the rudder of
one of the shells and only releases it
at the starting gun. This insures ab
solute fairness in starting.
In addition, it is probable that the
course will be surveyed this year to
insure an accurate rowing of the full
specified distance.
