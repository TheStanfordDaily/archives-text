# MONSTER RALLY TO OPEN SPRINC ATHLETIC SEASON
## Crew and Track Men Will Sign Up for Work Tomorrow Night.â€”Six Speakers to Address Meeting. 
### 
With the mamoth rally in Encina
tetllbroom, the track and crew season
for 1912 will be formally opened to
morrow evening, when the leaders of
the oarsmen and the cinder path
athletes will make the formal call
for men to try for the Cardinal teams.
Six speakers are on the program to
address the men. They are Professor
F. Angell, chairman of the Faculty
Committee on athletics, T. L. Coleman,
'12, track captain, R. H. Seward, '12,
crew captain, K. L. Schaupp, '12, presi
dent of the Student Body, A. E. Roth,
student adviser, and "Dad" Moulton,
the Stanford trainer. The subjects
which the men will speak upon have
not yet been announced definitely.
From the indications evidenced by
the number of men who were out for
fall training for both track and crew,
the present season should witness a
larger enlistment of aspirants for
places on the Stanford teams than
ever before. Last year one hundred
and thirteen men signed up for track
at the initial rally and fifty-five signi
fied their intention to try for seats
in the Cardinal shells. With the add
ed facilities this season in both sports

and the co-operation of the hygiene
department in encouraging the men of
the gymnasium classes to take up
work on the track, the names of
many students not heretofore interest
ed will be found among those on the
lists tomorrow night.
Itetter Facilities Insure Success.
Active work under the direction of
"Dad" Moulton and Captain Coleman
lor the trackmen and Captain Seward
and the coaching committee for the
rowers, will be begun immediately.
The cinder path was putin excellent
condition during the recent recess.
New take-offs have been completed
for the various jumps and the entire
course has been treated so as to pre
vent injury to the men.
With the arrival of the new shell,
use by the oarsmen. The veterans
are expected to begin work on the
estuary at Redwood without delay,
and the newer recruits will be put
through the usual preliminary train
ing routine. The inauguration of fall
training last semester will undoubted
ly show very beneficial effects and be
of great advantage as a time saver for
the coaching committee in getting
the new men down to the real task
of operating the oars. Practically all
of those who signed up for work in
the fall will put their names on the
list at the rally.
The ineligibilty of some of the
members of the track team and the
vacancies caused by graduation offer
more oportunity this season for men
to make places on the Stanford team
than ever before. There are places
on the team for over one hundred men
and "Dad" wishes every man who
can possibly train to sign the roll at
the rally, regardless of any previous
experience.


R. H. SEWARD
Crew Captain.
