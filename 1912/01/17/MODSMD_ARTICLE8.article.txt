Preliminary tryouts for both prin
cipals and chorus of the Junior
Opera will be held Friday afternoon
at 4:30, and Saturday at 9:30, in
room (58. Coach Carlyle will be pres
sent, at this tryout, and will consider
the voices, irrespective of acting or
dancing requirements. Later, another
tryout will be conducted to cast the
principals and choruses.
Owing to the large number who
will tryout, numbers will be distri
buted so that half of the aspirants can
tryout Friday and those remaining
will come Saturday morning.
Songs or copies of parts will not
be circulated by the committee, but
each person trying for a part is re
quested to bring his or her "favorite,''
and an accompanist will be present
to assist in the rendition of that song.
