# RECOGNITION AS MINOR SPORT GIVEN SOCCER
## PLAYERS AGAINST CALIFORNIA TO GET EMBLEMS. Presley, Barrett and Schaupp Named As Agreement Committee.â€”Name Guild Members. 
### 
With the adoption of soccer by the
Executive Committee as a minor sport
one more contest between Stanford
and California is added to the list of
annual struggles between the rival
universities. The recognition of the
English game last night, places soccer
on the same basis as tennis and the
men who represent the Cardinal
against California will be awarded the
"minor "S," which consists of the Stan
ford emblem enclosed within a circle.
Whether there will be but one con
test, or a series of matches between
the teams of the two institutions, has
not yet been decided.
The soccer elevens of Stanford and
California will play on Washington's
birthday for the Wiliamson trophy.
In all probability this meeting will
lie recognized as the scheduled inter
collegiate soccer game and the cup
contest will continue to be recognized
as the regular "big game" for the soc
cer players. The conditions which the
donor of the challenge trophy out
lined when the cup was offered for
a competition between Stanford and
California make it possible for this
match to be the annual meeting of
the two universities as intercollegiate
rivals. According to the agreement
the trophy is to become the perman
ent property of the team winning it
in the best two out of three games.
One match is to be played each year
beginning with February 22, 1912.
