### 
The action of the Executive Com
mittee in recognizing soccer football
as a minor sport will he welcomed by

everyone. Soccer has grown
in popularity since it was
introduced here a few years

ago, and this season furnished exer
cise and amusement for almost one
hundred men.
The Student Body has provided
funds for the soccer players during
the past two years and last night
assumed control of a branch of ath
letics which depended upon the un
dergraduate treasury for support.
