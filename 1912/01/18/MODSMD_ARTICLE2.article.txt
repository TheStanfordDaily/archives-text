# TENNIS PROSPECTS ARE BRIGHTEST IN YEARS
## FOUR VETERANS ELIGIBLE FOR PLACES ON TEAM. New Men Will Make Old Players Work Hard to Retain Their Places. 
### 
With seven candidates, four of
whom are veterans, for places on the
four man tennis team that will repre
sent Stanford against California, the
tennis outlook for the University is
one of the best in years. Every one
of the seven men is a first-class ten
nis player and all are anxious to be
numbered among the four who will
meet the Blue and Gold.
H. S. Morgan, '12, the 1911 captain,
is in college, and on the showing he
made last semester, he is sure to put
up a good fight against the racket
wielders from across the bay. After
a long rest, Captain R. L. Murray, '13,
has started to practice again and will
soon be displaying all of his splendid
form and speed. A year ago Murray
came within a very few points of
winning from C. Rogers, the Califor
nia tennis champion.
Besides the two captains, V. Shel
don, '15, who made a remarkable show
ing last year, is eligible for a place
on the team. Sheldon's record was
one of the best ever made here by a
Freshman. He won the champion
ship of the University, the Thiele Cup
and was "runner-up" in all the other
tournaments. He will make a strong
bid for a place on the big team.
The sensational finish and close
scores of the last interclass tourna
ment displayed the excellent quality
of work of Morgan, Murray and Shel
don. Morgan, won from Murray, 9-7,
S-6, 5-7, 3-6, 9-7, and Sheldon defeated
Morgan, 2-6, 7-. r >, 6-3, 5-7, and 6-2.
F. S. Pratt, '13, G. L. Shaul, '13, W.
Hutchinson '15, and C. P. Sonntag, '15,
will also probably be heard from be
fore the final selection of the team is
made. Pratt is a veteran of 1911 and
has a good record. His work is not
considered consistent, but once he
launches a winning boom, he seldom
returns defeated.
Shaul represented the Cardinal two
years ago. and is eligible to play this
year. The two Freshmen, Hutchin
son and Sonntagg, with practice, might
be developed into Varsity timber as
both show streaks of wonderful form
at times.
