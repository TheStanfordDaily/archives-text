# JUNIOR OPERA TRYOUTS WILL BEGIN TOMORROW.
## Twenty-four Speaking Roles and Sixty Chorus Positions are to be Contested For. 
### 
Tryouts for positions in the cast
and chorus of the 1913 Junior Opera,
"The Girl and the Voice," will begin
tomorrow afternoon at 4:30 in room
GB. It lias been estimated that there
are approximately 1500 students at
Stanford who'have a sneaking desire
to make at least one appearance be
hind the footlights, and at least elghty
of these can realize this ambition on
March 28, when the Assembly Hall
audience will see The Girl and hear
The Voice. This opera has about
twenty-four-speaking parts to be till
ed and choruses sixty strong.
The tryouts will continue tomorrow
afternoon and evening and Saturday
morning. At the end of this time the
final selections for the choruses will
probably be announced, but it is
planned to choose two for each prin
cipal part, one of whom will be eli
minated at a tryout next week. Those
contesting for speaking roles will be
required to render selections from
the opera as well as to sing anything
they may choose. Those wishing
chorus positions are to be asked to
sing from their own music.
