At last we have him and may he he
with us for many years. He whom
we refer to, is the speaker at last

night's rally, who, with an
utter fearlessness and a fine
disregard for personal danger
which we admire, pointed out

one of the reasons why so many ex
cellent athletes and other students
are missing from Stanford activities
each semester.

The mortality from this disease is
especially heavy among the Fresh
men. If an undergraduate can safely
pass through his first year here, ap
parently he is impervious to further
attacks.
The remedy recommended last night
was that a custom be originated which
would place the ban upon Freshmen
queening. We believe this remedy
would be effective, having a salutary
effect both on scholarship standards
and track teams.
