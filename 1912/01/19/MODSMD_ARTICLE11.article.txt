Stanford faces a somewhat dismal
outlook 011 track this season, but with
one hundred and fifty men working

daily under the care of Train
er Moulton we are not yet de
feated. Training will begin on
Monday afternoon and the

Student Body asks only hard, eonsci
entous work from the men signed up.
Whether they win points or are among
the "also rans" makes no difference,
it' they give their best in the endeavor.
