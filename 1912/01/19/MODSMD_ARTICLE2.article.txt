# MEN WILL HEAR LECTURE BY NOTED RESCUE WORKER.
## Well-Known Figure in San Francisco Missions Has Accepted Invitation To Talk in Chapel. 
### 
"The White Slave Traffic" will be
the subject of a lecture, illustrated
with the stereopticon, to the men of
the University, in the Chapel, 7:30,
Sunday evening, by J. C. Westenberg,
of the Whosoever-Will Mission in Sa - i
Francisco.
Topics of minor detail, with which
Mr. Westenberg will deal, are "The
Great White Way," "The Barbary
Coast," "Trafficking in Girls," "Ten
Years in the Slums." The speaker
has long been connected with the res
cue work, and the pictures, with

taken by himself.
It has taken the Y. M. C. A. nearly
'ix months to get this speaker to talk
to the University men, as his time for
Sunday evening talks has been in
jT~at demand. He is about to start
on a trip through the East, where he
\vMl speak on the rescue work.
