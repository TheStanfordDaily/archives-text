# RALLY'S FIGHTING SPIRIT AUGURS VICTORIOUS YEAR
## Number Signing Last Year for Track and Crew Exceeded at Meeting in Encina Clubroom Last Night. 
### 
Track and crew were formally
ushered into the spring athletic arena,
last evening In a rousing rally thai
would have put to shame those who
claim that the Stanford spirit is no
more.
Never at a spring rally in the mem
ory of the present generation has
such enthusiasm 1 een shown. The
number of men signing up for crew
and track; the volume of the yell
that went up to greet, every speaker
as he stepped out onto the table that
that has been used in rallies stncj
time immemorial; the general spirit
of the rally, all lode well for the
coming season.
It was a rally speaker once who
said that "the spirit of the evening in
the spirit of the season." The spring
semester of 1912 should be a success
in every sense of the word if this
formula is a criterion.
I)r. Angell Speaks.
Professor Angel I, who was the first
speaker of the evening, said, in part:
"The spirit here at the University
now is the best I have known in years.
The boys who are here now are good
boys. The leaders you have are us
good as you have ever had. Tlit
whole situation at the present time
is altogether admirable. (Jo in and
win."

When the yell-leader, called upon
Student Hcdy President K. L. Schaupp,
|'12, Schaupp said: "You don't expect
to make the team. You know you
can't make it; but you do it for the
sake of your college. That is ttit
spirit that wins. Stanford men play
like men. You've got to throw your
j self Into it every minute with everv
| ounce you have in you. We have all
| of us got to light it through all sea
! son."
Student Adviser Roth said: "We
i have no chance to win unless every
| man here tonight who is debating
| whether he will go out signs up.
; This meet is going to be won by the
| men who have never gone out for
1 track."
Roth's words evidently had their
effect as I">2 men signed up for frank
as against 113 last season.
! Two Captains Talk.
('aptain Coleman of the track team
said: "It's up to the men in the Uni
versity to make ii'i the difference he

tween 50, which we can now get,
and (J2 points which we need to win.
We have a few men who will make
good, but unless you want us to be
swamped you must come out."
After explaining the training rules,
Crew Captain R. H. Seward said;
"California men are hard fighters.
There is every reason to believe they
will fight as hard this year as they

did last. We need new men in order
to perpetuate the sport. We want
every year to lay down the founda
tion for a winning team in the year
immediately to follow and in the years
to come."
When "Dad" Monlton was called on
a slight stir of expectancy filled the
room. The men were waiting to hear
a story. They were not disappointed.
"Dad" said: "No race was ever won by
looking backwards. Every horse has
some time been an also ran. Come
out, all of you. Get out and use the
track. Don't let it go to weeds."
