# DR. GREGORY SPEAKS ON MT. SINAI DISCOVERIES.
## 
### 
Dr. Caspar Ren6 Gregory, of the
I Diversity of Leipzig, lectured last
evening in the Chapel upon the sub
ject of "The Monasteries and Manu
scripts ol Mt. Sinai." Dr. Gregory is
an authority upon New Testament re
search and criticism. He first gave a
very interesting account of his travels
about Sinai.
Going on to one of his main topics,
Dr. Gregory told how various monas
teries and ruins were situated on the
mountains or jebbas, as they are call
ed, of the Sinai district. The great
monastery of Sinai, however, is not
situated on a mountain of the same
name, as is generally believed, but on
a plain, according to Dr. Gregory.
The two most important manu
scripts discovered in these monasteries
were a manuscript in old Greek found
in the convent of Sinai in the year
1844, and a Syriac manuscript dis
covered by two English women several
years later.
