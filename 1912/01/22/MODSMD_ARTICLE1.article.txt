###

the first game of the season against
the Olympic Club on Saturday, 10-3.

manner with a victory, and it was

against them, while the Olympic play
ers made four. Stanford hit safely
twelve times as against four times
for the Club men.
The visitors started with a rush
and scored two runs in the first in
ning, on two walks and a hit. Stan
ford's first run was made in the next
inning by Beeger who hit safely to
center and scored on Obear's long
hit to the same field, the latter being
caught at the plate by a pretty relay
throw-in.
In the third the Varsity took the
lead when Terry and Childs, running
for Gilfillan, scored after the cap
tain had singled to left. In the next
frame, three two-base hits in rapid
succession by Henshaw, Enderle and
Terry sent two more runs across.
Batting honors for the day go to
Cass, who hit safely three times. Ter
ry is credited with two. In the sixth,
these players were responsible for
two more runs by scoring Gilfillan and
Childs.
Stanford scored in every inning ex
cept the first and last, while the city
men put their third score of the day
over in the ninth. Rutledge and Tal
lent, former Stanford men, played
with the visitors.
Jones, Howe, Enderle, and Couch
pitched in the order named, the first
three playing two innings each and

12. First-base on balls—off Jones 2,
Howe 1, Enderle 2, Couch 1, Sperry 1,
Struck out—by Jones 3, Howe 4, En
derle 2, Couch 2, Sperry 2. Three-base
hits —Cass, Obear. Two-base hits —
Enderle, Henshaw, Terry. Umpire—
Crawford.
The line-ups were:
Stanford —Terry, Worswick, short;
Gilfillan, Argabrite, third; Noble,
Childs, left; Cass, MeClosky, second;
Beeger, Halm, right; Obear, Gault,
center; Henshaw, Dooling, first; Sco
field, Dent, catcher; Jones, Howe, En
derle, Couch, pitcher.
Olympic—Hood, left; Muhl, second;
Rippon, short; Swanton, Workman,
first; Littlepage, Tallent, center; Rut
ledge, catcher; McMillan, third; Sper
ry, pitcher.
Playing errorless ball, Stanford won
the first game of the season against
the Olympic Club on Saturday, 10-3.
In three ways was this game of
special importance,—it was the first
game to be played on the new dia
mond, it started the season in a fitting
manner with a victory, and it was
the first time in four years that it
has been possible to play the first
scheduled game.
Twenty Stanford men played with
out having a single error charged
against them, while the Olympic play
ers made four. Stanford hit safely
twelve times as against four times
for the Club men.
The visitors started with a rush
and scored two runs in the first in
ning, on two walks and a hit. Stan
ford's first run was made in the next
inning by Beeger who hit safely to
center and scored on Obear's long
hit to the same field, the latter being
caught at the plate by a pretty relay
throw-in.
In the third the Varsity took the
lead when Terry and Childs, running
for Gilfillan, scored after the cap
tain had singled to left. In the next
frame, three two-base hits in rapid
succession by Henshaw, Enderle and
Terry sent two more runs across.
Batting honors for the day go to
Cass, who hit safely three times. Ter
ry is credited with two. In the sixth,
these players were responsible for
two more runs by scoring Gilfillan and
Childs.
Stanford scored in every inning ex
cept the first and last, while the city
men put their third score of the day
over in the ninth. Rutledge and Tal
lent, former Stanford men, played
with the visitors.
Jones, Howe, Enderle, and Couch
pitched in the order named, the first
three playing two innings each and
the latter finishing the same.
