# Freshmen.
## 
### 
We cannot understand the seemingly
deep abhorrence with which the mem
bers of the Freshman class regard the

offices at the disposal of
class. After holding two
meetings and keeping the

nominations open for at least a week,
the last candidate for a class office
withdraws his name today through the
columns of the Daily.
The reason for this sudden wave of
modesty and self-obliteration among
the Freshmen is rather hard to dis
cern. The presidency of a class with
the initiative and ability 1915 has al
ready shown, is no light honor.
Perhaps the real solution is that
some interested upperclassmen have
suggested to proteges that they would
"get in wrong" by running for office
during their Freshman year.
This attitude of self-seeking cannot
be too highly condemned, and if allow
ed to grow, it will destroy much that
is best at Stanford. Above all, we do
not wish a return to the old days when
the Freshman presidency was looked
upon as a joking matter.
