# RECOMMEND STANFORD TRACK FOR TRYOUTS.
## Olympic Games Committee Selects Cardinal Oval as Fastest in Western America. 
### 
Conceding the Stanford oval to be
the fastest in the West and one of the
best in the United States, the com
mittee of the P. A. A. which will have
charge of the Olympian games tryouts
has recommended that they be held
here. The date set for the competition
to decide places on the team has been
fixed as May 18. The officials are of
the opinion that the athletes of the
western states should have every pos
sible chance to make records which
would compare favorably with those
of the aspirants for the team in the
East and Middle West. The committee
also has the Golden Gate Park stadium
under consideration as a possible site.
In deciding to recommend Stanford
as the place for the tryouts the com
mittee was of the opinion that any
idea of making the tryouts provide
funds for sending the team to Sweden
should be given up and that the finan
cial end should be handled in another
manner. To assist in raising funds
for the American team, however, it
was decided that a big indoor meet be
held at the Auditorium in San Fran
cisco on February 23.
The final matter of the selection of
a track for the tryouts will be de
cided by the entire committee, of
which Professor F. Angell, of Stan
ford, is a member. A mail vote will
be taken from the delegates in Port
land, Seattle and Los Angeles.
