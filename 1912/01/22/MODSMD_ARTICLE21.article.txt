# OVER ONE HUNDRED TRY OUT FOR JUNIOR OPERA.
## Special Competition Will be Held Tomorrow for Men.-No Decision as to Cast. 
### 
Something over one hundred people
tried out Friday and Saturday for
places in the cast of the Junior Opera,
"The Girl and the Voice," which is to
be given in the Assembly Hall, March
28. Of those who have so far contest
ed, something over eighty are women.
In order to secure more men for the
parts another special try-out will be
held tomorrow at 4:30 in room 84.
The fact that there are over three times
as many speaking and singing parts
for men as for women, should bring
out a larger number for the male
parts. The chorus for men is almost
as large as that for the women. With
the exception of the "ponies" there
will be about as many chorus parts
for men as for women.
No decision as to casting the opera
has been made as yet. Those who
have tried out have been given tenta
tive places on the cast, but so keen is
the competition and so excellent the
talent that four or five people have
been placed so far for each of the
principal parts. Further try-outs for
the principals will be held in the near
future.
Coach Carlyle is well pleased with
the talent that has been displayed so
far and expects to be able to offer the
college public the best opera cast
that has ever been seen at Stanford.
He is particularly desirous that more
men try-out. For any person who has
ever done any work as a German come
dian, there is an exceptionally good
part which requires no singing. He
asks that any men who have ever had
any experience of this kind try-out at
the meeting of the committee tomor
row.
Further details as to the final cast
ing of the principals will be published
within a few days.
