# STANFORD SOCCER TEAM DEFEATS BRITISH TARS.
## 
### 
England and the United States were
the participants in a miniature inter
national combat on the Encina gym
nasium field, Saturday morning. Rep
resentatives from the two nations,
namely, the sailors from the British
gunboat Algerine and the Stanford
soccer eleven met in a fast football
game which resulted in a victory for
America.
The visitors were unable to score
a single point, while the Cardinal team
placed the ball in the net four times.
B. Erb was largely responsible for the
Stanford victory. A. Erb was not far
behind his brother in excellent work.
The English tars threatened the
Stanford goal several times, but the
defensive work of the Cardinal eleven
prevented any scoring. The Vampires
were scheduled to play but forfeited,
and the British team were substituted
for the defaulting club. H. W. Ma
loney acted as referee.
The following was the Stanford line
up: Lyne, goal; King, Higgins, full;
Clawson, Reynolds, Williams, halves;
Shelton, B. Erb, A. Erb, Pellas, Fyfe,
forwards.
