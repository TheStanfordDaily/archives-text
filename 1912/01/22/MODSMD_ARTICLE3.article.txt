# SEWARD ELECTED TO PRESIDENCY OF 1912
## CREW CAPTAIN TO SERVE AS EXECUTIVE. Prominent Senior Receives 62 Votes in Race for Highest Honor in Gift of Class. 
### 
R. H. Seward was elected president
of the Senior class as a result of to
day's balloting. He received 62 votes,
while T. Sanborn, who contested the
office, received 43 votes. The remain
ing positions, which were uncontested,
will be filled as follows: Vice-presi
dent, S. C. Kennedysecretary, Miss
A. Yoch; treasurer, J. W. Vickers;
sergeant-at-arms, T. L. Coleman.
Although his name did not appear
on the ballot the retiring president
received one vote, which was enough
to place him again in office. No nom
inations were made for the office,
which is purely honorary and entails
no work.
An amusing incident occurred when
the officials in charge of the polls
about 2:15 collected an assessment of
fifty cents levied on the instant from
a prominent baseball candidate. He
promptly paid but remained in the
vicinity until the next voter appear
ed, when he discovered the hoax and
became the butt of a good laugh.
The new president has been prom
inent in University and class activi
ties since his first semester. He has
played a prominent part in dramatics,
and in crew since the spring of 1909,
when he rowed in the Freshman boat.
For the last two years he has rowed
in the Varsity eight and this year finds
him crew captain. He is enrolled in
Sword and Sandals, Skull and Snakes,
and Delta Upsilon.
