# RESCUE WORKER GIVES LECTURE IN CHAPEL.
## Dancing and Cigarettes are Scored by J.C. Westenberg in Talk to Men. 
### 
Cigarettes and social dances were
the prime causes that J. C. Westen
berg, of the "Whosoever Will Mission"
of San Francisco, gave for the down
fall of most men and women. He was
talking to a large number of Univer
sity men in the Chapel, Sunday even
ing, on the subject of "The White
Slave Traffic."
With the aid of the stereopticon, the
speaker vividly depicted the horrors
of the "Barbary Coast" and places of
like nature, where he is actively en
gaged in giving shelter to men who are
down and out, and in helping women
who wish to change their ways, to get
a new start in life.
