## FRESHMEN AND GUESTS CROWD ENCINA CLUB ROOM. Dr. Jordan Speaks on Stanford's History .â€”Alumni and Upper Classes Represented. 
### 
The Birthday Dinner given by the
Freshman class to Dr. Jordan on last
Friday evening was an unqualified suc
cess. The club room at Encina was
crowded, two hundred and fifty Fresh
men, upper class representatives,
members of the faculty and guests,
being seated at the prettily decorated
tables.
The occasion of the affair was the
sixty-first birthday of Dr. Jordan, and
the truly appreciative anniversary
spirit that pervaded the gathering was
shown in the burst of applause that
greeted the appearance of a huge
birthday cake, ablaze with sixty-one
candles.

K. L. Schaupp, '12, acted as toast
master and introduced the speakers of
the evening in a happy way. P. L.
Higgins, '15, voiced the sentiments of
his class when he said in his welcome
to Dr. Jordan "We count this oppor
tunity of greeting the President of the
University as the greatest privilege
that has come to us as a class. It
has been a well-established custom
for the President to greet the incom
ing class at the first of the semester,
but this year, on our entering the
University, Dr. Jordan was on a
world's peace mission in the far east.
So we took the initiative, and now en
joy the unusual privilege of welcom
ing our President on his return to
his own University."
In well chosen and happy words,
Miss E. McCord, a gifted speaker, gave
"A Tribute."
A. E. Both Speaks.
As a representative of the alumni,
A. E. Roth, '09, spoke on "Your Place
in Stanford History," reminding the
latest additions to the "Stanford Fam
ily" that the University was still in
the making, and that in the far dis
tant future their record would help
make or mar the reputation of their
Alma Mater.
Professor Stillman, in a very inter
esting talk, told of the routine work
of the average university president,
and gave the Freshmen an intimate
view of the daily tasks and responsi
bilities of their own President. Dr.
Gardner gave a very clever "Toast to
the Captain," recalling his advice
given to the Freshmen at an assembly
last September "to get on the boat."
Dr. Gardner seemed firmly convinced
that, the Freshmen were on the boat,
and were on to stay.
