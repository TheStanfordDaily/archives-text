# LAKE LAGUNITA BEGINS TO FILL FOR CREW WORK.
## Water Will Probably be High Enough Within Week to Launch First Shell. 
### 
As if in expectancy of the beginning
ot' the work for crew men, Lake
Lagunita began last week to All up
and is already nearly high enough to
allow the launching of the first shell
of the semester. It is probable that
in less that a week the water will be
up to the boathouse apron so that the
boats may be carried down and placed
in the water.
Captain R. 11. Seward, '12, expects
to train the new men on the lake as
has been done in the past. Veterans
and all others who have had experi
ence will be sent to Redwood in the
near future. Until the Freshmen be
gin to row at Redwood the two old
shells and the new one now awaiting
shipment to Redwood from San Fran
cisco will probably be used for train
ing the Varsity and any other men
who have had sufficient experience.
This will allow twenty-four men and
three coxswains to train on the Bay in
the beginning of the season. When the
Freshmen begin to make the trip to
Redwood two Varsity boats, a first
and a second, will train there daily.
This will allow practically twice as
many men to do crew work as was
possible last year.
