# CARNOT TEAM TO BE PICKED JANUARY 30.
## Rapid Preparation Necessitated by Nearness of Date.â€”Few Experienced Men out for Trio. 
### 
Prospective Carnot debaters have a
strenuous season in store for them.
Tuesday, January 30, has been fixed as
the date of the trvout for this import
ant forensic contest, while the success
ful contestants on this evening will
meet the Blue and Gold the following
Friday, February 2. Owing to a
slight misunderstanding with Califor
! nia, it. had been generally supposed
that the debate would occur later in
the semester. Consequently, there has
as yet been little activity among candi
dates for the Carnot team.
Under the present arrangement, only
four days will elapse between tryout
and the intercollegiate contest. Owing
to the fact that the Carnot is extem
poraneous, this will not work a great
hardship on (ho Stanford debaters
chosen, while the postponement of the
tryout to the last possible date will
make it possible for the contestants
in it to be larger in number and better
prepared.
The special subject for discussion
will be selected from the general field
announced last semester, "The Rela
tion of France to Germany." Al
though .a large number have not as
yet signified their intention of trying
for the Carnot team, it is expected
j that this showing will be materially
I improved before January 30. At pres
ent there is but one veteran, E". E.
Tincher, '12, in the field. Since the
Carnot is one of the most important
of intercollegiate forensic teams, many
will doubtless take advantage of this
exceptional opportunity to win a place
on it.
