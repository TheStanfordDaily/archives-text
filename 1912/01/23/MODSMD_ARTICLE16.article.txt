# WOMEN'S BASKETBALL PRACTICE TO BEGIN.
## Two Months' Training Required for Entrance Into Interclass Match Games. 
### 
Women's Basketball practice for this
semester will begin this week, under
the direction of Captain B. Whelan,
'12, and Miss Cleaveland. Games
will be played every Monday, Wednes
day and Friday afternoons at 4:30, on
the Roble courts.
Although intercollegiate relations
are still suspended, a series of inter
class games will be played for the
University championship cup, which
was won last year by the 1912 team.
The Senior team is looked upon as a
strong aggregation and will bid high
for cup honors this year. The Sopho
mores have a large squad of players
who will give the Seniors a hard con
test. for the championship.
Owing to the rule providing for two
months' practise before a player can
enter contest games, it will be neces
sary for girls who are interested in
basketball to sign up at once at Roble
gymnasium, and begin- training this
week.
