# THREE YEARS' BATTLE FOR EATING CLUBS IS SUCCESS
## Faculty and Encina Committees Are Appointed and $1000 Buildings Will Be Built at Once. 
### 
The final approval of the board of
directors of the University is all that
now withholds the beginning of con
struction on a building costing ap
proximately $10,000 to house the long
anticipated eating clubs.
The trustees already have given
their sanction to the plan and have
empowered the committee to use their
discretion in outlining the financial
project for the erection of the build
ing.
Credit for the successful "consum
nation of the eating house plan,
which the student body has sought for
three years, in large measure is due
to the advisory board of the alumni
association. The members of this
board have labored unceasingly to
obtain the eating houses for the stu
dent body.
The financial arrangement, as it now
stands, offers sufficient funds to pro
vide for three clubs. Although no
definite site for the location of the
building has as yet been chosen, it is
very likely that the committee will
favor the location east of Encina hall.
The advisory board of the alumni
association met on Saturday in San
Francisco for the special purpose of
hearing the report of the sub-com
mittee on the eating-house proposition.
Ths committee submitted a plan simi
lar to that on which the athletic fields
of the University are run. This plan
met with approval in its entirety.
The board of trustees, at the December
meeting, approved the general propo
sition of the eating-house and gave
the committee sanction to go ahead
and map out a plan.
Committees to Handle Funds.
Preparations for the work were
made in the form of a committee of
seven members to superintend the task
of carrying through the erection of
the building, four of the members of
the committee to be appointed by the

president of the advisory board and
the other three by the board of direc
tors of Encina Club.
The president of the advisory board
named Professor Cubberly of the Edu
cation department, J. E. McDowell, '00,
assistant registrar, R. W. Barrett, '04,
and N. Cleaveland, '99.
The directors of Encina Club named
H. C. Nelson, '10, F. L. Guerena, '11,
and F. C. Brown, '11. As soon as the
committee can be brought together,
plans will be formulated and final ar
rangements for the lease on the ground
for the buildings will be made with
tho board of trustees, after that body
has passed the plans of the committee.
The form of the buiiding and its
general arrangement of course as yet
have not been definitely decided. How
ever, the financial plan provides for
approximately $10,000, for the erec
tion of a suitable building in keeping
with the form of the other university
edifices.
The tentative location east of En
cina Hall is ideal for the purposes of
the eating-houses, being easily acces
sible and centrally located. It may be
that another location still more satis
far iovv will be found.
Hiiildings Heady in August.
It. is hoped that there will be no
delays in the beginning of construction
work on the building, in order that it
may be completed by the time the Uni
versity opens next August.
Two years ago the eating-house
proposition was turned down by the
board of directors and again, a year
ago, the board failed to look favorably
on the project, largely because that
body was asked to build the building.
Last September a scheme was
evolved by which the University should
finance the plan, and the advisory com
mittee of the alumni association at
once took up the work of carrying the
plan through.

Two years ago the eating-house
proposition was turned down by the
board of directors and again, a year
ago, the board failed to look favorably
on the project, largely because that
body was asked to build the building.
Last September a scheme was
evolved by which the University should
finance the plan, and the advisory com
mittee of the alumni association at
once took up the work of carrying the
plan through.
The final approval of the board of
directors of the University is all that
now withholds the beginning of con
struction on a building costing ap
proximately $10,000 to house the long
anticipated eating clubs.
The trustees already have given
their sanction to the plan and have
empowered the committee to use their
discretion in outlining the financial
project for the erection of the build
ing.
Credit for the successful "consum
nation of the eating house plan,
which the student body has sought for
three years, in large measure is due
to the advisory board of the alumni
association. The members of this
board have labored unceasingly to
obtain the eating houses for the stu
dent body.
The financial arrangement, as it now
stands, offers sufficient funds to pro
vide for three clubs. Although no
definite site for the location of the
building has as yet been chosen, it is
very likely that the committee will
favor the location east of Encina hall.
The advisory board of the alumni
association met on Saturday in San
Francisco for the special purpose of
hearing the report of the sub-com
mittee on the eating-house proposition.
Ths committee submitted a plan simi
lar to that on which the athletic fields
of the University are run. This plan
met with approval in its entirety.
The board of trustees, at the December
meeting, approved the general propo
sition of the eating-house and gave
the committee sanction to go ahead
and map out a plan.
Committees to Handle Funds.
Preparations for the work were
made in the form of a committee of
seven members to superintend the task
of carrying through the erection of
the building, four of the members of
the committee to be appointed by the

president of the advisory board and
the other three by the board of direc
tors of Encina Club.
The president of the advisory board
named Professor Cubberly of the Edu
cation department, J. E. McDowell, '00,
assistant registrar, R. W. Barrett, '04,
and N. Cleaveland, '99.
The directors of Encina Club named
H. C. Nelson, '10, F. L. Guerena, '11,
and F. C. Brown, '11. As soon as the
committee can be brought together,
plans will be formulated and final ar
rangements for the lease on the ground
for the buildings will be made with
tho board of trustees, after that body
has passed the plans of the committee.
The form of the buiiding and its
general arrangement of course as yet
have not been definitely decided. How
ever, the financial plan provides for
approximately $10,000, for the erec
tion of a suitable building in keeping
with the form of the other university
edifices.
The tentative location east of En
cina Hall is ideal for the purposes of
the eating-houses, being easily acces
sible and centrally located. It may be
that another location still more satis
far iovv will be found.
Hiiildings Heady in August.
It. is hoped that there will be no
delays in the beginning of construction
work on the building, in order that it
may be completed by the time the Uni
versity opens next August.
