# JUNIOR WOMEN WILL VISIT EXECUTIVE BOARD.
## Plan to Study Working of Women's League.â€”Representatives Will Be Elected Thursday. 
### 
Next Thursday the Junior women
will elect ten members of the 1913
class to visit the meetings of the Ex
ecutive Board of the Women's League.
This move was decided at the meeting
of Junior women today in order to
obviate the disadvantage of having an
entirely new Hoard next year. At
the present time only Seniors (with
one exception) comprise the member
ship of the League Executive Hoard,
and it is desired to familiarize the in
coming Senior class with the working
of the Board.
Miss N. Moise, '12, President of
the Women's League, addressed the
meeting and explained the new plan
which has been recommended by the
Executive Board. The election by de
nartment representation will be used,
hs in the Executive Board election.
Li3ts of Junior women will be posted

immediately in the Rest Room, where
the election will be held on Thursday,
from 1:30 to 2:30.
