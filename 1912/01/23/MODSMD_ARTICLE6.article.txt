### 
By a scant majority of two votes,
G. D. Worswick was today elected pre
sident of the Junior class over H. R.
Spence. W. R. Chandler is the new
vice-president. Miss M. Gilbert will
assume the position of secretary. In
the only other contest of the day, E. L.

treasurer over C. E. Beecher. A. H.

Never since the Junior elections one
year ago, when 1912 divided and re
turned a majority of one vote in favor
of a candidate for president, has such
an exciting class election been held at
Stanford. While the ballot clerks were
counting the ballots first one candi
date and then the other would assume
the lead. At the final count after all
ballots which were made void through
mistakes in marking had been lis
carded, Worswick had 42 votes to 40
or Spence. The casting out of the void
ballots had no effect on the final re
sults except that it reduced Wors
wick's majority by one.
In the election for treasurer, Peck
defeated Beecher 43 to 34. It is gener
ally believed tuat there was some mis
take in regard to his candidacy and
that he will not serve.
