Three graduates of Stanford, re
membering their undergraduate days,

have made it possible
to eliminate the most
serious inconvenience
suffered by men liv-

ing at Encina. Through the kindness
of Dennis Searles, '9a, G. E. Crothers,
'95, and Newton Cleaveland, '99, the
weary way to Mayfield and College
Terrace will be deserted, and ample
eating accomodations provided l'or all
students living on the campus.
These men, all of whom have achiev
ed high rank in the world of affairs,
have generously agreed to finance the
building of a clubhouse which will at
least partially solve the problem.
For several years an attempt has
been made to give better accomoda
tions to undergraduates. Movements
started by the Student Body have in
variably failed and until the proposi
tion was taken up by the alumni a year
ago, there was apparently no hope of
securing club houses on the campus.
Handled by an alumni committee
composed of II. W. Barrett, J. E. Mc-
Dowell, E. P. Cubberly and Newton
Cleaveland, the present plan was per
fected.
Speaking, we believe, in behalf of
the Stanford Student body, we thank
the three men who are to finance the
construction of the new clubhouse,
and those members of the alumni com
mittee who have given their time and
attention to the problem.
