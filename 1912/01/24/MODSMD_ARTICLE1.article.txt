# INTERSCHOLASTIC MEET WILL BE HELD IN APRIL
## MANY CUPS AND MEDALS AWAIT SCHOOLBOY ATHLETES. Seventh Annual Gathering of Trackmen on Stanford Oval Will Establish New Record. 
### 
For the seventh time the public and
private secondary schools of the Pa
cific coast and the west will compete
on the Stanford cinder path in the
greatest interscholastic carnival of
the season, under the management of
the Stanford University Interscholas
tic Athletic Association. Saturday,
April 13, is the date set for the annual
field and track meet of the prepara
tory school athletes.
Since 1900, when the Stanford Inter
scholastic Association was first form
ed and the initial meet promoted, the
entry list has gradually grown until
it reached about 275 men last year.
A still larger number of trackmen are
expected to enter the meet this spring.
The purpose in forming the inter
scholastic association was to advance
and improve amateur athletic sports
among preparatory schools of the
west. So successful has this object
been carried out that a similar or
ganization, modelled directly on the
Stanford plan has been established at
California.
Valuable trophies will be awarded
to the successful teams and medals
are to be given the individual point
winners. The first trophy is a per
petual challenge cup. It is given to
the school winning the meet. W. H. B.
Fowler, '06, father of the interscholas
tic association, is the donor of the
trophy, which is now in the posses
sion of Los Angeles high school. This
school is also holder of the Sigma
Sigma and Bittner cup. Both trophies
are to become the permanent property
of the school whose team wins them
three times. The Sigma Sigma cup is
the award for the team winning first
place and the Bittner cup is given to
the successful relay runners.
For the school annexing the second
highest number of points, the Thiele
cup is the prize. Orange Union high
school is the temporary holder of this
trophy.
Individual athletes have not been
overlooked by the association. The
man scoring the highest number of
points in track events exclusively, will
become the owner of the Quadrangle'
Club cup. Encina Club presents an
nually another individual trophy to
the man who makes the highest score
in the meet, both in track and field
events. Kelly, of Orange Union high
school became possessor of both these
cups in 1911.
In addition to the cups, the Associa
tion will award gold, silver, and bronze
medals to the first, second, and third
place men in each event.

Fowler, '06, father of the interscholas
tic association, is the donor of the
trophy, which is now in the posses
sion of Los Angeles high school. This
school is also holder of the Sigma
Sigma and Bittner cup. Both trophies
are to become the permanent property
of the school whose team wins them
three times. The Sigma Sigma cup is
the award for the team winning first
place and the Bittner cup is given to
the successful relay runners.
For the school annexing the second
highest number of points, the Thiele
cup is the prize. Orange Union high
school is the temporary holder of this
trophy.
Individual athletes have not been
overlooked by the association. The
man scoring the highest number of
points in track events exclusively, will
become the owner of the Quadrangle'
Club cup. Encina Club presents an
nually another individual trophy to
the man who makes the highest score
in the meet, both in track and field
events. Kelly, of Orange Union high
school became possessor of both these
cups in 1911.
In addition to the cups, the Associa
tion will award gold, silver, and bronze
medals to the first, second, and third
place men in each event.
Secretary A. W. Ambrose, '13, has
sent out letters to all the secondary
schools of the Pacific coast announc
ing the date of the seventh annual
meet.
