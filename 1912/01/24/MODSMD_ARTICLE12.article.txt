# Good Business.

Before a passion for economy over
took certain persons with an econ
omical appreciation of the beautiful,

Frenchman's lake was one
of the scenic spots of the
University. With its rows
of poplars and quaint sur-

roundings, the lake possessed a haunt
ing beauty which remained long in
the memory.
Recently, we are sorry to say, beauty
has given way to utility, and the lake,
as a convenient hole in the ground, is
being rapidly filled up with a compo
sitiono of tin cans, papers and other
garbage. As a result, much of the
original attractiveness of the place
has departed.
Even with this remarkable accumu
lation of trash on the lake's edge,
enough charm remains to justify an
attempt to save it from further de
filement.
With a little effort the Business
office could dispose of the garbage of
the University without transforming
a place of beauty into an eyesore.
Good business of this kind may
save a few dollars to be squandered
in some other manner, but it also ir
reparably destroys the enjoyment of
many.
