# Biological Clubs Will Hike.
## 
### 
The Jordan and Zoology clubs are
planning a combined tramping and
collecting trip to the Big Basin in Red
wood national park for Ihe mid-semes
ter vacation in March.
Although as yet definite arrange
ments for the trip have not been
made, the combined clubs are seeking
to bring together as large a party as
possible for the vacation excursion.
While the majority are planning to
go direct from Stanford to the basin,
it is expected that a large number
will tramp up Boulder creek to the
point where collections will be made.
