# JUNIOR WOMEN ELECT VISITORS TO-MORROW TO HOARD MEETINGS.
## 
### 
Ten Junior women will be
selected by ballot from that
class tomorrow, to visit the
meetings of the Executive
Board of the Women's League,
without vote.. At present the
Board membership is composed
of Seniors, with one exception,
and this new body will obviate
the disadvantage of an entirely
new Executive Board next year.
The election will be held in
Women's Rest Room, Thursday,
from 1:30 to 2:30.
