# "ADMIRABLE CRICHTON" INCLUDES STAR PLAYERS.
## Carefully Chosen Cast Insures Great Success for the First Play of the Semester. 
### 
The entire cast of "The Admirable
Crichton" has been working together
for several rehearsals so that the' play
is coming into shape in a most en
couraging fashion.
The smaller parts are of great im
portance in this drama and afford
splendid opportunities for character
work. Most of the fun in the tirst
act is occasioned by the lesser charac
ters when they gather for tea in the
drawing room of the eccentric lord
Brocklehurst, who has this entertain
ment of his servants for one of his
pet hobbies. The embarrassment of
these butlers, maids and stable boys
offers a fine chance for humor.
