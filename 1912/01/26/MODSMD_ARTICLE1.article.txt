Every fellow is going to give the best
he has in him. Some of the new men
are sure to come through and spring
a surprise. The older fellows are do
ing better tluui ever. Captain Cole
man and all of the older fellows are
always willing to offer all aid pos
sible. Results are what we want and
that's what we're going to get."—
"Dud" Moulton.
With more than one hundred and
sixty men out for places on the Gar-»
dinal track team and the prospect of
many of the aspirants becoming stars
in their respective events and thef
veterans living up to past records/
hopes for the success of the 1912
track season are becoming brighter.
Not content in breaking all previous
records as to the number signing up at
the first rally, the men of the Univer
sity continue to signify their intention
of training and every day has found
new runners on the cinder path.
Under the watchful eye of "Dad"
Moulton-, the runners, jumpers and
weight men are doing light prelimin
ary work. All week the candidates
have been putting in their spare time
on the oval and sever il of the new men
have given promise of developing into
trackmen of the first rank.
On Saturday many of the distance,
men will run their initial trial heats.
The distances will be shortened con
siderably and the workout will be in
the nature of a tryout so that "Dad"
may get an idea what to prescribe for
individual runners.
The rain of yesterday softened the
cinder path considerably, but the effect
of the dampness will not be so notice
able as last spring. The treatment to
which the entire track was subjected
during the latter part of the past year
has improved the oval almost a hun
dred per cent.
Three Stanford athletes will repre
sent the Cardinal at the big indoor
meet of the San Francisco Y. M. C. A.
in the Auditorium tonight. E. P.
Campbell, '13, G. L. Horine, '13, and
H. Morrison, '13, are the men entered.
Campbell will contest in the sprints
and shot put. The others are entered
in the jumps.
