# ELECTRICAL IMPROVEMENTS MADE IN ASSEMBLY HALL.
## 
### 
Entire rewiring of the Assembly
Hall and the installation of "exit
lights" over the doors are now being
completed. In addition, an elec
trician's room will be arranged at the
right of the stage, with asbestos-lined
walls and a large marble switchboard.
This will preclude the possibility of
fire, since the entire electrical system
of the building will be controlled from
this room. The pipe organ has also
been rewired.
Although the business office has not
confirmed the statement that these
improvements are being made, it
seems probable that it is true since
they are almost completed.
