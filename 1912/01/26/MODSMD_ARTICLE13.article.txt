# Clean Up.
## 
### 
Superintendent of Construction Hus
ton is making an attempt to clean up
the back yards of the campus. Lest

Mr. Iluston be mistaken
for a too presumptous
muckraker we will qualify

our statement and say that he is at
tempting to clean up the backyards
of the campus.
If cleanliness is next to godliness,
some of the selfsame backyards are
well, we refuse to mention the place
in these columns. Mr. Huston is act
ing under the orders of the Board of
Trustees, and the residents of the
campus should readily comply with his
requests in this matter of great sani
tary importance.
