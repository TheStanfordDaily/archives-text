# Petition For Arbitration Circulated.
## 
### 
Six voters of the University con
munity have signed the petition ad
dressed to the United States Senate
praying for the passing of the pend
ing arbitration treaties, without
amendment, with England and France.
The petitions have been circulated
throughout the universities and col
leges of the United States, and as a
result, some hundreds of names have
been sent to the Congressional Com
mittee on Arbitration urging that it
recommend to Congress a definite step
toward world peace.
In order to be effective the petition
must be returned to Washington at an
early date, and students and faculty
have been asked to sign the document
within the next few days. The peti
tion is on file in Dr. Jordan's office.
