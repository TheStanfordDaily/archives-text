# DR. JORDAN WILL HEAD VIGILANCE COMMITTEE.
## Trustees of National Organization Recognize His Services in Work Against Social Evil. 
### 
Dr. David Starr Jordan has recently
been chosen president of the National
Vigilance Committee by the trustees
of that organization. The society has
for its object the investigation and
suppression of the White Slave traffic,
and has already accomplished a great
good in some of the eastern cities.
Stanford's President has been prom
inently identified with this movement
for many years, having forcibly ex
pressed his opinions on the subject on
many occasions. The honor given
him, therefore, is in recognition of his
invaluable services to the rescue work.
The organization is supported en
tirely by private capital, and the
greater portion of the work is the dis
semination of literature throughout
the large cities. City councils are of
ten co-operated with in their legisla
tion against the social evil, and great
efforts are being made to awaken the
country to the need of immediate ac
tion. New York has been the object
of the greatest campaign carried on
thus far, and the home of the society
is in that city.
