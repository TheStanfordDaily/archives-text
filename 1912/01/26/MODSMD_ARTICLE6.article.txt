# 1913 "QUAD" BOARD STARTS FINAL LABOR
## EDITOR LOUD IS DESIROUS OF EARLY COPY. Sorority Pictures Will be One of the New Features.â€”Final Plans Are Completed. 
### 
Organized work on the 1913 Quad
has commenced in earnest. A meeting
of the entire board was held this week
and at that time final plans for the
book were completed and the members
of the staff were given their particular
assignments so that all the material
can be in by the middle of February.
The need of having the copy in at
such an early date is to make way
for the Spring athletics which will be
included in this year's annual.
The incorporation of Spring ath
letics was started last year and this
necessitated the running of all the
sports which occurred during three
semesters in order to bring the book
down to date. Now that the custom
has been established, every annual in
the future will contain only the events
of the current college year. This year
the editors will be seriously handi
capped by the lateness of the inter
collegiate track meet which will be
held on April 22. The contract calls
for the sale of the Quad on May 2,
which leaves only ten days to finish
the printing and bind the book.
Sorority Pictures a Feature.
Among the new features that will
appear in this year's Quad are the
sorority pictures. Heretofore the fra
ternities have always run their groups
but the sororities have refused. The
custom of publishing thfe sorority pic
tures is one that is general among the
Eastern colleiges but it will be the
first time that they have ever appear
ed at Stanford.
I,urge Josh Section.
Editor Loud is particularly anxious
to have the josh section one of the
best features of the Quad. K. R. Levy
and W. S. Wilson are in charge of this
department, but to make the section
a success it will take the co-operation
of the entire class. Any who have
comic photographs of members of the
student body are requested to turn
them in to the josh editors. All pic
tures will be returned at the end of
the semester so that any who take
their pictures from memory books
need have no fear of losing them.
The class pictures were taken last
semester, but as there are several
members of the cla=ts who transferrer 1
here this semester, the forms will be
held open until next Friday, and any
Junior who has not paid the assess
