# IRELAND INDEPENDENTS TO PLAY THE VARSITY
## GAME WITH LEAGUERS STARTS AT 3 O'CLOCK. This is the Twentieth Year That Stanford Has Played Cliff Ireland's Teams. 
### 
Weather permitting, Ireland's Inde
pendents will cross bats with the
Stanford Varsity tomorrow afternoon
at 3 o'clock. An admission of 25 cents
will be charged for all those not pre
senting season-tickets.
This will be the first of a five-game
series between the two teams, and the
first game of the season for the city
men. Ireland will make every effort
possible to win the initial game, while
Captain Gilfillan will do the same in
order to make it three straight vic
tories for the year.
For twenty years Iceland has
brought the Independents to Stanford
and each season he brings with him
a number of Big League players. In
the two games played last Spring, the
city men won handily. The leaguers
playing with Ireland this year are
Dick Egan, short, Cincinnatti infield
er: Tommy Sheehan, third, Portland
third-baseman; Charles Swain, center
field, Washington American League;
Duffy Lewis, left field, Boston Red
Sox; Lou Kennedy, first base, Seattle;
Doc Moskiman, pitcher, San Fran
cisco; Jimmy Byrnes, catcher, Phila
delphia Athletics; Sam Goslinsky,
U. C.; Cliff Ireland, second-base;
Henry Spencer, field, Salt Lake; Art
Schimpff, pitcher, Portland.
For each of these men Ireland has
nothing but praise. Of his catcher,
Jimmy Byrnes, the peerless leader
says, "W. J. Burns don't catch any
more stealing than Jim."
For the Varsity, Coach Peters an
nounces practically the same line-up
as went into the game last Wednesday.
Jones will probably start the game in
the box, while Dent will catch him.
Dooling will play first, with Cass on
second, Terry at short, and Captain
Gilfillan on third. The outfield, from
left to right, will be Noble, Obear, and
Beeger. Numerous changes in this
line-up will be made during the after
noon.
