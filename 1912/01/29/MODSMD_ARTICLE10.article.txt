# Peanut Politics.
## 
### 
To those Sophomores who possibly
may not know, we wish to impart the

in formation that the Daily
Palo Alfo is willing at all
times to receive announce
ments of class meetings.

It has been the custom in the past to
call these meetings through the col
umns of this paper, except where ur
gency demanded other action.
Late this morning a notice was post
ed in several inconspicuous places
that a meeting of the Sophomore
class would be held at 1:10 this after
noon. No legitimate reason was given,
nor has been given, for the remarkable
haste exhibited. Not one-half of the
class knew of the meeting, and appar
ently the whole scheme was concocted
by a group of Sophomores who en
deavored to browbeat their class
mates and name the officers for the
1914 Quad.
Such action on the part of any
group of underclassmen savors too
much of ward politics to be condoned
at Stanford.
Thanks to the good sense of J. L.
McDonald, president of the class, and
a goodly number of the Sophomores,
the peanut politicians were defeated.
The nominations for editor and man
ager were postponed until more accu
rate information could be secured con
cerning the management of the Quad.
The Junior annual, while issued un
der the auspices of one class, is dis
tinctly a book belonging to the whole
University. Since any scandal aris
ing in the course of the publication of
the Quad injures the good name of
Stanford, the Student body have a
right to demand of the the Sophomore
class that they do not enter into this
task in a light and irresponsible man
ner.
