# Beauty Spot Obliterated by Garbage.
## 
### 
Frenchman's Lake, once a beauty
spot of the University grounds, is be
ing rapidly filled with garbage and
sweepings, despite the protest which
went up from its admirers a short time
ago. At that time the work of obliter
ating the lake was stopped, but, evi
dently, only for the time being.
Unless radical steps are immediately
taken, the work of destruction will
soon be completed. At present the
lake has lost much of its former
charm, yet it could very easily be re
placed and could once more be pointed
out to visitors as a spot connected with
Stanford's history.
