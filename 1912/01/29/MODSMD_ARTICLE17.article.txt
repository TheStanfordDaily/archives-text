# REFERENCE LIBRARIAN TO LEAVE FOR REED COLLEGE.
## Miss M. Rossiter Accepts Head Librarianship of New Educational Institution in Portland. 
### 
To take the Head Librarianship at
the new Reed College, Portland, Ore
gon, Miss M. Rossiter, reference room
assistant in the Stanford Library, will
give up her duties here at the expira
tion of this college year. It was Miss
Rossiter's marked capability in her
chosen profession, as exhibited during
her service here, that won for her
the new position. This efficiency has
been no less marked than the retiring
librarian's obliging disposition in con
nection with her duties, which has
been exhibited on innumerable occa
sions to frequenters of the library.
Miss Rossiter's responsibilities in
the northern city will be heavy. Reed
College is in many respects an unique
educational venture. Interest on the
three million dollar endowment of the
late Mrs. Reed of Portland has been
allowed to accumulate for some years,
so that at the very outset the college
is enabled to construct handsome and
durable buildings, following the Gothic
style as exemplified at the University
of Chicago. In order that buildings
and equipment may be complete be
fore the commencement of instruction
in the higher years, the college, which
will throw its doors open next fall,
will receive only freshmen this season;
the next, freshmen and sophomores;
and, following out this plan, at the end
of four years its first graduates will
have completed their entire course in
their alma mater. Reed College will
be the only important private college
in the northwest.
