After a prolonged session, in which
all available candidates for positions
on the Junior opera cast "The Girl
and the Voice" were discussed, the
committee on Saturday picked the cast
as far as the women's leads are con
cerned. It was no easy task that con
fronted the committee, as the talent
that had been displayed was of a high
class throughout. During the morning
those who had taken part in the pre
liminary try-out and had shown suffi
cient ability, were given another try
out which consisted of a rehearing of
the .-voices of..the candidates and a
reading 3>y therri of the part in the
opera for which they had been tenta
tively cast. Before this was completed
for all the principals five hours had
elapsed.
The final decis'ons given be low-con
stitute what is probably the best cast
which has ever I een obtained at Stan
ford for an opera. Coach Carlyle, how
ever, reserves the right to change any
of the parts at any time ir those who
have 1 een cast for them do not show
•the expected ability.
The following were chosen:
Pony Chorus—Donna Amsden, '13,
Louise Curtice, '11, Beatrice Bingham,
'11, Miriam Bryan, '15, Carrie Sanford,
Vp-:i McXabh, '11, Mary Card, '1".

After a prolonged session, in which
all available candidates for positions
on the Junior opera cast "The Girl
and the Voice" were discussed, the
committee on Saturday picked the cast
as far as the women's leads are con
cerned. It was no easy task that con
fronted the committee, as the talent
that had been displayed was of a high
class throughout. During the morning
those who had taken part in the pre
liminary try-out and had shown suffi
cient ability, were given another try
out which consisted of a rehearing of
the .-voices of..the candidates and a
reading 3>y therri of the part in the
opera for which they had been tenta
tively cast. Before this was completed
for all the principals five hours had
elapsed.
The final decis'ons given be low-con
stitute what is probably the best cast
which has ever I een obtained at Stan
ford for an opera. Coach Carlyle, how
ever, reserves the right to change any
of the parts at any time ir those who
have 1 een cast for them do not show
•the expected ability.
The following were chosen:
Pony Chorus—Donna Amsden, '13,
Louise Curtice, '11, Beatrice Bingham,
'11, Miriam Bryan, '15, Carrie Sanford,
Vp-:i McXabh, '11, Mary Card, '1".

After a prolonged session, in which
all available candidates for positions
on the Junior opera cast "The Girl
and the Voice" were discussed, the
committee on Saturday picked the cast
as far as the women's leads are con
cerned. It was no easy task that con
fronted the committee, as the talent
that had been displayed was of a high
class throughout. During the morning
those who had taken part in the pre
liminary try-out and had shown suffi
cient ability, were given another try
out which consisted of a rehearing of
the .-voices of..the candidates and a
reading 3>y therri of the part in the
opera for which they had been tenta
tively cast. Before this was completed
for all the principals five hours had
elapsed.
The final decis'ons given be low-con
stitute what is probably the best cast
which has ever I een obtained at Stan
ford for an opera. Coach Carlyle, how
ever, reserves the right to change any
of the parts at any time ir those who
have 1 een cast for them do not show
•the expected ability.

Pony Chorus—Donna Amsden, '13,
Louise Curtice, '11, Beatrice Bingham,
