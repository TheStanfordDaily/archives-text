# NO RADICAL CHANGES MADE IN AGREEMENT
## INTERCOLLEGIATE COMMITTEE HOLDS SESSION. Boating Compact Adopted.—Crew Recognized.-Track Program Altered. —Minor Sports Considered. 
### 
Representatives from Stanford and
California composing the intercollegi
ate agreement committee held their
regular session Friday evening and
discussed various phases of the ath
letic relations of the two universities.
The men who met at the Palace Hotel
were G. J. Presley, '07, R. W. Barrett,
'04, and K. L. Schaupp, '12, of Stan
ford, and E. Brown, '99, M. T. Farmer,
'09, and C. A. Phleger, '12, of Califor
nia. N. B. Drury, '12, acted in an ad
visory capacity for the California dele
gates.
Crew races as an intercollegiate
sport were reinstalled on their former
basis. The agreement as drawn up by
boating representatives two weeks ago
was adopted. This provides for a
Varsity race of three miles and a
Freshman race of two miles. The
course chosen is the Oakland estuary.
The rival crews are to race from a lock
start, the shells being anchored in the
estuary. If the outside elements
cause the swamping of either boat the
referee shall be instructed to call a
new race. In case of accident to
equipment within fifteen strokes, a
new race is to be called. The com
mittee selected the morning of the
third baseball game between the two
universities, if such a contest is neces
sary, or the morning of the track meet
when either come to California,
weather permitting, as the date of the
annual regatta.
The mile event which has heretofore
been the first on the program of track
events, has been changed to second.
The trial heats of the hundred yard
dash will be the first of the races.
A motion was made that minor
sports be accented with the purpose of
developing them. Nothing further was
done toward recognizing basket ball
or soccer.
