# 1911 TO GIVE JOLLYUP FOR TWO UPPER CLASSES
## FEATURES WILL BE SHORT AND INHALE "STUNTS." February 10 is Date of Affairâ€”Maloney and Poor to Give Fencing Exhibition. 
### 
A jolly-up of jolly-tips, given by the
originator of jolly-ups, the class of
1911, to the two upper classes, it--
scheduled for the evening of Febru
ary 10. The distinctive feature of this
jolly-up will be a number of unique
"stunts" interpolated between dances.
As expressed by a 1911 man this after
neon, these will be "snappy, saucy
and short."
The class of 1911 will donate all
t'.ie proceeds of this affair to two in
stitutions, the Stanford Union and the
Stanford's Woman's Clubhouse. Eacli
will receive one-half of the net re
ceipts. A small charge, probably fifty
cents, will be made at the door as has
been the custom at past jolly-ups.
This jolly-up comes as a result of
a suggestion made to a number of
members of the class of 1911 now in
college. Among these are K. L. Dole,
M. E. Mitchell, P. H. Hilton, P. L.
Guerena, A. Taylor, S. E. Goode, and
C. Holcomb. The plans for the jolly
up have not yet been completed, but
112 ince the date has been secured it is
an assured fact that it will be held.
Perhaps the most interesting feature
will be a representation of a German
student duel at Heidelberg, partici
pated in by H. V. Poor, '10, and H. W.
Maloney, gymnasium instructor. This
contest promises to be fast and furious
if not gory, since both of the men are
expert in the art. Poor has lately re
turned from France and Germany,
where he has had ample opportunity
to become conversant with the methods
of dueling and fencing in vogue on
the continent. Maloney is from neither
France or Germany, but little doubt
is felt as to his ability to furnish
Poor a warm contest.
The Stanford spirit will find outlet
in yells to be given during the even
ing. These will be led by S. C. Ken
nedy, '12. A real Cardinal serpentine
will also be indulged in. While this
is in progress, numerous lights, ru
mored to be red, will shed over the
Armory and the merry makers such
glory as was never seen on land or
sea.
Other features of equal merit will
add to the merriment of the evening,
bat these are as yet shrouded in mys
tery. It is announced that soir.d of
Stanford's foremost entertainers will
appear.
