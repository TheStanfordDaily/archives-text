The editor of the Daily Palo Alto
wishes to do an injustice to 110 one.

Today, G. H. Mitchell,
former president of tht
Sophomore class and
the person responsible

for the calling of yesterday's meeting,
assured the editor that the only rea
son no notice was given through the
columns of the Daily was that the for
mality was rather carelessly over
looked.
Mitchell states that he decided on
Sunday to call a meeting Monday af
ternoon for the purpose of turning
over the chair to the incoming presi
dent, J. L. McDonald; that he had
been urged by several of his class
mates to call such a meeting. There
was no especial need which demanded
such precipate action, yet we are glad
to receive an explanation of this rather
doubtful affair.
As to politics, Mitchell disclaims all
participation in any scheme, and we
believe him.
Be that as it may, yet the fact re
mains that an attempt was made to
take advantage of the suddenly called
meeting for political purposes, and to
force nominations for the two chief
positions on the Quad when the best
interests of Class and University
dictated otherwise.
