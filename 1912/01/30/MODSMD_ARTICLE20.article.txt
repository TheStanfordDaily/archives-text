# E. G. DUDLEY ADDRESSES LOCAL FORESTRY CLUB.
## Believes That the West Should Have a Forestry School. Prefers Stanford. 
### 
That the University uf California
or Stanford, with all its natural re
sources as the favorite, is the proper
place to train men in Western forestry,
was one of the remarks made by E. G.
Dudley, '08, in his address on "Forest
Reserves," last evening before the
Forestry Club. Mr. Dudley went on
to state that the men who have been
trained in an Eastern Forestry School
are at a disadvantage when they come
to the Western forests to work, not
knowing the people or the countr.v.
"Nor is it necessary, he said, "that a
person wishing to make forest work
his occupation to go to one of these
Eastern schools. Those who have
been trained at one may start a little
higher but those who leave Stanford
may easily reach the top."
Mr. Dudley also discussed the pay
in national forest reserves, the con
dition of life, and the kind of work
being done. The methods used differ,
as do the forests themselves, from
those of any other country and are
strictly American. He said it was the
present plan not alone to make the
forest support themselves but also to
make them pay, by the sale of timber
and grazing.
