According to information received
from the north, S. H. Bellah, '10, last
season's track captain, has consented
to assist the track athletes of Lincoln
High School, Portland, by coaching
them during the spring. Bellah will
not accept any remuneration for his
services, so that he will not injure his
standing as an amateur athlete. The
ex-Cardinal trackman expects to en
ter the tryouts which will be held in
May for places on the team to repre
sent the United States in the Olympian
games at Stockholm. The former
Stanford athlete was on the All
America team which visited London
in 190 S.
