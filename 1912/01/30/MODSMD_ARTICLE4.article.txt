# DR. BRANNER GETS GEOLOGY MEDAL AWARD
## FOURTH AMERICAN TO RECEIVE THIS HONOR. Hayden Prize for Leading Work in Profession Granted to Vice-President. 
### 
Dr. J. C. Brainier,
the University vice
president and head
of the department
of Geology and
Mining, has been
made the recipient
of a signal honor.
The Hayden medal
for Geology has
been awarded to
him. This medal is
granted every three
years to the man

who leads the geological profession
it, the time of the award.
That the honor is an unusual one
can be judged by the fact that the
medal has been awarded to such
famous geologists as Geike, Chamber
lain, Wollacott, and other men who
have been authorities in the geologic
world. Dr. Branner is the fourth
American to receive the honor.
The medal is an exceptionally large
and beautiful one of gold. Hayden,
who established the award, left suffi
cient money in trust so that this
medal could be awarded once in three
years.


Dr. J. C. Branner.
