pointed campus secretary for the |
Stanford Union by Student Body pres- !
ident K. L. Schaupp. Chandler will

signed 011 account of the pressure of ;
other duties. Ambrose withdraws ;
with the satisfaction of having ac- i
complished a valuable work, while!
Chandler accepts oTice with the 111 - '
luring possibility of seeing actual j
work started on the Stanford Union I
bindings.
Ambrose's Kccord.
Ambrose was named chairman of,
the special committee to raise funds
on the campus on September 7. to sue-!
ceed H. G. Ferguson, '11. His resig-:
nation at this time comes be
cause of his heavy duties in prepara
tion for the Interscholastic meet.
During his incumbency $1700 in money
has been paid to the Stanford Union
treasury. That coming from the cam
pus was collected from the following
sources:
Holdovers $175.00
1912 100.00
1913 215.00
1914 72.50
IvTlo 205.00
Total $767.50
From this it appears that the Junior
and Freshman classes hold the places
of honor at the top of the list, while
the Sophomore class remains in se
rene possession of the bottom.
$17,000 Paid In.
Statistics of interest regarding the
present condition of the Union finances
are as follows: Total amount neces
sary, $50,000; cash needed to start
construction, $25,000. Total amount
pledged to date, $45,000; cash paid in,
$17,000.
In discussing these figures E. W.
Smith, '99, permanent secretary of the
Stanford Union, said today:
"The crying need of the Union at
this moment is more cash, it is
largely up to the fellows here on the
ground to furnish it. The alumni have
contributed splendidly considering
their general lack of wealth, but they
now look to sea something actually
done 0:1 the buildings before paying
further. The undergraduates realize
more keenly the need for the Union
than do the older graduates. In their
day tho campus life had not hecono
organized into separate forces, and
acquaintance was more informal and
general. Although I understand the
straightened financial circumstances
of the average undergraduate, the
small amount paid by the students and
recent graduates is in many respects
surprising. If they will give the pro
ject the sudden impetus necessary to
carry it to the $25,000 mark, which
must be reached in order to begin
construction, the older graduates will
no doubt take care of the rest."
I ;;;s lteing .Hade,
In anticipation of the commence
ment of work, actual planning for the
buildings has lieen under way for some
time. W. Knowles, '9(5, a successful
architect of San Francicso, is render
ing invaluable assistance by figuring
to ascertain in just what way the
greatest number of essentials can be
included in a building to cost $5000.
Knowles lias examples of his archi
tectural skill in Palo Alto and on the
the campus. He is a life member of
the Union, and is contributing his
services without charge.
Chandler, the new campus secre
tary, wil confine his efforts to stu
dents and the more recent graduates
with whom he is personally asquaint
ed.
Chandler is a History major from
Fresno and is affiliated with Encina
club. lie ii treasurer of the Guild
Association and has been upon the
football squad for two years. He is
vice-president of the Junior class.
