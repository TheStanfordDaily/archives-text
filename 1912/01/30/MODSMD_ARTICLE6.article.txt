Ambrose's Kccord.
Ambrose was named chairman of,
the special committee to raise funds
on the campus on September 7. to sue-!

nation at this time comes be
cause of his heavy duties in prepara

the Sophomore class remains in se
rene possession of the bottom.

Stanford Union, said today:

further. The undergraduates realize
more keenly the need for the Union
than do the older graduates. In their
day tho campus life had not hecono
organized into separate forces, and
acquaintance was more informal and
general. Although I understand the
straightened financial circumstances
