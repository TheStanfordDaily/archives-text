# NEW SHELL FOR CREWS BUILDING IN OAKLAND
## MODEL PAIR WILL BE PUT ON LAGUNITA SOON. Course at Redwood to be Accurately Surveyed For Full Three Miles. 
### 
Advices received today by Crew Cap
tain R. 11. Seward, '12, announce that
the new pair boat which is being built
for use on the lake by a well-known
Oakland boat-builder, is almost com
pleted and will he ready for service
as soon as active training begins on
Lagunita. The boat completes the
Stanford navy for the I!H2 season and
makes it by far the strongest that it
has ever been in the history of the
sport at the University.
The new pair is a model of its kind
and is quite different from the one used
on the lake in past seasons. The old
boat was of the barge type and was
both heavy and cumbersome. It had
none of the delicate qualities found in
a well balanced shell. The result of
Ibis was that although the old boat
was excellent for training new men,
as it was very steady in the water,
it develc.ed bad habits in them for
the same reasons. The new boat is
not a barge at all but is of the latest
approved pair oar shell type. It will
lie invaluable when used to give indi
vidual instruction to both the new
and old men, as it will require all
the nice.ties of blade and body work
to properly put the boat through the
water, and is small enough so that the
wo men composing the crew can be
under the absolute supervision of the
coxswain.
Course a< Redwood Surveyed.
It is expected that with the two pairs
and the two fours at the boat-house
on the lake, the entire squad can he
easily and thoroughly trained in a
single afternoon.
Another innovation which will ma
terially aid the men who are training
at Lagunita will be the removal of the
rowing machines from their housing
place in Encina gymnasium to the
boat-house. They will also be com
pletely gone over by an expert so that
they may be in the best possible shape
for the strenuous work which they will
have to stand up under this semester.
A new feature which will be wel
comed by the crew men is the survey
ing of the course on the slough at
Redwood. This will probably be done
the end of this week. In the past the
approximate racing distance of three
miles has been marked on the course,
but it has never been accurately gone
over. This year the distance will be
marked out, within inches of the full
three miles, and, what is more, the
half mile and mile marks will be found
for the full course. Red flags will be
placed at the mile marks and white
ones will be put at the half mile points.
During the last weeks of training when
the full course is gone over at racing
speed this will help to develops win
ning crews.

approximate racing distance of three
miles has been marked on the course,
but it has never been accurately gone
over. This year the distance will be
marked out, within inches of the full
three miles, and, what is more, the
half mile and mile marks will be found
for the full course. Red flags will be
placed at the mile marks and white
ones will be put at the half mile points.
During the last weeks of training when
the full course is gone over at racing
speed this will help to develops win
ning crews.
Advices received today by Crew Cap
tain R. 11. Seward, '12, announce that
the new pair boat which is being built
for use on the lake by a well-known
Oakland boat-builder, is almost com
pleted and will he ready for service
as soon as active training begins on
Lagunita. The boat completes the
Stanford navy for the I!H2 season and
makes it by far the strongest that it
has ever been in the history of the
sport at the University.
The new pair is a model of its kind
and is quite different from the one used
on the lake in past seasons. The old
boat was of the barge type and was
both heavy and cumbersome. It had
none of the delicate qualities found in
a well balanced shell. The result of
Ibis was that although the old boat
was excellent for training new men,
as it was very steady in the water,
it develc.ed bad habits in them for
the same reasons. The new boat is
not a barge at all but is of the latest
approved pair oar shell type. It will
lie invaluable when used to give indi
vidual instruction to both the new
and old men, as it will require all
the nice.ties of blade and body work
to properly put the boat through the
water, and is small enough so that the
wo men composing the crew can be
under the absolute supervision of the
coxswain.
Course a< Redwood Surveyed.
It is expected that with the two pairs
and the two fours at the boat-house
on the lake, the entire squad can he
easily and thoroughly trained in a
single afternoon.
Another innovation which will ma
terially aid the men who are training
at Lagunita will be the removal of the
rowing machines from their housing
place in Encina gymnasium to the
boat-house. They will also be com
pletely gone over by an expert so that
they may be in the best possible shape
for the strenuous work which they will
have to stand up under this semester.
A new feature which will be wel
comed by the crew men is the survey
ing of the course on the slough at
Redwood. This will probably be done
the end of this week. In the past the
approximate racing distance of three
miles has been marked on the course,
but it has never been accurately gone
over. This year the distance will be
marked out, within inches of the full
three miles, and, what is more, the
half mile and mile marks will be found
for the full course. Red flags will be
placed at the mile marks and white
ones will be put at the half mile points.
During the last weeks of training when
the full course is gone over at racing
speed this will help to develops win
ning crews.
