# CARNOT DEBATERS ARE SELECTED IN TRYOUTS
## TINCHER, LEIB AND SMITH TO REPRESENT CARDINAL. Team Will Meet California Saturday Evening in Harmon Gymnasium. Tucker is Alternate. 
### 
E. E. Tincher, '12, K. Leib, '13, and
E. C. Smith, '13, will represent Stan
ford against the Blue and Gold in the
annual Carnot debate Saturday even
ing. VV. Tucker, '12, will be alternate.
These men were selected at tryouts
held yesterday evening in the Chapel
and were picked from a field of eight
as the men best fitted to uphold the
honor of the Cardinal in the forum. â€¢
The question for the tryout was an
nounced yesterday afternoon at five
o'clock in the office of Professor C. H.
Huston of the Law department, as fol
lows: "Resolved, That in the recent
Moroccan controversy, Prance, rather
than Germany, was the victor."
During the time intervening before
the commencement of the tryout at
7:30, the contestants were permitted to
arrange their material to bear on this
particular question and organize their
speeches. They had previously pre
pared on the general topic, "The Rela
tion of France to Germany."
The contest was close and the spec
tators found it impossible to predict
the decision of the judges. Thorough
knowledge of the subject, coupled with
fluency, the capital combination for a
Carnot debater, also made for the suc
cess of the victorious contestants last
evening.
Faculty Members Act as Judges.
M. B. Henshaw, '12, president of
Nestoria literary society, presided at
the tryout. The judges were Profes
sor A. S. .lohnson of the Economics
department, Professor J. W. Bingham,
of the Law department, and Professor
G. H. Sabine of the Philosophy depart
ment. Fifteen minutes on the platform
was allowed each contestant. This
time was divided between two
speeches, a constructive argument and
a rebuttal, neither one of which were
allowed to be of more than four min
utes in length.
Next Saturday the three members of
this year's Carnot team will meet the
University of California representa
tives on the Harmon gymnasium plat
form in the annual Carnot debate. The
specific question will be announced
two hours before the beginning of the
debate, and will be upon some phase of
the subject, "The Relation of France
to Germany."
Of the three successful contestants
last evening, Tincher is the most ex
perienced. During his four years in
college he has gathered to himself
nearly all obtainable forensic honors,
including a place upon the inter
collegiate and Carnot teams last yp:ir
and the winning of the Mills peace
prize last semester. He is a past pre
sident of Nestoria and a member of
Delta Chi.
Two years ago Leib was a member
of his Freshman class debating team,
and has taken an active interest in
forensic work, as has his colleague,
Smith. Both are effective speakers.
Smith is enrolled in Encina club.
Tucker is a former president of Eu
phronia, with allegiance to Delta Chi.
