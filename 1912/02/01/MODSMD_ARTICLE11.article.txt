Have you the immense sum of two
dollars in your jeans? If you have,

you can become a member of the
Associated Student body, vote at
elections, and free of charge
twenty-four ball games and live

track meets. One dollar goes in pay
ment ot' the semi-annual Student body
dues. For the other dollar you receive
eight dollars worth of fun at baseball
games and track meets.
It is rather a pitiable showing an
institution the size ol' Stanford makes,
when, out of a registration of 1561,
only (!")5 are members of the Student
body. There seems to be plenty of
spirit and enthusiasm when a rally
is held and the average undergraduate
bubbles over with excitement when
some athletic contest with California
is near, but not very many enthuse
over the payment, of dues.
The campaign is now on to increase
the membership to 1000. Within the
next few days collectors will approach
every student in the University. Don't
put them off with some trivial excuse
but fulfill your obligations to the Stu
dent body by the purchase of a season
ticket.
If you cannot afford the two dollars
for one of these tickets, at least pay
your dues.
