# UNDERCLASS DEBATE TO BE HELD ON TUESDAY.
## Innovation in Time Allotment for Speakers Made.â€”Each Class Has Strong Team. 
### 
An innovation will mark the annual
underclass debate, scheduled for next
Tuesday evening, in the allotting of a
longer time to the speakers than has
bean customary. Fourteen minutes for
the first five arguments with nineteen
minutes for the last sneaker 0:1 the
negative and a five minute affirmative
rebuttal will be the nsw arrange
ment. This additional time is mads
necessary by the comprehensive na
ture of the question, "Resolved, That
popular recall should be applied to
judges, constitutionality granted."
This interclass struggle bids fair
to be close, since the trios are evenly
matched. The Sophomore debaters in
clude two members nf the team which
last year defeated the 1913 represent
atives, while one of the Freshmen,
Higgins, has already won his spur* ii
a Varsity intercollegiate contest. Th?
teams are as follows: Sophomore?
