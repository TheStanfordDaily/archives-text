# Solicitors From Encina, Roble, and Row Will Attempt to Bring Student Body Membership to 1000.
## 
### 
Do you like to see a baseball game
now and then? When you so to a
game do you crawl over the fence to
save two-bits? How would you like
to go to twenty-four baseball games
and five track meets for one dollar?
If this looks good to you, buy a season
ticket.
One minute, gentle reader! The
campaign is 0:1 for "1000 MEMBERS
OR BUST." For the second semester
1561 students have registered in this
University. Of the.-e students 655 have
purchased season tickets. Therefore
about 900 have not! In which of these
classes do you belong?
California sets the world's pace for
booms. Are you a Californian in
spirit? Its boom time right here anrt
now! "1000 Members or Bust" is the
slogan! You must be one of the 1000,
■ o get your two dollars ready.
Tomorrow the campaign is off in
full swing. Canvassers will go
through Encina, Itoble and Madrono
Malls. Other groups will work on the
row. Behind them is the Executive
Committee, giving the official backing
of the Associated Students.
What is the object of all this? Stan
ford has one of the finest athletic
equipments and fields in the collegi
ate world and her climate is not ex
celled anywhere. All of the equip
ment has been purchased by the funds
accruing from the Student Body as
sessments and the gate receipts at
games. To maintain the place that
we have now reached wa must have
funds, and, above all, the undivided
support of every student. It is neces
sary that at least two-thirds of the en
rolled students give their financial
backing. Be one of the 1000.
Pause for a minute! Suppose that
all athletic contests at Stanford were
abolished because the students were

not willing to lend their financial
backing to them. Yon would feel
rather badly, wouldn't you? Do yon de
sire a Greater Stanford? Then get a
Season ticket.
When the collectors were being ap
pointed for each of the houses on the
row, it was found that in one house
every one had a season ticket. But
this house was the only one! Get
your house in line!
Remember that every ball game and
track meet, and there are twenty-nine
of them, will cost you twenty-five
cents to witness. Yon can buy a sea
son ticket for two dollars. The season
ticket not only admits you to these
games but makes you a full-fledged
member of the Student Body, entitling
you to a vote at elections, to represent
Stanford on any team and to receive
its emblems.

Stanford on any team and to receive
its emblems.
Do you like to see a baseball game
now and then? When you so to a
game do you crawl over the fence to
save two-bits? How would you like
to go to twenty-four baseball games
and five track meets for one dollar?
If this looks good to you, buy a season
ticket.
One minute, gentle reader! The
campaign is 0:1 for "1000 MEMBERS
OR BUST." For the second semester
1561 students have registered in this
University. Of the.-e students 655 have
purchased season tickets. Therefore
about 900 have not! In which of these
classes do you belong?
California sets the world's pace for
booms. Are you a Californian in
spirit? Its boom time right here anrt
now! "1000 Members or Bust" is the
slogan! You must be one of the 1000,
■ o get your two dollars ready.
Tomorrow the campaign is off in
full swing. Canvassers will go
through Encina, Itoble and Madrono
Malls. Other groups will work on the
row. Behind them is the Executive
Committee, giving the official backing
of the Associated Students.
What is the object of all this? Stan
ford has one of the finest athletic
equipments and fields in the collegi
ate world and her climate is not ex
celled anywhere. All of the equip
ment has been purchased by the funds
accruing from the Student Body as
sessments and the gate receipts at
games. To maintain the place that
we have now reached wa must have
funds, and, above all, the undivided
support of every student. It is neces
sary that at least two-thirds of the en
rolled students give their financial
backing. Be one of the 1000.
Pause for a minute! Suppose that
all athletic contests at Stanford were
abolished because the students were

not willing to lend their financial
backing to them. Yon would feel
rather badly, wouldn't you? Do yon de
sire a Greater Stanford? Then get a
Season ticket.
When the collectors were being ap
pointed for each of the houses on the
row, it was found that in one house
every one had a season ticket. But
this house was the only one! Get
your house in line!
Remember that every ball game and
track meet, and there are twenty-nine
of them, will cost you twenty-five
cents to witness. Yon can buy a sea
son ticket for two dollars. The season
ticket not only admits you to these
games but makes you a full-fledged
member of the Student Body, entitling
you to a vote at elections, to represent
Stanford on any team and to receive
its emblems.
