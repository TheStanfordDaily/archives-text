# CARNOT DEBATERS TO CLASH ON SATURDAY
## CALIFORNIA AND STANFORD WILL CONTEST. Tincher, Smith and Leib to Represent Stanford in Annual Prize Forensic Contest. 
### 
Three Stanford representatives will
meet the same number of speakers
from the University of California
Saturday evening on the Harmon gym
nasium platform in the eighteenth an
nual Carnot debate. The Cardinal
team will include E. E. Tlncher, * 12,
K. Leib, '13, and E. C. Smith, '13. The
California trio consists of T. I?. Kitt
redge, Ml', L. E. Goodman, '13, and M.
Marks, 14. W. Tucker, '12, and J. G.
Sweet, '12, will be the respective al
ternates.
The Stanford team was chosen last
Tuesday evening, while that of Cali
fornia was selected more than a week
earlier. Both teams are strong, the
members being skilled in the pecu
liar variety of speaking necessitated
by the hard conditions of a Carnot
contest. The California trio is regard
ed as most formidable. Kittredge and
Goodman held a place on the Inter
collegiate team last fall, while Marks
was alternate on last year's Carnot
trio.
Owing to a misunderstanding, the
Stanford debating authorities had ex
pected that the Carnot would be held
at a considerably later date. Owing
to this fact, it was necessary to hold
the tryout on short notice, and since
that time the debaters have had only
three days to prepare themselves for
the contest. To overcome this handi
cap they have worked earnestly during
the week, and chances are at least
even that that much valued piece of
.jewelry, the Carnot medal, will again
visit Stanford. The Cardinal orators
who have already won it include R. L.
Sandwich, '9ft, W. A. Morris, '01, P. 15.
Wagner, '02, A. F. Sheriffs, '05, W. F.
Ilerron, '<>7, \V. C. Shelton, '08, and
.). E. Shelton, '00.
The debate will be held at 7:30
Saturday evening, in the Harmon gym
nasium at Berkeley. The specilic
question will be announced two hours
before that time, and will be selected
from the general topic. "The Relation
of France to Germany."
