Equal opportunity is the watchword
of the day. Why not have equal

opportunity at Stanford?
We have democracy in
practically every phase of

college life except in social affairs,
and here the possession of a dress suit
or the ability to borrow one is the
open sesame.
Now, we readily agree that a dress
suit is well enough in its place, but
its place is not the Assembly Hall.
As the custom stands, the possession
of one of these sartorial monstrosities
is an absolute prerequisite to the pur
chase of first floor tickets to any
theatrical production.
We cannot understand why this
rather outworn custom of wearijug
dress suits at plays should persist
here, when it prevails at no other
place. It is certain that the seat sales
would be almost doubled if sanity and
democracy would place the taboo upon
the ridiculous habit.
The production of "The Admirable
Crichton" next Friday night will afford
an excellent opportunity to pick out
the weak brothers who are unable to
break away from old and foolish cus
tims. Those wearing dress suits will
be branded by their action as lacking
that democracy which we like to be
lieve is essential to the Stanford spirit.
