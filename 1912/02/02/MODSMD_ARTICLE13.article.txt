Not for several years has a Stanford
man won the coveted Carnot medal,

nor a Stanford team taken
an intercollegiate debate.
This is not the fault of the

debaters, for they have worked in a
wholesouled manner in their chosen
field. The fault, if any, rests on the
lack of support given by the under
graduates.
To-morrow night, three good de
baters will try to wrest victory from
California in the Carnot medal con
test. If you want to see Stanford win,
back these men up in their efforts by
attending the debate.
