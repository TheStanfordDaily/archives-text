# "THE ADMIRABLE CRICHTON" HAS INTERESTING PLOT.
## A
						Servant Proves to Be the Man of the Hour on a Desert Isle, in Coming Masquers' Production. 
### 
The seat sale for the "Admirable
Crichton," by .1. \l. Barrie, will start
on Monday morning. The sale stalls
simultaneously at S o'clock at the
Bookstore on the campus and Wein
sartner's in Palo Alto.
The plot of the delightful play is
as follows:
The first scene of "The Admirable
Crichton" shows an amusing and
whimsical scene in the drawing room
of the Earl of Loam. It is one of the
old Earl's theories that we are all
equal, and to show his democracy he
entertains his servants at tea each
month, his three daughters entertain
and wait upon them. At this tea par
ly. the Karl's r; al insincerity is shown
by tfn indignation with which he
greets any of the servants who pre
sume to treat him with a semblance
of equality.
\ Trip siii(l Troubles.
The three daughters, languid and
bored, endure the party as best they
can. They show no interest in any
thing until their father announces he
intends to take them on a yachting
trip and that he can allow them only
one maid. This decision greatly ex-
the young ladies but they
li M ally consent.
Troubles now come. Not one of
their maids will go. Crichton, the
head butler, proposes that they take
Tweeny, a little kitchen wench. The
'laushters finally agree to this, but
Twre'iy refuse-* unless Crichton is also
if the party. Then Crichton is per
suaded to accompany them as the
MitT*; valet.

Dii a Desert Isle.
The second act opens with all the
yachting party, except the old Earl
himself, wrecked upon a desert is
land. They are a most miserable crew.
No one has shoes. Crichton is the
only member of the party who seems to
have any resource or hopefulness. He
builds a fire and begins to cook the
little food they have managed to save.
Subtlely the impression is given that
Crichton is taking command, and is
changing from servant to master.
Crichton's Triumph.
At last the old Earl joins the party
after he has been wandering alone
ui)on the island for some time. He
tries to take command of the party,
and, failing, sends Crichton away.
Crichton, however, refuses to leave on
the grounds that they all need him.
Then Lady Mary departs rebelloiusly
to the other end of the island, taking
the rest of the party with her. Crich
ton sits down quietly and waits. One
by one they straggle back, drawn by
the odor of the cooking food. Lady
Mary is the last to come, and realizing
that it means surrender she drops
down upon the rocks and bursts into
tears.
In the third act a great change has
come over the company. Crichton has
built a wonderful house with most
ingenious furnishings. Crichton is
king. The survivors almost worship
him, and the trirls are very jealous o"
!iis favorite. Lady Mary.
.hist after Crichton tells Lady Mary
oT his love for her and they are about


tin: TRir.Mrii of ckichton.
