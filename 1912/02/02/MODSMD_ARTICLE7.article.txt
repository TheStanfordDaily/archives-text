For the second time this season, the
Olympic Club will send their ball team
against Stanford to-morrow afternoon
at I! o'clock. Admission, 25c.
The Varsity opened the season
against this team two weeks ago, and
won handily 10-3. Since then, the
city men have strengthened their
team considerably and should play a
much improved game to-morrow.
As the season's record now stands,
Stanford has won two out of the four
games played, but these games won
were the first two. It is Captain Gil
fillan's intention to make every effort
possible to win the odd game to-mor
row and thus keep on the right side
of the percentage.
Freshman Couch will start the game
in the box, while Jones anil Enderle
will be on hand to relieve him during
the afternoon. Both Scofield and
Dent will work during the game, al

same as that which started Wednes
day, with the exception of Henshaw,
who will play first.
