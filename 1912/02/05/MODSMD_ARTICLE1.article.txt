# OLYMPIC CLUB FALLS BEFORE VARSITY TEAM
## LIGHT HITTING MARKS SECOND GAME OF SERIES. Stanford Shuts Out Visitors and Piles Up Four Runs.—Terry's Playing a Feature. 
### 
For the second time this season
Stanford defeated the Olympic Club 011
Saturday 4-0.
The game was marked by exception
a'ly light batting and as a result there
were many strike-outs 011 both sides.
Girot ot' the visitors is credited with
fourteen, while Couch fooled the city
men twelve times. Not a fly ball was
hit to the field until the ninth inning,
when the last out of the game was
caught in left. There we'e a number
of line drives cut. off during the after
neon by the infielders, but the work of
Terry in the last inning was the best
cf them all. With one down, Work
man smashed a liner that sounded as
ii' it wore to be the last hit of the day,
The ball shot over the short-stop's
head, but with a dive into the air he
caught the ball with his gloved hand.
At the bat, this same player was the
star of the afternoon, gettng three hits
out of four times up and scoring two
runs.
Freshman Couch pitched shut-out
ball against the visitors and allowed
them but two hits. Not an Olympic
man reached third-base during the
afternoon, and only in one inning were
they at all dangerous. In the fifth
inning Couch retired the side 011 thret
strike-outs while Girot did the same
to Stanford in the eighth.
Peters Changes Line-up.
Coach Peters changed his line-up be
fore the game by putting Obear on
first base, Gault in left, and Noble in
right. Scofleld caught the entire
game.
The Varsity started the game in a
rush and immediately took the lean.
Terry opened the play by beating out.
a slow bounder and immediately stolb
second. Obear followed suit and
singled through second, scoring Terr.v
and taking second 011 the throw in.
Gi.fillan fanned and Obear went to
third 011 a passed ball but got no fm
ther as Gault and Cass ended the
inning.
During the third frame, three more
r:n:r were added. Couch, first man up,
reached first on Workman's error.
Terry singled to right and both run
ners advanced a peg when Watson
juggled the ball. Obear hit to short
who failed to cot Couch off at the
plate. Obear stole second and a mo
ment. later both he and Terry scored
on Rutledge's wild throw to third. The
next three men went out in order.
The fourth inning was the visitor's
one chance which they failed to seize.
With two down Workman beat out an
infield hit. Watson followed with a
single to left. Here Rippon was sub
stituted for Tallant but the best he
could do was to knock a liner at Cass
which retired the side.
Five Substitutes Given Chance.
In the last innings, five new men
were introduced by Coach Peters in
his endeavor to give as many as pos
sible a chance to play.
Any previous reputation that Spike
Hennessey may have had as an um
pire did not awe the crowd, for all)
during the afternoon his judgment was
bad and was the subject of much com
ment from the bleachers.
