# Byrnes Compliments Varsity Nine.
## 
### 
That Stanford lias a ball team that
is already showing up exceptionally
well and is stronger than the one of a
year ago, is the substance of a state
ment by Jimmy Byrnes, formerly with
the Athletics and now catching for
Ireland's Independents.
The new diamond also comes in for
a word of praise from the leaguer, who
wa-i much impressed with the perfec
tion of its drainage system.
