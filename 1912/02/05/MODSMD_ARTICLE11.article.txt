# TRACK RECORD BROKEN IN YEAR'S FIRST MEET
## MURRAY TRAVELS THREE LAPS IN FAST TIME. Relay Race Resulted in Tie Between Teams Lead by Campbell and Taylor. 
### 
But twice before in the history Oj.
track athletes at Stanford has a Car
dinal runner bettered the time made
Saturday morning in the three laps of
the shortened mile. To cover this
distance in the excellent time of three
minutes and twenty-one seconds
would be remarkable much later in
the season. The performance of R. L.
Murray, *12, winner of the event,
stamps him as a runner to be reckon
ed with in the intercollegiate meet.
W. D. Fletcher, '11, pressed Murray
throughout the race and but a few
feet separated them at the finish.
The relay furnished the greatest ex
citement of the morning and the
judges were compelled to declare the
race a dead heat. E. P. Campbell, '13,
running the last lap for his team,
overcame a ten yard lead of his op
ponent, C. C. Taylor, '11, and raced the
veteran to a tie. No time was taken.
In almost every event the marks
made far excelled those of the initial
meet of the 1911 season. W. R. Fin
ney, '12, took the high jump at 5 feet,
10 inches, and the pole vault was won
at 10 feet, 10 inches by C. Boulware,
'14.
