### 
For seven years the Stanford Inter
scholastic meet has been the most

important gathering of
preparatory school ath
letes on the coast. Hun
dreds of men, coming from

all parts of the west, have received
their first impressions of college life
at these meets. Returning home they
have carried with them not only a de
sire to attend the University, hut also
a cleaner ideal of sportsmanship.
To keep the number of lnterscholas
tic entries up to the high level reached
during the last two years, it will be
necessary for everyone to co-operate.
Do not leave all of the work and worry
to the secretary of the Association.
Hack up his efforts by writing home to
your friends urging them to attend
the meet.
