# DR. JORDAN DEFENDS BALLOT SCRATCHING.
## "To Vote a Straight Ticket, Mark Off The Crooked Names," Says President. 
### 
"I am a Republican," said Presi
dent Jordan in an informal talk on
politics before the men of the Univer
sity, assembled in Encina Club room,
Sunday evening, "and in order that 1
may vote a straight ticket, I scratcr.
the crooked names off. If there are
bad men on both sides, I vote for the
man on the other side, so that his
party will get the blame for his
actions."
He criticised the method of voting
in groups of more than one, subject
to other peoples wills, and stated that
every one ought to think for himself.
He said that men ought not to bind
themselves too closely to one party,
but be as Abraham Lincoln, who said
he was like a maverick calf, without
a mark or brand on him; but the col
lege man ought to register with a par
ty, in order to vote at the primaries.
In affirming that the tariff was a bad
thing for the country, lie said, "The
tariff was originally made to help in
fant industries to rise, but when they '
grew up into large flourishing corpora
tions, they still wanted their baby
food, which is no longer needed, to
serve the purpose for which it wa:
made."
He showed that any measures
which gave to a corporation a privi
lege, without a return for such privi
lege, should not be passed, and that
the aim of the Progressives is to cur
tail such measures.
L. D. Summerfield, '12, president of
Encina Club and editor of the Cha
parral, presided at the meeting.
