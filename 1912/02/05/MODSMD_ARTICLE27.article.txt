# GYM CLUB DANCE IS IN NATURE OF A BENEFIT.
## Apparatus For Use of Club in Their Public Appearances to be Purchased. 
### 
The Gym Club dance, to be held in
Palo Alto, Friday, February 16, is in
the nature of a benefit affair. The
proceeds from the dance are to be
used to purchase a piece ot' portable
gymnasium apparatus which can be
used by the members of the club when
they appear outside the gymnasium in
their vaudeville and entertaining acts.
As a rule exists that prevents the
removal of any apparatus from the
gymnasium without going through a
dilatory and tedious procedure of se
curing permission from the powers
that be, the members of the club have
often been compelled to give their per
formances in the past without appar
atus.
