# POOR EXHIBITS GROUP OF STRONG CANVASES
## GRADUATE SHOWS RARE ABILITY IN ALL MEDIUMS. Work of Unusual Excellence Will be Open to the Public This Week. By A.B. Clark. 
### 
On Saturday afternoon, H. V. Poor,
'10, at present instructor in the De
partment of Graphic Arts, invited
guests to an exhibition of paintings
and sketches which he has made since
leaving Stanford 111 May, 1910. The
exhibition was held in the old studio.
The collection comprised forty-three
oil paintings, lands capes, and paintings
of the head; a few charcoal studies of
the figure, several sketches of studio
group figures in pencil, and sketches
in pencil and crayon of boats, wind
mills, etc., from Holland.
The attendance Saturday was upon
invitation, but the exhibit is open to
the public throughout the present
week.
Large Xlllll her of Drawings.
Possibly the first impression one re
ceives is astonishment at the number
of canvasses, showing, as they do, days
and days of work. Poor has not been
idle during the past eighteen months.
The next characteristic note is the
simple, frank decision and conviction
of each painting and drawing.
Most of them are simple in en
deavor, and none of them try to go
beyond the knowledge and experience
of the painter. It is rare indeed to find
all pretense and strain and meaning
less subterfuge absent.
A few canvasses show considerable
elaboration, such as the "Self Por
trait," which would hold its own and
be a pleasing addition to any exhibi
tion in America or abroad.
Likewise in the portrait of an elderly
man reading, anyone can enjoy its ease
of attitude, while those who know the
sitter are even more pleased with the
likeness.
Local Sketches Interesting.
Among the many landscapes of this
vicinity, the sketches of Felt Lake are
especially charming with a happy
sentiment of fall weather. And the
sketches at Half Moon Bay show a
grasp of essentials of water and rocks.
The largest canvass is nine by four
feet, and shows the idealized Califor
nia landscape. This is designed for
the living-room of a home in Kansas
City.
The paintings of boats and bridges
made in Paris and London are good
examples of straight-forward tech
nique and harmonious color in a low
key. One popular Parisian sketch is
of two heavy draft horses with the
driver and cart, extremely strong in
ine.
Students were interested to see the
figure drawings which were expon
ents of thorough depiction of form, the
kind which justly gives the French
schools their position of leadership.
Indeed, as was said at the begin
ning, the exhibit shows some paintings
which have achieved remarkable ex
cellence. It is even more gratifying
to note the clear, sound point of few
and straight-forward means of ex
pression which is the surest guaran
tee of greater excellence in the paint
ings to follow.

schools their position of leadership.
Indeed, as was said at the begin

On Saturday afternoon, H. V. Poor,
'10, at present instructor in the De
partment of Graphic Arts, invited
guests to an exhibition of paintings
and sketches which he has made since
leaving Stanford 111 May, 1910. The
exhibition was held in the old studio.
The collection comprised forty-three
oil paintings, lands capes, and paintings
of the head; a few charcoal studies of
the figure, several sketches of studio
group figures in pencil, and sketches
in pencil and crayon of boats, wind
mills, etc., from Holland.
The attendance Saturday was upon
invitation, but the exhibit is open to
the public throughout the present
week.
Large Xlllll her of Drawings.
Possibly the first impression one re
ceives is astonishment at the number
of canvasses, showing, as they do, days
and days of work. Poor has not been
idle during the past eighteen months.
The next characteristic note is the
simple, frank decision and conviction
of each painting and drawing.
Most of them are simple in en
deavor, and none of them try to go
beyond the knowledge and experience
of the painter. It is rare indeed to find
all pretense and strain and meaning
less subterfuge absent.
A few canvasses show considerable
elaboration, such as the "Self Por
trait," which would hold its own and
be a pleasing addition to any exhibi
tion in America or abroad.
Likewise in the portrait of an elderly
man reading, anyone can enjoy its ease
of attitude, while those who know the
sitter are even more pleased with the
likeness.
Local Sketches Interesting.
Among the many landscapes of this
vicinity, the sketches of Felt Lake are
especially charming with a happy
sentiment of fall weather. And the
sketches at Half Moon Bay show a
grasp of essentials of water and rocks.
The largest canvass is nine by four
feet, and shows the idealized Califor
nia landscape. This is designed for
the living-room of a home in Kansas
City.
The paintings of boats and bridges
made in Paris and London are good
examples of straight-forward tech
nique and harmonious color in a low
key. One popular Parisian sketch is
of two heavy draft horses with the
driver and cart, extremely strong in
ine.
Students were interested to see the
figure drawings which were expon
ents of thorough depiction of form, the
kind which justly gives the French
schools their position of leadership.
Indeed, as was said at the begin
ning, the exhibit shows some paintings
which have achieved remarkable ex
cellence. It is even more gratifying
to note the clear, sound point of few
and straight-forward means of ex
pression which is the surest guaran
