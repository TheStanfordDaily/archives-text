# ASSEMBLY IS SCHEDULED FOR THURSDAY MORNING
## President Jordan Will Speak on "The Unseen Empire of Finance," at 11:15 Period. 
### 
"The Unseen Empire of Finance,"
will be the subject upon which Presi
dent Jordan will talk to the students
of the University in the Assembly Hall
at 11:15 Thursday morning.
In many of his talks before the stu
dents, Doctor Jordan has shown in a
small way how the affairs of many na
tions are run by this invisible power,
which is in a large measure controlled
by the House of Rothschild.
For some time he has been deeply
interested in this very important and
little understood subject, and in this
Assembly he will tell the University
public the farts which have been re
vealed by some of his recent investi
gations.
