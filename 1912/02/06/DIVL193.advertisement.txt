All the comforts —
When good fellows get together—
then Velvet is supreme This su
perb leaf has hung in the warehouse
over two years —a tremendous
change —all harshness is nullified —

what a smoke! It's too smooth to
bite —too mellow to be anything but
the best smoke on earth. That's why
it's called Velvet. One tin is a
revelation. At all dealers.
