Stanford's cinder path, the fastest
in the West, has been chosen by the
committee of seven which has charge
of the try-outs for the team to repre
sent America in the Olympian games
at Stockholm next July. Chairman
Elliott of the Pacific Coast selection
committee announces that the mem
bers of the committee have agreed on
the Stanford track by unanimous vote.
The date of the try-outs has been set
as May 18. One representative on the
committee, A. S. Goldsmith of Seattle,
objected to the date and bis objection
may be taken under consideration
later. The objection on the grounds
that this dafp was too early for th<t
northwestern athletes is not well taken
■is the University of Washington and
Oregon will send teams to the confer
ence meet at Berkeley on May 4.
Elliott, who is president of the Pa
cific Athletic Association, also gave a
ruling on the case of S. 11. ilellah, '10,
former Cardinal track captain. He!-
'•th will be allowed to compete as a
member of the Multnomah Club of
Portland. It was thought that hr
