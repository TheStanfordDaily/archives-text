# SCENERY HAS ARRIVED FOR MASQUERS' PLAY
## PROPERTIES OF THE ALCAZAR MAY BE USED. Electric Lighting Will be One of the Features of "The Admirable Crichton." 
### 
In"The Admirable Crichton" J. M.
Harris has expressed the same whim
sical and delightful humor that has
charmed bis readers in"The Little
Mininster" and "Peter Pan." It is
one of his very finest plays and affords
excellent opportunities for its cast.
Harrie lovers will find that it is per
fectly typical of all his work with a
most skilful blending of fun and sad
ness.
A splendid array of scenery has
come down from San Francisco. Most
interesting skins of wild animals and
3trange pieces of furniture have ar
rived to be used in the rude hut in the
third act. Real poisoned arrows and
r:u\> ;ea animals will add to the reality
jf the scene. The Alcazar theatre in
San Francisco produced the same play
recently and they have offered to lend
any of their properties. This makes
it possible for the Masquers to have a
real professional finish to their set
tings.
Marsh grass, palms and banana
trees will furnish a tropical atmos
nhere in the out-door scene. The
island will lie a masterpiece of stage
work ma nship.
The lighting will be most compli
cated. Over four hundred dollars have
been snent for this feature and elec
tricians have been at work for a week.
The electrical effects are more elabor
ate than have ever been arranged in
tbp Assembly Hall before.
