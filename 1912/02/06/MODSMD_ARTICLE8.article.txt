# WOMEN BUY FORTY-ONE MORE SEASON TICKETS.
## Loyal Support Given to Campaign to Increase Funds in Student Body Treasury. 
### 
Substantial support is being given to
the Student Body by at least one class
of loyal Stanfordites. At the present
time it is hardly an exaggeration to
state that every woman student on the
campus is the possessor of a season
ticket. During the present campaign
41 tickets have been sold in the vari
ous houses and sororities. In at
least three of these houses it is known
that there is not a woman now unÂ»
supplied with tickets.
