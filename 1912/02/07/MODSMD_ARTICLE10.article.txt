The announcement of the Assembly
speakers for the present semester

comes as a relief. Ever
since the memorable oc
casion when a pseudo

orator, painfully devoid of terminal
facilities, doled out platitudes on
prison reform, we have been rather
suspicious of the gentlemen destined
to address the Assemblies.
This year, however, our fears are
groundless, for the list of speakers
made public today by Chairman Treat
of the Faculty Committee on Public
Exercises, contains only men of na
tional reputation and great ability.
The Assembly to-morrow morning
at which Dr. Jordan speaks on "The
Unseen Empire of Finance," is the
first of this series of interesting and
enlightening talks.
To miss it, will be to miss one lec-i
ture in what promises to be the best
course of the semester.
