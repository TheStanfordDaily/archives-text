# FULL DISTANCES WILL BE RUN IN SECOND MEET
## TRACKMEN WILL COMPETE ON SATURDAY MORNING. Indications Point to Fast Races.â€”List of Officials Will be Announced Later. 
### 
Stanford trackmen will again be
seen in competition in the second of
the regular Saturday meets 011 the
coming week-end. The full distances
in every event will be run. The Var
sity, Freshmen and novices are all to
be given an opportunity to enter races
in their respective classes. All of the
veteran Cardinal athletes are expected
to compete.
Because of the good weather the men
who have been training on the cinder
path since the opening rally are for
the most part in mid-semester condi
tion. The excellent time made in many
of the events last Saturday showed
that the athletes would be benefited
by making the races the regulation
distances. This is somewhat of an in
novation, as in the past the general
rule has been for the early meets to
be conducted 011 a smaller scale.
Every man who has been doing regu
lar work under "Dad" is expected to
compete Saturday morning. The field
events will also be run off as in the
regular meets.
Captain T. L. Coleman, '12, has not
yet completed all arrangements for
the meet and has yet to announce the
list of officials.
Excellent Performances Assured.
Indications point to some excellent
performances in this second meeting
on the Stanford oval. Several of the
Freshmen candidates have shown to
advantage during the past week.
Some of the men who were ineligible
last season because of various reasons
have come to the front rapidly in the
few weeks of training and should be
able to better many of the early sea
son records established in previous
meets. Relay runners will again have
a chance to furnish excitement for
the spectators as several teams will
be entered Saturday in this event.
