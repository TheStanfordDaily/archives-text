# FRESHMEN ARE VICTORS IN UNDERCLASS DEBATE
## Sophomore Representatives Close, Castle and Smith Are Defeated by Coyle, Kilcline and Higgins After Interesting Forensic Contest. 
### 
For the third consecutive time the
Freshmen won from their red-hatted
enemies in the annual underclass de
bate, when the 1915 representatives
defeated the Sophomore speakers in
the Chapel last evening by a vote of
two judges to one. "Resolved, That
judges should be subject to popular
recall, constitutionality granted," was
the mooted question. The rival classes
were represented by C. C. Close, O. H.
Castle, and T. L. Smith for tho Sopho
mores; A. F. Coyle, W. H. Kilcline,
and P. L. Higgins for the Freshmen.
The precedent of a Freshman
forensic victory was started three
years ago when the 191?. speakers won
from 1912. They were in turn de
f'at 'd by the 1914 team, which in
cluded two of the speakers last even
ing, Close and Castle. Last evening
19in did its part toward firmly estab
lishing the custom.
Sophomores I'phold Negative.
The Sophomores upheld the affirma
tive of the question and seemed to suf
fer from the hoodoo which has attend
ed that side of the argument in the
various debates when the topic has
been discussed. Failure to discharge
fully the burden of proof incumbent
u;>o*i them was perhaps largely re
sponsible for their defeat. Although
the decision met with the favor ol
the audience the debate was close and
of great interest throughout.
Smith opened for the affirmative and
capably sketched the general princi
ples and historical background upon

which the argument of his side would
rest. He was replied to by Coyle, who,
in a well presented argument showed
perhaps the soundest reasoning and
rncst thorough grasp of the subject of
the evening.
Close, in a convincingly delivered and
scholarly argument, showed the man
ner in which the courts have usurped
legislative power. Kilcline explained
the distinction between the recall as
applied to judges and as applied to
other officials. This is Kilcline's first
debate and he showed fine promise, do
ing his work effectively. Castle took
as his theme the fact that the recall
would be safe in the hands of the
people. In a speech largely refutation,
the issue was sketched and for the
first time a direct clash of argument
between affirmative and negative
brought about. Higgins replied for the
negative and his splendid stage pres
ence, forcible delivery and fluent re
buttal work made a favorable impres
sion. Close was next heard in a five
minute rebuttal of unusual fluency and
effectiveness.
Faculty Members Were Judges.
The judges last evening were Pro
fessor E. E. Robinson of the History
department, Professor P. ,T. Treat of
the History department, and W. A.
Shedd, Principal of the Manzanita
School. E. E. Tincher, '12, of the in
tersociety debating committee pre
sided. A good sized audience of sup
porters of the respective teams was in
evidence.
