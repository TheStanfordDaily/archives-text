## INQUIRIES ALREADY ALREADY RECEIVED FROM DISTANT POINTS. Northern Trackmen Interested in Interscholastic Contests-Entertainments for Visitors. 
### 
Between forty-five and fifty prepara
tory schools are expected to be repre
sented at the seventh annual inter
scholastic meet of the Stanford inter
scholastic association, to be held 011
April 13. Letters of inquiry have been
received from institutions as far north
as Seattle and as far east as Salt Lake
City. The trackmen from the city of
Brigham Young were to have been in
the competition last year but were un
able to come because of unforeseen
circumstances. This year a crack
team may be sent to the meet.
Plans are being made for the enter
tainment of the visitors during their
stay on the campus. As has been the
custom in previous years the men from
the secondary sell wis will be the
guests of the Student Body and will
he quartered in the fraternity houses
and in Encina. On the evening of the
meet, a vaudeville show will furnish
ample amusement in Encina club
room.
The presentation of cups and
trophies to the winners of the various
events is to take place during the in
termission between the different stunts
which will be of such a nature as are
suitable after a day of close competi
tion. Some one of the Stanford or
ganizations will direct the show and
have charge of the selection of the
stunts.
