# Lecture oil Oriental Philosophy.

### 
Explaining in a wonderfully clear
and logical manner, the history and
meaning of the various philosophical
doctrines of India, Har Dyal, graduate
of Punjab and Oxford universities,
spoke last evening on "Systems of
Oriental Philosophy." The philo
sophical evolution of India was divided
by the speaker into five historical peri
ods. Each of these groups represent
ed, go the speaker said, an advance
in philosophical thought up to and
including the fourth period of Mon
ism. The fifth and final period, em
bracing Philosophical Theism and
Eclecticism, is in Dyal's opinion a re
version to a less perfect system.
