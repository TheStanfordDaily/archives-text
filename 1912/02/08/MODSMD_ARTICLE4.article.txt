promptly at eight o'clock on Friday
night. The length of the play neces
sitates this change from the regular
time of starting.
Miss Workman, in the role of Lady
Mary, i3 surprising all of her ad
mirers with her splendid work. With
so much expected of her she needs to
show exceptional skill in order to live
up to the reputation that she has
made for herself. The part of Lady
Mary gives a fine chance for versa
tility. It is difficult to play but ex
ceedingly effective. Lady Mary is
unlike any character that Miss Work

man has portrayed before but her suc
cess has been very marked.
R. H. Seward, '12, has a role in that
of Crichton splendidly suited to him.
His quiet dignity as the perfect Eng
lish butler, and his almost royal im
periousness as king of the island,
show his powers to great advantage.
Miss N. Moise, '12, plays the role of
the Dowager Brocklehurst in a way
that shows her skill and experience.
Miss Moise took part in"The Com
promise" and in the Miracle Plays of
last year.
Miss F. Wendling, '12, showed her
self worthy of the part that she plays,


SCENE FROM ACT IV, "THE ADMIRABLE C RICH TON."
ot' one of the Earl of Loam's daugh
ters, in the dramatic work that she
has done in former years. She proved
her ability in the 1912 Sophomord
play and in"The Devil's Disciple."
The third daughter of the Earl of
Loam is portrayed by Miss D. Parkin
son, '13. Miss Parkinson has given'
the Stanford audience a treat both in
her work in the 1913 Sophomore play
and in"The World and His Wife," last
semester.
S. Brown, '13, as Rev. John Tree
herne, has a part that is difficult to
play with spirit but which he manages
with great skill. Mr. Brown has done
very creditably in"The Senator" and
also in this year's Sword and Sandals
productions.
W. B. Owens, '14, and J. N. Wash
burn, '14, are showing that they have
a great deal of ability, by their treat
ment of the characters they are tak
ing. Mr. Owens and Mr. Washburn
both took part in"The Compromise"
last semester, and Mr. Washburn has
had a considerable experience in dra
matics at the University of Chicago.
Miss R. Sampson, '12, as Tweeny,
makes the most of a very amusing'
character part. She impells laughter.
Miss F. Ober, '13, does very well in
her rather meager role of Fisher, the
maid. Stanford has seen her very
successful work in the 1913 Sopho
more play, and in the 1911 Football
show. '
H. Soper, '15, is taking a small part
in which he has done creditably. His
work is very good.
