# WORLD'S UNSEEN EMPIRE OUTLINED BY DR. JORDAN
## "The Endless Caravan of Ciphers," the National War Debt, Explained in Assembly by President Jordan. 
### 
"War is a very wicked thing;
Let us try to drop it;
Turn the forts into hotels, 1
For the folks to stop at."
"How is that for a peace song?" ask
ed President Jordan in beginning an
address on the "Unseen Empire of
Finance" at today's assembly.
"A little boy who thought we ought
to have a peace song sent it to me.'
its a fitting introduction, for it covers
the ground. Now, 1 am going to tell
you a story:
"Once upon a time, according to
find yard Kipling, there was a certain
rich man who was liberated from
eternal punishment on the agreement
that he was to do away with war on
the earth."
"This man set about selling the na
tions dreadnoughts, imperial pomp,
the power of the sword, and other
things that go to make war. Finally,
he got them so deep in debt that the
°word was powerless and there was

no war. Satan tried to stir up a strife,
but he was unsuccessful, because the
nations were tied up with the debt.
"Now, there is a certain family that
lived at Frankfort on the Main, that
bad as insignia a red shield. The red
shield is the badge of a. pawnbroker
in Germany and the man at the head
of this family took the place of the
rich man in the story and became the
pawnbroker of the nations. From
Roth Schild his name became Roths
child. Of course this pawnbroker or
banker Rothschild never had the ex
perience of the rich man.
"When anyone wants to buy the
control of a railroad today, (hey do not
buy the railroad, but its debt," affirm
ed President Jordan. "If you can
handle the debt of a railroad it is at
your mercy. Out of the business of
the pawnbroker on the Main, Europe
came under the control of the men
who control the debt. Neither kaiser,
king, Parliament or Reichstag or other
body has much to do in the large maty
ters of peace and war today.
"Nathan Rothschild was with Wel
lington at the battle of Waterloo. He
made arrangements to send home
a carrier pigeon. If the French
were victorious, the representative was
to sell the British stock. If, on the
other hand, the British won, he was
to send a pigeon with a piece of blank;
[taper on its leg. This was a mes
sage to the representative to buy the
British debts, which of course lie did,
and the debt came into the hands of
Rothschild.
"Every child born in Great Britain
is saddled with a debt of $80, on
which he must pay interest as long a f
he lives, and then the debt never will
be paid. No policy of economy can
last long enough to pay the great debt
of the nation. The British debt is now
about $3,800,000,000. Russia has a
debt of approximately $5,000,000,000!
Spain, of $1,300,000,000; and Japan of
$1,300,000,000."
American War Debt a Billion.
"Here in the United States," de
clared President Jordan, "the debt
amounts to $11 per capita of popula
tion, about $1,000,000,000 in a rough
aggregate. The war debt of the
world, which amounts now to about
$30,000,000,000, has been spoken of as
'the endless caravan of ciphers'; we
keep adding them every year.
' Nations are judged, not by bigness,
population, wealth or even universities
and art, but by the ability of the com
mon man to rise.
"Emerson says 'America means op
portunity.' Now England doesn't mean
opportunity, nor Portugal, nor Italy,
because debts and taxes keep a man
down. Booker T. Washington de
clared that 'The relation of people to
opportunity in the greater part of Eu
rope is loss than that of the negro of
Alabama.' Debts cause waste by car
rying away earnings. The best men
are not saved from wars for ancestors
of future generations.
"The bankers of Europe, who con
trol the credit of Europe, keep things
steady in the national relations. The
bankers put a stop to the MoroccaiA
difficulties after they had gone far
enough, but they created a mild finan
cial panic in Europe in doing it.
This Country Has No Enemy.
"United States has no enemy with
which to start a war, unless the Uni
ted States provokes it. But where is
the check to all these expenditures
or war munitions? We have secre
taries of war and navy in the cabinet,
but no secretaries of economy, health
or for the white slave evil, our great
est menace today. The secretaries of
war and the navy keep calling, for
mere ships, more guns, to keep up'
with the pace in armament."
"There ought to be a commission
to decide whether we ought to fortify
the Panama canal or undertake other
fortification plans now discussed. We
should decide whether such forts real
ly are needed," continued President
Jordan.
"By an ingenious device the debts
of nations are laid on the workers.
The debts are piled so high that the
great pawnbrokers won't deal in the
government bonds of some countries.
"What is the future of the situation?
What is going to put a stop to all this?
There may be a war between
Britain and Germany. It would creato
a clash in national credit if it came.
But 1 have insisted and still insist'
that there can't be war between two
nations of nearly equal size and
power. The salvation of the nations
lies with the people."

other hand, the British won, he was
to send a pigeon with a piece of blank;
[taper on its leg. This was a mes
sage to the representative to buy the
British debts, which of course lie did,
and the debt came into the hands of
Rothschild.
"Every child born in Great Britain
is saddled with a debt of $80, on
which he must pay interest as long a f
he lives, and then the debt never will
be paid. No policy of economy can
last long enough to pay the great debt
of the nation. The British debt is now
about $3,800,000,000. Russia has a
debt of approximately $5,000,000,000!
Spain, of $1,300,000,000; and Japan of
$1,300,000,000."
American War Debt a Billion.
"Here in the United States," de
clared President Jordan, "the debt
amounts to $11 per capita of popula
tion, about $1,000,000,000 in a rough
aggregate. The war debt of the
world, which amounts now to about
$30,000,000,000, has been spoken of as
'the endless caravan of ciphers'; we
keep adding them every year.
' Nations are judged, not by bigness,
population, wealth or even universities
and art, but by the ability of the com
mon man to rise.
"Emerson says 'America means op
portunity.' Now England doesn't mean
opportunity, nor Portugal, nor Italy,
because debts and taxes keep a man
down. Booker T. Washington de
clared that 'The relation of people to
opportunity in the greater part of Eu
rope is loss than that of the negro of
Alabama.' Debts cause waste by car
rying away earnings. The best men
are not saved from wars for ancestors
of future generations.
"The bankers of Europe, who con
trol the credit of Europe, keep things
steady in the national relations. The
bankers put a stop to the MoroccaiA
difficulties after they had gone far
enough, but they created a mild finan
cial panic in Europe in doing it.
This Country Has No Enemy.
"United States has no enemy with
which to start a war, unless the Uni
ted States provokes it. But where is
the check to all these expenditures
or war munitions? We have secre
taries of war and navy in the cabinet,
but no secretaries of economy, health
or for the white slave evil, our great
est menace today. The secretaries of
war and the navy keep calling, for
mere ships, more guns, to keep up'
with the pace in armament."
"There ought to be a commission
to decide whether we ought to fortify
the Panama canal or undertake other
fortification plans now discussed. We
should decide whether such forts real
ly are needed," continued President
Jordan.
"By an ingenious device the debts
of nations are laid on the workers.
The debts are piled so high that the
great pawnbrokers won't deal in the
government bonds of some countries.
"What is the future of the situation?
What is going to put a stop to all this?
There may be a war between
Britain and Germany. It would creato
a clash in national credit if it came.
But 1 have insisted and still insist'
that there can't be war between two
nations of nearly equal size and
power. The salvation of the nations
lies with the people."

the ground. Now, 1 am going to tell
you a story:
"Once upon a time, according to
find yard Kipling, there was a certain
rich man who was liberated from
eternal punishment on the agreement
that he was to do away with war on
the earth."
"This man set about selling the na
tions dreadnoughts, imperial pomp,
the power of the sword, and other
things that go to make war. Finally,
he got them so deep in debt that the
°word was powerless and there was

no war. Satan tried to stir up a strife,
but he was unsuccessful, because the
nations were tied up with the debt.
"Now, there is a certain family that
lived at Frankfort on the Main, that
bad as insignia a red shield. The red
shield is the badge of a. pawnbroker
in Germany and the man at the head
of this family took the place of the
rich man in the story and became the
pawnbroker of the nations. From
Roth Schild his name became Roths
child. Of course this pawnbroker or
banker Rothschild never had the ex
perience of the rich man.
"When anyone wants to buy the
control of a railroad today, (hey do not
buy the railroad, but its debt," affirm
ed President Jordan. "If you can
handle the debt of a railroad it is at
your mercy. Out of the business of
the pawnbroker on the Main, Europe
came under the control of the men
who control the debt. Neither kaiser,
king, Parliament or Reichstag or other
body has much to do in the large maty
ters of peace and war today.
"Nathan Rothschild was with Wel
lington at the battle of Waterloo. He

the check to all these expenditures

"War is a very wicked thing;
Let us try to drop it;
Turn the forts into hotels, 1
For the folks to stop at."
"How is that for a peace song?" ask
ed President Jordan in beginning an
address on the "Unseen Empire of
Finance" at today's assembly.
"A little boy who thought we ought
to have a peace song sent it to me.'
its a fitting introduction, for it covers
the ground. Now, 1 am going to tell
you a story:
"Once upon a time, according to
find yard Kipling, there was a certain
rich man who was liberated from
eternal punishment on the agreement
that he was to do away with war on
the earth."
"This man set about selling the na
tions dreadnoughts, imperial pomp,
the power of the sword, and other
things that go to make war. Finally,
he got them so deep in debt that the
°word was powerless and there was

no war. Satan tried to stir up a strife,
but he was unsuccessful, because the
nations were tied up with the debt.
"Now, there is a certain family that
lived at Frankfort on the Main, that
bad as insignia a red shield. The red
shield is the badge of a. pawnbroker
in Germany and the man at the head
of this family took the place of the
rich man in the story and became the
pawnbroker of the nations. From
Roth Schild his name became Roths
child. Of course this pawnbroker or
banker Rothschild never had the ex
perience of the rich man.
"When anyone wants to buy the
control of a railroad today, (hey do not
buy the railroad, but its debt," affirm
ed President Jordan. "If you can
handle the debt of a railroad it is at
your mercy. Out of the business of
the pawnbroker on the Main, Europe
came under the control of the men
who control the debt. Neither kaiser,
king, Parliament or Reichstag or other
body has much to do in the large maty
ters of peace and war today.
"Nathan Rothschild was with Wel
lington at the battle of Waterloo. He
made arrangements to send home
a carrier pigeon. If the French
were victorious, the representative was
to sell the British stock. If, on the
other hand, the British won, he was
to send a pigeon with a piece of blank;
[taper on its leg. This was a mes
sage to the representative to buy the
British debts, which of course lie did,
and the debt came into the hands of
Rothschild.
"Every child born in Great Britain
is saddled with a debt of $80, on
which he must pay interest as long a f
he lives, and then the debt never will
be paid. No policy of economy can
last long enough to pay the great debt
of the nation. The British debt is now
about $3,800,000,000. Russia has a
debt of approximately $5,000,000,000!
Spain, of $1,300,000,000; and Japan of
$1,300,000,000."
American War Debt a Billion.
"Here in the United States," de
clared President Jordan, "the debt
amounts to $11 per capita of popula
tion, about $1,000,000,000 in a rough
aggregate. The war debt of the
world, which amounts now to about
$30,000,000,000, has been spoken of as
'the endless caravan of ciphers'; we
keep adding them every year.
' Nations are judged, not by bigness,
population, wealth or even universities
and art, but by the ability of the com
mon man to rise.
"Emerson says 'America means op
portunity.' Now England doesn't mean
opportunity, nor Portugal, nor Italy,
because debts and taxes keep a man
down. Booker T. Washington de
clared that 'The relation of people to
opportunity in the greater part of Eu
rope is loss than that of the negro of
Alabama.' Debts cause waste by car
rying away earnings. The best men
are not saved from wars for ancestors
of future generations.
"The bankers of Europe, who con
trol the credit of Europe, keep things
steady in the national relations. The
bankers put a stop to the MoroccaiA
difficulties after they had gone far
enough, but they created a mild finan
cial panic in Europe in doing it.
