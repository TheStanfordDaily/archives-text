# SOUTHERN ALUMNI MEET IN LOS ANGELES RALLY
## SEVENTY-FIVE STANFORD MEN ARE PRESENT. The 						Old Spirit Again Manifests Itself In Tremendous Outburst by Graduates. 
### 
Stanford spirit is far from dormant
in the southland, according to reports
from Los Angeles, where seventy-five
alumni recently gathered at one of
the periodical outbursts of spirit that
find expression in gatherings at the
University club and other centers of
college interest. The comparatively
short notice given was all that inter
fered with an attendance of over 100,
and efforts will be made to reach this
number at the next meeting. Nearly
every class of the University was
represented, and as each group gave
its class yell, it was roundly applaud
ed. A feature of the program was the
old familiar but none the less enjoyed
chalk|-talk of E. M. Albright, '12. Al
bright had just arrived in Los Angeles
to accept a position with the Aristo
Engraving company, and his stunt
made a tremendous hit, particularly
with the older men. Others contri
buted instrumental numbers and all
of the old familiar songs were sung
again. Addresses were heard from
men who have recently become promi
nent in one way or another and the
enthusiasm that marked the gather
ing made it second to campus rallies
in numbers only.
