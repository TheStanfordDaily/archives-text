# Signs.
## 
### 
Several signs have been pilfered
from the cars of the Peninsular line

recently, much to the disgust
of Graduate Manager Burbank.
These signs are simply an-

nouncements of athletic contests on
the campus, and belong to the Student
body, having been purchased at no
little expense last fall. I
Probably they were taken in a spirit
of playfulness and irresponsibility by
some student for the purpose of eatir-j
-fying his aesthetic impulses in the
matter of room decorations, yet this is
a poor excuse for thievery. If the
signs are returned, no questions will
be asked.
