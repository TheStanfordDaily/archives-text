Regulate Manager.
The 1914 Quad will be published ac
cording to business principles and its
manager will be subject to rigid regu
lations laid down by his class. This
happy result will be achieved through
the contract adopted this afternoon,
the class and the Quad manager be
ing the parties t'> th Q instrument. The
unusual features of this contract are
three. First, the manager's profits are
to be limited to six hundred dollars-
All money or surplus books above this
are to be divided on the ba.sis
of two-thirds to the class and one
third to the manager. Secondly, the
manager is required to tile a bond to
the amount of two thousand dollars
which is to be forfeited to the class
in case the manager fails to submit
to it an itemized report of all hit)
transactions, accompanied by vouchers
before September 20, 1913; in case the
manager fails to pay all Quad bills'
due before September 20, 1913; or in
case he fails to execute the other pro
visions of the contract. The third fea
ture of interest is the provision that
the Editor shall receive a salary of
two hundred dollars. In previous
years one hundred dollars has been th ■
remuneration for that official.
This contract was drawn up on be
half of the class by a committee of
which A. C. Dimon was chairman.
This committee conferred with one
chosen from the Press Club. Two

members of the Press Club, both edi
tors of the Quad in former years, were
present at the class meeting. Thq&e
men were L. L. Hill, '11, and J. W.
Howell, '12. Howell addressed the
second year students, giving a brief
financial statement of the 1912 Quaa.
He dwelt upon the excessively large
profits which have in the past bet/J
realized by Quad managers. The coi.
tract was then adopted by the
unanimous vote of the class.
Whether or not the suffrage in the
Quad election is to be limited to those
who have paid their assessment for
this semester, was the subject of a
discussion which oasued. A motion
by T. H. Claussen that such a regu
lation be imposed was carried. This
will be construed as setting a precej
dent for all future class elections.
A committee was appointed by Pre
sident J. L. McDonald to arrange for
a class jolly-up. W. H. Stammer, L.
W. Lewis, A. G. Halm, Miss M. J. Gib
Christ and Miss C. J. Smith are the
members.
It being believed that a saving could:
be effected by ordering "plugs" at this
time, a motion was passed providing
that the president appoint a committee
to investigate the matter. The mem
bers of this body have not been select
ed.
The contract with the Quad manager
will be printed in full in the Daily
Palo Alto next week, lack of space
making its publication in this issue
impossible.
