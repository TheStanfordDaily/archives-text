Regulate Manager.
The 1914 Quad will be published ac
cording to business principles and its
manager will be subject to rigid regu
lations laid down by his class. This
happy result will be achieved through
the contract adopted this afternoon,

ing the parties t'> th Q instrument. The
unusual features of this contract are
three. First, the manager's profits are
to be limited to six hundred dollars-
All money or surplus books above this
are to be divided on the ba.sis
of two-thirds to the class and one
third to the manager. Secondly, the
manager is required to tile a bond to
the amount of two thousand dollars
which is to be forfeited to the class
in case the manager fails to submit
to it an itemized report of all hit)
transactions, accompanied by vouchers
before September 20, 1913; in case the
manager fails to pay all Quad bills'
due before September 20, 1913; or in
case he fails to execute the other pro
visions of the contract. The third fea
ture of interest is the provision that
the Editor shall receive a salary of
two hundred dollars. In previous
years one hundred dollars has been th ■
remuneration for that official.
This contract was drawn up on be
half of the class by a committee of
which A. C. Dimon was chairman.

chosen from the Press Club. Two
