' Ram's Head," the society formed
last semester for the purpose of fos
tering and promoting original work iiv

the production of
plays, has displayed
the right attitude in

proffering its .services to the Hoard
of Interscholastic Governors for the
entertainment of the visiting prepara
tory school athletes.
The interest manifested by this so
ciety in activities other than those
contained within its own narrow circle
of endeavours, can well be copied by
other organizations of the University.
