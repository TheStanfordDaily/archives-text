# Walton Had Chance's Opportunity.

### 
S. Walton, '96, once one of Stan
ford's star baseball players, is now
secretary of the San Francisco Base
ball Club. In the palmy clays of '94,
he captained his team from behind the
bat and was a kleptomaniac so far
as bases were concerned. He was also
a crack halfback. Walton, while play
ing with Frank Chance as a "busher,"
showed such form that he might now
be playing in Chance's place if it had
not been for his parents' objection.
