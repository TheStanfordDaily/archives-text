# INTERSCHOLASTIC DATE CHANGED TO MARCH 30.
## Counter Attractions Necessitate Altering Original Time Set for Annual Schoolboy Meeting. 
### 
Because of the numerous other at
tractions on the date of April 13, the
clay originally set for the seventh an
nual interscholastic track meet, that
date has been changed to Saturday,
March 30. This later selection will
make it possible for the students to
witness the 1 cat race between Stat>
ford and Cali p orria and also attend
the third ba-'eball game between the
rival universities which are scheduled
for April 13.
The Interscholastic board of
ernors were rather adverse to alter
ing the date but the circumstances
were such that a change was deemed
necessary. It is not believed that the
many preparatory schools which will
send teams to the meet will be affpcted
hy the placing of the date two week si
earlier.
Ram's Head society is to take en
tire charge of the arrangements for
the entertainment of the schoolboy
athletes on the evening of the meet.
Active preparations toward arranging
the program will be begun immediate
ly by the members of the society.
