# "ADMIRABLE CRICHTON" IS DRAMATIC SUCCESS
## PRODUCTION WINS PRAISE FROM CRITIC. Masquers Score on Choice of Play, Interpretation, and Artistic Presentation. 
### 
P. Russell.
Gaul is not the only thing divided,
into three parts. So ah'o is the staging
of a play; and the Masquers, in then
presentation of "The Admirable
Crichton," huve scored a threefold
success.
The first wat. in the choice of a play,
an undertaking 1 ristling with difficul
ties. If you fancy that good comedies
are to bs plucked from every dramatic
bush, go out play-berrying some day
and see. You will find the Barrie-bush
one of the few availables.
The second score was in the inter
pretation.
S'lie Difference.
"I saw this play given by a profes
sional company," said one of the au
dience to me as we passed out, "and
oh, the difference!" It appeared that
this difference was in our favor, and
for the -reason that we "brought out
the author's meaning so much better."
At the end of the third act particularly
we saw a transformation almost weird,
somewhat pitiful, and altogether glori
ous. We saw the Governor's brave,
new character slipping from him along
with his symbolic cloak. We saw an
aristocratic Dr. Jekyll slumping into a
plebeian Mr. Hyde. We saw the strug
gle and the result that was at once a
renunciation and a triumph.
"How did this other actor do it?"
"Why he simply did'nt do it all.
That's the point. He just felt sorry
for himself."
As to the ultimate purpose, one can
never be too sure of the subtle and
whimsical Mr. Barrie, but listen to the
last words of our Lady Mary and her
loyal butler. They spoke as would
cogs in a huge machine; only, being
intelligent cogs, they realized that they
must either revolve without friction
in their appointed circuits, or detach
themselves entirely from it, or get up
a conspiracy to smash the machine.
But the last would involve tragedy,
The Prenentation.
The third triumph was in the artis
tic presentation. To render a bill of
particulars, we might point out that
the high lights fell about as follows:
on Mr. Washburne, as the Earl who
capered as blithely on the bottom stair
of the social ladder as he pranced im
pressively on the top; on Mr. Owens
as the Honorable Ernest, never in
earnest and shamelessly dishonest,
but an irreisstible, breezy young scamp
withal; on Miss Moise as the buoyant
ly regal dowager portrayed with a par
ticularly delightful finish; on Miss
Sampson, who, as Tweeny, achieved
perhaps the most difficult feat of all,
that of making a grotesque part posi
tively winsome, drawing on our sym
pathy as well as our aniWsement,
wre-'tin; an appeal out of her very
vulgarity; and on Miss Parkinson and
Miss Wendling as the reluctantly duti
ful daughters, trailing in languid ele
gance through Papa's drawing room,
aid briskly stealing Papa's boots on
the horrible island. , •
Though a lesser light falls on the
"odds and ends," it reveals as good
work in proportion, for finish in de
tails was one of the charms of the
play. Mr. Soper was an amiable Mam
ma's darling. Miss Ober aped inimit
ably the aristocrats. Mr. Brown help
ed where he could, though hardly the
athletic type of clergyman the lines
called for.
The Leads.
Of course the two leading characters
were under the brightest illumination,
but there was no flinching in them. Mr.
Seward's success lay in the quiet ease
that made him master of every situa
tion, whether butlering or governing;
in the decisive, compelling voice, in
sufficient, however, in enuciation; and
in the comprehensiveness that could
portray both the reflective and the ac
tive side of the practical philosopher,
and do all with tact and courtesy.
That Miss Workman possesses the ob
vious qualities of artistic portrayal,
grace, voice (controlled, but not al
ways perfectly clear), flexibility, verve,
goes without saying. These are the
accessories that make her real gift
effective, namely, the sympathetic im
agination that enables her first to see
and then to be the character she is
interpreting.
It was that indeed that made the en
semble a harmonic success. These
amateur actors were not "merely play
ers." They were for that evening the
members of a British household turned
topsy-turvy for a season, but righted
into normal grooves at the end.
For choice, interpretation, and ar
tistic presentation, let's give the Mas
quers and their cast A in dramatics.

ways perfectly clear), flexibility, verve,
goes without saying. These are the
accessories that make her real gift
effective, namely, the sympathetic im
agination that enables her first to see
and then to be the character she is
interpreting.
It was that indeed that made the en
semble a harmonic success. These
amateur actors were not "merely play
ers." They were for that evening the
members of a British household turned
topsy-turvy for a season, but righted
into normal grooves at the end.
For choice, interpretation, and ar
tistic presentation, let's give the Mas
quers and their cast A in dramatics.
P. Russell.
Gaul is not the only thing divided,
into three parts. So ah'o is the staging
of a play; and the Masquers, in then
presentation of "The Admirable
Crichton," huve scored a threefold
success.
The first wat. in the choice of a play,
an undertaking 1 ristling with difficul
ties. If you fancy that good comedies
are to bs plucked from every dramatic
bush, go out play-berrying some day
and see. You will find the Barrie-bush
one of the few availables.
The second score was in the inter
pretation.
S'lie Difference.
"I saw this play given by a profes
sional company," said one of the au
dience to me as we passed out, "and
oh, the difference!" It appeared that
this difference was in our favor, and
for the -reason that we "brought out
the author's meaning so much better."
At the end of the third act particularly
we saw a transformation almost weird,
somewhat pitiful, and altogether glori
ous. We saw the Governor's brave,
new character slipping from him along
with his symbolic cloak. We saw an
aristocratic Dr. Jekyll slumping into a
plebeian Mr. Hyde. We saw the strug
gle and the result that was at once a
renunciation and a triumph.
"How did this other actor do it?"
"Why he simply did'nt do it all.
That's the point. He just felt sorry
for himself."
As to the ultimate purpose, one can
never be too sure of the subtle and
whimsical Mr. Barrie, but listen to the
last words of our Lady Mary and her
loyal butler. They spoke as would
cogs in a huge machine; only, being
intelligent cogs, they realized that they
must either revolve without friction
in their appointed circuits, or detach
themselves entirely from it, or get up
a conspiracy to smash the machine.
But the last would involve tragedy,
The Prenentation.
The third triumph was in the artis
tic presentation. To render a bill of
particulars, we might point out that
the high lights fell about as follows:
on Mr. Washburne, as the Earl who
capered as blithely on the bottom stair
of the social ladder as he pranced im
pressively on the top; on Mr. Owens
as the Honorable Ernest, never in
earnest and shamelessly dishonest,
but an irreisstible, breezy young scamp
withal; on Miss Moise as the buoyant
ly regal dowager portrayed with a par
ticularly delightful finish; on Miss
Sampson, who, as Tweeny, achieved
perhaps the most difficult feat of all,
that of making a grotesque part posi
tively winsome, drawing on our sym
pathy as well as our aniWsement,
wre-'tin; an appeal out of her very
vulgarity; and on Miss Parkinson and
Miss Wendling as the reluctantly duti
ful daughters, trailing in languid ele
gance through Papa's drawing room,
aid briskly stealing Papa's boots on
the horrible island. , •
Though a lesser light falls on the
"odds and ends," it reveals as good
work in proportion, for finish in de
tails was one of the charms of the
play. Mr. Soper was an amiable Mam
ma's darling. Miss Ober aped inimit
ably the aristocrats. Mr. Brown help
ed where he could, though hardly the
athletic type of clergyman the lines
called for.
The Leads.
Of course the two leading characters
were under the brightest illumination,
but there was no flinching in them. Mr.
Seward's success lay in the quiet ease
that made him master of every situa
tion, whether butlering or governing;
in the decisive, compelling voice, in
sufficient, however, in enuciation; and
in the comprehensiveness that could
portray both the reflective and the ac
tive side of the practical philosopher,
and do all with tact and courtesy.
That Miss Workman possesses the ob
vious qualities of artistic portrayal,
grace, voice (controlled, but not al
ways perfectly clear), flexibility, verve,
goes without saying. These are the
accessories that make her real gift
effective, namely, the sympathetic im
agination that enables her first to see
and then to be the character she is
