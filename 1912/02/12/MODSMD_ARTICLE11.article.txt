# Smoking.
## 
### 
Years 1.30, when Stanford was in
the making, a custom grew up here
abouts which placed the

ban upon smoking on the

Quad. This custom, as one
worthy of preserving, has been ob
served by generations of Stanford men,
and is, perhaps the most jealously
guarded of all our traditions.
Every student in the University, we
feel c?;tii.j, knows of the existence of
the nc-i:noki:ig r.ile; yet on Friday
night it was repeatedly violated by up
perclassmen. Strangers to the campus
are not expected to be versed in these
regulations which have been gradually
evolved, but certainly this excuse can
not be relied upon by students.
During the intermissions of "The
Admirable Crichton," the outer edge
of the arcade directly in front of the)
Assembly Hall and the adjacent walk
and lawn were frequented by smokers.
Many of these men were undergradu
ates who should have been acquainted
with the fact that smoking in that par
ticular locality had been prohibited.
A year ago, by the action of the
University Conference, the application
of this rule was extended to the ter
race in front of the Library and to the
bottom of all steps leading to the
Quadrangle. It is to be hoped with a
clearer appreciation of the worth of
this custom, we will have no
repetition of the incidents of Friday
night.
