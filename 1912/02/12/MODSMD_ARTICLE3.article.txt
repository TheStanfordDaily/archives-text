# STANFORD SOCCER MEN LOSE TO CORINTHIANS.
## Solitary Goal by Alameda Players Shuts Cardinal Out of Cup Competition. 
### 
By suffering defe'at by the close
score of 1 to 0, the Stanford soccer
elevn was deprived of the right to
contest in further games for the cup
competition. The Corinthians of the
Bay Counties League were victors over
the Cardinal by a solitary goal on the
Croll's Garden grounds at Alameda.
Stanford showed to excellent advan
tage during the entire game and it
was only the brilliant work of goal
keeper Garmandia, who proved to be
an octopus in point of arms, that pre
vented a victory for Coach Maloney's
men.
Play in the first half was even, but
the Cardinal soccerites were easily
the best in the second period and de
served a win. The forwards bombard
ed the Corinthian goal continually,
but were unable to drop the ball into
the net.
Pellas, A. Erb, B. Erb, Fyfe and Cap
tain Reynolds were the most promin
ent in attack for Stanford, and Hig
gins starred on defense. Sharp
brothers and Garmandia were the best
