# UPPER CLASSES WILL JOLLY-UP FEBRUARY 21
## "STUNTS" WILL AFFORD MUCH AMUSEMENT. Gym Club and Ram's Head Will Supply Talent for Entertainment of 1911's Guests. 
### 
February 22 is George Washington's
birthday, but certain members of the
class of 1911 believe that hereafter it
will be also celebrated as the"day
after"the joliy
up. The varic.us official press-agents
for this affair state that it is to be a
"production of unrivalled magnifi
cence."
While dancing will be the principal
nmmrcment of the evening, various
short "stunts" between the dances will
enliven matters. One of the finest of
the.se will be given by the Gym club.
The members of this organization have
been practicing for their turn every
evening, and hope to reach in it the
height of gymnastic perfection. The
exact nature of their performance has
so far been kept a secret.
The Rani's Head will also have
charge of a number of "stunts." Mu
sical numbers and short, snappy
-skits' will be included on the menu
which these experienced fun-chefs will
offer their amusement-hungry patrons.
A student duel, Heidelberg style, also
appears on the bill of fare. H. W.
Maloney and H. V. Poor, '10, are to be
the participants.
in most respects this jolly-up will
follow the lines which have become
recognized as standard in the past.
Informal clothing and "no queening
coming or going" will be the strict
rule. February 21 is the time, the
Armory the pla"ce, and all members
of the classes of 1913, 1912, 1911 and
above, now on the Farm will be the
girlsâ€”and boys.
