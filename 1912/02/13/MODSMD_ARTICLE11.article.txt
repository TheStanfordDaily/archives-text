To avoid conflicting with meets of
the various Academic Athletic leagues,

the date of the Stanford
Intel-scholastic Track Meet
and Tennis Tournament has

been changed back to the time origin
ally set, April 13. With the meet held
during the second week oi April, as
usual, the Interscholastic will be by
far the most representative gathering
of preparatory school athletes on the
coat t.
Already letters have been received
from Portland announcing that three
schools from the vicinity of the Ore
gon metropolis will be represented in
both tennis and track at the big meet.
From the number of applications re
ceived, Secretary Ambrose predicts an
entry list of over forty-five schools.
The widespread interest manifested
in the meet this season, is no doubt
due to the remarkable records made
by interscholastic athletes during the
past seven years. The marks made on
the Stanford oval are all practically
coast records, and it is not too much
to say that the winner of the Inter
scholastic is the preparatory school
champion of the coast.
