# WILL CHOOSE DEBATERS FOR TRIANGULAR LEAGUE
## FEBRUARY 28 TO BE DATE OF THE TRYOUTS. Stanford Scuds One Team to Oregon and Reserves Another to Meet Washington Here. 
### 
Tryouts for the debates of the Tri
state league are scheduled for Febru
ary 28. At this time four speakers
will be selected. Two of these will
journey to Eugene, Oregon, to meet a
team from the University or Oregon,
while the remaining two will debate
the University of Washington at Stan
ford.
The subject for the debates and for
the try-outs as well is "Resolved,
That judges should lie subject to pop
ular recall, constitutionality granted."
rhose wishing to try-out are requested
to hand their names at once to M. M.
Fogel, '12, M. B. Ilenshaw, '12, or E. E.
Tincher, '12.
The contestants will meet next Fri
day at 1:15 in the large lecture room
in the Law building. At this time
they will be assigned to sides and will
be divided up into squads for greater
convenience in conducting the tryout.
It is stated that all who have a prefer
ence as to the side of the question
which they will uphold should be pres
ent at this time.
The debates with Oregon and Wash
ington will this year be contested oil
March 29. It is believed that a large
number will enter the try-outs, as, in
addition to the advantages of a place
on an ordinary debating team, the
possibility of the northern trip offers
allurements. The question is a fami
liar one, having been argued in the
recent Freshman- Sophomore debate
and, in a slightly different form, in
the intercollegiate debate last semes
ter.
