of the Botany department on the work
of the late Professor Dudley, and his
relations to them. C. S. Morris, '08,

high school, and J. McMurphy, instruc
to in the Department of Botany, are

William Russell Dudley, Professor
of Systematic Botany, died on June 4,
1911, in Los Altos. Professor Dudley
joined the faculty at Stanford in 1892,
and held his position here until Janu
ary, 1911, when he retired on account
of ill-health. His extensive botanical
collections were presented to the Uni
versity and with those of Professor
Abrams form the major part of the
large "Dudley Herbarium" here.
The meeting will be held in the Bo
tanical Library at 4:30 p.m., and an
invitation has been extended to all
friends of Dr. Dudley to attend.
