Pomona College will send a team of
representatives to contest with the
Cardinal on the Stanford cinder path

trackmen have not competed with
Stanford for several seasons and the
meet with the Claremont collegians
will give the Varsity an additional op

Captain Coleman has been asked to
arrange a meeting between the Fresh
men and the Palo Alto high school
team, by track captain Mills of the
college town institution. The date on
which the proposed competition is to
be held is Saturday, February 25.
The regular weekly meet for the
Varsity and novices will also be on
the program for Saturday. The full
dstances will again be covered and all
of the veterans are to compete.
The large eucalyptus tree on the
south east side of the track near the
220 yard mark on the turn, has been
cut down. The blossoms which were
constantly falling upon the track were
a hindrance to the runners and often
hampered fast work. The judges will
be able to see the trackmen around the
entire course with the tree down.
