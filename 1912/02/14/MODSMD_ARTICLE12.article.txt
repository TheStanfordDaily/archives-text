# Cheating.
## 
### 
In a university, as in every other
place where mankind is gathered in
a more or less motley crowd, there

will always be found indi
viduals who stoop to unfair
means to advance their

own interests. This particular speci
men manifests himself in college as
the person who cheats in examination
and otherwise abuses the confidence
reposed in him by his instructors.
The cheat may be one of those un
fortunate characters who from birth
finds it impossible to tread the road
which is called straight; or, again he
may be cursed with what our geologi
cal friends would call a fault line in
his moral make-up, and, giving way
under the strain of freedom from the
watchful eye of some assistant, he
stoops to unfair means.
Fortunately, Stanford has been com
paratively free from this evil in the
past; but it is towards the future that
we must look. During the fall semes
ter, several incidents were called to
the attention of the present editor of
the Daily Palo Alto which led him to
believe that perhaps the upperclass
men of the University were really
placing a premium upon cheating by
the attitude they assumed towards the
practice. They seemed to regard the
cheat with utmost contempt, while
looking askance at any attempt made
by individual undergraduates to put
a stop to the cheater's activity.
If this is allowed to continue, the
inevitable result will be a lowering of
the general tone of the University
from its present high level.
The Law department has established
an extremely effective honor system,
and law examinations are known for
the strict regulations enforced by the
students themselves. This happy re
sult has been brought about by each
man holding himself individually re
sponsible for the conduct of all; to
that extent is each his brother's
keeper.
Our belief is that the the class of
1912, by taking advantage of its seni
ority and the class distinctions main
tained here, could do much to prevent
a deterioration of our standards.
At the Senior meeting tomorrow
we would suggest that it be adopted
as the sense of the meeting that the
Senior class, as a body, do all in its
power to discountenance cheating, and
that every member of the class take
it upon himself personally to prevent
underclassmen from making use of
unfair means in examinations.
If this is done, we have not the
slightest doubt that Stanford in the
future, as in the past, will deserve its
reputation for the honor of its stu
dents.
