"He came unto His own and His own
received Him not," was the text of a
very inspiring talk by Bishop Hughes,
head of the Methodist Church in Cali
fornia, at the Vespers of the Young
Women's Christian Association yester
day.
Bishop Hughes described the "com
ing unto His own" as the promptings
of human conscience, which lie termed
"the speaking of Christ within the
man."
