# PROFESSOR ADAMS EDITS HISTORICAL DOCUMENTS.
## Valuable Work on British Relations With Texas is Appearing in "Quarterly." 
### 
Professor E. D. Adams, of the His
tory department, has lately edited an
interesting piece of historical work,
the first installment of which has just
appeared in the January number of
"The Quarterly of the lexas State
Historical Association." The work is
a compilation of the "British Corres
pondence Concerning Texas."
During the ten years that Texas was
an independent state, after revolution
from Mexico, and before annexation
by the United States, British diplo
mats and agents were very active in
trying to persuade Texas to maintain
permanently her independence. Pro
fessor Adams was the first historical
student to obtain access to the British
diplomatic correspondence on Texas,
and three years ago gave the results
of his studies in a series of ten lec
tures at John Hopkins University.
The lectures were since printed in
book form by that University. At the
request of the Texas Historical Asso
ciation, and at their expense, he has
now had made by a copyist in London
all of the more important documents,
and is editing them for the Texas
"Quarterly."
The first installment, just issued,
covers sixty-five pages of the "Quarter
ly," and the letters printed include not
only diplomatic affairs, but descrip
tions of conditions of all sorts in Texas
-â€¢-industrial, social, frontier life, per
sonal sketches, and anything the
British agents thought it worth while
to write about. Professor Adams
states that the publication of these
documents will run through about
three years of the Texas "Quarterly"
numbers.
