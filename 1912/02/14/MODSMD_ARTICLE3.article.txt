ers from the east will be in attend
ance.
Coach F. L. Mathieu is drilling the
thespians several times a week in the

class bids fair to rival any previous
Sophomore comedy.

exception to the general run of second
year casts, in that some of the parts
will be taken by members who have
already won recognition on the Stan
ford stage.

edy by Madeline Lucette Ryley. Un
der the management of Charles Froh
