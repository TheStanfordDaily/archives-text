# DR. JORDAN DESCRIBES BEAUTIES OF ORIENT.
## Travels in Japan and Korea Illustrated By Beautifully Colored Stereopticon Views. 
### 
Before a large audience in the As
sembly Hall, Dr. Jordan last evening
gave an illustrated lecture on his tra
vels in Japan and Korea. The beauties
of the Island Empire and the quaint
customs of the people were described
by comments and the relating of short
incidents suggested by the pictures.
These were unusual in clearness and
coloring.
A portion of the slides were made
especially for Dr. Jordan in Tokio on
his last trip to the Orient. Others
were pictures taken by Professor H. L.
Smith in Korea, and showed the na
tive customs and scenery of the Her
mit Kingdom.
