To-morrow's baseball game between
the Varsity and the United States

battleship, St. Louis,
has been called off
at the request of the
sailors. Their in
ability to journey here
to-morrow was only
made known this morn
ing, and an effort to
arrange another game

with this team is now being made.
As the schedule now stands, the next
game to he played by the Varsity on
the home grounds will be on next
Tuesday. At that time Ireland's In
dependents will play their fourth game
against the Varsity.
On the coming Saturday Berkeley
High will play here against the sec
ond team, while the Varsity will op
pose the Santa Clara College on their
home grounds.
The schedule for next week calls for
three games, one to be played off the
campus. Tuesday, Ireland's Independ
ents journey here, while on Thursday,
Washington's Birthday, the Varsity
goes to Oakland to play St. Mary's.
This will be the second game against
these players and will probably take
place 011 the State League grounds.
On Saturday, Presley's "All Stars"
will play Stanford in the first of a two
game series.
Interclass baseball games are to be
played during the last week of this
month, the exact dates to be made
1 known later. It is possible that all
candidates will be allowed to play in
these games, including the Varsity
men. Owing to contests of the four
team league a greater interest than
usual is being taken in baseball this
year and when the time comes some
exceptionally good ball should be play
ed by the class teams. The final ar
rangements are in the hands of Coach
I Peters and will be given out at an
early date.
