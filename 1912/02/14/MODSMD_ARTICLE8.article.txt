# ASSEMBLY SCHEDULED FOR MONDAY MORNING
## DOCTOR GRENFELL TO SPEAK TO STUDENTS. Noted Labrador Missionary Will be Heard by University Public at 10:15 Period. 
### 
Dr. Wilfred Thomason Grenfell, the
well known and much appreciated
medical missionary of Labrador, will
address the Stanford students in the
Assembly Hall, Monday morning at
the 10:15 period.
For twenty years, Dr. Grenfell has
served as a devoted friend of the deep
sea fisher folk of that barren land, and
in that time has erected hospitals, an
orphanage, and a fisherman's insti
tute, and has organized co-operative
stores and many other helpful indus
trial schemes. At present he is not
only the superintendent of the Labra
dor Branch of the Royal National Mis
sion to Deep Sea Fishermen, but also
Medical Adviser to the Hudson's Bay
Company as well. As a representative
of the finest type of social service he
has been honored by the universities
of England and America.
1-Ie is now making a tour of the Pa
cific Coast, and recently in Los An
geles, took advantage of an oppor
tunity to discredit the statement that
he should be addressed as "Sir," for
although the King of England had
bestowed upon him companionship in
the historic Order of the Bath, the title
of "Sir" did not accompany the honor.
A few years ago he addressed a
Stanford audience and the memory
of his stirring message still remains
with all who heard him on that occas
sion. In arranging for his presence
on Monday, Doctor Jordan has pro
vided a rare privilege for the univer
sity public. The Assembly will last
for one hour and the 11:15 classes
will be conducted as usual.
