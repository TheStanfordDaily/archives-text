# NEW PAIR IS ADDED TO CREW EQUIPMENT
## Aspirants For Bowing Honors Have Active Season in Store For Them New. 
### 
With a new pair added to the Stan
ford boating equipment and daily
training becoming an earnest matter
on Lake Lagunita and on the Redwood
estuary, the Cardinal oarsmen find 110
occasion to complain of inactivity.
Every afternoon the Varsity candi
dates journey to the bay and the
Freshmen work out on the Lake.
The crewmen are gradually getting
down to the routine work and from
now until the intercollegiate regatta
the rowers will be among the busiest
residents of the campus. Soon two
full crews will row 011 the estuary
each day. The greater part of the
Stanford navy is docked at Redwood,
ready for instant service. The new
pair is an excellent addition to the
Cardinal flotilla. It is the workman
ship of T. R. Keenan of San Francisco
and is a fine example of the class of
work done by the boat builder.
