All Students -May Attend.
All students of the University, ass
members of the Guild are privileged
to attend this meeting, the object of
which is to bring up the matter of
selling the old Guild hospital, situated
at the corner of Waverly street and
Lytton avenue in Palo Alto. The hos
pital was established shortly after the
typhoid epidemic here a few years ago,
when there was no hospital within a
reasonable distance of the campus.
Students were admitted to the hospital
at the regular rate of one dollar per
day, and outside people were taken in
at the regular hospital rates to help
pay expenses. The Guild lost money
on this proposition, so when the Pen
insular Hospital was built in Palo
Alto, the Guild made a contract with it
to handle its cases. The executive
committee has found that the money
for which the property can be sold is
of more value to the corporation than
the property, and has therefore called
this meeting. The assent of a majority
of those present is necessary to ratify
the action of the Committee.
Negotiations are under way for get
ting the house, commonly known as
the Felt Lake House, near Felt Lake,
to be used as a temporary isolation
hospital. Under the ordinances of
Palo Alto, the Peninsular Hospital will
not take isolation cases.
