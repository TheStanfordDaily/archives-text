# How Old Is Ann?

Listen, gentle reader, to the plaint
of a poor student. If at half-past

eight you should set the
valuable Ingersoll chrono
meter that has been your
reliance for years, and care-

fully correct its wanderings by com
parison with the brand of time used
at the government observatory, and
then go to a 9:15 class and find your
self several minutes late, what would
you say?
If at 11:15 you should correct the
Lick Observatory time and find that
according to the Business office it was
six minutes slow, and then hear the
12:15 whistle blow at 12:20, what time
would you say it is now?
