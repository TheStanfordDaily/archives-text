# HANDBALL TOURNAMENT BEGINS IN GOOD STYLE.
## Three Matches Decided Yesterday on Encina Courts.-Playing is of High Order. 
### 
Three matches were decided yester
day afternoon in the handball tourna
ment for the Storey Belt, two contests
being played and one going by default.
The winners were E. W. Pugh, '11,
S. Arakawa, gr., and W. T. White, '15.
The match between Pugh and A. J.
McChrystal, '15, was the closest and
best exhibition of the day. It was
necessary for three close games to be
played before it was settled in favor
of Pugh. McChrystal, a Freshman,
who has played but little on the En
cina court, put up a splendid game,
winning the first match by the score
of 21-15. Pugh, fighting from behind,
now found his form and by covering
a lot of ground and excellent "killing"
won the next two games after a hard
struggle, 21-12 and 21-17, thereby cap
turing the match.
In the other contest played, Arakawa
easily defeated K. Pyle, '13. Arakawa
completely outclassed his opponent,
winning by the score of 21-5 and 21-7.
J. D. Hurd, '13, defaulted to White
in the third match decided during the
afternoon.
The result of the play in the pre
liminary round was:
E. W. Pugh, '11, defeated A. J. Mc-
Chrystal, *15, 15-21, 21-18, 21-17; S.
Arakawa, gr., defeated K. Pyle, '13,
21-5, 21-7; W. T. White, '15, defeated
.T. D. Hurd, '13, by default.
