### 
Miss M. Volknior, '13, Miss M. Boyd,
'14, Miss M. Eustace, '13, and Miss G.
Davis, '13, will represent the Foil and
Mask Society of Stanford in the fenc
ing contests to be held with the Cali
fornia women in Berkeley on Washing
ton's Birthday, February 22. The
representatives of the local organiza
tion were chosen after a "round robin"
contest in which the four members of
the team ranked higher than any other
four women in the University.
The meeting with California is to
be held in the Harmon gymnasium on
the afternoon of the holiday. Instruc
tor H. W. Maloney of the Encina gym
nasium will accompany the Stanford
fencers on their trip.
The Foil and Mask Society met last
night and transacted a number of
small business matters. The club
pins were adopted, and will be ordered
immediately. Following the business
session, a number of bouts were held.
Nothing will be done regarding the
interclass tournaments until the next
meeting of the society, two weeks
hence.
