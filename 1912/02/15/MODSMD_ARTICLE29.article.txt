# CLASSMEN GATHER AT INFORMAL REUNION.
## Graduates and Holdovers Will Have Meeting.â€”1910 to Banquet in Palo Alto. 
### 
Furthering a custom inaugurated
last semester, sixteen members of the
class of 1910 gathered at the Inn last
evening and enjoyed both a dinner
and two hours of reunion. After the
meal, some time was spent in singing
songs popular when the classmen were
undergraduates, but since relegated to
obscurity.
Plans were discussed for further
meetings, and it was decided to hold
a similar affair in a Palo Alto restaur
ant on the evening of the track meet,
to which it was hoped not only all the
'10 men in college would come, but all
the male members of the class who
are on the campus at that time. An
attempt will also be made to arrange
a gathering of all the hold-over men
in the University later in the spring.
It was decided that all the hold-overs,
representing every class from '05
down, who are now registered, should
be invited to the gathering.
