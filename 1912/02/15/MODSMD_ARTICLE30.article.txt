# Basketball Game Postponed.
## 
### 
The basketball game which was to
have been played last night in the San
Francisco Y. M. C. A. between Stan
ford and the B'nai B'rith teams, had
to be postponed owing to a misunder
standing. The Y. M. C. A. team had
also scheduled a game for the same
time. This contest was to have been
Stanford's first in the Pacific Athletic
Association series. The Stanford play
ers thought the game would be played
until they reached the Y. M. C. A.,
when they found that their trip to San
Francisco had been in vain.
