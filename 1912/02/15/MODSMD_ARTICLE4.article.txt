# Special Grass to be Used on Fields.
## 
### 
Several thousand roots of Lippa-
Repens, a drought-resisting lawn plant
have been shipped to Stanford for the
turfing of the athletic fields.
This grass was ordered through Pro
fessor F. Angel 1, of the Psychology
department, after a study of the best
grass for this use. The shipment has
been made from John Sweet and Sons
of Alhambra Valley. J. F. Sweet was
graduated with the class of 1901.
