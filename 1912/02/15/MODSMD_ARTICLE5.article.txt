### 
Fifteen was the total number of the
members of the Senior class at this
afternoon's meeting. As several mat

were scheduled to be decided. Presi
dent R. H. Seward decided to postpone
the meeting until to-morrow after
noon.
Every member of the class is urged
to be in room 214 at 1:10, Friday, so
that the business may be truly made
authoritative.
