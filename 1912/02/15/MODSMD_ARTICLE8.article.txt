# REHEARSALS FOR "GIRL AND VOICE" BEGIN SOON
## READING OF OPERA SCHEDULED FOR TO-MORROW. Songs, Lines and "Business" of Production Will be Practiced Next Saturday Morning. 
### 
For the first time an idea of the
1913 Junior Opera "The Girl and the
Voice," as it will appear on the even
ing of March 28, is to be gained to
morrow, when a reading of the manu
script by the complete cast will take
place. This reading will be held at the
Pi Beta Phi house, and will begin at
4:30. Everyone having a speaking
part in the opera, no matter how few
his lines, is requested to be present at
this time.
The lines will be carefully gone over
and the "business" noted. The reading
will be invaluable in making the mem
bers of the cast familiar with the gen
eral plot of the opera, as well as with
their cues. Coach Carlyle is not to
be present at this reading, but P.
Eliel, '13, one of the writers of "The
Girl and the Voice," will be in attend
ance to explain the spirit in which the
various parts were conceived by the
authors.
Saturday morning in room 68, start
ing at 9:30, the first rehearsal for the
1912 Junior Opera will engage the at
tention of the cast and chorus. It is
stated that every person who expects
to make an appearance on the stage
when the opera is produced, be that
appcarance ever so brief, be that per
son principal, member of the chorus,
or "supe," must be present at this
rehearsal. "Alterations in the cast,"
as expressed by the coach; in other
words, ignominious discharge, will be
the penalty for non-appearance.
Coach Carlyle will direct this re
hearsal, and everything contained in
the score and book of "The Girl and
the Voice" will be gone over, includ
ing songs, business, and spoken lines.
