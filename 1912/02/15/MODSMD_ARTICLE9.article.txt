### 
Nine thousand, one hundred and
forty-seven dollars in cash and over
twelve thousand dollars pledged, was
the encouraging report made at the
meeting of the Directors of the Stan
ford Women's Club House last even
ing.
Great activity is being shown by
the collectors of new pledges, and as
soon as their reports are all turned
in a larger increase still is expected.
Mrs. P. G. Treat, President of the
Board, has called another meeting for
the early part of next week for the
further discussion of the resolution
adopted by the Women's League last
semester, proposing consolidation.
