THE FINISHING TOUCHES
of fine attire are what give that
general effectiveness in which
women delight. In such con

always look fresh and new.
CLEANING AND PRESSING
as done at our establishment, is
what will always bring about that
result. Let us take care of your
clothes, and you will always look
well. WE CLEAN ABSOLUTELY.
