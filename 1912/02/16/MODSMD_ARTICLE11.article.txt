The library authorities have posted
notices in conspicuous places request-

ing students to refrain from
from using the library as a sub
stitute for sorority parlors and

porches, and making, in general, a plea
for less noise in the building supposed
to be devoted exclusively to study.
We might think this trouble confined
to Stanford, but read the following
editorial contained in yesterday's is
sue of "The Daily Californian."
Conversation Seminars.
"An ancient, honorable and time
worn complaint has come to the atten
tion of the editor. It appears that
certain students in their misuse of the
new Doe library have made them
selves an annoyance and a hindrance
to their fellows by their persistent
conversation. A library is maintained
at this University for one purpose
and for that purpose only; namely, for
study. One who wilfully violates the
rule of quiet that regularly exists at
this place of study is not only a break
er of the laws of his University, but
he is obnoxious to his fellow students.
The conversation seminars, short
courses in "queening," and business
conferences that take place in the Doe
library in a single day would amount,
in the aggregate and from a noise
standpoint to the volume of a very
fair-sized 'Oski.' It would be well if
the men and women students would
practice a little self-restraint in this
direction."
And this from California, where they
are supposed to hold "the female of
the species" in such deep abhorrence.
