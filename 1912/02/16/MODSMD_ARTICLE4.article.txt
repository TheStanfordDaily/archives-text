# SENIORS WILL ATTEND FOUNDERS' DAY SERVICES
## CAMPAIGN AGAINST CHEATING TO BE WAGED. Upperclassmen Resolve to Hold Memorial Services and to Stand for Squareness in Work. 
### 
To show respect for the memory of
the founders of the University, the
Senior class decided this afternoon to
attend Founders' day services in a
body. The members of 1912 will meet
shortly before the hour appointed for
the exercises and march to the chapel,
where places will be reserved for
them.
After the services at the chapel are
concluded, the class will proceed to
to the mausoleum, where appropriate
exercises will be held. These exer
cises will be arranged by the flower
committee. There will be nothing
formal about this part of the pro
gram.
The proposition met with the un
animous approval of the class, and an
endeavor will be made to have the
custom inaugurated by 1912 continued
by succeeding Senior classes.
The question of cheating was
thrashed over, and it was adopted as
the sense of the meeting that the Se
nior class, as a class, take action
against this evil. The urgency of each
individual taking the matter person
ally and assuming his share of re
sponsibility was brought out clearly.
Blame for using unfair means in
examinations was laid at the door of
the underclasses. Student Body Presi
dent K. L. Schaupp urged on the
fourth-year students that if under
graduates expected to assume self
government, here was a splendid op
portunity to show what upperclassmen
could do in the way of controlling
student affairs.
Tin.' Senior class committees which
will manage the various functions of
Sen'or week will be announced by
P' esident Seward on Tuesday through
ae columns of the Daily Palo Alto.
