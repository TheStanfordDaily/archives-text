# OLD LIBRARY RULING TO BE AGAIN ENFORCED.
## "Queeners" Must Evacuate Their Preempted Premises.â€”Politicians Desert Posts. 
### 
Henceforth and forever no more!
The library is to becom? the haunt
of the bookworm and anti-suffragette.
!t has been ordained that there shall
be no more "queening" in those sacred
precincts. Moses can now look round
again from his reveries upon pinky
purple hills and lower his warning
finger. Thomas A' Kempis will forego
his disdainful look for one of a more
lachrymose composition. Even the
nine judges will put aside their judi
cial air and beam in an atmosphere of
unruffled calm.
The talking in the library of late,
according to Head Librarian G. T.
Clark, has been so loud that it has
annoyed the students. Some of this
conversation has come from outside
students and this of course could not
be stopped. In other iibraries, the
officials state, the amount of noise
now tolerated would be discounten
anced. The most troublesome phase
of the disorder has come from the
men, but they have not been the only
disturbers of the peace. Different

sorority houses have even gone so far
as to preempt, certain rows, where
"queening" has been carried on un
restricted.
"Peanut politicians," booming their
respective parties, have infested the
reading rooms. All this is strictly
under the ban. The authorities have
even decided that the library is to
become a study hall.
