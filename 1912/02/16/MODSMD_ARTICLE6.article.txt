# STANFORD GRADUATES ELIGIBLE TO COMPETE
## ANNUAL HARVARD SCHOLARSHIP TO BE GIVEN SOON. Applications Should be Made to Registrar Before March 1.â€”Alternate Rule Abandoned. 
### 
Graduates of Stanford University
who wish to enter in competition with
University of California graduates for
the scholarship given annually to
Stanford or California men for work at
Harvard, must present their applica
tion to the Registrar before March 1.
This scholarship is a prize well worth
striving for.
The income of the scholarship is
$400 per year and is for one year.
This, however, would not prevent its
holder from continuing his work, as
other scholarships or fellowships at
Harvard are usually given those who
have done satisfactory work during
their first year.
Hitherto, the scholarship has been
given in alternate years to graduates
of Stanford and California, but this
year the alternate rule has been aban
doned, experimentally, and graduates
of both universities will enter in di
rect competition.
The scholarship is given by the San
Francisco Harvard Graduates' Club.
Those who wish to compete must make
known their intentions to the regis
trar. Their names are then taken un
der advisement by the members of the
Stanford faculty who have studied at
Harvard. If satisfactory, the applica
tion is then sent to the San Francisco
club, the executive committee of
which makes the final decision.
The selection is made on the basis
of scholarship and other qualifications.
The plan of choosing the student is
similar to that of naming the Rhodes
scholar. Scholarship, health, the stu
dent's ability to present himself, his
record in athletics and other student
activities are all taken into considera
tion.
A large number of Stanford men
have availed themselves of this oppor
tunity to pursue graduate courses in
the big eastern institution. F. Ander
son, '11, is the present holder of the
scholarship. L. Craven, '09, and J. K.
Bonnell, '03, are among the Stanford
graduates who have secured the
scholarship in the past.
Professor G. ,T. Peirce, of the Botany
department, a member of the Stanford
faculty who has studied at Harvard,
is willing to answer all questions re
garding the scholarship and the work
at Harvard. He can be found in the
Physiology building, room 466.
