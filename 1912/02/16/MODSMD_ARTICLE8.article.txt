# CARDINAL TO PLAY AT SANTA CLARA TOMORROW
## THIRTEEN MEN TO MAKE THE TRIP OFF CAMPUS. Second Varsity Will Play the Berkeley High School Here at 3 O'clock. 
### 
Thirteen men will be taken to
Santa Clara to-morrow afternoon to
play in the first game of the season
off the campus.
The Santa Clara team has won the
two games played against Stanford
this year and on their home grounds
should make a strong bid to win the
third contest. In anticipation of this,
Coach Peters will send in his best
team and attempt to bring back the
first victory from the Catholic College
players. Since Tuesday the men have
been going through strenuous practice,
with the result that the playing of
yesterday afternoon was much better
than that of last week. Both in
batting and fielding the squad is
steadily improving, and with the con
tinuation of good weather will have
a strong lead to fall back upon when
the rains finally set in.
Both of the pitchers, Couch and
Jones, will make the trip, although the
former will probably do the twirling.
Scofield will catch and the remainder
of the line-up will be the same as on
last Tuesday. An extra outfielder
and infielder will also acompany the
team. Following is the line-up that
will start the play: Couch, pitcher;

right.
