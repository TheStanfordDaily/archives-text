Editor Daily Palo Alto:
May I lie permitted to say a word in
hearty approval of the recent decision
of the Senior Class to take a formal
part in the observance of Founders'
Day. It seems so very appropriate
that the men and women, who for four
years have enjoyed all the good things
of Stanford, should look upon Found
ers Day with an especial regard, that
it is difficult to undei stand why some
former class did not earn the privilege
of establishing so fitting a custom. No
public exercise of the year should
lie more generally attended by the en
tire university community than that
which marks the anniversary of the
birth of Leland Stanford and which
now commemorates the two founders
of the University. But it will require
a little forethought on the part of all
of us to keep the morning of March 9
free from conflicting engagements, for
this year Founders' Day falls on
Saturday.
Three years ago, on this occasion,
President Jordan delivered a eulogy
of Mrs. Stanford in which he gave a
resume of Ihe history of the Univer
sity, which should be known by every
student. It is surprising, at times,
how little some of us, who have been
Â»
at Stanford for several years, know
about the founding of the University
and the early days of bitter trial. Few
of the present generation heard the
address delivered, but all may read it
for it was published in The Popular
Science Monthly for August, 1909, and
reprints are available for use in the
Library.
Very truly yours,
PAYSON J. TREAT.
