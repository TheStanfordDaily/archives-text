# MORGAN DEFEATS MURRAY IN SPEEDY TENNIS BOUT
## SENIOR WINS FINALS MATCH IN FIRST ROUND. Pratt and Murray Annex Doubles Championship, Defeating Sheldon and Hutchinson. 
### 
By defeating R. L. Murray, '13, on
the Encina Courts yesterday afternoon,
11. S. Morgan, '12, won the first of the
Varsity try-out tournaments. The
score was G-3, 9-7, and 8-fi. The games
were stubbornly contested and al
though Murray was unable to take a
set, he kept Morgan hard at work un
til the last point was netted by the
Senior player. Murray's serving and
driving were terrific and but- for the
additional speed and inside play de
veloped to a. high degree by Morgan
he would have been returned the win
ner.
In the last match of the semi-finals,
Murray defeated V. Sheldon, '15, 8-6,
7-9, 7-9, S-6, and 6-4. This match
took three and a half hours to play.
The fifth set was stopped on account
of darkness with the score standing
at 4-4, and was completed the next day,
when Murray annexed the next two
games.
The second round of the try-outs
is now in progress and will probably
be completed this week.
The Juniors won the Interclasa
Doubles Championship from the
Freshmen in three straight sets. The
scores were, 6-3, 7-5, and G-2. The
upperclass team was composed of F. S.
Pratt and R. L. Murray while the first
year men were represented by V. Shel
don and W. Hutchinson. The match
was hotly contested and was much
closer than the score would indicate.
To accommodate the crowds that
witness the Intercollegiate tennis on
the local courts, bleachers are to be
erected between the courts and the
trolley tracks within the next two
weeks.
