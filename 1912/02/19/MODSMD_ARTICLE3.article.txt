# DR. GRENFELL TALKS ON ARCTIC LIFE AND LABOR
## Men Who Go Down to Sea in Ships Subject of Entertaining Address by Medical Missionary. 
### 
"Fishermen are men. There are
other bipeds called men, but they often
lack a sane mind and the courage
strong in danger of the men who go
down to the sea in ships."
Thus Wilfred Thomason Grenfell,
who modestly disclaim;; ihe Sir, in an
Assembly today, explained why lie
found enjoyment in his ministrations
to ihe people among the windswept
rocks on the bleak coast of Labrador.
Sir Wilfred is superintendent of the
Labrador branch of the Royal National
Mission to Deep Sea Fishermen, and
medical adviser to the Hudson Bay
company.
President Jordan introduced Mr.
Grenfell as the man "who took the
toughest job offered in His Majesty's
possessions and made good at it."
Arctic Life Worth Living'.
"The belief that life isn't worth liv
ing up in the cold on the borders of
civilization is a great mistake," said
Mr. Grenfell, "It is a fact that expert
surgeons from Harvard and other
great universities are working for
almost nothing up there; unless you
call nothing the unselfish labor of
ministering to the weak and helpless
and making men's lives easier in a
hard country.
"1 will tell you a little story to show
you how the men of the north sea take
rebuffs. A hard wind drove the
schooner of an old skipper onto the
rocks on the eve of his retirement,
losing all that he had saved to take
up his long vacation from toil. When
we pulled him from the wreckage of
his boat, he was so glad his life was
saved that not once in tlie three days
he stayed with me did he complain of
hi* loss.
"Vet me:i i:i civilization run squealing
for help when anything gets the matt?-
with them. Nervous prostration might
be infinitely better calle.l 'nervous
prosperity.'
\ Venture of Faith.
"While tinkering with men's bodies
in tiie slums of London, I learned thai
there was another way of saving men
whole, body and soul, by spiritual
force. As there were more surgeon:

than work fort hem in London, I ac
cepted the call to Labrador in a pure
venture of faith." This was the
simple explanation of Mr. Grenfell's
mission to the North.
"A system of religion which talks
the cures of 1900 years ago couldn't
sell serum 011 that argument," lie con
tinued, "You must go out and show
people. So I went up among the 30,-
000 fisher folk cruising the Labrador
banks.
"The people naturally at first were
afraid of Jhe graveless knife, we had
to operate on some with six men sit
ting on them, and the fear of going to
sleep made the administration of
anaesthetics difficult.
"The inability of feeding children
properly was another problem in
which we tried to assist the mothers
of the North. You can't bring up a
baby on hard biscuit and be proud of
it afterwards. By teaching proper
feeding we are able to save the babies
before they come to us with rickets."
1 ive Hospitals Established.
Mr. Grenfell told of the work of the
five hospitals he established on the
coast of Labrador, mere shacks, it is
true, but efficient in saving lives by
first hand methods as the larger insti
tutions of civilization; of the propaga
tion of reindeer for food and clothing;
and of the great aid rendered by uni
versity students who came North to
show the people how to make living
more comfortable by modern methods
in engineering and science.
"Don't think that the work you are
doi.ig here is not the work you are ex
pected to do," said Mr. Grenfell in con
clusion. "Not all of you are expected
to bo surgeons in Labrador. Never
theless, the humors of life are great
there as elsewhere. Even if we do
eat more seagull than turkey, our di
gestions probably are the better for if."
Mr. Grenfell has been a medical
missionary to Labrador for twenty
years. He is skipper of his own supply
v; j sjcl to the North from Boston, be
cause, he says, he finds as much jo\
in sailing it as he did in playing i'oot
ball In Oxford.
