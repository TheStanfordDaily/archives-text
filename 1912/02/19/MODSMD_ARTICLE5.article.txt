was later caught at the plate when he
attempted to come home on an infield
hit to short. Tramutola reached first
on this play and went to second when
Jacobs walked. Couch then threw
the ball to center and both advanced
a base. The former scored on a wild
pitch, while the latter came in on Cass'
error. In the fifth inning, the home
team collected two hits with only one
out, but a fast double play killed any
chance of scoring.
Stanford's first run came in the third
inning when Terry received a pass,
was sent to third by Cass' hit, and came
home on an error. In the sixth frame,
Gilfillan singled and allowed Gault
to run for him. The latter stole second
and scored on Noble's three-bagger to
deep right.
SCinford Wins in Eighth.
The game was won in the eighth inn
ing after two men were out. Halm
reached safe 011 Zarich's error and was
advanced on Noble's second hit of the
day. Then, with the score tied, two
men on bases, and two outs, Scofield
singled to left and brought in the
winning runs.
The Stanford catcher threw three
men out on the bases and figured at
the end of a pretty double play which
cut off a score at the plate. Couch
allowed but five hits, while he struck
out seven men and issued but
two walks. After the first inn
ing, he settled down and continued
tf> improve as the game progressed.
At short, Terry accepted eleven
chances without a slip, while Best,
playing center for the Catholic College,
took in five long flies.

o|)i)urtune hitting won for the Var-
I sity on Saturday when Stanford annex
ed the fii*3t game of the year from
Santa Clara by a score of 4-2.
The game was a fast, close contest
all the way through, and the final
victory was well earned in overcoming
! a lead of two runs made by Santa
! Clara in the first inning. Sharp hitting
brought in three of Stanford's scores,
while the Varsity got out of bad places
in the late stages of the game by ex
ceptionally fast fielding.
Santa Clara Scores First.
Santa Clara took the lead in the
first inning with two runs. Zarich,
first man up, hit for three bases, but
was later caught at the plate when he
attempted to come home on an infield
hit to short. Tramutola reached first
on this play and went to second when
Jacobs walked. Couch then threw
the ball to center and both advanced
a base. The former scored on a wild
pitch, while the latter came in on Cass'
error. In the fifth inning, the home
team collected two hits with only one
out, but a fast double play killed any
chance of scoring.
Stanford's first run came in the third
inning when Terry received a pass,
was sent to third by Cass' hit, and came
home on an error. In the sixth frame,
Gilfillan singled and allowed Gault
to run for him. The latter stole second
and scored on Noble's three-bagger to
deep right.
SCinford Wins in Eighth.
The game was won in the eighth inn
ing after two men were out. Halm
reached safe 011 Zarich's error and was
advanced on Noble's second hit of the
day. Then, with the score tied, two
men on bases, and two outs, Scofield
singled to left and brought in the
winning runs.
The Stanford catcher threw three
men out on the bases and figured at
the end of a pretty double play which
cut off a score at the plate. Couch
allowed but five hits, while he struck
out seven men and issued but
two walks. After the first inn
ing, he settled down and continued
tf> improve as the game progressed.
At short, Terry accepted eleven
chances without a slip, while Best,
playing center for the Catholic College,
took in five long flies.
