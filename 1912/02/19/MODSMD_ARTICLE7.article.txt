# Debating.
## 
### 
If Friday's meeting of the debaters
can lie taken as any criterion, de
bating is on its last less here. In

response to a call for
men to try-out for posi
tions on the Tri-State

team, six men appeared. Of this num
ber, one only was a member of the
Freshman class.
Practically one third of the men
registered in the University are trying
for positions on the crew, baseball or
track teams. When their number is
compared with the six who are out
for the Stanford debating team, the
disparity is startling.
The two debating clubs have com
batted for several years the growing
disposition to regard debating as a
form of licensed foolishness, but ap
parently have been unable to stem the
tide or stir up much interest in their
work. This outcome is unwarranted,
for the man who represents Stanford
in a debate, represents the University
as truly as does the athlete on the
football field and we can see neither
rhyme nor reason in the arguments of
those who disparage debating.
With the annual Carnot and Inter
collegiate contests with the University
of California, the Tri-State, the Inter
class and the various special debates,
opportunities exist for a score or more
of men to become finished debaters
and accomplished public speakers.
