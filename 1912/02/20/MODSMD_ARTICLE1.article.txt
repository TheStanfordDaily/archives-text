Marking the initial contest since
soccer was adopted as a minor inter
collegiate sport, th" elevens of Stan
ford and California will compete on
tli 1 ' turf field, Thursday afternoon.
The contest will also be the first of
the series of games for the Williamson
trophy. Coach 11. W. Maloney and
Captain .1. L. Reynolds will place the
strongest team possible on the field.
The constant improvement which the
Cardinal players have shown during
tli â–  season augurs well for the success
of the team in the Washington's birth
day contest.
The game will be called at 2:30.
.lame.; McKeizie of the Barbarian club
will act as referee. He is one of the
be : olficials and experts of the game
on the Pacific coast.
C. Y. Williamson is the donor of the
trophy, which will be awarded to the
victor for one year's keeping after the
contest. The cup is a handsomely de
signed affair, and shows two players,
representing the rival universities, in
action. Williamson is the president of
the Barbarian club of San Francisco,
and has been acting as the coach of
tlie California eleven.
The men who participate in the con
test will be awarded the minor "S"
emblem the same as the tennis players
receive. Stanford will send the follow
ing line-up against the Californians:
Butcher, goal: McCann, King, backs;
Hilton. Reynolds. Williams, halt's: A.
ISrb, 1?. Erb, Pellas. Fvfe, Higgins, for
wards.
Twice before have the two univer
sity soccer elevens met. In both con
tests the Cardinal players have been
victorious. The California team has
steadily improved, however, and has
been putting up an excellent variety
o:' soccer of late. Stanford has shown
to particular advantage in the games
with the strong league teams and a
conservative prediction gives the vic
tory to the Cardinal.
