# BIG JOLLY-UP FOR THE UPPER CLASSES COMING
## INFORMALITY TO BE WATCHWORD TO-MORROW EVENING. 1911 as Host to Provide Unusual and Delightful Refreshments and "Stunts." 
### 
As one of their final tastes of college
joys before being "whirled in the
world," the classes of 1933, 1912 et
supra, will jolly-up to-morrow in the
Armory. "To jolly,-up," the verb, and
"jolly-up,"the noun, are words peculiar
to Stanford. To the class of 1911, which
is to give this affair, belongs the credit
of first attaching to them their pres
ent significance. In other words, the
1911 students originated the "jolly-up"
as it now exists. Recalling the early
dances of this nature, President David
Starr Jordan recently said, "I was
present at one of the first jolly-ups
and had a thoroughly good time.
While I must be in Watsonville in
body Wednesday night. I will be with
you in spirit."
Dancing to-morrow evening will be
gin promptly at S:ir». Extra cars to
accommodate the crowd will leave the
campus at 8:00. It, is intended that
the old rule, "no queening, coming or
going," shall be observed to the letter.
Informal clothing, including soft
shirts for the men, will be decidely
in order.
It is stated by the committee in
charge of this affair that it is in no
sense a money-making proposition.
All receipts left over after paying
necessary expenses will go to the
Stanford Union and the Women's
I Clubhouse, share and share alike.
I The usual admission fee, fifty cents,
I will be charged, and as great numbers
have signified their intention of going,
a good sum should be realized for
these two institutions.
As to the nature of refreshments
and entertainment, a deep air of mys
tery is being maintained by the 1911
men, but enough has become known to
justify the statement that they will be
novel and enjoyable. Thi - will be es
pecially true of the "feed." The
"stunts" also are advertised as amus
ing and full of "pep" that they will
distribute that valuable asset over the
whole company. Owing to engage
| ments in San Francisco. 11. W. Ma
locey and H. V. Poor. '10. will not be
able to fence as was advertised, but
new features of equal merit will take
their place. The Ram's Head intends
to spring some surprises in its por
tion of the entertainment, and the
Gym Club is now in fine thane for the
best performance it has ever given.
What the decorations in the Vrmory
will be is not known, and whether the
mysterious signs which the 1911 men
are painting today have anything to
do with them is an open.question.

As one of their final tastes of college
joys before being "whirled in the
world," the classes of 1933, 1912 et
supra, will jolly-up to-morrow in the
Armory. "To jolly,-up," the verb, and
"jolly-up,"the noun, are words peculiar
to Stanford. To the class of 1911, which
is to give this affair, belongs the credit
of first attaching to them their pres
ent significance. In other words, the
1911 students originated the "jolly-up"
as it now exists. Recalling the early
dances of this nature, President David
Starr Jordan recently said, "I was
present at one of the first jolly-ups
and had a thoroughly good time.
While I must be in Watsonville in
body Wednesday night. I will be with
you in spirit."
Dancing to-morrow evening will be
gin promptly at S:ir». Extra cars to
accommodate the crowd will leave the
campus at 8:00. It, is intended that
the old rule, "no queening, coming or
going," shall be observed to the letter.
Informal clothing, including soft
shirts for the men, will be decidely
in order.
It is stated by the committee in
charge of this affair that it is in no
sense a money-making proposition.
All receipts left over after paying
necessary expenses will go to the
Stanford Union and the Women's
I Clubhouse, share and share alike.
I The usual admission fee, fifty cents,
I will be charged, and as great numbers
have signified their intention of going,
a good sum should be realized for
these two institutions.
As to the nature of refreshments
and entertainment, a deep air of mys
tery is being maintained by the 1911
men, but enough has become known to
justify the statement that they will be
novel and enjoyable. Thi - will be es
pecially true of the "feed." The
"stunts" also are advertised as amus
ing and full of "pep" that they will
distribute that valuable asset over the
whole company. Owing to engage

able to fence as was advertised, but
new features of equal merit will take
their place. The Ram's Head intends

best performance it has ever given.
