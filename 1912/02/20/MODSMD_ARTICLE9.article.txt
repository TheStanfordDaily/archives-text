# WOMEN ARE TO EDIT TO-MORROW'S "DAILY."
## Miss V. Moore, '12, Will be Editor-in-Chief of the Annual Edition. 
### 
With the staid masculine hand de
parted from the helm, the Daily Palo
Alto will to-mororw sail into untravel
ed seas. The Woman's Number will
appear in the unwonted disguise of a
sporting edition. Stories of baseball,
track and crew, written in the most
approved impressionistic style, will
hold the places of honor on the first
page.
Miss Virginia Moore, '12, one of the
Assistant Editors of the Daily, and
President of the Women's Press Club,
will be Editor-in-chief. She has de
tailed the Varsity crew assignment to
Miss Callie Smith, '14, and the baseball
to Miss Lois Baker, '13. The latter
journalist was present in the Press
Box at, this afternoon's baseball game,
deftly taking notes and scanning the
scorebook. Their story of the game
will appear to-morrow, displaying, it
is rumored, a command of baseball
slang calculated to make the com
plexion of any metropolitan sporting
editor turn yellow with envy. To
night's issue publishes only the score
of this game.
The other editors of to-morrow's edi
tion will be Miss Carol Green, '14,
Miss Mildred Gibbet, '13, Miss Mar
jorie Tisdale, '12, Miss Helen Krets,
'15, Miss Marjorie Driscoll, '12, and
Miss Frances Willey, '15. The issue
will be the regular annual Women's
Edition.
