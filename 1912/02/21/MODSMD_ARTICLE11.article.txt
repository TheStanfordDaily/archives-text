A long-felt need is at last being
established among the women at
Stanford in the form of the Loan and

Emergency Fund. By this
means, temporary aid may be
given any woman student dur
ing her college course, when

ever it is found necessary. Such funds
have been established at other colleges
in the east and at the University of
California. This work is certainly to
be commended.
Collectors have been appointed in
every house and dormitory on the cam
pus; and as the work done along this
line depends largely on the support
given, it is hoped that every woman
will do something to support so worthy
a cause.
