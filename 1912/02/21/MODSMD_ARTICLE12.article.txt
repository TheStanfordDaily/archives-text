A tradition long in vogue at Stan
ford is gradually being abolished by
the Senior women ceasing to appear
in their caps and gowns on Wednes
days, Fridays and on the days of As
sembly. The few that do adhere to
this custom, by failing to group them
selves. together in the senior section
at Assembly, make this fact still more
noticeable. If you have never pur
chased a cap and gown, get oneâ€”if
you have one, wear it.
