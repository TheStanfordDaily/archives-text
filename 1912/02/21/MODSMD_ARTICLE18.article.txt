# ECONOMICS CLUB IS ORGANIZED BY WOMEN.
## 
### 
The Women's Economics Club lias
been organized and is making its pres
ence felt as a rival to a similar men's
organization. At a pink tea given by
â€¢Mrs. H. A. Millis on last Saturday, the
club was organized with a member
ship of nineteen women who are Eco
nomics majors, and the wives of the
Economics faculty. The club will fur
ther complete its organization and ma
ture its plans at a tea to be given by
Mrs. Burt Estes Howard on next Fri
day.
Meetings will be held every fort
night where live topics will be dis
cussed; the various fields of women's
service in the world will be investi
gated and tabulated, and in addition
to this, the political side of femininity
is to be developed, that these twen
tieth century suffragists may be more
tit to bear the responsibility of citi
zenship.
In order that the club may not con
tain femininity to satiety, prominent
men are to be imported, who will ad
dress the club on topics of current
interest, but other than this, it will
be a distinctly feminine organization.
