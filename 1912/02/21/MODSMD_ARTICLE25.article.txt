# MUCH IS PLEDGED FOR WOMAN'S CLUB HOUSE.
## Collectors Are Now at Work Securing Pledges From the New Girls. 
### 
Twelve thousand, one hundred dol
lars pledged toward the Woman's Club
House, nearly ten thousand of this in
actual cash, and one hundred and six
ty-five paid up life members; this en
couraging report brings the actual
building much nearer the realm of
possibility.
An active interest is being exhibited
among the new women. By no means
all of the collectors have turned in
their reports, but at present a total
of four hundred dollars represents a
good "nest egg" for 1915. Collectors
in all of the girls' houses report enthu
siastic promises. Mariposa Club heads
the list of actual contributors with a
total of one hundred and twenty-five
dollars. Roble, where the majority o.
the new girls have not yet handed in
their pledge cards, is second with
eighty dollars on hand.
Each dollar pledged means a hasten
ing of the day when the actual materi
als will be gathered for the building
of the Women's Club House.
Therefore, every one is urged to
save her pennies, for every contribu
tion, be it in cents or dollars, is count
ed toward a life membership or an
nual dues.
The greater share of the money has
not come through full life member
ships, but through smaller pledges and
through the contributions of the girls'
organization from stunt parties or en
tertainments.
