# Kirby Will Address Encina Men.
## 
### 
Monday night, Gustavus T. Kirby,
president of the Amateur Athletic
Union of the United States, will speak
to the men of the University in Encina
Hall at 7:15. Mr. Kirby will be the
guest of the Athletic Board and will
speak on the subject of amateur ath
letics. He has acted as a referee at
various meets on his way west from
his headquarters in New York, and has
spent several days in Los Angeles.
Mr. Klrby probably knows more
about amateur athletics in the United
States than anyone else and is in a
position to give a very interesting talk
Monday night.
