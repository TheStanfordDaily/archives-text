# FASHION SHOW WILL ATTRACT ATTENTION
## PROMINENT STANFORD SOCIETY LEADERS TO PARADE. Procession Will be Accompanied by Orchestra in Line of March. 
### 
Just as the fashion-lovers of Paris
(lock to Longchamps yearly for the an
nual display of the very latest modes,
the Stanford perusers of the Good
Taste in Dress columns will he on
hand to-morrow morning to witness
the initial appearance of some superb
examples of the costumier's art. The
shops of Worth, Paquin and the great-
I est artists in dress of Paris, will be
I represented, and it is expected that
some unusual and striking styles will
I appear for the first time. The gowns
j will lie worn by the most beautiful
mannequins to be found, and a feature
iof exceptional interest will be the
participation in the parade of several
j prominent society leaders whose
' names have been withheld from publi
j cation at the earnest request of their
j fraternities.
The parade will begin promptly
j some time during l lie morning and will
j proced down the Row, stopping at tre
| quent intervals for the better inspec
tion of the handsome gowns by the
| throngs of spectators that are expect
-led to line the sidewalks. A special
I visit will be paid to Roble Hall. Fol
: lowing the usual custom of these an
| nual exhibitions, a large orchestra will
j accompany the procession during the
j entire line of march, rendering classic
i selections. Several of these musical
I selections will be further illustrated
| with aesthetic dances by the partici
j pants in the fashion show, and the
| graceful movements of the accomplish
ed dancers will serve to exhibit the
j perfect lines of the new styles and
j their adaptability to the expression of
the meaning and emotion of the music.
Committee Maintains Secrecy.
Thoes in charge of the fashion pa-
J rade are jealously guarding the de
| tails of the affair, and only the smalf
| est glimpse in advance has been allow
jed the general public. Rumor whis
l pers, however, that the exhibition this
I
| year will far outshine all others of
j previous seasons, and that the spring
styles as illustrated to-morrow will
create a furor among the socially-
I elite of the campus, resulting in the
, appearance of many gorgeous and
j elaborate gowns at the spring func
tions.
