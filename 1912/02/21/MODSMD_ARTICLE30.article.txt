# Women's Crew Starts Training.
## 
### 
Women's Crew season has opened
with a long list of improvements. In
the boat house there are twenty new
lockers which can be rented at twenty
five cents the semester, by application
to Miss E. Crosby, '12, captain of the
crew. There are new seats ordered
for the barge and racks for the oars.
In their enthusiasm the crew mem
bers themselves turned out and re
painted the two rowboats.
