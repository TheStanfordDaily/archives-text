# SOCIAL SERVICE CLUB PLANS SEMESTER'S WORK
## SOCIAL SERVICE CLUB PLANS SEMESTER'S WORK. Trips of Investigation to San Francisco Included in Program For Year. 
### 
Dr. Grenfell's doctrine of seizing the
opportunity nearest at hand is well
demonstrated in the work of a very
practical and instructive character,
which is reported as the result of the
active interest shown by the women in
the Social Service Club this semester.
This afternoon the second class
of sewing in the Mayfield schools was
successfully conducted. This class
meets every Wednesday from two
thirty to four. There are already three
sections formed, each with over twen
ty pupils. The work is being conduct
ed under Miss A. Ahlswede, '13, and
any women who can offer their teach
ing services will find a splendid oppor
tunity to accomplish practical ends by
letting her know of their willingness.
The weekly trips of investigation to
the city offer another field for those
interested in a study of sociological
conditions. Last Saturday, a party of
six, under the guidance of Mrs.
Fletcher, a former Stanford woman,
and first probation officer of San Fran
cisco, made an extended visit to San
Francisco institutions. This included
the Juvenile Court, where Mr. Astreda
gave them an interesting description
of his work, the Detention Home,
People's Place, Miss Adam's settle
ment in the Italian quarter, the North
Beach Playground, where Miss Edna
Hayward, '10, is superintendent of the
Girls' Division, the Telegraph Hill
Settlement, and the Associated Chari
ties.
Will Visit Missions.
Next Saturday, February 24, ar
rangements have been made for a par
ty of ten to visit some of these same
places as well as two Chinese Missions
and the Children's Hospital. Anyone
wishing to join this party must notify
the Social Service chairman, Miss M.
Lothrop, at once.
On Friday, March 1, an unusual op
portunity to witness the practical
work of the Associated Charities ia
promised to those who can go to see
the foster mothers bring in their ba
bies for the free clinic.
Some of this party will spend the
night at Miss Adams' settlement, and
join others on Saturday morning for
another visiting tour. Those who are
to be included in these trips will hold
several meetings beforehand to read
and discuss the interesting experiences
of well known social workers.
Make Study of Institutions.
Members of the Club are also mak
ing a special study of county institu
tions for the care of the poor and sick,
both government and private. Later
trips will be made to San Jose.
Another feature of the Good Cheer
work is the sending of letters to
"shut-ins" and flowers to hospitals.
Those who are willing to assist in this
are urged to send their names to Miss
M. Lathrop.
In Palo Alto, friendly visits, under
the supervision of Dr. Gardner, oc
cupy the attention of another section
of the club. Miss M. Tisdale, '14, is at
the head of this sub-committee.
The work of the club, including, as
it does, investigations in San Francisco
and San Jose, and practical work in
Mayfield and Palo Alto, has also an
important field on our own campus,
in the collection and management of
the new Loan and Emergency Fund.
