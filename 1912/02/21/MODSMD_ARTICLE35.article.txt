# "CHRISTOPHER JR." TO REHEARSE IN HALL
## EXCELLENT PROGRESS IS MADE BY SOPHOMORES. Last Act of Play is Laid in India, Insuring Picturesque Staying. 
### 
The cast of "Christopher, Junior,"
will have its first rehearsal in Assem
bly Hall, 011 Saturday. Coach F. L.
Mathieu plans to have the work run
throughout the day. .Mr. Mat' n.i is
very much pleased with the splendid
progress that has been made. Already
the play is rounding into shape with
ease that promises a finished produc
tion. In many cases the Sophomore
play casts are necessarily made up of
inexperienced actors, but among the
members of the cast of the '14 play are
several who have appeared upon the
stage at various times. E. Wells made
a decided hit both in the 15)12 Junior
Opera and in this year's Football
Show. Miss C. Green has had some
stage experience, appearing in "Fa
tinitza," "The Mikado," and the 1012
Junior Opera. Miss H. Bullard took
part in"The Uvernian Princess" and
in the shadow play of "Fatinitza."
T. H. Claussen had a part in"The
Compromise," which he managed very
creditably. Miss V. Howard, while she
has had no experience on the Stan
ford stage, was a star in many of the
Palo Alto high school productions.
The whole cast has been working
consistently and well and this work,
coupled with the talent of the individ
uals, can not help but make a fine
showing. The extra week for rehears
ing which has accidentally been given
to the Sophomores will doubtless
lull) to make each detail perfect.
England seems to be the favorite
setting of playwrights, and from this
we would infer that it is also a favor
ite of theatregoers. The early scenes
of "Christopher, Junior" are laid 011
this ever charming and ever interest
ing island. The time is the present,
which necessitates costumes in the
style of today.
It is in the later scenes that the
setting is changed to India. The India
portrayed is the India of today, with
out its wild barbarity of former times
but still with a mysterious oriental
interest.
