# WOMEN'S BASKETBALL SHOWS GOOD PROGRESS
## WOMEN ARE PRACTICING FOR INTERCOLLEGIATE MATCHES. Games to be Played Next Week Will Decide the Interclass Championship. 
### 
I am opposed to Women's In
tercollegiate Basketball because
tlie less we have of It the more
real basket-hall we have. 1 am
heartily in favor of the frame
as it is being 1 played here at
the present time. â€”I)r. Angel I.

April 20, the
morning of the an
nual track meet,
has been selected
as the date for
the Women's In
tercollegiate Ten
nis Match, and at
this time, with
the Encina courts
as the place,
will wrest the

palm of victory from their Berkeley
sisters.
Stanford women basketball players
are longing for the time when basket
ball will again be upon an intercolle
giate basis. Should the girls meet
California this year they are confident
of their ability to put a team into the
field which would beat anything that
California has, for never before has
the squad been larger or the standard
of play higher than it is at the present
time. Under the able leadership of
B. Whelan, '12, and the capable coach
ing of Miss M. Cleveland the team has
picked up all the fine points of scien
tific basketball. Miss Whelan is not
only one of the best centers who has
ever been at Stanford, but is also a
good all-round player and a clever
leader. Miss Cleveland is a former
intercollegiate player from the Uni
versity of California. Under her tu
telage a squad of about sixty players
is drilled in the fine points of the
game.
Six Veterans Eligible.
Six girls who have won their letters
against California are in college: B.
Haig, A. Yoch, R. Sampson, B. Whelan,
R. Overman, D. Alderton, and are play
ing greatly improved games, forming
a nucleus for a prospective varsity,
which will probably be chosen later
if any outside contests are arranged.
Among the new material E. Parker, '12,
and K. Imtz, '12, members of the Santa
Ana High team winning the champion
ship of the south, and later Pomona
College stars, M. (lard, the 'l. r > captain,
M. Boyd, '14, and M. Chandler, '14, are
proving themselves close seconds to
the veterans.


Miss H. Whelan,'l2
The inter-class championship will
be played off during the last two weeks
of March. 1912, which defeated all
comers last year, will make a strong
bid to retain the championship. Five
members of last year's '12 team are
in college, R. Overman, captain and
side center, D. Alderton, side center,
B. Whelan, touch center, A. Yoch, goal,
and H. Van Zwalenburg, guard. '12
also draws heavily from the new ma
terial. '14 will win an easy second
place. The Sophomores are captained
by E. Ellis. The '13 team is by no
means out of the running. M. Hop
wood heads the '13 nine.
The attendance at last year's intor
class series reached the two hundred
mark, and an even greater interest is
being manifested this year.
