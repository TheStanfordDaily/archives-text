# IRELAND AND VARSITY MEET IN FOURTH GAME
## IMPRESSIONS OF EVENT BY STAFF SOB SISTER. Terry, Beeger and Dent Are Ones to Win the Admiration of Bleachers. 
### 
Ireland's Independents defeated the
Varsity for the fourth time this season
011 the turf, yesterday, score 3-0.
Mr. Terry, assisted by fifteen others,
played the loveliest game, but I didn't
pay much attention to hits or runs, be
cause I was so busy watching the cute
ittle marks which the man was putting
in the score book. Everyone got so
excited, hoping the Varsity would
score, but no one was thrilled when
the visitors got a run.
Mr. Beeger played an elegant game
in right field, and was perfectly cun
ning once, when he caught a ball from
an Ireland man called Shrimp, or
something like that. Mr. Noble didn't
appear in the same suit of new blue
which he has been wearing all season.
Query: Who is his dressmaker? No
body liked the, umpires; they were the
meanest things, and called a man out
when he didn't have a single straight
ball; they were all curved! Mr.
Hagerman was so kindhearted that he
wouldn't venture to torment the ball.
Wasn't that silly! Mr. Gilfillan reach
ed for the ball twice, but his arm
wasn't long enough, and Mr. Dooling
failed to grasp the spheroid. Optician,
bring some glasses for these gentle
men!
.Jones Inspires Poetry.
When Jones came up he reminded
me of a poem:
"There was a young player called
Jones,
Who could strike the pitch in all
tones.
But as a baseball man
He resembles a fan
And should take to rolling the
bones."
"Dynamo" Cass arose with the cryp
tic remark. "Howdy gents" and gently
fanned three times. He went down
amidst loud applause.
Dent was a whiz. His jack-knife
style of catching is certainly classy.
The runs were made in the follow
ing innings:
Second liming.
Kennedy singled and Gianinni hit to
deep center for a home run, scoring
Kennedy. Two runs.
Seventh Inning.
Ireland singled to center. Dooling
hit to Gilfillan, who tagged out Ire
land and then threw wild to first, ad
vancing the runners to second and
third. Egan scored on a passed ball.
Swain struck out. One run.
