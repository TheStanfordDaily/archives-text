## 
### 
With the division of the Football
Show profits between the Stanford
Union and the Woman's Club House,
the totals reached by both organiza
tions have been raised to a consider
able extent.
The total receipts from the show
were $r>:54.84. Of this, two-thirds, or
$356.56, has lieen turned over to the
Stanford Union, and the remainder,
$178.28, lias been given to the Woman's
Club House.
Much satisfaction is felt over the
excellent financial results of the show,
especially when the unusually large
expense incurred in staging such a
performance, is taken into account.
