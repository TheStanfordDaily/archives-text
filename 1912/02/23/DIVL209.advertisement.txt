There's a difiVrence
in the ideas of womankind as to
the amount of wear that clothes
will stand before losing so:ne of
their daintiness.
Cleaning and Pressing,
if done well, render a substantial
garment as good as new in ap
pearance and prolong the gar
ment's life. Our work is skilful—
Our prices are moderate.
