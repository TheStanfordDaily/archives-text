# Resolutions.
## 
### 
The recent action of the Senior class
in expressing its disapproval of the

use of unfair means in
examinations has es
tablished a precedent

which is already felt. Contained in
to-night's issue is an account of the
resolution passed by the Skull and
Snakes society in regard to the same
matter.
This is the right attitude to assume,
but unless some positive action is
taken by the members of these organi
zations, the resolutions will be merely
waste paper. When the Seniors feel
individually responsible for the con
duct of examinations, and will act in
accordance, then, and then only, will
cheating bo reduced to a minimum.
