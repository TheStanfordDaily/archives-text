# JUNIOR OPERA CHORUS TO REHEARSE TO-MORROW.
## Beauty Chorus to Receive Special Attention.â€”Everyone Must be Present. 
### 
The Assembly Hall stage saw the
second general rehearsal of the 1913
Junior o]>; j ra, "The Girl and tlie Voice"
last evening. So rapidly are things
progressing under the able direction
oi' Coach Caiiyle, that, contrary to the
usual run of amateur operatic produc
tions, the performance is already as
suming tangible form. The chorus,
songs and dances have been rapidly
learned and are now almost mastered.
To-morrow morning another re
hearsal will be held in the Assembly
Hall, The two nehearsals held so far
have been largely confined to the
"pony" chorus, but to-morrow's prac
tise will l:e chiefly devoted to the
"beauty" chorus. The more complex
of the feature numbers will be re
hearsed for the first time. Because of
the extremely rapid progress which is
being made it will be necessary for
everyone who expects to take part in
the final chorus to 1)3 present to-mor
row morning.
Coach Carlyle announce* that the
roll will he called, and that 110 excuses
for absence will be accepted. It is es
pecially important that the members
of the "beauty" chorus he present.
From now on the work will be evenly
divided among the two choruses. All
the men who have chorus parts are
also requested to be present under
penalty of losing their places. The
rehearsal will commence promptly at
9:30 and everyone is expected to he
there at that time.
