# STANFORD SOCCER TEAM DEFEATS CALIFORNIANS
## CARDINAL ELEVEN OUTCLASSED BLUE AND GOLD. Williamson Trophy Goes to Winner For Year's Possession.— Players Will Receive Emblems. 
### 
Outplaying their intercollegiate
rivals by a far greater margin than
the final score would indicate, the
Stanford soccer team was the winner
in tl 1 ? Washington's birthday match
with California by a score of 4 to l!.
Possession of the Williamson trophy
for tae ensuing year also went with
the Cardinal victory. This was the
first match for the beautiful cup pre
sent*? I by C. Y. Wiliamson of the Bar
barian club for competition between
the two rival universities.
Only the brilliant stops of goal
keeper Barbara of the Blue and Gold
eleven prevented the Stanford players
from running up a much higher score.
The Californians showed marked im
provement in this game over their two
previous meetings with the Cardinal
but the Stanford soccerites outclassed
their opponents and deserved to have
the i atne of their Alma Mater engraved
first on the challenge trophy. The
eleven men who represented Stanford
yesterday will be awarded a minor
varsity insigna by the Executive Com
mittee.
Sidiiford made the first impression on
tne .score board. From a clever drib
bling rush Fyfe shot a clean goal to
the Blue and Gold net. I?. Erb, A. Erb,
Pellan, Fyfe and Higgins were respon
sible for the plays that resulted in
the remainder of the Cardinal points.
The initial point made by the Cali
fornians was the result of a fluke.
Cook, the Blue and Gold forward,
rushed the ball to McCann, the Stan
ford fullback and the ex-Cardinal
leader gave the ball an unfortunate
twist which sent it back into his own
goal. G. Davidson scored the second
point on a penalty kick.

Captain Reynolds at center half
made many brilliant plays and sharer! j
the honors for excel lent work with the j
men of the forward line. The aeeur- '
acy of the Cardinal team in handling
the ball was one of the features of the
contest.
The line-ups follow:
Varsity—A. Erb, B. Erb, Pellas, Fyfe,
Higgins, forwards; Hilton, Reynolds.
Williams, halfs; McCann, King, backs:
Butcher, goal.

Previous to the intercollegiate strug
gle, the second varsity eleven met a
nicked team of San Francisco players
c tyled the Wanderers. The contest
resulted in a drawn battle, the score
being 1 to 1. The visitors started off
with a rush and in the first few min
utes of play threatened their less ex
perienced opponents. Coach Maloney's
men showed plenty of fight and were
the aggressors throughout the contest
Steinhart scored the lone tally of
the Cardinal and McKenzie made the
visitors' goal.
