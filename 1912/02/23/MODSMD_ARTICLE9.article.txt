# STANFORD OUTPLAYED BY ST. MARY'S COLLEGE
## VARSITY LOSES POOR GAME ON ROUGH FIELD. Work of Pitcher Cann and the Umpire Too Much For the Cardinal Players. 
### 
Outplayed both at the hat and in the
field, Stanford lost to St. Mary's Col
lege, yesterday, 10-2, at Freeman's
Park in Oakland.
The pitching of Cann for St. Mary's
and the work of the umpire were of
great importance as to the final score.
| The southpaw had the string of Stan
j ford left-handers completely at his
j mercy and let them off with but four
hits while he struck out sixteen. For
five innings the work of the umpire
| was tolerated, but after he had
j rendered five questionable decisions
i against Stanford, three at the [date
I and two at second, he was ejected from
I the game to the satisfaction of both
i teams.
Howe was touched up for ten hits,
| four being two-baggers. The Fresh
| man pitcher did well at the bat by
bringing in one of Stanford's runs and
I
I getting two of the four hits. In the
j fourth inning, Beeger cut off a certain
i two-base hit in extreme right by catch
ing a long liner with his bare hand.
Pappa, first man up, connected for
two bases and scored on Fitzsimmon's
single. Two doubles and two errors
added three runs for the college play
j ers in the next inning. In the fifth
frame two hits, three bases on balls,
an error, and three unquestionably bad
decisions added five runs to the St.
Mary's score.
Up to the eighth inning Cass was
I the only Stanford man credited with a
hit. In that inning Howe hit safely,
I but no runs were scored. With one out
I in the ninth, Halm walked, and scored
; on Argabrite's three-bagger to left.
Dent then walked and Argabrite reach
ed the plate on Howe's single.
