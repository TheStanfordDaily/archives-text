'Tis strange indeed the various in
terpretations that are put upon the
simpest language. We rather enjoyed

the many and weird comments
of coast papers upon our edi
torial regarding dress suits, but
when we receive a communica-

tion such as graces the top of the ad
joining column it is to weep.
We do not remember ever saying
that blue shirts and corduroys should
replace evening clothes at all social
functions, as our friend apparently
supposes us to have said. But alas
and alackaday, the most cruel blow is
contained in the hidden implication
that the editor is a roughneck. This
grieves us deeply.
A. S. Tudent evidently thinks the
editor a veritable modern Don Quixote
who replaces the demon windmill with
a no le?s worthy opponent in the devil
of a dress suit. Let us make haste to
reassure the worried author that we
are not going to the demnition bow
wows because we say that a dress suit
is out of place at the Assembly Hall.
Our objection is confined exclusively
to the wearing of evening clothes at
the common campus theatrical produc
tion. To lessen the danger of A. S.
Tudent suffering from paresis as a re
sult of too strenuous thinking over the
weighty question of appropriate ap
parel for Junior week and to save him
from the egregious blunder of wearing
pink pajamas at the Prom, the editor
will permit the worthy gentleman, or
lady, as the case may be. to attend the
Junior festivities attired in a dress
suit, or charming bathing suit, as is
most becoming.
