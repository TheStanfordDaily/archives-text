In view of the tendency toward un
due "roughneckism" at Stanford, the
following may be of interest. The
blanks represent the name of a well
known State university.
"As to abolishing ihe present Prom
—no, no. Tame it, if you will, reduce
excessive expenditures, but don't de
mocratize it to such an extent that you
couldn't distinguish it from a typical
dance. The dress suit always
marks the cleavage between Ihe society
man and the non-society man. Abolish
that, and you will democratize youi
Prom into a dance. The house parties
bring together congenial groups Inr
three days and develope the gentleman
and the lady within the man and wo
man respectively. Abolish them, ami
you abolish th > main feature of Prom,
in our madness for democracy we be
gin to hate exclusiveness and
to talk about the aristrocracy and
snobbery, but kind friend sorely
needs a little of this 'aristrocracy.' if
(hat is what you wish to call it. We
need it sorely to counterbalance our
increasing failing of 'roughneckism.'
A knowledge of true etiquette, refined
manners, gentlemanly bearing, gal
lantry, dignity, and chivalry never yet
has been a detriment to the possessor.
It is these things that the Prom
fosters. 'Beautiful' the recent Prom
was described. Why? Because
men and women met like gentlemen
and ladies among surroundings of ar
tistic decorations and inspiring music.
If you are an economist, you have a
right to object to the expenditure of
fifty or seventy-five dollars for a social
event of this kind. You have a right
to abolish Prom, house-parties and all,
but, before you positively make up
your mind, inquire whether that money
would be spent along economic lines
if you would abolish Prom. Inquire
whether the promenaders did not save
the cost of Prom while you were in
vesting your 'change' in other amuse
ments, and lastly and most important
of all, inquire whether you have not
chained the artistic superman within
you who makes life worth while occa
sionally, just because he gives man
new experiences not necessarily in
accord with rigid economic laws."
