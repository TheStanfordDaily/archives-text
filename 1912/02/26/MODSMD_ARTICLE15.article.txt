### 
A very appreciative audience yester
day afternoon welcomed the return of
the old custom of Sunday afternon or
gan recitals, which had been discon
tinued on account of the destruction
worked by the earthquake.
In addition to the rendition of a
number of organ pieces by himself,
Professor G. C. Buehrer, accompanied
two singers and a violinist.
Mrs. Hillman-Smith sang Wagner's
"Elsa's Dream" and J. F. Jones ren
dered Gounod's "Lend Me Thine Aid."
M. Joulin, the well known violinist,
pleased all with his solo, "Menuette,"
by Beethoven.
