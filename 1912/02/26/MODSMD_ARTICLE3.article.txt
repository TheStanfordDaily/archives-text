### 
Do pite a biting wind which notice
i'dv acted as a hindrance to the Car
ilnal trackmen, several excellent per
formances were recorded on the Stan
ford oval Saturday morning. The re
sults of the competition gave "Dad"
Moulton and Captain Coleman an addi
tional basis on which to make their
selection of a team to represent Stan
ford against the University of Southern
California athletes. Several of the
Varsity men did not compete.
J. A. Miller, '13; raised his height in
the pole vault to an even twelve feet.
This is four inches better than the
winning mark made in the altitude
event in the 1911 intercollegiate meet
by the same vaulter.
In an exhibition jump G. L. Horine.
'13, just missed clearing the bar at 6
feet, r>Vi inches. He took first in the
regular leaping with a jump of 6 feet,
2% inches. W. R. Finney, '12, also
passed the six foot level and annexed
r-econd at C. feet. Viinch.
The sprinters paid little heed to the
weather conditions. In the century
E. P. Campbell, '13, breasted the tape
first in:10 1-5, and Coleman made the
fast time of 22 1-5 seconds in the 220
yard dash. P. B. McKee, '14, was a
close second in both races.
The longer races were shortened be
cause of the unfavorable conditions.
W. W. Rassett, '15, and G. Bevier, '11,
fought hard for first place in the two
mile, the former winning by a scant
margin. The runners covered the six
laps in 7:40.

of the sea.on in the timber topping

both races. ITb fastest, time was over
tlu< low sticks, which he cleared in 26
2-5 seconds.

petition, the men who are sure of
places on the team which will go
south are Coleman, McKee, Campbell,
Murray, Alderman, Woolley, Millsap,
Bonnett, Kern, Morrison, and Horine.
Dodge seems to be the most likely can
didate for the two miler on the squad.

representative i'i the quarter. Three
additional places are to he filled to
complete the sixteen members who are
to journey to Bovard Field next Satur
day.

i'dv acted as a hindrance to the Car
ilnal trackmen, several excellent per
formances were recorded on the Stan
ford oval Saturday morning. The re
sults of the competition gave "Dad"

ford against the University of Southern
California athletes. Several of the
Varsity men did not compete.
J. A. Miller, '13; raised his height in
the pole vault to an even twelve feet.

first in:10 1-5, and Coleman made the
fast time of 22 1-5 seconds in the 220
yard dash. P. B. McKee, '14, was a

petition, the men who are sure of
places on the team which will go
south are Coleman, McKee, Campbell,
Murray, Alderman, Woolley, Millsap,
Bonnett, Kern, Morrison, and Horine.

didate for the two miler on the squad.

to journey to Bovard Field next Satur
day.
