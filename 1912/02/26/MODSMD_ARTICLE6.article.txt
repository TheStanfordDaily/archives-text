# WOMEN IN THE SWIM WHILE STARS OF NIGHT GROW DIM.
## Crew Men, Not So Bold, Quaking With the Cold, Look on and Grin. 
### 
About the time Old Sol sent his first
; shuttering beams across the greasy
surface of Lagunita, and while cooks
and second-boys were rocking bliss
fully in the arms of Morpheus, three
husky crew candidates stood on the
boathouse float, thrashing their arms
to keep warm. It was yet an hour be
fore the earliest-rising bell. The
heavy sweaters were meagre protec
tion against the chill of the dawning
day.
Suddenly, one of the trio staggered,
and, clutching his companion by the
arm, mutely pointed toward the foun
tain far out on the lake.
Rubbing their sleep-ridden eyes, the
men made out a mermaid in a blue
bathing-suit splashing the water, and
a moment later located two others
' sporting in the frigid depths.
As the Toreei left the rocky pedestal
to cleave the glittering waters toward
the shore, it seemed to the crew men
that her lusty strokes cut through ice.
It is useless, henceforth, for a Stan
ford "co-ed" to refute the charge that
her ilk are cold-blooded Amazons. The
crew men will take the stand against
her. The female of the species is ner
vier than the male.
