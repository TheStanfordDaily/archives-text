# MYSTERIOUS MITCHELL SOLVED BY VARSITY
## PRESLEY'S PITCHER SHOWS THE WHITE FEATHER. Worst Game of the Season Won by the Varsity in Easy Style. 
### 
"Mysterious Mitchell," heading an
All Star cast ol < rror makers, pre
sented a nine-act comedy entitled
"Childsplay" on the Stanford diamond
last Saturday afternoon. "Mysterious"
played the leading role, that of the
child.
In the worst game of ball seen on
the Cardinal field this year, Stanford
won from Presley's "All Stars" 7 to 1.
Six inexcusable errors, coupled with
the deliberate quitting of their pitcher
in the fourth inning, was the cause
of the visitors' heavy defeat. In this
inning Walker became disgusted with
everything in general and began to
toss the game. Up to this period Stan
ford had gathered five hits and four
runs.
The scoring began in the first in
ning, when Gault walked and scored
on Obear's single to right, which the
fielder allowed to get away from him.
Then the next three men struck out,
but Obear scored when Presley drop
ped a. third strike. In the third inning,
Terry walked with one out and ad
vanced on Cass' hit to center. Gil
fillan then followed suit and scored
both men when the center fielder let
the ball speed past him.
Game Drags.
In the last half of this inning, Mc-
Govern walked but was out at second
when Presley reached first. Walker
was given a. pass to first and when do
Lisle struck-out Presley scored on
Dent's wild heave to first. This was
the end of the visitors' scoring
From this point on the game drag
ged, owing to the actions of "Mysteri
ous" and the general lack of interest
of all. Stanford scored four more
times on four hits coupled with help
ing errors.
Noble was the best batter of the day.
In four times up he got a single, a
double, and a three-bagger. Captain
Gilfillan was next in line with two
safe hits. Freshman Couch pitched
good, steady ball, allowing the visitors
but four hits and walking three, while
ten succumbed to strikes.
