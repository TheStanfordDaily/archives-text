To-morrow afternoon Memorial ser
vices will be held at the Mausoleum

in honor of the mem
ory of Jane Lathrop
Stanford. Seven years

ago it was, that the University was
startled by the news of the death of
Mrs. Stanford while on a trip to the
Orient. Known by every student of
the University and loved by all who
knew her, the loss of Mrs. Stanford
was taken as a personal bereavement
by the whole community.
The fortitude of Mrs. Stanford was
of an uncommon order and neither
lawsuits nor financial difficulties of
the most stringent nature affected her
confidence in the future of Leland
Stanford Junior University. Through
troubles enough to daunt the strong
est, she was true to the desire of her
husband to establish a university for
"the children of California."
We who are the beneficiaries of all
her devotion and self sacrifice can not,
it is true, adequately express our ap
preciation of the debt we owe Mrs.
Stanford, yet today we can as keenly
feel the pain caused by her untimely
loss as did the student of seven years
ago.
The Memorial services will begin
at 4:110 to-morrow afternoon and all
members of the University and friends
in the community are invited to atend.
