A new department of the Womea s

This department takes the form of a
women's debating society, which is to
meet weekly. Dr. Jordan has prom

The society will meet on Wednes

be held in room 202 on Wednesday
night. A constitution will be laid be
fore the members for adoption and an
election of officers will be held. The
main purpose of the organization is to
engage in debates on political ques
tions. There will be a short discus
sion at the first meeting.
