# MARCH SEQUOIA CONTAINS GOOD FICTION AND VERSE
## Student Control, Intercollegiate Athletics and Education Discussed. 
### 
Three articles of unusual value are
included in the February number of
the Sequoia which will appear early
next week. L. L. Hill, '11, writes on
Student. Control, giving a forceful and
logical presentation of this much dis
cussed question. J. D. Houser, '10, is
the author of an article on the Univer
sity and Secondary Education, in
which he discusses the part the
university should take in the matter of
secondary schools and the relation
between the two departments of edu
cation. The abolition of intercollegi
ate athletics is advocated by S. C.
Peck, '12, in an article in which he
states detailed and clear reasons for
his stand in the matter.
Fiction is contributed by J. W. How
ell, '12, who has a story of the desert,
"The Whistler and the Rattler." As
a bit of artistic work this story should
hold high rank in recent Sequoia fic
tion, and compares favorably with
work in other magazines. F. H. Reach
contributes a story entitled "A Tooth
for a Tooth," which possesses quali
ties of great interest.
A blank verse poem, "The Rich
Young Man," by C. B. Hammond, '12,
is the pretentious contribution to the
department of verse. Other contri
butors are E. J. Hopkins, ex-'ll, whose
poem is entitled "Dream Dances,"
Miss A. Gray, '15, who writes on the
Briar Rose, and Miss M. Driscoll, '13,
who contributes verses entitled "Shad
ows."
A new feature of the magazine is
a department in which is offered an
imaginary conversation between a
Browser and a student on the subject
of "The Admirable Crichton." The ar
ticle is the work of G. C. Ingelow, '13.
Editor Robinson deals with matters
of recent interest in his editorial.
