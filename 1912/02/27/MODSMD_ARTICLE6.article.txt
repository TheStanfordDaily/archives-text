# UNIVERSAL PEACE IS FOSTERED BY ATHLETICS
## THIRTY NATIONS TO COMPETE IN OLYMPIC GAMES. Augustus Kirby Declares Stanford Will be Represented on United States Team. 
### 
"Universal peace will be brought
about by athletics between nations
more readily than any number of ar
bitration treaties," declared Gustavus
Kirby, president of the Amateur Ath
letic Union of America, in an informal
talk to the men of the University of
the University at Encina clubroom last
evening.
"Thirty nations are to be represent
ed at the great contests in Sweden
next July and the team which departs
from New York harbor will carry the
flag of the United States, the flag of
the 1915 Panama Pacific Exposition
and the flag of peace.
"To win if we can by sportsmanship
is to be our aim," said Kirby. "The
making of a few champions is the
wrong idea. Competition is but a
means to an end.' Athletics make bet
ter citizens of us. They make every
one bigger and stronger. You have the
right idea in the West, that of getting
as many men as possible into athletics.
Rubbing elbows on the athletic field
is worth while."
"Honesty is better than amateurism.
But amateurism is to be encouraged.
However, professionalism is different
now than years ago."
In speaking of the Olympian games
the distinguished athletic leader de
clared that Stanford would have at
least one member on the team which
journeys to Stockholm next summer.
Athletes of the West will undoubtedly
be well represented in the world com
petition, which should result in
another clean cut victory for the Uni
ted States, he said.
