# STANFORD AND ST. MARY'S PLAY TOMORROW AT 4.
## Third Game Between the Two College Teams Will Decide the Odd Victory. 
### 
For the third time this season Stan
ford and St. Mary's will oppose each
other to-morrow afternoon at 4 o'clock.
In the previous games each team is
credited with one victory, so that this
third game will be of special import
ance in determining the winner in the
six game series.
On Saturday, California defeated St.
Mary's in a close game, although the
Catholic College players were without
three of their best men. The following
day, the Olympic Club team was de
feated by the Oaklanders.
Southpaw Cann, St. Mary's best
pitcher, together with Simpson, her
first catcher, will compose the oppos
ing battery to-morrow. Captain Fitz
simmons, accepted as one of the best
college infielders in the West, will
play short.
The Stanford line-up will remain the
same as on last Saturday. Either
Couch or Howe will pitch, according
to the way they work out previous to
the game, while Dent will start the
game as catcher. A hard practice was
indulged in last evening in anticipa
tion of today's rest and to-morrow's
game.
The line-ups will he:
Stanford—Gault, left; Obear, first;
Cass, second; Gilfillan, third; Terry,
short; Beeger, right; Noble, center;
Dent, catcher; Couch, Howe, pitcher.
St. Mary's—Pappa, left; Giugni, sec
ond; Wallace, third; Remmer, center;
Leggett, first; Togni, right; Simpson,
catcher; Cann, pitcher; Fitzsimmons,
short.
