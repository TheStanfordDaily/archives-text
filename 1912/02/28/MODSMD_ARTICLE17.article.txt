The try-outs for the Varsity tennis

H. S. Morgan, '12, defeated R. L. Mur
ray, '13, in the first try-out, and the
second has narrowed down to a con
test among Murray, F. S. Pratt, '13,
and W. Hutchinson, 'lfj.
The matches yet to be played are
G. L. Shaul, *13, vs. the winner of tht
Murray-Hutchinson set; T. J. Blethen,
13, vs. H. L. Hubbard, '12: Pratt vs.
C. P. Sonntag, '15; and C. S. Grace, '12,
vs. V. L. Sheldon, '15.
The California team has suggested
the week before the intercollegiate
track meet for the tournament, but as
this conflicts with the interscholastlc
tennis and track meet, it is not ap
proved.
The first Saturday in April has been
suggested by the Stanford players for
the tournament and it is hoped that
this day will prove satisfactory to the
California racquet-wielders.
Charles Rodgers, of the California
team, has recovered from an injury
received early in the season and is
able to be on the courts again.
