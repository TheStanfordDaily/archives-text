# LL.B. DEGREE IS TO BE GIVEN IN LAW
## TWO YEARS' CULTURE AND THREE YEARS' PROFESSIONAL WORK IS REQUIRED IN NEW COURSE. 
### 
Upon recommendation of the Law
Faculty and the Academic Council, the
Hoard of Trustees at its recent meet
ing passed a resolution in pursuance
of which the degree of Bachelor of
Laws will hereafter be granted at
Stanford upon the completion of two
years of general culture and three
years of professional law study. The
present degree of Juris Doctor will
be retained with the curriculum lead
ing to it practically unaltered. With
the offering of this new degree another
important change of ruling will be
made by the Law Faculty. This is
the requirement of an age of twenv>-
three instead of twenty-one years for
entrance as a special law student.
Three Degrees Available.
All students intending to study law
will register in the Pre-legal depart
ment and take the regular first two
years' work of that curriculum. At
the end of this period they will have
had the course in Introduction to the
Study of Law and will be in a position
to decide whether they wish to strive
for the A. B. and J. D. degrees or for
that of LL. B. If the student elects
the former, he will in all probability
take Contracts and culture work in
his third year, with straight profes
sional work in his fourth, graduating
as a Bachelor of Arts. In two more
years of professional law he will win
his J. D. If he selects the LL. b.
course, however, he will take three
of solid professional work. He will,
in this course, not win the A. B. degree
as in the other. It will, moreover, be
impossible for him when he has once
entered upon this course to change to
that leading to J. D.
Alterations Kills Want.
This alteration in the law curri
culum was recommended by the de
partment faculty to nil a definite want.
There are at present three classes of
law students. First, those who do not
intend to practice law, but study it
as a preparation for other careers,

particularly business. Second, those
who intend to be lawyers and wish the
best possible preparation for their
profession, practically regardless of
time. Third, those who intend to prac
tice but cannot devote six years to
University study.
Problem in Present Division.
For the first two classes the present
course serves admirably. The third
division, however, presents a problem.
In the past such students have either
entered as specials, in which case they
took no non-professional work, or have
graduated with the A. B. degree and
passed the bar examinations with only
one year of actual law study. In the
belief that many of these men could
remain five years, and would gladly do
so in order to gain two years of gen
eral and three years of professional
work, the new course is offered.
In other universities there is no
uniform requirement for non-profes
sional work on the part of the law
student. Some require one year, some
two years, while a few on the Atlantic
coast demand thrtee years of sucrt
study. It is thus evident that Stan
ford has been among the most rigid
in requirements in this regard. The
Law faculty places great emphasis on
the value of the non-professional work,
and believes that the new course will
be elected only by those who are ab
solutely prevented from taking the
full six years.
Age Requirement liaised.
The rule fixing the age limit of spec
ial law students at twenty-three years
comes because of a belief that a man
of twenty-one is too immature to be
graduated in three years with no gen
eral culture work. The needs of most
of those who now enter as specials will
be met by the new course, while the
remainder can afford to wait until they
are twenty-three.
The rulings as to the new course and
the age of special students will go
into effect next year.

There are at present three classes of
law students. First, those who do not
intend to practice law, but study it
as a preparation for other careers,

particularly business. Second, those
who intend to be lawyers and wish the
best possible preparation for their
profession, practically regardless of
time. Third, those who intend to prac
tice but cannot devote six years to
University study.
Problem in Present Division.
For the first two classes the present
course serves admirably. The third
division, however, presents a problem.
In the past such students have either
entered as specials, in which case they
took no non-professional work, or have
graduated with the A. B. degree and
passed the bar examinations with only
one year of actual law study. In the
belief that many of these men could
remain five years, and would gladly do
so in order to gain two years of gen
eral and three years of professional
work, the new course is offered.
In other universities there is no
uniform requirement for non-profes
sional work on the part of the law
student. Some require one year, some
two years, while a few on the Atlantic
coast demand thrtee years of sucrt
study. It is thus evident that Stan
ford has been among the most rigid
in requirements in this regard. The
Law faculty places great emphasis on
the value of the non-professional work,
and believes that the new course will
be elected only by those who are ab
solutely prevented from taking the
full six years.
Age Requirement liaised.
The rule fixing the age limit of spec
ial law students at twenty-three years
comes because of a belief that a man
of twenty-one is too immature to be
graduated in three years with no gen
eral culture work. The needs of most
of those who now enter as specials will
be met by the new course, while the
remainder can afford to wait until they
are twenty-three.
The rulings as to the new course and
the age of special students will go
into effect next year.
Upon recommendation of the Law
Faculty and the Academic Council, the
Hoard of Trustees at its recent meet
ing passed a resolution in pursuance
of which the degree of Bachelor of
Laws will hereafter be granted at
Stanford upon the completion of two
years of general culture and three
years of professional law study. The
present degree of Juris Doctor will
be retained with the curriculum lead
ing to it practically unaltered. With
the offering of this new degree another
important change of ruling will be
made by the Law Faculty. This is
the requirement of an age of twenv>-
three instead of twenty-one years for
entrance as a special law student.
Three Degrees Available.
All students intending to study law
will register in the Pre-legal depart
ment and take the regular first two
years' work of that curriculum. At
the end of this period they will have
had the course in Introduction to the
Study of Law and will be in a position
to decide whether they wish to strive
for the A. B. and J. D. degrees or for
that of LL. B. If the student elects
the former, he will in all probability
take Contracts and culture work in
his third year, with straight profes
sional work in his fourth, graduating
as a Bachelor of Arts. In two more
years of professional law he will win
his J. D. If he selects the LL. b.
course, however, he will take three
of solid professional work. He will,
in this course, not win the A. B. degree
as in the other. It will, moreover, be
impossible for him when he has once
entered upon this course to change to
that leading to J. D.
