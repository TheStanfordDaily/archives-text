# SOCIALIST SUPPLICATION SEMBLES SEISMIC SEANCE.
## Economics Department Trembles Under Potential Possibilities of Political Agitation. 
### 
The foundations of the Economics
department this morning repeated the
oscillations of the memorable day of
1906, although they withstood the
temblor as valiantly as before. The
agitation was most noticeable in the
sanctum sanctorum of the professors
in the upper floor of the department.
The origin of the seismic cataclysm
has been traced to a poster of san
guinary hue placed near the voting
booth for the presidential straw ballot.
It wasn't the terrifying color effect
of the bulletin (hat created the eruption,
although paper of less inflammatory
decoration hag been known to start
tong wars and revolutions, it was the
predigested tabloid that the wording
of the poster offered for the mental
maws of the student body that aroused

the ire of those whose prerogative it
is to edify.
"Vote for Measures, Not Men! Kor
get the Subsidized Political Economy
crammed into you here. Tf you're not
the son of a millionaire clock manu
facturer. you will he behind the times
unless you VOTE FOR DEBS! .Tust
because you are a college student,
don't imagine that the prostitution of
your mental faculties will put you in
line for .T. Pierpont's Job. Vote with
your class."
There you have it!
A member of the department face
tiously remarked "its funny they don't
class Debs as a man."
