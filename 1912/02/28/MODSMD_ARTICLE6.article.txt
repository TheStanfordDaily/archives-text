U. S. C. Always Surprises.
Stanford will be represented by a
small but formidable team, and the
only hopes of the southerners lies in
the number of second and third point
men which the Los Angeles institu
tion will be able to send on the track.
The U. S. C. athletes nave made but
few good records thus far this sea
son, but the meet with the Cardinal
always results in excelent perrorm
ances.
Cardinal Distance Men Best.
In the mile, Torrance was only able
to take second last week in 4:45 1-5.
Murray and Fletcher are both able to
do better than 4:40 flat, and should
have little trouble with the southern
ers.
The U. S. C. half-milers, Smith and
Woods, have done close to 2:04 in the
early meets this season, and may bet
ter this time against Bonnett. The
Cardinal freshman has made a mark
almost a second better than the record
of the southerners and must be con
cedcd an excellent chance of pressing
his opponents very close for first place.
Dodge has completed the long two
mile grind in twenty-four seconds
