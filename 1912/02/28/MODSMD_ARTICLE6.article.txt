# FIFTEEN MEN SELECTED TO MAKE SOUTHERN TRIP
## SMALL BUT FORMIDABLE TEAM REPRESENTS STANFORD. Graduate Manager and Trainer Accompany team.â€”Comparison of Early Records Made. 
### 
Fifteen trackmen, accompanied by
Graduate Manager D. W. Burbank, '09.
and "Dad" Moulton, are prepared to
leave the Stanford campus to-morrow
evening on the annual pilgrimage to
the southland, where the athletes or
the University of Southern California
will be encountered on Bovard Field,
Los Angeles.
The following men were picked to
represent Stanford. Captain T. L.
Coleman, '12, E. P. Campbell, '13, P. B.
McKee, '14, E. F. Kern, *13, R. L.
Murray, '13, E. M. Bonnett, '15, W. J.
Dodge, '13, F. L. Gard, '14, W. R. Fin
ney, '12, G. L. Horine, '13, J. A. Miller,
'13, H. Morrison, '13, M. N. Alderman,
'12, C. C. Taylor, '11, and R. E. Mill
sap, '12. The men are requested to
report at 7:15 to-morrow evening.
U. S. C. Always Surprises.
Stanford will be represented by a
small but formidable team, and the
only hopes of the southerners lies in
the number of second and third point
men which the Los Angeles institu
tion will be able to send on the track.
The U. S. C. athletes nave made but
few good records thus far this sea
son, but the meet with the Cardinal
always results in excelent perrorm
ances.
Cardinal Distance Men Best.
In the mile, Torrance was only able
to take second last week in 4:45 1-5.
Murray and Fletcher are both able to
do better than 4:40 flat, and should
have little trouble with the southern
ers.
The U. S. C. half-milers, Smith and
Woods, have done close to 2:04 in the
early meets this season, and may bet
ter this time against Bonnett. The
Cardinal freshman has made a mark
almost a second better than the record
of the southerners and must be con
cedcd an excellent chance of pressing
his opponents very close for first place.
Dodge has completed the long two
mile grind in twenty-four seconds
faster time than the mark made by
Torrance in the meet against Occi
dental.
Millsa]) and Taylor should have little
difficulty annexing the first two places
in the 440 yard dash. Both runners
have been pushing close to the fifty
two second mark. This is about a
second faster than any of the U. S. C.
quarter milers have been doing.
Hodge appears to be the best of the
southerners.
Tliroop and his broad jump finish
will find difficulty in breaking into
point winners of the sprints with sucli
a trio as Coleman, Campbell, and Mc-
Kee representing Stanford. However,
the U. S. C. man must be conceded an
excellent chance with his records of
:10 1-5 in the century and:22 1-5 in
the furlong.
Campbell and Kern will find Kelly,
late of Orange, the former inter
scholastic phenomen, as their fastest
rival in the timber-topping events. He
figures best in the shorter and hiLthei
hurdles, where his time is :It> 2-5.
Field Events sire Stanford's.
Stanford should increase the total
number of her points very materially
in the field events. The southerners
have made few marks which compart
favorably with those of the Cardinal
weight men, jumpers and vaulters.
Because of a pressure of college
work, J. E. Woolley, '12, is unable to
make the trip. This leaves Alderman
with the task of scoring the points
for Stanford in the weights. Tn the
hammer throw, Durkee was unable to
do better than 115 reet last week,
and Kelly won the shot putin the dual
competition with Occidental on a toss
of 38 feet, 7 Inches.
Horine and Finney should keep
Chaffee from gaining more than a third
place, with their leaps above the six
foot mark. Tf Miller continues his
altitude-climbing, the invading Car
dinals have little to fear from the
IT. S. C. vaulters, Watkins, Maurer, or
Cookman. who are clearing the bar
around 10 feet, 0 inches.
Earl and Freeman are the best of
the southern broad jumpers. Earl
should give Morrison a fairly good
work out. .
