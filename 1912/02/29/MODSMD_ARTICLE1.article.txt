# CREWS FAST ROUNDING INTO EXCELLENT FORM
## FRESHMEN AND VARSITY BOATS TRAIN AT REDWOOD. Coaching Launch is Used Tuesday For First Time.â€”Results Are Satisfactory. 
### 
Candidates for positions on the Var
sity and Freshmen crews are in the
midst of their season of active train
ing. From now on the regular grind
of daily work will take one or both of
the crews to Redwood. This of it
self is an innovation in training.
Never before have Varsity and Fresh
men crews taken to the water at Red
wood so early in the season. This is
due, in the case of the Freshmen, in no
small degree to the fall training which
the candidates went through. The
work which was done at that time
made it possible for the new men to be
placed in the shells at least two weeks
earlier than they have been in the
past.
Freshmen in Good Condition.
The Freshmen who are trying for
places in the first year boat, are al
ready showing excellent form for this
early in the season. According to
Crew Captain R. H. Seward, '12, the
form is very good but the pull, which
the men are getting into their stroke
is still weak, due to their lack of ex
perience and the necessity of their
paying particular attention to form to
the exclusion of power. With addition
al experience the form will become so
natural that most of the attention can
then be given to putting the most into
each stroke.
Competition in the Varsity boat is
especially severe this year. Although
the number of available candidates for
the four vacant places in the Varsity
boat is small, they are all such good
oarsmen that the sparsity of numbers
is, if anything, an advantage. Be
cause of this fact, all of the available
candidates are being tried out in a
more than usually thorough manner
and they are each fast rounding into
goood form, in both oarsmanship and
training.
Strict Training on Monday.
Monday morning, the men who are
still on both Varsity and Freshmen
squads will go into strict training.
Smoking has been an unknown luxury
among the crew men since the begin
ning of the season, but there have been
no rules in regard to the hours of re
tiring. After Monday night eleven
o'clock rules must be observed by all
men.
Another innovation which has been
introduced this year is that of a coach
ing launch. This has been a long felt
want in the work at Redwood. On
Tuesday, a launch was used by Captain
Seward to follow the crew. Owing to
the high speed attained by the shell,
it was found impossible to keep up
with it for long, but by sending the
shell down the course and then follow
ing it up after it passed the moving
launch, the men could be directed
within speaking distance for about
half a mile. It is though that the use
of this boat even for such short por
tions of the course as this will materi
ally assist in turning out a winning
crew. This system has been success
ful in many other universities.

is still weak, due to their lack of ex
perience and the necessity of their
paying particular attention to form to
the exclusion of power. With addition
al experience the form will become so
natural that most of the attention can
then be given to putting the most into
each stroke.
Competition in the Varsity boat is
especially severe this year. Although
the number of available candidates for
the four vacant places in the Varsity
boat is small, they are all such good
oarsmen that the sparsity of numbers
is, if anything, an advantage. Be
cause of this fact, all of the available
candidates are being tried out in a
more than usually thorough manner
and they are each fast rounding into
goood form, in both oarsmanship and
training.
Strict Training on Monday.
Monday morning, the men who are
still on both Varsity and Freshmen
squads will go into strict training.
Smoking has been an unknown luxury
among the crew men since the begin
ning of the season, but there have been
no rules in regard to the hours of re
tiring. After Monday night eleven
o'clock rules must be observed by all
men.
Another innovation which has been
introduced this year is that of a coach
ing launch. This has been a long felt
want in the work at Redwood. On
Tuesday, a launch was used by Captain
Seward to follow the crew. Owing to
the high speed attained by the shell,
it was found impossible to keep up
with it for long, but by sending the
shell down the course and then follow
ing it up after it passed the moving
launch, the men could be directed
within speaking distance for about
half a mile. It is though that the use
of this boat even for such short por
tions of the course as this will materi
ally assist in turning out a winning
crew. This system has been success
ful in many other universities.
Candidates for positions on the Var
sity and Freshmen crews are in the
midst of their season of active train
ing. From now on the regular grind
of daily work will take one or both of
the crews to Redwood. This of it
self is an innovation in training.
Never before have Varsity and Fresh
men crews taken to the water at Red
wood so early in the season. This is
due, in the case of the Freshmen, in no
small degree to the fall training which
the candidates went through. The
work which was done at that time
made it possible for the new men to be
placed in the shells at least two weeks
earlier than they have been in the
past.
Freshmen in Good Condition.
The Freshmen who are trying for
places in the first year boat, are al
ready showing excellent form for this
early in the season. According to
Crew Captain R. H. Seward, '12, the
form is very good but the pull, which
the men are getting into their stroke
is still weak, due to their lack of ex
perience and the necessity of their
paying particular attention to form to
the exclusion of power. With addition
al experience the form will become so
natural that most of the attention can
then be given to putting the most into
each stroke.
