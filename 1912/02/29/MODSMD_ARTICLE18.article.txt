# JUNIOR CLASS TO LEVY TAX FOR COMING YEAR.
## New System Devised to Defray Large Expenses of Senior Activities. 
### 
In order to defray the large expenses
which accumulate during the Senior
year and in some degree prepare to
meet them, the Junior class at their
meeting today decided to levy an
assessment of fifty cents on each mem
ber of the class. This is an innovation
in class finance. It is expected by
those who conceived the idea that it
will aid materially in the Senior year.
The treasury, according to the report
of T. L. Dunham, retiring secretary,
is in good condition, and the assess
ment will not be needed to carry any
of the expenses of the current sem
ester

purchase books and filing devices for
keeping track of all documents and
expenses.

acceptance, President CI. D. Worswick
