# MEMORY OF MRS. STANFORD FRESHENED IN MANY MINDS.
## Faculty and Students Combine to Do Honor to University's Great Mother. 
### 
Attended by a gratifyingly large
number of students and faculty mem
bers, services in honor of Mrs. .Jane
Lathrop Stanford were held yesterday.
The observance marked the eighth an
niversary of the University's founder.
The exercises were held at the Mauso
leum, where the remains now rest.
The principal tribute of the day to
the memory of Mrs. Stanford was a
poem from the pen of Chaplain EV
Charles Gardner, entitled, "In Memor
iam: Jane Lathrop Stanford." For
seven years Dr. Gardner has told the
history of Mrs. Stanford and the
founding of the University, at these
memorial services, but yesterday he
chose to honor her in a new manner.
His paper eulogized Mrs. Stanford and
declared that Stanford graduates, hav
ing received her bounty, could not be
other than upright, fair dealing men
and women.
The program was as follows:
Hymn, "Nearer, My God to Thee."
Prayer of Thanks to Mrs. Stanford.
Anthem, "Crossing the Bar."
Address, Rev. D. Charles Gardner.
Prayer for the University.
"Hail, Stanford, Hail."
Benediction.
At its conclusion the large gathering
stood bareheaded around the Stanford
tomb and sang "Hail, Stanford, Hail."
