# STANFORD TRACKMEN ARE SPEEDING TO SOUTHLAND
## CARDINAL HAS ADVANTAGE OVER U. S. C. Several Events Promise Close Finishes â€”Comparison of Last Season's Records Made. 
### 
Representatives of the Cardinal are
speeding to Los Angeles to-night on
their annual invasion of the southland
to meet the University of Southern
California trackmen. The fifteen
Stanford athletes, accompanied by
Manager Burbank and "Dad" Moulton,
left early this evening for San Jose in
order to catch the Lark from that
point.
To-morrow afternoon the men will
indulge in a light workout on the Bo
vard field track, so as to be accustomed
to the curves. The sprinters will es
pecially need to be familiar with the
turns, as the furlong dash and hurdles
are not run on a straight-away as is
the case here.
The U. S. C. team was the winner
of the southern championship, and with
Throop, Cookman, and Hansen in the
sprints, Hodge in the quarter, Tor
rance, Swiggeft, Smith, Woods and
Tipton in the longer races; Kelly in
the hurdles and Trotter and Clement
in the weights, the southerners are
liable to give the varsity squad plenty
of work.
From the reports received from the
south, the interest in the meet will
bring out a record crowd. The Los
Angeles track devotees are especially
anxious to see the rival captains, Cole
man and Throop, compete in the
sprints.
Throop, captain and star of the
IT. S. C. squad, is being backed to beat
Coleman in the sprints. The Cardinal
leader has always taken the measure
of his southern rival and should again
defeat the pride of the Los Angeles
institution.
Last season Smith of U. S. C. took
first place in the southern meet in
4:39 1-5. Murray should take the
five points for breasting the tape first
with his mark of 4:36-3. Smith and
Woods are apt to give Freshman Bon
nett trouble in the 880 yard dash. The
U. S. C. half milers annexed six points
in this event in the 1911 aggregation.
I T . S. ('. Has Strong Two Miler.
Swiggett, a recent arrival from
Phoenix high school, Arizona, is
credited with doing 10:10 in the two
mile, lie was the star in last Thurs
day's A. A. U. meet at Los Angeles
and is looked upon as a coming star in
the long race. Dodge should have
plenty of work cut out for him in this
race, bui on his past work he is expect
ed to better the best of his past times.
The timber-topping competition re
sulted in an equal division of points
last year with times of :16 2-5 in the
high hurdles and:27 1-5 in the longer
race.
Taylor and Millsap divided honors in
the 440 yard dash in the 1911 meet and
should disprove the come-back theory
and again take the first two places.
One hundred and thirty-two feet,
four inches was the distance of the
heave that won the hammer throw
for Wool ley last season against the
southerners. Alderman appears to
have the claim on first place. Trotter
of U. S. C. made the best toss in the
shot put last year, his distance being 41
put last year, his distance being 41
feet, 10 inches.
The high and broad jumps were both
won by the Cardinal athletes on Bo
vard field in the last meet. Horine
leaped over six feet in his event and
21 feet, 6 inches was the best mark,
made by Bellah, in the broad jump.
Stanford tradition was upheld by
Bellah's winning climb of 11 feet, 10
inches.
