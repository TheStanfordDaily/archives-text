# TIMOTHY HOPKINS GIVES RUGBY FOOTBALL TROPHY.
## President of the Board of Trustees Furthers University Athletics by Cup for Inter-club Play. 
### 
With a desire to further the cause
of athletics within the University, Mr.
Timothy J. Hopkins, President of the
Board of Trustees, has presented to
the Student Body a beautiful loving
cup as a Rugby football trophy. The
first play for the cup will be during
the next semester, when an inter-fra
ternity series will probably decide the
temporary holder of the prize. The
gift was made through the Executive
Committee, which is empowered to ar
range all details of the competition.
The trophy, a sterling silver loving
cup of very beautiful design, is the
work of the firm of Shreve and Com
pany, San Francisco. Selected as the
most graceful and appropriate of the
twelve designs submitted, it stands
over twenty-four inches above the
heavy silver base. The only orna
mentation is the heavy chasing of the
handles. On one side, engraved at the
earnest solicitation of the Executive
Committee, is this inscription, "College
Cup for Rugby Football, presented by
Timothy Hopkins, President of the
Board of Trustees, to further athletic
sports within the University."
It had been Mr. Hopkins' intention
to give a punting trophy for individual
competition but it was decided that an
inter-club series would arouse a more
general interest. The cup is to be a
perpetual challenge trophy, and as
such the makers have designed one
side for the engraving of- the names of
the winning teams.
