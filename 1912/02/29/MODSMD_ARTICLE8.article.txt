# DEBATERS CHOSEN FOR TRI-STATE CONTESTS.
## E.E. Tincher, '12, K.L. Leib, '13, C.C. Close, '14, and A. E. Worthy, '15, Win Try-outs. 
### 
In a keenly contested try-out held
in the University Chapel last night,
C. C. Close, '14, K. E. Leib, '13, E. E.
Tincher, '12, and A. E. Worthy, '15,
were picked as the most finished de
baters to represent Stanford in the
Tri-State League on March 29. The
judges, Professor H. W. Stuart of
the Philosophy Department, Profes
sor C. S. Allen of the Department of
Romanic Languages, and I. B. Cross,
Instructor in Economics, assigned
Close and Leib to the team which
should travel north to meet the Uni
versity of Oregon's debaters, with
R. W. Stewart, '15, as alternate. Tin
cher and Worthy, with A. F. Coyle, '15,
alternate, constitute the home team to
debate against the team from the Uni
versity of Washington. Debaters from
the northern schools will meet at
Washington and the university obtain
ing the decision in both places will
have won the series.
Last year Stanford was defeated in
both instances, but the fact that
the question, "Resolved, That judges
should be subject to the recall, con
stitutionality granted," has been used
in the last intercollegiate and inter
class contests should weight heavily in
our favor.
C. C. Close and K. E. Leib are mem
bers of Euphronia Debating Society,
and have already represented Stanford
iu forensic contest, Leib being a Car
not debater and Close alternate on the
last intercollegiate team.
This is A. E. Worthy's first experi
ence at intercollegiate debating, while
his team-mate, Tincher, has been twice
a member of a Carnot contest, a var
sity debater, and winner of the Ber
wick and Mills Peace prizes, last sem
ester. Both are members of Nestoria
Literary Society.
