money as well as his time in an
attempt to awaken the social con
science of the American people.

ridding the 17th ward of its bosses and
for seven years he has seen that clean
men are sent to the council. He is a
member of the Chicago Hoard of Edu
cation, and lives in the vicinity of the
Chicago Commons, where he devotes
