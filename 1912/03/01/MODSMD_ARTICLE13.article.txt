# Advertising.
## 
### 
Recently there has been a reversion
to the old habit of advertising every

thing from English Club
plays to Y. M. C. A.
revival meetings, by

means of posters placed in the windows
of the Quad.
Some time ago, at the suggestion of
the Executive Committee, the Business
Office erected signboards at various
points of vantage on the campus for
the very purpose of eliminating the
need of this method of publicity. Cer
tainly the Secretary of the Young
Men's Christian Association and the
Advertising man of the Sophomore
play, the most recent offenders, should
be conversant with these facts.
