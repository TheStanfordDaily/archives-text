# WALLS OF MEMORIAL CHURCH TAKE SHAPE.
## Reconstruction Progresses Rapidly. Electricity Increases Working Efficiency. 
### 
During the past weeks of fair
weather, the reconstruction of the
Memorial Church has proceeded very
rapidly, with an increased number of
men at work. The stone walls have
reached a height of 8 to 10 feet on all
sides, and are being filled with the
concrete that is to form the support
ing material of the structure.
Work on the walls is greatly facili
tated by the erection of heavy derricks
above the nave, and the installation
of an electric motor to swing the heavy
blocks into place. A concrete mixer,
operated by the motor, is set in the
basement. Tinsmiths have been at
work for the past week on the flues of
the ventilating system to be installed.
This is to be of modern design and un
usual efficiency.
