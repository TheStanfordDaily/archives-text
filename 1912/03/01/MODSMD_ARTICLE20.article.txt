# CHRISTOPHER, JR. CAST TO SELECT COSTUMES.
## Drilling of Sophomore Thespians by Coach Mathieu Has Advanced Rapidly. 
### 
Preparations for "Christopher, Jr.,"
the 1914 Sophomore comedy, have pro
gressed so far that costuming is now
an important matter engaging the
attention of Coach F. L. Mathieu,
While spectacular garb will not be
seen in this play it requires correct
and varied costuming. Three of the
acts will probably see complete
changes on the part of the entire cast.
A portion of the wardrobe will be
selected to-mororw by Coach Mathieu
in company with some of the men of
the cast. Several San Francisco cos
tumiers will be visited, after the con
clusion of the regular Saturday re
nearsal, which lasts until three o'clock.
