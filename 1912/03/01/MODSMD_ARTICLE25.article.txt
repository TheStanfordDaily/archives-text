With the Williamson trophy safely
in the possession of the Stanford soc

cessfully completed the present foot
ball season. However, there is a pos
sibility of additional contests during
the semester. Coach Maloney has re
ceived a letter from one of the British
ers on the English gunboat Algerine
in regards to a return game here later
in the spring. The tars were defeated
by the Cardinal players on their visit
to the campus and desire an oppor
tunity to redeem themselves.
