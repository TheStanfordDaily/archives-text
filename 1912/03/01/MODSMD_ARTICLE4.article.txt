## WILL GIVE COURSE IN SANSKRIT 
### 
Har Dayal, the Hindu student, has
been appointed by the board of trus
tees as lecturer on Indian Philosophy
at Stanford University, and he will
meet with his classes next week. The
courses will be in the regular curri
culum and credit for graduation will
be given for this semester's work.
A course in Sanskrit is to be given
by Dayal and he is also to give des
criptive and historical lectures on
the Philosophies of India. All inter
ested in taking either of the courses
are requested to meet in room 4(io on
Tuesday, March 5, at 2:30 p.m. Mr.
Dayal will be present to meet the stu
dents. It has not yet been decided
whether they will be two or three hour
courses.
First Hindu Professor in IT.l T . S.
The engagament by the trustees of
Mr. Dayal is an innovation in Ameri
can college circles, as no other Hindu
lecturer is known to be engaged in
the institutions of the United States.
The students who take the new courses
will doubtless receive much benefit by
receiving their knowledge of the sub
ject practically first hand.
Har Dayal is a graduate of the Pun
jab University, Delhi, the largest edu

cational institution in India. He is
also an alumni of Oxford, having taken
his M. A. degree there. Upon the con
ferring of the degree by the British
university, Dayal accepted a fellowship
in Sanskrit. He had earned the fellow
ship during his days of graduate study
but did not accept it until he com
pleted his work
Lectured Here Recently.
Dayal has been heard by Stanford
people recently, he having spoken
several times to appreciative audiences
in the Chapel on the "Schools and
Problems of Indian Philosophy."
Dayal is possessed of considerable
means and will not accept any remu
neration for his work here. He will
be, however, a regular lecturer, his
position being similar to that held by
Luther Burbank, the plant wizard, who
is a lecturer in the Department of
Botany.
The past year has been spent by
Dayal in the United States. He was
a resident at Cambridge, Mass., and
studied there, although not enrolled
!as a student at Harvard. He is at
. present a resident of San Francisco
| but will make his future home in Palo
| Alto.
