# "ALL STARS" WILL MAKE SECOND APPEARANCE.
## Presley to Bring a Stronger Team Than the One of Last Saturday. 
### 
Presley's "All Stars" will make their
second appearance against Stanford
to-morrow afternoon at 3 o'clock.
Last week's game between these
teams resulted in an easy victory for
the Varsity, and, as a result, Presley
can be depended upon to select a
stronger nine than he had with him a
week ago. It is probable that only a
few of the men who played with the
"All Stars" last Saturday will appear
again to-morrow. It is certain that
"Mysterious Mitchell" will not be in
cluded in the line up.
The Stanford team will remain prac
tically the same as a week ago, al
though two separate batteries are to
be used to-morrow. Howe and Sco
fleld start the game and will be follow
ed by Knderle and Henshaw. Gault
and Childs will alternate in the left
field while Heeger and Halm will do
the same in right.
Stanford will line-up as follows —
Gault, Childs, left; Obear, first; Terry,
short: Cass, second; Giifillan, third;
Heeger. Halm, right; Noble, center;
