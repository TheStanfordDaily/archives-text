crew men is to report for light setting
up exercises and a short cross
country run. Captain R. H. Seward
is to be in charge of the training.
Heretofore but a few oarsmen have
reported each morning for a work-out
on the lake. This part of the train
ing is to be continued and the rest of
the men will take the lighter form of
exercise.

Junior Prom, Stanford oarsmen will
not be allowed to attend any more
dances until after the crew season is
