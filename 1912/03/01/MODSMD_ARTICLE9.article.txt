Telegraphic advice from Bovard
field brings the information that the
Stanford representatives arrived in
excellent spirits and that the men are
resting to-night after a light workout
this afternoon. Captain Coleman will
probably enter the 220 yard dash but
is not to compete in the shorter sprint.
None of the athletes were in any way
affected by the trip.
