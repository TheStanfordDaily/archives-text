# BUT ONE RUN ALLOWED TO PRESLEY'S "STARS"
## VARSITY DEFEATS "ALL STARS" BY 2 TO 1 SCORE. Presley's Triple is Only Hit Visitors Obtain.â€”Cardinal Players in Good Form. 
### 
Pitcher Howe, effectively backed by
the Cardinal fielding, twirled a one

a score of 2 to 1. George Presley was
the only visitor to glean a hit off the
freshman's delivery. He obtained a
lucky triple in the eighth, which scored
the only run the "Stars" made.
Freeman, who pitched for Yale
against Princeton last spring, was on
the mound for the city nine. He
showed that he understood the pitch

ford's heavy stickers to five hits. He
had good control and an effective fast
ball.

and for the most part they were
changes for the better. The infield
played well together, accepting many
difficult chances with only one error.
Fielders Work Well.
The Stanford fielders played up to
their usual good form. Terry accepted
seven chances, and the two errors
marked up against him were excuse

and at bat. He handled five chances
faultessly and obtained two hits out
of three times up. Beeger also landed
on the spheroid for two hits, one a
two-bagger.
Stanford did all its scoring in the
second. Cass singled over second.
Gilfillan, trying to sacrifice, popped
to the pitcher. Cass stole second and
scored easily on Beeger's hard two
bagger to left. Childs bunted, send
ing Beeger to third, who came on the
way home when Workman missed a
hard peg to first.
Stanford had several other chances
to score, Cass being thrown out at the
plate in the sixth, but no runs re
sulted.
The "All Stars" obtained their lone
tally in the eighth. Gay was walked,
and O'Hara sacrificed him to second.
