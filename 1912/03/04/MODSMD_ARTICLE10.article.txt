### 
Stanford's fifteen track representa
tives justified the confidence placed in
them by the supporters of the Cardinal
by defeting the University of Southern
California athletes on Bovard Field,
Los Angeles, Saturday ,by the score of
74 to 57. The invaders annexed eight
first places and the relay race.

feated the pride of the Trojans,
Throop, in the hundred and pressed
him for honors in the longer sprint.
