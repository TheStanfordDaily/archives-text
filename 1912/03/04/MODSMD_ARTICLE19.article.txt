# AMERICAN VIGILANCE ASSOCIATION FORMED
## Doctor Jordan Elected Executive of National Organization for Curbing of Social Evil. 
### 
Through being a very vigorous ex
ponent of the extinction of one of the
worst evils in the United States, Presi
dent Jordan has been elected presi
dent of the American Vigilance Asso
ciation. This is an organization which
has grown out of the combined move
ment of influential men, who have been
devoting a great deal of money towards
the eradication of the white slave traf
fic in America. The list of members
is at present withheld, but among the
active workers in the cause are a num
ber of national figures who have been
strenuously engaged in curbing the
evil. Clifford G. Roe of Chicago, Dr.
(). E. Janney of Baltimore, and J. 13.
Reynolds, an assistant District Attor
ney of New York, who made a tour
abroad at the instigation of Colonel
Roosevelt to investigate the methods
of the white slavers, are most prom
inent of the active workers.
San Francisco, Chicago, and New
York are to be the centers from which
the reformers will work. Attack on the
commercial profits of the slavers is
the plan to be followed out. It is be
lieved that this will toe the most effec
tive way to put a stop to the evil.
