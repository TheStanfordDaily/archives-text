# FISTIC TOURNAMENT WILL BE HELD LATER IN APRIL.

### 
At the request of the athletes of the
water and cinder path, the Boxing
Tournament, to decide the champions
at various weights will he postponed
until after the Track Meet. As many
of the foremost mitt handlers are crew
men or track performers, and their
training work would keep many of
them from the bouts, the date has
been postponed on their account. The
tentative time now in the mind of the
Encina gymnasium officials is the week
following the Intercollegiate Track
Meet.
