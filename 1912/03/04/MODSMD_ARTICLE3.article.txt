# CHANGES MADE IN THE DEBATING AGREEMENT
## INTERCOLLEGIATE CONTEST IN SAN FRANCISCO. Carnot Will be Held Night Before Track Meet.â€”Use of Books Allowed. 
### 
Several important changes in the ar
rangements for forensic contests with
the University of California were made
at the meeting of the Intercollegiate
Debating Agreement Committee on
Saturday. The regular intercollegiate
debate will hereafter be held on the
first Friday in November, and will
take place in San Francisco in an
auditorium to be selected. Before the
earthquake, San Francisco was the
scene of the Stanford-California de
bate, and the arrangement proved very
successful. Packed houses were al
ways in evidence, even laboring men
coming to the hall directly from their
work to obtain good seats.
Hot*! with the idea of giving to the
debaters the inspiration and experi
ence of speaking before large aud
iences, and to better advertise the
Universities, the change to San Fran
cisco was made. While the permission
of home authorities is necessary to
make this new arrangement effective,
its advantages are so great that no
trouble is anticipated.
Speeches Shortened.
Each intercollegiate debater here
after will be allowed fifteen minutes
for his principal speech and five min
utes for rebuttal. Twenty minutes
for each man, with twenty-two to the
last negative speaker and a seven
minute affirmative rebuttal, is the sys
tem now in vogue. The changes will
provide speeches more snappy and in
teresting to the audience, and also
obtain more extemporaneous work.
The Carnot debaters will in the
future take the platform the evening
before the intercollegiate track meet.
During the two hours' preparation al
lowed these men after the announce
ment of the question, books may now
be used. This has in the past been a
mooted point.
The meeting of the Intercollegiate
Debating Agreement Committee was
held Saturday in San Francisco. The
California delegation consisted of
Sweet, Shipper, T. B. Kittredge, and
Drury, President of the Student Body,
ex-officio. Stanford was represented
by F. H. Hilton, '11, E. E. Tincher, '12,
and W. Tucker, '12. The agreements
there made will be in effect until 1914.
