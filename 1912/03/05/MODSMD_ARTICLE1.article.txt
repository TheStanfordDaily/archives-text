# STANFORD MEET GETS COAST-WIDE INTEREST
## SACRAMENTO WILL SEND TEAM FOR FIRST TIME. Portland Athletes Enthusiastic Over Interscholastic Competition and May Enter Strong List. 
### 
From Portland, Oregon, to Phoenix,
Arizona, schoolboy athletes are plan
ning to come to the championship
track and field meet for the prepara
tory institutions which is to be held
under the auspices of the Stanford
Interscholastic Athletic Association
on April 13. The largest entry list in
the history of the association will un
doubtedly have a place on the program
of this seventh annual meeting of the
secondary school athletes.
The northern schools are taking
great interest in the coming meet and
if it is possible to obtain the consent
of the faculty authorities Portland will
send a strong aggregation of runners,
jumpers and weightmen. S. H. Bel
lah, '10, who was a recent visitor to
the campus, has assisted the high
school lads of the Oregon metropolis
in their track training and although
the season is yet early many excellent
marks have been made.
The Phoenix High Schoolers planned
to send representatives to the Stanford
Interscholastic if the team which was
sent to uphold the school's colors in
Los Angeles on Washington's Birthday
made a creditable showing. The Ari
zona trackmen defeated some of the
best men in the south and It is very
likely that the new state will have a
contingent at Stanford in April.
Siicramento Sends Team.
Sacramento is the latest, city to send
word that the track team of the high
school is to enter the great competi
tion. The Capitol City institution will
send a strong representation and
promises to bring along several men
who may surprise their rival com
petitors. This will be the first time
that the Sacramento athletes have had
a team in the Stanford meet. Addi
tional interest is being manifested in
the meet by the students of Califor
nia's capital because of the fact that
Stockton is also to be represented.
The rivalry between the two schools
is very intense and both teams wish
to make a strong showing against the
other trackmen of the Pacific coast.
