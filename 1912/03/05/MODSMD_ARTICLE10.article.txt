There are some who say that stu
dents will not sit in judgment upon
their fellows; that it is impossible for

student self-govern
ment to succeed ow
ing to the futility of

placing in the hands of undergraduates
the direction and ordering of the be
v' tr of others. These people, we
'no; i ve, take too mean a view of the
■r of the men attending the Uni
ty and of the worth of their judg
ment concerning matters affecting
Stanford. To them we would suggest
consideration of the action taken yes
terday by the Undergraduate Commit
tee of the University of California.
During the December examinations
five students in the College of Me
chanics, all seniors, noted cheating in
a final examination. These men sub
mitted a written report of the matter
to the Student Affairs Committee,
which immediately took action. After
carefully examining every member of
the class the Committee recommended
to President Wheeler the withholding
of degrees for one year from four of
the men implicated and the placing of
another on probation until May.
The Student Affairs Committee which
handled the whole affair in such a
creditable manner is composed of
members of the Senior class. If prec
edent had been followed the persons
found guilty would have been summar
ily dismissed from the University. The
committee, however, took into consi
deration some mitigating circum
stances and regulated the punishment
accordingly.
