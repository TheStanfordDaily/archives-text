The Daily Palo Alto announces to
the representatives of the Kappa
Alpha Theta sorority and the Phi
Kappa Psi fraternity, and to the Uni
versity in general, the marriage of
Ruth Senile, age 20, of Alameda, to
Walter Victor Wilson, age 21, of Val
lejo, on Monday, February 26th.
Campus Cupid may lie a very sly
worker, but he has not yet been able
to outwit the college community.
When Miss Ruth Soule, ex-'l4, and
W. V. Wilson, ex-'l4, were united in
marriage on Monday at Redwood City,
they little thought their secret would
be betrayed so quickly.
It was a very quiet affair. Reverend
A. H. Chinn of Menlo Park performed
the ceremony in the Episcopal Church
at Redwood City. The only witnesses
were Mr. A. W. Darwall, curate of the
Episcopal Church, and his wife.
After the ceremony the couple van
ished for a short honeymoonâ€”where,
nobody knows! However, both ap
peared on the campus during the last
week end.
Rumors of the event had reached
the campus before them, but on being
questioned, both pleaded "not guilty"
emphatically.
While in college, Miss Soule was
very popular socially, and was a mem
ber of the Sophomore Play Com
mittee. She is enrolled in the Kappa
Alpha Theta sorority.
Wilson entered Stanford in January
1911, and last semester made his nu
merals as a member of the Freshman
rugby team. He was a member of the
Glee Club, and wears the badge of
Phi Kappa Psi fraternity.
