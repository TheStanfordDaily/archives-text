Weather permitting, the Stanford
Varsity will oppose the nine from
Santa Clara College to-morrow after
noon at 4 o'clock. This will he the
fourth meeting of these two teams,
the Catholic College players having
won the first two games and Stan
ford the last one.
Yesterday the Olympic Club of San
Francisco went down to defeat before
the Santa Clarans. Sullivan pitched
good ball against the city men for
eight innings but was relieved by Hai
ry when he began to falter. In to
morrow's game it is likely that Barry
will pitch and that Hatch will catch
for the visitors.
Coach Peters will send the regular

tion of left field, where Cliilds ami
Argabrite will change places during
the afternoon. The Freshman battery
of Couch and Dent will be used against
the valley players.
