# STUDENT WILL BUILD AN OBSERVATORY ON CAMPUS.
## 
### 
An observatory with a six inch re
flecting telescope is to be built under
the auspices of the department of Ap
plied Mathematics. The chief use of
the observatory will be by the stu
dents of Astronomy in observing the
celestial bodies. Permission has been
granted by the Board of Trustees for
the structure and it will be located on
or near the campus.
The plan was made possible through
the generous offer of A. G. Atkinson,
'12, a Civil Engineering major, greatly
interested in astronomy. He has
agreed to draw all the plans and speci
fications for telescope and observatory
and to do all the work of construct
ing both the instrument and the build
ing, the optical parts of the telescope
and the material for both to be pro
vided by the department.
