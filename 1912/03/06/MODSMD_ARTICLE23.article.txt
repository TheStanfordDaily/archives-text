# ALUMNI WRITERS IN CURRENT MAGAZINES.
## American and Sunset Contain Poetry and Prose From Pens of Stanford Authors. 
### 
As a two-fold indication of literary
ability among Stanford graduates, the
curent number of the American maga
zine contains an appreciation of two
alumni in this respect and a story by
a member of the faculty, an alumna,
while the March Sunset prints a short
poem by a Stanford graduate.
Miss Edith It. Mirrielees, '07, an In
structor in the English department, is
the author of the bit of fiction entitled,
"The Stronger Force." It is a gripping
story of the conquest of two men, who
have sunk to the lowest level, by the
moral force of a stronger mind. This
is not Miss Mirrielees' first contribu
tion to the American, for her name is
qualified as the author of "With Assist
ance."
The second article of interest to the
University public is a character sketch,
illustrated by a full page photograph,
of the Irwin brothers, Wallace, ex-'OO,
and Will, '99. The author, James
Montgomery Flagg, reviews their
achievements since they left Stanford
and characterizes them as the men
who have cornered the market in
poetry and prose.
F. E. Hill, '11, contributes a short
poem to this month's Sunset magazine
called "The Hidden Spirit." Hill was
editor of the Sequoia last year and
prominent in literary circles at Stan
ford.
