"The Difficulties of Religious Teach
ing in Japan," was the subject of an
interesting address given by Dr. Guy
of Japan before the local Y. W. C. A.
yesterday afternoon. Strict ruling
against religious teaching in schools,
the backwardness of the women to
take up new ideals, the difficulty of the
language, and the reluctance of the
people to give up a personal religion
are four factors, Dr. Guy asserted,
which greatly hinder the spread of
religion in the Island Empire.
