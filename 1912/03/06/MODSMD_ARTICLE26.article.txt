# FARCE PLAYERS WILL BE CHOSEN BY OPEN TRY-OUTS.
## 
### 
Open try-outs will be held for the
Senior Play sometime before the
Easter vacation. The parts will be
given ont early so that work can begin
immediately following the spring
recess.
The committee has narrowed its
choice down to two or three very mod
ern and up-to-date comedy dramas.
Their aim is to get a play that is
thoronghly modern and has in it a
sincere thread of interesting fun.
