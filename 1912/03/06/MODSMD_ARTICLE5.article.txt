# JUNIOR REPUBLIC FOUNDER DESCRIBES NOVEL VILLAGE
## Citizens of Freeville Community Are Not Inmates of an Institution, Says George in Assembly. 
### 
Those of the student body who heard
W. R. George describe the George
Junior Republic in an Assembly today
will have little difficulty in understand
ing his success in getting on the right
side of Young America.
Mr. George's enthusiasm is contagi
ous, and his good-natured, whimsical
method of address was thoroughy ap
preciated by his audience.
In introducing Mr. George, Presi
dent Jordan said that there had been
many Georges, George the Third, Lloyd
George and others, each George the
First in their day, as was George the
First of the Junior Republic today.
"The greatest problem we have met
in the management of the republic is
to get men to run it without running
it, men who can keep their hands off,"
said Mr. George.
A Heal Republic.
"First of all, it is a government of
the citizens of the republic, by the
citizens and for the citizens. The
republic isn't an institution, because
we give the citizens the liberty to do
wrong, although they must take the
consequences.
"The only difference between the
George Junior Republic and any othei
republic is that the citizens attain
the voting age at 16 instead of 21. It
is like a village in a great republic—
I don't call it a community because
people get the idea there is some 'ism'
connected with it.
"The George Junior republic isn't
Freeville, N. Y., but a village of 300
located on a hill overlooking the city
and about a mile distant. People have
mistaken it for the village of Free
ville; which doesn't look very 'institu
tioning' does it?
Visitors.
"When I take visitors about the re
public, we usually begin with one of
the cottages. I show them three oi
four girls getting dinner and a mother
ly woman in charge—not a matron —
that would be 'institutioning* again—
but a combination of a good mother
and boarding-house keeper. Then I
tell them that 10 or 15 boys board
there, and pay their board, and are
free to leave any time they wish, like
people who board in the outside
world. 'Is that so! Wonderful!' they
say.
"Then I show them a carpenter shop,
where boys are working to lern a
trade under a carpenter teacher.
Those who do the best work get the
best pay, and those who do the poor
est get the poorest pay, or get bounced.

" 'See that chap outside the door,' I
say. "That's the cop!' 'The cop? O,
you mean the 'policeman' is the
answer. 'Does he really arrest
people?' 'Surely.' 'Do they like to
be arrested?' 'No.' 'And does he
really use force?' 'You bet he does.'
The Jail.
"After that I show them the jail, a
real jail, and tell them that after a
boy is convicted by a jury of his peers
he must stay inside, and explain that
the laws of the republic the the laws
of New York state," continued Mr.
George.
"Now, if I went through the streets
of the average village and explained
all these things, would a crowd follow
me and say 'How wonderful!'? No;
they probably would say 'How dippy!'
"Yet its all so absurdly simple.
There is really no difference between
the republic and the ordinary village
as far as institutions, administration
and laws are concerned."
Mr. George told in detail of diffi
culties in the establishment of the re
public. How all but 5 of 50 boys de
serted him, and of the tribulations of
these 5 and himself because of finan
cial difficulty in the early days of the
republic.
Their Records.
Of these 5, Mr. George said, Jacob
Smith, the first president of the re
public, afterwards made Phi Beta Kap
pa in Cornell and steered the Varsity
eight to victory in the record-break
ing race at Poughkeepsie. Today he
is a prosperous attorney in Syracuse,
affirmed Mr. George. The records of
the other four were little less note
worthy.
"When the fame of the republic be
gan to spread, the reform schools
sent us some of their inmates," con
tinued Mr. George. "You should have
seen the beauts we got from them.
They said they would fix George, and
if it had not been for the boys, they
would. It takes a boy to handle a
boy.
"Well, the bad boys turned out so
good that 1 made being bad the general
qualification for a prospective citizen.
The boys from Hell's Kitchen or Mul
berry Bend in New York have proved
our best citizens.
"In conclusion, I want you to re
member that the republic is only a
village in real life, where a boy learns
to live by a trade and to be a good
citizen by being a citizen.'*

free to leave any time they wish, like
people who board in the outside
world. 'Is that so! Wonderful!' they
say.
"Then I show them a carpenter shop,
where boys are working to lern a
trade under a carpenter teacher.
Those who do the best work get the
best pay, and those who do the poor
est get the poorest pay, or get bounced.

" 'See that chap outside the door,' I
say. "That's the cop!' 'The cop? O,
you mean the 'policeman' is the
answer. 'Does he really arrest
people?' 'Surely.' 'Do they like to
be arrested?' 'No.' 'And does he
really use force?' 'You bet he does.'
The Jail.
"After that I show them the jail, a
real jail, and tell them that after a
boy is convicted by a jury of his peers
he must stay inside, and explain that
the laws of the republic the the laws
of New York state," continued Mr.
George.
"Now, if I went through the streets
of the average village and explained
all these things, would a crowd follow
me and say 'How wonderful!'? No;
they probably would say 'How dippy!'
"Yet its all so absurdly simple.
There is really no difference between
the republic and the ordinary village
as far as institutions, administration
and laws are concerned."
Mr. George told in detail of diffi
culties in the establishment of the re
public. How all but 5 of 50 boys de
serted him, and of the tribulations of
these 5 and himself because of finan
cial difficulty in the early days of the
republic.
Their Records.
Of these 5, Mr. George said, Jacob
Smith, the first president of the re
public, afterwards made Phi Beta Kap
pa in Cornell and steered the Varsity
eight to victory in the record-break
ing race at Poughkeepsie. Today he
is a prosperous attorney in Syracuse,
affirmed Mr. George. The records of
the other four were little less note
worthy.
"When the fame of the republic be
gan to spread, the reform schools
sent us some of their inmates," con
tinued Mr. George. "You should have
seen the beauts we got from them.
They said they would fix George, and
if it had not been for the boys, they
would. It takes a boy to handle a
boy.
"Well, the bad boys turned out so
good that 1 made being bad the general
qualification for a prospective citizen.
The boys from Hell's Kitchen or Mul
berry Bend in New York have proved
our best citizens.
"In conclusion, I want you to re
member that the republic is only a
village in real life, where a boy learns
to live by a trade and to be a good
citizen by being a citizen.'*

Those of the student body who heard
W. R. George describe the George
Junior Republic in an Assembly today
will have little difficulty in understand
ing his success in getting on the right
side of Young America.
Mr. George's enthusiasm is contagi
ous, and his good-natured, whimsical
method of address was thoroughy ap
preciated by his audience.
In introducing Mr. George, Presi
dent Jordan said that there had been
many Georges, George the Third, Lloyd
George and others, each George the
First in their day, as was George the
First of the Junior Republic today.
"The greatest problem we have met
in the management of the republic is
to get men to run it without running
it, men who can keep their hands off,"
said Mr. George.
A Heal Republic.
"First of all, it is a government of
the citizens of the republic, by the
citizens and for the citizens. The
republic isn't an institution, because
we give the citizens the liberty to do
wrong, although they must take the
consequences.
"The only difference between the
George Junior Republic and any othei
republic is that the citizens attain
the voting age at 16 instead of 21. It
is like a village in a great republic—
I don't call it a community because
people get the idea there is some 'ism'
connected with it.
"The George Junior republic isn't
Freeville, N. Y., but a village of 300
located on a hill overlooking the city
and about a mile distant. People have
mistaken it for the village of Free
ville; which doesn't look very 'institu
tioning' does it?

"When I take visitors about the re
public, we usually begin with one of
the cottages. I show them three oi
four girls getting dinner and a mother

that would be 'institutioning* again—

and boarding-house keeper. Then I
tell them that 10 or 15 boys board
there, and pay their board, and are
