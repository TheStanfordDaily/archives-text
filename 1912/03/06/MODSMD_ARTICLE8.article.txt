### 
Thirteen baseball players, accom
panied by Coach Peters and Manager
Burbank, will leave for Los Angeles
to-morrow evening. Two games with
Occidental have been arranged to take
place on Friday and Saturday after
noons. This will be the only away
from the campus appearance of the
Cardinal nine until the trans-bay inva
sion at the month-end.
Besides the one full team, an extra
battery, one inflelder and one out
fielder will make the trip. Captain
Gilfillan will play third, with Terry
at short, Cass 011 second, and Obear on
first. Childs, Noble and Beeger are
the regular fielders to go south.
Gault will be the extra man in the out
field while Argabrite will be reserved
for the infield. Pitchers Jones and
Couch, together with their catchers,
Scofield and Dent, will form the two
batteries to be used against the south
erners.
Rain has interfered with the Var
sity practice during this week but it
is probable that the weather will per
mit the playing of both games in the
south.
