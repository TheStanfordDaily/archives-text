Racquet wielders from the Univer
sity of California will meet the Var
sity experts in the annual intercol

game at Berkeley is the only athletic
event scheduled for this date, a large
atendance at the matches is assured.
The courts will be placed at the dis
posal of the California team three or
four times in the next month in order
that they may become accustomed to
the lines.
The Varsity team will have the bene
fit of practice games with three tennis
experts from San Francisco during the
Spring vacation which should round
the players into form for the annual
battle.
Arrangements were made during the

for a team of four players of the Uni
versity of Southern California to visit
the campus about March 24. Newell
