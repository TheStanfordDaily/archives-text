# Founders' Day.
## 
### 
Founders' Day occupies a unique
position in the Stanford calendar as

the day set apart
to do honor to the
founders of the Uni

versity. Senator Leland Stanford was
born on the ninth of March, 1824, just
eighty-eight years ago, and this date
has been observed with appropriate
exercises since the founding of the
University.
Saturday morning every student of
Stanford should lie in attendance at
the Assembly Hall. The program is
excellent, centering, as it does, around
the speech of Honorable Horace Davis,
"An Afternoon View of College Life."
As a matter of sentiment the Univer
sity community should make the ob
servance of Founders' Day, the note
worthy ceremony of the year.
