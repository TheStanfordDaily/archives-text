### 
In a statement issued today the
Student Affairs Committee announces

the suspension of a
first-year student for
two weeks and the

addition of ten hours to his gradua
tion requirements as a punishment
for cheating.
The case was a clearly proven one
and the action of the Committee, was,
if anything, lenient. We hope that
making an example of this man will
cause some of the underclassmen to
realize that cheating will no longer
be countenanced at Stanford.
