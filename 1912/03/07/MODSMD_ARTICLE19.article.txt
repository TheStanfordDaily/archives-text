# FRESHMAN COMMITTEE HOLDS SECRET MEETING.
## First Year Students Expect to be Startled sit Their Fun-fest on Friday Night. 
### 
Vague rumors of unusual stunts to
be given at the Freshman Jolly-up to
morrow evening, which have been
heard on the campus during the past
few days, were substantiated today
when Chairman F. E. McClure of the
Jolly-up committee admitted that a
few surprises might be sprung. It is
known that the committee has been
meeting in secret for more than a week
and speculation is rife as to just what
will await the first year students when
they assemble at the Armory.
The Robins lecture for the men of
the University will be opened promptly
at 7:30 to-morrow evening, allowing
the Freshmen an ample margin of
time to take the special cars at S:3O.
