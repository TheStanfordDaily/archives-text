# CHAPPIE ISSUES SPRING SPORTS NUMBER FRIDAY
## BASE MALL-CHEW CHAPARRAL IS SNAPPY AND LIVE. Contains High Class Art and Literary Material Appropriate to Athletic Season. 
### 
Inspired by the enthusiasm of spring
athletic training, "Chappie" will ap
pear on the campus to-morrow morn
ing with a combination Baseball-Crew
number in honor of the men fighting
for the Cardinal in these sports. The
high class of the literary and art
material in this Chaparral bids fair
to mark it as one of the strongest
issues of the semester. Contributions
from an unusually large number of
humorists have resulted in a choice
selection of shorter material and verse
while the drawings and longer articles
are typical of the regular Chaparral
staff.
The usual front page sketch con
sists of a set of panels, depicting
phases of baseball, by J. L. Duff, '13,
while another amusing full-page car
toon by A. T. King, '12, is called
"Diving for Pennies in 1950." Miss D.
Egbert, '15, has contributed a striking
piece of pen and ink work of a girl's
head, appropriate to the season.
Other cuts are from the drawings
of E. E. Manning, '13, Miss M. Bailey,
'14, M. W. Allen, '15, and J. Olsen, '15.
J. W. Howell, '12, is the author of
the initial poem entitled "The Crew."
A snappy "Dilettante" in keeping with
the general tone of the issue has been
written by J. C. Thomas, '12, while
baseball has been made the theme of
a humorous parody on cheap liter
ature, by M. T. Dooling, '12, headed
"Frank Merryhell's Weakly." The
illustrations to this piece are the work
of J. L. Duff, '13.
Shorter material has been contri
buted by E. W. Pugh, '11, H. H. Beall,

J. C. Thomas, '12, J. W. Howell, '12,

the women students for the use of
leap-year advantages."

and lay bare a dark conspiracy among
the women students for the use of
leap-year advantages."
Inspired by the enthusiasm of spring
athletic training, "Chappie" will ap
pear on the campus to-morrow morn
ing with a combination Baseball-Crew
number in honor of the men fighting
for the Cardinal in these sports. The
high class of the literary and art
material in this Chaparral bids fair
to mark it as one of the strongest
issues of the semester. Contributions
from an unusually large number of
humorists have resulted in a choice
selection of shorter material and verse
while the drawings and longer articles
are typical of the regular Chaparral
staff.
The usual front page sketch con
sists of a set of panels, depicting
phases of baseball, by J. L. Duff, '13,
while another amusing full-page car
toon by A. T. King, '12, is called
"Diving for Pennies in 1950." Miss D.
Egbert, '15, has contributed a striking
piece of pen and ink work of a girl's
head, appropriate to the season.
Other cuts are from the drawings
of E. E. Manning, '13, Miss M. Bailey,
'14, M. W. Allen, '15, and J. Olsen, '15.
J. W. Howell, '12, is the author of
the initial poem entitled "The Crew."
A snappy "Dilettante" in keeping with
the general tone of the issue has been
written by J. C. Thomas, '12, while
baseball has been made the theme of
a humorous parody on cheap liter
ature, by M. T. Dooling, '12, headed
"Frank Merryhell's Weakly." The
illustrations to this piece are the work
of J. L. Duff, '13.
Shorter material has been contri
buted by E. W. Pugh, '11, H. H. Beall,
'11, M. T. Dooling, '11, P. M. Levy, '12,
J. C. Thomas, '12, J. W. Howell, '12,
N. C. Wilson, '12, M. M. Fogel, '12, E.
E. Suits, '13, C. L. Coffin, '13, W. F.
Kilcline, '15, and M. A. Hagen, '15.
The "Now Thats" consist of editor
ial remarks on "Cheating," "Baseball
and Crew," "An Answer to the Late
Criticism by Lady Teazle of Stanford's
Attitude on Dress-suits," and a
"Startling Exposure" which Editor
Summerfield declares "Will unearth
and lay bare a dark conspiracy among
the women students for the use of
leap-year advantages."
