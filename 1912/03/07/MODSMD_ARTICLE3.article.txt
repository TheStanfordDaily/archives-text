A meeting of the Mechanical Engin
eering Society was held last evening
at which a number of interesting and
instructive reports were read by mem
bers. A talk by Professor E. P. Les
ley was a feature of the session.

In order to avoid any possible
conflict with the Founders' Day
exercises the track meet on
Saturday with the Olympic Oluh
will be held in the afternoon
instead of in the morn I nor as
UMinl. The first event will he
called lit three o'clock.
