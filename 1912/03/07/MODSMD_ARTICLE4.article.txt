# WILL COMMEMORATE FOUNDERS' DAY
## TRUSTEE HORACE DAVIS TO BE PRINCIPAL SPEAKER SATURDAY AT ASSEMBLY HALL. EXCELLLENT PROGRAMME IS ARRANGED. 
### 
In commeration of the services ren
dered the University by the Stanford
family, Founders' day exercises are
to be held in the Assembly Hall, with
the Honorable Horace Davis, LL.D.,
member of the Hoard of Trustees,
as the principal speaker. Saturday,
March 9, is the eighty-eighth birthday
of the late Senator Stanford. As the
birthdays of Mrs. Jane L. Stanford
and Leland Stanford, Junior, occur
during the vacation it has been the
custom to have special exercises in
memory of the family whose name the
University bears. Mrs. Stanford was
born in August, and May was the
birth month of Leland Junior.
Horace Davis is one of the three
surviving members of the original
Board of Trustees. He has served the
University for twenty-seven years.
Davis occupies the peculiar position
of having served as president of the
University of California and is now
member of the Stanford board. He
formerly held a seat in Congress.
Harvard, the speaker's own alma
mater, conferred the degree of Doctor
of Laws, last year for his distinguished
work.
The subject of the Founders' Day
address is "An Afternoon View of Col
lege Life."
Dr. Jordan to Preside.
Doctor Jordan is to make the intro

ductory remarks and it is likely that
he will give a brief review of the work
done for the University by the found
ers. At a similar assembly in 1909
Doctor Jordan delivered one of his
best addresses on the struggles of
Mrs. Stanford to keep up her task of
providing for the University during
the dark days of its existence.
This year it is the aim of the Com
mittee on Public Exercises to make
the Founders' Day services more im
pressive and more dignified than ever
before. The Senior class will attend
in a body. After the addresses in the
Assembly Hall, special services are
to be held at the Mausoleum. The
program in the Assembly Hall is to
begin at 10:30.
