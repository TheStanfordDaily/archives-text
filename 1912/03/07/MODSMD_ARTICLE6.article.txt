# REPORTER ON THE WAR PATH FOR BLIND GOD.
## Daily Representative to Run Down All Suspicious Casesâ€”Will Inspect County Records.

In the words of the trackmen, Cupid
has again beaten the gun. He did not
wait for the brighter days which come
with the departure of the immediate
need for the weather man. The (lowers
that bloom in the spring have not yet
arrived, bringing with them amorous
effect on sentimental couples. The
little god whose path leads to the county
clerk's office has again evidenced his
hand in the affairs of residents of the
Stanford Farm. So much secrecy has
been maintained in this latest romance
that even the fraternity and sorority
brothers and sisters of the parties of
the first and second part of the agree
ment are not able to confirm their
suspicions.
With the recent rumors which are
gaining rapid circulation on the cam
pus, without the assistance of any
longest leased wires, the question of
the day has ceased to be the track
prospects or the baseball outlook.
Are you married? has taken the place
of the usual morning salutation.
The latest passengers to walk up the
gang-plank of the boat bound for tlit
Matrimonial Sea are members of the
Sophomore class.
