T. SANBORN, Secretary.
Eleven soccer men, the victors in the
Washington's Birthday game against
California for the Williamson trophy,
were awarded their minor sport em
blems at the meeting of the Executive
Committee last night. The increased
interest in the kicking game and the
number of men participating in the
sport, led to placing soccer on the
same basis as tennis at the beginning
of the year.
The letter the minor sport players
are allowed to wear consists of a
small "S" enclosed in a circle. This
letter can be placed on any kind of a
sweater with the exception of the so
called varsity sweater, the heavy, roll
necked variey, which will henceforth
be reserved for the exclusive use of
football, baseball, track and crew
athletes.
The men gaining the privilege to
sport the "S" by participation in the
game against California are: W. P.
Butcher, '13, of Santa Barbara; R. J.
McCann, '10, of Pacific Grove; L. S.
King, '12, of Oakland; F. H. Hilton,
'11, of Portland, Ore.. J. L. Reynolds,
'12, of Los Angeles; H. K. Williams,'l3,
Los Angeles; A. L. Erb, '15, Che
mainus, B. C.; B. E. Erb, '12, Che
mainus; S. F. Pellas, '14, New York;
A. D. Fyfe, '13, Ocean Side; A. W. Hig
gins, Hockley, England.
Only one game for the Williamson
trophy was played this year on ac
count of the late start of the series
and an inability to secure dates, but
in the future three games a year will
be played for the trophy.
