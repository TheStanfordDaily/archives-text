# STUDENT CONTROL PROPOSED
## OLYMPIC CLUB CONTESTS ON OVAL WITH CARDINAL CAPTAIN GERHARDT WILL BRING STRONG TEAM. Meet Begins at 2:30.â€”Phil Wand May Handle the Starter's Gun. 
### 
With an array of athletes that would
do credit to any organization, Captain
Pete Gerhardt of the Olympic Club, is
to invade the Stanford precincts to
morrow afternoon to wrest victory
from the Cardinal cinder path men.
Every season the clubmen have a
strong team of trackmen but it has>
been difficult to bring the best men to
compete with the rival universities.
This year, however, with the prospect
of the Olympian try-outs before them,
a large contingent of runners, jumpers
and vaulters are training with the
Winged "O"' and many of these men
are to enter to-morrow's competition.
Con Walsh, who recently established
a new record with the 56 pound weight,
is the latest to enlist for service
against the Cardinal. Ralph Rose is
also expected to disport his ponderous
frame in the hammer throwers' cage.
Snedigar will probably be Gerhardt's
mate in the sprints.
In the distances the visitors are es
pecially dangerous with T. M. Cramer,
'11, Craig, Garvin, Hoburg, Stout and
Hartwell among the entries. C. S.
Morris, '08, who gave Smith son such
a surprise in the latter's indoor
world's record run in the hurdles two
weeks ago, and Donald of the 1911
California squad, are the timber top
pers for the Post street aggregation.
The meet is scheduled for 2:30,
and promptly at this hour the starter
will send the runners from their
marks in the mile run. The regular
season tickets will admit their holders
to the bleachers; otherwise the ad
mission will be twenty-five cents. All
of Captain Coleman's varsity men are
to compete.
Efforts are being made to secure
Phil Wand to act as starter but it is
not known whether he can come down.
Wand is one of the best starters in
the state and he has been chosen to
serve in that capacity at the Olympic
try-outs here in May. By having him
officiate in several of the preliminary
meets around the bay it is hoped that
more of the athletes can acquaint
themselves with his style of starting
before the big try-out.
