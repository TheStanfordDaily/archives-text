# CUPID INTERFERES WITH ACTIVITIES OF STUDFNTS
## SIGHT RETURNS TO BLIND GOD AND RUMOR FLEES. Double Ceremony to be Celebrated on March 15 as Result of Romance. 
### 
'Twas all in the play. Silently, like
the resident ot' the desert, Dame
Rumor has folded up her collapsible
possessions and expressed them where
gossip nourishes not. The campus in
habitants have been unduly curious
over the actions of the press in in
vestigating all suspicious matrimonial
cases.
The recent flurry in the marriage
market was but short lived. With the
formal announcement of the pledging
of troths of Christopher Jedbury, Jr.,
and Miss Dora I led way, and Tom
Bellaby and Miss Nelly Jedbury,
the most romantic affaire de Eros of
the semester is to culminate on the
evening of March 15.
Friends of the two couples who are
associated with them in the approach
ing second year production, are to
act as attendants at the ceremony. In
preparation for the wedding the en
tire party is making the week one of
festivity.
Pictures on Exhibition.
Members of the cast of the Sopho
more comedy, "Christopher, Jr.," in
dulged in one of their periodical
journeys to far-off India yesterday af
ternoon. Like all tourists, they spent
most of their time having their pic
tures taken amid their surroundings.
The results of this photographic
seance were apparent in the Quad
windows this afternoon.
For the first time the young actors
dressed in the costumes which they
will wear on the evening of March
15. Several "types" which should de
light the heart of the student of
humanity made their appearanceâ€”
meek Mr. Glibb, far from garruluos,
he of the colossal brain; irascible old
Mr. Jedbury, and fiery Mr. Simpson of
the cavernous voice. Two handsome
young gentlemen, Christopher, Jr., and
Tom Bellaby, were cool and unruffled
even in that torrid climate. The muse
of poetry being barred from news
paper offices, description of the repre
sentatives of the softer sex is not at
tempted here. Look in the Quad win
dows yourself.
Tickets for "Christopher, Jr.," will
go on sale at the usual places on Mon
day morning.
