into the ranks of probabilities. The

"willin'," and it is now up to the men

The University Conference, at a
meeting last night, put the final
touches on a general plan for student
control of discipline and student
affairs in general. The Faculty Stu
dent Affairs Committee has given its
entire approval of the plan as sub
mitted.
A general meeting of the men of the
student body has been called for
Thursday, March 14, at the 11:15 hour
to discuss the plan in all its features.
Officials of the student body and men
thoroughly conversant with the possi
bilities and practil ilities of student
government here and elsewhere will
present the features of student con
trol to the men of the University at
that time.
Opportunity will be given the stu
dents to hear the proposed plan dis
cussed in all its phases and to pre
sent any questions as to the exact
nature of its operation.
The Conference and the Students'
Advisory Committee desires that the
men of the University be thoroughly
informed of the plan in order that they
may cast an intelligent ballot on the
proposition.
Will Vote March 20.
On Wednesday, March 20, the men

of the University will vote on the plan
as presented, at a general election on
the Quad. The officials who will be
in charge of the election will be named
and announced later.
The plan, as offered, places the re
sponsibility for the control of student
affairs in the hands of a committee
composed of the Advisory Board of the
University Conference, which is elected
from the members of the Conference.
This committee will deal with the
individual cases and carry on the work
now done by the Student Affairs Com
mittee of the Faculty. This virtually
throws the responsibility for the dis
cipling and the administration of stu
dent affairs upon the shoulders of the
students themselves through their rep
resentatives.
The present members of the Advi
sory Board of the University Confer
ence are K. L. Dole, L. D. Summerfield,
M. T. Dooling, F. Brown, and K. L.
Schaupp.
The Advisory Board at present is in
reality the executive committee of the
University Conference, from which it
takes its instructions, and to which
it makes its reports 011 all matters
with which it deals.
Five Men at Large.
The present departmental system of
electing members of the Conference
presents the possibility of efficient
men being shut out of the organization
because of the regulation which bases
representation 011 enrollment in the
several departments.
To eliminate the chance of overlook
ing the services of good men in this
manner, it has been decided that five
delegates at large be added to the
Conference. These men will be chosen
from the upperclassmen of the Univer
sity, irrespective of departments, and
will be elected at general student body
meetings. This is the only change to
be made in the organization of the
Conference.
The plan presented is in general
operation the same as that which has
been so successful at the University of
California and other similar insti
tutions. The organization as provided
presents no difficulties that have not
been overcome by other institutions
into which it has been introduced.
Credit for the successful consumma
tion of the plan so long desired in
large measure is due to Student Ad
viser A. E. Roth and the members of
(he University Conference.
Roth has labored unceasingly to
attain student control for the men in
oruer mai oianioru may enroll lisen
among the institutions which are tak
ing up progressive measures in ad
ministration.

The University Conference, at a
meeting last night, put the final
touches on a general plan for student
control of discipline and student
affairs in general. The Faculty Stu
dent Affairs Committee has given its
entire approval of the plan as sub
mitted.
A general meeting of the men of the
student body has been called for
Thursday, March 14, at the 11:15 hour
to discuss the plan in all its features.
Officials of the student body and men
thoroughly conversant with the possi
bilities and practil ilities of student
government here and elsewhere will
present the features of student con
trol to the men of the University at
that time.
Opportunity will be given the stu
dents to hear the proposed plan dis
cussed in all its phases and to pre
sent any questions as to the exact
nature of its operation.
The Conference and the Students'
Advisory Committee desires that the
men of the University be thoroughly
informed of the plan in order that they
may cast an intelligent ballot on the
proposition.
Will Vote March 20.
On Wednesday, March 20, the men

of the University will vote on the plan
as presented, at a general election on
the Quad. The officials who will be
in charge of the election will be named
and announced later.
The plan, as offered, places the re
sponsibility for the control of student
affairs in the hands of a committee
composed of the Advisory Board of the
University Conference, which is elected
from the members of the Conference.
This committee will deal with the
individual cases and carry on the work
now done by the Student Affairs Com
mittee of the Faculty. This virtually
throws the responsibility for the dis
cipling and the administration of stu
dent affairs upon the shoulders of the
students themselves through their rep
resentatives.
The present members of the Advi

The Advisory Board at present is in
reality the executive committee of the
University Conference, from which it
takes its instructions, and to which
it makes its reports 011 all matters
with which it deals.
Five Men at Large.
The present departmental system of
electing members of the Conference
presents the possibility of efficient
men being shut out of the organization
because of the regulation which bases
representation 011 enrollment in the
several departments.
To eliminate the chance of overlook
ing the services of good men in this
manner, it has been decided that five
delegates at large be added to the
Conference. These men will be chosen
from the upperclassmen of the Univer
sity, irrespective of departments, and
will be elected at general student body
meetings. This is the only change to
be made in the organization of the
Conference.
The plan presented is in general
operation the same as that which has
been so successful at the University of
California and other similar insti
tutions. The organization as provided
presents no difficulties that have not
been overcome by other institutions
into which it has been introduced.
Credit for the successful consumma
tion of the plan so long desired in
large measure is due to Student Ad
viser A. E. Roth and the members of
(he University Conference.
Roth has labored unceasingly to
attain student control for the men in
oruer mai oianioru may enroll lisen

The University Conference, at a
meeting last night, put the final
touches on a general plan for student
control of discipline and student
affairs in general. The Faculty Stu
dent Affairs Committee has given its
entire approval of the plan as sub
mitted.
A general meeting of the men of the
student body has been called for
Thursday, March 14, at the 11:15 hour
to discuss the plan in all its features.
Officials of the student body and men
thoroughly conversant with the possi
bilities and practil ilities of student
government here and elsewhere will
present the features of student con
trol to the men of the University at
that time.
Opportunity will be given the stu
dents to hear the proposed plan dis
cussed in all its phases and to pre
sent any questions as to the exact
nature of its operation.
The Conference and the Students'
Advisory Committee desires that the
men of the University be thoroughly
informed of the plan in order that they
may cast an intelligent ballot on the
proposition.
Will Vote March 20.
On Wednesday, March 20, the men

of the University will vote on the plan
as presented, at a general election on
the Quad. The officials who will be
in charge of the election will be named
and announced later.
The plan, as offered, places the re
sponsibility for the control of student
affairs in the hands of a committee
composed of the Advisory Board of the
University Conference, which is elected
from the members of the Conference.
This committee will deal with the
individual cases and carry on the work
now done by the Student Affairs Com
mittee of the Faculty. This virtually
throws the responsibility for the dis
cipling and the administration of stu
dent affairs upon the shoulders of the
students themselves through their rep
resentatives.
The present members of the Advi
sory Board of the University Confer
ence are K. L. Dole, L. D. Summerfield,
M. T. Dooling, F. Brown, and K. L.
Schaupp.
The Advisory Board at present is in
reality the executive committee of the
University Conference, from which it
takes its instructions, and to which
it makes its reports 011 all matters
with which it deals.
Five Men at Large.
The present departmental system of
electing members of the Conference
presents the possibility of efficient
men being shut out of the organization
because of the regulation which bases
representation 011 enrollment in the
several departments.
To eliminate the chance of overlook
ing the services of good men in this
manner, it has been decided that five
delegates at large be added to the
Conference. These men will be chosen
from the upperclassmen of the Univer
sity, irrespective of departments, and
will be elected at general student body
meetings. This is the only change to
be made in the organization of the
Conference.
The plan presented is in general
operation the same as that which has
been so successful at the University of
California and other similar insti
tutions. The organization as provided
presents no difficulties that have not
been overcome by other institutions
into which it has been introduced.
Credit for the successful consumma
tion of the plan so long desired in
large measure is due to Student Ad
viser A. E. Roth and the members of
(he University Conference.
Roth has labored unceasingly to
attain student control for the men in
oruer mai oianioru may enroll lisen

for discusion of Plan.

Wednesday, March 20. Vote on Quad
by ballot on question of Student Con
trol for Men.
Student Control for Men, long de
bated, desired and anticipated, has ad
vanced from the realms of possibilities
into the ranks of probabilities. The
trustees are "willin'the faculty is
"willin'," and it is now up to the men
of the University themselves to seal
the pact by balloting their Approval,
The University Conference, at a
meeting last night, put the final
touches on a general plan for student
control of discipline and student
affairs in general. The Faculty Stu
dent Affairs Committee has given its
entire approval of the plan as sub
mitted.
A general meeting of the men of the
student body has been called for
Thursday, March 14, at the 11:15 hour
to discuss the plan in all its features.
Officials of the student body and men
thoroughly conversant with the possi
bilities and practil ilities of student
government here and elsewhere will
present the features of student con
trol to the men of the University at
that time.
Opportunity will be given the stu
dents to hear the proposed plan dis
cussed in all its phases and to pre
sent any questions as to the exact
nature of its operation.
The Conference and the Students'
Advisory Committee desires that the
men of the University be thoroughly
informed of the plan in order that they
may cast an intelligent ballot on the
proposition.
Will Vote March 20.
On Wednesday, March 20, the men

of the University will vote on the plan
as presented, at a general election on
the Quad. The officials who will be
in charge of the election will be named
and announced later.
The plan, as offered, places the re
sponsibility for the control of student
affairs in the hands of a committee
composed of the Advisory Board of the
University Conference, which is elected
from the members of the Conference.
This committee will deal with the
individual cases and carry on the work
now done by the Student Affairs Com
mittee of the Faculty. This virtually
throws the responsibility for the dis
cipling and the administration of stu
dent affairs upon the shoulders of the
students themselves through their rep
resentatives.
The present members of the Advi
sory Board of the University Confer
ence are K. L. Dole, L. D. Summerfield,
M. T. Dooling, F. Brown, and K. L.
Schaupp.
The Advisory Board at present is in
reality the executive committee of the
University Conference, from which it
takes its instructions, and to which
it makes its reports 011 all matters
with which it deals.
Five Men at Large.
The present departmental system of
electing members of the Conference
presents the possibility of efficient
men being shut out of the organization
because of the regulation which bases
representation 011 enrollment in the
several departments.
To eliminate the chance of overlook
ing the services of good men in this
manner, it has been decided that five
delegates at large be added to the
Conference. These men will be chosen
from the upperclassmen of the Univer
sity, irrespective of departments, and
will be elected at general student body
meetings. This is the only change to
be made in the organization of the
Conference.
The plan presented is in general
operation the same as that which has
been so successful at the University of
California and other similar insti
tutions. The organization as provided
presents no difficulties that have not
been overcome by other institutions
into which it has been introduced.
Credit for the successful consumma
tion of the plan so long desired in
large measure is due to Student Ad
viser A. E. Roth and the members of
(he University Conference.
Roth has labored unceasingly to
attain student control for the men in
oruer mai oianioru may enroll lisen
among the institutions which are tak
ing up progressive measures in ad
ministration.
