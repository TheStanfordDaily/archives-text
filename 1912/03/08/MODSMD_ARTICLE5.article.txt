# Everybody Kicking His Eye Aroun' or HELL FOR HILL!
## 
### 
L. L. Hill, Ml, has a beautiful ocular
demonstration of the effect of a soccer
ball upon the eye. Hill stopped the
ball not wisely but pretty well, and
bis organ of eisht is now assuming a
nebulous form. It is hoped that the
contusion will take definite shape by
nightfall.
