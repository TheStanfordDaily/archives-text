# Student Control.

### 
Student Control has come at last.
After undergraduates and alumni di
lated for years upon the benefits that

would be derived
from placing the
disciplinary func-

tions of the Faculty Student Affairs
Committee in the hands of a committee
of students, we are now face to face
with the proposal to grant us these
long desired powers. It is now only
a question whether the men of the
University wish to be self-governed
and believe themselves cap able of suc
cessfully carrying out the new plan.
The proposal voluntarily made by
the Faculty grants everything that
could be wished, and we are pleased
to see its extreme liberality. The stu
dent committee will be absolutely un
hampered in its work by precedents
and will have full discretionary powers
in all its actions. It will be guided
solely by the few rules laid down by
the Trustees of the University and the
Academic Council, and a regard for
the good name of Stanford.
The step to student control is one
that should be taken only after the
most careful deliberation. Practically
every man in the University must be
willing to accept the responsibility
or the movement will be a failure, for
its success relies upon an undivided
sentiment in support of the Advisory
Committee of the Conference.
