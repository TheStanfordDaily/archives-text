# Founders' Day.
## 
### 
The Senior class has many note
worthy achievements to its credit in

the four years of its
college life, but we
think the one that

1912 will remember the longest and
regard with the greatest pride, is the
establishment of the custom of at
tending Founders' Day Services in a
body. To-morrow morning will be
the first time (his has ever been doue
here, and it will reflect great credit
on 1912 if the class is fully represent
ed at the exercises.
