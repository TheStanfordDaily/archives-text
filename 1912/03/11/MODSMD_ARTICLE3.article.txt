# ALUMNI AND UNDERGRADUATES ASSEMBLE TO HONOR FOUNDERS
## HORACE DAVIS HEARD IN MEMORABLE ADDRESS MAN OF AFFAIRS AND SCHOLAR SPEAKS IN HALL. "An Afternoon View of College Life" Subject of Discourse by Trustee Member. 
### 
Bringing a message rich with the
benefits reaped from the experience of
a life of usefulness to his fellowmen,
Honorable Horace Davis, member of
the Hoard of Trustees, made memor
able the twentieth commemoration of
the day set aside in honor of the
Founders of the University. The ven
erable speaker, little evidencing in the
presentation of his address the weight
of his eighty-one years, chose as his
subject, "An Afternoon View of College
Education." Clad in the robes of a
Doctor of Laws, which degree was
conferred upon him by his alma mater.
Harvard, for the services he had ren
dered to his country, the venerable
scholar who has been the pupil of
Agassiz, Longfellow, Sparks, Walker
and Channing, made a deep impres
sion as he characteristically outlined
the life of the graduate of college
from the graduate days into the period
of struggles with the world.
"A man is a success or a failure
before fifty-five. If he has not made
good by that time his chance is slim.
So I call fifty-five the climax of power.
Virile strength declines after this age,
as a rule. As a man stands on the
summit surveying his past and medi
tating on the cause of his success, if
he is honest with himself, he will say,
"My debt to my college cannot be
measured; she taught me how to think.
The mere information 1 gathered there
dees not count for much today, but
the mental discipline has been every
thing to me. She taught me to analyze
what came before me and get at the
truth; then to put the various elements
together so as to form a correct judg
ment.
"The man of affairs in after life
requires constructive genius, too, syn
thesis, to use his materials. A mass
of detached facts without organic con
nection is not worth much.
Synthesis Greatest Factor.
"Smith's brain is like a basket of
eggs, no two ideas belong together.
If our graduate had such a brain as
that, he would never have reached a
bank presidency. Synthesis is greater
than analysis. The possibility of
great plans lies in the synthetic imag
ination. The roots of this reach back
to college training. The man of affairs
in his conceit may repudiate his
debt to his alma mater, but he owes it
all the same and can never conceal it.
"In our student days we have im
plicit faith in the college. It is the
best college in the world. Later, when
we achieve some success in the world,
the pride of youth asserts itself and
sniffs at any claim the influence of the
college may have had 011 our destiny.
Then, again, when the afternoon comes
in with broader vision, the faith in
the college is restored, but with a
deeper, more mellow and lasting
quality."
Ton Vcjir Periods.
The speaker traced the career of
the average college graduate after re
ceiving his degree. But a very large
proportion of the lives of graduates
have no direct root in the learning ac
quired in college, he declared. "Man
proposes; God disposes." In periods
of ten years he classified the life of
the university man. Self confidence
and hope rule at thirty-five. At forty
five success is still his own, and not
the product of the college. This age
is the period of action, constant, vigor
ous action. Then conies the summit
of the average man's power, working
power, at fifty-five. Pity the man who
loses his grip at sixty-five; if he falls
the herd will pass over him and he can
never get up.
"Just in proportion as we have ab
sorbed the University spirit it will
come back to help us and comfort us
when the strenuous life is over. The
gifts of our alma mater remain and
we are surprised to find that what we
have lost is nothing to what we have
left. Life is still full to the brim.
Such peace and contentment after the
storms of life the University helps to
bring to its faithful children."
