# GRADUATES ABOUT BAY BANQUET AT ST. FRANCIS
## SEND TELEGRAPHIC GREETINGS TO OTHER CITIES. Stanford Men Gather in all Parts of Globe to do Reverence to Donors. 
### 
Exchanging telegrams of felicitation
with Stanford alumni assembled in 35
cities scattered over the globe, 120
graduates of the university celebrated
Founders' Day, Saturday evening, at a
banquet in the Hotel St. Francis, San
Francisco.
President Jordan was unable to at
tend the banquet because of a slight
indisposition. Mrs. Jordan represented
the president with a message of good
cheer. Faculty members of the alumni
also attended. L. S. Beedy, '98, acted
as toastmaster.
In responding to the toast, "Looking
Backward," J. F. English, '01, told the
alumni that for many years prior to
the death of Mrs. Stanford, the validity
of the great gifts to the university was
in question, and that the first deed of
trust made by Mrs. Stanford was an
illegal document. Mrs. Stanford had
to make a reconveyance of the property
in order that legal requirements might
be satisfied.
Discovery of Errors.
Mr. English credited the discovery
and rectification of the errors to G. E.
Crothers, '95, and T. G. Crothers, his
brother, attorneys. G. E. Crothers
further explained the technical diffi
culty in replying to the toast, "The
University and the Alumni."
Professor P. J. Treat, '10, in speak
ing on "Commencement" made a plea
for a larger number of the alumni to
return to the campus for commence
ment week. Many of those present
promised to come back to renew old
times in May.
Mrs. B. Burkhalter, '98, spoke on
"Dr. Jordan and Stanford," and Pro
fessor E. P. Cubberley also gave a
short talk. J. E. McDowell, '00, ar
ranged the banquet.
The enthusiasm that led Stanford
men and women to assemble in cities
far distant each from each 011 the
globe, among them Honolulu, Manila,
Tokyo, London, New York and Boston,
assures the success of future Found
ers' Day celebrations. The alumni
present at San Francisco, Saturday,
predict that there will be a great many
more celebrations on March 9, 1913.
The telegram sent out from the
Banquet hall in San Francisco was as
follows: Greetings from the San
Francisco banquet to all Stanford
gatherings to-night."
