# OLYMPIC CLUB DEFEATS VARSITY TRACK SQUAD
## WINGED "O" ATHLETES WIN FIRST VICTORY IN YEARS. Injuries to McKee and Hall Mar Meet. —Cardinal Team Shows Improvement. 
### 
For the first time in many seasons,
the Stanford track team, minus some
of its best performers, was forced to
accept defeat at the hands of the Olym
pic Club on Saturday afternoon. Un
fortunate accidents to P. B. McKee,
'14, and E. 15. Hall, '14, marred the
meet. The Cardinal athletes pressed
the visitors at all stages of the com
petition, and the victory of the Winged
"O" was only due to the fact that
the clubmen brought down the
strongest team that has represented
the Olympics against Stanford in
years. The final score of the meet
was: Olympic Club, 67V 2 ; Stanford,
57i/ 2 .
The work of G. L. Horine, '13, in the
high jump; E. B. Bonnett, '13, in the 880;
E. P. Campbell, '13, in the 100 yard
dash; and E. F. Kern, '13, in the hurd
les, was of a high order. Ralph Rose,
the ponderous weight champion, was
the largest point winner of the after
noon, making a total of 13. Stout of
the Olympics made his initial appear
ance as a track runner and took the
two-mile and mile.
Kern gave Morris of the visitors a
close race in the high sticks and
forced him to do :15 3-5 in order to
annex first place. Campbell came to
the front in the century, after McKee
was disabled, and took first place from
Gerhardt in:10 1-5. Morrison held
Snedigar to a tie in the broad jump.
The relay race was omitted from the
list of events. Captain T. L. Coleman,
'12, did not compete.
McKee ami Hall Hurt.
McKee had a safe lead in the hun
dred when he was forced to quit the
track because of a severe strain to
a tendon. The injured runner visited
a San Francisco physician late Satur
day afternoon and an examination re
vealed the fact that the tendon had
been badly torn. Just how "seriously
the injury will affect McKee is not
known at this time.
In clearing the pole vault standard
Hall fell in such a way as to badly
strain his ankle. The injury will prob
ably prove more serious than a break.
Hall suffered intense pain during the
operation of dressing the strain as
his ankle was twisted far out of place.
