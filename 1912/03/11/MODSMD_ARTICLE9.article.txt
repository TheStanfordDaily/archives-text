Three score and ten is the allotted
span of man's life and but few are
allowed by the Fates to exceed this

limit. Fortune has
smiled most kindly,
however, on the Hon-

orable Horace Davis, one of the origin
al ' Trustees of the University ami
speaker at the Founders' Day exercises
on Saturday, who calmly defies Divine
Ordinances and Dr. Osier on the sub
ject of longevity.
In the eighty-one years of his life,
Mr. Davis has witnessed the trans
formation of America physically and
intellectually. Born when the name
of Emerson was as yet comparatively
unknown, when steam was just above
the horizon and electricity was just
below, Mr. Davis has, as a basis for
the delightful observations on the
benefits of college training contained
in his address "An Afternoon View of
College Life," a wealth of experience
enjoyed by few.
It is the Analytic and Synthetic
habits of mind, not the mere mass of
accumulated data, says Mr. Davis, in
substance, that is the real benefit of
college education. When the college
man goes into the world of affairs, if
he possess these qualities he will suc
ceed, no matter what line of work he
pursues.
Not content with delivering one ad
dress on Founders' Day, a task that
would have used the strength of a
much younger man, Mr. Davis hurried
lo San Francisco and was the principal
speaker at the Founders' Day Banquet.
At eighty-one this is rather a remark
able achievement.
