Entry blanks for the seventh annual
Stanford Interscholastic meet are now
in the hinds oL' l T nele Sam preparatory
to being delivered to the track and
tennis captains of the various pre
paratory schools of the Pacific Coast.
April 5 is the latest date on which the
schools may return the blanks. It is
the desire of the Interscholastic Ass
ciation to have them in by April 2.
Each team is allowed to enter three
men in each event. Five runners are
to constitute the relay team. Fifty
cents per man is the sum which has
been fixed as the entrance fee.
The Interscholastic Tennis tourney
to be held on the afternoon of Friday,
April 12, and on the following Satur
day, is to consist of matches in singles
and doubles. Each school may enter
either one or two men in the singles
and two or four men in the doubles,
the team from any one school, how
ever, not to consist of more than four.
Individual Medals.
In addition to the valuable trophies
and cups presented by different indi
viduals and organizations, the Asso
ciation will award gold, silver and
bronze medals to the first, second and
third place men in each event. The
winners of the doubles and singles in
the tennis competition are to receive
gold medals, and the runners-up in
ihese events will receive silver medals.
To the athlete scoring the highest
number of points in track events, ex
clusively, the Quadrangle Club is to
present a handsome trophy, properly
engraved. The upper-class organiza
tion has already made a large appro
priation for the purchase of a suitable
cup to replace the one annually given.
Because of the popularity of the
discus throw this ancient Grecian test
of skill has been added to the regular
list of events and will count in the
final score. With the increasing pop
ularity of the javelin throw the Board
of Governors has decided to add this
to the program. However, the javelin
is not to be counted toward winning
the meet but it is to be in the same
category as the discus luis been pre
vious to this year.
Bpcanse of the pressure of business,
John Elliott, of the Olympic Club, will
be unable to accept the invitation of
the Association to act as referee. In
his stead several names of well known
track and field experts of the vicinity
are under consideration.
