Student control quite naturally is
on everyone's tongue. In the general

discussion, important points
at present imperfectly under-

stood by the public are bound
to become distorted, and conclusions
will be drawn from premises wholly
mistaken in fact.
Stanford admittedly is unlike other
universities in many of the problems
which confront student self-govern
ment. Its location and the fact that
the majority of the students live on
the campus give rise to questions
which never seriously bother a univer
sity situated in the vicinity of a large
city.
It is well to consider the proposed
system carefully in all its aspects and
bearings on the life of the undergrad
uate; but before decided opinions are
formed by anyone upon the merits or
demerits of student self-government,
so generously proposed by the faculty,
it would be wise to wait until the plan
is carefully explained.
The meeting of the men students of
the University called for Thursday
morning by Student Body President
K. L. Schaupp, will be devoted ex
clusively to the discussion of the new
system of government. At this meet
ing a detailed statement of the plan
will be laid before the men by Schaupp
and Student Adviser Roth and all of
its discernible advantages and defects
frankly discussed.
Our advice is not to form your
opinion until you hear the discussion
at the mass-meeting.
