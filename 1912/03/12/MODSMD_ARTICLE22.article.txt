# V.A. SHELDON, '15, WINS FAST HANDBALL MATCH.
## Defeats H.J. Kearns, '14, and E.W. Pugh, '11.â€”To Meet E.T. Dutton, '15, Next. 
### 
V. A. Sheldon, '15, won his way into
the semi-final round of the handball
tournament for the Storey Belt by
scoring two victories, winning from
H. J. Kearns, '14, and E. W. Pugh, '11.
Kearns defaulted to Sheldon in the
first round, and the Freshman defeated
Pugh in two straight games in their
match in the next round, the score
being 21-17 and 21-10.
Although but two games were taken
to decide the Pugh-Sheldon match,
they were by no means one-sided.
The winner had to extend himself in
order to come out on top in both con
tests, the scores showing the closeness
of the play. Neither players eased up
during the entire match, making it
one of the fastest that has been seen
during the present tournament.
Sheldon will meet E. T. Dutton, '15,
to-morrow afternoon at 2:30 in the
semi-finals. The winner will then
play C. G. Duffin, '12, who won the
lower division, for the championship
of the University and the Storey
trophy.
