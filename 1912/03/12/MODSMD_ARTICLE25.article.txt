# MUSICAL CLUBS TO GIVE CONCERT ON APRIL 26.
## 
### 
Stanford's Combined Musical Clubs
are planning to give a concert, in the
Assembly Hall on April 26. No definite
program has been decided upon as yet,
but it will probably consist largely of
chorus numbers by the C.lee and
Mandolin Clubs.
A small admission will probably lie
charged to cover the expenses incurred
in giving the evening's entertainment.
Both of the clubs are meeting regu
larly for practice, and are working up
some exceptionally fine numbers.
