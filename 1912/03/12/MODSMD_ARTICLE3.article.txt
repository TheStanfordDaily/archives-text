# ADVANCE SEAT SALE LARGEST ON RECORD
## BIN AUDIENCE IS ASSURED FOR SOPHOMORE PLAY. Special Scenery Now Being Prepared For Acts Laid in England and India. Miss C. Green us Mrs. Glibb

With an advance sale of seats
which excels any previous opening day
for a Sophomore play at Stanford,
"Christopher, Jr.," the 1914 produc
tion booked for Friday evening will
probably be staged before the largest
assemblage that has yet witnessed a
show presented by the second-year
students.
For the pasl week a corps of artists
have been engaged in fashioning the
scenery which is to be displayed in
the four acts. J. It. Hem an, '12, has
been supervising the work. Diverse
settings, ranging from the barrenness
and simplicity of the London tenement
to the elegance of the ballroom of the
Ibitish nobility where all England has
gathered her beauty and her chivalrv,
have required the painters to labor
with all the skill of their art in order
to meet the requirements of complete
ness. Bombay, the residence of
wealthy Rajahs, in all its Oriental
splendor and richness, is pictured in
every detail. The students of Sanskrit
and Indian Philosophy will rind them
selves transported to the very door
steps of the mystic Indians. Even
the lumbering beasts of burden of
India have been brought, in from their
labor to complete the scone and make
transportation easy.
Nightly rehearsals are the order of
of the final week of Coach Mathieu's
course of instruction. Mastery in
every detail of acting is the standard
placed before the cast, and the finer
touches of "business" form the bulk
of the work.
