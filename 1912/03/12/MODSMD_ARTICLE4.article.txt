# TRYOUTS FOR MARATHON TEAMS WILL BE HELD
## CLASSES TO ENTER BEST MEN IN TRACK CARNIVAL. Quadrangle Club Makes Plans for Annual Event.â€”Will be Held on March 23. 
### 
The inability of the Quadrangle Club
to offer its annual interclass Marathon
Race as an attraction of Junior Week
will make it necessary for the various
classes to begin their preparations for
the big track carnival earlier than
usual this year. The Marathon will be
held on Saturday afternoon March 23
and will be the only athletic attraction
on the campus that day.
Each class will enter a team of 24
men, each member of which will run
a quarter of a mile. Every class, in
cluding the Holdovers, will try for
the championship, the winner of which
will be presented with the Quadrangle
Club cup. The Holdovers promise to
carry out the usual burlesque and
stunt program which will be even a
greater attraction than have the antics
of the Old Timers in the past. A. E.
Roth will have charge of them and is
to call a meeting shortly for a full
consideration of just what will be
"slipped over" on an indulgent public.
Coleman to Lead 1912.
President 11. H. Seward of the Seni
or class has appointed T. L. Coleman
as captain of the 1912 team and under
his direction try-outs will be held
shortly. President P. E. Spalding of
the Freshman class states that fully
forty first year men have already signi
fied their intention of trying out for
the 24 places on the baby team. Try
outs will probably be announced for
the first of the week.
Although plenty of amusement and
sport, aside from Holdover stunts in
the Marathon will be furnished, the
Quadrangle Club is not yet ready to
disclose the nature of what will be
offered. Everything from obstacle
races to chasing greased pigs is hinted
at.
Last year's race saw some of the best
time of the year and it is hoped by the
Quadrangle Club that some finds may
be made among the men who have
never been out for track. It is the
purpose of the annual Marathon to
bring out men who have never had
a pair of spikes on before.
Any further information desired may
be secured from the Marathon com
mitte composed of F. S. Guerena, '11,
H. C. Nelson, '10, T. L. Coleman, '12,
and L. L. Hill, '11, chairman.
