# Mass-Meeting.
## 
### 
To-morrow morning the men of Stan
ford University will be given an op
portunity to become thoroughly con-

versant with the sub
ject of student control.
There is undoubtedly

some opposition to the self-government
movement, but we are thoroughly con
vinced that this opposition arises al
most wholly from a misapprehension
of facts.
If we are right in this supposition
the meeting to-morrow will do much
towards clearing the air and allowing
a more intelligent estimate of the
worth of the plan. What is chiefly de
sired is a frank, straightforward dis
cussion in which every doubt as to the
rules to be enforced and the mechan
ism of government will be dissipated.
Express your opinion freely to-mor
row, stand on your own feet and en
deavor to leave prejudice aside in
reaching a conclusion.
A California Tlew.
In comment upon the proposal to
grant student control at Stanford, the
"Daily Californian" has the following
to say:
"California's motives in wishing suc
cess to the plan are not entirely un
selfish. At some time in the near fu
ture, intercollegiate athletic relations
between the two universities will have
to take some definite form. The ques
tions of freshman competition on Var
sity teams and freshman intercollegi
ate contests must be finally decided
before noxt fall. We fee] that Califor
nia, having student control, could deal
more effectively with Stanford if the
latter had student control of all mat
tors pertaining to student affairs and
activities. Two intercollegiate agree
ment committees with power to act
and authority from the student bodies
which they represent, would be able
far more easily to settle difficulties

and disagreements amicably. We be
lieve that this would minimize friction
and result to the benefit of both uni
versities."
A casual reading of this statement
is sufficient to show how widely di
vergent are the points of view of the
two universities. With pleasure we
receive the well-wishes of the"Daily
Californian" upon the step we are
about to take in student self-govern
ment, but we would our friends across
the bay had a clearer understanding
of the situation.
The student self-government pro
posed at Stanford has nothing what
ever to do with the regulation of ath
letics or of scholarship. Very appar
ently student self-government has
much to do with these topics at Cali
fornia. The regulation prohibiting
Freshman Intercollegiate games is a
rule made by the faculty of Stanford
University, and however much we
might desire to see these games re
instated it is hardly within the prov
ince of the uudergraduates of Califor
nia to demand such a change from the
faculty of Stanford University.
As to the suggestion that "At some
time in the near future, intercollegiate
athletic relations between the two uni
versities will have to talis some defin
ite form," we certainly agree. Along
certain lines the intercollegiate agree
ment is now very definite, but along
the lines of scholarship it is lament
ably lax. Probably it would be a good
thing to have a common scholarship
requirement for participation in ath
letics one of the first things definitely
formulated.

to say:
"California's motives in wishing suc
cess to the plan are not entirely un
selfish. At some time in the near fu
ture, intercollegiate athletic relations
between the two universities will have
to take some definite form. The ques
tions of freshman competition on Var
sity teams and freshman intercollegi
ate contests must be finally decided
before noxt fall. We fee] that Califor
nia, having student control, could deal
more effectively with Stanford if the
latter had student control of all mat
tors pertaining to student affairs and
activities. Two intercollegiate agree
ment committees with power to act
and authority from the student bodies
which they represent, would be able
far more easily to settle difficulties

and disagreements amicably. We be
lieve that this would minimize friction
and result to the benefit of both uni
versities."
A casual reading of this statement
is sufficient to show how widely di
vergent are the points of view of the
two universities. With pleasure we
receive the well-wishes of the"Daily
Californian" upon the step we are
about to take in student self-govern
ment, but we would our friends across
the bay had a clearer understanding
of the situation.
The student self-government pro
posed at Stanford has nothing what
ever to do with the regulation of ath
letics or of scholarship. Very appar
ently student self-government has
much to do with these topics at Cali
fornia. The regulation prohibiting
Freshman Intercollegiate games is a
rule made by the faculty of Stanford
University, and however much we
might desire to see these games re
instated it is hardly within the prov
ince of the uudergraduates of Califor
nia to demand such a change from the
faculty of Stanford University.
As to the suggestion that "At some
time in the near future, intercollegiate
athletic relations between the two uni
versities will have to talis some defin
ite form," we certainly agree. Along
certain lines the intercollegiate agree
ment is now very definite, but along
the lines of scholarship it is lament
ably lax. Probably it would be a good
thing to have a common scholarship
requirement for participation in ath
letics one of the first things definitely
formulated.
To-morrow morning the men of Stan
ford University will be given an op
portunity to become thoroughly con-

versant with the sub
ject of student control.
There is undoubtedly

some opposition to the self-government
movement, but we are thoroughly con
vinced that this opposition arises al
most wholly from a misapprehension
of facts.
If we are right in this supposition
the meeting to-morrow will do much
towards clearing the air and allowing
a more intelligent estimate of the
worth of the plan. What is chiefly de
sired is a frank, straightforward dis
cussion in which every doubt as to the
rules to be enforced and the mechan
ism of government will be dissipated.
Express your opinion freely to-mor
row, stand on your own feet and en
deavor to leave prejudice aside in
reaching a conclusion.
