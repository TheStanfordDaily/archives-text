To-morrow at eleven-fifteen, the men.
of the University will meet in the As
sembly Hall to discuss Student Con
trol.
This meeting will be most important
of the year r for at that time we wish
to have a thorough dissuasion of the
problem before us and it iis hoped that
every man of the Student Body will be
there, regardless of whether or not he
has paid his assessment.
The attendance will be limited to
men students only, so that a frank
and open discussion may follow with
out fear of possible criticism from the
faculty or the women.
We wish to have every possible ob
jection raised and considered, because
each man should have a complete un
derstanding of the matter in hand. It
is hoped that no one win consider the
question from any standpoint except
as he sees it —be that point for or
against.
Serious thoughts and frankness
should be the keynote of the meeting,
for we must either have a big majority
or give up any plan of student govern
ment.
The problem is the biggest of this
college generation—therefore we must
be deliberate and interested. Let every
man be at least ready to listen and
judge—if he is not desirous of enter
ing the discussion himself. But. above
all, let him be present.
