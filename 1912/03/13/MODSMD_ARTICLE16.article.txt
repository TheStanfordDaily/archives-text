# CREW CAPTAINS CHOSEN FOR INTERCLASS RACE.
## Partridge, Beal and Clover Elected to Lead Fours on Junior Day. 
### 
Class crew captains for the inter
class races on Junior Day were elected
at the boat house this morning. J. F.
Partridge was the choice of the Se
niors. He is one of the best oarsmen
ever turned out at Stanford. He
stroked his Freshman crew, and rowed
six in the Varsity race against Wash
ington that spring. In his Sophomore
year Partridge pulled the stroke oar
against California, and he is the lead
ing candidate for that position this
season.
The Juniors selected C. H. Deal as
their leader. Deal stroked his Fresh
man four against California, and last
spring was a Varsity substitute.
P. P. Clover was elected Sophomore
captain. He rowed number four in the
Freshman race with California last
spring, and is out for the Varsity this
year.
No Freshman captain was chosen as
it is still a little early to pick a man
who is sure to make the four. If any
leader is chosen he will probably be
appointed when the four is selected.
The captains elect have the power to
name the men who will row in the
shells on Junior Day.
