# INTERESTING EVENTS OF PLAY ARE LAID IN INDIA
## LINES AND BUSINESS OF SOPHOMORE COMEDY ARE NOW PERFECT AND READY FOR FRIDAY EVENING'S PRODUCTION. 
### 
Late advices from India state that
Mr. and Mrs. Glibb, the self-styled
philanthropists, have arrived in Bom
bay, and will be the guests of Christo
pher Jedbury, Jr., Providence and
Christopher permitting.
Mrs. Glibb is President of the Anti-
Pitch-and-Toss society, and Mr. Glibb
—well, he is just Mrs. Glibb's husband.
Scientific observations also indicate
the existence of curious meteorological
conditions throughout India. The ar
rival of Mrs. Glibb is partly to blame,
but the remarkable sensations felt by
the male inhabitants in the region of
the heart are almost inexplicable, al
though, indeed, the presence of Dora
Uedway and Nellie Jedbury in Bombay
at one and the same time is a signifi
cant coincidence.
The news budget from this Eastern
portion of that Empire where the sun
and the hen never set tells of the ar

i rival of the rising young London bar
rister, T. O. M. Bellaby. He has come
to straighten a marital mixup begun
when a young man well known in the
most exclusive circles of this city
awoke in his stateroom on board ship
for Trinidad to find himself confronted
by a sort of a bifurcated jacket con
nected by a trellis-work down the back.
Christopher, ,lr„ in Evidence.
Another spicy note from the Indian
metropolis states that the sins of
Simpson, the wily and unscrupulous
manager of the great Jedbury firm,
have at last found him out. Bright
young Christopher Jedbury, Jr., serv
ing in Simpson's office under an as
sumed name is his discoverer.
These persons will all make their
initial how to a Stanford audience Fri
day evening, when the Sophomore
Comedy, "Christopher, Jr.," is pro
duced.
