"Shell smashed. Collecting insur
ance. Second boat ready in August.—
Sim."
This cable despatch received last
evening from the famous boat builder
at Putney in England, finally settled
the mystery of the missing shell. For
seven weeks, unknown to the Univer
sity public at large, Graduate Manager
D. YV. Burbank, Student Body President
K. L. Schaupp, '12, and Crew Captain
R. H. Seward, '12, have centered every
effort on finding the missing boat. It
had as effectually disappeared as if
it had been spirited away by some
fairy.
During the Christmas vacation Bur
bank received notice from the ware
house people in San Francisco that the
shell had arrived. The bill of lading
was forwarded to him and on it he
paid duty for the entrance of the boat
to this country. When the University
opened for the second semester, it
was announced that the shell had ar
rived. To the best knowledge and abil
ity of all those concerned it had.
Warehouse Company Mistaken.
It was decided to bring it down to
Redwood for a christening at the
earliest opportunity. With this object
in mind the warehouse people in San
Francisco were communicated with.
They announced that the crate con
taining the boat was stored away in
their building behind a mass of boxes,
and that it would take a week to re
move them so that the shell could be
taken out. A week later the negotia
tions were renewed. To the dismay
and consternation of those who were
cognizant of the facts, the warehouse
company announced that the shell had
never been in their keeping and that
what they had mistaken for it was
another large crate. Immediately ne
gotiations were opened with Sim to
discover the whereabouts of the boat.
