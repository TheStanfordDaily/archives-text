# NEW SHELL FOR CREW SMASHED TO KINDLING
## CABLE FROM BUILDER TELLS OF LOSS OF BOAT. Mystery of Disappearance is Cleared Up.—Sim Starts Work on Another. 
### 
"Shell smashed. Collecting insur
ance. Second boat ready in August.—
Sim."
This cable despatch received last
evening from the famous boat builder
at Putney in England, finally settled
the mystery of the missing shell. For
seven weeks, unknown to the Univer
sity public at large, Graduate Manager
D. YV. Burbank, Student Body President
K. L. Schaupp, '12, and Crew Captain
R. H. Seward, '12, have centered every
effort on finding the missing boat. It
had as effectually disappeared as if
it had been spirited away by some
fairy.
During the Christmas vacation Bur
bank received notice from the ware
house people in San Francisco that the
shell had arrived. The bill of lading
was forwarded to him and on it he
paid duty for the entrance of the boat
to this country. When the University
opened for the second semester, it
was announced that the shell had ar
rived. To the best knowledge and abil
ity of all those concerned it had.
Warehouse Company Mistaken.
It was decided to bring it down to
Redwood for a christening at the
earliest opportunity. With this object
in mind the warehouse people in San
Francisco were communicated with.
They announced that the crate con
taining the boat was stored away in
their building behind a mass of boxes,
and that it would take a week to re
move them so that the shell could be
taken out. A week later the negotia
tions were renewed. To the dismay
and consternation of those who were
cognizant of the facts, the warehouse
company announced that the shell had
never been in their keeping and that
what they had mistaken for it was
another large crate. Immediately ne
gotiations were opened with Sim to
discover the whereabouts of the boat.
It was found that the shell had been
shipped early in December from Eng
land on the ship Catalina bound for
Tehauntepec. The plan was to ship
it across the isthmus by railroad and
place it again on board a vessel of the
Pacific Mail Steamship company for
San Francisco. At which point of tjfe
jounrney the shell was smashed is not
known, but it seems probable that it
was aboard the Catalina. As soon as
it was found that the boat had dis
appeared, wires were sent to the Te
hauntepec railroad company asking
for information in regard to it. The
railroad people replied that they had
never received the boat from the orig
inal consignees. Communication could
not be established with the Catalina,
so it remained to hear from Sim. Last
evening the cable quoted above arrived.
Use Old Shell.
Hoping against hope, the crew men
of the University who knew of the dis
appearance, believed to the last that
the boat would be found in time for the
race. Last night's news shattered the
la?t shred of hope, and with it destroy
ed all ideas of a second Varsity crew
for this season.
The loss of the shell will mean that
the Varsity will have to row again this
year in the boat that has been used in
every Intercollegiate regatta except
one with California, and in' whjch the
first eight oared race on the Pacific
Coast was rowed. The craft itj, still
one of the fastest and best on the
Coast, but it has seen hard usage. It
originally came around the Horn and
has been shipped to Seattle twice. Ac
cording to the best information that
can be obtained it seems that there is
still one more victory left in the old
boat.

opened for the second semester, it
was announced that the shell had ar
rived. To the best knowledge and abil
ity of all those concerned it had.
Warehouse Company Mistaken.
It was decided to bring it down to
Redwood for a christening at the
earliest opportunity. With this object
in mind the warehouse people in San
Francisco were communicated with.
They announced that the crate con
taining the boat was stored away in
their building behind a mass of boxes,
and that it would take a week to re
move them so that the shell could be
taken out. A week later the negotia
tions were renewed. To the dismay
and consternation of those who were
cognizant of the facts, the warehouse
company announced that the shell had
never been in their keeping and that
what they had mistaken for it was
another large crate. Immediately ne
gotiations were opened with Sim to
discover the whereabouts of the boat.
It was found that the shell had been
shipped early in December from Eng
land on the ship Catalina bound for
Tehauntepec. The plan was to ship
it across the isthmus by railroad and
place it again on board a vessel of the
Pacific Mail Steamship company for
San Francisco. At which point of tjfe
jounrney the shell was smashed is not
known, but it seems probable that it
was aboard the Catalina. As soon as
it was found that the boat had dis
appeared, wires were sent to the Te
hauntepec railroad company asking
for information in regard to it. The
railroad people replied that they had
never received the boat from the orig
inal consignees. Communication could
not be established with the Catalina,
so it remained to hear from Sim. Last
evening the cable quoted above arrived.
Use Old Shell.
Hoping against hope, the crew men
of the University who knew of the dis
appearance, believed to the last that
the boat would be found in time for the
race. Last night's news shattered the
la?t shred of hope, and with it destroy
ed all ideas of a second Varsity crew
for this season.
The loss of the shell will mean that
the Varsity will have to row again this
year in the boat that has been used in
every Intercollegiate regatta except
one with California, and in' whjch the
first eight oared race on the Pacific
Coast was rowed. The craft itj, still
one of the fastest and best on the
Coast, but it has seen hard usage. It
originally came around the Horn and
has been shipped to Seattle twice. Ac
cording to the best information that
can be obtained it seems that there is
still one more victory left in the old
boat.
"Shell smashed. Collecting insur
ance. Second boat ready in August.—
Sim."
This cable despatch received last
evening from the famous boat builder
at Putney in England, finally settled
the mystery of the missing shell. For
seven weeks, unknown to the Univer
sity public at large, Graduate Manager
D. YV. Burbank, Student Body President
K. L. Schaupp, '12, and Crew Captain
R. H. Seward, '12, have centered every
effort on finding the missing boat. It
had as effectually disappeared as if
it had been spirited away by some
fairy.
During the Christmas vacation Bur
bank received notice from the ware
house people in San Francisco that the
shell had arrived. The bill of lading
was forwarded to him and on it he
paid duty for the entrance of the boat
to this country. When the University
