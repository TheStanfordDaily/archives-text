# KERRIGAN SELECTED FOR INTERSCHOLASTIC MEET
## TRACK AUTHORITY WILL ACT AS STARTER IN APRIL. Former Athlete to be an Official at Annual Preparatory School Competition. 
### 
Bert Kerrigan of San Francisco, one
of the best known track and field ex
perts in the country, has been selected
by the Stanford Interscholastic board
of governors to act as starter at the
big preparatory school meet on April
13. In choosing Kerrigan for the
starter's position the association has
made one of the best selections pos
sible. The San Franciscan is a mem
ber of the Olympic Club and has been
interested in the sport for many years.
Kerrigan was formerly an athlete
of note, being a record holder in the
high jump. The six foot mark was
cleared consistently by him in the
days when this leap was rarely reach
ed. He resided in Portland for some
time and was the mainstay of the
Multnomah athletic club of that city.
It was on his attestation that the
world's record of 9 3-5 seconds in the
century made by Dan Kelly in the
Oregon metropolis received recogni
tion at the hands of the athletic au
thorities of the country. Kerrigan has
lons been an active worker for clean
sportsmanship in amateur athletics.
With the position of starter settled,
the Board of Governors is now ar
ranging with other track authorities
around the bay to act in official ca
pacities at the meet. Tt is the idea of
the Board to get the best possible
talent so as to add to the success of
this seventh annual competition.
Secretary A. W. Ambrose, '13, is to
make a trip to San Francisco Saturday,
for the purpose of contracting for the
many medals which are to be awarded
to the winners in the various events
next month. Shreve & Company were
the successful bidders last year and
it is likely that this Arm will again
fashion the prizes for the successful
athletes.
