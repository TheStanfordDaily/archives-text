# Self-Government.

Student control as explained this
morning appears to be the most mo
mentous proposal ever made to the

Stanford under
graduate body. It
will engender some

ill feeling, no doubt, in its operation,
and in time new difficulties will re
veal themselves, but withal the stu
dents will be in control and upon them
alone will the success or failure of the
system depend.
The responsibility which must be
assumed to make the new system a
success is probably among its most
beneficial results. The four years a
man spends in college hardly appear
to be years added to his youth and ir
responsibility, despite many surface
indications to the contrary. Rather
are they years when the undergrad
uate should be assuming those re
sponsibilities which are to be his for
the remainder of his life. There
would appear to be no better educa
tion to be gained in college than
education in the art of self-govern
ment.
