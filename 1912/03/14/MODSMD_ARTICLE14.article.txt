# HANDBALL SEMI-FINALS WON BY V. A. SHELDON.
## Victor to Contest in Closing Round With Duffin for Storey Belt. 
### 
By defeating E. T. Dutton, '13, in
the semi-final round of the handball
tournament, V. A. Sheldon, '15, won
the right to meet C. G. Duffin, '12, for
the Storey Belt. Sheldon won in two
straight games, the scores being 21-11
and 21-18.
In the second game, by far the best
and fastest of the two, Dutton led
almost up to the end. With the score
IS to 14 against him, Sheldon braced
up and by excellent playing ran out
without allowing his opponent another
point.
The match was featured by constant
and effective "killing" by both players.
Sheldon's work in this line was es
pecially good.
In the final round Sheldon will meet
Duffin. the winner of the semi-finals
in the lower division. This contest
should be one of the best of the tourna
ment, as both men have proven their
superiority over the other players.
No challenge match will be played,
since J. H. Wiggins, '10, last year's
victor, is not in college. The win
ner of the final round will, therefore,
be University champion and the pos
sessor of the Storey Belt for the en
suing year.
