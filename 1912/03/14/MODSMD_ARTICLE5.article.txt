# STUDENT CONTROL ASSUMES TANGIBLE FORM AT ASSEMBLY
## ROTH AND SCHAUPP CLEAR UP MANY UNCERTAIN POINTS FOR MEN AT BIG MEETING. DISCUSSION IS FAVORABLE. 
### 
Every argument advanced against
Student Control for Men at Stanford
apparently was satisfactorily answered
today when the male student body as
sembled and discussed the problem.
In fact, it is not presumptious to say
that arguments against it did not en
ter largely in the discussion. Once
the proposed plan concisely was put
before the student body by President
K. L. Schaupp, '12, and Student Ad
viser Roth, the discussion resolved
into the explanation of details of op
eration in answer to queries from the
floor.
Probably the largest single assem
blage of Stanford men in the history of
the institution heard the discussion.
Very few men were absent from the
meeting.
In introducing the subject of Stu
dent Control for Men, President K. L.
Schaupp said:
"We do not want student control
under conditions not evident to every
man present. That is why we have
called this meeting, and I want every
man present to speak his mind."
Rotli Explains IMan.
Student Adviser Roth was called to
the platform to set forth the opera
tion of the plan offered by the faculty.
He said:
"When the trouble between the fa
culty and the students arose four
years ago, we wanted some form of
student control. Two years ago it was
offered to us, but the men did not want
the kind of control offered. I believe
the plan now presented by the faculty
includes everything we could ask.
I am convinced that they are acting
in good faith.
"Under the proposed plan the Facul
ty Student Affairs Committee will not
go out of existence. It was brought
into life by the articles of organiza
tion of the board of trustees and can
not go out of existence any more than
the Athletic Committee.
"Under the proposed plan, the duties
of the Committee will become purely
nominal. It will not in any sense in
terfere with the decisions of the board
of student control.
"The student committee will make
a report once each year to the
Faculty Student Affairs committee,
which, through the president, will re
port to the hoard of trustees.
Will Not Carry Out Rules.
"The Advisory Committee of the Uni
versity Conference, which will assume
the duties, is not to be in any sense
a committee to carry out the rules of

the Student Affairs Committee," ex
plained Student Adviser Roth. "If
it were to be so, 1 would be against
such student control.
"The duties of the Student Affairs
Committee, as outlined in the regula
tions recently published in the Daily
Palo Alto, will be assumed by the Ad
visory Committee. The interpretation
of the elastic provisions of the last
clause will devolve upon the student
committee.
"Such questions as to whether the
Senior Ball would be held in the Ven
dome in San Jose, whether a vaca
tion dance should be held in Encina,
and how many dramatic performances
a student might take part in in the
future, all would be decided by the
student committee. Matters of discip
line would be treated as well.
Policy of Hands Off.
"In case the faculty do not agree
with the decisions of the student com
mittee, we have their word that they
will keep their hands off. They will
not interfere with our decisions. In
the event that after trial the decisions
of the students continued to disagree
with the opinions of the facutly, they
might decide student control a failure.
But the Faculty Student Affairs Com
mittee has told me that our decision
on the last case would stand absolute
ly, in such event.
"The plan that calls for the election
of five members of the student body
to take places in the University Con
ference, irrespective of departments,
is to prevent good men being shut out
of the Conference by the present plan
of naming the members," concluded
Roth.
President Schaupp then took up a
discussion of the problems involved.
"If the plan offered by the faculty
were not complete control, I would
have nothing to do with it." said Presi
dent Schaupp. "If the action of the
student committee were to be reversed
or openly criticized it would never
meet with my approval.
" 'We have enough confidence in
Stanford men today to leave them to
care for their own problems' is the
way members of the faculty put the
problem to me.

"President Jordan said: 'Today the
spirit of the student body is to do the
right thing. lam happy over the con

you take it.'
"If we don't take it now, and trouble
