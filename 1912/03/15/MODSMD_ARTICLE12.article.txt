# Self-Government and Lies.

### 
Qn Wednesday the men of Stanford
will have an opportunity to draw the

sting from one of
the commonest as
persions against
the good name of
the University. It

has been said, with little regard for
the truth, and a less understanding of
the situation at Stanford, that the stu
dents have absolutely no voice in the
direction of their own affairs; that
they are treated like the inmates of
a reform school and obliged to con
form their every act to a set of faculty
made regulations.
Apparently some of our compassion
ate critics have conceived the idea that
the Stanford faculty looks on the
student body as being a curious inter
mixture of felons and fools. Indeed,
one estimable gentleman, after suffer
ing the pains of parturition gave birth
to the brilliant idea that' Stanford is
a "faculty ridden institution."
The utter idiocy of such a statement
is only excuseable on the ground that
it originated at the institution across
the bay, where a rather smug self
sufficiency and egoism give rise to
strange hallucinations. To the Cali
fornian "All the world is queer save
me and thee, and even thou art a little
queer."
The falseness of such comments re
garding the existing conditions at
Stanford in no wise lessens their

evil effect. Much injury has been
done by these mis-statements and a
vote for student self-government on
Wednesday is the surest and most
effective way of nailing these lies and
nullifying their evil consequences.
