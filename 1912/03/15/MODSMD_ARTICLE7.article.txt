## G.C. DUFFIN, '12, LOSES IX TWO STRAIGHT GAMES. Freshman Wins Trophy For First Time.â€”Final Scores 21-18 and 21-16. 
### 
V. A. Sheldon, '15, won the Storey
Belt for the handball championship
of the University this afternoon on the
Encina court. His opponent, C. G.
Duffin, '12, was defeated only after
the two hardest fought games of the
season. The match was the best of the
tournament and the result was in
doubt until the last point had been
made. Sheldon won by scores of 21-18
and 21-16.
Duffin led in the first game by the
score of 14 to 2, when Sheldon, in one
"hand-in," by effective killing, ran
fifteen points. This long run virtually
won the match for Sheldon, as it put
him in a position to ga*in the first
victory.
In the second, Duffin got off with
the lead, but the Freshman overtook
him and was never headed afterwards.
In the first game both men "killed"
almost exclusively, but in the second
they changed their style and played
the ball well back into the court.
This is the twelfth time the belt
has been contested, ft was presented
in 1901 by T. A. Storey, then the head
of Encina gymnasium and now Profes
sor of Physical Education and direc
tor of the gymnasium at the College
of the City of New York. The Belt,
which is hand carved and mounted
with silver buckles and plates, is not
the original trophy presented by Pro
fessor Storey. The former belt was
stolen from the 1906 champion, who
replaced it by the trophy which Shel
don won this afternoon.
Sheldon is the first Freshman to win
the trophy. lie also is the tennis
champion of the University. Sheldon
is a member of the Chi Psi fraternity.
