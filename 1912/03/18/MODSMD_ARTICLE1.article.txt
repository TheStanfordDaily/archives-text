# ENTHUSIASTIC WELCOME FOR SOPHOMORE COMEDY
## CHOICE OF PLAY AND ACTING IS ABOVE STANDARD. Uproarious Scenes Presented With Sure Touch, Dramatic Honors Going to Miss Bullard. By P. Eliel, '13. 
### 
There have been Sophomore plays
and Sophomore plays. Most of tliein
have just been Sophomore plays and
nothing more. Christopher, Jr., was
the exception which proved the rule
that all Sophomore plays do not of ne
cessity have to be poor. For the 1914
performance of Friday evening was
good. It was good from the first en
trance of Job, the pattern of whose
pants might have been cut out on a
"circular saw,'' to the final embrace
which should close all good comedies.
Audiences, as a rule, go to Sopho
more plays with one of two things in
mind: they either expect to be bored,
or else they expect to find all the com
edy in the mistakes and abortive at
tempts of the amateur players. Those
who witnessed Christopher, Jr., and
who went to the Assembly Hall with
either of these pre-performance opin
ions, were either grieviously disap
pointed, or delightfully surprised.
Neither of these bromidic attitudes
could be assumed by even the most
blase Stanford theatregoer. The lines
were well given as a whole; the act
ing was above the standard usually set
by Sophomore comedies; the details of
the performance had been admirably
worked out; and finally, the lines were
clever, the situations uproarious. And
this brings us down to the play.
Play Well Selected.
The type of plays usually chosen to
be presented by the Sophomore class
has always been the one insoluble mys
tery connected with Stanford theatri
cals. One year we have a bloody melo
drama with shootings, interspersed
with telegraph messages and long
"r's." Next we must suffer through
three acts of outworn bosh in the dis
guise of a comedy drama. If 1914 had
not changed for the better we might
well expect to see 1915 giving us a
sophomoric version of "Ghosts" next
year. But 1914 did change for the bet
ter. and they gave us Christopher, Jr..
It is the sort of play that is admira
bly fitted to Sophomore productions.
Villainy became in Christopher, Jr.
merely a sort of dignified seasoning.
It was not an obsession. May all
Sophomore classes in future pattern
their choice after that of 1914. It
might be imagined from this that we
thought Christopher, Jr. to be the best
comedy ever written. Far from it. It
had the saving grace of being humor
ous, but there was an unfortunate
superabundance of asides and other
outworn and overused dramatic con
trivances. Soliloquies are not as a
rule indulged in by sane people. Poor
Christopher had t'> carry the intrica
cies nf situation in many a scenn on
hi* nwi shoulders through lengthy
explanatory soliloquies. There are
better comedies than Christopher, Jr..
but it. represents the general type
which should be sought after by fu
ture classes.
Acting honors for the evening fall on
