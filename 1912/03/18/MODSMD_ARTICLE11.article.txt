# Dr. Gardner at the Chapel Sunday.
## 
### 
Dr. D. C. Gardner preached a very
impressive sermon at the University
Chapel yesterday morning. Tie urged
the necessity of a purpose in life for
each one of us. His idea is that while
we can be too serious in some things
the tendency nowadays is in quite the
opposite direction and that we treat
things too casually.
Miss A. Maloney, '12. sang a very
beautiful solo.
