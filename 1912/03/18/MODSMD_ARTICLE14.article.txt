Considerable discussion has taken
place within the last few days regard
ing details of the proposed student

self-government. The gen
eral plan outlined on Thurs
day meets with the approv-

al of practically everyone, but con
tinual discussion has apparently cloud
ed the main issue and brought sub
sidiary points to the fore.
We cannot ask the Faculty to grant
us Student Control for any definite
period. This would be taking out of
their hands the right to again assume
the reins if moral standards were
appreciably lowered by the regime of
self-government. It seems ridiculous
to suppose that anyone would disagree
with the statement that the faculty
have the right to take back the dis
ciplinary functions if student control
is a failure and disappoints our anti
cipations.
However, all may rest assured that
the new plan will.not be lightly weigh
ed and cast aside. The Advisory Com
mittee and the Conference have the
word of the faculty that self-govern
ment will be given a fair and impar
tial trial. The editor of the Daily Palo
Alto has himself received a similar
assurance and feels that if the sys
tem ever is withdrawn from the stu
dents it will be only after such a show
ing that every reasonable person will
assent to the proposition that Stanford
students are unfit for the respon
sibilities placed upon them.
As to Faculty interference in deci
sions of the Advisory Board, we be
lieved that this was sufficiently dis
posed of at the mass-meeeting. Tf
there is one thing In the whole plan
of which we are certain, it is that the
decisions of the Advisory Committee
in specific cases will be final.
The communications published in
to-night's paper show the serious con

sideration being giveu to student con
trol. These letters view tl»e situation
from different angles and are well
worth reading. The question of space
prevents ns from discussing the vary
ing aspects of the situation brought
out by the contributors.
