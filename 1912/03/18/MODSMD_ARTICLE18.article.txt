Editor Daily Palo Alto:
I wish to present for the considera
tion of the men of the university an
aspect of the student control question
which, I think, escaped consideration
last Thursday, and which I at that time
felt unable to present properly.
It was made clear that the proposi
tion offered by the faculty is one of ab
solute student control, limited only by
a few general fundamental rules of the
board of trustees, and it was also made
clear that the faculty is acting in en
tire good faith, and indeed would be
greatly pleased if the students could
relieve them of this great problem.
But is was not made clear that, in in
terpreting the fundamental rules, and
applying them to specific cases as they
arise that the student committee will
necessarily have to follow closely the
precedents of the faculty committee in
judging what acts cannot be tolerated,
although it would not have to follov.
precedents for punishment of those
acts. To illustrate what I mean: I feel
absolutely certain that in dealing with
the liquor question the student com
mittee would, necessarily, have to go
just as far as the faculty committee,
whether it punished in the same way
or not. It would have to prohibit, and
punish in some adequate manner, not
only drunkenness and disorder, but
also the use of liquor in any quantity
upon the campus. To be convinced
that this is so you have only to dolt
yourselves what has been the plain
attitude of the Trustees and Faculty
upon the liquor question, and you will
be forced to answer that they areun
alterably opposed to its use in any
qtl ail tit) upon the campus, and will
not tolerate any drunkenness or dis
orderly conduct either on or away
from the campus.
This being true it seems very plain
and evident that for the students to
attempt to administer justice and dis
cipline without absolutely and hon
estly concurring in the above ruling,
would quickly resujt in failure, for
any removal of the "lid" on the liquor
question is bound to result in an in
crease in the use of liquor, just as it
has happened before. Now if you will
analyze the spirit of the Thursday
morning meeting you must admit that
it did not concur with the Faculty rul
ing, in fact several of the speakers
expressed themselves in just the op
posite spirit. The idea seemed to be
that it would not be improper to bring
liquor upon the campus provided you
were not caught, and kept still about
it; that there would be no "gumshoe
work" going on, and the committee
probably wouldn't notice it, and
wouldn't be apt to act until a formal
complaint was made. Such an atti
tude, or any attitude approaching it,
is no proper one in which to approach
the problem of student control, and
would sooner or later be bound to re
sult in failure.
It is argued, also, that we have
nothing to lose by it and everything
to gain. That, also, if you will per
mit me to say so, is no proper atti
tude in which to attack this proposi
tion. If we accept student control we
must make a success of it. A failure
would certainly result in a state of
affairs similar to that of 1008, which
those of us who were here then re
member as a time of bitter spirit, and
strong antagonism between Faculty
and students, a most intolerable state
of affairs, and one which every loyal
Stanford man should dread to have
the University experience again. Four
years have passed since that time, and
its effects are not yet entirely over
come or forgotten.

I wish to present for the considera
tion of the men of the university an
aspect of the student control question
which, I think, escaped consideration
last Thursday, and which I at that time
felt unable to present properly.
It was made clear that the proposi
tion offered by the faculty is one of ab
solute student control, limited only by
a few general fundamental rules of the
board of trustees, and it was also made
clear that the faculty is acting in en
tire good faith, and indeed would be
greatly pleased if the students could
relieve them of this great problem.
But is was not made clear that, in in
terpreting the fundamental rules, and
applying them to specific cases as they
arise that the student committee will
necessarily have to follow closely the
precedents of the faculty committee in
judging what acts cannot be tolerated,
although it would not have to follov.
precedents for punishment of those
acts. To illustrate what I mean: I feel
absolutely certain that in dealing with
the liquor question the student com
mittee would, necessarily, have to go
just as far as the faculty committee,
whether it punished in the same way
or not. It would have to prohibit, and
punish in some adequate manner, not
only drunkenness and disorder, but
also the use of liquor in any quantity
upon the campus. To be convinced
that this is so you have only to dolt
yourselves what has been the plain
attitude of the Trustees and Faculty
upon the liquor question, and you will
be forced to answer that they areun
alterably opposed to its use in any
qtl ail tit) upon the campus, and will
not tolerate any drunkenness or dis
orderly conduct either on or away
from the campus.
This being true it seems very plain
and evident that for the students to
attempt to administer justice and dis
cipline without absolutely and hon
estly concurring in the above ruling,
would quickly resujt in failure, for
any removal of the "lid" on the liquor
question is bound to result in an in
crease in the use of liquor, just as it
has happened before. Now if you will
analyze the spirit of the Thursday
morning meeting you must admit that
it did not concur with the Faculty rul
ing, in fact several of the speakers
expressed themselves in just the op
posite spirit. The idea seemed to be
that it would not be improper to bring
liquor upon the campus provided you
were not caught, and kept still about
it; that there would be no "gumshoe
work" going on, and the committee
probably wouldn't notice it, and
wouldn't be apt to act until a formal
complaint was made. Such an atti
tude, or any attitude approaching it,
is no proper one in which to approach
the problem of student control, and
would sooner or later be bound to re
sult in failure.
It is argued, also, that we have
nothing to lose by it and everything
to gain. That, also, if you will per
mit me to say so, is no proper atti
tude in which to attack this proposi
tion. If we accept student control we
must make a success of it. A failure
would certainly result in a state of
affairs similar to that of 1008, which
those of us who were here then re
member as a time of bitter spirit, and
strong antagonism between Faculty
and students, a most intolerable state
of affairs, and one which every loyal
Stanford man should dread to have
the University experience again. Four
years have passed since that time, and
its effects are not yet entirely over
come or forgotten.
