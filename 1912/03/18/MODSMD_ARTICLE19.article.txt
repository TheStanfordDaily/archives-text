Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Without arguing for or against, but
simply as presenting certain phases
of Student Control which may not have
occurred to all qualified voters,1
should like to point out:
1 Whether or not under Student Con
trol the honor system would prevail
in examinations, it certainly would
in conduct outside the class-rooms. In
certain places malefactors are trailed
before a Judge by a professional "cop."'
Under Student Control each man would
be honor bound to act properly, to
report infringement of rules and to
£ee that proper penalties be imposed.
We would all be "cops."
Regardless of the personnel of the
present student committee, it is con
ceivable that one divided in policy can
be elected, furthermore, what power
is there to make a committee hear
what it is told, see what it looks at, or
act upon cases upon which it sits?
Might it not lie that a friend of the
five (or of the three) woul 1 escape un
punished for a grave offeree while an
unknown man would be given the
maximum for a trivial act By making
a few decisions, rightly or wrongly,
the committeee might render places
i thereon so unpopular that no olfie
could be found to till them.
I Interpretation of rules of the Board
of Trustees or of the Faculty, would,
! in the last analysis, have to conform
j to the ideas of the makers of those
rules. Should the Board of Trustees
deem drunkenness, on or off the cam
pus, quiet or disorderly, cause for
suspension, the students would have
| to enforce this interpretation, regard
l less of their own opinions, or else hand
: over control of affairs. There is no
democracy under a power at liberty to
assume control.
Some say we have nothing to lose.
If we make a failure of things now,
when will we get another chance? If,
by waiting longer, we become better
prepared, we are not so apt to wreck
the ship of state and so might, in the
end, be thereby gainers. We have a
better future chance to lose.
To use a thread-bare mixim, "Men
are more important than measures."
We need a political and moral virtue
pervading the entire Student Body. If
every man stands aggressively and un
qualifiedly for a clean life and a square
deal, the control of student affairs
will be a success under any system.
Let us know our own minds before
voting, and then, which ever way the
ballot goes, be at one to augment the
good name of Stanford.

suspension, the students would have
| to enforce this interpretation, regard
l less of their own opinions, or else hand
: over control of affairs. There is no
democracy under a power at liberty to
assume control.
Some say we have nothing to lose.
If we make a failure of things now,
when will we get another chance? If,
by waiting longer, we become better
prepared, we are not so apt to wreck
the ship of state and so might, in the
end, be thereby gainers. We have a
better future chance to lose.
To use a thread-bare mixim, "Men
are more important than measures."
We need a political and moral virtue
pervading the entire Student Body. If
every man stands aggressively and un
qualifiedly for a clean life and a square
deal, the control of student affairs
will be a success under any system.
Let us know our own minds before
voting, and then, which ever way the
ballot goes, be at one to augment the
good name of Stanford.
Maurice G. Parsons, '10.
