Editor Daily Palo Alto:
I have long since learned to quit
j talking about prep school at Stanford.
However, during the past week I have
! been so constantly reminded of prep
school days that I can't keep still. We
I used to do wonderful things at my prep
j school. We could put tacks in people's
seats and throw notes around the room,
and just think, we didn't always get
j caught!
| 1 don't know what we used to call
the trick then, but at Stanford we call
i it the "soft pedal." The name was
I borrowed from Karl Schaupp. who said
| in assembly the other day that if we
I got student control, it was up to each
man to tell his offending brother man
to "cut it out." A considerable por
tion of the student body, however, got
the idea that the purpose of student
[control was to apply the "soft pedal"
by telling the other fellow to "keep it
dark" and helping him do it.
Personally, I heartily favor student
control, and shall support it on Wed
nesday. Hut as for this "soft pedal"

proposition, it is too "soft" and
"childish" to appeal to a grown up
man.
Will any less booze be brought into
Encina if everyone tries to keep it
dark? Will it reform the drunk to
tell him to keep it up, only not to
get his name in the papers? I ask
you, Mr. Editor, frankly, isn't this
"soft pedal" talk a sign that some of
lis haven't fully outgrown our moral
infancy yet? Frankly', wouldn't it be
a smirch on the Stanford name to
adopt student control if it had fo fol
low such a policy? I'm for a student
body united to boost Stanford.
A Stanford Mann.
