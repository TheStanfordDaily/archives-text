# STANFORD WINS YEAR'S FIRST BASEBALL SERIES
## CARDINAL DEFEATS THE OLYMPIC CLUB 2 TO 1. Last Game With City Men is Close Contest.—University Band Pleases Crowd. 
### 
By defeating the Olympic Club 2 to
1 on Saturday, Stanford won the first
baseball series of the year. In the
three games played by these teams the
Cardinal was victorious in all.
Saturday's game was a fast-played,
non-spectacular contest in which each
team earned one run. The winning
score was presented to Stanford by one
of the visitors' five errors. In the fifth
inning, with one down, Beeger singled
to center and took third when the ball
got past their center fielder. Noble
hit down the third base line and was
later caught stealing second. Scofield
then raised a long fly to center which
the former Stanford man dropped.
Couch retired the side by grounding
out to first.
The Olympic men were the first to
score. In the fourth inning Swanton
singled to right. Here Howe gave
place to Couch, owing to illness.
Workman then hit for two bases and
scored Swanton. Although the visitors
hit safely twice in both the next two
Innings, they could not score.
Terry is Heavy Hitter.
Argabrice opened the sixth frame
vlth a double to center. Obear was
out, second to first, advancing Arga
brite to third. Terry then hit for two
bases to left and scored the Stanford
fielder. Cass and Gilfillan retired the
side, and left Terry on second.
A hit, a base on balls, and a struck
batsinen filled the bases in the eighth
with two out, but the necessary hit.
was not forthcoming
Southpaw Girot again pitched good
ball, but his support was extremely
poor. The Olympic man struck out
nine and walked but one. Coach
Peters was absent from the game ow
ing to sickness.
The Stanford band was well received
by the crowd and did much to speed up
and help pass the game.
