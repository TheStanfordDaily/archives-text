# JUNIOR OPERA SEATS ON SALE THURSDAY MORNING
## SHOW PROMISES TO BE THE BEST EVER GIVEN. Couch Carlyle Has Created Remarkable Sinking and Dancing Numbers. 
### 
Ticket√ü for the 1913 Junior Opera,
"The Girl and the Voice," will go on
sale Thursday afternoon at the Book
store on the campus and at Weingart
ner's Pharmacy in Palo Alto. It has
been decided to take this step and
make for an early sale in order to
judge whether the demand for seats is
sufficient to warrant a second per
formance.
According to present indications, the
sale of seats will be a record one. So
much interest has already been shown
on the campus over the opera that
some are predicting that seats for the
performance will be at a premium be
fore the rise of the curtain on the even
ing of March 28.
The posters and pictures depicting
scenes from the opera were distributed
around the Quad this morning. The
pictures are by Davey and show char
acteristic scenes from various parts
of the play. According to those in
charge, even these pictures give but a
slight idea as to the snappiness and
general attractiveness of the show.
The single poses from scenes taken
during dances give no idea as to the
grace of all the solo and chorus terpis
chorean efforts. But it is the music
which will remain longest in the minds
of those who witness the performance.
Every song from the opening chorus in
three parts, to the closing chorus in
two, with eighteen numbers in between,
is so catchy and singable that it will
be whistled on the Quad the morning
after the performance. Seven solo
dances accompany as many songs, and
there are ten numbers in which the
chorus makes its appearance.
