Tomorrow the men of the Univer
sity will decide whether they wish to

assume student self-govern
ment. Arguments on both
sides of the question have
occupied the attention of

Stanford for the past week and further
comment is perhaps unneccessary, but
we would accent again the fact that a
vote in favor of student control will
be a vote to rehabilitate the name of
Stanford in public estimation.
One point, however, has become
confused. The Advisory
of the Conference, which will have
•charge of the disciplinary functions, i?f
nothing more nor less than the ex
ecutive committee of the Conference.
It is to the Conference that the Stu
dent Affairs Committee has submitted
the plan of self-government and it is
the Conference which will be held re
sponsible for the working of the plan.
All decisions and evidence may be re
viewed by this group of thirty men.
Discussion of purely hypothetical
problems arising out of so-called "last
cases" can do no good and at most
merely befog the issue. The men of
Stanford are capable of self-govern
ment and we firmly believe the propo
sition placed before the students has
been evolved in good faith and with
every intention of giving student self
government the fair showing to which
it is entitled. Vote right, tomorrow;
vote for student control and the good
name of Stanford.
