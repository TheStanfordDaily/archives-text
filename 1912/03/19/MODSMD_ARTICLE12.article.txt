Since a great many questions have
Aieen asked in regard to the final case
on which the success or failure of
student control will be decided, 1 con
sider it my duty to make the point
clear.
The faculty will not take action in
anv case settled by students unless

the system is a failure. In such an
event only will they reserve the right
to interfere in the last case and then
only on a flagrant failure of the stu
dent committee to use ordinary com
mon sense.
This, while it does not alter the basis
and sense of student control, as
offered us, does vary from a former
statement of mine in that the final
case can be opened if it is extreme.
Such a case the faculty committee say
they cannot conceive of, and they also
say that the only thing that prevents
them from granting even this is the
technical reason that such a power
does not lie within their hands.
My attitude towards the plan as
offered is not changed in the least from
that which i expressed at the meeting
last Thursday.
