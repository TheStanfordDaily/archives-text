Editor Daily Palo Alto:
It' the men will think back to Thurs
day's meeting, they will remember that
while the expression "the soft pedal"
was used, the men were told that
"Student control does not mean li
cense; that it does not mean coming
as near the line as posible, without
treading over it—but that it does mean
that each individual must make a con
scious effort to prevent the breach of
rules," not only in the letter but also
in their spirit.
If what was said at the meeting
could be interpreted to mean that we
stand for reversion to things "child
ish'' or "unmanly," I wish to make a
plain statement of my conceptions of
what student control demands.
First of all, it does not mean a
return of drinking. It does not mean
that a student committee can smile
at those who are clever enough to
bring liquor on the campus without
being publicly proclaimed. It does not
mean that a man can bring beer to the
campus and hide it in the hedge or
garden and can escape because he did
not take it into his house. It does
not mean that this committee can
stand by and see a man come back in
a disorderly condition, be he drunk
or sober, and not take action. While
some of us may be childish, there are
others while not "full-grown" men are
near enough to that state to at least
want to stand for things that are.
manly.
Drinking Question.
What a man's own idea may be of
the drinking question does not enter
here. We have a ruling set down by
the Board of Trustees and if we want
control we must accept it, if we do not
want to accept it then we cannot have
the control, —but if it is accepted then
we must do our duty even though it
be unpleasant.
On the other hand, the acceptance
of the proposed plan will not mean
that any student committee will be
asked to search the rooms or hedges
for the illicit liquid.
To go further, we do not want t(T
return to the old condition of things
and it is for this reason mainly that
1 for one am supporting this measure
as strongly as I can.
We know very well that students in
this university, or in any other, will
always go as far as he can when
the faculty sits in judgment. When
a man who can go the farthest without
being caught, has the false idea that
he is doing something big, he still has
the childish attitude. Rut if his fel
low students are the ones who are go
ing to control things then his esca
pades lose their glamour.
Control Means Safety.
1 believe that student control means
safety—not for the individual who
transgresses but for the name of Stan
ford —and of the Stanford students.
If we are not yet men. we at least
hope to be at some time in the future
—and the time to begin developing
manly traits is the present. 1 believe
that men will keep rules —not because
they are afraid of the judgment, but
because they will feel that it is their
duty to the institution and they will
surely respond more heartily to an in
stitution to which they give their sup
port than they will to one that belongs
to the faculty.
If it is the belief of anyone that the
passing of this measure means a
"return of booze", he is mistaken.
Rut if lie cannot see it in any other
light, then it is his duty to vote "NO."
If anyone believes that the general
ilone of the student body will not be
raised by the assumption of the re
sponsibility—then he should vote
i "NO."
This is perhaps the most peaceful

time Stanford has ever seen—and it
is at times such as this that men must
provide for the future. If we wait un
til we want control more than we do
now—we will no doubt want it for
an ulterior motive —and will not get
it or at least should not. When men
thing coolly—and are not influenced
by excitement—is the time to install
the system so that its efficiency will
be the strongest when needed most.
A time of trouble is 110 time to experi
ment.
To such men as Chapman, Parsons
and Mann, who wrote communications
in last night's paper, we look for the
successful carrying out of student con
trol—for they show that they have the
welfare of our University near enough
at heart to do careful thinking and
are manly enough to do frank speak
ing. We need such discussion for we
do not care to leave a single point
uncovered. We want to look ahead
and see clearly where we are going.
