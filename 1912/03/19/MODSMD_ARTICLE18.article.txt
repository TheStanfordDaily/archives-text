Editor Daily Palo Alto:
On last Friday, at a joint meeting
of the Faculty Student Affairs Com
mittee and the Student. Advisory Com
mittee of the University Conference,
the agreement under which student
seif-government might be assumed
was fully discussed. This agreement
was published in last night's Daily
Palo Alto. Along with this agreement
the faculty committee presented a
statement in explanation of its posi
tion under the proposed system. This
statement explains why it is necessary
that the faculty committee continue to
exist, and why it could not, even if it
so desired, rid itself of the iinal re
sponsibilty in matters of discipline.
As it shows, and as was pointed out
in the assembly, the faculty committee
as an administrative organ of the uni
versity is entrusted with these matters
by the Board of Trustees and faculty,
and can not sign away its responsi
bility. For this reason, the actions
taken by the Student Committee â€¢'must
necessarily be officially confirmed by
the Faculty Committee. The*second
paragraph of this mereUi
states the faculty inteM
tion to give as for studenT
control as is possible. It is of course
understood that in case the student
committee can not maintain proper
standards the faculty committee will
no longer feel justified, under its re
sponsibility to the Trustees, in con
firming the actions of the student com
mittee, and student self-government
will have to be abandoned.
This matter was so fully explained
at the student assembly that it was
not thought necessary to print the
statement, hence it has been rumored
that some important document has
been kept from the public. In order
to correct this wrong impression and
prevent any possible misunderstand

ing, the statement is herewith pre
sented.
"It should be noted that the matter
of student conduct and the mainten
ance of university standards is in
trusted to the Committee on Student
Affairs both by the Board of Trustees
and by the Faculty of the University,
and that there is no way in which the
Committee can rid itself of this linal
responsibility. All action involving
university discipline must necessarily
be confirmed by this Committee.
"If the University Conference shall
decide to assume responsibility for
the government of the men of the
University it is the purpose of the
Committee 011 Student Affairs to dele
gate its functions to the Conference to
the fullest extent possible and to pro
vide full scope for the exercise of stu
dent control. So long as university
standards are maintained, so long as
the men shall actually handle the sit
uation, the committee expects to sus
tain the Conference and to improve its
findings. Beyond this the Committee
has 110 authority to go."
The faculty committee has given
its word that student control shall be
a lair trial free from faculty inter
ference. This should be sufficient to
satisfy any fair-minded individual and
especially in view of the great confi
dence which the faculty is placing in
the members of this student body. I
have faith enough in Stanford men to
believe that they are as capable of
self-government as men in other in
stitutions and that they have the
proper ideals necessary for the main
tenance of high standards of student
conduct. If this is true, the reserva
tion in the faculty of the right to no
longer confirm the actions of the stu
dent committee and to take back con
trol, will never offer any practical
difficulties.
If Stanford men prove themselves
incapable of maintaining proper stand
ards the system will be a clear failure
and students and faculty alike will
expect a return to the present system.
