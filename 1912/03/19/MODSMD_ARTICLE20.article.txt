Editor Daily Palo Alto:
If Student Control is to be a success
at Stanford one thing is certain, name
ly, that the student body must stand
behind the five men who are to take
the place of the present Faculty Com
mittee on Student Affairs. Without
the hearty support of the student body
in general these men would be entirely
unable to cope with the situation. A
Student Committee to which was at
tached one half of the stigma which
attaches itself to the present Faculty
Committee, would find itself forced
either to withdraw from office, or
from association with the members
of the student body in general. What
is to prevent the proposed Student
'Committee from acquiring a large
measure of that ill repute which the
[Faculty Committee now enjoys? The
unpopularity of the Faculty Committee
has resulted from one thing, and only
one, namely, their enforcement of the
regulation against "Booze." Bar
their rulings on this subject and they
might almost be popular.
Necessary.
Now, even giving the most liberal
interpretation to the faculty offer, the
fact remains that the "booze" regula
tions must he enforced, must be en
forced strictly and to the letter. Can
a committee which finds itself seek
ing to enforce prohibition laws, in a
distinctly non-prohibition community,
hope to retain the hearty co-operation
of that community?
Without such co-operation, Student
Control cannot succeed, because the
men who seek to enforce these meas
ures will be forced to live side by side
with the other members of the college
community and cannot maintain the
independent position which is possible
to the faculty who live apart from us.
I question whether co-operation and
good feeling between student body
and Committee is to be expected.
