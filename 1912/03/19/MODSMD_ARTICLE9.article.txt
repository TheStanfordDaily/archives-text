# PLAY OF JEROME'S CHOSEN BY SENIORS.
## Romance of British Nobleman Will Stir the Hearts of Stanford Senior Week. 
### 
The marriage of a London chorus
girl and a peer of England starts the
ball rolling in the comedy farce chosen
by the 1912 Senior play committee for
their class production in May. "Fan
nie's Relations," by Jerome K. Jerome,
is the choice of the committee. The
comedy is brought in very cleverly
through the situations which arise
when Fannie, the little actress, finds
that she has married a lord and not the
young artist she has supposed her
fiance to be. The servants at the great
ancestral home of Ihtntox, of which
Fannie finds herself the mistress, turn
out to be relatives of the new lady.
All sorts of amusing predicaments
arise and admirers of Jerome's "Three
Men in a float," will appreciate how
the author takes advantage of each op
portunity for his bursts of humor.
Try-outs will be held Wednesday
afternoon in room fiB at 1 o'clock for
those who have not tried out before
and at 2 o'clock for those called to
second try-out.
