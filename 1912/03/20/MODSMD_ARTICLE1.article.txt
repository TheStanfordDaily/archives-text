# STANFORD LOSES FIFTH GAME TO INDEPENDENTS
## VARSITY SHUT-OUT IN A SLOW CONTEST, 5-0. Cardinal Players Unable to Hit at Opportune Time and Field Poorly. 
### 
With much comedy and little effort,
Ireland's Independents shut out the
Stanford Varsity today by a score of
5-0. This is the fifth straight victory
for Ireland over the Cardinal, and
closes the present season's series.
Today's playing on the part of the
Varsity was as poor as that displayed
at any other time during the season.
Three errors, all in one inning, and
an inability to hit the ball at the
opportune time, marked the weakness
of the Stanford players. On but two
occasions did a Varsity player reach
third base, and on one of these the
man was caught off the bag.
Ireland's men scored twice in the
first inning after two were down. Two
hits and three errors in the third in
ning gave the visitors two more runs
With four runs and five hits secured
off him up to the fifth inning, Couch
retired in favor of Howe. Hut two
hits were obtained off the second Stan
ford pitcher.
