# STANFORD DEBATERS WILL NORTH FOR CONTEST
## Will Compete With Oregon's Team at Eugene-Forensics With Washington Here. 
### 
After fruitless negotiations for a
change of date, it has finally been
found necessary to hold the debates
with Oregon and Washington on Fri
day, March -!t. This is the time set for
the Junior Prom, but it is also the
evening stipulated in the agreement
drawn last year for the annual tri
angular forensic contests, and the
northern universities are unwilling to
consent to a change.
C. C. Close, '14, and K. E. Leib, '13,
are the Stanford men who will jour
ney to Eugene to meet Oregon's de
baters. R. W. Stewart, 'li>, is alter
nate 011 this team. E. E. Tincher, '12,
and A. E. Worthy, '15. with A. F. Coyle,
'15, alternate, are the stay-at-home
orators. They will debate the Univer
sity of Washington representatives at
Stanford. "Resolved, That judges
should be subject to recall, constitu
tionality granted," will be the subject
for all the contests.
All of these debaters are experi
enced in Stanford forensies with the
exception of the Freshman, Worthy.
Tincher is one of the most skilled de
baters now in college; Leib was a
member of this year's Carnot team;
and Close has already twice debated
the same subject, once on the second
intercollegiate team in its contest with
the first team, and once as a member
of the Sophomore class team.
