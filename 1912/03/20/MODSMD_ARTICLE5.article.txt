## 
### 
"You who have probably never been
hungry for more than a few hours at
a time will hardly be able to realize
what it means for three million Chi
nese to be on the verge of starvation
with 110 food in sight until next May,
because of the destruction of crops in
China by floods," said an active or
ganizer of the Stanford Chinese Fam
ine Relief Fund yesterday afternoon.
This Fund is to be similar to that
raised by the Stanford community a
year ago for the victims of the Italian
disaster, when four hundred dollars
were gathered in a few days time by
a simple plan of collecting.
The American lied Cross is making
collections all over the United States.
Seventeen students met with Dr. D.
Charles Gardner and Professor P. J.
Treat of the History department, at
the request of Dr. Jordan, Monday

China Helped Sjiii Francisco.
It is not generally known that China
and Japan sent the most money for the
relief of San Francisco in 190G and
were unselfish in their efforts to aid
the destroyed city. America is now
doing her best to return the favor.
An American engineer has been sent
to the region devastated by the Hoods
to build dikes, and American Red
Cross officials are expending money
in the most economical manner in buy
ing millet and the cheap grain to save
the people until crops are harvested.
Money may be received at any time
by treasurer Schaupp at the Phi Clam
ma Delta house, phone 102. All sums
will be immediately cabled to Shan
gai and invested within a few hours
in grain, which will be used in pre
serving the lives of the starving.
