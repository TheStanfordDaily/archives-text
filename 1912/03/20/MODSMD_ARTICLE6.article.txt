# RUSH FOR JUNIOR OPERA SEATS BEGINS TOMORROW
## 
### 
Owing to an oversight in last night's
issue of the Daily Palo Alto, the time
for the sale of seats for the Junior
Opera was wrongly stated. The tick
ets will go on sal 1 in the morning at
ight o'clock as is usual, at the Book
store and at Weingartner's Pharmacy
in Palo Alto. The tickets will be sold
in the regular way hv lot.
Because of the unusual interest that:
has been evinced by the campus in the '
production, it has been decided to pre- i
sent the opera on two evenings. The j
first performance will take place on
Thursday evening March 28 and the
second on March 30. This will give

everyone on the campus an opportunity
io pee the opera and will also permit
flie large Palo Alto delegation to wit
ness the performance.
With every rehearsal, the opera is
assuming a more and more perfect
form. The dances of the principals
are down to a fine point as are tho
most of the chorus dances. The re
maining live general rehearsals and
several special ones will he devoted to
putting the last touches to the feature
numbers which form an important por
tion of tho performance, and to work
ing out tho last touches of "business"
for the principals.
