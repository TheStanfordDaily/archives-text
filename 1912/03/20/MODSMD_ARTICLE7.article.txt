With the idea of drawing into ath
letics a greater number of the Stu
dent Body than may compete on Var
sity teams, the Quadrangle Club in
augurated the annual interclass Mar
athon scheduled for tomorrow after
noon on the Stanford oval. Every class
in the University, including the Hold
overs, has entered a team in the race.
Twenty-four men constitute a team,
each runner covering one lap. In ad
dition to the regular Marathon, special
stunts and contests from the ancient
egg race to pursuit de greased pig
have been arranged.
If it is raining tomorrow afternoon
at the scheduled time of the Irish
Marathon, the race will be run 011
Saturday morning at ten o'clock.
To stimulte interest, the Quadrangle
Club offers a silver cup to the winning
class. This trophy is to be suitably
engraved, and placed in the Trophy
room of the Library. A gold medal is
to be given to the Varsity man who
makes the best time and a gold and
silver medal will be awarded to the
first and second best men among the
novices competing. All men who have
never competed 011 any Varsity team
against any outside competitors are
classed as novices.
Rivalry Keen.
Last year, the class of 1913 won.
Judging from the try-outs for places
011 the team, the Irish event tomorrow

lated and an afternoon of sport is in
store for the bleacherites, when the
yearly event is begun at 4 o'clock.
