# Responsibility.
## 
### 
Student Control has been accepted
almost unanimously by the men of the
University. Today's action means that

every voter who fa
vored the proposal
has bound himself to

assist in carrying the plan to a suc
cessful outcome. It is for us to de
cide whether the innovation is of a
permanent nature.
The responsibility will not alone
rest upon the Advisory Committee but
upon every man in the University. We
believe neither faculty nor students
will ever have cause to regret the
.adoption of student control.
