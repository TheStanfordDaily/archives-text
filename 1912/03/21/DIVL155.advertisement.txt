PINK! That's our recipe for taking the
bite out of good tobacco leaf. We hang
the leaf in the warehouse for two years —
temperature and ventilation perfect — all
harshness disappears. A mellowness pre
vails that gives superb flavor and a smooth
ness seldom found. This is the good old
fashioned way of maturing good leaf—and
Velvet is a startling example of tobacco
goodness. Sometime when your pipe is
burning hot and the taste is flat — try
Velvet! At all dealers.
