by the officials.
If Skip Nelson is here next year at
the time of the Junior Opera, his ser
vices will be in demand. Skip, with

ively that they will be asked to swing
their sinuous, but not sinewless, limbs
in the next operatic production.

ively that he won the obstacle race in
record time.
Houlware got the pig: or it would be
more correct to say that the pig got
Houlware. There was more lard on
