# EXHIBIT OF PAINTINGS SHOWS UNUSUAL TALENT
## CANVASSES OF EARNEST NELSON ATTRACT ATTENTION. Many of Scones Are From This Neighborhood.—Exhibition Open Unit Monday. 
### 
Thirty-two canvasses in oil, from the
brush of Earnest Nelson, have proved
a great attraction in the Old Studio
this week. The pictures were placed
011 exhibition there on Saturday after
noon, and many people have daily
viewed the collection.
One canvas was painted at Stanford
in 1910; most were painted in the Ar
tist Colony in the Catskills at Wood
stock, New York, during the past sum
mer and autumn; while another por
tion, perhaps one-fourth, was painted
about the Stanford estate since October
last. The amount of work done within
the past, eight months witnesses close
application.
The canvasses vary greatly in in
tention; some are merely rapid notes
or "pochads," suggesting more than is
shown; some are studies elaborately
exact and complete; some again are
records of the choicer effects of nature
in which prosaic detail is omitted.
These would be called "impressionist,"
while the former are keyed and painted
in more familiar methods and values.
All of these pictures disclose in Nel
son a gifted landscape painter with
poetic sympathy.
The canvas entitled ' 'The Trailing
Cloud" exhibits the most power and is
very beautiful. We can easily under
stand why Mr. Brige Harrison and
Mr. John Carlsen, who directed Mr.
Nelson's work at Woodstock, consider
ed this the most promising achievement
of the summer at that place.
"The Tree Screen" shows fine feeling
in its elusive suggestion, and subtle
coloring, while "September Oaks" sur
passes it for those who care for solid
ity of expression. "Mayfield From
Pine Hill" shows California's dazzling
light space and dry autumn foliage—
if by chance one has learned to per
ceive this charm.
Among the smaller paintings are
many gems; as "The Eucalyptus
Drive," "Summer Clouds," "An Autumn
Sky," "September Impressions," "An
October Pasture."
The painting of clouds as floating
bodies above the field, with meadows
stretching beneath far away and be
yond is a notable achievement. Nel
son's gift as a colorist is also most
promising, but perhaps the most grati
fying fact which impresses one who
considers the exhibition as a whole is
restraint, the restraint not of timid
technique, for the handling is broad
and free, but the restraint of one who
finds the facts of nature quite con
vincing and sufficient.
Nelson's pictures will remain on
view at the Old Studio until Monday.
The exhibition is open from two until
five.

many gems; as "The Eucalyptus
Drive," "Summer Clouds," "An Autumn
Sky," "September Impressions," "An
October Pasture."
The painting of clouds as floating
bodies above the field, with meadows
stretching beneath far away and be
yond is a notable achievement. Nel
son's gift as a colorist is also most
promising, but perhaps the most grati
fying fact which impresses one who
considers the exhibition as a whole is
restraint, the restraint not of timid
technique, for the handling is broad
and free, but the restraint of one who
finds the facts of nature quite con
vincing and sufficient.
Nelson's pictures will remain on
view at the Old Studio until Monday.
The exhibition is open from two until
five.
