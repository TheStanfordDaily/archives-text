# RACKET WIELDERS WILL ENTER BIG TOURNAMENT
## INTERSCHOLASTIC TENNIS PLAY HELD IN APRIL. Gold and Silver Medals to be Given Winners of Doubles and Singles Hatches. 
### 
Stanford's third interscholastic ten
nis tournament, which is to be held
under the direction of the Inter
scholastic Association on the afternoon
of April 12 and the morning of the day
following, will surpass any tourney for
the preparatory school racquet wield
ers that has yet been attempted on the
Pacific Coast. Every large school in
the west has been sent entry blanks
for the matches.
The rules of the National Lawn Ten
nis Association are to govern all the
matches. Umpires will be provided by
the Interscholastic Board. Standard
balls are also to be supplied to the
players. R. L. Murray, '13, Varsity
tennis captain, is in charge of the ar
rangements for the tourney and will
be assisted by the members of the
Varsity squad.
In anticipation of the crowd which
will be on hand to witness the school
boys in competition for the western
championships and to provide seating
room for the spectators at the inter
collegiate matches, bleachers have
been erected next to the new courts.
Last year the singles matches were
won by John Strachan of Lowell high
school. Strachan is to enter again
this season. This player paired with
W. Johnson of the same school com
posed the team which won the doubles
in 1911. Johnson is also to enter this
year, but not as a teammate of
Strachan as he is now attending an
other school.
Elia Fottrell of St. Ignatius school,
is another high class player who has
signified his intention of playing next
April. The San Franciscan has been
performing brilliantly in numerous
matches around the bay.
Gold medals will be awarded to the
winners of the singles and doubles and
silver medals are to be given to the
runners-up in each of these events.
The awards are to be of solid gold and
the permanent design selected by the
Stanford board is to prevail.
