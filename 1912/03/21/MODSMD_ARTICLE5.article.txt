# JUNIOR OPERA SEATS SOLD BEFORE NOON
## 1913 CAST TO HAVE ONLY TWO MORE REHEARSALS. Coach Carlyle Expresses His Appreciation of Excellent Work of College Actors. 
### 
Every ticket for the first perform
ance of "The Girl and the Voice," the
opera to be staged by the Junior Class
011 the 28th and 30th of this month in
the Assembly Hall, was sold before
noon today. The seats for the second
performance will be placed on sale
promptly at S o'clock Monday morn
ins at the Bookstore on the campus
and Weingartner's Pharmacy in Palo
Alto. From all indications, the second
sale will rival today's and all seat sale
records will be broken. It is under
stood that the Drug Store will make
seat reservations for all who ask for
them. No other opera ever staged on
the campus has been accorded such a
welcome as has the 1913 production.
The final dress rehearsals are sched
uled for Monday and Tuesday evenings
of next week. Coach Carlyle is very
pleased with the work of the cast and
as they have learned their parts per
fectly, he has decided that no more
than these two rehearsals are neces
sary for them to become accustomed to
their costumes and stage settings in
order to present to the University
community a finished production. The
orchestra has been working very con
sistently in harmony with the cast
and is to accompany the final dress re
hearsals.
The popularity of last year's opera
scores was such that the 1913 Com
mittee have already secured the
scores of "The Girl and the Voice,"
and they will be placed on sale at the
time of the show.
