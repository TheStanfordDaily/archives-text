# OCCIDENTAL TEAM IS DEFEATED BY STANFORD
## PITCHERS HOLD BATTERS TO FEW SAFE HITS. Occidental Shutout by Close Score of 2 to 0.—Stanford Fields Well. 
### 
Occidental varsity went down to de
feat before the Stanford nine this after
noon by the score of 2 to 0. The hit
ting of both teams was comparatively
light.
Jones was on the mound for the
Cardinal, and pitched good ball all
the way through. Only six hits were
registered off his delivery, and these
were kept well scattered. He got into
several bad holes, but pulled himself
out without allowing a score. In the
sixth Occidental tilled the bases, with
only one out. Jones took a brace and
struck out the next two batters.
This was the only inning in which
the visitors threatened seriously to
score. On the other eight frames not
a man reached third.
Allen twirled for Occidental, and ex
cept for two bad innings was in ex
cellent form. For the first five innings
Childs was the only Stanford batter
to secure a hit.
On the sixth Cass singled with one
down, and scored when Gilfillan rapped
out a hard three-bagger to deep
center.
Score in Second.
Scofield started the second with
a hit, and went to second on the
catcher's wild peg to first. Jones sent
him to third on a neat sacrifice, and
he scored when the pitcher threw wild
to third, after catching Argabrite's
pop fly.
Stanford fielded excellently all
through the game. The only error
was made by Childs on a hard chance
in right. Terry accepted six hard
chances without an error, while Obear
fielded ten times perfectly. Halm in
center gathered in two hard flys after
good sprints.

Stanford —Argabrite, If; Obear, lb;
