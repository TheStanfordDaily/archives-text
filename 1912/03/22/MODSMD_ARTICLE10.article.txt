# STANFORD SUPPORTS SHANGHAI SUFFERERS
## IMMEDIATE ACTION IS NEEDED IN THE ORIENT. $200 Contributed to Chinese Famine Fund.â€”Subseriptions Received Until Monday. 
### 
The collection for the Stanford Chi
nese Famine Fund already amounts to
over $200.00. It was originally in
tended to close the account 011 Thurs
day afternoon and forward the money
at once to China, but owing to misap
prehension the necessity for immedi
ate action was overlooked. In order,
therefore, that 110 member of the com
munity who desires to contribute to
this fund may lose the opportunity, tlie
fund will remain open until Monday
noon.
The members of the Committee will
be glad to receive all contributions up
to that time. It has not been the in
tention of the Committee to solicit
subscriptions, but simply to afford an
opportunity for all who are interested
to take a part in this world-wide re
lief movement.
Millions of Sufferers.
A recent report from Shanghai esti
mates the number of famine sufferers
this year at 3,000,000 people. The
suffering will increase in intensity un
til the beginning of May, when a new
crop of rice may be expected. The
notable feature of the foreign relief
work this year is its thoroughly busi
ness-like organization. A committee
of Shanghai business-men control all
expenditures.
No relief will be given, except to the
aged, the infirm, and the children, ex
cept in exchange for labor of construc
tive works which will help prevent
these recurring famines. An American
Engineer, Mr. C. D. Jameson, has re
ported on such works as clearing
waterways, building dykes, repairing
roads and bridges.
The new China, with an honest and
efficient government, adequate railway
transportation, improved industrial
conditions, and awakened public spirit,
will be able eventually to eliminate
many of the causes of famine. Rut
today, in the presence of the greatest
wretchedness the world knows, only
world-wide sympathy and aid can
avail.
