# LA 						LIANA CLUB WOMEN PREPARE FOR CAFETERIA.
## Proceeds From Domestic Science Cooking Will Go to Women's Club House Fund. 
### 
A Harvey-American Cafeteria lunch
eon under the direct supervision of the
La Liana women, will be held tomorrow
in Fraternity Hall, Palo Alto, between
11:50 a.m. and 2 p.m. Each individual
cook has prepared her best, to prove
that Palo Alto majors know some
thing of domestic science. Good things
in abundance have been provided to
suit the tastes of the most fastidious
person. Music will be an added luxury
served with the meals to attract the
artistically inclined.
According to the custom established
by the successful cafeteria of last year,
large proceeds are expected to be given
to the Women's Club House. Remem
ber the place, corner University avenue
and High street.
