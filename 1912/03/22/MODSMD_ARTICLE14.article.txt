In the communication from Mr.
Hyde, printed in this evening's paper,

it is stated that the Book
store absolutely refuses to
make any seat reservations.

This policy in general deserves com
mendation, but we think that in cer
tain cases it works an injustice.
The Daily Palo Alto does not regard
the reviewing of plays and donating its
space to the advertising of theatricals
with any unmixed pleasure. When we
are forced to take gallery seats for the
privilege of reviewing a Junior Opera
or Senior Farce, it is not conducive to
an impartial criticism of the play.
In the future, if managers wish pub
licity in these columns they must
bring reserved seat tickets to the office
of the Daily Palo Alto at some time
prior to the day of sale.
