Editor Daily Palo Alto:
The criticism in regard to the draw
ing of numbers for places in line
for the purchase of tickets to the
.Junior Opera is justified.
The clerk who put out the cards
inadvertently left out part of them.
As soon as the discovery was made,
the rest of the cards were put out.
This is the first time that such an over
sight lias occurred and care will be
taken not to let it occur in the future.
We do not see how a better mixing
of numbers can be made than by the
present method; but as it is suggested
that a fairer drawing might be had
from a basket, that method will be
tried on Monday when the sale for the
second performance occurs.
A suggestion is offered in regard to
advertising. The statement appears in
the D. P. A. of Thursday that all the
tickets for the first performance were
sold out by noon on the first day of
the sale.
Such exaggeration cannot benefit
anyone and really works against the
success of the sale. As a matter of
fact, the Bookstore still had on sale
160 of the poorer tickets when the
paper came out.
The statement that all are sold will
deter many people from trying to get
tickets to the first presentation.
Now a word in regard to taking out
comps and other tickets in advance of
date of sale.
This practice has been the cause of
so much complaint that the Bookstore
management long ago decided that
they would never present to the public
a scratched sheet, but that everyone
wanting tickets should have a fair and
even chance.
The firm stand taken by the Book
store has resulted in the practice of
taking out of a large number of tickets
from the half of the house placed on
sale in Palo Alto. This has caused a
great amount of dissatisfaction in Palo
Alto.
Such an opportunity for the displa>
of favoritism will always cause fric
tion. We would suggest that the whole
matter be taken up by the new com
mittee on Student Control and that a
plan be formulated which shall govern
in all future sales.
THE STANFORD BOOKSTORE.
