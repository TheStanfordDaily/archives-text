# TWO BASEBALL GAMES TO BE PLAYED TOMORROW.
## Occidental Will Meet the Varsity and All Stars Will Play Second Team. 
### 
Two baseball games will be played
tomorrow afternoon on the Varsity
diamond. Occidental and Stanford will
cross bats in the first contest while
the second game will be between Pres
ley's All Stars and the second Varsity.
This will be the third and last time
that Stanford will meet the southern
college players this season. The first
game was played in Los Angeles two
weeks ago. while the second contest
took place this afternoon. Coach
Peters has not decided upon the exact
line up which he will use in this game
as several men will probably be used
in the outfield. Howe will start the
game as pitcher with Henshaw behind
the bat.
The first contest will start promptly
at 1:30, and the next game will begin
as soon as the first is finished. En
derle will twirl for the second team,
but the remainder of the line up is in
doubt depending upon who plays in
the Varsity game.
The line up of the All Stars has not
yet been received but it will probably
contain (he usual number of former
university players living in the vicin
ity of San Francisco.
