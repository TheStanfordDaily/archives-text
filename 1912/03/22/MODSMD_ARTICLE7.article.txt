Four tennis experts, representing the
University of Southern California,
reached San Francisco this morning
on the steamer "Yale." On Monday
they will meet the Cardinal players in
the first collegiate tennis tournament
of the year, play beginning early in
the afternoon. K. Newell, E. V. Wel
ler, V. Dixon, and B. Oxnan compose
the southern team, and as this is their
first appearance on the local courts,
the tournament is awaited with a great
deal of interest. A large number of
enthusiastic supporters accompanied
them on the trip northward, and with
the representatives of Occidental Col
lege form a strong southern contin
gent on the campus today.
Stanford will be represented in the
tournament by R. L. Murray, '13, H. S.
Morgan, '12, V. L. Sheldon, '15, and
either F. S. Pratt, '13, or W. N. Hutch
inson, '15. The last two will play their
deciding match on Saturday afternoon.
Monday's tournament will be the
only intercollegiate contest on the
local courts this semester, and will un
doubtedly draw a large crowd. The
time of play has not yet been definitely
announced, but the first game will be
called early in the afternoon.
