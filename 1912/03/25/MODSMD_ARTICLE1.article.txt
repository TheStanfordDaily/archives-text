For the first time since 190S the
track athletes of Pomona College are
to meet the Stanford squad on the cin
der path in regular competition to
morrow afternoon. Fourteen repre
sentatives of the southern institution
arrived on the campus this morning
and indulged in a light accustoming
workout on the track this afternoon.
Coach Stanton is in charge of the
Claremont team.
The southerners have a sturdy squad
of track men and several of the color
bearers of Pomona have made excel
lent records during the present season.
The visitors will be handicapped by a
small team but if they live up to their
past performances an excellent meet is
assured. When Stanford last met the
Pomona track team such men as Him
rod, Sloan, Spurgeon and Merriman
were the opponents of the Cardinal.
Coleman and McKec Out.
Captain T. L. Coleman will probably
be absent from the sprints tomorrow.
I'. B. McKee, '14, is also to be missed
from the shorter races. C. C. Taylor,
'11, is to enter the furlong and E. P.

of winning the 100 yard dash for the
Cardinal. The former is also to com

R. L. Murray, '13, may contest in the

Worthy and Bonnett are to enter the
mile instead of the SSO yard run. The
other members of the squad will entei
their regular events.

the 440 yard dash is the star of the
Pomona team. He has traveled a hun

hurdles, Heath, Harris and Brooks will
