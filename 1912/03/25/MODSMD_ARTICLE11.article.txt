# Senior Week.
## 
### 
The Senior Week committee has al
most completed the program for the

farewell fling of the class of
1912. Carrying out the plan
originated last year, an at
tempt will be made to draw

back as many alumni as possible dur
ing Senior Week.
To make Commencement a success, it
will be necessary that undergraduates
as well as members of the Senior class
take an active interest in the cere
monies which mark the close of the
collegiate year.
It has been the custom for many stu
dents to leave the campus in search of
work before the ink is dry on their last
examination blank.
The two or three days saved in this
manner, gain the individual but little,
while they harm Stanford much, by
withdrawing from the campus those
students who would aid in building up
that spirit of "Commencement Week"
which makes the Harvard or Yale
graduate cross a continent to attend
his class reunion.
