# COACHING LAUNCH IS ANCHORED ON ESTUARY.
## 
### 
j Pirate 11, the launch recently pur
chased for the use of the coaching com-
I mittee, is now securely anchored in
| the estuary at Redwood City, after a
river journey from Sacramento, where
j the boat was formerly owned. Captain
j Seward and L. S. King, '12, brought the
j launch from the Capital City. The new
addition to the Stanford boating equip
l ment was given a thorough trial and
j meets all requirements. The name
| Pirate was the appellation given to the
craft by its former owners and the
j Cardinal oarsmen have not decided
| whether the launch will be re-christen
