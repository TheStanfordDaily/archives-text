The cast announced above is the re
sult of the tryouts held last week in
room 6S for the parts in this year's
play, "Fannie's Relations." This play
chosen by the 1912 committee is one
of Jerome K. Jerome's best comedies.
The English playwright has become
noted by the number of successes his
plays have scored both in this country
and abroad. "The Passing of thu
Third Floor Back," and"Three Men in
a Boat" are among his productions.
Fannie, who is an actress, marries
a nobleman who has disguised himself
as an artist. He takes her to his an
cestral home, where she finds all the
servants to be relatives of some near
or far degree. Martin Bennet, who is
her uncle as well as her new butler,

threatens to betray her. When she
can no longer stand the complications,
she makes Bennet tell the whole affair
and straighten matters out.
Miss Bullis, who plays the part of
Fannie, was seen in the English Club's
production of the "Compromise."
Beach, who plays the real lead in the
role of Martin Bennet, took the princi
pal "pait in the "Compromise," ancl
also appeared in the "Miracle Plays."
Miss Steviek appeared before the col
lege community in the 1912 Junior
Opera and the 1912 Football Show,
and Turpin took parts in"The World
and His Wife," staged last semester by
Sword and Sandals, and in the "Uver
nian Princess." Miss Beach was in
the Schubert Club Opera, "Fatinitza."
