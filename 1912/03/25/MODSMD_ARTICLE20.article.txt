# STANFORD WINS SECOND GAME FROM OCCIDENTAL
## LAST GAME WITH SOUTHERNERS ENDS 8 TO 5. Varsity Plays Excellent Ball and Shows Great Improvement Over Recent Form. 
### 
Stanford made it two straight from
the Occidental players on the Varsity
diamond by defeating them S to 5 on
Saturday. This was the third victory
for the Cardinal over the Southerners.
Coach Peters' presence on the bench
was responsible for the life of the
game, which was one of the fastest
and best played contests of the year.
The fielding of the Varsity and their
work on the bases was far superior to
that displayed by them in the la.3t few
games. They showed an unusual
amount of ginger and were always in
the game. The eight hits, four of
which went for extra bases, were well
bunched and all counted in the run
getting.
Terry Gets Homer.
The first Stanford run was unearned
and came in the second inning. In the
next frame Gilfillan hit the ball for
two bases and advanced to third on
Gault's infield out. Obear then laid
down a perfect bunt scoring Gilfillan
and beating the throw to first. The
first baseman stole second and a mo
ment later registered on Terry's home
run to deep right.
In the sixth inning Cass doubled,
was sacrificed to third by Childs, and
scored on the squeeze when Halm laid
down a bunt.
Singles by Terry and Halm, and a
three-bagger by Enderle in the eighth,
coupled with a base on balls, a sacri
fice, and an error scored three more
runs for Stanford.

Stanford made it two straight from
the Occidental players on the Varsity
diamond by defeating them S to 5 on
Saturday. This was the third victory
for the Cardinal over the Southerners.
Coach Peters' presence on the bench
was responsible for the life of the
game, which was one of the fastest
and best played contests of the year.
The fielding of the Varsity and their
work on the bases was far superior to
that displayed by them in the la.3t few
games. They showed an unusual
amount of ginger and were always in
the game. The eight hits, four of
which went for extra bases, were well
bunched and all counted in the run
getting.
Terry Gets Homer.
The first Stanford run was unearned
and came in the second inning. In the
next frame Gilfillan hit the ball for
two bases and advanced to third on
Gault's infield out. Obear then laid
down a perfect bunt scoring Gilfillan
and beating the throw to first. The
first baseman stole second and a mo
ment later registered on Terry's home
run to deep right.
In the sixth inning Cass doubled,
was sacrificed to third by Childs, and
scored on the squeeze when Halm laid
down a bunt.
Singles by Terry and Halm, and a
three-bagger by Enderle in the eighth,
coupled with a base on balls, a sacri
fice, and an error scored three more
runs for Stanford.
