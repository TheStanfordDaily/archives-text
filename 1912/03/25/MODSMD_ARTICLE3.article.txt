# INTER-SOCIETY DEBATE BY TRI-STATE TEAMS.
## 
### 
Nestoria and Euphronia debating
societies will meet in joint session to
morrow evening in room 231 at 7:30
for an informal discussion of the re
call question as presented by the inter
collegiate debaters. The regular pro
grams will be postponed to allow C. C.
Close, '14. and K. E. Leib, '13, to defend
judicial recall against the arguments
of E. E. Tincher, '12, and A. E. Worthy,
'15. A well-prepared debate is expect
ed as both teams have the subject well
in hand for the contests which will
shortly take place with the Universities
of Washington and Oregon. Inter
societv rivalry will sharpen the dis
cussion, for Leib and Close are Eu
phronians, while Tincher and Worthy
talk for Nestoria. The meeting is open
to all interested.
