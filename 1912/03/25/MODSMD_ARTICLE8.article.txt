and V. Dixon of IT. S. C. in straight
sets, 6-1, G-2, in the doubles match
that opened the tournament.
New ell and Dixon won the first game
of the first set by fast deep-court play.

ponents' weakness in the second game,
however, and by alternate deep lobs
and drives on the return monopolized
the score to the end of the set.
The U. S. C. men won the first and
third games of the second set before
the Varsity players shut them out.
Despite good rallies, Newell and Dixon
failed to score the deciding point in
the next five games.
V. Sheldon, '15, defeated G. B. Ox
nam of IT. S. C., 6-1, 6-3, in the first
singles match of the afternoon.
Oxnam's service won him the only
game he took in the first set. There
after his opening plays weakened and
defaults lost him games when his
strokes, after he was in play, proved
sufficiently effective.
Sheldon took the first game of the
second set, but Oxnam came back
strong and won the second handily.
The next three games went to Shel
don easily. Oxnam found difficulty in
returning deep-court drives.
The U. S. C. player rallied effectively
in the sixth frame and fast up-court
play enabled him to keep the ball be
yond the reach of Sheldon's racquet.
