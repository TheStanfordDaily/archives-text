# WILL REHEARSE JUNIOR OPERA FOR LAST TIME
## CAST AND CHORUSES PERFECT DETAILS TO-NIGHT. "The Girl and the Voice" Promises to be Premier Amateur Musical Performance. 
### 
To-night the final dress rehearsal
of the 1913 Junior Opera "The Girl
and the Voice" will be held in the As
sembly Hall. Last evening the entire
opera was carried through without a
prompt book. The lines are letter
perfect, and the dancing and singing
numbers are as good as it is possible
to make them with amateurs.
The features of the performance will
undoubtedly be the solo dancing num
bers. There are seven of these attrac
tive dances distributed through the
opera. They are all snappy and attrac
tive.
The cast which has been working on
"The Girl and the Voice" for the past
eight weeks is without a doubt the best
that has ever been secured for a Stan
ford opera within the memory of the
present generation. Every part has
been unusually well cast and every one
of the principles has entered into the
work with a rare spirit which has done
much to insure the success of the final
production.
Although the house for Thursday is
practically sold out there are still good
seats left for the Saturday perform
ance. Those who intend to go to the
second show should secure their seats
early as there will undoubtedly be a big
demand for them after the first base
ball game, which takes place on the
afternoon of the performance.
