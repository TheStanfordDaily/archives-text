### 
Stanford lias a good baseball team
this year, a team that is playing inside

ball and knows the fine
points of the game. The
game with Santa Clara will

be the last chance to see this team in
action before the intercollegiate games.
As the final opportunity of showing
the baseball squad that Stanford will
be behind them in their coming con
tests we nrge everyone to be on hand
when the Santa Clara men appear on
the field tomorrow afternoon.
