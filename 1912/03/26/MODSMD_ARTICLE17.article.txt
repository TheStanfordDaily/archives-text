# FESTIVITIES START AT LAGUNITA TOMORROW
## 1913 Will Inaugurate Junior Week With Music and Fireworks at 7:30. 
### 
1913 will usher in its Junior Week
in a blaze of glory tomorrow" evening.
The flickering flames of a great bon
fire will lend a ruddy glow to the still
waters of Lagunita, as some one has
previously remarked; while novel pro
ducts of the pyrotechnic art, fearfully
and wonderfully made, will crackle
and sizz, not to say splutter, on all
sides. Bombs will boom and rockets
rise and ricochet in fitting accompani
ment to the stirring martial strains of
the Combined Glee and Mandolin Clubs
The program of music and fireworks
on the lake will begin at 7:30.
