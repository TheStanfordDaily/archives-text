# SEQUOIA REVIVES WORKS OF FORMER STUDENTS
## BACK-NUMBER WILL BE ISSUED ON WEDNESDAY. Magazine is Filled With Contributions of Stanford Writers Taken From Old Files. 
### 
With, a collection of prose and poetry
by Stanford writers who have achieved
success in the field of literature and
who were former contributors, the
March number of the Sequoia marks
the first time that this publication has
been issued as a "Back-number." Prac
tically all of the material which Edi
tor L. M. Robinson, '12, has included
in his magazine is of a local color, and
while the editor has not attempted to
gather the best articles by former
Stanford writers the coming number
contains contributions of a varied na
ture. Wednesday is the day set for
the appearance of the Sequoia.
Alumni Contribute.
The first article is by the father of
the Stanford Union, H. C. Hoover, '98,
and is a resume of the work of thb
Stanfords. The title of the article is
"And Their Deeds Are Remembered
After Them." Dane Coolidge, '98, a
member of the literary colony at Car
mel-by-the-Sea and a frequent con
tributor to Sunset magazine, has one
of his early stories, "Niffyâ€”the Kid
Sheep," in the issue. "His Junior
Year," a tale of life in Encina, is from
the pen of Miss E. R. Mirrelees, '07, of
the English department. "Which To
day Is" is the work of Miss Sarah Com
stock, '96, who is now a contributor
to Collier's Weekly. A humorous bit
of fiction is written by Miss E. F.
Wynne, '07, whose stories now appear
in McClure's and other eastern maga
zines. The story is entitled "Cam
paign Times."
Irwin Brothers' Cuts and Poetry.
One of the strongest stories that
was ever published in the Sequoia is
reprinted in this issue. This is "God
Have Mercy," by Miss Dora Eckel, ex
'll. Two excellent cuts of Will and
Wallace Irwin are included in the
magazine.
Verse is especially well represented
by the poetry of some of the best
known Stanford writers. Will Irwin's
notable "Baccalaureate Hymn" is the
leading poem. "Goethe" is from the
pen of the late C. L. Story, '9S. "Trib
ute to the Memorial Church" is written
by D. M. Reynolds, '00. Wallace Irwin
contributes his "At Stephenson's Foun
tain." A sonnet by Miss Alice Rich
ards, '05, is titled "On the Campus."
R. E. Renaud's "To One Forgot" com
pletes the number of longer verse.
Tke Russell, '04, Bristoe Adams, '06,
the late Larry Bowman, '01, and C. K.
Fields, '95, are the authors of the
shorter poems.
