# SENIORS NAME APRIL 12 FOR UNIVERSITY JOLLY-UP.
## All Members of Class of 1912 Urged to Remain For Senior Week. 
### 
All the students oi' the University
will jolly-up in the Armory on April
12. The Senior class today selected
this date for the annual Stanford Uni
versity At-Home. R. H. Seward, presi
dent of the Senior class, will name a
committee to formulate plans and
superintend the affair for the Seniors.
An assessment of $2.50 was levied
on each member of the class to assist
in defraying the expenses of Senior
week. It is estimated that the total
expenditure for the week's festivities
will be in the neighborhood of $735.
The revenue to be derived from the
regular entertainment specialities
probably will be $400. It is believed
that the $2.50 assessment will insure
that all bills accruing from expendi
tures of the entertainment committees
will be easily met.
A special plea, urging the Seniors
to remain on the campus for the annual
celebration of Senior week was made
to the Class of 1912 today. In the
past, the call of the outside world has
proved too strong for many of the
new graduates and their presence has
been missed during the festivities in
cident to their departure as members
of the Stanford Student Body.
The Class of 1912 is endeavoring to
establish a precedent in holding all
the members on the campus 'for the
events of the week. The committees
are endeavoring to provide a note
worthy program for the festal davs.
