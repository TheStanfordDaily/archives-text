staff. Art features from the pens of

and the best local talent, poetry and
prose by the most experienced Chapar
ral writers, and a cover which alone
would sell out the issue in record time,
have combined to characterize this
"Chaparral" as the best ever. A. S.
Macdonald, '10, has designed a special
cover in three colors which surpasses
that of any college comic in Chappie's
exchanges. This piece of work has
taken a great deal of time and effort
and it has been produced only with
extreme difficulty and great personal
sacrifice.
W. R. Davenport, '04, a former
Chaparral art man and now a fre
quent contributor to Life, has sent in
a remarkable half-tone. R. W. Bor
ough, '04, one of Stanford's cleverest
artists, designer of the Portola Festi
val poster and the regular Chaparral
cover, has again contributed.
G. C. Smith, '10, has given some side
lights on the Prom in a set of humor
ous cartoons, while Miss M. Bailey,
'14, has drawn the initial page cut de
picting one who has not indulged in
Junior Week and the reason.
This art work is augmented by nu
merous clever sketches by A. T. King,
'12, E. E. Manning, '13, J. E. Duff, '13,
Miss M. Bailey, '14, J. Olsen, '15, and
M. A. Oliver, '15.
Of the literary material, K. Green,
'13, heads the list with the front page
poem entitled "The Rhymster's Kick"
while N. C. Wilson, '12, is the author
of a snappy "Dilettante," colored with
Junior Week sentiment. A full page
is given over to a rhymed review, b>
AT. T. Dooling, '11, of the Sophomore
play.
Shorter paragraphs, jokes, and verse
are written by E. W. Pugh, '11, M. T.
