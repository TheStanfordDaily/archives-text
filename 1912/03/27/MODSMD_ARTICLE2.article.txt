Voting at today's election for mem

very light, but 1 rÂ»n upperclassmen hav
ing registered their choice. R. H.
Seward, '12, C. R. Nunan, '12, A. W.
Ambrose, '13, T. L. Coleman, '12, and
R. L. Murray, '13, were the five re
ceiving the highest number of votes.
Of the new members elected today,
Nunan and Coleman are from the His
tory department, Seward is from the
Economics department, Ambrose is a
Geology and Mining major, and Mur
ray is registered in Chemistry.
The five elected today are delegates
at-large from the two upper classes
and were not chosen from the different
departments, as were their colleagues.
The new members will assume the
responsibility of their offices immedi
ately.
Immediately following vacation, the
Conference will meet at the call of
President K. Ij. Dole, '11, to elect from
among their number five members of
the advisory committee. The candi
dates for committee memberships will
be chosen from both the old and new
members.
As soon as arrangements can be
made, the advisory committee will
assume charge of the actual control
of student affairs and the Faculty Com
mittee will be relieved. Within a shori
time the system will be in well run
ning order and Student Control at
Stanford will have at last become a
reality.
