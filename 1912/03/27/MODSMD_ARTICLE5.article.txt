University of Southern California
tennis players won the lion's share
of the honors in the final play of the
present tournament on Encina courts
this afternoon. In doubles, Weller and
Oxnam defeated Hutchinson and Shel
don, 7-5, 6-3; in singles, Morgan won
from Newell, 6-2, 0-3, and Dixon took
his match from Hutchinson, 7-5, 9-7.
By careful and consistent work the
visitors, Weller and Oxnam, took the
first set after deuce had been reached
at five-all. Sheldon and Hutchinson
of Stanford had a shade on their op
ponents in the early games, but near
the middle of the set the southerners'
adopted lobbing tactics, which forced
the Cardinal players into back court
territory and prevented the smashes
which had won them earlier points.
With the score at five all, the south
erners let out an extra notch of speed
and annexed the two succeeding games
after both had gone to deuce.
In the second set all four players
developed a forehand drive which had
been held back in the opening games.
The rate of play was increased and to
ward the end of the set the visitors
again drew away from the Cardinal
experts. In the final game, with the
score at three-five, the Stanford men
rallied, showing clever placing and
hard smashing. The Methodist play
ers had a strong combination, however,
with Weller serving and Oxnam at the
net, and won out after a series of
deuces.
Newell Plays Morgan.
The Morgan-Newell match developed
the most interesting tennis of the af
ternoon. Newell's serve was hard and
he displayed a powerful volleying
smash and forehand drive. In spite
of his speed he was unable to control
his harder strokes and lost more points
oji them in the first set than he won.
He was gradually outdistanced by his
more experienced opponent, who play
ed a safe, heady and consistent game.
The final score read 6-2 in Morgan's
favor.
The second set found both men fight
ing hard with Morgan's accuracy again
winning him the majority of the points.
In the last game, with the score against
him, Newell rallied splendidly, but lost
the game and the set 6-3.
Hatchinson Loses Hard Matcli.
The closest scores of the entire
tournament marked the Hutchinson-
Dixon match. Hutchinson forced his
southern opponent to his fastest pace
to win two straight sets, the score
being 7-5, 9-7. This match was full
of accurate backcourt work, both play
ers using a cautious defensive style
of play.
