# Junior Week.
## 
### 
Fireworks and music to-night will
usher in another Junior Week. 1913,
with a notable list of achievements

already to its credit, promises
to furnish its guests with an
eventful three-day program.
An original opera, "The Girl

and the Voice," crew races, swimming
contests, a Varsity track meet and a
Stanford-California ball game, and
above all the Junior Prom, should fill
the Junior's cup to brimming and per
ceptibly deplete his pocket book. Ju
nior week comes but once in a life
time, 1913, so enjoy it to its full.
