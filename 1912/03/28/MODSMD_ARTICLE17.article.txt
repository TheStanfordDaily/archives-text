Dear Sir,
A copy of a report on the campus milk supply, prepared by the Palo
Alto Health Officer, Mr. H. O. Jenkins, for the Board of Directors of the
Students' Guild, is enclosed for your information. We wish especially to call
your attention to the following points.
(1) The milk supply as a whole is low in bacterial content, and contains
a reasonably high per cent of butter fat.
(2) Nine-tenths of the suply comes from cows which are not tuberculin
tested. All of this may, and much of it probably does, come from cows in
fected with tuberculosis.
(3). Nine tenths of the supply comes from dairies where the sanitary
conditions are graded below G5 per cent on the score-card system approved
by the U. S. Department of Agriculture.
(4). There is available at the present time a supply of high-grade milk,
from tuberculin tested cows, and from dairies where the sanitary conditions
are excellent.
(5). Roble, Madrono, the Inn, and the majority of the fraternities, soro
rities, clubs, and boarding-houses are supplied by the poorest dairies.
It has been definitely shown during the past few years that human beings
are susceptible to infection with tubercle bacilli of the bovine type. Such
infection is frequent in children, less frequent but nevertheless unquestionable
in grown persons. The source of such infection is the milk, to a lesser
extent the butter, of tuberculous cows. The most reliable method of
avoiding the dangers of such infection is the careful control of dairy cattle,
and our chief method of doing this is by means of the strict enforcement of
the tuberculin test. This "test" is not yet enforced by law in California, but
is being voluntarily carried out by many conscientious dairymen. The prob
lem of protection, therefore, resolves itself chiefly into one of wisdom on the
part of the consumer in choosing the milk of dairies in which the precaution
of cattle testing is observed.
We request you to assist us in our evorts to protect the health of the
community. You can do this by the use, and demanding the supply, of the
highest quality of milk obtainable.
The detailed score-cards of the dairies may be examined at the Guild
office, Room 10, Chemistry building.

Palo Alto, Cal., March 22, 1912,
To the Honorable The Board of Directors of the Students' Guild,
Stanford University, California.
I submit herewith a report upon the milk supply of the Stanford Univer
sity Campus.
Under the heading of Milk Statistics I have given a list of the dairies
supplying milk to the campus, together with the present size of the dairies,
the amount of milk sold, the territories covered by the dairies, and the time
of delivery. These are facts, the knowledge of which is clearly necessary in
an intelligent supervision of the milk supply.
It will be seen that there are now four dairies, delivering a total of
about GGO quarts of milk per day on the campus. One other dairy has recently
ceased coining upon the campus; while a sixth dairy (of three cows) has
never sold any milk, but is mentioned here only because it has offered milk
for sale on one day during the present month.
I have also given the dairy scores and bacteriological and chemical tests
and the statement of the tuberculin test.

liie dairy scares are further given in detail on supplementary sheets
and, as will be seen, afford a measure for rating the dairies on general sani
tation. 100 points are given for perfect, and roughly speaking we may say
that 'JO to 100 is very good, above 75 fair, and below 50 very poor. These
points are divided among the different features of the dairy, such as health
of cows; the construction of stables, utensils and milk-room; the methods
of keeping the cows, stables, utensils and milk-room clean; and the methods
of handling the milk. A weight of 40 points is given to the equipment and 60
points to the methods used, on account of the greater importance of cleanly
methods over that of line equipment. Each feature is further weighted accord
ing to its greater or lesser importance as a health factor. This form of score
card is one that has been recommended for general use by the U. S. Depart
ment of Agriculture, and is now used by a large number of cities in their
milk inspection.
The bacteriological counts and fat determinations were made from samples
taken by myself from the delivery wagons on the campus. A brief explanation
of the meaning of the bacteriological count would not be out of place here.
The bacteria per cc. means the total number of bacteria of all kinds found
in one cubic centimeter of milk. These may not always, and perhaps not
usually, be dangerous; but since milk in the udder of a clean, healthy cow
contains comparatively few bacteria; and since dirt, and especially cow
manure, contains large quantities of bacteria; and further, since bacteria
very rapidly mutiply upon standing in warm milk, —it may be assumed that
a milk with a high bacteriological count has suffered one or more of three
things: (1) gross contamination, (2) insufficient cooling, or (3) that it has
been kept too long. Thus a high bacteriological count can be used as an
indicator that something is wrong, and would necessitate immediate investiga
tions. Furthermore, the count is subject to very great variations, and the
difference of a few thousand per cc. may not be significant.
In general, we may say that 10,000 or less bacteria is excellent; over 100,
000 bacteria per cc. is very bad. 10,000 is the maximum allowed for certified
milk; while some large cities, where the milk must be shipped in from a long
distance, have established an allowable maximum, for market milk, of 500,000
bacteria per cc. In this community, however, where it is possible to deliver
milk very shortly after milking, we should expect a much lower count, possibly
not more than 10,000.
The use of the covered or partially covered milk-pail, which has recently
become universal with the dairies supplying milk to the campus, is probably
responsible for a material reduction in the average bacteriological counts.
The cover excludes a large part of the dirt which often falls from the udder
of a cow while milking.
The following extracts from Harrington and Richardson's Manual of
Practical Hygiene, are very pertinent here: "Stocking demonstrated a differ
ence of 85 per cent in the number of bacteria in l'avor of the covered pail;
and in another series, the cows being less clean, the difference was even
greater, the milk in the coverd pail yielding respectively 1/20 and 1/33 as
many as that of the open pail. . . . The part played by cow-dung in seeding
milk may readily be understood from Warrington's estimate of 165,000,000
bacteria in 1 gram of dung from a hay-fed cow. . . . Straining removes only
the larger particles of manure, hairs, straw, etc., but does not exclude the
fine particles nor the soluble portions of the dung, which pass through with
their millions of bacteria."
In regard to the chemical composition of milk, Harrington and Richard
son say:
"Milk is a solution of sugar, mineral matter and proteids, with other pro
teids and fat in suspension. Its composition is very variable, not alone as
between different species of mammalia by which it is produced, but between
different individuals of the same species . . . (however) .... The compo-

sition of cow's milk of good quality may be expressed fairly in round
numbers as follows: ,>
Fat 4.00 per cent.
Solids, not fat 9.00
Sugar .i 5.00
Proteids 3.30
Mineral matter 70
9.00
Total solids 13.00
Water 87.00
Total 100.00 per cent.
The California State Law establishes the following standard for milk,
and declares it adulterated if not conforming therewith:
"Milk is the clean lacteal secretion obtained by the complete milking of
one or more healthy cows, properly fed and kept, excluding that obtained
within fifteen (15) days before and five (5) days after calving, and contains
not less than three (3.00) per cent, of milk fat and not less than eight and
five-tenths (8.5) per cent, of solids—not fat."
In municipal laboratories tests are most often made for the amount of
fat, for adulteration by added water, or for additions of preservatives.
Fat is by far the greatest natural variable element, and therefore a low fat
does not necessarily mean the watering of the milk. Furthermore, iu some
milk the cream rises much more rapidly than in others. A good example of
this is with the Wildwood Dairy milk. After standing a short time the cream
rises very completely, and when this is skimmed off the remaining milk is very
thin in fat. Thus many unfounded complaints of the poor quality of Wild
wood milk come from the table cosumer who does not take into account the
fact that the milk may have been intercepted in the kitchen and the cream
pitcher greatly enriched at the expense of the milk pitcher.
In this investigation I have tested for fat only. Watering of milk has
occurred so rarely in this vicinity that the expense of routine testing to dis
cover this would hardly be warranted; Special tests could be made if this
practice were suspected. The use of preservatives is of no value to a dairy
that delivers within the same day after milking, and routine tests in this
vicinity are not worth the expense.

The California State Law establishes the following standard for milk,
and declares it adulterated if not conforming therewith:
"Milk is the clean lacteal secretion obtained by the complete milking of
one or more healthy cows, properly fed and kept, excluding that obtained
within fifteen (15) days before and five (5) days after calving, and contains
not less than three (3.00) per cent, of milk fat and not less than eight and
five-tenths (8.5) per cent, of solids—not fat."
In municipal laboratories tests are most often made for the amount of
fat, for adulteration by added water, or for additions of preservatives.
Fat is by far the greatest natural variable element, and therefore a low fat
does not necessarily mean the watering of the milk. Furthermore, iu some
milk the cream rises much more rapidly than in others. A good example of
this is with the Wildwood Dairy milk. After standing a short time the cream
rises very completely, and when this is skimmed off the remaining milk is very
thin in fat. Thus many unfounded complaints of the poor quality of Wild
wood milk come from the table cosumer who does not take into account the
fact that the milk may have been intercepted in the kitchen and the cream
pitcher greatly enriched at the expense of the milk pitcher.
In this investigation I have tested for fat only. Watering of milk has
occurred so rarely in this vicinity that the expense of routine testing to dis
cover this would hardly be warranted; Special tests could be made if this
practice were suspected. The use of preservatives is of no value to a dairy
that delivers within the same day after milking, and routine tests in this
vicinity are not worth the expense.

Dear Sir,
A copy of a report on the campus milk supply, prepared by the Palo
Alto Health Officer, Mr. H. O. Jenkins, for the Board of Directors of the
Students' Guild, is enclosed for your information. We wish especially to call
your attention to the following points.
(1) The milk supply as a whole is low in bacterial content, and contains
a reasonably high per cent of butter fat.
(2) Nine-tenths of the suply comes from cows which are not tuberculin
tested. All of this may, and much of it probably does, come from cows in
fected with tuberculosis.
(3). Nine tenths of the supply comes from dairies where the sanitary
conditions are graded below G5 per cent on the score-card system approved
by the U. S. Department of Agriculture.
(4). There is available at the present time a supply of high-grade milk,
from tuberculin tested cows, and from dairies where the sanitary conditions
are excellent.
(5). Roble, Madrono, the Inn, and the majority of the fraternities, soro
rities, clubs, and boarding-houses are supplied by the poorest dairies.
It has been definitely shown during the past few years that human beings
are susceptible to infection with tubercle bacilli of the bovine type. Such
infection is frequent in children, less frequent but nevertheless unquestionable
in grown persons. The source of such infection is the milk, to a lesser
extent the butter, of tuberculous cows. The most reliable method of
avoiding the dangers of such infection is the careful control of dairy cattle,
and our chief method of doing this is by means of the strict enforcement of
the tuberculin test. This "test" is not yet enforced by law in California, but
is being voluntarily carried out by many conscientious dairymen. The prob
lem of protection, therefore, resolves itself chiefly into one of wisdom on the
part of the consumer in choosing the milk of dairies in which the precaution
of cattle testing is observed.
We request you to assist us in our evorts to protect the health of the
community. You can do this by the use, and demanding the supply, of the
highest quality of milk obtainable.
The detailed score-cards of the dairies may be examined at the Guild
office, Room 10, Chemistry building.
THE STUDENTS' GUILD.
[COPY]
Palo Alto, Cal., March 22, 1912,
To the Honorable The Board of Directors of the Students' Guild,
Stanford University, California.
I submit herewith a report upon the milk supply of the Stanford Univer
sity Campus.
Under the heading of Milk Statistics I have given a list of the dairies
supplying milk to the campus, together with the present size of the dairies,
the amount of milk sold, the territories covered by the dairies, and the time
of delivery. These are facts, the knowledge of which is clearly necessary in
an intelligent supervision of the milk supply.
It will be seen that there are now four dairies, delivering a total of
about GGO quarts of milk per day on the campus. One other dairy has recently
ceased coining upon the campus; while a sixth dairy (of three cows) has
never sold any milk, but is mentioned here only because it has offered milk
for sale on one day during the present month.
I have also given the dairy scores and bacteriological and chemical tests
and the statement of the tuberculin test.

liie dairy scares are further given in detail on supplementary sheets
and, as will be seen, afford a measure for rating the dairies on general sani
tation. 100 points are given for perfect, and roughly speaking we may say
that 'JO to 100 is very good, above 75 fair, and below 50 very poor. These
points are divided among the different features of the dairy, such as health
of cows; the construction of stables, utensils and milk-room; the methods
of keeping the cows, stables, utensils and milk-room clean; and the methods
of handling the milk. A weight of 40 points is given to the equipment and 60
points to the methods used, on account of the greater importance of cleanly
methods over that of line equipment. Each feature is further weighted accord
ing to its greater or lesser importance as a health factor. This form of score
card is one that has been recommended for general use by the U. S. Depart
ment of Agriculture, and is now used by a large number of cities in their
milk inspection.
The bacteriological counts and fat determinations were made from samples
taken by myself from the delivery wagons on the campus. A brief explanation
of the meaning of the bacteriological count would not be out of place here.
The bacteria per cc. means the total number of bacteria of all kinds found
in one cubic centimeter of milk. These may not always, and perhaps not
usually, be dangerous; but since milk in the udder of a clean, healthy cow
contains comparatively few bacteria; and since dirt, and especially cow
manure, contains large quantities of bacteria; and further, since bacteria
very rapidly mutiply upon standing in warm milk, —it may be assumed that
a milk with a high bacteriological count has suffered one or more of three
things: (1) gross contamination, (2) insufficient cooling, or (3) that it has
been kept too long. Thus a high bacteriological count can be used as an
indicator that something is wrong, and would necessitate immediate investiga
tions. Furthermore, the count is subject to very great variations, and the
difference of a few thousand per cc. may not be significant.
In general, we may say that 10,000 or less bacteria is excellent; over 100,
000 bacteria per cc. is very bad. 10,000 is the maximum allowed for certified
milk; while some large cities, where the milk must be shipped in from a long
distance, have established an allowable maximum, for market milk, of 500,000
bacteria per cc. In this community, however, where it is possible to deliver
milk very shortly after milking, we should expect a much lower count, possibly
not more than 10,000.
The use of the covered or partially covered milk-pail, which has recently
become universal with the dairies supplying milk to the campus, is probably
responsible for a material reduction in the average bacteriological counts.
The cover excludes a large part of the dirt which often falls from the udder
of a cow while milking.
The following extracts from Harrington and Richardson's Manual of
Practical Hygiene, are very pertinent here: "Stocking demonstrated a differ
ence of 85 per cent in the number of bacteria in l'avor of the covered pail;
and in another series, the cows being less clean, the difference was even
greater, the milk in the coverd pail yielding respectively 1/20 and 1/33 as
many as that of the open pail. . . . The part played by cow-dung in seeding
milk may readily be understood from Warrington's estimate of 165,000,000
bacteria in 1 gram of dung from a hay-fed cow. . . . Straining removes only
the larger particles of manure, hairs, straw, etc., but does not exclude the
fine particles nor the soluble portions of the dung, which pass through with
their millions of bacteria."
In regard to the chemical composition of milk, Harrington and Richard
son say:
"Milk is a solution of sugar, mineral matter and proteids, with other pro
teids and fat in suspension. Its composition is very variable, not alone as
between different species of mammalia by which it is produced, but between
different individuals of the same species . . . (however) .... The compo-

In general, we may say that 10,000 or less bacteria is excellent; over 100,
000 bacteria per cc. is very bad. 10,000 is the maximum allowed for certified
milk; while some large cities, where the milk must be shipped in from a long
distance, have established an allowable maximum, for market milk, of 500,000
bacteria per cc. In this community, however, where it is possible to deliver
milk very shortly after milking, we should expect a much lower count, possibly
not more than 10,000.
The use of the covered or partially covered milk-pail, which has recently
become universal with the dairies supplying milk to the campus, is probably
responsible for a material reduction in the average bacteriological counts.
The cover excludes a large part of the dirt which often falls from the udder
of a cow while milking.
The following extracts from Harrington and Richardson's Manual of
Practical Hygiene, are very pertinent here: "Stocking demonstrated a differ
ence of 85 per cent in the number of bacteria in l'avor of the covered pail;
and in another series, the cows being less clean, the difference was even
greater, the milk in the coverd pail yielding respectively 1/20 and 1/33 as
many as that of the open pail. . . . The part played by cow-dung in seeding
milk may readily be understood from Warrington's estimate of 165,000,000
bacteria in 1 gram of dung from a hay-fed cow. . . . Straining removes only
the larger particles of manure, hairs, straw, etc., but does not exclude the
fine particles nor the soluble portions of the dung, which pass through with
their millions of bacteria."
In regard to the chemical composition of milk, Harrington and Richard
son say:
"Milk is a solution of sugar, mineral matter and proteids, with other pro
teids and fat in suspension. Its composition is very variable, not alone as
between different species of mammalia by which it is produced, but between
different individuals of the same species . . . (however) .... The compo-

and declares it adulterated if not conforming therewith:
"Milk is the clean lacteal secretion obtained by the complete milking of
one or more healthy cows, properly fed and kept, excluding that obtained
within fifteen (15) days before and five (5) days after calving, and contains
not less than three (3.00) per cent, of milk fat and not less than eight and
five-tenths (8.5) per cent, of solids—not fat."
In municipal laboratories tests are most often made for the amount of
fat, for adulteration by added water, or for additions of preservatives.
Fat is by far the greatest natural variable element, and therefore a low fat
does not necessarily mean the watering of the milk. Furthermore, iu some
milk the cream rises much more rapidly than in others. A good example of
this is with the Wildwood Dairy milk. After standing a short time the cream
rises very completely, and when this is skimmed off the remaining milk is very
thin in fat. Thus many unfounded complaints of the poor quality of Wild
wood milk come from the table cosumer who does not take into account the
fact that the milk may have been intercepted in the kitchen and the cream
pitcher greatly enriched at the expense of the milk pitcher.
In this investigation I have tested for fat only. Watering of milk has
occurred so rarely in this vicinity that the expense of routine testing to dis
cover this would hardly be warranted; Special tests could be made if this
practice were suspected. The use of preservatives is of no value to a dairy
that delivers within the same day after milking, and routine tests in this
vicinity are not worth the expense.

Dear Sir,
A copy of a report on the campus milk supply, prepared by the Palo
Alto Health Officer, Mr. H. O. Jenkins, for the Board of Directors of the
Students' Guild, is enclosed for your information. We wish especially to call
your attention to the following points.
(1) The milk supply as a whole is low in bacterial content, and contains
a reasonably high per cent of butter fat.
(2) Nine-tenths of the suply comes from cows which are not tuberculin
tested. All of this may, and much of it probably does, come from cows in
fected with tuberculosis.
(3). Nine tenths of the supply comes from dairies where the sanitary
conditions are graded below G5 per cent on the score-card system approved
by the U. S. Department of Agriculture.
(4). There is available at the present time a supply of high-grade milk,
from tuberculin tested cows, and from dairies where the sanitary conditions
are excellent.
(5). Roble, Madrono, the Inn, and the majority of the fraternities, soro
rities, clubs, and boarding-houses are supplied by the poorest dairies.
It has been definitely shown during the past few years that human beings
are susceptible to infection with tubercle bacilli of the bovine type. Such
infection is frequent in children, less frequent but nevertheless unquestionable
in grown persons. The source of such infection is the milk, to a lesser
extent the butter, of tuberculous cows. The most reliable method of
avoiding the dangers of such infection is the careful control of dairy cattle,
and our chief method of doing this is by means of the strict enforcement of
the tuberculin test. This "test" is not yet enforced by law in California, but
is being voluntarily carried out by many conscientious dairymen. The prob
lem of protection, therefore, resolves itself chiefly into one of wisdom on the
part of the consumer in choosing the milk of dairies in which the precaution
of cattle testing is observed.
We request you to assist us in our evorts to protect the health of the
community. You can do this by the use, and demanding the supply, of the
highest quality of milk obtainable.
The detailed score-cards of the dairies may be examined at the Guild
office, Room 10, Chemistry building.
THE STUDENTS' GUILD.
[COPY]
Palo Alto, Cal., March 22, 1912,
To the Honorable The Board of Directors of the Students' Guild,
Stanford University, California.
I submit herewith a report upon the milk supply of the Stanford Univer
sity Campus.
Under the heading of Milk Statistics I have given a list of the dairies
supplying milk to the campus, together with the present size of the dairies,
the amount of milk sold, the territories covered by the dairies, and the time
of delivery. These are facts, the knowledge of which is clearly necessary in
an intelligent supervision of the milk supply.
It will be seen that there are now four dairies, delivering a total of
about GGO quarts of milk per day on the campus. One other dairy has recently
ceased coining upon the campus; while a sixth dairy (of three cows) has
never sold any milk, but is mentioned here only because it has offered milk
for sale on one day during the present month.
I have also given the dairy scores and bacteriological and chemical tests
and the statement of the tuberculin test.

liie dairy scares are further given in detail on supplementary sheets
and, as will be seen, afford a measure for rating the dairies on general sani
tation. 100 points are given for perfect, and roughly speaking we may say
that 'JO to 100 is very good, above 75 fair, and below 50 very poor. These
points are divided among the different features of the dairy, such as health
of cows; the construction of stables, utensils and milk-room; the methods
of keeping the cows, stables, utensils and milk-room clean; and the methods
of handling the milk. A weight of 40 points is given to the equipment and 60
points to the methods used, on account of the greater importance of cleanly
methods over that of line equipment. Each feature is further weighted accord
ing to its greater or lesser importance as a health factor. This form of score
card is one that has been recommended for general use by the U. S. Depart
ment of Agriculture, and is now used by a large number of cities in their
milk inspection.
The bacteriological counts and fat determinations were made from samples
taken by myself from the delivery wagons on the campus. A brief explanation
of the meaning of the bacteriological count would not be out of place here.
The bacteria per cc. means the total number of bacteria of all kinds found
in one cubic centimeter of milk. These may not always, and perhaps not
usually, be dangerous; but since milk in the udder of a clean, healthy cow
contains comparatively few bacteria; and since dirt, and especially cow
manure, contains large quantities of bacteria; and further, since bacteria
very rapidly mutiply upon standing in warm milk, —it may be assumed that
a milk with a high bacteriological count has suffered one or more of three
things: (1) gross contamination, (2) insufficient cooling, or (3) that it has
been kept too long. Thus a high bacteriological count can be used as an
indicator that something is wrong, and would necessitate immediate investiga
tions. Furthermore, the count is subject to very great variations, and the
difference of a few thousand per cc. may not be significant.
In general, we may say that 10,000 or less bacteria is excellent; over 100,
000 bacteria per cc. is very bad. 10,000 is the maximum allowed for certified
milk; while some large cities, where the milk must be shipped in from a long
distance, have established an allowable maximum, for market milk, of 500,000
bacteria per cc. In this community, however, where it is possible to deliver
milk very shortly after milking, we should expect a much lower count, possibly
not more than 10,000.

Palo Alto, Cal., March 22, 1912,
To the Honorable The Board of Directors of the Students' Guild,
Stanford University, California.
I submit herewith a report upon the milk supply of the Stanford Univer
sity Campus.
Under the heading of Milk Statistics I have given a list of the dairies
supplying milk to the campus, together with the present size of the dairies,
the amount of milk sold, the territories covered by the dairies, and the time
of delivery. These are facts, the knowledge of which is clearly necessary in
an intelligent supervision of the milk supply.
It will be seen that there are now four dairies, delivering a total of
about GGO quarts of milk per day on the campus. One other dairy has recently
ceased coining upon the campus; while a sixth dairy (of three cows) has
never sold any milk, but is mentioned here only because it has offered milk
for sale on one day during the present month.
I have also given the dairy scores and bacteriological and chemical tests
and the statement of the tuberculin test.

liie dairy scares are further given in detail on supplementary sheets
and, as will be seen, afford a measure for rating the dairies on general sani
tation. 100 points are given for perfect, and roughly speaking we may say
that 'JO to 100 is very good, above 75 fair, and below 50 very poor. These
points are divided among the different features of the dairy, such as health
of cows; the construction of stables, utensils and milk-room; the methods
of keeping the cows, stables, utensils and milk-room clean; and the methods
of handling the milk. A weight of 40 points is given to the equipment and 60
points to the methods used, on account of the greater importance of cleanly
methods over that of line equipment. Each feature is further weighted accord
ing to its greater or lesser importance as a health factor. This form of score
card is one that has been recommended for general use by the U. S. Depart
ment of Agriculture, and is now used by a large number of cities in their
milk inspection.
The bacteriological counts and fat determinations were made from samples
taken by myself from the delivery wagons on the campus. A brief explanation
of the meaning of the bacteriological count would not be out of place here.
The bacteria per cc. means the total number of bacteria of all kinds found
in one cubic centimeter of milk. These may not always, and perhaps not
usually, be dangerous; but since milk in the udder of a clean, healthy cow
contains comparatively few bacteria; and since dirt, and especially cow
manure, contains large quantities of bacteria; and further, since bacteria
very rapidly mutiply upon standing in warm milk, —it may be assumed that
a milk with a high bacteriological count has suffered one or more of three
things: (1) gross contamination, (2) insufficient cooling, or (3) that it has
been kept too long. Thus a high bacteriological count can be used as an
indicator that something is wrong, and would necessitate immediate investiga
tions. Furthermore, the count is subject to very great variations, and the
difference of a few thousand per cc. may not be significant.
In general, we may say that 10,000 or less bacteria is excellent; over 100,
000 bacteria per cc. is very bad. 10,000 is the maximum allowed for certified
milk; while some large cities, where the milk must be shipped in from a long
distance, have established an allowable maximum, for market milk, of 500,000
bacteria per cc. In this community, however, where it is possible to deliver
milk very shortly after milking, we should expect a much lower count, possibly
not more than 10,000.
The use of the covered or partially covered milk-pail, which has recently
become universal with the dairies supplying milk to the campus, is probably
responsible for a material reduction in the average bacteriological counts.
The cover excludes a large part of the dirt which often falls from the udder
of a cow while milking.
The following extracts from Harrington and Richardson's Manual of
Practical Hygiene, are very pertinent here: "Stocking demonstrated a differ
ence of 85 per cent in the number of bacteria in l'avor of the covered pail;
and in another series, the cows being less clean, the difference was even
greater, the milk in the coverd pail yielding respectively 1/20 and 1/33 as
many as that of the open pail. . . . The part played by cow-dung in seeding
milk may readily be understood from Warrington's estimate of 165,000,000
bacteria in 1 gram of dung from a hay-fed cow. . . . Straining removes only
the larger particles of manure, hairs, straw, etc., but does not exclude the
fine particles nor the soluble portions of the dung, which pass through with
their millions of bacteria."
In regard to the chemical composition of milk, Harrington and Richard
son say:
"Milk is a solution of sugar, mineral matter and proteids, with other pro
teids and fat in suspension. Its composition is very variable, not alone as
between different species of mammalia by which it is produced, but between
different individuals of the same species . . . (however) .... The compo-

sition of cow's milk of good quality may be expressed fairly in round
numbers as follows: ,>
Fat 4.00 per cent.
Solids, not fat 9.00
Sugar .i 5.00
Proteids 3.30
Mineral matter 70
9.00
Total solids 13.00
Water 87.00
Total 100.00 per cent.
The California State Law establishes the following standard for milk,
and declares it adulterated if not conforming therewith:
"Milk is the clean lacteal secretion obtained by the complete milking of
one or more healthy cows, properly fed and kept, excluding that obtained
within fifteen (15) days before and five (5) days after calving, and contains
not less than three (3.00) per cent, of milk fat and not less than eight and
five-tenths (8.5) per cent, of solids—not fat."
In municipal laboratories tests are most often made for the amount of
fat, for adulteration by added water, or for additions of preservatives.
Fat is by far the greatest natural variable element, and therefore a low fat
does not necessarily mean the watering of the milk. Furthermore, iu some
milk the cream rises much more rapidly than in others. A good example of
this is with the Wildwood Dairy milk. After standing a short time the cream
rises very completely, and when this is skimmed off the remaining milk is very
thin in fat. Thus many unfounded complaints of the poor quality of Wild
wood milk come from the table cosumer who does not take into account the
fact that the milk may have been intercepted in the kitchen and the cream
pitcher greatly enriched at the expense of the milk pitcher.
In this investigation I have tested for fat only. Watering of milk has
occurred so rarely in this vicinity that the expense of routine testing to dis
cover this would hardly be warranted; Special tests could be made if this
practice were suspected. The use of preservatives is of no value to a dairy
that delivers within the same day after milking, and routine tests in this
vicinity are not worth the expense.

Dear Sir,
A copy of a report on the campus milk supply, prepared by the Palo
Alto Health Officer, Mr. H. O. Jenkins, for the Board of Directors of the
Students' Guild, is enclosed for your information. We wish especially to call
your attention to the following points.
(1) The milk supply as a whole is low in bacterial content, and contains
a reasonably high per cent of butter fat.
(2) Nine-tenths of the suply comes from cows which are not tuberculin
tested. All of this may, and much of it probably does, come from cows in
fected with tuberculosis.
(3). Nine tenths of the supply comes from dairies where the sanitary
conditions are graded below G5 per cent on the score-card system approved
by the U. S. Department of Agriculture.
(4). There is available at the present time a supply of high-grade milk,
from tuberculin tested cows, and from dairies where the sanitary conditions
are excellent.
(5). Roble, Madrono, the Inn, and the majority of the fraternities, soro
rities, clubs, and boarding-houses are supplied by the poorest dairies.
It has been definitely shown during the past few years that human beings
are susceptible to infection with tubercle bacilli of the bovine type. Such
infection is frequent in children, less frequent but nevertheless unquestionable
in grown persons. The source of such infection is the milk, to a lesser
extent the butter, of tuberculous cows. The most reliable method of
avoiding the dangers of such infection is the careful control of dairy cattle,
and our chief method of doing this is by means of the strict enforcement of
the tuberculin test. This "test" is not yet enforced by law in California, but
is being voluntarily carried out by many conscientious dairymen. The prob
lem of protection, therefore, resolves itself chiefly into one of wisdom on the
part of the consumer in choosing the milk of dairies in which the precaution
of cattle testing is observed.
We request you to assist us in our evorts to protect the health of the
community. You can do this by the use, and demanding the supply, of the
highest quality of milk obtainable.

within fifteen (15) days before and five (5) days after calving, and contains
not less than three (3.00) per cent, of milk fat and not less than eight and
five-tenths (8.5) per cent, of solids—not fat."
In municipal laboratories tests are most often made for the amount of
fat, for adulteration by added water, or for additions of preservatives.
Fat is by far the greatest natural variable element, and therefore a low fat
does not necessarily mean the watering of the milk. Furthermore, iu some
milk the cream rises much more rapidly than in others. A good example of
this is with the Wildwood Dairy milk. After standing a short time the cream
rises very completely, and when this is skimmed off the remaining milk is very
thin in fat. Thus many unfounded complaints of the poor quality of Wild
wood milk come from the table cosumer who does not take into account the
fact that the milk may have been intercepted in the kitchen and the cream
pitcher greatly enriched at the expense of the milk pitcher.
In this investigation I have tested for fat only. Watering of milk has
occurred so rarely in this vicinity that the expense of routine testing to dis
cover this would hardly be warranted; Special tests could be made if this
practice were suspected. The use of preservatives is of no value to a dairy
that delivers within the same day after milking, and routine tests in this
vicinity are not worth the expense.

Dear Sir,
A copy of a report on the campus milk supply, prepared by the Palo
Alto Health Officer, Mr. H. O. Jenkins, for the Board of Directors of the
Students' Guild, is enclosed for your information. We wish especially to call
your attention to the following points.
(1) The milk supply as a whole is low in bacterial content, and contains
a reasonably high per cent of butter fat.
(2) Nine-tenths of the suply comes from cows which are not tuberculin
tested. All of this may, and much of it probably does, come from cows in
fected with tuberculosis.
(3). Nine tenths of the supply comes from dairies where the sanitary
conditions are graded below G5 per cent on the score-card system approved
by the U. S. Department of Agriculture.
(4). There is available at the present time a supply of high-grade milk,
from tuberculin tested cows, and from dairies where the sanitary conditions
are excellent.
(5). Roble, Madrono, the Inn, and the majority of the fraternities, soro
rities, clubs, and boarding-houses are supplied by the poorest dairies.
It has been definitely shown during the past few years that human beings
are susceptible to infection with tubercle bacilli of the bovine type. Such
infection is frequent in children, less frequent but nevertheless unquestionable
in grown persons. The source of such infection is the milk, to a lesser
extent the butter, of tuberculous cows. The most reliable method of
avoiding the dangers of such infection is the careful control of dairy cattle,
and our chief method of doing this is by means of the strict enforcement of
the tuberculin test. This "test" is not yet enforced by law in California, but
is being voluntarily carried out by many conscientious dairymen. The prob
lem of protection, therefore, resolves itself chiefly into one of wisdom on the
part of the consumer in choosing the milk of dairies in which the precaution
of cattle testing is observed.
We request you to assist us in our evorts to protect the health of the
community. You can do this by the use, and demanding the supply, of the
highest quality of milk obtainable.
The detailed score-cards of the dairies may be examined at the Guild
office, Room 10, Chemistry building.
THE STUDENTS' GUILD.
[COPY]
Palo Alto, Cal., March 22, 1912,
To the Honorable The Board of Directors of the Students' Guild,
Stanford University, California.
I submit herewith a report upon the milk supply of the Stanford Univer
sity Campus.
Under the heading of Milk Statistics I have given a list of the dairies
supplying milk to the campus, together with the present size of the dairies,
the amount of milk sold, the territories covered by the dairies, and the time
of delivery. These are facts, the knowledge of which is clearly necessary in
an intelligent supervision of the milk supply.
It will be seen that there are now four dairies, delivering a total of
about GGO quarts of milk per day on the campus. One other dairy has recently
ceased coining upon the campus; while a sixth dairy (of three cows) has
never sold any milk, but is mentioned here only because it has offered milk
for sale on one day during the present month.
I have also given the dairy scores and bacteriological and chemical tests
and the statement of the tuberculin test.

liie dairy scares are further given in detail on supplementary sheets
and, as will be seen, afford a measure for rating the dairies on general sani
tation. 100 points are given for perfect, and roughly speaking we may say
that 'JO to 100 is very good, above 75 fair, and below 50 very poor. These
points are divided among the different features of the dairy, such as health
of cows; the construction of stables, utensils and milk-room; the methods
of keeping the cows, stables, utensils and milk-room clean; and the methods
of handling the milk. A weight of 40 points is given to the equipment and 60
points to the methods used, on account of the greater importance of cleanly
methods over that of line equipment. Each feature is further weighted accord
ing to its greater or lesser importance as a health factor. This form of score
card is one that has been recommended for general use by the U. S. Depart
ment of Agriculture, and is now used by a large number of cities in their
milk inspection.
The bacteriological counts and fat determinations were made from samples
taken by myself from the delivery wagons on the campus. A brief explanation
of the meaning of the bacteriological count would not be out of place here.
The bacteria per cc. means the total number of bacteria of all kinds found
in one cubic centimeter of milk. These may not always, and perhaps not
usually, be dangerous; but since milk in the udder of a clean, healthy cow
contains comparatively few bacteria; and since dirt, and especially cow
manure, contains large quantities of bacteria; and further, since bacteria
very rapidly mutiply upon standing in warm milk, —it may be assumed that
a milk with a high bacteriological count has suffered one or more of three
things: (1) gross contamination, (2) insufficient cooling, or (3) that it has
been kept too long. Thus a high bacteriological count can be used as an
indicator that something is wrong, and would necessitate immediate investiga
tions. Furthermore, the count is subject to very great variations, and the
difference of a few thousand per cc. may not be significant.
In general, we may say that 10,000 or less bacteria is excellent; over 100,
000 bacteria per cc. is very bad. 10,000 is the maximum allowed for certified
milk; while some large cities, where the milk must be shipped in from a long
distance, have established an allowable maximum, for market milk, of 500,000
bacteria per cc. In this community, however, where it is possible to deliver
milk very shortly after milking, we should expect a much lower count, possibly
not more than 10,000.
The use of the covered or partially covered milk-pail, which has recently
become universal with the dairies supplying milk to the campus, is probably
responsible for a material reduction in the average bacteriological counts.
The cover excludes a large part of the dirt which often falls from the udder
of a cow while milking.
The following extracts from Harrington and Richardson's Manual of
Practical Hygiene, are very pertinent here: "Stocking demonstrated a differ
ence of 85 per cent in the number of bacteria in l'avor of the covered pail;
and in another series, the cows being less clean, the difference was even
greater, the milk in the coverd pail yielding respectively 1/20 and 1/33 as
many as that of the open pail. . . . The part played by cow-dung in seeding
milk may readily be understood from Warrington's estimate of 165,000,000
bacteria in 1 gram of dung from a hay-fed cow. . . . Straining removes only
the larger particles of manure, hairs, straw, etc., but does not exclude the
fine particles nor the soluble portions of the dung, which pass through with
their millions of bacteria."
In regard to the chemical composition of milk, Harrington and Richard
son say:
"Milk is a solution of sugar, mineral matter and proteids, with other pro
teids and fat in suspension. Its composition is very variable, not alone as
between different species of mammalia by which it is produced, but between
different individuals of the same species . . . (however) .... The compo-

The California State Law establishes the following standard for milk,
and declares it adulterated if not conforming therewith:
"Milk is the clean lacteal secretion obtained by the complete milking of
one or more healthy cows, properly fed and kept, excluding that obtained
within fifteen (15) days before and five (5) days after calving, and contains
not less than three (3.00) per cent, of milk fat and not less than eight and
