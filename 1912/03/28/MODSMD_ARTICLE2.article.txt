tacle from the bank of the lake near
the boathouse, under the canopy of
rows of red lanterns.
A surprise was sprung by the com

red fire, which suddenly burst into
view at the fountain far out on the
lake. The insignia of the Junior class
glowed brightly the entire evening.

Glee club rendered an entertaining
program of Stanford music and popu

much to enhance the beauty of the
spectacle, as the light shells circled
about the set-pieces operated on floats,
ket disappeared in the lake, the Stan
ford hymn brought the festivities to a
close.
