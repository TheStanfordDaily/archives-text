# California Team on Campus.
## 
### 
The California Varsity arrived on the
campus this afternoon and worked-out
on the diamond. They expressed them
selves as being much pleased with
the new field.

On the wall at the foot of the rub
bing tables in the Chicago gymnasium
is the motto, "For Chicago I Will."
The athlete being prepared for con
test cannot avoid seeing and being
inspired by the inscription on the wall.
