# STANFORD--WASHINGTON WILL DEBATE TOMORROW
## TRIANGULAR LEAGUE CONTESTS SUPREMACY. Tincher and Worthy to Speak Against Washington at Homeâ€”Close and Leib at Eugene. 
### 
While Stanford society amuses it
self and others at the Junior Prom to
morrow evening, all those without the
charmed circle, "roughs" and "high
brows" alike, will gather in Assembly
Hall to listen to the second Tri-State
debate, between Stanford and Was'n
ngton. This date was agreed upon last
While Stanford society amuses it
year as the time for the annual tri
angular contests, and in spite of stren
uous efforts on the part of the Sfan
ford authorities it was found impos
sible to make a change. Hence the
conflict with the Junior Prom.
The subject to be debated tomorrow
evening is "Resolved, That judges
shall be subject to recall, constitution
ality granted.'' Stanford will be repre
sented by E. E. Tincher, '12, and A. E.
Worthy, '15, while the northern speak
ers are G. E. Hoover, '12, and R. S.
Raudebush, '13. A. F. Coyle, '15, is the
Stanford alternate. Only two o r tho
judges have as yet been agreed upon.
The men who will decide the forersic
fate of the two Universities are Profes
sor Boke, head of the Law department
of the University of California, and
Professor A. G. Paetaw, a member of
the History faculty at the institution
across the bay. President David Starr
Jordan will preside tomorrow evening.
At the same moment that the Stan
ford orators are presenting the nega
tive of this question at home, two other
Cardinal speakers will be arguing the
affirmative against the University of
Oregon at Eugene. C. C. Close, '14, and
K. E. Leib, '13, are Stanford's "travel
ling representatives." R. W. Stewart,
15, is alternate on this team. Speakers
from the two northern universities
will clash at Seattle and the school
obtaining two decisions will be The
victor of the triangular contests.
Prospects Bright For Victory.
Hard work has been the rule for
the Stanford debaters all through the
period of preparation for the contests,
and chances are bright for victories at
home and abroad tomorrow evening.
Tincher, Leib and Close are experi
enced in Stanford debating. Tiotii of
the former have appeared in inter
collegiate forensic contests, while
Close has the advantage of having de
bated the same question previously, in
the recent Freshmen-Sophomore de
bate.
