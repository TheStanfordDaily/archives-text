# "GIRL AND THE VOICE" TO BE GIVEN TONIGHT
## SCORES FOR CLEVER OPERA ARE PUT ON SALE. Show Promises to be Great Success.â€”Songs, Dances and Choruses Are Pleasing. 
### 
Scores for the 1913 Junior opera
"The Girl and the Voice," containing
all the song hits of the entire opera
j with the words for each, have been
placed on sale at the Bookstore and
|at Albee's in Palo Alto. Two songs
which will be sung this evening are
not found in the book owing to the
fact that they are 011 inserts snow
bound somewhere between here and
Chicago. All those purchasing the
books will be given the inserts as soon
as they arrive on the campus.
With every line, song and dance let
ter perfect, the performance this even
ing promises to be an unusual success.
Twenty catchy numbers will fill the
hearts of the Stanford theatre goers
with joy. An almost equal number of
dances of unusual difficulty and finish
should make them sit up and take no
tice. Snappy choruses and chic cos
tumes all interspersed with clever
lines and dialogue will combine to
keep the audience 011 the edge of ex
pectancy for three acts.
The opera is the work of E. E.
Chase, ex-'ll, and W. S. Wilson, '13,
who did the music and P. Eliel, '13,
who wrote the book and lyrics. There
is an excellent variation in both songs
and lines. The songs are distributed
throughout the opera with respect to
the times in which they have been
written. In the book there is an al
ternation of comedy and slightly more
serious scenes which gives a pleasing
and agreeable contrast throughout.
Although there are many good seats
still left for the second performance,
it is expected that these will sell rap
idly after the first presentation <0-
night.
