# WEAKENED TEAM WILL FACE SOUTHERN MEN
## BEST CARDINAL RUNNERS WILL NOT RUN TO-MORROW. Captain Coleman and McKee Still on Sick Listâ€”U.S.C. Has Strong Athletes. 
### 
With several of the best Varsity men
enjo>ing a vacation for the day, Stan
ford will send a weakened team against
the University of Southern California
tomorrow. The southerners are bring
ing a strong aggregation but with the
second and third place men of the
Cardinal in fine trim the competition
will furnish a fitting event for Junior
day.
Captain T. L. Coleman, '12, and P. B.
McKee, '14, will again be absent from
their events. Murray is to compete in
mile and Fletcher, Worthy and 8011-
nett are to run the half again. The
Varsity two milers will take things
easy after their severe workout on
Tuesday. Campbell will enter the 100
yard dash and the hurdles.
Throop, the U. S. C. captain, is the
main hope of the southerners in the
sprints. With the absence of Coleman
and McKee, the visiting leader should
annex the furlong but may find a snag
in the speedy Campbell. Throop will
also run a lap in the relay. Hansen
is Throop's teammate in the sprints.
U. S. C. Strong iu Distances.
Torrance, Smith and Tipton are a
trio >112 fast performers in the distance

reliance in the mile. Swigget has been
showing to advantage in the two mile
and with Dodge, Bevier and Price out
will find the pace lighter than he
would otherwise.
Hodge and Davis are the best of the
U. S. C. quarter milers. Kelly, the
Orange hurdler, and Freeman are the
southern representatives in the timber
topping events.
Earle and Chaffee are not in the
class of the Cardinal high jumpers but
the former should do better in the
broad. Watkins and Campbell are en
tered in the pole vault. Both men do
better than eleven feet. In the weights
Kelly is the foremost heaver for U. S.
C.

U. S. C. quarter milers. Kelly, the
Orange hurdler, and Freeman are the
southern representatives in the timber

better than eleven feet. In the weights
Kelly is the foremost heaver for U. S.
C.

With several of the best Varsity men
enjo>ing a vacation for the day, Stan
ford will send a weakened team against
the University of Southern California
tomorrow. The southerners are bring
ing a strong aggregation but with the
second and third place men of the
Cardinal in fine trim the competition
will furnish a fitting event for Junior
day.
Captain T. L. Coleman, '12, and P. B.
McKee, '14, will again be absent from
their events. Murray is to compete in
mile and Fletcher, Worthy and 8011-
nett are to run the half again. The
Varsity two milers will take things
easy after their severe workout on
Tuesday. Campbell will enter the 100
yard dash and the hurdles.
Throop, the U. S. C. captain, is the
main hope of the southerners in the
sprints. With the absence of Coleman
and McKee, the visiting leader should
annex the furlong but may find a snag
in the speedy Campbell. Throop will
also run a lap in the relay. Hansen
is Throop's teammate in the sprints.
U. S. C. Strong iu Distances.
Torrance, Smith and Tipton are a
trio >112 fast performers in the distance
races Murray will be the Cardinal's
reliance in the mile. Swigget has been
showing to advantage in the two mile
and with Dodge, Bevier and Price out
will find the pace lighter than he
would otherwise.
