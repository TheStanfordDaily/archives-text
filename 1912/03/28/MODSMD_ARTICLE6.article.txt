# BASEBALL PLAYERS OUT BECAUSE OF ACCIDENTS
## Gilfillan, Noble, Terry, Henshaw and Childs Are Suffering From Recent Injuries. 
### 
On the eve of the first game of the
California-Stanford baseball series the
Cardinal team is threatened with an
eleventh-hour shakeup on account of
injuries. Five of the men are now
nursing injured hands and ankles.
Captain Gilfillan is in an extremely
bad plight as the result of a broken
finger on the left hand. Gilfillan has
been nursing a bad hand all season,
while the final injury came in practice
Tuesday afternoon.
Noble, the leading candidate for the
center field position, is at present on
crutches. Sliding into the plate during
practice, Tuesday, the fielder severely
wrenched bis ankle. Noble's injury is
the most serious one of any of the
players and stands a good chance of
keeping him out of Saturday's game.
Terry, the fixture at short, is suffer
ing from a strain and although in
dulging in light practice, is under the
doctor's care.
Henshaw, Scofield's mate at catch
ing, is nursing a split finger on his
throwing-hand which is keeping him
out of hard work.
Childs, a strong candidate for one
of the field positions, injured his hand
in practice the same afternoon that the
other men were hurt.
