# LAVENDER AND GREEN ARE PROM COLORS
## MILE OF SMILAX TRANSFORMS ENCINA CLUBROOM. Supper Will be Served During Ninth and Twelfth Dances—Musical Program Announced. 
### 
A mile and a quarter of smilax—
this describes in few words the decora
tion of Encina Clubroom for the 1913
Junior Prom. The color scheme is
lavender and green, and a combination
of shaded lights and smilax has work
ed it out very effectively in the decora
tions. Old and oft-tried schemes of
decoration were abandoned, and the
resulting impression justifies the
change.
The supper, which is in charge of
Ozier, will be served in the second
floor halls. Greatly improved facilities
for serving will so expedite the work
on the second floor that this supper
should set a new standard for serving
a large crowd.
The ninth and twelfth dances are to
be shortened, and at a roll of drums
the couples to be served will leave the
Clubroom. During the supper interval
there will be a number of dances off
the program. Holders of odd numbers
will be served during the ninth dance
while the even numbers will wait until
the twelfth.
