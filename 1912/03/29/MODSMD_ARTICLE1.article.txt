# HORINE BREAKS A WORLD'S RECORD
## BIG "S" MAN AGAIN WINS INTERNATIONAL FAME BETTERS ALL OTHER MARKS BY HALF INCH. U.S.C. Loses Meet, 86½ to 35½ Stanford Record For Hammer Broken. 
### 
Shattering the world's record in the
high jump made over seventeen years
ago, G. L. Horine, '13. today became
the champion in his event with a won
derful leap of 0 feet G 1-8 inches.
This betters by one-half an inch the
mark made by Sweeney of New York in
1595. Horine cleared the bar with re
markable ease and the unfavorable
weather conditions which prevailed
seemed to have little effect on the
Stanford jumper. ■
Horine has performed consistently
ever since registering in college. In
his Freshman year he won the high
jump in the Varsity meet at 6 feet 7-8
inchetij and took first in his Freshman
meet with a jump of 5 feet 10 inches.
Last season lie tied with Beeson of
California at G feet 3 inches.
But a week ago the Stanford jumper
established a new world's intercollegi
ate record by clearing the bar at G
4 3-4. No limit seems to be placed on
his climbing capacity.
