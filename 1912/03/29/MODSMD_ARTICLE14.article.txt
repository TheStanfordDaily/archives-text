# BELIEVES BLUE AND GOLD TEAM IS BETTER NINE.

### 
The following are the views of R. R.
Randall of the Daily Californian.
California's Varsity nine which will
lie sent Saturday afternoon against the
Cardinal will include in its line-up six
veteran players claiming experience in
former intercollegiate ball games.
The personnel of this year's Varsity
considered man for man presents a
team much stronger than the one
which took the field in 1911. Stoner

behind the plate still retains his effec
tive fast throw to second, and his stick
work exhibits marked improvement.
Forker, the other half of the veteran
tried battery which will oppose Stan
ford, has kept his control well in
hand throughout the season.
Dodson a new acquisition at the first
sack fields his position with ease.
Goodwin who covers the key stone
sack and Rubke at short show a sure
ness which was lacking in their work
last year. Captain Allen, protecting
third base, although playing a ragged
game up to a few weeks ago, has re
gained his old form and with his
"quick baseball head" is an invaluable
asset to the infield.
The outfield, Coane, Ford, and Shep
herd, are a fast, speedy combination,
sure on their feet and with an envi
able record at the bat.
