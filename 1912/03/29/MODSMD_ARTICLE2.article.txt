# PETERS ANNOUNCES VARSITY TEAM TO MEET CALIFORNIA
## ANNUAL BASEBALL SERIES BEGINS TOMORROW.—--BATTERIES TO FACE BLUE AND GOLD NOT YET NAMED. 
### 
i With a team of six veterans under
the guidance of Captain S. W. Gilfillan,
j'l2, Stanford expects to christen her
new baseball field with the first inter
' collegiate victory on Saturday.
The team picked by Coach Peters,
'12, is the best possible one that could
| be obtained from the material at hand,
land, no matter what the outcome of the
Stanford-California series, too much
praise cannot be given Coach Peters.
| This is the second season of the non-
I paid, undergraduate coaching system
land if results can be obtained from it
I they are sure to appear during the
coming series.
Taken as a whole, the Stanford
team is a fast and fair batting nine.
Compared to the l!)1l Varsity they are
weaker at (he bat although a far bet-
I ter fielding team. The team's average
j is .218 with %. Terry, '14, at the top of
I the list.
At California the conditions are just
j the reverse. Their team is a hard hit-
I ting one, with an average of .243.
Three men, Coane, Shepherd and Dod
son, are close to the .300 mark. Many
of their games have been won by heavy
| hitting and the successful working of
I the squeeze-play. The art of bunting
is one of the fine points that has been
: drilled to a nicety into the Berkeley
| players, in the field the Blue and
Gold men are not the equals of the
I Cardinal, who have pulled off twelve
I double plays to their opponents three
[during the present season.
Summing up, it can lie said that the
baseball conditions are just the reverse

at I he two Universities from what they
were last year. At that time the Ber
kel jy men had the better fielding team
wh !e the Cardinal had the better bat
tii 1 < nine.
>I»: ( hange Line-up.
!"he Cardinal team announced today
-.lable to change either before or
during the game owing to the injuries
of two of tlir> regulars. Captain Gil
fillan will take the field on third, if
his hand will allow. If this is impos
sible either Gault or Argabrite will
cover the bag. Noble, who is stili suf
fering from a torn ligament is expect
ed to take his place in center. In case
he is unable to do this, Childs will
play in his place.
Tomorrow's pitcher will not be
known until the time of play. The
Freshmen Howe and Couch will both
warm up before the game and the one
who shows the best will start the
game. Scofleld will catch in this first
contest.
Records of the team members fol
low :
Two Freshmen Pitchers.
A. J. Howe and .T. I). Couch are the
two Freshmen pitchers who have
worked so well all season. Howe is
Ihe coolest and headiest of the two,
while Couch's forte lies in speed. The
latter is the better batter.
M. B. Henshaw, '12. and F. A. Sco
field, '12, are the Varsity catchers.
Scofleld hits the best while Henshaw
lias the arm. Henshaw played one
