# PETERS ANNOUNCES VARSITY TEAM TO MEET CALIFORNIA
## ANNUAL BASEBALL SERIES BEGINS TOMORROW.—--BATTERIES TO FACE BLUE AND GOLD NOT YET NAMED. 
### 
i With a team of six veterans under
the guidance of Captain S. W. Gilfillan,
j'l2, Stanford expects to christen her
new baseball field with the first inter
' collegiate victory on Saturday.
The team picked by Coach Peters,
'12, is the best possible one that could
| be obtained from the material at hand,
land, no matter what the outcome of the
Stanford-California series, too much
praise cannot be given Coach Peters.
| This is the second season of the non-
I paid, undergraduate coaching system
land if results can be obtained from it
I they are sure to appear during the
coming series.
Taken as a whole, the Stanford
team is a fast and fair batting nine.
Compared to the l!)1l Varsity they are
weaker at (he bat although a far bet-
I ter fielding team. The team's average
j is .218 with %. Terry, '14, at the top of
I the list.
At California the conditions are just
j the reverse. Their team is a hard hit-
I ting one, with an average of .243.
Three men, Coane, Shepherd and Dod
son, are close to the .300 mark. Many
of their games have been won by heavy
| hitting and the successful working of
I the squeeze-play. The art of bunting
is one of the fine points that has been
: drilled to a nicety into the Berkeley
| players, in the field the Blue and
Gold men are not the equals of the
I Cardinal, who have pulled off twelve
I double plays to their opponents three
[during the present season.
Summing up, it can lie said that the
baseball conditions are just the reverse

at I he two Universities from what they
were last year. At that time the Ber
kel jy men had the better fielding team
wh !e the Cardinal had the better bat
tii 1 < nine.
>I»: ( hange Line-up.
!"he Cardinal team announced today
-.lable to change either before or
during the game owing to the injuries
of two of tlir> regulars. Captain Gil
fillan will take the field on third, if
his hand will allow. If this is impos
sible either Gault or Argabrite will
cover the bag. Noble, who is stili suf
fering from a torn ligament is expect
ed to take his place in center. In case
he is unable to do this, Childs will
play in his place.
Tomorrow's pitcher will not be
known until the time of play. The
Freshmen Howe and Couch will both
warm up before the game and the one
who shows the best will start the
game. Scofleld will catch in this first
contest.
Records of the team members fol
low :
Two Freshmen Pitchers.
A. J. Howe and .T. I). Couch are the
two Freshmen pitchers who have
worked so well all season. Howe is
Ihe coolest and headiest of the two,
while Couch's forte lies in speed. The
latter is the better batter.
M. B. Henshaw, '12. and F. A. Sco
field, '12, are the Varsity catchers.
Scofleld hits the best while Henshaw
lias the arm. Henshaw played one

game in the Held in last year's inter
collegiate series. Scofleld was a sub
stitute pitcher in 19U9.
M. J. Obear, •'l2, at lirst, played in
center field on the victorious 1910
Varsity. Obear has been developed
into a good first sacker and is one of
the fastest men on the team.
L. Cass, '13, is playing second-base
for the second time this year. Cass is
a good hitter and is covering his bag
to a nicety. The amount of ginger
that this player displays is only one
of the many proofs that he is about
the hardest worker on the team.
Captain Gilfillan is playing third
base, and, considering bad luck with
his hands, has been playing a good
game. Gilfillan's hitting in the late
practice games is a very favorable sign
of what he expects to do in the Big
Games.
Terry—Ball Player.
Z. Terry, '14, is again playing short
stop and continues to play his heady
and perfect fielding game. Terry is
probably the most finished ball player
on the squad and is leading the team
at the bat.
W. M. Argabrite, '13, won out in the
fight for left field after a long tryout.
This is the Stanford high-jumper's
first chance on the ball team and was
won by his ability to hit the ball.
R. M. Noble, '12, is playing center
field this year for the first time.
Xoble is one of the fastest men on the
team and besides being a sure fielder
is a good hitter.
H. A. Beeger, '13, is again playing
right field and fielding in a better man
ner than last year. Beeger's improve
ment at the bat in the last three prac
tice games has placed him second in
the batting averages.
Substitutes.
L. Childs, '12, J. J. Jones, Ml, M. F.
Enderle, '12, F. S. Gault, '14, and A. J.
Halm, '14, are players who will be
ready to enter the game if called upon.
