# "GIRL AND THE VOICE" REVIEWED BY CRITIC
## DANCING AND INDIVIDUAL STARS SAVE PLAY. Music of Opera Proves Clever and Catchy but the Plot is Slender. 
### 
It was inevitable that "The Girl and
the Voice" should he compared with
"The Uvernian Princess." It was al
most inevitable that it should suffer
by the comparison. It did.
"Wasn't it fine?" I heard a girl ask
her escort, —lie was one of the weak
sisters by the way. "Yes, but it
wasn't as good as last year's," he
answered. That is the severest criti
cism that any body should be heard to
make. For last night saw the second

there was an occasional hitch or halt.
Some of the Dutch Girls failed to keep
in time with the rest; one or two of
the men in the chorus of "No Place
Quite Like Stanford" seemed to be
suffering from stiff necks—was that
the result of putting a rough or two
into the unaccustomed pillory of a
white collar?—and once or twice the
principals had to be prompted from
the wings. But that was all in the
evening's work, and we were willing
to overlook what were only minor
faults in our enjoyment and apprecia
tion of the successful whole.
Miss Maloney, in the title role, was
all that could lie desired as "The
Voice." Anyone who has ever heard
her could have predicted that. But as
"Th" Girl"—well, she was not quite
