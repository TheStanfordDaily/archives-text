# "GIRL AND THE VOICE" REVIEWED BY CRITIC
## DANCING AND INDIVIDUAL STARS SAVE PLAY. Music of Opera Proves Clever and Catchy but the Plot is Slender. 
### 
It was inevitable that "The Girl and
the Voice" should he compared with
"The Uvernian Princess." It was al
most inevitable that it should suffer
by the comparison. It did.
"Wasn't it fine?" I heard a girl ask
her escort, —lie was one of the weak
sisters by the way. "Yes, but it
wasn't as good as last year's," he
answered. That is the severest criti
cism that any body should be heard to
make. For last night saw the second
of what we hope may prove to be a
long string of successful Junior Operas
—home made, like mother's pies, and
by the same token, quite as palatable.
We are, I think, too apt to judge our
local productions by professional
standards. That is in itself, perhaps,
a tribute to our local stage But
measure it how you will "The Girl and
the Voice" was an undoubted success.
It was typical musical comedy. By
that I mean that the plot was but the
slenderest of threads on which to hang
a series of songs and choruses. That
is one of the most frequent criticisms
which I have heard, and at the same
time one of the most deserved. The
opera was not a unit. It was only
a series of disconnected incidents.
Catchy Music.
But the music was clever and catchy;
the parts, on the whole, well taken;
and the choruses pretty and, for the
most part, well trained. To be sure
there was an occasional hitch or halt.
Some of the Dutch Girls failed to keep
in time with the rest; one or two of
the men in the chorus of "No Place
Quite Like Stanford" seemed to be
suffering from stiff necks—was that
the result of putting a rough or two
into the unaccustomed pillory of a
white collar?—and once or twice the
principals had to be prompted from
the wings. But that was all in the
evening's work, and we were willing
to overlook what were only minor
faults in our enjoyment and apprecia
tion of the successful whole.
Miss Maloney, in the title role, was
all that could lie desired as "The
Voice." Anyone who has ever heard
her could have predicted that. But as
"Th" Girl"—well, she was not quite
convincing. To H. B. McGuire, who
took the opposite lead, perhaps a simi
lar criticism will apply with equal
justice. He has a fine voice and sings
well, hut he, like Miss Maloney, has
not mastered the trick of acting quite
naturally.
J. H. Forbes was as graceful as ever,
and Miss Lois de Vilbiss, who danced
with him, must be accounted a find in
local musical comedy. Probably the
catchiest bit of work of the entire
evening was the chorus "Now You
Know We Know,"in which Forbes
and Miss de Vilbiss shared the honors
with Lewis and Miss Harrier.
Lewis is Star.
L. W. Lewis, as "Fingy" Murphy,
was easily the hit of the evening, it
would be hard to praise his work of
last night too highly. His comedy
work as the slangy baseball manager,
with an ever ready line of homely
philosophy couched in the language of
the diamond, was really professional.
B. H. Lasky made the most of a
rather slender part, which was more
than J. H. Mathews could do; and E.
E. Manning saved some very weak
lines from absolute failure by his ex
cellent Kolb and Dill German. "Brick"
Spence and Miss Coleman did the usual
musical comedy stuff in their usual
easy way.
No criticism would be complete
without a mention of the really clever
work of Miss Basset who played the
difficult part of the female grind to
the queens' taste —and also to the
roughs'—if we may judge by the ap
plause. Her song, "Gee, I Wish I
Were Pretty" had a dash of originality
in it that was very welcome.
A couple of things could be im
proved before Saturday's production.
The Fourth of July speech dragged
somewhat and could be cut down to ad
vantage; and the changing colored
lights on several choruses should be
improved or done away with. Also
some of the choruses were under
trained. bu of course it is too late to
remember that.
Anyway it was all a success, a big
success. Everybody says so. Hut —and
perhaps it is not quite fair to make the
comparison—it wasn't as good as "The
Uvernian Princess."
