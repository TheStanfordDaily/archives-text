Tomorrow, Stanford and California
will meet in the first game of the

twenty-first annual Inter
collegiate baseball series.
The Stanford team this

year has had the advantage of excel
lent coaching and every player is well
versed in the intricacies of the game.
The team has worked hard and ex
cept for some unfortunate eleventh
hour injuries will enter the game in
top notch condition.
We are placing a great deal of con
fidence in the 1912 team, but if they
win it will be only after a stiff con
test, for the Blue and Gold squad can
always be depended upon to make a
good fight. With a little "baseball
luck,'' however, Stanford will capture
the series.
