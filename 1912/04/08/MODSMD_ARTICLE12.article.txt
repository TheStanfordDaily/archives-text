In this issue Captain R. H. Seward
announces the personnel of the Var
sity crew. It is doubtful whether the
average undergraduate appre-
Spirit. ciates the suppression of self
and the great sacrifice made
by the oarsmen in the course of a
training season. The nine men who
sit in the Varsity shell and the sub
stitutes, who train as faithfully and
work as hard without the same reward,
give more in time and energy to main
tain their sport than do the followers
of any other activity. For good, clean
sportsmanship the laurels go to the
crew men, and the 1912 Varsity easily
measures up to the Stanford standard
in every respect.
