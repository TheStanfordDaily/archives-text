Tennis men can feel elated over the
showing made by the Stanford repre-

sentatives in the intercol
legiate matches. For the
first time in five years a

Cardinal team has defeated California
upon the courts, and unless the univer
sity across the hay secures another
such wonderful combination as the
Long brothers, it looks as if we will
see a succession of victories in this
branch of athletics.
