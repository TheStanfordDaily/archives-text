## TEN BUNGLES LAID TO THE CARDINAL PLAYERS. California Plays Better Ball and Wins Contest in the First Two Innings. 
### 
Errors, ten of them, more than the
Varsity and its opponents have com
bined to make in any preliminary prac
tice game of the season, cost Stanford
the tirst game in the Intercollegiate
baseball series on Saturday, March 30.
The ten errors, four of them in the
outlield, proved too much of a stum
bling block on the way to victory.
Stanford went into the game in a
somewhat crippled condition. Captain
Gilfillan was forced to remain on the
bench because of a broken finger while
Noble was just able to move around in
the center field.
Couch started the game in the box
and looked like a winner in the first
inning when he struck out two. But
bis troubles began and ended in the
next frame when three runs were
scored on an outfield error, a hit, a
base on bulls, a sacrifice, and his own
two errors.
Hour Pitches Good Hall.
At the beginning of the third Howe
was putin the box and but for a bad
start in his first inning pitched good
ball, in this frame three hits, three
errors, a base on balls, and a sacrifice
scored three runs and gave California
a (1-0 lead. The Blue and Gold added
another run in the fifth and their
last tally in the eighth inning.
Up to the sixth frame Stanford had
obtained but three scattered hits with
out a man reaching second base. In
this inning Obear got his second hit
o the day, went to second on a wild
p tch. stole third, but got no farther.
the lucky seventh the Cardinal
broke into the run column. Beeger
singled and went to second when Noble
walked. Scofield then hit to right,
scoring Beeger, while both runners
advanced on the fielder's error. Noble
later scored when Goodwin juggled
I-lowe's grounder.
But the big excitement came in the
eighth when three runs were register
ed. Terry and Cass walked in-succes
sion and advanced on a passed ball.
Beeger hit to the California captain
who fumbled the ball and allowed Ter
ry to score. Gault scored Cass on a
sacrifice fly while Noble brought in the
last run with a single to center.
