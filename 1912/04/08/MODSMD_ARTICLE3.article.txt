# CAPTAIN SEWARD ANNOUNCES FRESHMAN AND VARSITY CREWS
## FEW SURPRISES IN NAMING OF OARSMEN.---FRESHMAN BOAT ONE OF BEST THAT EVER REPRESENTED CARDINAL. 
### 
Crew Captain R. H. Seward, '12, an
nounced this afternoon at Redwood the
Varsity and Freshman crews which
will row against California and Wash
i igto:i next Saturday. The Varsity
crew will be composed of the follow
ing men: R. W. Olmsted, '13, bow; C.
H. Beal, '13, No. 2; C. Smith, '11, No.
3; F. W. Watkins, '14, No. 4; R. F.
Duryea, '13, No. 5; F. W. Wickman,
'14, No. (>; R. H. Seward, '12. No. 7;
.1. F. Partridge, '12, stroke; F. L.
Guerena, '11, coxswain; and the eight
men who will sit in the Freshman boat
are: B. D. Sinclair, bow; J. S. .Teffers,
No. 2; G. H. Jacomini, No. 3; E. B.
Wolford, No. 1; G. VI v - Vi.
F. E. Relim, No. 6; I. M. Hulsman, No.
7; F. O. Olmsted, stroke, and L. F.
Reinemann, coxswain.
From the bow to the coxswain's seat
these two crews are in all probability
the best that have ever been turned
out at Stanford. The Freshman eight
has made a wonderful showing
throughout the entire year and is gen
erally considered by the Coaching
Committee to be the equal of the
famous 1912 Freshman crew, which
was the ideal in Freshman boats up
to this time. The Varsity boat would
probably compare favorably with any
eight-oared crew in the country to
day. For power, strength, and form,
they are as fine a lot of men as ever
stepped in a, shell to represent the
Cardinal on tlie water. Considering
the fact that the crews are practically
self-coached, and that none but under
graduates have taken a part in their
training they stand as a shining ex
ample of the success of the under
graduate coaching system.

it is probable that there has never
been such a well-conditioned group of
oarsmen as those which will take the
water on Saturday to represent the
| Cardinal. But little trouble has been
experienced this year with sore hands
among the Varsity men and the Fresh
men are altogether in fine fettle. The
men uave been taking long condition
ing rows every other day and wind
and muscle are in the best of shape.
Strong Freshman Boat.
Throughout the entire season the
Freshmen have been showing un
usual aptitpde for the sport. During
the last few weeks of training, since
they have acquired the form and could
devo e more or their energies to pull,
they have been rowing the Varsity
close races over the two mile course,
and lave often held the older and more
experienced crew for almost the en<
tire distance. The method of rowing
tbes- 1 races this year is an innovation.
v e Varsity boat starts at the three
! . •< mark on the surveyed course and
boat waits at the two
j 'fl| point. When the Varsity boat is
H>st up to the Freshman shell the
given by the coxswain of the
Varsity boat. The Freshmen start and
by Ihe time the Varsity shell is along
side are under full way. The two
boats then row to the finish of the two
mile course. This gives both crews
an opportunity to race over their full
distance.
Varsity Boat Has Many Veterans.
With three veterans of the 1911
victorious Varsity crew, one substi
tute on last year's Varsity, one veteran
of the 1910 victorious Varsity, two
members of the winning 1914 crew,
and a member of the championship
1911 Freshman boat the crew contains
no lack of veterans. For balance it is
undoubtedly the best boat that Stan
ford has ever had. Heal and Olmsted
in the two bow positions lighten up
the forward part of the boat so that
it has the proper riding quality from
the heavier men near the stern. For
pulling ability the eight huskies who
will each pull an oar on Saturday are
as fine a lot of men as one could find.

probably compare favorably with any
eight-oared crew in the country to
day. For power, strength, and form,
they are as fine a lot of men as ever
stepped in a, shell to represent the
Cardinal on tlie water. Considering
the fact that the crews are practically
self-coached, and that none but under
graduates have taken a part in their
training they stand as a shining ex
ample of the success of the under
graduate coaching system.

it is probable that there has never
been such a well-conditioned group of
oarsmen as those which will take the
water on Saturday to represent the
| Cardinal. But little trouble has been
experienced this year with sore hands
among the Varsity men and the Fresh
men are altogether in fine fettle. The
men uave been taking long condition
ing rows every other day and wind
and muscle are in the best of shape.
Strong Freshman Boat.
Throughout the entire season the
Freshmen have been showing un
usual aptitpde for the sport. During
the last few weeks of training, since
they have acquired the form and could
devo e more or their energies to pull,
they have been rowing the Varsity
close races over the two mile course,
and lave often held the older and more
experienced crew for almost the en<
tire distance. The method of rowing
tbes- 1 races this year is an innovation.
v e Varsity boat starts at the three
! . •< mark on the surveyed course and
boat waits at the two
j 'fl| point. When the Varsity boat is
H>st up to the Freshman shell the
given by the coxswain of the
Varsity boat. The Freshmen start and
by Ihe time the Varsity shell is along
side are under full way. The two
boats then row to the finish of the two
mile course. This gives both crews
an opportunity to race over their full
distance.
Varsity Boat Has Many Veterans.
With three veterans of the 1911
victorious Varsity crew, one substi
tute on last year's Varsity, one veteran
of the 1910 victorious Varsity, two
members of the winning 1914 crew,
and a member of the championship
1911 Freshman boat the crew contains
no lack of veterans. For balance it is
undoubtedly the best boat that Stan
ford has ever had. Heal and Olmsted
in the two bow positions lighten up
the forward part of the boat so that
it has the proper riding quality from
the heavier men near the stern. For
pulling ability the eight huskies who
will each pull an oar on Saturday are
as fine a lot of men as one could find.


Captain Seward.
Crew Captain R. H. Seward, '12, an
nounced this afternoon at Redwood the
Varsity and Freshman crews which
will row against California and Wash
i igto:i next Saturday. The Varsity
crew will be composed of the follow
ing men: R. W. Olmsted, '13, bow; C.
H. Beal, '13, No. 2; C. Smith, '11, No.
3; F. W. Watkins, '14, No. 4; R. F.

'14, No. (>; R. H. Seward, '12. No. 7;
.1. F. Partridge, '12, stroke; F. L.
Guerena, '11, coxswain; and the eight
men who will sit in the Freshman boat
are: B. D. Sinclair, bow; J. S. .Teffers,
No. 2; G. H. Jacomini, No. 3; E. B.
