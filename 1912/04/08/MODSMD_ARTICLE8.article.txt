# CALIFORNIA WINS SECOND GAME AND THE SERIES
## CARDINAL LOSES AN EXCITING CONTEST 3 TO 1. Howe and Henshaw Do Good Work For Varsity But Lose to Better Batters. 
### 
California won the Intercollegiate
Baseball series for 1912 by defeating
the Cardinal in the second game on
Saturday by a score of 3 to 1. In this
game, the better of the two, the final
result was in doubt until the last in
ning when Stanford was forced to lose
to her timely hitting rivals.
The Stanford team that took the
field in this game was different from
the one which opened the series the
week before and the changes all work
ed for the better. Howe and Henshaw
did the battery work and the former's
record of eight strike-outs, no walks,
and but seven hits tell of the good
game he whirled. Henshaw caught a
steady game behind the bat and was
the best Stanford batsman of the day,
getting two hits out of three times up.
Captain Gilflllan was again forced to
remain out of the game on account of
a broken finger.
Conklin started the game for Cali
fornia in the box but gave way to
Chapman in the seventh inning. For
mer played right field and by some ex
ceptionally good fielding cut off hits
which would have scored runs for the
Cardinal. In the California half of the
first inning, Goodwin hit for three
bases after two were out. Captain
Allen then hit a grounder directly
along the third base line and was safe
on first when he knocked the ball out
of Obear's hands, Goodwin scoring.
Allen was caught off the base a mo
ment later.
