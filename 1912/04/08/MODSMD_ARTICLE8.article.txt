# CALIFORNIA WINS SECOND GAME AND THE SERIES
## CARDINAL LOSES AN EXCITING CONTEST 3 TO 1. Howe and Henshaw Do Good Work For Varsity But Lose to Better Batters. 
### 
California won the Intercollegiate
Baseball series for 1912 by defeating
the Cardinal in the second game on
Saturday by a score of 3 to 1. In this
game, the better of the two, the final
result was in doubt until the last in
ning when Stanford was forced to lose
to her timely hitting rivals.
The Stanford team that took the
field in this game was different from
the one which opened the series the
week before and the changes all work
ed for the better. Howe and Henshaw
did the battery work and the former's
record of eight strike-outs, no walks,
and but seven hits tell of the good
game he whirled. Henshaw caught a
steady game behind the bat and was
the best Stanford batsman of the day,
getting two hits out of three times up.
Captain Gilflllan was again forced to
remain out of the game on account of
a broken finger.
Conklin started the game for Cali
fornia in the box but gave way to
Chapman in the seventh inning. For
mer played right field and by some ex
ceptionally good fielding cut off hits
which would have scored runs for the
Cardinal. In the California half of the
first inning, Goodwin hit for three
bases after two were out. Captain
Allen then hit a grounder directly
along the third base line and was safe
on first when he knocked the ball out
of Obear's hands, Goodwin scoring.
Allen was caught off the base a mo
ment later.
With one out California added an
other run in the second inning when
Forkec singled, stole second, and
reached third when Stoner hit to Howe
and the latter threw too late to get
his man. Conklin then singled to left
scoring Forker and advancing Stoner
to third. Ford flew out to Gault and
Rubke grounded out, Terry to Obear.
This stop and throw of Terry's was the
best piece of infield work of the day
and cut off two certain runs.
In the third Henshaw beat out a
bunt but got no further than first base,
in the fifth he got his second hit but
again was left on first.
Terry opened the sixth inning with
a three-base drive to right. Gault fol
lowed with a single to center, scoring
Terry. Obear hit a liner to right
which Forker caught with a beautiful
one-handed stop. Beeger reached first
when Gault was forced out at second,
and Cass retired the side with a fly
to second.
Forker Scores.
in their half of the sixth, California
scored their last run after two were
out. Forker reached first when hit by
a pitched ball, stole second, and scored
on Stoner's two-bagger.
Stanford started the seventh in a
determined manner. Halm singled
over third. Here the California team
changed pitchers just in time to allow
Argabrite to double to right. Forker
threw the ball home and Halm was
called out on a close decision. Hen
shaw then bunted and reached first
when Argabrite was caught at the
plate for the second out. Howe re
tired the side with a long fly to right.
In (he eighth, Obear walked and
stole second after two were out, but
got no further. Again in the ninth
after one was down, Halm walked but
was forced out at second by Arga
brite. Childs was putin to bat f</-,••
Henshaw and ended the game by
grounding out, short to first.

California won the Intercollegiate
Baseball series for 1912 by defeating
the Cardinal in the second game on
Saturday by a score of 3 to 1. In this
game, the better of the two, the final
result was in doubt until the last in
ning when Stanford was forced to lose
to her timely hitting rivals.
The Stanford team that took the
field in this game was different from
the one which opened the series the
week before and the changes all work
ed for the better. Howe and Henshaw
did the battery work and the former's
record of eight strike-outs, no walks,
and but seven hits tell of the good
game he whirled. Henshaw caught a
steady game behind the bat and was
the best Stanford batsman of the day,
getting two hits out of three times up.
Captain Gilflllan was again forced to
remain out of the game on account of
a broken finger.
Conklin started the game for Cali
fornia in the box but gave way to
Chapman in the seventh inning. For
mer played right field and by some ex
ceptionally good fielding cut off hits
which would have scored runs for the
Cardinal. In the California half of the
first inning, Goodwin hit for three
bases after two were out. Captain
Allen then hit a grounder directly
along the third base line and was safe
on first when he knocked the ball out
of Obear's hands, Goodwin scoring.
Allen was caught off the base a mo
ment later.
With one out California added an
other run in the second inning when
Forkec singled, stole second, and
reached third when Stoner hit to Howe
and the latter threw too late to get
his man. Conklin then singled to left
scoring Forker and advancing Stoner

California won the Intercollegiate
Baseball series for 1912 by defeating
the Cardinal in the second game on
Saturday by a score of 3 to 1. In this
game, the better of the two, the final
result was in doubt until the last in
ning when Stanford was forced to lose
to her timely hitting rivals.
The Stanford team that took the
field in this game was different from
the one which opened the series the
week before and the changes all work
ed for the better. Howe and Henshaw
did the battery work and the former's
record of eight strike-outs, no walks,
and but seven hits tell of the good
game he whirled. Henshaw caught a
steady game behind the bat and was
the best Stanford batsman of the day,
getting two hits out of three times up.
Captain Gilflllan was again forced to
remain out of the game on account of
a broken finger.
Conklin started the game for Cali
fornia in the box but gave way to
Chapman in the seventh inning. For
mer played right field and by some ex
ceptionally good fielding cut off hits
which would have scored runs for the
Cardinal. In the California half of the
first inning, Goodwin hit for three
bases after two were out. Captain
Allen then hit a grounder directly
along the third base line and was safe
on first when he knocked the ball out
of Obear's hands, Goodwin scoring.
Allen was caught off the base a mo
ment later.
With one out California added an
other run in the second inning when
Forkec singled, stole second, and
reached third when Stoner hit to Howe
and the latter threw too late to get
his man. Conklin then singled to left
scoring Forker and advancing Stoner
to third. Ford flew out to Gault and
Rubke grounded out, Terry to Obear.
This stop and throw of Terry's was the
best piece of infield work of the day
and cut off two certain runs.
In the third Henshaw beat out a
bunt but got no further than first base,
in the fifth he got his second hit but
again was left on first.
Terry opened the sixth inning with
a three-base drive to right. Gault fol
lowed with a single to center, scoring
Terry. Obear hit a liner to right
which Forker caught with a beautiful
one-handed stop. Beeger reached first
when Gault was forced out at second,
and Cass retired the side with a fly
to second.
Forker Scores.
in their half of the sixth, California
scored their last run after two were
out. Forker reached first when hit by
a pitched ball, stole second, and scored
on Stoner's two-bagger.
Stanford started the seventh in a
determined manner. Halm singled
over third. Here the California team
changed pitchers just in time to allow
Argabrite to double to right. Forker
threw the ball home and Halm was
called out on a close decision. Hen
shaw then bunted and reached first
when Argabrite was caught at the
plate for the second out. Howe re
tired the side with a long fly to right.
In (he eighth, Obear walked and
stole second after two were out, but
got no further. Again in the ninth
after one was down, Halm walked but
was forced out at second by Arga
brite. Childs was putin to bat f</-,••
Henshaw and ended the game by
grounding out, short to first.
