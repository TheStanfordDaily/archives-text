*—« t Velvet! Ihe tender middle leaf—hung
up in the warehouse for over two years —
maturing —getting rid of the harshness of
the green leaf —mellowed to a point where
the bite has dropped out —and where the
flavor is good and smooth. That's Velvet.
Numerous red tins of Velvet decorate the 5 foot
shelf its part of a liberal education the best in
the land —this Velvet. Some friend, or ten
cents at any dealer's will give you the pleasure.
