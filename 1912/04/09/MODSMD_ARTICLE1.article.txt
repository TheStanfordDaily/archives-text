# STANFORD WORKERS ARE GREETED BY ALUMNI
## SOUTHERN TRIP PROVES VERY successful. President Jordan, Searles, McDowell, Smith and Schaupp Explain Conditions. 
### 
For the first time in Stanford his
tory a group of men in close touch
with affairs on the campus met with
the alumni in various Southern Cali
fornia cities during the Easter vaca
tion and explained to them the present
day conditions and needs of the Uni
versity. For the first time, probably,
in the history of all such tours by
American University authorities, an
undergraduate played a prominent
part in the meetings.
K. L. Schaupp, '12, President of the
Student Body and next year's Student
Adviser, was the undergraduate. The
other members of the party were
President David Starr Jordan, D.
Searles, '95, President of the Alumni
Advisory Board, J. E. McDowell, '00,
Secretary-Treasurer of the Alumni
Association, and E. W. Smith, '99, Edi
tor of "The Alumnus" and Permanent
Secretary of the Stanford Union. From
time to time the travelers were joined
by other well-known alumni. Miss
Edith Jordan, '97, accompanied the
party during much of the trip and
aided materially in its pleasure and
success.
Purpose,
The tour was made with the purpose
of enhancing the understanding and
sympathy between alumni and faculty
and undergraduates. Believing that a
period of excellent harmony had ar
rived on the campus, the desire was
felt to bring the "old grads" more
closely into the bond of union. Many
of these former Stanford men and
women had failed to realize that con
ditions at Stanford had altered in any
degree since their time, while others
through misrepresented accounts had
been led to the belief that these
changes were greater than is actually
the case.
The expedition to the south was
undertaken at the instigation of the
Alumni Advisory Board, of which
Searles is president. This board has
taken upon itself the Important duty
of acting as a medium of exchange be
tween faculty, undergraduates, trus
tees and alumni. It has accomplished
a valuable service of harmonizing and
coordination. Among achievements to
its credit is the carrying to completion
of the eating house project. It also
aided materially in the movement for
an isolation hospital.
