Interscholastic week will again bring
up the problem of dealing with the
preparatory school athletes. Some

years ago several high school
principals put forth the criti
cism that when the athletes

returned home after a visit to the
campus they were unmanageable.
This, the school authorities claimed,
was due to the "rushing" system of
the fraternities.
The Greek letter societies had come
to use the Interscholastic as an
effective means of securing desirable
material. With them it was a race for
new men and simply a matter of "the
devil take the hindmost."
Happily this condition of affairs was
soon changed and for the past five
years not a complaint has been heard
on the old score. It. lies in the hands
of the fraternities to make or mar the
present Interscholastic. If they adhere
to the rules laid down by the Board
of Interscholastic Governors, rules
which have been scrupulously observed
in the past, all will be well and the
coming preparatory school meet will
far outshine its predecessors.
