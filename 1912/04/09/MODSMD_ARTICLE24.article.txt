# STANFORD CREWS ROW ON ESTUARY TOMORROW
## VARSITY BOAT COMPOSED OF VETERAN MEN. Pullers of the Oar are in Fine Trim For Saturday's Contest on the Water. 
### 
Closing a strenuous season at Red
wood the eighteen men who are to
occupy seats in the Stanford shells on
Saturday rowed for the last time on
the nearby waters this afternoon. To
morrow the Varsity and Freshman
eights and substitutes are to go to
Oakland and the final work over the
course is to be done there. The men
who are to represent the Cardinal are
in the best of condition and the last
practice on the estuary augurs well
for a double Stanford victory.
With four men in the shell who
have rowed against the California
Varsity crews before and four who
have pulled an oar in competition with
the Blue and Gold as members of their
Freshmen crews the eight which faces
California and Washington may be
practically called a veteran combina
tion.
Partridge, who will stroke the crew,
is undoubtedly the most able man who
has ever made pace for a Stanford
shell. He pulls a steady,.long, strong,
and very fast sweep despite his weight.
Above all, he has paced three crews
over difficult courses and has the re
quisite head work and experience that
are necessary for a good stroke. He
rowed in the 1912 Freshman boat, the
1909 and 1910 Washington crews, and
the 1910 Varsity shell.
Captain Seward is one of the hard
est and most consistent workers in the
entire boat. His form is excellent a j?d
lie holds down the difficult seven seat
with ease. Seward rowed also in the
1912 Freshman crew, was a substitute
on the 1909 Washington crew, was a
member of the 1910 and 1911 Varsity
boats and pulled the bow oar in the
1910 Washington crew.
Wickman pulls a strong oar and is
well fitted to hold the six seat because
of his height and reach. He rows in
good form and is a hard fighter. Wick
man captained the victorious 1914
Freshman.
Duryea is probably the strongest
oarsman in the boat. His form is goou
and his experience always stands him
in good stead. He rowed on tlie 19K3
Freshman four and pulled in the same
position on the 1911 Varsity that he
will on Saturday.
Watkins is another very strong
puller. He is a great fighter and is
expected to row a gritty race, lie
stroked the 1914 Freshmen to victory.
In Smith the crew has a strong, con
sistent rower, a steady fighter, and a
hard worker. He is one of the grittiest
men in the boat. He pulled in the
1911 Freshman shell.
In the two seat Heal, although light,
rows in excellent form and is a hard,
consistent performer. He stroked the
191.Â°> Freshman crew and was a sub
stitute for the Varsity last year.
Olmsted in the bow seat is probably
the mo3t finished oarsman in the boat.
His form is perfect at all times and
he rows a hard and steady race.
Ouerena will hold the tiller ropes.
He has guided more Stanford crews
to victory than any other man who
ever sat in the coxswain seat.
The substitutes for the Varsity will
be P. I'. .Clover, '14, and .T. S. Grepe.!
'13. The Freshman substitutes are
R. R. Thorbnrn, and W. Clark.
