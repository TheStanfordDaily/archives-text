# "BIGGEST AND BEST" WILL CROWD ARMORY
## FOUR CLASSES AND HOLDOVERS WILL JOLLY-UP. Monster Affair Planned by Seniors For Friday Eveningâ€”Stunts and Eats in Abundance. 
### 
A new standard in University social
affairs will be set on next Friday even
ing, when the entire student body will
meet at the Armory in the greatest
jolly-up that has ever packed that hall
to overflowing. The Senior class, fol
lowing the precedent set last year, has
taken charge of the evening's enter
tainment, and the committee appoint
ed by President R. H. Seward has prac
tically completed its plans for an ex
traordinary fun-fest.
Stunts are to be many and varied in
character; the eats will leave no room
for criticism, and the music is to be
of the best. The affair is to differ from
the class jolly-ups only in that it is
to be on a far larger scale. Infor
mality is to be the rule, and rough
neck costume is to vie with "robber
dances" and "Paul .Tones'" in adding to
the general goodtime.
A record-breaking crowd is inevit
able, and yet through the comprehen
sive plans of the committee everyone
will be enabled to get a proportionate
share of the fun. The dancing will be
almost continuous, so that the crowd
on the floor will be constantly chang
ing. Many of the stunts will be started
early in the evening, so that those who
are not dancing may be otherwise
amused.
The eats have had more than the
usual attention from the committee,
and it is safe to say that everyone at
the Armory on next Friday evening
will follow their lead.
