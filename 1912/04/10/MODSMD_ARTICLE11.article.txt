The Daily Palo Alto does not pre
sume to criticize the action taken by

the Judicial Board of Wo
men Students in forbidding
the admission of more soro-

rities within the select circle of the
five hundred. Not knowing the cir
cumstances which led to the step, we
are unable to comment upon the ad
visability of such an action, but being
acquainted with the character of the
committee responsible for this rather
radical move, we can say with convic
tion that the Judicial Board made the
recommendation only after carefully
considering the best* interests of all
concerned.
