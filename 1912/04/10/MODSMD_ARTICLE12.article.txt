# Alderman Addresses Euphronians.
## 
### 
M. N. Alderman, '12, illustrated the
movements of political parties with a
chart of original design at the meeting
of Euphronia debating society last
night. The affirmative, upheld by U. A.
Sontheimer, '12, and S. S. Green, '14,
won the decision in the regular debate
on the question of a free toll canal for
American ships. G. Miller, '14, and
W. F. Kilcline, '15, formed the negative
team.
