# INTERSCHOLASTIC OFFICIALS NAMED
## STUDENTS MAY WITNESS INTERCOLLEGIATE REGATTA AND RETURN TO CAMPUS IN AMPLE TIME FOR FINAL EVENTS OF WEEK. 
### 
Arrangements have been completed
by Graduate Manager Burbank so that
students who desire to witness the an
nual regatta on the Oakland estuary
may do so from the most advantageous
places. It was planned to have a
special train carry the Stanford rooters
to the races, but this was found im
practicable. However, those who in
tend to go across the bay may leave on
the 6:35 or the 7 o'clock trains from
Palo Alto Saturday morning.
A special car is to leave the Hook
store at 6:20 in order to connect with
the Southern Pacific train fifteen
minntes later. This early train is the
most desirable as sufficient time will
be given fo/ connections in San Fran
cisco.
Rooters' Train.
An observation train has been ob
tained from the Western Pacific and
those who take advantage of this are
guaranteed an excellent view of the
races. The cost of tickets is seventy
five cents.
In order to place the price of tickets
at the low figure the managers were
obliged to make up a deficit of twenty
five cent* on e'-icb tickpt. sold. A
twenty-five dollar fee was paid for
switching privileges. The tickets are

to be placed on sale on Thursday and
Friday and after this time no tickets
will be available. The Bookstore is
to have charge of the sale.
Freshmen Race First.
The Freshmen race is scheduled to
start at 9 o'clock and the Varsity con
test begins at 9:30. The observation
train is to leave Third and Washing
ton streets, Oakland, a few minutes be
fore the time of the first race.
Two launches capable of seating one
hundred and sixty people have been
chartered for the Stanford rooters.
Tickets for these boats may be secured
from .J. W. Howell or at Ham's cigar
store. The price of the pasteboards is
one dollar. The launches are to leave
the foot of Franklin street at 9 o'clock.
The most convenient way of getting to
the starting point is to take the Creek
or sc. Ferry from the Ferry building,
San Francisco, to the Webster street
landing. From there to Webster street
and then to the Oakland Launch and
Tug-Boat Company at the City Wharf
is but a short journey.
Tin Southern Pacific ferry to the
Oakh nd .Mole will also connect with
flip •■"aired point. The ride from San
Francisco to the starting point takes
about forty minutes.
