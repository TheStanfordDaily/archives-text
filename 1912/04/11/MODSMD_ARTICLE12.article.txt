The Stanford Interscholastic Asso
ciation was established seven years

ago by W. H. Fowler
'06, for the purpose of
fostering clean ath
letics in the second-

ary schools of the Pacific Coast. In
the seven years of its existence, the
In'.erscholastic has played a large part
in the revival of interest in track
sports.
The object of the Association, how
ever, is more than the mere develop
ment. of star athletes. The primary
purpose of its formation and the aim
that the Board of Governors has al
ways sought to realize is the spread
of clean ideals and the maintenance of
high standards of sportsmanship.
The Intercollegiate Crew races will
deprive the 1912 meet of a sreat num
ber of spectators and appreciably les
sen the chances of making this year's
Interscholastic a financial success. To
remedy this to some extent, admission
tickets will be sold at the various
houses on the campus and at Encina.
