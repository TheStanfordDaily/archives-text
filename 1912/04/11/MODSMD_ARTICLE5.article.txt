# INTERSCHOLASTIC MEN INVADE CAMPUS
## VISITING PLAYERS TO CONTEST IN TENNIS INTERSCHOLASTIC EXPERTS ARE PEERLESS. Largo and Excellent Entry List Assures Success of Preparatory Schools Tournament. 
### 
Tennis of an order seldom seen in
preparatory school circles and which
would be of credit to college cracks
should be developed in the finals of
the Stanford interscholastic tourna
ment which begins Friday. J. Strachan
of Lowell High School and W. John
ston, the junior champion of the
coast, will probably be the contestants
i l the deciding round.
The drawings are so arranged that
t'lese men will not meet till the final
round. The upper half looks easy for
Strachan, although J. Hutchinson of
Palo Alto High School will give him
a good run. In the lower half John
ston is a certain winner, but the match
between him and W. Fottrell, one of
t'ie stars of last year's interscholastic
meet, will undoubtedly produce some
tennis of high order. The deciding
match of the tournament is expected
to occur about 10:30 Saturday morning.
The doubles supremacy will prob
ably be contested between Strachan
and Levinson of Lowell, Johnson and
Haussler of Polytechnic, and Hutchin
son and Murray of Palo Alto.

Tennis of an order seldom seen in
preparatory school circles and which
would be of credit to college cracks
should be developed in the finals of
the Stanford interscholastic tourna
ment which begins Friday. J. Strachan
of Lowell High School and W. John
ston, the junior champion of the
coast, will probably be the contestants
i l the deciding round.
The drawings are so arranged that
t'lese men will not meet till the final
round. The upper half looks easy for
Strachan, although J. Hutchinson of
Palo Alto High School will give him
a good run. In the lower half John
ston is a certain winner, but the match
between him and W. Fottrell, one of
t'ie stars of last year's interscholastic
meet, will undoubtedly produce some
tennis of high order. The deciding
match of the tournament is expected
to occur about 10:30 Saturday morning.
The doubles supremacy will prob
ably be contested between Strachan
and Levinson of Lowell, Johnson and
Haussler of Polytechnic, and Hutchin
son and Murray of Palo Alto.
