# SMALL SCORE WILL WIN SEVENTH ANNUAL MEET
## INTERSCHOLASTIC RECORDS IN DANGER TOMORROW. High School Boys Entered in Various Events Have Excellent Records. 
### 
Seven years ago tbe Stanford Inter
scholastic meet was founded as an
annual event for the purpose of pro
moting good sportsmanship among the
schools of the Pacific slope. Tomor
row representatives from schools in
all parts of the state will gather on
the cardinal oval to compete in the
annual competition of the preparatory
schools. The number of schools which
have been sending men to the meet

has grown each year and the entry
list has shown a corresponding in
crease.
Picking a winner has been a prob
lem each year and it is difficult to
select any one school as there is al
ways such a division"* of points that
any team which is able to gather about
a score is returned the champion.
Last year Los Angeles High with a
total of eighteen points won the right
to the iirst place. Citrus Union and
Palo Alto appear to be the most likely
contenders for the lirst place this
year.
The boys from Azusa have in their
ranks Whitted, a star hurdler and
weight man, and Jackson, sprinter and
quarter miler.


I)r. Angell
Official at Meet.
The hundred yard dash presents an
especially strong field with Lasar of
Berkeley, Murray of California Poly,
Rogers of Lick, Jackson of Citrus
Union, Baxter of Oakland, Clayton of
Santa Clara, Parker of Stockton, Wads
worth of Sutter and Needham of San
Jose. The furlong will have practi
cally the same starters. The quarter
mile is a well balanced event and
should prove an even affair for a num
ber Qf contestants. Straub of Sutter,
Jackson of Azusa, Lachmund of Palo
Alto and Lenzen of Lick are a speedy
aggregation.
The three most prominently men
tioned candidates in the half are Chap
man of Santa Rosa, Annin of Occi
dental Academy and Schweizer of Cali
fornia Poly. The race should prove
a record breaker. The mile also
should be made a new mark affair.
Schweizer and McKnight of Fremont
have both done close to the record
figure and the southerners are sending
a strong entry list in this event.
Cracks Enter Hurdles.
In the hurdles Murray of Palo Alto,
Whitted of Citrus, Colby of Cogswell
and Ostrander of Oakland do the low
sticks under :18 3-5 and clear the 220
yard hurdles near the twenty-five sec
ond mark.
Meadows of Fremont, Guyler of Mo
desto and Chase of San .lose have done
excellent work in the high jump. Mur
ray of Palo Alto is another star
jumper.
Chico is sending a lone representa
tive to the meet but this lad has done
over eleven feet in the pole vault. He
is Graves, and will find keen competi
tion whne Templeton of Palo Alto and
Pedersen vault with him. The broad
jump and weights are difficult to figure
as the entry blanks show the names of
a large number of boys who have done
about the same in their respective
events. However, the Palo Alto lads
Wallace and Dingley, rank well in
tlip former event. Vilas of Berkeley,
Clement of U. S. C. Prep., and TTohman
of Lick, Earl of Healdsburg and Drake
of Santa Rosa are a quintette of likely
winners.
Sun Jose After Relay.
The relay is an open race and San
Jose is coming with a strong desire
to once more take home the Bittner
cup. Among the many trophies which
are to be awarded to the winners is
the Varsity cup which is to be given
to the man making the best perform
ance in the estimation of the judges
in any event of the meet.

moting good sportsmanship among the
schools of the Pacific slope. Tomor
row representatives from schools in
all parts of the state will gather on
the cardinal oval to compete in the
annual competition of the preparatory
schools. The number of schools which
have been sending men to the meet

has grown each year and the entry
list has shown a corresponding in
crease.
Picking a winner has been a prob
lem each year and it is difficult to
select any one school as there is al
ways such a division"* of points that
any team which is able to gather about
a score is returned the champion.
Last year Los Angeles High with a
total of eighteen points won the right
to the iirst place. Citrus Union and
Palo Alto appear to be the most likely
contenders for the lirst place this
year.
The boys from Azusa have in their
ranks Whitted, a star hurdler and
weight man, and Jackson, sprinter and
quarter miler.


I)r. Angell
Official at Meet.
The hundred yard dash presents an
especially strong field with Lasar of
Berkeley, Murray of California Poly,
Rogers of Lick, Jackson of Citrus
Union, Baxter of Oakland, Clayton of
Santa Clara, Parker of Stockton, Wads
worth of Sutter and Needham of San
Jose. The furlong will have practi
cally the same starters. The quarter
mile is a well balanced event and
should prove an even affair for a num
ber Qf contestants. Straub of Sutter,
Jackson of Azusa, Lachmund of Palo
Alto and Lenzen of Lick are a speedy
aggregation.
The three most prominently men
tioned candidates in the half are Chap
man of Santa Rosa, Annin of Occi
dental Academy and Schweizer of Cali
fornia Poly. The race should prove
a record breaker. The mile also
should be made a new mark affair.
Schweizer and McKnight of Fremont
have both done close to the record
figure and the southerners are sending
a strong entry list in this event.
Cracks Enter Hurdles.
In the hurdles Murray of Palo Alto,
Whitted of Citrus, Colby of Cogswell
and Ostrander of Oakland do the low
sticks under :18 3-5 and clear the 220
yard hurdles near the twenty-five sec
ond mark.
Meadows of Fremont, Guyler of Mo
desto and Chase of San .lose have done
excellent work in the high jump. Mur
ray of Palo Alto is another star
jumper.
Chico is sending a lone representa
tive to the meet but this lad has done
over eleven feet in the pole vault. He
is Graves, and will find keen competi
tion whne Templeton of Palo Alto and
Pedersen vault with him. The broad
jump and weights are difficult to figure
as the entry blanks show the names of
a large number of boys who have done
about the same in their respective
events. However, the Palo Alto lads
Wallace and Dingley, rank well in
tlip former event. Vilas of Berkeley,
Clement of U. S. C. Prep., and TTohman
of Lick, Earl of Healdsburg and Drake
of Santa Rosa are a quintette of likely
winners.
Sun Jose After Relay.
The relay is an open race and San
Jose is coming with a strong desire
to once more take home the Bittner
cup. Among the many trophies which
are to be awarded to the winners is
the Varsity cup which is to be given
to the man making the best perform
ance in the estimation of the judges
in any event of the meet.
Seven years ago tbe Stanford Inter
scholastic meet was founded as an
annual event for the purpose of pro
moting good sportsmanship among the
schools of the Pacific slope. Tomor
