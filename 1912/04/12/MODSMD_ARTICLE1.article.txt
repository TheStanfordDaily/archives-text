# SMALL SCORE WILL WIN SEVENTH ANNUAL MEET
## INTERSCHOLASTIC RECORDS IN DANGER TOMORROW. High School Boys Entered in Various Events Have Excellent Records. 
### 
Seven years ago tbe Stanford Inter
scholastic meet was founded as an
annual event for the purpose of pro
moting good sportsmanship among the
schools of the Pacific slope. Tomor
row representatives from schools in
all parts of the state will gather on
the cardinal oval to compete in the
annual competition of the preparatory
schools. The number of schools which
have been sending men to the meet

has grown each year and the entry
list has shown a corresponding in
crease.
Picking a winner has been a prob
lem each year and it is difficult to
select any one school as there is al
ways such a division"* of points that
any team which is able to gather about
a score is returned the champion.
Last year Los Angeles High with a
total of eighteen points won the right
to the iirst place. Citrus Union and
Palo Alto appear to be the most likely
contenders for the lirst place this
year.
The boys from Azusa have in their
ranks Whitted, a star hurdler and
weight man, and Jackson, sprinter and
quarter miler.
