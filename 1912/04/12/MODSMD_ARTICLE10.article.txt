# JUDGE J.E. RICHARDS ADDRESSES LAW MEN.
## 
### 
Judge J. E. Richards of the Superior
Court of Santa Clara County spoke
before a large gathering of law stu
dents yesterday afternoon on the sub
ject "Our Title Deeds." He declared
that the forces of concentrated wealth
and labor and the tendency towards
democracy have threatened the title
deeds of the average citizen, class
equality and individual liberty. In the
struggle that has followed, the
speaker believes that the legal pro
fession must be the defender of the
rights of the people. Judge Richards
delivered this address some time ago
before the Stanford Alumni Law
Association.
