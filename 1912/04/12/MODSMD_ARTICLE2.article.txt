# Three Varsities Row in Big Regatta
## CREW RACES TOMORROW PROMISE TO BE BEST EVER HELD ON PACIFIC COAST.â€”STANFORD BIDS FAIR TO CROSS LINE FIRST. 
### 
Tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock two
lean shells will line up at the Web
ster street bridge on the Oakland
estuary and a few moments later the i
gun will be fired which will open the !
greatest regatta ever seen on the Pa-,
cific Coast. In those two boats, with j
their noses pointing down stream, will
be the pick of the first-year oarsmen !
of Stanford and the University of Cali-!
fornia. They will row for two miles j
for the Freshman rowing supremacy!
of the Pacific Coast.
An hour later three other shells
will line up a mile farther up stream
and when the starting gun is fired
will start on what promises to be
the most bitter contest of its kind
ever rowed west of the Mississippi.
Rowing enthusiasts from all ovei
i the Pacific Coast will be down on the
Estuary tomorrow morning to witness
the contests. They have come from
Portland and Seattle, from Los An
geles and San Diego, and each of theni
is expecting to see one of the best
j regattas he has ever witnessed. It
I is certain that their hopes will bt
! realized.
I
I Varsity is Heavy.
The Varsity contest tomorrow
should go far to decide the much
mooted question among oarsmen as
to whether a light crew in a light
boat, with lots of form but no excess
of brawn, is better than a heavy crew
in a heavy boat, with less form, but
plenty of brawn. The Washington
crew averages 102 pounds and rows in
a shell which is one of the wonders
of the boat making trade. It weight,
just three pounds more than the
average weight of the crew. Stanford
and California will both row in shells
almost twice as heavy as the Wash
ington boat and the crews both aver
age about thirteen pounds more than
the Washington oarsmen.
Another thing which may be dem
onstrated is whether the slow stroke,
with a high catch and a slow recov

ery, such as used by the Washington
boat is superior to the fast stroke,
with a low catch, a hard finish, and
a fast recovery such as that which
the Stanford men use. There are nu
merous arguments in favor of both
styles and tomorrow should do much
to clear up the doubt as to which is
the superior in the finer points.
Stanford Should Win.
Washington is an unknown quan
tity but on straight "dope" the Stan
ford shell should be victorious in
both contests. The Varsity is un
doubtedly as good as any crew that
was ever developed at the University,;
the men are in fine condition, and are j
determined to fight to the finish. Al
though the Freshman boat is always |
doubtful, because of the lack of ex
perience of the men, the first year
shell tomorrow should show its stern
to the California babies.
To Reach Course.
The races will be over in time to
catch the 1:20 train back to the cam
pus. A special car will leave the
Bookstore at 6:20 tomororw morning
collecting with 'hp G:35 train. The
seven o'clock train may also be taken
by those who intend to view the races
from the observation train but those
who are to have seats on the two
launches will find it necessary to make
the earlier train.
The observation train will leave
Third and Washington streets, Oak
land, a few minutes before nine. The
most convenient way of getting to the
starting point of the launches is to
take the Creek ferry from the Ferry
building to the Webster street land
ing, Oakland. Follow Webster street
to the Oakland Launch and Tug Boat
company's station at the City wharf.
