# CARDINAL CREWS ARE VICTORIOUS
## INTERSCHOLASTIC WON BY AZUSA CALIFORNIA IS BEATEN BY STANFORD AND WASHINGTON Blue and Gold Freshmen Meet Defeat on the Oakland Estuary This Morning. 
### 
Captain Seward's Statement:
"The Freshman boat that
represented Stanford this year
was the best Freshman crew
that we have ever had. They
are a hunch ol' hard fighters
and willing workers. 1 expect
great things of them. The Var
sity race was the easiest con
test I ever was in. At no time
were we pressed and "Husky"
did not have to call on us once
for a sprint. The men were in
wonderful condition. It was as
tine a crew as ever rowed for
Stanford."
Coach Conibear of Washing
ton:"The best crew won with
out any doubt."
Captain I'iillcn of Washing
ton: "We were beaten by a bet
ter crew and have no kick
at all.''

Stanford's Varsity and Freshman
crews were victorious this morning
in the greatest regatta ever held on
the Pacific Coast. The Vars:ty crew,
never pressed and maintaining a
steady stroke of between 36 and:? 8.
crossed the finish line two lengths
ahead of the much-touted Washington
eight and seven lengths ahead of the
crew of the University of California.
The Freshmen defeated their speedy
rivals hy a good three-quarters of a
boat length.
Weather conditions on the lower
course were ideal. for a slight
chilling breeze, which was not strong
enough to kick up the watei, the
lower course on the Estuary was all
that could be desired. Because of the
fact that earlier in the morning it
looked as if the day might end with
rather rough water it was decided to !
row the Varsity contest first, contrary
to the scheduled program, ft was
planned to postpone the Freshmen
race until a later time if it was found
too rough after the Varsity contest.
St in ford Lends.
At 9:4f> the starting gun of the race
was fired. The Stanford shell got off
to a poor start and was perhaps a j
quarter of a, length behind at the end
of the first fifteen strokes. Before
the crews had rowed four hundred
yards the sturdy Stanford oarsmen had
established a lead of about a quarter i
length and from that time until the '
finish they were never headed or even !
pressed. "

For the first half mile Stroke Part
ridge set pace at about 38. The Wash
ington shell was being driven at a 36
stroke and California was pulling
about the same. After the first hun
dred strokes ir was evident that Cali
fornia was not in the race and that the
first place honors would fall to either
Stanford or Washington. Although
Stanford's lead at this point was not
more than a length, Washington's
slow, high catch stroke did not have
sufficient power to overtake the speed
ing Cardinal oarsmen.
The lead was so pronounced and the
crew going so easily that Coxswain
(luerena did not feel that it was neces
sary to even call on the men for a
sprint. The entire eight, in wonder
ful condition, were putting a world of
power into every stroke and were
holding back enough to have increased
their lead a length if necessary.
After the race Captain Seward said:

"vVe 112 nld have gaitr-d a length on
them at the finish without raisins the
stroke if it had been necessary. The
power in th- 1 boat was wonderful."
Hoth California's and Washington's
-'hull's wptp in bad condition when they
crossed the finish. Hardy, the Cali
fornia Ftrnke. who nulled a fine, gritty
race throughout, fell over in a half
tint irto the seven man's lap just
■liter tiie shell crossed (he finish line.
Several of the men in the Washington
boat were suffering visibly.
The superiority of the Stanford
stroke with its speedy recovery and
ha-d catch and finish was proved for
good and for all by this morning's
performance. It is undoubtedly as
fine a stroke as could lie devised for
:• threo mile course. The Washington


Coxswain F. L. (iticrciiu, '11.
stroke on the other hand is a won
derfully pretty stroke and would prob
ably be ideal in a four mile contest
but it has not the requisite speed for
a three mile affair.
Freshmen Win.
The Freshmen did not have such an
easy time with the California babies
as the Varsity did in their race. The
first year boats were not set off from

a lock start as were the Varsity shells,
and the gun was lired when the Car
dinal boat was almost three-quarters
of a length behind their rivals and
coming up to the mark. By the time
the half mile mark was passed they
were travelling even with the speedy
California shell and at a mile and a
half clear water could be seen between
the two. ft was here that Coxswain
Reinemann swung out into the stream
too far and was caught by the swiftly
running ebb tide, so that his boat lost
almost a half a length on the Califor
nia babies and it was with a three
quarter length lead that the finish line
was crossed.
The Stanford men were in better
condition than Cardinal oarsmen in
any previous contest. The men in the
Varsity boat were laughing during the
lust, thirty strokes before the finish,
and the first cry that went up from
some man in the boat,, almost before
the California shell had crossed the
line, was "Let's go back." And go back
they did. They rowed the four miles
back to the boat house almost as fast
as the race itself.
Last evening the men were in the
best of fettle. They were none of them
worried and they all slept the sleep of
the well-trained athlete.
The Tim p.
The time of the Varsity race, un
official, was 16:42 for the three miles,
and of the Freshmen ten minutes flat
for the two mile course. That the
Varsity could have done far better
than this had it not been for the slight
ground swell the last half mile, and
the fact that it was unnecessary, is
evidenced by the time made over the
course on Thursday. Tn a trial spin
the boat went over about two and
three-quarter miles of the three mile
course in 14:03. The probable time if
they had finished would have been
about 15:30. The first mile in this
trial was done in 4:30, which is close
to world's record time. The Freshmen
time was remarkably good. Had it not
been for the fact that California's boat
was abont fifteen seconds faster they
would undoubtedly have won more de
cisively than they did.
After the race at the "Amador," the
California boat-house, the eighteen
Stanford men were a happy crowd.
The Varsity did not look as if they had
been through a gruelling race and the
Freshmen looked almost as well. They
will probably return to the campus by
the theatre train this evening.

first year boats were not set off from

a lock start as were the Varsity shells,
and the gun was lired when the Car
dinal boat was almost three-quarters
of a length behind their rivals and
coming up to the mark. By the time
the half mile mark was passed they
were travelling even with the speedy
California shell and at a mile and a
half clear water could be seen between
the two. ft was here that Coxswain
Reinemann swung out into the stream
too far and was caught by the swiftly
running ebb tide, so that his boat lost
almost a half a length on the Califor
nia babies and it was with a three
quarter length lead that the finish line
was crossed.
The Stanford men were in better
condition than Cardinal oarsmen in
any previous contest. The men in the
Varsity boat were laughing during the
lust, thirty strokes before the finish,
and the first cry that went up from
some man in the boat,, almost before
the California shell had crossed the
line, was "Let's go back." And go back
they did. They rowed the four miles
back to the boat house almost as fast
as the race itself.
Last evening the men were in the
best of fettle. They were none of them
worried and they all slept the sleep of
the well-trained athlete.
The Tim p.
The time of the Varsity race, un
official, was 16:42 for the three miles,
and of the Freshmen ten minutes flat
for the two mile course. That the
Varsity could have done far better
than this had it not been for the slight
ground swell the last half mile, and
the fact that it was unnecessary, is
evidenced by the time made over the
course on Thursday. Tn a trial spin
the boat went over about two and
three-quarter miles of the three mile
course in 14:03. The probable time if
they had finished would have been
about 15:30. The first mile in this
trial was done in 4:30, which is close
to world's record time. The Freshmen
time was remarkably good. Had it not
been for the fact that California's boat
was abont fifteen seconds faster they
would undoubtedly have won more de
cisively than they did.
After the race at the "Amador," the
California boat-house, the eighteen
Stanford men were a happy crowd.
The Varsity did not look as if they had
been through a gruelling race and the
Freshmen looked almost as well. They
will probably return to the campus by
the theatre train this evening.
Captain Seward's Statement:
"The Freshman boat that
represented Stanford this year
was the best Freshman crew
that we have ever had. They
are a hunch ol' hard fighters
and willing workers. 1 expect
great things of them. The Var
sity race was the easiest con
test I ever was in. At no time
were we pressed and "Husky"
did not have to call on us once
for a sprint. The men were in
wonderful condition. It was as
tine a crew as ever rowed for
Stanford."
Coach Conibear of Washing
ton:"The best crew won with
out any doubt."
Captain I'iillcn of Washing
ton: "We were beaten by a bet
ter crew and have no kick
at all.''

Stanford's Varsity and Freshman
crews were victorious this morning
in the greatest regatta ever held on
the Pacific Coast. The Vars:ty crew,
never pressed and maintaining a
steady stroke of between 36 and:? 8.
crossed the finish line two lengths
ahead of the much-touted Washington
eight and seven lengths ahead of the
crew of the University of California.
The Freshmen defeated their speedy
rivals hy a good three-quarters of a
boat length.
Weather conditions on the lower
course were ideal. for a slight
chilling breeze, which was not strong
enough to kick up the watei, the
lower course on the Estuary was all
that could be desired. Because of the
fact that earlier in the morning it
looked as if the day might end with
rather rough water it was decided to !
row the Varsity contest first, contrary
to the scheduled program, ft was
planned to postpone the Freshmen
race until a later time if it was found
too rough after the Varsity contest.

At 9:4f> the starting gun of the race
was fired. The Stanford shell got off
to a poor start and was perhaps a j
quarter of a, length behind at the end
of the first fifteen strokes. Before
the crews had rowed four hundred
yards the sturdy Stanford oarsmen had
established a lead of about a quarter i
length and from that time until the '
finish they were never headed or even !
pressed. "

For the first half mile Stroke Part
ridge set pace at about 38. The Wash
ington shell was being driven at a 36
stroke and California was pulling
about the same. After the first hun
dred strokes ir was evident that Cali
fornia was not in the race and that the
first place honors would fall to either
Stanford or Washington. Although
Stanford's lead at this point was not
more than a length, Washington's
slow, high catch stroke did not have
sufficient power to overtake the speed
ing Cardinal oarsmen.
The lead was so pronounced and the
crew going so easily that Coxswain
(luerena did not feel that it was neces
sary to even call on the men for a
sprint. The entire eight, in wonder
ful condition, were putting a world of
power into every stroke and were
holding back enough to have increased
their lead a length if necessary.
After the race Captain Seward said:

"vVe 112 nld have gaitr-d a length on
them at the finish without raisins the
stroke if it had been necessary. The
power in th- 1 boat was wonderful."

Several of the men in the Washington
boat were suffering visibly.
The superiority of the Stanford
stroke with its speedy recovery and
ha-d catch and finish was proved for
good and for all by this morning's
performance. It is undoubtedly as
fine a stroke as could lie devised for

of the first fifteen strokes. Before
the crews had rowed four hundred
yards the sturdy Stanford oarsmen had
established a lead of about a quarter i
length and from that time until the '
finish they were never headed or even !
pressed. "

For the first half mile Stroke Part
ridge set pace at about 38. The Wash
ington shell was being driven at a 36
stroke and California was pulling
about the same. After the first hun
dred strokes ir was evident that Cali
fornia was not in the race and that the
first place honors would fall to either
Stanford or Washington. Although
Stanford's lead at this point was not
more than a length, Washington's
slow, high catch stroke did not have
sufficient power to overtake the speed
ing Cardinal oarsmen.
The lead was so pronounced and the
crew going so easily that Coxswain
(luerena did not feel that it was neces
sary to even call on the men for a
sprint. The entire eight, in wonder
ful condition, were putting a world of
power into every stroke and were
holding back enough to have increased
their lead a length if necessary.
After the race Captain Seward said:

"vVe 112 nld have gaitr-d a length on
them at the finish without raisins the
stroke if it had been necessary. The
power in th- 1 boat was wonderful."

Several of the men in the Washington
boat were suffering visibly.
The superiority of the Stanford
stroke with its speedy recovery and
ha-d catch and finish was proved for
good and for all by this morning's
performance. It is undoubtedly as

stroke on the other hand is a won
derfully pretty stroke and would prob
ably be ideal in a four mile contest
but it has not the requisite speed for
a three mile affair.
Freshmen Win.
The Freshmen did not have such an
easy time with the California babies
as the Varsity did in their race. The
first year boats were not set off from

a lock start as were the Varsity shells,
and the gun was lired when the Car
dinal boat was almost three-quarters
of a length behind their rivals and
coming up to the mark. By the time
the half mile mark was passed they
were travelling even with the speedy
California shell and at a mile and a
half clear water could be seen between
the two. ft was here that Coxswain
Reinemann swung out into the stream
too far and was caught by the swiftly
running ebb tide, so that his boat lost
almost a half a length on the Califor
nia babies and it was with a three
quarter length lead that the finish line
was crossed.
The Stanford men were in better
condition than Cardinal oarsmen in
any previous contest. The men in the
Varsity boat were laughing during the
lust, thirty strokes before the finish,
and the first cry that went up from
some man in the boat,, almost before
the California shell had crossed the
line, was "Let's go back." And go back
they did. They rowed the four miles
back to the boat house almost as fast
as the race itself.
Last evening the men were in the
best of fettle. They were none of them
worried and they all slept the sleep of
the well-trained athlete.
The Tim p.
The time of the Varsity race, un
official, was 16:42 for the three miles,
and of the Freshmen ten minutes flat
for the two mile course. That the
Varsity could have done far better
than this had it not been for the slight
ground swell the last half mile, and
the fact that it was unnecessary, is
evidenced by the time made over the
course on Thursday. Tn a trial spin
the boat went over about two and
three-quarter miles of the three mile
course in 14:03. The probable time if
they had finished would have been
about 15:30. The first mile in this
trial was done in 4:30, which is close
to world's record time. The Freshmen
time was remarkably good. Had it not
been for the fact that California's boat
was abont fifteen seconds faster they
would undoubtedly have won more de
cisively than they did.
After the race at the "Amador," the
California boat-house, the eighteen
Stanford men were a happy crowd.
The Varsity did not look as if they had
been through a gruelling race and the
Freshmen looked almost as well. They
will probably return to the campus by
the theatre train this evening.
Captain Seward's Statement:
"The Freshman boat that
represented Stanford this year
was the best Freshman crew
that we have ever had. They
are a hunch ol' hard fighters
and willing workers. 1 expect
great things of them. The Var
sity race was the easiest con
test I ever was in. At no time
were we pressed and "Husky"
did not have to call on us once
for a sprint. The men were in
wonderful condition. It was as
tine a crew as ever rowed for
Stanford."
Coach Conibear of Washing
ton:"The best crew won with
out any doubt."
Captain I'iillcn of Washing
ton: "We were beaten by a bet
ter crew and have no kick
at all.''

Stanford's Varsity and Freshman
crews were victorious this morning
in the greatest regatta ever held on
the Pacific Coast. The Vars:ty crew,
never pressed and maintaining a
steady stroke of between 36 and:? 8.
crossed the finish line two lengths
ahead of the much-touted Washington
eight and seven lengths ahead of the
crew of the University of California.
The Freshmen defeated their speedy
rivals hy a good three-quarters of a
boat length.
Weather conditions on the lower
course were ideal. for a slight
chilling breeze, which was not strong
enough to kick up the watei, the
lower course on the Estuary was all
that could be desired. Because of the
fact that earlier in the morning it
looked as if the day might end with
rather rough water it was decided to !
row the Varsity contest first, contrary
to the scheduled program, ft was
planned to postpone the Freshmen
race until a later time if it was found
too rough after the Varsity contest.
