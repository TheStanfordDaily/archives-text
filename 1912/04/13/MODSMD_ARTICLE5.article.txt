# The 						Meet.

### 
The seventh annual Interscholastic
meet has come and gone, leaving be
hind it a trail of broken records and

notable achievements. To the
small team from Citrus Union
High School goes the well
earned title to first place and

the majority of the trophies. Its two
chief point winners, Whitted and Jack
son, are a team in themselves, Whitted
being without question the best young
hurdler in the country.
The meet today was a great exhibi
tion, easily coming up to the standard
of the past. We congratulate the win
ners and to the defeated teams we say
it is no disgrace to go down in such a
contest as took place this afternoon
on the Stanford Oval. We hope that
the next Interscholastic will include
all men entered today.
