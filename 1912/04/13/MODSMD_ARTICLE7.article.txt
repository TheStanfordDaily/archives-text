# THE 						MORNING MEET.
## 
### 
Establishing a new world's inter
scholastic record in the 120 yard
hurdles Herbert Whitted of Citrus
Union made the best performance of
the morning and fixed the new figure
at :15 2-5. The former record was
two-fifths slower than the mark made
today, and was held jointly by Leavitt
and Schobinger. Leavitt made li,:s
record at the Princeton interscholastic
in 1904 and the mark was tied by
Schouinger at Chicago in 1911. Whit
ted is a wonderful performer over the
sticks and clears the barriers with an
ease and grace that is remarkable.
Not content with making a new record
in the high hurdles, the Azusa boy
came back and ran the 220 yard event
in 25 2-5 seconds, which is a new Stan
ford Interscholastic record.
The second record breaker of the
morning was High of Modesto, who
exceeded the mark made by Rice in
1910 and heaved the shot a distance of
!9 feet 10% inches in the trials of
this event.
Both heats of the hundred were done
in ten and two-fifth seconds. Mills of
Palo Alto took the first heat and the
second was a tie between Needham
of San Jose and Jackson of Citrus
