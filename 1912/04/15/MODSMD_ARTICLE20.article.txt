# ALUMNUS FOR APRIL IS LARGEST EVER PRINTED
## LEADING ARTICLE ON STUDENT CONTROL BY ROTH. Many Reports of Current Interest to Campus Residents Contained in This Issue. 
### 
The April issue of the "Stanford
Alumnus, which has just been issued,
is probably the largest regular number
of the magazine ever published. It is
exceeded in size only by the December,
1908, number, in which was incor
porated the 170-page "Trustees' Man
ual," compiled for the "Alumnus" by
G. E. Crothers, '95. The current issue
contains about sixty pages of reading
matter, and furnishes a comprehensive
review of the year's activities at the
University. The number has been
mailed to every graduate, whether he
is a subscriber or not, with the idea
of bringing all Stanford people into
touch with present conditions.
The chief article is naturally a dis
cussion of the recently assumed stu
dent self-government, and is by A. E.
Roth, '09. An excellent portrait of
Roth furnishes the frontispiece of the
magazine, and the first article in the
number is a history of his activities as
Student Adviser. There is also a
sketch of K. L. Schaupp, '12, who has
been elected to the oflice of Student
Adviser for next year.
Club Houses Pictured.
An article on eating-club houses is
illustrated with plans and drawings of
the proposed buildings by W. Knowles,
'9f>, based on preliminary sketches by
F. C. Brown, '11.
The excellent condition of Student
Body finance is shown by a tabular
statement, covering the year to dfite,
prepared by Graduate Manager D. W.
Rurbank, '09, and elaborated by edi
torial comment on the meaning of the
figures.
Brief articles set forth the present
status of the Women's Club-house
campaign and that for the Stanford
Union. Professor J. P. Mitchell, '02,
presents the achievements of the Stu
dents' Guild from the beginning in
189"> to the present day.
The Alumnus is urgent in its advice
to graduates to take part in this year's
Commencement Week celebration, and
gives considerable space to the matter.
Explain Alumni Enterprises.
In one article have been gathered
together a number of the enterprises
that have been undertaken by the
alumni for the good of the University.
Resides this, there are briefer articles
on separate activities, such as that on
the Advisory Roard, from the pen of
Dennis Searles, '9~Â», the retiring presi
dent, and on the Alumni Endowment
Fund.
As usual, the proceedings of the
Roard of Trustees are presented, and
the address of Trustee Horace Davis
in the Assembly Hall on Founders'
Day, which made such a deep impres
sion on those who heard it, is reprinted
in full.
