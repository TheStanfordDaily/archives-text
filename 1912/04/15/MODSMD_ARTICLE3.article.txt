## NEW SKIPPER HAS STROKED IN THREE VICTORIES. Malatesta is Chosen by California to Lead Her on the Water Next Spring.

John Frederick Partridge, '12, will
be captain of the Stanford crew for
1913. After the double Stanford vic
tories, Saturday, on the Oakland es
tuary, the crews went to the St. Mark's
hotel, where nominations for the lead
ership of the crew for next year were
called for and Partridge was unani
mously elected.
Partridge has stroked on three vic
torious Stanford crews, holding that
position in the shell of his Freshman
eight, and also on the Varsities of
1910 and this year. In 1911 he remain
ed out of college.
The captain-elect does not confine
his athletic talents to crew alone, but
played rugby with his Freshman team
against California and has been on two
Varsity teams. He registers from San
Rafael in the Civil Engineering depart
ment, and is a member of the Sigma
Alpha Epsilon fraternity.
On the return of the California crew
to the Amador, Saturday, they elected
S. Malatesta to be captain for the en
suing year. As does Partridge, Mala
testa strokes for his crew.
