# Senior Week.
## 
### 
Senior week with all its attendant!
exercises in almost upon us. Stanford

is now developing a season
of end term ceremonies and
entertainments that eventu
ally will attain a truly dis- i

tinctive character. The class of 1911
very fortunately harl the initiative to
attempt a truly original Senior week
and the present graduating class is
doing its utmost to follow the prece
dent set last year.
Every student ought to make an
attempt to remain on the campus dur
ing Senior week. A spirit of loyalty
will hold many, but the evident attrac
tions of a care free week with some
thing doing every minute in the way of
amusements should cause the 1912
Senior week to have a record attend
ance.
