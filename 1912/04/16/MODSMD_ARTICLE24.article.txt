# Baseballâ€”The National Game.
## 
### 
Almost over night a change has
come over the game that we are proud
to call the American National Sport,
and Base Ball as it will be played
with the Cork Center Hall during the
coming season, will be a more interest
ing pastime for both players and spec
tators than the game we knew or years
ago, when almost any kind of equip
ment seemed to be good enough. The
Cork Center Ball has rescued Base
Ball from the danger which was just
becoming apparent to those who have;
been watching its development for
thirty-five years past, the danger of
I getting it just a trifle too machine
like; the pitchers' battle looked good j
in print as explained by the Base Hall j
\ scribe, but did it look as good to the!
j spectator? Wouldn't he have rather
j seen a couple of base hits and perhaps'
ja two or three bagger, if not indeed,
| a smashing home run? Would the l
; pitchers' battle bring him back to see
I another game, or the contest where
(there was plenty of hitting or base
running.
The cork center makes a ball that
is just a trifle livelier than the old
style ball and it makes a ball that will
hold its life right through the game.
Taking an old style ball that might
stay in play for nine innings we would
find it very brisk for the first three,
then it would slow up for the next
three, and the last third of the game
we weren't sure just what was the
matter, but we always imagined the
players were a little tired. The ball
was dead and the game slowed up, but
with a cork center ball it stays lively
right through.
