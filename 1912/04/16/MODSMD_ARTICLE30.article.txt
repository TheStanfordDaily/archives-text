# VACATION EMPLOYMENT.
## 
### 
Last Summer fifteen students made
$40.0!) to $100.00 weekly as salesmen
under my direction. Rusiness expan
sion this year gives me five times as
much territory as last year.
We have a straight business propo
sition, no house to house canvassing,
no books, views, "Samples" or "Out
fits" to sell you. High grade men only
can be used.
Mail your application and 1 will refer
you to last year's men.
