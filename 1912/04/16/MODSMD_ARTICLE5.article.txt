# KING CARNIVAL TO REIGN ON MAY 16
## MONSTER FESTIVAL PLANNED BY SENIORS. Great Evening of Jollification and Revel to Follow Close of Semester's Work. 
### 
King Carnival will reign supreme
on the campus tlie niglit of May 16.
On this occasion the Class of 1912 will
present the second Senior Carnival as
a part of the Commencement Week
festivities. The Carnival this year, ac
cording to the committee in charge,
will be a masquerade, differing in this
respect from the Carnival of last year
when the revellers were not en
masque.
The Class of 1911 was the first to
make the Carnival a part of Senior
Week. Last year coming as it did the
night after the play and the night after
the last examinations, the event was a
sreat success and was participated in
by a large crowd of people from the
campus and the nearby tctwns. Many
students stayed over for this evening
of jollification who did not remain for
the whole week of festivity.
The Carnival this year comes at the
same time as during last Senior Week.
The night of May 10 is that of the day
after the last final examinations. All
the cares of the semester will be
banished on this occasion.
The Parade.
A monster parade on the morning of
the 16th will start the festival. En
tries are wanted from organizations,
classes, and individuals. Prizes are
to be awarded the best class entry and
the best individual entry. The Stan
ford Band will furnish the parade
music.
The Carnival will take place on the
row as last year. The street will be
brilliantly illuminated and conces
sions will be run in all the houses.
Dancing will be the most prominent
form of amusement. A nickle a dance
will be the charge for this form of
diversion. A parade will be held that
night and red-fire will form a part of
the evening's display.
The Senior Carnival Committee, of
which C. R. Nunan is chairman, is
ready to grant concessions now. The
first applicants will receive the
choicest of the allotments. The com
mittee desires to make arrangements
as soon as possible for these stunts
as the final plan is wanted by the
Senior Week Committee.
