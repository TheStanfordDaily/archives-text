Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Concerning those backstair loungers
who, having been hospitably fed and
having received the charity of the
merrymakers, go in and steal the food
destined for other mouths. This ar
ticle refers to those particular roughs
who have no self-respect, no pride,
and merely a selfish devotion to their
stomachs. Such loafers are absolutely
below contempt, both morally and
economically.
At one sorority house, which has al
ways been very generous to these
tramps, half the food was taken from
the kitchen. Of course, this shuts out
all chance of their mendicant brethern
ever obtaining "eats" there again.
There is no word sufficiently mean
to fit them. We can see them as they
hurry slyly away like frightened rats,
as they laugh their voracious laugh
and wolf their ill-gotten gains, these
foul outcasts from the great unwash
ed. Probably it is the same parcel of
mental and moral degenerates which
committed depredations upon baskets
of sandwiches left in Encina Hall in
the expectation that some slight spark
of honor migh remain in the meanest,
and that they would pay for what they
took. Probably from a perverted sense
of humor they took these, if so, they
should join Chappie. Tf not, they
should be fired, for they are only a
blot on Stanford's fair name.
