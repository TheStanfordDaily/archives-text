# EIGHTEEN DANCES ON 1912 BALL PROGRAM.
## McDonald's Orchestra to Furnish the Music For Affair at Vendome on May 20. 
### 
Vendome Hotel, San Jose, has been
selected as the place for holding the

this nature. The ball-room, large
grounds, dining-room, and other faci
lities are unrivalled in the nearby
towns.

i program for the evening. This number
J is the same as that danced last year
land proved very acceptable at the 1911
: Rail. Supper will be served in the
; large dining-room at small tables seat-
I ing two and four people. The supper
dance will be off the program and all
! the couples will be served at the same
j time.
McDonald's well known orchestra
will furnish the music for the dancing
and during supper. J. L. McDonald,
'14, at the piano and four other musi-
I cians will compose the orchestra.

| chosen as yet. A number of excellent
i drawings were submited to the com
mittee for their approval. The final
j choice will be made next week.

i weeks before the date selected for the
1 dance, May 2ft. The cost per couple,
I $6.Oft, will include transportation as
well as admission. Arrangements will
be made with the Peninsula Railroad
