# Meetings.
## 
### 
Two important meetings will be held
tomorrow afternoon. At 1:10 the Stu
dent Body will assemble in the Chapel

to nominate officers for
the coming year, while at
1:25 the Senior class will

hold one of the final meetings of its
college life. Both should be fully
attended, which probably will not be
the case.
During the past four years attend
ance at Student Body meetings has
steadily decreased. The present Stu
dent Body officers were nominated in
a tremendous assemblage of less than
fifty men. Considering the importance
of the offices to be filled it is hoped
that last year's miserable showing will
not be duplicated.
