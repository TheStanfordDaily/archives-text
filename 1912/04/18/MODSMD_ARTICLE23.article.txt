Containing an unusual amount of in
teresting material, the April number
of the Sequoia made its appearance on

which gives the Cardinal an even break
in the intercollegiate meet Saturday.

full page picture of track captain T. L.

a very pleasing bit of verse, "Dream

story from the pen of R. L. Duffus, '10.
S. C. Peck, '11, has contributed "At
the Plant." Editor Robinson on the
