Last Summer fifteen students made
$40.00 to $100.00 weekly us salesmen
under my direction. Business expan
sion this year gives hip live times as
much territory as last year.
W have :i straight business propo
sition, no house to house canvassing,
no books, views, "Samples" or "Out
fits ' to soil you. High grade men only
can be used.
Mail your application and I will refer
you to last year's men.
