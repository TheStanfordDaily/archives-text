Stanford and California will meet
tomorrow afternoon in the nineteenth
annual intercollegiate track and field
meet. The Cardinal athletes have an
even chance to defeat the Blue and
Gold. Captain Coleman's men will
have an advantage in that the competi
tion is to be held on the Stanford cin
d r ja!,h.
Trainer "Dad" Moulton feels confi
dent of the ability of his men to be the
victors despite the reputation of the
opposing squad. Stanford has "an
even break and if things come our way
as they should the team which is to
bring home the long end of the score
is the Cardinal."
Much hinges on the condition of
Beeson of California. The star timber
topper has competed but twice this
season and it is very probable that the
Blue and Gold runner will be greatly
handicapped by his bad ankle. His
injury should prove more serious in
the hurdles than in the high jump.
Campbell will not compete in the
low hurdles but will enter the quarter,

hundred and relay. McKee will prob
ably be among the absentees in the
sprints. His condition is such that it
may be advisable to scratch his namts
from the list of entries.

Murray and Fletcher are a duo of
mile runners who must be conceded
as certain point winners in the four
lap i ace. Both have done close to
| record time and the man who takes
| first place on Saturday will undoubted
ly do better than the 4:30 mark. G.
Wood. E. T. Worthy, A. Edwards and
E. Knight complete the Stanford entry
list. The mile promises to be one or
i the banner performances of the meet
j and will be a struggle worth going
i miles to witness.
Wita Captain Coleman, Brown and
! Campbell entered in the first event
lon th: program, Stanford should be
J place<\in an advantageous position on
tue scoreboard. Stanton and Woods
! are the California possibilities. The
j former is a Freshman with a :10 1-5
' record and seems to be better than
Woods. Coleman has never lost a
hundred yard dash while competing
against the Blue and Gold. Brown has
improved wonderfully of late and
many give him, at worst, a third place.
A shutout for California may result.
Kern and H. ,T. Smith are the Car
dinal representatives in the 120 yard
hurdles. Against them Maclise and
Beeson will be pitted. The condition
of Beeson, who has competed but twice
this season in the high sticks, makes
it difficult to properly place him, but
the most conservative can not give
Stanford better than a third.

meet. The Cardinal athletes have an
even chance to defeat the Blue and
Gold. Captain Coleman's men will
have an advantage in that the competi
tion is to be held on the Stanford cin
d r ja!,h.
Trainer "Dad" Moulton feels confi
dent of the ability of his men to be the
victors despite the reputation of the
opposing squad. Stanford has "an
even break and if things come our way
as they should the team which is to
bring home the long end of the score
is the Cardinal."
Much hinges on the condition of
Beeson of California. The star timber
topper has competed but twice this
season and it is very probable that the
Blue and Gold runner will be greatly
handicapped by his bad ankle. His
injury should prove more serious in
the hurdles than in the high jump.
Campbell will not compete in the
low hurdles but will enter the quarter,

hundred and relay. McKee will prob
ably be among the absentees in the
sprints. His condition is such that it
may be advisable to scratch his namts
from the list of entries.

Murray and Fletcher are a duo of
mile runners who must be conceded
as certain point winners in the four
lap i ace. Both have done close to
| record time and the man who takes
| first place on Saturday will undoubted
ly do better than the 4:30 mark. G.
Wood. E. T. Worthy, A. Edwards and
E. Knight complete the Stanford entry
list. The mile promises to be one or
i the banner performances of the meet
j and will be a struggle worth going
i miles to witness.
Wita Captain Coleman, Brown and
! Campbell entered in the first event
lon th: program, Stanford should be
J place<\in an advantageous position on
tue scoreboard. Stanton and Woods
! are the California possibilities. The
j former is a Freshman with a :10 1-5
' record and seems to be better than
Woods. Coleman has never lost a
hundred yard dash while competing
against the Blue and Gold. Brown has
improved wonderfully of late and
many give him, at worst, a third place.
A shutout for California may result.
Kern and H. ,T. Smith are the Car
dinal representatives in the 120 yard
hurdles. Against them Maclise and
Beeson will be pitted. The condition
of Beeson, who has competed but twice
this season in the high sticks, makes
it difficult to properly place him, but
the most conservative can not give
Stanford better than a third.
