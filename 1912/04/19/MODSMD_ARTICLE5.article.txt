# CAPTAIN T.L. COLEMAN.
## 
### 
Thomas Lynch Coleman, who
will lead the Varsity in to
morrow's meet is the fastest
sprinter that has ever worn the
cardinal colors. Coleman holds
the Intercollegiate records for
both of the dashes. In the hun
dred the speedy sprinter has
repeatedly been caught at ;10
flat and the Stanford-California
record is accredited to him at
this mark. The furlong is
Coleman's best race. The rec
ord for this race was set by the
Stanford captain at an even
twenty-two seconds. With the
great sprinter in shape, many
confidentially expect better
time in this event.

Quarter is Stanford's.
Stanford has won five points in the
quarter for so many years that it has
become traditional for a Cardinal run
ner to break the tape first. With an
entry list which includes Taylor, who
tied with Leaman for first in the 1911
meet, Campbell, Wallace, Millsap, Robb
and Gard, Stanford should again an
nex the majority of the points. Camp
bell has covered the quarter in the
fastest time and he is expected to make
a great race for the five points. The
veteran Taylor has demonstrated his
ability to come through in competition
and he should be well up among the
leaders. Wallace is another man who
has shown to advantage in the last
few weeks of training.
With Crabbe as the main-stay of the
Dine and Gold in the two mile, first
place must be given to the Califor
nians. Dodge, the new Stanford record
holder in this event, should take sec
ond. 1'rice and Bevier will fight it
out. with Rathbone of California as the
best of the remaining entries, but the
Stanford men appear to "have it on"
their rival from across the bay. The
record in this race should be broken
