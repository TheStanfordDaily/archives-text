# CAPTAIN T.L. COLEMAN.
## 
### 
Thomas Lynch Coleman, who
will lead the Varsity in to
morrow's meet is the fastest
sprinter that has ever worn the
cardinal colors. Coleman holds
the Intercollegiate records for
both of the dashes. In the hun
dred the speedy sprinter has
repeatedly been caught at ;10
flat and the Stanford-California
record is accredited to him at
this mark. The furlong is
Coleman's best race. The rec
ord for this race was set by the
Stanford captain at an even
twenty-two seconds. With the
great sprinter in shape, many
confidentially expect better
time in this event.

Quarter is Stanford's.
Stanford has won five points in the
quarter for so many years that it has
become traditional for a Cardinal run
ner to break the tape first. With an
entry list which includes Taylor, who
tied with Leaman for first in the 1911
meet, Campbell, Wallace, Millsap, Robb
and Gard, Stanford should again an
nex the majority of the points. Camp
bell has covered the quarter in the
fastest time and he is expected to make
a great race for the five points. The
veteran Taylor has demonstrated his
ability to come through in competition
and he should be well up among the
leaders. Wallace is another man who
has shown to advantage in the last
few weeks of training.
With Crabbe as the main-stay of the
Dine and Gold in the two mile, first
place must be given to the Califor
nians. Dodge, the new Stanford record
holder in this event, should take sec
ond. 1'rice and Bevier will fight it
out. with Rathbone of California as the
best of the remaining entries, but the
Stanford men appear to "have it on"
their rival from across the bay. The
record in this race should be broken

tomorrow as Dodge promises to give
Crabbe every opportunity to learn that
j he is in a real contest.
California places her reliance on
! Beeson and Maclise to win the low
hurdles. As in the high sticks, Kern
and Smith are the Stanford runners.
| If Beeson is in as bad shape as he is
j reported to be in, the race he will run
: in the 120 yard barriers will not work
to his advantage in the longer race.
This is likely to prove his undoing and
the fight for first place will lie between
Kern and Maclise. The Cardinal run
ner may always be depended upon to
do his best in the big meet.
Two Places in Furlong.
First and third places are Stanford's
in the 220 yard dash with Coleman and
! Brown as her representatives. The
Stanford leader is too fast for either
i Stanton or Hazeltine and there seems
; to be little fear that he will be unable
to end his career on the Varsity track
with anything but a second victory
j for the day.
Bonnett, Murray, Fletcher, Angell
and Cullen. This is the quintet of half
milers who have made it advisable for
the California trainer to enter Wood
in the SBO yard run and who have
given the "dopesters" a claim to a
clean sweep for Stanford in this event.
Freshman Bonnett has made the best
time of any of the Cardinal half milers
I and he is picked for the five point
place. O. Smith is the best of the
: Bine and Gold veterans.
Should Annex Relay.
; Stanford is to place her chances.for
a victory in the relay in the care of
ja quartet of quarter mile men who
l must be ranked considerably above any
I combination which the rival university
! can together from her squad. Camp
bell, Taylor, Wallace, Needham, Robb
and Millsap are the rimers from whose
number the team will be picked.
In the field sports, California rightly
claims a majority of the points. The
weights are the events in which Wal
ter Christie expects to make a sweep.
Alderman has been the high mark man
with the hammer during the prelimin
ary season and if he gets in a good
heave tomorrow at least a second place
is his. Woolley is one of the most con-
I sistent weightmen who has ever worn
a Stanford track uniform.
! Kretsinger is Out.
With Kretsinger, the California cap
i tain, out of the broad, Stanford should
take two places. Morrison and Arga
j brite are the men who are expected to
place for the Cardinal. Allen has the
record but his season's performances
have not been of such high order that
he should be putin the infallible class.
Miller, Stephens and Peake are the
most reliable of the Stanford pole
vaulters. Miller is another performer
' who shows to best advantage when his
[ altitude-ascending proclivities mean
the most. Vail seems to be the most
dangerous of the Blue and Gold
vaulters. McCreadv, Boulware and
.Tordon can be relied upon to give
! a good account, of themselves and the
jfigurers will find some changes in
'their distribution of points.
I Even California takes off its hat to
Horine as the champion of his class in
'the high jump. The wonderful Slan
ford leaper has never gone under six
feet this year. For him a jump equal
ling the intercollegiate record of fi
feet 3 inches seems to be but a prac
tice effort. When this event is over
on Saturday there is not likely to be
a joint record holder in the hiu;h jump
column. Beeson should take second
and Finney of Stanford has an excel
lent chance for a third.
