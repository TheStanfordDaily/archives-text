The Stanford track team faces a
hard problem tomorrow. Early in the
season there appeared to be scarcely

a chance of victory over the
wonderful, veteran team of
the University of California.

Three months have considerably alter
ed the situation. Tomorrow Captain
Coleman will lead into the contest a
team that has good chances of winning
a majority of points.
The men trained by Christie are a
clever lot of athletes and their ability
must not be underestimated, but the
Daily Palo Alto has a good deal of con
fidence in that brand of nerve tonic
known as the "Stanford Spirit." Win
or lose, the Varsity track team will
play the game fair and maintain Stan
ford's high standards of sportsmanship.
