A. L. Adams lectured on "Water
Works Evaluation" today to the En
gineering students. He took the
broad stand, stating that all engineers
should have a knowledge at least of
accounts and social and political econ
omics. In conclusion he said "If you
have ambitions to represent the great
profession to which you aspire, do
not try to crowd too much technical
knowledge into too short a time but
get as much broad training as possible
and trust to the future for the rest.
Mr. Adams is a prominent consulting
engineer of San Francisco.
