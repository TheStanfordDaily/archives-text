# CARDINAL CHESS MEN LOSE TO CALIFORNIA.
## Contest Was Closely Contested at Every Pointâ€”Stanford Lost to Better Team. 
### 
The California team made a clean
sweep of the Stanford chess players in
the intercollegiate match held last
night, winning seven games. The Ber
keley players won four of the con
tests with but little trouble, the other
three matches, however, were close
and well-played.
H. A. Hackett, '13, L. D. Sweet, '13,
and E. R. Nusbaum, '15, put up the
best games for Stanford. Sweet and
C. F. Woo:!, '13, one of California's
veterans and best men, played over an
hour before a single chessman was
taken off the board. The Cardinal
Freshman was the only Stanford play
er to continue the game until the time
limit, which had been set as 1:30 this
morning.
For California, E. W. Gruer, '12, and
F. Fimball, '12, were the stars. Kim
ball put up a splendid game, unex
pectedly defeating R. L. Vaughn, '12,
the Stanford captain. Vaughn's de
feat came as a surprise as he was
conceded an easy victory. He was de
cidely out of form last night and is
capable of a much beter game than
he put up.
This is California's second win on
the Rice Cup.
