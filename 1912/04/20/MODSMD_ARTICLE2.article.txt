# VAST THRONG CHEERS ATHLETES TO VICTORY
## THOUSANDS WITNESS THE BIG INTERCOLLEGIATE. One of Largest Crowds Ever at Stanford-Rooting Sections Are Feature.

An enthusiastic throng that cram
med vantage points overlooking the
Stanford Oval today viewed the nine
teeenth annual contest between the
Cardinal athletes and the wearers of
the Blue and Gold. Never in the his

been working on the tracks and the
take-offs for the jumps, and they did

From the start of the meet at 2

trial in the pole vault, the events were
run off as scheduled without delays,
thanks to careful arrangement of the
officials. At no time was the patience
of the bleacherites tested by long waits
as the field events held their atten
tion between the time when the track
was not occupied.
Predictions as to the closeness of
the meet brought the rooters to the
