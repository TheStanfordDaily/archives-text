Stanford's valiantly fighting track
and field athletes went down to defeat
this afternoon before one of the strong
est teams in the country. Although
they suffered the usual eleventh-hour
surprises and disappointments, the
Cardinal rooters acknowledged defeat
to a superior aggregation of point
winners. A recurrence of Coleman's
old injury, which made it impossible
for him to annex first or second in the
hundred and prevented him from leav
ing his marks in the furlong, was per
haps the severest blow the Stanford
team suffered. A wind which seemed
to blow from all directions at once and
was especially severe in the early part
of the meet, did not prevent seven
Stanford-California records from being
shattered in this remarkable contest.
The tradition which says that no
man can win the mile two years in
lsuccession was upheld today when
Fletcher beat the record-holder Wood,
and hung up a new record in the
event. This was the first and one of
the prettiest races of the day.
Crabbe Breaks Record.
As was expected, Crabbe, the sturdy
California distance man, outran his
rivals !ti the two mile, and finished
20 yards ahead of Dodge of Stanford.
He broke the Intercollegiate record es
tablished by himself last year and set

tance. lie ran a heady, strong race
throughout and was never pressed
when once he took the lead.
The first real upset of the dope sheet
resulted in the placing of Coleman
third in the hundred. Freshman Stan
ton of California took advantage of his
early lead and annexed first. The race
showed that Captain Coleman's in
jured leg was troubling him and he
was seen to limp off the track.
Captain Coleman broke down at the
very start of the two-twenty and had

not run more than ten yards when he
crumpled np on the track. It was a
recurrence of the old injury and Stan
ford's hopes were Anally shattered
with the loss of their Captain and the
race which everyone had conceded to
him. Stanton and Woods of California
repeated their performance of the hun
dred yard dash by taking first and
second two-fifths of a second slower
than Coleman's record time of two
years ago. Rrown of Stanford ran a
pretty race and finished an easy
third.

yards, when Todd caught him and won
