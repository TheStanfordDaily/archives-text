# The 						Meet.
## 
### 
California won the uineteenth an
nual track meet with a team that has

no peer in America. The Blue
and Gold stars can defeat any
college team in the country
in a dual meet and Stanford

simply went down to a better team.
Captain Coleman and his men made
a game fight to the finish and nothing
more could be asked. They played the
game like the true sportsmen they are
and accepted defeat with the same
grace they would have greeted victory.
