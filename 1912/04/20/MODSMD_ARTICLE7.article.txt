### 
Washington won the second game
: and the series from Stanford this
morning when the visitors scored 13
times in a slow ragged game.
The contest was full of errors on
each side and during the two hours
which it dragged out twenty-eight hits
were knocked out by the combined
! teams.
' A high wind was responsible for
much of the ragged playing but a gen
eral lack of aggressiveness was ap
parent on each side. In the first in
ning the visitors took a liking to
Freshman McLaughlin's offerings and
scored seven runs on five hits com
bined with four Stanford errors. At
this stage of the game he was relieved
by Howe.
With a score of 7-0 against them the
Varsity opened up on Johnson and
scored three runs on three hits in
their half of the same inning. Terry
tripled to right, Gault singled infield,
and stole second while Terry scored
on the second baseman's wild throw to
the plate. Obear walked and together
with Ganlt crossed the plate on Cass'
single.
Tn the third inning Terry singled
after two were out. Gault walked and
stole second. Obear then selected a
fat one and hit it for a homer.
Washington added a run in the third
and another in the seventh. Tn the
eighth four combined hits scored four
runs and cinched the game.
Stanford added three more in this
same inning. Noble and Childs singled.
Henshaw hit into a double. Howe
walked and Noble scored on Terry's
fourth hit. Gault then scored Howe
with a single. Terry crossed the platt.
a moment later on an error. Gault
was caught at home for the third out.
Terry hit safely four times while
Patten again proved to be the best
visiting batsman, getting three extra
hits.
