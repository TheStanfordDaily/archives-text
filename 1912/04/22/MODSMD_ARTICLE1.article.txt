# ANNUAL MEET IS STILL STUDENTS' MAIN TOPIC
## SOME INTERESTING FEATURES OF SATURDAY'S EVENTS. Meritorious Performances of Stanford Athletes Will Long be Remembered in Athletics. 
### 
Even though the
nineteenth annual
intercollegiate meet
is now a matter of
athletic history,
nevertheless natur
ally the doings of
the track men on
Saturday are still
uppermost in the
minds of the stu
dents. In the ex
citement attendant

on the meet some of the most inter
esting events of the afternoon were
overlooked.
Fletcher's wonderful performance in
the mile when he set the new inter
collegiate record at 4:28 2-5 will long
be remembered as one of the bright
marks of the meet. His race was a
fine exhibition of head-work and his
win is deserving of lasting praise. In
winning the relay the Cardinal team
made an average time of :50 3-5 for
the four laps. Wallace, who saved the
race for Stanford, was clocked in
: 41) 2-5. His remarkable run recalls
the 1909 meet when Miller and Wyman
changed a certain defeat into a Stan
ford relay victory. Three of the Car
dinalites, Millsap, Richdala and Wal
lace, were winning their "S" for the
first time.
Captain Coleman's injury was one of
the most unfortunate that could have
befallen Stanford, as he would have
been able to have taken both sprints
had he been in condition. The Stan
ford leader ran his last twenty yards
after having broken down and deserves
credit for his gritty finish.
Among the men who will receive the
Varsity emblem, J. E. Woolley, '12, will
be awarded four stars. Woolley has
been one of the most consistent weight
men who has yet performed for either
university. During the past season he
has accomplished one of the most won
derful feats in athletic history. His
weight is but 155 pounds and his best
throw was nearly 154 feet. His form
in throwing has been his means of
overcoming a handicap of weight.
By placing third in the broad jump
Argabrite wins the right, to a second
Varsity emblem for the 1912 season.
His other "S" was won in baseball.
Campbell was handicapped by his
injured foot in both his races and as
a result of his work in the hundred and
quarter he is barely able to put any
weicrht on his foot.
Tn comparison with the number oi
Stanford point winners in the 1911
meet this year's number is larger by
eleven. Twenty-two Is the 1912 total.
Tn event except the low hurdles
and the half the marks set on Satur
day are equal to or better than those
of last season's big meet.
