All college activities and other light
diversions from the serious pursuits of
culture and intellectual refinement are

over for the semester, and
1540 out of the one thousand
five hundred and forty stu-

dents of Stanford University are going
into light training for final examina
tions. Lest too ardent attention to
books should drive away all thought
of Senior Week, we take this occasion
to remind that Senior Week means
something at Stanford. The class of
1912 is exerting itself to make the
commencement period enjoyable and
the other classes should assist as
much as possible.
The semester does not end on the
last day of examinations. The final
curtain on the scene of the year's ac
tivities is rung five days later, on Com
mencement day. One thousand stu
dents should remain for the final
ceremonies this year.
