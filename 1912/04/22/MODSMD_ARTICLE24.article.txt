# JORDAN CLUB TO SURVEY CALIFORNIA REDWOOD PARK.
## 
### 
The Jordan Club, the graduate club
iu Biology, at a recent meeting, ar
ranged to make a biological survey of
the California Redwood Park in the Big
Basin.
This work has been put into the
hands of Dr. Abrams, Dr. Fisher and
Dr. McCracken as an executive com
mittee. Much of the actual work will
be done at the Park during summer
vacations and the assistance of stu
dents in the biological sciences will be
gladly welcomed.
The work will be pursued in memory
of Professor Dudley, whose activity in
securing this Redwood forest as a state
reservation through purchase is well
known.
The Jordan Club has been assured
by members of the Park Commission of
their interest and hearty cooperation,
and it is hoped that something in the
way of a handbook available for public
use will be the outcome of the ac
tivity of this committee.
