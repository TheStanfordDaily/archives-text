# STANFORD QUAD NOW IN HANDS OF THE BINDER
## YEAR BOOK WILL BE DELIVERED ON CAMPUS MAY 1. First of Its Kind to Contain Sorority Picturesâ€”Has Full Account of Year's Athletics. 
### 
With a full resume of the Stanford
year of 1911-12 between its crimson
covers and teeming with features that
will make it one of the best publica
tions of its kind ever issued, Vol. XIX
of the Stanford Quad will be on sale
on the campus May 1. The printing
of the book was held back in order to
secure an account of the Intercollegi
ate Track Meet. The last pages came
off the presses last night and this
morning they were sent to the binder.
For the first time since the Quad
has been making its annual appear
ance, this year's number will contain
pictures of the Stanford Sororities.
The usual cuts of the teams, athletes,
fraternities, clubs and all organiza
tions will be found, as well as an extra
large josh department.
In addition to a full account of the
year's athletics, the Quad will contain
an appendix in which will be all In
tercollegiate records, Stanford-Cali
fornia records and the best times and
distances of the Stanford Interscholas
tic Meets. These records are all up
to date.
Besides the records, the appendix
will contain a list of all the most im
portant office holders since the stu
dent body was first organized.
The mechanical work on the hook
is of the very best brand, a feature that
makes its heavy sale assured. The
printing was clone by the Bolte-Braden
company, the cuts are from the shops
of the Sierra Art & Engraving Co., and
John Kitchen is doing the binding.
These are all San Francisco firms.
The paper is up to the usual high
standard and the cover will be simi
lar to those of other issues.
A smaller number of books than
usual are being bound and it is prob
able that the demand will surpass the
supply. Books are to be sold for
$2.50. Juniors having receipts from
Manager S. W. Guthrie, '13, must pre
sent them in order to receive their
cheques.
