# SCOTT WILL WITHDRAW FROM BOXING TOURNAMENT.
## Welterweight Champion Remains Out of Competition to Increase Entry List. 
### 
Owing to the small entry list in
the welterweight class in the annual
boxing tournament, E. T. Scott, '13,
University champion in this weight
division, has withdrawn from the com
petition. Scott is considered the peer
of any boxer in Stanford at this
weight, and it is believed that his
withdrawal will materially increase
the nnmber of entries. He will assist
H. W. Maloney as referee of the
tournament.
The weight limit in the welter
weight division is 140 to 147 pounds.
As in the other divisions, a handsome
medal will be awarded the winner.
The preliminaries in the annual
boxing tournament will be held in En
cina gymnasium Thursday evening at
eight o'clock. The finals will begin
next Monday.

May 15 to 20 will witness the great
est Senior Week ever held at Stan
ford. The complete program as an
nounced tonight insures five days and
five nights of diversions which it is
hoped will insure the attendance of
every student in the University, as well
as each member of the faculty.
The impression has been spread thai
Senior Week is intended primarily
for the queeners. This is not true as
anyone who has ever remained to a
Senior Week will testify. There is
to be plenty of amusement for the non
queener. This year Senior Week will
provide a good time for all. The Class
of 1912 invites everyone connected
with the University to stay for the
whole or part of Commencement Week
and guarantees that there will be no
disappointments.
The program of events commences
with the Senior Supper at the lake oiÂ«
Wednesday, May 15. That night the
farce, "Fannie's Relations," will be
staged in the Assembly Hall. Thursday
will be Underclassmen's Day. The

j Stanford Carnival, which is to be a
costume and mask affair this year, will
be the attraction for that day. Friday
of the week is Class Day.
| Olympian Tryouts.
Saturday, May 18, will be a red let
ter day for Stanford, for on this day
will be held the try-outs for the Olym
pic Games. Picked athletes from all
over the Pacific Slope will compete on
j the Stanford Oval for places on the
team which is to represent the United
States this summer at the games which
are to take place in Sweden, This
i event will draw men from all over the
| Pacific Coast and it alone should keep
| a large percentage of the men on the
campus. The last events of the week
on Baccalaureate Sunday and on Mon
day, Commencement Day, with the ex
ception of the Senior Rail orr the night
of the last day. are principally for the
Seniors. The Senior Ball is the best
I dance of the year and should prove an
I attraction which will keep many here.
The Senior Committees and members
of the faculty are working hard to
make Commencement Week stand for
something at Stanford. At the univer
sities in the east and middle west this
week draws many alumni back to their
alma mater and keeps all the under
graduates on the campus. In this way
the alumni are kept in touch with the
active college life, old associations are
renewed and a university spirit is fos
tered and kept alive with the result
that the University's prestige is in
creased immeasureably. Stanford is
the only university of any size which
does not have a Commencement Week
which stands for something. It is up
to the present student body to stay and
help create a spirit which will in time
result in Stanford's Senior Week
being an important event in the
life of the alumni and undergraduates.
