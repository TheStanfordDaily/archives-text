# WILL STUDY EFFECTS OF WAR ON THE SOUTH
## TO UNDERTAKE NEW WORK FOR PEACE CAUSE. Dr. Jordan and Professor Krehbiel Will Visit Battlefields of Georgia and Virginia. 
### 
In accordance with his expressed
intention of devoting most of his spare
time to the international peace move
ment, Dr. David Starr Jordan will
spend the greater part of his leisure
moments this summer vacation in this
great cause. Unlike last summer,

the Daily Palo Alto, will travel with
the two peace workers as secretary.

Professor Krehbiel will work is a new

is being carried on now by Professor
V. L. Kellogg of this University for the
first time in Europe, with a view to
finding the cost in verility as well as
in blood and money of the "red road
to empire."
In brief, the work will consist in the
gathering of vital statistics in regions
which have been most affected by war
in an effort to put on a more scientific
basis the biological consequences of
war. The investigations will be car
ried on under the World Peace Founda

Will Visit Battle Fields.
The investigations will be conducted
in those parts of the South which were
the scenes of the hardest fighting and
the greatest devastation during the
Civil War. Georgia and Virginia have
