An impression seems to prevail that
Senior Week is reserved for the
exclusive enjoyment of "queeners."
Nothing could be farther
Senior from the truth. While of
Week, course the Senior Ball would
be a trifle incomplete without
the "queeners," yet all other attrac
tions of Commencement Week are so
designed that the undergraduates in
general can participate. Senior week
fittingly caps the collegiate year and
its round of gayeties is not planned to
aid or abet Cupid in any way, shape or
manner whatsoever.
