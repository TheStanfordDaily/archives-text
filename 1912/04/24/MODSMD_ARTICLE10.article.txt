# On to Poughkeepsie.

### 
This year Stanford has been for
tunate in developing a crew many ex
perts claim to be without an equal

in the country. Coni
bear, the Washington
crew director, says
his men were beaten

fairly and squarely by a better eight,
an eight that would hold its own any
where. O'Day, a veteran Wisconsin
oarsman and a recognized rowing
authority, similarly commends the
Stanford crew.
Comparative times show that the
Varsity would have an excellent
chance against the best crews of the
East. Why not give western boating
a chance to measure itself against the
recognized leaders of this branch of
sport, by sending the 1912 eight to the
great Poughkeepsie regatta?
This regatta Is the annual blue rib
bon event of the rowing world and in
it are entered Pennsylvania, Cornell,
Syracuse, Columbia and Wisconsin.
To win the eight-oare.d race on the
Hudson is the proudest boast of a col
lege crew and we are confident that
the Stanford men can make good even
against the famous Cornell crews
turned out by Courtney.
Today the crew followers are in
augurating a movement to gather the
funds to send the Varsity to Pough
keepsie. It is a cause that deserves
the assistance of all Stanford men,
graduates or undergraduates, and of
lovers of rowing on the Pacific Coast.
