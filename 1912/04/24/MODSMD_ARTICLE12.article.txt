In order that Stanford may win more
track meets, she must have more long
distance runners. It is the second and
third place men who count as much, if
not more, than a few first place men
when it comes to winning meets.
Cornell is a university not very
much larger than Stanford, and yet
it has the greatest bunch of long dis
tance men in the world. It has right
at the present time four men in col
lege capable of running under 4:25 and
a two-miler good for 9:30, one half a
minute better than Stanford's best, not
to speak of a half-miler good for 1:54.
Cornell has no better men in col
lege than Stanford or surely any more
men to draw their material from.
What is the reason? It is Cornell's
wonderful activity in the line of cross
country running. Hundreds of men
train all fall and develope into won
derful cross country runners. In the
spring many of these same men beat
records on the track in the distance
runs.
Why shouldn't this be the case at
Stanford. Last year a little bunch of
ten or fifteen men trained faithfully
for two or three weeks and as a result
Stanford got about nine or ten points
more than they were expecting in the
distances.
If Stanford developes an interest
in cross country running, Stanford will
win lots of track meets. Already plans
are under way to hold a big cross
country race after the Big Game in
November. A cup will be given to the
winner and it has been suggested that
the class sweaters be awarded to the
first three place men. Varsity men
will take the matter up with the be
ginning of the fall semester and there
will be no more lacking to lead these
runs which ought to take place three
nights a week for three or four months.
Let everybody boost!!!
Here's to Cross Country Running!!!
