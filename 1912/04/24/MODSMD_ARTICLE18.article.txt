# Heney Speaks For Roosevelt.
## 
### 
Francis J. Heney materially assisted
Roosevelt's chances for nomination in
a speech last night at the Armory.
Heney denounced bull-headed adher
ence to the constitution and law. He
then extolled the ex-President's keen
appreciation of the needs of the people
above the "justice" of the constitution.
