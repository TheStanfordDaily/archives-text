## PLANS CONSIDERED TO ALLOW ATHLETES TO PARTICIPATE IN PREMIER INTERCOLLEGIATE EVENT OF THE YEAR.

Stanford Varsity versus Cornell ver
sus Columbia versus Peunslyvania
versus Wisconsin versus Syracuse,
June 20 on the Hudson at Pough
keepsie!
A Stanford Varsity crew may take
part in the greatest intercollegiate re
gatta of the year this summer if plans
now being considered are successfully
completed. The obstacles to be sur
mounted are of such minor importance
that only the co-operation of Stanford
men is necessary to enter a Stanford
j eight in the regatta.
The proposition of Stanford entering
| the regatta will be submitted to the
Executive committee tonight, as their
1 official sanction is necessary before
; definite steps can be taken to attempt
i to enter the race.
Professor W. F. Durand, formerly a
1 steward of the Poughkeepsie regatta
j directorate, sent a telegram of inquiry
' to Cornell concerning the possibility of
j the admittance of a Stanford eight to
| the entry list of the regatta. The reply
! states that Stanford might enter if
I there is a possibility of the Cardinal's
participation becoming a permanent
feature. A detailed eligibility chart
j has been mailed from Cornell. No
difficulty on this score is anticipated,
! as the rules on the Pacific coast cor
| respond in general to those of the
i East.
I Could Rorrow Shell.
Should Stanford enter the regatta,
the crew probably would row in a
shell loaned by an Eastern university.
Wisconsin rows at Poughkeepsie in
a borrowed boat On the other hand,
the new Varsity shell might be sent
direct to New York from England in
time for the meet.
The Varsity eight would have the ad
vantage of more than a month's train
ing here before leaving for the East.
Tt is believed that two weeks' training
j at Poughkeepsie would put the crew
in shape for the regatta.
If the trip is made, at least as strong
a crew as represented Stanford against
California and Washington can be sent
East, including eight men, a substitute
and a coxswain. One member of the
party could manage the trip.
Captain Seward has received a letter
from Coach Conibear saying that the
Stanford crew this year is the only one

that has beaten Washington fairly.
He is convinced that the best crew
won.
In Conibear's opinion, the Wisconsin
crew that took third in the Pough
keepsie regatta is not as good as this
year's Stanford Varsity. Wisconsin
went East handicapped by a heavy
boat,, but nevertheless held their posi
tion for two miles in a three mile race.
Coarse is Four Miles.
The regatta at Poughkeepsie is over
a four mile course. It is not believed
that a four mile race would prove too
strenuous for the present Varsity
crew. Both the 1907 and 1908 crews
rowed four miles in good form.
Referee Pat Q'Day, who has had
charge of the intercollegiate regattas
for three years and who rowed at
Wisconsin in 1908, has expressed his
opinion that the Stanford crew would
make a favorable showing at Pough
keepsie.
The intercollegiate regatta at Pough
keepsie is the greatest athletic event
of year in the East. It is certain
that the participation of a Stanford
crew in the regatta would do more to
advertise Stanford than anything else.
Dan Murphy's Dream.
It was the fondest ambition of Dan
Murphy that he might take back a
Varsity eight for the great regatta. At
that time rowing was not established
on a firm enough footing on the coast
to make the trip possible. Murphy was
the champion single scull boatman of
the world. The Murjihy stroke which
he perfected in the Stanford Varsity
is very nearly like the Pennslyvania
stroke and the Cornell form.
It is estimated that the trip should
cost, at a maximum, not more than
$2,000. It is believed that this sum
would provide all. the expenses of send
ing the 10 men East.
It ought not to prove difficult to
raise this sum, when it is considered
that subscriptions might be obtained
from the various Stanford alumni asso
ciations throughout the country. Vari
ous devotees of rowing on the coast
have indicated a willingness to con
tribute sums. This does not include
the Stanford student body, which prob
ably could offer a substantial sum to
the crew.
