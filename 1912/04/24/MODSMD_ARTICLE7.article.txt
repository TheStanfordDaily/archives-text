### 
Prince Sarath Ghosh, F. R. A. S., a
member of the Royal Household of
London, will give an open Illustrated
lecture In room 214, Friday afternoon
at 2:30. "Marvels of India" will be
the subject of this learned and titled
traveler.
Prince Ghosh does not come to
Stanford as one versed in the culture
of the East alone, but as a well
rounded scholar, lecturer, scientist,
historian and political economist of
the western type. At the age of six
teen he was made a fellow of the
Royal Astronomical Society of Eng
land, an honor which had never before
been given to one so young. He ac
companied the King and Queen of
England to the recent Royal cele
bration in India, and helped in many
of the details of the afTair.
Well Known Novelist,
He is well known, both in Europe
and America, as a novelist of great
talent. His books, "The Prince of
Destiny," and "A Thousand and One
Nights' Entertainments," have received
most favorable criticism and are wide
ly read.
His work as an economist is of the
first rank and has called the attention
of the greatest economists of England
and America, his special work being
for more political freedom of India
without revolution.
He is just returning from the Dur
bar, and is stopping for one day at
Stanford on his way from Los An
geles to Seattle.. His object in travel
ling through this country and Canada
giving lectures on India and the Dur
bar, is to bring about a closer under
standing of his country among the
Americans.
An Interesting Speaker.
A Stanford student who heard
Prince Ghosh talk in Los Angeles and
Pasadena during the spring vacation,
says that he speaks beautiful English,
and that his slides of the ancient In
dian temples ,oÂ£ the Himalaya moun
tains, and of the other wonders of
India, are among the finest he had
ever and that an Indian prince,
inspired by his Hindu patriotism, and
with the unequalled culture of Cam
bridge and Oxford, increased the in
terest many times.
This lecture promises to be of spec
ial interest to students who are in
terested in the study of the oldest
civilization in the world, and art stu
dents, for there is no place in the
world where architecture has been de
veloped to a greater degree of beauty
than in India.
