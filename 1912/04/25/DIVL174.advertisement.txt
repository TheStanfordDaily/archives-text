SMOOTHEST
TOBACCO
A REaL timber-topper this Vel
vet! It has hung from the
timbers of the warehouse for over
two years. This is to get rid of
the leaf harshness —only time and
patience can annihilate the "bite"in to
bacco. Velvet is perfect mellowness —
a flavor delightfully good — superbly
smooth. Sometimes when you are at
the dealer's ask for "Velvet" and take
a chance! It's only by comparison that
Velvet is the smoothest!
