# "1913" QUAD LEAVES THE BINDERY TODAY
## BIG ANNUAL WILL BE ON SALE MAY FIRST. Dr. Jordan's Article One of the Big Features—Cartoons Play Conspicuous Part. 
### 
Unless the unexpected happens the
191H Quad will lie placed on sale on
Wednesday, May 1. The last of the
hooks will be bound today and will
then be placed in the presses so as
to let the binding set. By allowing
the books to stand for nearly a week
there will not be the trouble that has
been experienced in the past of having
the pages fall out after a few months.
The cover of the book is red buc
cruni, the same as has been used on
all the Quads for several years. A
very neat design in black, gold and red
graces the outside front cover. It is
the work of E. B. Nelson, '11.
One of the features in this year's
book is the large number of cartoons
that appear through the book. In
stead of the customary landscape
scenes that usually occur at the head
of the Senior Record pages there is a
fourteen page series of cartoons de
picting a four years' course at Stan
ford. The Calendar of the College
Year is also profusely illustrated with
marginal cartoons. These are the
work of E. E. Manning, '13.
The josh and athletic sections are
particularly large and are full of cuts.
One of the finest features of the ath
letic department is a two page picture
of the Big Game which shows every
man on both teams in action as well
as a perfect view of the Stanford root
ing section. There are also numerous
groups and action pictures of all the
spring athletics, including a large num
ber of exclusive pictures of the Track
Meet. A separate section of the ath
letic department is given to the Minor
Sports,—tennis and soccer.
Two special articles, one by Dr. Jor
dan entitled "The Golden Age of Stan
ford," and the other, "Student Control,"
by Student Body President Karl
Schaupp, are added attractions to the
book.
