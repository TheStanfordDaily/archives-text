# RED SCARF CLUB WILL GIVE CONCERT SUNDAY.
## New Musical Organization to Make Its First Appearance at Faculty Club House. 
### 
Sunday evening at the Faculty Club
House the Red Scarf Club will en
tertain its friends with a musical pro
gram. This will be the initial ap
pearance of the organization and a
rare treat is in store for those who
care for the best music. The meeting
Sunday will not be open to the public
but only the invited friends of the
members will be admitted.
The club was organized the first of
the semester for the purpose of ad
vancing the musical talent of its mem
bers along classical lines as well as
stimulating an interest on the campus
for standard music. Meetings have
been held twice a month and every
member has appeared on a program
at least once a month. The club has
made rapid progress during the seni
le ter and Sunday's concert will be in
the nature of a finale to the semester's
work.
This club is now firmly established
and it is hoped that it will be possible
to give a series of concerts each year
in the future.
Only University students are ad
mitted to the club as active members
but much of the success of the or
ganization is due to Mr. G. C. Buehrer,
who has acted in the capacity of an
executive official and has given his
studio over to the club for the meet
ings.
The following are the members of
the club: Miss L. Jacobs, Miss A.
Wishard, Miss H. Wishard, Miss M.
Curtner, J. P. Miller, J. H. Paine, vio
lins; Miss R. Hutchinson, Miss C. San
ford, pianos; Miss I. Clark, cello; Miss
G. Davis, Miss M. Rouiller, Miss L.
Deal, E. R. Fertig, vocalists.
