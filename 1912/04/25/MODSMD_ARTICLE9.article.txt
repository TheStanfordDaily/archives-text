# REHEARSALS PROGRESSING FOR SENIOR COMEDY.
## Mathieu Declares Play is Best He Has Seen During His Coaching Career. 
### 
"So far, the 1912 Senior Play is the
best I have seen," said Coach F. L.
Mathieu at a recent rehearsal. Mr.
Mathieu is a competent judge, having
commenced his work at Stanford by
coaching the '00 play. The cast is an
exceptionally good one and the work
has been a steady improvement from
the first. All the grind will be over
before ex week begins so that only
a few rehearsals will be needed later
on to polish the production.
Tickets will go on sale on May 6th,
ten days before the play. On account
of the great plans for the 1012 Senior
Week and the reunions that will
doubtless call a large number of .the
alumnae to the campus, a large seat
.sale is anticipated.
