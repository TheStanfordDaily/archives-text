brought out fourteen boxers of vary
ing merits. Seven bouts were fought,
nearly all of which were well contested
and interesting.
The large crowd which welcomed the
beginning of the tournament, enjoyed
the continuous fighting and lustily ap
plauded the clever work of the boxers.
In the first match of the evening,
J. D. Flint, '15, won over M. M. Fogel,
'12, in the lightweight divison. Flint's
style of fighting, however, did not
please the spectators nor the judges.
In his over-anxiousness to win, Flint
resorted to slugging and because of
Ihis had his opponent groggy at the
end of the third round.
O. P. Jenkins, '13, lost to G. G. How
ard, '13, in the second bout in the light
weight division. Although the bout
was close, Howard proved the better
boxer and out-pointed his man.
Sophomores Were Fast.
The only fight between the special
weights proved to be the fastest of the
evening, the little men going at it
hammer and tongs. Up to the final
round G. M. Smyth, '14, led, but G. P.
Ross, '14, by his whirlwind finish, won
the decision.
A. S. Macdonald, * 10, defeated T. F.
Wason, '14, in the slowest match of the
tournament, the Sophomore middle
weight showing little ability as a boxer
and constantly giving ground before
Macdonald.
The second bout in the middleweight
class went to H. T. Ashford, *15, who
received the decision over 13. N. Hil
lard, '15. At the end of the third round
neither tighter had an advantage, the
judges ordering another round to be
fought before declaring the winner.
Scott Shows Class.
The next match brought out the
cleverest boxer to put on the gloves
last night. E. T. Scott, '13, easily out
pointed his opponent, C. R. Swanson,
'14. Scott showed himself to be a good
two-handed fighter and judging from
his exhibition in this bout should
easily retain his middleweight title.
F. 1?. Watkins, '14. and E. P. Dutton,
'15, put up an exceedingly fast match
for heavyweights, both men being very
quick on their feet. The Sophomore
won, but not until an extra round had
been fought, his aggressiveness earn
ing him the decision.
The men fought three rounds of two
minutes, with a rest between of the
fame length.
The bouts were refereed by H. W.
Maloney and he togther with J. A.
Macready, '13, and J. W. Vickers, '12,
acted as the pudges.

weight division. Although the bout
was close, Howard proved the better
boxer and out-pointed his man.
Sophomores Were Fast.
The only fight between the special
weights proved to be the fastest of the
evening, the little men going at it
hammer and tongs. Up to the final
round G. M. Smyth, '14, led, but G. P.
Ross, '14, by his whirlwind finish, won
the decision.
A. S. Macdonald, * 10, defeated T. F.
Wason, '14, in the slowest match of the
tournament, the Sophomore middle
weight showing little ability as a boxer
and constantly giving ground before
Macdonald.
The second bout in the middleweight
class went to H. T. Ashford, *15, who
received the decision over 13. N. Hil
lard, '15. At the end of the third round
neither tighter had an advantage, the
judges ordering another round to be
fought before declaring the winner.
Scott Shows Class.
The next match brought out the
cleverest boxer to put on the gloves
last night. E. T. Scott, '13, easily out
pointed his opponent, C. R. Swanson,
'14. Scott showed himself to be a good
two-handed fighter and judging from
his exhibition in this bout should
easily retain his middleweight title.
F. 1?. Watkins, '14. and E. P. Dutton,
'15, put up an exceedingly fast match
for heavyweights, both men being very
quick on their feet. The Sophomore
won, but not until an extra round had
been fought, his aggressiveness earn
ing him the decision.
The men fought three rounds of two
minutes, with a rest between of the
fame length.
The bouts were refereed by H. W.
Maloney and he togther with J. A.
Macready, '13, and J. W. Vickers, '12,
acted as the pudges.

nine o'clock, the semi-finals and finals
will be fought.

brought out fourteen boxers of vary
ing merits. Seven bouts were fought,

In the first match of the evening,
J. D. Flint, '15, won over M. M. Fogel,
'12, in the lightweight divison. Flint's
style of fighting, however, did not
please the spectators nor the judges.
In his over-anxiousness to win, Flint
resorted to slugging and because of
Ihis had his opponent groggy at the
end of the third round.
