# ENTIRE UNIVERSITY WILL HELP TO SEND STANFORD OARSMEN EAST
## SKULL AND SNAKES INITIATES CAMPAIGN TO MATCH CARDINAL CREW WITH BEST OF COLLEGIATE BOATMEN. 
### 
The entire student tody of the Uni
versity will rally in assembly next
week to set behind the proposition to
send the Stanford crew to Poughkeep
sie to enter the intercollegiate regatta
on June 29.
Although the exact time for the as
sembly has not yet been arranged, it
probably will be held on Tuesday or
Wednesday; at the 11:15 period if pos
sible, otherwise in the afternoon.
After the proposed trip had been ap
proved by the Executive Committee,
Skull and Snakes today took the initi
ative and launched a boosting cam
paign to give the Cardinal oarsmen a
chance to row for Ail-American honors
with the best of the crews of the East
ern universities.
Committee to Solicit.
A committee, composed of T. L. Cole
man. S. C. Kennedy and E. F. Kern,
has been named by Skull and Snakes
to direct the work of enlisting the aid
of the entire student body in providing
for the trip.
Crew men and members of the stu
dent body who are conversant with
the situation will explain the advan
tages of Stanford's participation in the
regatta.
The necessity for the cooperation of
every Stanford student in boosting for
the trip and I he assistance that will be
required of each member of the Stan
ford community in order to insure the
entry of the crew in the regatta will
be explained in detail.
That the entire membership of the
University may have a part in sending
the crew East, it has been suggested
that individual subscriptions be solicit
ed instead of calling on the organiza
tions which in the past have given
much to such propositions.
Regatta is Rig Event.
The regatta at Poughkeepsie is the
biggest athletic event of the year fti
the East. The university whose shell
first crosses the finish line on the Hud
son asks for no greater honor. The
work of the Cornell crew on the Hud
son is the pet conversational topic of
every Cornell student and alumni.
The Cardinal oarsmen, representing
the best of Pacific Toast crews, would
find the sturdiest and steadiest of corn

petitors in the eights of Cornell, Co
lumbia, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and
j Syracuse, with paid coaches and the
i advantage of rowing near home.
Nevertheless, those on the coast who
i have seen the Eastern crews row and
I know the standard of the Cardinal
boatmen are the most enthusiastic
boosters for the trip. Coach Conibear
of Washington is familiar with coach
ing methods in the East, and if the
Stanford Varsity could row away from
the best crew Conibear says he ever
had, it is argued that the Cardinal crew
certainly would have to be reckoned
on, even in a four mile race.
Would Advertise Stanford.
Participation in the regatta, at all
events, would bring the attention of
the Eastern universities to Stanford.
A transcontinental journey by a Pacific
coast university crew to compete on
equal terms with the best oarsmen of
, America could not help but advertise
Stanford.
The eligibility rules for the Pough
keepsie regatta have been received on
j the campus, and under the provisions
al' the members of the Varsity crew
are eligible to enter the race. In the
judgment of some, the eligibility rules
are not so stringent as those which
govern the annual intercolelgiate re
gatta here.
Stanford alumni already are taking
a keen interest in the proposed trip.
It is planned to send letters to all the
alumni associations and those indi
vidual members intrested in there
! gatta putting the proposition of the
'trip up to them and offering them the
I opportunity to assist in putting it
through.
The responsibility for getting behind
the proposition on the part of the mem
bers of the student body is doubly ur
gent. in order that enthusiasm in the
project may be awakened in the alumni
and their help obtained.
The executive committee will meet
again during the week-end to discuss
the proposition. Since the committee
has approved the plan, it is reasonable
to suppose that they will be in a posi
tion to lend financial aid. as they have
done before in sending athletic repre
sentatives East.
