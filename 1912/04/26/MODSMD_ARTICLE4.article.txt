# Old King Carnival Will Reign.
## 
### 
Friday, May 16, will he a gala day
on the campus. This will be Under
classman day in the Senior Week fes
tival and already such interest is
shown by the undergraduates that the
Senior Carnival Committee confidenti
aly expects its affair to far outshine
the entertainment provided by the
class of 1911.
Nine concessions have been granted
so far. but there are plenty of oppor
tunities still open for fun and merri
ment in the side show business. The
Carnival will be confined to practi
cally the same territory used last year.
