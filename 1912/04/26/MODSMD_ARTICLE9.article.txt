The campaign for funds to send the
crew to the Poughkeepsie regatta is
on in earnest. A committee composed

of S. C. Kennedy, T. L. Cole
man and E. F. Kern will have
charge of soliciting funds on

the campus, and every assistance
should be given these men in their
work.
Seven hundred and fifty dollars at
the very least must be collected from
the University community and it is
hoped that more can be obtained.
Stanford wants this crew to go east.
It will be the greatest trip a Varsity
team has ever undertaken and the 1912
crew will not be far from the finish
when the winning shell crosses the
line.
