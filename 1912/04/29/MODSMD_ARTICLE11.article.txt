# Coover.
## 
### 
Through an unfortunate accident the
name of John Edgar Coover, an assist
ant in the Psychology department, was

given publicity in the San
Francisco papers in connec
tion with a story of an at

tempted suicide at Stanford.
The Daily Palo Alto takes this op
portunity to rectify a blunder which
has caused Mr. Coover much undesir
able notoriety. Mr. Coover is one of
the few men who can justly repeat
Mark Twain's famous utterance "The
reports of my death are greatly ex
aggerated."
