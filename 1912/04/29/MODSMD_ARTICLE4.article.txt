# ERROR IN NAMES CAUSES UNFORTUNATE MISTAKE.
## 
### 
John Edgar Coover, an assistant in
the department of psychology, has
been made the victim of freak circum
stances in being connected with the
attempted suicide which occured at
Roble bridge last Wednesday evening.
Coover, who was visiting on Menlo
Heights with Professor Lewis Terman
of the Department of Education, when
the call for aid came, was one of the
first men to reach the wounded man,
who had cut his radial artery with a
razor.
There were several men gathered at
the bridge, presumably from the Stock
Farm, who on hearing both Professor
German's and Coover's names, wrong
ly applied them to the wounded man.
"There was one man in particular,"
said Professor Terman, "who insisted
on calling the unfortunate man Coover.
in spite of all our corrections. It is,
therefore, not strange, under these
nueer circumstances, that the name of
Mr. Coover was wrongfully connected
with the reports of the attempted
suicide which have been circulating
about the campus since Thursdav.
