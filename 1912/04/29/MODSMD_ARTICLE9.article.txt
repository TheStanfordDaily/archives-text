# LANTERN SLIDES WILL ILLUSTRATE LECTURE
## E.A. Powell to Talk on "Countries of Unrest," in Assembly Hall Tuesday. 
### 
A unique collection of lantern pic
tures will be used by E. Alexander
Powell to illustrate his lecture "Coun
tries of Unrest" tomorrow night in the
Assembly Hall. During his six years'
experience in Africa the traveller was
afforded an opportunity of collecting
many valuable and interesting slides
which he will use in making his dis
course more vivid.
Those who have read Mr. Powell's
contributions to different periodicals
know of his clear cut, narrative enter
taining style and journalistic intellec
tual manner. These qualities prevail
in his lectures and make them a
pleasure to listen to.
The speaker has been an extensive
traveller as a correspondent for Eng
lish newspapers. He has also served
as American vice-consul at Beirut,
Syria, and as American consular agent
at Alexandria, Egypt. With his broad
knowledge of the outside world he
comes prepared to give a Stanford au
dience a lecture of unusual merit.
The address will begin at eight
o'clock.
