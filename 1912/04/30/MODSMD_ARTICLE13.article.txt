# The 						Rally.
## 
### 
Stanford wants to send the victori
ous 1912 crew to the Poughkeepsie
regatta. The trip east will take money

and it will require care
ful financing to secure
the necessary amount.

But the two thousand dollars spent in
this manner will be more than repaid
by the advertisement Stanford will re
ceive in the East and, best of all, by
the chance it will give the self-trained
Cardinal oarsmen to pit themselves
against the carefully coached crews
of the East.
If your heart is with Stanford attend
the big rally and send-off to the crew
tomorrow night and hear the plans for
the trip to the Hudson. Every man in
the University can help to send the
crew East; why not do your share.
