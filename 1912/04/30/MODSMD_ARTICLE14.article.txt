# WORKS OF MRS. STARKS ON DISPLAY THIS WEEK.
## Pictures of Quadrangle and Palo Alto Oaks Are in Collection at Old Studio. 
### 
Sixty-two water color paintings by
Mrs. Chloe Lesley Starks are on ex
hibition this week in the Old Studio
building. The pictures were first dis
played last Saturday and will be kept
in the building every day of the pres
ent week. The studio is open to the
public from 2 to 5 p.m.
Stanford lovers of art show their
appreciation of the works of Mrs.
Starks by attending in large numbers.
A similar exhibition was given by the
same artist a year ago and some of the
pictures on display now were seen here
then. Most of them, however, are new.
Work done on Puget Sound, Carmel,
Monterey, Palo Alto, Stanford Univer
sity and other noted beauty spots, are
included in the collection and every
one receives the unstinted praise of
all who have seen them. A number of
the works are exceptionally well done
and are worth a visit to the building.
