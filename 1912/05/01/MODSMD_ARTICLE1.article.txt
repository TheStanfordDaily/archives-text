# JUNIOR ANNUAL MEETS APPROVAL OF CRITICS
## QUAD REVIEW RANKS VOLUME NINETEEN HIGHLY. Heavy Sale of Junior Year Book Testifies to Its Popularity With Students. 
### 
The contribution of the Class of
1913 to the archives of Stanford was
delivered on the campus today.
Editor H. L. Loud, Manager S. VV.
Guthrie, and the members of the 1913
Quad staff are to be congratulated on
many features of the year-book.
In the first place, the engravings
and half-tones in the book are the best
that ever have appeared in a Stanford
annual. The groups and individual
cuts throughout are remarkably clean
and sharp.
Typographically, the book compares
favorably with previous issues. The
pages show very few typographical
errors, a feature that evidences care
ful reading of the proof.
Follows Old Lines.
The only innovation in the annual is
the appearance of the sorority pic
tures. Editor Loud has followed the
same general lines in the nineteenth
volume of the annual as in previous
issues, that the University chronicle
may perpetuate the idea of its
founders.
The volume is dedicated to "Dad"
Moulton, Stanford's veteran trainer.
President Jordan designates the pres
ent as the Golden Age of Stanford and
marks Student Control as the crystal
lization of this age.
The subject matter of the book is
a comprehensive review of the univer
sity year, as far as the limited space
of 480 pages permits. It has been a
matter of regret, that the limitations of
the Quad allow only too brief a resume
of the year's activities.
The originality of the art work and
the liberal sprinkling of pictures that
describe Stanford life as it is, beyond
the ability of words, are attractive
features of the book.
The reviews of the year in dra
matics, athletics and other lines, are
effective and accurate. Here again,
the editor has taken advantage of the
opportunity to enliven with good pic
tures. In an appendix are entered all
the athlete records since the founding
of the University.
The Josh section presents nothing
extraordinary. The hammer has land
ed effectively occasionally, but in too
few places.
The book met with a heavy sale to
day. More than 600 copies were pur
chased on the Quad.
There are only a few remaining
conies of the Quad and these will be
on sale at the Law steps tomorrow.
