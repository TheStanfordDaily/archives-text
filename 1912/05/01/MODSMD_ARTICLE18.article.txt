## Stanford Man Receives Reward For Remarkable Recordâ€”Will Take Psychology. 
### 
F. F. Wolff, '11, has been awarded
the Harvard Scholarship for the
coming college year. In giving the
scholarship to Wolff, the San Fran
cisco Harvard Club has now awarded
it twice in succession to a Stanford
student, contrary to the custom of al
ternating its presentation to Califor
nia and Stanford men.
The California representative to the
Harvard Club nominated a man from
his university, but upon learning of
Wolff's remarkable record, withdrew
his candidate.
Wolff, who graduated last May in
Mathematics, is at present an assistant
in the Department of Psychology and
will continue his work along that line.
F. P. Anderson, '11, was the last ap
pointee of the society. He is at
present taking graduate work in Ro
manic Languages.
The Harvard Scholarship is given to
either a Stanford or California man for
his work in graduate study, preferably
not professional. The scholarship
amounts to $. r >oo and lasts for one year.
