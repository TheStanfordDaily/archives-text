# NOTED TRAVELER GIVES INTERESTING LECTURE
## E. A. POWELL DESCRIBES THE "COUNTRIES OF UNREST." Intimate View of Turkish Revolution and African Development Interests Audience. 
### 
E. Alexander Powell, the widely i
known traveler and newspaper writer,
gave a very graphic and interesting
lecture on the "Countries nf Unrest"
to an interested audience in the As
sembly Hall last night. Powell illus
trated his talk by stereopticon views,
the pictures having been taken on his
recent trips in eastern Europe and on
the African Continent. The lecturer
has the happy faculty of telling of his
experiences as a story and yet making
every incident of great interest to the
audience. The personal element in the
pictures shown lent an added interest,
as the slides were clearly an invalu
able product of the lecturer's travels.
Dealing first with the recent revolu
tion in Turkey, Mr. Powell described at
length conditions in that little known
capital, Constantinople. Staying in
that city during the most exciting
times which followed the deposition of
the Sultan, and being so favored by
the officials of the new regime that
he was able to watch the events at
close range, he brought away with him
a story of that startling revolution and
an intimate knowledge of events that
has proved entertaining and instruc
tive to thousands.
Describes Dark Africa.
The greater portion of Powell's time
was spent in Africa, and most of the
lecture last night was devoted to a
description of the dark continent. The
journalist's knowledge of that vast
land, from the civilized country of the
Nile, and the great deserts of the
Soudan, to the British provinces of
the South is as complete and as inti
mate as repeated trips and careful
study make possible. The audience
was taken on a complete circuit of the
continent, the differing governmental
policies being explained as the prov
inces held by European countries were
reached. Powell's position as a writer
of note, and as a United States Con
sul, obtained for him many unusual
privileges, much to his own benefit and
that of others.
