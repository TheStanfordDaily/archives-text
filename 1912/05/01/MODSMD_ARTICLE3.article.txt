# MANY CHARACTER PARTS IN "FANNIE'S RELATIONS"
## "TYPES" OF VARIOUS KINDS TO APPEAR ON STAGE. Tickets For Annual Senior Play Will Go on Sale at Usual Places May 6. 
### 
Character parts predominate in
"Fantiie's Relations," the play which
the Senior Class is to present on May
153. The various members of the Ben
nett family present an unusual variety
of types. Chorus ladies vie with
maiden aunts for supremacy, with
amuting results. The male character
izations are equally good, and likewise
funny.
According to Coach Mathieu, tht
cast is one of the best he has had to
coach in his long experience at Stan
ford. The players are all well cast
and the rehearsals promise one of the
best performances ever given on the
local stage.
The "chorus ladies" in the farce
challenge the leading exponents in
this branch of the dramatic art for
the high places they occupy. The cast
of "Fannie's Relations" has in it all of
Fantiie's old friends of the London
music hall stages. For the first time
in Assembly Hall the audience will
see a realistic reproduction of London
music hall beauties. Their costumes
will be appropriate. Coach Mathieu
has coached the actresses in the stage
slang and breezy freshness necessary
for the parts.
Excellent posters of scenes from the
play were placed on exhibition on the
Quad this morning. The groups and
individual pictures are well posed and
are the best photographs of this nature
which have appeared.
Tickets for the production will go
on sale at the Bookstore and at Wein
gartner's on the morning of Monday.
May 6, at 8 o'clock.
