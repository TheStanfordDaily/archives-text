Sacrificing his own time in order to
give the members of the Stanford class
in news writing the benefits of his
experience gained through many years
of service on metropolitan papers,
Lynn C. Simpson, News Editor of the
Chronicle, journeyed to the campus
this afternoon and spoke to an in
terested gathering 011 the subject of
newspaper work. Simpson has charge
of the make-up of his paper and so was
compelled to forego his daily off-duty
period in order to speak to the
students.
The speaker recited many instances
of the tasks placed before the men in
the reportorial department of a large
daily paper and gave the embryo jurn
alists a good account of the inside
workings of the profession.
He urged the newcomer in the field
of newspaperdom to begin work in the
small town rather than in the large
city. He pointed out the many oppor
tunities for success in the rising towns
of California and the northwest, and
strongly advised against beginning in
the city where the chance of rise was
practically limited to three high posi
tions, namely, Managing Editor, News
Editor, and City Editor.
