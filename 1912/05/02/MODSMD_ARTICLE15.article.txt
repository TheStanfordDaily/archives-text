# CALIFORNIA TRACK TEAM BARRED FROM GREAT MEET.
## 
### 
California will not be allowed to
enter its track team in the American
intercollegiate conference to be held
at Philadelphia this spring. Graduate
Manager Farmer received a telegram
yesterday from the executive com
mittee which has charge of the meet,
stating that California's petition to
enter a team had been denied. No
reason was given.
Quite a little money has already
been collected to send the team east,
and this will now be used to send the
team to the Western Conference to be
held at Purdue University the first of
.Tune. Trainer Christie and nine men
will make the trip.
