# RALLY GIVES ROUSING START IN "ON TO POUGHKEEPSIE" CAMPAIGN
## Speakers Voice Conviction of Worth of Victorious Hundred Dollars Already Subscribed. 
### 
"The Cardinal crew as it rowed on
the Estuary on April 13th is as good
an eight as there is afloat today. I
am certain that in the Poughkeepsie
regatta the Cardinal would finish with
the first three." Thus did Pat O'Day,
veteran oarsman and world's record
athlete, voice his conviction, at last
night's rally, that the Stanford crew
would uphold the honor of the Car
dinal in the regatta on the Hudson.
"I watched the races on the Oakland
Estuary, I saw the form and strokes
of Washington, California and Stan
ford before the races, and I would
plstce my bottom dollar on your eight
against the pick of the East. For four
years I held a seat in the Wisconsin
shell at the Poughkeepsie regatta, and
I know that the Dan Murphy stroke as
perfected here, does not differ greatly
from that of Cornell and Columbia, the
best crews of the East.
"If you will imagine the broad shin
ing stretches of the Hudson on a sum
mer day, with the shells of six univer
sities glancing through the water.
Along the bank, gaily bedecked flat
cters With thousands of enthuslAstlc
supporters waving their encourage
ment are a color-splotched back
ground. There are the red and white
streamers of Cornell, the blue and
white of Columbia, the blue and red of
'Pennsie,' and the Cardinal of Wiscon
sin. And this year, above them all,
will be the cardinal of Stanford."
(Jo East to Learn.
K. L. Schaupp, former Varsity oars
man, spoke on the advantages of row
ing with the veteran crews of the
east, trained by professional coaches
that have no peers in America."The
stroke as taught by the veteran Stan
ford coach, Dan Murphy, has been
slightly changed in the three years of
student coaching, and as only one
member of the crew for 1913 was

trained under Murphy, it i6 impossible
to expect that there will be no further
change. The Stanford crew would go
east to learn, as well as to prove that
the West is able to compete on an
equal basis with the best product of
the East."
"The performance on April 13th last
indicates that we get a dollar's worth
of result from a dollar's worth of
work," said "Husky" Ghierena, cox
swain of three victorius Varsity crews.
"The best answer to criticisms of our
stroke is the position of the three
shells at the end of that race."
Crew captain R. H. Seward thanked
the members of the crew squad and the
coaching committee for their untiring
work during the spring training sea
son, and voiced the determination of
the crew men to prove worthy of
the support of the Student Body in the
eastern regatta. "We would be the
happiest, most grateful and apprecia
tive lot of fellows that ever left Stan
ford to represent thefr Alma Mater."
Splendid Donations Made.
As concrete evidence that the Stu
dent Body is behind the movement, the
E-.ecutive Committee last night voted
five hundred dollars toward defraying
the expenses of the eastern trip. Thi>>
sum, with a munificent gift of one hun
dred dollars from Charles G. Lathrop,
Treasurer of the University, practic
ally insures the successful financing
of the plan. Other sums have been
promised by friends and supporters of
the University, and will go to swell the
grand total.
Chairman S. C. Kennedy of the
Collecting Committee has asked that
contributions be given at once to any
member of the committee, as it is
onlv bv rushing matters a little that
the plans may be carried out. The
results of the first twenty-four hours
of work will be published tomorrow
