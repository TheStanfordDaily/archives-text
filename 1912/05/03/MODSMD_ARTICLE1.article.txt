## STUDENT BODY CONTRIBUTES $346.55 OF TOTAL. Sums Handed in by Solicitors Represent Only Partial Returns From Organizations. 
### 
The first preliminary report of the
crew fund collectors at noon today
showed a total of $346.55 in hand from
student body collectors. Adding to this
the $500.00 offered by the Executive
Committee and the $100.00 personal
contribution of Mr. Charles G. Lath
rop, the grand total to date is $946.55.
As only about half of the student
collectors were on hand with reports,
the total for today gives only a vague
indication of what the final report will
be. Many of the collectors who turned
in amounts today report that their
lists are incomplete and that they will
be able to add considerable money to
their reports at the next canvass.
Following are the contributions re
ported up to noon today:
The Executive Committee, $500.
Mr. Charles G. Lathrop, $100.

Thanks to Mr. Lathrop.
The committee is fully appreciative
of the voluntary contribution of Mr.
Lathrop and the work of the collectors
in the thankless task of soliciting
funds for the trip of the crew.
The $346.55 reported for the student
body today does not include pledges,
only the money actually in the hands
of the collectors. The next report un
doubtedly will greatly amplify the
sums reported by the collectors today,
to ?ay nothing of those who as yet.
have made no report.
The Skull and Snakes committee in
charge of the campaign is well pleased
with the first report of the committee
and is confident that the entire student
body will be represented in the final
accounting of the fund to send the Var
sity to Poughkeepsie.
Students Must Raise $7">o.
As $750 is the absolute minimum re
quired from the student body, the hard
work of the campaign is still to be
done. With $348.55 collected, $403.45
additional will be required before the
committee will be able to talk business
with the officials in the East.
It is absolutely necessary that the
student contributions run over $750 in
order that any substantial support may
be obtained from the alumni and the
entering of the crew in the greatest
regatta of the year insured.
The committee has decided to give
the collectors three or four more days
in which to solicit subscriptions and
money, in order that every member of
the student body may be reached, ft
was first determined to close the cam
pa i"m tomorrow.
Next Monday, all of the collectors
are requested by the committee to turn
in as complete reports as possible to
the men designated to head their divi
sion, in order that the progress of the
collecting may be definitely deter
mined.
Sophomores Boost.
The Sophomore class today initiated
a movement to boost the crew fund
that undoubtedly will be followed by
many other classes and organizations.
All of the receipts of the Sophomore
concession in the Senior carnival
above the expenses will be turned over
to the crew fund. The Senior women,
who have the "Eats" concession at the
Kappa Alpha Theta house, have got
Into line with the boosters and will
add the net receipts from their labor
to the fund.
As both the Sophomores and Senior
women have given their time and
efforts to make their concessions a
success for the crew, they are confi
dent that the student body will not
be chary in rl eir patronage, as pat
ronage means the swelling of the crew
fund and the boosting of Stanford in
the East.
Final Ball Game to Benefit.
The final baseball game of the inter
fraternity series will be a benefit per
formance for the crew. An admis&ion
of 10 cents will be charged, and the
proceeds will be turned over entire tn
the campaign committee.
Every effort is being made by the
committee to swell the fund. Although
the first reports are gratifying, the
committee hopes that the members of
the student body will continue to help
them in the difficult task of providing
the expense money to match the Car
dinal eight in the highest class evpn!
of the athletic year.
