Stanford has a musical organization
that labels itself the Stanford band.
God save the mark. To couple the

name of Stanford with any
group of students gives the
impression that those stu
dents have a sense of grati-

tude to the University for the advan
tages they are receiving here and a
loyalty and affection for their Alma
Mater which would lead at least to a
little self-sacrifice.
Yesterday the chairman of the
Senior Prom Committee requested the
members of the band to remain two
days after the last examination in
order to furnish music for the Prom
and Carnival. The bandsmen saw fit
to state they would consider this pro
posal if they were paid one hundred
and fifty dollars. In excuse for their
stand they made several allegations
which need clearing up right now.
One worthy argued that Senior week
was essentially a matter affecting the
Senior class, that the other three
classes were in no wise interested. To
persons of this ilk it may be interest
ing to know that Stanford is one of the
few large universities of the country
without a fitting Commencement sea
son. Seeing this lamentable lack
several members of the faculty sug
gested to the class of 1911 that one of
the finest things that class could do
for Stanford would be to inaugurate
a movement to popularize Senior week.
The class of 1912 has determined to
follow this lead and do what it can to
firmly establish a custom which brings
back its thousands annually to the
great eastern universities.
Senior week vitally affects the whole
University. It. is not a question of the
worth and value of the season now,
it is a question of what it can be
made.
If the refusal were based on the
grounds of necessity, no reasonable
person could object. Tt it were a case
of forty men having jobs to fill imme
diately on the conclusion of the final
examinations, there would be some ex
cuse; but the case appears to be
different.
These men are in a great hurry to
leave, but they will condescend to re
main for one hundred and fifty dollars.
Tn other words, they will give up their
lucrative positions for four dollars
cash in hand. This is a cheap prict
they set on their Stanford "Spirit,"
but it is an estimate they place them
selves and so cannot be doubted.
A large minority of the bandsmen
are willing to do what they can in

furtherance of a University cause of
this nature and it is too bail that they
must be tarred by the same stick that
touches their petty fellow musicians.
