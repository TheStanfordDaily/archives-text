The new Stanford Varsity shell will
be awaiting the sturdy Cardinal eight |
when they arrive at Poughkeepsie to i
begin training to enter the struggle
for the rowing supremacy of the Uni
ted States on the Hudson.
A telegram has been received from
Sims, the Putney boat builder, that the
new shell will be delivered at Pougn
keepsie on June 14, ready for the
water. This means that the Varsity
will not be handicapped by rowing in i
a borrowed boat on June 29, when the
great regatta is on.
If the present plans materialize, the
ten men representing the Cardinal will !
leave the campus about June 8. After
stopping for a day in Chicago or other i
Middle West city for a rest from the i
fatigue of travel, they will go direct j
to Poughkeepsie, arriving about June j
14.
Two weeks and two days of strenu- J
ous training before the regatta then j
will lie the portion of the Stanford j
oarsmen.

Owing to a fortunate circumstance, I
the Stanford men will not enter the ;
Hudson with the necessity of studying!
tho currents and tides. The father of
a Palo Alto student, for many years ;
an expert pilot on the Hudson, has ar- j
ranged for Captain R. H. Seward to
meet another pilot of his acquaint
ance at Poughkeepsie, who has prom
ised to do all in his power to assist i
the Cardinal boatmen in becoming i
familiar with tho channel and cross
currents 1 .
