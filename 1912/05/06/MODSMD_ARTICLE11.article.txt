# Quadrangle Club Swells Crew Fund.
## 
### 
Fifty dollars was added to the crew
fund last, night, when the Quadrangle
Club voted that sum to swell the total
in the "On to Poughkeepsie" cam
paign. This is the third donation to
projects of the Student body made by
honor society in the last few months.
Fifty dollars was given toward the
purchase of the crew coaching launch,
nssisting very materially in acquiring
that addition to the crew equipment.
Large sums have been voted at other
times when funds wore badly needed,
the total amounting to something over
two hundred dollars.
