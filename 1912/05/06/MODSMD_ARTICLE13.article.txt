# They Do Protest Too Much.

The Stanford Band claims an in
justice was done them in an editorial
on Friday night. Perhaps from your

peculiar viewpoint,
gentlemen, an in
justice was com
mitted —an injus-

tice, forsooth, that consisted merely
in an honest recital of the facts of the
case and a more or less successful at
tempt to make you realize in just what
light your actions are viewed by trie
majority of the students of the Univer
sity. If it is an injustice to make you
see yourselves as you really are, then
we stand convicted of a heinous
offence.
We are entirely out of sympathy with
these men in the attitude they assume
towards the University. In the com
munication appearing tonight the real
crux of the situation is wholly ignored.
Senior Week is an affair of the whole
University, and yet the Band seemingly
does not appreciate this evident fact
The tenor of the entire communica
tion is expressed in the following sen
tence, "They ask what would amount
to seventy cents from each Senior —
yet that rate is pushing the zeal of the
Senior class (as the writer of the edi
torial would have us believe) in its
effort to do a great good to the Uni
versity."
This is just the position to which
we object. The Band assumes that it,
as a Student Body organization re
ceiving large sums of money for its
upkeep, owes no duty towards the
furtherance of the Senior Week move
ment. What right have the bandsmen
to demand that the Senior class pay
them for fulfilling a duty owed to the
University.
We would answer in detail the points
presented by the musicians if it were
not a waste of good white paper, but
we would like to ask one question;.why
is the fact that the Student Body has
appropriated a thousand dollars to the
Band in the past year "palpably beside
the question"?
The facts upon which the editorial
in Friday's issue was based were ob
tained from a man of known integrity,
J. F. Partridge.
