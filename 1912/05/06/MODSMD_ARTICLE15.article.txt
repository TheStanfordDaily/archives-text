Editor Daily Palo Alto:
A few facts are necessary to make
clear the action of the Band on the
Senior Week proposition.
There is a necessity for the members
leaving when they are through exam
inations. Only three of the thirty-six
do not work during vacation. Twenty
two have jobs to go to as soon as they
are through. These jobs pay from $10
to $40 per week. Fourteen of the
members complete their work by Tues
day of examination week, six the pre
ceding Saturday. Those through by
Tuesday would lose the balance of the
week, meaning added expense here and
loss of a half week's pay. They ask
four dollars not as an inducement to
give up jobs, but to help remunerate
them for personal loss incurred by
staying.
They ask what would amount to
seventy cents from each senior—yet
that rate is pushing the zeal of the
Senior class too far (as the writer of
the editorial won Id have us believe) in
its effort to do great good to the Uni
versity. One hundred and fifty dollars
was paid by the class of 1911 last year.
Little or no objection was met with.
The Senior class was unwise in the
choice of a man for a responsible posi
tion, and as a result, the class has a
large debt. That debt was mentioned
by the Chairman of the Committee
when he appeared before the Band, in
an effort to have the Band stay over
for the Prom without compensation.
He did not consider that the Band was
"trying to slip anything over on the
Senior class," to use his words. He
hoped to cut down expenses,—econ
omy was the motive. A vote was taken
at the time to ascertain how many men
could afford to stay over without pay.
Eight responded. Had the writer of
the editorial been present, he would
have been more conversant with the
facts of the situation.
This Band takes enough pride in the
rendition of its programs not to
attempt such unless they can be cred
itably performed with the proper in
strumentation. Obviously, from the
facts shown in the statements above,
this would be impossible. The price
of one hundred and fifty dollars was
made at least a month ago, yet the
Committee seemed little concerned
over it until the past week or ten days.
There have been several contentions
pretty generally offered the Band as
reasons for its staying. They are:
1. The Band is getting an hour's
credit: (2) the Student Body has ap
propriated a thousand dollars in the
past year; (3) the Band gets free ad
mission to athletic contests. These
three arguments are so palpably be
side the question to any one who stops
to consider them that no answer will
be made.
