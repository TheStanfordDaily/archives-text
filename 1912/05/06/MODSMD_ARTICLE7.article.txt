# COMMENCEMENT ISSUE OF CHAPPIE ON SALE
## FINAL NUMBER GUARANTEED TO DISPEL DESPAIR. Clever Art and Literary Material Makes This Best Senior Number For Years. 
### 
Closing the thirteenth volume of the
Chaparral, Editor Summerfield will
place upon the campus his last num
ber tomorrow morning. The best
efforts of the staff have been centered
on this final issue of the year and a
publication is expected that will drive
the pro-examination glooms from the
campus in an ignominious rout. The
artistic productions of this issue
should satisfy the most fastidious
tastes. The literary work is easily
the best that has appeared in a com
mencement number for many years.
"Breakers Ahead" is the title of the
first full page cartoon, one of a number
of drawings by G. C. Smith, '10. Miss
M. Ilailey, '14, has sent in a very clever
hunch drawing that should provoke
considerable amusement. The space
of another page is devoted to a pen
and ink picture drawn by W. R.
Davenport, '04. M. W. Allen, '15, has
contributed a series of sketches en
titled "A Tragedy in Suits." A. L.
King, '12, has produced the usual an
nual cartoon depicting the present
wielder of "Chappie's" hammer and
the newly elected editor in the pro
cess of transferring the editorship.
Other art is the work of .T. L. Duff, '13,
E. E. Manning, '13, and J. Olsen, '15.
The initial page poem, entitled
"Commencement," has been written
by N. C. Wilson, '12. This is an ex
ceptional piece of verse and will un
doubtedly prove to be the strongest
poetic production that has appeared
in a Stanford magazine this year. The
Dillntante, by M. T. Dooling, '11. con
tains the unusual feature of an actual
proposal.
This number is particularly strong
in short .iokes, snappy verse, and epi
grammatic paragraphs. Tlu> contrib
utors to this denartment are E. W.
Pugh. '11. TT. 11. Beall, '11. M. T. Doo

*12, Y. C. Wilson, '12, M. A. TTagen,

Thp concluding "Now Thats" deal

j editor.
