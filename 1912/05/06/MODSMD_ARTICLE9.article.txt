# STANFORD BAND GIVES LAST CONCERT AT LAKE
## MUSICAL ORGANIZATION ENDS THE YEAR'S WORK. Interesting Program of Classical and Popular Selection Marks Final Appearance. 
### 
The Stanford Band, in yesterday's
concert at Lagunita, finished up a sea
son of musical effort whose success
has never been surpassed in the his
tory of the University musical organi
zations. Under the able tutelage of
Professor E. W. Martin, the musicians
have attained a high degree of excel
lence.
Most noteworthy is the change in
the character of the selections; the
appearance on the concert programs
of such names as Svorak, Rossini, and
Tschaikowsky, is a welcome relief
from the usual order of Cohan and
Irving Bertin.
The concert of yesterday afternoon
was well presented, and although a
disagreeable wind was blowing across
the lake, the interest of the large
crowd was held to the final hymns, in
memory of the Titanic.'s bandsmen.
The difficult overture from "William
Tell" was rendered with remarkable
precision, considering the extremely
short time which had been devoted to
its rehearsal. The familiar "Tlumor
esque" of Svorak was received with
great applause. G. P. Ross, '14, added
an interesting number in his cornet
solo, given with his customary excel
lence of technique.
