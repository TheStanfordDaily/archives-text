The week of final examinations is
at best a hard pill to swallow for the
average undergraduate, and vacation

ahead is the only sugges
tion of sugar about the
dose. The novelty of the
final ex. sensation adds

bitterness to the potion of the Fresh
man, and it is by the Class of 1915
that Senior Week, which sugar-coats
and kills the taste of the final days of
work, should be most enthusiastically
welcomed.
Senior Week as an institution is
not new to the University, but to the
Freshman its pleasures are an un
known quantity. The word of upper
classmen is usually taken as to the
amount of fun which may be gotten
out of the week's events. The pleas
ures here are then balanced against
the pleasures or advantages derived
from leaving immediately after the
last examination. Heretofore the
scale has been prone to turn against
Stanford. This year, the feeling of
a duty owed the University and the
graduating class should turn the
balance. The feeling was doubtless
there in past years, but it has remain
ed for the present Senior Class to
bring it out in the Class of Fifteen.
The best tribute to their missionizing
work will be the proportion of Fresh
men who stay to swell the number of
merry-makers, and to bid 1912 God's
Speed at the end of their college life.
Doubtful ones, try the sugar coat
ing once, and the graduating class in
1915 will not stand alone on Com
mencement Day.
