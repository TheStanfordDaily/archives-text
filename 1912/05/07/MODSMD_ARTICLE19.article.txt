# ALUMNI ARE DONORS OF GRADUATE FELLOWSHIP
## ESTABLISHED BY JOINT ACTION OF FORMER STUDENTS. Recipient of Honor to be Selected by Facility Committee For the Year 1912-13. 
### 
The Advisory Board of the Alumni
Association at a meeting last Thurs
day, took action of an interesting and
important nature, when, through con
tributions made by the members of
the Board, a graduate fellowship was
provided for the year 1012-13. Those
who constitute the advisory com
mittee are Professor D. Searles, presi
dent, Mrs. E. W. Allan, '90, M. A.
Thomas, '04, Dr. T. M. Williams, '97,
R. W. Barrett, '04, W. W. Guth, '95,
B. P. Bledsoe, '90, N. Cleveland, '99,
G. Ditz, '11, J. E. McDowell, '00, Miss
Mary I. Lockey, '02, and H. C. Jones,
'02. The Board voted to transfer the
amount given for the fellowship to the
Faculty Committee on Graduate Study.
The recipient of the fellowship will
be selected by that committee.
This generous action by the Ad
visory Board of the Alumni is un
doubtedly intended to answer, in part,
flie many letters from alumni asking
for information as to what they can
do in a modest way to aid in the de
velopment of Stanford University. A
fellowship of from $300 to $[500 is fre
quently a gift possible from a small
group of alumni. Whether it is given
to graduates or to undergraduates, it
is a very valuable aid to the Univer
sity, since it permits some student of
distinct worth to complete a course
he might otherwise be forced to drop.
There have been a few such fellow
ships established before this, from
time to time, by generous private gift,
but the one now provided for is the
first to bo established through joirii
action by the alumni. It is proof of
interest, and points a way of helping
in the development of Stanford.
This follows the plan that has been
advocated to found fellowships for
students who are going to pursue
graduate work.
