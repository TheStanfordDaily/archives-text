# LIBRARY SUFFERS LOSS IN TITANIC DISASTER.
## British Sessional Papers Valued at $750 Go Down With the Vessel. 
### 
As an echo of the appalling "Titanic"
disaster, the Library has just received
word that its annual shipment of the
British Sessional papers has gone
down with that vessel. The invoiced
value of the lost consignment was
$750.00.
The Stanford Library has one of the
few nearly complete collections in this
country of the British Parliamentary
papers, including about .".000 volumes.
It larks, however, the papers since
ISSO, and each year the Library re
ceives from its London agent a large
shipment to fill up this gap. Some of
these papers are scarce and the process
of obtaining the missing volumes is
tedious and expensive.
The records that were lost can be
replaced, but it will take some time
to collect all the data. The papers
were insured.
