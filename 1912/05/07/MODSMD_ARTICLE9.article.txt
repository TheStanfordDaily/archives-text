# CARNIVAL WILL OPEN FESTIVITIES OF WEEK
## "PEERADES" TO BE FEATURE OF DAY'S CELEBRATION. Class, Department and Fraternity Concessions Will Furnish Mirth and Add to Revelry. 
### 
Opening with a "peerade" that is
certain to eclipse all previous efforts
in its riot ol' color and its galaxy of
"littering specialities, and closing in
one long burst of Japanese-lanterned
glory, Thursday, May 16, is destined
to be marked on the Stanford calendar
in red ink as the banner carnival day
of Senior Week history. No more
joyous or fitting Introduction to the
delights of Senior Week could be de
v ed, and the events of the day are to
set such a standard for genuine fun
as may only be equalled by those of
the following days of Commencement
Week.
Ten o'clock on the morning of Un
derclassmen's Day will find a strange
assortment of unclassified wonders on
the lawn of the D. K. E. house. The
grand parade is to start at that end of
the row, and within half an hour the
procession will begin its triumphal
tour of the campus. All of the de
partments are to be represented, and
in order that they may hold pace with
the exhibits of the fraternities and
clubs, the representatives of the de
partments will meet at the D. K. E.
house tomorrow afternoon at 2:30 to
perfect tTieir plans.
Everyone is to be masked and in
costume, and it is expected that every
house and concession-holding group
have a number of representatives in
the line. Co-operation will make this,
the Peerade of peerades, the banner
event of the day.
Vaudeville and Dances.
For the carnival of Thursday even
ing, the row is to be lighted by hun
dreds of Japanese lanterns, strung in
the trees and on the porches of the
houses. The Seniors will be there in
force with unlimited quantities of con
fetti and carnival dusters, while street
booths will dispense the ever welcome
"hot-dog." Music from the nickel
dances will vie with the strumming
' from the side shows, in adding the
last touch of carnival spirit to the
throng.
The Kappa Sigma house wi' Â«
formed into a vaudeville then
the first class, with the Sophomc i
the artists, stage hands, and sic
spielers. "Plantation Minstrels" will
be the caption on the dodgers.
A nickel dance, with nil the attrac
tive appurtenances thereto, will crowd
the floors of the Kappa Kappa Gamma
house. The class of 1013 have se
cured this concession and their
"barker" will guarantee that the three
minute dance, costing a nickel, is
worth a dollar.
Aesthetic dancing is not to be for
gotten, and at the Alpha Phi house a
dancing club will hold the boards in
some of the latest phases of the ter
psichorean art.
V Campus Cafeteria.
The hungry will be fed and the
weary will be resuscitated at the Kap-
pa Alpha Theta house, where the mem
bers of several sororities will don the
garl) of waitresses and provide eats
that would do credit to graduates of
a domestic science school.
Other concessions have been secured
by the Phi Delta Theta, Delta Upsilon,
and Phi Kappa Psi fraternities, and
by the Mining Engineers. "Fakes" are
to have no part in this year's carnival,
and all of the entertainments will be
worth more than the admission fee.
