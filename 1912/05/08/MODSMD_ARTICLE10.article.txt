Tonight we close the forms on the
last regular edition of the Daily Palo
Alto. The present editor has been a

member of the staff for four
years and it one of his keenest
regrets in leaving Stanford

that he must sever connections with
the paper and with the men who make
possible its publication. It would be
useless to attempt to thank the under
classmen and upperclassmen for the
hours they have spent and the energy
they have so freely given to make pos
sible the publication of the daily paper.
Only these men know the time they
devote to their work and they are seek
ing neither public recognition nor
words of praise for their efforts. The
knowledge of good work well done Is
their sole sufficient reward.
Irving I. Ingraham, of Bristol, Con
necticut, will assume the position of
editor with the opening of college in

fall. The incoming editor has been an
able assistant and the"Daily" will
have a successful semester under his
guidance.
