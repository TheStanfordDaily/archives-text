# EVERYBODY INVITED TO THE ALUMNI RECEPTION.
## Affair Will Begin at Nine O'clock, Giving Opportunity to Attend the Vaudeville. 
### 
For the first time in Stanford his
tory, the Senior-Alumni reception this
year will be open to the entire Univer
sity public. Previously only graduates
and members of the Senior class have
been invited.
Saturday evening, May 18, is the date
for this reception. It is to begin at
nine o'clock and will last until the
witching hour. This arrangement will
make it possible for those who attend
Ihe first vaudeville entertainment given
by the Senior Class in Palo Alto to
return in time for the reception.
The Senior-Alumni reception will be
entirely informal. Dancing will as
usual be indulged, and the affair will
serve to commence and renew ac
quaintances between undergraduates,
near-graduates and graduates.
