# INNER QUAD WILL BE TRANSFORMED FOR PROM
## SCENE IS TO RESEMBLE A BIT OF TROPICAL HAWAII. Musicians From the islands in Palm Leaf Bower Will Add Music to Mirth. 
### 
Hawaiian musicians will be the fea
ture of this year's Senior Promenade,
if the plans of the Prom Committee
can be carried out. In the past the
music for these affairs has been fur
nished by the University Band, but this
organization will be unable to appear
and the islanders will play instead.
The Hawaiian orchestra now in the
state is one of the best which has ever
left the islands and is in great demann
all along the coast. It will be a dis
tinct innovation, as this will be the
first Prom at which this kind of an
orchestra has appeared.
The Inner Quad on May 17 will be
a veritable fairyland. Shaded electric
lights will cast a soft glow over the
bamboo and palm bedecked booths
and corridors. The music will be sta
tioned in the center in a tropical bower
representing a bit of Hawaii.
The booths at each corner of the
inclosed space will be arranged similar
to last year. Light refreshments will
be served in each one by groups of
women from the various women's or
ganizations. Coffee and sandwiches
will be found in one corner, ice-cream
in another, punch in a third, ices in
another and other dainties in the rest.
The following organizations are
among those which will participate:
Roble Club, Delta Gamma, Kappa
Kappa Gamma, Pi Beta Phi, Kappa
Alpha Theta, Gamma Phi Beta, Ma
drona Hall, Delta Delta Delta, Alpha
Omicron Pi, and Alpha Phi.
President and Mrs. Jordan will be
the honored guests of the Class of 1912
on this occasion. All members of the
University community are asked to
attend, and enjoy this unique affair.
Programs similar to dance cards will
b distributed so that promenades may
be traded.
The committee is endeavoring to
carry out the ideas of the originators
of the Prom in making this an even
ing of enjoyment for everyone. No
where else can an out-of-doors Prom
of this nature be held. Stanford pre
sents unusual features which lend
themselves admirably to the holding of
this event. The committee, of which
J. F. Partridge is chairman, includes
the following Seniors, Misses K. Gra
ham, G. Childs, N. Allen, S. Lowman,
G. Burke, and J. H. Paine, R. E. Mill
sap, H. L. Hubbard, C. C. Argabrite,
J. W. Henderson, B. L. Hostettler, R.
H. Emerson, C. H. Hayes, R. R. Hails,
and K. L. Schaupp.
