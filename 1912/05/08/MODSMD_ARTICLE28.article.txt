# ISOLATION HOSPITAL TO BE SITUATED ON CAMPUS
## BOARD OF TRUSTEES GRANTS A SPLENDID SITE. Contract to be Let and Work on the Building to be Commenced During Vacation. 
### 
The isolation hospital is to be built
on the campus, the Board of Trustees
having given a site near the rock
crusher. The Guild has appointed a
committee with power to let out the
contract for the construction of the
building and its erection will be
started during the summer.
The acre and a half which the
Board has presented the Guild is ex
tremely well suited for the purpose
for which it is to be userl as it is
situated neither too near or too far
from the University buildings. The
large area of land will not only insure
complete isolation but will also permit
the hospital to have adequate grounds
around it.
The committee of the Guild will let
out the contract for the erection of the
isolation hospital during vacation and
work will commence immediately upon
the acceptance of the bid. The build
ing will cost in the neighborhood of
$7,500. No contract can be accepted
which calls for more than this amount
as this is the limit which has been set.
The new hospital will accommodate
twenty patients and will be able to
care for those of several diseases.
The Guild had already decided upon
a site, which necessitated bringing the
infected through San Mateo county,
but as this was a violation of one of
the laws of the county, it had to be
abandoned.
The Guild, however, had first tried
to bet a site on the campus and it was
only on the failure to do so that they
had accepted the other site. Now,
through the kindness of C. G. Lathrop,
treasurer of the University, it has be
come possible (o build the hospital on
the campus as originally planned.
