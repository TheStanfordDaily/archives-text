# MASQUERADE CARNIVAL PROMISES FUN FOR ALL
## 
### 
Thirty bewitching Varsity Girls,
leading the Carnival parade 011 Thurs
day morning in a tallyho blazing with
| red, occupying a special section of the
bleachers at the Faculty-Senior base
ball game, selling chances for the nu
merous and valuable awards at the
masked carnival along the row, and
dancing at the Kappa Kappa Gamma
; house during the eveningâ€”this is the
startling feature of the Junior conces
sion on Underclassman Day. A Cal
thumpian Band, with a special drum
corps, is a second attraction offered by
the Juniors, and their place in the
morning's parade will undoubtedly be
well marked.
Japanese lanterns will light the Row
011 Thursday evening, and the colored
glare from the 1913 sign will prove one
of the centers of attraction. A nickel
dance will draw the crowd into the so-
{ rority house, and there the official in
; troducers and the Varsity Girl will
j succeed in gathering the stray silver.
| The dancers will be required to un
| mask, and the services of an intro
| ducer is an essential detail. The
! prizes of the evening will be dis
tributed in front of the Junior conces
sion at 10:30, when most of the attrac
tions will have closed.
I "Dixie Land" will take the place of
the Kappa Sigma house on Thursday
..evening. Sometime during the day,

thirty-six mammies, piccaninnies and
topsies, under the protection of the
Sophomore class, will invade the pre
mises of the fraternity, and will reign
supreme throughout the carnival.
Plantation life, minstrelsy, and jubi
leeing will be pictured as it was be
fore the war, and the sweet southern
melodies will prove an irresistible at
traction to the passing throngs. This
remarkable troup will be seen to ad
vantage in the morning's parade, where
they will be led by a superb, twelve
piece, negro band.
Uncle Tom, Little Eva, and all the
other favorites will be included in the
procession. This feature will be sup
plinented by the appearance in line of
a pack of fourteen thoroughbred blood
hounds, just from the south. A special
detail of police will protect the spec
tators.
Before the evening's entertainment
the band will give a special concert at
14 Lasuen and the entire talented
troup of minstrels will appear.
The entire proceeds of the Conces
sion will be turned over by the Sopho
mores to the crew fund, and with the
entire class working on the entertain
ment, the profit will reach a consider
able figure.
Everyone is urged to wear mask and
costume, so as to make the affair suc
cessful.
