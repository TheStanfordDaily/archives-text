# Alumni Ball Team to Play Winners.
## 
### 
Old grads and near-grads will make
their official plunge into the festivities
of Senior Week on Saturday, May 18,
when they organize their ball team for
the annual contest with the winner of
the Faculty-Senior game. At 9:30, on
the Varsity diamond, former baseball
captains and star players will demon
strate to the bleachers how the game
was played in the old days. Such men
as A. L. Trowbridge, '05, G. J. Presley,
'07, and A. E. Roth, '09, will probably
be seen in action, and a lively contest
may be expected.
