# The 						Hospital
## 
### 
Through the kindness and interest
of C. G. Lathrop the Isolation hospital

will soon be a reality.
The site selected for
the erection of the

building is within easy distance of the
Quadrangle and is especially well lo
cated for the purpose of segregating
sufferers from contagious diseases.
