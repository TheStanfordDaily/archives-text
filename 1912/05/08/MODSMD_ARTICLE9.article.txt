# Musical Clubs.

### 
The Combined Musical Clubs will
tour the country again this summer at

the invitation of one of the
transcontinental railroads.
The Musical Clubs have
steadily developed without

any outside assistance until now they
have few equals in the Universities of
the country. Their excellent enter
tainment of a few weeks ago was the
best of its kind Stanford has heard in
years.
Stanford is fortunate in being repre
sented and advertised by organizations
composed of men of this type. We
wish them the best of luck on their
trip.
