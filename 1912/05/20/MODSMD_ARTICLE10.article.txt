# CLASS ORATION
## 
### 
Seventeen years ago this Stanford
custom had its birtl). Within the limits
of our life-time we can measure its
age, and there are some here present

who witnessed
the first solemn
rite at yonder
spot. But such
can not long be
true.. Time will
lend its share
with rapid strides
to the lengthen
ing of this band
of numeralled
metal as it creeps
down this arcade,
and long before

it shall have reached yontler corner
you and I will have played our part in
the history of mankind. In those fu
ture years the words which are spoken
here today will be dead things of the
past, and none will be left to relate
the story of this event. But the hopes
and aspirations which today stir our
hearts will, perhaps, have been real
ized, and to these the future may turn
for the final judgment of the class
of nineteen hundred and twelve.
It is because of this look into the
future that we feel a sense of rever
ence for this lifeless piece of metal
which lies at our feet. As long as
these walls stand, and the hundreds of
Stanford students-to-be pass daily over
this spot, this plate will lie in its
present resting place, a memory of the
class of nineteen hundred and twelve.
Some, attracted by the romance of the
memory of a class long since passed,
will stop here, meditate, and pass 011.
Others, using it as a text, may seek to
philosophize upon the meaning of life
and the rapid passage of years, and
speculate upon what passed thru our
minds as we stood here for the last
time as a class organization. To the
future it will mean poetry of the past.
To us it stands for a living reality.
Whatever the meaning of this event
may be to each of us individually, I
must of necessity leave untouched,
but to all who stand at the close of
their college career to witness thb
awarding of their class emblem for the
last time there must always arise cer
tain common thoughts.
Here the division line is reached.
; > e look backward into the pleasant
Held of memories and forward into the

broad plain of hopes and ideals yet to
be realized and fought for. We have
been building up to this time the m;m
or woman we hope to be. The past
four years spent upon this campus?
have made contributions to that prep
aration which must bring results if
this institution is to justify its exist
ence. We will always linger with
affection over the memories of Stan
ford life. The athletic fields where the
Sons of the Stanford Red struggled
with the Gold and Blue for supremacy;
the red-tiled Quad; the lake, and the
gently rolling hills that stretch be
yond; all these will be to us treasures
of years gone by. But in the every
day walk of life there will cling to us
the debt which we owe to the world
and the generations that are to be. If
we have learned here to love truth, let
us always search with devotion for the
same in the outer world. If, thru the
medium of books and other channels
of acquiring information, we have
sought to be broad-minded and slow
to condemn ideas contrary to our own,
let us always strive to maintain a
balance ~nd breadth of view which
recognizes the individuality of our fel
low man. Let us struggle against
prejudice and selfish sympathy and
seek to extend our view beyond the
narrow confines of our immediate sur
roundings. Democracy of the present
'must reach beyond national jurisdic
tion and geographical boundaries. It
must be broad enough to span the
ocean; high enough to scale the high
est mountain, and strong enough to
raise mankind above the nations. If
any class of men and women should
seek to meet these demands it is the
college man and woman. Not in the
spirit of superiority, but with that pas
sion which strives to know the truth
and, having found it, to pursue it
devotedly.
We hear today of the Yellow Peril.
We are told that Japan is threatening
the safety of the American nation.
High sounding phrases, but what do
they mean? We see the nations of
Europe eyeing each other with fiendish
distrust. Within the borders of Ger
many the German has long since
recognized that disputes between man
and man can best be settled by resort
to reason. But beyond those borders
all men who differ with the German
and his ambitions are enemies. What
is there in the German and Englishman
that should make it impossible for
them to settle their differences as

easily as the disputes which arise
within their respective national bound
aries? lleneath the surface of differing
languages, customs and institutions
there lies the same human mind and
heart which stirs each to love, to hope,
to strive. The German's ideas are as
dear to him as are the Englishman's
to him, and the world is large enough
for both. When those ideas conflict,
which of the two can cry with any
justification, "You are wrong; I am
right," closing his ears to all sound
of reason and truth?
Again, why should we, in the fever
ol national pride and prejudice con
demn the Sons of Nippon as scheming
land grabbers and plotters against the
downfall of this government, when
they seek to establish themselves in
new fields outside of their own coun
try? The American business man,
capitalist, and professional man seek
all fields of the world to establish
themselves, and yet who of us will
listen to him who says that the Ameri
can is plotting the invasion of South
America, China or Australia? Men are
men wherever they may be. They
have common ambitions, altho they
may use various methods to attain an
end. They speak different languages,
serve different gods, and eat different
foods. Mountains and seas separate
them. Some toil beneath the torrid
sun; others endure the piercing cold,
but still they are men. He who is
great enough of mind to recognize the
necessity of variation among men, and
strives to reach above the clouds of
prejudice and narrow sympathy, is a
citizen of the world and a forerunner
of the democracy of mankind. He who
refuses to be blindly led by the tradi
tions of the ages past and throws off
the pall of hatred and conflict which
has fixed itself so firmly in the blood
of the race, is a hero who marks a
point higher in the ever upward striv
ing of humanity.
With this thought before us, as we
stand here today for the last time as
a class organization and dedicate this
plate as a token of love for our Alma
Mater, sealing beneath it those docu
ments which at some future day may
be unearthed by the zealous historian,
let us resolve that not these only shall
be the records by which the memory
of the individuals of the class of nine
teen hundred and twelve shall be
measured. As this plate fills a place
necessary to make this numerical
record complete, so also must we live
with the thought that the slowly ad
vancing march of the brotherhood of
man requires that we fill the place
which awaits us with unflinching
devotion.
To you, President Jordan, Members
of the Board of Trustees and Faculty,
we shall always turn with hearts filled
with kindest memories and sincerest
gratitude for your devotion and loyalty
to your trust.
On the name of our Alma Mater we
will always linger with fondest mem
ories, and, recalling this moment, re
new with added determination the vow
that the four years passed within these
halls shall not have been spent in vain.

four years spent upon this campus?
have made contributions to that prep
aration which must bring results if
this institution is to justify its exist
ence. We will always linger with
affection over the memories of Stan
ford life. The athletic fields where the
Sons of the Stanford Red struggled
with the Gold and Blue for supremacy;
the red-tiled Quad; the lake, and the
gently rolling hills that stretch be
yond; all these will be to us treasures
of years gone by. But in the every
day walk of life there will cling to us
the debt which we owe to the world
and the generations that are to be. If
we have learned here to love truth, let
us always search with devotion for the
same in the outer world. If, thru the
medium of books and other channels
of acquiring information, we have
sought to be broad-minded and slow
to condemn ideas contrary to our own,
let us always strive to maintain a
balance ~nd breadth of view which
recognizes the individuality of our fel
low man. Let us struggle against
prejudice and selfish sympathy and
seek to extend our view beyond the
narrow confines of our immediate sur
roundings. Democracy of the present
'must reach beyond national jurisdic
tion and geographical boundaries. It
must be broad enough to span the
ocean; high enough to scale the high
est mountain, and strong enough to
raise mankind above the nations. If
any class of men and women should
seek to meet these demands it is the
college man and woman. Not in the
spirit of superiority, but with that pas
sion which strives to know the truth
and, having found it, to pursue it
devotedly.
We hear today of the Yellow Peril.
We are told that Japan is threatening
the safety of the American nation.
High sounding phrases, but what do
they mean? We see the nations of
Europe eyeing each other with fiendish
distrust. Within the borders of Ger
many the German has long since
recognized that disputes between man
and man can best be settled by resort
to reason. But beyond those borders
all men who differ with the German
and his ambitions are enemies. What
is there in the German and Englishman
that should make it impossible for
them to settle their differences as

easily as the disputes which arise
within their respective national bound
aries? lleneath the surface of differing
languages, customs and institutions
there lies the same human mind and
heart which stirs each to love, to hope,
to strive. The German's ideas are as
dear to him as are the Englishman's
to him, and the world is large enough
for both. When those ideas conflict,
which of the two can cry with any
justification, "You are wrong; I am
right," closing his ears to all sound
of reason and truth?
Again, why should we, in the fever
ol national pride and prejudice con
demn the Sons of Nippon as scheming
land grabbers and plotters against the
downfall of this government, when
they seek to establish themselves in
new fields outside of their own coun
try? The American business man,
capitalist, and professional man seek
all fields of the world to establish
themselves, and yet who of us will
listen to him who says that the Ameri
can is plotting the invasion of South
America, China or Australia? Men are
men wherever they may be. They
have common ambitions, altho they
may use various methods to attain an
end. They speak different languages,
serve different gods, and eat different
foods. Mountains and seas separate
them. Some toil beneath the torrid
sun; others endure the piercing cold,
but still they are men. He who is
great enough of mind to recognize the
necessity of variation among men, and
strives to reach above the clouds of
prejudice and narrow sympathy, is a
citizen of the world and a forerunner
of the democracy of mankind. He who
refuses to be blindly led by the tradi
tions of the ages past and throws off
the pall of hatred and conflict which
has fixed itself so firmly in the blood
of the race, is a hero who marks a
point higher in the ever upward striv
ing of humanity.
With this thought before us, as we
stand here today for the last time as
a class organization and dedicate this
plate as a token of love for our Alma
Mater, sealing beneath it those docu
ments which at some future day may
be unearthed by the zealous historian,
let us resolve that not these only shall
be the records by which the memory
of the individuals of the class of nine
teen hundred and twelve shall be
measured. As this plate fills a place
necessary to make this numerical
record complete, so also must we live
with the thought that the slowly ad
vancing march of the brotherhood of
man requires that we fill the place
which awaits us with unflinching
devotion.
To you, President Jordan, Members
of the Board of Trustees and Faculty,
we shall always turn with hearts filled
with kindest memories and sincerest
gratitude for your devotion and loyalty
to your trust.
On the name of our Alma Mater we
will always linger with fondest mem
ories, and, recalling this moment, re
new with added determination the vow
that the four years passed within these
halls shall not have been spent in vain.

here today will be dead things of the
past, and none will be left to relate
the story of this event. But the hopes
and aspirations which today stir our
hearts will, perhaps, have been real

for the final judgment of the class
of nineteen hundred and twelve.
It is because of this look into the
future that we feel a sense of rever
ence for this lifeless piece of metal
which lies at our feet. As long as
these walls stand, and the hundreds of
Stanford students-to-be pass daily over
this spot, this plate will lie in its
present resting place, a memory of the
class of nineteen hundred and twelve.
Some, attracted by the romance of the
memory of a class long since passed,
will stop here, meditate, and pass 011.
Others, using it as a text, may seek to
philosophize upon the meaning of life
and the rapid passage of years, and
speculate upon what passed thru our
minds as we stood here for the last
time as a class organization. To the
future it will mean poetry of the past.
To us it stands for a living reality.
Whatever the meaning of this event
may be to each of us individually, I
must of necessity leave untouched,
but to all who stand at the close of
their college career to witness thb
awarding of their class emblem for the
last time there must always arise cer

languages, customs and institutions
there lies the same human mind and
heart which stirs each to love, to hope,
to strive. The German's ideas are as
dear to him as are the Englishman's
to him, and the world is large enough
for both. When those ideas conflict,
which of the two can cry with any
justification, "You are wrong; I am
right," closing his ears to all sound
of reason and truth?
Again, why should we, in the fever
ol national pride and prejudice con
demn the Sons of Nippon as scheming
land grabbers and plotters against the
downfall of this government, when
they seek to establish themselves in
new fields outside of their own coun
try? The American business man,
capitalist, and professional man seek
all fields of the world to establish
themselves, and yet who of us will
listen to him who says that the Ameri
can is plotting the invasion of South
America, China or Australia? Men are
men wherever they may be. They
have common ambitions, altho they
may use various methods to attain an
end. They speak different languages,
serve different gods, and eat different
foods. Mountains and seas separate
them. Some toil beneath the torrid
sun; others endure the piercing cold,
but still they are men. He who is
great enough of mind to recognize the
necessity of variation among men, and
strives to reach above the clouds of
prejudice and narrow sympathy, is a
citizen of the world and a forerunner
of the democracy of mankind. He who
refuses to be blindly led by the tradi
tions of the ages past and throws off
the pall of hatred and conflict which
has fixed itself so firmly in the blood
of the race, is a hero who marks a
point higher in the ever upward striv
ing of humanity.
With this thought before us, as we
stand here today for the last time as
a class organization and dedicate this
plate as a token of love for our Alma
Mater, sealing beneath it those docu
ments which at some future day may
be unearthed by the zealous historian,
let us resolve that not these only shall
be the records by which the memory
of the individuals of the class of nine
teen hundred and twelve shall be
measured. As this plate fills a place
necessary to make this numerical
record complete, so also must we live
with the thought that the slowly ad
vancing march of the brotherhood of
man requires that we fill the place
which awaits us with unflinching
devotion.
To you, President Jordan, Members
of the Board of Trustees and Faculty,
we shall always turn with hearts filled
with kindest memories and sincerest
gratitude for your devotion and loyalty
to your trust.
On the name of our Alma Mater we
will always linger with fondest mem
ories, and, recalling this moment, re
new with added determination the vow
that the four years passed within these
halls shall not have been spent in vain.

Seventeen years ago this Stanford
custom had its birtl). Within the limits
of our life-time we can measure its
age, and there are some here present

who witnessed
the first solemn
rite at yonder
spot. But such
can not long be
true.. Time will
lend its share
with rapid strides
to the lengthen
ing of this band
of numeralled
metal as it creeps
down this arcade,
and long before

it shall have reached yontler corner
you and I will have played our part in
the history of mankind. In those fu
ture years the words which are spoken
here today will be dead things of the
past, and none will be left to relate
the story of this event. But the hopes
and aspirations which today stir our
hearts will, perhaps, have been real
ized, and to these the future may turn
for the final judgment of the class
of nineteen hundred and twelve.
It is because of this look into the
future that we feel a sense of rever
ence for this lifeless piece of metal
which lies at our feet. As long as
these walls stand, and the hundreds of
Stanford students-to-be pass daily over
this spot, this plate will lie in its
present resting place, a memory of the
class of nineteen hundred and twelve.
Some, attracted by the romance of the
memory of a class long since passed,
will stop here, meditate, and pass 011.
Others, using it as a text, may seek to
philosophize upon the meaning of life
and the rapid passage of years, and
speculate upon what passed thru our
minds as we stood here for the last
time as a class organization. To the
future it will mean poetry of the past.
To us it stands for a living reality.
Whatever the meaning of this event
may be to each of us individually, I
must of necessity leave untouched,
but to all who stand at the close of
their college career to witness thb
awarding of their class emblem for the
last time there must always arise cer
tain common thoughts.
Here the division line is reached.
; > e look backward into the pleasant
Held of memories and forward into the

broad plain of hopes and ideals yet to
be realized and fought for. We have
been building up to this time the m;m
or woman we hope to be. The past
four years spent upon this campus?
have made contributions to that prep
aration which must bring results if
this institution is to justify its exist
ence. We will always linger with
affection over the memories of Stan
ford life. The athletic fields where the
Sons of the Stanford Red struggled
with the Gold and Blue for supremacy;
the red-tiled Quad; the lake, and the
gently rolling hills that stretch be
yond; all these will be to us treasures
of years gone by. But in the every
day walk of life there will cling to us
the debt which we owe to the world
and the generations that are to be. If
we have learned here to love truth, let
us always search with devotion for the
same in the outer world. If, thru the
medium of books and other channels
of acquiring information, we have
sought to be broad-minded and slow
to condemn ideas contrary to our own,
let us always strive to maintain a
balance ~nd breadth of view which
recognizes the individuality of our fel
low man. Let us struggle against
prejudice and selfish sympathy and
seek to extend our view beyond the
narrow confines of our immediate sur
roundings. Democracy of the present
'must reach beyond national jurisdic
tion and geographical boundaries. It
must be broad enough to span the
ocean; high enough to scale the high
est mountain, and strong enough to
raise mankind above the nations. If
any class of men and women should
seek to meet these demands it is the
college man and woman. Not in the
spirit of superiority, but with that pas
sion which strives to know the truth
and, having found it, to pursue it
devotedly.
We hear today of the Yellow Peril.
We are told that Japan is threatening
the safety of the American nation.
High sounding phrases, but what do
they mean? We see the nations of
Europe eyeing each other with fiendish
distrust. Within the borders of Ger
many the German has long since
recognized that disputes between man
and man can best be settled by resort
to reason. But beyond those borders
all men who differ with the German
and his ambitions are enemies. What
is there in the German and Englishman
that should make it impossible for
them to settle their differences as

with the thought that the slowly ad
vancing march of the brotherhood of
man requires that we fill the place
which awaits us with unflinching
devotion.
To you, President Jordan, Members
of the Board of Trustees and Faculty,
we shall always turn with hearts filled
with kindest memories and sincerest
gratitude for your devotion and loyalty
to your trust.
On the name of our Alma Mater we
will always linger with fondest mem
ories, and, recalling this moment, re
new with added determination the vow
that the four years passed within these
halls shall not have been spent in vain.
