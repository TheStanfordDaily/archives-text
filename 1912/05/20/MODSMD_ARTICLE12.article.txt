# MANY DEGREES ARE CONFERRED AT COMMENCEMENT ASSEMBLY
## President Jordan and D.P. Barrows Deliver Strong Addresses to the New Graduates. 
### 
Two hundred and seventy-six students were Awarded the Bachelor
of Arts Degree by President David Starr Jordan in the Assembly
llall this morning. These degrees were conferred after the strong
Commencement Address by Professor David Presscot Barrows, who
took as his subject '•Possible Influences of the Panama Canal on Our
National Character." Doctor Jordan then gave the farewell address
to the graduates, "Making-over Society" being his topic.
Besides the A. B. degrees, one Bachelor of Laws, fifty-one Master
of Arts, fifteen Juris Doctor and four Doctor of Philosophy degrees
were granted.

"There is 110 body of students in an
American college today that does not
realize, as well from their own doubts
and dreams, as from their study of
philosophy, that man is drawn in op
posite ways by the attraction of the
material and the summons of the
spiritual," said Doctor Barrows in
beginning his commencement address.
"Our curriculum is permeated by
both influences, with the call to
make life efficient and also to make
it generous, to see with the disillu
sioned scientific eye and yet to main
tain the old chivalric faith in the
worth of things not seen. St. Augus
tine imposed upon a perplexed and
despairing world the belief that there
is no escape from this conflict except
in despising and renouncing the things
of this life. He gave to the middle
ages its characteristic conception of
the irreconcilable antagonism between
the City of the World and the City of
God. Who can say to what extent the
doubts created by this delusion have
paralyzed men's arms and marred
their skill? Something of it descends
upon us of the present day. Men still
weary of their task, doubting its no
bility and, metaphorically, at least,
seek the cloister and the cell.
Spirit Bellind Work.
"I speak to you today in the confi
dent faith that behind our most appar
ent material achievements there may
be a spirit that strips them of gross
ness and makes them noble. Men may
work in field and shop and laboratory
with a confidence in the acceptability
of their effort that the middle ages did
not know. They clear the jungle, sub
due the plague, organize society, and
give it laws, heartened by the belief
that here and not on high is God's
city, and that in the clang of armor and
in the creak of harness rather than in
the rustle of monastic robes men best
serve God.
"Far to the south of us near the
earth's equator, an army of forty thou
sand men has been toiling for six
years at earth's greatest material un
dertaking. The bulk of these men are
black sons of Jamaica and the Bar
bados. They hanrlle the drills; they
fire the blasts; they move the tracks
that crawl incessantly beneath the
swinging shovels. Their broad backs
and dark muscles are ever beneath the
machines, and shove them unceasingly
forward. Other companies come from
those regions rich in the monuments of
man's past efforts, southern Italy and
Sicily; and there are also thousands of
hardy Spanish laborers from the bar
ren hills of Galicia. Seven thousand

are our fellow countrymen, picked
from the skilled organizations of
America."
"No one who has regarded the far
reaching influence of great achieve
ments can doubt the stupendous effect
that the completion of this canal will
bring. An age unlike all others, be
cause of the range of its scientific
knowledge and its power over natural
forces feels that in an achievement like
this its spirit finds complete expres
sion. Perhaps I can illustrate this by
contrasting the ancient spirit with the
new. You will recall the old distrust
with which Antiquity regarded men's
attempts to alter or subdue the harsh
and ungrateful aspect of the world.
To that age such hardihood was pre
sumptuous and certain to bring down
punishment from a jealous and dread
ful God. In such a spirit Herodotus
philosophized over the catastrophe ol
the Great King. He had dared to
assemble that innumerable army; to
cut a canal for his ships across the
peninsula of Mt. Athos; to rival Diety
in the sense of power; and so for his
mad arrogance, his "hubris," Heaven
brought him low. You recall the Ode
of Horace in which he condemns that
reckless, impious adventurer who first
induced man to leave his natural ele
ment the land, and venture out upon
the sea, and who in his folly would
even seek to rise through the air! So
also it appeared to the Hebrew. In his
belief, Jehovah had established the
foundations of the earth, and fixed the
boundaries of the great deep that they
should not be moved forever. But not
so does the modern man view his
efforts to disturb and rearrange the
things of nature. He has gained a new
conception of cosmic development by
which new types, species, even new
worlds may be produced. He has
come to believe himself a partaker in
this process, and men of today say of
themselves with new meaning: 'We are
builders together with God.'
Completion—
"And so a few months from now,
when that greatest of all dreams of
material achievement is consummated;
when the thing striven for since the
days of Balboa and Magellan is done;
when the vertebrae of the continents
lie divided; when the waters of the
Caribbean are connected with the
waters of the South Sea; and when the
great steel messengers of war and
peace for the first time are swung from
lock to artificial lake and from lake to
ocean, we will feel no sense of doubt
or dread, no uneasy consciousness of
divine enmity awakened, but rather

uplift, exaltation and sense of power
and knowledge of mighty things done
and mightier yet to do.
"Few, however, who know human
nature can doubt that this opening of
the Canal will expose us to great
temptations. Cupidity will seize us
as the flow of money follows the great
ships. Ostentation and pride of effort
will settle upon us as our eyes view
this great structure which we have
reared. Prejudice of race will tempt
us to new forms of contempt toward
peoples and communities to whom is
denied opportunity for equal display
of virility and power. In that year of
new beginnings the world will cease
for a moment its occupations, its busy
absorptions, to regard our work with
attention. The Pacific in all its vast
ness, its variety and color of mainland
and island, its enormous range of
human life and institutions will rise
like the curtain of a drama before the
imagination of men At such times the
world is teachable as it is teachable
only in long intervals, capable of re
ceiving extraordinary impressions of
light, generosity and power. What
answer will we as a people give as
men of many nations turn from the
contemplation of our finished labor and
ask us, 'What does this mean?' Will
we answer on that day of testing, 'This
that you see is a monument which we
have builded under the ceaseless spur
of national cupidity. It embodies the
spirit of a people dedicated to amass
ing fortunes that stagger the thought
of the calculator. We have built it in
arrogance and pride. You see in it the
visible expression of our love of ma
terial supremacy. We have built it for
ourselves. Oilier peoples that travel
here, other ships that come and go
through this great natural meeting
and parting place of the world use this
canal on our terms. Our American
principle of protection to privileged
industry will be written into the laws
for its operation. We have built it to
better triumph over the weaker and
darker peoples of the earth, that we
may easier exploit their labor, and
reap the profit that a race of clear
vision and trained organization finds
in men ignorant and numb of will.
Henceforth the Pacific is ours, and we
lay it under tribute to our bursting
warehouses and heavy coffers. This
is what we mean by the Canal; for
men of our mould it can have no other
meaning.'
Is This the Response?
"Is this the response which America
has to give to old Europe and the an
cient East, grown teachable at last,
anxiously observant of the progressive
triumphs of our democracy? This
cannot, must not, be our answer! The
great opportunity of the Canal's in
auguration, to bring home to ourselves
and to the world its spiritual signifi
cance, must neither be despised nor
thrown away in a passing holiday.
You men and women who gather here,
children of a great University which
from its founding has stood grandly
and constantly for idealism and for
peace, you bear the responsibility of
disciplined and enlightened persons to
see that other response goes ringing
abroad through the world on this
Canal's completion. Far greater even
than the danger that our opulence and
ostentation will be augmented, is the
opportunity for the invigorating and
ennobling of our national character

' through the proper interpretation of
this achievement."
"In the first place, we must recog
nize in the Canal the sacrifices of men
; who saw their duty and who neither
] stayed nor turned aside. Fourteen
| years ago there came a great episode
! in our national life. We extended and
established our influence in the Carib
bean and in the China Sea. Our nation
suddenly became important in the fu
ture of tropical peoples. Today we
bear a responsibility that extends far
around this great central belt of the
earth. Our better and our worse na
tures have struggled to possess the
motives of our undertaking, but in
large measure the sense of justice to
the weak, regard for plighted word,
readiness to give as becomes a nation
| from which much will be required,
have held at bay the lust of power and
greed of gain which appear to possess
men of our stock when they enter those
fertile regions where fall the direct
rays of the sun; where so much seems
to be promised and where honor and
character so soon decay. This great
monument at Panama must stand for
the best of our endeavor and the best
of our future aspirations."
"In the second place, the Canal
should teach us a lesson of new faith
and confidence in our national govern
ment. The present is a time of anxi
ous dissatisfaction with the constituted
forms of authority. Men are crying
out in anger that the will of the
people is nullified; that justice is un
obtainable; that the state is controlled
by predatory men. Rut meanwhile our
government has wrought a great task
in singleness of purpose; has set this
sheet of gleaming water between sea
and sea like a rainbow sign to give new
faith to those who have doubted its
integrity. A government whose incom
petence and subservience are declared
at home, has there in the tropics ex
ecuted a great trust in entire compli
ance with the nation's word, without
excess of authority, without waste,
without corruption. There the monu
ment stands, calling to the nation at
home to be equal to its best abroad,
pleading with us to highly resolve that
no lesser standard of honor and effi
ciency shall ever be acceptable by na
tion, state, or municipality in the
execution of those great works which
in increasing measure beset and per
plexed people lay upon public au
thority."
Cnlls For Peace.
"And in the third place our posses
sion of this Canal, the indubitable
naval and political supremacy which
it brings, calls us in long, loud sum
mons of undeniable duty to be a peace
seeking power."
"The great opportuniy of the Canal's
opening and of the manner of its cele
bration lies in awakening popular
consciousness upon these Pacific prob
lems. Not only may we as a people
harden our purposes into a national
resolution to treat all weaker nations
and communities with consideration,
to be moved from just dealing by no
temptations of expediency, to keep our
immense power in humbleness of mind,
but we may also make of this opening
a gathering of all nations and peoples
into the greatest conference that ever
had for its object the promotion of
mutual understanding and the assuring
of peace. Tribes and nations war and
clash, they surge to and fro as thev
