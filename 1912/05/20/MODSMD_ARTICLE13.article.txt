# "MAKING-OVER SOCIETY" SUBJECT OF PRESIDENT JORDAN'S STRONG TALK.
## 
### 
Stanford University is twenty-one
years old. It is now of age. It is old
enough to vote in the councils of the
world. It is old enough to know what
it stands for, what it wants to do,
what its influence shall be in the fu
ture of our republic. You are its
youngest children. You are its ripest
product. You are the nearest to its
ideals in so far as these ideals have
been worked out in action. It is for
you men and women of California to
take your part in the development of
our republic. This is a day of un
rest, of criticism, of change. It is
for you to help to decide in what de
gree unrest is wholesome, to what ex
tent insurgency is progress. In the
eddies of the world great currents may
move backward as well as forward.
It was said of one of the ablest and
most fearless journalists of our time,
that he was always with the outside
line. But he could not always tell
which way the army was going. He
was sometimes on the firing line in
front, and sometimes lead the rear
rank backward. It is the fashion now,
more than it ever was before, to
regard society as effete, outworn,
tyrannical; to consider the institutions
our fathers have built up as a mere
temporary scaffolding; and the Con
stitution, of which the America of the
past has been so proud, as a maze
of paper agreement, respected only
when it favors some man's ambition
or gives play to some man's greed.
We are all radicals when we are
young—a bit set in our ways as we
grow old. Senator Burton has said
that the difference between an insur
gent and a stand-patter is mainly the
difference between forty years of age
and sixty.

And to my case-hardened mind, as
I look back over the years in which I
have been a part of a democratic so
ciety under control of a democratic
constitution, I cannot help thinking
that both are pretty good. Society is
just the best that its constituent units
will allow it to be. It couldn't be any
better so long as it is made up of such
people as you and I, and it can never
be very much worse. In our mutual
relations, we get what we give. In
words attributed to the great Croker,
"New York will always get what is
coming to her." Every community
gets the kind of government it de
serves. The Constitution may have its
defects and its limitations, but the
evils of society are not due to these.
They are the faults of human nature,
and the cure for them is found in bet
ter men.
Stun<lar<ls of Life.
As an old-time radical, whom time
is making conservative, I still believe
that the old laws of living hold good.
In the struggle of life, there is still
a premium placed on faith, hope,
charity, on industry, frugality, so
briety, self-denial, self-restraint, and

persistence. The old virtues of the
Sunday School still remain first
among the elements of social success.
With all the inventions of the most in
genious of all the ages, there is no
way of getting around the primal de
mands of self-control as a means of
working out one's own destiny, or of
helping in the destinies of others. The
same old forms of cement still hold
society together. Kindliness, toler
ance, justice, mutual help and mutual
forbearance, with veracity of thought
and action hold the same values they
have always held. Whatever the
natural gifts of any man, whatever
his temperament or his tendencies, he
must work out his own problem of
character building along the old lines
that make him worth while to his
neighbors.
The nation is now one great family,
a family in which all men are born
politically free and equal, all with the
same right to a fair start, all with the
right and duty to make the most of
themselves, when once the race of
life is on. All with the same prospect
of success in life, if the conditions of
success are within themselves.
A Democratic Nation.
Our fathers dreamed of a nation
which should have no permanent
gradations of rich and poor, of wise
and illiterate, of noble and humble, of
rulers and of servants. That all men
should be alike, or even permanently
equal, is of course, no part of the
scheme of democracy. Permanent
equality can exist only when all are
alike at the bottom of the pit. That
all men should be free so far as out
side constraint is concerned, goes
without saying. The natural limits of
freedom are found in the need of like
freedom for others. No man is free to
throw another into slavery. No man's
right in a democracy goes so far as
to wrong another man. Chains and
slavery there must be so long as the
weaknesses of human nature exist.
Rut these chains in democracy should
be of our own forging and should bind
ourselves alone. The children of the
republic should be all free-born. A
wiser training and a purified society
will one by one strike off the fetters
that bind us today. There is no
method of taxation, no adjustment of
capital, no system of distribution of
earnings that will give freedom to a
man who is a slave to drink. His
tyrant is on the inside and will be
with him wherever he goes. There is

no system which will give the un
skilled laborer the rewards of the
man who uses his brains as well as
his arm. A bushel of coal and a
bucket of water will do the unskilled
laborer's work and requires little
more supervision. The unskilled la
borer is an anomaly in a land of free
dom. He exists because we are not
so far from the dark ages as we some
times imagine. He exists because
freedom herself has not yet overtaken
her insistent duties.
Evils of Alcohol.
There is no system by which men
stupefied by alcohol can take an even
share in the man's work of today. It
is our fault that boys who might be
free grow up sodden and ineffective,
because society cannot protect itself
against an evil and profitable traffic.
I once attended a meeting in Los
Angeles, in which a well known and
impassioned orator depicted the sad
condition of wage slaves, with especial
reference to some decision which had
riveted their chains. If I remember,
it was a judge in Nebraska who did
this. But the real author of these
chains it was not hard to find. The
whole room was rank with the odor of
beer and whiskey. Doubtless wage
slavery makes for drink. But drink in
its turn makes for slavery, and no
man can be a free unit in a free nation
so long as his mind is kept dull with
alcohol. He cannot expect to master
the problems of life unless he is mas
ter of himself. Democracy makes no
guarantee to any man. It gives him
opportunity. That is what democrocy
means. It is trying its best to give
each man a chance to rise, though men
still bearing the chains of mediaeval
oppression are crowding on us faster
than we can take care of them. This
too, we must remember. The pater
nalism that guarantees support to
mediocrity, ignorance, and vice, does
this at the expense of intelligence,
soberness and frugality.
To you, as youth of promise, your .
life at the University is a preparation
for freedom. You will take no chains 1
willingly on yourselves and you will
have no part in forging them for!
others.
Defects of Democracy.
Tn our days in our land, it is really
not boasting to say that ours Is the
triumph of democracy. Never before
in any broad nation was government
so wise, so frugal, so considerate, so
fair, so Intelligent, so just. It is 1

growing better with each generation.
It is for you to help make it better.
There is plenty of room for improve
ment, for it fails, as you well know,
in every one of these regards. Its
great success, its great extent bring
out its defects in glaring prominence.
It is not strange that there are such
defects. For the defects in human
nature appear in all human institu
tions, most of all in continent-wide
effort at co-operation. The force of
money, the insistence of greed, the
love of dissipation, the dead-weight of
ignorance, the resistance of prejudice,
the influence of sheer vulgarity, the
tendency toward spendthrift waste and
display, are all manifest in every day's
governmental transactions. They must
each be met and fought by men.
The conflict is no easy one. It will
go on for generations, so long as ig
norance is possible and greed profit
able. The forces of evil will assume
as many forms as there are kinds of
men. The final remedy does not lie
in changing our machinery. The
strength of machinery lies in its sim
plicity, and ours is not complex. The
national Constitution could doubtless
be improved in spots, but these im
provements have no primary impor
tance. No change in ways of doing
things is going to get rid of the party
hack, the demagogue, the grafter, or
the time-server. The millennium does
not set in with the Initiative and
Referendum. The Recall is only a
confession that our first choice is made
in careless haste. The Initiative is
an assertion that our own representa
tives do not represent. If we want bet
ter government, we must have better
units. To this end, there are only two
ways—to bring in better men, or to
insist on better morals and better
training for the men we have. Better
men are hard to get. They do not
come for the asking. We must look
after better environment to help out
those we have. The future of the
nation is written in the schools of
today. No man is a good citizen until
he can take care of himself and has
something left over for the common
welfare. If he earns no more than
his keep, rich or poor, he is an econ
omic nonentity. To have nothing and
to rail at those who have is not in the
line of social progress. The great
ground swell of moral uplift of the
last ten years has come from better
education. This movement is not
broken and dissipated on the reefs of
politics. It is not the result of the
appeal of any popular leader, though
great popular leaders may ride the
crest of its wave. It is not affected by
the results of any elections. The tides
of the sea do not wait to secure a
majority. They move on from their
own deeper impulse.
The New Politics.
Casting aside the figure, we are get
ting rid of the old politics because we
know something better. The welfare
of the people, the welfare of the world
are replacing the old motives of party
victory. This is in large degree the
work of the public schools. The state
universities of the West are turning
out a hundred men wise and interested
in governmental affairs today to where
there was one twenty years ago. We
are examining our precedents, we are
counting the cost as we never did be
fore, and we are holding in ever higher
valuation the lives of the nation's
children. It is not well for the na
tion's future that little ones should
perish uselessly. Tt is not well for
society that a child should grow up
dwarfed or perverted, if it. once held
the possibility of something better.
"A generous education should be the
birthright of every child of the re
public." "For a man to have died who
might have been wise and was not, this
I call a tragedy."
The movement of democracy cares
nothing for party triumph or defeat.
The issue of elections signfies very
little in comparison with the charac
ters of the voters. At all times, in all
nations, the quality of government
depends on the quality of the indi
vidual men and the degree of intelli
gent interest they give to public affairs.
Eternal vigilance is the price of
Liberty. Eternal vigilance will give
us the government we deserve by help
ing us to deserve it. It is for you to
help the communities you join to de
serve something better. The better
the government they have already, the
more easily it may be improved. It is
a maxim of biology that only highly
developed organisms can show defects.
There are no complaints of social un
rest, as far as I know, in lands where
there is nothing doing. But in these
regions most ruled by justice, intelli
gence, and patience, the efforts to
make over society are most plausible
and persistent. It is not easy to
change the basis of society. Our re
lations are partly the result of past
conditions held together by tradition,
partly the resultant of the forces of
today. Tradition helps determine the
external form, the inner forces, the
essential reality. External forms may
be changed if we like. They count for
little. But internal relations change
modeling society, with any distribu-
Take any particular scheme for re
modelling society, with any distribu
tion you like of rewards for effort, in
a few months conditions would slip
back again, substantially as they are
now. The greedy would be greedy, the
weak would be weak, the strong would
hold an influence proportional to their
momentum. The dangers lie in weak
ness and inadequacy. It is the weak
ness of the weak, rather than the
strength of the strong, from which
springs tyranny and injustice. The
weak invite oppression. The tyrant
falls before the greater power of in
telligent co-operation. But the weak
cannot co-operate. It takes strength
to grasp the real art of democracy,
peaceful co-operation, and peaceful
compromise. To grasp this idea is to
be no longer weak. Violence is not
strength. The cause that demands
violence is a lost cause. The very
essence of democracy is justice
through public opinion. We hear much
of the evils of personal greed and
tyrannical combination in the affairs
of America today. We see that in the
past we have given away empires, with
no thought except to make our re
sources quickly accessible and that
those to whom we have given them are
exploiting them in their own interests
and not in ours. We have carelessly
allowed privilege to become property,
and franchise for the public good to
lapse into personal ownership.
War Scare Finance.
We see a great nation held up for
private exploitation by manufacturing
combines, by ship-building syndicates,
by those who make money out of ru
mors of war and out of artificial
pumped-up patriotism.
But we must not lay too much stress
on all this. The republic is greater
even than any of its parts—greater
than the sum of all of them. If the
people are really injured, they will
sooner or later find out what hurts
them. When they find this out, they
will devise their own cure.
In Europe, we are often criticized

because of our lawlessness and graft.
In the old world, they meet the prob
lem by legalizing whatever form of
greed cannot be otherwise controlled.
Our strength lies in making all wrongs
illegal. Therefore we cry out against
ills, real or imaginary, in a fashion.
Europe finds it hard to understand.
But we achieve our purpose at last.
The wrong is righted sooner or later,
aftar which we pass on merrily to the
next wrong on the list.
Mr. Dooley tells uz that when an
American finds a mosquito in his
house, he goes after it hammer and
tongs, breaks the fiddle over it, steps
on the dog, and scares the cat; but,
at last, he gets the mosquito.
The Englishman 011 the contrary,
after tutile efforts to catch the insect,
accepts the situation, calls his home
Mosquito Lodge, and imagines that the
insect sings "God save the King!"
And we may add, that the more
people there are who study the nature
of insects, the sooner will the mos
quito'be caught; and the more readily
can we turn to other reforms.
The Short Ballot.
Among all the changes in our ma
chinery of democracy which we urge
so stridently today, the one that seems
to me most important, is one that gets
least attention. I mean the Short
Ballot. By the Short Ballot, the
people select those men they know and
can trust, and to these they leave the
choice of all the others. The others
have charge of the expert needs of
society, of exact knowledge of law,
finance, economics, education, engin
eering, and sanitation. With the Long
Ballot, the voter throws away his
liberty by choosing men from a long
list of names of unheard-of people. If
he knows nothing of them, his choice
is not a free man's choice. The most
he can do is to trust his party nomina
tions, and these are made 'inder condi
tions which are not likely to inspire
confidence. The worst man the public
will stand has often been the standard
of party conventions. To escape from
such necessity is the purpose of the
open primary, but every rational ad
vantage of the primary is lost in the
long and complex ballot. There are
two elements essential to the success
of democracy—the free choice of
leaders, and the need of expert service.
In the main business of government,
justice, economy in expenditure, sani
tation, education, and peace, the only
good service comes from thorough
training. The best that can be had are
none too good; and the best cannot be
chosen at a party caucus, nor can they
be retained except on condition of free
dom of action and permanence of ten
ure. Party fealty bears no relation to
good government. The legislator
should be chosen freely by the people,
and should return freely to the people
for confirmation of his acts. He is the
guardian of the liberties of his con
stituents, not their expert servant in
matters demanding finer discrimina
tion. By the Short Ballot, these
leaders and representatives should be
chosen. The choice of expert service
is a function of the executive with the
advice and approval of the people's
chosen representatives.
To elect an engineer, a librarian, a
superintendent of schools, a judge, a
general, by popular vote, is to pick out
your expert servants in the most un
scientific way possible. It is to pei
petuate the "Cult of Incompetence,"
which some writers have held to be
the peculiar burden of democracy. "It
is not only the eminent man," says
Faguet, "who is the thorn in the flesh
of democracies, but every form of
superiority whether individual or col
lective which exists outside the state
01* government." "The people elects
only representatives who are counter
parts of itself, and such are necessarily
anil always its dependents." "Clearly
it is almost impossible for the democ
racy if it means to survive to encour
age efficiency; nay, it is almost impos
sible for it to refrain from destroying
efficiency." The people can encourage
efficiency by realizing the need of it.
This is only possible through the
spread of intelligent education. If the
liberties of the people are not con
served, that is, if men are not equal
before the law, equal in the start in
whatsoever race they run, it is an in
fringement of their liberties. To care
for the primal needs of liberty, the
people must choose representatives of
their own kind.
But there are needs more subtle than
those of liberty, and these can be met
only by men of thorough training in
special lines. The art of administra
tion means the choice of such men.
The very existence of democracy de
pends on the possibility of such educa
tion. The appointing power on the one
hand is as essential as the voting
power on the other.
To render expert service to the com
munity is your duty as Stanford men
and women. Whether public or pri
vate service is a matter of minor im
portance. All efficient private service
becomes sooner or later public. Effici
ent service is as essential in a democ
racy as equality or freedom. In the
long run, the two cannot be separated,
for democracy means popular educa
tion and popular education bears its
natural fruit in special training. Ris
ing intelligence demands better ser
vice, and the demands grows steadily
more and more insistent.
And to this better service among a
free people, we send you forth, with
our best hopes and wishes today.
