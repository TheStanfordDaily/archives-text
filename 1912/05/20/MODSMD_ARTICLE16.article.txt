# Commencement.

### 
A week of fun and frolic will be
over this evening, with the Senior Ball
at the Vendome closing the festive

period. Every one
who stayed over
enjoyed themselves

and relaxed from the strain and stress
of the previous week that "tried men's
souls." Smiles were the order of each
day for every individual and rapidly
eradicated the wrinkles of dull care
that sat so heavily on our brows in the
preceding days. The Farce was the
first event on the program, and al
though the farce was largely lacking
it could not check the barometer of
good-feeling that began to rise as we
closed our last "ex" blank. r ihe
Parade and Carnival were the best
ever, if we may use that trite phrase.
All of the classes were represented
and this speaks well for the future
success of Senior Week. The Prom
enade was another complete success
that the Class of 1912 has achieved.
The Hawaiian musicians added a dis
tinctive touch that widened the gap
between the Senior Week at Stanford
and at other collegiate institutions of
learning. The addition of the try-outs
for the Olympian games was a feature
of these last few days that will make
the 1912 Senior Week long remem
bered.
The Class of 1912 has ceased to
exist as an integral part of Stanford
undergraduate life. As you pass out
into the world we wish you the best
of luck. The customs that you have
followed will he carefully perpetuated
and passed on by the incoming wearers
of the sombrero to those that will
tread the way that you have gone.
1912, farewell!
