# The 						Eastern Invasion.
## 
### 
You Cardinal men who will row the
eight-oared shell at Poughkeepsie on
the twenty-ninth of June, will be the

first representatives of
the Pacific Coast to dip
their blades in the
waters of the Hudson

iii competition with the best collegiate
oarsmen of the Western Hemisphere.
The honor that is yours is well de
served. Four consecutive years you
have outstripped the transbay rowers
and this year you won the Pacific
Coast championship by a wide margin.
With pride we will read of your race
with the picked crews of the East.
Our best wishes go with you.
