# GRADUATES ARE VICTORS IN SENIOR WEEK GAMES
## 1912 DOWNS FACULTY PLAYERS 15 To 6. Alumni Lose Ball Game to A.B. Candidates by the Score of 24 to 3. 
### 
Iii the final test of their undergradu
ate years with the Faculty the class
of 1912 came out on top. Nine in
nings of baseball were enough to
show the superiority of the studes
over their profs and at the end of
this time they had accumulated 15
runs to the losers 6.
During the afternoon every kind
and variety of baseball known was
indulged in. Plays never seen in the
major leagues were pulled off, while
spectacular catches, attempts, throws,
and muffs were ever drawing the great
throng to its feet midst wild applause.
Dr. Cross, playing center field for
the Faculty, made one of the best
plays of the game when he caught a
hard fly and threw to first base in
time to make a double play. Profes
sor Millis caught everything that
came within his reach and chased the
others in fast time. Registrar Mc-
Dowell labored under the false im
pression all afternoon that the ball
was hot, but otherwise got away well.
Professor Angell was exceptionally
lucky in reaching first, much to his
own disgust as this necessitated his
running still farther.
The Seniors all played in the cus
tomary clown costumes and by their
victory earned the right to play the
Alumni ball team. The players lined
up as follows:
Faculty—Park, Moser, pitchers;
Searles, catcher; Millis, first; Angell,
second; Long, short; Park, third;
Murray, left; Cross, center; Mc-
Dowell, right.
Seniors — Enderle, pitcher; Ilen
shaw, catcher; Shattuck, first; Vick
ers, second; Peters, short; Miller,
third; Howell, left; Cooper, center;
Sanborn, right.
Seniors Win Again.
1912 made its final appearance on the
athletic field a victorious one on Satur
day morning when they downed the
Alumni players 21-3.
The game did not prove to be a game
in the true sense of the word but fur
nished the opportunity for the "grads"
to once more get together and attempt
to "come back."
The teams lined up as follows:
Seniors —Enderle, pitcher; Obear,
catcher; Coleman, first; Noble, sec
ond; Peters, short; Gragg, third; Gra
ham, left; Cooper, center; Allen, right.
Alumni—Presley, pitcher; Parsons,
catcher; Colbert, first; Park, second;
Roth, center; Pomeroy, third; Cutler,
left; Crawford, short; McDowell,
right.
