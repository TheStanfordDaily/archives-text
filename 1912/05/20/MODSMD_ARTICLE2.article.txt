# Farce and Prom Are Senior Week Features
## Jerome K.Jerome's Comedy, "Fannie's Relations," Is Presented on the Assembly Hall Stage. 
### Paul Eliel, '13 
It might be said of the Senior farce,
"Fanny's Relations," that too many
butlers spoil the plays. We have had
an excess of these altogether estim
able and aristocratic servants in our
dramatic productions. Not that the
butler, Wednesday, was not all that a
butler should be, but we get tired of
seeing them. This is the third we
have had In the last semester and we
have had only four productions. Twice
we have seen butlers assuming the
master's place and the other time he
was a harmless portion of the cast.
Poor Choice of Play.
All of this is but one of the nu
merous counts which could be men
tioned if an indictment was to be got
ten out against the play on Wednes
day evening. It was poorly chosen for
an amateur production, and its choice
as a Senior farce was even worse.
When we go to see a Senior farce we
go to see a farce. Laughs were few
and far between in "Fanny's Rela
tions." It is absolutely beyond the ar
gument to say anything about the best
obtainable. The number of good
farces which have been written is
still far from exhaustion as far as
Stanford is concerned. The play of
Wednesday evening was not a farce at
all. The central situation was es
sentially farcical but in its treatment
it was handled rather like a drama.
The best that can be said for it is
that it was a play.
From a dramatic standpoint the play
lacked many essentials. The original
and opening attempt at denouement
was well worked out, but the action
could have been under way within ten
minutes as well as within forty. Dear
old maiden aunts are very nice in real
life but when they drag through four
acts they are almost too much. And
here again the fault was not with the
players but with the play. Let us hope
that in future we have Senior farces
of a better and snappier type. They
can be found.
Right here, before we go any far
ther, we want to get one thing off our
minds. On Wednesday evening the
curtain was held for almost twenty
minutes and even then fully a hun
dred people came into the house and
were ushered into their seats. The
first ten minutes of action were quite
incomprehensible except to those in
the first few rows. People coming
in late to plays in the Assembly Hall
should be made to stand in the back
of the house until the curtain falls on
the first act. Such a rule holds in
many of the best theatres, and it
works no hardship. People learn to
arrive on time.
Mathieu's Coaching.
One thing that impressed itself last
evening was the lack of originality in
Mr. Mathieu's coaching. There is a
style about the plays which come un
der his hand which is distinct. It re
sults in the plays lacking originality
from the acting standpoint. One
thinks: "I've seen that some place be
fore. Its part of Mr. Mathieu's stock
of 'business.'" The work is pleading,
but it has a sameness about It.

It is unusually difficult to criticize a
Senior i>lay, either favorably or un
favorably. Too many elements com-
Dine in the last production of the year
to give it the same finish that a mid
semester one usually has. Final ex
aminations must be taken and the
stock of experienced players is usually
exhausted. "Fanny's Relations" suf
fered somewhat from both of these
causes but the work of the thespians
was in spite of them uniformly good.
That it was not the best that is pos
sible at Stanford goes without saying.
But it was the next to the best and
that is considerable satisfaction cor
sidering the class of work which we
have seen in the last year. It is
doubtful if Stanford dramatics wi'.l
ever see another combination like that
of Miss Workman and Mr. Seward.
Miss Bullis the Star.
Acting honors for the evening fall
to Miss I. Bullis, '13, as Fanny. The part
was an unusually difficult one. The
changes from light to shade and back
to light again were almost instanta
neous. In these Miss Bullis was en
tirely good. Her first act was the best.
She was always pleasing, not quite so
convincing, in some places. The
greatest fault that could be found
with her was that in regard to the
change of character which Fanny ex
perienced when she finally assumed
the reins of control. As a whole
though she was good.
Among the men F. H. Reach, '12, as
Martin Bennett was undoubtedly the
best. His butler was always the but
ler even when he was the stern dic
tator. Yet at those points where he
became the dictator he lost just enough
of the formality of the butler to make
him convincing. Especially pleasing
were his voice and enunciation.
Miss A. Gray, '15, and Miss R. Miller,
'12, as the Misses Wetherell made the
most of parts decidedly lacking in real
"meat." It was no fault of theirs that
their lines were often "talky." The
dramatist was to blame for that.
They were always the dear old women
they were intended to be. Miss Gray
with the larger part of the two was
slightly the more pleasing, but this
was due almost as much to the part
as to the way it was presented.
J. J. Argabrite, '12, was George P.
Newte. He made the part live. He
gave it a touch of reality that was con
vincing. He gave the impression less
than any other of the cast of just say
ing his part. There was no sign of
learning it.
J. E. Mclnerny, '13, as Vernon
Wetherell had a difficult part to play
with any degree of success. An occa
sional line projected into the middle
of a conversation followed by pro
longed waiting for something more to
say, is at any time a difficult thing to
do so long as one still remains an in
tegral part of the action. That he had
to do time and again. This as much
as anything else gave his work an
amatuerish flavor.
C. S. Turpin, '13, again took four
lines and as many minutes on the stage
and made a character out of them. His
Ernest was always good. He gave us
the most of our opportunities to laugh

for which we are duly thankful.
Dr. Freeniantle, as played by R. C.
Hamilton, '12, was one of the lost
chances of the performance. Not half
was extracted from the part. It was
merely a weak solution of Freeniantle.
Hamilton was at his ease, however,
throughout, and this made up to a
considerable decree for the lost op
portunities of the part.
Anions the minor characters the

best work was done by Miss V. Mur
ray, '13. Her austerity was terrible in
its earnestness. Other parts, all well
played, were taken by Miss J. Don Car
los, '12, as Jane Bennet, and Miss M.
Horine, '14, as ITonoria Rennet.
"Our Empire" was good and offered
a decided break and diversion in the
third act, but it was so palpably in
troduced for that purpose that it lost
much of its dramatic strength.
