# PROFESSOR OF ECONOMICS DELIVERS PHI BETA KAPPA
## A.S. JOHNSON SPEAKS ON THE "NEW INDIVIDUALISM." Traces Growth of the New Industrialism in a Forceful Address. 
### 
Choosing as his subject "An Ethical
Aspect of the New Individualism,"
Professor A. S. Johnson, head of the
Economies department, delivered a
most scholarly address before the open
meeting of Phi Beta Kappa in the
Chapel on Saturday afternoon. The
speaker traced the growth of the new
industrialism which has come to dom
inate our latter day civilize; ion from
the earlier period in history.
F. W. Weymouth, '09, read an
original poem.
Industry today is largely dominated
by the commercial ideal. When the
process of commercialism is complete
the producer gives little thought to
the consumer's needs; his chief con
cern is to forecast the consumer's
wants and whims, in order to utilize
them for purposes of profit. Produc
tion of the best, is a principle which
is ever on his lips; it animates his
advertising imagination. Production
of the most profitable, is the principle
which actually governs his conduct.
In commercialized industry, improve
ments are made by the producer, and
the user is generally educated to their
need.
"Uncommercialized industry is gov
erned by standards which the producer
establishes for himself and seeks per
sistently to realize. Commercial in
dustry is governed by specifications,
established by the consumer, which
the producer seeks cautiously to evade
In sum, purely commercialized in
dustry offers no permanent guarantee
of either harmony or progress.
Foreign Trade.
"Foreign trade, especially with
peoples of an inferior or a dissimilar
civilization, has been one of the things
which has enabled commercialism to
fasten itself upon industry, to the per
version of the latter's essential nature.
Scarcely less potent in its influence
upon industry has been the unlocking
of vast stores of new productive power
through the progress of discovery and
invention; the exploitation of the
mines and forests and virgin lands of
the Americas, especially the conquest
of mechanical power through applied
science.
"Imperialistic trade and the seizure
and exploitation of the newly dis
covered resources are then the two
great forces to which we must ascribe
the subordination of industry to the
trading motive; the substitution of
consumer's requirements, most often
inexpert, for the self-imposed stand
ards of the producer; the introduction
of the standard of maximum gain in
the place of the old standards of fair
price and just wages. These forces
have sharpened men's wits and broad
ened men's intelligence. But these
forces have also caused men to lose
their pleasure in the performance of
work and to fix their attention chiefly
upon the rewards to be gained by it.
The Cominon Man
"The work of supplying the world,
now and for the future, has become
one of such complexity, requiring so
broad a diffusion of general intelli
gence, that merely personal dignitaries
can never again acquire their ancient
influence over minds, their ancient
hold on man's conduct. There remains
in the world today only the common
man. The common man of today is

not the obscure citizen of earlier
epochs. The same commercial process
which has broken down the earlier
class organization has produced a
differentiation in economic structure,
an independence of parts, which com
pels us to conceive of economic society
as a living organism.
In serving the common man we are
performing a work far more worth
while than that of serving a social
functionary—in the last analysis, so
ciety itself. Our work, then, is signi
ficant or meaningless according as we
conceive society as worthy or not. But
it is significant that society should be
worth serving. As a rule, the ser
vants of society, employers or em
ployees alike, regard any peculiar de
pendence upon society upon their ser
vices as an element strengthening their
bargaining position, a peculiar oppor
tunity for gain.
True Worth of Society.
"The true worth of society md of
work in its service—these are the so
cial values that must govern in the
new industrialism. As mere abstract
ideas they can have no potency. As
abstract ideas the kings and nobles of
an earlier age had no potency; they
were vested with the power of social
values by the work of architects and
sculptors, poets and philosophers. The
poets, as it were, created kings and
knights—ideals toward which actual
rulers and nobles sought to elevate
themselves. Architects and sculptors,
painters and poets, can transform so
cial man and vanity into values cap
able of dominating industry. The task
may be difficult; it is more difficult
than that of vesting glory in the House
of Atreus or the House of Bourbon.
"The ultimate need of the new in
dustrialism, then, is not more trained
skill, more applied science—although
these too are good things in their way
—but artists and poets who shall
translate society and social man into
terms of values worth serving. When
these have done their work we shall
hear less of the deterioration of labor
and the abuse of responsibility, of in
dustrial decay and social corruption,
of irreconcilable conflict and threaten
ed revolution. A revolution will have
been accomplished; a revolution in
ideals and values."
