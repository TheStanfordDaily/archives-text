# SENIOR VAUDEVILLE SCORES A SUCCESS.
## Favorites of Stanford Stage in Many Popular Productions Please Large Audiences. 
### 
Sixty minutes of stars, snap, and
satisfaction made up Nineteen Twelve's
final offering in the world of Stanford
make-believe. The seven numbers on
the program of the Senior vaudeville
show at the Varsity theatre, Saturday
evening, were the pick of the ability
that has been seen by the University
public in the last year.
Honors for the evening go to Miss
Agnes Maloney, '14, in a popular repe
tition of several of her operatic hits,
and to that popular pair of song and
dance comedians, Miss L.de Vilbiss,
'15, and Lester Lewis, '14, in a few
favorite melodies. Unstinted applause
greeted these well-known actors and
several encores hardly satisfied the
audience.
A partial sextet from"The Girl With
the Voice" made a decided hit. Selec
tions from the 1913 opera will never
drag by repetition with this alluring
chorus to reproduce them. Harold
Potter, '15, handled an individual mas
culine part well and was a thorough
"hay-seed." E. R. Fertig lent a classic
tone to the program in a rendition of
two difficult pieces. Miss Gertrude
Workman's final appearance before the
Stanford public was of her usual high
standard. The original monologue,
containing local hits, was a clever
piece of work.
