# Promenaders Make Merry to Strains of Hawaiian Music Beneath Myriad Lanterns of Cardinal Hue.
## 
### 
Amidst arches outlined with lights of
cardinal hue, and soft strains of music
from the Hawaiian orchestra, a gaily
attired throng strolled the walks of
Memorial Court on Friday night in
what was unquestionably the best
Senior Promenade that has ever been
held at Stanford.
The countless electrically lighted
lanterns were arranged so as to shed
a soft red glow over the entire assem
blage, and walls of burlap, which were
tastefully decorated, separated the
green carpeted area and its merry
promenaders from the outside world.
Nor were the customary Senior Week
queeners the only ones who enjoyed
the affair. Alumni, undergraduates,
roughs, co-eds, friends, and citizens of
Palo Alto mingled together in this
fairyland of dreams.
At the four corners of the Court in
tastefully decorated booths, built along
the corridors of the Outer and Inner
Quadrangles, the girls of the Univer
sity served refreshments to whomso
ever passed their way. Represented in

these oases for the weary were Gamma
Phi Beta, Delta Delta Delta, Kappa
Kappa Gamma, Kappa Alpha Theta,
Alpha Phi, Pi Beta Phi, Delta Gamma,
Alpha Omicron Pi, Madrono and
Roble.
The nmsic was rendered by an or
chestra of eight Hawaiians who played
and sang their soft native airs and
many of our own popular ballads. As
the evening drew to a close, the mu
sicians ceased their tuneful occupa
tions and the crowd dwindled away. It
was the unanimous opinion that all
gratitude is due to the Class of 1912
and especially to the Senior Prom
Committee for the delightful affair.
The committee which labored so
efiiciently to make the Prom a success
was composed of the Misses K. Gra
ham, G. Childs, N. Allen, S. Lowman,
G. Burke, and Messrs. J. F. Part
ridge, .T. H. Paine, R. E. Millsap,
H. L. Hubbard, C. C. Argabrite, J. W.
Henderson, B. L. Hostettler, R. H.
Emerson, C. H. Hayes, R. R Hails, and
K. L. Schaupp, chairman.
