# Reception to Seniors.
## 
### 
President and Mrs. Jordan were the
hosts at the annual reception to the
members of the graduating class on
Friday. The function was held in the
Zoology building and will be one of
the most pleasant recollections of the
1912 Senior Week for the large number
of graduates who attended.
