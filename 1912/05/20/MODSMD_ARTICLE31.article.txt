# BACCALAUREATE SERMON IS PREACHED BY DR. C.F. AKED
## Inspiration and Lofty Thought Contained in Masterpiece of Pulpit Oratory Yesterday Morning. 
### 
Taking his text from the Rook of
Revelations, Reverend Charles F. Akec
evolved a truly great and Inspiring
Baccalaureate sermon in the services
of Sunday morning. Dwelling on the
power of the brain to retain all the
stimuli which touched it, and its po
tency as a recording tablet of all our
thoughts and acts, the noted divine
made a stirring appeal to those begin
ning their life work to write only that
which they may be proud of in time of
revelation.
Reverend I). C. Gardner opened the
services, and read the special prayers
for the University and graduating
class. There were taken from all the
ages of Christianity, and were especi
ally appropriate for the occasion. The
music was unusually beautiful, a solo
and two quartets being faultlessly
rendered.
Instruments of Precision.
"Science has in the last few years
accomplished many wonderful things,"
said Dr. Aked, "and the product of
men's skill and ingenuity would seem
to have almost reached perfection.
Delicate instruments are made which
record accurately every movement of
the earth, or every change in the
weather conditions. You are familiar
with the registering barometer and
thermometer, which automatically re
cord every change in atmospheric con
ditions, every deviation in pressure or
tempature.
"We ourselves are just such delicate
instruments of precision, self-register
ing and entirely automatic. Impulses
come to us, and each and every one is
registered on the tablets of the brain,
though we may not be aware of the
record. The brain is a more perfect
instrument that science can ever hope
to develope, for as long as it remains
as it was when it came from the hands
of the Maker it will go on registering,
without our consciousness, our good
and evil acts. A stimulus to the brain
results in a reaction, and constant
stimuli, as the constant application of
exercise in education, render it capaple
of absorbing new and greater things.
"We are making out our souls, —
hideous, fearful, appalling, or pure,
pleasing and beautiful. We are writing
the history of our life on our brain,
engraving it on the sensitive tablets
there. Physically it is the shifting of
molecules, —morally, the building of
character. Character is that which is
engraved, indented, upon the soul; it
is the peculiar mark made by our
thoughts and acts upon our brain. As
a man thinks and acts, so he is, and as
he is, so he will think and act.
"This paradox is true: the material
brain you cannot see, the immaterial
soul is the open window of the
character. A good looking face is
usually the window of a good looking
soul; teh face proves a mirror of the
mind in the end. When a man is a
sensualist, and his life is debauched,
his record is written in the open soul
for all to read, though his thoughts are
hidden.
"And the brain, this recorder of our
acts, is more accurate than the deli
cately adjusted hydrometer and ther
mometer; it is the faultness instru
ment of precision, the Soulometer.
"There is a difference in intensity in

the impulses which come to the brain.
The greatest may be unnoticed and lie
dormant, dead, through many years,
while the trivial, the unimportant,
make a temporary but sharp impres
sion. In twenty years you may do
something which you may not have
done except for the impulses received
today. Today you are receiving im
pulses, twenty years hence they may
condition your character and destiny.
"There are writing fluids which are
not visible on the written page ntil
heated. You are writing upon your
soul with invisible ink —sorrow and
trials will be the fire to bring it out—
and the resulting lines which all may
read prove your character.
"Death is the greatest shock which
conies to us. Is it not right to suppose,
then, that death will bring the revela
tion of the soul? Pure men and wo
men, secure in their love for God, will
not fear the revealing fire. Pure,
gentle and righteous throughout life,
the judgment fire will bring these
qualities to light, and your purity and
goodness will make you proof against
fear of revelation.
Decision.
As you stand 011 the threshold of
your life's work, I urge unon you the
heroic move of decision. I cannot
imagine that the choice will be easier
tomororw, or next week, or next year.
This is the acceptable time, the time of
chivalry, of high resolve. This is your
day of salvation.
"Young men and women, I would
have you lay hold on God in Jesus
Christ—then whenever the record of
your life leaps to light, you will not be
ashamed of the lines. I would that
you may be happly in your judgment,
and you will walk with your heads
above the stars."

Taking his text from the Rook of
Revelations, Reverend Charles F. Akec
evolved a truly great and Inspiring
Baccalaureate sermon in the services
of Sunday morning. Dwelling on the
power of the brain to retain all the
stimuli which touched it, and its po
tency as a recording tablet of all our
thoughts and acts, the noted divine
made a stirring appeal to those begin
ning their life work to write only that
which they may be proud of in time of
revelation.
Reverend I). C. Gardner opened the
services, and read the special prayers
for the University and graduating
class. There were taken from all the
ages of Christianity, and were especi
ally appropriate for the occasion. The
music was unusually beautiful, a solo
and two quartets being faultlessly
rendered.
Instruments of Precision.
"Science has in the last few years
accomplished many wonderful things,"
said Dr. Aked, "and the product of
men's skill and ingenuity would seem
to have almost reached perfection.
Delicate instruments are made which
record accurately every movement of
the earth, or every change in the
weather conditions. You are familiar
with the registering barometer and
thermometer, which automatically re
cord every change in atmospheric con
ditions, every deviation in pressure or
tempature.
"We ourselves are just such delicate
instruments of precision, self-register
ing and entirely automatic. Impulses
come to us, and each and every one is
registered on the tablets of the brain,
though we may not be aware of the
record. The brain is a more perfect
instrument that science can ever hope
to develope, for as long as it remains
as it was when it came from the hands
of the Maker it will go on registering,
without our consciousness, our good
and evil acts. A stimulus to the brain
results in a reaction, and constant
stimuli, as the constant application of
exercise in education, render it capaple
of absorbing new and greater things.
"We are making out our souls, —
hideous, fearful, appalling, or pure,
pleasing and beautiful. We are writing
the history of our life on our brain,
engraving it on the sensitive tablets
there. Physically it is the shifting of
molecules, —morally, the building of
character. Character is that which is
engraved, indented, upon the soul; it
is the peculiar mark made by our
thoughts and acts upon our brain. As
a man thinks and acts, so he is, and as
he is, so he will think and act.
"This paradox is true: the material
brain you cannot see, the immaterial
soul is the open window of the
character. A good looking face is
usually the window of a good looking
soul; teh face proves a mirror of the
mind in the end. When a man is a
sensualist, and his life is debauched,
his record is written in the open soul
for all to read, though his thoughts are
hidden.
