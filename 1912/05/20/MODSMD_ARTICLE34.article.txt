# STANFORD MEN ARE STARS IN OLYMPIC TEAM TRIALS
## Horine Breaks His Own World's High Jump Record—Bellah Betters the Olympiad Mark. 
### 
Two world's records and one Olym
piad record broken, one Olympiad rec
ord equalled and two performances but
one-fifth of a second behind the Olym
piad figures. These are in brief the
features of the first national try-outs
for places on the American team for
the Swedish games which were held on
the Stanford Oval on Saturday. The
best part of the meet was the fact that
Stanford athletes or ex-Cardinal wear
ers were among the stars of the com
petition. (J. L. Horine, '13, made the
most phenomenal leap in the history of
athletics when he cleared the bar at
6 feet 7 inches in the high jump, break
ing his own record made on March 29
against the University of Southern
California by seven-eights of an inch.
Beeson of California took second with
a jump of 6 feet 4 1-2 inches.
Hose Also Makes Record.

high mark by scattering all existing
records for the shot put with the right
and left hands. Rose also bettered the
Olympiad record for the right handed
put with a toss of 49 feet 2 1-2 inches.

S. H. Hellah, '10, former Varsity
track captain, competing for the Mult
nomah Club narrowly missed bettering
L. S. Scott's record in the pole vault
and set the new Olympiad figure at 12
feet 9 5-8. Hellah practically assured
himself of a place on the team which
[ is to represent the United States by
his work on Saturday. He also won
the javelin throw with a heave of 150
feet 10 1-2 inches and took third in
the broad jump.
Alderman Wins Discus.

in the discus throw for both right and
left hands and placed second in the

and R. R. Templeton, '15, tied for sec

race in the 800 meters and annexed

former national champion. The time
for the distance was 1:56 3-5.
Kelly of U. S. C. furnished the big
gest surprise of the meet when he de
feated the field in the high hurdles in
the fast time of :15 2-5. Smithson, the
world's champion, hampered by an in
jured leg, was barely able to place
third. McClure of Oregon made a sen
sational run in the 1,500 meters and
