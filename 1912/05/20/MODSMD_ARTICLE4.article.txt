# "ON TO POUGHKEEPSIE" IS REALIZED
## 
### 
With sufficient money to make the
trip assured and their entry already
accepted by the regatta committee, the
Stanford crew has gone into strict
training for the Pouglikeepsie race,
the greatest college athletic event in
America. The trip across the conti
nent that is to be taken by the Stan
ford oarsmen is the most famous
journey that has ever been undertaken
by a Pacific Coast team, and the eyes
of the west are now turned upon those
nine men who will endeavor to prove
to the East that our athletes are just
as good as theirs.
"On to Pouglikeepsie" has been the
slogan of the entire University ever
since the trip became a possibility and
now the efforts of Captain Seward, the
crew and their loyal student and
alumni backers are to be rewarded.
From now until June 8 the crew
will be on the water at Redwood twice
a day. This will give the men ample
chance to get in fine shape. Leaving
San Francisco on June 8, the crew
will proceed to Chicago, where they
will tarry for a run at the University
of Chicago track. All the way east
the men will do light work on the
train with dumb bells and short runs
will be made wherever the train stops.
June 13 is the day scheduled for the
arrival at Pouglikeepsie. The date of
the regatta is June 29, which gives the
men over two weeks to get acclimated.
Never i nthe history of rowing has
a western crew entered the Eastern
classic. Wisconsin is the only uni-

versitv outside of the Atlantic slope
that has ever competed. The follow
ing are the universities that will row
on June 29: Cornell, Columbia, Penn
sylvania, Syracuse, Georgetown, Wis
consin, and Stanford.
While it is not possible to concede
Stanford a victory, nevertheless all
followers of the rowing game on the
Pacific, including such well-informed
men as Pat O'Dav, and Coach Conni
bear of Washington, are of the opinion
that the Cardinal eight will make a
name for itself by the great fight it
will put up.
The crew that goes east will be
identical with the one that rowed
against California and Washington in
April except for number G. Wickman,
who rowed that position, had to return
to Honolulu a few weeks ago and his
place is to be taken either by P. P.
Clover, '14, or E. B. Wolford, '15.
Clover was a member of the 1914
Freshman Intercollegiate Crew and
substituted on the Varsity this year.
Wolford pulled number 4 in this year's
Freshman boat. The other men in the
shell will be: Stroke, ,T. H. Partridge;
No. 7, R. H. Seward; No. 5, R. F.
Duryea; No. 4, F. B. Watkins; No. 3,
C. Smith; No. 2, C. H. Beal; Bow, R. W.
Olmsted; coxswain, F. L. Guerena.
As to the money. $1350 has been
raised from the members of the stu
dent. body and friends on the campus
and the remaining $650 that is neces
sary to pay the expenses is being col
lected from the alumni.

Wolford pulled number 4 in this year's
Freshman boat. The other men in the
shell will be: Stroke, ,T. H. Partridge;
No. 7, R. H. Seward; No. 5, R. F.
Duryea; No. 4, F. B. Watkins; No. 3,
C. Smith; No. 2, C. H. Beal; Bow, R. W.
Olmsted; coxswain, F. L. Guerena.
As to the money. $1350 has been
raised from the members of the stu
dent. body and friends on the campus
and the remaining $650 that is neces
sary to pay the expenses is being col
lected from the alumni.
With sufficient money to make the
trip assured and their entry already
accepted by the regatta committee, the
Stanford crew has gone into strict
training for the Pouglikeepsie race,
the greatest college athletic event in
America. The trip across the conti
nent that is to be taken by the Stan
ford oarsmen is the most famous
journey that has ever been undertaken
by a Pacific Coast team, and the eyes
of the west are now turned upon those
nine men who will endeavor to prove
to the East that our athletes are just
as good as theirs.
"On to Pouglikeepsie" has been the
slogan of the entire University ever
since the trip became a possibility and
now the efforts of Captain Seward, the
crew and their loyal student and
alumni backers are to be rewarded.
From now until June 8 the crew
will be on the water at Redwood twice
a day. This will give the men ample
chance to get in fine shape. Leaving
San Francisco on June 8, the crew
will proceed to Chicago, where they
will tarry for a run at the University
of Chicago track. All the way east
the men will do light work on the
train with dumb bells and short runs
will be made wherever the train stops.
June 13 is the day scheduled for the
arrival at Pouglikeepsie. The date of
the regatta is June 29, which gives the
men over two weeks to get acclimated.
Never i nthe history of rowing has
a western crew entered the Eastern
classic. Wisconsin is the only uni-

versitv outside of the Atlantic slope
that has ever competed. The follow
ing are the universities that will row
on June 29: Cornell, Columbia, Penn
sylvania, Syracuse, Georgetown, Wis
consin, and Stanford.
While it is not possible to concede
Stanford a victory, nevertheless all
followers of the rowing game on the
Pacific, including such well-informed
men as Pat O'Dav, and Coach Conni
bear of Washington, are of the opinion
that the Cardinal eight will make a
name for itself by the great fight it
will put up.
The crew that goes east will be
identical with the one that rowed
against California and Washington in
April except for number G. Wickman,
who rowed that position, had to return
to Honolulu a few weeks ago and his
place is to be taken either by P. P.
Clover, '14, or E. B. Wolford, '15.
Clover was a member of the 1914
Freshman Intercollegiate Crew and
substituted on the Varsity this year.
