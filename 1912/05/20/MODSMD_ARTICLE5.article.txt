# NOISE AND JOY OF CARNIVAL FROLICS ENTERTAIN THRONGS
## "Bigger and Better" Parade, Ball Game and Splendid Evening Entertainment Are Features Marking Second Underclassmen Day on Thursday. 
### 
If there had only been some green
and blue and red toy balloons at the
Carnival, Squantumville on circus da>
would have had nothing on the Stan
ford Farm. Every other mark of a
great and glorious holiday was there.
There were lights, and motion, and
noise; let him who dare, tell us that
a red-corpuscled human can be silent
ly hilarious. The crowd was cosmo
politan—revellers from Cairo joining
hands with those from Dixie and the
High Sierras. Moreover, the crowd
was happy. The class of 1912 poured
everyone into the melting pot of joy;
and all came out kids. With care-free
King Karnival in command, conven
tion counted not at all.
The tradition of a Stanford Carni
val on Underclassmen Day, auspici
ously inaugurated last year, received
on Thursday evening an impetus
which will propel it into the ranks of
permanent institutions.
The Parade.
The parade in the morning started
the big day. With smiles of proud
proprietorship— l said smiles being
partly concealed by five cigars cocked
at a plutocratic angle—the members
of the committee, R. H. Seward, C. R.
Nunan, A. O. Gragg, M. F. Enderle,
and C. H. Shattuck, rode at the head
of the procession. Next came the
representation of the Sophomore show
from Dixieland. Complete in every
detail was this feature, with a brass
band of real plantation darkies play
ing and singing a variety of cotton
field melodies at one and the same
time. All in caps and gowns, the
Senior women rode past in four auto
mobiles. This was the most academic
note of the parade. As the next entry
came down the line of march the ap
plause grew deafening, and one might
know that the Varsity "S" girls of the
Junior Class were coming. They rode
in a tallyho and two automobiles.
One of the largest and most enter
taining exhibits in the parade was the
one which advertised the "Lure o'
Gold" concession of the Geology anu
Mining department. The department

entered a Wild Western Band, cow
boys and a cowgirl, and prospectors
who roamed about the streets and
)awns finding "pay dirt" in the most
unlikely places. The Society Ball, the
Freshman concession, was represent
ed by perhaps the daintiest and most
effective entry of the parade; with
four young women of the class riding
instate in a little flower-bedecked
phaeton, and throwing (lowers to the
bystanders. The nature of Delta Up
silon's "Battle of the Ghosts" was
mysteriously and mournfully indicated
by a funeral cortege.
The Frazer cup for the best entry
in the parade was awarded to the
Freshmen, while a five dollar order
on The Regent for the best individual
entry was given to the Geology and
Mining department.
Evening brought the crown and
climax of the day. Mysteriously the

'Viw had be n transformed, into a
dream city—a city of noisy but happy
dreams. Myriads of colored lights,
the notes of competing bands and the
softer strains of waltz music, the
raucous tones of many barkers, all
lent carnival color. Flower girls,
confetti sellers, and box-ball expo
nents urged the economic, advantages
of the free circulation of cash.
Perhaps the most elaborate and
finished performance was the Uncle
Tom's Cabin of the Sophomore class,
which transported the audience back
to Dixie with all its music and mirth,
and more than fulfilled the promises
of excellence given by its entry in
the morning parade.
Within the Alpha Phi house an ex
hibtion of fancy, folk and national
dancing of a high order won applause
from crowds. The "Lure o' Gold"
| drew many to the Beta house, which

was entirely turned over to a conces
sion which, in externals only, repre
sented a gambling den in a western
mining camp. The Freshman class in
its "Streets of Cairo" exhibited fancy
dancing of really unusual excellence,
and raffled candy and told fortunes on
the side.
The Varsity Girls, who drew great
crowds to the Kappa Kappa Gamma
house, and nickel dancing in the
Kappa Alpha house, held the merry
makers long after the other conces
1 sions had closed.
This year's Carnival was better ar
ranged than last year; the shows and
concessions were infinitely better; and
if there was less of the confetti-throw
| ing spirit on the streets, let us lay it
| to the fact that there were so many
I things to do, and withal so many
things to do you, as to make such
! exterior demonstrations impossible.
