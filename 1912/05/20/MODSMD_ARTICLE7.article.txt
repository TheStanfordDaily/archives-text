# CLASS HISTORY

J. C. Thomas.
Classmates and friends:
Four years ago today probably each
one of us was looking with fear and
trembling and anticipation to a day
towards the end of August, when we
would enter the University which we
had chosen above all others. Today
the greater number of us leave that
University.
What has happened between those
two periods, between the day when we
straggled into the Quadrangle from all
parts of the world, unknown to each
other and uncertain, and today, when
we go out together, the Class of 1912,
friends and comrades?
Details are a small part of a history.
They are set in small type. Athough
they must have their place, and will
have it in this chronicle, yet I will
not let their shadow stand in front of
the more important things that this
class has accomplished, the things
that have done and will do most for
this University. The record of each
year reads much like the previous,
with new names substituted for those
of the year before. Each class follows
the well-traveled road of rushes, class
games, Junior Weeks, Operas, elec
tions and merry-making generally.
But I will first set down those achieve
ments which we will be most proud to
remember.
The Class of 1912 has given to the
University, Student Control. That was
something requiring courage in the
doing. No other class dared attempt
it. Karl Schaupp, aided by one or
two others, took the opportunity as it
stood, and set the machine of student
government in motion with so little
ado and noise that few people realize
that five men, the majority of them
members of this Class, are now gov
erning the most turbulent side of the
University community, the masculine
side.
The women, too, have reached out
and taken government unto them
selves. The significance of their move
ment was not, perhaps, as momentous
as that of the men. Their work, we
say it with pride, concerns the more
peaceful side of the University com
munity. The service that these two
movements of the men and the women
will do for Stanford are too far-reach
ing to be seen now. and will be

subjects for future historians. The
leaders of the control committees have
been Classmates Misses Nina Moise,
Gertrude Workman, and Messrs. Karl
Schaupp, Les Summerfield, and Harry
Seward.
Another achievement of the class is
one that may seem out of place among
what may be termed the greater
events —the sending !hc Pacific
Coast championship > ■ >■ gh
keepsie. On the fa may
seem to be a mere aiuic ( • and
its right to be set down before the
other athletic details of the class
history questioned. But I think that
in a year or so we will* be happy and
proud that ours was the class that ac
complished this. A committee com
posed practically of 1912 men had
charge of the collection of funds for
the trip: Stan Kennedy, chairman, and
Tom Coleman. The captain of the
eight is a Twelve man bred in the
bone, Harry Seward, and the stroke,
.Tack Partridge, has been borrowed by
1913 for a captain next year.
The Senior Class will present to
Stanford a more tangible benefit in
sending the crew east than in any
thing else that it has done. Although
Stanford is perhaps better known than
any other western college, yet many
will be found there who do not know
whether we paddle to classes in canoes
or dash up on bronchos. The effect
that our eight bronzed giants and
coxswain, and their ability to row, will
have upon such people, will be well
worth all the efforts that this class has
put forward in paying the expenses.
The value of this achievement is not
as a mere athletic event, nor can it
be spoken of in the language of
sports. It will bring the east and the
west together, and, from a mercenary
standpoint, will be better advertising
for Stanford than any other one thing.
The Class of 1912 leaves the Uni
versity, able to say that we have seen
at least one victory in each of the five
sports, and in one have not seen de
feat. We have witnessed four vic
tories in crew, one of them a Pacific
Coast championship. We have seen
two victories in track, with two world's
records, in the pole vault, and the high
jump, and a Middle Western Confer
ence meet won.
We have seen one victory In football,
one in baseball, and one in tennis, with
a California state championship for
good measure. In all of these sports

1912 men have been to the front. We
havQ given six captains: Erb, Gilfillan,
Schaupp, who was loaned to 1911 last
year, Seward, Coleman, and Morgan,
who was also loaned to 1911. Be
sides them, two captains-elect have
been recruited from the class, Obear
and Partridge, who will help 1913 de
feat California next year, that class
feeling that it could not do without
some of us.
Schaupp has been president of the
Student Body, and we contribute
Nunan to aid the 1913 regime as vice
president.
The presidents of the class have
been eight: Lewis, Grimes, Wilson,
Cohen, Donovan, Millsap, Coleman and
Seward.
Nineteen twelve has allowed no one
to aid her in editing the University
publications. The Daily Palo Alto has
had Nunan and Thomas; the Chapar
ral, Summerfleld; the Sequoia, Robin
son; and the Quad, Howell. Bogies,
apparently, have found no editorial
timber among the members of 1912,
and ceased with the palmy days of
Menlo.
With Hayes as president of the Con,
bined Musical Clubs, and with vari
ous members of the class enrolled in
the Glee and Mandolin Clubs, Orches
tra and Band, we have been ably rep
resented in music.
In theatrical activities 1912 has
maintained a stock company almost
from the beginning of its career. One
or two have trodden the boards since
they were Freshmen, while others have
come into the limelight only recently.
The company includes Misses Work
man, Wendling, Moise, Holmes, Hill
yer, and Messrs. Seward, Cohen, Per
son, Lewis, Beach and Argabrite.
Representatives in debating have
been: Tincher, Henshaw, Person, Wil
son, and Tucker.
In the scholarship list, also, 1912 has
had a place, and Phi Beta Kappa re
cently elected Misses Burke, Engel
hard, Herron, Jones, Marcus, Miller,
Sanborn, Wendling, Whittemore, and
Messrs. Nunan, Paine and Richardson.
1912 has the distinction of having
presented the first original Junior
Opera,* with the music in part com
posed by a representative of the fairer
half of the class, Miss Mary Herdman.
The Class has also been a pioneer in
the founding of a limited school of
astronomy, and A. G. Atkinson has
built a domed observatory that already
casts defiance in the direction of Mt.
Hamilton.
This is the record of 1912. Details
have been omitted in favor of a more
general outlook of the labors of the
class in four years. There are many
events, doubtless, that will remain
vividly in the minds of some of us in
dividually, events that have an im
portant bearing on the great problem
of co-education. But we must become
silent there, and, for lack of definite
history, are silent.
The work of the class is finished.
Hail and Farewell, 1912.

University, Student Control. That was
something requiring courage in the
doing. No other class dared attempt
it. Karl Schaupp, aided by one or
two others, took the opportunity as it
stood, and set the machine of student
government in motion with so little
ado and noise that few people realize
that five men, the majority of them
members of this Class, are now gov
erning the most turbulent side of the
University community, the masculine
side.
The women, too, have reached out
and taken government unto them
selves. The significance of their move
ment was not, perhaps, as momentous
as that of the men. Their work, we
say it with pride, concerns the more
peaceful side of the University com
munity. The service that these two
movements of the men and the women
will do for Stanford are too far-reach
ing to be seen now. and will be

subjects for future historians. The
leaders of the control committees have
been Classmates Misses Nina Moise,
Gertrude Workman, and Messrs. Karl
Schaupp, Les Summerfield, and Harry
Seward.
Another achievement of the class is
one that may seem out of place among
what may be termed the greater
events —the sending !hc Pacific
Coast championship > ■ >■ gh
keepsie. On the fa may
seem to be a mere aiuic ( • and
its right to be set down before the
other athletic details of the class
history questioned. But I think that
in a year or so we will* be happy and
proud that ours was the class that ac
complished this. A committee com
posed practically of 1912 men had
charge of the collection of funds for
the trip: Stan Kennedy, chairman, and
Tom Coleman. The captain of the
eight is a Twelve man bred in the
bone, Harry Seward, and the stroke,
.Tack Partridge, has been borrowed by
1913 for a captain next year.
The Senior Class will present to
Stanford a more tangible benefit in
sending the crew east than in any
thing else that it has done. Although
Stanford is perhaps better known than
any other western college, yet many
will be found there who do not know
whether we paddle to classes in canoes
or dash up on bronchos. The effect
that our eight bronzed giants and
coxswain, and their ability to row, will
have upon such people, will be well
worth all the efforts that this class has
put forward in paying the expenses.
The value of this achievement is not
as a mere athletic event, nor can it
be spoken of in the language of
sports. It will bring the east and the
west together, and, from a mercenary
standpoint, will be better advertising
for Stanford than any other one thing.
The Class of 1912 leaves the Uni
versity, able to say that we have seen
at least one victory in each of the five
sports, and in one have not seen de
feat. We have witnessed four vic
tories in crew, one of them a Pacific
Coast championship. We have seen
two victories in track, with two world's
records, in the pole vault, and the high
jump, and a Middle Western Confer
ence meet won.
We have seen one victory In football,
one in baseball, and one in tennis, with
a California state championship for
good measure. In all of these sports

1912 men have been to the front. We
havQ given six captains: Erb, Gilfillan,
Schaupp, who was loaned to 1911 last
year, Seward, Coleman, and Morgan,
who was also loaned to 1911. Be
sides them, two captains-elect have
been recruited from the class, Obear
and Partridge, who will help 1913 de
feat California next year, that class
feeling that it could not do without
some of us.
Schaupp has been president of the
Student Body, and we contribute
Nunan to aid the 1913 regime as vice
president.
The presidents of the class have
been eight: Lewis, Grimes, Wilson,
Cohen, Donovan, Millsap, Coleman and
Seward.
Nineteen twelve has allowed no one
to aid her in editing the University
publications. The Daily Palo Alto has
had Nunan and Thomas; the Chapar
ral, Summerfleld; the Sequoia, Robin
son; and the Quad, Howell. Bogies,
apparently, have found no editorial
timber among the members of 1912,
and ceased with the palmy days of
Menlo.
With Hayes as president of the Con,
bined Musical Clubs, and with vari
ous members of the class enrolled in
the Glee and Mandolin Clubs, Orches
tra and Band, we have been ably rep
resented in music.
In theatrical activities 1912 has
maintained a stock company almost
from the beginning of its career. One
or two have trodden the boards since
they were Freshmen, while others have
come into the limelight only recently.
The company includes Misses Work
man, Wendling, Moise, Holmes, Hill
yer, and Messrs. Seward, Cohen, Per
son, Lewis, Beach and Argabrite.
Representatives in debating have
been: Tincher, Henshaw, Person, Wil
son, and Tucker.
In the scholarship list, also, 1912 has
had a place, and Phi Beta Kappa re
cently elected Misses Burke, Engel
hard, Herron, Jones, Marcus, Miller,
Sanborn, Wendling, Whittemore, and
Messrs. Nunan, Paine and Richardson.
1912 has the distinction of having
presented the first original Junior
Opera,* with the music in part com
posed by a representative of the fairer
half of the class, Miss Mary Herdman.
The Class has also been a pioneer in
the founding of a limited school of
astronomy, and A. G. Atkinson has
built a domed observatory that already
casts defiance in the direction of Mt.
Hamilton.
This is the record of 1912. Details
have been omitted in favor of a more
general outlook of the labors of the
class in four years. There are many
events, doubtless, that will remain
vividly in the minds of some of us in
dividually, events that have an im
portant bearing on the great problem
of co-education. But we must become
silent there, and, for lack of definite
history, are silent.
The work of the class is finished.

Classmates and friends:
Four years ago today probably each
one of us was looking with fear and
trembling and anticipation to a day
towards the end of August, when we
would enter the University which we
had chosen above all others. Today
the greater number of us leave that
University.
What has happened between those
two periods, between the day when we
straggled into the Quadrangle from all
parts of the world, unknown to each
other and uncertain, and today, when
we go out together, the Class of 1912,
friends and comrades?
Details are a small part of a history.
They are set in small type. Athough
they must have their place, and will
have it in this chronicle, yet I will
not let their shadow stand in front of
the more important things that this
class has accomplished, the things
that have done and will do most for
this University. The record of each
year reads much like the previous,
with new names substituted for those
of the year before. Each class follows
the well-traveled road of rushes, class
games, Junior Weeks, Operas, elec
tions and merry-making generally.
But I will first set down those achieve

its right to be set down before the
other athletic details of the class
history questioned. But I think that
in a year or so we will* be happy and
proud that ours was the class that ac
complished this. A committee com
posed practically of 1912 men had
charge of the collection of funds for
the trip: Stan Kennedy, chairman, and
Tom Coleman. The captain of the
eight is a Twelve man bred in the

1913 for a captain next year.
The Senior Class will present to
Stanford a more tangible benefit in
sending the crew east than in any
thing else that it has done. Although
Stanford is perhaps better known than
any other western college, yet many
will be found there who do not know
whether we paddle to classes in canoes
or dash up on bronchos. The effect
that our eight bronzed giants and
coxswain, and their ability to row, will
have upon such people, will be well
worth all the efforts that this class has
put forward in paying the expenses.
The value of this achievement is not
as a mere athletic event, nor can it
be spoken of in the language of
sports. It will bring the east and the
west together, and, from a mercenary
standpoint, will be better advertising
for Stanford than any other one thing.
The Class of 1912 leaves the Uni
versity, able to say that we have seen
at least one victory in each of the five
sports, and in one have not seen de
feat. We have witnessed four vic
tories in crew, one of them a Pacific
Coast championship. We have seen
two victories in track, with two world's
records, in the pole vault, and the high
jump, and a Middle Western Confer
ence meet won.
We have seen one victory In football,
one in baseball, and one in tennis, with
a California state championship for
good measure. In all of these sports

1912 men have been to the front. We
havQ given six captains: Erb, Gilfillan,
Schaupp, who was loaned to 1911 last
year, Seward, Coleman, and Morgan,
who was also loaned to 1911. Be
sides them, two captains-elect have
been recruited from the class, Obear
and Partridge, who will help 1913 de
feat California next year, that class
feeling that it could not do without
some of us.
Schaupp has been president of the
Student Body, and we contribute
Nunan to aid the 1913 regime as vice
president.
The presidents of the class have
been eight: Lewis, Grimes, Wilson,
Cohen, Donovan, Millsap, Coleman and
Seward.
Nineteen twelve has allowed no one
to aid her in editing the University
publications. The Daily Palo Alto has
had Nunan and Thomas; the Chapar
ral, Summerfleld; the Sequoia, Robin
son; and the Quad, Howell. Bogies,
apparently, have found no editorial
timber among the members of 1912,
and ceased with the palmy days of
Menlo.
With Hayes as president of the Con,
bined Musical Clubs, and with vari
ous members of the class enrolled in
the Glee and Mandolin Clubs, Orches
tra and Band, we have been ably rep
resented in music.
In theatrical activities 1912 has
maintained a stock company almost
from the beginning of its career. One
or two have trodden the boards since
they were Freshmen, while others have
come into the limelight only recently.
The company includes Misses Work
man, Wendling, Moise, Holmes, Hill
yer, and Messrs. Seward, Cohen, Per
son, Lewis, Beach and Argabrite.
Representatives in debating have
been: Tincher, Henshaw, Person, Wil
son, and Tucker.
In the scholarship list, also, 1912 has
had a place, and Phi Beta Kappa re
cently elected Misses Burke, Engel
hard, Herron, Jones, Marcus, Miller,
Sanborn, Wendling, Whittemore, and
Messrs. Nunan, Paine and Richardson.
1912 has the distinction of having
presented the first original Junior
Opera,* with the music in part com
posed by a representative of the fairer
half of the class, Miss Mary Herdman.
The Class has also been a pioneer in
the founding of a limited school of
astronomy, and A. G. Atkinson has
built a domed observatory that already
casts defiance in the direction of Mt.
Hamilton.
This is the record of 1912. Details
have been omitted in favor of a more
general outlook of the labors of the
class in four years. There are many
events, doubtless, that will remain
vividly in the minds of some of us in
dividually, events that have an im
portant bearing on the great problem
of co-education. But we must become
silent there, and, for lack of definite
history, are silent.
The work of the class is finished.

Classmates and friends:
Four years ago today probably each
one of us was looking with fear and
trembling and anticipation to a day
towards the end of August, when we
would enter the University which we
had chosen above all others. Today
the greater number of us leave that
University.
What has happened between those
two periods, between the day when we
straggled into the Quadrangle from all
parts of the world, unknown to each
other and uncertain, and today, when
we go out together, the Class of 1912,
friends and comrades?
Details are a small part of a history.
They are set in small type. Athough
they must have their place, and will
have it in this chronicle, yet I will
not let their shadow stand in front of
the more important things that this
class has accomplished, the things
that have done and will do most for
this University. The record of each
year reads much like the previous,
with new names substituted for those
of the year before. Each class follows
the well-traveled road of rushes, class
games, Junior Weeks, Operas, elec
tions and merry-making generally.
But I will first set down those achieve
ments which we will be most proud to
remember.
The Class of 1912 has given to the
University, Student Control. That was
something requiring courage in the
doing. No other class dared attempt
it. Karl Schaupp, aided by one or
two others, took the opportunity as it
stood, and set the machine of student
government in motion with so little
ado and noise that few people realize
that five men, the majority of them
members of this Class, are now gov
erning the most turbulent side of the
University community, the masculine
side.
The women, too, have reached out
and taken government unto them
selves. The significance of their move
ment was not, perhaps, as momentous
as that of the men. Their work, we
say it with pride, concerns the more
peaceful side of the University com
munity. The service that these two
movements of the men and the women
will do for Stanford are too far-reach
ing to be seen now. and will be

subjects for future historians. The
leaders of the control committees have
been Classmates Misses Nina Moise,
Gertrude Workman, and Messrs. Karl
Schaupp, Les Summerfield, and Harry
Seward.
Another achievement of the class is
one that may seem out of place among
what may be termed the greater
events —the sending !hc Pacific

west together, and, from a mercenary
standpoint, will be better advertising
for Stanford than any other one thing.
The Class of 1912 leaves the Uni
versity, able to say that we have seen
at least one victory in each of the five
sports, and in one have not seen de
feat. We have witnessed four vic
tories in crew, one of them a Pacific
Coast championship. We have seen
two victories in track, with two world's
records, in the pole vault, and the high
jump, and a Middle Western Confer
ence meet won.
We have seen one victory In football,
one in baseball, and one in tennis, with
a California state championship for
good measure. In all of these sports

1912 men have been to the front. We
havQ given six captains: Erb, Gilfillan,
Schaupp, who was loaned to 1911 last
year, Seward, Coleman, and Morgan,
who was also loaned to 1911. Be
sides them, two captains-elect have
been recruited from the class, Obear
and Partridge, who will help 1913 de
feat California next year, that class
feeling that it could not do without
some of us.
Schaupp has been president of the
Student Body, and we contribute
Nunan to aid the 1913 regime as vice
president.
The presidents of the class have
been eight: Lewis, Grimes, Wilson,
Cohen, Donovan, Millsap, Coleman and
Seward.
Nineteen twelve has allowed no one
to aid her in editing the University
publications. The Daily Palo Alto has
had Nunan and Thomas; the Chapar
ral, Summerfleld; the Sequoia, Robin
son; and the Quad, Howell. Bogies,
apparently, have found no editorial
timber among the members of 1912,
and ceased with the palmy days of
Menlo.
With Hayes as president of the Con,
bined Musical Clubs, and with vari
ous members of the class enrolled in
the Glee and Mandolin Clubs, Orches
tra and Band, we have been ably rep
resented in music.
In theatrical activities 1912 has
maintained a stock company almost
from the beginning of its career. One
or two have trodden the boards since
they were Freshmen, while others have
come into the limelight only recently.
The company includes Misses Work
man, Wendling, Moise, Holmes, Hill
yer, and Messrs. Seward, Cohen, Per
son, Lewis, Beach and Argabrite.
Representatives in debating have
been: Tincher, Henshaw, Person, Wil
son, and Tucker.
In the scholarship list, also, 1912 has
had a place, and Phi Beta Kappa re
cently elected Misses Burke, Engel
hard, Herron, Jones, Marcus, Miller,
Sanborn, Wendling, Whittemore, and
Messrs. Nunan, Paine and Richardson.
1912 has the distinction of having
presented the first original Junior
Opera,* with the music in part com
posed by a representative of the fairer
half of the class, Miss Mary Herdman.
The Class has also been a pioneer in
the founding of a limited school of
astronomy, and A. G. Atkinson has
built a domed observatory that already
casts defiance in the direction of Mt.
Hamilton.
This is the record of 1912. Details
have been omitted in favor of a more
general outlook of the labors of the
class in four years. There are many
events, doubtless, that will remain
vividly in the minds of some of us in
dividually, events that have an im
portant bearing on the great problem
of co-education. But we must become
silent there, and, for lack of definite
history, are silent.
The work of the class is finished.
Hail and Farewell, 1912.
