# CLASS WILL
## 
### 
We, the Class of Nineteen Twelve,
realizing full well that our hours are
many and that therefore our (lays are

few in this our
present existence,
do hereby make
this our last will
and testament, in
order to bestow on
them most worthy
our goods and chat
tels to have and to
hold forever until
they, too, have to
go to work. There-

fore, being in as sound a mind as the
present humane system of final ex
aminations allows us to be, we do
make the following devises and
legacies:
To all who bear the name of Stan
ford we leave the privilege of uphold
ing her good name by act and deed, of
fighting her battles and traditions.
We further entrust to the undergradu
ates the nurture of the Stanford Spirit,
and we ask that they preserve it, as it
is now, earnest, helpful, hopeful in
defeat as well as in victory.
To the class of 1913 we leave tender
memories of their baptism at our
hands and much confidence in their
ability to take up the duties we have
just relinquished, because of the fact
that we leave behind us some of our
selves in order to aid them in their
most arduous undertakings. So, we
bequeath to them as Commodore of
the Navy, Skipper Partridge, who has
our sanction to stroke the fifth con
secutive victory over California, and
as leader in baseball we leave the
blonde head of J. Obear. To him also
do we grant the right to strive dili
gently in order to be some day able
to place after his name the mystic
figures "A. I?., 1915."
On the bowl egged frame of Louis
Cass we put the football responsi
bilities, and we hereby resolve that
when the Big Day comes, all of our
spirits, who are within haunting dis
tance, will come flitting back from
wherever in Heaven or Earth we are,
in order to see that hoodoo broken.
To Campbell of Nevada we grant
with confidence the care of the track
prospects and to George Horine we be
queath an easement to first place in
the high jump.
Pete Ambrose is given the privilege
of heading a Student Body, devoid of
all frictions and disturbing elements,
and we impose upon all members of
the same the duty of unselfish support
and unswerving loyalty.
To the inmates of the Law Library
we grant the privilege of listening to
the loud and learned discussions of
Peckham and >ld, but upon each
of the said li we place the bur
den of constfc ice both on their
walk and tall

given a long, a is hope, a per

manent vacation. The Advisory Com
mittee of the University Conference is
granted the tasks, which were the
former's, and the duty of distributing
justice to all who come into their
talons. But we absolutely forbid any
of them to raise black whiskers.
To Redwood we give the faint rem
nant of the trade that was once
Menlo's, and to the Board of Trus
tees we present an alarm clock. T<
whomsoever is responsible for the
rapid erection of the eating club
houses we extend our sincere thanks.
The present Freshmen are given
leave to wear the red hat, which in
variably transforms the wearer into
a thing of mystery and self impor
tance, and the Sophomores have our
permission to deck their pedal ex
tremities in our discarded garments
of corduroy. To the men of Thirteen
we bequeath our hats and the wish
that from beneath the brims they may
see as full and great a year as have
we.
To Silk Hat Harry Heath and our
Genial Treasurer we grant the con
tinued use of the beautiful boulevards
of our campus. To said Harry we also
leave one coat to take the place of the
one that he doesn't wear in the
Library.
To B. J. O'Donnell we leave one
chance to make good and from the
H. S. Crocker Company we leave with
a sigh of relief.
Budie Hakes is recognized as the
successor of Laurence Macomber at
the Alpha O. house and a pat of com
mendation is given to Rusty Chandler
for his gallant efforts to gladden the
life of at least one girl in every house
on the campus.
The mighty task of preserving the
present standard of the "Chaparral"
is reserved for the sturdy head of M.
T. Dooling, to whom we further be
queath a rhyming dictionary. Upon
his brother we bestow a pair of brass
knuckles.
With confidence in his ability we
grant the"Daily" to 1.1. Ingraham,
with the hope that it will keep him
out of dramatics.
When these last bequests are safe in
the hands of their worthy recipients,
Nineteen Twelve ends her college ex
istence and passes out into that great
bourne, from which no man returns
wearing the same kind of clothes. Our
days in the land of Stanford have been
many and our joys have been great and
numerous. The lessons we have
learned have sunken deep into our
minds and they have taught us rever
ence and love for the place which we
must leave. We stand on the brink
of a gulf called Seriousness and it
looks so dark and forbidding that we
would almost turn back, but we have
paid our diploma fees and it is too
late. But. as we go, we promise to
the University our lasting love, our
patriotism, let us say, and surely our
undying interest.
