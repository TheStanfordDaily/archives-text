# CLASS WILL
## 
### 
We, the Class of Nineteen Twelve,
realizing full well that our hours are
many and that therefore our (lays are

few in this our
present existence,
do hereby make
this our last will
and testament, in
order to bestow on
them most worthy
our goods and chat
tels to have and to
hold forever until
they, too, have to
go to work. There-

fore, being in as sound a mind as the
present humane system of final ex
aminations allows us to be, we do
make the following devises and
legacies:
To all who bear the name of Stan
ford we leave the privilege of uphold
ing her good name by act and deed, of
fighting her battles and traditions.
We further entrust to the undergradu
ates the nurture of the Stanford Spirit,
and we ask that they preserve it, as it
is now, earnest, helpful, hopeful in
defeat as well as in victory.
To the class of 1913 we leave tender
memories of their baptism at our
hands and much confidence in their
ability to take up the duties we have
just relinquished, because of the fact
that we leave behind us some of our
selves in order to aid them in their
most arduous undertakings. So, we
bequeath to them as Commodore of
the Navy, Skipper Partridge, who has
our sanction to stroke the fifth con
secutive victory over California, and
as leader in baseball we leave the
blonde head of J. Obear. To him also
do we grant the right to strive dili
gently in order to be some day able
to place after his name the mystic
figures "A. I?., 1915."
On the bowl egged frame of Louis
Cass we put the football responsi
bilities, and we hereby resolve that
when the Big Day comes, all of our
spirits, who are within haunting dis
tance, will come flitting back from
wherever in Heaven or Earth we are,
in order to see that hoodoo broken.
To Campbell of Nevada we grant
with confidence the care of the track
prospects and to George Horine we be
queath an easement to first place in
the high jump.
Pete Ambrose is given the privilege
of heading a Student Body, devoid of
all frictions and disturbing elements,
and we impose upon all members of
the same the duty of unselfish support
and unswerving loyalty.
To the inmates of the Law Library
we grant the privilege of listening to
the loud and learned discussions of
Peckham and >ld, but upon each
of the said li we place the bur
den of constfc ice both on their
walk and tall
The Student > Committee is
given a long, a is hope, a per
