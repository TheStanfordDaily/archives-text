# SEASON TICKETS ARE PLACED ON SALE TODAY
## MONEY SAVING SCHEME WILL INTEREST STUDENTS. Admittance to Twenty Football Games May be Had for One Dollar. 
### 
Graduate Manager D. W. Burbank
has annw _.d that the season ticket
system which proved such a success
last year will again be adopted for this
season. The price will be three dollars
—the same as last fall —and this in
cludes the Student Body assessment
of two dollars.
The tickets will admit to all the
football games of the year with the
exception of the two contests with the j
Australians and the IntereaLlgjgiate 1
game with California. The tickets j
will, however, be accepted for the ;
two Vancouver games.
Last season a large majority of the j
students took advantage of this ticket j
system and it is expected that every
member of the student body will avail
himself of the opportunity this year, j
According to the present football |
schedule, there will be nine Varsity \
games and fourteen freshmen games, l
making twenty-three in all. The regit- j
lar price for each game is twenty-five i
cents. The season ticket will admit
the purchasers to twenty of these
games for one dollar, thereby saving
each member of the student body four
dollars on the entire season. Another
good feature of the scheme is that it
is an Inducement to attend the games
regularly and "get behind the team."
The tickets are to be placed on sale
at the Registrar's OTice on the Inner
Quad today, and may be obtained there
any time between now and Wednesday
night.
