# The 						Stanford Crew.
## 
### 
For the first time Stanford's sturdy
crew, representing the Pacific Coast,
rowed in the Poughkeepsie Regatta,

and met defeat. The
way they played the
game opened the eyes
of the Eastern athletic

world. The East now knows the Stan
ford spirit and Stanford knows more
of the East. The results are bound lo
be beneficial. We must follow up the
opening wedge and send the Stanford
rowers to the Hudson again next
summer. We may well be proud of
the reputation that our crew has made
for us. Let us show it by sending
them East again.
