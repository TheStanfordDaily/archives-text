# Get a Season Ticket.
## 
### 
When you register don't forget to
secure your season ticket and member
ship in the Student Body. There is
a big season of athletics

ahead of you and it is up
to every one to give their
support. You can do part

of your share if you have a
season ticket. A season ticket costs
but a dollar and admits you to five
dollars worth of games. Freshman,
buy a ticket and secure an option on
the Stanford Spirit that is to be yours.
Seniors, Juniors, Sophomores, set the
example! You cannot represent Stan
ford on any team or in any activity
unless you are a member of the Asso
ciated Students. Membership gives
you a voice in all affairs of the Stu
dent Body. You can't buy the Stan
ford Spirit, but neither can you get
'*â–  unless you pay your Student Body
and secure a season ticket. Do
jw!
