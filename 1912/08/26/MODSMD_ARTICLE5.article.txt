# Volunteers Extinguish Blaze.
## 
### 
A volunteer fire brigade saved the
Zela Psi house from destruction on
the morning of July 20. The summer
residents of the campus responded
promptly to the fire alarm and within
an hour the blaze was extinguished.
The damage, from fire and water,
amounted to between one and two
thousand dollars.
