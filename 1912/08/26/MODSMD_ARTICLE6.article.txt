# VARSITY CREW RECEIVES GREAT OVATION IN EAST
## Cardinal Oarsmen Lose Race but Win Plaudits and Hearty Invitation to Come Again. 
### 
The crash of a giant bomb, marking
the drop of a plummet line bearing
the streamers of six great American
universities, from the arch of the gi- j
gantic steel bridge at Poughkeepsie on :
..Mine 29, officially told a story 30,000'
iiall-niad collegians already knew. i
Cornell had swept the river in the !
Intercollegiate Regatta again, and ;
below the victorious Cornellian Cane
the Crimson of Wisconsin, for second ;
place; then successively the Hlue and
White of Columbia, the Orange of
| Syracuse, the Red and Ulue of Penn-j
sylvania, and the Cardinal of Stanford.
Hut the race itself is an old story j
now. Not one of the scores of Car
dinal rooters who saw the regatta but
puts their hopes in the opportunity
again to see a Stanford crew row out :
to the stake boats at Krum's Elbow on '
the Hudson to match blades with the 1
four great crews of the East and the '
sturdy oarsmen from the Middle West. 1
Ovation For Stanford.
Although 3,000 miles from home and
practically dependent upon themselves, j
no crew could have been accorded a
greater ovation than the Stanford Var
sity received at the hands of the East
ern oarsmen, their managers and the j
Frankly admiring the pluck
of ihe Varsity in traveling
across the continent without a coach !
or a trainer to test their skill with ,
the splendidly coached navies, the j
Eastern men did everything in their
power to assist Captain Seward. '
Dozens of little courtesies that only
one or two of the Big Three enjoy, !
were extended to the oarsmen of the
Pacific and commodores and coaches 1
one and all offered a hearty invitation
to come and receive the privileges j
again.
The day of the race was a record- '
breaker for heat. Under an overcast :
sky, the six crews rowed in a sticky, ;
murky atmosphere that exhausted even
the rooters. Every one of the 48 oars
men suffered terribly from the heat,
but the weight fell heaviest on the j
Varsity, who labored under climatic ;

conditions different from any day they j
had trained on the Hudson.
More Well Trained.
As calm and collected as if on the
bay at Redwood, tiie Varsity felt that
all opportunity was theirs in the first
r. â– vi on the Hudson. They were train
ed to the minute.
The boom of the referee's gun set
six boat loads of men churning
the water to foam, and found the
Varsity and Wisconsin fighting it out
for the lead in the first half dozen
strokes, with Cornell, Pennsylvania and
Syracuse close up and Columbia ap
parently out of the race, much to !
everybody's surprise. Hut it did not
take the Blue and White men long to
get together.
Hundreds of Eastern college men
were cheering for Stanford and Wis
consin on the end of the yells for their
own varsities. But the sturdy Western
crews could not hold the lead. The
sticky atmosphere took all the power
out of their stroke and quickly the
wonderful machine-like rock of the
e.ghts of Columbia and Cornell send
them up in front.
Fighting gamely the Cardinal eight
and Wisconsin dropped back in the
s 'cond division with Pennsylvania and
Syracuse. To those in the observation
cars the strokes of the Western oars
men were as regular as the leaders,
but the boats did not get through the
water like the rest.
Wisconsin Passes.
At tho end of two miles, the Wiscon
sin varsity made a wonderful recovery
and began to [mil up. But the Car
dinal crew, in their first race under
such conditions, could not get the
power in their heaves in the sticky
atmosphere, although they put into it
everything they had.
Slowly but surely Wisconsin crept
past Syracuse and went after Colum
bia, who hung close to Cornell's stern, j
In a wonderful sprint in the last mile, j
l ie Badgers overreached Columbia, and
began a titanic struggle with Cornell.
