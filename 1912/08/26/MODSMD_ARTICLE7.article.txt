## V. M. SMITH, â€™14, KILLED IN AN EXHIBITION FLIGHT. Air Pocket is Cause of Fatality as Airman Turns His Biplane. 
### 
Victor M. Smith, '14, Stanford's
pioneer aviator, while making an ex
hibition flight from Mountain View on
the morning of July 13, met with a
tragic death by falling from a new
Curtiss biplane, equipped with a fifty
horse power Roberts motor. Smith
had just started a week end aviation
exhibition between Estrada Park in
Mountain View and Ravenswood, Palo
Alto. He had given a display of fancy
flying at Estrada Park, and started
for Palo Alto, flying over the Univer
sity en route. He flew about fifty
yards past the place where he was to
light, and started to turn, when he
struck an air pocket, which caused
the accident.
Smith did not attend Stanford last
semester, but took a course in the
Curtiss aviation school in San Diego,
being particularly noticed there for
tbp quickness with which he learned
the art of aviation, and in establishing
a new speed record for licensed avia
tion pilots during his test for a pilot's
license.
While attending Stanford, he regis
tered in the Civil Engineering de
partment, and on the track was a fast
miler. At the time of his fall he was
we iring 'he "Fourteen" sweater vhiHi
he had been given for placing in the
mile against the California Freshmen.
