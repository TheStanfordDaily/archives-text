# LONG DISTANCE RUNNERS MAY COMPETE FOR CUPS.
## 
### 
To incite interest in cross-country
running, a plan is being formulated
to provide six trophy cups to be com
peted for this fall by long distance
runners on the campus.
Palo Alto merchants probably will
provide the trophies and "Dad" Moul
ton lias announced that if the plan is
successfully consummated he person
ally will offer one cup.
The trophies will be contested by
divisions, probably one division for
fraternity men, one for residents of
Encina, and divisions formed among
the various clubs on the campus.
