# HEALTH OFFICER MAKES REPORT ON MILK SUPPLY
## H.O. JENKINS CLASSIFIES THE DAIRIES SUPPLYING CAMPUS. New Ordinance Establishes Two High Grades, “Inspected and Pasteurized” Milk. 
### 
H. O. Jenkins, Palo Alto health olfi
cer, submitted his report on the avail
j able supplies of milk for the campus
|on August 17th. The report is of un
; usual interest to the residents of the
campus and Palo Alto, as it is the re
sult of painstaking work and is
I scientifically correct.
it reads, in part, as follows: "A
new and up-to-date milk ordinance
I was put into effect on June 10, 1912,
| which provides for the establishment
lof two high grades of milk, namely,
"inspected" and "Pasteurized." The
j production of these grades is entirely
optional with the dairymen, but certi
, ficates bearing the name of the Board
iof Public Safety are allowed to be
! placed on each bottle or can.
One dairy has already entered upon
the production of "Inspected" milk,
and has more than fully met the re
quirements. Several other dairies are
tuberculin tested, and the conducted
along lines of consistent cleanliness.
Pastuerized milk is milk that has
been heated to a temperature neces
sary to kill the pathogenic organisms,
and has then been rapidly cooled. In
Palo Alto no one is allowed to label
milk as "Pasteurized" unless it has
been treated according to this hold-
I ing process.
No milk will be allowed to be pas
teurized that does not meet the mini
mum requirements for milk to be
sold raw in Palo Alto. Thus dairies
| scoring less than GO per cent, will not
be allowed to pasteurize.
Following is the record of dairies
| delivering on the campus:
Sloan Dairy (milk delivered by
Howard Dairy Delivery, Palo Alto).
All cows tested and passed. Sanitary
score, 98 per cent.
This dairy has been granted a per
imit to label the milk cans and bottles
(with the words "Inspected Milk or
Cream, Class A Dairy, Board of Pub
! lie Safety."
Jersey Dairy, Alba Park Addition,
