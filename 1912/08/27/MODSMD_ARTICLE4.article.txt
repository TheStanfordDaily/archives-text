# WHO'S HERE AND WHY AMONG RUGBY VETERANS
## TWELVE FORMER MEN NOW ON CAMPUS. Return of Many Star Flayers Makes Football Outlook Bright for Coming Season. 
### 
With the return of twelve Varsity
veterans assured and others expected,
Stanford Rugby fans are wearing the
smile that won't come off. Ten mem
bers of last year's Intercollegiate fif
teen are now reported as on the cam
pus, expecting to register. These men
are: A. M. Sanborn, W. L. Smith,
Frank, Schaupp, Gard, Cass, Harri
gan, Noble, Kern, Risling, and Erb.
Watkins is expected on the campus
shortly. Partridge, the tall pine of
the middle rank, will probably register
tomorrow. In the backfield, in addi
tion to those mentioned, Thoburn,
right wing on the 1910 Varsity, and
Reeves, second five on the same team,
will both don their togs again.
Veterans Return.
Many 1911 substitutes and others of
the near great will make a strong bid
for Varsity berths. Corbet and Tem
pleton are both in especially fine
shape.
From all reports last year's Fresh
man fifteen has returned to the
campus almost intact, and many of
these players, with an added year's
weight, strength, and experience,
should make their mark in the Car
dinal Rugby world this season. 1916
is as yet only a great question mark
as far as its rugby material is con
cerned.
From this it will be seen that
enough tried and true players to con
stitute a complete fifteen will appear
on the field at the first practice. Not
a single department of the game,
either in scrum or backfield, lacks a
nucleus of star veterans. The old
stock phrase, "prospects look bright,"
seems well justified at the beginning
of the 1912 season.
The Varsity will be given the best
of practice by a number of stars who
are now ineligible. G. E. Olmstead,
'11, the giant side-ranker who opposed
California in 1910, returns after a year
at Columbia, and will be seen on the
turf, as will probably Detel?, former
Santa Clara fullback. J. O. Miller. '08,
will again help in the work. Various
well-known players of the American
game will transfer to Stanford this
year, including 11. Landreth, captain
at Occidental last year.
Practice Saturday.
The first practice of the fall is
scheduled for Saturday. The rugby
suits will be given out Friday evening,
while Thursday evening is reserved
for the opening rally. Coach G. J.
Presley and Captain Louis Cass will
be in charge of the candidates, and
the coaching will be conducted in the
usual manner, with the exception that
Coach Presley will be absent two
evenings a week, at which times his
orders will be carried out by the
assistant coaches. ,

either in scrum or backfield, lacks a
nucleus of star veterans. The old
stock phrase, "prospects look bright,"
seems well justified at the beginning
of the 1912 season.
The Varsity will be given the best
of practice by a number of stars who
are now ineligible. G. E. Olmstead,
'11, the giant side-ranker who opposed
California in 1910, returns after a year
at Columbia, and will be seen on the
turf, as will probably Detel?, former
Santa Clara fullback. J. O. Miller. '08,
will again help in the work. Various
well-known players of the American
game will transfer to Stanford this
year, including 11. Landreth, captain
at Occidental last year.
Practice Saturday.
The first practice of the fall is
scheduled for Saturday. The rugby
suits will be given out Friday evening,
while Thursday evening is reserved
for the opening rally. Coach G. J.
Presley and Captain Louis Cass will
be in charge of the candidates, and
the coaching will be conducted in the
usual manner, with the exception that
Coach Presley will be absent two
evenings a week, at which times his
orders will be carried out by the
assistant coaches. ,
With the return of twelve Varsity
veterans assured and others expected,
Stanford Rugby fans are wearing the
smile that won't come off. Ten mem
bers of last year's Intercollegiate fif
teen are now reported as on the cam
pus, expecting to register. These men
are: A. M. Sanborn, W. L. Smith,
Frank, Schaupp, Gard, Cass, Harri
gan, Noble, Kern, Risling, and Erb.
Watkins is expected on the campus
shortly. Partridge, the tall pine of
the middle rank, will probably register
tomorrow. In the backfield, in addi
tion to those mentioned, Thoburn,
right wing on the 1910 Varsity, and
Reeves, second five on the same team,
will both don their togs again.
Veterans Return.
Many 1911 substitutes and others of
the near great will make a strong bid
for Varsity berths. Corbet and Tem
pleton are both in especially fine
shape.
From all reports last year's Fresh
man fifteen has returned to the
campus almost intact, and many of
these players, with an added year's
weight, strength, and experience,
should make their mark in the Car
dinal Rugby world this season. 1916
is as yet only a great question mark
as far as its rugby material is con
cerned.
From this it will be seen that
enough tried and true players to con
stitute a complete fifteen will appear
on the field at the first practice. Not
a single department of the game,
either in scrum or backfield, lacks a
nucleus of star veterans. The old
stock phrase, "prospects look bright,"
seems well justified at the beginning
of the 1912 season.
