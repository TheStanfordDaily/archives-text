# “Keep on the Boat.”

### 
The Daily Palo Alto is the official
organ of the Associated Students. It
is your paper and we need

your support in maintain
ing it. Advertisements

alone do not make it a
success, we need your subscription.
When you are on the Quad tomorrow
let our representatives there sign you
up for a year's subscription. The
folks at home are interested in Stan
ford, otherwise you wouldn't be here.
Send them the Daily for a year. You
want to keep tab on the collegians
across the bay, why not exchange with
your California chapter or with some
friend of yours over there. Read the
Daily and "keep on the boat." Don't
borrow a copy, but subscribe.
