# ATHLETIC FIELDS ARE IN EXCELLENT SHAPE
## “SAM” ROUTS INVADING ARMY OF GOPHERS. Proposal Made to Build Fence From Car Line to the Rugby Field. 
### 
With the completion of the work
on the various ileitis and bleachers
projected during the summer vaca
tion, Stanford may now proudly take
a place among the leading univer
sities and colleges of the United
States, boasting of one of the finest
equipments in the way of athletic
fields in the country.
After a strenous campaign covering
an extended period, the grass on the
Stanford field, the best turf in the
West, has been saved from an inva
sion of gophers. Credit for the ex
tinction of the pests which seriously
threatened the destruction of the
grass for weeks, belongs to Sam Mc-
Donald, guardian of the Stanford
fields and training houses. Sam not
only checked the inroads of the go
phers but also established a record
for a single day's hunt of one hundred
and thirty-seven. McDonald refused
to take his usual vacation because he
felt that his services were needed on
the campus. The turf is now in
superb condition.
Auxiliary Field.
In addition to the fields already in
condition, a new auxiliary football
field has been completed north of the
track. This field is to be used for
practice and for contests when the
other gridirons are occupied.
During the summer the baseball
bleachers were painted and put in
excellent shape. Special attention
was paid to the trees and shrubbery
which have been planted near the en
ti .c ; to t'-e diamond. It is planned
to park t.ie en a. o athletic enclosure.
As an experiment, a fifty yard turf
track has been constructed inside the
oval. This will be used for early fall
training and as a precaution against
break-downs. If it is successful, more
turf will be put in later. One hun
dred tons of cinders were placed on
the straightaway during vacation.
Graduate Manager D. W. Burbank
states that plans are underway for the
erection nf an artistic fence along the
road from the car-line to the football
field. This will be made of eitu-er
iron oi- brick, and will also be in the
line of parking off the grounds.
