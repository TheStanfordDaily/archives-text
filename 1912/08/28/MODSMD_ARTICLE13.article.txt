# Race Horses Raised on Estate.
## 
### 
About the middle of the summer,
$5000 worth of race horses were
shipped from the Stanford farm to the
Latonia race tracks in Kentucky. The
lot consisted of five yearlings. Bear
catcher, the famous stallion that creat
ed such a sensation at Emeryville a
few years ago, is the sire of three of
the speeders. The horses were not
raised under the management of the
University Trustees, hut by men in
terested in fine horses, who rented the
farm stables for breeding purposes.
