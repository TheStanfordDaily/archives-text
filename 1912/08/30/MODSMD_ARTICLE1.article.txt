# "GET TOGETHER AND GO TO IT" IS SLOGAN OF INITIAL RALLY
## Steam Roller Cheer Makes Encina's Walls Tremble During Demonstration for Coach Presley 
### 
i "That Psychological Something" was
in the air last night and struck the
keynote of the rally which opened
the 1912 Rugby season in a way that
few seasons have been inaugurated.
It was the spirit of "That Psycho
ogical Something" which Coach Pres
ey said would send the Cardinal-shirt
ed players irrestibly across the line
for a try. Seldom have the "Vai
sity" and the "Railroad" been barked
out more vociferously from the bottom
of the lungs and the bottom of the
hearts of a gathering representing al
most the entire masculine portion of
the Student Body. For a good eight
minutes the rooters, refusing to be
pacified, yelled a vociferous salute
to Coach Presley, thus eclipsing last
year's record-breaking ovation, which
lasted seven minutes. Similar tributes
were paid to the other speakers.
With reports of the political conven
tions fresh in mind, the rooters adopt
ed a new "steam roller" yell, which,
starting slowly and rythmically, grew
faster and faster, ended in a very
whirlpool of sound when the big
machine had, metaphorically, crushed
the California hopes.
! Ambrose Talks.
I Seven speakers were called upon
during the evening by Yell-leader W.
| S. Wilson, '13. The first of these was
A. W. Ambrose, '13, President of the
Associated Students, who said in part:
("The spirit of tonight shows the spirit
! of the season. The making of a win
ning team depends largely upon our
attitude. Certain things we can do.
First, all should sign up who are
physically able. Second, we must cut
jout 'crabbing.' We must get together.
| Queening on the bleachers should be
.eliminated, while Freshman 'queen
ing' should be tabooed at all times.
Let everybody get into the rooting
section."

Clean Sportsmanship,
Doctor F. Angel 1, Chairman of the
Faculty Committee on Athletics, said,
among other things: "Now that, the
Sophomores and Freshmen have had
their rush, let both classes get to

sing 'Hlest. Be the Tie That Binds.'

for clean sportsmanship which our
team won in the Northwest. T went
to Vancouver this summer and these
reports were confirmed. This summer
we sent our crew to Poughkeepsie,
and the valuable experience which it
received more than repaid the ex
pense of the trip. More than this, it
. won golden opinions of its conduct.
Our sportsmanship is now regarded

"Wo must start out tonight
to give every man the Stanford
Spirit, that indefinable some
thing that will put light and de
termination into the team. If
we will do this, we will imbue
the team witli the spirit that
can't bclp winning."—Coach

"With our men iti condition,
and the material that we now

more highly in the East than that of
almost any other university. Another
reputation we hold as a priceless heri
tage, and that is for the fine treat
ment of other teams, both by the
players and by the bleachers. We
must cut out 'crabbing' at referees.
Also I hope to see eliminated the
suicidal custom of having a number
of hard-played games in the last two
weeks before the Big Game, which
custom originated in the idea to give
every man a fair chance for the team."
"Fnir Piny."
Student-Adviser K. L. Schaupp, '12,
who was next to mount the table,
urged Freshmen lo learn the proper
attitude toward athletics. After pay
ing a tribute to Captain Cass and
Trainer Moulton, who, he said, gave
us rigid training rules and made them
respected, he declared, "There will be
no question of fair play this year."
"Dad" Moulton, always a favorite at
rallies, received his usual hearty
greeting. After complimenting the
present Freshman class for its
strength, he said: "Stanford must in
crease its athletic activities. With so
many different sports, and only 900

students to draw from, all must take a
hand. We must build for the future.
No trainer can make a winning team
without material."
H. W. Maloney, making his first pub
lic appearance in his new capacity as
Rugby Trainer, was given a cheer
lasting several minutes. He spoke
briefly. "I have always found Stan
ford men to be gentlemen, who love to
play the game and who play it
square. Now get into the game; sign
up if you can whether you know any
thing about rugby or not. Credit for
a rugby team belongs not entirely to
trainers and coaches; every man in
the Student Body plays more than a
minor part in the making of a team."
Ovation to Presley.
Coach George .T. Presley followed,
and made the best talk of hie many
famous ones at Stanford rallies. He
spoke first to the new men: "The
coaches have time to give to every
man who comes out with a willing
and obedient spirit. If you have any
other idea you will save everybody
trouble by not signing up." He paid
further "We are starting out with
three defeats behind us. The ques
tion is not why did these occur, but
how can we remedy matters this sea
son and wipe them out. We have the
two best trainers in the world; Cap
tain Cass is the most willing, conscien
tious, self-sacrificing worker in my
time. He has a squad of veterans to
assist him. But most important of all
is the spirit of the Student Rodv, Sec
ond Team, and Varsity. A Freshman
is apt to pick out an ideal —the athlete,
the debater, the literary man. The
only way to have harmony is for every
fellow to realize that we have not all
been cut out for the same thing. Be
broad-minded,
"We can't wait until the Big Rally
j for our spirit, which will then be only
I superficial, and lacking in that Psycho
logical Something that puts fire into
the team. We must start out tonight
to give every man the Stanford Spirit,
that indefinable something that will
put fight and determination into the
team. Tf we will do this, we will im
bue the team with the spirit that can't

What are you going to do about it?
Let's get together and go to it!"
Cuss is Cheered.
Captain L. Cass, *13, was the last
speaker, and received a cheer loud
and long. He first, explained details
of signing up and of practice, and
concluded: "We don't want men on
the rugby field who are merely there
for the exercise, we want men with
the fight, vim and grit to give all

they've got to beat Berkeley on No
vember ninth."
Immediately after the talk by Cap

i "That Psychological Something" was
in the air last night and struck the
keynote of the rally which opened
the 1912 Rugby season in a way that
few seasons have been inaugurated.
It was the spirit of "That Psycho
ogical Something" which Coach Pres
ey said would send the Cardinal-shirt
ed players irrestibly across the line
for a try. Seldom have the "Vai
sity" and the "Railroad" been barked
out more vociferously from the bottom
of the lungs and the bottom of the
hearts of a gathering representing al
most the entire masculine portion of
the Student Body. For a good eight
minutes the rooters, refusing to be
pacified, yelled a vociferous salute
to Coach Presley, thus eclipsing last
year's record-breaking ovation, which
lasted seven minutes. Similar tributes
were paid to the other speakers.
With reports of the political conven
tions fresh in mind, the rooters adopt
ed a new "steam roller" yell, which,
starting slowly and rythmically, grew
faster and faster, ended in a very
whirlpool of sound when the big
machine had, metaphorically, crushed
the California hopes.
! Ambrose Talks.
I Seven speakers were called upon
during the evening by Yell-leader W.
| S. Wilson, '13. The first of these was
A. W. Ambrose, '13, President of the
Associated Students, who said in part:
("The spirit of tonight shows the spirit
! of the season. The making of a win
ning team depends largely upon our
attitude. Certain things we can do.
First, all should sign up who are
physically able. Second, we must cut
jout 'crabbing.' We must get together.
| Queening on the bleachers should be
.eliminated, while Freshman 'queen
ing' should be tabooed at all times.
Let everybody get into the rooting
section."

Clean Sportsmanship,
Doctor F. Angel 1, Chairman of the
Faculty Committee on Athletics, said,
among other things: "Now that, the
Sophomores and Freshmen have had
their rush, let both classes get to

sing 'Hlest. Be the Tie That Binds.'

1 dwelt at length upon the reputation
for clean sportsmanship which our
team won in the Northwest. T went
to Vancouver this summer and these
reports were confirmed. This summer
we sent our crew to Poughkeepsie,
and the valuable experience which it
received more than repaid the ex
pense of the trip. More than this, it
. won golden opinions of its conduct.
Our sportsmanship is now regarded

"Wo must start out tonight
to give every man the Stanford
Spirit, that indefinable some
thing that will put light and de
termination into the team. If
we will do this, we will imbue
the team witli the spirit that
can't bclp winning."—Coach
George J. Presley.
"With our men iti condition,

more highly in the East than that of
almost any other university. Another
reputation we hold as a priceless heri
tage, and that is for the fine treat
ment of other teams, both by the
players and by the bleachers. We
must cut out 'crabbing' at referees.
Also I hope to see eliminated the
suicidal custom of having a number
of hard-played games in the last two
weeks before the Big Game, which
custom originated in the idea to give
every man a fair chance for the team."
"Fnir Piny."
Student-Adviser K. L. Schaupp, '12,
who was next to mount the table,
urged Freshmen lo learn the proper
attitude toward athletics. After pay
ing a tribute to Captain Cass and
Trainer Moulton, who, he said, gave
us rigid training rules and made them
respected, he declared, "There will be
no question of fair play this year."
"Dad" Moulton, always a favorite at
rallies, received his usual hearty
greeting. After complimenting the
present Freshman class for its
strength, he said: "Stanford must in
crease its athletic activities. With so
many different sports, and only 900

students to draw from, all must take a
hand. We must build for the future.
No trainer can make a winning team
without material."
H. W. Maloney, making his first pub
lic appearance in his new capacity as
Rugby Trainer, was given a cheer
lasting several minutes. He spoke
briefly. "I have always found Stan
ford men to be gentlemen, who love to
play the game and who play it
square. Now get into the game; sign
up if you can whether you know any
thing about rugby or not. Credit for
a rugby team belongs not entirely to
trainers and coaches; every man in
the Student Body plays more than a
minor part in the making of a team."
Ovation to Presley.
Coach George .T. Presley followed,
and made the best talk of hie many
famous ones at Stanford rallies. He
spoke first to the new men: "The
coaches have time to give to every
man who comes out with a willing
and obedient spirit. If you have any
other idea you will save everybody
trouble by not signing up." He paid
further "We are starting out with
three defeats behind us. The ques
tion is not why did these occur, but
how can we remedy matters this sea
son and wipe them out. We have the
two best trainers in the world; Cap
tain Cass is the most willing, conscien
tious, self-sacrificing worker in my
time. He has a squad of veterans to
assist him. But most important of all
is the spirit of the Student Rodv, Sec
ond Team, and Varsity. A Freshman
is apt to pick out an ideal —the athlete,
the debater, the literary man. The
only way to have harmony is for every
fellow to realize that we have not all
been cut out for the same thing. Be
broad-minded,
"We can't wait until the Big Rally
j for our spirit, which will then be only
I superficial, and lacking in that Psycho
logical Something that puts fire into
the team. We must start out tonight
to give every man the Stanford Spirit,
that indefinable something that will
put fight and determination into the
team. Tf we will do this, we will im
bue the team with the spirit that can't
help winning. It's up to you follows.
What are you going to do about it?
Let's get together and go to it!"
Cuss is Cheered.
Captain L. Cass, *13, was the last
speaker, and received a cheer loud
and long. He first, explained details
of signing up and of practice, and
concluded: "We don't want men on
the rugby field who are merely there
for the exercise, we want men with
the fight, vim and grit to give all

they've got to beat Berkeley on No
vember ninth."
Immediately after the talk by Cap
tain Cass, the rugby aspirants signed
cards for the coming season. The
total number enrolled did not reach
the high mark of last year, the figures
\ being 1U3 as compared to 210 in 1911.

many different sports, and only 900

students to draw from, all must take a
hand. We must build for the future.
No trainer can make a winning team
without material."
H. W. Maloney, making his first pub
lic appearance in his new capacity as
Rugby Trainer, was given a cheer
lasting several minutes. He spoke
briefly. "I have always found Stan
ford men to be gentlemen, who love to
play the game and who play it
square. Now get into the game; sign
up if you can whether you know any
thing about rugby or not. Credit for
a rugby team belongs not entirely to
trainers and coaches; every man in
the Student Body plays more than a
minor part in the making of a team."
Ovation to Presley.
Coach George .T. Presley followed,
and made the best talk of hie many
famous ones at Stanford rallies. He
spoke first to the new men: "The
coaches have time to give to every
man who comes out with a willing
and obedient spirit. If you have any
other idea you will save everybody
trouble by not signing up." He paid
further "We are starting out with
three defeats behind us. The ques
tion is not why did these occur, but
how can we remedy matters this sea
son and wipe them out. We have the
two best trainers in the world; Cap
tain Cass is the most willing, conscien

time. He has a squad of veterans to
assist him. But most important of all
is the spirit of the Student Rodv, Sec

Captain L. Cass, *13, was the last

i "That Psychological Something" was
in the air last night and struck the
keynote of the rally which opened
the 1912 Rugby season in a way that
few seasons have been inaugurated.
It was the spirit of "That Psycho
ogical Something" which Coach Pres
ey said would send the Cardinal-shirt
ed players irrestibly across the line
for a try. Seldom have the "Vai
sity" and the "Railroad" been barked
out more vociferously from the bottom
of the lungs and the bottom of the
hearts of a gathering representing al
most the entire masculine portion of
the Student Body. For a good eight
minutes the rooters, refusing to be
pacified, yelled a vociferous salute
to Coach Presley, thus eclipsing last
year's record-breaking ovation, which
lasted seven minutes. Similar tributes
were paid to the other speakers.
With reports of the political conven
tions fresh in mind, the rooters adopt
ed a new "steam roller" yell, which,
starting slowly and rythmically, grew
faster and faster, ended in a very
whirlpool of sound when the big
machine had, metaphorically, crushed
the California hopes.
! Ambrose Talks.
I Seven speakers were called upon
during the evening by Yell-leader W.
| S. Wilson, '13. The first of these was
A. W. Ambrose, '13, President of the
Associated Students, who said in part:
("The spirit of tonight shows the spirit
! of the season. The making of a win
ning team depends largely upon our
attitude. Certain things we can do.
First, all should sign up who are
physically able. Second, we must cut
jout 'crabbing.' We must get together.
| Queening on the bleachers should be
.eliminated, while Freshman 'queen
ing' should be tabooed at all times.
Let everybody get into the rooting
section."
I
Clean Sportsmanship,
Doctor F. Angel 1, Chairman of the
Faculty Committee on Athletics, said,
among other things: "Now that, the
Sophomores and Freshmen have had
their rush, let both classes get to
gether for Stanford. I suggest they
sing 'Hlest. Be the Tie That Binds.'

1 dwelt at length upon the reputation
for clean sportsmanship which our
team won in the Northwest. T went
to Vancouver this summer and these
reports were confirmed. This summer
we sent our crew to Poughkeepsie,
and the valuable experience which it
received more than repaid the ex
pense of the trip. More than this, it
. won golden opinions of its conduct.
Our sportsmanship is now regarded

"Wo must start out tonight
to give every man the Stanford
Spirit, that indefinable some
thing that will put light and de
termination into the team. If
we will do this, we will imbue
the team witli the spirit that
can't bclp winning."—Coach
George J. Presley.
"With our men iti condition,
and the material that we now
have at hand, we have the best
chance to win that we have iiad
in years."—Doctor F. Angcll.

more highly in the East than that of
almost any other university. Another
reputation we hold as a priceless heri
tage, and that is for the fine treat
ment of other teams, both by the
players and by the bleachers. We
must cut out 'crabbing' at referees.
Also I hope to see eliminated the
suicidal custom of having a number
of hard-played games in the last two
weeks before the Big Game, which
custom originated in the idea to give
every man a fair chance for the team."
"Fnir Piny."
Student-Adviser K. L. Schaupp, '12,
who was next to mount the table,
urged Freshmen lo learn the proper
attitude toward athletics. After pay
ing a tribute to Captain Cass and
Trainer Moulton, who, he said, gave
us rigid training rules and made them
respected, he declared, "There will be
no question of fair play this year."
"Dad" Moulton, always a favorite at
rallies, received his usual hearty
greeting. After complimenting the
present Freshman class for its
strength, he said: "Stanford must in
crease its athletic activities. With so
many different sports, and only 900

students to draw from, all must take a
hand. We must build for the future.

further "We are starting out with

i "That Psychological Something" was

the 1912 Rugby season in a way that

ey said would send the Cardinal-shirt

for a try. Seldom have the "Vai

out more vociferously from the bottom

i "That Psychological Something" was
in the air last night and struck the
keynote of the rally which opened
the 1912 Rugby season in a way that
few seasons have been inaugurated.
It was the spirit of "That Psycho
ogical Something" which Coach Pres
ey said would send the Cardinal-shirt
ed players irrestibly across the line
for a try. Seldom have the "Vai
sity" and the "Railroad" been barked
out more vociferously from the bottom
of the lungs and the bottom of the
hearts of a gathering representing al
most the entire masculine portion of
the Student Body. For a good eight
minutes the rooters, refusing to be
pacified, yelled a vociferous salute
to Coach Presley, thus eclipsing last
year's record-breaking ovation, which
lasted seven minutes. Similar tributes
were paid to the other speakers.
With reports of the political conven
tions fresh in mind, the rooters adopt
ed a new "steam roller" yell, which,
starting slowly and rythmically, grew
faster and faster, ended in a very
whirlpool of sound when the big
machine had, metaphorically, crushed
the California hopes.
! Ambrose Talks.
I Seven speakers were called upon
during the evening by Yell-leader W.
| S. Wilson, '13. The first of these was
A. W. Ambrose, '13, President of the
Associated Students, who said in part:
("The spirit of tonight shows the spirit
! of the season. The making of a win
ning team depends largely upon our
attitude. Certain things we can do.
First, all should sign up who are
physically able. Second, we must cut
jout 'crabbing.' We must get together.
| Queening on the bleachers should be
.eliminated, while Freshman 'queen
ing' should be tabooed at all times.
Let everybody get into the rooting
section."
I
Clean Sportsmanship,
Doctor F. Angel 1, Chairman of the
Faculty Committee on Athletics, said,
among other things: "Now that, the
Sophomores and Freshmen have had
their rush, let both classes get to
gether for Stanford. I suggest they
sing 'Hlest. Be the Tie That Binds.'
The last time 1 addressed the students
i
1 dwelt at length upon the reputation
for clean sportsmanship which our
team won in the Northwest. T went
to Vancouver this summer and these
reports were confirmed. This summer
we sent our crew to Poughkeepsie,
and the valuable experience which it
received more than repaid the ex
pense of the trip. More than this, it
. won golden opinions of its conduct.
Our sportsmanship is now regarded

"Wo must start out tonight
to give every man the Stanford
Spirit, that indefinable some
thing that will put light and de
termination into the team. If
we will do this, we will imbue
the team witli the spirit that
can't bclp winning."—Coach
George J. Presley.
"With our men iti condition,
and the material that we now
have at hand, we have the best
chance to win that we have iiad
in years."—Doctor F. Angcll.

more highly in the East than that of
almost any other university. Another
reputation we hold as a priceless heri
tage, and that is for the fine treat
ment of other teams, both by the
players and by the bleachers. We
must cut out 'crabbing' at referees.
Also I hope to see eliminated the
suicidal custom of having a number
of hard-played games in the last two
weeks before the Big Game, which
custom originated in the idea to give
every man a fair chance for the team."
"Fnir Piny."
Student-Adviser K. L. Schaupp, '12,
who was next to mount the table,
urged Freshmen lo learn the proper
attitude toward athletics. After pay
ing a tribute to Captain Cass and
Trainer Moulton, who, he said, gave
us rigid training rules and made them
respected, he declared, "There will be
no question of fair play this year."
"Dad" Moulton, always a favorite at
rallies, received his usual hearty
greeting. After complimenting the
present Freshman class for its
strength, he said: "Stanford must in
crease its athletic activities. With so
many different sports, and only 900

students to draw from, all must take a
hand. We must build for the future.
No trainer can make a winning team
without material."
H. W. Maloney, making his first pub
lic appearance in his new capacity as
Rugby Trainer, was given a cheer
lasting several minutes. He spoke
briefly. "I have always found Stan
ford men to be gentlemen, who love to
play the game and who play it
square. Now get into the game; sign
up if you can whether you know any
thing about rugby or not. Credit for
a rugby team belongs not entirely to
trainers and coaches; every man in
the Student Body plays more than a
minor part in the making of a team."
Ovation to Presley.
Coach George .T. Presley followed,
and made the best talk of hie many
famous ones at Stanford rallies. He
spoke first to the new men: "The
coaches have time to give to every
man who comes out with a willing
and obedient spirit. If you have any
other idea you will save everybody
trouble by not signing up." He paid
further "We are starting out with
three defeats behind us. The ques
tion is not why did these occur, but
how can we remedy matters this sea
son and wipe them out. We have the
two best trainers in the world; Cap
tain Cass is the most willing, conscien
tious, self-sacrificing worker in my
time. He has a squad of veterans to
assist him. But most important of all
is the spirit of the Student Rodv, Sec
ond Team, and Varsity. A Freshman
is apt to pick out an ideal —the athlete,
the debater, the literary man. The
only way to have harmony is for every
fellow to realize that we have not all
been cut out for the same thing. Be
broad-minded,
"We can't wait until the Big Rally
j for our spirit, which will then be only
I superficial, and lacking in that Psycho
logical Something that puts fire into
the team. We must start out tonight
to give every man the Stanford Spirit,
that indefinable something that will
put fight and determination into the
team. Tf we will do this, we will im
bue the team with the spirit that can't
help winning. It's up to you follows.
What are you going to do about it?
Let's get together and go to it!"
Cuss is Cheered.
Captain L. Cass, *13, was the last
speaker, and received a cheer loud
and long. He first, explained details
of signing up and of practice, and
concluded: "We don't want men on
the rugby field who are merely there
for the exercise, we want men with
the fight, vim and grit to give all

they've got to beat Berkeley on No
vember ninth."
Immediately after the talk by Cap
tain Cass, the rugby aspirants signed
cards for the coming season. The
total number enrolled did not reach
the high mark of last year, the figures
\ being 1U3 as compared to 210 in 1911.
The first practice will be held tomor
row afternoon at 3:30 on Stanford
Field. Captain Cass stated that the
