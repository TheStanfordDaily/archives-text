# Botanist Visits Stanford Campus.
## 
### 
Dr. W. A. Cannon, '99, Assistant
Director of the Department of Bo
tanical Research of the Carnegie In
stitute, has just made his annual visit
to the campus. Doctor Cannon spent
the summer in the experimental gar
dens at Carmel, below Monterey,
which the Institute has maintained for
the past few years.
The resort of American botanists to
this garden is increasing and numbers
of Eastern, as well as Western enthu
siasts work there each year.
