# FALL TRACK RALLY TO BE HELD NEXT WEEK.
## Cinder Path Athletes Are to Begin Training Under Direction of "Dud" Moulton. 
### 
Cinder path devote3S are to inau
gurate the fall training season with an
impromptu rally in Encina Clubroom
on next Tuesday evening. Captain
E. P. Campbell, '13, hits announced the
call for men to sign the roll, and work
is to be conducted along the routine
lines. "Dad" Mouiton will devote his
time to the trackmen and is to be
assisted by Captain Campbell and
several of the veterans who will be
at the track on training days.
Those men who have already signed
up for rugby will not be expected to
do track work until after the football
season. With "Dad" devoting all his
attention to the trackmen it is certain
that very beneficial results will be
obtained from this early work.
