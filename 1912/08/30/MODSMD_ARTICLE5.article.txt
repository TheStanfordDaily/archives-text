# Stanford's Coach.

### 
The great ovation accorded to
George J. Presley at the Rally last
evening was a true index

of the high appreciation
that the Student Body

has for their Rugby coach.
This was not shown in that the time of
applause exceeded that of last year's.
The spontaneity or applause on the
appearance of the coach and the swel
ling roar as he rose on the table told
of that. For three years as head
coach he has given unsparingly of
his time to the development of Rugby
here at Stanford. The reputation
which Stanford teams have won for
their sportsmanship and fair play may
be traced to Presley's methods. Stan
ford may well be proud of such a
coach.
