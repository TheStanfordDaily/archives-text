Fall training for the trackmen is to
be formerly ushered into the arena of
activities tomorrow evening with an
informal rally in Encina clubroom.
The time for the initial get-together
of the cinder path athletes has been
set at 7:15. Track captain E. P.
Campbell, '13, has charge of the ar
rangements for the rally. "Dad"
Moulton, Captain Campbell, and one
or two others will adress the men.
Blanks ar'i to be provided for each
man to fill out, giving the events in
which he wishes to enter. Those men
who are already out for rugby will not
be expected to do any work on the
track until after the close of the foot
ball season.
The early work will consist of cross
country running, with the idea of de
veloping distance men. The sprinters
will work on ion the new fifty-yard
turf track which has been constructed
inside the oval.
It is planned to begin the cross
country training along lines followed
out by most of the eastern colleges.
Captain Campbell has been in commu
nication with various track experts
and will have many valuable sugges
tions to offer. The older runners are
to take chart of the runs which aro
to be held three times a week.
"Dad" will be found at the track
training house every morning and af
ternoon to instruct the new men. With
the assistance of the veterans all of
the inexperienced men will be assured
of ample coaching.
Plans for the first annual cross
country run are underway and it is
hoped that several organizations will
offer trophies to be contested for by
the men. The exact date for the race
will not be set until later in the fall.
