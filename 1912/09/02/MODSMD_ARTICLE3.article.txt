# NEW ISOLATION HOSPITAL IS MODEL OF EFFICIENCY
## Institution with Latest of Modern Appliances Will Safeguard University From Possible Epidemic. 
### 
Constructed and equipped with fur
nishings equalled only by the sani
tariums of most recent design, the
, new Isolation Hospital for contagious
cases, built by the Student's Guild on
a site near the University rock
crusher, will be ready to receive
patients in about three weeks.
Thanks to the conscientious efforts
of Professor J. P. Mitchell, of the
i Chemistry department, Charles G.
Lathrop, treasurer of the University,
and members of the Guild Board, it
has been possible to construct a hos
pital for $10,000 second in efficiency
to none of the kind on the coast. The
hospital will be practically paid for
when completed.
For Contagious Cases.
Only when contagious cases arise
will the new hospital be open for the
admission of patients. The building
easily will accommodate 20> patients,
and the arrangement permits segrega
tion of sufferers from two different
kinds of diseases at the same time.
The three acres of hospital property
will provide room for convalescent,
patients to move about in the open
air.
All injuries and maladies not of a
contagious nature will be treated in
the old Peninsular hospital in Palo
Alto as heretofore, under the old ar
rangement of the Guild The primary
purpose ol' the new Isolation Hospital
is to safeguard the campus against
any sort of an epidemic. Consequent
ly, that the quarters may be available
at an instant's notice, no other cases
than those of contagious disease will
be treated there.
Two Story Structure.
The main building is a two-story
frame structure, with the latest and
most modern equipment for fire pro
tection. Tt, stands on three acres,
leased from the University, on the
banks of San Francisquito Creek,
about a mile and a half from the
Quad.

In the rear of the hospital proper,
and connected by fire-proof and germ
proof doors, is a one-story annex,
\vl<\eh encloses the genera! kitchens
and the caretaker's rooms.
The arrangement of the hospital
proper and the annex evidences the
careful designing of the board and well
might be taken as a model for institu
tions of its kind.
On the lower floor of the hospital
are two large wards, to be equipped
with eight beds each, for men ana
women respectively. In the rear of
each ward is a bathroom and lavatory,
an air-tight fumigating chamber and a
diet kitchen for the patients in the two
respective wards. All food will be
cooked in bulk in the general kitchen,
in the annex, and sent through a pass
door to the diet kitchens on the lower
floor. A dumb waiter will carry it to
the second. The bulk food will be
apportioned to meet the respective
needs of the patients by the nurses,
being kept warm in meantime on
olcctric heaters and stoves in the diet
kitchens. The general heating system
is by hot-water radiators. There will
be absolutely no fire or matches in the
hospital proper. Power will be sup
plied for the heaters and lights from
the University power line, which runs
near the hospital.
Between the kitchens of the two
wards and in the rear next to the an
nex, a room with medicine chests and
other equipment has been provided
for the nurses. Call bell cords at
tached to each bed register on an an
nunciator in this room.
Separating the main hospital from
the annex are heavy quarantine doors.
Access may be had to the lovcer floor
or the second floor of the main hos
pital direct from the annex by an
ingenious door arrangement.
\out Annex.
The annex contains a cosy living
room and bed room for the caretaker

and the general kitchen equipped like
the kitchen of a large hotel in point of
| labor-saving devices. Every room in
| the hospital is in communication with
i the others by a telephone system.
The hospital also will have a house
'phone on the campus exchange.
The second floor contains two single
rooms for isolating individual cases
and two rooms for the nurses in at
tendance in the hospital, beside an-
I other large ward, a duplicate of the
I two on the lower floor. The equip
-1 ment as to diet kitchen, etc., is the
j same on the second as on the first.
| floor.
i The $10,000 expenditure, which will
j represent the cost of the building
ready for patients, will provide for the
; new equipment needed in addition to
! that brought from the old hospital and
cottage in Palo Alto. The Guild prop
erty in Palo Alto sold for $5,500, and
together with the Guild receipts will
pay for the hospital. It will not be
necessary for the Guild to contract a
j dollar of indebtedness to pay for the
hospital.
The hospital, at every possible cor- 1
ner, is protected by a two-inch fire
hydrant system. A substantial fire
escape on the front of the hospital
provides a safe exit in case of fire.
"Too much credit cannot be' given
to Professor J. P. Mitchell, of the
Chemistry department, for his labors
in insuring the successful completion
of the hospital," said one of the direc
tors of, ihe Students' Guild today.
"The business experience and know
ledge of existing conditions at Stan
! ford of Professor Mitchell, has made
l possible the prompt and effective man
l ner in which ihe work has been car
ried through. Professor Mitchell de
j voted a large part of his vacation t''
; superintending the actual work of
j construction."
With the new hospital ready for
1 patients, it will be possible to stamp
out a threatened epidemic in its very
| inception, providing a safeguard to
| the University public the importance
jof which scarcely can be overesti- I
i mated. Should cases of virulent dis
ease appear, it will be possible within
an hour or two to remove the danger
of contagion from the 2,000 residents
of the campus and at the same time
| provide the best possible treatment
i for the sufferers.
