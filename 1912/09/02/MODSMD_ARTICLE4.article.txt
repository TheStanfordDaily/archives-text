# RUGBY MEN GO THROUGH PRELIMINARY DRILLS
## MANY VETERANS APPEAR AT THE PRACTICE SATURDAY. Squad Shows Considerable Increase Over Number Signing at Rally Thursday Evening. 
### 
A rather strenuous "light" practice
was the order of the day for nearly
two hundred rugby candidates who ap
peared on the turf Saturday. This
number is considerably greater than
the total of those who signed cards
at the rally Thursday, and probably
equals the record-breaking number
that turned out last fall.
Coach Presley was in charge of the
practice, and was assisted by the
coaching committee. Presley, A.
Frank, '13, and K. L. Schaupp, '12,
handled the forwards, while Captain L.
Cass, '13, E. Kern, '13, and B. E. Erb,
'12, put the backfield through the rudi
mentary steps.
The Varsity veterans who appeared
in togs included Cass, Erb, Kern, Rls
ling, Noble, Harrigan, Thoburn, A. San
born, Schaupp, Frank, Partridge and
Gard. A strong nucleus from last
year's Second Team was in evidence,
while of the 1911 substitutes there ap
peared Templeton and Corbet. The
baby fifteen of a year ago was back
almost en masse, and numerous stars
of the various class teams were out
booting the ball.
The 1916 material looks promising.
While experienced rugby men are in
a mlnc/ity, the field was thickly
sprinkled with preparatory school
stars of the American game, who ap
peared quick to grasp the principles
of the new sport. The players of the
entering class, especially the scrum
candidates, are noticeable in size. The
first Freshman fifteen, which in no
sense included a monopoly of the best
material of the first-year class, was
made up of Wing, Kellogg, and Font,
front rank; Chase and Keast, middle
rank; Wood, Lee and Woodworth, rear
rank; R. Brown, half; Norton, Hahn,
five-eights; Lammiman, center; Graves
and Dingley, wings; and S. S. Brown,
full. Of these men, Lammiman and
Keast are Watsonville stars; Norton
and Bingley played on the fast Palo
Alto fifteen; R. Brown is a Los An
geles halfback, while the other Brown
was fullback for San Jose. Hahn is
also a southern player of note. Other
Freshmen noted in the scramble of
the first day's practice were McAleer,
Gilliland, former member of the All-
Pennsylvania team at the American
game; Cass, brother to the Varsity
skipper and Los Angeles High star;
Harvey, a Phoenix, Arizona, player;
Tufts, a fast man from Lowell High
who formerly wore the Barbarian
Club emblem; and Bubendorf of Palo
Alto.
