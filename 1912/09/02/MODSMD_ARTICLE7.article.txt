# Epidemics.
## 
### 
The Isolation Hospital is an es
tablished reality and the University is
now in a position, for the first time, to
stamp out an epidemic.

This has been a dire
j.i nll,-wi

want long left unfilled.
Even though Stanford has one of the
healthiest localities in the United
States yet we are by no means abso
lutely exempt from epidemics. In
1903 a typhoid epidemic cost several
lives. No longer are we entirely un
prepared to cope with such a situation.
The Isolation Hospital will be ready
for use in three weeks, though an
emergency would open it for patients
in less time, and no better equipped
building for a similar purpose is to be
found in any community of this size in
the United States. When ready for
occupation the building will be the
property of the Guild Board, free from
debt.
That the Isolation Hospital is a
reality is due to the co-operation of
Charles G. Lathrop, Treasurer of the
University, who gave the land for the
building, and Professor J. P. Mitchell,
of the Department of Chemistry, who
gave freely of his time in carying
through the project.
