### 
The banishment of the saloon from
Menlo Park is considered the event of
greatest importance during the college
year of 1910-11, in President David
Starr Jordan's report, given to the pub
lic in pamphlet form about the middle
•112 the summer.
The chief executive has taken up in
detail the fraternity problem of pledg
ing men too early in their college
course, and especially of pledging them
during their high school days. His
proposed remedy for this lies in not
permitting men to live in fraternity
houses until their Sophomore years.
Vocational training is given the
credit for the betterment in the gen
eral scholarship of the institution.
The attendance also received a slight
increase, and the number of degrees
granted was materially larger than
that of the previous year, showing a
tendency toward better scholarship.
In building additions to the Univer
sity, marked advances were made. A
two story concrete building, known
as the Lane Library, was added to the
Medical School in San Francisco, and
on the campus the restoration of the
Memorial Church was begun. Through
a gift of Thomas Welton Stanford, the
damaged wings of the Muoeum will be
repaired.
The students have had the excellent
privilege of listening to eminent
speakers in their own Assembly Hall,
and the first of the "West Lectures"
on Immortality, Human Conduct and
Human Destiny was delivered.
Gifts aggregating $32,500 were re
ceived for the benefit of the Medical
department.
Many changes were made in the
Faculty, most of them with a better
ment to the various departments, al
though some of the vacancies caused
by death and resignation were hard to
fill. Professors from nearly every de
partment in the University made con
tributions to the literary world in text
books or some other form during the
year.
The reports from the several de
partments show an increase of effici
ency throughout the entire University,
and especially in the Department of
Medicine.
The scholarship report shows that
the women are better students than the
men. but it is interesting to note that
places most unfavorable to study tor
men are not necessarily most un
favorable for women, for the best
men students are in Encina Hall,
while the women who commute do
better work than resident and Palo
Alto women.
During the year, the library
realized an increase of 162.432 volumes
at the time of the submitting of the
report. To this can be added 35,000
volumes on the shelves of the Lane
Medical Library.
Conference Nominations Tomorrow.
Men students having fifty or more
hours will meet in the Chapel at 1:10
tomorrow, to nominate members at
large to the Student's Conference.
