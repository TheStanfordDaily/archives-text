# Bulletin Boards.
## 
### 
Last year Bulletin Boards were
erected at certain points of vantage
rt r* w-* rtu a fnv flip nnr-

on the campus tor me yui
pose of disseminating news.
These boards have become
ctorl witVl

so thickly encrustea wuu
placards and notices of events long
since past that the boards themselves
threaten to become extinct. Let us
make a new start here. Sweep the
Bulletin Boards clear of announce
ments. In the future let those who
post announcements see that they are
removed as soon as they become
Inoperative.
