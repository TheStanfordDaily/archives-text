## Doctor Jordan, Professor Krehbiel, and L. L. Hill, II, Study Effects of Civil War on People in the South. 
### 
Working in the
interests of the
World's Peace
Foundation, on the
,pecial mission of
studying the re
suts of the Civil
War on the people,
Dr. David Starr
Jordan, Professor E.

B. Krehbiel, of the History depart
ment, and L. L. Hill, '11, spent the
summer in the southern states. Dr.
Jordan only returned to the campus
the middle of last week, while Pro
fessor Krehbiel proceded him by a few
weeks. Hill is still in the East.
The start of the trip was made on
May 15 last, when Professor Krehbiel
and Hill left Stanford bound for At
lanta, Georgia, via New Orleans and
Mobile. Here they were received by
Governor Brown of that state and
tended a public reception as well as
many other courtesies. From the
start of their work to the very last
the commission was received with the
utmost friendliness by the people and
the press.
Cobb County Visited.
From Atlanta the men went to Mari
etta, the county seat of Cobb county,
named for the family of the famous
baseball player. Here the people
were first interviewed and from them
the commission gathered information
first-hand. Ten days were spent in
going over the county records at
Marietta and in the state library at
Atlanta, but twenty miles away. Al
together a full month was spent in
Cobb county in intensive study.
From here Professor Krehbiel and
Hill went to Fredericksburg, Virginia,
and were joined by Doctor David Starr
Jordan and Professor Ilarvey Jordan,
Professor of Histology at the Univer
sity of Virginia. Dr. Harvey Jordan
made the fourth member of the com
mission and it was through his know
ledge of the people and this section of
the county that much important ma
terial was obtained. In Spotsylvania
county four battlefields were examined
and the study in this county, where
so great a share of the war was

fought, gave much material of value
to the commission.
Professor Krehbiel Leaves.
From here the next step took the
peace workers to Lexington, the capi
tal of Rockbridge county. Here Pro
fessor Krehbiel was forced to leave
the party for New York, where he gave
his part of the Jordan-Krehbiel
International Conciliation course at
the University of Columbia Summer
School.
The remaining members of the
party continued the work in Rock
bridge county until July 18, when they
moved to lower Virginia and North
Carolina, stopping at Richmond and
Petersburg. Wake county in North
Carolina and Knox county in Ten
nessee furnished material for study
until the early part of August. Dr.
David Starr Jordan made a personal
visit into Kentucky and gathered the
only material from this state.
Work Not Finished.
Each member of this commission
took notes of his study and all are to
be turned over to Professor Krehbiel
for compiling at a later date. The
work brought out nothing of a sensa
tional nature and is at present far
from being finished. Extensive corres
pondence and more personal work in
the same field will be necessary before
the work is completed.
Dr. Jordan is Chief Director of the
World's Peace Foundation, while Pro
fessor Krehbiel is a member of the
Advisory Board. L. L. Hill, '11, acted
in the capacity of secretary to the
expedition.
Story Told on Hill.
A good story is told on Hill when
working in Rockbridge county at
Buenavista. The commission was
about to leave for Appomatix when
Hill decided to interview an old Con
federate veteran some miles out of
town. When telling his story the
southerner became so affected by the
memories that be fell to weeping and
this so moved Hill that he lingered
with the old gentleman all afternoon
and missed the train that took the
other members of his party to the
"Sunset of the Confederacy,"â€”the Ap
pomatix Courthouse.
