In another column of this paper we
give an account of the summer trip
conducted by President

David Starr Jordan to
gather information fop

the campaign now being waged against
war. The World Peace agitation is
assuming greater proportions every
year and Stanford, through the efforts
of its president, is the first University
in the land to offer a course in "In
ternational Conciliation.' Stanioid is
fortunate in having such a man at its
head to guide the destinies of the Uni
versity.
