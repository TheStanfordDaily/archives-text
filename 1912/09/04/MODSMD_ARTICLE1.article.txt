# TRACK ATHLETES RESPOND TO CALL FOR CANDIDATES
## ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-ONE READY TO RUN. Cross-Country Event is Popular With Fall Cinder Path Athletes. 
### 
Responding to the call for candi-1
dates and with the necessity for co- j
operation voiced by every speaker,
Stanford trackmen inaugurated what
will undoubtedly prove the greatest,
fall training season in the history of j
the University, last evening, in Encina
clubrooni when one hundred and
twenty-one men signed up for work.
The rally surpassed all previous fall
openings both in point of attendance
and in the spirit manifested by
speakers and listeners.
Captain E. P. Campbell, '13, was in |
charge of the rally and urged every
man to come out for some event. The
Cardinal track leader explained the
nature of the work which is to con
stitute the early work and dwelt upon
the necessity of getting into condi
tion and in helping the team by swell
ing the ranks of those trying for
places.
M l)ad" Talks.
From the reception that was given
"Dad" when he took his place on the
historic speaker's table, it was evident
that the appeal of the Stanford trainer
for everyone to sign up would not be
without results. Urging the men to
come out in goodly numbers, he show
ed how much more could be accom
plished than if only a few signed up.
"Ninety-five men will make the team
which faces California. In the meets
with outside teams 110 limit is to be
placed on the number who will be
allowed to compete."
"If the available men who are now ,
registered will come out and will keep
out of scholarship difficulties, we will
clean up Berkeley," predicted "Dad." i
Hagerman Pledges Support.
J. P. Hagerman, secretary of the
Y. M. C. A., and former champion
hurdler, pledged his support to the i
trackmen and offered to aid in the
coaching. The speaker showed the
men that it was necessary for all to
get out and give their best service.
"There is nothing so satisfactory as
whipping a man in his own back yard,"
said assistant trainer H. W. Maloney.
"What Stanford must do is to build
for the future and no man has ever
succeeded unless he first tried."
R. L. Murray, '13, and J. W. Dodge,
'13, two of the most active men in the
movement for cross-country work,
urged every one to sign up, whether
they had ever worn spikes before or
not.
Cross-Country is Popular.
Of those who signed last evening
sixty signified their intention to do
cross-country work. The sprints were
next in order of popularity with a total
of twenty-four. The number who,
signed up far exceeds the marks of
former fall training seasons.
The cross-country men are to meet
every Monday, Wednesday and Friday
at 4:45 at the track training house.
The first run was held this afternoon
under the direction of Murray and
Dodge.
