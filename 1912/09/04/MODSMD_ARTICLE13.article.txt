# Vandalism.
## 
### 
The grounds surrounding the Univer
sity, form, with their trees, shrubs and
flower gardens, the finest background

of any institution of
learning in the New

World. Furthermore, it
is the background of the most pic
turesque university in the Western
Hemisphere. These features we most
jealously treasure. Now the edict has
gone forth to strip one of the roads
leading to the Stanford residence of its
beautiful eucalypti. Today one side
of that roadway has been robbed of its
proud row of trees and the other
awaits the woodman's axe. Someone
must have erred in giving out this
order or else taken too much authority
into their own hands. Let us see an
end to such ruthless destruction.
