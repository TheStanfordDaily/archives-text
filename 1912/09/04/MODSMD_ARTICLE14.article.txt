# RUGBY CANDIDATES IN FIRST PRACTICE GAMES.
## 
### 
In the first practice games of the
season, the coaching committee yester
day put the big squad of rugby aspir
ants through their paces. Calisthenics
were omitted for short, snappy games
on the turf. Though regular line-ups
had been posted by the committee, it
was found necessary to make so many
changes that the teams, as they came
on the field, in no way represented the
strength of their classes.
In the first set-to the Sophomores
bested the Senior combination by one
try. The Juniors scored once on the
"Grays" in the best game of the after
noon. Then the first and second Fresh
man teams were given an opportunity
to try out each other, and with the
substitutes game immediately after,
the ball was kept on the move until
the close of practice.
