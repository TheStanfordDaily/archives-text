### 
"Wisdom consists in knowing what
to do next. Virtue is doing it." These
were Dr. Jordan's welcoming words to
the women of the entering class in his
talk on "Religion in the College Life"
yesterday afternoon.

The essential thought in this first
talk of the President was the plea for
the broad-minded college woman. He
urged upon those especially who were
entering the University for the first
time to plan for all-around develop
ment, thus fitting themselves for life
as well as professionalism.

This was the first meeting of the
Young Women's Christian Association
for the year, and about one hundred
and fifty new students and old filled
the Chapel.
