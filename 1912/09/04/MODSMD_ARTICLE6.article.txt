# SPIKE SLIDES DOWN CANINE SOCIAL SCALE AFTER FIERCE FIGHT
## 
### 
Weltering in gore, crestfallen, with
an air of Napoleonic resignation
marking the droop of his aristo
cratic tail, Spike, the hitherto un
vanquished ruler of the campus
canines, retired from a carnivorous
Waterloo late Tuesday afternoon to
the seclusion of his own reflections
on the bitterness of old age. The
contest opened to the music of fem
inine. shrieks and male chortlings
as the popular hero closed with a
massive black collie. From the be
ginning Spike was out-maneuvred
and save for the intervention of
human hands would have been
routed immediately. One last des
perate charge closed the combat
with well-nigh the complete anni
hilation of the loyal Spike.
