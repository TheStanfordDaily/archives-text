# UNIVERSITY CONFERENCE NOMINATIONS POSTPONED.
## 
### 
The meetings for the nomination of
students at large to the University
Conference which was scheduled for
this afternoon was postponed to a later
date. This course was necessitated
because an eligible list of voters
could not be obtained from the
Registrar's Office until the files for
the "Bawl-Out" have been completed.
For the purpose of organizing the
machinery for student control, the
members of the University Conference
will hold a meeting the middle of next
week. Work for (he coming semester
will be discussed and the regular rou
tine business transacted. A date also
will be set for the Conference nomina
tions.
