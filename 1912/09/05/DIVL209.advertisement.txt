See San Francisco First
DON'T DECIDE HASTILY on your selection of a Fall
suit, for you might gain the Impression that the
padded shoulder and the inflated chest in coats are
still worn by MEN.
Don't think because everybody else is incorrectly
dressed, that you should blindly folow. Come up to see us
and we'll show you what New York is wearing.
If, by dressing correctly and in good taste, the atten
tion of the rough necks is attracted to your English Model
Suit, you will have the satisfaction of knowing that every
body will be wearing them next season.
