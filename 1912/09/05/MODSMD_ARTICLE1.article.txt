# RUGBY SCHEDULE WILL PROVIDE FAST GAMES
## MANAGER BURBANK ANNOUNCES SEASON'S CONTESTS. Varsity and Freshmen Will Battle With Strong Fifteens Before Intercollegiate. 
### 
To the rooters the 1912 rugby season
will be officially opened next Saturday
when the Freshman fifteen meets the
team from Lowell High School. From
then until October 12, the 1916 men
will play every Wednesday and Satur
day, concluding their season with the
game with Oakland High School on
that date.
The Varsity schedule as announced
by Manager Burbank, promises to give
the Cardinal followers the best series
of games that have been witnessed in
many years. The Varsity's first real
same will be against the Barbarians
on September 14, although there will
be a practice line-up between the
Blacks and Grays this week-end. The
customary number of games have been
arranged with the Barbs and the
Olympics, but as these teams have
been greatly strengthened by the ad
dition of many old Stanford and Cali
fornia players they should prove to
be even better contests than those in
the past.
The real practice-season feature will
be the games with the Australians on
October 12 and 16. The Antipodeans
comprise one of the fastest teams in
the world and their visit will be of
exceptional interest to all rugby fol
lowers on the coast as well as of in
valuable service in showing the team
the fine points of rugby.
Following the hard games with the
foreigners the seige of training will
lie broken up by a trip to Los Angeles,
where the University of Southern Cali
fornia will be the opponents. On the
same day, October 19, the Santa Clara
fifteen will play the second team here.
Upon their return from the south,
the Varsity will engage in two contests
with Vancouver, which will be follow
ed a week later by a game with the
Olympic Club. This will be the last
practice game of the season and the
next week, November 9, will witness
the Big Game with California, which,
in the regular alternation of events,
will lie played at Berkeley this year.
