# The 						Assembly.
## 
### 
Tomorrow morning, during the
11:15 hour, all classes will be sus
pended for a welcoming Assembly to

President David Stan-
Jordan. The Stanford
undergraduates have too
few opportunities to listen

to an address from their President, and
every student should be present at this
opening Assembly. What Dr. Jordan
has to say is well worth hearing.
