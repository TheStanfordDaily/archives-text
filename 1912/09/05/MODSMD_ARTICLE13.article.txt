# Freshmen.
## 
### 
The Freshmen held their first class
meeting today for the purpose of

organizing. Instead of
making any headway in
this, certain members of

the class took the opportunity to stop
all proceedings by a noisy "prep,
school" demonstration. In conse
quence, another meeting will have to
be called next week for the first-year
men to organize. It is time that the
Freshmen learned that such tatics are
not tolerated at Stanford.
