11l contradistinction to the spirit of
the first Freshmen Class meeting was

that of the meeting
of the first-year de
baters last evening.

The earnestness which they showed
in signing up for the fall forensic ac
tivities was highly commendable. De
bating at Stanford needs boosting and
we are glad to see the new men getting
behind the movement. Last year the
first-year men defeated the Sophomore
debaters. This year the Freshmen
seem to have the same feat in mind.
