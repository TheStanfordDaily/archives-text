'11, H. J. Packard, '11.

last July. Word was received from
Corinto, where they landed, that on j
account of the unsettled political con
ditions, their trip to the mines would
have to be made in a round-about way, !
taking probably three or four days;
longer than the ordinary conditions J
would necessitate. All communication
with the interior of Nicaragua has
been cut off for the present, and
nothing further has been heard from
them.

ing one of the company's large mines, j
