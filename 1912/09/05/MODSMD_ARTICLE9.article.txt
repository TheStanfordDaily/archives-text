It was moved, second, and passed,
that the necessary amount of money,
approximating $600.00, be loaned to
the Eating Clubs Committee, on terms
to be arranged by the Graduate
Manager.
It was the sense of the Committee
that the entire charge of the rubbers
be turned over to Trainer Maloney.
Adjourned.
