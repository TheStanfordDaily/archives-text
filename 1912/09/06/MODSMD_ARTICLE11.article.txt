# "Queening."
## 
### 
At the Football Rally, a week ago,
two speakers made the plea that

"queening" to the games
be tabooed this year.
The point was well

taken. Every student in the Univer
sity should be in the "rooting" sec
tion, unless he is on the field, and join
in the songs and yells. That is the
way he can support the team. There
are plenty of other opoprtunities to
"queen" at Stanford. Attend the
games as a "rooter."
