# SHEEP GRAZING ON THE ESTATE PROVES SUCCESS.
## Many Improvements on the University Property Have Been Made During Past Summer. 
### 
Encouraged by the successful ven
ture of grazing sheep on University
property, plans have been made for
continuing this practice on a greater
scale during the coining year.
During the past season some five
hundred sheep grazed on the grounds
and it is planned to increase this
number by about one half. A small
number of cattle are now pastured
and with the completion of more
fences the number will be enlarged.
An ornamental concrete and wire
fence has been built along the north
side of the main drive leading to Palo
Alto, while a corresponding fence is
now being built on the opposite side
of the street.
Much repair work on the farm build
ings has been done during the sum
mer, with the result that this part of
the estate is in better shape than for
a number of years. All of this work
has been done under the personal
supervision of .T. E. Houston, super
intendent of the estate.
The University nursery has been en
larged and a greater variety of flowers
and plants put in. It is planned to
furnish decorations and greens to the
college organizations 011 a larger scale
this year than at any time heretofore.
