# PRESIDENT JORDAN WELCOMES WITH MUCH SAPIENT COUNSEL
## President, Assisted by the Student Adviser, Extends Hearty Greeting in First Assembly of Semester. 
### 
Sparkling with ready wit and humor,
President Jordan's welcoming address
to the students in the first Assembly
of the semester this morning, might as
well have been his first of twenty-one
. years ago, as far as any shading of
, import goes. His first could have been
■ no less hearty than his last.
President Jordan was ably assisted
,in extending the general greeting by
Student Adviser Karl Schaupp, who
addressed the assembly from the point
of view of an active member of the
Student Body.
"My duty here is first to welcome
! you all back and to extend to you the
glad hand and good advice," said
| President Jordan. "Good advice is al-
I ways so easy to give and often so hard
to take. The more you take of good
advice the more capable you will be to
give it.
"There are two kinds of univer
sities, each growing more and more
unlike each year. The state is fur
nishing more and more money to the
state university and it is steadily
growing larger. The private univer
sity will never grow so large and
never be controlled by the state.
Private Universities.
"We are a private university and as
long as we do what is right we do not
have to ask anything of anybody.
Therefore it is necessary for us to
set a standard of doing things right.
I Stanford, like other private institu-
I tions, has had to watch the state uni
| versities grow beyond her in size.
,The University used to be seventh in
! size, but now I believe it is twenty
third. As to quality, I would not say
more than it would be higher than
'twenty-third."
"I want to convey a special welcome
first to the Old Guard, the men who
I were here when the university was
I opened," continued President Jordan.
i "They have given the character and

tone of an institution of study to Stan
ford. We have to thank them for
making it democratic.
"Thanks to influence of these early
Stanford men, our graduates in the
business world have the reputation that
they will 'stand hitched,' that is, that
they can be trusted to do what is laid
down for them to do. Of the original
twenty of the class, only eleven are
with us yet.
"I am happy to welcome the mem
bers of the faculty. Half their busi
ness is to know the men well outside
of class. If you don't get to know
them well outside of class you are
missing the best there is for you.
"The old students I welcome back to
their work. We should all work for
the joy of working. The old students
are here for culture and training. If
your business in the university is not
real—if you are not working because
you like it—you should go home. It is
unhealthy to rest before you are
twenty-five."
Stanford's Motto.
"The motto of this university is that
'in the matter of scholarship the pro
fessor should be* as severe as he can
be and be just,'" affirmed President
Jordan.
"The matter of control has been
turned over to you, the students. Le
high University is the only other insti
tution of the kind that has control in
the exact sense, which includes the
power to exclude those who are not
following the precepts of good univer
sity men.
"The Freshmen are especially wel
come. They seem to be a husky
crowd; the Sophomores tell me so.
They come from good stock and good
schools, this the registrar tells me.
"In the matter of honor I want you,
the Freshmen, to be clean, honorable
Stanford men. Follow the training of
the democracy and square-dealing here
and each of you will be the 'master of
thy fate' and the 'captain of thy soul.' "
President Jordan introduced Student
Adviser Schaupp as a man "who re
cently had gone through the mill."
"The President told me when I took
the office of Student Adviser that he
didn't know what my duties were, and
Roth didn't know after three years of
service," said Student Adviser Schaupp.
"President Jordan said that my posi
tion was what I made it, but I would
rather put it up to you to make it for
me. The men of Stanford are going
beyond mere today. It rests with you
largely what the future Stanford will
be. Stanford students can't reach high
positions after they leave the univer
sity without reflecting glory on Stan
ford and you undergraduates can't
disgrace yourselves and your families
without reflecting discredit on your
university.
"President Eliot said that imagina
tion was the greatest thing a man
could have. Use yours and find things
to accomplish and bring honor to your
selves and your university."
"Don't follow a man because he is
of the rah-rah type or unusually con
spicuous," continued Schaupp. "Such
a man is not usually the kind of man
that ought to be conspicuous. Every
man of you might make a Phi Beta
Kappa key or a Varsity 'S' if you try
hard enough. But if you are going
after them simply for the insignia

themselves and not for the love of
the game, you are not following the
ideals of the university and you had
better not try.
"The older students are back to take
ill) Student Control where they dropped
it. The faculty has confidence in the
student body. Now is the 'Golden Age'
of Stanford, as President Jordan calls
it, or the Age of Confidence. We must
start the Freshmen right, that they
may guide the big ship of Student Con
trol on a true course.
"This year we are facing is going
to mark its success; we won't take
up anything that spells Failure. Let's
make a banner year of this then. As
an alumnus once put it: 'Let us have
no one go to hell at such an ideal
place as Stanford.' "
