# FRESHMEN WIN THEIR FIRST RUGBY MATCH
## TWO VIGOROUS GAMES PLEASE BLEACHERITES. Grays Defeat Blacks in Best Played Contest of Afternoon—Varsity Men Kept Out of Play. 
### 
The opening football matinee of the
season found the attention of the
rooters partially distracted from the
yell-leader tryout comedy in the
bleachers by some very good early
season rugby on the turf. In a game
which, though calling forth flashes of
excellent individual work, was marked
by looseness of play on both sides, the
Stanford Freshmen defeated the
Ivowell High fifteen by a 6-3 score.
On the heels of this contest came a
much finer and more clean-cut exhibi
tion of rugby, at the close of which
the Grays had piled up a score of 32
against the Blacks, while the terri
tory back of their own goal line had
not been visited once by the ball.
The Freshman fifteen which took
the field at the opening of the first
game was particularly noticeable for
its huskiness. Its playing ability was
probably all that could be expected at
this stage of the season, though lin
gering traces of early training in the
American sport were everywhere in
evidence.
The Freshman Game.
The first try in this contest came as
a result of a pretty piece of work
when, after a long run by Urban a
passing rush, Urban. Norton, Dingley,
sent the latter across. These three
players were always in evidence in the
best plays of the backfield. Dingley
failed to convert this try. Early in
the second half Lowell tied the score
by a field goal on a free kick. At this
time the high school boys were on
aggressive; during much of the time
they played a gritty defensive game,
with Brown starring in good boots and
runs. Another try, unconverted, soon
raised the figures on the Stanford side
of the score-board.
Many Freshman substitutes were
sent in. and these men, though lighter,
did not suffer greatly in point of play
ing ability by comparison with the
"first team. The teams lined up as
follows:
Stanford Freshmen —McAleer (Haw
ley. Cuzner), Stephenson (Eaton, Har
vey), Butterfield (Kellogg, King), Du
bendorf (Bandini, Curtis), Braden

ray (Wood. Finch), forwards; Brown
(McCall, Hamlin), half; Norton (Mc-
Crav, Phillips), Adams (Tufts, Hough
ton), fives; Laine (Lammiman, Bart
lett), center; Dingley (Blecker,
Graves), Urban (Wickersham, Taylor),
wings; Brown (Edwards, Holliston),
full.
Lowell High School—Robles, Bell
(captain), Tissot, Deaho, Deane, Creig.

half; Taufenbach, Hooper, fives;
Brown, center; Huntington. Rogers,
wings; Jones, full.
Grays vs. Blacks.
This game was well-contested from
start to finish by the two shifts of men
who were used on both sides. Var
sity veterans were kept out and op
portunity was given for a number of
younger players to distinguish them
selves. Among those who showed to
very good advantage were Wynne, E. j
Clark, Burns, A. Erb, Knight, Sim, j
King and Halm. The Gray backfield '•
figured in a number or passing rushes
that brought applause from the stands.
Shortly after the first kick-off, |
Knight, by leaping into the air, inter
cepted a cross-kick and sprinted from
his 45 for a try. Lull failed to con- j
vert. For the rest of the game the
ball was most of the time in Black
territory, and the Gray fifteen piled
up a total of 32 points. Towards the
last of the game the Gray backs, while
continually threatening the Black line,
prevented themselves from scoring
several trys by forward passes and
knock-ons.
The line-ups were:
Grays—Skinner (Single), Bly (Fyfe),
Sinclair (Franceschi), .Tacomini (Clo
ver), Button (J. Harrigan), Darsie
(Robb), Lull (Swanson), Thoburn
(McCready), forwards; Burns (Clark),
half; King (A. Erb), Sim (Andrews),
fives; Davis (Cookson), center; Knight
