# GUESS WHO IS FIERCELY BATTLING FOR THE LORD?
## 
### 
Battling for the Lord at Armageddon
is what L. L. Hill, '11, is at present
doing under the pay of the National
Progressive Party at Chicago.
Hill accompanied Dr. David Stan-
Jordan and Professor Krehbiel on
their trip through the southern states
during the past summer as secretary.
Since this time he has been in New
York and there gave up a position on
the "New York Sun" to work for the
Progressive party.
Hill is working under Medill Mc-
Cormick and is busy with political
literature. At present he is con
densing the party platform, Colonel
Roosevelt's Confession of Faith, and
Senator Beverage's speech for a folder
which is to be mailed as a postcard all
over the United States.
