1916 will meet 1915 on the turf
Jtomorro wafternoon in the initial con-

, test of the annual series for interclass
( rugby supremacy. The Junior-Senior
I struggle is set for Thursday ol this
week, and the winners will meet on
the following Thursday.
A group of twenty players, including
, veterans of Varsity teams and a few
other picked men. will he declared in
' eligible for this series. Thus a surer
' test of the rugby ability of the rival
j classes will be furnished. This system
was first tried last year, and proved a
decided improvement over that in
vogue in former seasons, when two or
three Varsity stars were able to turn
the tide of battle in favor of inferior
teams.
The game tomorrow should prove
interesting, since there is no lack of
excellent rugby material in the two
underclasses. The 19ir> team was able
I to hold the 1911 warriors to a score of
three points in a vigorous game last
year. The greater experience of the
Sophomores, with the increased confi-

I dence and team-work which goes with
it, will undoubtedly he a hard handi
cap for the Freshmen to overcome.
The game tomorrow will he called
,at 4 30. A season ticket or a two-bit
| piece will pacify the gate-keeper.
