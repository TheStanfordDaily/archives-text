# BLASTING RESULTS OF CIVIL WAR DESCRIBED.
## Dr. Jordan and Professor krehbiel Address Large Audience in Assembly Hall.

"War may he inevitable, but it is
never good. We have reached this
conclusion after deep investigation,"
said Dr. David Starr Jordan at the
close of his lecture last night on "The
Effect of the Civil War on the South."
An audience of more than three hun
dred people were convinced of this
fact by the straight-forward narrative
of Dr. Jordan and Professor E. R
Krehbiel of their trip in the South this
summer in the interests of the World's
Peace Foundation. I. M. Akohashi, '12,
President of the Cosmopolitan Club,
introduced the speakers as "advancers
of our Club's ideals, the promotion of
friendship among nations."
"We have found nothing startling,
nothing sensational; we have prepared
no mass of statistical data. We have
proved what we already knew, that no
moral question can he settled by the
force of arms, that political issues are
decided in battle only by a most gigan
tic sacrifice," said Dr. Jordan in intro
ducing his subject.
The Stanford President outlined the
military spirit rampant in the North
and South before the conflict, the de
sire for cheap glory that followed on
the Mexican War. A resume of the
political and social conditions that pre
vailed preceded the speaker's lucid ac
count of the principal campaigns of
the Rebellion. He described the class
of men who were lost in the battles,
the best men socially and physically,
the Flower of the South. The best
stock of the nation was annihilated,
and the propagation of the poorer
stocks followed.
"It was one of the most gigantic
struggles in the world's history, and
has been described as the most hu
mane war ever fought, yet we know
General Sherman's terse characteriza
tion of its qualities. It was one of
the great calamities in the history of
the world and the South has not yet
recovered from the blasting effects
sociologically."
Professor Krehbiel then took up the
story, describing the method of pro
cedure in investigating records and in
terviewing people.
"We found it a great problem," he
said, "to talk with people on their own
degeneracy. We studied the problem
from the social, economic, religious,
educational, and sanitary view-points.
The conclusion of our investigation
showed that there was an unbalancing
of power in the South following the
war, from the more desirable element
to less capable men."
