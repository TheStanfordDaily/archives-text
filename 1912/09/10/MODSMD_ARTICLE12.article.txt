# CAMPUS IS NOW ELIGIBLE FOR MAIL CARRIER SERVICE.
## 
### 
A new figure may soon be seen on
llu* campus in the form of a regular
postman, who will make two deliveries
and two collections around the Univer
sity daily. The Stanford University
postoftice during llie liscal year which
ended June 30th transacted $10.301
worth of business, thus entitling ilieiu
to carrier service on the campus.
The sum of $10,000 in fiscal business
entitles a post-office to carrier ser
vice, iiud an application is now being
acted on by the post office authorities.
