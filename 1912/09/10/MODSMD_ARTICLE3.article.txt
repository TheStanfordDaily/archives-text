# HOOVER ON GROUND TO BOOST STANFORD UNION
## COLLECTORS WILL SOLICIT ALL UNPAID PLEDGES. Construction Will be Begun When Substantial Financial Foundation is Laid. 
### 
With H. C. Hoover, '95, the "Father
of the Stanford Union," on the ground
to see the project he has fostered for
many years carried into speedy execu
tion, the construction of a clubhouse
for Stanford merely is a matter of
time.
Hoover recently returned to San
Francisco from London, England,
where for several years he has been
laboring on mining engineering pro
jects. One of the very first things he
did after reaching the coast on his
return from Europe was to call a
meeting of the officials of the Union
here on the campus.
Definite plans were formulated at I
a meeting last Friday in the office of i
Professor C. D. Marx, vice-president j
of th Union, to pave the way for the j
beginning of construction work.
Everett W. Smith. '95. General Sec
retary for the Union on the campus,
reports that the sum of $21,000 in
actual cash is in the treasury of
the Union, and that pledges still un
paid will swell this sum to nearly
$50,000, the approximate cost of the
building as originally planned.
The minimum sum in actual cash j
with which it will lie safe to start j
work on the buildings is $25,000, the '
sum the original plan called for as a '
starter. However, President Hoover,
who personally financed the early
part of the collections, and other
officials of the Union have agreed that
to start the Union on a sound finan
cial basis, more cash would be actually
in hand before construction begins.
Pledges to he Collected.
To this end, President Hoover pre
sented a plan to the officials of the
Union to devote the next two or three
months to collecting Ihe pledges and
I get the actual cash in hand to begin
I work. Hy that time the collectors
should have well over $25,000 in hand.
Once those who have promised the
money bring it around, the building
will be carried through to a speedy
completion, without the possibility of
delay should a start lie made without
sufficient funds to expedite the work.
The earlier the pledges are paid, the
sooner the building will begin.
Hoover Promises Time.
President Hoover, to whom the i
Union project is due, points to the
absolute necessity of opening the <
Union free from debt. The source of i
income of the Union when completed I
will be very small. As many men have I
life privileges in the Union, and |
the assessment on undergraduates will i
have to be a minimum in order to *
make it thoroughly democratic, the (
success of the Union depends on it t
being established on a sound financial
basis. I >
While the collections are being (
made, no time will be wasted. Wil-'j
liam Knowles, '9f>, architect of the j
Eating Clubs, has promised to set to ' |
work immediately drawing prelimin- 1
ary sketches of the Union. t
Under the direction of President \
Hoover, he will draw a set of prelim- c
