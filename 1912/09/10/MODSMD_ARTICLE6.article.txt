# CROSS-COUNTRY RUNNING PROVES TO BE POPULAR.
## Many More Men Appear For the First Run Than Originally Signed-up. 
### 
Exceeding the fondest hopes of the
most enthusiastic organizers of the
cross-country movement, the training
over hill and dale has brought out
i more men for work than signed up at
; the initial rally last week. Sixty
| eight runners were out yesterday af
ternoon under the direction of R. L.
I Murray, '13, and W. Dodge, '13. The
course covered was about three miles.
The men were taken over the run at
a fast gait so that it might lie possible
to size up the candidates preparatory
to dividing them into groups.
Hereafter the leaders will not set
so fast a pace as it is not deemed wise
to indulge in too strenuous training
this early in the season. Within the
next few days several divisions are to
be made in the squad so that, the men
will be classed according to their pre
j vious experience and ability.
"Dad" has been more than pleased
with the manner in which the track
men have responded and is becoming
more enthusiastic daily. The incom
ing class numbers an unusually large
list of crack athletes among its ranks.
The fall training of last year re
sulted in the development of three
men who were point-winners in the
Intercollegiate Meet and with the work
carried on more earnestly this season
much improvement is certain to be
evidenced in the distance running next
spring.
