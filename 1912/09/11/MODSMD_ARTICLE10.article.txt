# The
						Band.

### 
One of the most popular features of
the Assembly this morning was the

musical program rendered by
the Stanford Band. Their
playing was excellent. Stan
ford certainly has a band that

is not excelled by any college band in
the United States. There is one fault,
however, that we can find with them.
They confine their playing too much to
behind clnsed doors. Let ns have
some more of those Sunday afternoon
concerts on the Quad. The weather is
just about prime now for such affairs.
