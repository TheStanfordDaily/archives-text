# 1915 WALLOPS 1916 IN A STRENUOUS GAME
## SOPHOMORE TEAM OUTCLASSES FRESHMAN PLAYERS. Second Year Men Score 13 Points in Second Half by Clever Rushes. 
### 
in a strenuous exhibition of rugby,
191." 1916 by a 21-H score on the
turf yesterday afternoon. With the
Freshmen fighting against the heavy
handicap of superior experience ana
knowledge of the game, and the
Sophomores struggling equally hard
to pile up an overwhelming score, a
scrappy contest resulted which pleased
the bleachers. The play, though at
titne.s producing flashes of good rugby,
was often very loose, and when at
periods of the game the Freshmen fail
ed to show a great amount of fight it
sank to mediocrity.
Scores.
The first try came in three minutes
of play, when Brown caught a punt
and was downed in his tracks, a five
yard scrum resulting. The ball was
shoved over in the scrum, and A. Erb
converted. After the next kick-off
loose fighting in midfield ensued, till
the Freshmen dribbled through to
Hutchinson, who responded with a
good thirty-yard boot to touch. The
Freshmen, especially Braden, were
then displaying some excellent drib
bling, and Thoburn twice prevented
good gains by doubling up over the
ball. From midfield, a passing rush,
Erb to Davis to Thoburn, netted a
good gain. Thoburn negotiating ten
yards of it by his dodging run. From
a five yard scrum another try was
added to the Sophomore total, Erb
failing of conversion. Sophomores 8,
Freshmen 0.
From an eiKht. yard lineout Sinclair
went over for the next score, Erb add
ing two. Time was called with the
ball in midfield.
Second Hull'.
Early in the next half. Urban, catch
lug a punt, figured in a pretty dodging
nri of 1" yards to the Sophomore HO.
.'.lte;' dribbling rush and run by
Clark the ball was on the Freshman
■>. whence .lacomini dove through in
old game style for a try. Erb failed
to convert. One minute later E.
Clark sprinted five yards for a try and
Erb boote:l a goal. Sophomores 21,
Freshmen 0.
The Freshmen had the empty honor
of scoring last. Hutchinson saved
when the Freshmen dribbled over, and
Laine catching a cross-kick went
across. Dingley's boot for conversion
struck the goal-post.
The Sophomore team clearly out
classed that of the Freshmen. This is
partially explained by the fact that the
baby players have scarcely had suffi
cient time to learn the game. Among
tin- players who showed to advantage
were A. Erb. Sinclair, Dinelev, Urban,
I,nine, and Braden.
The line-ups were:
Sophomores—Sinclair, More, Wor
thy, Jacomini, Wright. Rehm, Thor
hurii, Ogden, forwards: Clark, half:
Erb, Roth, fives: Davis, center three:
Wynne, Thoburn, winprs: T-Tutchinsoii,

in a strenuous exhibition of rugby,
191." 1916 by a 21-H score on the
turf yesterday afternoon. With the
Freshmen fighting against the heavy
handicap of superior experience ana
knowledge of the game, and the
Sophomores struggling equally hard
to pile up an overwhelming score, a
scrappy contest resulted which pleased
the bleachers. The play, though at
titne.s producing flashes of good rugby,
was often very loose, and when at
periods of the game the Freshmen fail
ed to show a great amount of fight it
sank to mediocrity.
Scores.
The first try came in three minutes
of play, when Brown caught a punt
and was downed in his tracks, a five
yard scrum resulting. The ball was
shoved over in the scrum, and A. Erb
converted. After the next kick-off
loose fighting in midfield ensued, till
the Freshmen dribbled through to
Hutchinson, who responded with a
good thirty-yard boot to touch. The
Freshmen, especially Braden, were
then displaying some excellent drib
bling, and Thoburn twice prevented
good gains by doubling up over the
ball. From midfield, a passing rush,
Erb to Davis to Thoburn, netted a
good gain. Thoburn negotiating ten
yards of it by his dodging run. From
a five yard scrum another try was
added to the Sophomore total, Erb
failing of conversion. Sophomores 8,
Freshmen 0.
From an eiKht. yard lineout Sinclair
went over for the next score, Erb add
ing two. Time was called with the
ball in midfield.
Second Hull'.
Early in the next half. Urban, catch
lug a punt, figured in a pretty dodging
nri of 1" yards to the Sophomore HO.
.'.lte;' dribbling rush and run by
Clark the ball was on the Freshman
■>. whence .lacomini dove through in
old game style for a try. Erb failed
to convert. One minute later E.
Clark sprinted five yards for a try and
Erb boote:l a goal. Sophomores 21,
Freshmen 0.
The Freshmen had the empty honor
of scoring last. Hutchinson saved
when the Freshmen dribbled over, and
Laine catching a cross-kick went
across. Dingley's boot for conversion
struck the goal-post.
The Sophomore team clearly out
classed that of the Freshmen. This is
partially explained by the fact that the
baby players have scarcely had suffi
cient time to learn the game. Among
tin- players who showed to advantage
were A. Erb. Sinclair, Dinelev, Urban,
I,nine, and Braden.
