# STANFORD EVER WILL BE DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTION
## H.C. Hoover, '95, Lauds Spirit of Social Liberty in First Student Assembly of the Semester. 
### 
The Stanford s|»irit of unbridled
democracy, which has held sway
since the very founding of the Uni
versity, today was the theme about
which H. C. Hoover, '95, the Father
of the Stanford Union, wove an effec
tive appeal to the Student Body to
protect its traditions, in the first Stu
dent Assembly of the semester.
Four other speakers, representing
as many departments of student ac
tivity, manifested in addresses that
democracy is here to stay. A. W.
Ambrose, President of the Student
Body, opened t lie Assembly. The
other speakers were Miss lleen Bullis,
President of the Women's Confer
ence: D. W. Burbank, Graduate Man
ager; and K. L. Schaupp, Student
Adviser.
"We hope that it will lie the com
mon meeting place for all Stanford
people and in a point of social or
ganization, such a place as the Stan
ford Union will allow us to inocu
late against, the bacillus of social in
equality," said Hoover, "The distin
guishing character of this student
badv has been its democracy."
Stanford Mot Guilty.
"The undemocratic social stratifica
tion which lias been so much dis
cussed of late in our eastern neigh
bors, has not yet entered Stanford to
any alarming extent. Nor do we
want it. From the nature of the
University's endowment, and its loca
tion it will probably never he much
invaded by those who attend college
as preparation for a society career.
"While the Union may contribute
to the machinery which encourages
and stimulates democracy in the so
cial life of the University, these
things do not originate in machinery
but in ideals.
"There has been a great growth
of class feeling in this country during
the past few years and we have seen
with dismay the transplanting of
privilege into the social life of some
of our universities," continued Hoo
ver.
"VVe are accustomed to hear that
since the Middle Ages the univer
sities have been the cradles of liberty.
This may be true in some aspects.
But a more critical review will also
disclose that until the foundation of
American institutions the University
has been the bulwark of aristocracy.
Certainly the older universities are
not cradles of democracy.
Ideals \re Different.
"In tliis country, however, with the
ideals upon which our government is
founded, we have a right to expect, or
even demand that the universities
should be in the forefront of the fight
for equality of opportunity and not a
playground for childish institutions.
The ideals of a university are made
by its members and yours are right
fo far. You niu«t see that you keep
them."
"We now have between $20,000 and
$2".0n0 in hand for the Union and

promises of about that much more,"
said Hoover, "it is our desire, and no
doubt yours, that the actual construc
tion should begin this year. We wish
to make one more effort to increase
our resources and then to finally
settle the designs.
"This matter of the design and
character of the buildings that are to
be erected is one of the greatest con
cern. We are all one in a wish to
start no temporary buildings, but that
whatever we build shall be a part of
a permanent structure of such plan
| that it can he extended as the de
mands of your successors over the
next few centuries may require, but
that none may be ashamed of what we
erect."
Support From Faculty.
President Ambrose, in opening the
meeting, drew attention to the fact.
; that the faculty was as ready and
I anxious for the semester to be started
right as the students themselves,
I evidenced in their prompt granting of
a two-hour meeting.
"We have Student Control and the
kind we have means self control," de
clared President Ambrose. "But we
j must support the men to whom we
i owe the success of the system—the
Student Council. There must be no
j criticism until we are sure of all the
facts Sometimes it is necessary to
be fair to the student disciplined, that
all the facts are not made public."
"I wish to call attention to the new
| interest of the alumni in the univer
sity, manifested in their support of
the Union, the eating clubs project,
j and the portrait of Dr. Jordan, who
j lias the honor of being the first and
only president of a university with a
I great present and a greater future.
| There is a movement on foot now for
i the establishment of large scholar
| ships, and greater gifts are expected
from the alumni in the future."
Miss lleen Bullis, '13, President of
the Women's Student Conference,
made a special plea for greater ii>
' terest in student, affairs by the women
j of the university.
"II is absolutely necessary that the
1 women of the university take a greater
i interest in affairs of their own uni
! versify in order that they may draw
1 more than a mere postscript in the
[ President's welcoming address," de
clared Miss Bullis. "It is our earnest
desire that more women come to
League meetings and stand behind the
Conference, in order that it continue
effective work.
"The Stanford Women's Clubhouse
Fund now aggregates about $11,000,
! almost half of the $25,000 which we
J plan to raise. It is the hope of the
! officials that the present Freshman
j class may witness its completion."
Miss Bullis described the organiza
-1 tion of the Women's Conference for
! self control and explained its relation
to the student body as a whole.
Graduate Manager Burbank fur
' nished figures of Student Body finance
I'm' the past year. He said: "The
Associated Students' organization is
nothing more than the sum total of all
tin students. The tax imposed on
you to help keep up with the vast
demand for athletic fields and appli
ances is $3 a year.
"In the last three years we have
handled about $125,000. This has
been spent with the entire purpose of
encouraging athletics and the idea of
.riving the most economical and host
service. We have now laid aside, as
i sinking fund. which draws
■six per cent, interest in the hank.
"The Big Came for 1913 and 1915
will be played here. The football
ileaehers are good now. but by 1915
they will have to be replaced. We are
getting ready for this task now by
laying aside a sum when we may, a id
•i.ould have more commodious quar
' ts for football training. We need a
v, i.mning tank and larger rooms
"Now. I am not going to ask you to
>uy a season ticket," said Hurbank in

conclusion, "hut ii yon stop to think
of your duty it will never lie neces
sary."
"The present age has been spoken
of tu a constructive period by other
speakers," declared Student Adviser
Schaupp. "No organism is living un
less it is in the constructive period.
"Student Control is in the construc
tive period perhaps, but it will never
be a demonstrated success until the
student Uody split on a ruling and
Student Control survives
"Student Control for the whole Uni
versity will never be a success until
the women and men stand together.
The women of the university will have
to lv-> rm.'re firm themselves. For il
- ice, they appeal to us to start a
movement to eliminate the kitchen
roughs at dances. We go to the men
themselves and this is what we get:
•What are von kicking about? The
girls invited us over.' You can't blame
a man for taking a handout offered
him.

"Student Control in my mind is ;i
thins in which the individual student
does his utmost to uphold a certain
standard. If there is any vital spark
of pride in the students for the uni
versity they will do the things that
are right, the things that are clean
and commonly conceded to be just,
until they raise the standard so high
others will point to us as a model."
