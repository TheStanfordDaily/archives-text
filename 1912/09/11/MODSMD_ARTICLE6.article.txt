# RACE SUICIDE GETS A 'DOUBLE CROSS'
## Classic Circles of Stanford Are Gleeful Over Events of Great Moment. 
### 
Colonel Roosevelt should be notified
immediately. Race suicide has been
given the double Cross in the classic
circles of Stanford university. No
thing like it has happened in the col
lege faculty since the Cannons had
twins.
The double Cross was perpetuated
by Prof, ira B. Cross, of the Economics
department and Prof. C. N. Cross of
the Engineering department, peda
gogues who for years have been
friendly rivals in learning, marriage
and eugenics. When the latter Cross
professor was married two years ago
the former Cross professor was show
ered with congratulations by mistake,
and when the other one took the mari
tal vow, accounts were squared the
other way.
These two Cross families are in no
way related except to be connected
with the sine university faculty. They
are a good team and they are a unit
against race suicide. Also they have
been taking note of Doctor Jordan's
ideas on Burbanking the human race.
Hence it was that the wives of the
professors came to the Peninsula hos
pital in Palo Alto last evening. With
in two hours of each other Prof. I. B.
Cross was enriched by a son and Prof.
C. N. Cross was glorified by a daugh
ter. For every Cross there is a crown
today. On this occasion congratula
tions can not go amiss.
Has the colonel's theory been
double Crossed by the Stanford fac
ulty.
Wlnit's the answer?—S. P. Call.
