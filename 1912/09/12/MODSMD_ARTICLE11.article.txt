# New Field for Varsity Practice.
## 
### 
The new auxiliary dirt field, between
the track training house and the rail
way tracks has been put in condition
for Varsity practice.
The Miff Game will be played at
California this year and the use of the
new field should accustom the Stan
ford men to the change.
