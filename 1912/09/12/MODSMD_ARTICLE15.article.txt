# Why?
## 
### 
The Estate seems to have had a
fencing boom during the past year.

The car line to Palo Alto is
now safely fenced in and the
Peninsula cars can now make

the run in the dark without straying
from the straight and narrow way.
Also a clear line of demarcation has
been erected between the University
grounds and the county road. But
why is there need to fence in the
beautiful approach to the Quadrangle
from Palo Alto? The chief charm of
the dirve was the wilderness that
stretched away on each side beneath
the giant eucalypti. Now we see a
row of cement posts holding taut a
mile of wire fencing, and the shady
aisles are forbidden to any strolling
students. The wilderness is reserved
to the lowing herds of cattle and
bleating flocks of sheep. It seems to
us that the money expended here
might have been used to better advan
tage elsewhere. The cement might
have been used for walks around the
campus. The dirt ones are decidedly
unpleasant during the rainy months
and the main walks should be widened.
Then again, the planting of grass be
tween the buildings would add an ar
tistic setting to Stanford's far famed
Quad. We humbly present the above
suggestions to the University Adminis
tration.
