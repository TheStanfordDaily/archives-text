# UNDISCOVERED GENIUS PAINTS WORD-PICTURES.
## Terrors of Tiny Temblor "Shock" Cub Reporter Into Linguistic Calisthenics. 
### 
It is not often that the whole Uni
versity community is shocked by the
same act. As a rule different people
have different senses of propriety. The
later may have been true this morn
ing but everyone was so shocked at
9:30 as to forget to blush. When the
earthquake hit the Library, studes and
visitors alike left the building in
great hurry and indignaton. Because
of their strength, football heroes were
the first to get out of the building and
were in turn closely followed by the
"subs" and members of the weaker
sex. It is reported that strong men
wept, women fainted, and Freshmen
cried when the realization of the shock
fell 011 the hushed Library throng.
One young lady, who was intensely
studying the "Fall of Rome," at the
time of the shock, became so frighten
ed that she refused to go back to her
work.
Another Impression.
Classes bored to distraction by the
monotonous preliminaries of droning
lectures, Library loungers and callous
couples lulled to a sense of sweet
security in their salubrious bliss, en
nuied Encina dormants still imbibing
soporific sips of slumber, comatose
candidates for athletic honors, and
lethargic pledgers of sums to the
Stanford Union were plunged into
precipitate activity at 9:27 this morn
ing by the tremulous tremblings of
terra firma. The hot weather has de
veloped signs of sleeping sickness
among the students which Nature, in
her wisdom, essayed to destroy. The
effort was successful.
