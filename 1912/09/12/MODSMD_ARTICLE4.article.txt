# PROFESSOR SNYDER RECEIVES A REAL WRIGGLING SNAKE
## 
### 
Professor J. O. Snyder, of the
Zoology department, yesterday
received a small, neatly tied
package bearing the post mark of
a White Mountain resort. The
removal of an abundance of paper
disclosed a square tin box with
perforated lid. underneath which
the professor's eager gaze rested
on a miniature black snake, less
than three inches long. Wriggl
ing about with snapping eyes and
darting tongue, it attempted to
find refuge among some of its
more forbidding kindred, stand
ing in stuffed stateliness about the
room.
Professor Snyder soon classi
fied the small serpent, vulgarly
known as a ring-necked snake,
as Diadolphis Punctatus.
The application of the long
name has had no weighty effect
on the snake so far, and at last
report it nearly succeeded in
escaping through one of the nail
holes in the top of its prison.
