# TRY-OUTS FOR COMIC OPERA OPEN TOMORROW.
## All Parts in Rain's Head Performance Are to be Taken by Men Students. 
### 
| Tryouts for the Ram's Head show
are to start at once. In this two-a't
comic opera all parts are to be taken
by men, including principals and
chorus. To bring out new talent along
musical and comedy lines the society
has arranged plans whereby a long
series of tryouts will be held and thus
allow everyone who so desires a
chance to show his worth.
In the "Rambling Rameses" great
opportunities are offered for a light
and snappy performance. The frame
work for the piece has been written
and around this the individual parts
will be arranged to best suit the per
formers. The scene of the action is
laid in Egypt and thus allows many
chances for novel scenic effects and
staging.
Already a number of songs have
been offered and more are promised.
W. S. Wilson, '13, J. H. McDonald, '14,
and H. Patrick, '10, have contributed
â– ,'tew pieces. McDonald and Mijler
will have charge of the orchestra and
have issued a call for tryouts to take
place tomorrow afternoon at 4:30 in
room f>S. At the same time and place
the tryouts for parts in the play will
lie held. An eight piece orchestra is
to be formed and will accompany the
show on a number of proposed trips
later in the semester.
About a dozen female parts will be
taken by mpn. Three of these will
probably be principals. The tryouts
are open to every man in the Univer
sity.
