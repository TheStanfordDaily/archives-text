## VARSITY PLAYS THE BARBARIANS 1916, MISSION HIGH Intercollegiate Veterans to Appear in Line-up Against Visiting Club Men. 
### 
With the members of the Old Guard
again in the line-up and in fine fettle
after their enforced absence from pre
liminary games, the Varsity will take
field against the Barbarians, Saturday
afternoon. In this, the lirst important
contest of the season, a brand of
rugby should be uncorked to tickle
the palates of the epicures. In a
forty-minute curtain raiser the Fresh
men will play the Mission High school
fifteen.
Last Monday the Barbarians met the
California Varsity, so tomorrow's
game will bring the hibernating dope
sters from their lairs. In the view of
these ever-present enthusiasts, the
Stanford-Barbarian contest will fur
nish a "line" on the respective merits
of the rival University fifteens. Cali
fornia defeated the clubmen in a
game marred by numerous accidents,
due to tin 1 poor condition of the
players. The University scrum had
the upper hand throughout, and con
trived to confine the play to Barbarian
territory during most of the contest.
Several of the great and once-great in
Stanford rugby circles battled for the
Barbarians, including G. Faulkner, '10,
who played wing, A. 1). Fyfe, '13, wing,
C. K. Boulware, ex-'l4, and F. B.
Belcher, '13, forwards.
The Barbarian line-up for tomorrow
will be substantially the following,
barring eleventh-hour changes:
McNab, Rittler, Boulware, Incell,
Gibson, Harris, Densham, Brown, for
wards; Diavila or Phillips, half;
H. Elliott, Griffiths, fives; Merrick,
center three; Fyfe, Faukner, wings;

Many of these Varsity men will find
opponents worthy of their mettle in
the club line-up. Among the Bar
barian forwards appear names of such
players as Boulware, well known on
the Cardinal turf, Incell, the fast back
field man and breakaway, formerly of
St. Mary's, and Harris, the great Cali
fornia breakaway. .1. Dwiggins, an
other California player and a pioneer
in the Rugby llali of Fame, may be
seen with him. At half, Captain Cass
will hardly be outshone by Diavila,
formerly of St. Mary's, or the favorite
"Taffy" Phillips. Other backfield men
from the Barbarian fifteen who are
well known to Stanford fans are Fyfe
and Faulkner. 11. Johns and W.
Johns, noted California backfield
brothers, may lie seen in action for
