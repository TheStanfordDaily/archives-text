# RENOWNED MUSICIANS WILL APPEAR HERE
## PENINSULA CLUB ARRANGES FOR ENTERTAINMENTS. Series of Four Concerts to be Givenâ€” Special Rates Made to Stanford Students. 
### 
A rare treat is in store for the
musicians and music-lovers of the
peninsula this year. An organization
known as the Peninsula Musical Asso
ciation ha s been formed with the ob
ject of enabling the people of this
section of the country to hear the
best artists, both vocalists and instru
mentalists, at a nominal cost.
The plan is to give four concerts
during the year in the Stanford As
sembly hall, and such well known
artists as Schumann-Heink, Gadski,
Zimbalist do Gorgoza, Ricardo Martin
and others will be secured.
To carry out such an elaborate
scheme as this means that there will
have to be hearty cooperation all
along the peninsula from Burlingame
to San .lose. At the present time there
are 1400 members who have sign fled
their intention of securing season
tickets. Included in this number are
most of the wealthy and influential
people of this section besides about
two hundred students.
The price for the season tickets is
extremely reasonable. Five dollars
entitles one to an associate member
ship in the organization and gives the
holder two tickets for every concert.
A special rate has been made to
Stanford students. Two dollars a year
entitling any student to one ticket for
each concert, which is at the rate of
:>0 cents for each entertainment. Non
subscribers will be charged the regu
lar city prices of $1.50 for each con
cert
The seating capacity of the Assem
bly Flail is slightly less than ICOO.
With 1400 season subscribers al
ready secured it will be necessary for
any students who desire to take ad
vantage of this great opportunity of
hearing the world's best at such a
reasonable price to secure tickets im
mediately. This can be done by com
municating with Miss Sara I). Marker
of Palo Alto, the secretary of the
club.
The first program is to he rendered
by Ricardo Martin about the middle
of October.
