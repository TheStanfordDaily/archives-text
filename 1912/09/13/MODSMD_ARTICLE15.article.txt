# High Rank.

### 
In a recent number of the Journal
of the American Medical Association

the Department of Medi-

cine of the University is

placed in the rank of the
foremost Medical Schools of the Uni
ted States. The department is also
listed as one of the twenty-seven
schools having entrance requirements
us high as those in vogue in the
twenty-two leading countries of the
world.
This is a great stride in advance
for Stanford's youngest department.
That this is so is due to the efforts of
President Jordan in carrying the pro
ject through and the work of Dr. R. L.
Wilbur, '9C>, head of the Department
of Medicine.
