Rolling up a score of 14-3 against
the Senior stalwarts, the Junior fifteen
yesterday afternoon made good its
title to contest with 1915 for the
interclass Championship. The game
was snappy, full of fight, and, though
marred by some fumbling, the rugby
exhibited was of good quality con
sidering the early season. On both
teams the scrum excelled the back
field. The Junior forwards were strong
tm lineout work and dribbling and
even participated in passing rushes.
In the backfield the Juniors also de
veloped a scoring machine superior
to that of their opponents.
The Game.
Chandler kicked off for 1913, and the
ball was returned to the Junior 25
yard line. From a lineout at the
Junior 45, King dodged along the side
line to the 25, and a few seconds later
Mly went across for the first try. Lull
failed to convert. Score, 3-0.
Andrews, from a lineout, kicked to
touch at 10 yards. A dribbling rush,
and Burns had a try to his credit.
Darsie failed to convert from a diffi
cult angle. A few seconds later, a
passing rush. Andrews to Halm to
Burns, added three more points to the
total for 1914. Darsie again found the
goal posts difficult, to locate. Score.
3-6.
The Junior backs had found their
pace, and within a minute a passing
rush chalked up three more points for
them. The third time did not prove
the charm for Darsie. Score, 3-9.
From a scrum in center field, short
kicks to touch and a passing rush in
which all the Juniors backs figured,
sent the ball over the line for the
fourth try for the black-jerseyed team.
Darsie converted just as time was
called for the first half. Score, Se
niors, 3; Juniors, 14.
Second Half.
Burns kicked off for 1914 and Whit
aker returned to the Junior 45.
Scrimmages and short boots kept the
play in center for some minutes. Blv
ran through the pack for 15 yards,
Brown marked a long punt at his 20,
and found touch at center. From a
line-out at center, a ragged passing
rush and dribbling match sent the
ball into Senior territory, and except
ing one or two long punts, there it
stayed the remainder of the half. Pyle

scrum. The ball was in play at the
Senior 35 yard line when the half
