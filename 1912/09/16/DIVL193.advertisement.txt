William John Kohler, who assumed the part of Hamlet last night, is an
actor of much merit; in the closet scene, which was the best in the produc
tion, Mr. Kohler was very convincing and artistic.—The Springfield Repub
lican, Springfield, Mass., April 21, 190*5.
Mr. Kohler presented a Hamlet that was the outgrowth of study; his
acting' showed that he was a very Shakespearean Hamlet. — Springfield
Homestead, Springfield, April 2a, 1906.
Mr. Kohler was great as Louis Xi last night in the many passages where
the king throws off his weakness and rules with despotic force—Mr. Kohler
rose to a dramatic intensity which called out rounds of applause from the
audience.—Springfield l 7 nion, Springfield, Mass., April 29, 1904.
Mr. Kohler gave a great recital of '"Hamlet' at the Woman's club-house
Friday evening.—Redwood City Democrat, February 22, 1912.
