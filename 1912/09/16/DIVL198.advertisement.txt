We'll See You Tomorrow
WHEN YOU ARRIVE at Third and Town
send, take the Fourth street car to Market
street, and you'll land at our front door. The
! Third street car will take you to Market street, one
block east.
When you get to the store and finally have torn
yourself away from our display of imported neckwear
and hats, after selecting a few shirts and some of the
new collars, take the elevator to our third floor.
How's that for a men's clothing salesroom? The
biggest and sunniest in the West, and it turns out the
biggest values and sunniest customers of any similar
quarters in the country. Let us put you through it.
