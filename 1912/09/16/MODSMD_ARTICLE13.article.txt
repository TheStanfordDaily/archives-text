# The 						Team.

### 
The Varsity opened their season on
Saturday afternoon with one of the

fastest initial games that
the present college gen
eration has seen. It was

a genuine exhibition of rugby from the
standpoint of backfield and forward
play. The passing ability of the entire
team has seldom been excelled in even
the late season games. We have a
Varsity and Second Team that we can
be proud of.
