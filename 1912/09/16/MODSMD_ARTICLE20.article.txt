# ENDOWED JOURNALISM SUBJECT FOR DEBATE
## JUDGES AND SIDES SELECTED ON SEPTEMBER 27. Large List of Veterans Promises Well For Stanford's Chances in Varsity Contest. 
### 
Intercollegiate forensic arrange
ments have now reached the actual
study of the question for the big de
bate. Friday evening the University
of California debating committee sub
mitted the following resolution to the
Stanford representatives of oratorical
activities: "Resolved, That an endow
ed, non-partisan press, under the di
rection of the state, would make for
the best interests of the people of
the people of California."
The topic chosen for discussion by
the rival universities opens up a field
of investigation hitherto untouched by
collegiate debating. Though there will
lie some excellent material on the sub
ject. the supply will be rather limited
because of the unfamiliarity of the
question in present-day political prob
lems. A great deal of originality of
thought will be required of the stu
dent and an aptitude for the collec
tion of references.
E. E. Tincher, '12, handled many
of the phases of the newspaper prob
lem in his prize essay on the "Ethics
of Journalism" in the Bonnheim Dis
sertation. His paper treated of the de
fects of the modern journalistic sys
tem, the stifling of news, and the sub
version of truth. It should form a
handy reference for the debaters.
A list of not less than six prospec
tive judges must be referred to the
Blue and Gold orators, by September
27, from which they will select the
three men who will pass upon the
merits of the arguments in the Var
sity controversy. At the same time
the Cardinal forensic societies will
have decided which side to uphold in
the contest.
The tryouts for positions on the
intercollegiate team will be held with
in the next three weeks. This is the
contest between the two universities
for supremacy in a purely intellectual
field. Twelve former members of
Varsity or inter class contests will
form the nucleus around which a vic
torious team can be built. The vet
erans of public debates are E. E.
Tincher, '12, G. N. Wood, '11!, E. C.
Smith, '13, P. D. Nowell, '13, T. L.
Smith, '14, C. C. Close. '14, W. I?.
Owens, "14, O. H. Castle, 14, A. E.
Worthy, '15, P. L. Higgins. '15, A. F.
Coyle, 'IT), and W. F. Kilcline, '15.
There are more than twenty members
of the debating clubs who have some
experience in tryouts before this time
and a force of thirty Freshmen whose
ability in oratory is promising.
