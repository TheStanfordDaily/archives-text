### 
Surprising their friends and rela
tives, A. J. Howe, '1"), last year's Var
sity pitcher, and Miss Helen Waynick,
a former student at Palo Alto high
school, were quietly married in Sacra
mento last Friday.
The announcement came as a great
surprise, for Howe had already regis
tered for the fall semester.
Miss Waynick was well known in
younger social circles in Palo Alto.
Howe left the campus a few days
ago and went to Sacramento, where he
has accepted a responsible position
with a mercantile company.
