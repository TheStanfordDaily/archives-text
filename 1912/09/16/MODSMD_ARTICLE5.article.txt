# BARBARIANS AND MISSION FALL PREY TO STANFORD
## Varsity and Freshmen Play Real Rugby and Wallop Oppenents With Ease and Despatch. 
### 
Stanford Varsity, 8, Barbarians, 0;
Freshmen, 18, Mission High, 8. These
are the satisfying figures resulting
from two satisfying rugby games on
Saturday. The Stanford Varsity, as
such, signalized its maiden venture of
the year across the goal-line of an
opponent by scoring the try as a re
sult of a passing rush which should
have delighted the most blase rugby
critic. Kern, Risling, Harrigau, Noble
and Thoburn were the players figur
ing this excellent bit of rugby.

As a whole, the Varsity showed
much better form than at this stage
of last season. It opposed by far the
strongest fifteen which the Barbarian
Club has brought to Stanford in recent
years, a team noteworthy for strong
defensive playing, and yet managed
to gear its offensive machine up to a
fair degree of efficiency. The Varsity
was weaker in the scrum department
than in the backfield. The Barbarian
forwards, numbering such men as I
Turton, Bruick and Brown, practiced |
in the rugby skill of New Zealand,
secured the ball almost as frequently
as the Cardinal players in the scrum, j
In dribbling, however, the Varsity i
forwards showed to good advantage,
and made use of this play as an effec
tive offensive weapon. In lineout
work honors were even, but the tall
figures of Dole and Partridge were
conspicuously among those missing.
The Sophomore, Jacomini, gave a good
accounting of himself in his first ap
pearance in such fast company, while
Thoburn "came back" with a ven
geance.
(«ood I'sissing.
The play, of the Cardinal backfield
men gave great pleasure. Their pass
ing rushes were often nipped in the
bud, and were not always smooth, but
this is easily attributable to lack of
practice. When a man did get ;i pass
away, it was well aimed, there was
generally another player going at
high speed to receive it, and the
passer played to the right position
liter getting rid of the ball. Captain
Cass at half was at all times master \
of the situation, and, yet more to his
credit, master of his pass. Noble,
playing at wing, seemed to fall easily
into the position, and his hard, ac
curate tackles were always notable ;
episodes of the game. In this tackling
art the other Cardinal players showed
some deficiency, but improved as the j

game wore 011. Erb, at fullback, was
always reliable, and seemed to find
touch with left or right foot at
pleasure. He featured with his high
spirals to advance the Cardinal
offense.
At the first whistle ten former Var
sity players were seen 011 the Stan
ford team. They were Sanborn, Smith,
Gard, Schaupp, Thoburn, Cass, Noble,
Harrigan, Risling, and B. Erb. These
men played till the early part of the
second half, when Coach Presley be
gan sending in substitutes. He did
this with such a free hand that the
ranks of the great "army of the un
employed," which camped some forty
strong 011 the greensward in front of
the bleachers, were greatly thinned.
These substitutes demonstrated that
the ten veterans named had no
monopoly of rugby skill.
Varsity Game in Detail.
Erb kicked off for Stanford, and
within a few seconds the ball went
to touch at 15 yards. After play
threatening the visitors' line, Smith of
the Barbs went through the pack for
2ft yards, one of the best runs of the
day. but play almost immediately re
turned deep in his half of the field.
A passing rush, Kern to Templeton,
and a one yard scrum both failed to
score for the Varsity. Cross kicks
were next in order, Templeton and
Noble in long boots. Erb's kick was
intercepted and play went across the
field, when the Stanford backs got
the ball, and in a passing rush that
thrilled the bleachers, Kern-Risling-
Harrigan-Noble-Thoburn, it was sent
over the line for a try. Erb failed to
convert. Score, 3-0.
At the end of the half play was on
Stanford's 15 yard line.
The Cardinal came on the field with
out change except in the middle rank,
where Sinclair had replaced Smith.
However, within a few minutes, Coach
Presley began to send in substitutes,
and at the end of play second substi
tutes as well as first had had a chance
on the turf.
Darsie replaced Gard. Then came
changes galore in both teams. Lull
and Harrigan took the places of
Schaupp and Jacomini in the scrum,
while A. Erb replaced P. Harrigan at
first five. In the line of Bargs, Bel
cher went in for H. J. Smith. Skinner
replaced Hall in the scrum.
More changes in the lineup—-"Halm
went in for Templeton, H. J. Smith
took Eyfe's place in the Barb scrum,
and shortly after R. lb-own replaced
R. Erb at Varsity full back. Burns
took Cass's place at half.. Davis re
placed Kern at center.
It was time for Stanford to score
again, and from a lineout at 5, A.
Erb went over for a try. Lull con
verted and the Stanford side of the
scoreboard acquired an "8." Before
time was called Blase replaced Smith,
and Single took Bly's place. The ball
was in Barbarian territory at the
crack of the gun.


B. E. Erb, '11.
