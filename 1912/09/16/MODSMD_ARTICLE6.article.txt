# OLYMPICS GIVE HARD GAME TO CALIFORNIA.
## Palo Alto's Drubbing of Opponents Promises Lively Games For Next Saturday. 
### 
In a contest characterized by tactics
which usually predominate within a
squared-circle rather than on a rugby
gridiron, the Olympics, who are to lie
the next opponents of the Stanford
Varsity fifteen, went down to defeat
before the California Varsity Saturday
afternoon. The city clubmen gave the
Blue and Gold aggregation one of the
nearest approaches to a defeat that it
has suffered for some time. The Cali
fornians put over their lone try just
as the whistle blew for discontinuation
of play. Stroud converted the try,
making the final score 5 to 3.
Phillips scored the only points for
the Olympics. His try, which was not
converted, was the result of a passing
rush into which Montgomery and
Austin were the features. Sundeli,
Trowbridge, Arrel, Haley and Stafford,
former Stanford players, were mem
bers of the Olympic team.
