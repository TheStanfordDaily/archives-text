# CENTRAL CONTROL OF STATE RUGBY FORMED
## ATTEMPT TO STAY WITH THE OLD GAME FAILS IN SOUTH. Present Rugby Union May Admit the Southern Colleges and Preparatory Schools. 
### 
The feeble attempt on the part of
two of the colleges in the southern
portion of the state to preserve the
old game, has had anything but a dis
astrous effect on the status of the
rugby game in this end of the state.
A rugby union has been perfected this
fall which, according to plans,
promises to perpetuate rugby on the
firm foundation on which it has al
ready been laid.
This Union is now composed of
Stanford, California, University of the
Pacific, and the Olympic and Bar
barian athletic clubs, and has as its
purpose the control of rugby all over
the state. At present it only includes
the larger institutions that are play
ing rugby but the number of members
will be increased as the present Union
sees fit. It is moulded on the plan of
the English rugby unions and is very
similar to the rugby board that con
trols the game in British Columbia.
Many of the preparatory schools
have applied for admission and the
applications have been taken under
advisement.
The Union, being comprised of thu
men who most thoroughly understand
rugby, acts as a court of appeal for
any and all disputes that may arise,
and they are also in a position to bet
ter provide for coaches and referes.
A committee of the Union composed
of Coach Presley, Coach Schaefer of
California, and W. P. Fuller, '10. has
recently been appointed to make a
definite arrangement in regard to
referees. Something similar to this
w;is attempted by the referees' union
last year but was unsuccessful.
It is also this Rugby Union that has
in charge the handling the Australian
visit, and a committee from the Union,
composed of J. H. Hickey, chairman,
11. McKenzie, and 1). W. Burbank, '09.
has been appointed to take charge of
the entertainment of the Antipodeans.
The Stanford committee will work as
a sub-committee of this board.
This committee met last night to
discuss tentative plans for the en
tertainment of the men from over the
sea. The voluntary co-operation
offered by Stanford was greatly ap
preciated.
