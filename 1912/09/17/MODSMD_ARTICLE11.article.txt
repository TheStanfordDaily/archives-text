### 
Prince Lazarovich-Hrebelianovich,
with the World Peace Movement as
his topic, will lecture at the Univer
sity during the first week of October.
The lecturer is the present head of the
old Imperial dynastic family Lazaro
vich-Hrebelianovich, which ruled for
several centuries in Servia,
Prince Lazarovich is a gradute of
the Royal and Imperial Military Col
leges of Servia, and was for several
years an officer in the Servian army.
His active political life begain in 189H,
at which time he entered into a cam
paign against Kings Milan and Alex
ander of Servia, on account of a secret
treaty made by King Milan with Aus
tria-Hungary. This treaty has since
been recognized as an act highly
treasonable io the Servian State.
Pefore that time, however, he wan
closely connected with the founding
and organizing of the Macedonian
Committees, formed for the freeing of
the Christians of Macedonia from
Turkish rule.
The lecture here will consist of a
discussion of the present social, politi
cal, geographical, and economical
problems in connection with Servian
unification as a factor in the move
ment for world peace.
The Panama Canal question, witli
the development of the Pacific Coast
and the Gulf of Mexico, is also sur
veyed, and as these questions are of
vital importance to the people of Cali
fornia at this time, the lecture will
be of great interest.
A lecture tour of the largest
American Universities has been plan
ned by Prince Lazarovich, starting
with his talk here early in October.
He is working politically for the uni
fication of the Servian race and for
the creation of a great Servian state,
which involves the liberation of the
old Servian countries from Turkish
and other foreign rule. The recent
advent of Italy as a great Eastern
Mediterranean Power, and the interior
collapse of Turkey, are events which
have broken the status quo of Eastern
Europe, so that the time is probably
near at hand when Servia may peace
fully come to the front and take her
place among the powers of Eastern
Europe.
