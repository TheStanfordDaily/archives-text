# Hoodlums.
## 
### 
On the last car back from San .lose
one evening recently, a group of
hoodlums from Palo Alto and Mayfield,

in a state of more or less
inebriation, saw fit to
claim temporary allegi-

ance to Stanford. Between the sing
ing of Stanford songs, they bawleu
forth insulting remarks and acted in
a manner generally disgracefully.
Such affairs happen too often in com
munities adjacent to universities and
it is time that such occurrences cease
in the vicinity of Stanford. Swift
punishment should be meted out to
any parties who indulge in any further
demonstrations of the above kind and
we recommend its administration by
the students.
