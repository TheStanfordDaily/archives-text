Strict training rules for the entire
Rugby squad are to go into effect the
latter part of the week. The first
warning was given on Monday after
noon, the few day's grace being an
innovation which is certain to be
much appreciated by all candidates
for football honors.

A. Sanborn, '12, who suffered a
cracked rib in Saturday's game, will
not be seen on the field for a week or
ten days. Fortunately the fracture
was not a bad one, and will not intei
fere with his season's work in football.

The number of injuries to date on
the football field has been surprising
ly small, and Trainer Maloney has
yet to treat a case which is likely to
prove at all serious.
