# Membership Campaign Begins.
## 
### 
This week the local Y. M. C. A. be
gins its annual membership campaign,
in which every man of the University
will be given the opportunity to affi
liate himself with that organization.
Heretofore it has been the policy
of the Association to consider a man
a member the rest of his college
course, if he had paid the one dollar
fee but once. Now the Association
begins the college year every Fall
without any members whatever, and
no "deadhead" is carried over from
the previous year.
The success with which the em
ployment bureau has been run this
year is shown by the fact that nearly
every applicant has been supplied with
work and that people are telephoning
in daily, making the list of unfilled
applications decidely smaller.
