# JUNIORS WILL JOLLY-UP NEXT FRIDAY AT ARMORY.
## 
### 
Members of the class of 1914 are to
set-together at the first Jolly-up of
the semester next Friday evening in
the Armory, Palo Alto. The Juniors
choose September 20 as the date for
the class informal so that the men
who are on the football squad might
attend without infringing on the
training rules which are to go into
effect soon.
The customary Jolly-up attire is to
prevail. Eats and stunts are to have
a prominent place on the program of
entertainment.
