# LAGUNITA'S OBSERVATORY AWAITS SIX-INCH TELESCOPE.
## 
### 
The most ambitious casting ever
made at Stanford will be that of tbe
support and barrel of the new six
inch reflecting telescope to be install
ed in the astronomical observatory
above Lagunita. Although the lenses
will be supplied from a Pittsburg op
tical firm, the main frame work will
lie made at the University shops. At
present the observatory proper is
waiting the reception of the telescope.
A. G. Atkinson, '11, has done the
work of erecting the observatory and
the drawing up of the plans under the
direction of Professor Townley of the
Mathematics department. The obser
vatory will be under the supervision
of the Mathematics department.
