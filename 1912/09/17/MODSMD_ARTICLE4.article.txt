# SPIKE'S SUCCESSOR A COMMON CARPET TACK, TACKLES RUGBY
## 
### 
TACK, a spindled-shaped, brass
headed, installment of the cele
brated Spike, has gone out for
Rugby. At least, he made a spec
tacular dash for the ball early In
the first half of Saturday's game
that served as a curtain-raiser to
the yell-leader vaudeville.
Tack's remarkable form was a
feature of the afternoon. He is
built close to ground and should
show great speed in breaking
through the line or making a low
tackle. At present he is on a diet
of bear meat to get in condition
for the Big Slaughter. Tack's ac
tivities testify to surprising lax
ity and antiquity of methods in
the Medical department.
