# FRESHMEN WILL MEET PALO ALTO TOMORROW.
## Strengthened Lineup for 1916 Means Hard Battle With Crack High School Players. 
### 
Determined to follow up their week
end victory, the Freshman fifteen will
line up against Palo Alto high school
team tomorrow afternoon at 4:30.
The game promises to be interesting,
as the playing of the Freshmen has
improved recently and Palo Alto is
still working in fine form.
Last Saturday the town lads walked
away with the long end of a 43-6
score from the Cogswell school rugby
team. The well-known machine-like
passing rushes of the Palo Alto back
field were responsible for the large
score. Weeks, Wallace, Risling, Ste
vens and Davidson figured largely in
these rushes.
The Palo Alto line-up will be:
Sherman, Card. McGilvray, Slocum,
Nagel, Flugel, Roulware, forwards;
Davidson, wing forward; Stevens,
half; McKaig, Risling, fives; Wallace,
center three; Weeks, Lachmuiul,
wings; Bowie, full.
