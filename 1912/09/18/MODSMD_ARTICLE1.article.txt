# 1914 PLAYERS NOW ARE INTERCLASS CHAMPIONS
## DEFEAT SOPHOMORES AND WIN FAST SERIES. Upperclassmen Score Try in First Half But Fail to Cross Line in Second Period. 
### 
Forty minutes of hard fighting.
Score, Juniors 3, Sophomores 0. This
in a nutshell is the story of the final
game of the interclass series yester
day. For forty minutes each one of
thirty players maintained a deadly
determination to win, and the result
was one of the scrappiest contests
that has ever torn up the turf of
Stanford Field.
It is useless to mention particular
stars. Every man fought hard, and it
was a game of fighting. Brown at full
for the victors demonstrated that his
brother is not the only man in the
family who can shine at. the position.
Hums made a peerless half and skip
per. Andrews, at first five, promises
to become as good at rugby as he was
at the old game, though 011 defense
lie found the fast A. Erb a little too
much for him. Knight and Sim were
good ground gainers, and among many
line forwards Clover showed to ad
vantage. Sincliar, .Jacomini and Dut
ton bolstered the Sophomore scrum,
while Davis, Cookson and Erb were
invaluable in the baekfield.

The first try catne after touch hao
been found at the Sophomore 30 on a
pass, Burns to Andrews. The ball
was worked to the 15 mark, where
the Juniors were awarded a free kick.
Burns crossed to Clover who sprinted
over. Darsie failed to convert.
After play largely in the Sophomore
territory the half ended with the ball
near midfield.
For the first five minutes of the
second period the Sophomores had
the advantage and threatened a score.
Then the Juniors slowly began to
work the play away from the danger
zone. Time and again did they dribble
or ruck the ball toward mid-field,
only to have it returned to touch
around their 2."> by Erb or some other
Sophomore hooter. Toward the last
of the half Brown marked at his 40
and got touch at the Sophomore 1">.
On a free boot at his opponents' in,
Darsie failed to score from a place.
At the gun's crack the ball was at
the Sophomore 2">.
