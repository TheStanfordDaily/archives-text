The continuance of the lingering
suninier, with its balmy nights, seems

to have ensured a con
tinuance of the mosquito

pest. We understand that
the mosquito exists only in regions
adjacent to stagnant bodies of water
Such conditions are a menace to the
health of the University public and
the comfort of the students. Colder
weather will soon dispose of the pres
ent crop of mosquitos, but unless the
conditions now existing are changed,
we are bound to have a duplication
annually. An investigation by the stu
dents of the Department of Medicine
would be timely.
