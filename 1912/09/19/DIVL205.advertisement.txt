Men's Fall Overcoats
IF IT'S WARM, when you read this, don't over
look the fact that the first of October is only
about ten days distant and with it conies over
coat weather.
Our object in reminding you now is to give you
a chance to see all the new models before any arc
completely sold out —for some men are wise enough
to buy overcoats before they are compelled to.
Domestic and Imported Coats constitute an un
rivaled line priced from $15 to $100.

William John Kohler, who assumed the part of Hamlet hist night, is an
actor of much merit; in the closet scene, which was the best in the produc
tion, Mr. Kohler was very convincing and artistic.—The Springfield Repub
lican, Springfield, Mass., April 21, 1900.
Mr. Kohler presented a Hamlet that was the outgrowth of study; his
acting showed that he was a very Shakespearean Hamlet. — Springfield
Homestead, Springfield, April 25, 1906.
Mr. Kohler was great as Louis XI last night in the many passages where
the king throws off his weakness and rules with despotic force—Mr. Kohler
rose to a dramatic intensity which called out rounds of applause from the
audience.—Springfield Union, Springfield, Mass., April 29, 1904.
Mr. Kohler gave a great recital of "'Hamlet' at the Woman's club-house
Friday evening.—Redwood City Democrat, February 22, 1912.
