# MURRAY WINS FINALS OF REGENT TOURNAMENT
## VICTOR BECOMES HOLDER OF TROPHY AGAIN. Captain V.A. Sheldon is no Match for His Opponent's Offensive Net Playing. 
### 
Ex-captain R. Ij. Murray, '13, won
tlie Regent Handicap Tennis Tourna
ment and became possessor of the
trophy for the second year in succes
sion by defeating Captain V. L. Shel
don, '15, in the finals of the contest
yesterday afternoon on Encina courts.
The former Varsity skipper took three
straight sets, winning by the scores 01
6-2, <;-3. Â«-2.
The playing was not as one-sided
as the final scores appear. At times
it looked as if Sheldon was going to
come back, but in the close pinches
he seemed unable to place the ball
and get it in the court. Murray on the
other hand was fighting hard through
out the three sets and seemed to be
on all parts of the court at one time.
Sheldon was forced to keep near the
back line and play on the defensive
continually. Murray would rush to
the net after every serve and drive the
ball at his opponent in the rear of
the court.
"I beat him because I played better
than 1 ever played before," asserted
Murray, when asked as to his opinion
of the match.
Since the two men played from
scatch they v eve on the same looting
as if the tournament had been a con
test without handicap. As the cup is
a perpetual trophy Murray will be the
holder for one year.
