# PALO ALTANS AGAIN DRUB FRESHMEN TEAM
## 9-3 WAS SCORE IN YESTERDAY'S GAME. High School Boys Play Better Rugby But Hot Weather Slows Pace of Both Teams. 
### 
By playing superior rugby, the Palo
Alto High School fifteen defeated the
Freshmen 9-3 yesterday afternoon.
The game was less interesting than
the previous contest with the local
high school hoys, and suffered by com
parison with the hammer and tongs
class game of Tuesday afternoon.
Nevertheless, considering the where
abouts of the mercury, the pace was
fairly fast, and the showing of the
Freshmen not discouraging, though far
from brilliant.
Better team work, and, above all,
greater ability to follow the ball, gave
the game to Palo Alto. The high
school players knew the exact status
of the game and the exact location of
the pigskin at every moment of play.
In the lineouts and dropouts they
jumped to their positions like football
players intent on the game, not like
men starting out on an afternoon
stroll.
The contest was chiefly waged by
means of rucking, dribblng and touch
booting. Not a single passing rush
worthy of the name signalized the af
ternoon's play.
The Game.
McGilvrav kicked off for Palo' Alto
and the ball went to touch at 30. Not
long after, dribbling took the ball to
a scrum at Freshmen 5, from which
Davidson went over. The Palo Alto
captain failed to convert his own try.
Palo Alto, 3, Freshmen, 0.
Dribbling and rucking now sent the
play to Palo Alto territory, and David
son marked at his ii. Again the battle
tide swung to the Freshman ground.
A pass, Stevens to Risling, took the
sphere into the danger zone, and Wal
lace, receiving a pass, went across.
No conversion. Palo Alto, 6, Fresh
men, 0. At the period's end the ball
was on Freshman 25.
Soon after the whistle Risling inter
cepted a pass, and the brother of the
Stanford crack sprinted from his 40 to
the Freshmen 25. The ball advanced
20 yards farther, when fullback Brown
found touch at his 25 in a nice kick.
Next featured Weeks' forty yard sprint
to a try but not to a conversion.
Later the Freshmen assumed the ag
gressive for almost the first lime in
the game. Dribbling, rucking, and a
boot by Lammiman on pass from Hol
llister led to a scrum at Palo Alto's
25. Passing the Freshman backfleld
advanced the offense 10 yard, and
Lammiman to Hollister found touch
at ten. The try came from a one yard
scrum. Cass failed to convert.

The line-ups were:
Freshmen — Edwards, Stevenson,
Butterfleld, Dubendorf (Keast), Bra
den, Hayes (Cass), Bacon. Murray,
forwards; Brown, half; Long, Camp
bell, (Hollister). fives; Lammiman,
center three; Wickersham, Graves
three; Wickersham (Urban), Laine
(Urban), wings; Brown, full.
Palo Alto—McGilvray, Nagel, David
son, Card, Flugel, Gibson, Doulware,
Sherman, forwards; Stevens, half;
McKaig, Risling fives; Wallace, center
three; Weeks (Kirksev), Lachmund.
wings; Bowie, full.
By playing superior rugby, the Palo
Alto High School fifteen defeated the
Freshmen 9-3 yesterday afternoon.
The game was less interesting than
the previous contest with the local
high school hoys, and suffered by com
parison with the hammer and tongs
class game of Tuesday afternoon.
Nevertheless, considering the where
abouts of the mercury, the pace was
fairly fast, and the showing of the
Freshmen not discouraging, though far
from brilliant.
Better team work, and, above all,
greater ability to follow the ball, gave
the game to Palo Alto. The high
school players knew the exact status
of the game and the exact location of
the pigskin at every moment of play.
In the lineouts and dropouts they
jumped to their positions like football
players intent on the game, not like
men starting out on an afternoon
stroll.
The contest was chiefly waged by
means of rucking, dribblng and touch
booting. Not a single passing rush
worthy of the name signalized the af
ternoon's play.
The Game.
McGilvrav kicked off for Palo' Alto
and the ball went to touch at 30. Not
long after, dribbling took the ball to
a scrum at Freshmen 5, from which
Davidson went over. The Palo Alto
captain failed to convert his own try.
Palo Alto, 3, Freshmen, 0.
Dribbling and rucking now sent the
play to Palo Alto territory, and David
son marked at his ii. Again the battle
tide swung to the Freshman ground.
A pass, Stevens to Risling, took the
sphere into the danger zone, and Wal
lace, receiving a pass, went across.
No conversion. Palo Alto, 6, Fresh
men, 0. At the period's end the ball
was on Freshman 25.
Soon after the whistle Risling inter
cepted a pass, and the brother of the
Stanford crack sprinted from his 40 to
the Freshmen 25. The ball advanced
20 yards farther, when fullback Brown
found touch at his 25 in a nice kick.
Next featured Weeks' forty yard sprint
to a try but not to a conversion.
Later the Freshmen assumed the ag
gressive for almost the first lime in
the game. Dribbling, rucking, and a
boot by Lammiman on pass from Hol
llister led to a scrum at Palo Alto's
25. Passing the Freshman backfleld
advanced the offense 10 yard, and
Lammiman to Hollister found touch
at ten. The try came from a one yard
scrum. Cass failed to convert.
