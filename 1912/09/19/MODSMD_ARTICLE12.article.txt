# Class Sweaters.
## 
### 
In the past the classes have been
given free roin in the awarding of

sweaters to their athletes
winning the recognized in
terclass contests. In con
sequence the committees

appointed to select the sweaters have
been given out the class emblems on
the same type of sweaters as the Var
sity men are awarded. For the sake
of distinction this should not be. The
decision of the Executive Committee
last evening that the class emblems
should henceforth be placed on jerseys
was timely.
