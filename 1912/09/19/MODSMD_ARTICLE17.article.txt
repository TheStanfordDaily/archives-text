# Bellow's Art Work in Next Chaparral.
## 
### 
Two or more full-page drawings in
the choice style of V. F. Bellows, '09,
will be the feature of the next number
of the Chaparral now going to press.
Editor M. T. Dooling, '11, has secured
these hitherto unpublished works of
one of Stanford's premier artists and
will dedicate the pages to Bellows,
who recently met his death on the
waters of Lake Erie. One of the
former editors of "Chappie" who was
intimately acquainted with Bellows,
will write an appreciation of his work
for the issue.
