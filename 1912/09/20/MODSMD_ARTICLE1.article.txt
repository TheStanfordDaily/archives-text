# OLYMPICS WILL MEET VARSITY ON SATURDAY
## CLUBMEN IN STRONG LINE-UP WILL TEST CARDINAL. Berkeley High Fifteen to Appear With Freshmen in Forty Minute Rugby Sketch. 
### 
Facing the hard-lighting wearers of
the Winged "O" for the first time this
season, the Stanford Varsity goes
into action tomorrow in a game that
promises to he one of the snappiest
of early season games. The Olympics
come to Stanford Unshed with a near
victory at California, where a week
a-i'o they lost, after a strenuous game,
to tho Blue and Gold players by the
narrow margin of two points. In
this lies a golden opportunity for all
dopesters. On last Saturday, Skippe.
Stroud of California snatched a vic
tory from the clubmen by converting
a noal after time was called. l T p to
the last minute of play the scoreboard
stood 3-0 in favor of the Winged "O."
Tomorrow practically the same team
of club players will oppose the Car
dinal Varsity, giving the earliest side
light on the relative strength of the
rival collegians.
To start their season's play with the
rival universities auspiciously, the
Olympic Club has perfected a rugby
machine which will test the mettle
of every Varsity player. In punting,
and offensive work, ihev should ex
cel, as behind a heavy scrum they
have a backfleld of rugby stars. Their
defense is best illustrated in last
week's game, where again and again
they broke up the passing rushes of
the transbay collegians and turned
the tide of battle into their oppo
nents' territory. Montgomery, at
half, and Austin, Phillips and Jones
on the backline, proved themselves
formidable players, and should make
the Cardinal backfleld look to its
laurels in passing and in defense.
To furnish a preliminary bout
worthy of the day, the Freshmen are
slated to lineup against the fast and
hard-playing fifteen of Berkeley High
School. The baby Cardinal repre
sentatives, strengthened by changes
in lineup and by the experience gained
in Wednesday's game and in the
week's practice, should make a good
showing and prove themselves to be
more than mere novices at the Eng
lish game
J. H. Hickey, ex-'O7, will hold the
whistle in the first game and H. 11.
Ashley, U. C. '10, will referee the
Varsity contest.

on the backline, proved themselves
formidable players, and should make
the Cardinal backfleld look to its
laurels in passing and in defense.
To furnish a preliminary bout
worthy of the day, the Freshmen are
slated to lineup against the fast and
hard-playing fifteen of Berkeley High
School. The baby Cardinal repre
sentatives, strengthened by changes
in lineup and by the experience gained
in Wednesday's game and in the
week's practice, should make a good
showing and prove themselves to be
more than mere novices at the Eng
lish game
J. H. Hickey, ex-'O7, will hold the
whistle in the first game and H. 11.
Ashley, U. C. '10, will referee the
Varsity contest.

Facing the hard-lighting wearers of
the Winged "O" for the first time this
season, the Stanford Varsity goes
into action tomorrow in a game that
promises to he one of the snappiest
of early season games. The Olympics
come to Stanford Unshed with a near
victory at California, where a week
a-i'o they lost, after a strenuous game,
to tho Blue and Gold players by the
narrow margin of two points. In
this lies a golden opportunity for all
dopesters. On last Saturday, Skippe.
Stroud of California snatched a vic
tory from the clubmen by converting
a noal after time was called. l T p to
the last minute of play the scoreboard
stood 3-0 in favor of the Winged "O."
Tomorrow practically the same team
of club players will oppose the Car
dinal Varsity, giving the earliest side
light on the relative strength of the
rival collegians.
To start their season's play with the
rival universities auspiciously, the
Olympic Club has perfected a rugby
machine which will test the mettle
of every Varsity player. In punting,
and offensive work, ihev should ex
cel, as behind a heavy scrum they
have a backfleld of rugby stars. Their
defense is best illustrated in last
week's game, where again and again
they broke up the passing rushes of
the transbay collegians and turned
the tide of battle into their oppo
nents' territory. Montgomery, at
half, and Austin, Phillips and Jones
on the backline, proved themselves
formidable players, and should make
the Cardinal backfleld look to its
laurels in passing and in defense.
