# Wait!
## 
### 
At the game last Saturday a con
siderable section of the rooters left

the bleachers before the sing
of "Hail, Stanford, Hail." As
they were mainly Freshmen

we take this opportunity to inform
them that it is customary to wait for
the singing of the Stanford hymn
after the games before leaving the
bleachers.
