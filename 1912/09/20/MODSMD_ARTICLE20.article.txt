# CROS SCOUNTRY RUNNERS RAPIDLY IMPROVING.
## Prospect for Competition With Outside Teams Brightâ€”Large Squad Training Regularly. 
### 
With the assurance that at least
seven cups are to be awarded as the
prizes of the victors in the first an
nual cross-country run which is plan
ned for this semester, more than sixty
men are training regularly and taking
the runs across the fields and hills
three times a week. Within the past
two weeks the improvement in the
work of the candidates has been par
ticularly noticeable. In the beginning
it, was decided to divide the squad
I into two groups in accordance with
j the degree of speed shown by the run
; ners. The divisions were known as
I the fast and slow squads. The leaders
have abandoned this classification,
however, as the rival sections have de
veloped so rapidly that there is little
I difference between them.
This afternoon the cross-country
men were taken over a course measur
ing between four and five miles. The
men were taken along at a slow pace
I because of the heat, and despite the
adverse weather conditions finished
! in excellent fashion.
It is probable that the members of
the squad will be given an opportunity
, to compete against outside teams dur
ing the fall season. Track Captain
; Campbell is canvassing the situation
| and expects to make definite arrange
j ments very soon. Competition later
in the season will give "Dad" an ad
j ditional chance to get a line on his>
charges and conduct his training ac
cordingly.
In addition to the cross-country
I squad the oval is assuming a busy
! appearance with the advent of the
aspirants for places in various other
events. The sprinters have been do
, ing light work on the new fifty yard
turf straight-away. The track proper
has been harrowed and is undergoing
| treatment at the hands of Sam Mc
; Donald and his assistants.
