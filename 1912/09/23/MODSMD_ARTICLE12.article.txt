# DR. HOISHOLT APPOINTED LECTURER IN MEDICINE.
## Special Ruling by Hospital Directors Permits Psychiatrist to Address Students. 
### 
The appointment of Dr. A. W. Hois
holt as a lecturer in the Department
of Medicine at San Francisco, so far
as is known, establishes a precedent
in that he is the first man from a state
hospital to be granted permission to
give a lecture course before Stanford
students.
The board of directors of the Stock
ton State Hospital for the Insane have
made a ruling permitting Dr. Hoisholt
to journey to San Francisco once a
week to deliver a lecture on psychiatry
in the Department of Medicine.
Dr. Hoisholt's appointment was
made some time ago, but final con
firmation could not lie made by the
Hoard of Trustees until the board of
directors of the hospital took action.
Dr. Hoisholt easily is the best
trained psychiatrist on the coast. He
graduated from Cooper Medical col
lege in ISB2 and immediately went to
Europe, where he pursued the study
of mental disease in Heidelberg, Leip
sic and Munich until ISSIi, when he re
turned to the coast.
He was appointed assistant physi
cian in the Stockton hospital in ISS9,
but returned to Heidelberg in 1903 to
study for another year.
