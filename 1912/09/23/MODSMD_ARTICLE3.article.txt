# VARSITY TAKES MATCH IN LIGHTNING FINISH
## Freshmen Defeated 8-0 by Berkeley High School in Preliminary Contest Saturday Afternoon. 
### 
The finale of Saturday's Stanford-
Olympic match was constructed ex
actly 0,l ihe formula of the usual
piece of football fiction. With only
a few more minutes of play and the
home team losing, the Freshman,
Dingley, is put into the game; tear
ing down the turf he springs into the
air, catches a pretty cross-kic c from
Captain Cass, swerves past Olym
pic fullback, scores a try, and saves
tiie day. 6-5, with the tag of the
the day. 6-5, with the Cardinal on the
Cardinal on the long end, was the
score in the hard fought contest of
Saturday.
Despite tlie sensational finish, Cap
tain Cass had not quite the same
reason to be proud of his team that
he had a week ago. The skipper him
self never showed to better advan
tage. His generalship, his pass, ana
his defensive work, were all that
could lie desired. But the backs be
hind him did not figure in the splen
did passing rushes that characterized
the recent Barbarian game. For one
thing, the forwards monopolized the
ball much of the time; but when it
did come to the backs, they had a
tendency to ruin their chances by
poor passing or by being out of posi
tion to receive the pass. The hard
accurate tackling was also less in
evidence.
As a whole the game was well
fought, both teams being good on de
fensive work, scrumming and rucking,
and following the ball. In the latter
point it is very doubtful if the Var
sity excelled its opponents, but the
Cardinal forwards hooked the ball
out of the scrum with greatest ease.
Several former Stanford football
lights bolstered the Olympic fifteen.

Haley, Sundell, Miller, Partridge, Ar
rel, and Trowbridge all wore the
winged "O."
Ariel figured in a scoring feat
rivaling that of Dingley. When Erb
attempted to drop a goal from near
midfield, Guerin blocked, and Arrel
swooped upon the ball. Showing un
dreamt of speed, he sprinted half the
length of the field, with no one to
head him and several of his own team
following up closely to receive a pass
should necessity arise.
For the Varsity, Cass, Kisling, Kern
and Schaupp played stellar rugby.
Erb's touch boots during most of the
game were admirable. Dingley's try
was a splendidly executed piece of
work. This Freshman is as yet the
only one of his class to show near-
Varsity form; he is a player much
on tlie type of his fellow-townsman,
Templet on.
The (Â«ame.
In the opening period Stanford had
the advantage of the Olympic team,
though the clubmen played a defen
sive fame of the first water. On the
return of the kickoff Miller marked at
his own 40. but missed his kick and
Risling found touch at 35. After a
long put Miller kicked poorly to his
15. Here Bly secured the ball, also
a try. Erb failed to convert. Score,
Stanford, 3, Olympics, 0.
The ball now seemed bent on ex
ploring regions dangerously near the
Stanford line, but Cass in a pretty
kick found touch at 35. A moment
later his touch boot again stopped
the Olympic offense.
Using largely touch-kicking and
rucking, Stanford now advanced the
ball far into Olympic territory, and
