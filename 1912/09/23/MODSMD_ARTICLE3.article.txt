# VARSITY TAKES MATCH IN LIGHTNING FINISH
## Freshmen Defeated 8-0 by Berkeley High School in Preliminary Contest Saturday Afternoon. 
### 
The finale of Saturday's Stanford-
Olympic match was constructed ex
actly 0,l ihe formula of the usual
piece of football fiction. With only
a few more minutes of play and the
home team losing, the Freshman,
Dingley, is put into the game; tear
ing down the turf he springs into the
air, catches a pretty cross-kic c from
Captain Cass, swerves past Olym
pic fullback, scores a try, and saves
tiie day. 6-5, with the tag of the
the day. 6-5, with the Cardinal on the
Cardinal on the long end, was the
score in the hard fought contest of
Saturday.
Despite tlie sensational finish, Cap
tain Cass had not quite the same
reason to be proud of his team that
he had a week ago. The skipper him
self never showed to better advan
tage. His generalship, his pass, ana
his defensive work, were all that
could lie desired. But the backs be
hind him did not figure in the splen
did passing rushes that characterized
the recent Barbarian game. For one
thing, the forwards monopolized the
ball much of the time; but when it
did come to the backs, they had a
tendency to ruin their chances by
poor passing or by being out of posi
tion to receive the pass. The hard
accurate tackling was also less in
evidence.
As a whole the game was well
fought, both teams being good on de
fensive work, scrumming and rucking,
and following the ball. In the latter
point it is very doubtful if the Var
sity excelled its opponents, but the
Cardinal forwards hooked the ball
out of the scrum with greatest ease.
Several former Stanford football
lights bolstered the Olympic fifteen.

Haley, Sundell, Miller, Partridge, Ar
rel, and Trowbridge all wore the
winged "O."
Ariel figured in a scoring feat
rivaling that of Dingley. When Erb
attempted to drop a goal from near
midfield, Guerin blocked, and Arrel
swooped upon the ball. Showing un
dreamt of speed, he sprinted half the
length of the field, with no one to
head him and several of his own team
following up closely to receive a pass
should necessity arise.
For the Varsity, Cass, Kisling, Kern
and Schaupp played stellar rugby.
Erb's touch boots during most of the
game were admirable. Dingley's try
was a splendidly executed piece of
work. This Freshman is as yet the
only one of his class to show near-
Varsity form; he is a player much
on tlie type of his fellow-townsman,
Templet on.
The («ame.
In the opening period Stanford had
the advantage of the Olympic team,
though the clubmen played a defen
sive fame of the first water. On the
return of the kickoff Miller marked at
his own 40. but missed his kick and
Risling found touch at 35. After a
long put Miller kicked poorly to his
15. Here Bly secured the ball, also
a try. Erb failed to convert. Score,
Stanford, 3, Olympics, 0.
The ball now seemed bent on ex
ploring regions dangerously near the
Stanford line, but Cass in a pretty
kick found touch at 35. A moment
later his touch boot again stopped
the Olympic offense.
Using largely touch-kicking and
rucking, Stanford now advanced the
ball far into Olympic territory, and
when Austin in a long boot stopped
the advance ot' the red-jerseyed line,
Hariigan marked at 40.
The usual scoreless wanderings and
meanderings of the ball now occupied
the attention of the players till half
time. Shortly before the gun was
tired, Erb, in regular Floyd Brown
style, ran the ball through the loose
from the club's 30 to its 10 yard line.
After lineouts near the final mark
Trowbridge was forced to save, and
the half ended with the ball on Olym
pic 30. Stanford, 3, Olympics, 0.
Second Half.
This period found the teams fight
ing tooth and nail and the play was
faster than in the initial period. A
few changes in the club lineup and
numerous ones in that of Stanford,
occurred during the half. The fea
ture of the play was the whirlwind
finish, with the brilliant tries by Ar
rel and Dingley. At the pistol-shot
the pigskin was at Olympic 20. The
time of this half was 25 minutes,
while the first went the even half
hour.
The Stanford Band made its first
appearance and was welcomed hearti
ly by the appreciative bleachers.
Freshman Game.
In the first rugby performance of
the afternoon Stanford's youngest
hopefuls were squarely beaten, 8-0, by
the Berkeley High fifteen. The play
was fair but not startling, the Fresh
men's strongest point being the de
fensive game. Berkeley has an ex
cellent fifteen and it played real
rugby.
Early in the play Berkeley ad
vanced upon the Freshmen by means
of a passing rush, Anderson, Mont
gomery, Kay, Clopton to Knowles.
This play took the ball to Freshman
1.1. After a hard struggle in this
vicinity Knowles received the ball
from a lineout and went through the
thick of play to a try. Montgomery,
with Norton holding, added the extra
two points.
During the rest of the period the
Freshmen battled on more even
terms, and the ball was on their 40
at the end of play.
Near full time in the last period
came the second Berkeley try. After
an attempted field goal on a free
kick, Clopton secured the ball and
scored. A little later Lammiman by
good dodging and a boot worked the
ball to Berkeley forty, where it was
at the gun.

the advance ot' the red-jerseyed line,
Hariigan marked at 40.
The usual scoreless wanderings and
meanderings of the ball now occupied
the attention of the players till half
time. Shortly before the gun was
tired, Erb, in regular Floyd Brown
style, ran the ball through the loose
from the club's 30 to its 10 yard line.
After lineouts near the final mark
Trowbridge was forced to save, and
the half ended with the ball on Olym
pic 30. Stanford, 3, Olympics, 0.
Second Half.
This period found the teams fight
ing tooth and nail and the play was
faster than in the initial period. A
few changes in the club lineup and
numerous ones in that of Stanford,
occurred during the half. The fea
ture of the play was the whirlwind
finish, with the brilliant tries by Ar
rel and Dingley. At the pistol-shot
the pigskin was at Olympic 20. The
time of this half was 25 minutes,
while the first went the even half
hour.
The Stanford Band made its first
appearance and was welcomed hearti
ly by the appreciative bleachers.
Freshman Game.
In the first rugby performance of
the afternoon Stanford's youngest
hopefuls were squarely beaten, 8-0, by
the Berkeley High fifteen. The play
was fair but not startling, the Fresh
men's strongest point being the de
fensive game. Berkeley has an ex
cellent fifteen and it played real
rugby.
Early in the play Berkeley ad
vanced upon the Freshmen by means
of a passing rush, Anderson, Mont
gomery, Kay, Clopton to Knowles.
This play took the ball to Freshman
1.1. After a hard struggle in this
vicinity Knowles received the ball
from a lineout and went through the
thick of play to a try. Montgomery,
with Norton holding, added the extra
two points.
During the rest of the period the
Freshmen battled on more even
terms, and the ball was on their 40
at the end of play.
Near full time in the last period
came the second Berkeley try. After
an attempted field goal on a free
kick, Clopton secured the ball and
scored. A little later Lammiman by
good dodging and a boot worked the
ball to Berkeley forty, where it was
at the gun.
The line-ups:
Varsity — Sinclair, Bly (Single),
Hall (Corbett), Lull (Clover), Whita
ker (Jacomini), Gard, Schaupp, Tho
burn (Darsie), forwards; Cass, half;
Risling (Kern), Harrigan (A. Erb),
fives; Kern (Andrews), center three;
Noble, Templeton (Dingley), fings;

ridge, Arrel, Marisch, forwards; Flat

Higgins (Lunt), fives; Von Mander
sheid, center: Phillips, McKenzie,

Freshmen — Edwards (Kellogg),

(King), Dubendorf (Fisher), Brader.
(Bandini), Keast (Hayes), Bacon (Be

center three; Clopton (Lazarre).
wings: Jardine, full.
The finale of Saturday's Stanford-
Olympic match was constructed ex
actly 0,l ihe formula of the usual
piece of football fiction. With only
a few more minutes of play and the
home team losing, the Freshman,
Dingley, is put into the game; tear
ing down the turf he springs into the
air, catches a pretty cross-kic c from
Captain Cass, swerves past Olym
pic fullback, scores a try, and saves
tiie day. 6-5, with the tag of the
the day. 6-5, with the Cardinal on the
Cardinal on the long end, was the
score in the hard fought contest of
Saturday.
Despite tlie sensational finish, Cap
tain Cass had not quite the same
reason to be proud of his team that
he had a week ago. The skipper him
self never showed to better advan
tage. His generalship, his pass, ana
his defensive work, were all that
could lie desired. But the backs be
hind him did not figure in the splen
did passing rushes that characterized
the recent Barbarian game. For one
thing, the forwards monopolized the
ball much of the time; but when it
did come to the backs, they had a
tendency to ruin their chances by
poor passing or by being out of posi
tion to receive the pass. The hard
accurate tackling was also less in
evidence.
As a whole the game was well
fought, both teams being good on de
fensive work, scrumming and rucking,
and following the ball. In the latter
point it is very doubtful if the Var
sity excelled its opponents, but the
Cardinal forwards hooked the ball
out of the scrum with greatest ease.
Several former Stanford football
lights bolstered the Olympic fifteen.

Haley, Sundell, Miller, Partridge, Ar
rel, and Trowbridge all wore the
winged "O."
Ariel figured in a scoring feat
rivaling that of Dingley. When Erb
attempted to drop a goal from near
midfield, Guerin blocked, and Arrel
swooped upon the ball. Showing un
dreamt of speed, he sprinted half the
length of the field, with no one to
head him and several of his own team
following up closely to receive a pass
should necessity arise.
For the Varsity, Cass, Kisling, Kern
and Schaupp played stellar rugby.
Erb's touch boots during most of the
game were admirable. Dingley's try
was a splendidly executed piece of
work. This Freshman is as yet the
only one of his class to show near-
Varsity form; he is a player much
on tlie type of his fellow-townsman,
Templet on.
The («ame.
In the opening period Stanford had
the advantage of the Olympic team,
though the clubmen played a defen
sive fame of the first water. On the
return of the kickoff Miller marked at
his own 40. but missed his kick and
Risling found touch at 35. After a
long put Miller kicked poorly to his
15. Here Bly secured the ball, also
a try. Erb failed to convert. Score,
Stanford, 3, Olympics, 0.
The ball now seemed bent on ex
ploring regions dangerously near the
Stanford line, but Cass in a pretty
kick found touch at 35. A moment
later his touch boot again stopped
the Olympic offense.
Using largely touch-kicking and
rucking, Stanford now advanced the

The finale of Saturday's Stanford-
Olympic match was constructed ex
actly 0,l ihe formula of the usual
piece of football fiction. With only
a few more minutes of play and the
home team losing, the Freshman,
Dingley, is put into the game; tear
ing down the turf he springs into the
air, catches a pretty cross-kic c from
Captain Cass, swerves past Olym
pic fullback, scores a try, and saves
tiie day. 6-5, with the tag of the
the day. 6-5, with the Cardinal on the
Cardinal on the long end, was the
score in the hard fought contest of
Saturday.
Despite tlie sensational finish, Cap
tain Cass had not quite the same
reason to be proud of his team that
he had a week ago. The skipper him
self never showed to better advan
tage. His generalship, his pass, ana
his defensive work, were all that
could lie desired. But the backs be
hind him did not figure in the splen
did passing rushes that characterized
the recent Barbarian game. For one
thing, the forwards monopolized the
ball much of the time; but when it
did come to the backs, they had a
tendency to ruin their chances by
poor passing or by being out of posi
tion to receive the pass. The hard
accurate tackling was also less in
evidence.
As a whole the game was well
fought, both teams being good on de
fensive work, scrumming and rucking,
and following the ball. In the latter
point it is very doubtful if the Var
sity excelled its opponents, but the
Cardinal forwards hooked the ball
out of the scrum with greatest ease.
Several former Stanford football
lights bolstered the Olympic fifteen.

Haley, Sundell, Miller, Partridge, Ar
rel, and Trowbridge all wore the
winged "O."
Ariel figured in a scoring feat
rivaling that of Dingley. When Erb
attempted to drop a goal from near
midfield, Guerin blocked, and Arrel
swooped upon the ball. Showing un
dreamt of speed, he sprinted half the
length of the field, with no one to
head him and several of his own team
following up closely to receive a pass
should necessity arise.
For the Varsity, Cass, Kisling, Kern
and Schaupp played stellar rugby.
Erb's touch boots during most of the
game were admirable. Dingley's try
was a splendidly executed piece of
work. This Freshman is as yet the
only one of his class to show near-
Varsity form; he is a player much
on tlie type of his fellow-townsman,
Templet on.
The («ame.
In the opening period Stanford had
the advantage of the Olympic team,
though the clubmen played a defen
sive fame of the first water. On the
return of the kickoff Miller marked at
his own 40. but missed his kick and
Risling found touch at 35. After a
long put Miller kicked poorly to his
15. Here Bly secured the ball, also
a try. Erb failed to convert. Score,
Stanford, 3, Olympics, 0.
The ball now seemed bent on ex
ploring regions dangerously near the
Stanford line, but Cass in a pretty
kick found touch at 35. A moment
later his touch boot again stopped
the Olympic offense.
Using largely touch-kicking and
rucking, Stanford now advanced the
ball far into Olympic territory, and
when Austin in a long boot stopped
the advance ot' the red-jerseyed line,
Hariigan marked at 40.
The usual scoreless wanderings and
meanderings of the ball now occupied
the attention of the players till half
time. Shortly before the gun was
tired, Erb, in regular Floyd Brown
style, ran the ball through the loose
from the club's 30 to its 10 yard line.
After lineouts near the final mark
Trowbridge was forced to save, and
the half ended with the ball on Olym
pic 30. Stanford, 3, Olympics, 0.
Second Half.
This period found the teams fight
ing tooth and nail and the play was
faster than in the initial period. A
few changes in the club lineup and
numerous ones in that of Stanford,
occurred during the half. The fea
ture of the play was the whirlwind
finish, with the brilliant tries by Ar
rel and Dingley. At the pistol-shot
the pigskin was at Olympic 20. The
time of this half was 25 minutes,
while the first went the even half
hour.
The Stanford Band made its first
appearance and was welcomed hearti
ly by the appreciative bleachers.
Freshman Game.
In the first rugby performance of
the afternoon Stanford's youngest
hopefuls were squarely beaten, 8-0, by
the Berkeley High fifteen. The play
was fair but not startling, the Fresh
men's strongest point being the de
fensive game. Berkeley has an ex
cellent fifteen and it played real
rugby.
Early in the play Berkeley ad
vanced upon the Freshmen by means
of a passing rush, Anderson, Mont
gomery, Kay, Clopton to Knowles.
This play took the ball to Freshman
1.1. After a hard struggle in this
vicinity Knowles received the ball
from a lineout and went through the
thick of play to a try. Montgomery,
with Norton holding, added the extra
two points.
During the rest of the period the
Freshmen battled on more even
terms, and the ball was on their 40
at the end of play.
Near full time in the last period
came the second Berkeley try. After
an attempted field goal on a free
kick, Clopton secured the ball and
scored. A little later Lammiman by
good dodging and a boot worked the
ball to Berkeley forty, where it was
at the gun.
