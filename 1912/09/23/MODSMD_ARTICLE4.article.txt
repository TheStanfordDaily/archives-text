# "RAMBLING RAMESES" CAST IS NOT YET COMPLETED.
## 
### 
Contrary to the general belief, the
tryouts for the Ram's Head produc
tion for October 18 have not closed.
The next rehearsal will be held Wed
nesday evening in room 68.
From the first tryouts much avail
able material has been found. The
dancing of some of the men was es
pecially pleasing to the committee and
promises to be a big feature in the
coming show. All parts in this
comic opera are to be taken by men
and large choruses are to be the rule.
Fifteen musical numbers written by
local talent will be played by the en
larged Ram's Head orchestra. Try
outs for this orchestra will be held
Wednesday afternoon at 4:30 in room
fiB.
The plot of the play has been
finished to a nicety and around it
much good comedy and lively situa
tions are promised. From the past,
reputation of the Ram's Head Society
the public can expect a finished pro
duction along unusual lines on the
evening of October 18.
Several of the leading parts have
already been assigned to members of
Ram's Head.
