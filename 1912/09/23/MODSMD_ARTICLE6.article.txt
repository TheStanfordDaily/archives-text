I>en of Virgil Bellows, '09, make the
Fall number of the Chaparral a trea
sury of artistic decorations for den
or parlor. The work of Bellows has
been reproduced from the best of his
former efforts and consists of a
frontispiece of a girl in furs, and
three more sketches of attractive
feminity, entitled "An Argument for
Coeducation," "The Last Examina
tion," and "Some Stunning Things in
Polka Dots."
As a tribute to the author of these
Stanford masterpieces, L. S. Levy, '08,
has written the initial poem, eulo
gizing the name of Bellows, who met
his death on the waters of Lake Erie
this summer. The pages of this
issue of "Chappie" have been devoted
chiefly to the memory of the dead
artist. Levy has assumed the role of
wielder of "Chappie's" hammer and
written a "Now That" on the friend
ship and character of the man while
Editor M. T. Dooling, writes in appre
ciation of Bellows' ability.
L. D. Summerfleld, '12, has contri
buted an appropriate Dilettante de
picting the present plight of many
first-year girls. A narrative in slang,
illustrated by J. L. Duff. '13, has been
sent in by the same writer. "Queenit
ihe Queer" or "Look Before You Peep"
is a seasonal story containing a moral
for many of the women students and
a point of thrilling interest for the
men. This style of work is an inno
vation in the columns of the Hammer
and Coffin publication and is sure to
make a hit with "Chappie's" readers.
Five pages, replete with clever car
toons and sketches, snappy epigrams,
and mirthful repartee, complete the
make-up of the number. J. L. Duff,
'13, N. M. Manning, '13, Miss M. Bailey,
'14. M. W. Allen, '15, and M. A. Oliver,
'15, have their initials labelling the
humorous cuts. Jingling verse and
short jokes are the product of L. S.
Levy, '08, H. H. Beall, *11, M. E.
Mitchell, '11, E. W. Pugh, '11, P. M.
Levy, '12, A. M. Standish, '14, A. T.
Cluff. '14, M. A. Hagen, '15, W. F. Kil
cline. '15, and H. Levy, '16.
Editorial comment of public interest
deals with the Bookstore policy of
not keeping supplies in stock, and the
difficulties of being a humorist. An
invitation is extended to aspirants
for staff positions to turn in material.
The edition goes on sale tomorrow
morning at the usual price.
