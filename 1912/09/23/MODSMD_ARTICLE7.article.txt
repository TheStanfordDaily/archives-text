# California Defeats Barbarians.
## 
### 
Weakened by the loss of several of
their star players the Barbarians, who
are to be the next opponents of the
Cardinal Varsity, fell easy prey to the
onslaughts of California Saturday af
ternoon. The final score of 16 to 0
did not represent the exact strength of
the rival fifteens, as the collegians
should have recorded a much larger
score. Coach Schaeffer shifted his
men considerably. Captain Stroud
again appeared at breakaway.
