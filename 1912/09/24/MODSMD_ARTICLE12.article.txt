# Rugby Notes.
## 
### 
The rugby squad yesterday began
the fourth week of training, with a
record for condition that is unusually
good. At the present time there is no
one off the field with a serious injury,
the minor bruises and strains being
taken care of at the training quarters.
13. A. Risling, "I~>, was painfully
bruised near the left eye in Saturday's
game. The bruised flesh affected the
interior muscles of the eye, and this
will keep the speedy five riff the field
for a day or so.
