# Caught Smoking!
## 
### 
Nearly every semester the Daily
prints an editorial upon smoking on
the Quad. This year our most enter-

prising reporters have
failed to observe a viola
tion of this custom among
the students. But two

members of the faculty liave been
seen smoking in their offices in build
ings on the Quad. We know of 110
exception to this custom for members
of the faculty, and we ask for the
cooperation of these delinquent ones
in preserving this, the oldest custom
of Stanford University.
