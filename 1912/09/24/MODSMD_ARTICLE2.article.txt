### 
Failure to receive word of the
whereabouts of T. W. Thompson, '12,
P. H. Cox, '12, and A. B. Packard, '11,
who recently left for Nicaraugua, has
occasioned friends of the men on the
campus grave concern.
\latagalpi, where the men expect to
engage in mining engineering work,
is in the center of revolutionary ac
tivity in Nicaraugua at present. Xo
word has been received from the men
since they left Corinto, seperal weeks
ago. At that time they expected to
have to make a detour to reach Mata
galpi.
