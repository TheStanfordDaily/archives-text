# Communication.
## 
### 
In another column we print a
communication from an alumnus in
regard to the proposed suggestion that

a new name be
adopted lor the

Daily. The article
is well worth reading, coming as it
does from an authority on early Stan
ford history. We will be glad to
print communications for or against
the proposed change of name from any
student, alumnus, member of the fa
culty, or anyone interested in the
University.
