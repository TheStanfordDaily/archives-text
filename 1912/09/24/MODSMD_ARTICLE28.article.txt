The name of a periodical should be
distinctive, significant, characteristic,
euphoenous, intelligible, unique it' pos
sible, and not lopsided.
During the last fifteen years "The
Daily Palo Alto," as a newspaper title,
has not adequately fulfilled some of
these requirements. Repeatedly the
explanation has to be made that "The
Daily Palo Alto" is the Stanford daily
paper, not published at Palo Alto but
on the university campus, which is
apart from the town.
As I happened to have been the
original advocate of the present name
of the Daily the suggestion of a change
can not be attributed, as it might with
an undergraduate, to a ruthless desire
to alter a tradition. Others advocated
"Palo Altan," which was balanced, but
it omitted the proud fact that we had
a daily and it sought to give an Eng
lish termination to a Spanish phrase.
Stanford's earliest periodicals took
their names from the Palo Alto tree,
as did the Palo Alto farm. That tree
is a California redwood. Because of
its appearance as a land-mark the
early Spanish gave it the name Palo
Alto, meaning tall pole. The scientific
name for the California redwood is
Sequoia Sempirvirens: hence the name
of "Sequoia" for Stanford's literary
monthly. To call it Stanford Sequoia
would be better yet.
When the daily started we used a
great many small items, such as are
generally called "Locals." For two
reasons we chose the name "Quads"
for such bits of news. The quad
rangle, or quad, was distinctive of
the new university's manner of group
ing buildings; and in printer's par
lance a quad is a big slug used to
create a white space between letters.
The regular use of the word Quad
in the Daily during the University's
second year was one of the impelling
reasons for our selection late in that
year of the name "The Stanford Quad"
as the title of the first junior annual,
quad also signifying four and suggest
ing a class generation and its product.
A "The" was purposely prefixed to
give the name typographical balance
in display type.
After the death of "Josh" a second
humorous periodical was started in
the ninth year of the university and
it was given a distinctively western
nameâ€”'The Chaparral." But that
name is not characteristic of anything
pertaining to Stanford or its location.
If a good joke be reprinted anywhere
from "The Chaparral" very few read
ers associate that name with Stan
ford. Perhaps a more characteristic
name would have been Stanford Man
zanita, the manzanita growing on the
campus and meaning in Spanish little
apple. It is a remarkably crooked and
eccentric growth, with a real red bark
to it.
Having suggested the significance in
publication names, 1 now submit as
possible substitutes for "The Daily
Palo Alto," the following:
"Stanford Sundown."
"Stanford Daily."
"The Stanford Spirit."
Personally I prefer "Stanford Sun
down," because the daily is an even
ing paper; because sundown signifies
daily and evening and far western;
because, while there are "Suns" and
"Stars" galore, there is no "Sun
down"; and because the word balances
with Stanford, and the title has eu
phony and the force of alliteration.
