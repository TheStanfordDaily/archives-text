# Hall Men Make Annual Pajama Show.
## 
### 
Clad in garments not usually seen |
, | out of doors and accompanied by a
I weird collection of both vocal and in-
I strnmental noise-making instruments,
the men of Encina Hall last evening
held their annual "Pajama Pee-rade." .
Long had the men waited for (he first 1
full moon and they were well re- j
j warded, for the night was perfect, j
Fully two hundred students braved the j
warm air and the stares of the rest j
of the campus. As of yore, the white- ]
robed men paraded from the Hall,
passed the front of the Quad to Roble,
where a fantastic serpentine was
danced on the lawn. Then on to the
j Row went the long lino. Up stairs,
around porches, and across lawns
they went, ending up by a, dash
through Wilson's 1o home. A pause
was made at the Zeta Psi house to
cheer Captain L. Cass, '13. of the foot
l ball team.
