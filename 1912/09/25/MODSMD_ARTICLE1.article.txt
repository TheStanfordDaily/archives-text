# PALO ALTO WALLOPS FRESHMAN FIFTEEN
## SUBSTITUTE GAME PROVIDES A SNAPPY CONTEST. High School Lads Again Meet 1916 Team on the Turf Field. 
### 
Final Score:
Palo Alto, 10; Freshmen, C.
Mumps, plain prosaic mumps, was
the cause which gave Palo Alto au
other chance to wallop the Freshmen
this afternoon. A prevalence of this
malady at Belmont made it impos
sible for the military school fifteen
to journey to the campus, so at the
eleventh hour the local high school
fifteen went in to till the breach. The
Palo Altans took the field with all
but three of their regular first team
players.
The Freshmen assumed the aggres
sive more than has been their custom
against this fifteen, and the contest
was more even than previous ones.
Nevertheless, the Freshmen have still
much to learn from the Palo Alto
rugbyites.
Throughout the first half the high
school lads had the advantage of Stan
ford's young hopefuls, though toward
the last of the period the Freshmen
confined play to the enemy's territory
and fought desperately for the try.
Davidson's second score, a splendidly
executed performance, was the fen
ture of the half.
First Half.
McGilvray kicked off for Palo Alto,
the ball going to touch at the 5 yard
line. Dribbling from lineouts carried
the play to center. A short kick to
touch and a lucky dribble gained 25
yards for Palo Alto. The Freshmen
were awarded a free kick, but gained
only 10 yards by kicking to touch.
From a scrum in front of the goal
posts, a passing rush sent Davidson
over for a try. McGilvray converted.
After the kickoff, play went immedi
ately to the high school 20 yard line.
Davidson saved for Palo Alto when
the Freshmen pulled off a short pass
ing rush. The pack was sent to mid
field where good booting by the high
school players took the ball to the
Stanford 25. From a 25 yard lineout,
Davidson took the ball and ran
through a scattered field to the Fresh
man goal. McGilvray converted. On the
kickoff play returned to center. Lam
miman secured the ball in the loose
and dodged ahead for 10 yards. Palo
Alto smothered several passing rushes
and after being awarded a free kick,
forced the play out of their danger
zone. From a4O yard lineout, Braden
went ahead for 25 yards nefore being
downed . Loose passing again lost
ground for the Freshmen.
Second Half.
The Freshmen came on the field
with one change in their lineup,
Urban going in at wing. One minute
of play saw the pigskin over the
Palo Alto line for the first try, Bacon
going across from a one yard scrum.
Edwards failed to convert.
A broken passing rush gained
ground again for the Cardinal babies.
Pally fried punting, but the Fresh
men cut in and forced them to save.
