An ugly wooden bench is now calmly
reposing beneath the cloistered arches

in front of the Business
Office. One of the most
noticeable features of the
original architectural

schemes of the Quad was that all
temporary wooden structures of all
kinds were omitted. If a bench is
needed at this place it should be of
stone, but it does not seem as if there
is a want for one at this point. There
are plenty of places on the farm for
the University employees to rest in
stead of in full view of the students
going to classes. If benches are de
sired on the Quad we recommend that
they be placed where they will be
more convenient for the students.
