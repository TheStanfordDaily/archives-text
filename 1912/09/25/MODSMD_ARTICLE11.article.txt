# Ten Dollar Prize.
## 
### 
On several occasions in the past
there have been sporadic attempts to
change the name of this publication.

The trouble has been to
find a suitable name. In
order to stimulate more
interest in the present

attempt, the Daily Palo Alto offers a
prize of ten dollars to any one sug
gesting a suitable name. This offer
is open to all, whether connected with
the University in any way or not.
There will be no restrictions as to
the number of names that may be sub
mitted by any one person. A list of
the proposed names will be published
in the columns of this paper from time
to time.
