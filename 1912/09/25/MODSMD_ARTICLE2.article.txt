# ASSOCIATED STUDENT BODY FUNDS ARE SAFE
## MANAGER BURBANK'S REPORT ALLAYS FEARS. From Present Indications Palo Alto Building and Loan Will Pay Up in Full. 
### 
Reports iu the San Francisco papers
that the Associated Students would be
hard hit by the financial troubles of
thp Palo Alto Building and Loan Asso
ciation, caused no little excitement on
the campus this morning. But the
Student Body need have no fear of
suffering any loss unless the situation
in Palo Alto shows a very unexpected
development. The following state
ment by Graduate Manager D. W.
Burbank should serve to clear up
matters as least as far as the Student
Body treasury is concerned.
"The present difticnlty of the Palo
Alto Building and Loan Association
will have no immediate effect on the
Associated Students. Our checking
balance with the Rank of Palo Alto is
today $3,885.07, which is larger than it
has been at this time for three years.
On June the close of our last fiscal
year, we had no bills payable. At
present we owe only current bills and
$7.10 due on the Australian guarantee.
"At the end of the last fiscal year
we had $0,000 deposited with the Palo
Alio Building and Loan Association sit
0 per cent, interest on deposit certifi
cates. (Mi September 7, I withdrew
$2,000 after having given thirty days'
notice.
The remaining $1,000 may be con
sidered in the nature of a reserve and
flic fact that we are unable to with
draw it.it once need not cause any
worry. The Stanford Union has $11,-
000 on deposit under the same con
ditions as the Student Body's $1,000."
The situation of the Palo Alto
Building and Loan Association will
be problematical until the commis
sioners final report is made, which will
show not only the definite amount of
the shortage but also the value of thb
property turned over by Marshall
Black. Up to last night but $40,000
shortage had been located, which sum
is practically covered by guaranteed
stock amounting to $17,000, a cash
reserve of $11,000, and Black's bond
of $10,000, making a toal of $38,000.
As the company's investments are
reported to be good there seems to be
no reason why it will not be able to
pay out in full, if the deficit doe* not
exceed $100,000 and if there are no
steps taken to put the concern in
bankruptcy or immediate liquidation.
