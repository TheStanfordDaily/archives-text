# BISHOP NICHOLS TALKS ON MISSIONARY WORK.
## 
### 
"The best missionary meeting any
of us can attend is one all alone with
ourselves." This was the theme of
Bishop Nichols' talk to the Young
Women's Christian Association yester
day afternoon.
He described "My Mission" as the
responsibility of realising "my per
sonality and the sphere of my in
fluence." Tn this way he related a
missionary topic to college life.
