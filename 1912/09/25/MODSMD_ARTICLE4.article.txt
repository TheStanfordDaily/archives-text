# GRAYS TROUNCE BLACKS IN PRACTICE SCRIMMAGE
## PRACTICALLY ENTIRE SQUAD IS DRILLED BY COACH. Rugby Candidates Show Decided Improvement in Field Work During Snappy Game. 
### 
In twenty minutes of snappy rugby
the Varsity Grays lined up against the
Blacks yesterday afternoon. Five trys
were negotiated by the Grays, Erb con
verting on the only occasion when an
attempt was made to add the extra
two points. Coach Presley was on
hand and, as usual, infused the men
«ith additional vigor.
This set-to inaugurated the regular
Tuesday-Thursday scrummages, and
112 dlowcd upon the cut of Monday when
the squad was reduced to six teams,
four Varsity and two Freshmen. All
the Varsity players got into the game
yesterday.
While play, as has been the rule
this season, was largely confined to
the forward division, the Gray back
field made use of a few small passing
rushes to advance the ball.
The first try came when, at the
Black 30, Cass passed to Harrigan who
went through the loose for a try.
Erb converted. Kern was responsible
for the next two trys. The style of
this player seems to be well suited to
the important second five position, and
he gained many yards for the Grays.
. :i the second period the Gray sub
stitutes added two more trys.
The line-ups:
Crays — Corbett (Skinner), Bly
(Peck), Single (Sinclair), Clover
(Whitaker), Hall (Jacomini), Gard
(Bloeser), Lull (Thoburn), Thoburn
(Darsie), forwards: Cass (Burns),
