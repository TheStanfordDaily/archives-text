# NEW STUDENT INVITED TO ANNUAL LAW SMOKER.
## 
### 
The annual Law Smoker will be
given on the night of October 2 at the
Stanford Inn. The smoker will be
held in honor of the new pre-legal
and law majors, as is the custom.
The date has been set unusually
early in order that every member of
the law school may be able to attend,
before strict training rules go into
effect. The idea of a smoker is a
novelty initiated by the law students,
as no other department in the Univer
sity gives such an entertainment to
the new men.
A musical program is being ar
ranged by the committee in charge,
consisting of M. T. Dooling, '11, chair
man, F. L. Guerena, *11, and E. W.
Pugh, '11. The members of the law
facility and prominent, students of the
department will be among the
speakers. Smokes and eats in abund
ance will be handed out to all who
attend.
