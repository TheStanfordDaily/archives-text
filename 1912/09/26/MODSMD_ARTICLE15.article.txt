# NOVEMBER 15 IS DATE OF UNIVERSITY JOLLY-UP
## Entire Student Body Will Get Together at Informal Gathering Week After Big Game. 
### 
Friday evening, November 15, is the
date set by the Soniors for a Univer
sity Jolly-ni) to be staged in the Palo
Alto Armory.
Two years ago the 1911 class in
augurated this custom of having an
informal function in which every
member of the Student Body, from
freshman to graduate, could partici
pate, and the affair was a decided
success. Last year a jolly-up for the
upper classes only was given. After
viewing the result of these two ex
periments the 1913 class has decided
that the larger event is the better as
it gives every member of the Univer
sity a chance to get acquainted. Pre
sident Argabrite will appoint the
committees this week to take charge
of the jolly-up. No expense will be
spared to make the affair such a suc
cess that this event will come to be
one of the permanent events on the
University Calendar.
The date chosen is the ideal time of
the semester for such an occasion,
being one week after the Big Game,
when the football men are out of
training and at the same time not too
near the end of the semester to inter
fere with the final examinations.
In addition to the jolly-up discus
sion, several matters of minor impor
tance were transacted at the Senior
Class meeting this afternoon. The
treasurer's report showed a balance
on hand of $180.00. An auditing com
mittee, composed of L. Childs, chair
man, W. P. Butcher and C. E. Beeclier,
was appointed to go over the books
and turn them over to the new trea
surer. Tn preparation for the Senior
Week expenses an assessment of fifty
cents was levied on the members of
the class.
