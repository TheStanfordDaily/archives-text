### 
Encased in a handsome new cover,
tiie work of Randal Borough, '04, the
Stanford Alumnus for the month of
September will make its appearance
on the campus tomorrow. The num
ber is the first of the college year and
is replete with interesting articles
concerning the work of former stu
dents.
"The Eating Club Houses in Opera
tion," "The Executive Committee
Program," "The Advisory Board's
Achievements," "The Actions of the
Hoard of Trustees," an account of the
formation of alumni associations this
summer, a story on the final cam
paign for the Stanford Union, a re
view of the work of the crew at
Poughkeepsie by F. L. Guerena, '11,
an announcement and summary of the
English Club play by Miss M. Dris
coll, '13, the account of President
Jordan's recent trip through the
South, and a review of the athletic
events and prospects for the year by
K. L. Schaupp, '12, make up the main
articles in the issue.
The frontispiece shows the new
eating clubhouses, around the "Little
Quad" across from the southern end
of Encina Hall. These clubhouses
were largely the result of the efforts
of members of the alumni.
Editor E. W. Smith, '99, tells of the
satisfactory condition of the Univer
sity on its twenty-first birthday and
says President Jordan is thoroughly
right in calling this the Golden Age
of Stanford. Smith also predicts that
tangible results of the four-year old
Union campaign will be witnessed
this year. He says the alumni will
also carry a number of proposed help
ful plans to definite and satisfactory
conclusions.
Six pages of Alumni Notes are In
this issue. Over two pages of these
are devoted to a list of the weddings
and engagements which occurred
among Stanford graduates during the
past summer. The balance consists of
items concerning different members
of the Alumni Associations through
out the country.
Borough's cover design is a very
neat piece of work. On the center of
the page is a rectangle. Tn this is a.
section of the Inner Quad seen
through an arch. The cover is on
colors and the red tiles of the roof,
the gray of the stones and the white
of the walks and flowers stand out in
splendid relief. Mr. Borough is a well
known San Francisco artist.
