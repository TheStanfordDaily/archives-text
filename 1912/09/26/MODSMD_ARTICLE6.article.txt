# MANY OLD FAVORITES WILL AGAIN BE SEEN IN "AN IDEAL HUSBAND"
## All is in Readiness for the English Club's Comedy of Friday Evening. 
### 
Miss I. Bullis, '13, and E. A. Wells,
'14, will be seen playing the leading
roles in "An Ideal Husband" on Fri
day evening. Around them the action
of the play centers.
Miss Bullis will play the part of
Lady Chiltern, the idolizing and loving
wife of Sir Robert. In the part of Sir
Robert Chiltern, Wells is given the
opportunity to display his ability as a
"leading" man, and from last evening's
dress-rehearsal showing will fulfill
the highest expectations.
The work of Miss Bullis is well
known to the local stage devotees.
Her work in the "Devil's Disciple,"
"Fanny's Relations," and "Compro
mise" was all of the best character
and is still fresh in the minds of many.
W. B. Owen, '14, is excellently cast
in the part of Viscount Goring, and
has clearly shown his ability to handle
this part in faultless fashion. Owen
has already appeared in "Compromise"
and "The Admirable Crichton," in
which he did exceptional work. Miss
M. Driscoll, '13, plays the part of
Mrs. Cheveley, an adventuress, and in
this role has more than pleased Coach
P. L. Mathieu.
Miss E. Taff, '15, as Miss Mabel
Chiltern, and Miss C. Greeu, '14, play
ing the part of Mrs. Marchmont, have
both appeared before on the Assembly
Hall stage to good advantage.
In this four-act comedy Coach Ma
thieu has been given a well selected
cast and from it he has developed and
rounded into shape a finished piece.
With new scenery and electric light
ing devices the play promises to be
well staged.


E. A. Wells, *14, and Miss I. Bullis, *13.
