# BARBS AND ST. MARY'S WILL OPPOSE CARDINAL
## CLUBMEN VS. VARSITY SHOULD PROVE GOOD CONTEST. Barbs' Lineup Strengthened Since Defeat by California—St. Mary's and Freshmen Meet. 
### 
Barbarian Black meets Stanford
Cardinal in a second set-to tomorrow
afternoon. As a preliminary, the
Freshmen will play the fifteen from
St. Mary's.
The Barbarian contest will chiefly
interest the fans as showing a work
out of the Varsity with several
changes in the lineup. When the first
scrum is formed, Corbett, Single and
Darsie will be found in the pack. The
illness of Schaupp, Bly, Sanborn and
Thoburn makes necessary these
changes At center three-quarters
Reeves will he seen for the first time
this year. This veteran of the 1010
season has heretofore been kept out
of hard workouts by a year old injury
to his knee, but tomorrow it is hoped
that he will demonstrate his ability
to "come back" after his enforced
period of absence from the lineup.
Kern will again be moved nearer to
the scrum and will perform at second
five, which berth he seems to find a
very comfortable fit. In practice
scrimmages he, has played stellar
rugby in this position.
The varying strength of the Bar
barian fifteen on succeeding Satur
days will prevent the game from
forming an accurate gauge of the re
spective merits of the rival University
teams at this stage of the season.
California snowed the clubmen under
last Saturday, rolling up a score of
16-0. The goose-egg of the Barbs is
largely chargeable to their badly
shaken lineup, rather than to the su
periour playing of the opposing fifteen.
The contest was devoid of spectacular
work.
The lineup of the Barbarians for
tomorrow is problematical, but it will
probably include such men as Turtou,
Brown, Glasscock, and Rittler in the
scrum and Diavolo, McElrath, Smith
and Faulkner in the backfield. These
are experienced, hard-fighting players,
and may always be counted upon at
crucial moments. In the previous
Stanford-Barbarian game the clubmen
made the score of 8-0 spell hard work
for the Varsity.
Freshman Game.
Having severed athletic relations
with Santa Clara, the Catholic colle
gians from St. Mary's are determined
to make a good comparative showing
in preliminary games, and consequent
ly will prove a hard nut for the
Freshmen to crack tomorrow after
noon. Coach Otto Rittler of St. Mary's
is proud of his men this year, believing
them to compose a stronger fifteen
than that which defeated Santa Clara
last year. With either Moy or Roth
as a worthy successor to the formid
able Leonhardt at full, and such men
as Sullivan, Riordan, Lennon and Ma
gee to compose the offensive and de
fensive line back of the scrum, an
almost invincible scoring combination
seems assured. Sauer , a Cardinal
Freshman player of last year, will
probably play at back. Captain Gree
ley of the Catholic fifteen will be bol
stered in the scrum by the veteran
Tognazziui, and will have a squad of
twenty likely looking men from which
to pick the remaining forwards.
The games will begin at 2:30, and
will undoubtedly prove good enough
to compensate for the necessary loss
of fifty cents by spectators.
The lineups follow:
Varsity—Corbett, Single, Sinclair,
Smith, Hall, Gard, Lull and Darsie,
forwards; Cass, half; Harrigan and
Kern, fives; Reeves, center; Noble and
Templeton, wings; Erb, full.
Burhiirinns (probable)—Fyfe, Mc-
Nair, Hewitt, Mackenzie, Fairbanks,
Turton, Brown, Livingston, forwards;
Diavolo, half; Lopez, Belcher, fives;
Smith, center; Norton, Pomeroy,
wings; Faulkner, full.
Freshmen — Stephenson, Edwards,
Butterfleld, Dubendorf, Braden, Hayes,
Bacon, Cass, forwards; Brown, half;
Campbell and Adams, fives; Lammi
man, center; Laine and Urban, wings;
S. Brown, full.
St. Mary's—Greely, Hatt, Tognaz
ziui, Roth, Pappa, Randall, Bruzzone,
forwards; Cooney, half; Sauer, Sulli
van, fives; Townsend, center; Riordan
and Stolz, wings; Moy, full.

seems assured. Sauer , a Cardinal
Freshman player of last year, will
probably play at back. Captain Gree
ley of the Catholic fifteen will be bol
stered in the scrum by the veteran
Tognazziui, and will have a squad of
twenty likely looking men from which
to pick the remaining forwards.
The games will begin at 2:30, and
will undoubtedly prove good enough
to compensate for the necessary loss
of fifty cents by spectators.
The lineups follow:
Varsity—Corbett, Single, Sinclair,
Smith, Hall, Gard, Lull and Darsie,
forwards; Cass, half; Harrigan and
Kern, fives; Reeves, center; Noble and
Templeton, wings; Erb, full.
Burhiirinns (probable)—Fyfe, Mc-
Nair, Hewitt, Mackenzie, Fairbanks,
Turton, Brown, Livingston, forwards;
Diavolo, half; Lopez, Belcher, fives;
Smith, center; Norton, Pomeroy,
wings; Faulkner, full.
Freshmen — Stephenson, Edwards,
Butterfleld, Dubendorf, Braden, Hayes,
Bacon, Cass, forwards; Brown, half;
Campbell and Adams, fives; Lammi
man, center; Laine and Urban, wings;
S. Brown, full.
St. Mary's—Greely, Hatt, Tognaz
ziui, Roth, Pappa, Randall, Bruzzone,
forwards; Cooney, half; Sauer, Sulli
van, fives; Townsend, center; Riordan
and Stolz, wings; Moy, full.
Barbarian Black meets Stanford
Cardinal in a second set-to tomorrow
afternoon. As a preliminary, the
Freshmen will play the fifteen from
St. Mary's.
The Barbarian contest will chiefly
interest the fans as showing a work
out of the Varsity with several
changes in the lineup. When the first
scrum is formed, Corbett, Single and
Darsie will be found in the pack. The
illness of Schaupp, Bly, Sanborn and
Thoburn makes necessary these
changes At center three-quarters
Reeves will he seen for the first time
this year. This veteran of the 1010
season has heretofore been kept out
of hard workouts by a year old injury
to his knee, but tomorrow it is hoped
that he will demonstrate his ability
to "come back" after his enforced
period of absence from the lineup.
Kern will again be moved nearer to
the scrum and will perform at second
five, which berth he seems to find a
very comfortable fit. In practice
scrimmages he, has played stellar
rugby in this position.
The varying strength of the Bar
barian fifteen on succeeding Satur
days will prevent the game from
forming an accurate gauge of the re
spective merits of the rival University
teams at this stage of the season.
California snowed the clubmen under
last Saturday, rolling up a score of
16-0. The goose-egg of the Barbs is
largely chargeable to their badly
shaken lineup, rather than to the su
periour playing of the opposing fifteen.
The contest was devoid of spectacular
work.
The lineup of the Barbarians for
tomorrow is problematical, but it will
probably include such men as Turtou,
Brown, Glasscock, and Rittler in the
scrum and Diavolo, McElrath, Smith
and Faulkner in the backfield. These
are experienced, hard-fighting players,
and may always be counted upon at
crucial moments. In the previous
Stanford-Barbarian game the clubmen
made the score of 8-0 spell hard work
for the Varsity.
Freshman Game.
Having severed athletic relations
with Santa Clara, the Catholic colle
gians from St. Mary's are determined
to make a good comparative showing
in preliminary games, and consequent
ly will prove a hard nut for the
Freshmen to crack tomorrow after
noon. Coach Otto Rittler of St. Mary's
is proud of his men this year, believing
them to compose a stronger fifteen
than that which defeated Santa Clara
last year. With either Moy or Roth
as a worthy successor to the formid
able Leonhardt at full, and such men
as Sullivan, Riordan, Lennon and Ma
gee to compose the offensive and de
fensive line back of the scrum, an
almost invincible scoring combination
seems assured. Sauer , a Cardinal
Freshman player of last year, will
probably play at back. Captain Gree
ley of the Catholic fifteen will be bol
stered in the scrum by the veteran
Tognazziui, and will have a squad of
twenty likely looking men from which
to pick the remaining forwards.
The games will begin at 2:30, and
will undoubtedly prove good enough
