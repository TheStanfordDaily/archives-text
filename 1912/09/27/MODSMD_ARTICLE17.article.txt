Team No. 3, Argabrite's aggregation,
took another baseball game in the
Fall League series yesterday by a
score of 7 to 0. Team No. 2, piloted
by Terry, were the victims. The score
tells the tale of the one-sided con
test, which was called at the end of
the third on account of darkness.
Good slab work by Hayes, supported
by almost errorless playing, decided
the victory. Phillips essayed to do
the twirling for Terry's team but was
evidently suffering from stage fright,
for five runs were made in one inning
off him without a hit being registered.
Following are the figures:
R. H. E.
Team No. 3 7 4 1
Team No. 2 0 2 3
