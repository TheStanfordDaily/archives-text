# AUSTRALIANS TO ARRIVE OCTOBER 7
## Entire Student Body is Requested to Join in Giving Foreigners a Rousing Reception. 
### 
Monday, October 7, twenty-three
Australians, comprising the pick of
the Antipodean rugby players, will ar
rive on the Stanford campus. From
that date until Thursday, October 17,
they will be the guests of the Stan
ford Student Body. These men have
come six thousand miles across the
Pacific for the primary purpose of
engaging the strongest rugby teams
of the Pacific Coast, but like every
other group of men they are coming
with the expectations of having a
good time.
The California Rugby Union is the
body that has the tour of the Kan
garoos in charge, but it rests upon
the integral parts of this organization
to see to it that these visitors are
accorded a fitting reception. Two
years ago a team composed of players
from Stanford, California and Nevada
made a trip to the Antipodes and the
coining of the Australians is really in
the nature of a return visit.
Australians Are Koyal Hosts.
When the Americans invaded Aus
tralia they were welcomed in a way
that none of that team have ever for
gotten. From the time the Americans
landed in Australia until their depar
ture over a month later, they were the
guests of honor at one affair after
another. The day they arrived they
were each presented with a booklet
which contained a complete program
of their month's stay. Every morning,
afternoon and evening there was
something scheduled in their behalf.
Every member of that team is using
every effort to make this visit of the
Australians as much of a success as
was their reception to the Americans.

The people of San Francisco have
taken a great interest in the tour and
are doing everything possible to ex
tend to the foreigners a civic recep
tion that will long be remembered.
So great in fact has the interest in
San Francisco become that Mayor
Rolph has been in communication with
Mayor Alexander of Los Angeles to

have the latter official declare a holi
day when the Australians arrive in
the southern city so that the south
erners can give them the welcome
they deserve.
Student Body Must Help.
But it is upon the two universities,
Stanford and California, that, the duty
of entertaining the visitors will large
ly fall, for it was chiefly the repre
sentatives of these institutions that
made the trip to Australia and were
instrumental in bringing about the
visit of the Antipodeans to this coun
try. With the numerous facilities for
entertainment offered by the cities
around the bay, it will be much easier
for California to welcome the Austra
lians than it will for Stanford. The
local committee in charge of the en
tertainment, which is composed of F.
C. Brown, '11, E. F. Kern, '13, and
W. S. Wilson, '13, are doing every
thing possible to show the visitors
just as good a time as they will be
accorded in the city. But without the
co-operation of the entire student body
their efforts will be fruitless. No
definite and complete program has as
yet been arranged but several tenta
j live entertainments are under con
sideration. It is hoped that, an
' Assembly can be arranged for the
1 Tuesday after their arrival, at which
' the Australians will be formally wel-
I coined. Any ideas that the members
of the University have for the amuse-
I ment of the visitors are urgently
i solicited by the committee.
During their stay on the campus the
members of the team will be the
guests of the various fraternities, but
every member of the student body is
requested to assist in helping to repay
the visitors for the splendid reception
they accorded the Stanford represent
l atives in 1910.

The committee is also desirous that
the women of the University aid in the
entertainment of the Australians and
any offers or suggestions on the part
of the women will be gladly received
by the committee.

The people of San Francisco have
taken a great interest in the tour and
are doing everything possible to ex
tend to the foreigners a civic recep
tion that will long be remembered.
So great in fact has the interest in
San Francisco become that Mayor
Rolph has been in communication with
Mayor Alexander of Los Angeles to

have the latter official declare a holi
day when the Australians arrive in
the southern city so that the south
erners can give them the welcome
they deserve.

But it is upon the two universities,
Stanford and California, that, the duty
of entertaining the visitors will large
ly fall, for it was chiefly the repre
sentatives of these institutions that
made the trip to Australia and were
instrumental in bringing about the
visit of the Antipodeans to this coun
try. With the numerous facilities for
entertainment offered by the cities
around the bay, it will be much easier
for California to welcome the Austra
lians than it will for Stanford. The
local committee in charge of the en
tertainment, which is composed of F.
C. Brown, '11, E. F. Kern, '13, and
W. S. Wilson, '13, are doing every
thing possible to show the visitors
just as good a time as they will be
accorded in the city. But without the
co-operation of the entire student body
their efforts will be fruitless. No
definite and complete program has as
yet been arranged but several tenta
j live entertainments are under con
sideration. It is hoped that, an
' Assembly can be arranged for the
1 Tuesday after their arrival, at which
' the Australians will be formally wel-
I coined. Any ideas that the members
of the University have for the amuse-
I ment of the visitors are urgently
i solicited by the committee.
During their stay on the campus the
members of the team will be the
guests of the various fraternities, but
every member of the student body is
requested to assist in helping to repay
the visitors for the splendid reception
they accorded the Stanford represent
l atives in 1910.

The committee is also desirous that
the women of the University aid in the
entertainment of the Australians and
any offers or suggestions on the part
of the women will be gladly received
by the committee.
Monday, October 7, twenty-three
Australians, comprising the pick of
the Antipodean rugby players, will ar
rive on the Stanford campus. From
that date until Thursday, October 17,
they will be the guests of the Stan
ford Student Body. These men have
come six thousand miles across the
Pacific for the primary purpose of
engaging the strongest rugby teams
of the Pacific Coast, but like every
other group of men they are coming
with the expectations of having a
good time.
The California Rugby Union is the
body that has the tour of the Kan
garoos in charge, but it rests upon
the integral parts of this organization
to see to it that these visitors are
accorded a fitting reception. Two
years ago a team composed of players
from Stanford, California and Nevada
made a trip to the Antipodes and the
coining of the Australians is really in
the nature of a return visit.
Australians Are Koyal Hosts.
When the Americans invaded Aus
tralia they were welcomed in a way
that none of that team have ever for
gotten. From the time the Americans
landed in Australia until their depar
ture over a month later, they were the
guests of honor at one affair after
another. The day they arrived they
were each presented with a booklet
which contained a complete program
of their month's stay. Every morning,
afternoon and evening there was
something scheduled in their behalf.
Every member of that team is using
every effort to make this visit of the
Australians as much of a success as
was their reception to the Americans.
