# ORATORS PREPARE FOR INTERCOLLEGIATE DEBATE
## 
### 
With the tryouts for the Varsity de
bating team only one week off and the
debate set for the first of November,
debating activities are creating an
aroused interest in the followers of
oratory. Arrangements for the staging
of the intercollegiate forensic were
practically completed last evening,
when the Stanford Committee met
with the University of California De
bating Council.
At the request of the Stanford In
tercollegiate Committee, the Califor
nia Debating Council reconsidered the
question originally submitted for dis
cussion between the rival universities.
A certain ambiguity of expression was
detected in the official resolution that
might lead to difficulties at a later
time. The subject for debate as finally

framed, reads: "Resolved, That the
state of California should establish a
series of non-partisan, endowed, gen
eral newspapers."
Local orators have been asisgned
the defense of the negative of the
issue. The topic has been discussed
in the three debating societies and the
conclusion reached on all sides has
been that the Cardinal team will find
the best opportunity to convince the
judges from the stand of opposition
to endowed journalism. The argu
ments framed from this viewpoint are
best adapted to the Stanford style of
oratory and offer an extensive field
for invetigation.
At the same time that the choice of
side was indicated, the committee in
charge proposed a list of names from
which the trans-bay debaters will se
lect the three individuals who will
decide the bearer of a debating victory
this year. The men from whom the
judges will be picked are Judge Ange
lotti of the California Supreme Court,
Judge Seawall of the Superior Court
of Sau Francisco, Judge Gosby of the
Superior Court of San Jose, Judge
Lennon, Presiding Justice of the Court
of Appeals, W. A. Beasly, an attorney
of San Jose, O. K. Cushing and O.
Cooper, attornies of San Francisco,
and Judge Muraskey of the same city.
The only qualifications demanded of
the men who decide the merits of the
arguments in the big debate is thai
they shall not be alumni of either
university.
The time for the contest for posi
tions on the Cardinal debating team
has been set for the afternoon of next
Friday. The speeches must be made
on the revised form of the intercolle
giate question on either side of the
issue. Opportunity will be given for
those interested in the art of oratory
to sign up for positions in the tryouts
at the next meeting of the debating
societies. Particulars of the tryout
competition will be announced at a
later date.
