# Be Gentlemen.
## 
### 
At every rally and student assem
blage nearly every speaker mentions
the unsullied reputation of the Stan-

ford teams for clean
playing. The Stan
ford name has grown

to be a synonym for clean sportsman
ship. This is as it should be. But
what is the use of such a high reputa
tion on the field if the standard of
the bleachers is different? There is a
scant minority of underclassmen and
near-underclassmen whose special de
light at a game is to pass uncompli
mentary remarks concerning the visit
ing team whenever chance offers. If
the men on the field act like gentle
men, the men in the bleachers should
do the same. The Yell-Leaders
should feel it their duty to correct
those who have gone astray.
