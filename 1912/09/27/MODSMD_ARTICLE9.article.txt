# "AN IDEAL HUSBAND" WILL BE SEEN TONIGHT.
## 
### 
Promptly at 8:15 this evening, the
curtain will rise on the first act of
Oscar Wilde's comedy "An Ideal Hus
band." From present indications a
full house is assured the English
Club's presentation.
As is his custom, Coach P. L. Ma
thieu yesterday gave the cast a day of
rest from the long siege of rehearsals.
The staging of this piece promises
to surpass that of any recent play on
the local stage.
Although this play calls for four
acts, the quick action and bright lines
promises to hold the undivided atten
tion of the audience throughout the
evening. The light comedy and clever
situations are sure to please the most
critical.
