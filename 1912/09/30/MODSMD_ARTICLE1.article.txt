# AUDIENCE DISAPPOINTED BY WILDE'S PRODUCTION
## CHOICE OF PLAY PROVES TO BE DARING AND UNWISE Miss G.D. Workman, '12, Writes Criticism of English Club's "An Ideal Husband." 
### Miss G.D. Workman, '12 
The English Club did a daring
thing in choosing Oscar Wilde's epi
grammatic and highly sophisticated
comedy, "An Ideal Husband," for pres
entation by student actors before a
student audience. I say daring, be
cause there was no possibility that the
play would be generally liked nor that
it would prove a good vehicle for the
display of the college actor's ability,
its setting, plot and character were
too far removed from his experience
to be fully grasped by him.
The choice of the play was daring,
I say, and also unwise. "An Ideal
Husband" is one of the poorest of
Wilde's comedies for acting purposes;
it is over-long, the amount of talk is
out of all proportion to the interest
one has in the plot and the characters
are not sufficiently vital or gripping to
hold one's attention in spite of the
lack of action. There were at least
three excellent chances to end the last
act before Wilde saw fit to do so. He
prolonged his play so that he could
cut nff each thread of plot at the logi
cal point, but the night was hot, it was
late, and we really preferred going
home to finding out if Lord Chiltern
ever learned that he was not the ad
dressee of the pink note.
I say all this even though 1 feel
strongly that the English Club always
should produce the play of literary
merit in this community, but other
factors, such as the appropriateness
of theme, the technique of the play and
the ability of the actors, should be
considered as well as literary quality,
and these the English Club overlooked
in the present case.
The acting on the whole was some
what disappointing, dtie largely, as T
have indicated, to the inability of the
actors to thoroughly understand their
roles, much less interpret them. Miss
Bullis and Mr. Wells succeeded better
iti this regard than the remainder of
the cast. Mr. Wells, considering the
difficulty of his part, was especially
successful. In spite of a too youth
ful make-up, he played Sir Robert
Chiltern with dignity, sincerity and a
good deal of ease. His interpretation
was greatly aided by his resonant and
very pleasing voice. Mr. Wells is a
good actor and should do unusual
work with more experience.
We liked and admired Gertrude
Chiltern as Miss Bullis played her,
for both sympathy and intelligence
were used in the acting of the part.
Miss Bullis' emotional scenes were
given with great sincerity and a good
deal of force, but their effectiveness
was marred by a. faulty use of the
voice.
Miss Driscoll was the one person
in the cast who understood her part
better than she played it. She gave
evidence of a thorough mental grasp
of the diabolically clever Mrs. Cheve
ley. but she managed to send over the
footlights only a small indication of
the woman's fascination, power and
versatility. Miss Driscoll was ham
pered by a lack of ease on the stage,
due to inexperience.
Mr. Owens was laboring under the
difficulty of not understanding his
role. He made of an English dandy
a straight-forward, sincere, and very
likeable young American. To be sure,
Viscount Goring was sincere at heart,
but Mr. Owens emphasized this one
phase of his nature to the exclusion
of all others.
Miss Taff played the typical ingenue
with a great deal of spirit and vivacity,
but perhaps a little over-enthusiasm.
She has an attractive personality and
gives promise of better work to come.
From among the remainder of the
cast Miss Beach and Mr. Duff stand
out. Miss Beach possesses a charming
personality and a delightful voice, and
Mr. Duff made a good deal of a very
small part by his consistent acting of
it.
As is usual with plays given under
Mr. Mathieu's direction, the business
was smooth and the performance was
without a hitch. Sword and Sandals
once more demonstrated its really pro
fessional efficiency in the matter of
stage management, but the dressing
of the stage as to furniture and prop
erties was none too carefully ar
ranged, for which the English Club
alone is responsible.
The young women of the cast, one
and all, deserve praise for the very
effective costuming of their respective
parts, a feat the difficulty of which is
unappreciated by the local masculine
element.
I often wonder if we appreciate the
good work done by the University
Orchestra, and I should feel guilty of
just such a lack were 1 not to men
tion its excellently rendered and well
chosen program of Friday night.
