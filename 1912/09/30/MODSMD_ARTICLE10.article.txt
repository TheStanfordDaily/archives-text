"A Review of the Cephalopods of
Western North America" is the title
of a monograph by S. S. Berry, '09,
recently published by the United
States Bureau of Fisheries.
The work is a comprehensive,
systematic study of the squids, devil
fish, and allied animals inhabiting the
waters adjacent to the western shores
of North America. Since these crea
tures form one of the most important
sources of food supply for salmon and
other marketable fishes, the Bureau of
Fisheries feels that any increase in
knowledge regarding them is of im
portance.
The major part of the work upon
which the report is based was done
in the zoological laboratories of Stan
ford University, but the specimens
used are principally from the collec
tions of the United States steamer
"Albatross," and are the property of
the National Museum.
