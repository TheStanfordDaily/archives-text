# VARSITY WORKS HARD TO DEFEAT BARBARIAN TEAM
## Freshmen Play Best Game Since Their Advent Upon the Field---St. Mary's Lack Last Year's Snap. 
### 
Stanford blanked the Barbs on Sat
urday and credited itself with twelve
hard-earned points. The game as a
whole proved the least interesting
and encouraging of any of the three
in which the Varsity has appeared.
In the preliminary contest, the
Freshmen, by playing snappy rugby,
defeated the St. Mary's fifteen 23-0.
The Barbarians brought down, not
a fifteen, but a "twelve." With the
gaps filled by players from the Car
dinal squad, however, a team took the
field which put up an aggressive game
against the Varsity. The Stanford
warriors won individual laurels as of
old, but failed to apply the trite
maxim, "In union there is strength."
The team, particularly the backs,
could not get together. As a result,
many pretty plays failed to materia
lize.

Noble played a
clean cut game,
was a strong tack
ier and put two of
the Cardinal tries
across. Kern at
second five played
some fine, dashing
rugby, but his in
ability to handle
passes relegated
many incipient

passing rushes to the great boneyard
of lost chances. The order of the day,
however, was that he should execute
the short kicks to the forwards, and
this prevented him from indulging in
a passing game. His boot on most oc
casions was not quite short enough.
Reeves, playing center three, sprang
into the limelight with some ground
gaining sprints and bucks through the
loose, but suffered severely from a
chronic malady of the entire backfield
the tendency to get the pass away
"just too late." Erb's ability to find
touch again proved valuable. Captain
Cass' work won constant praise from
the bleachers, and deserved every bit
of it.
The three Stanford men. Blase, suc
ceeded by Sandstrom, Bloeser, and An
drews, who went in for the Barbarians,
proved a tower of strength for the
clubmen. Boulware was the premier
ground gainer of the scrum. Lopez.
Browne, Incell and Fyfe also played
good rugby for the visitors.
The game as a whole was rather
slow, owing to the frequency of minor
fouls on the part of both teams which
well nigh wore out the iron throat of
the referee's whistle.
First Half.
Shortly after Erb's kickoff the Car
dinal backs made their first pilgrimage
into the land of heart's desire beyond
the goal posts. Harrigan picked up
near the Barbarian 10 and ran twenty
yards. Reeves, acting as middleman,
sent the ball to Noble, who set it down
beneath the cross bar. Erb failed of
conversion.
Not long after, Smith, from a ruck
near ten, carried the pigskin over.

Lull did not convert. Smith's playing
throughout the afternoon was note
worthy, as was that of the splendid
forward, Gard. The rest of the half
found the Barbs playing an aggressive
game, with the ball most of the time
in Stanford territory. The clubmen
found a favoring wind an advantage,
and got touch with admirable accur
racy.
Second Half.
This half found the Cardinal repre
sentatives playing better rugby. After
Browne's kickoff the ball was worked
into Barbarian territory, and Erb's
boot found touch at their 25. Smith,
on a lineout, went ten yards, and Noble
on the Barbarian fifteen received a
well aimed cross kick from Cass and
negotiated the try. Erb failed to con
vert.
Three times did the Stanford players
boot the ball over the line and three
times a black rather than a gray jer
seyed man fell upon it. Finally, how
ever, Captain Cass ran in a dropout
and passed to Gard. Where the latter
dropped the ball Dingley secured and
went the remaining yards to the try.
No conversion resulted. Final score,
Stanio d, 11!, Barbarian Club, 0.
Freshman Game.
In the opening game the Freshmen
found themselves for the first time.
They struck a pace which, if they can
maintain it, will serve to confound
those who have criticized them.
The first try of this contest came as
the result of one of the greatest pass
ing rushes which has ever thrilled the
Stanford bleacherites. Starting at the
half, the ball passed through the
hands of every backfield man out to
the right wing, and the try was finally
executed by Urban, left wing, who
circled around his teammates to par
ticipate in the play.
The Freshmen played Saturday as a
single, hard-fighting unit, and this
explains the size of the score against
a team of the calibre of the St. Mary's
fifteen. The Catholic collegians are
heavy, and excellent individual players
but as yet lack teamwork. Ability of
the backfield to pass the ball at
crucial moments and splendid drib
bling by the forwards were ground
gaining assets of Stanford's youngest
representatives.
Though all the Freshmen played
good ball, Urban was the particular
bright star. The little wing's game
was hard and fast, and he covered a
wonderful amount of territory.
The Game.
Urban's try was the only score
chalked up for the Freshmen in the
opening period. Cass converted.
Later, when the ball was dribbled over
the Stanford line, Urban prevented his
opponents from duplicating the figures
by a pretty dive in which he beat
Riordan to the leather oval.
Early in the second period Hayes
got the ball from a ruck at center ano
it went from him to MoKall to Lam-


H. M. Noble, '12
mi man who negotiated the score.
Cass again added the desirable two
points.
After a long boot had found touch
at St. Mary's 5, Braden from the line
out took the ball across. He failed to
convert his try.
Urban was credited with the next
try, securing from the loose at 10.
Cass converted.
The wing added another to his list
of scores after the final pistol shot
had been fired. Cass kept his record
clean with another conversion.
Final score. Freshmen 23, St. Mary's,
0.
