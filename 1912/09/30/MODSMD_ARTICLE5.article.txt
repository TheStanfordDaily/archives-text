# ZOOLOGY STUDENT MAKES CANADIAN FISH STUDY.
## 
### 
W. F. Thompson, '09, a graduate
student of the Zoology department,
spent the past summer in Canada,
doing field work for the British Co
lumbian Fisheries Commission. He
studied the condition of oyster and
clam beds in the coast waters and
made a report of findings, which will
be issued by the provincial govern
ment.
Thompson has an album of many
interesting photographs from his field
territory, and will make stereoptican
slides for an illustrated lecture. The
slices will be ready in a short time.
During the past few years Stanford
has sent many able men into the ser
vice of Pacific Coast fisheries com
missions. Last summer, Dr. Gilbert of
the Zoology department, and Thomp
son were both engaged in the Do
minion.
