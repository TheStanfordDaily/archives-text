## EXILED MARTYR WILL SPEAK IN ASSEMBLY. Abbas Effendi, Disciple of Bahaism, is Expected Here Within a Fortnight. 
### 
Abbas Effendi, or Abd-ul-Baha, the
venerable Persian apostle of the Gold
en Rule and disciple of Bahaism, the
religion which preaches universal
peace and the brotherhood of man,
will speak at a special assembly at
Stanford within a fortnight.
Sir Abbas will arrive in San Fran
cisco within ten days and will come
immediately to Stanford for the As
sembly address. Definite information
as to the time of his arrival is ex
pected at the President's office in a
day or two.
Heralded throughout the Orient as
the head of a new world religion, Sir
Abbas has preached his mission of
world peace, religious unity, and
brotherhood throughout Europe and
America. His converts to Bahaism
are said to number several millions,
including Christians, Mohammedans
and Jews, among other creeds.
A .Martyr to Religion.
Sir Abbas is an aged man now.
Confined in exile at Acre, Syria, by the
orders of the deposed Sultan Abd-ul-
Hamid, for more than 40 years, the
rebellion of tin; young Turls gained
for him his freedom.
Those who know him say that in
his face can be seen (he years of
patient martyrdom he suffered for his
belief. He has a patriarchal beard and
a saintly face, and a simple, dignified
manner of address, free from any em
harassment.
He speaks in Persian, which is sen
tence by sentence translated by an
interpreter. He greets his audience
by touching his forehead repeatedly
with the palm of his right hand, after
the oriental custom, and closes his
sermon with a half-chanted prayer,
holding his hands upward and open.
The magnificent Arabic title, Abd
ul-Baha, means "The Slave to the
Glory," a parallel to such designa
tions as Abd-ur-Rahim, "The Slave of
the Compassionate," by which pious
Moslems express their subjection to
the will of Allah.
The title Abd-ul-Baha also indicates
Sir Abbas' position as the son and suc
cessor of Baha Ullah, "The Glory of
Allah." Baha Ullah, in his turn had
been preceded by a fiery young apostle,
Ali Mohammed, who took the name of
"Bab," the "Door" of wisdom and who
preached a crusade of reformation in
Persia, beginning 08 years ago, on
which Bahaism was founded.
Ali was shot by the soldiers of the
orthodox Shah at Tabriz for his religi
ous teachings. Baha-ITllah was exiled
to Acre with his son Abbas, then only
eight year old. by the Turkish sultan,
after they had been driven into his
domain.
Freed by Rebellion.
While forbidden to leave the bound
aries of the city of Acre, a fever
ridden convict colony under the
shadow of Mt. Carmel, the family of
j Sir Abbas continued to draw con
j verts by the thousands, until the vic
tory of the young Turks was marked
with tlie withdrawal of the sentence.
Sir Abbas began a world tour in Egypt
in 1910 which has brought him to this
country and California. He will re
turn to Egypt by way of Japan and
India.
Sir Abbas believes that the declara
tion of unity of religion should be the
most powerful force in bringing men
| together, in breaking down the arti
ficial bounds of creed, of race, of na
tional and political antagonisms. Baha
Ullah, who always sought practical
applications for his theoretical con-
clusions, worked out the theory of an
international court of arbitration,
which he called the Hall of Justice,
in one of bis books.
Abd-ul-Baha declared in an address
in All Souls' church in Chicago in
May, that if the essentials of religion
jbe observed, peace would be the re
sult, and that the conditions existing
are due only to imitations which have
crept into religions and the differences
in the imitations that have caused the
various denominations and sects.
He says that the diversity and dis
cord that exists between the sexes is
I due to the false education and position
of women in the past. "Women
should be educated as men are and
have the same rights in all things."
He preaches that the idea of a con-
flict between science and religion is
false.
