# Conference Election.
## 
### 
Tomorrow twelve men are to be
elected to the University Conference,
to fill vacancies. This is an election

of extreme importance.
The men on the Confer
ence this year have the
problem of carrying

through the initial year of Student
Control, and the future of the scheme
depends largely upon the success of
the first year. It is the duty of every
eligible voter to turn in his ballot to
morrow. Furthermore, he should
choose with care the representative
that he desires to seat in the Confer
ence.
