# HOOVER APPEALS TO '95 TO SWELL UNION FUNDS.
## Father of Clubhouse Project Devoting Half His Time to the Campaign. 
### 
H. C. Hoover, '95, the father of the
Stanford Union project, has just insti
tuted a vigorous personal campaign
among the alumni members of his
class of the university immediately to
obtain more funds for the clubhouse.
Hoover is laboring unceasingly to
gain subscriptions in order to begin
the actual work of constructing the
clubhouse building as soon as pos
sible. To this end he has determined
first to canvass his own class and the
men of his time in college to ascertain
exactly how much money they will be
able to contribute toward the Union
fund.
Pledge cards have been sent to all
the members of the class of '95, asking
a contribution of $20 immediately and
a pledge to pay $30 more, making $50
in all, when called for at a later date.
Hoover has a very large acquaint
ance among the alumni and in this
way he hopes to awaken the old grad
uates to a realization of the needs of
the Union. With the results of the
canvass of the class of '95 in hand,
Hoover expects to make one more
comprehensive plea to the alumni for
subscriptions.
Sufficient funds are now on hand to
make the Stanford Union a realit>.
There only remains the work of col
lecting the pledges already made and
obtaining enough more to carry the
plan through with despatch. Hoover
has written hundreds of personal let
ters and is devoting more than half
his time to prosecuting the campaign
for funds.
