Captain Cass is temporarily off the
field with a slight attack of La Grippe.
' His sickness is hardly more than a
i sever cold, and his absence from prac
tice is only the result, of the rigid
preventative policy that is being en
;forced.
K. L. Schanpp, '12, who has been
'out of the game for several days past,
lis again on the field and will be seen
in Saturday's lineup.
L. C. Decius is suffering from a torn
muscle in his side. The injury is not
considered serious, however, and the
front-ranker is expected to don a suit
again next week.
E. P. Bly has been promoted by
Trainer Maloney from the sick list to
active play, and will be seen on the
field this afternoon.
