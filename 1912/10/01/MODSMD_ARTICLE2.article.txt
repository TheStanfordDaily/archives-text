# WILL HOLD JOLLY-UP IN HONOR OF AUSTRALIANS.
## Entire Student Body Will be Given Chance to Meet Visitors Informally. 
### 
Following out the desire of the
committee in charge of the entertain
ment for the Australians, the 1912
class met today and decided to hold
a University Jolly-up on one of the
evenings during the visit of the Anti
podeans. The exact date will be an
nounced in a few days.
Whatever night is chosen is bound
to conflict with previously scheduled
affairs, but in view of the debt Stan
ford owes to the Australians for the
reception accorded the Cardinal repre
sentatives in 1910, the class of 1912
and the committee urgently request
that any other entertainments be
postponed.
The following committee has been
appointed to take charge of the affair:
M. F .Enderle, chairman, C. H. Hayes,
B. H. Lasky, L. S. King, J. A. Davis,
Misses Florence Orr, Ruth Hutchin
son, Agnes Yoch and Delta Garst.
At its meeting today the class also
started a campaign to pay off the debt
on the 1912 Quad incurred by Manager
B. J. O'Donnell. Notices will be mail
ed to all the members of the class re
questing the payment of a dollar
assessment. A liberal response to the
communications, it. is figured, will
clear the deficit. J. W. Howell. M. L.
Ward, and L. D. Summerfield, were
appointed to take charge of the col
lection.
