# WORKMEN MAKE PROGRESS ON MEMORIAL CHURCH
## CHIMES WILL NOT BE HEARD BEFORE 1914. Tedious Work of Replacing Fallen Edifice Fast Takes Form Toward Completion. 
### 
Although reconstruction work on
the Stanford Memorial Church has
progressed steadily since last Octo
ber, it will be well into 1914 before
the chimes of the clock and the boom
of the bells will resound over the
campus, as in the days before the
earthquake. Piece by piece, as if ii
were a gigantic Chinese puzzle, the
massive pile is being literally picked
up from the ground, where it was
hurled by the temblor, and put to
gether. The rebuilt structure will be
an exact replica of the old. except
that the new walls will be practically
earthquake proof.
"Stanford Minster."
"The Stanford Minster," as the
church was known, is the first of the
university buildings which were de
molished in the earthquake of 1906,
to be rebuilt. Since that memorable
morning of six years ago, when the
wonderful edifice was found a ruin,
its walls, mosaics, arches and stones
have laid on the ground between the
south faces of the inner and outer
Quadrangles. Today the work of
piecing together what can be found
and supplying that which is lost, is
being rushed as rapidly as possible.
At present a force of sixty men are
working for the McGilvray Stone com
pany in replacing the walls.
At the time of the tremor, the steel
skeleton of the roof and walls re
mained intact. The huge center tower
was also unshaken. Today the bare
iron girders are being covered. With
in two weeks the walls will be up
and work will then begin on the re
placing of the roof.
Contracts for the entire interior
work, however, have not yet been
closed. Tt is very probable that a
force of men will be sent here from
Venice, Italy, to reset the mosaics.
The workmen today are proceeding
with the most minute care in re
placing the fallen walls, yet more
skilled hands than theirs will be need
ed to restore the gorgeousness of the
interior mosaics and effects. Each
piece of the wreckage is numbered,
and each number has a place in the
building.
