At the time of its completion the
Memorial Church was the center of
world-wide interest on account of its
beauty, massiveness, symmetry and
wonderful gorgeousness. It. was
erected at an original cost of $1,000,-
000. Besides this, Mrs. Stanford ex
pended $600,000 in interior decora
tions and finishings. It will cost ap
proximately $500,000 to rebuild.
The building is cruciform in plan,
with aspidal transepts and chancel.
From a booklet issued at the time of
the completion of the building the fol
lowing description is taken:
"The Church has an extreme length
of 200 feet and lifts its gilded cross
18(! feet. Its walls are of massive
sandstone, rough dressed on the out
side. ft is noble in massiveness and
finely proportioned parts and in the
culminative beauty of buttresses and
turrets assembled around the shapely
and commanding tower. There, high
above the surrounding buildings are
chimes like those of Parliament House
on the Thames, that strike the quar
ter hours and the illuminated clock
that chronicles the (light of time.
"The interior design and symmetry
of the Church are perfect. Four wide
Roman arches laced with delicate
carving rest on four great pillars and
support a dome ceiling. The rounded
walls of Chancels and Transepts com
plete the Romanesque effect and give
a sense of singular unity and great
spaciousness. The low tones of
natural color in surfaces of wood and
stone leave color to be supplied by
the windows. Their beauty is thus
enhanced and in return they illume
the sculputured marbles and richly
carved pillars and galleries with a
thousand tints."
Clinton Day of San Francisco was
the original architect. The McGilvray
Company did the stone work. E. A.
Hettinger of Palo Alto furnished the
stained glass. The mosaics came from
the firm of Salviatti Company in far
away Venice. Warde and Blohme of
San Francisco are the rebuilding
architects. Ward is the architect-in
chief of the Panama-Pacific Exposi
tion.
