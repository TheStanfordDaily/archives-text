Registration figures are the most
striking evidences of the growth and
prosperity of a university, and as such
the following record will prove of in
terest to the college community.

On October 1, 1891, 559 students en
rolled for the first year of Stanford's
history. Of this number 417 were men
and 142 women. Four years later the
registration had doubled, with the
figures at the eleven hundred mark.

The largest registration in the in
stitution's history was for the years
1905-06, when there were 1756 students
on the rolls. The percentage of
women was the smallest since the
second year after the University's
founding, and that low mark of 31 per
cent, has not been reached even with
(he five hundred rule.

The highest percentage of women
was for the years '98-'99, when the fair
sex constituted 40.1 per cent, of the
Student Body.

In the twenty-one years that have
elapsed since the founding of the uni
versity, 12,654 students have register
ed.

For the years 1910-1911, there is a
total of 1758, as compared to the 1747
enrolled for this semester. Of this
number 487 are Freshmen. As the
figures are usually changed by the
registration for the second semester,
the loss in numbers can not be con
sidered a loss for the year.

The registration of undergraduates
at the University of California this
year reached the high mark of 3472.
This, combined with the 440 graduate
students, and the students enrolled
in the Affiliated Colleges, brings the
total above five thousand.
