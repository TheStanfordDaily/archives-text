# FRESHMEN ANNEX GAME FROM PALO ALTO HIGH
## FIRST-YEAR MEN OPPOSED BY SECOND TEAM PLAYERS. 24-3 is Score in Fourth Contest With Local Preparatory School Fifteen. 
### 
Though the Freshmen trounced Palo
Alto this afternoon after being thrice
defeated by the high school players,
revenge was none too sweet. The
reason for the gall in the Freshman
cup of victory was that the defeated
team consisted entirely of second
string men.
Had the Freshmen faced a strong
fifteen, their showing would have suf
fered by comparison with that of last
Saturday. Except in the first part of
the opening period their passing
rushes were smothered frequently by
their opponents. The string of sub
stitutes who went in for the baby
players in the second half were held
to pretty even terms by their oppo
nents.

lineout a pretty passing rush by the
1916 backs carried the ball to the
Palo Alto line, where Thomas saved.

a block. Play did not leave the oppos
ing danger zone, and within a minute
Lammiman scored. Cass converted.
Second Half.
The Cardinal babes came on the
field with an almost entirely changed
lineup.
Thirty seconds of playing after the
kickoff was enough to add 5 points to

rest was easy.

cross the line. Cass converted from a

stitutes who went in for the baby
players in the second half were held
to pretty even terms by their oppo
nents.
Fjrst Half.
Boulware kickad off for Palo Alto,
and the ball went to touch at the 25
line. The superior weight of the
Freshman scrum began to count at
once, and the play went into high
school territory. Kellogg replaced
Stevenson. From a twenty-five yard
lineout a pretty passing rush by the
1916 backs carried the ball to the
Palo Alto line, where Thomas saved.
\ minute later the backs again got
away and Murray negotiated the first
try. Cass failed to convert because of
a block. Play did not leave the oppos
ing danger zone, and within a minute
Lammiman scored. Cass converted.
Second Half.
The Cardinal babes came on the
field with an almost entirely changed
lineup.
Thirty seconds of playing after the
kickoff was enough to add 5 points to
the Freshman score. Murray got the
ball in a lineout at center, and the
rest was easy.
Braden was the next player to
cross the line. Cass converted from a
difficult angle. Keast replaced Duben
dorf in the next scrimmage. From a
twenty-five yard lineout, Dingley, ot
Palo Alto, shot down the field with
the ball, passing to Fletcher, who
scored. Risling failed to convert.
Long made the next score for 1916.
Brown failed to convert. The Fresh
