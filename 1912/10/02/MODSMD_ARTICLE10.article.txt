# A 						Royal Reception.
## 
### 
The Australians will be the guests
of the students for ten days. The

program of the Entertain
ment Committee, as given
tonight in another column,
leaves several gaps that

should be filled. A big proposition
faces the committee —we do not have
so many facilities at Stanford for en
tertaining visitors as they have across
the bay. To make a success of those
ten days that the visitors are to be
with us every one must join in. If
you have any suggestions to offer turn
them in at this office or to a member
of the committee.
When the All-American team visited
the Antipodes in the summer of 1910
they were royally entertained. Their
visit here is one of international im
portance. The attention of the world
is called to the Pacific Coast, the
home of rugby in the New World, bar
ring the English possessions. We
must give our visitors a royal good
time.
