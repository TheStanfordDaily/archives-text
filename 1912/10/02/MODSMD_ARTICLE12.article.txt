# PLANS ARE COMPLETED FOR SOPHOMORE JOLLY-UP.
## 
### 
Sophomores will .Tolly-up in the
Armory on October 5 at eight o'clock.
Following the usually conventionali
ties, "queening" will absolutely be
tabooed and rough neck attire will be
in order. Cars will be chartered both
to take the classmen down and bring
them home after the last dance.
W. N. L. Hutchinson, chairman of
the Jolly-up committee, is planning to
spring several surprises in the form
of entertainments. Unique stunts will
be presented, entirely different from
the usual type. There will be plenty
of eats of a high order and robber
dances in profusion.
