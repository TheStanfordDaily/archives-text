# INTERCLUB TENNIS MEN MUST SIGN BY THURSDAY.
## 
### 
Entries for the Interclub Doubles
Championship will close Thursday
night, when the drawings will be
made. More interest has been aroused
over this tournament than any pre
vious tennis competition for the past
two or three years. Many of the fra
ternity houses are holding elimina
tion tryouts in order to decide by what
I teams they will be represented.
Two trophies have been given by
Palo Alto merchants to go to the win
ders of the tournament. One of the
unique loving cups has been donated
by Ogier and the other by Smith's
jCyclery.
