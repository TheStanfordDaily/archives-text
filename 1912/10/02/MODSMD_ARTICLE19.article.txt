# WELLS IS CHAIRMAN OF PLUG UGLY COMMITTEE
## PRESIDENT BEHRENS NAMES MEN FOR JUNIOR EVENT. Seniors Will Batter Third Year Head Gear One Week Before the Big Game. 
### 
E. A. Wells has been appointed
chairman of the 1914 Plug Ugly Com
mittee which is to have charge of the
Plug Ugly Show, Plug Ugly Posters,
and the organization of the Plug Ugly
Rush for this year.
The date that has been selected for
the initiating of the new Plug-wearers
has been set at November 2, one week
before the Intercollegiate Football
Game.
An endeavor will be made by this
year's Juniors to surpass in every way
the production of "The Death of the
Dirty Dozen," which was staged by
the 1913 Class last year on the Stan
ford Oval.
The form of the rush has changed
materially during the past two years,
but it is not yet known whether one or
either of the rushes of 1910 or 1911
will be adhered to. In 1910 the
wearers of the Plug dashed around
the Inner Quad while their adversaries
tried to smash in their plugs, but it
was found that few plugs were smash
ed and that the contestants were mere
ly tired from the long run. In 1911,
one of the arches of the Tnner Quad
was guarded by the Seniors, while the
Juniors rushed through them, but
many believe that the excitement was
too short lived.
The other members of the committee
as announced today by President E. C.
Rehreus are as follows: A. M. Stand
ish, O. f-I. Castle, R. M. Finch, E. H.
Ford. A. G. Halm, F. J. Gard, L. W.
Lewis, A. T. Cluff, V. W. McKinney,
C. C. Close, F. E. Single, F. R. Wat
kins, and E. T. Worthy.
Chairman Wells has announced that
the Committee will hold its first
meeting in room 74, Encina, next
Tuesday evening at 7:30.
