## 
### 
Tomorrow morning when the steam
ship Moana docks at San Francisco,
she will discharge, among other pas
sengers, twenty-five Australian ath
letes, comprising one of the strongest
rugby teams that the Antipodean con
tinent can produce. Upon their arri
val in the city the men will he met by
a large body of citizens, officials and
representatives of the California Rug
by Union, who will escort them to the
Olympic Club. Following a luncheon
at the Club, at which they will be
officially welcomed by Mayor Rolph,
the Kangaroos will be the guests of
honor at a smoker given by the
British residents of the peninsula.
Thereafter, during the entire visit
of six weeks, the foreigners are to be
the guests or participants in numer
ous functions each day. The enter
tainment committee of the Rugby
Union, composed of J. R. Hickey, ex
'o7, D. W. Burbank, '09, and H. Mc-
Kenzie, have arranged a programme
which will not give the men an idle
moment during their stay.
Visitors Meet Barbs.
After a three days' sojourn in San
Francisco, during which time they
play the Barbarians, the team will
depart for San .lose, where they will
be the guests of Santa Clara College.
They will engage Sunday afternoon
with the Santa Clarans in a rugby
contest.
Monday, the Australians will arrive
at Stanford, and it is the request of
the local committee that as many stu
dents as possible meet the train and
give the invaders a rousing welcome.
The exact time of their arrival will
be announced on the bleachers Satur
day.

i F. C. Brown, '11, E. F. Kern, *13,
and W. S. Wilson, '13, who are in
j charge of the entertainment of the
Australians while they are on the
campus, have scheduled a series of
entertainments which should prove of
I exceeding interest to the visitors,
provided the entire student body takes
an interest in the various functions.
The programme has not been finally
j settled upon and there will probably
be several additions and changes in
I the list that is given out today. Dr.
D. C. Gardiner and Professor F. C.
Woodward have each consented to
have the Australians to tea during
their stay and Dr. C. S. G. Nagel of
Palo Alto is to entertain them on one
! evening. Dr. Nagel was a former
j resident of Australia and is greatly
interested in the trip of his former
countrymen. As one of the features
of his evening's programme he has
j arranged for a Hawaiian orchestra
to render musical numbers.
May Have Assembly.
I
i Efforts are being made to secure
jan assembly for Tuesday morning,
on which occasion the Australians will
be formally welcomed to the campus.
Addresses will be delivered by Presi
des Jordan and Dr. F. Angell and
members of the Australian team will
be called upon for replies. One of the
musical organizations will also appear.
No definite date has been set for
the. University Jolly-up, but it will
probably be on Monday, October 14,
as there is no other event scheduled
for that evening.
An auto trip to Santa Cruz will be
made by the combined Australian and
Stanford teams on Sunday, October
