a large body of citizens, officials and
representatives of the California Rug
by Union, who will escort them to the
Olympic Club. Following a luncheon
at the Club, at which they will be
officially welcomed by Mayor Rolph,
the Kangaroos will be the guests of
honor at a smoker given by the
British residents of the peninsula.
Thereafter, during the entire visit
of six weeks, the foreigners are to be
the guests or participants in numer
ous functions each day. The enter
tainment committee of the Rugby
Union, composed of J. R. Hickey, ex
'o7, D. W. Burbank, '09, and H. Mc-
Kenzie, have arranged a programme
which will not give the men an idle
moment during their stay.

After a three days' sojourn in San

play the Barbarians, the team will
depart for San .lose, where they will
be the guests of Santa Clara College.

i F. C. Brown, '11, E. F. Kern, *13,
and W. S. Wilson, '13, who are in
j charge of the entertainment of the
Australians while they are on the
campus, have scheduled a series of
entertainments which should prove of
I exceeding interest to the visitors,
provided the entire student body takes
an interest in the various functions.

have the Australians to tea during
