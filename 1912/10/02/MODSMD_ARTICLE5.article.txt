By knocking ont a home run in the
last inning of yesterday's baseball
game, pitcher McLaughlin decided the
contest and thereby slipped his team
into first place in the league standing.
As a result of the affray, which was
won by Argabrite's men, Team No. 3,
from Workman's players, Team No. 1,
by the close score of 2 to 1, the two
fust places are reversed.
The game yesterday was the best
of the series. Both pitchers, Hayes
and McLaughlin, worked well, as but
three hits were secured by either side
in the five innings. McLaughlin was
easily the star of the game. With the
score 1 to 1 in the first part of the last
inning he struck on three men in a
row. In addition to a home run he
was credited with a three base hit.
This was converted into a run by a
sacrifice fly from Dooling.
Tomorrow afternoon at 4:45 Teams
2 and 3 play.
