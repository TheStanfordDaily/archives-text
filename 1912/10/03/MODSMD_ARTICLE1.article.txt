### 
Preparations for the staging of the
forensic contest for places on the in
tercollegiate debating team have been
completed. Eleven aspirants for de
hating honors have signed up. The
time for the beginning of the tryouts
has been set for next Friday after
noon at 2. The merits of the speeches
presented from the Chapel rostrum
will be judged by a committee of
faculty members. Twelve minutes has
been allowed each competitor in which
to demonstrate his oratorical ability.
Two teams will be selected, the first
to represent the Cardinal in the Var
sity debate, and a second consisting
of the alternate and the next two men
in rank of ability. This second team
will hold an important position in act
ing as the opponent of the first team
men in the practice contests in prepa
ration for the struggle with the Blue
and Gold representatives. This plan
was initiated last year and has proved
successful.
Time Allowed.
According to the new intercollegiate
agreement, each member of the team
in the debate must give a rebuttal
speech of five minutes instead of
leaving this duty to the leader of each
side, as heretofore. Following this
plan, the twelve minutes of argument
presented by each of the contestants
in the tryouts will be divided into a
constructive dissertation of nine min
utes and an answering address of threb
minutes. The speakers will appear as
in a regular debate, affirmative and
negative alternating.
