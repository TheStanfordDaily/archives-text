Nearly 250 near-lawyers together

sity, gathered in the Stanford Inn last
evening in the Annual Law Smoker.
In the talks of the evening Pro
fessor F. C. Woodward represented the
Faculty, and spoke of the progress of
the Law School and its bright pros
pects.
G. A. Ditz, '11, a former Student
Body President, spoke of the students
at Harvard, where he studied law
during the past year. He showed
clearly the advantages that Stanford
had over Harvard in spite of the fact
that Stanford is a smaller institution.
F. H. Hilton, '11, a Varsity debater,
brought out the workings of the
"honor system," one of the most prized
institutions of the department.
L. W. Lewis, '14, and H. R. Spence,
'13, both clever college comedians,
were given many encores to their
musical numbers.
After the program, Chairman M. T.
Dooling, '12, ordered the serving of
stag refreshments.
