# ACADEMIC SECRETARY IS HOME FROM BERING SEA.
## G.A. Clark Investigates Condition of Pribilof Islands Fur-Seal Herd For Government. 
### 
After a four months' trip to Bering
Sea as special investigator of the
Pribilof Islands fur-seal herd for the
United States Bureau of Fisheries,
(Â». A. Clark, Academic Secretary of
the University has returned to the
campus. Clark is at present engaged
in the preparation of his report to the
government, and states that he founa
the herd in better condition than he
expected.
This herd numbered between two
and three million animals when it
came into the possession of the United
States in 1867. Since that time it has
been greatly reduced by pelagic, or
indiscriminate sealing in the open
water.
In 1909 the herd numbered about
1f.0,000 animals. In 1911 the United
States secured a treaty with Great
Britain, Japan, and Russia which
abolished pelagic sealing.
Since the past season was the first
under the treaty, it was important to
know the condition of the herd at its
lowest point, as well as the effect of
the new law.
Clark's selection for the investiga
tion was the result of work done in
1896-7, as secretary of the Bering Sea
Fur Seal Commission, and on a spe
cial investigation in 1909.
