# BRAZILIAN STATESMAN GIVES SECOND LECTURE.
## Political Emancipation of Latin-American Colonies is the Subject of Historical Review. 
### 
Continuing his comparison of the
"Evolution of Brazil" with that of
Spanish and British American colonies,
Dr. Oliveira Lima delivered the second
lecture of a series of six yesterday
afternoon in room 231.
Dr. Lima confined himself almost
entirely to discussion of the conditions
in the Latin-American colonies which
existed just before and after political
emancipation from the mother coun
tries.
"Brazil had to send her students to
Portugal to be educated, while the
Spanish colonies were provided with
schools and universities. Many of the
Brazilians remained in Europe, but
others returned to teach their theories
of emancipation," said the speaker.
"Territorial expansions from the
16th to the 18th centuries were the
forerunnners of political expansion,
which was cradled by the work of
popular municipal corporations whose
work was to repel despotism from
across the sea. The corporations had
limited taxing ability, and were sub
ject to the checkmate of the royal
governor. Nevertheless, they had the
co-operation of the people, and were
able to do effective work. By the be
ginning of the 19th century the
Spanish colonies had gained their in
r ependence."
Dr. Lima will go to Santa Cruz
within a day or two, but will be here
to give the fourth lecture of the series
on October 8.
