# FAST CONTESTS ARE SCHEDULED TOMORROW
## WINGED "O" TO OPPOSE VARSITY IN SECOND GAME. College of Pacific Fifteen Make First Appearance—Should be Strong Opponents for 1916. 
### 
Winged "O" meets Varsity "S" to
morrow on Stanford field for the sec
ond game in a series of three to be
played this season. In the curtain
raiser the Freshman team will oppose
the players from the College of the
Pacific.
Interest in the bleachers will be
centered in the work of the Cardinal
Varsity backfield, for there injuries
have not made such inroads, and the
lineup begins to take definite shape.
Kern will play the second five posi
tion, where he has played stellar rugby
in the last two games. Reeves will
again be at center three-quarters, and
will be backed by Noble and Temple
ton in the wing positions. A. Erb is
to take Captain Cass's place behind
the scrum. The latter is still on
Trainer Maloney's "semi-sick" list.
In preparation for their scheduled
games with the Australian Waratahs,
the Olympic Club officials have been
strengthening the clubmen and their
lineup Saturday is a matter of conjec
ture. The team which opposed Cali
fornia a week ago was a strong one,
the score of 9-0 in favor of the Blue
and Gold giving no evidence of the
closeness of the contest. The Olympic
backs played in fine form, and not only
were brilliant in defensive work, but
again and again carried the ball within
the California danger zone.
Freshmen vs. College of Pacific.
In the husky players from the San
.lose institution the Freshmen are
likely to find a combination hard to
solve. Last Saturday the University
of Nevada fifteen nosed out the Metho
dists by two points after a hard
game. The California Freshmen
downed the Pacific Collegians ten days
ago by a 14 to 11 score, the deciding
try being made in the last thirty sec
onds of play.
The baby class will be represented
by the same team that downed St.
Mary's last Saturday.
The lineups are:
Varsity — Hall, Single, Sinclair,
Partridge, Darsie, Lull, Wright, for
wards; A. Erb, half; Harrigan, Kern,
fives; Reeves, cente; Noble, Temple
ton, wings; B. Erb, full.
Olympic Club (probable)—Sundell,
Guerin, Skov, Stafford .Haley, Glass
cock, Marisch, Arrell, forwards; Flat
ley, half; Austin, Von Mandersheid,
fives; Phillips, center; Lunt, McKen
zie, wings; Trowbridge, full.
Freshmen — Stevenson, Butterfield,
Kdwards, Dubendorf, Braden, Murray,
Bacon, ('ass, forwards; McKall, half;
McCray, Jones, fives; Lamtniman, cen

Winged "O" meets Varsity "S" to
morrow on Stanford field for the sec
ond game in a series of three to be
played this season. In the curtain
raiser the Freshman team will oppose
the players from the College of the
Pacific.
Interest in the bleachers will be
centered in the work of the Cardinal
Varsity backfield, for there injuries
have not made such inroads, and the
lineup begins to take definite shape.
Kern will play the second five posi
tion, where he has played stellar rugby
in the last two games. Reeves will
again be at center three-quarters, and
will be backed by Noble and Temple
ton in the wing positions. A. Erb is
to take Captain Cass's place behind
the scrum. The latter is still on
Trainer Maloney's "semi-sick" list.
In preparation for their scheduled
games with the Australian Waratahs,
the Olympic Club officials have been
strengthening the clubmen and their
lineup Saturday is a matter of conjec
ture. The team which opposed Cali
fornia a week ago was a strong one,
the score of 9-0 in favor of the Blue
and Gold giving no evidence of the
closeness of the contest. The Olympic
backs played in fine form, and not only
were brilliant in defensive work, but
again and again carried the ball within
the California danger zone.
Freshmen vs. College of Pacific.
In the husky players from the San
.lose institution the Freshmen are
likely to find a combination hard to
solve. Last Saturday the University
of Nevada fifteen nosed out the Metho
dists by two points after a hard
game. The California Freshmen
downed the Pacific Collegians ten days
ago by a 14 to 11 score, the deciding
try being made in the last thirty sec
onds of play.
The baby class will be represented
by the same team that downed St.
Mary's last Saturday.
The lineups are:
Varsity — Hall, Single, Sinclair,
Partridge, Darsie, Lull, Wright, for
wards; A. Erb, half; Harrigan, Kern,
fives; Reeves, cente; Noble, Temple
ton, wings; B. Erb, full.
