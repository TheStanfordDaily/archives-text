Having completed the background of
preparation in his two previous lec
tures. Dr. Oliveira Lima yesterday af
ternoon considered the definite politi
cal emancipation of the Latin-Ameri
can colonies from Spain and Portugal,
the mother countries.
"The lack of unity in organization
which existed until a late date in the
Iberian Peninsula was apparent in
Portuguese and Spanish America. Be
cause of the resulting lack of uni
formity in colonial legislation, the
natural and legitimate expression of
public sentiment was toward a federal
government. It was natural that
many schemes for political organiza
tion should be advanced after emanci
pation from the Old World," said the
eminent speaker.
Dr. Lima discussed various plans
elaborated by Bolivar and San Martin
for the establishment of the indepen
dence of the New World states 011 a
monarchic basis. Such patriotic
leaders feared that the Latin-American
colonies were not ready for republican
government.
Such fears were shown to be well
grounded by the lecturer's comparison
of Spanish-American anarchism after
the wars of emancipation with the
traditions of stability existing in
Brazil due to the retention of the
Braganza dynasty as the ruling house.
