# SHALL STANFORD UNION AND WOMAN'S CLUBHOUSE SHARE A COMMON SITE?
## 
### 
In a recent assembly, H. C. Hoover,
'95, the father of the Stanford Union,
proposed the plan of grouping the
Union, the Woman's Clubhouse and a
general administration building as a
means of securing immediate and first
class construction of these buildings.
Since then the idea has been discussed
by undergraduates and alumni and a
great interest has been awakened in
the Union project.
His plan, in general, is to locate
the three buildings as an architectural
unit on one site. Such an arrangement
would permit a common assembly
hall, a common kitchen and central
committee and organization rooms to
be incorporated in the general build
ing. This would serve the interests
of economy in that the Stanford Union
and the Woman's Clubhouse would
not need to incorporate these features
in their individual buildings, if they
erected them separately
Scheme Solves Problem.
"The erection of three buildings,
buildings, grouped as a unit, probably
offers the best solution of the prob
lem," declared Hoover yesterday. "The
chief advantage is that both the men
and women can begin construction
work on their buildings almost imme
diately. Again, such an arangement
would permit the separate clubs from
being inaugurated with the problem of
maintenance to face and no money to
meet it.
"If the plan were adopted, the
women could go ahead and erect their
building themselves at a cost con
siderably less than otherwise would
be the case. All they would need to
do would be to conform it to the
general plan. They would need a
much smaller assembly room, and the
kitchen, etc., would be provided in
the general building.
"Other buildings, a swimming pool
if we were able to build one, could
easily be added to the group after
wards. This is where the greatest ad
vantage of grouping the buildings as
an architectural unit comes in.
"Such a grouping," continued Hoo
ver, "would permit the Union to be
sufficiently far removed to be really a
men's club. In order to retain its indi
viduality, it must be as far away from
the women's building as practicable,
for the interests of both parties."
Following are the expressions of
opinion on the plan, of various officials
and others interested:
Mrs. Allan Favors Plan.
Mrs. E. W. Allan, '96, vice-president
of the board of directors of the
Woman's Clubhouse:
"Mr. Hoover's plan already has been
brought up informally in the Women's
Conference. It also has been dis
cussed in Cap and Gown and it was
discussed last night at a meeting of
the resident alumnae of the univer
sity.
"Speaking as an alumna of the
university, I think Mr. Hoover's plan
a sensible, busines-like thing to do.
The chief advantage would be that it
would solve the problem of lighting,
heating and caring for the grounds of
the clubs.

"Again, it would provide a means
for both the men and women to begin
constructing the buildings without a
debt. Hoover's plan also would per
mit the men and women to come to
gether to the Board of Trustees in
asking for a site.
"So far, I have found no real oppo
sition to Mr. Hoover's general plan.
I feel that a great deal depends on
the decision on the matter. It is de
sirable that public opinion be aroused
to promote a general discussion of the
plan."
Ambrose Endorses It.
A. W. Ambrose, president of the
Associated Students:
"The greatest advantage of the plan
suggested by Mr. Hoover in the as
sembly is that it will enable both the
men and the women to building
much sooner. Construction on the
separate clubs could be started soon,
and the other buildings added as need
ed.
"Such a plan would enable both thb
men and the women to construct
buildings of the first class, and there
is no question but what that is the
kind of structures we want.
"From a financial point of view, the
group construction offers a very eco
nomical method of erecting the build
ings and erecting them in the near
future."
Miss Ileen Bullis, '13, President of
the Woman's Conference:
"Personally, I believe Mr. Hoover's
plan a thoroughly good one. The
chief reason I favor the building of
the separate men's and women's clubs
on one site is that it will enable us
to begin building at once. The money
we now have can be put to use in
providing buildings that can be added
to later.
"Much more beautiful buildings
could be erected for both the men and
women and erected cheaper. When
the plan first was presented by Mi.
Hoover, it was feared by some of the
women that it would be taken by the
men as coming from them .since the
woman's clubhouse fund is much less
than theirs."
Smith an Advocate.
K. W. Smith, '95, permanent secre
tary of the Union:
"I am for the Union building and the
Woman's clubhouse being on the same
site with preferably a separate build
ing between to which the other build
ings may be joined as wings.
"I favor the plan on the score of
economy and also because I, like a
number of other alumni, am married
to a Stanford graduate, and if we are
going to use the union building we
would like to have it adjacent to the
woman's building.
"If two separate buildings are erect
ed by the women and men, one or the
other must eventually provide accom
modations for both men and women, to
take care of the married graduates."
