throng of jubilant San Franciscans.

Olympic Club where the visitors were
accorded an informal reception.
The Antipodean athletes are a
husky bunch of individuals. The
average weight of the twenty-four
athletes is 170 pounds and the scrum

prises the pick of the New South
Wales ruggers. Four of the men
were members of the famous Walla

their return from England in 1909.
The captain. Ward Prentice, is one of
the most famous backfield men in the
world. There is only one college

the guests of the Olympic Club at

Columbia Park and the University of
California bands failed to put in an
appearance it left the Cardinal players
as the sole musicians in the parade.

a dip in the plunge, they kept up their
good work by rendering several se
lections during the reception to the
Waratahs.
