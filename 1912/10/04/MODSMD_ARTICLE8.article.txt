# The
						Band.

### 
The Stanford Band won new laurels
for the University yesterday in San

Francisco. Two other bands
failed to show up and the
Cardinal band, thirty-eight
strong, bore the brunt of the

afternoon's parade and reception to
the Australians. Their playing won
the unstinted praise of the officials,
alumni and citizens of San Francisco.
It is the attitude of any group repre
senting the University away from the
campus that makes or mars their
University's reputation. Yesterday
the Stanford Band raised the Univer
sity's prestige. They are to be com
mended.
