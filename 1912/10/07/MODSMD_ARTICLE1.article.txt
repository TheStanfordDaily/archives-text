# VARSITY AND FRESHMEN ON LONG END OF SCORE
## OLYMPICS DEFEATED IN GOOD CONTEST. Babes Take Victory From College of Pacific Players in Preliminary Game, Saturday. 
### 
Saturday's fine football weathei
seemed to fire the blood of the Car
dinal Varsity and Freshman fifteens.
lioth teams played creditable rugby
against their opponents. In the major
set-to of the day the Olympics were
handed the undesirable end of a 17-0
score, while the Freshmen downed the
College of the Pacific players 13-5.
The five trys registered by the Var
sity came almost without exception
as the result of simon-pure rugby.
For the first, Harrlgan, in beautiful
style, nailed a high one from a ruck
at the Olympic 25 and shot over. The
Cardinal salted away its next three
points as the result of a well-executed
passing rush, Harrigan to Templeton
to Kern. Reeves secured on a fumble
near the clubmen's 25 and registered
the succeeding tally. Noble next es
corted the ball across the white line.
He received it on a pretty pass from
Kern, who secured oil McKenzie's
fumble. Good team-work well earned
the final try. A. Erb cross-kicked to
Kern, and the ball was passed to Ris
ling and by him to Dingley, who regis
tered the score.
In spite of the lop-sided aspect of
the score, the Olympics played a
worthy game and showed tried and
true mettle in the thick of every fight.
Several times they were within sight
of a score, but lost the opportunity
through a fumble or other misplay.
They also found the Cardinal backs a
hard defensive combination to solve.
These backs also put up a strong of
fensive game, especially in the first
half. Reeves and Kern played slash
ing rugby, and the latter got his passes
away better than has been his custom.
Harrigan attached his name-plate to
the first-five berth with an additional
spike. This little player's rugby was
of stellar Variety. Templeton ac
quitted himself with honor, as did his
successor, Dingley, who managed to
score during the short time he was
in the play. R. Erb's clever playing
and accurate booting were again in
evidence. The general work of the
backs, particularly their passing,
showed an improvement Saturday.
The stock of the Stanford forwards,
always high, went up a notch with
the return of Partridge to his old
stamping ground. When all the vet
eran scrum men now on the side lines
get into the game the forward divi
sion should be well nigh invincible.
All the forwards followed the ball well
and showed an improvement in drib
bling. Gard and Smith were valu
able ground gainers.
McGregor, Arrcll, Miller, Sundell
and P°ters were among pnst and pres
ent Stanfordites counted in the Olym
pic linen p. All played stellar rugby
for the Winged-O. as did Trowbridge,
Skov, McKenzie and Austin.
For the second time this season the
Freshmen played rugby worthy of the
name and defeated the College of the
Pacific players, the figures reading
13-5.
The Freshmen were on the defen
sive until after Hansen had negotiated
the first try for their opponents, when
the handicap of five points gave them
new life and from the 20 yard line
Laine went over with the ball. Cass
converted, and the score was 5-5.
A passing rush, Cass-Lammimain-
Urban, a short run by Lammiman and
a second rush, Lammiman-Urban-
Hayes, carried the ball from midfield
over the line for the second try. Cass
failed to convert. The third try came
almost immediately, Urban going
across from a 20-yard ruck. Cass con-

Saturday's fine football weathei
seemed to fire the blood of the Car
dinal Varsity and Freshman fifteens.
lioth teams played creditable rugby
against their opponents. In the major
set-to of the day the Olympics were
handed the undesirable end of a 17-0
score, while the Freshmen downed the
College of the Pacific players 13-5.
The five trys registered by the Var
sity came almost without exception
as the result of simon-pure rugby.
For the first, Harrlgan, in beautiful
style, nailed a high one from a ruck
at the Olympic 25 and shot over. The
Cardinal salted away its next three
points as the result of a well-executed
passing rush, Harrigan to Templeton
to Kern. Reeves secured on a fumble
near the clubmen's 25 and registered
the succeeding tally. Noble next es
corted the ball across the white line.
He received it on a pretty pass from
Kern, who secured oil McKenzie's
fumble. Good team-work well earned
the final try. A. Erb cross-kicked to
Kern, and the ball was passed to Ris
ling and by him to Dingley, who regis
tered the score.
In spite of the lop-sided aspect of
the score, the Olympics played a
worthy game and showed tried and
true mettle in the thick of every fight.
Several times they were within sight
of a score, but lost the opportunity
through a fumble or other misplay.
They also found the Cardinal backs a
hard defensive combination to solve.
These backs also put up a strong of
fensive game, especially in the first
half. Reeves and Kern played slash
ing rugby, and the latter got his passes
away better than has been his custom.
Harrigan attached his name-plate to
the first-five berth with an additional
spike. This little player's rugby was
of stellar Variety. Templeton ac
quitted himself with honor, as did his
successor, Dingley, who managed to
score during the short time he was
in the play. R. Erb's clever playing
and accurate booting were again in
evidence. The general work of the
backs, particularly their passing,
showed an improvement Saturday.
The stock of the Stanford forwards,
always high, went up a notch with
the return of Partridge to his old
stamping ground. When all the vet
eran scrum men now on the side lines
get into the game the forward divi
sion should be well nigh invincible.
All the forwards followed the ball well
and showed an improvement in drib
bling. Gard and Smith were valu
able ground gainers.
McGregor, Arrcll, Miller, Sundell
and P°ters were among pnst and pres
ent Stanfordites counted in the Olym
pic linen p. All played stellar rugby
for the Winged-O. as did Trowbridge,
Skov, McKenzie and Austin.
For the second time this season the
Freshmen played rugby worthy of the
name and defeated the College of the
Pacific players, the figures reading
13-5.
The Freshmen were on the defen
sive until after Hansen had negotiated
the first try for their opponents, when
the handicap of five points gave them
new life and from the 20 yard line
Laine went over with the ball. Cass
converted, and the score was 5-5.
A passing rush, Cass-Lammimain-
Urban, a short run by Lammiman and
a second rush, Lammiman-Urban-

failed to convert. The third try came
