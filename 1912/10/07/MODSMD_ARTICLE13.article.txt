# PRESIDENT JORDAN SPEAKS IN ENCINA.

"Virtue is doing what you ought
to do," said President David Starr
Jordan, last evening in Encina Hall,
when speaking to a crowd of Univer
sity men, who had assembled to hear
him talk on "The Religion of a College
Man."
"It is a wise man who knows what
to do next, and religion is a man's
reason for doing right. A man will
always meet with success when he
follows the lines of right in business.
"The greatest danger of a college
man is losing sight of the fundamen
tals of his religion. He should not
say that he has lost his religion until
he knows what the fundamentals of
his religion are. His religion need
not be a creed, but is that main prin
ciple, which helps him to be a better
man, and enters into his character.
"A religious man is just like any
other man, but he is livlier. Right
is that which makes for life, and this
is what Jesus meant when he said, "I
come to bring more life.'"
