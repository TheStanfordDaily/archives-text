# VENERABLE PERSIAN WILL TALK PEACE IN ASSEMBLY TOMORROW
## 
### 
Abd-ul-Baha, known as Abbas Effen
di, the venerable Persian savant, will
speak in a special assembly at 10:15
o'clock tomorrow morning. Sir Abbas'
address will be followed at 11:15 by
the welcoming assembly for the Au
stralians.
Owing to a misunderstanding, the
San Francisco committee in charge of
Sir Abbas' program scheduled his ar
rival on the campus for 3 o'clock to
morrow afternoon.
At the time it was feared that it
would be impossible to change the
arrangements of the committee and a
notice to the effect that Sir Abbas
would speak in the chapel at 3:30
o'clock was posted on the bulletin
board.
However, when the San Francisco
committee were appraised of the fact
that only a limited number of stu
dents would be able to attend an after-
noon lecture, the desired change was
made.
The Bahaists in San Francisco have
arranged elaborate entertainment for
their leader from the orient, and his
visit to the bay city is taken up with
addresses before numerous organiza
tions.
The aged apostle of the Golden Rule
' and preacher of world peace is accom
panied on his visit to the coast by two
interpreters who present in English
the words of their leader.
The teachings of the Persian martyr
himself have attracted world-wide
attention and his fame abroad and in
America is no less than that of his
father, who died in exile at Acre in
Syria.
