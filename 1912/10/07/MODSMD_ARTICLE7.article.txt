# Welcome.

### 
Welcome, Australians. For ten days
the Stanford campus is yours. We

remember with lasting
pleasure the royal recep
tion that you accorded our

players when they visited your coun
try in the summer of 1910. Now that
you are our guests and it is our set
purpose to give you the best time that
it is in our power to do. Your visit
is of international significanceâ€”the
world watches your games with the
rugby players of the Pacific Coast,
the home of the adoption of the Eng
lish game in the New World. Your
sojourn here will help materially in
spreading further the game of rugby.
We expect to learn from you new ways
to play the game and to increase our
efficiency. We welcome you as friends
and men that we are proud to meet
in the friendly rivalry of the football
field.
