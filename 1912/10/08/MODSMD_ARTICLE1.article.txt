Evincing the excellent relationship
which now exists between the two
countries and which will be further
cemented by the international matches j
of the tour of the Antipodean rugby !
fifteen, Stanford, through Doctor Jor- j
dan and Doctor F. Angell, formerly
extended greetings to the visiting
Australians this morning in one of the
most enthusiastic of University assem
blies. No less enthusiastic was the
response of the representatives of !
Australia for the spontaneous recep- ,
tion which was accorded them.
"I welcome you, Australians, to the j
Stanford campus and to our shores, j
Your visit represents the good feel- ,
ing which ought to exist," said Doctor j
Jordan in greeting the visitors." "You 1
are our nearest relatives and this
makes it doubly important that you
are hospitably received. Your ideas
of sport are like those which have
made Stanford a model in collegiate
athletics. Our aim has been clean
sport and this is your ideal also.
"The curse of American athletics
has been the desire to win rather than
to play the game for the game itself,"
declared the Stanford President.
"This is not so in Australia," Doctor
Jordan traced the origin of the Eng
lish game and showed how the present
game of rugby had its beginning in a
violation of the rules of the older
association football. A member of
an Oxford team made the error of
picking up the ball and running with
it contrary to the rules. From this
rugby grew. But when it was brought
over to America off-side play was
legalized and the present American
football was the result.
"Six years ago I visited Australia
and was received with every courtesy
in every part of the country, and, in
appreciation of that welcome, I feel
the necessity of returning the compli
ment and hope that the men who are
now are visitors will be shown every
courtesy possible to make their stay
a pleasant memory."
"On behalf of the committee of en
tertainment it is more than a pleasure
for mo to welcome you to the Stanford
Farm," said Doctor Angell, the second
speaker of the Assembly. "We hope |
to repay you for the innumerable
courtesies which were shown our !
team in 1910 on the occasion of the I
visit to Australia. The visit of the
American team was a great success !
SI. Mary's Play Freshmen Tomorrow, i
St. Mary's and Freshmen fifteens
will meet tomorrow afternoon on the
turf at 4:30. This is the second meet
ing of the two teams. In the first
affair the Cardinal players were re
turned victorious by a 23-0 score. To
morrow's game is the next to the last I
contest the 101 C team will play this I
season. A season ticket will admit.

and we hope that you will be repaid
in a measure by your long journey
to the Pacific Coast. Your coming
will promote international feeling
| and is of great significance.
"Your knowledge of the game is
I certain to result in profit to our play
ers. We like your idea and believe
that the reason for our poor showing
has been due to the desire to 'win.'
"If your entertainment were left
j entirely to the students they would
1 declare a holiday for the entire time
I of your stay, but since this is not pos
j sible from our point of view we will
j welcome you again and impress on
i your minds that the campus, the Quad,
j the fields and everything here is yours,
! except . You must win them for
you rselves."
Presenting the Union Jack to Doctor
Jordan on behalf of the visiting
Britishers, Manager Bohrsman thank
ed the assemblage for the reception
i and expression of open-heartedness on
behalf of the New South Wales rugby
union players of his team.

"Our rugby unions have been one
of the most important factors iu
cementing the bonds of the British
Empire," said Manager Bohrsman, in
discussing the benefits of the game
in the English possession. "There be
comes a feeling of unity between the
men of the various teams and this is
not only good for the sport but also
for the country.
"Two years ago the visit of the
American players to our shores re
sulted in a lasting impression of your
men and if we leave your country with
one-half the excellent, reputation that
your men left behind them we will
be well satisfied. We hope to make
international rugby an annual event
and that you will play the game as we
do and make it a national pastime."
On behalf of the New South Wales
rugby union, of which organization
he is secretary, W. W. Hill, one of the
leading rugby authorities of the Anti
podes, made a second response to the
welcome to the Waratahs.
"For some of us our visit is merely
a renewal of acquaintances but for
the majority of our men this visit
means the making of many new
friends whom we hope to number
among our friends always. Inter
national rugby means the inter
mingling of the young men of the
two countries and this will add in
cementing the good feeling which
now exists between us. We look for
ward to a series of pleasant games
and hope we may be of benefit to you.
"It is ;m added pleasure to return
the welcome of your President, since
he was the first guest from Stanford
to make a formal visit to Australia."

fifteen, Stanford, through Doctor Jor- j
dan and Doctor F. Angell, formerly
extended greetings to the visiting
Australians this morning in one of the
most enthusiastic of University assem
blies. No less enthusiastic was the
response of the representatives of !
Australia for the spontaneous recep- ,
tion which was accorded them.
"I welcome you, Australians, to the j
Stanford campus and to our shores, j
Your visit represents the good feel- ,
ing which ought to exist," said Doctor j
Jordan in greeting the visitors." "You 1
are our nearest relatives and this
makes it doubly important that you
are hospitably received. Your ideas
of sport are like those which have
made Stanford a model in collegiate
athletics. Our aim has been clean
sport and this is your ideal also.
"The curse of American athletics
has been the desire to win rather than
to play the game for the game itself,"
declared the Stanford President.
"This is not so in Australia," Doctor
Jordan traced the origin of the Eng
lish game and showed how the present
game of rugby had its beginning in a
violation of the rules of the older
association football. A member of
an Oxford team made the error of
picking up the ball and running with
it contrary to the rules. From this
rugby grew. But when it was brought
over to America off-side play was
legalized and the present American
football was the result.
"Six years ago I visited Australia
and was received with every courtesy
in every part of the country, and, in
appreciation of that welcome, I feel
the necessity of returning the compli
ment and hope that the men who are
now are visitors will be shown every
courtesy possible to make their stay
a pleasant memory."
"On behalf of the committee of en
tertainment it is more than a pleasure
for mo to welcome you to the Stanford
Farm," said Doctor Angell, the second
speaker of the Assembly. "We hope |
to repay you for the innumerable
courtesies which were shown our !
team in 1910 on the occasion of the I
visit to Australia. The visit of the
American team was a great success !
SI. Mary's Play Freshmen Tomorrow, i
St. Mary's and Freshmen fifteens
will meet tomorrow afternoon on the
turf at 4:30. This is the second meet
ing of the two teams. In the first
affair the Cardinal players were re
turned victorious by a 23-0 score. To
morrow's game is the next to the last I
contest the 101 C team will play this I
season. A season ticket will admit.

and we hope that you will be repaid
in a measure by your long journey
to the Pacific Coast. Your coming
will promote international feeling
| and is of great significance.
"Your knowledge of the game is
I certain to result in profit to our play
ers. We like your idea and believe
that the reason for our poor showing
has been due to the desire to 'win.'
"If your entertainment were left
j entirely to the students they would
1 declare a holiday for the entire time
I of your stay, but since this is not pos
j sible from our point of view we will
j welcome you again and impress on
i your minds that the campus, the Quad,
j the fields and everything here is yours,
! except . You must win them for
you rselves."
Presenting the Union Jack to Doctor
Jordan on behalf of the visiting
Britishers, Manager Bohrsman thank
ed the assemblage for the reception
i and expression of open-heartedness on
behalf of the New South Wales rugby
union players of his team.

"Our rugby unions have been one
of the most important factors iu
cementing the bonds of the British
Empire," said Manager Bohrsman, in
discussing the benefits of the game
in the English possession. "There be
comes a feeling of unity between the
men of the various teams and this is
not only good for the sport but also
for the country.
"Two years ago the visit of the
American players to our shores re
sulted in a lasting impression of your
men and if we leave your country with
one-half the excellent, reputation that
your men left behind them we will
be well satisfied. We hope to make
international rugby an annual event
and that you will play the game as we
do and make it a national pastime."
On behalf of the New South Wales
rugby union, of which organization
he is secretary, W. W. Hill, one of the
leading rugby authorities of the Anti
podes, made a second response to the
welcome to the Waratahs.
"For some of us our visit is merely
a renewal of acquaintances but for
the majority of our men this visit
means the making of many new
friends whom we hope to number
among our friends always. Inter

blies. No less enthusiastic was the
response of the representatives of !
Australia for the spontaneous recep- ,
tion which was accorded them.
"I welcome you, Australians, to the j
Stanford campus and to our shores, j
Your visit represents the good feel- ,
ing which ought to exist," said Doctor j
Jordan in greeting the visitors." "You 1
are our nearest relatives and this
makes it doubly important that you
are hospitably received. Your ideas
of sport are like those which have
made Stanford a model in collegiate
athletics. Our aim has been clean
sport and this is your ideal also.
"The curse of American athletics
has been the desire to win rather than
to play the game for the game itself,"
declared the Stanford President.
"This is not so in Australia," Doctor
Jordan traced the origin of the Eng
lish game and showed how the present
game of rugby had its beginning in a
violation of the rules of the older
association football. A member of
an Oxford team made the error of
picking up the ball and running with
it contrary to the rules. From this
rugby grew. But when it was brought
over to America off-side play was
legalized and the present American
football was the result.
"Six years ago I visited Australia
and was received with every courtesy
in every part of the country, and, in
appreciation of that welcome, I feel
the necessity of returning the compli
ment and hope that the men who are
now are visitors will be shown every
courtesy possible to make their stay
a pleasant memory."
"On behalf of the committee of en
tertainment it is more than a pleasure
for mo to welcome you to the Stanford
Farm," said Doctor Angell, the second
speaker of the Assembly. "We hope |
to repay you for the innumerable
courtesies which were shown our !
team in 1910 on the occasion of the I
visit to Australia. The visit of the
American team was a great success !
SI. Mary's Play Freshmen Tomorrow, i
St. Mary's and Freshmen fifteens
will meet tomorrow afternoon on the
turf at 4:30. This is the second meet
ing of the two teams. In the first
affair the Cardinal players were re
turned victorious by a 23-0 score. To
morrow's game is the next to the last I
contest the 101 C team will play this I
season. A season ticket will admit.

and we hope that you will be repaid
in a measure by your long journey
to the Pacific Coast. Your coming
will promote international feeling
| and is of great significance.
"Your knowledge of the game is
I certain to result in profit to our play
ers. We like your idea and believe
that the reason for our poor showing
has been due to the desire to 'win.'
"If your entertainment were left
j entirely to the students they would
1 declare a holiday for the entire time
I of your stay, but since this is not pos
j sible from our point of view we will
j welcome you again and impress on
i your minds that the campus, the Quad,
j the fields and everything here is yours,
! except . You must win them for
you rselves."
Presenting the Union Jack to Doctor
Jordan on behalf of the visiting
Britishers, Manager Bohrsman thank
ed the assemblage for the reception
i and expression of open-heartedness on
behalf of the New South Wales rugby
union players of his team.

"Our rugby unions have been one
of the most important factors iu
cementing the bonds of the British
Empire," said Manager Bohrsman, in
discussing the benefits of the game
in the English possession. "There be
comes a feeling of unity between the
men of the various teams and this is
not only good for the sport but also
for the country.
"Two years ago the visit of the
American players to our shores re
sulted in a lasting impression of your
men and if we leave your country with
one-half the excellent, reputation that
your men left behind them we will
be well satisfied. We hope to make
international rugby an annual event
and that you will play the game as we
do and make it a national pastime."
On behalf of the New South Wales
rugby union, of which organization
he is secretary, W. W. Hill, one of the
leading rugby authorities of the Anti
podes, made a second response to the
welcome to the Waratahs.
"For some of us our visit is merely
a renewal of acquaintances but for
the majority of our men this visit
means the making of many new
friends whom we hope to number
among our friends always. Inter
national rugby means the inter
mingling of the young men of the
two countries and this will add in
cementing the good feeling which
now exists between us. We look for
ward to a series of pleasant games
and hope we may be of benefit to you.
"It is ;m added pleasure to return
the welcome of your President, since
he was the first guest from Stanford
to make a formal visit to Australia."
