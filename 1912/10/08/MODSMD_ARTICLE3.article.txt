# Abd-ul-Baha Declares International Strife Unscientific and Contrary to Nature.
## 
### 
An aged man, with a long white
beard and a benign and saintly face,
stood on the platform of the Assembly
hall this morning and demonstrated
the utter uselessness of war and its
waste, with all the poetic beauty of
oriental philosophy.
In a simple and dignified manner,
with no more evidence of embarrass
ment that if he were addressing an
assemblage of his native Persians,
Abd-ul-Baha, or Abbas Effendi,
brought the arguments of science,
nature and philosophy together to
show the universal brotherhood of
man and the necessity for universal
peace.
In the garb of his own country, a
long brown toga which harmonized
modestly with his dark complexion
and the white turban, Sir Abbas pre
sented a picturesque figure. Speaking
quietly in Persian, his expressive fea
tures and gestures made the services
of his interpreter seem at times al
most superfluous.
"The greatest attainments of the
world ever have been scientific in
nature," declared Sir Abbas in open
ing his address. "Always the great
est body of learned men are devoting
themselves to science, and I feel a
sense of great joy to be here in one of
the great educational centers of the
world."
"I wish to speak now of the Funda
mental Oneness of Phenomena. You
will agree that all phenomena is more

or less the aggregate expressions of
constant metabolism.
"All cellular elements that make up
the human organisms passed through
the same stage. Take the hand of
man. It was once mineral, then vege
table, finally animal, and part of the
great human structure. So you see
the existence of all things in nature is
fundamentally one."
Mankind, as the noblest creature of
nature, has been endowed with the
greatest of qualities by God, a sound
mind," continued Sir Abbas. "He is
possessed with every other faculty
in nature, and alone enjoys this extra
ordinary human quality, the mind.
"Is it behooving that man should
think of strife, wage war? All the
other elements of nature are at peace.
Is it meet that man, the noblest crea
ture of all, should alone remain fero
cious? God forbid such a state!
"Peace is freshness, it is radiance,
comfort, and composure conducive to
life. All the phenomena of nature is
at peace. Do the zephyrs «112 the air
or waves of the ocean war among
themselves? If nature gets into dis
cord what happens? The San Fran
cisco earthquake!
"But all the elements are beneath
the tyrannical law of nature. They do
not deviate a hair's-breath from the
postulates of their mistress. The sun,
the planets, the earth itself are all the
captives and subjects of nature. The
elephant, large as he is, can't deviate
from the regulations of nature.
"Yet man, with his small stature,
himself the Effulgence of Divine Efful
gence, breaks all the laws of nature
because God has endowed him with a
mind. He becomes a bird, in the
aeroplane, a fish, in the submarine,
and thus breaks nature's inexorable
law.
"He draws out of the plane of the
invisible to the plane of the invisible
all nature's secrets. He subserves
electricty, the most rebellious force
in nature, to his will and puts the
East and West momentarily beyond
nature's laws.
"How can a being of such majestic
intellect remain a ferocious animal?
Like a wolf killing his fellow wolf. It
is contrary to the law of nature for
man to kill man. Wolf kills wolf
because of hunger. Wolves have no
ideas of justice and are excusable.
But man kills man only for greed.
Is it behooving that such a noble, de
lightful creation, with a sound mind,
lofty thoughts and great scientific
achievements should kill another of
the same kind for greed?
"God has given man perception,
memory, discrimination, the five
senses, all manifestations of virtue, in
order that he may be a radiant candle,
a source of life and an agency of con
structiveness. Shall he spill the blood
of his fellowman on the battlefield and
destroy this great edifice of God? If
you destroy the edifice of man you
bring down his wrath. How much
more would destroying the edifice of
God be potent in arousing the wrath
of God!
"Shall we wrest the sword of nature
from nature's hand and use it on
Nature? Man's extraordinary quali
ties have been given him to meet the
exigencies of Nature's defects. There
is no greater degradation or worse de-
basement than the battlefield. It is
the cause of destruction of the founda
tions of man."
"If religion is the cause of differ
ence and sedition we would be better
without it," declared Sir Abbas in
concluding his address. "But differ
ences in religion are due to the imita
tions of dogma. If the reality behind
all religions should be investigated
they all would be unified.
"We are all the progeny of one man,
Adam. All are of one family, one
lineage. Everything on this earth is
dust. Must we behead our fellowman
for dust? Earth merely is a grave
yard for all Eternity. Shall we fight
over our own graveyard? What ig
norance!"

tures and gestures made the services
of his interpreter seem at times al
most superfluous.
"The greatest attainments of the
world ever have been scientific in
nature," declared Sir Abbas in open
ing his address. "Always the great
est body of learned men are devoting
themselves to science, and I feel a
sense of great joy to be here in one of
the great educational centers of the
world."
"I wish to speak now of the Funda
mental Oneness of Phenomena. You
will agree that all phenomena is more

or less the aggregate expressions of
constant metabolism.
"All cellular elements that make up
the human organisms passed through
the same stage. Take the hand of
man. It was once mineral, then vege
table, finally animal, and part of the
great human structure. So you see
the existence of all things in nature is
fundamentally one."
Mankind, as the noblest creature of
nature, has been endowed with the
greatest of qualities by God, a sound
mind," continued Sir Abbas. "He is
possessed with every other faculty
in nature, and alone enjoys this extra
ordinary human quality, the mind.
"Is it behooving that man should
think of strife, wage war? All the
other elements of nature are at peace.
Is it meet that man, the noblest crea
ture of all, should alone remain fero
cious? God forbid such a state!
"Peace is freshness, it is radiance,
comfort, and composure conducive to
life. All the phenomena of nature is
at peace. Do the zephyrs «112 the air
or waves of the ocean war among
themselves? If nature gets into dis
cord what happens? The San Fran
cisco earthquake!
"But all the elements are beneath
the tyrannical law of nature. They do
not deviate a hair's-breath from the
postulates of their mistress. The sun,
the planets, the earth itself are all the
captives and subjects of nature. The
elephant, large as he is, can't deviate
from the regulations of nature.
"Yet man, with his small stature,
himself the Effulgence of Divine Efful
gence, breaks all the laws of nature
because God has endowed him with a
mind. He becomes a bird, in the
aeroplane, a fish, in the submarine,
and thus breaks nature's inexorable
law.
"He draws out of the plane of the
invisible to the plane of the invisible
all nature's secrets. He subserves
electricty, the most rebellious force
in nature, to his will and puts the
East and West momentarily beyond
nature's laws.
"How can a being of such majestic
intellect remain a ferocious animal?
Like a wolf killing his fellow wolf. It
is contrary to the law of nature for
man to kill man. Wolf kills wolf
because of hunger. Wolves have no
ideas of justice and are excusable.
But man kills man only for greed.
Is it behooving that such a noble, de
lightful creation, with a sound mind,
lofty thoughts and great scientific
achievements should kill another of
the same kind for greed?
"God has given man perception,
memory, discrimination, the five
senses, all manifestations of virtue, in
order that he may be a radiant candle,
a source of life and an agency of con
structiveness. Shall he spill the blood
of his fellowman on the battlefield and
destroy this great edifice of God? If
you destroy the edifice of man you
bring down his wrath. How much
more would destroying the edifice of
God be potent in arousing the wrath
of God!
"Shall we wrest the sword of nature
from nature's hand and use it on
Nature? Man's extraordinary quali
ties have been given him to meet the
exigencies of Nature's defects. There
is no greater degradation or worse de-
basement than the battlefield. It is
the cause of destruction of the founda
tions of man."
"If religion is the cause of differ
ence and sedition we would be better
without it," declared Sir Abbas in
concluding his address. "But differ
ences in religion are due to the imita
tions of dogma. If the reality behind
all religions should be investigated
they all would be unified.
"We are all the progeny of one man,
Adam. All are of one family, one
lineage. Everything on this earth is
dust. Must we behead our fellowman
for dust? Earth merely is a grave
yard for all Eternity. Shall we fight
over our own graveyard? What ig
norance!"
An aged man, with a long white
beard and a benign and saintly face,
stood on the platform of the Assembly
hall this morning and demonstrated
the utter uselessness of war and its
waste, with all the poetic beauty of
oriental philosophy.
In a simple and dignified manner,
with no more evidence of embarrass
ment that if he were addressing an
assemblage of his native Persians,
Abd-ul-Baha, or Abbas Effendi,
brought the arguments of science,
nature and philosophy together to
show the universal brotherhood of
man and the necessity for universal
peace.

long brown toga which harmonized
modestly with his dark complexion

fundamentally one."
Mankind, as the noblest creature of
nature, has been endowed with the
greatest of qualities by God, a sound
mind," continued Sir Abbas. "He is
possessed with every other faculty
in nature, and alone enjoys this extra
ordinary human quality, the mind.
"Is it behooving that man should
think of strife, wage war? All the
other elements of nature are at peace.
Is it meet that man, the noblest crea
ture of all, should alone remain fero
cious? God forbid such a state!
"Peace is freshness, it is radiance,
comfort, and composure conducive to
life. All the phenomena of nature is
at peace. Do the zephyrs «112 the air
or waves of the ocean war among
themselves? If nature gets into dis
cord what happens? The San Fran
cisco earthquake!
"But all the elements are beneath
the tyrannical law of nature. They do
not deviate a hair's-breath from the
postulates of their mistress. The sun,
the planets, the earth itself are all the
captives and subjects of nature. The
elephant, large as he is, can't deviate
from the regulations of nature.
"Yet man, with his small stature,
himself the Effulgence of Divine Efful
gence, breaks all the laws of nature
because God has endowed him with a
mind. He becomes a bird, in the
aeroplane, a fish, in the submarine,
and thus breaks nature's inexorable
law.
"He draws out of the plane of the
invisible to the plane of the invisible
all nature's secrets. He subserves
electricty, the most rebellious force
in nature, to his will and puts the
East and West momentarily beyond
nature's laws.
"How can a being of such majestic
intellect remain a ferocious animal?
Like a wolf killing his fellow wolf. It
is contrary to the law of nature for
man to kill man. Wolf kills wolf
because of hunger. Wolves have no
ideas of justice and are excusable.
But man kills man only for greed.
Is it behooving that such a noble, de
lightful creation, with a sound mind,
lofty thoughts and great scientific
achievements should kill another of
the same kind for greed?
"God has given man perception,
memory, discrimination, the five
senses, all manifestations of virtue, in
order that he may be a radiant candle,
a source of life and an agency of con
structiveness. Shall he spill the blood
of his fellowman on the battlefield and
destroy this great edifice of God? If
you destroy the edifice of man you
bring down his wrath. How much
more would destroying the edifice of
God be potent in arousing the wrath
of God!
"Shall we wrest the sword of nature
from nature's hand and use it on
Nature? Man's extraordinary quali
ties have been given him to meet the
exigencies of Nature's defects. There
is no greater degradation or worse de-
basement than the battlefield. It is
the cause of destruction of the founda
tions of man."
"If religion is the cause of differ
ence and sedition we would be better
without it," declared Sir Abbas in
concluding his address. "But differ
ences in religion are due to the imita
tions of dogma. If the reality behind
all religions should be investigated
they all would be unified.
"We are all the progeny of one man,
Adam. All are of one family, one
lineage. Everything on this earth is
dust. Must we behead our fellowman
for dust? Earth merely is a grave
yard for all Eternity. Shall we fight
over our own graveyard? What ig
norance!"
