# An Epoch.

The Faculty Committee on Public
Exercises is to be congratulated in
securing so interesting an Assembly

speaker as the eminent
Persian, Abd-ul-Baha. The
romance thrown around

him by his exile and narrow escapes
from death, coupled with his poetical
expression and deliverance, made his
talk one to be long remembered. That
another Assembly was granted to fol
low at the next hour to welcome the
Australians was highly appreciated by
the students. It was their oppor
tunity to formally turn over the cam
pus to the representatives of the great
commonwealth in the south seas.
Thus, in some measure, they could
show their appreciation of the recep
tion accorded the American rugby
representatives when they visited the
Antipodes.
