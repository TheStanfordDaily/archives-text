# Disturbers.

An unfortunate incident marred the
closing of the first Assembly. As Dr.

Jordan arose to make a
few remarks, the doors
in the back of the hall

opened and a considerable number of
students came noisily in, drowning the
President's words. If these gentle
men did not desire to attend the lirst
Assembly there was all the more rea
son why they should not be a dis
turbing factor.
