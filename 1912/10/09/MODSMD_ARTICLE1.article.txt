# SANTA CLARA WINS 3-0 IN AN EXCITING BATTLE
## FRESHMEN LOSE TO CATHOLIC COLLEGIANS. Semi-Final First-Year Rugby Game Marked by Abundance of Ginger on Both Sides. 
### 
J. C. Urban was elected captain of
the Freshman fifteen this afternoon
before the game witli Santa Clara.
Urban has played a fast, consistent
game at whiff from the beginning of
tire season. Ho registers from Marys
vilie in the Botany department.

In two thirty-minute halves full of
the most snappy rugby, the Freshmen
and Santa Clara battled on the turf
this afternoon. The first-year players
showed a remarkable improvement
over their form of the first of the sea
son, and made a creditable fight
against their formidable opponents.
The game did not open up well, the
play showing that tendency which has
marked the season to be monopolized
by the forwards.
For the Freshmen, Dingley, Captain
Urban, McKall and Murray aided ma
terially in the backfield gains. Ding
ley's footwork was excellent.
For Santa Clara, Momson was the
pick of the backfield, while Jackson's
long brots from the fullback's station
found the line for good gains. The
forwards as a whole worked to fair
advantage, but few individual stars
appeared. The play of Quill was
noticeable on several occasions.
Throughout the first half the Fresh
men displayed their mettle by playing
on equal terms with a team but little
weaker than that which held the Wa
ratahs to a 20-8 tcore. The play was
full of ginger, the teams taking turn
about at menacing the goal line of the

opponents.
The latter part of the second half
furnished the most exciting moments

of play. Both teams fought to the
extent of their powers.
First Half.
Edwards kicked off for the Fresh
men, the ball being returned by Ybar
rando to the Stanford 45. Santa Clara
was awarded a free kick, and the ball
was dribbled to the 15 line. Here the
babes rallied, and play slowly went
through center to their opponents' 10.
This advantage was not long held, and
after several minutes of play by the
forwards, the Freshmen were again on
the defensive near their 10 yard line.
Dingley gave the Mission players a
sharp tussle when he followed the ball
deep into Santa Clara territory. The
Freshman forwards strengthened and
their dribbling held play in midfield
for several minutes. Ybarrando was
caught again and again with the ball,
and the good booting of Jackson at full
alone prevented a Freshman score.
With the ball rarely out of the nack,
play worked close to the Stanford goal
posts. Murray saved a moment later
when a short kick sent the nigskin
across the line. Santa Clara was
awarded a free kick, but Ybarrando
failed to locate the posts.
Second Half.
One minute of scrum work after the
kickoff was enough to work the ball
well within the Freshman danger
zone, and ten minutes of lively play
failed to change its position. The
Freshmen were awarded a free-kick,
but gained only a yard or two.
McKall saved for the Freshmen.
Campbell replaced Brown. Urban led
the backs in a dribbling rush into
Santa Clara ground. Best secured in
a lineout at center and went the
length of the field for a score. Ybar
rando failed.
Score, Santa Clara 3, Freshmen 0.
