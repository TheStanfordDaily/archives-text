# ACTORS HAVE PICTURES TAKEN OUT-OF-ROORS.
## 
### 
Pictures of the entire cast of "Ram
bling Rameses" were taken on Sunday.
Two dozen views were snapped, and.
contrary to the genera] custom, were
made out of doors. To get the desert
and outdoor atmosphere the arboretum
and scenes around the museum were
taken as backgrounds.
These pictures were taken in full
costume and show the cast just as
they will appeai on the evening of the
play, October 18. Making a change
in the general manner of presenting
the photographs on the Quad, they
will this time be placed in large
wooden frames.
