# INTERNATIONAL RUGBY TO BE FULL OF THRILLERS
## Varsity Contest Will Follow Final Freshman Game With Fast Oakland High School Fifteen. 
### 
Stanford Varsity will lineup to
morrow afternoon for the first of its
long heralded and much anticipated
games with the Waratahs. From the
point of view of the rugby enthusiast
no contests of the season will afford
more interest than these, and in all
respects they rank second in impor
tance only to the Intercollegiate
match.
The interest of the fans in tomor
row's contest is heightened by the
hope that the Cardinal players may
win from their visitors. Some con
sideration of the two teams indicates
that this hope is not without founda
tion. *
It is of course true that to win the
Varsity will have to play an infinitely
harder game than the Australian
team. The great cleverness of the
visitors and their long experience in
the finer points of the game will make
this necessary. But the Varsity is
just the team to outfight these experi
ruggers and win. The Cardinal play
ers are accustomed to a more strenu
ous style of play than the Australians;
their condition is superior; and the
Stanford fifteen which goes on the
field tomorrow will be one of the
strongest possible combinations. On
the other hand, the Australians will
be in a position to put up the strongest
game they have plaved on American
soil. A we -k's practice on the local
turf, and the two previously played
games, should remedy their weakness
arising from the fact that they had

never before played together as a
team. Their lack of condition, which
acted as a handicap in the games im
mediately after arrival, should have
largely disappeared by tomorrow af
ternoon.
Only two Stanford players of the
! very first order, Decius and Sanborn,
will be out of the game tomorrow.
I Corbett, Bly, and Sinclair will form
the strong trio of front rankers. Ow
ing to the remarkable ability of thb
Waratah hookers the ball will prob
ably come out of the scrum to Cap
tain Cass comparatively few times, but
other methods of attack may be found
to offset this difficulty. The benefit of
the weight, size and experience of
Smith and Partridge, two old reliables,
will be felt in the middle rank and in
the lineout. Schaupp, in condition
once more, will play in the rear rank,
while Frank will be seen in a Car
dinal uniform for the first time this
season. This speedy and oft-scoring
breakaway will have a fit companion
in Gard.
In the backfl?ld Coach Presley will
put in approximately his strongest
combination, as follows: Cass, Harri
gan, Kern, Reeves, Templeton, Noble
and Erb. These tried and sturdy
veterans will l:e relied upon to play
hard the defensive or offensive as the
rapid game The team selected
by Manager Bchramann and Captain
Prenlice, will be all-star in its char
acter.
Season tickets, plus twenty-five
cents, will admit to the game. Gen
eral admission will be fifty cents.
Freshman Game.
Before this international match the
Freshmen will lineup against the Oak
land High school fifteen. This will be
the final game of the season for the
first-year team. After the end of the
season about twenty sweaters will be
awarded to the Freshmen on the basis
of the showing made during all games
played. As the right to wear the
numerals is still bitterly contested in
some instances, the game tomorrow
should be interesting on this account.
On September 13 the Oakland team
defeated the California Freshmen by
a 3-0 score. The high school lads put
up a strong game. Graves made the
try for Oakland in the first half, and
during the scoreless second period
the school players had all the better
of it except for a few moments.
Hanley, first five, Skinner, wing,
Garthwaite, half, and Graves, a front
ranker, are among the stellar players
of the Oakland fifteen.
The Freshmen-Oakland contest will
be called at 2:30.
