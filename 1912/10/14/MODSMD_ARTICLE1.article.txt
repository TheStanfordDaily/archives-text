# AUSTRALIAN EXPERT ON RUGBY PAYS STANFORD VARSITY HIGH TRIBUTE
## 
### W.W. Hill, Secretary of the New South Wales Rugby Union 
As an onlooker I was distinctly
gratified at the splendid showing of
the Stanford men on Saturday. The
play showed that the Cardinals have
developed tackling and good, lengthy
line kicking to a very high degree.
The low, hard, deadly tackling of both
forwards and backs was most effective,
and the kicking, especially by fulr
back Erb, was accurate, and gained a
large amount of ground. In some
cases the attacking work of Stanford,
when great things looked likely, lack
ed the finish of more experienced men,
and I should certainly advise the team,
now that their defence has been shown
to be so sound, to develop attacking
work. There is a time honored and
generally accepted theme that attach
is the best defence, and it must be ap
parent to all that it takes scores to
win games; and to put up scores soma
finish must be given to well started
attacking moves. As a study there is
nothing so interesting as the evolving
of new ideas in combined attack, and
in Rugby there is always room for a
thinker, and always an opportunity
for the player who gets away from the
orthodox, and plays his own game,
with, of course, the co-operation and
concurrence of his comrades.
One phase of the game cannot be
too greatly emphasised, and that is
the cleanness and good spirit permeat-.
ing the whole game. It was true
Rugby spiritâ€”clean, hard, but friend
ly.
