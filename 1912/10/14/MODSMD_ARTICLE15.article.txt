# AUSTRALIANS ARE GUESTS AT UNIVERSITY JOLLY-UP.
## 
### 
With all the attendant features and
informality characteristic of affairs of
the kind at Stanford, a large portion
of the student body were gathered
Friday evening in the Palo Alto Ar
mory to greet the visiting Australians
at a University Jolly-up. A crowded
floor, excellent music, customary
stunts, eats, and a general expression
of good fellowship and carefreeness
marked the "hurry up," as the visitors
styled it, which served as a vehicle
to evince the open-heartedness of the
welcome to the trans-Pacific residents
from far-away Australia.
