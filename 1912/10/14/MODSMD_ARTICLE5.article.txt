# AUSTRALIANS CROSS VARSITY LINE BUT ONCE IN EIGHTY-MINUTE GAME
## 
### 
One thrill followed fast upon another
as two great rugby teams battled upon
Stanford Field. Saturday afternoon.
The playing of the Australians was
well-nigh a revelation, and the ."core
of 6-0 speaks eloquently of the splen
did defensive Cardinal game.
If the cleverness of the Waratahs
was a revelation to the Varsity men.
the fight and intense earnestness of
the latter was such to their visiting
opponents. Could the Stanford team
develop an attack equal to its defense,
"invincible" would be its proper ad
jective.
\ "Spoiling (Jiune."
The inability to form a strong
scoring combination is now the most
serious weakness of the Varsity. Ii
played Saturday what the Australians
called a "spoiling game," in the sense
that its efforts were chiefly devoted
to breaking up its opponents' attack.
Contrary to hope, the game was not
an open one. This was in part the
logical result of the fact that the two
fifteens were so evenly matched. The
backs of both teams were assiduous
in endeavoring to prevent the ball
from journeying far out toward the
opposing wing. A long passing rush
by the Australians must needs have
been perfectly executed to escape the
attentions of the ever-present Car
dinal backs and breakaways. As a
matter of fact, no apparent attempt at
such a style of play was made by the
visitors, and in many instances the
ball got no further than the hands of
Captain Prentice, who either attempt
ed to pick a hole in the opposing de
fence or booted it to the forwards.
As a consequence, the battle was
fought out largely among the hard
worked veterans of the scrum; and it
was a wonderful fie;ht. Finer playing
fhan that done by the opposing break
aways, Wylie and Richards and Frank
and Card, or by Pugh, Griffin, Part
ridge, Smith and Schaupp, or by any
of their fellow forwards, could not be
demanded.
Tiro firent Fullbneks.
The occupants of the last post of
lefence proved themselves two of the

greatest fullbacks ever seen in action
on Ihe Stanford turf. Erb was un
doubtedly the bright star of the Stan
ford team. Invariably his long spirals
found the touch line; and the way in
which he extricated himself from
swarms of opposing players to get
his quick kick away with either foot
gav'> fierce joy to the bleacherites.
[lis tackling was sure and hard,
though on one or two occasions he left
a dangerous open space behind him
in order to block dribbling plays.
Dwyer, the great Waratah full, was
his worthy opponent. He was a fast,
reliable player, and was excelled by
Erb in no respect except length of
kick.
As anticipated, the Cardinal for
wards heeled the ball out to their half
comparatively few times. Griffin,
probably the premier hooker of the !
world, and his fellows, proved too
much for their Varsity opponents.
This weakness was to a great extent 1
counterbalanced by the aggressive de
fensive play of the Stanford backs and
the breakaways. Frank signalized his
reappearance by showing wonderful
speed and dash, figuring at times in
whirlwind bits of work that brought i
to mind vivid pictures of well-remem
bered plays in last year's intercollegi
ate game. His eagerness at times
tended to lead him into the pitfalls
of offside play. The entire Varsity
was a too-frequent offender in this
matter.
Referee Reading was eminently fair
and had his eye on the game at all
times, with the exception that he
occasionally failed to watch his touch
lines closely. His decisions as to fair
catches were not entirely consistent.
First Half.
Erb kicked off for Stanford, sending
•he ball far down the field. Frank fol
lowed up too strenuously, and Austra
lia was awarded a free kick. Shortly
after, Stanford was given a free boot
■it their 35 on Pugh's offside. Erb
starred at this point, when he took a
'on? punt, ran twenty yards, and found
touch at the Waratah 25.
