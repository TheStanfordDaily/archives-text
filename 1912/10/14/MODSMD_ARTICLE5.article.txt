# AUSTRALIANS CROSS VARSITY LINE BUT ONCE IN EIGHTY-MINUTE GAME
## 
### 
One thrill followed fast upon another
as two great rugby teams battled upon
Stanford Field. Saturday afternoon.
The playing of the Australians was
well-nigh a revelation, and the ."core
of 6-0 speaks eloquently of the splen
did defensive Cardinal game.
If the cleverness of the Waratahs
was a revelation to the Varsity men.
the fight and intense earnestness of
the latter was such to their visiting
opponents. Could the Stanford team
develop an attack equal to its defense,
"invincible" would be its proper ad
jective.
\ "Spoiling (Jiune."
The inability to form a strong
scoring combination is now the most
serious weakness of the Varsity. Ii
played Saturday what the Australians
called a "spoiling game," in the sense
that its efforts were chiefly devoted
to breaking up its opponents' attack.
Contrary to hope, the game was not
an open one. This was in part the
logical result of the fact that the two
fifteens were so evenly matched. The
backs of both teams were assiduous
in endeavoring to prevent the ball
from journeying far out toward the
opposing wing. A long passing rush
by the Australians must needs have
been perfectly executed to escape the
attentions of the ever-present Car
dinal backs and breakaways. As a
matter of fact, no apparent attempt at
such a style of play was made by the
visitors, and in many instances the
ball got no further than the hands of
Captain Prentice, who either attempt
ed to pick a hole in the opposing de
fence or booted it to the forwards.
As a consequence, the battle was
fought out largely among the hard
worked veterans of the scrum; and it
was a wonderful fie;ht. Finer playing
fhan that done by the opposing break
aways, Wylie and Richards and Frank
and Card, or by Pugh, Griffin, Part
ridge, Smith and Schaupp, or by any
of their fellow forwards, could not be
demanded.
Tiro firent Fullbneks.
The occupants of the last post of
lefence proved themselves two of the

greatest fullbacks ever seen in action
on Ihe Stanford turf. Erb was un
doubtedly the bright star of the Stan
ford team. Invariably his long spirals
found the touch line; and the way in
which he extricated himself from
swarms of opposing players to get
his quick kick away with either foot
gav'> fierce joy to the bleacherites.
[lis tackling was sure and hard,
though on one or two occasions he left
a dangerous open space behind him
in order to block dribbling plays.
Dwyer, the great Waratah full, was
his worthy opponent. He was a fast,
reliable player, and was excelled by
Erb in no respect except length of
kick.
As anticipated, the Cardinal for
wards heeled the ball out to their half
comparatively few times. Griffin,
probably the premier hooker of the !
world, and his fellows, proved too
much for their Varsity opponents.
This weakness was to a great extent 1
counterbalanced by the aggressive de
fensive play of the Stanford backs and
the breakaways. Frank signalized his
reappearance by showing wonderful
speed and dash, figuring at times in
whirlwind bits of work that brought i
to mind vivid pictures of well-remem
bered plays in last year's intercollegi
ate game. His eagerness at times
tended to lead him into the pitfalls
of offside play. The entire Varsity
was a too-frequent offender in this
matter.
Referee Reading was eminently fair
and had his eye on the game at all
times, with the exception that he
occasionally failed to watch his touch
lines closely. His decisions as to fair
catches were not entirely consistent.
First Half.
Erb kicked off for Stanford, sending
•he ball far down the field. Frank fol
lowed up too strenuously, and Austra
lia was awarded a free kick. Shortly
after, Stanford was given a free boot
■it their 35 on Pugh's offside. Erb
starred at this point, when he took a
'on? punt, ran twenty yards, and found
touch at the Waratah 25.


Attack and Defense in Australian Danger Zone.
The Australians were awarded a
free kick in Stanford danger zone, and
Prentice fai!ed to goal the ball. When
the visitors rallied at the Cardinal 10
Sinclair booted from the pack to 25.
A moment later Walker kicked over
the line, and Erb returned the ball to
the field. With the Australians on the
aggressive, Erb starred again and
in fine boots to touch.
Andrews replaced Reeves at center.
The Waratahs were awarded a free
kick at Stanford 40, and Prentice nar
rowly missed a score. Good boots by
Erb, a passing rush, Harrigan, Kern,
Noble, Harrigan and a rally on the
Blues' 5, raised the Cardinal hopes
hi<rh, but fine dribbling by the op
posing forwards sent the pigskin back
to the 45. The ball was in play deep
in Stanford ground at half time.

Second Half.

A. Erb replaced Cass at half. The
Cardinal fifteen opened with a rush,
and after Frank's interception play
swept down the field to within
striking distance of the Waratah goal.
But the defending line was strong and
two minutes' play found Prentice
again attempting a field goal from the
Cardinal 30. Peck replaced Corbett in
front rank. Play returned for a short
period to the visitors' ground and
Dwyer was forced to save. Adamson
replaced Meibush, the Australian wing,
and shortly after starred in a good run
down the field. A boot over the goal
line again cost Stanford ground, and
after the twenty-five yards dropout the
hall went to touch at center. Erb
stopped up two dangerous dribbling
rushes, but the ball got as far as the
Cardinal ten yard line. At this point
Smith starred in a long boot to the
side line at midfield. The respite was
not for long and a passing rush, Wal
ker, Prentice, Adamson, Prentice,
sent Adamson over for the first try of
the game. Prentice failed to convert.
Score, 3-0.
With the blue-jerseyed men on the
aggressive, the pack slowly worked
into Stanford territory. Walker got
away with the ball, Erb missed his
tackle, and the fleet half reached
Stanford's 5 before he was downed by
Kern. A minute later Prentice was
given another opportunity for a field
goal, and this time he sent the pig
skin directly between the uprights
from a wide angle. Score 6-0.
Stanford cut loose with grim deter
mination, and the play to the close
was sharp and fast. The ball zig
zagged from the Cardinal forty to the
visitors' ten, with Kern, Harrigan and
Schaupp starring in aggressive play.
Kern found touch from center at 5,
but a score was prevented when the
ball was lost in a passing rush. The
crack of the gun ended the play at
Australia's 25.
Freshmen Game.
In the final Freshmen contest of the
season victory perched upon the 1916
banner. By gaining three tries and
converting one of them, the first year
players defeated Oakland High School
with an 11-0 score.
Poth backfiehls worked to good ad
vantage. In the scrum honors were
fairly well divided, but in rucking and
dribbling the Freshmen showed greater
ability.
Ita'i'ey was the bright star of the
visiting aggregation, and he was well
seconded by O.onzales, Graves, Leeds
and Miller.
A half minute of play was enough
for the Freshmen to send Adams over
I he Oakland goal line for a try. Cass
failed to convert from a difficult angle.

Score, 3-0. Oakland pressed for a few
minutes and then play was fairly even
for the remainder of the half.
With the opening of the second
period the Freshmen took the defen
sive to stem the Oakland rush, Then
opening up with a fine passing rush,
Laine fell on the ball. Cass failed to
convert. Score, 6-0. Good passing
from a five-yard scrum, Brown, Wick
ersham, sent, Murray across for the
third try. Cass converted. Final
score: Freshmen, 11; Oakland, 0.
