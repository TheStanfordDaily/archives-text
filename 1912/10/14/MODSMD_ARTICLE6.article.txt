# INTERNATIONAL RUGBY CONTEST ON STANFORD FIELD IS GALA AFFAIR
## 
### 
Far-famed California skies could
scarcely have been more radiant or
the day more auspicious for the match
between the Blue of Australia and the
Cardinal of Stanford than Saturday.
International rugby with the picked
players of the Antipodes and the Var
sity's best as the rival fifteens was the
focus of the interested hundreds who
filled the west side bleachers and made
it necesseary for many to find places
on the opposite side of the field.
Never before has such a crowd been
attendant at a preliminary contest.
The trtal attendance numbered close
to 3000.
Contrasted with the somber green
of the turf with its struggling players
were the animated bleachers, admir
ing, applauding, and cheering the fa
vorites as the play serpented from ont>
danger zone to the other. Motordom
claimed a goodly representation. It
was an afternoon of brilliance and
peninsula society with a wealth of the
latest of Parisian creations added not
a little to the festive aop?aranee which
heretofore has been evidenced only at
the big game.
Fellow-countrymen of the visitors,
eager for an opportunity to cheer the
fleet Australian ruggers who had come
so far from home to compete with
America's best, metropolitan journa
lists and rugby experts, alumni, for
mer students, undergraduates, and the
Stanford bandsmen were there. The
same magnet attracted each. The
game was the thing.
