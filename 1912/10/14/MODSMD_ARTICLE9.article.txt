# A
						Clean Game.

### 
The team that represented Stanford
in the game with the Australians on

Saturday was a credit to the
University. Never has a
Stanford team played with
better spirit than did they.

After the game one of the Australian
backs told us that It was the cleanest
game that he ever played in. We often
hear the criticism that there is too
much underhand playing in the col
lege football games of the United
States. This may be true with the old
game but it is not true of rugby at
Stanford. The way the Australians
played the game and the Stanford
method differed in rugby science but
not in the sportsmanship of clean play.
