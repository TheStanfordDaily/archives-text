# SOPHOMORES ANNOUNCE THE COTILLION DATE
## SECOND SATURDAY AFTER BIG GAME IS CHOSEN. 1915 Formal Dance Will be Held on November 23 at the Armory, Palo Alto. 
### 
November 23 is to be the date of
the Sophomore Cotillion. The com
mittee met recently to discuss the
plans for this formal dance, which is.
given each year by the second-year
class, and decided that it? should take
place in the Palo Alto Armory instead
of Encina, where it was held last year.
Carriages and flowers are to be ab
solutely forbidden, in accordance with
the custom. The committee wishes to
make this very emphatic and asks that
no infringements of the ruling be
made.
There will be fourteen regular
dances and two extras on the pro
gram. McDonald's orchestra will fur
nish the music for the dancers.
L. F. Reineman, chairman of the
committee, announces that the price
of the tickets will be, as in former
years, two dollars and fifty cents.
They will be placed on sale in about
two weeks at the usual place. Pro
grams may be obtained later at the
Bookstore.
