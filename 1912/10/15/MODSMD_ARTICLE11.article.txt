Calling up an echo of the spirit that
led to the formation of Stanford's im
mortal list of Spanish War recruits in
1898, W. F. Kilcline's article, "The
Stanford Volunteers," hills the first
pages of the strong October issue of
the "Sequoia," which will be on sale
tomorrow.
Readable fiction appears under the
names of Miss M. Bailey, '14, and C. F.
Paul, '13. "Once," the name of Miss
Bailey's story, suggests any number of
interesting possibilities that may have
been woven into story-form. The au
thor in this case has taken a near-tear
one, and treated it well.
"Charlie's Dress Suit," by C. F.
Paul, affords copious smiles, with per
haps a laugh or two thrown in. Stan
ford spirit, the lure of the footlights
in a ten-cent show, and the troubles of
a metropolitan daily correspondent
are stirred into an entertaining kalei
doscope of action.
In "The Flax," a symbolic play of
Irish peasant life, Miss M. C. Driscoll,
'13, has interwoven an Interesting
story with a charming imagery that
is suggestive of Yeats, both in con
ception and in diction.
The editorial page this month is
filled with a review of several condi
tions of campus life, treated in a
critical manner. The editorial com
ments deal with the "Rack Bills" of
the 1912 class, "Changing Names,"
with reference to the "Daily Palo
Alto," and "Ways of Showing Spirit,"
among other things.
