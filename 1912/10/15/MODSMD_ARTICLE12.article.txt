# PLUG UGLY MANUSCRIPTS ARE DUE NEXT TUESDAY.
## 
### 
Junior pictures for the Quad are all
to be taken within the next two weeks,
in order that this department of the
third-year book may be disposed of,
and more time devoted to the other
departments of the annual. Both Edi
tor-in-Chief C. C. Close and Manager
S. J. Sharp particularly emphasized
this point in their reports to the 1914
class this afternoon.
E. A. Wells, chairman of the Plug
Ugly committee, asked that all manu
scripts for the Plug Ugly Farce be
mailed to him by next Tuesday, in
order that final arrangements may be
completed at an eaiiy date. The old
lines along which the Junior poster
has been made during the past few
years will not be followed and the
campus may expect something new in
this line.
