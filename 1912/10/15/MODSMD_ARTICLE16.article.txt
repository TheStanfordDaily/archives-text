# Cut Loose.
## 
### 
The bleachers added "that psycho
logical something" to last Saturday's

game with the Austra
lians. The playing of
the Stanford Varsity was

ample proof of that. Tomorrow we
want a repetition. The Big Game is
drawing close and it is time that the
rooters began to cut loose. Keep it
up. Its the spirit of victory.
