# SOUTH AMERICAN INSECT ODDITIES ARE RECEIVED.
## Valuable Collection Added to Entomology Department by Recent Branner Expedition. 
### 
Many-hued beetles, giant grass-hop
pers, cock-roaches, ants, walking
"sticks," and lantern-flies form the
nucleus of a valuable collection of
Brazilian insect oddities made for the
Entomology department on the recent
Branner Expedition to South America.
The specimens were recently received
from \V. M. Mann, '09, the insect-col
lector of the expedition, who is now
at Harvard.
Interesting cases of mimicry, both
of form and color, are illustrated by
the collection, which is considered
valuable chiefly because it bears out
the principles of biology which have
been made by former scientists in thb
Brazilian field.
Mann reports that he found the
lantern-fly to be the subject of many
native tales. When it makes its
blind flights at night, its head becomes
luminous. Natives are said to catch
a lantern fly by allowing it to rush
against a skin shield and become im
paled on its own beak. The fly is
about the size of a large grass-hopper,
and is similar in appearance.
