# AUSTRALIAN WARATAHS WILL PLAY STANFORD LAST TIME TOMORROW
## 
### 
With radical changes throughout the
Cardinal lineup and three new names
appearing in the list of Australian
players, the second international game
will be waged tomorrow afternoon on
the turf.
The Varsity lineup, though contain
ing a number of substitute players,
will be by no means a weak one. In
the backfield, the only players who ap
peared on the field at the note of the
first whistle Saturday afternoon will
be Harrigan and Kern at the fives and
Bennie Erb at full. Art Erb will play
behind the scrum in the half-back's
station, as he did during the second
period of the previous game. Ris
ling's appearance at center three will
be greeted with interest and approval
by many; and particularly noteworthy
will be the appearance of that speedy,
hard-playing pair of Freshman wings,
Dingley and Urban.
In the front rank of the scrum Sin
clair, Single, and Peck will probably
form the trio to oppose George,
Griffin and Watson. Smith and Part
ridge will again lend the benefit of
their weight, skill, and experience in
the middle rank. The third row will
be composed of Darsie, Lull, and
Thoburn.
Since the Waratahs will send on the

field a fifteen not materially differing
from the victorious one of last Satur
day, the chances of the Cardinal to
win can scarcely be deemed as bright
as they appeared before the first
game. However, the Stanford fifteen
for tomorrow is by no means a weak
one, and the infusion of fresh material
together with the lessons learned by
the men through watching the pre
ceding game may result in a surprise
to the fans. Win or lose, the game
should be a fine rugby exhibition.
Contrary to the order of previous
Wednesday games, and to the an
nouncements 011 the bulletin boards,
the contest will begin at four o'clock.
Fifty cents, or season tickets with the
addition of twenty-five cents will be
necessary to admit.
Wednesday's lineups as announced
today follow:
Varsity — Sinclair, Single, Peck,
Smith, Partridge, Darsie, Lull, Tho
burn, forwards; A. Erb, half; Harri
gan, Kern, fives; Risling, center;
Dingley, Urban, wings; Erb, full.
Australians —George, Griffin, Wat
son, Pugh, Fahey, Wylie, Fraser, Cun
nigham, forwards; Walker, half;
Prentice, Tasker, fives; Adamson, cen
ter; Carroll, Wogan, wings; Dwyer,
full.
