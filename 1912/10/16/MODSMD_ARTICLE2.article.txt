# ”RAMBLING RAMESES” PLOT PRESENTS GOOD COMEDY.
## Two Acts Laid in Egypt Offer Setting of Rare Oriental Splendor. 
### 
Differing from the majority of Comic
Operas, "Rambling Rameses" is a
piece that hinges around a well-defined
plot. Two acts, with the settings in
Egypt, afford stage opportunities that
will be entirely new to the present
Stanford generation.
The first act is laid at the Oasis of
Hari Frou Frou. A rainbow on the
desert —a sacred sign of the coming
of Rameses—offers the opportunity to
two traveling Americans to imper
sonate the real Rameses and thus
claim the throne. The same evening
a celebration is held in honor of
Rameses and during the festivals the
false Americans are found out and
exposed to the natives as rank im- i
posters. Kerjopf, the present ruler,
sentences the Americans to death at
noon on the morrow.
The false Rameses' plans have been !
financed by a wealthy widow who is \
traveling with a party of Cook's tour- j
ists. The guide of this expedition is j
A. Fee, Rameses' partner. A beauti
ful daughter of the widow is much
sought after by all the members in
the party and their numerous efforts
to win her afford many amusing situa
tions. All finally ends well and the
impostors escape with the entire party
of tourists.
gov a ral good seats are still left at
the Bookstore and at Weingartner's.
