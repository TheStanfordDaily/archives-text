# STANFORD 13-AUSTRALIANS 12
## AUSTRALIAN FORWARDS IN ACTION Spectacular Rugby on Stanford Field is Featured in International Match This Afternoon. 
### 
Excitement time after time brought
the rooters to their feet in a frenzy
during this afternoon's game. A Car
dinal team composed largely of second
team players battled against the (lower
of Australia and rolled up a score of
13 to the 12 of the Bines in a game
which at times showed the finest of
open rugby.
Incessantly the ball was hurried
from one end of the field to the other
by perfect dribbling or passing rushes.
The second Australian and third Stan
ford tries came as the result of pass
ing rallies, for the superior of which
the most hardened critic could not ask.
When the teams ran out on the
field it was seen that several eleventh
hour changes had been made in both
lineups. Rut practically every man
who went on the field without a pre
vious rugby reputation made one this
afternoon.
Bennie Erb repeated his starring
performance of last Saturday, and got
away his wonderful long spirals to
touch with clock-like regularity. His
brother played good ball at half; Noble
was a master both in offense and de
fence, and the new player, Andrews,
stamped himself as a comer and more.
The Freshmen sent in did their full
share of work, as did every member
of the fifteen.
Though the play was more evenly
divided between forwards and backs
than was the case last Saturday, each
member of the scrum played a master
ly game.
The Australians played even more of
a fast passing style than in the previ
ous contest, but the strain of that
match was at times apparent.
A warm, bright, California afternoon
was afforded the players, and pro
duced the usual inspiration of so
called "ideal" football weather. The
gala aspect of the weather was dupli
cated by the appearance of the bleach
ers. The crowd in the stands and the
long string of automobiles outside
marked the game as one the like of
which is seldom seen on a Wednesday.
President David Starr Jordan was

among the notables to acquire a
rooter's seat early. Chester Rovvell,
the progressive leader, was also an
interested spectator.
About a dozen California ruggers,
most of them Varsity players, follow
ed the play with close attention from
tilt bleachers at the end of the field.
Coach J. G. SchaelTer, Graduate Man
ager VV. Donald, Captain Johnny
Stroud, Peart, McKim, Evans, Allen
and other well-known figures in trans
bay rugby circles were present.
An unfortunate incident of the first
half was the accident to Jim Wylie,
The big Waratah breakaway has been
a favorite with players and rooters.
He received a severe kick in the back,
and while it is possible that he may
have broken a floating rib, it is be
lieved that the injury will not prove
serious.

Rennie Erb's wonderful kick to
touch has averted many a score by
other teams before today's contest.
Time and again his sure boot has sent
the play into midfield when a score
threatened.
Under full head of steam Ralph
Noble and Bertie Risling tore sixty
yards down the field to a try and fur
nished the prime thrill of a half full
of thrillers. Single was credited with
the other Stanford score, while Mur
phy and Carroll were the Blues to
carry the ball across. This scoring
left the scoreboard reading 8-6 in

favor of Stanford at the gun's report.
The half was hotly contested and ag
gressive throughout, and toward the
end of the forty-minute period it was
evident that the fierce pace was be
ginning to tell upon the men.
First Half.
The teams had an even start after
the whislte, as the ball went into the
scrum for the first time at center. A
kick down field, and a dribbling rush
sent play into Stanford territory.
Erb booted to touch out of danger. He
starred a few minutes later with a
long boot to the sidelines at center.
The Waratahs started a passing rush,
but good tackling and Erb's sure boot
proved a stone wall of defence. A
slow dribbling rush for forty yards
put the ball on Stanford's 10, and a
broken passing rush sent Murphy over
for a try. Prentice failed to convert.
An instant later Noble got the ball
at his 45 and went down an open fiel
to the Waratah 10. A long kick to
touch saved for the Australians and
play returned to center. Erb starred
in two remarkable boots to touch. A
broken rush carried the ball from the
40 to the 5. Decius booted across the
I line and Single fell on the ball. Erb
I failed from a difficult angle. Score,
The Waratah line was again in
danger in the next minute's play, but
a free kick relieved the pressure.
Clover intercepted a pass and got
away for 10 yards. After the Varsity
had been penalized for Erb's knock
fin, the fullba'ck thrilled the bleachers
again with a long boot to center. The
Blues saved a moment later when the
ball was booted across the line and
play went into Varsity territory.
>ol>le's Grout Hun.
At the 45 Noble secured and rushed
the ball through a scattered field to
the Australian 25, passed to Risling
and the latter went over for a try.

Dribbling was next in order and the
Cardinal forwards went down the
field for 45 yards, where the ball went
into a 5 yard scrum.

j went down a clear field, passed to

Carroll added three points to the
; team's score. Prentice failed to con
i vert. Score, 8-6.
Five minutes zigzag play followed,
with Smith, Andrews, Noble and Erb
|
in the limelight. A short boot and a
! 15 yard run by Urban sent the tide of
battle inside the Blue's danger zone.
Stanford was awarded a try for a field
goal at the 25, but the angle proved
| too difficult. Dwyer proved a consist
lent ground gainer for his team, and
half time found the ball on the Var
sity 25.
Second Half.
Erb found touch at the kickoff and
the teams scrummed up at center.
Dribbling by Risling, Thoburn, An
drews and Smith gained 20 yards, and
three minutes of hard play did not
materially change the ball's position.
From a lineout at Stanford's twenty,
sharp dribbling sent the pack to the
five. Here the Waratah backs again
got into the game and Walker went
across. Prentice failed on the con
version. Dingley replaced Noble.
Peek started the pack down field by a
20 yard run. Darsie secured the ball
at t lie 35 a moment later, carried it

diagonally across the field and passed
to Urban, who scored. Erb sent the
pigskin between the uprights from an
almost impossible angle. Score stood
13-D.
Risling, Tholnirn and Dingley fea
tured with a beautiful run to Austra
lia's 5.
Dribbling Hushes.
Sharp dribbling rushes of both
teams zigzaged the ball the length of
the field. Andrews figured in a neat
dribbling rush to 15. Kern replaced
Risling. Australia was awarded a free
kick at their 20. Play was sharp and
fast and the two goals were alternate
ly threatened. Cass replaced A. Erb.
The fourth try for the Australians
was made by Carroll who went across
in a fine passing rush from the 25.
Prentice failed to convert the difficult
goal and the score remained 13-12.
The ball went out at midfield at final
time.
