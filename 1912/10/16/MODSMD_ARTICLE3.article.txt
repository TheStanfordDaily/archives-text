# STANFORD 13-AUSTRALIANS 12
## AUSTRALIAN FORWARDS IN ACTION Spectacular Rugby on Stanford Field is Featured in International Match This Afternoon. 
### 
Excitement time after time brought
the rooters to their feet in a frenzy
during this afternoon's game. A Car
dinal team composed largely of second
team players battled against the (lower
of Australia and rolled up a score of
13 to the 12 of the Bines in a game
which at times showed the finest of
open rugby.
Incessantly the ball was hurried
from one end of the field to the other
by perfect dribbling or passing rushes.
The second Australian and third Stan
ford tries came as the result of pass
ing rallies, for the superior of which
the most hardened critic could not ask.
When the teams ran out on the
field it was seen that several eleventh
hour changes had been made in both
lineups. Rut practically every man
who went on the field without a pre
vious rugby reputation made one this
afternoon.
Bennie Erb repeated his starring
performance of last Saturday, and got
away his wonderful long spirals to
touch with clock-like regularity. His
brother played good ball at half; Noble
was a master both in offense and de
fence, and the new player, Andrews,
stamped himself as a comer and more.
The Freshmen sent in did their full
share of work, as did every member
of the fifteen.
Though the play was more evenly
divided between forwards and backs
than was the case last Saturday, each
member of the scrum played a master
ly game.
The Australians played even more of
a fast passing style than in the previ
ous contest, but the strain of that
match was at times apparent.
A warm, bright, California afternoon
was afforded the players, and pro
duced the usual inspiration of so
called "ideal" football weather. The
gala aspect of the weather was dupli
cated by the appearance of the bleach
ers. The crowd in the stands and the
long string of automobiles outside
marked the game as one the like of
which is seldom seen on a Wednesday.
President David Starr Jordan was

among the notables to acquire a
rooter's seat early. Chester Rovvell,
the progressive leader, was also an
interested spectator.
About a dozen California ruggers,
most of them Varsity players, follow
ed the play with close attention from
tilt bleachers at the end of the field.
Coach J. G. SchaelTer, Graduate Man
ager VV. Donald, Captain Johnny
Stroud, Peart, McKim, Evans, Allen
and other well-known figures in trans
bay rugby circles were present.
An unfortunate incident of the first
half was the accident to Jim Wylie,
The big Waratah breakaway has been
a favorite with players and rooters.
He received a severe kick in the back,
and while it is possible that he may
have broken a floating rib, it is be
lieved that the injury will not prove
serious.

Rennie Erb's wonderful kick to
touch has averted many a score by
other teams before today's contest.
Time and again his sure boot has sent
the play into midfield when a score
threatened.
Under full head of steam Ralph
Noble and Bertie Risling tore sixty
yards down the field to a try and fur
nished the prime thrill of a half full
of thrillers. Single was credited with
the other Stanford score, while Mur
phy and Carroll were the Blues to
carry the ball across. This scoring
left the scoreboard reading 8-6 in
