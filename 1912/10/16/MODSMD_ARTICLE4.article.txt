half of the tenth and scored what
looked to be the winning run. Then
came Boston's half of this inning,
when the Los Angeles boy made the
error that started Boston's rally,
which resulted in two runs and the
game.
New York pinned its faith on the
mighty Mathewson to win the cham
pionship, while Boston held the same
faith in the youngster Bedient, who
was replaced by Wood in the eighth
inning.
New York was the first to score,
when Doyle registered on Murray's
double in the third inning. No more
runs were registered until the seventh
frame, when Henriksen, batting for
Bedient, scored Stahl with a double.
In the ninth inning McCormick bat
ted for Fletcher. The latter's place at
short was taken by A. J. Shafer, ex

first up to bat and flew out. Then
Murray and Merkel doubled in suc
cession, the former scoring. Herzog
then fanned, and Meyers made thb
final out.
With the score 2 to 1 against them,
in the last half of the tenth, the Red
Sox scored twice and won the game.
Engle, batting for Wood, hit an easy
fly to Snodgrass which the latter
muffed. Hooper flied out and Engle
took second. Yerkes walked, and a
moment later Speaker singled and
scored Engle with the tying run.
Lewis then walked. Gardner hit a
long fly to Devore, scoring Yerkes, and
the game was over.
Mathewson pitched one of the great
est games of his career and it was
only the unfortunate error of his team
mate that cost the veteran his game.
