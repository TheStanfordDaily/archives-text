# VARSITY JOURNEYS TO MEET RUGGERS IN SOUTH
## TWENTY PLAYERS ARE PICKED TO MAKE TRIP. Trainer H.W. Maloney and R.W. Wilcox Will Accompany Team to Los Angeles. 
### 
Twenty men picked from the Var
sity rugby squad, with Trainer Ma
loney and R. W. Wilcox,'l3, assistant to
the Graduate Manager, will board to
night's southbound "Lark," en route to
Los Angeles, where Saturday they will
meet the fifteen from the University of
Southern California. The players who
have be&n named to represent the
Cardißal form a strong team, and
should furnish the rugby enthusiasts
in the southland a fine exhibition of
the English game.
Coach Presley was unable to jour
ney south with the team tonight, but
will join the players before the game
on Saturday. The contest will be
held on Bovard Field, and as the sup
porters of the southern team are con
fident of its ability to give the north
ern varsity a hard fight, the attendant
crowd is sure to be a record-breaker, j
Five substitutes are to be taken* |
three for the forward division and two
for the backs.
Varsity a Strong Unit.
The front rank will be filled by
Sanborn, Bly and Sinclair. A stronger
combination would be hard to find,
as Bly and Sinclair have proved their
worth in the scrum in the hard games ■
of this season, while Sanborn as a j
hooker is a veteran of two intercol
legiate contests.
Smith is to hold up the scrum in i
middle rank, with Lull as his team
mate. Gard and Frank are slated for
the breakaway positions, and their in- j
valuable experience there should tell j
on the work of the opposing half and j
first five.
Cass will again be in his place be- |
hind the scrum, and will be backed by j
Harrigan and Kern as fives, Risling at
center three-quarters, and Erb at full, j
The wings in Saturday's game will be j
Noble and Reeves.
Peck, Thoburn and Darsie will ac- j
company the team as relief players for j
the forwards, A. Erb will be ready to j
take Captain Cass's place at half, while
Andrews is to be substitute center.
It. W. Wilcox will represent Grad- |
uate Manager Burbank on the trip, and
has secured accommodations for the
squad at the Hollenbeck Hotel. The
players will return to the campus on
Sunday.
Southern Team Weakened.
The fifteen representing the south
ern university is not up to the iisiiril
standard of strength, judging from
their playing thus far in the season
The California Freshmen rolled up a
23 to 3 score against the southerner's
a week ago, though individual stars
were not lacking in the defeated team
Tlifir most apparent fault was lack o,
team work, and the week's practice ■
should materially aid the organized j
play on Saturday.

Southern Team Weakened.
The fifteen representing the south
ern university is not up to the iisiiril
standard of strength, judging from
their playing thus far in the season
The California Freshmen rolled up a
23 to 3 score against the southerner's
a week ago, though individual stars
were not lacking in the defeated team
Tlifir most apparent fault was lack o,
team work, and the week's practice ■
should materially aid the organized j
play on Saturday.
Twenty men picked from the Var
sity rugby squad, with Trainer Ma
loney and R. W. Wilcox,'l3, assistant to
the Graduate Manager, will board to
night's southbound "Lark," en route to
Los Angeles, where Saturday they will
meet the fifteen from the University of
Southern California. The players who
have be&n named to represent the
Cardißal form a strong team, and
should furnish the rugby enthusiasts
in the southland a fine exhibition of
the English game.
Coach Presley was unable to jour
ney south with the team tonight, but
will join the players before the game
on Saturday. The contest will be
held on Bovard Field, and as the sup
porters of the southern team are con
fident of its ability to give the north
ern varsity a hard fight, the attendant
crowd is sure to be a record-breaker, j
Five substitutes are to be taken* |
three for the forward division and two
for the backs.
Varsity a Strong Unit.
The front rank will be filled by
Sanborn, Bly and Sinclair. A stronger
combination would be hard to find,
as Bly and Sinclair have proved their
worth in the scrum in the hard games ■
of this season, while Sanborn as a j
hooker is a veteran of two intercol
legiate contests.
Smith is to hold up the scrum in i
middle rank, with Lull as his team
mate. Gard and Frank are slated for
the breakaway positions, and their in- j
valuable experience there should tell j
on the work of the opposing half and j
first five.
Cass will again be in his place be- |
hind the scrum, and will be backed by j
