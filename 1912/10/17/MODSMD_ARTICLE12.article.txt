# A 						Worthy Cause.

### 
Any project in the nature of a bene
fit for the Stanford Union deserves the

support of the students.
This is the purpose of
the Rani's Head produc
tion tomorrow evening.

The seat sale has not been as heavy as
the shows of the past. "Rambling
Rameses" in an original comic opera
and is well worth seeing. Stanford
has seen two excellent original Junior
Operas in the last two years, setting
a new standard. The Ram's Head
play will rank with these. Let's help
the cause of original drama and at
the same time aid the Stanford Union.
Ram's Head intends to give produc
tions in nearby towns, as the Glee
Club has done, and in this way hopes
to be able to turn over at least two
thousand dollars to the Stanford Union
at the end of the year. Their plan is
to donate enough in the next few years
so that there may be a large room
for smokers and informal entertain
ments, and to entertain for the stu
dents such notables that come to San
Francisco, as the Eastern College so
cieties do.
Get your tickets in the morning.
Let's pack the Assembly Hall tomor
row evening.
