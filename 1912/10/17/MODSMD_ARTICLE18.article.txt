# TRYOUTS IN NOVEMBER FOR DEBATING TEAM
## INTERCOLLEGIATE QUESTION TO BE ARGUED. Both Freshmen and Sophomores Will Enter Many Good Speakers in Tryouts. 
### 
Tuesday, November 19, and Wednes
day, November 20, are the days set
by the IntersoQiety Debating League
for the tryouts of the Freshman-
Sophomore annual debate this year.
These dates were chosen so that tnc
underclass debaters on the first and
second' Varsity debating teams may
have a few days rest between the In
tercollegiate Debate and the tryouts.
Resolved, "That the State of Cali
fornia should establish a series of en
dowed non-partisan presses," the ques
tion to be discussed against Califor
nia the night before the Dig Game, ha&
been decided upon as the topic of dis-
I cussion of the tryouts.
Last year the tryout question was
the Tri-State topic. Although this has
, not as yet been decided upon, it un
doubtedly will he used in the final
clash between the two classes, which
will be held early in February of the
| spring semester.
The judges of the tryouts will be
chosen from the professors of the
University by the members of the In
tersociety League. All of the younger
men who have debating interests are
expected to enter these tryouts, and
j will hand their names to either E. C.
I Smith, '13, or F. I?. Belcher, '13, at an
early date.
The first year men have shown an
unusual interest in debating this year
and should present a very strong team
against the Sophomores. A. 11. Mo
rocco, who will represent the Car
dinal in the Intercollegiate forensic
I contest, J. W. Kaufman, alternate on
j the same team, it. V. Mack, president
| of the Freshman Debating society, and
many other Freshmen of unusual
ability, furnish ample material to se
lect a team which will be hard to
j beat.
The Sophomores, nevertheless, will
be able to present a very able team of
speakers. P. L. Higgins, Intercolle
giate debater, A. E. Worthy, a Tri-
State debater, A. F. Covle, a member
of last year's interclass team, S. S.
Berry, J. I). Adams, and other class
men are expected to enter the tryouts.
