# FRESHMEN MUST LIMIT BONFIRE EXPENDITURE.
## Competition of New Classes Causes Conference to Make Seventy-Five Dollars Maximum Cost. 
### 
That the cost of the Freshman bon
fire this year must not exceed seventy
five dollars is the decision of the com
mittee appointed by the University
conference. The action was brought
about through the extravagance of the
Freshmen in the past.
"This action was necessary to pre
vent competition among the successive
Freshmen classes," said K. L. Schaupp
today. "The object of the bonfire is to
form a light for the parade on the
night of the rally before the Rig Game.
A smaller blaze, lasting only a short
time, will do this as well as one that
lasts all night, and will not necessitate
the Freshmen placing themselves so
heavily in debt."
