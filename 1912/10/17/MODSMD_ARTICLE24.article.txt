# CHAPARRAL WILL APPEAR IN NEW ROLE OF MODESTY
## FEATURE NUMBER HAS MANY LAUGH PROVOKERS. Contributors to Current Issue Have Clever Array of Drawn and Scribbled Wit. 
### 
The Chaparral will appear on the
campus tomorrow in the garb of a
"Modest Number." It has been a long
time since Chappie has essayed the
role of Modesty; as a matter of fact it
is hard to say whether the front-page
pen and ink drawing of soft-eyed fem
ininity by M. A. Oliver, '15, is really
modest, or demure. At any rate its
is fetching.
The outer cover of the magazine
remains unchanged, hut a fresh ap
plication of bright ink makes it as
acceptable as ever.
The art department as a whole con
tains representative work of many of
the most successful pen and ink
drawers on the campus.
Two full-page half-tone comics, one
by M. W. Allen, '15, and the other by
.T. L. Duff, '13, succeed in getting a
laugh over apiece. Clever column
cuts by J. Olson, '15, and other small
comics by M. W. Allen, '15, and J. L.
| Duff, '13, concentrate their humor into
a few well-drawn lines.
The front page poem blends its
story of a lost heart well with the
shadowy eyes of the Modest Maid who
throws her enthralling glance from
the first page.
"The Stinglish Dubs," sub-headod
"A Mis-Deal Husband," a burlesque on
the recent English Club play, by M. T.
Dooling, '11, and L. D. Summerfield,
'12, spreads localized quips over a fast
page and a half.
"Dilettante," written this month by
M. T. Dooling, '11, and a timely essay
on "Modesty" by J. W. Howell, '12,
offer catchy lines.
The issue also includes verse by
Miss P. Willard, '15, and other con
tributions by E. W. Pugh, '11, L. D.
Summerfield, '12. P. F. Levy, '12, J. W.
Howell. '12, W. F. Kilcline, '15, A. M.
Standish, *14, A. T. Cluff, '14, C. F.
Coffin, '13, M. A. Hagen, '15, H. Levy,
'Hi, and H. V. Stewart, '16.
