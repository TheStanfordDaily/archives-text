# "RAMBLING RAMESES" TO HELP PAY FOR UNION
## RAM'S HEAD SOCIETY AGREE TO DONATE PROFITS. Friday Evening's Performance Will Offer a Wealth of Good Music and Comedy. 
### 
From the earnings of "Rambling
Rameses" the Ram's Head Society ex
pects to turn over a goodly amount of
money to the Stanford Union. After
Friday evening's presentation in the
Assembly Hall it is planned to take
the show on the road for a short tour.
The final dress-rehearsal took place
last evening before the combined Aus
tralian and Varsity rugby teams.
In the first act the setting is laid
at the Oasis of Bari Frou Frou. Here
H. R. Spence, '13, is ruling as the
Kurjoph of Bari Frou Frou. Spence
sings the song, "1 am Contended on my
Little Oasis."
Lewis, as A. Fee, appears on the
stage as the guide to a Cook's tourist
party composed of Herr Oil, E. E. Man
ning, '13; Lord Rottlngcastle, N. M.
Halcombe, '09; Colonel R. Alabama,
S. Brown, '13; Jaspar Good of 'Frisco,
M. Luther, '14; and Mrs. Richmond, G.
H. Beurhaus, '13. Lewis' song, "I am
the Guy That Put You Hep to Eu
rope," and"I Wouldn't Mind a Job
Like That" sung by the whole party
are exceptionally good.
Dorothy Richmond, W. B. Forbes,
'15, makes her appearance riding a
camel. Forbes and J. R. Morgan, '16,
open the second act with an oriental
dance.
B. H. Lasky, '12, as a broken-down
tragedian traveling in Egypt in search
of local color for his play, "Anthony
and Cleopatra," makes the most of
some exceptionally clever lines. The
widow is persuaded to finance this
play and to allow her daughter to
take the part of Cleopatra. T. H.
Claussen, '14, plays the part of cupid
in the rehearsal of this piece.
