# LONG LINE LINGERS TO DRAW LUCKY NUMBERS.
## Men and Women Rooters Congregate to Get Choice of Tickets for Big Game. 
### 
Leaving not a soul in the houses on
the Row, not a Frosh to answer the
phone in the Hall, not even a grind in
the Library, the line of men drawing
rooter's numbers for the seat sale oi'
the Hig Game this afternoon was the
longest that ever anxiously awaited
the chance to put a hand in the "grab
hag." And no shorter in nroportion
to their enrollment was the line of
women.
When the first man drew the mystic
number in front of the Law building,
tlie last was standing within a few
feet of him, the liim having circled
back in an irregular fashion. Tt ex
tended from the Law Corner to the
Law Steps, along the arcade to the
English building. Reaching the steps
of the Economics building it doubled
buck on itself, continuing on until it
reached the Memorial Church, where it
turned agp.in, ending where it began
at the Law Corner.
The women's line reached from the
south end of the History building,
where the drawing was held, to the
Library.
