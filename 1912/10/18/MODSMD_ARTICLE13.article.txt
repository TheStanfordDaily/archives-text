# RICCARDO MARTIN SINGS BEFORE LARGE AUDIENCE
## NOTED TENOR PLEASES IN FIRST OF SEASON'S CONCERTS. First Presentation by the Peninsular Musical Association is Marked by Success. 
### 
A capacity house, composed of mu
sicians and music lovers from the ex
tremities of the Peninsula, was held
silent for two hours last night by
Riccardo Martin's delightful voice at
the first concert of the Peninsular Mu
sical Association, in the Assembly
Hall. Martin's voice was sweet and
unstrained and was shown to its best
advantage by a well-selected reper
toire of pleasant Italian, French, and
English songs. As an encore the
tenor pleased with La Donna e Mobile
from I'Paghacci, and was generous
throughout the evening with his re
turns. Miss Lima O'Brien's accom
panying was sympathetic and entirely
suited to the singer's voice. The de
votees of music turned out in numbers
which argue well for the continuance
of the concerts. Schumann Heink and
De Gorgoza were possibilities for the
future and the success of this concert
insures the probability of their ap
pearance.
