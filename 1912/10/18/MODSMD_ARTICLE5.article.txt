### 
Preparations for the Cardinal argu
ment in the Inter-collegiate debate
were given a decided step toward com
pletion by the suggestions made to
members of the Varsity team Wednes
day by Chester H. Rowell, editor of
the "Fresno Republican," who was a
lisitor on the campus.
In a half hour interview granted to
P. D. Nowell, '13, and A. H. Morosco,
I'lo, Rowell declared that the plan to
. establish a series of endowed, non
partisan newspapers in California,
which will be supported by the Uni

practical.
