# "RAMBLING RAMESES" EXCEEDS EXPECTATIONS
## RAM'S HEAD IS CONGRATULATED ON PRODUCTION. Stanford Graduate is Pleased With Student Male Choruses in Feminine Attire. 
### E.W. Smith, '99 
Ram's Head is to be heartily con
gratulated and thanked tor the per
formance of last Friday evening. If
you like that sort of thing, "Rambling
Rameses" is just the sort of thing
you would like. As for me, I confess
that, although 1 do like that sort of
thing pretty well, I entered Assembly
Hall with very considerable misgiv
ings. Against my inclinations and
better judgment, I had promised to
write something about the play for
the Daily Palo Alto, and I was har
assed by the fear that after the play
I should be struggling to make myself
not too disagreeable by talking with
as much enthusiasm as I could com
mand about the best things in it and
sliding lightly over some poorer stuff
that had been written in to glue these
better parts together, and more par
ticularly, I was apprehensive that
there would be some things that would
utterly prevent me from being alto
gether pleasant in my remarks.
Rather a grim frame of mind with
which to face the rising curtain of a
musical comedy! Of course, I know
nov that I did the .young geutiemen
of Ram's Head an injustice by harbor
ing such fears: I shall hope to sit
dovyi at their next play with more
sanguine spirits. Tf the kind of
amusement they essayed is not fairly
well done it would far better not be
done at all; but if it is as well done
as "Rambling Rameses" was it is
thoroughly worth while, T believe,
even in our highly intellectual com
munity.
Classy Choruses.
With the first choruses, the stalwart
"Guardians of the Pyramids" and the
graceful "Daughters of the Nile," my
troubles vanished and when the Prin
cess Zuleika spoke in Mr. Morgan's
very pleasing natural voice I settled
down, with all the others in the audi
ence, to unhampered enjoyment. With
the society managing girls' parts in a
way so pleasing to the eye and ear and
with such fundamental good taste,
there was nothing to disturb the equa
nimity of the most conscientious
critic, even though selected from the
faculty. My task, instead of being
irksome, proved a pleasure. I could
have added another stanza to th*.
song, "I'd Like a Job Like That." As
a matter of fact, I forgot most of the
time that I was a "critic," and just
enjoyed mystlf.
Parts Well Taken.
All the notes pencilled on my pro
gram are commendatory, I find, but in
so brief a column as this (when so
much of the space has already been
taken wilh the preliminary emotions
of the writer!) there is no chance to
mention all the details that deserve a
word of praise. The parts were all so
well taken that to speak individually
of any practically necessitates econi
ums for all. Mr. Morgan, as the Prin
cess, certainly must receive a word
of high praise. His voice was delight
ful, so delightful that there was no
incongruity between its masculine
tones and the feminine costume of the
actor. His dancing also was remark
ably good in its severe Egyptian grace
sion—not the least effective part of
the performance being his facial ex
pression. This, of course, immediately
calls to mind the dance in which the
Princess and the disguised Dorothy
Richmond participated, and compels
at least a word of appreciation for the
work of Mr. W. B. Forbes. And so it
| goes. They were all good. It seems
almost unfair to the others to say that
Mr. husky as the traditional tragedian
and Mr. Lewis as the tourist guide,
| agile in feet and wits, were particular
ly good.
The plot in such a play is, of course,
by no means the chief consideration,
| but in this instance it was strong
I enough and coherent enough fully to
sustain all the incidents of the play.
The music, even if it. was not start
ilingly original, was always pleasant
I and in keeping with the play, and —a
matter of far greater moment than
striking originality—it was not cheap.
We have become so accustomed to
having our own orchestras play like
| professional organizations that we al
most forget to notice their good work.
Staging Excellent.
The costumes and stage pictures
i were without exception excellent,
j The use of make-up was judicious and
successful. The single back-drop,
with its view of the desert, used
throughout the play, was good in it
self and particularly good in that it
I permitted the shortening of the in
termission between the scenes and the
j closing of the performance at an hour
j that is much more convenient for
many of us than the time that has
j brought the final curtain in some of
our dramatic performances. There
j were probably few in the audience
who did not observe the approach of
the finale with regretwhich is some
thing worth considering.
So much for a man who went to
"Rambling Rameses" steeled for a
; pitiless attack if he saw occasion,
1 however unpleasant the undertaking
might be. If "Rameses" wanders off
the campus to bring back a few build
ing stones for the Union, the advance
agent will be perfectly justified in
| assuring our neighbors that if they
I are at all inclined towards "college
j boys' nonsense" they will be given an
levelling of wholesome fun.

Ram's Head is to be heartily con
gratulated and thanked tor the per
formance of last Friday evening. If
you like that sort of thing, "Rambling
Rameses" is just the sort of thing
you would like. As for me, I confess
that, although 1 do like that sort of
thing pretty well, I entered Assembly
Hall with very considerable misgiv
ings. Against my inclinations and
better judgment, I had promised to
write something about the play for
the Daily Palo Alto, and I was har
assed by the fear that after the play
I should be struggling to make myself
not too disagreeable by talking with
as much enthusiasm as I could com
mand about the best things in it and
sliding lightly over some poorer stuff
that had been written in to glue these
better parts together, and more par
ticularly, I was apprehensive that
there would be some things that would
utterly prevent me from being alto
gether pleasant in my remarks.
Rather a grim frame of mind with
which to face the rising curtain of a
musical comedy! Of course, I know
nov that I did the .young geutiemen
of Ram's Head an injustice by harbor
ing such fears: I shall hope to sit
dovyi at their next play with more
sanguine spirits. Tf the kind of
amusement they essayed is not fairly
well done it would far better not be
done at all; but if it is as well done
as "Rambling Rameses" was it is
thoroughly worth while, T believe,
even in our highly intellectual com
munity.
Classy Choruses.
With the first choruses, the stalwart
"Guardians of the Pyramids" and the
graceful "Daughters of the Nile," my
troubles vanished and when the Prin
cess Zuleika spoke in Mr. Morgan's
very pleasing natural voice I settled
down, with all the others in the audi
ence, to unhampered enjoyment. With
the society managing girls' parts in a
way so pleasing to the eye and ear and
with such fundamental good taste,
there was nothing to disturb the equa
nimity of the most conscientious
critic, even though selected from the
faculty. My task, instead of being
irksome, proved a pleasure. I could
have added another stanza to th*.
song, "I'd Like a Job Like That." As
a matter of fact, I forgot most of the
time that I was a "critic," and just
enjoyed mystlf.
Parts Well Taken.
All the notes pencilled on my pro
gram are commendatory, I find, but in
so brief a column as this (when so
much of the space has already been
taken wilh the preliminary emotions
of the writer!) there is no chance to
mention all the details that deserve a
word of praise. The parts were all so
well taken that to speak individually
of any practically necessitates econi
ums for all. Mr. Morgan, as the Prin
cess, certainly must receive a word
of high praise. His voice was delight
ful, so delightful that there was no
incongruity between its masculine
tones and the feminine costume of the
actor. His dancing also was remark
ably good in its severe Egyptian grace
sion—not the least effective part of
the performance being his facial ex
pression. This, of course, immediately
calls to mind the dance in which the
Princess and the disguised Dorothy
Richmond participated, and compels
at least a word of appreciation for the
work of Mr. W. B. Forbes. And so it
| goes. They were all good. It seems
almost unfair to the others to say that
Mr. husky as the traditional tragedian
and Mr. Lewis as the tourist guide,
| agile in feet and wits, were particular
ly good.
The plot in such a play is, of course,
by no means the chief consideration,
| but in this instance it was strong
I enough and coherent enough fully to
sustain all the incidents of the play.
The music, even if it. was not start
ilingly original, was always pleasant
I and in keeping with the play, and —a
matter of far greater moment than
striking originality—it was not cheap.
We have become so accustomed to
having our own orchestras play like
| professional organizations that we al
most forget to notice their good work.
Staging Excellent.
The costumes and stage pictures
i were without exception excellent,
j The use of make-up was judicious and
successful. The single back-drop,
with its view of the desert, used
throughout the play, was good in it
self and particularly good in that it
I permitted the shortening of the in
termission between the scenes and the
j closing of the performance at an hour
j that is much more convenient for
many of us than the time that has
j brought the final curtain in some of
our dramatic performances. There
j were probably few in the audience
who did not observe the approach of
the finale with regretwhich is some
thing worth considering.
So much for a man who went to
"Rambling Rameses" steeled for a
; pitiless attack if he saw occasion,
1 however unpleasant the undertaking
might be. If "Rameses" wanders off
the campus to bring back a few build
ing stones for the Union, the advance
agent will be perfectly justified in
| assuring our neighbors that if they
I are at all inclined towards "college
j boys' nonsense" they will be given an
levelling of wholesome fun.

you like that sort of thing, "Rambling
Rameses" is just the sort of thing
you would like. As for me, I confess
that, although 1 do like that sort of
thing pretty well, I entered Assembly
Hall with very considerable misgiv
ings. Against my inclinations and
better judgment, I had promised to
write something about the play for
the Daily Palo Alto, and I was har
assed by the fear that after the play
I should be struggling to make myself
not too disagreeable by talking with
as much enthusiasm as I could com
mand about the best things in it and
sliding lightly over some poorer stuff
that had been written in to glue these
better parts together, and more par
ticularly, I was apprehensive that
there would be some things that would
utterly prevent me from being alto
gether pleasant in my remarks.
Rather a grim frame of mind with
which to face the rising curtain of a
musical comedy! Of course, I know
nov that I did the .young geutiemen
of Ram's Head an injustice by harbor
ing such fears: I shall hope to sit
dovyi at their next play with more
sanguine spirits. Tf the kind of
amusement they essayed is not fairly
well done it would far better not be
done at all; but if it is as well done
as "Rambling Rameses" was it is
thoroughly worth while, T believe,
even in our highly intellectual com
munity.
Classy Choruses.
With the first choruses, the stalwart
"Guardians of the Pyramids" and the
graceful "Daughters of the Nile," my
troubles vanished and when the Prin
cess Zuleika spoke in Mr. Morgan's
very pleasing natural voice I settled
down, with all the others in the audi
ence, to unhampered enjoyment. With
the society managing girls' parts in a
way so pleasing to the eye and ear and
with such fundamental good taste,
there was nothing to disturb the equa
nimity of the most conscientious
critic, even though selected from the
faculty. My task, instead of being
irksome, proved a pleasure. I could
have added another stanza to th*.
song, "I'd Like a Job Like That." As
a matter of fact, I forgot most of the
time that I was a "critic," and just
enjoyed mystlf.
Parts Well Taken.
All the notes pencilled on my pro
gram are commendatory, I find, but in
so brief a column as this (when so
much of the space has already been
taken wilh the preliminary emotions
of the writer!) there is no chance to
mention all the details that deserve a
word of praise. The parts were all so
well taken that to speak individually
of any practically necessitates econi
ums for all. Mr. Morgan, as the Prin
cess, certainly must receive a word
of high praise. His voice was delight
ful, so delightful that there was no
incongruity between its masculine
tones and the feminine costume of the
actor. His dancing also was remark
ably good in its severe Egyptian grace
sion—not the least effective part of
the performance being his facial ex
pression. This, of course, immediately
calls to mind the dance in which the
Princess and the disguised Dorothy
Richmond participated, and compels
at least a word of appreciation for the
work of Mr. W. B. Forbes. And so it
| goes. They were all good. It seems
almost unfair to the others to say that
Mr. husky as the traditional tragedian
and Mr. Lewis as the tourist guide,
| agile in feet and wits, were particular
ly good.
The plot in such a play is, of course,
by no means the chief consideration,
| but in this instance it was strong
I enough and coherent enough fully to
sustain all the incidents of the play.
The music, even if it. was not start
ilingly original, was always pleasant
I and in keeping with the play, and —a
matter of far greater moment than
striking originality—it was not cheap.
We have become so accustomed to
having our own orchestras play like
| professional organizations that we al
most forget to notice their good work.
Staging Excellent.
The costumes and stage pictures
i were without exception excellent,
j The use of make-up was judicious and
successful. The single back-drop,
with its view of the desert, used
throughout the play, was good in it
self and particularly good in that it
I permitted the shortening of the in
termission between the scenes and the
j closing of the performance at an hour
j that is much more convenient for
many of us than the time that has
j brought the final curtain in some of
our dramatic performances. There
j were probably few in the audience
who did not observe the approach of
the finale with regretwhich is some
thing worth considering.
So much for a man who went to
"Rambling Rameses" steeled for a
; pitiless attack if he saw occasion,
1 however unpleasant the undertaking
might be. If "Rameses" wanders off
the campus to bring back a few build
ing stones for the Union, the advance
agent will be perfectly justified in
| assuring our neighbors that if they
I are at all inclined towards "college
j boys' nonsense" they will be given an
levelling of wholesome fun.
