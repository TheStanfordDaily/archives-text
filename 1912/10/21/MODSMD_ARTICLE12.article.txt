# MOVING PICTURES ARE A STANFORD PRODUCT
## EXPERIMENTS MADE ON FARM IN EARLY DAYS. Result of the Deciding of Bet Between Leland Stanford and a Friend. 
### 
The original experiments which
finally resulted in the moving-picture
machine took place upon the Stanford
Farm. Leland Stanford, then Gover
nor of California, was indirectly re
sponsible for the discovery.
An account from the London "Tit
Bits" magazine, procured through the
courtesy of C. G. Lathrop, is given be
low. The incident described, which
occurred on the site of the present
Stock Farm in the early sixties, is
well remembered by Mr. Lathrop.
"Considerable discussion has been
going on for some time past as to who
originated the cinema. Many claim
ants to the distinction have come for
ward, but after careful investigation it
would appear that the honor really be
longs to an Englishman, Edward Muy
bridge, who settled in California in
1840, when he obtained an appointment
as photographic surveyor of tbj? Pa
cific Coast.
"The first moving picture which he
produced was the outcome of a wager
between the Governor of California,
Leland Stanford, and a friend as to
whether a horse ever had four legs off
the ground while running. Muybridge
was asked to settle the point. He
placed twenty-four cameras to cover
each movement of the horse, the
camera-shutters being moved by con
nect ing-pieces of string which the ani
mal broke as he passed. The result
was a series of pictures showing each
movement of the horse, and proved
that, except when .lumping, all four
legs of the animal never left the
ground at once.
"This experiment caused Muybridge
to think what an interesting thing it
would be to present the photos in
motion. To do this he copied the
method made familar to many in the
zoetrope. This toy was a pasteboard
cylinder, with slits in the upper sec
tion, and when it revolved rapidly it
reproduced drawings apparently in
motion.
"To reproduce the effect upon a
screen, using photographs, was a me
chanical feat finally conquered. Muy
bridge was able to show all the move
ments of the horse without a back
ground. He died in 1904. but the
original photographs and much of the
apparatus used in the experiment are
still in the hands of friends in Eng
land."
