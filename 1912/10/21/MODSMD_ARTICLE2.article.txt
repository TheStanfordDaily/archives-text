# FIVE HUNDRED MILES APART
## STANFORD WINS AND LOSES 
### 
In a match which inspired southern
correspondents of local journals to
soar high on wings of rhetoric, Stan
ford defeated Southern California on
Bovard Field, Saturday afternoon.
14-0 the score-board read. The Car-
I
dinal ruggers were prevented from
working into their speediest stride by
the shortness of the halves —30
minutes was their length—and the
frequency with which the time-out
whistle shrilled. This, coupled with
the stubborn defence of the southern
players, a defence which won admira
tion from spectators, enabled the self
styled "Trojans" to hold the score to
very moderate dimensions.
Southerners Outplayed.
The Stanford fifteen outplayed the
Methodists on every point which de
| pended on "inside" knowledge of
rugby. This was to be expected from
the longer experience at the game of
| the Stanford men. The Varsity also
j out-ran out-passed, and out-generalled
the southern men, but found difficulty
in getting past them when bound goal
j ward.
The contest developed no individual
| stars, or sensational plays of note.
| Taken by and large, it was a fair game
j which delighted the crowds in the
; Bovard Field bleachers.
Six of Stanford's fourteen points
were secured by means of field goals,
j Bennie Erb seized upon the scoring
possibilities of two free kicks. The
remaining points cune as the result
lot' line passing rallies, and were set
down to the credit of Reeves and Illy
| respectively.
Every player in the Stanford party
which journeyed to Los Angeles was
-viven a chance on the field. During
11 lie game Darsie and Thoburn replaced
Frank and Card at breakaways, Peck
went in for Sanborn, Art Erb took
I Cass's place, and Kern went in at cen
ter for Risling, Andrews taking the
| second five berth.
First Half.
Secor kicked off for the Southerners
and on his short boot, which was
I vigorously followed up by the Trojan
forwards, the Stanford scrum men
dribbled and rucked the sphere to the
Methodist 20. From this mark Secor's
long touch boot sent the play once
more into Stanford territory.
After fifteen minutes, in which the
Cardinal forwards had the better of
the argument but found their efforts
continually frustrated by touch-get
ting defensive boots,the backs took the
j ball close to the Methodist line. The
j IT. S. C. forwards forced the play back
to the 25 mark. Here, on a penalty,
Erb was given the ball for a free-kick,
and his boot over the bar chalked up
three points for Stanford.
The first Cardinal try came as the
result of a pretty piece of backfield
work. Shortly after Secor had been
forced to save, the Stanford forwards
oprried the ball to the Southerners'
"0. Here Kern took Erb's free kick
on the run, and the ball travelled from
him to Risling, thence to Reeves, who
, planted it nearly behind the posts for

the try. Erb failed to convert. Score,
Stanford 6, U. S. C. 0.
Second Half.
For the first ten minutes of this
period the Methodists proved some
thing of a thorn in the sides of their
Cardinal opponents. When the Stan
ford backs got going a series of pass
ing rushes took the hall to the Metho
dist 20. Here a free-kick gave Erb
the opportunity to duplicate his pre
vious scoring performance. He ac
cepted the opportunity.
The passing rally leading to the
I final Stanford try opened the eyes of
| the southern enthusiasts as to the
possibilities of this splendid play.
Meadows, the Southern wing, had got
ten away and sprinted to midfield.
Here Thoburn intercepted his pass and
was off in a burst of speed. Reeves
and Bly handled the ball in turn and
I the latter put it down between the
posts. Erb converted.
Second Team Loses.
With a well earned victory and a
hard fought defeat to the day's credit,
i the second and third ruggers returned
Saturday afternoon from their inva
sion of the neighboring country. The
!Cond Varsity went do.vn to defeat
before the onslaught of the fifteen
from Santa Clara University, the score
being 5-3. The third team that repre
sented the Cardinal was more success
ful, coming home with the better end
of a 5-3 score.
The game on Santa Clara field was
j a fiercely fought contest, the close
j score well describing the play. Cap
tain King, '12, is credited with the
' first points of the day. booting the
j ball squarely between the uprights
when the Cardinal was awarded a free
kick in Mission territory. The ball
was quickly sent into Stanford ground
when the Santa Clarans came back
with a rush, and the battle waged for
the remainder of the half within the
Cardinal danger zone.
Shipsey, the Santa Clara second
five, opened the second half with a
| sensational run for twenty-five yards,
i Brown was the saving factor for Stan-<
| ford, getting away with a long boot
ito touch. Clark replaced Decius in
i front rank at this stage of the game.
Substitutions in the Santa Clara
lineup seemed to give the Mission
players new life, and after a five-yard
scrum Momson went across the line
for a try. Ybarrando converted the
easy goal. The remaining minutes of
play did not change the score.
Third Varsity Wins.
Fifty-five minutes of play were
barely enough for the third team to
get atw r o point advantage over the
fifteen representing the College of the
Pacific. The Methodists started well,
scoring from a one-yard scrum in the
first ten minutes of plav. The anc;lp
was a difficult one and Faulkner failed
to locate the posts.
The score remaiend 3-0 until the
middle of the second half, when
Wynne started a scoring play by
j dribbling at center. Cookson followed
j tip and in the short passing rushes of
the backs from the 25, went across the
line for a try. Clark converted and
the score was 5-3.
The dirt field at College Park, as in
the game at Santa Clara, proved a
handicap to the Cardinal players. The
I grounds were not well packed and as
a result the work of the hacks suffered
I in a number of instances.
