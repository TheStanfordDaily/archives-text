We are glad to add our modicum of
praise to that of our critic for the

Ram's Head production
of "Rambling Rameses."
They have set a stan-

dard for original comic operas that
may well be followed by Junior Opera
Committees of the future. Friday
evening's show was a distinct contri
bution to original dramatics at Stan
ford. Future productions by Ram's
Head will be looked forward to by
the University theatre-going public.
The fact that their opera was in the
nature of a benefit for the Stanford
Union, the organization deserves much
credit. The Union project, to be a
success, needs such support.
