Weakened by the absence of their
leader, Terry's nine met defeat at the
hands of Workman's team Saturday
morning in the Fall baseball series.
The score was 2 to 1 and every one
of the seven innings was full of Rood
baseball. A double by McCloskey and
an error allowed the victors to gather
in their two runs in the first frame.
A home run by McNeely was the only
score made by the losers.
Following are the figures:
R. H. E.
Team No. 1 2 9 0
Team No. 2 1 7 2
Batteries â€” Anderson and Dent;
Maple and Wickersham and Hunley.
The schedule of the Fall League for
this week follows:
Tuesday, Team 2 and 3; Thursday,
Teams 1 and 3; Friday, Teams 2 and
3; Saturday, Teams 1 and 2.
