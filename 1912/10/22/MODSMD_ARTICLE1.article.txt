# THE 						DAILY PALO ALTO COVERS THE CONTINENT
## FORTY THOUSAND PEOPLE READ THIS PAPER. Stanford Publication Received in 18 States, 74 High Schools and 12 Colleges. 
### 
In answer to numerous inquiries as
to the circulation of the Daily Palo
Alto it is interesting to know that the
Stanford daily publication is read
from the Pacific to the Atlantic and
from Alaska to the southernmost ex
tremities of California. Eleven hun
dred papers are printed daily, with a
circulation of 150 on the campus, 250
in Palo Alto, 225 mailed to different
parts of the country, and 150 to high
schools along the Pacific Coast.
Two papers are sent to each of
seventy-four preparatory schools in
California, Oregon, and Washington.
This is perhaps the most valuable cir
culation from a LTniversity standpoint,
because it gives the prospective col
lege students an insight of what
Stanford is doing. It is estimated at
a conservative number that the high
schools, taken as a whole, average
three hundred and fifty pupils. This
means that 25,900 students are able to
read the Daily Palo Alto outside of
our own immediate territory on the
Peninsula.
Eighteen states throughout the
Union receive the Cardinal daily five
days a week. This list includes Cali
fornia, Oregon, Washington, New
York, Illinois, Montana, Connecticut,
Washington, D. C., Pennsylvania,
Idaho, Kansas, Nevada, Massachu
setts, Missouri, Michigan, Indiana,
Wisconsin, and Arizona. Besides this
the Daily has subscribers in Hawaii,
Canada, Alaska, and Vancouver, B. C.
Eagerly Read in East.
The Stanford daily publication is
received by eighteen colleges and uni
versities in the States and Canada,
where it may be found on the tables
of the reading rooms of some of the
foremost educational centers. Thou
sands of college men who are in
terested .in the institutions of the
Far West make a daily practice of
glancing through the columns of the
Daily Palo Alto. At the University
of California alone, three thousand
people read it the same as Stanford
students read the Daily Californian.
Besides reaching a great part of
the students in the country, many
alumni and the public at large
are given a chance of seeing the
paper. Files are kept in the Califor
nia State Library at Sacramento, in
several college libraries on the coast
and in the Library of Congress where
thousands of tourists have access to
the files of the Federal reading room.
Tlie University Club of San Francisco
is an example of an alumni cluT)
where many drop in during the day
and pick up the paper to see what is
happening down on the farm.
In summing up the circulation to
tlio 132 towns and cities to which the
Daily Palo Alto is sent, in setting
forth a conservative estimate, ap
proximately 100,000 people are given
a chance of reading the Stanford
publication daily and it is almost a
certain fact that between thirty and
fiftv thousand are regular readers.

schools, taken as a whole, average
three hundred and fifty pupils. This
means that 25,900 students are able to
read the Daily Palo Alto outside of
our own immediate territory on the
Peninsula.
Eighteen states throughout the
Union receive the Cardinal daily five
days a week. This list includes Cali
fornia, Oregon, Washington, New
York, Illinois, Montana, Connecticut,
Washington, D. C., Pennsylvania,
Idaho, Kansas, Nevada, Massachu
setts, Missouri, Michigan, Indiana,
Wisconsin, and Arizona. Besides this

Eagerly Read in East.
The Stanford daily publication is
received by eighteen colleges and uni
versities in the States and Canada,
where it may be found on the tables
of the reading rooms of some of the
foremost educational centers. Thou
sands of college men who are in
terested .in the institutions of the
Far West make a daily practice of
glancing through the columns of the
Daily Palo Alto. At the University
of California alone, three thousand
people read it the same as Stanford
students read the Daily Californian.
Besides reaching a great part of
the students in the country, many
alumni and the public at large
are given a chance of seeing the
paper. Files are kept in the Califor
nia State Library at Sacramento, in
several college libraries on the coast
and in the Library of Congress where
thousands of tourists have access to
the files of the Federal reading room.
Tlie University Club of San Francisco
is an example of an alumni cluT)
where many drop in during the day
and pick up the paper to see what is
happening down on the farm.
In summing up the circulation to
tlio 132 towns and cities to which the
Daily Palo Alto is sent, in setting
forth a conservative estimate, ap
proximately 100,000 people are given
a chance of reading the Stanford
publication daily and it is almost a
certain fact that between thirty and
fiftv thousand are regular readers.
In answer to numerous inquiries as
to the circulation of the Daily Palo
Alto it is interesting to know that the
Stanford daily publication is read
from the Pacific to the Atlantic and
from Alaska to the southernmost ex
tremities of California. Eleven hun
dred papers are printed daily, with a
circulation of 150 on the campus, 250
in Palo Alto, 225 mailed to different
parts of the country, and 150 to high
schools along the Pacific Coast.
Two papers are sent to each of
seventy-four preparatory schools in
California, Oregon, and Washington.
This is perhaps the most valuable cir
culation from a LTniversity standpoint,
because it gives the prospective col
lege students an insight of what
Stanford is doing. It is estimated at
a conservative number that the high
schools, taken as a whole, average
three hundred and fifty pupils. This
means that 25,900 students are able to
read the Daily Palo Alto outside of
our own immediate territory on the
Peninsula.
