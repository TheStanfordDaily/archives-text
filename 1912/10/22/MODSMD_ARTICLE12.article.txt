The men of the University can com
pete in six intercollegiate sports dur
ing the college year. Four of these

are the so-called major
sports and the other two
minor. Besides this, there
is the annual golf tourney

between Stanford and California. The
women of this University compose one
third of the Student Body but they can
only compete in one intercollegiate
sport, that of tennis. There seems to
be little reason for this impartiality.
No place in this country has a fairer
climate than Stanford. Let's make the
most of it and do everything in our
power to encourage a more general
participation in athletics for every
one in the University. We suggest
that Women's Basketball be placed
upon the same intercollegiate basis
as Women's Tennis.
