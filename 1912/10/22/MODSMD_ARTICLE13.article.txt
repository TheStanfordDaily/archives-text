In another column we print a story
of the circulation of this publication.
ft is well worth the

reading. To many
The Daily Palo Alto

seems to be a paper of
interest merely to those within the
confines of the University. This
article shows the Daily has wide cir
culation and that a considerable per
centage of these readers may be fu
ture students at Stanford. This was
one of the arguments that was pre
sented to us for changing the name of
this publication and putting Stanford
into the title.
