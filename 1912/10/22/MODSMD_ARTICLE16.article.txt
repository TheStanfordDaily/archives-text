# DR. JORDAN CONTRIBUTES NEW BOOK ON WAR EVILS.
## "The Unseen Empire'' is Title of the Latest Treatise Advocating Peace. 
### 
"It is a dull week when Professor
David Starr Jordan has no new book
announced," is the comment of the
News Tribune of Detroit, Michigan, in
speaking of one of the books which
the Stanford President has but re
cently contributed to the literary
world.
"The Unseen Empire," of which
Doctor Jordan has many times told the
Stanford students, is the title of one
of his latest books, published by the
American Unitarian Association of
Boston.
In this treatise on "The Eugenics of
War," he has told, in part, the story
of the bondage of nations, due to the
cost of war and war preparations.
The absolute need of nations to be
financed is made obvious.
A detailed history of the Rothschild
houses, from the time of the naming
of the pawnshop, the sign of which
was a red shield, to the present day,
is given.
The book contains an exhibit of the
war expenses of nations, and of the
billion and one-half dollars that are
annually paid to the resources of this
Empire of Finance, the Unseen Em
pire of Bondholders.
An interesting likeness of modern to
ancient warfare is shown. The ancient
kings, all. had to borrow funds to
carry on their expeditions, and as the
war grew on, the credit of the war
faring nations decreased until the
wars were stopped of necessity, and
the same would hold true now, if the
"Unseen Empire" would refuse credit.
The title page of President Jordan's
book seems justified in the Bulgarian
proverb, "God is not sinless, he
created borrowers."
