# PROFESSOR FAIRCLOUGH LECTURES ON OLD ROME
## LARGE AUDIENCE HEARS TALK ON ANCIENT CITY. Beautiful Roman Portico System Suggested for San Francisco's "Civic Center." 
### 
"Rome, the City Beautiful," was the
subject of an illustrated lecture given
under the auspices of the Cosmopoli
tan Club by Professor H. R. Fair
clough of the Latin Department last
evening. A large audience was on
hand in the Chapel to hear the lec
ture.
Professor Fairclough traced rapidly
the development of the great city of
Rome from the days when there were
on the seven hills and in the adjacent
valleys only rude primitive settle
ments. He showed how, with the de
velopment of Rome's imperial power,
he>' great statesmen were full of the
idea that Rome itself, as a beautiful
city, should reflect this imperial posi
tion which she occupied as "Queen of
Cities." Julius Caesar, in particular,
began a definite plan, not only of en
larging the public squares, such as the
Forum, but of building in harmonious
fashion public structures, including
temples, basilicas, theatres, triumphal
arches and extensive porticoes.
This plan worked out by Caesar was
continued and developed by his suc
cessors. Ultimately the expanded
Forum, the long columned porticoes
connecting it with the stately build
ings on the Capitol, Palatine, and other
hills of Rome made a wonderful aggre
gation such as has never been
paralleled in the world's history.
Professor Fairclough made the
suggestion that, in its civic center
plans, San Francisco should build a
continuous portico from the City Hall
to the foot of Market street, thus
emulating the portico system which in
the fourth century extended from
Constantine's churches of St. Peter
and St. Paul to the heart of the city.

Many unique slides of reproductions
of the ancient wonders were shown,
together with a number of remarkable
views of the modern city.
