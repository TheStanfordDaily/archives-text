# Election Day to be Campus Holiday.
## 
### 
Tuesday, November 5, Presidential
Election Day, will be a University
holiday at Stanford. The Faculty
Committee on Public Exercises will
announce this break in the routine of
college work within a few days, as
the holiday is not on the University
calendar.
As the November polls will offer the
first opportunity for the recently en
franchised women students to partici
pate in a national election, a general
exodus to those homes within a day's
journey is predicted.
