### 
"Three straight" is the slogan of thb
Santa Clara fifteen which will meet
the Cardinal Varsity on the rugby
field tomorrow. With a victory over
the Freshmen, and the close game on
Saturday with the second Varsity to
their credit, the Mission players come
to meet Stanford determined to show
the strongest lineup a hard fight. And
they will not be disappointed in the
opposing fifteen, for the coaching com
mittee has picked a strong team for
tomorrow's game.
Wednesday is a holiday at the
Catholic University, and a large num
ber of Santa Clara supporters.are ex
pected to accompany the team to Stan
ford Field. Coach Higgins has an
nounced that the fifteen will repre
sent the college at its full strength.
Varsity lineup:
With Sanborn, Sinclair, and Decius
in the front rank, Smith and Part
ridge as middle rankers, and with the
fast pair of breakaways, Card and
Frank, playing on either side of
Schaupp at lock, the Cardinal scrum
will be a formation hard to equal. A.
Erb will take the ball as it is snapped
back by the forwards, and will be sup
ported by Harrigan and Andrews at
fives; Kern in the center position,
Reeves and Noble as wings, and R.
Brown at full.
Substitutes and second team players
will be sent into the game at frequent
intervals and the entire lineup may be
changed before the final whistle. Two
games with San Francisco club teams
will round out the season for many
players on the squad, and tomorrow's
contest means another opportunity to
star on the Stanford turf.
