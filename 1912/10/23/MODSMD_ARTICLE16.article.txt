# FOOTBALL TICKET SALE WILL FILL BLEACHERS.
## 
### 
One thousand numbers were drawn
at the student and faculty sale for the
Big Game at the Bookstore this after
noon. This makes it certain that the
Stanford side of the bleachers on Nov
ember ninth will be filled with Car
dinal partisans.
A long line of students, both men
and women, and members of the facul
ty, formed an hour before the numbers
were to be drawn, striving to get the
best tickets obtainable for themselves
land their friends.
The holder of each number, who had
paid his student body dues or who is
a member of the faculty, was allowed
to purchase four tickets. The sale is
jextremely heavy and it is doubtful if
jthere will be any seats remaining to
! morrow.
