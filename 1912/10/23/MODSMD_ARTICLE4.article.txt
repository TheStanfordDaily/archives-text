# SANTA CLARA TAKES MATCH FROM THE CARDINAL VARSITY
## Catholic Collegians Play Snappy Rugby, While Stanford Shows Slump. Final Score is 15-10. 
### 
Defeat was the portion meted out to
the Stanford Varsity this afternoon on
its own field, in a game for which
! such an outcome had been least antici
-1 pated. Not until the last few moments
, of play did the Cardinal fifteen strike
j its gait, and listlessness marked much
lof the game up to that point. At this
time the gray-jerseyed players warm
ed u pand the hot finish kept the
bleacherites continually on their feet.
It was too late, however, to regain the
lost ground, and in order to hold her
advantage Santa Clara adopted tactics
calculated to delay the game. Best's
score put another damper on the hopes
of the rooters.
Santa Clara has a fast, fighting team,
and this fact, coupled with a Varsity
slump, accounts for the score. It was
a mixed team, composed partly of sec
ond fifteen players, which Coach Pres
ley sent on the field.
Louis C'ass' field goal from play in
the last minute was a beautiful piece
of work. All of Stanford's points were
made by kicks, Cass being credited
with two and Brown with one.

Fred Wat
kins, 14, the
giant Cardinal
forward, made
his initial ap
| pearance of
j the season in
! this after
; noon's game.
The Watkins-
Partridge com
j bine form a
middle rank
i buttress that
is hard to beat.
They are both
over six feet

in height.
The Catholic players should be given
full credit for their splendid play.
Coach Pat Higgins of the Santa Clara
stated that this was by far the best
game his team has played.
Ray Brown at full demonstrated that
rugby genius was in the family; also
that Stanford has no lack of stellar
fullbacks. His long boots were often
in evidence. After he entered the
game Kern was in the play every min
ute, and several other players might
be singled out for their excellent work.
Two Santa Clara tries in the first
half, both converted, and both the
result, of legitimate, hard, rugby,
brought scant comfort to the Cardinal
rooters. The period was lacking in
feature plays. The Varsity showed
no great merit in heeling out the ball,
nor did it. uncork any noteworthy
passing rushes. A few incipient ones
< were nipped in the bud pit her by bung
| gles or the stiff, spoiling defence of the
I visitors. On one occasion Urban and
I Harrigan figured in a fast passing
rally near the Catholic goal, which
should have scored, but failed to ma
terialize.
Flood's try for Santa Clara was the
outcome of a fine piece of rugby. This

Catholic wing is a hard, speedy player.
Ybarrando, the last Santa Clara cap
lain, was responsible for the second
score.
A fair crowd for a Wednesday game
was in evidence in the bleachers. Its
lack of enthusiasm was in evidence
during the first few moments of play,
but later the pleas of the yell leaders,
and llie increased interest in the game
gave rise to lusty cheers.
First Hall.
Ybarrando kicked off for Santa
Clara. The ball was twice booted to
the touch line and a scrum was called
at 25. The play centered about mid
field. Santa Clara was awarded a free
kick and the ball went to touch at 15.
On a free kick for the Cardinal, Brown
found touch near center. The Mission
pack showed a burst of speed, and
play surged dangerously into Cardinal
ground.
From a passing rush Flood secured
the ball and went over the Stanford
line for the first score. Ybarrando
converted. Score, sto 0.
The Varsity came back with a rush
and for several minutes the pack
zigzagged across the midfield line.
Harrigan gained 10 yards by a pretty
kick to touch. Neither scrum was
able to heel the ball out cleanly, and
the resulting play was ragged and zig- ,
zagging.
The second try for Santa Clara was i
registered a few seconds before half
time, when Ybarrando carried the ball !
directly under the crossbar. The .
Mission first five easily converted, and i
the score stood 10-0. The ball was at ;
Stanford's 10 at half time.
Second Half.
Brown kicked off and the Cardinal '
fifteen followed the ball down with a
rush. Play swept from the 10, to 30,
to 10, but the Mission defense was
strong. A passing rush carried the
ball almost over the line, and here
Ybarrando was penalized for holding
the ball in the scrum. Brown sent
the pigskin squarely between the up
rights and the Cardinal was credited
with three points. Cass replaced A.
Erb, while Kern took Andrew's place
at center. The Catholic college fifteen
were again given a free kick, and dur
ing the next three minutes the ball did
not leave Cardinal territory. Smith
replaced Watkins. Rushes by the
backs and good work by the forwards
turned the tables on the Santa
Clarans, and play reached their 10.
Stanford was given a free kick and
Cass added three points to the Car
dinal total by a field goal. Santa Clara
retaliated by sending Best over for
another try, the wing scoring from
a passing rush. Ybarrando converted,
and the score was 15-6. Three
minutes later Cass startled the
bleachers by kiekinc; a goal from play,!
and the Cardinal side of the score- ;
board showed 10. The last minute of
play did not change the figures, the

ball going to touch at Stanford's 15 at
the crack of the gun.

score put another damper on the hopes

Santa Clara has a fast, fighting team,
and this fact, coupled with a Varsity
slump, accounts for the score. It was
a mixed team, composed partly of sec
ond fifteen players, which Coach Pres
ley sent on the field.
Louis C'ass' field goal from play in
the last minute was a beautiful piece
of work. All of Stanford's points were
made by kicks, Cass being credited
with two and Brown with one.

Coach Pat Higgins of the Santa Clara
stated that this was by far the best

rugby genius was in the family; also
that Stanford has no lack of stellar
fullbacks. His long boots were often

be singled out for their excellent work.
Two Santa Clara tries in the first
half, both converted, and both the
result, of legitimate, hard, rugby,
brought scant comfort to the Cardinal
rooters. The period was lacking in
feature plays. The Varsity showed
no great merit in heeling out the ball,

passing rushes. A few incipient ones

should have scored, but failed to ma

outcome of a fine piece of rugby. This

Catholic wing is a hard, speedy player.
Ybarrando, the last Santa Clara cap

First Hall.
Ybarrando kicked off for Santa
Clara. The ball was twice booted to
the touch line and a scrum was called
at 25. The play centered about mid

pack showed a burst of speed, and
play surged dangerously into Cardinal
ground.
From a passing rush Flood secured
the ball and went over the Stanford
line for the first score. Ybarrando
converted. Score, sto 0.
The Varsity came back with a rush
and for several minutes the pack
zigzagged across the midfield line.
Harrigan gained 10 yards by a pretty
kick to touch. Neither scrum was
able to heel the ball out cleanly, and
the resulting play was ragged and zig- ,
zagging.
The second try for Santa Clara was i
registered a few seconds before half
time, when Ybarrando carried the ball !
directly under the crossbar. The .
Mission first five easily converted, and i
the score stood 10-0. The ball was at ;
Stanford's 10 at half time.
Second Half.
Brown kicked off and the Cardinal '
fifteen followed the ball down with a
rush. Play swept from the 10, to 30,
to 10, but the Mission defense was
strong. A passing rush carried the
ball almost over the line, and here
Ybarrando was penalized for holding
the ball in the scrum. Brown sent
the pigskin squarely between the up
rights and the Cardinal was credited
with three points. Cass replaced A.
Erb, while Kern took Andrew's place
at center. The Catholic college fifteen
were again given a free kick, and dur
ing the next three minutes the ball did
not leave Cardinal territory. Smith
replaced Watkins. Rushes by the
backs and good work by the forwards
turned the tables on the Santa
Clarans, and play reached their 10.
Stanford was given a free kick and
Cass added three points to the Car
dinal total by a field goal. Santa Clara
retaliated by sending Best over for
another try, the wing scoring from
a passing rush. Ybarrando converted,
and the score was 15-6. Three
minutes later Cass startled the
bleachers by kiekinc; a goal from play,!
and the Cardinal side of the score- ;
board showed 10. The last minute of
play did not change the figures, the

ball going to touch at Stanford's 15 at
the crack of the gun.

The Catholic players should be given

Coach Pat Higgins of the Santa Clara
stated that this was by far the best
game his team has played.
Ray Brown at full demonstrated that
rugby genius was in the family; also
that Stanford has no lack of stellar
fullbacks. His long boots were often
in evidence. After he entered the
game Kern was in the play every min

be singled out for their excellent work.
Two Santa Clara tries in the first
half, both converted, and both the
result, of legitimate, hard, rugby,
brought scant comfort to the Cardinal
rooters. The period was lacking in
feature plays. The Varsity showed
no great merit in heeling out the ball,
nor did it. uncork any noteworthy
passing rushes. A few incipient ones
< were nipped in the bud pit her by bung

I visitors. On one occasion Urban and
I Harrigan figured in a fast passing
rally near the Catholic goal, which
should have scored, but failed to ma
terialize.
Flood's try for Santa Clara was the
outcome of a fine piece of rugby. This

Catholic wing is a hard, speedy player.
Ybarrando, the last Santa Clara cap

score.
A fair crowd for a Wednesday game
was in evidence in the bleachers. Its
lack of enthusiasm was in evidence

First Hall.
Ybarrando kicked off for Santa
Clara. The ball was twice booted to
the touch line and a scrum was called
at 25. The play centered about mid
field. Santa Clara was awarded a free
kick and the ball went to touch at 15.
On a free kick for the Cardinal, Brown
found touch near center. The Mission
pack showed a burst of speed, and
play surged dangerously into Cardinal
ground.
From a passing rush Flood secured
the ball and went over the Stanford
line for the first score. Ybarrando
converted. Score, sto 0.
The Varsity came back with a rush
and for several minutes the pack
zigzagged across the midfield line.
Harrigan gained 10 yards by a pretty
kick to touch. Neither scrum was
able to heel the ball out cleanly, and
the resulting play was ragged and zig- ,
zagging.
The second try for Santa Clara was i
registered a few seconds before half
time, when Ybarrando carried the ball !
directly under the crossbar. The .
Mission first five easily converted, and i
the score stood 10-0. The ball was at ;
Stanford's 10 at half time.
Second Half.
Brown kicked off and the Cardinal '
fifteen followed the ball down with a
rush. Play swept from the 10, to 30,
to 10, but the Mission defense was
strong. A passing rush carried the
ball almost over the line, and here
Ybarrando was penalized for holding
the ball in the scrum. Brown sent
the pigskin squarely between the up
rights and the Cardinal was credited
with three points. Cass replaced A.
Erb, while Kern took Andrew's place
at center. The Catholic college fifteen
were again given a free kick, and dur
ing the next three minutes the ball did
not leave Cardinal territory. Smith
replaced Watkins. Rushes by the
backs and good work by the forwards
turned the tables on the Santa
Clarans, and play reached their 10.
Stanford was given a free kick and
Cass added three points to the Car
dinal total by a field goal. Santa Clara
retaliated by sending Best over for
another try, the wing scoring from
a passing rush. Ybarrando converted,
and the score was 15-6. Three
minutes later Cass startled the
bleachers by kiekinc; a goal from play,!
and the Cardinal side of the score- ;
board showed 10. The last minute of
play did not change the figures, the

ball going to touch at Stanford's 15 at
the crack of the gun.

Defeat was the portion meted out to
the Stanford Varsity this afternoon on
its own field, in a game for which
! such an outcome had been least antici
-1 pated. Not until the last few moments
, of play did the Cardinal fifteen strike
j its gait, and listlessness marked much
lof the game up to that point. At this
time the gray-jerseyed players warm
ed u pand the hot finish kept the
bleacherites continually on their feet.
It was too late, however, to regain the
lost ground, and in order to hold her
advantage Santa Clara adopted tactics
calculated to delay the game. Best's
score put another damper on the hopes
of the rooters.
Santa Clara has a fast, fighting team,
and this fact, coupled with a Varsity
slump, accounts for the score. It was
a mixed team, composed partly of sec
ond fifteen players, which Coach Pres
ley sent on the field.
Louis C'ass' field goal from play in
the last minute was a beautiful piece
of work. All of Stanford's points were
made by kicks, Cass being credited
with two and Brown with one.
