### 
With the purpose of preparing the
women for an intelligent exercise of
the prerogative of suffrage, the execu
tive board of the Women's Civic league
is conducting an active campaign of
political education in a series of in
teresting weekly meetings.
Such vital subjects as party plat
forms, party organization, party con
ventions, and local candidates, have
already been included in the program
for discussion. Next Tuesday evening
a straw ballot is to be taken as a
means of demonstrating the mechan
ics of voting. In addition to the test
election there is to be a discussion of
the present day problems and move
ments. Professor E. B. Krehbiel is
to speak to the members on the sub
ject of "The Forecast of the New
Administration."
Last night, members of the league
discussed the eight propositions to be
submitted to the voters in the state
election on November 5.
Miss Tsabel McCracken discussed
Senate Amendment 3 and the annexa
tion initiatory measure; Miss Florence
Williams, gr., Assembly Amendment
Miss Leslie Til an chard, the referen
dum petitions; Mrs. E. Allen, the race
track measure, nml Mrs. Bingham the
taxation measure.
The league is investigating every
phase of political endeavor 1n order
that the members may go to the polls
j prepared to cast an intelligent, ballot
on the measures or candidates sub
mitted to their judgment.
The Civic leaerue claims the distinc
tion of being one of the few organiza
tions on the campus which does not
collect dues from its members. The
executive board under the direction
of Miss N. Check, '14, is campaigning
for many new members as the or
ganization is open to all women stu
dents, whether voters or not.
