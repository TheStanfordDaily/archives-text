# Juniors Urged to Get Plugs.
## 
### 
In view of the fact that there is still
a considerable number of plugs re
maining unpurchased at the Regent,
the Plug Ugly committee has request
ed that the men of the 1914 class get
their official headgear at once. The
artists who are decorating the plugs
have also asked that the Juniors
select their hats immediately. The
plugs are obtainable for one dollar at
the Regent.
