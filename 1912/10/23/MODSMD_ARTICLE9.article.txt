# A
						Stanford Flower.

### 
Each year before the Big Game
someone raises the question "what

flower is to be worn at
the contest that is typical
of Stanford," or "what
is the Stanford flower."

The flowers generally preferred are
the dark red chrysantheum or the
dark red carnation. Why not decide
this question definitely and at once?
This might well come within the
province of the Women's Conference.
