Overcoats for Young Men
C~>|OLLEGE MEN are ever on the lookout for
_j originalities in the matter of dress, providing
the standards of good taste are not violated.
Our Fall stock includes many innovations that
are both correct and artistic. Belted backs and shawl
collars are rapidly replacing the older types.
Where convertible collars are preferred, our per
fect fitting "Rise and Fall" collar is recommended.
