# INJURY TO FRANK NOT AS SERIOUS AS FEARED
## AUXILIARY DIRT FIELD WILL BE USED THIS WEEK. Brown and Andrews Showing Good Formâ€”Other Timely Talk of Turf. 
### 
The injury to
A1 Frank sus
tained in yester
day's game with
Santa Clara has
not proven as
serious as was at
first feared. His
left knee, which
was badly in
jured in one of
the games last
season, was
strained in the
scrum, and the
speedy break
away at once left
the field. Ex
amination has

determined that the strain will not
keep Frank out of the game perman
ently, though it endangers his chances
of entering the big contest on Novem
ber 9.


A1 Frank, '13
