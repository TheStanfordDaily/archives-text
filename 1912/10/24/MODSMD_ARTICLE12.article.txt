# SOCIAL SERVICE MAY BE ABSORBED BY Y.M.C.A.
## CHAPLAIN HOPES TO INTEREST ASSOCIATION IN CHARITY. Independent Social Service Club Said To Be Too Unstable For Most Effective Work. 
### 
Social service, its importance as a
part of campus life, and its logical
relationship with the work of the
Christian Association, will form the
subject of a talk to men in the Men's
Room tonight by D. Charles Gardner,
the University Chaplain.
Dr. Gardner's desire is to have the
Y. M. C. A. assume charge of the men's
Social Service Club, which has had a
checkered career for many years as an
independent organization. The Y. W.
C. A. has already incorporated social
service work as one of its active de
partments.
In an interview last night, Dr. Gard
ner said:
"My work with the Stanford Alumni
in San Francisco will demand a great
deal of my time this year, and I wish
to have active leadership of the cam
pus social service work taken from my
shoulders if men of sufficient interest
and organizing ability can be found
to incorporate the work in the Y. M.
C. A. It is for that purpose that I
will address the men tonight.
"The fact that a new personnel to
carry on the work has to be drafted
every few years under the present
system gives the club a very sandy
foundation. After the earthquake and
fire of 190R, work was carried on very
successfully because there was a defin
ite work to do.
"At one time, men interested in the
work were organized in effective
groups under good management, and
made an interesting study of social
and economic problems. Rut the
classes drifted apart when leaders of
the study movement left the campus.
"I think that as a part of the Y. M.
C. A., which has a fixed organization
and place in university activity, the
Social Service Club would enjoy a
much more uniform prosperity than at
present. The Employment Bureau,
which is the only arm of social ser
vice at present supported by the asso
ciation, has done effective work."
The meeting will be called at 7:10,
and will be dismissed in time for
those present to hear Dr. L. R. Wil
bur's address. Men who are interest
ed in social service work are invited
to be present.
