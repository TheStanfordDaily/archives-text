# Boom Time.

This year promises to be a record
one for the Stanford Union project.

First we had the ap
pearance of H. C. Hoo-

ver, '95, the Father of
the Stanford Union, who started the
year's campaign. Then the benefit
production of Hani's Head Society, and
now we have the plan proposed to
bring complete returns of the presi
dential election to the campus and
charge a small admission to aid the
Union. If we are to have the Stan
ford Union we must have the backing
of all the students. Such plans as
these show that the students are
boosting the project. Let's keep it up.
We want the Union building started
this year.
