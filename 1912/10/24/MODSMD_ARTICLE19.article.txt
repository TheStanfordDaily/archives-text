Editor, Daily Palo Alto:
Allow me, through your columns, to
enter a protest against a nuisance that
has long been with us. To be sure,
this is not our only trouble. A wooden
bench decorates our Quadrangle;
many professors hold their classes
until the second bell; our girls have
to make up gym cuts incurred while
attending assemblies, and the incense
of burning tobacco still rises under
the red tiles. Yet it seems to me that
over and above these may be placed
the nuisance to which I refer: THE
ROUGHS!
Presumptious it may seem to attack
an institution so firmly attached to
our Stanford life, but great changes
for the better have taken place in the
past: our girls need no longer fear
to lose their delicate viands, and the
silent (?) mob that used to skulk
about each dance has thinned some
what. Now let one more step be
taken in the right direction by elimin
ating the crowds of men that hang
about the Law steps and at the En
gineering corner to stand, smoke and
stare, making themselves obnoxious to
sight and hearing. Why these men,
uncouth in manner and unkempt in
appearance, should be tolerated is be
yond me.
If the ten minutes allowed between
classes is so much that it leaves time
for this sort of thing, let it be cut
down to five or even two or three
minutes.
At any sacrifice let us thin out these
weeds.
