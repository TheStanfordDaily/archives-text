# Twenty Years Ago Today.

Miss Edith Wilcox, one of the first
two lady graduates, visited the Univer
sity today.
Alexander, '9r>, has purchased a
racing bicycle and will practice in the
Quadrangle for the Thanksgiving meet
in San Jose.
To accommodate the increasing
number of students who frequent the
library as a study room, another long
table has been placed in the reading
room.
Lens, the New York bicyclist, who is
making a tour of the world on his
wheel, passed through Palo Alto yes
terday, accompanied by fifty othei
wheelmen.
We need a post-office. There are
640 students, about 100 in the faculty,
including their families, and nearly
half a hundred other persons on the
campus. Receiving all their mail
through the registrar's office and the
co-op. store is a slow process.
Several selections by the Encina
stringed orchestra and songs by Baker,
'95, and Kennedy, '95, followed. Then
Dr. Jordan and Senator Stanford made
speeches which were greeted with
rousing enthusiasm. All then moved
to the great dining-room, where sand
wiches, cakes, cookies, apples, grapes,
figs, iced creams, and lemonade await
ed the appreciative students.
Over two hundred and fifty men stu
dents assembled at Senator Stanford's
grounds Saturday evening to welcome
his return from Europe. In spite of
an attempt at secrecy, their coming
was anticipated, and all were invited
into the house. The throng poured in
in single file and each was greeted
with a hearty handshake by Senator
and Mrs. Stanford, and Dr. and Mrs.
Jordan.
