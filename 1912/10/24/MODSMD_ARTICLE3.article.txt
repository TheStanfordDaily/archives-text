That the 1913 rugby squad will in
clude a fullback of unusual ability
in booting and defensive work was
demonstrated yesterday. Ray Brown's
work in that difficult position was
stellar, and would not suffer in com
parison with any playing seen on Stan
ford Field this season, with the pos
sible exception of the remarkable
punting exhibition given the bleachers
in the last game with the Australians.
