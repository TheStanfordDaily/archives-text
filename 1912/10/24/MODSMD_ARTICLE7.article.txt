# FULL ELECTION RETURNS TO FLASH IN AID OF UNION
## 
### 
For the first time in the history of
American newspapers a rural com
munity is to receive as full returns
from the coming presidential election
as will the biggest city in the United
States.
After the success of the bulletins
issued by The Daily Palo Alto during
the recent World Baseball Series, the
management of this publication de
cided to issue night bulletins of the
coming national election, to be given
in such a place that admission might
be charged for the benefit of the
Stanford Union,
A special telegraph line will be con
nected with the campus and over the
leased lines will come the same re
turns that will be flashed on Market
street. These will be thrown upon a
screen in some place on the campus,
where an admission of twenty-five

cents will be charged. The proceeds
will be turned over to the Stanford
Union.
The residents of the campus and
neighborhood have never been able to
obtain satisfactory reports at the time
of the big elections and had to wait
until the appearance of the city papers
on the following morning to learn the
correct returns. This year the first
returns will reach the campus about
7:30 of the tuning of November 5 and
the last bulletins will be flashed sim
ultaneously with those in San Fran
cisco.
Complete plans are now being made
by a special committee composed of
.1. E. McDowell, '00, chairman, Profes
sor R. L. Green, of the Mathematics
department, E. F. Hollman, '11, D. W.
Burbank, '09, K. L. Schaupp, '12, and
I. I. Ingraham, '13.
