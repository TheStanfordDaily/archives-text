# VARSITY AND BARBS TO AGAIN TRY CONCLUSIONS
## BOTH TEAMS TO PUT IN STRONG LINEUPS. Third Train Will Meet Palo Alto High at 2:30—Main Match at 3:30. 
### 
Barbarian and collegian will once
more oppose each other on the turf
tomorrow afternoon. The Barbs will
bring to the campus a particularly
formidable team; much stronger, in
fact, than the combination which
held the 15lue and Gold to a lfi-3
score on California Field Saturday.
Coach Presley and Captain Cass will
send onto the field a Varsity fifteen of
high calibre. Cass and Erb will again
be seen in their respective stations at
half back and full back, and the rest
of the back field will be strong. Ac
cording to the announced lineup, Ris
ling is to assume the first five job,
with Harrigan at second five. Kern
will appear at center, and the wings
will be Noble and Reeves. The ever
changing front rank will tomorrow be
composed of Corbett, Sanborn and Sin
clair. Smith and Partridge form the
heavy middle-rank duo with Schaupp
behind them. Gard will occupy his
usual berth at breakaway, and, as
anticipated, Thoburn will balance him,
succeeding the injured Frank.
The Barbarian lineup has not been
definitely decided upon, but it is
hoped to bring down a fast fifteen,
including Pittler, Fairbanks, Duben
dorf, Brown, Fyfe, and McElrath in
the scrum, and Griffiths, Lopez, Smith,
Forbes, Tufts, Norton and Incell be
hind them. It is certain that at
four Stanfordites or former Stanford
ites will be numbered among the
fifteen Barbarians.
The kickoff in the Varsity contest
is set for 3:30. At 2:30 the Stanford
third team will lineup against the
Palo Alto high school fifteen. The
local preparatory school team is
recognized as probably the premier
high school fifteen of this section.
The lineup of the third team will be
by no means a weak one, and a close
and snappy contest should be the re
sult of the arrangement of this game.
The possession of a season ticket or
fifty cents is a prerequisite to admit
tance to both games.
