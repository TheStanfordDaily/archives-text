# Never.

All of the seats for the Big Game
that were placed on sale on the cam
pus have been sold. This means that

by the time of the November
contest bleacher seats will be
at a premium. This gives a

chance for ticket scalpers to make
capital from the scarcity. No student
has ever been catalogued as such, and
we hope that the precedent will not
be set this year. Such tactics would
be unbecoming of a Stanford student.
May it never come to pass.
