Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Humor, college humor, strange,
strained, and insane, found its way
on the Quad this morning. Comedy,
funny, foolish, and of the small-town
type, appeared hand in hand with
H umor.
As a result of a communication
published in the columns of "The
Daily Palo Alto" last evening, about
one hundred self-styled, and self-ap
proved college-cut comedians appear
ed this morning on the Quad in over
done "Rough" attire. That each man
was funny was proved, for he ap
plauded his neighbor in brofherly
politeness. Many of these "Rough"
make-ups would do credit to a Sunday
funny-paper, while others were about
as clever as the proverbial crutch.
Some of the "funny fellows" wore
old hats. Some even went so far as
I to leave off their neckties and open
their shirt-collars. Thus the brave
| men dared pneumonia and exposed
| their manly chests, all in honor of
and to do penance to that time-honor
jed and over-worked phraseâ€”the Stan-
I ford Rough. Some of the clever
youths went a little farther and took
an extra turn on the cuffs of his
trousers, while one real devil mussed
up his hair and chewed a match right
| in the very eyes of the crowd.
If this is college comedy the writer
; believes that we have had enough to
| last for the remainder of the year.
The comedians have all had a good
laugh at each other and so lets re-
I sume our natural dress and think
twice before we again become comical.
S. A. M.
