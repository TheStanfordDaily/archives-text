# Y.M.C.A. TO ASSUME SOCIAL SERVICE WORK
## DR. GARDNER TELLS OF FIELD FOR CAMPUS HELP. General Committee Will Draw Up Campaign Plans to Launch Service Project. 
### 
From now on, the Social Service
Club of university men, which was
formed as an independent organiza
tion in 1906, will be conducted as an
arm of the campus Y. M. C. A. The
determination was reached yesterday,
after consideration sjnce last semes
ter, and a general committee has been
appointed to confer with Dr. D.
Charles Gardner, the university chap
lain, either this week or next week, to
define a plan of campaign by which to
get the best working results.
W. H. Bloeser, '14, was appointed
chairman of a prospective Social Ser
vice committee, in May, by the secre
tary of the Y. M. C. A., when fusion
of the club with the Christian associa
tion was considered probable. Bloe
ser has now appointed the following
committeemen to work under him in
the effort to launch the work: E. H.
Ford, '14, P. P. Clover, '14, J. R. Mor
gan, IG. Eight more men are wanted
for the general committee, and will
probably be appointed within the nex;
few days.
The work of the new Social Service
Club, which will be primarily an effort
to extend a helping hand, and a study
of social and political problems of the
country, was explained in a general
way last night to an interested group
in the association room by Dr. Gard
ner, who insisted that the work plan
ned offers a red-blood opportunity to
do good, and should meet the approval
of those who revolt at mere hymn
singing three times a week. The prac
tical nature of the work contemplated
was illustrated by reference to the
numerous services of the Club just
after the earthquake of 1906.
