# THE 						BLUE WILL MEET THE BLUE AND GOLD
## WARATAHS OPPOSE CALIFORNIA TOMORROW. Results of Australia-California and Australia-Stanford Will Give Line on Teams 
### 
Cardinal enthusiasts will watch with
almost as much interest the outcome
oi' the game to be played at the rival
university Saturday as they will the
contest in which their own team
figures. The Australians and the Cali
fornia Varsity will try conclusions on
California field: and after the game
i ; over the comparative score artists
will be in their glory. It is on the
games between Stanford and the Aus
tralians and California and the Aus
tralians that the dopesters will prin
cipally base their predictions for
i November 9.
The Waratahs will go into Satur
i day's game in a rather crippled con
dition. The preceding games have
temporarily laid low four of their
strong players.
Wylie, the splendid breakaway, in
jured in the second Stanford match,
jis out of the game for the season. His
i broken rib is improving, but it will
not permit him to don a uniform again
during the American trip.. Clarken
with an injured leg, .Tones, with a bad
shoulder, and Meibush, nursing his
knee, will all be out of the game on
Saturday.
I Coach Sehaeffer will undoubtedly
send his strongest team onto the field
to oppose the Australians. Clint
Evans, who was out. of the game for
I ten days with an injured ankle, is
'again working with the team, and with
both Evans and Abrams in form once
! more there is no such thing as a. Cali
fornia hospital list. The Blue and
jGold Varsity players have been suffer
ing from a slump recently, but it is
I believed that the additional stimulus
jof the Australian games will bring
I them out.
