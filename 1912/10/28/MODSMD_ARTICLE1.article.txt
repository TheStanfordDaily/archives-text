# GOLDEN BEAR'S GROWLS SILENCED BY WARATAHS
## WARATAHS SCORE 18-0 WIN ON SATURDAY. California Hacks Show Failure as Yet to Attain Cohesive Playing. 
### 
Outclassed and non-plussed by the
play of the Australians, California was
forced to dip its standard to the
strain of IS to 0, Saturday afternoon.
Jupiter Pluvius.played a star game for
the visitors and his efforts were a
large factor in the scoring. Before the
Held became a quagmire the game was
fast and exciting. The California
players showed well in defence. The
visitors evidenced their versatility by
quickly adopting their style of play
to lit the conditions of the ball and
field.
When passing seemed impossible
the Australians kept the ball on the
ground and scored almost at will. In
spite of the wet and slippery condi
tion of the ball the Waratali backs at
times showed the seven thousand spec
tators what real rugby was like. The
California varsity seemed to be com
posed of fifteen individuals who made
no attempt at team work. There was
very little backing up and many in
cipient rushes were spoiled by failure
to follow up.
Trick Plays.
The Australians had their opponents
baffled with numerous trick plays.
The short pass was especially effective.
Dwyer, Carrol, Meibusch, Prentice,
Kent, and Richards, were among the
best of the Antipodeans.
W. W. Hill, secretary of the New
South Wales Rugby Union, refereed
and proved himself an official par ex
cellence. The Blue and Gold players
were frequent offenders of the off-side
rule and lost several opportunities by
the failure of the forwards to keep in
position.
The work of the California front
rankers was a surprise to many of
the spectators. Time after time the
Blue and Gold players beat the
visitors in hooking the ball. On
numerous times the front row men
would get the ball but the center pas
sage would be blocked. McKim and
Carpenter were especially prominent
in attack. McKim proved himself to
be one of the most aggressive of the
forwards and followed tip well despite
his propensity for offside work. Flem
ing was a factor in the pack and out
shone his side partner Hoskins.
Bill King, despite his two hundred
pound handicap, proved himself to be
a great ground gainer in the ruck and
a dangerous dribbler. Fletcher was
often in the limelight in the loose and
started numerous rushes for his side.
He is quick to smother the opposing
half and gave evidence of being a
difficult man to catch once he gets
agoing.
Naturally much was to be expected
of the veterans Morris, Stroud, Allen
and Peart. But the work of the quar
tet was a disappointment. Each
would have been a star if the other
fourteen players had been allowed to
keep the bench dry. There was a lack
of combination. The California backs
failed to electrify with any startling
passing rushes even before the rain
began to fall. Monte Morris showed
himself to be still a great director of
play back of the scrum but Hazeltine
at first five, either because of faulty
passing or because of an inability to
hang on to the ball, was unable to aid
in getting the half-back's pass out to
the three-quarter line. Morris fre
quently, when pressed, resorted to
throwing rather than kicking to get
the ball to the touch line. Hlxcept for
an occasional good boot, Johnny
Stroud failed to play to form. His
individual work was noticeable at
times but availed little. The same
may be said of Chet Allen, who has
appeared to a better advantage on
many other occasions. The two gain
| ed more yards by boots to touch than
by running in. However, both men
showed that it was unwise to give
either too much freedom witli the ball.
Dills outshone his compatriot Gianelli
on the wings. The Pomona lad had
little opportunity to advance with the
bail but was a source of trouble to
any opposing back field.
Handicapped by the disadvantage of
playing opposite to the sturdy Dwyer,
the work that Peart performed would
have probably been more noticeable on
a dry field. The California fullback
shone at times with touch-finders, but
he failed to show any remarkable
(ground-gaining ability through the
loose.

appeared to a better advantage on
many other occasions. The two gain

by running in. However, both men
showed that it was unwise to give
either too much freedom witli the ball.
Dills outshone his compatriot Gianelli
on the wings. The Pomona lad had
little opportunity to advance with the
bail but was a source of trouble to
any opposing back field.
Handicapped by the disadvantage of
playing opposite to the sturdy Dwyer,
the work that Peart performed would
have probably been more noticeable on
a dry field. The California fullback
shone at times with touch-finders, but
he failed to show any remarkable
(ground-gaining ability through the
loose.
Outclassed and non-plussed by the
play of the Australians, California was
forced to dip its standard to the
strain of IS to 0, Saturday afternoon.
Jupiter Pluvius.played a star game for
the visitors and his efforts were a
large factor in the scoring. Before the
Held became a quagmire the game was
fast and exciting. The California
players showed well in defence. The
visitors evidenced their versatility by
quickly adopting their style of play
to lit the conditions of the ball and
field.
When passing seemed impossible
the Australians kept the ball on the
ground and scored almost at will. In
spite of the wet and slippery condi
tion of the ball the Waratali backs at
times showed the seven thousand spec
tators what real rugby was like. The
California varsity seemed to be com
posed of fifteen individuals who made
no attempt at team work. There was
very little backing up and many in
cipient rushes were spoiled by failure
to follow up.
Trick Plays.
The Australians had their opponents
baffled with numerous trick plays.
The short pass was especially effective.
Dwyer, Carrol, Meibusch, Prentice,
Kent, and Richards, were among the
best of the Antipodeans.
W. W. Hill, secretary of the New
South Wales Rugby Union, refereed
and proved himself an official par ex
cellence. The Blue and Gold players
were frequent offenders of the off-side
rule and lost several opportunities by
the failure of the forwards to keep in
position.
The work of the California front
rankers was a surprise to many of
the spectators. Time after time the
Blue and Gold players beat the
visitors in hooking the ball. On
numerous times the front row men
would get the ball but the center pas
sage would be blocked. McKim and
Carpenter were especially prominent
in attack. McKim proved himself to
be one of the most aggressive of the
forwards and followed tip well despite
his propensity for offside work. Flem
ing was a factor in the pack and out
shone his side partner Hoskins.
Bill King, despite his two hundred
pound handicap, proved himself to be
a great ground gainer in the ruck and
a dangerous dribbler. Fletcher was
often in the limelight in the loose and
started numerous rushes for his side.
He is quick to smother the opposing
half and gave evidence of being a
difficult man to catch once he gets
agoing.
Naturally much was to be expected
of the veterans Morris, Stroud, Allen
and Peart. But the work of the quar
tet was a disappointment. Each
would have been a star if the other
fourteen players had been allowed to
keep the bench dry. There was a lack
of combination. The California backs
failed to electrify with any startling
passing rushes even before the rain
began to fall. Monte Morris showed
himself to be still a great director of
play back of the scrum but Hazeltine
at first five, either because of faulty
passing or because of an inability to
hang on to the ball, was unable to aid
in getting the half-back's pass out to
the three-quarter line. Morris fre
quently, when pressed, resorted to
throwing rather than kicking to get
the ball to the touch line. Hlxcept for
an occasional good boot, Johnny
Stroud failed to play to form. His
individual work was noticeable at
times but availed little. The same
may be said of Chet Allen, who has
appeared to a better advantage on
many other occasions. The two gain
| ed more yards by boots to touch than
by running in. However, both men
