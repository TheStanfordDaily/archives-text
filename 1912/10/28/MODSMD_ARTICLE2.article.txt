# SAN FRANCISCO EXAMINER
## SCOOPS DAILY PALO ALTO 
### 
The inimitable news service of the
Hearst newspapers minute by minute
will Hash the latest presidential elec
tion returns into the Assembly Hall
on the night of November 5.
Thus, for the first time, the San
Francisco Examiner will score a de
cisive "beat" on The Daily Palo Alto.
But as the "beafwill furnish material
aid to tlieStanford Union, The Daily
Palo Alto resignedly permits the
Examiner to "Put it over."
The Hearts newspapers have the
most complete and accurate system of
gathering election returns of any met
ropolitan dailies in the world.. From
every important central committee
point, the Hearst operators dash off
the returns as fast as they are record
ed by ballot clerks all over the coun
try. The Hearst leased wire, the long
est in the world, permits the returns
to reach the coast at the same time
the operators in Chicago receive them.
Complete Returns.
This year, the San Francisco Exam
iner has made elaborate preparations
to gather partial and complete re
turns from the most remote districts,
so that those who come to the Assem
bly hall on election night will receive
as complete returns as those who
gather on Market street in San
Francisco.
The general committee in charge of
the rally has decided to turn over one
third of the proceeds from the 25 cents
admission charged to the Woman's
Clubhouse fund. The two-thirds will
go for the benefit of the Stanford
Union.
The representatives of the different
political parties on the campus already
are busy with plans to uphold the
prestige of their favorites before the
screen on election night.
The committee probably will ar
range for the women voters on the
campus to occupy sections of the gal
leries where they may unite in sup
port of their respective candidates.
The nucleus of a Woodrow Wilson
club was formed today by representa

tives from the various fraternities and
clubs on the campus, assembled in the
Education building.
Wilson Supporters Active.
G. A. Ditz, '11, has been given the
task of organizing the club by the
local committee. All the Wilson sup
porters will assemble tomorrow noon
to elect officers and prepare plans for
the rooting at the rally.
The president of the club will be
asked to name a committee to take
the responsibility for the preparations
for the rally. Although the life ol'
the club will only be one week, the
members will waste no time in creat
ing as much enthusiasm as possible
for the Democratic candidate.
It was the sense of the Wilson meet
ing this afternoon that the women of
the campus be permitted to form their
own organization to boost for the New
Jersey candidate on election night,
and they probably will have a feminine
rooting section in the gallery.
The Progressives have undertaken
plans for the rally with true Bull
Moose energy and their section on the
floor promises to lack nothing in
spirit.
Since the announcement of the rally
for the benefit of the clubhouse pro
jects, an increasing number of cellu
loid buttons are in evidence on the
campus.
Every one who comes to the Assem
bly Hall on election night will be
asked his political preference and the
lot of him or her who has none to mani
fest will probably be far from com
fortable. It will be embarrassing, to
say the least, to sit between two voci
ferous bands of rooters.
The general committee in charge of
the rally is working with the sole pur
pose of making the rally as lively an
event as is possible for a college audi
ence to survive.
Tickets will be placed on sale at
the Bookstore tomorrow for Stanford
students and faculty. After Friday the
seats will be thrown open to the gen
eral public.

Every one who comes to the Assem
bly Hall on election night will be
asked his political preference and the
lot of him or her who has none to mani
fest will probably be far from com
fortable. It will be embarrassing, to
say the least, to sit between two voci
ferous bands of rooters.
The general committee in charge of
the rally is working with the sole pur
pose of making the rally as lively an
event as is possible for a college audi
ence to survive.
Tickets will be placed on sale at
the Bookstore tomorrow for Stanford
students and faculty. After Friday the
seats will be thrown open to the gen
eral public.
The inimitable news service of the
Hearst newspapers minute by minute
will Hash the latest presidential elec
tion returns into the Assembly Hall
on the night of November 5.
Thus, for the first time, the San
Francisco Examiner will score a de
cisive "beat" on The Daily Palo Alto.
But as the "beafwill furnish material
aid to tlieStanford Union, The Daily
Palo Alto resignedly permits the
Examiner to "Put it over."
The Hearts newspapers have the
most complete and accurate system of
gathering election returns of any met
ropolitan dailies in the world.. From
every important central committee
point, the Hearst operators dash off
the returns as fast as they are record
ed by ballot clerks all over the coun
try. The Hearst leased wire, the long
est in the world, permits the returns
to reach the coast at the same time
the operators in Chicago receive them.
Complete Returns.
This year, the San Francisco Exam
iner has made elaborate preparations
to gather partial and complete re
turns from the most remote districts,
so that those who come to the Assem
bly hall on election night will receive
as complete returns as those who
gather on Market street in San
Francisco.
The general committee in charge of
the rally has decided to turn over one
third of the proceeds from the 25 cents
admission charged to the Woman's
Clubhouse fund. The two-thirds will
go for the benefit of the Stanford
Union.
The representatives of the different
political parties on the campus already
are busy with plans to uphold the
prestige of their favorites before the
screen on election night.
The committee probably will ar
range for the women voters on the
campus to occupy sections of the gal
leries where they may unite in sup
port of their respective candidates.
The nucleus of a Woodrow Wilson
club was formed today by representa

tives from the various fraternities and
clubs on the campus, assembled in the
Education building.
Wilson Supporters Active.
G. A. Ditz, '11, has been given the
task of organizing the club by the
local committee. All the Wilson sup
porters will assemble tomorrow noon
to elect officers and prepare plans for
the rooting at the rally.
The president of the club will be
asked to name a committee to take
the responsibility for the preparations
for the rally. Although the life ol'
the club will only be one week, the
members will waste no time in creat
ing as much enthusiasm as possible
for the Democratic candidate.
It was the sense of the Wilson meet
ing this afternoon that the women of
the campus be permitted to form their
own organization to boost for the New
Jersey candidate on election night,
and they probably will have a feminine
rooting section in the gallery.
The Progressives have undertaken
plans for the rally with true Bull
Moose energy and their section on the
floor promises to lack nothing in
spirit.
Since the announcement of the rally
for the benefit of the clubhouse pro
jects, an increasing number of cellu
loid buttons are in evidence on the
campus.
