# Stanford Defeats Alameda.
## 
### 
Playing with one man short, the
Stanford soccer team defeated the
Alameda eleven Saturday by a score
of 3 to 1. The game was played at
Lincoln Park, Alameda. The Cardinal
players started things off with a rush,
scoring twice during the first half.
Rain made the second half somewhat
slower. Alameda scored one and near
the end of the half Higgins again
tallied for Stanford, making the final
count 3 to 1. Captain Pellas, who has
so far been out of the game with an
injured knee, expects to be with the
team in next Saturday's game.
