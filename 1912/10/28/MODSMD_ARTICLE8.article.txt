# CARDINAL AT HALFMAST AFTER BARBARIAN ONSET
## RESULT OF STANFORD SLUMP IS 6-0 DEFEAT. Palo Alto High Victory Over Third Varsity is Omen of Defeat in Succeeding Contest. 
### 
Continuing in the slump in which it
has been laboring since the departure
of the Australians, the Varsity, Satur
day, went down to a G-0 defeat at the
hands of the Barbarians. While at
times the work of the Cardinal play
ers showed redeeming flashes, it must
lie admitted that as a whole their play
was ragged and none too fast. The
Barbs had the better of the contention
in hooking the ball out of the scrum,
and carried off the lion's share of (he
lineout honors.
In the backfield some neat passing
rushes in which the ball went from
the half to the second five and thence
out by the usual route were at times
begun; but these did not progress to
the ground-gaining stage. Oftentimes
the backs proved hesitant and unskill
ful in handling the ball and failed to
cut in.
Nothing startling resulted from the
play of Risling at first and Harrigan
at second five. This was partly due
to the fact that none of the backs were
given great opportunity to show their
mettle, and partly to the fact that
Risling was not in the best of shape.
Urban played hard rugby at Noble's
wing, and both Andrews and Thoburn
were tried out. at center. Clover took
Thoburn's place at breakaway when
the latter was moved back. Other
substitutes sent into the forward divi
sion were Darsie, Watkins, Bly, Peck,
and Blase. In the backfield Temple
ton assumed the duties at wing when
Reeves was injured.
For the Barbs, Knowles played a
brilliant game, being ably seconded by
Smith, Forbes, and, in fact, all of
the backs. Of the forwards Turton,
Browne, McNair and Boulware were
hard and able fighters.

The Game.

Shortly after Browne's kickoff, Stan
ford worked the ball to a scrum near
the Barbarian line, but a free kick
sent play back again and soon it was
in Cardinal territory. Reeves in a
good run and boot found touch at mid
field, and at 40 Andrews made a pretty
intercepting catch and after a run
passed to Reeves who was downed at
the Barbarian 20. Here he received
the injury which put him out of the
game.
Smith's kick,, returned by Erb, put
the fighting at midfield. The ball
slowly advanced, and a passing push,
in which Cass, Harrigan and Andrews
figured, took it to the Barbarian SO.
Receiving from Boulware, McNair ad
vanced the ball to the Cardinal 30,
and from now on the Barbs assumed
the advantage, the ball zig-zagging
back and forth with neither team
scoring. Cass and Templeton figured
in good touch-finding boots.
It was in the second period that both
Barbarian trys were made. The first
came about the middle of the half. A
dribbling rush by the visiting forwards
had taken the ball to the Stanford 2H,
and on a long lineout Slater secured
