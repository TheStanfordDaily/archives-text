# ANNUAL RUSH TO BEGIN IN FRONT OF LIBRARY
## RULES FOR SATURDAY'S COMBAT ARE ANNOUNCED. Scene and Route of Plug Ugly Engagement Between Upperclassmen Changed. 
### 
With the idea in view of making
this year's Plug Ugly rush as interest
ing as possible and a fairer test of
the strength of the rival upperclass
men, it has been decided to have the
opening engagement of the plug
smashing contest begun on the steps
in front of the general library. There
the Juniors, unmolested, will circle
the Outer Quad by the English build
ing and t hence to the Law building,
while the Seniors pass through the
Memorial Court. Under the Arcades
by t lie Law building the light for the
possession of the Inner Quad will be
gin and will terminate in the east
arch.
Yesterday afternoon, a committee
composed of A. O. Gragg, '12, K. L.
Schaupp, '12, 1. I. Ingraham, '13, and
O. H. Castle, '14, representing the
I'niversity Conference, and W. M. Ar
gabrite,' 13, E. A. Wells, '14, and E. C.
Behrens, '14, of the rival classes, drew
up an agreement for the annual fight,
which is to be the attraction after the
Plug Ugly farce on Saturday evening.
In order to avoid a set fight tht.
rush is to be under the supervision of
a referee, who shall have the power
of stopping the fray at any time.
Karl Schaupp has been selected to act
as arbitrator.
Several plans and ideas were sub
mitted as to the best locality for the
rush, but the one chosen seemed the
most feasible and should tend toward
placing the annual Senior - Junioi
struggle on the original plan of the
early classes.
Tito flnles,
I. It shall be permissable for
Seniors to oppose bringing of Junior
posters on campus, but said posters
once laid shall not be removed.
11. There shall be no rough
housing of the show. The Juniors
shall lie allowed to produce the bin
lesque without such continued inter
ruption as will make it impossible
for the audience to hear the lines.
Any act which tends to make the pro
duction of the show impossible, such
as stealing scenery, kidnapping, etc.,
is considered objectionable.
111. The Plug Ugly Rush shall be
started on the steps directly in front
of the general library. From here the
Juniors will then circle Outer Quad
by the English building to Law build
ing unopposed. Here a fight for pos
session of Inner Quad will ensue, ter
minating in the east arch.
IV. The Rush may be stopped at
any time, at the discretion of a referee,
in order to avoid a set fight.
W. ARGABRITE, '13.
E. C. BEHRENS, *14.
