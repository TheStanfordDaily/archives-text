Editor, The Daily Palo Alto:
The first of every semester we are
told to subscribe to The Daily Palo
Alto. There are various reasons given
but the main one is that the paper is
the only means of receiving "official
announcements." So we take the
paper, and follow the announcements.
For the Daily Palo Alto of October
22, 1912, we read the following:
"Wednesday Ticket Sale.
"Football men, 9 to 12, etc.
"Girls' sale on Quad, 1:30 p.m. . . .
etc."
If the tickets are to be sold at one
thirty, why arrive at one? .Just before
one-thirty we come to the Quad, and
having drawn an excellent number we
do not worry. Hut, strange to say,
everything is still, and upon inquiry
we learn: "Oh, tickets are all sold.
No, we began at one. Oh well, the
time was changed some time last
night." A shrug, and that is all. The
Bookstore becomes the center of at
traction for the next three hours and,
after securing some tickets somewhere
akin to those of standing room stand
ard, we depart. Curosity, and a
faint hope that we might tind a germ
of management somewhere, leads us
to the bulletin board. Yes. After a
microscopic survey, we find, covering
a space which might easily be hidden
by a sheet of theme paper, a little
statement which suggests something
about . . from 1:30 to 1:00."
Thanks. Unfortunately there are
many who are near-sighted, many who
never pass a signboard, and an in
finitely great "many" who trust their
Daily Palo Alto —especially when an
announcement is made in heavy type
and bordered in black. We do not
hold the Daily Palo Alto responsible
for the unfortunate blunder, but the
lack of management displayed in the
whole affair is almost pitiable. This
is not the first time such a thing has
happened. Is it going to become a
continual performance? How about
it?
