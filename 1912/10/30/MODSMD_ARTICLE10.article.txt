# RALLYING ROOTERS SHOW LUSTY LUNGED LOYALTY
## HIDDEN "PEP" BURSTS OUT LAST EVENING. Impromptu in Front of the Team's Quarters is Addressed by Varsity Players. 
### 
The volcano broke loose again last
night. Deep down in the heart of the
Student Body there glows a little
spark which is known by various
terms, from "pep" to "that psycho
logical something," but which is
really only the Stanford Spirit. When
this bursts to the surface the result
is muuh like the eruption of any other
volcano—clouds of smoke, hideous
din, and a mighty flow of language if
not of lava.
Last evening a tremendous spirit of
loyalty to the team, burning fiercer
even in the hour when that team
seemed in the throes of a late-season
slump, brought the entire male popu
lation of the University together in
front of the Zeta Psi house. The
little nucleus which first gathered was
reenforced from moment to moment by
squads of men bringing gongs, guns,
bugles, and leather lungs.
Serpentining up Salvatierra and
back again to the team's quarters, the
yelling mob demanded speeches from
the players. While listening to these,
fresh fuel was thrown on the flames
by the dramatic and noisy arrival of
Encina Club en masse.
Assistant yell-leader D. Cass pre
sided and '-ansacked the house, de
manding a few words from every
player within it. Graduate Manager
D. W. Burbank was the first to come
forward. Tie remarked pithily:
"Tli© fenm lias as miicli fight in it
as you fellows show tonight, and that's
going some."
Embarrassed but smiling, Captain
Louis Cass declared: "This showing
sure looks great, gents. I can say to
you now that the team will gire all
its got on November ninth."
Trainer Maloney said in part: "The
team will show up its criticisers next
Saturday and will show tliein up even
more 011 November ninth."
Other members of the team echoed
similar sentiments.
