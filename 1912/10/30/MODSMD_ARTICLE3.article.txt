# VISITORS, BEWARE! MEASLES IS LOOSE AT NEW HOSPITAL!
## 
### 
Measles broke out at the Isolation
hospital yesterday. On the advice of
Professor H. Zinsser, of the Anatomy
department, who, strange to relate, it
responsible â€¢ for Measles being there,
strenuous measures have been taken
to confine the pest and prevent a re
currence of the outbreak.
Which makes it necessary to ex
plain that Measles is a dog and not a
virulent pest at. all, in justice to Pro
fessor Zinsser. Measles is the mascot
of the new Isolation Hospital and like
any other puppie is wont to wander
away in search of amusement wheu
no one is watching. But he has a
house of his own now, and a chain to
limit his doggish wanderlust. There
will be no outbreaks of Measles.
When caretaker King and his wife
took charge of the new Isolation
hospital last week, they suggested
that a canine mascot grow up with
the Institution.
Professor Zinsser was appealed to
and kindly consented to furnish the
desired quadruped, provided his dog
gish majesty always bears the cogno
men, Measles.
Measles is* of nondescript breed, but
affectionate disposition. When he,
grows up, about a year from now, in
tending marauders should beware the
attacks of Measles, when approaching
the hospital. If he continues to grow
at the rate he has in the past week,
lie will prove worse than a disease )
the offender. The caretaker hopes that
the hospital never will be without
Measles.
