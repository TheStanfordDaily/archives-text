# FOOTBALL SHOW TICKETS WILL BE SOLD MONDAY.
## Postponed From Friday to Avoid Conflict With Sale of Seats for Election Returns. 
### 
Seats for the football show will be
placed on sale at the Bookstore Mon
day instead of Friday as was pre
viously announced. The change was
made necessary by the fact that the
tickets for the election returns in the
Assembly Hall are to be placed on
general sale Friday and with two
sales there would be considerable
difficulty.
Monday the tickets may be had at
the Bookstore and at Weingartner's
in Palo Alto. The customary draw
ings will take place at S a.m., and
each person will be entitled to pur
chase four tickets.
Kolb and Dill are planning on run
ning in many special features on the
night of the show and every one will
be afforded a rare opportunity to see
the celebrated German comedians at
their best.
The play, "Lonesome Town," which
is to be presented is one in which
Kolb and Dill have starred before but
the present production has been large
ly rewritten and the music is all new.
San Francisco critics claim a greater
success for "Lonesome Town" than
that, which greeted the popular "Peck
O'Pickles" which was recently staered
at the Savoy.
