The Stanford Band will be one of j
the main attractions at the Election
Night Return performance. The Car
dinal bandsmen are now practicing on
special music for the big benefit and
are sure to duplicate the creditable j
showing that they have made at each
appearance this year. The musicians
will occupy the orchestra pit in the
Assembly Hall, overllowing onto the
front row, so as to provide room fdr
the entire band.
The committee in charge of the
evening's program are rapidly com
pleting the plans for the entertain-1
ment. Workmen are expected to ar
rive on the canfpus within the next
few days to install the special wire
that the Examiner will connect with
their leased wire, the longest in the '
world. They will also consult with :
the local committee concerning the
best place to place the telegraph in
struments in the Assembly Hall, where
they will begin to tick off the returns
about 7:30 next Tuesday evening.
The Intercollegiate Progressive
League went into session this after
noon and President Les Summerfield,
'12, was empowered to appoint a com-j
mittee of five to arrange for the Bull
Moose stunts at the election returns i
performance. From the enthusiasm
loosened at the meeting it was evident
that the Roosevelt partisans would
have a large turnout of rooters next !
Tuesday evening.
The Bull Moose committee on ar
rangements will consist of Les Sum
merfield, '12, Mike Hilton, '11, h.
Spence, '13, H. J. Pruett, gr., and G. L.
Shaul, '13. They will meet tomorrow i
afternoon to start their program.
The Wilson enthusiasts are at work
on their stunts for election evening
and state that their plans are nearly
completed. They do not intend to let
the Progressives have the best of the
evening noise without opposition.
Several of their cleverest artists are
now at work making cartoons to flash
on the screen between the election
returns.
