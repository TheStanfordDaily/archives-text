# COLLEGE AND GRADUATES ACTIVITIES RECOUNTED
## STANFORD ALUMNUS OF OCTOBER IS OFF THE PRESS. Appeal is Made to Graduates For Bits of Anecdotes Concerning Early University Life. 
### 
Containing a review of the current
events of the University for the past
month and a resume of the football
situation, the October number of the
Stanford Alumnus made its appear
ance on the campus today. No special
articles are featured in this issue, yet
the book is full of interesting accounts
of college activities, alumni notes,
football articles, pictures, and the like.
A full account of the visit of the
Australians, an article on "The
Chances in the Big Game," and a
"prospect story" on the intercollegiate
match by K. L. Schaupp, '12, cover the
football situation. The new isolation
hospital is told of, the activities con
cerning the Stanford Union are re
counted, the new Student Coancil is
described, the semester's plays are
criticized, and an account is given of
the month's assemblies.
In the editorial column, E. \V. Smith,
'99, editor of the Alumnus, comments
upon tlie visit of the YVaratahs, hopes
for a victory on the ninth and warns
the Alumni against a man claiming to
be a graduate who is passing bogus
checks, â€¢ using his university connec- !
tions as a means of identification.
Many of the Alumni notes concern
Stanford graduates in foreign lands.
Excerpts are taken from a letter from
Professor I'. .1. Treat, Ph. IX, '10, who
is spending this semester in the Orient
and who has met a number of former
students. The summer's quota of
Stanford people in Europe is also told
of. A list of the weddings and en
gagements of graduates is given, as
well as a number of recent changes of
addresses of alumni.
Louise Culver, '96. makes a plea for
reminiscences from Stanford gradu- ;
ates. A book is being prepared which
is to hare some important articles by
the faculty on the organization of the
university. It will also tell of life here
when students knew the faculty as well
as each other. It will contain stories
picked from the kaleidoscopic ac
counts of what can be told by gradu- j
ates. Bits of anecdotes, accounts of ;
pranks, stories that are told about the
hearth of the intimate things that oc- j

curred years ago, are all asked to be
sent to the resident Alnmni Associa
tion.
