Graduate Manager D. W. Burbank,
'09, has secured for the 1912 Football

Show those princes of
112 unmaking, Kolb and
Dill. No better a show
than "Lonesome Town"

could have been secured. The Gradu
ate Manager is to be congratulated in
signing up so excellent a show for the
evening after the Big Game. It was
only secured at a big expense and it is
now up to the students to make the
show pay for itself. A full house that
evening is necessary and the show will
be worth while. Every rooter should
get a ticket.
