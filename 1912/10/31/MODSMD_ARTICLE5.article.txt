# SNAPPY SHOW AT SAVOY WILL FOLLOW BIG GAME
## Kolb and Dill to Infuse Local Color Into Comedy For Entertainment of Stanford Supporters 
### 
A football show that is a real play;
one that will be enjoyed by men and
women alike, and that scintillates with
local color but at the same time has
the class and finesse to continually
draw crowds to a metropolitan theatre,
is what Stanford supporters are to be
(treated to on the night of the Big
Game.
The Rest Yet.
Stanford lias had football shows for
i years past but the production on No
! vember 9 bids fair to eclipse any pre
' vious Big Game gatherings that have
| ever been held. And it has only been
j long and repeated efforts on the part
of the Stanford management that lias
made it possible to secure such an
attraction as Kolb and Dill. Previous
football shows have usually relied for
| their success on the pep that follows
[ the winning of the game, and in the
event of a defeat have often turned out
otherwise. This year Stanford has ar
, ranged for something that in any
; event will be the equal of anything in
San Francisco but which victory will
of course greatly accentuate.
A few years ago the management of
the Savoy theater sold out then- house
I l or a football show to another insti
tution but there was so much rowdy
ism that the owners vowed then never
to let another football performance be
held there. Manager Burbank finally
persuaded them to take another chance
and promised that there would be no
rowdy tactics. This does not mean
that all frivolity is to be barred but
only such ungentlemanly conduct as
interferes with the production of the
play and the enjoyment of the evening. '
A Forking Play.
As for Kolb and Dill, almost every
one on the Pacific Coast is familiar
with their acting and they are prime j
favorites everywhere. The play "Lone
some Town," is considered the best of
their repertoire and always draws a
packed house in San Francisco when
ever it is presented. The play is a
jolly portrayal of events in the boom
city of Watts, in the southern part of
California. The droll adventures of

I Chico Charley, C. William Kolb's crea
j tion, and Bakersfield Bill, the favorite
role of Max Dill, serve to make the best
kind of entertainment and they are
ably abetted in their fun-making by
Percy Bronson in the character role of
tlie third tramp, Fresno Phil.
j The opening song, "Gee, but this is
ja Lonesome Town" is a comic classic,
and any one who does not choke with
laughter at the antics of Kolb and Dill
during the progress of the play should
consult his physician immediately.
No better testimonial for the play
can be had than that of one of the
San Francisco dramatic critics who
says, "Every part is congenially cast,
and the Kolb and Dill chorus, a
synonym for excellence, has plenty to
do and does it well. Although "Lone
some Town" could easily run a month,
it will be played for only a fortnight."
Local Talent to Help.
The principals, Kolb and Dill, have
taken a personal interest in putting
on special features for the football
show and at their request the Execu
tive Committee last night appointed a
committee of W. S. Wilson, J. H.
For' s, L. W. Lewis, and M T. Doo
iing to go up to one of the perform
ances this week and see where local
color can be inserted. This committee
will furnish material for the comedians
to work into the show and such a com
bination of the best in comic opera
with the best in local dramatics can
not help but produce a classic in the
way of football shows.
Tickets for the big show will go on
sale Monday morning at the Book
store and at Weingartner's in Palo
Alto. The usual.drawings for numbers
will take place at 8 o'clock and every
one will be entitled to purchase four
tickets. The reason for the limiting of
the number that each person can pur
chase to four instead of ten is to give I
the great number of alumni who have (
signified their intention of attending a
chance to get tickets.
The prices will range from $1.50 to j
~>o cents. The orchestra seats will sell j
for $1.50 and $1.00.

San Francisco dramatic critics who
says, "Every part is congenially cast,
and the Kolb and Dill chorus, a
synonym for excellence, has plenty to
do and does it well. Although "Lone
some Town" could easily run a month,
it will be played for only a fortnight."
Local Talent to Help.
The principals, Kolb and Dill, have
taken a personal interest in putting
on special features for the football
show and at their request the Execu
tive Committee last night appointed a
committee of W. S. Wilson, J. H.
For' s, L. W. Lewis, and M T. Doo
iing to go up to one of the perform
ances this week and see where local
color can be inserted. This committee
will furnish material for the comedians
to work into the show and such a com
bination of the best in comic opera
with the best in local dramatics can
not help but produce a classic in the
way of football shows.
Tickets for the big show will go on
sale Monday morning at the Book
store and at Weingartner's in Palo
Alto. The usual.drawings for numbers
will take place at 8 o'clock and every
one will be entitled to purchase four
tickets. The reason for the limiting of
the number that each person can pur
chase to four instead of ten is to give I
the great number of alumni who have (
signified their intention of attending a
chance to get tickets.
The prices will range from $1.50 to j
~>o cents. The orchestra seats will sell j
for $1.50 and $1.00.
A football show that is a real play;
one that will be enjoyed by men and
women alike, and that scintillates with
local color but at the same time has
the class and finesse to continually
draw crowds to a metropolitan theatre,
is what Stanford supporters are to be
(treated to on the night of the Big
Game.
The Rest Yet.
Stanford lias had football shows for
i years past but the production on No
! vember 9 bids fair to eclipse any pre
' vious Big Game gatherings that have
| ever been held. And it has only been
j long and repeated efforts on the part
of the Stanford management that lias
made it possible to secure such an
attraction as Kolb and Dill. Previous
football shows have usually relied for
| their success on the pep that follows
[ the winning of the game, and in the
event of a defeat have often turned out
otherwise. This year Stanford has ar
, ranged for something that in any
; event will be the equal of anything in
San Francisco but which victory will
of course greatly accentuate.
A few years ago the management of
the Savoy theater sold out then- house
I l or a football show to another insti
tution but there was so much rowdy
ism that the owners vowed then never
to let another football performance be
held there. Manager Burbank finally
persuaded them to take another chance
and promised that there would be no
rowdy tactics. This does not mean
that all frivolity is to be barred but
only such ungentlemanly conduct as
interferes with the production of the
play and the enjoyment of the evening. '
A Forking Play.
As for Kolb and Dill, almost every
one on the Pacific Coast is familiar
with their acting and they are prime j
favorites everywhere. The play "Lone
some Town," is considered the best of
their repertoire and always draws a
packed house in San Francisco when
ever it is presented. The play is a
jolly portrayal of events in the boom
city of Watts, in the southern part of
California. The droll adventures of

I Chico Charley, C. William Kolb's crea
j tion, and Bakersfield Bill, the favorite
role of Max Dill, serve to make the best
kind of entertainment and they are
ably abetted in their fun-making by
Percy Bronson in the character role of
tlie third tramp, Fresno Phil.
j The opening song, "Gee, but this is
ja Lonesome Town" is a comic classic,
and any one who does not choke with
laughter at the antics of Kolb and Dill
during the progress of the play should
consult his physician immediately.
No better testimonial for the play
can be had than that of one of the
San Francisco dramatic critics who
says, "Every part is congenially cast,
and the Kolb and Dill chorus, a
synonym for excellence, has plenty to
do and does it well. Although "Lone
some Town" could easily run a month,
it will be played for only a fortnight."
