Editor, The Daily Palo Alto:
The students and the football men
themselves ought to get over the idea
that the team must apologize at every
opportunity for the two defeats of last
week. I am firmly convinced that the
Stanford fifteen this year is the best
by far since 1908, and, win or lose
from California, that that fact can't
be contracdicted.
This idea that every defeat, every
falling off in scores must be accounted
for. is a wrong one and should stop
circulating. The football men are do
ing their best, there is lots of com
petition, and we can trust the players
on the squad to give all there is in
them.
Is there any team in the United
States that could play five im
portant games in fifteen days, two
against the Australians, and one con
test requiring a thousand miles of rail
road travelling, and still come out of
them all in top notch form? No one
could ask them to and the wonder is
they have done as well as they have.
The Olympic game tomorrow is be
ing looked for to see the team "show
up" again. That is a poor attitude.
The men will do their best, regardless
of' winning or losing, and that game
has nothing to do with our confidence
in the team.
As to beating California: if the men
are rested and understand that the stu
dents are their admirers in victory or
defeat. I believe they will go into the
game and show the ability they actu
ally have this year and return the Blue
and Cold a poor second.
