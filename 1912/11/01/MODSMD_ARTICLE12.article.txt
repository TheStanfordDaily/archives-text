# JUNIORS ISSUE POSTERS RIDICULING THEMSELVES.
## Capture Bogus Senior Handbills-Scatter Them Over Campus While Students Laugh. 
### 
The Seniors scored a home thrust
011 the 1914 class this afternoon, when
a decoy poster framed by the fourth
year men was captured by the Juniors,
printed on handbills, and thrown
broadcast around the campus. Mean
while the ink on the "comeback" poster
had been drying for two days, and they
will be put down during the coming
hours of darkness.

The coui) d'etat was cleverly ar
ranged. A prominent Senior allowed
the fact to escape over the telephone
that he had their poster in his posses
sion. The chairman of the Junior Plug
Ugly Committee organized a party and
waylaid the Senior. Securing posses
sion of the bogus poster they hurried
to a nearby printery and struck off
copies on flaring yellow sheets, which
they proceeded to scatter over the
campus. And thereupon the whole
University began to laugh. The Juni
ors had gotten out a poster upon
themselves.
