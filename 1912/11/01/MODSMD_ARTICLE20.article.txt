# "AWAKENING CONSCIENCE CRIES OUT AGAINST WAR."
## Dr. Myers Delivers Strong Lecture to Students in Chapel This Morning. 
### 
In a scholarly address, Dr. Phillip
Van Ness Myers arrainged war this
morning in the Chapel. The noted,
historian took as his topic "Intra and
International Peace." Dr. Myers saw
an end to war within a short time,
historically speaking, through the
gradual awakening of an international
conscience which is already leading to
an insistent demand for an end to war
between civilized nations.
"We must look to an end to war
through the awakening of the new
conscience and not through more
Dreadnaughts," said the speaker.
"Savage nations apply the command
ment "Thou shalt not kill," to their
kinsmen, but no further. They have
their double system of morality, and
we, too, have ours. We differ from the
savages in that we apply it only occa
sionally; then we rob and steal just
like savages.
"Christianity at first, condemned war
but by the fourth century it condoned
the pagan system of warfare. This has
made warfare a recognized part of
Christian civilization and it has re
acted with telling effect upon every
day life. A business man drives
another to the wall, using the excuse
that a state of war exists. The suffra
gettes of England justify their activi
ties by saying that they are waging
war. As long as nations seek justice
through warfare, individuals will seek
justice through violence. Men will no
longer fight when we awake con
science."
