# FOOTBALL SHOW TICKETS PLACED ON SALE MONDAY
## 
### 
Promptly at 8 o'clock Monday morn
ing, numbers will be drawn for ticketb
to the football show. The tickets will
not be ulloted in blocks as was the j
case with the Big Game sale, hut each
purchaser can select his seats from
any place in the house.
Alumni letters have been flooding j
Graduate Manager Burbank's office
asking for seats for the big show and
so great has become the demand that
! it was necessary to limit the number
j each student may buy to four instead
j of the customary ten. â™¦
It was originally announced that |
I only two-thirds of the seats would be;
placed on sale here and the remainder
would he reserved for the alumni in
San Francisco, but with the necessary
reduction in the number to be pui
chased it was decided to place them
all on sale here to give the student
body the choice of the entire house j
until Wednesday, when the remaining
seats will be placed on sale in San
Francisco.
The management is especially anxi
ous that the women of the University
patronize the performance. Many of
the women members of the alumni
have signified their intention of at
tending the play and it is hoped that

a large representation will be secured
from the campus. No rowdy tactics
will be tolerated and everyone who
enjoys an evening of good fun will
find it at the Savoy. Two boxes have
been reserved for the team, and the
yell-leaders will have charge of the
rooter's stunts for the evening.
These stunts will not interfere with
the performance of the play in any
way. There lias been no section re
served for the rooters and it is hoped
in this way to bring everybody, alum
ni, faculty, rooters, and co-eds, to
gether in a real informal Stanford
gathering after the game that will
long be remembered.
Kolb and Dill are fun-makers of the
first degree and they promise the best
they have for the football show. The
local committee is to attend one of
the performances the first of the week
and wherever it is possible to insert
local color it will be done. Given the
hunch, there are no equals of the two
Germans when it conies to putting
over something clever.
The price of the seats, as has been
announced, will be $2.00 for Box Seats;
$1.50 and $1.00 for the Orchestra;
First Balcony, $1.00; Second Balcony,
$.75 and $50.
