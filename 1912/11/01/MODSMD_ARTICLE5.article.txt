# LANE MEDICAL LIBRARY READY FOR DEDICATION
## Addition to Stanford University Ranks High Among .Medical Schools of This Country. 
### 
Lane Medical Library, one of the I
most notable additions to the equip- !
ment of the University for instruction
in the profession of medicine, will be I
dedicated Sunday afternoon, at 2:30.
The building is located at the cor
ner of Sacramento and Webster streets j
in San Francisco, and was erected at
a cost of $125,000, the funds for which
I were provided by the will of the late
j Doctor Levi Cooper Lane, who left
jhis entire estate for this purpose, but
jby the laws of this state, which per
! Mit but one-third of an e'state to be
given to charities, only the amount
named could be used for the purpose.
Doctor Lane was a surgeon deenly
interested in the medical profession
and founded the Cooper Medical Col
lege, which has since become a de- (
partment of Stanford University.
The library is now a division of
the University library. It has a ca
pacity of 100,000 volumes, and at j
present 53,000 volumes arc ready for ,
its shelves. Doctor Emmet Rixford,
a professor in the department and for- j
merly librarian, has materially aided
jin building up the library. Charles G. :
I Lathrop, treasurer of the University,
has aided in the collection of books!
! for the library with a gift of $rÂ»,000. ,
Miss Frances James is the present!
librarian, and will be assisted by a!
! number of workers.
The reading room will sent about j
j sixty students, with ample facilities!
for student work. The upper floors j
of the building are as yet unfinished,
i but will be used by social organiza
tions and medical societies.
The library is undoubtedly the best j
west of New York, giving way in
superiority in the United States only
to those at Harvard, Johns Hopkins,
Columbia, and possibly Cornell.
The principal address of the open
ing exercises will be delivered by
President David Starr Jordan, on "The
Place of the Medical School."
