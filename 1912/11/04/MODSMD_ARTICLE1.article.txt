# LEAVING SLUMP BEHIND VARSITY TAKES MATCH
## 19-0 SPELLS DOWNFALL OF THE OLYMPICS. Nearly All Possibilities For Big Game Lineup Are Put in by Coach Presley. 
### 
Stanford was returned the winner:
Saturday afternoon over the Olympic
Club by the score of 19-0.
The match was essentially a fight
of forwards. The Stanford backs did
not luive an "on"day, and good indi
vidual bits of work were frustrated by
lack of team play. The showing of
the forwards on the whole was ex
cellent. Many times one of them
broke away with the ball at his feet
or following hard after it. Even at
that, opportunity knocked at their
door not once but many times and
they heeded it not. Schaupp was the

headliner among
the scrum men. He
was faster than
ever before, follow
ed the ball well,
and made himself
invaluable in line
out work. The ex
change of i>l aces
between Schaupp
and Partridge has
proved a "happy
hunch" on the part
of Coach Presley.
Another forward
who was always
found in the com
pany of the sphere
was Hall; but un
fortunately he was
at times out of luck

on his tackles. Partridge played in
his usual form, which is compliment
enough. The striking improvement,
of Smith during the season was evi
denced Saturday. Playing opposite
the reliable Gard, Darsie made a won
derful bid for favor. His style of play
was a thorn in the side of the Olym
pics, particularly as he contrived to
break away from the scrum more
quickly than has been his wont. Re
placing Gard in the last few moments
Clover fulfilled all the requirements
for admission to Stanford's club of
stellar breakaways.
Among the backs Risling and Erb
were the medal winners of the day.
The former was formidable on both
defence and offense. Erb responded
to many encores with his popular act
