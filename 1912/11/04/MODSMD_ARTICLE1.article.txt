# LEAVING SLUMP BEHIND VARSITY TAKES MATCH
## 19-0 SPELLS DOWNFALL OF THE OLYMPICS. Nearly All Possibilities For Big Game Lineup Are Put in by Coach Presley. 
### 
Stanford was returned the winner:
Saturday afternoon over the Olympic
Club by the score of 19-0.
The match was essentially a fight
of forwards. The Stanford backs did
not luive an "on"day, and good indi
vidual bits of work were frustrated by
lack of team play. The showing of
the forwards on the whole was ex
cellent. Many times one of them
broke away with the ball at his feet
or following hard after it. Even at
that, opportunity knocked at their
door not once but many times and
they heeded it not. Schaupp was the

headliner among
the scrum men. He
was faster than
ever before, follow
ed the ball well,
and made himself
invaluable in line
out work. The ex
change of i>l aces
between Schaupp
and Partridge has
proved a "happy
hunch" on the part
of Coach Presley.
Another forward
who was always
found in the com
pany of the sphere
was Hall; but un
fortunately he was
at times out of luck

on his tackles. Partridge played in
his usual form, which is compliment
enough. The striking improvement,
of Smith during the season was evi
denced Saturday. Playing opposite
the reliable Gard, Darsie made a won
derful bid for favor. His style of play
was a thorn in the side of the Olym
pics, particularly as he contrived to
break away from the scrum more
quickly than has been his wont. Re
placing Gard in the last few moments
Clover fulfilled all the requirements
for admission to Stanford's club of
stellar breakaways.
Among the backs Risling and Erb
were the medal winners of the day.
The former was formidable on both
defence and offense. Erb responded
to many encores with his popular act

of getting off a touch hoot while hard
pressed by opponents.
The Olympics worked well in
streaks; hut would have profited by an
infusion of ginger. Peters, Sundell,
Arrell, Miller, and Haley were past
and present Stanfordites to wear the
winged emblem of the clubmen.

The Game.
Erb kicked off, and the rush that
followed sent the ball across the side
line at the Olympic 25. A moment
later, a free kick gave Erb a chance
for a field goal, but the attempt tailed
by a narrow margin. Booting into the
hands of the fullback cost the Varsity
ground 011 a number of occasions and
play was finally in Stanford territory.
Darsie and Card exchanged sides at
' breakaway.
A free kick, some good punting, and
a strenuous rush carried play to the
Stanford 5, where Thoburn and Erb
in turn relieved the pressure by kick
ing to touch at 30. From the 35, the
Cardinal forwards started the ball
goalward, and a passing rush, Darsie-
Schaupp-Sanborn-Schaupp-Smith, sent
Smith across for a try. Erb failed
to convert. Score, 3-0.
Erb starred within the minute in
dodging, going through the entire
pack and passing to Harrigan, who
went out at the 25. After a punting
duel, Stanford was given a free kick
on the Olympic 20 and Erb added three
points to the Stanford score by boot
ing between the uprights. Score,

kickoff. Smith scoring from a ruck at
5. Cass failed to convert. Score, 9-0.

directly responsible for (he next try,
taking a short kick at center, going I
through (he pack, booting over the i
heads of the Olympic backs into the 1
hands of Schaupp who was following ;
up, and backing up the latter as he I
shot over the line. Cass converted the I

Third Varsity vs. Belmont.
The preliminary contest, in which
the Third Varsity opposed Belmont,
was a listless exhibition of rugby.

The feature of the forty minutes of
play was the work of Dunn, liei
mont's speedy second five. This fast
and clever player scored twice for the
military school, making in each case
a long run through a scattered field
to the goal line. He was well second
ed by Finley, who made an equally
startling run for a try, by Lane, aim
by Hulbert.
Stanford scored the first try of thb
day, Dutton going across from a five
yard scrum. Cass failed to convert.
Play zigzagged through the center line
for a long period, when Dunn brokt,

minute's play in the second half to
again get in a score. Lane converted.
Stanford proceeded to threaten the
Belmont line,but could not pass the
threatening stage.

run, but Lane failed to convert. The
third team took a lease of life, and a
passing rush sent Dingley over. Cass
converted and the final score stood

Stanford was returned the winner:
Saturday afternoon over the Olympic
Club by the score of 19-0.
The match was essentially a fight
of forwards. The Stanford backs did
not luive an "on"day, and good indi
vidual bits of work were frustrated by
lack of team play. The showing of
the forwards on the whole was ex
cellent. Many times one of them
broke away with the ball at his feet
or following hard after it. Even at
that, opportunity knocked at their
door not once but many times and
they heeded it not. Schaupp was the

headliner among
the scrum men. He
was faster than
ever before, follow
ed the ball well,
and made himself
invaluable in line
out work. The ex
change of i>l aces
between Schaupp
and Partridge has
proved a "happy
hunch" on the part
of Coach Presley.
Another forward
who was always
found in the com
pany of the sphere
was Hall; but un
fortunately he was
at times out of luck

on his tackles. Partridge played in
his usual form, which is compliment
enough. The striking improvement,
of Smith during the season was evi
denced Saturday. Playing opposite
the reliable Gard, Darsie made a won
derful bid for favor. His style of play
was a thorn in the side of the Olym
pics, particularly as he contrived to
break away from the scrum more
quickly than has been his wont. Re
placing Gard in the last few moments
Clover fulfilled all the requirements
for admission to Stanford's club of
stellar breakaways.
Among the backs Risling and Erb
were the medal winners of the day.
The former was formidable on both
defence and offense. Erb responded
to many encores with his popular act

of getting off a touch hoot while hard
pressed by opponents.
The Olympics worked well in
streaks; hut would have profited by an
infusion of ginger. Peters, Sundell,
Arrell, Miller, and Haley were past
and present Stanfordites to wear the
winged emblem of the clubmen.

The Game.
Erb kicked off, and the rush that

play was finally in Stanford territory.
Darsie and Card exchanged sides at

A free kick, some good punting, and
a strenuous rush carried play to the

Third Varsity vs. Belmont.
The preliminary contest, in which
the Third Varsity opposed Belmont,
was a listless exhibition of rugby.

and clever player scored twice for the

Third Varsity vs. Belmont.
The preliminary contest, in which
the Third Varsity opposed Belmont,
was a listless exhibition of rugby.

The feature of the forty minutes of
play was the work of Dunn, liei
mont's speedy second five. This fast
and clever player scored twice for the
military school, making in each case
a long run through a scattered field
to the goal line. He was well second
ed by Finley, who made an equally
startling run for a try, by Lane, aim
by Hulbert.
Stanford scored the first try of thb
day, Dutton going across from a five
yard scrum. Cass failed to convert.
Play zigzagged through the center line
for a long period, when Dunn brokt,
away and sprinted to the Cardinal
line. Lane failed to convert and the
score stood 3-3.
Dunn did not require more than a
minute's play in the second half to
again get in a score. Lane converted.
Stanford proceeded to threaten the
Belmont line,but could not pass the
threatening stage.
i Finley scored for Belmont by a long
run, but Lane failed to convert. The
third team took a lease of life, and a
passing rush sent Dingley over. Cass
converted and the final score stood
Helmont 11, Stanford S.

Stanford was returned the winner:
Saturday afternoon over the Olympic
Club by the score of 19-0.
The match was essentially a fight
of forwards. The Stanford backs did
not luive an "on"day, and good indi
vidual bits of work were frustrated by
lack of team play. The showing of
the forwards on the whole was ex
cellent. Many times one of them
broke away with the ball at his feet
or following hard after it. Even at
that, opportunity knocked at their
door not once but many times and
they heeded it not. Schaupp was the

headliner among
the scrum men. He
was faster than
ever before, follow
ed the ball well,
and made himself
invaluable in line
out work. The ex
change of i>l aces
between Schaupp
and Partridge has
proved a "happy
hunch" on the part
of Coach Presley.
Another forward
who was always
found in the com
pany of the sphere
was Hall; but un
fortunately he was
at times out of luck

on his tackles. Partridge played in
his usual form, which is compliment
enough. The striking improvement,
of Smith during the season was evi
denced Saturday. Playing opposite
the reliable Gard, Darsie made a won
derful bid for favor. His style of play
was a thorn in the side of the Olym
pics, particularly as he contrived to
break away from the scrum more
quickly than has been his wont. Re
placing Gard in the last few moments
Clover fulfilled all the requirements
for admission to Stanford's club of
stellar breakaways.
Among the backs Risling and Erb
were the medal winners of the day.
The former was formidable on both
defence and offense. Erb responded
to many encores with his popular act

of getting off a touch hoot while hard
pressed by opponents.
The Olympics worked well in
streaks; hut would have profited by an
infusion of ginger. Peters, Sundell,
Arrell, Miller, and Haley were past
and present Stanfordites to wear the
winged emblem of the clubmen.

The Game.
Erb kicked off, and the rush that
followed sent the ball across the side
line at the Olympic 25. A moment
later, a free kick gave Erb a chance
for a field goal, but the attempt tailed
by a narrow margin. Booting into the
hands of the fullback cost the Varsity
ground 011 a number of occasions and
play was finally in Stanford territory.
Darsie and Card exchanged sides at
' breakaway.
A free kick, some good punting, and
a strenuous rush carried play to the
Stanford 5, where Thoburn and Erb
in turn relieved the pressure by kick
ing to touch at 30. From the 35, the
Cardinal forwards started the ball
goalward, and a passing rush, Darsie-
Schaupp-Sanborn-Schaupp-Smith, sent
Smith across for a try. Erb failed
to convert. Score, 3-0.
Erb starred within the minute in
dodging, going through the entire
pack and passing to Harrigan, who
went out at the 25. After a punting
duel, Stanford was given a free kick
on the Olympic 20 and Erb added three
points to the Stanford score by boot
ing between the uprights. Score,

The second try came soon after the
kickoff. Smith scoring from a ruck at

for Thoburn, Sinclair for Hall, Lull ;
