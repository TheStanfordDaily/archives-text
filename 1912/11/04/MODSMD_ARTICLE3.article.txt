# BOOST THE CLUBHOUSES IN TOMORROW'S RALLY
## 
### 
When the first notes of the cornet
in the Stanford band blare forth on
ihe placade before the Library tomor
row night, the evacuation of Roble, the
Row and the Hall and the packing of
the Assembly Hall will begin.
The Assembly hall doors will be
thrown open promptly at 7 o'clock
and the seating arrangement absolute
ly will be first come, first choice.
Giant placards will indicate the sec
tions of the several political parties.
For a very short time, the front tiers
of the rooting sections will be held for
students in order that outside persons
may not break the cheering by crowd
ing into the front seats early.
Telegraph linemen were on the cam
pus early this morning, making the
preliminary arrangements to connect
he Assembly Hall with the great
Hearst system of newsgathering wires.
By tomorrow noon, the Assembly Hall
will be in instantaneous communica
tion with the bulletin-massing centers
of the East and Middle West. Simul

taneously with the oflice of the San
Francisco Examiner, the very first 1
bulletin of the Ilearst service will be
flashed into the Assembly Hall.
From present indications the Stan
ford Union and Woman's Clubhouse
each should derive a substantial sum
from the receipts of the seat sale.
From the time the benefit rally wa*.
announced, it was evident that the en
tire student body would be in the
Assembly Hall on election night to
lend their support to the twin club
house projects.
Owing to the fact that tomorrow is
a holiday, the Bookstore will be closed.
The tickets placed at the Bookstore
for the rally will be on sale tomorrow
all day at the Registrar's Office at 25
cents. In Palo Alto seats may be pro
cured either at Weingartner's or the
University drug store.
At hour intervals bulletins will be
flashed giving the election returns in
Santa Clara county. This service will
be furnished by the San .Tose Mercury.
