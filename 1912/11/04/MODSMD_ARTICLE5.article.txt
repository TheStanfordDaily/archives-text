# ALL PARQUET SEATS SOLD FOR SAVOY FOOTBALL SHOW
## 
### 
At noon today, practically the entire
ower floor had been disposed of for
lie football show. There are, how
< ,er, plenty of good seats left in the
alconies and also a number of the
$.100 seats in the Parquet for the
performance of "Lonesome Town."
Only one day remains in which
campus people can purchase tickets
or the show as all the tickets will be
aken to San Francisco Wednesday
ight. Tomorrow being election day
I either the Bookstore nor Weingart
er's will he open and anyone who
las not yet secured liis tickets will
ave to get. them on Wednesday before
i o'clock. Thursday morning all the
eats that remain unsold will be
laced on sale at Tom Dillon's in San
Francisco. This has been done for tha

benefit of the alumni, a great number
of whom are anxious to attend the
show. The management has given the
undergraduates the first chance at the
seats and any rooters or co-eds who
fail to get seats can blame no one but
themselves.
Although a great part of the main
floor has been disposed of, there need
be no fear about taking balcony seats.
The Savoy theater is not a large audi
torium and it is excellently arranged
so that every seat gives a commanding
view of the stage.
Saturday morning the tickets, if
there are any left, will be removed to
the box office of the theater and any
of the tardy ones who have not se-
cured seats may be able to get them
there.
