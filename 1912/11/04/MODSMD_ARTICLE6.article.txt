## CARDINAL TEAM VICTORIOUS OVER BLUE AND GOLD. A.F. Coyle, '15, A.H. Morosco, '16, and P.D. Nowell, '13, Offer Strong Array of Winning Facts. 
### 
Stanford won the twentieth inter
collegiate debate with California in
Harmon Gymnasium at Berkeley,
Friday evening, after what was de
clared by many of the 2000 auditors
present to be one of the most brilliant
exhibitions of oratorical ability that
has ever been offered from a Stanford-
California platform.
After the last arguments had been
made in rebuttal, the three judges
reached a quick verdict, and O. K.
Cushing announced that the Cardinal
team's opposition to the establish
ment of "a series of endowed, non
partisan general newspapers" by the
people of California, was upheld. The
Stanford team, concise and logical in
the construction of its destructive
argument, and capable of repartee in
rebuttal that had the red meat of
acute reasoning, had ground the
points that weeks of study have dis
closed into the rejective minds of the
assembly of hostile, cheering sup
porters of the California team.
A. P. Coyle, '15, A. H. Morosco, '16,

consisting of A. W. Drury, '14, V. F.

debates of the Cardinal men, whose
remarks came as timely "come-backs, *â€¢
though they had been definitely learn
ed before the opening of the debate.
Drury, the first speaker for Califor
nia, pictured the evils of the modern
metropolitan press in the forms of
sensationalism and commercialism,
leading up to the declaration that
remedy was to he found in the en
dowed, non-partisan newspaper.
The first speaker sent on the plat
form by Stanford, A. F. Coyle, '15.
admitted the existence of the news
paper evils flaunted by his opponent,
and said that they were being over
come by popular demand. He stated
that "The people get no bettter, or
worse paper than they want, and at
present the public is demanding a
different type of news medium."
In the second speech for the affirma
tive, Collins held the point that parti
sanship in the newspapers of today is
detrimental to good government.
Stanford's second speaker, A. 11.
Morosco, '16, admitted in beginning
that the endowed paper proposed by
the affirmative would accomplish
