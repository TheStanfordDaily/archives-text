# STANFORD DEBATERS WIN ON CALIFORNIA PLATFORM
## CARDINAL TEAM VICTORIOUS OVER BLUE AND GOLD. A.F. Coyle, '15, A.H. Morosco, '16, and P.D. Nowell, '13, Offer Strong Array of Winning Facts. 
### 
Stanford won the twentieth inter
collegiate debate with California in
Harmon Gymnasium at Berkeley,
Friday evening, after what was de
clared by many of the 2000 auditors
present to be one of the most brilliant
exhibitions of oratorical ability that
has ever been offered from a Stanford-
California platform.
After the last arguments had been
made in rebuttal, the three judges
reached a quick verdict, and O. K.
Cushing announced that the Cardinal
team's opposition to the establish
ment of "a series of endowed, non
partisan general newspapers" by the
people of California, was upheld. The
Stanford team, concise and logical in
the construction of its destructive
argument, and capable of repartee in
rebuttal that had the red meat of
acute reasoning, had ground the
points that weeks of study have dis
closed into the rejective minds of the
assembly of hostile, cheering sup
porters of the California team.
A. P. Coyle, '15, A. H. Morosco, '16,
and P. 1). Nowell, '13, the members ot
the Stanford team, shared honors
which were widely declared to be
well balanced. The California team,
consisting of A. W. Drury, '14, V. F.
Collins, '13, and L. E. Goodman, '13,
presented arguments for the affirma
tive which were patterned by chance
to form almost perfect ground for the
debates of the Cardinal men, whose
remarks came as timely "come-backs, *•
though they had been definitely learn
ed before the opening of the debate.
Drury, the first speaker for Califor
nia, pictured the evils of the modern
metropolitan press in the forms of
sensationalism and commercialism,
leading up to the declaration that
remedy was to he found in the en
dowed, non-partisan newspaper.
The first speaker sent on the plat
form by Stanford, A. F. Coyle, '15.
admitted the existence of the news
paper evils flaunted by his opponent,
and said that they were being over
come by popular demand. He stated
that "The people get no bettter, or
worse paper than they want, and at
present the public is demanding a
different type of news medium."
In the second speech for the affirma
tive, Collins held the point that parti
sanship in the newspapers of today is
detrimental to good government.
Stanford's second speaker, A. 11.
Morosco, '16, admitted in beginning
that the endowed paper proposed by
the affirmative would accomplish
tilings desired of it, and would drive
the metropolitan press out of circula
tion, since the state paper would have
to be given away in order to reach
all classes of society, and would ab
sorb all advertisements from its com
petitor. The result, he said, would
be :i state monopoly. He said effective
ly that "The present day partisan
paper can indulge in political muck
raking that cleans," bringing out a
point that was not attacked with suc
cess by the opposition.
Goodman, the last California
speaker, outlined a plan for the work
of the proposed press, allowing $100,-
000 to be a sullicient outlay for the
plant of the series of papers.
Rejecting squarely the points
brought out by his opponent, P. D.
Nowell, '13, presented a series of
figures obtained from the business
managers of many San Francisco
dailies, which showed that the sum
named for the establishment of the
endowed press was inadequate. In
conclusion Nowell said "According to
the proposition, the state is going to
establish a paper that it can't sell,
and that it can't give away."
The rebuttals offered an opportunity
for keen retorts in the five minutes
allowed each speaker, and the period
was rich in repartee. The system,
tried for the first time Friday, of
allowing live minutes for rebuttal was
considered very successful.
The clever work of A. W. Drury, '14,
of California, was much like that of
bis brother, X. H Drury, who opposed
Stanford in the intercollegiate debate
for four years. The work of L E.
Goodman, '13, was effective and clever,
and V. F. Collins, '13, presented a
logical debate.
Professor C. M. Gayly, of the Eng
lish department of the University of
California, presided at. the debate.
The judges were O. K. Gushing, Judge
Murasky, and J. W. Lilienthal.

reached a quick verdict, and O. K.
Cushing announced that the Cardinal
team's opposition to the establish
ment of "a series of endowed, non
partisan general newspapers" by the
people of California, was upheld. The
Stanford team, concise and logical in
the construction of its destructive
argument, and capable of repartee in
rebuttal that had the red meat of
acute reasoning, had ground the
points that weeks of study have dis
closed into the rejective minds of the
assembly of hostile, cheering sup
porters of the California team.
A. P. Coyle, '15, A. H. Morosco, '16,
and P. 1). Nowell, '13, the members ot
the Stanford team, shared honors
which were widely declared to be
well balanced. The California team,
consisting of A. W. Drury, '14, V. F.
Collins, '13, and L. E. Goodman, '13,
presented arguments for the affirma
tive which were patterned by chance
to form almost perfect ground for the
debates of the Cardinal men, whose
remarks came as timely "come-backs, *•
though they had been definitely learn
ed before the opening of the debate.
Drury, the first speaker for Califor
nia, pictured the evils of the modern
metropolitan press in the forms of
sensationalism and commercialism,
leading up to the declaration that
remedy was to he found in the en
dowed, non-partisan newspaper.
The first speaker sent on the plat
form by Stanford, A. F. Coyle, '15.
admitted the existence of the news
paper evils flaunted by his opponent,
and said that they were being over
come by popular demand. He stated
that "The people get no bettter, or
worse paper than they want, and at
present the public is demanding a
different type of news medium."
In the second speech for the affirma
tive, Collins held the point that parti
sanship in the newspapers of today is
detrimental to good government.
Stanford's second speaker, A. 11.
Morosco, '16, admitted in beginning
that the endowed paper proposed by
the affirmative would accomplish
tilings desired of it, and would drive
the metropolitan press out of circula
tion, since the state paper would have
to be given away in order to reach
all classes of society, and would ab
sorb all advertisements from its com
petitor. The result, he said, would
be :i state monopoly. He said effective
ly that "The present day partisan
paper can indulge in political muck
raking that cleans," bringing out a
point that was not attacked with suc
cess by the opposition.
Goodman, the last California
speaker, outlined a plan for the work
of the proposed press, allowing $100,-
000 to be a sullicient outlay for the
plant of the series of papers.
Rejecting squarely the points
brought out by his opponent, P. D.
Nowell, '13, presented a series of
figures obtained from the business
managers of many San Francisco
dailies, which showed that the sum
named for the establishment of the
endowed press was inadequate. In
conclusion Nowell said "According to
the proposition, the state is going to
establish a paper that it can't sell,
and that it can't give away."
The rebuttals offered an opportunity
for keen retorts in the five minutes
allowed each speaker, and the period
was rich in repartee. The system,
tried for the first time Friday, of
allowing live minutes for rebuttal was
considered very successful.
The clever work of A. W. Drury, '14,
of California, was much like that of
bis brother, X. H Drury, who opposed
Stanford in the intercollegiate debate
for four years. The work of L E.
Goodman, '13, was effective and clever,
and V. F. Collins, '13, presented a
logical debate.
Professor C. M. Gayly, of the Eng
lish department of the University of
California, presided at. the debate.
The judges were O. K. Gushing, Judge
Murasky, and J. W. Lilienthal.
