# The
						First Victory!
## 
### 
It gives us great pleasure to be able
to compliment the Stanford debating
trio upon their well-earned victory

over California last Fri
day evening. For four
consecutive years the Blue
and Gold orators have

taken the honors. This year three
Cardinal novices to the intercollegiate
platform not only won from a team 011
which two of their three opponents
were veterans of former intercollegiate
debates but scored their points on the
stage of the California gymnasium.
Debaters you have started the year
well. Now for a year of Stanford
victories.
As tomorrow is a general Univer
sity holiday, the next edition of the
Daily Palo Alto Will be* issued 011
Wednesday.
