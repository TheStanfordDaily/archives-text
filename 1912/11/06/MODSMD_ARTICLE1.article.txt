"Training," is the caption that ap
pears over an article by Trainer H. W.
Maloney, dealing with the condition
of Stanford's ruggers, who work 011
the turf and gather around the train
ing table to fit themselves for a win
ning fight 011 November 9. Maloney
attributes the slump of the Stanford
team in its games with Santa Clara
and the Barbarians after the Austra
lian games, to natural over-exertion
demanded by a struggle with men of
greater fullness of physique.
Assuming a delightful light essay
style, L. M. Robinson, '12, has penned
a "Protest." The moralist assumes at
the outset that those of the campus
community, often classed as "high
brow," whose taste in literary things
takes a great width of artistic cloth,
give too little thought to personal
adornment. He proceeds to assail the
incongruous make-up of the worship
pers at the shrine of the Muses.
W. F. Kilcline, '15, uses several
pages of well-written paragraphs to
trace the growth of the game of foot
ball. from its first known existence,
in a rude form, in Siarn, to the highly
developed Rugby game which develop
ed during the middle of the 19th cen
tury in Tom Brown's school.
"On the Pescadero Road," by .T. C.
Thomas, '12, and "Bill Crockett En
tertains," by E. H. Ford, '14, appear
as very readable fiction. Thomas
succeeds in casting a glamour of un
real realism about the character in
his story. Ford tells the adventure of
a second story worker in the capacity
of nurse to a wailing infant, and
works up an idea that is not too
original, in an interesting way.
"Ignorance," a poem by J. L. Duff,
â–  Ithat ranks well with the best that
have recently appeared in the Sequoia,
tells of the havoc worked through
the ages by the running mate of the
devil whose identity is disclosed in
the title.
The verse contributed by C. IT.
Wintler, '14, "Sitting in the Sunshine,"
deals well with the inevitable lack of
achievement of "sun bathers."
Editorial comment deals with the
evils of "Ticket Scalping," the pros
pects for a Cardinal victory in the
game with California, and the attitude
of California with regard to the two
referee proposition in the Big Game,
among other things.
