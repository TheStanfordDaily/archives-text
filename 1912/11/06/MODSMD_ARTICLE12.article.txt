# A 						Fair Deal.
## 
### 
In this column we give a copy of the
resolution passed this afternoon by the

Student Council. The com
plaint, calling for the resolu
tion, came from the only
moving picture house in Palo

Alto that is helping to support the
Student Body publications by adver
tising. Through the student's papers
this firm seeks the University trade,
and in response the students attempt
to break up the show. This is
not giving our advertiser a fair deal.
The existence of the student publica
tions depends upon keeping their ad
vertisers. The students must do their
part; patronize the advertisers â€”make
it worth their while.
