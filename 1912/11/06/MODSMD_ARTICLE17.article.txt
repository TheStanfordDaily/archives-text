## Dr. Jordan Writes Foreword to Story on "Western Women Through French Eyes." 
### 
President David Starr Jordan writes
a foreword to an article 011 "Western
Women Through French Eyes," which
appears in the November issue of the
Sunset Magazine. The story is written
by Baron d'Estoitrnelles de Constant,
of France, President of the Society
for International Conciliation.
In the foreword Dr. Jordan says:
"The influence of woman should be
felt in public affairs in a national way,
and in accordance with orderly stat
utes. This is a part of the natural
movement of democracy, the attitude
which we call the spirt of the West."
The baron spent a day at Stanford
when he was in the West and relate&
some of his experiences here in the
article. He approves of the idea of
co-education and revels in the scheme
of democracy which lie found pre
vading the campus. In San Francisco
be was one of the leaders for equal
suffrage. He says: "The women have
supported me, I support them in turn."
Miss Edith Mirrielees, '07, is also a
contributer to this number of the Sun
set. In "The Courting of Calla Lily"
she pictures the loveless manner of
a step-father to his wife's daughter,
and the independent attitude which
the girl exhibits before him.
Dane Coolidge,' 98, has written a
story for this issue on "Cow Boy
Songs." This material is the result
of thirteen years' comprehensive study
of the West. Coolidge has penetrated
into the remotest parts of the West,
both as a naturalist and as a photo
grapher.
