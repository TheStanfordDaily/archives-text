### 
Holbrook Blinn, ex-'95, first presi
dent of a Stanford Sophomore class
and first editor of the Weekly Palo
Alto, will speak on next Thursday at
3:30 o'clock in the Chapel 011 "The
College Student and the Stage."
Blinn's latest vehicle, in which he it.
now starring at the Cort Theatre in
San Francisco, is "A Romance of the
Underworld," Paul Armstrong's play.
Both the play itself and Mr. Blinn's
acting have created a huge sensation.
Mr. Blinn comes to Stanford under
the auspices of the English Club and
upon the invitation of Doctor Davici
Starr Jordan. His appearance here
does not constitute a meeting of the
club, and the general college public
are invited to hear him. The talk will
end before 4:15, in order to enable
those who are there to attend football
practise.
