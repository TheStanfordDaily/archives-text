# BENEFIT RALLY BRINGS SUBSTANTIAL RETURNS
## CLUBHOUSE PROJECTS DERIVE A GOODLY SUM. Great Assembly Hall Crowd Follows Election Through Hearst Leased Wire. 
### 
Bubbling over with political enthusi
asm, filteen hundred people eagerly
awaited the Election returns last night
in the Assembly Hall. Through the
courtesy of the San Francisco Ex
aminer the Stanford populace were
able to obtain full returns of the
greatest election in the present decade.
For the first time the students re
ceived full returns before the day fol
lowing the election. A full house
assured the complete success of the
undertaking. Two-thirds of the re
ceipts from the sale of tickets will go
to the Stanford Union and the remain
der toward the Women's Clubhouse.
Not a dull moment was experienced
during the entire evening. Between
acts, when the wire was dead, car
toons, prospects of Saturday's game,
pictures of rugby players and squibs
were flashed on the screen.
The Gym Club favored the audience
with numerous clever stunts. Tum
bling acts were the order of their first
appearance and pyramid and climbing
features were the entertainment af
forded the politicians in the second
scene. Their skilful work broke the
monotony of what would otherwise
have been continual election returns.
Music from the Stanford Band
echoed and re-echoed across the As
sembly Hall, adding zest and enthusi
asm to the already hilarious specta
tors. The Band also accompanied the
Gym Club performers in several of
their skits.
The audience was divided into two
sections. One side of the house was
devoted to the bull moose contingents
and the other to the Wilson sup
porters. From the time that the first
report came across the wire until F. H.
Hilton said "good-night," the followers
oi both parties kept up a continual
cheer that was only interrupted by two
intermissions. Repartee and friendl>
knocks were exchanged with an impe
tus that showed that both leaders had
many backers on the campus.
During the evening Cap and Gown
served refreshments for the benefit of
both the Stanford Union and Women's
Clubhouse. $350 was cleared from the
sale of tickets and lunches.
