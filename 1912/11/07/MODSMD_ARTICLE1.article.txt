# The
						1912 Stanford Varsity Is Announced with Eleven Rugby Veterans in its Ranks
## 
### 
Fifteen players, every one of whom
is proud of his position and every one
of whom Stanford rooters are proud
10 see in that position, have been
named to comprise the 1912 Varsity.
Eleven veterans, one Freshman, and
three men who have in past years
shown such steady rugby progress as
to warrant their selection, make up the
Cardinal fifteen.
The contested front-rank places
went to Hall, Sanborn and Corbet, who
have been conceded a slight lead
the breakaway position opposite Gard.
during the past week. Darsie takes
while the brilliant first-year rugger,
Urban, will be given opportunity to
display his scoring abilities at right
wing.
This gives Stanford a team with an
average weight of 1(54 7-8, California
having a slight lead by 1 3-8 pounds
to the man. In the forward division,
however, the Cardinal will have the
best of the argument, having an aver
age of 174 3-4 pounds to the 172 1-2
pounds of the California men. The
total weight of the Blue and Gold
scrum is 1379, while the Stanford for
wards weigh 1398 pounds. The re
markable similarity of these weight
figures is an unusual and striking fea
ture of the opposing lineups.
Of exceeding encouragement to Car
dinal supporters is the fact that the
team has 12 substitutes, any one of
whom has ability such that he can re
place his man without distinguishable"
weakening the team. The "side-line
heroes" are unusually stalwart and de- j
pendable this year, and every one of
them was a warmer contender for first |
honors.
Erb.
Benjamin Edwin Erb will send his
twisting spirals to touch from the
fullback's stand. He played on his
Freshman team and 011 the 1908 and
1910 Varsities at half. Last year lie'
was slated to preside at the right
wing three-quarters position, but as a
result of the sensational eleventh-hour
1
change which left Cass out of the line
up he went in at half. This year this
versatile player has found himself at
fullback, and a better has never been
seen in action on the Stanford turf.
He is a Geology student from Chemai- j
nus, British Columbia, and a member
of Sigma Alpha Epsilon. Victoria :
High school gave him his early train-'
ing. His height is 5 feet 9 inches; he
is 22 years of age and weighs 162

team who has seen a Stanford victory, j
and he is now numbered among the
select few who are entitled to four 1
stars.
Noble.

Noble will fill the position; and he will
surely fill the bill. Speedy, and a per

1916 team this year, and was formerly

first five on his Freshman team and the
position was his of right on the two

and substituted for the fives 011 the
Varsity. He studied rugby at Palo
Alio high, but at Stanford lie gives
Economics as his major subject. Age,
-2, height 5 feet 7 inches; weight, 144
pounds.
Cass.
Stanford's splendid skipper, Louis
Cass, will play half; and no one doubts
bin that he will play it as it should
he played. He is a halfback through
and through. Cars played wing on his
Freshman team, half 011 the 1909 Var
b'ty, substituted for ball" on the 1910
\ arsity, and last year was selected for
the first position behind the scrum, but
determined at the eleventh hour that
for the good of the team he should
remain out of the game because of
serious injuries. He is a member of
Zeta Psi. He registers in the Geology!
department from Los Angeles, where
he played football with Los Angeles
High school. He is 21, 5 feet 9, and a
150 pounder.
Partridge.
John Frederick Partridge, has been j
playing at lock for about two
weeks. Previously he was used at
middle rank, where he played last j
year and for which position he was
the logical candidate two years ago
until the god of ill luck retired him
with an injury. His height of 6 feet
3% inches gives him a splendid view
in all directions; what is more to the
point, it is an asset to him in every j
branch of the rugby sport. He is 21 j
prepared at Hitchcock, and registers j
from San Francisco in Civil Engineer
ing. This invaluable member of the
fifteen belongs to Sigma Alpha Epsi- !
lon.
(<!ard.
Frank Jacob Gard wins a breakaway j
position because he was tried at the
post on his 1914 Freshman team, 011
the Varsity last year, and throughout j
the present season, and has never been
found wanting. He is a Phi Gamma
Delta, 20 years of age, weighing 163 !
pounds, and is only kept out of the six
foot club by a quarter of an inch. He
lives in Glendora and prepared at the I
high school of that town, but his rugby j
genius was undiscovered until he came
to Stanford.
Dnrsie,
The wonderful improvement of Wil
liam Pettigrew Darsie during the sea- |

sou gives him a breakaway berth cm
this year's Varsity. He is a strong
player and gives everything he has for
the fifteen. Darsie won his spur as a
rugger by playing forward on the 1914
! Freshman team. He prepared at the
Palo Alto High school and shares in
the rugby skill of his fellowtownsmen
on the team. Darsie is 21 years of age,
5 leet 11 inches in height, and the
scales credit him with 158 pounds.
Phi Kappa Psi is his fraternity.
Smith.
Always reliable, Warren Locke
Smith is now playing better than
ever before, and at right middle rank
will merit the confidence reposed in
him by Stanford rooters. Last year
he played front rank, and the pre
ceding season substituted for the
breakaways, being the only Cardinal
sideliner to enter the fray. Ferndale
is his home, but he prepared at the
Academy of the Universty of the Paci
fic. Entomology is his major. At 193
pounds he ties with Partridge for the
distinction of being the heaviest man
on the team. He is exactly 6 feet tall
and his age is 25.
Schaupp.
Karl Ludwig Schaupp, who is best
known as "Doc," is to play at left
middle rank. Schaupp has carved his
name deep on the tablets of Stanford's
athletic history. He played on his
Freshman fifteen and last year gave
the benefit of his great weight, height,
strength, and fighting qualities at the
lock position on the Varsity. Phi Gam
ma Delta is his fraternity, and he
studies Physiology. The high school
of Santa Rosa, his home town, was
his first alma mater. An even six
footer, Schaupp weighs 185, and is 29
years old.
Hall.
Elwin Benoni Hall played at wing
on the 1914 Freshman fifteen, but
since that time he has worked with
the forwards and now finds himself
at front rank on the Varsity. He is a
hard fighter, follows the ball well, and
merits the position. Nordhoff, Cali
fornia, is his home, but he prepared
at Los Angeles High school. He is a
member of Beta Theta Pi. Hall is 21
years of age, stands 5 feet and
weighs 161.
