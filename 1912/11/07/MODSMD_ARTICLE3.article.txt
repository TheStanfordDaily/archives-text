# The 						Team...

### 
Coach George J. Presley has an
nounced a Varsity that will represent
Stanford on California Field that meets

the popular approval of
the students. His selec
tion is based upon the

entire season's showing of the players
and was made after the most careful
consideration. The result is one of the
most powerful, speedy, and well bal
anced teams that have worn the Car
dinal. It is a fifteen that we may con
fidently trust the honor of Stanford
with. Win or lose, we will have a team
that we may be proud of on the even
ing of November ninth; a team that
will show the thousands who watch the
game just what the Stanford Spirit is.
That so fine a Varsity could be
launched against California on Satur
day is due to the willing long season
grind of the members of the squad. A
victory over the Blue and Gold will
reflect largely upon them. To them
goes the satisfaction of work well
done. Too much credit cannot be
given them.
