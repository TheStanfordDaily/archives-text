# RIVAL VARSITIES READY TO CLASH
## Season's Games Show Teams Closely Matched 
### 
r l he Stanford holdover, unenviable
though his lot may be in some re
spects, has a peculiar distinction. He
is the only man now in college who
has serpentined for a Stanford rugby
victory. When rugby was adopted as
an intercollegiate sport in 1905 the
scoreboard wore a Cardinal hue for
four successive years and the laurels
seemed ours of divine right. Three
years ago the worm—if for the pur
poses of metaphor we may so term the
bloodthirsty Golden Bear —turned, and
in 15)09, 1910 and 1911 California won
the Isig Game by scores of 19-13, 2. r >-G,
21-3.
This leaves Stanford four rugby
victories to California's three, but
gives the Ulue and Gold the edge on
total points by 195 to 193. This year,
however, Senior, Junior, Sophomort
and Freshman expect to see Stanford
turn the tables and look forward to
that most enjoyable form of exercise,
a serpentine on California Field. Stan
ford has a team of balance, of scoring
and defensive ability, and. above all,
determined to win "for you fellows,
Coach Presley, and ourselves."
The 1912 season has been one of ups

and downs, and of reversals of form
which make it as interesting as it is
puzzling. .At its beginning Stanford
had a decided advantage over its
trans-bay rivals in the number of
veterans returning. Sanborn, Smith,'
Frank, Schaupp, Gard, Cass. Harrigan
Noble. Kern, Risling, Erb, Thoburn,
Reeves, Wat kins, and Partridge are all
"S" men who have been in togs
throughout the season, though Part
ridge and Watkins did not come out
until it was somewhat advanced. In
j addition, various of the near-great who
had lined the sidelines in previous
years were back with increased ability.
Referep Hill has appointed L. S.
Reading and Larry Dwyer as his touch
I judges. No men in local rugby circles
are more thoroughly versed in the
game or more keenly observing, and
neither of them are of the type to stand
for any sort of unfair play. Reading
has often refereed on the Stanford
turf. He is a strict and accomplished
official who has been identified with
the game locally for several years.
Dwyer is beyond doubt one of the most
brilliant fullbacks in the world, and is


STANFORD VARSITY SQl'Al) FOR SEASON OF IJH2
sjo thoroughly conversant with the
sport that he is undeniably the logical
man to have opposite Reading.
The figures representing the total
scores of the two rival fifteens
throughout the season are interesting
to those mathematically inclined, but
do not prove particularly illuminating.
They become most striking when
placed side by side with similar totals
for last year, as follows:
Total Scores:
1011—
Stanford 207 Opponents 18
California.... 221 " 17
1912—
Stanford 90 Opponents 44
California.... 94 " 52
These figures mean, not that the Var
sity teams are weaker than those of
last year, but that they have met in
finitely more stalwart opposition. The
Australian Blues, for example, put into
the field the strongest playing com
binations that California and Stanford
have opposed in years during the pre
liminary season.
The Cardinal played the Blues in
two matches, the scores of which were
0-6 and 13-12, giving a total of 13
points for Stanford and 18 for the
Waratahs. California played three
games with the Antipodeans, with
figures resulting as follows: 0-18,
6-5, 3-23. The concluding match was
waged against practically a second
Varsity. These games gave California
a total of 9 points as against the 46
of the Waratahs.
The Blue and Cold came through
tlie season without another defeat, but
Stanford suffered two more downfalls,
as expressed in those figures:
Stanford, 10; Santa Clara. 15.
Stanford, 0; Barbarians, 6.
Of course these losses occurred
while the Cardinal fifteen was in its
slump; but the scores of the two club
teams against the Varsities are indi
cative of the fact that the Olympics
and Barbarians are playing a far

better brand of rugby than ever before.
Here is the statistical evidence:
Stanford, 20; Barbarians, 6.
California, 32; Barbarians, 3.
Stanford, 42; Olympics, 5.
California, 19; Olympics, 3.
In the year 1907 the Barbarian Club
played almost on even terms with the
Varsities, and at the end of the sea
son had more than one win on the
credit side of its ledger. In the inter
vening years the fact that any club
team had ever beaten a Varsity became
but a dim memory, and the victory of
the Barbarians this year caused an
audible gasp of surprise throughout
the local rugby world. Every game
played by a club team against a Uni
versity fifteen this year, whether b.v
the wearers of the Winged-0 or of the
white "B," has been harder fought,
and has furnished better practice, than
has been the case for many moons.
The situation with respect to the
referee and officials of the game is
particularly encouraging this year.
William W. Hill, than whom a better
referee is not now on American soil,
will wield the whistle; and he has by
common consent chosen his own touch
judges. This statement means that
these linesmen, in whom Hill has the
utmost confidence, will be constantly
on the alert and by raising their flags
may call his attention to breaches of
the rules unobserved by him. They
will then report and he will rule on
these faults. Here is a lengthy stride
toward a clean, correctly-offlcialed
match.
Hill is a man of wide and thorough
knowledge of the game and its rules,
and moreover of a fund of never-failing
common-sense in the application and
interpretation of these rules. He lias
in Australia refereed many strenuous,
contests calling for correct decisions
upon intricate points.

in 15)09, 1910 and 1911 California won
the Isig Game by scores of 19-13, 2. r >-G,
21-3.
This leaves Stanford four rugby
victories to California's three, but
gives the Ulue and Gold the edge on
total points by 195 to 193. This year,
however, Senior, Junior, Sophomort
and Freshman expect to see Stanford
turn the tables and look forward to
that most enjoyable form of exercise,
a serpentine on California Field. Stan
ford has a team of balance, of scoring
and defensive ability, and. above all,
determined to win "for you fellows,
Coach Presley, and ourselves."
The 1912 season has been one of ups

and downs, and of reversals of form
which make it as interesting as it is
puzzling. .At its beginning Stanford
had a decided advantage over its
trans-bay rivals in the number of
veterans returning. Sanborn, Smith,'
Frank, Schaupp, Gard, Cass. Harrigan
Noble. Kern, Risling, Erb, Thoburn,
Reeves, Wat kins, and Partridge are all
"S" men who have been in togs
throughout the season, though Part
ridge and Watkins did not come out
until it was somewhat advanced. In
j addition, various of the near-great who
had lined the sidelines in previous
years were back with increased ability.
Referep Hill has appointed L. S.
Reading and Larry Dwyer as his touch
I judges. No men in local rugby circles
are more thoroughly versed in the
game or more keenly observing, and
neither of them are of the type to stand
for any sort of unfair play. Reading
has often refereed on the Stanford
turf. He is a strict and accomplished
official who has been identified with
the game locally for several years.
Dwyer is beyond doubt one of the most
brilliant fullbacks in the world, and is


STANFORD VARSITY SQl'Al) FOR SEASON OF IJH2
sjo thoroughly conversant with the
sport that he is undeniably the logical
man to have opposite Reading.
The figures representing the total
scores of the two rival fifteens
throughout the season are interesting
to those mathematically inclined, but
do not prove particularly illuminating.
They become most striking when
placed side by side with similar totals
for last year, as follows:
Total Scores:
1011—
Stanford 207 Opponents 18
California.... 221 " 17
1912—
Stanford 90 Opponents 44
California.... 94 " 52
These figures mean, not that the Var
sity teams are weaker than those of
last year, but that they have met in
finitely more stalwart opposition. The
Australian Blues, for example, put into
the field the strongest playing com
binations that California and Stanford
have opposed in years during the pre
liminary season.
The Cardinal played the Blues in
two matches, the scores of which were
0-6 and 13-12, giving a total of 13
points for Stanford and 18 for the
Waratahs. California played three
games with the Antipodeans, with
figures resulting as follows: 0-18,
6-5, 3-23. The concluding match was
waged against practically a second
Varsity. These games gave California
a total of 9 points as against the 46
of the Waratahs.
The Blue and Cold came through
tlie season without another defeat, but
Stanford suffered two more downfalls,
as expressed in those figures:
Stanford, 10; Santa Clara. 15.
Stanford, 0; Barbarians, 6.
Of course these losses occurred
while the Cardinal fifteen was in its
slump; but the scores of the two club
teams against the Varsities are indi
cative of the fact that the Olympics
and Barbarians are playing a far

better brand of rugby than ever before.
Here is the statistical evidence:
Stanford, 20; Barbarians, 6.
California, 32; Barbarians, 3.
Stanford, 42; Olympics, 5.
California, 19; Olympics, 3.
In the year 1907 the Barbarian Club
played almost on even terms with the
Varsities, and at the end of the sea
son had more than one win on the
credit side of its ledger. In the inter
vening years the fact that any club
team had ever beaten a Varsity became
but a dim memory, and the victory of
the Barbarians this year caused an
audible gasp of surprise throughout
the local rugby world. Every game
played by a club team against a Uni
versity fifteen this year, whether b.v
the wearers of the Winged-0 or of the
white "B," has been harder fought,
and has furnished better practice, than
has been the case for many moons.
The situation with respect to the
referee and officials of the game is
particularly encouraging this year.
William W. Hill, than whom a better
referee is not now on American soil,
will wield the whistle; and he has by
common consent chosen his own touch
judges. This statement means that
these linesmen, in whom Hill has the
utmost confidence, will be constantly
on the alert and by raising their flags
may call his attention to breaches of
the rules unobserved by him. They
will then report and he will rule on
these faults. Here is a lengthy stride
toward a clean, correctly-offlcialed
match.
Hill is a man of wide and thorough
knowledge of the game and its rules,
and moreover of a fund of never-failing
common-sense in the application and
interpretation of these rules. He lias
in Australia refereed many strenuous,
contests calling for correct decisions
upon intricate points.
r l he Stanford holdover, unenviable
though his lot may be in some re
spects, has a peculiar distinction. He
is the only man now in college who
has serpentined for a Stanford rugby
victory. When rugby was adopted as
an intercollegiate sport in 1905 the
scoreboard wore a Cardinal hue for
four successive years and the laurels
seemed ours of divine right. Three
years ago the worm—if for the pur
poses of metaphor we may so term the
bloodthirsty Golden Bear —turned, and
in 15)09, 1910 and 1911 California won

ford has a team of balance, of scoring
and defensive ability, and. above all,
determined to win "for you fellows,
Coach Presley, and ourselves."
The 1912 season has been one of ups

and downs, and of reversals of form
which make it as interesting as it is
puzzling. .At its beginning Stanford
had a decided advantage over its
trans-bay rivals in the number of
veterans returning. Sanborn, Smith,'
Frank, Schaupp, Gard, Cass. Harrigan
Noble. Kern, Risling, Erb, Thoburn,
Reeves, Wat kins, and Partridge are all
"S" men who have been in togs
throughout the season, though Part
ridge and Watkins did not come out
until it was somewhat advanced. In
j addition, various of the near-great who
had lined the sidelines in previous
years were back with increased ability.
Referep Hill has appointed L. S.
Reading and Larry Dwyer as his touch
I judges. No men in local rugby circles
are more thoroughly versed in the
game or more keenly observing, and
neither of them are of the type to stand
for any sort of unfair play. Reading
has often refereed on the Stanford
turf. He is a strict and accomplished
official who has been identified with
the game locally for several years.
Dwyer is beyond doubt one of the most
brilliant fullbacks in the world, and is


STANFORD VARSITY SQl'Al) FOR SEASON OF IJH2
sjo thoroughly conversant with the
sport that he is undeniably the logical
man to have opposite Reading.
The figures representing the total
scores of the two rival fifteens
throughout the season are interesting
to those mathematically inclined, but
do not prove particularly illuminating.
They become most striking when
placed side by side with similar totals
for last year, as follows:
Total Scores:
1011—
Stanford 207 Opponents 18
California.... 221 " 17
1912—
Stanford 90 Opponents 44
California.... 94 " 52
These figures mean, not that the Var
sity teams are weaker than those of
last year, but that they have met in
finitely more stalwart opposition. The
Australian Blues, for example, put into
the field the strongest playing com
binations that California and Stanford
have opposed in years during the pre
liminary season.
The Cardinal played the Blues in
two matches, the scores of which were
0-6 and 13-12, giving a total of 13
points for Stanford and 18 for the
Waratahs. California played three
games with the Antipodeans, with
figures resulting as follows: 0-18,
6-5, 3-23. The concluding match was
waged against practically a second
Varsity. These games gave California
a total of 9 points as against the 46
of the Waratahs.
The Blue and Cold came through
tlie season without another defeat, but
Stanford suffered two more downfalls,
as expressed in those figures:
Stanford, 10; Santa Clara. 15.
Stanford, 0; Barbarians, 6.
Of course these losses occurred
while the Cardinal fifteen was in its
slump; but the scores of the two club
teams against the Varsities are indi
cative of the fact that the Olympics
and Barbarians are playing a far

better brand of rugby than ever before.
Here is the statistical evidence:
Stanford, 20; Barbarians, 6.
California, 32; Barbarians, 3.
Stanford, 42; Olympics, 5.
California, 19; Olympics, 3.
In the year 1907 the Barbarian Club
played almost on even terms with the
Varsities, and at the end of the sea
son had more than one win on the
credit side of its ledger. In the inter
vening years the fact that any club
team had ever beaten a Varsity became
but a dim memory, and the victory of
the Barbarians this year caused an
audible gasp of surprise throughout
the local rugby world. Every game
played by a club team against a Uni
versity fifteen this year, whether b.v
the wearers of the Winged-0 or of the
white "B," has been harder fought,
and has furnished better practice, than
has been the case for many moons.
The situation with respect to the
referee and officials of the game is
particularly encouraging this year.
William W. Hill, than whom a better
referee is not now on American soil,
will wield the whistle; and he has by
common consent chosen his own touch
judges. This statement means that
these linesmen, in whom Hill has the
utmost confidence, will be constantly
on the alert and by raising their flags
may call his attention to breaches of
the rules unobserved by him. They
will then report and he will rule on
these faults. Here is a lengthy stride
toward a clean, correctly-offlcialed
match.
Hill is a man of wide and thorough
knowledge of the game and its rules,
and moreover of a fund of never-failing
common-sense in the application and
interpretation of these rules. He lias
in Australia refereed many strenuous,
contests calling for correct decisions
upon intricate points.
r l he Stanford holdover, unenviable
though his lot may be in some re
spects, has a peculiar distinction. He
is the only man now in college who
has serpentined for a Stanford rugby
victory. When rugby was adopted as
an intercollegiate sport in 1905 the
scoreboard wore a Cardinal hue for
four successive years and the laurels
seemed ours of divine right. Three
years ago the worm—if for the pur
poses of metaphor we may so term the
bloodthirsty Golden Bear —turned, and
in 15)09, 1910 and 1911 California won
the Isig Game by scores of 19-13, 2. r >-G,
21-3.
This leaves Stanford four rugby
victories to California's three, but
gives the Ulue and Gold the edge on
total points by 195 to 193. This year,
however, Senior, Junior, Sophomort
and Freshman expect to see Stanford
turn the tables and look forward to
that most enjoyable form of exercise,
a serpentine on California Field. Stan
ford has a team of balance, of scoring
and defensive ability, and. above all,
determined to win "for you fellows,
Coach Presley, and ourselves."
