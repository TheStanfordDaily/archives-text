r l he Stanford holdover, unenviable
though his lot may be in some re
spects, has a peculiar distinction. He
is the only man now in college who
has serpentined for a Stanford rugby
victory. When rugby was adopted as
an intercollegiate sport in 1905 the
scoreboard wore a Cardinal hue for
four successive years and the laurels
seemed ours of divine right. Three
years ago the worm—if for the pur
poses of metaphor we may so term the
bloodthirsty Golden Bear —turned, and
in 15)09, 1910 and 1911 California won
the Isig Game by scores of 19-13, 2. r >-G,
21-3.
This leaves Stanford four rugby
victories to California's three, but
gives the Ulue and Gold the edge on
total points by 195 to 193. This year,
however, Senior, Junior, Sophomort
and Freshman expect to see Stanford
turn the tables and look forward to
that most enjoyable form of exercise,
a serpentine on California Field. Stan
ford has a team of balance, of scoring
and defensive ability, and. above all,
determined to win "for you fellows,
Coach Presley, and ourselves."
The 1912 season has been one of ups

and downs, and of reversals of form
which make it as interesting as it is
puzzling. .At its beginning Stanford
had a decided advantage over its
trans-bay rivals in the number of
veterans returning. Sanborn, Smith,'
Frank, Schaupp, Gard, Cass. Harrigan
Noble. Kern, Risling, Erb, Thoburn,
Reeves, Wat kins, and Partridge are all
"S" men who have been in togs
throughout the season, though Part
ridge and Watkins did not come out
until it was somewhat advanced. In
j addition, various of the near-great who
had lined the sidelines in previous
years were back with increased ability.
Referep Hill has appointed L. S.
Reading and Larry Dwyer as his touch
I judges. No men in local rugby circles
are more thoroughly versed in the
game or more keenly observing, and
neither of them are of the type to stand
for any sort of unfair play. Reading
has often refereed on the Stanford
turf. He is a strict and accomplished
official who has been identified with
the game locally for several years.
Dwyer is beyond doubt one of the most
brilliant fullbacks in the world, and is
