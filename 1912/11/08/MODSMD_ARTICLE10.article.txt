## General Invitation Extended to all Graduates and Undergraduates by Association. 
### 
The San Francisco Press Club is
preparing to entertain a large assent
blage of Stanford alumni and under
graduates in the smoker reunion to
morrow night.
The Alumni Association will he the
hosts for the evening and a special
alumni committee has prepared a live
ly program of entertainment for the
visitors.
No formal banquet will he served,
but the committee has provided an
abundance of smokes and refresh
ments. The gathering will be an en
tirely informal reunion, and from the
history of past alumni smokers, the
undergraduates and alumni may be de
pended on to keep things moving all
evening.
An impromptu program of jinks has
; been arranged by Shirley Baker, '9i>,
i and Charley Fields, '95, to revive the
! stunts of the old days on the campus.
The more serious part of the enter-
I tainment will be speeches by Coach
j Presley, '07, James Lanagan, '00, H. C.
; Hoover, '95, and others.
The alumni entertainment committee
has arranged for a short program in
which a number of the campus stage
' favorites will take part. All the
j stunts will be impromptu and designed
to keep the general spirit of merriment
of the assemblage under way.
No one who ever has attended an
' alumni smoker will miss tomorrow
night's festivities. A general invita
tion to all undergraduates and alumni
to attend and participate in the fun
is extended by the alumni association.
The program will start about S
o'clock, although undergraduates and
alumni will begin to assemble about
7:30. The San Francisco Press Club
is located on the top floor of the Com
mercial building, on Market street near
Fourth.
