# Ready For Victory.
## 
### 
The reception accorded the 1912
Varsity in the Assembly Hall last
evening, showed them the faith that

the rooters have in their
team. It was not the
volume of noise that made
this apparent, but, rather,

the spirit behind it all. It will be the
same spirit with the same earnestness
that will be back of the team tomor
row. Such being the case we look to
a renewal of the Stanford chain of
victories. It is fitting that we should
have the utmost faith in our Varsity,
for never have fifteen better men worn
the Cardinal. We know that they will
be worthy representatives of Stanford
tomorrow, for they have been taught
their rugby and clean sportsmanship
by Coach George J. Presley. We may
look with confidence upon Saturday's
results.
