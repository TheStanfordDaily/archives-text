# "BOBS," OF THE CHRONICLE, PRONOUNCES FOR STANFORD
## 
### "Bobs 
Who will win the seventh annual
Rugby game between California and
Stanford? That is the question that
the undergraduates of the two univer
sities are asking today and it will be
answered within the next thirty-six
hours 011 California field. Every Rugby
enthusiast on the Pacific is hanging
011 the fence when the question is put
to him and it looks like the safest
attitude to assume.
Four weeks ago Stanford had a con
siderable margin over their Blue and
Gold rivals and figured to win without
much trouble but the situation has
changed appreciably since that time
and it looks like a very even affair.
The preliminary season has been the
most strenuous one ever experienced
by the two squads, due in a large
measure to the presence of the "All
Star" Australians, who have given the
Varsity teams more action and fight in
the two games than they usually re
ceive in a whole season.
As a result of the Australian games
the Cardinals ran into a severe slump,
which fortunately struck the squad
long enough before the Big Game to
give them time to recouperate and this
they have apparently done, though
only in the nick of time. Last Satur
day the Stanford players were still
somewhat under the influence of this
slump, which was, however, fast fading
away, and there is every reason to be
lieve that every man will be in the
pink of condition who wears the car
dinal of Stanford 011 Saturday.
The strife for positions has been ex
ceptionally keen this year and Coach
Presley and his committee have used
considerable judgement in the final se
lection of the men. In choosing fifteen
sound men, every one of them in the
best of trim, they have chosen wisely,
and past, experience seems to have
guided their hands in this particular.
Too many teams, possessing semi
cripples in their make-up, have in
vited the defeat of the Cardinal in past
years through this unenviable posses
sion.
With eleven veterans on the team

against seven in the line-up of the rival
Blue and Gold, Stanford has an ad
vantage that is hard to estimate in
cold discussion, but one that will prob
ably make itself evident when the
players take the field and are fighting
for supremacy and their Alma Mater
in the heat of strife. None of the
veterans bear indications as they did
in the 1909 game of having lost their
pep and given their best to Stanford
in previous years, as every man in the
team had to fight hard for his position
with such a busy lot of second teamers
and substitutes hanging on his trail
for the honors. The back field is the
cleverest ever turned out by the Car
dinal and the forwards know more
about Rugby than any of their pre
decessors. It is surely a fat year for
the farmers and they must be con
sidered a better chance of lift the
spoils than they have in recent years.
What, then, of the Blue and Gold?
During the early portion of the pre
liminary season it really looked hope
less for California to develop a team
chat would even give a reasonable ar
gument to the Cardinal, but since that
time even the most pessimistic skeptics
are willing to admit that the Blue and
Gold must be conceded more than a
fighting chance of victory. The for
wards are a very speedy lot, as their
game with the visiting Waratahs
clearly demonstrated, and though the
back-field is scarcely up to the stand
ard of 1910 and 1911, it is a much
faster aggregation than the early sea
son gave promise of.
Both Varsities bagged a victory from
the Australians from a close margin,
and the other preliminary games are
too close to draw drastic conclusions,
but to the writer it is hard to figure
how a team composed of so many
novices to intercollegiate football can
hold their own with a veteran output,
other things being equal. It would
not, however, produce the big surprise
that the game of 1909 provided should
the Blue and Gold be returned victori
ous. At the same time, 1 refuse to be
forced on the fence, and pronounce for
Stanford.

son gave promise of.
Both Varsities bagged a victory from
the Australians from a close margin,
and the other preliminary games are
too close to draw drastic conclusions,
but to the writer it is hard to figure
how a team composed of so many
novices to intercollegiate football can
hold their own with a veteran output,
other things being equal. It would

Who will win the seventh annual
Rugby game between California and
Stanford? That is the question that
the undergraduates of the two univer
sities are asking today and it will be
answered within the next thirty-six
hours 011 California field. Every Rugby
enthusiast on the Pacific is hanging
011 the fence when the question is put
to him and it looks like the safest
attitude to assume.
Four weeks ago Stanford had a con
siderable margin over their Blue and
Gold rivals and figured to win without
much trouble but the situation has
changed appreciably since that time
and it looks like a very even affair.
The preliminary season has been the
most strenuous one ever experienced
by the two squads, due in a large
measure to the presence of the "All
Star" Australians, who have given the
Varsity teams more action and fight in
the two games than they usually re
ceive in a whole season.
As a result of the Australian games
the Cardinals ran into a severe slump,
which fortunately struck the squad
long enough before the Big Game to
give them time to recouperate and this
they have apparently done, though
only in the nick of time. Last Satur
day the Stanford players were still
somewhat under the influence of this
slump, which was, however, fast fading
away, and there is every reason to be
lieve that every man will be in the
pink of condition who wears the car
dinal of Stanford 011 Saturday.
The strife for positions has been ex
ceptionally keen this year and Coach
Presley and his committee have used
considerable judgement in the final se
lection of the men. In choosing fifteen
sound men, every one of them in the
best of trim, they have chosen wisely,
and past, experience seems to have
guided their hands in this particular.
Too many teams, possessing semi
cripples in their make-up, have in
vited the defeat of the Cardinal in past
years through this unenviable posses
sion.
With eleven veterans on the team

against seven in the line-up of the rival
Blue and Gold, Stanford has an ad
vantage that is hard to estimate in
cold discussion, but one that will prob
ably make itself evident when the
players take the field and are fighting
for supremacy and their Alma Mater
in the heat of strife. None of the
veterans bear indications as they did
in the 1909 game of having lost their
pep and given their best to Stanford
in previous years, as every man in the
team had to fight hard for his position
with such a busy lot of second teamers
and substitutes hanging on his trail
for the honors. The back field is the
cleverest ever turned out by the Car
dinal and the forwards know more
about Rugby than any of their pre
decessors. It is surely a fat year for
the farmers and they must be con
sidered a better chance of lift the
spoils than they have in recent years.
What, then, of the Blue and Gold?
During the early portion of the pre
liminary season it really looked hope
less for California to develop a team
chat would even give a reasonable ar
gument to the Cardinal, but since that
time even the most pessimistic skeptics
are willing to admit that the Blue and
Gold must be conceded more than a
fighting chance of victory. The for
wards are a very speedy lot, as their
game with the visiting Waratahs
clearly demonstrated, and though the
back-field is scarcely up to the stand
ard of 1910 and 1911, it is a much
faster aggregation than the early sea
son gave promise of.
