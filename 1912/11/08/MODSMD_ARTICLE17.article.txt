# CARDINAL VETERANS WILL BRING VICTORY
## 
### O.H. Castle, â€™14 
A look backward at the rugby season
just closing is like a glimpse into
topsy-turvy land. The rival Varsities
have been so erratic in their scoring,
and have undergone such startling re
versals of form, that a summary view
of the games is at once interesting and
puzzling. Therefore, the task of pre
dicting the probable winner tomorrow
holds a certain satisfaction for one
not experienced in the art, since the
layman stands little greater chance of
going astray than the expert. Under
such circumstances, and setting aside
so far as may be the natural prejudice
which comes from allegiance to the
Cardinal, I may at once predict a Stan
ford victory by a small but not in
glorious score.
In point of condition and pep our
team is better off than it has ever been
in recent years, and here we must be
granted at least an even break. Su
perior' experience is Stanford's great
asset. Eleven veterans as against
seven is an advantage almost incal
culable, and may well be in the de
termining factor of the match tomor
row. At this we do not make light of
the ability of the formidable Califor
nia team, which has made such rapid
strides during the latter part of the
season. On paper the California back-

field combination is one to give the
Cardinal cause for some alarm, though
it is not as good a scoring machine as
that of last year. However, the seven
men back of the Stanford scrum are no
mean antagonists, so that, it is not
likely that the superiority attributed
by some to the Blue and Gold backs
will make itself seriously evident in
actual performance. The Cardinal
j backfield, as now arranged, is one
which is well able to slip over a score
I at the psychological moment.
It is, however, to our veteran and
much-improved scrum that the Stan
ford rooter looks to gain us our shade
of advantage. We acknowledge the
remarkable dribbling ability of the
I Californians, but the Stanford forwards
themselves are better at this game than
lin previous years. By breaking
I through, moreover, they should gain
much for the Cardinal. We may also
hope to see superior offensive opera
tions carried on by our breakaways
than by the opposing near-wing-for
wards. In defense, though California
is well-nigh perfect, Stanford should
be on even terms throughout, with de
cidedly the better of the argument at
the important fullback station.
It is, then, on the possession of a
veteran team with such a record and
such qualifications that Stanford basis
its hopes of victory tomorrow.

j backfield, as now arranged, is one
which is well able to slip over a score
I at the psychological moment.
It is, however, to our veteran and
much-improved scrum that the Stan
ford rooter looks to gain us our shade
of advantage. We acknowledge the
remarkable dribbling ability of the
I Californians, but the Stanford forwards
themselves are better at this game than
lin previous years. By breaking
I through, moreover, they should gain
much for the Cardinal. We may also
hope to see superior offensive opera
tions carried on by our breakaways
than by the opposing near-wing-for
wards. In defense, though California
is well-nigh perfect, Stanford should
be on even terms throughout, with de
cidedly the better of the argument at
the important fullback station.
It is, then, on the possession of a
veteran team with such a record and
such qualifications that Stanford basis
its hopes of victory tomorrow.
