# Enthusiastic Send-Off Is Given 1912 Varsity
## 
### 
Last evening's ovation to the team
exemplified that Cardinal fighting
spirit whose note has been sounded by
innumeral le rally speakers in Stan
lord history. In 1910, after a rugby
del eat, the rooters yelled for twelve
minutes as the Varsity came in. Again
the Cardinal was lowered on the field,
' tit last, season the hearts and lungs
ot the rnrters responded with fifteen
minutes of uninterrupted cheering in
the Big Rally. This year, with rugby
victory having once more perched upon
the Blue and Gold banners, the Stan

"steam roller clap" which started the
season two months ago, shook Assem
bly Hall and made the story of the
fall of the Walls of Jericho seems plau
sible even to the veriest pagan.
Throughout it all, heads were turned
toward the door, waiting. As the team,
coach and trainer entered, each man
rose to the back of his seat and for
sixteen minutes became, not himself,
but a yelling individual imbued with
but one purpose in life—a determina
tion to "stick till the last whistle," as
Coach George Presley later expressed
it.
The enthusiasm remained at fever
pitch ruding the evening. It was kept
alive by five excellent speakers, rein

ford Band.
At the conclusion of the rally the
