# Enthusiastic Send-Off Is Given 1912 Varsity
## 
### 
Last evening's ovation to the team
exemplified that Cardinal fighting
spirit whose note has been sounded by
innumeral le rally speakers in Stan
lord history. In 1910, after a rugby
del eat, the rooters yelled for twelve
minutes as the Varsity came in. Again
the Cardinal was lowered on the field,
' tit last, season the hearts and lungs
ot the rnrters responded with fifteen
minutes of uninterrupted cheering in
the Big Rally. This year, with rugby
victory having once more perched upon
the Blue and Gold banners, the Stan
ford Student Body came back with
sixteen minutes of continuous din as
the Varsity took its seats amid showers
of streamers from the equally loyal
enthusiasts of the fairer sex in the
galleries.
The rally stood out from its pre
decessors for two reasons—the excel
lence of the speeches and the unani
mous and whole-hearted predictions
of victory. It was raised to a yet
higher plane by a certain fineness of
spirit which pervaded it—a spirit de
manding and confident of clean play;
a spirit recognizing the sacrifices of
those unsung heroes, the "twilight

squad." The splendid tribute to the
men of the second team from C. F.
Laumeister, '07, appears below.
The commotion began with the
stroke of seven and rose to a high
pitch when Encina Club serpentined
in three hundred strong. Wave upon
wave of sound, accompanied by the
"steam roller clap" which started the
season two months ago, shook Assem
bly Hall and made the story of the
fall of the Walls of Jericho seems plau
sible even to the veriest pagan.
Throughout it all, heads were turned
toward the door, waiting. As the team,
coach and trainer entered, each man
rose to the back of his seat and for
sixteen minutes became, not himself,
but a yelling individual imbued with
but one purpose in life—a determina
tion to "stick till the last whistle," as
Coach George Presley later expressed
it.
The enthusiasm remained at fever
pitch ruding the evening. It was kept
alive by five excellent speakers, rein
forced by the equally excellent Stan
ford Band.
At the conclusion of the rally the
rooters serpentined around by Cardinal
lire 011 the Inner Quad. Later, the
yelling enthusiasts tore around the
huge bonfire of the Freshman class
till the (lames kickered low. Then
"Hail, Stanford, Hail" was sung with
bared heads.
The first speaker introduced by Yell
Leader Wilson, was Professor Wood
ward of the Law department.
"Stanford has two athletic traditions
which have been kept sacred. The
first is the tradition of fair play in all
athletic contests. The second is that
a Stanford team, though it may be out
scored and outplayed, is never out
fought. We only expect that the Car
dinal team will go up to Berkeley and
uphold these traditions."
To the team—"You have been coach
ed by a man who knows his business,
trained by a man who has kept the
squad in perfect condition, so give
them all you've got and we'll be con
tent."
Professor Folsom of the Geology de
partment said:
"We are here with a common pur
pose—to show our appreciation of the
I!U2 rugby team, to show our confi
dence in the work of Trainer Maloney,
to show our appreciation of the sacri
fice made by Coach Presley to coach
this team, and, finally, to show our
confidence in the fifteen men chosen to
wear the Cardinal on California field
Saturday.
"There is one thing that the Ameri
can people demand and that is honest
success. These men have been coached
by a man whom we all consider to be
of the best, and they have been helped
and supported by the hard working
players who failed to make the team."

C. F. Laumeister, '07, was intro
duced as a former Student Body Presi
dent and Varsity man.
"I feel that Stanford will win on
Saturday. I feel that the coach and
trainer have done their work well, and
I know that the entire Student Body is
going to be behind them on Saturday.
And we are here to show them that we
will be behind them, win or lose.
"I would have you remember Hint
there are men who have sacrificed
much for the cause, that do not sit in
these seats of honor with the team.
They are the twilight squad, the scrub
team, or whatever you may wish t«>
call tlieni. Hut it is this second fifteen
that makes the Stanford spirit possible,
and they are the men who help to make
everything that is holy in the Stanford
spirit."
"I don't mind this going on record,"
said Trainer Maloney, "that F say that
the men who are going in Saturday's
game are in fine condition. Every man
is sound and able to give all he has in
him. And I don't mind saying that I
think we are going to celebrate three
victories on Saturday, one in debatt,
one in soccer, and one in rugby."
Coach Presley was the last, speaker,
and he hit straight from the shoulder.
"Throughout the entire season there
have been a number of pessimistic re
ports emanating from the Berkeley

campus as to the ability of their team.
These reports reached Stanford, and
some of the Berkeley men hoped that
the students here would become over
confident. Rut (he men on the squad
have known better. They knew that
Berkeley had the nucleus of a strong
team and that a number of players had
developed that would make a fine
machine.
"It is perfectly true that Berkeley
has not the scoring machine of the
past two years, but it is also perfectly
true that the team is not to be beaten In
defense. And as a scoring combina
tion they are good.
"There is just one thing that 1 want
remembered, and that is that the vic
tory is not won or lost in the firiN
fifteen minutes of play, or in the first
fifteen minutes of the second half, or in
the last five minutes of the game. The
crucial moment comes when one side
has made the first score. If the team
and the students in the bleachers let
down in the crucial moments, we can
not hope to win. If you get together
and get behind the team, they'll not
come out losers.
"All that this team asks is that you
stick it out until the end. Don't just
stick it out until Berkeley scores, or
until the last five minutes of play.
Stick it out —stick till the gun is
fired!"
