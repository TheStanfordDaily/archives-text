# RUGBY CRITICS NAME PROBABLE WINNER FOR INTERCOLLEGIATE GAME
## AUSTRALIAN CRACK COMPARES VARSITIES TOM RICHARDS TELLS OF RECENT RUGBY SERIES. Sees Cardinal Victory if We Duplicate Showing in Second Game with Visitors.

of the Australian Rugby Team.
Now that the Australian team has
concluded its series of games against
the University of California, the time
appears opportune for a general
synopsis. This is, however, an ex
tremely dificult proposition. Never
before have 1 been so balked in an
attempt to form a comparison between
two sides as at the present time. It
is not a matter of insufficient obser
vation of the various tactics employed,
nor is it want of confidence that affects
my position. Somehow or other there
is such a striking resemblance in the
methods of play adopted by both Uni
versities that extreme difficulty awaits
any attempted prophecy. During our
three games at Berkeley we found our
opponents a very hard side. Their
offense is not strong, nor is it system
atic, still, in all of our contests, their
backs showed considerable judgment
by jumping in quickly and making
use of any bad handling and the many
fumbles that occurred on the Austra
lian three-quarter line, and when pace
alone prevented the notching of
points.
During our first encounter, rain
soddened the field to such an extent
that Australia immediately discarded
open passing play, confining then
work almost entirely to dribbling
rusWes, which style of play non
plussed the Varsity lads and left them
considerably in arrears on the score
of points.
In the two following games the
University lads showed their resource
and adaptability by successfully ap
plying dribbling, high punting, and
cross-kicking very creditably, so suc
cessfully, in fact, that Australia were
one point behind at the finish of the
second day's play.
The victory was achieved in a
similar manner to that great win of
Stanford's in the return game. Tin-,
Australian forwards secured the ball
with monontonous regularity from the
scrum and the backs essayed attack
ing movements with the three-quarter
line, but so successful and strenuous
did the students oppose the invading
party that at the call of time Austra
lia had only one converted try to her
credit against one try and a penalty
goal for Berkeley.
It was a repetition of Stanford's 111
to 12 victory, yet hardly so defined, as
the blue and gold wearers did not have
the same sparkle nor was their dash
ing through so effective.
The games on the Stanford campus
were a little more brilliant and con
siderably more exciting, and if the
Cardinal are as open and as resource
ful on November 9, and if the Blue*and
Gold produce nothing better than T
have yet seen. 1 will expect to see
Stanford a few points ahead as the
gun announces the conclusion of hos
tilities.

of the Australian Rugby Team.
Now that the Australian team has
concluded its series of games against
the University of California, the time
appears opportune for a general
synopsis. This is, however, an ex
tremely dificult proposition. Never
before have 1 been so balked in an
attempt to form a comparison between
two sides as at the present time. It
is not a matter of insufficient obser
vation of the various tactics employed,
nor is it want of confidence that affects
my position. Somehow or other there
is such a striking resemblance in the
methods of play adopted by both Uni
versities that extreme difficulty awaits
any attempted prophecy. During our
three games at Berkeley we found our
opponents a very hard side. Their
offense is not strong, nor is it system
atic, still, in all of our contests, their
backs showed considerable judgment
by jumping in quickly and making
use of any bad handling and the many
fumbles that occurred on the Austra
lian three-quarter line, and when pace
alone prevented the notching of
points.
During our first encounter, rain
soddened the field to such an extent
that Australia immediately discarded
open passing play, confining then
work almost entirely to dribbling
rusWes, which style of play non
plussed the Varsity lads and left them
considerably in arrears on the score
of points.
In the two following games the
University lads showed their resource
and adaptability by successfully ap
plying dribbling, high punting, and
cross-kicking very creditably, so suc
cessfully, in fact, that Australia were
one point behind at the finish of the
second day's play.
The victory was achieved in a
similar manner to that great win of
Stanford's in the return game. Tin-,
Australian forwards secured the ball
with monontonous regularity from the
scrum and the backs essayed attack
ing movements with the three-quarter
line, but so successful and strenuous
did the students oppose the invading
party that at the call of time Austra
lia had only one converted try to her
credit against one try and a penalty
goal for Berkeley.
It was a repetition of Stanford's 111
to 12 victory, yet hardly so defined, as
the blue and gold wearers did not have
the same sparkle nor was their dash
ing through so effective.
The games on the Stanford campus
were a little more brilliant and con
siderably more exciting, and if the
Cardinal are as open and as resource
ful on November 9, and if the Blue*and
Gold produce nothing better than T
have yet seen. 1 will expect to see
Stanford a few points ahead as the
gun announces the conclusion of hos
tilities.
