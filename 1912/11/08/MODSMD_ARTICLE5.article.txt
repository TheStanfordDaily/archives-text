# STANFORD WILL WIN BY A NARROW MARGIN
## FORMER EDITOR IS FORECASTER OF VICTORY. Palmer Fuller, ’10, Chairman of Referee's Union, Gives Advantage For Cardinal Varsity. 
### W.P. Fuller, Jr., ’10 
Exactly one year ago, in these
columns, the writer predicted a Stan
ford defeat. At once he found himself,
in some quarters at least, the subject
of caustic comment, numerous campus
critics avowing their surprise that a
Stanford alumnus in a signed state
ment immediately preceding the "Big
Game" should have the bad taste to
prophesy aught but victory for the
Cardinal.
The foreging facts are recalled in
the hope that the prediction of a Stan
ford victory, which is now about to lie
made, will be considered the writer's
honest belief, and not as a soothing
balm for those sensitive souls who pre
fer false hopes to truthful realities.
Stanford began the present Rugby
season with a distinct advantage over
California as regards the number of
experienced Varsity players available.
However, California's veterans were
veterans of winning teams, Stanford's
of losing teams. The Cardinal fifteen
with its larger nucleus naturally play
ed better rugby earlier than did Cali
fornia, and the climax was reached in
the second Australian game. At that
time it seemed a "cinch" for Stanford
on November 9. Then came the slump.
And although Stanford has now re
covered from that depression, the team
lias not since played a game worthy of
comparison with that offered in the
second contest with the Waratahs.
California, on the other hand, made
comparatively little apparent progress
early in the season, but more recently
has forged ahead with far greater ra
pidity, gaining ground steadily with
each game played, until now the
"cinch" of three weeks ago looks like
the closest kind of a fight.
Neither team may be termed a
scoring machine. Previous seasons
have known better backfields than
either fifteen can boast this season,
but any advantage that may exist in
this respect probably rests with the
Cardinal. Defensively, there is little
to choose between the contesting five
wights and three-quarters, but Stanford
has an undeniable "edge" at full.
The game should develop largely into
a forwards' battle, and here, with her
well-trained, old-time veteran pack, as
against the less experienced material
in the Blue and Gold scrum, Stanford
should gain the small advantage with
which, in the writer's opinion, her
team will take the field.
The condition of the men is a potent
factor and can never be spoken of
beforehand with any comfortable de
cree of certainty. Yet. it may easily
unset all calculations and the final re
sult in the closing minutes of play.
Condition being equal, the writer
looks for a close, relatively low-score
same with Stanford on the winning
end by a very narrow margin. In
other words, we have a shade better
than an even break.

Condition being equal, the writer
looks for a close, relatively low-score
same with Stanford on the winning
end by a very narrow margin. In
other words, we have a shade better
than an even break.
Exactly one year ago, in these
columns, the writer predicted a Stan
ford defeat. At once he found himself,
in some quarters at least, the subject
of caustic comment, numerous campus
critics avowing their surprise that a
Stanford alumnus in a signed state
ment immediately preceding the "Big
Game" should have the bad taste to
prophesy aught but victory for the
Cardinal.
The foreging facts are recalled in
the hope that the prediction of a Stan
ford victory, which is now about to lie
made, will be considered the writer's
honest belief, and not as a soothing
balm for those sensitive souls who pre
fer false hopes to truthful realities.
Stanford began the present Rugby
season with a distinct advantage over
California as regards the number of
experienced Varsity players available.
However, California's veterans were
veterans of winning teams, Stanford's
of losing teams. The Cardinal fifteen
with its larger nucleus naturally play
ed better rugby earlier than did Cali
fornia, and the climax was reached in
the second Australian game. At that
time it seemed a "cinch" for Stanford
on November 9. Then came the slump.
And although Stanford has now re
covered from that depression, the team
lias not since played a game worthy of
comparison with that offered in the
second contest with the Waratahs.
California, on the other hand, made
comparatively little apparent progress
early in the season, but more recently
has forged ahead with far greater ra
pidity, gaining ground steadily with
each game played, until now the
"cinch" of three weeks ago looks like
the closest kind of a fight.
Neither team may be termed a
scoring machine. Previous seasons
have known better backfields than
either fifteen can boast this season,
but any advantage that may exist in
this respect probably rests with the
Cardinal. Defensively, there is little
to choose between the contesting five
wights and three-quarters, but Stanford
has an undeniable "edge" at full.
The game should develop largely into
a forwards' battle, and here, with her
well-trained, old-time veteran pack, as
against the less experienced material
in the Blue and Gold scrum, Stanford
should gain the small advantage with
which, in the writer's opinion, her
team will take the field.
The condition of the men is a potent
factor and can never be spoken of
beforehand with any comfortable de
cree of certainty. Yet. it may easily
unset all calculations and the final re
sult in the closing minutes of play.
Condition being equal, the writer
looks for a close, relatively low-score
same with Stanford on the winning
end by a very narrow margin. In
other words, we have a shade better
