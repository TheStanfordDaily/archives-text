# CALIFORNIA WRITER PICKS BLUE AND GOLD TEAM
## HAS CONFIDENCE IN CAPTAIN, COACH AND TEAM. Expectations for Victory Lie in Combination Play and Fighting Spirit of Fifteen. 
### Paul L. Edwards, California '14 
Doping the outcome of the Big Game
is like trying to tell which way a frog
will jump. One may predict rightly,
but the chances are almost even that
he will not. There are, however,
reasons why the Blue and Gold fifteen
may be expected to win from Stanford
next Saturday. Not because California
has three years of success to her
credit does she expect to serpentine,
nor is it because of any blind over
confidence, for the rooters at Berkeley
have had many discouraging set-backs.
It is rather because of a supreme con
fidence in Captain Stroud, his fifteen,
the rooters, and in "Jimmie" Schaeft'er,
that the Blue and Gold predicts itself
a victory.
In some ways, the Cardinal fifteen
lias the advantage. The men as a
whole have had a longer experience
with the game. They have had a good
deal of practice in the positions which
they will play Saturday. They have
the advantage of a more brilliant pre
liminary season. On the other hand,
Captain Stroud's men have been shift
ed from berth to berth in hasty at
tempts to find the right men for the
vacant positions. This shifting had to

he continued to such a late date that
the tea n lost weeks of valuable prac
tice as a working unit. It was not
until the second game with the Aus
tralians that the bleachers got an ink
ling of the worth of this year's fifteen.
As yet, no one has seen what it really
can do.
Inside five, left vacant by Amos
Elliott, was the position which caused

so much worry to the California
coaches. Alan alter man was tried out
for the position; each one either was
too weak for the post or was indis
pensable somewhere else. Lately,
freshman Hazel tine has been playing
first live, and, although the final lineup
is not yet announced, lie will probably
be seen there Saturday. With a little
shifting, the other positions have taken
care of themselves.
Californians know that "Jimmie"
and "Skook" will have the team in
superb trim, that the team itself will
be a wonderful working unit which
will fight to the last second, and that
the rooters will back the team to the
final gun. Therein are the expecta
tions of the Blue and Gold in a game
like this where the teams are so nearly
evenly balanced.
