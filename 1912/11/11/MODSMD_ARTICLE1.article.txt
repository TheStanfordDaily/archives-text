# STANFORD VICTOR IN SOCCER CONTEST
## Cardinal Eleven Demonstrates Superiority Over California Team by 3 to 1 Score. 
### 
Outclassed by the superior work of
tlif Stanford soccer eleven, the Blue
and Gold representatives were de
feated Saturday morning by a* to 1 i
score. The game was played on a j
field of slush, with the rain falling I
throughout the match. Better team
play, more accurate dribbling, and
general all-around ability were the
means of the Cardinal success. Stan
ford's eleven won because it had the
better team.
From the opening kick-off the ball
went into Stanford territory and the
Cardinal players were put on the de
fensive. The work of the Stanford
forwards showed to advantage in drib
bling nut of danger. Fyfe scored the
initial goal of the contest when he
received a pass from Pratt and shot
the ball past the California goalkeeper.
This was the only score of the first j
half. Both goal tenders, Butcher for
Stanford and Barbera for California, j
were kept busy preventing successful j
kicks.
Soon after the beginning of the
second half, Captain Bellas sent the |
ball into the net after the ball had I
been advanced by Pratt and Higgins.
Mills, the California leader, who was [
easil.v the best of the Blue and Gold j
forwards, was responsible for the lone
point of tlie losers.
Fyfe scored his second goal just be-j
tin' time was up by booting the ball j
into the net from a corner shot.
California adopted kick and rush
tactics but the Stanford team proved
to l e the best at any sort of play.
Bellas, Fyfe. Pratt, Butcher and Willi
ams were the consistent stars for the
Cardinal.
