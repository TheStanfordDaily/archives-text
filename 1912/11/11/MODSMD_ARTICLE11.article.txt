# A
						Great Game.

The 1912 Stanford Varsity justified
the faith that the rooters placed in
them. The game that they played 011

Saturday afternoon, will go
down 011 the athletic annals
of the two universities as
one of the greatest of the

Intercollegiate rugby contests. Both
universities may be proud of the clean
game that each team played. For
true sportsmanship, the contest was a
credit to the West.
Under normal conditions the Stan
ford fifteen would have been the victor
â€”the consensus of rugby experts is to
that effect. Coach Presley deserves
the greatest praise for turning out
such a team. To Trainer Maloney goes
the credit for putting a team on the
field that was physically fit.
The condition of California Field
on Saturday afternoon finds no justi
fication. The spectators can hardly
be criticised for complaining. They
came to see an athletic contest on an
athletic field. This was on the field
of a great institution which is able to
provide a turf field or an adequatb
drainage for a dirt one. Hasty at-the
last-minute attempts are unavailing
on such a field as California has.
Some remedy ought to be found be
fore there is the chance for another
game under such conditions.
