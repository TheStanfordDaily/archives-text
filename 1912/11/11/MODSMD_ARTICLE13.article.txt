# LARGE GATHERING SEES INTERCOLLEGIATE MATCH
## Rugby Enthusiasts Crowd Bleachers to Cheer for Favorites—Many Alumni Present. 
### 
Red chrysanthemums and carnations
typifying Stanford vied with the blue
of the California violets —both blos
soming in contrast to the leaden skies
with their ominous threats of more
rain. California, almost twenty-three
thousand strong, had gathered here to
spur on the particular favorites among
the chosen thirty battling on the field
of muck for the honor of their alma
mater. Much of the gay appearance
noitceable at previous intercollegiate
football struggles was lacking. With
Jupiter Pluvius evincing a desire to
take further control of the situation at
any moment, rain coats and somber
lined hats predominated. Many a holi
day gown remained unworn by its fair
owner.
Along the side-lines the top layer
of mud scraped from the California
quagmire was heaped. Camera men,
officials, coaches and attendants labor
ed to extricate themselves from their
own footsteps. The players early be
came practically unrecognizable by a
coating of clay-caked Berkeley sod.
But the game went on, despite the
elements.
Old grads, former students, members
of the rival student bodies, fathers,
mothers, sisters and brothers, were
there. Stanford occupied the west
sections while the Blue and Gold par
tisans were opposite. Weather con
ditions made stunts impossible so this
feature was omitted.

inent alumni had seats on the Cardinal
side. Among the former football
