# CALIFORNIA'S CEMENT C COATED WITH CARDINAL.
## 
### 
With its yellow hid by a coat of
Cardinal, the His C which overlooks
California Field from the Berkelej
Hills presented a very extraordinary
appearance for twenty minutes Satur
day morning between 7 and 8. Two
loyal Stanford freshmen turned the
trick. California sophomores guarded
the emblem all Friday night. At 7
they left for breakfast. As soon as
they got out of sight, the Cardinal
freshmen came over the hill and hasti
ly applied the coat. When paint ran
out they threw dirt on the cement.
As soon as the California men spotted
the work from the campus they imme
diately started back, but not before the
job had been done and the Stanford
men had escaped. A coat of yellow
soon hid the red.
