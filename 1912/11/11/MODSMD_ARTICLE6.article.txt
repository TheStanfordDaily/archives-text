i :ite!ligenewas obviouslx the proper
c Dtion for the story. Skidding,
tli.li.is,', over a sea of mnd, the thirty
f( ur players win entered the contest
w .ed it t<: the bitter end —an end
vric'i w;n unsatisfactory to every
body and particularly to tlie Stanford
rr oters.
Stanford had a decided shade tlie
I ■:t.er of the argument throughout'.
Not only did she confine the play to
the Ulue and Gold side of midfield for
a. majority of tlie eighty minutes, but
she was undoubtedly superior in tlie
loose and ruck, which is almost
synonymous for saving in tlie entire
;a'iie. It was the admirable defense
of ( alifornia which preserved the neat
ind artistic balance of the figures on
the scoreboard.

.Mankind of every breed being prone
to the "postmortem," it is interesting
to speculate as to tlie probable out
come of ibe match had it been played
under ideal weather conditions. The
Stanford fifteen made a wonderful
showing in the face of conditions
under which it had had absolutely no
practice, and which were admittedly
favorable to California; so the con
jecture is most pleasant to the Car
dinal fan. Hut Stanford was held to
a tie by a clean and splendid team,
which cannot, b,\ the most rabid, be
accused of acting in collusion with
the rain god; and gcod sportsmanship
is the better part of valor, brave
though these speculations may be.
The men who played Saturday on
California Field —Field! Save t lie
mark! —fought as men have seldom
fought before. All through that long
gray nightmare in the mud every man
played grittily and coolheadedly; and
lie deserves the title of "football hero"
