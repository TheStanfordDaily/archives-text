# STANFORD EXCELS IN MIRY MELEE
## Cardinal Forwards Prove Best Mud-hens—Backs Have Little Chance to Shine. 
### 
more than the sensational figure of
fiction. The fact that not a Stanford
man was forced to leave the field
through injury speaks volumes for the
perfect condition of the players. Al
most as much can be said for Cali
fornia; and "tiiue-out" was con
spicuous by iis absence Saturday.
The brightest feature of the whole
mud-colored performance was the fact
that tlie game itself was clean. The
dirt didn't get into the dispositions of
the players. So rugby as an inter
collegiate sport was saved from pos
sible disaster.
Referee Mill's handling of the game
was entirely commendable. He was
an impartial, strict, and accomplished
official. The work of linesmen Dwyei
and Reading was also above reproach,
though their services in advising the
referee of unfair play were fortunately
not called for.
As to the game itself, not much can
be said of that for the simple reason
that it was not a real rugby game. It
was a sort of glorified combination of
soccer and water polo. Almost the
only useable asset from the weary
weeks of practice in scientific fielding
and passing of the ball was the splen
did condition of the fifteens; and to
get that the men might about as well
have pulled chest weights and done
track work. One player can boot a
sodden ball along the ground about
as well as another when botli have
mud in their eyes.
ruder such circumstances all the
more credit is due to the men for their
splendid fight and for adopting on the
spur of the moment an entirely new
style of play. It was practically a
physical impossibility to play better
Rugby than that played by the two
teams under Saturday's conditions.
Naturally it was first and foremost a
forward contest. Moth packs develop
ed unexpected ability, but the Stanford
scrum men led in concerted dribbling.
Almost the entire time they kept the
ball in the enemy's territory. This
dribbling on both sides failed to avail
more in the scoring line because it
consisted largely in long, hard kicks.
The best piece of dribbling was a lone
exhibition by liennie Erb, which oc
curred, sadly enough, after the whistle
had blown to call play back. Had the
forwards worked in pairs or bunches,
and had they been able to keep the ball
at their toes, this method of attack
mignt have been more effective.
As for the backs, their lot for the
day was to play on the defensive —to
cast themselves nervily on the ball to
stop dribbling rushes; and this both
sets did faithfully and well. Their
handling of the slimy sphere was re
markable under the circumstances;
but some of them did not realize
during the first half that to attempt
passing rushes was substantially of
no avail. The only rousing bit of
backfield offense of the day was when
Urban tucked the ball under one arm
and showed a muddy pair of heels to
his opponents—but the whistle had
blown. When Referee Hill called the
play back it appeared to be proceed
ing in California's direction. Had the
whistle not blown until after the
speedy Freshman scooped up the ball,
the play would have proceeded, under
the advantage rule, and this history
might have been more pleasant to
write.
Two methods of attack which might
have been profitable were not largely
used—the high kick and follow up and
the cross-kick. Erb's short cross
kick-off at the opening of the second
half, followed up by the bunched for
wards and caught by Noble, worked
excellently.
It seems futile to attempt to pick
individual stars when every man
played so well and gave all that was
in him. Moreover, the mud which
turned blue and cardinal jerseys to the
same hue made one man look so like
another that it is no easy matter to
give honor to whom honor is due.
Erb and Peart could always be dis
tinguished, through their detached
positions; and the work of these two
men can only be described as wonder
ful. The punting duels between then,
were the spectacles of the day. Peart's
great playing undoubtedly saved the
day for California, while Erb's beauti
ful handling of the ball on defence and
his ground- and breath-gaining boots
to touch were invaluable assets for
the Cardinal.
The fact that "every other Stanford
'>ack was not a star was simply lie
cause he did not have a chance to be.
it was, Kern, Noble, and Risling
oerhaps figured most strongly on de
fensive operations. Captain Cass and
Morris both filled the trying pivotal
positions to perfection: and it must

be remarked that Cass seemed to have
the edge on the redoubtable Morris.
In the Stanford scrum Schaupp was
prominent in lineouts and elsewhere,
us was Partridge; Card and Darsie
were almost ideal breakaways and
proved themselves good mudders;
Smith was a tower ot' strength; and
Sanborn, seconded by Hall and Cor
bett, was always on the ball.
"Big Bill" King, followed by Flem
ing, were leaders in the California
pack. The "peppy," hard-playing Mc-
Kim, as well as Miller and Fletcher,
were also noticeable. In the backtield
every Californian did his work well.
The detailed history of the match
follows:
The (wiinie.
Stanford won the toss and chose to
defend the south end. Captain Stroud
kicked off for California at one minute
of three. Kern returning the ball to
touch at Stanford's 45. In ensuing
lineout California men dribbled over
Stanford line, Erb saving. After a
ruck in midfield the Cardinal forwards
dribbled from their 40 to opponents'
25. In a scrum at the 25, the Califor
nia breakaways caught Cass with the
ball, but the Stanford forwards drib- 1
bled through to a 2 yard scrum.
Noble marked and Erb attempted to
dropkick a goal from 25 line, but fail- (
ed. The ball was returned to the 40.
Here California was given a free kick
and Peart found touch at midfield.
Play zigzagged across the midfield
line, Erb, Peart and Morris getting in
good boots. Both teams were given
free kicks for offside play. Darsie
started a dribbling rush by going
through for 5 yards and the forwards
took the ball to the California 15.
Erb cross-kicked for the first time,
alter marking at his opponents 35.
At the 30, Stanford was awarded a
free kick. Referee Hill refused to
allow the ball to be cleaned, and with j
Cass holding the clay caked pigskin, j
Erb took one step and drove it square
ly between the uprights. Score, Stan
ford 3, California 0.
After the kickoff play went into
Stanford territory. In a position cor
responding to that from which Erb
had made bis goal, California was
given a free kick. With Morris hold
ing the ball Stroud booted to one
side and below the crossbar.

Partridge relieved the tension by
good dribbling and touch was next
at center. Erb figured in some line
punts, relieving the Cardinal fifteen
with long spirals.
Small gains by the forwards took
the ball to the California 10, and the
lineout took it to the California 3.
California saved a moment later when
Sanborn dribbled over the line. The
Blue and Gold dribbled to their 30 and
here the gun ended the half.
Second Half.
At nine minutes of four, the players
reappeared. There were no changes
in either lineup.
On the kickoff, play went into Cali
fornia territory and there it stayed for
several minutes. . Carpenter replaced
Douglas in the California front rank.
Free kicks were awarded to both sides
in quick succession, and play became
a matter of booting and following up*
the scene of the scrummage shifting
continually.
A dribbling rush by the California
pack carried the ball past Erb and
Cass close to the Cardinal line. Part
ridge was penalized for holding the
ball, choosing this in preference to al
lowing a California try, and Stroud
chose a placement on the 20 yard line.
The goal was an easy one and the
score read 3-3.
Saunders replaced McKim in the
California pack. Play alternately
threatened the danger line of both
teams, and the rooting sections were*
kept in a frenzy. Urban saved for
Stanford when the ball was dribbled
over the line. Cass figured several
times in quick kicks to the sidelines.
Urban got the ball in midfield,
dodged two players and was off down
the field in the one spectacular run of
the day, but the referee called a 40
yard scrum.
The California goal was again
threatened, but dribbling took the
ball back to the California 40.
Thoburn replaced Gard at break
away. Morris booted to Stanford's 35
on a free kick, but the Cardinal drib
bled back to the California 40. Brant
replaced Fish in the California scrum.
Brant was caught offside, and Erb's
boot sent the touch flag to the Califor
nia 40. Here the gun ended the game,
with the scoreboard reading, Stanford
3, California 3.
