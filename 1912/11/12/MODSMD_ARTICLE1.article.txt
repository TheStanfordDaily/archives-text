# NEITHER TEAM CLAIMS LATHROP RUGBY TROPHY
## HONORS OF INSCRIPTION SHARED BY BOTH FIFTEENS. Silver Football Must be Won Thrice to Become Property of Either Institution. 
### 
Although thirty stalwart men fought
valiantly in the slime of Berkeley field
for SO trying minutes last Saturday, the
coveted possession of the magnificent
Lathrop Intercollegiate Rugby Trophy
for the first victory is denied both the
Cardinal and the Blue and Gold lor
another year.
Because the score was tied, tem
porary ownership of the beautiful
trophy will have to await the result
of next year's struggle on Stanford
field. Stanford and Cailfornia prob
ably will have to share the honors of
the inscription on the shield at the
base of the trophy provided to record
the victor in this year's contest. The
university that wins three out of five
intercollegiate contests will take the
trophy to have and to hold.
It is through the courteous benefi
cence of Mr. Charles G. Lathrop, trea
surer of the University, that Stanford
and California will struggle for per
manent ownership of one of the hand
somest trophies ever offered in foot
ball.
Mr. Lathrop's interest in clean
sportsmanship and the individual de
sivn to promote the friendly rivalry
that exists between California and
Stanford, led him personally to donate
the trophy, first hand evidence of his
loyalty to win-or-lose athletics here.
The trophy itself is a novelty. An
exact duplicate of a rugby football in
chased sterling silver, with the stitch
ing, lacings, etc., embossed in faithful
replica, is balanced on an ornamental
pedestal. The silver football weighs
50 ounces and bears the inscription,
Lathrop Intercollegiate Rugby Trophy.
The pedestal is of ebony, and bears
five shields for the five victories, each
framed in crossed laurel wreaths. At
the base of the shield is a broad silver
band, on which will be etched an ac
tion scene from an intercollegiate
game. The trophy cost $150, stands
14 inches high and was fabricated by
Hammersmith of San Francisco.
