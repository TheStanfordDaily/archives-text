# PAINTINGS OF ALUMNUS SHOWN IN OLD STUDIO
## ART LOVERS VISIT WORKS OF E.B. NELSON, '11. Local Views Depicted on Canvas by Stanford Artist Attract Favorable Attention. 
### Professor A.B. Clark 
E. B. Nelson, '11, opened on Satur
day in the old studio, an exhibition of
forty-five paintings and sketches.
Most of the canvasses have been paint
ed since the time of Nelson's initial
exhibit of last March, but a few which
were shown at that time are again
placed on view.
Of the new paintings the one called
"After Sunset" is among the largest
as well as the finest. A large rosy
cloud trails upward into a dappled
sky and is seen through a gap in a
grove of large eucalyptus. To call this
an "Inness" subject is no mere figure
of speech, for it has Inness' large
ness of conception and it is strongly
felt and painted. The "Eucalyptus
Drive" with its shade crossed roadway
is familiar to all Stanford people.
"The Quad in Moonlight" shows a
familiar evening view of the Univer
sity buildings with the orange lighted
arches glowing in a huge ghost-like
mass of buildings.
Among the favorites of last Spring's
exhibition the large "The Trailing
Cloud" is as masterly and delightful
as ever, as are also "September Oaks,"
"The Tree Screen," and others.
Many smaller sketches of the Quad
rangle and its surrounding country,
including some autumn populars from
South Palo Alto, are most excellent
and lack merely the size of the larger
paintings.
To see such paintings as these in
cluding the local subjects, and giving
us the point of view with which an ar
tist with refined and cultivated taste
perceives them, is a distinct privilege,
which should be enjoyed during the
remaining days that the opportunity
is offered.
