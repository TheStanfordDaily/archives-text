The Lathrop Intercollegiate Rugby
Trophy recently presented for compe
tition between the two great univer
versities of the Pacific Coast, is but

another proof of the
interest that Charles G.
Lathrop takes in the

welfare of western college activities,
and especially those of Stanford.
When the subscription was taken up
last spring to send Stanford's Pacific
Coast champions to the regatta on the
Hudson he was the most liberal of the
many subscribers to that fund. It is
such men as Mr. Lathrop that makes
it possible to spread across the conti
nent the fame of the western athletes.
Stanford may be sure of the liberal
backing of its athletics while such men
as Treasurer Lathrop have its best
interests at heart.
