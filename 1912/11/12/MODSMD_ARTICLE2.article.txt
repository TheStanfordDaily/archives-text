# POST SEASON CONTESTS WILL BEGIN NEXT WEEK.
## 
### 
The first step toward the organiza
tion of teams for the post season rugbjl
series was taken today, when K. L.
Schaupp, '12, issued a call for frater
nity and club representatives to meet
on Thursday afternoon. At that time,
a representative from Encina, from
each fraternity and club organization
will form a temporary executive coun
cil for post season rugby. The repre
sentatives will appoint a committee
from their own body which will make
np the teams and will be in general
charge of the series.
The schedule will be arranged by
the last of the week and the first game
will probably be played on next Mon
day afternoon. The number of teams
will be cut down to a minimum, as the
season is short.
The representatives of the frater
nities and clubs will me.et in the officc.
of the Student Adviser on Thursday
afternoon at 1:10.
