# CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATIONS CONFER WITH CALIFORNIA.
## 
### 
Last Friday evening, the represent
atives of the Stanford Y. M. and Y. W.
C. A. met the Associations of the Uni
versity of California in an intercolle
giate conference. Here the members
of both institutions became better ac
quainted with each other and discus
sed and criticised the policies of each
organization, and the practicability of
working the same in their own work.
The meetings were held in Stiles
Hall, the men and women meeting
separately first to discuss the prob
lems which concerned them alone, and
later meeting together for a social
time.
