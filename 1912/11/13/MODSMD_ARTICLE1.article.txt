# RUGBY UNION SELECTS YEAR'S ALL-STAR TEAM
## STANFORD LEADS THE LIST WITH SEVEN PLAYERS. America Will be Represented by Fast Fifteen in Saturday's International Game. 
### 
With seven Stanford players in
cluded in the lineup, the fifteen stars
who will represent American rugby
players in the game against the Aus
tralians were named by the Rugby
Union last night. California came
second with five men in the lineup,
while there are to be two wearing the
"Winged O," and one from Santa
Clara. Three Stanfordites are in
cluded in the list of seven substitutes.
The team was picked by a special
committee of the Rugby Union, com
posed of J. R. Hickey, S. G. Phillips,
and W. Palmer Fuller. The report
was the result of several days of care
ful weighing of the ability of the many
players considered, and was accepted
by the representatives of the union
without change.
The Cardinal players who are to
represent America on next Saturday
are: B. E. Erb, at full; R. M. Noble, at
right, wing; P. F. Harrigan at first
five; F. J. Gard, breakaway; K. L.
Schaupp, middle rank; W. L. Smith,
middle rank; A. M. Sanborn, front
rank. The substitutes list includes the
names of E. F. Kern, at wing; B. A.
Risling as five-eighths; and L. Cass as
half.
Index of Ability.
The team is conceded by Rugby ex
perts to be the best ever named to
represent the United States, and will
undoubtedly force the Waratahs to
their fastest pace on Saturday. The
fact that Stanford predominates in the
lineup is an index to the belief of out
side experts as to the ability of the
Cardinal players.
L. S. Reading was selected as the
referee of the contest. He has offici
ated in coast rugby games for a num
ber of years, and is a familiar figure
on Stanford Field. The game will be
called at 1:30, Saturday afternoon.
The All-Star lineup is as follows:
Sanborn (S), McKim (C), Arrell (O),
Smith (S), Schaupp (S), Gard (S),
King (C), Momson (S. C.), forwards;
Morris (C), half; Harrigan (S), Aus
tin (0), fives; Allen (C), center;
Peart (C), Noble (S), wings; Erb (S),
full.
