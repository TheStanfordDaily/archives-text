# Wear Your Plugs.
## 
### 
About a week and a half ago the
annual upperclass Plug Ugly was

staged. This affair was for
the purpose of initiating the
Junior headgear in order that
thereafter they were to become
the emblem of the third-year

men and that they might wear these
hats with the feeling of class pride.
Instead of this, the new headgear has
been relegated already these several
days to the shelves of their owners
closets or as a decoration upon the
walls. Most certainly this is not fol
lowing out the old custom. Why
christen the plugs if they are not to
be worn? The main purpose of the
Plug Ugly is gradually being lost. Let
us preserve the tradition. Get out your
plugs, Juniors, and wear them till the
semester is over.
