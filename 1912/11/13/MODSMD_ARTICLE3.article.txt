## S.S. McClure Scheduled to Speak in Assembly on Friday Morning. 
### 
Samuel Sidney McClure, publisher
of McClure's magazine, will speak in
an assembly of the students on Fri
day morning. Although the Faculty
Committee on Public Exercises has re
ceived no definite word from McClure
since he arrived in Los Angeles, it is
probable that he will be here to speak
either at the 10:15 or the 11:15 period
on that day.
McClure will talk on "The Cure for
Political Corruption in America."
From his intimate association with
politics as a journalist, McClure is in
a position to discuss every phase of
the subject. He is a native Irishman
and evidences all the humor of his
race as a speaker.
In 1884, McClure assumed promin
ence as the founder of a newspaper
syndicate; but left the newspaper
branch of journalism when he founded
the S. S. McClure Publishing company,
of which he has been the active head
since estabishment.
lie graduated from Knox college and
has been a trustee of that institution
since 1594. He is a member of the
Union League Club of New York City,
the Cosmos Club of Washington, D. C.,
and the University Club of Chicago.
