attention is called to the next im

handsome trophies are to be the
awards of the winners of the competi

All of the men who are to enter the
long race have undergone a physical
examination under the direction of

Five of the cups are to be given to
the first five runners -to cross the
finishing line. The first Freshman to
finish is to get the remaining prize.
The exact course over which the race
is to be run is to be announced later.

tically completed all plans for the big
cross-country event.
