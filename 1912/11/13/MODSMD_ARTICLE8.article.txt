# LARKIN TALKS ABOUT SIBERIAN PRISONERS
## ECONOMICS INSTRUCTOR TELLS OF CZAR'S VILLAGES. Describes His Life in Russian Military Stockade as Political Offender. 
### 
"Conditions in the Russian Prisons"
were graphically portrayed by M. L.
Larkin, instructor in the Economics
department, in a lecture given yester
day afternoon, which is the third in a
series of weekly lectures by different
authorities on prison reform.
"The great number of political
prisoners, largely from the student or
educated class, make the Russian
problem unique," explained Larkin,
who was himself imprisoned in the
land of the Czar for his political be
liefs. The lecturer related his experi
ences from the arrest to his subse
quent escape, giving a realistic im
pression of the Russian prison, or
community as he termed it.
"A Russian prison is a village,"
said Larkin. "They practise self
government, apportioning among
themselves, more justly than the
guard could do for them, such
a luxury as the time each one should
stand by the window for fresh air, and
a food riot must be voted by a three
fourths majority of all the prisoners.
Now View of Life.
The newcomer soon looks upon the
prison as his new home. After a few
weeks he again takes a. positive view
of life; he does not think of his de
prived liberty, but becomes adjusted
to his new scale of life. The Sunday
meal becomes our banquet, the march
to church has the expectancy of our

theatre party."

Reasons why these low conditions
of the prisoner's life should be allevi
ated were then given by the speaker.
He stated that as long as the prisoner
remained in jail the demand that
society be protected was fulfilled,
"while at the same time," he urged,
"it would cost no more to treat the
convict more humanely and to make
his conditions a little more whole
some, which would help many to again
become useful members of society."
Next Tuesday afternoon at 2:30, E.
Whyte, the state probation agent, will
speak in room 214 on "The State
Parole Systemâ€”What it is Doing for
the State, and What is is Doing for
the Five Hundred Men on Parole."
