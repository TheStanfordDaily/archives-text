# UPPER CLASS JOLLY-UP TO BE NOVEL AFFAIR
## GET-TOGETHER SCHEDULED FOR FRIDAY EVENING. Palo Alto Armory to be Scene of Entertainment Planned by Seniors. 
### 
Promising to surpass all previous
attempts at Jolly-up entertainment,
plans for the affair to be held Friday
evening in the Palo Alto Armory have
been completed, and those who attend
the informal are assured of an evening
of novelty. The members of the Se
nior class are to he the hosts to the
Juniors and Holdovers of all classes.
Earlier in the semester the Jolly-up
was first to be a University affah
similar to the one given last spring.
Due to the fact that the 1912 class
held a University get-together during
the visit of the Waratah fifteen, it was
decided to make tomorrow evening's
dance a function for the upperclass
men only. An especial invitation has
been extended to all members of the
older classes now catalogued in the
Holdover division.
Not only will the usual line of
stunts and means of entertainment be
provided, but the committee in charge
has arranged numerous new features.
In fact, so many surprises are assured
that the members of the committee do
not know to a certainty just what will
occur.
The eats are in charge of a special
commissary committee and three ca
terers have combined to provide the
dainties which will be served during
the intermission following the supper
dance. An entirely new plan of ser
ving the large crowd has been de
vised by the committee.
Special cars have been chartered to
bring the dancers back to the campus
at midnight. To assure success in a
financial way, each Jolly-up partici
pant is to bring a half dollar to swell
the fund, in exchange for a name plate.
