# $4.05 SQUANDERED BY HAMMER AND COFFIN
## 
### Society Reporter 
Thirty-five dollars will be added to
the Club House fund by the Women's
Press Club as a result of yesterday's
sales at Wilson's. The campus turned
out nobly to help and the new specials
went like hot cakes. The "Dippy
Smash" and the "Press Club Special"
were particularly popular. The
"Laws" and "Engineers" not only
sampled the dainties prepared for their
especial delectation, but they came
hack for more. One "chatty" table of
engineers demanded to know what
lady-fingers and pears were doing in
their special. (We recommend this to
Chappie.)
Hammer and Coffin came in in the
afternoon, nine strong, and after eat
ing some four dollars worth and dis
playing their usual wit and joyous
ness tipped the exhausted waitress a
NICKEL. On the first two rounds the
society hung together splendidly, evi
dently working on the old adage "In
unity is strength," but it was on the
third round with a ten cent limit that
individual tastes came to light. Who
would suspect Maurice Dooling of a
passion for "Plain Sodas and Phos
phates" at five cents each? And
surely Jimmy Thomas usually con
ceals the fact that he has a fondness
for soft white peppermints. Plain
chocolate ice-cream was evidently the
proper thing as the editor led the way
with that. Mr. Levy negotiated for an
Angel Kiss and finally landed one.
The Women's Press Club thanks the
university public for its cooperation.
