# JAPANESE LECTURER GIVES BRILLIANT PEACE ADDRESS
## ANGLO-JAPANESE WAR SCARES RIDICULED. International Congress of Cosmopolitan Clubs Planned for San Francisco Fair. 
### 
Varsity debater and orator for one
of America's largest universities is the
wonderful achievement of Kinosuke
tnui, surpassing the accomplishment
of his fellow countryman who played
on an American university football
team. His speech on "Japan and
America," given in the Chapel last
evening, would reflect credit on any
university. Inui is pleasing in appear
ance and has an active personality.
Broad minded from contact with
every part of the world, he spoke with
clear English diction which sparkled
with original humor.
I. M. Akahoshi, '13, President of the
Cosmopolitan Club, introduced the
speaker, who began with the broad
assumption that most wars are the
result of misunderstandings, which in
turn he classified as from four sources,
national differences in custom or
thought, misrepresentation, prejudice,
and suspicion.
Misrepresentation.
"Misrepresentation," he said, "is
exaggeration. There are jingoes both
in the United States and in Japan.
Hobson was in Japan just two weeks
altogether, and now he expresses the
opinion that Japan is increasing her
army and navy to seize the Philip
pines. Japan," Inui declared, "would
not take the Philippines as a gift. It
costs the United States $80,000,000 an
nually to govern them, while Japan is
now enjoying her trade with them at
no national expense. If nothing else,
the immense costs would preclude
war. The supremacy of the Pacific is
a fictitious term that works on the
psychology of the two peoples. Busi
ness is the determining factor." The
case of a Japanese jingo who had read
an inflamed account of the recent San
Francisco school trouble, was the ri
diculously portrayed.
Committee Named.
After the lecture, members of the
Cosmopolitan Club remained for a
business session. A communication
from the national body of the Cos
mopolitans suggesting an internation
al students' congress at San Fran
cisco in 1915 was referred for immedi
ate action to a committee composed of
B. M. Clark, '14, I. M. Akahoshi, '13,
and O. H. Castle, '14. This committee
is empowered to decide upon the atti
tude of the local club in regard to this
extensive conference.
