### 
Nineteen Freshmen were last night
granted their block numerals by the
Executive Committee. The award was
based on the showing made through
out the season and not upon the per
formance of one afternoon. The num
i ber of men to receive the coveted
sweaters is one less than last year's
record of twenty, but one better than
the number which were allowed in the
days of intercollegiate freshman foot
ball.
The Freshman ruggers made a very
| creditable showing this year, and
every one of the nineteen deserves his
numerals. Starting the season none
| too auspiciously, the first year team
I gradually worked into shape, and in
their last two games gave a good ex
hibition of rugby.
