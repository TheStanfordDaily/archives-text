# NEW PLAN IS ADOPTED FOR POST SEASON RUGBY
## EIGHT TEAMS TO BE CHOSEN BY VARSITY PLAYERS. Two Veterans Form Nucleus of Each Fifteenâ€”Players Will Not Represent Fraternities. 
### 
A new plan for the conduct of post
season rugby games was adopted this
afternoon at a meeting of the repre
sentatives of Encina, the fraternities
and the clubs. The rugby men con
ferred with the committee appointed
lust night by President Ambrose, and
their proposed plan for making up the
teams for the coming series was ac
cepted.
r lhe sixteen Varsity men who played
on Saturday will be divided into eight
groups, giving the eight teams which
are to be formed a nucleus of two star
players. All of the fraternities, clubs,
eating organizations, commuters, in
short, all groups which contain avail
able rugby material, will be asked to
send in the names of men who will
play in the series. The teams will be
chosen from this list, irrespective of
fraternity or address, by one of the
two Varsity men in each group. In
order to escape the influence of luck
in the order of choice, the Varsity man
who is the last to choose his player is
given two choices, thus evening up
matters.
It is hoped that a sufficient number
of players will send in their names to
enable the Varsity men to choose
twenty men for each team. It is im
perative that the names sent in shall
be men who will actually play, as
their failure to appear at the last
moment will throw out the entire
schedule.
The first four games of the schedule
will be played next week, two of them
to be contested on Saturday, November
23.
J. O. Miller, F. C. Brown, and B. E.
Erb have been asked to act as referees
for the series.
The committee will announce the
schedule of games this week,, and the
referees will be instructed to award
the game by default, if one of the con
testing fifteens fails to arrive on time.
The list will be in the hands of A. H.
Frank, P. H. Harrigan, and L. Cass.
Names are to be handed to one of
these men by Friday evening.
