# Well Won.
## 
### 
Nineteen Freshmen have been grant
ed their numerals upon the basis of
a season's showing. The plan proved

as successful as last year's and
again the Freshmen have made
notable additions to the Var
sity squad. The first-year men

started the season below the standard
of previous seasons, but by the time
the schedule was half finished they
had hit their stride and closed with
an enviable record. Their block "16's"
are well won and they may wear them
with pride.
