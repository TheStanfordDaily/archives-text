We always hesitate to talk price be
cause it means so little unless
considered in conjunction with the
Suit or Overcoat it buys.
W'e have Suits at $50 that are
actually cheaper than most Suits at
$15, and at
$20.00
we have
SUITS
that are in every way tuperior to the
Suits made to order at $35.
At whatever price you buy a Suit
here, depend on it you get a maxi
mum * 112 value for the expenditure.
