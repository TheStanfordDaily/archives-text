Editor, The Daily Palo Alto:
The suggestion made in your edi
torial of November 13 that a post
season Varsityâ€”Santa Clara game be
arranged as a Stanford Union benefit,
is an exceptionally good one, not
necessarily because such a contest
would put the quietus to our neigh
bors' championship claims, but be
cause it would afford the Student Body
an opportunity to see the Varsity team
of 1912 in a real game. As a unit it
lias not appeared during the season
with all its members in action, except
in the first half of the last Olympic
game, and Saturday's contest was just
enough to whet our appetites to nee
them play real rugby. If the game
were to be well advertised there is no
reason why a couple of thousand dol
lars should not be gained for the
Union.
To call for such a game naturally
is to ask the Varsity men for further
sacrifice of time and effort, but that
sacrifice need not be a heavy one.
They would not have to go into heavy
training, lor a few practices next
week would keep them in condition,
and as all of them intend to play in
the inter-club games anyway, it can
not be said that the prospective game
would call for an expenditure of time
which would have been used for
studies.
There may be some reasons not
known to the layman why the men of
the team could not play a week from
Saturday, but they certainly are not
apparent, and until they are made evi
dent the writers do not feel that they
are asking too much of anybody to
play a game that would round off an
almost dissappointing season and to
benefit a decidedly worthy cause.
Possibly Santa Clara would not care
to play, but the chances are that they
would be willing to make good their
recent boast.
"ALUMNI."
