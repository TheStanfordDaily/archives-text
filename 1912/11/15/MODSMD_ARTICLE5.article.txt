# McCLURE SHOWS WEAKNESS OF AMERICAN GOVERNMENT
## 
### 
"Not a major or a chief of police of an American city would be able to
act a job today in a city in Germany."
"Our governmental officials are amateurs in efiiciency but professionals
in seeking 1 and getting improper rewards/'
"If in 50 years America is as well governed as Canada is today, 1 shall be
v>ell satisfied."

With the keen, analytical mind of
the journalist, Samuel Sidney McClure,
publisher of McClure's magazine, in
an Assembly today assailed the weak
nesses of our governmental system
and offered reforms for their eradica
tion.
Publisher McClure affirmed that
America is 50 years behind Europe in
municipal government and quoted
statistics to prove it. Although a Pro
gressive himself, the journalist label
ed the initiative, referendum and
recall ineffective tools for reform
under the faulty framework of the
political system of today.
Seeking first cause for the failure
of American government to keep pace
with Europe, Publisher McClure went
back 100 years in history.
"One hundred years ago our states
men were occupied with the problem
of slavery," said McClure. "And dur
ing the century more new inventions
and discoveries were made than in all
human history.
"These inventions, especially that of
the railroad, brought new problems of
government. While Europe was tak
ing the problem of railroad legislation
in hand, our statesmen were occupied
with the Civil War.
System Grew Fast.
"When the slavery problem went
out, about I he time of Grover Cleve
land's first term, our government
found that it lacked the knowledge
to ileal with the railroads and their
builders. The railroads had formed
the habit of buying franchises from
legislatures and city councils, and a

great system of political corruption
had grown up. This is the first cause
of our political corruption today, the
corruption that we have been fighting
for the last twenty or thirty years."
"Our government is inefficient be
cause it isn't properly organized to
meet the problems of government,"
continued McClure. "Why, the fire
losses in our great cities are seven
times as great as those of Europe in
structures of absolutely the same ma
terial. Why? Because our building
inspectors are bribe seekers and
takers.
"In America, 100,000 people suffer
violent deaths every year. This ex
ceeds the yearly losses in the Civil
War. Eight thousand people are mur
dered every year here, ten times as
many as in other countries of the same
population in Europe.
Inefficiency Cause.
"All this is the product of ineffici
ent government. The effect of govern
ment. like that of Tammany Hall is
as bad as that of the oriental despot.
In the orient young girls may be
burned at the stake in the market
place, but in America they are burned
to death in the factories through in
sufficient fire protection."
"A successful government must be
'Neglect-Proof,'" affirmed McClure.
"Democracy means neglect of govern
ment by the masses. The true func
ton of the masses is criticism and re
straint of officials. But first you have
to have efficient officials.
"Now Germany has organized her
