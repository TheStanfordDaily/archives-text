# SEVEN CARDINAL PLAYERS WEAR AMERICAN SHIELD AGAINST THE WARATAHS
## Tomorrow's International Contest on California Field Promises Best Rugby of Year. 
### 
California Field should have a car
dinal hue tomorrow afternoon, when
the picked rugby players of the
country trot across the ground for
their game with the Australians.
Seven wearers of the Varsity "S" will
be included in the lineup, and three
others will be in the group of substi
tutes.
The concensus of opinion is that the
team which will wear the American
shield on their jerseys tomorrow is
the best that could be chosen from
the country's rugby players. The for
wards are a husky bunch, and if the
field is in the same slushy condition
that it was last Saturday, they should
lie able to hold their own with the
Waratah dribblers.
Sanborn, McKim and Arrell will be
the front rank of the American team.
Smith and Schaupp, whose work in
I lie middle rank seems practically per
fect, will be conspicuous figures in
scrum and lineout. Their weight and
speed will be an important factor in
the work of the pack.
Itreakaways.
Frank Card will be in his place at
breakaway, and the Waratah half,
whether it be Walker or Flynn, will
have to be lightning quick to get the
ball away. The opposite breakaway
will be Momson, of Santa Clara, who
has been playing unusual rugby this
season. "Big Bill" King, of Califor
nia, will hold the pack together, at
lock.
If Jupiter Pluvius is off his job to
morrow. as seems likely at present,
the field will be in fairly good condi
tion. The ground has been worked
over since the intercollegiate contest,
and is dry and fairly hard. With a
dry field the backs will have their
chance. The American backs are a
constellation that may dazzle the
shifty ruggers from Kangaroo Land,
and as they will adopt the Waratah
plan of taking chances, the play will
be fast and exciting. The Australians
in each game impress the rugby fans
with this point of their play—they are
willing to take a chance at all times.
And to beat them the all-stars are
going to tease Luck. too.
Fast Backs.
Phil Harrigan will be at first five
to take the pass from Morris, and the
Cardinal five will be a fast starter in
the line of backs, diet Allen will be
at center five-eighths.
Noble is slated for the right wing
position, with Peart of California 011
(he opposite wing. As the flankers of
a scoring or defending machine, they
are unexcelled.
As the mainstay of the fifteen,
Benny Erb, veteran of four intercol
legiate battles, will play 011 the last
line of defense. There is no more
sure hooter, cleverer dodger, or cooler
player than he. 111 Erb and Dywer
the fans will see two players who are
without rivals for their position.
To enable the Australians to board
the steamer for the north, the game
will be called at 1:30 p.m.

the line of backs, diet Allen will be
at center five-eighths.
Noble is slated for the right wing
position, with Peart of California 011
(he opposite wing. As the flankers of
a scoring or defending machine, they
are unexcelled.
As the mainstay of the fifteen,
Benny Erb, veteran of four intercol
legiate battles, will play 011 the last
line of defense. There is no more
sure hooter, cleverer dodger, or cooler
player than he. 111 Erb and Dywer
the fans will see two players who are
without rivals for their position.
To enable the Australians to board
the steamer for the north, the game
will be called at 1:30 p.m.
California Field should have a car
dinal hue tomorrow afternoon, when
the picked rugby players of the
country trot across the ground for
their game with the Australians.
Seven wearers of the Varsity "S" will
be included in the lineup, and three
others will be in the group of substi
tutes.
The concensus of opinion is that the
team which will wear the American
shield on their jerseys tomorrow is
the best that could be chosen from
the country's rugby players. The for
wards are a husky bunch, and if the
field is in the same slushy condition
that it was last Saturday, they should
lie able to hold their own with the
Waratah dribblers.
Sanborn, McKim and Arrell will be
the front rank of the American team.
Smith and Schaupp, whose work in
I lie middle rank seems practically per
fect, will be conspicuous figures in
scrum and lineout. Their weight and
speed will be an important factor in
the work of the pack.
Itreakaways.
Frank Card will be in his place at
breakaway, and the Waratah half,
whether it be Walker or Flynn, will
have to be lightning quick to get the
ball away. The opposite breakaway
will be Momson, of Santa Clara, who
has been playing unusual rugby this
season. "Big Bill" King, of Califor
nia, will hold the pack together, at
lock.
If Jupiter Pluvius is off his job to
morrow. as seems likely at present,
the field will be in fairly good condi
tion. The ground has been worked
over since the intercollegiate contest,
and is dry and fairly hard. With a
dry field the backs will have their
chance. The American backs are a
constellation that may dazzle the
shifty ruggers from Kangaroo Land,
and as they will adopt the Waratah
plan of taking chances, the play will
be fast and exciting. The Australians
in each game impress the rugby fans
with this point of their play—they are
willing to take a chance at all times.
And to beat them the all-stars are
going to tease Luck. too.
Fast Backs.
Phil Harrigan will be at first five
to take the pass from Morris, and the
Cardinal five will be a fast starter in
the line of backs, diet Allen will be
at center five-eighths.
