This morning's Assembly was a
worthy addition to the semester's
unusual list of credit-

able speakers. When

such speakers as Abd
ul-Baha, Prince Lazarovich and S. S.
McClure address an Assembly, Uni
versity work may profitably be sus
pended. What such men as these have
to say is of value to all. McClure's
topic was a timely one. The ineffici
ency of our municipal government is
a question that it is the duty of every
one to consider carefully. It is the
attitude of the college graduates of
this country that will determine in
large measure the future success of
our republican form of government.
