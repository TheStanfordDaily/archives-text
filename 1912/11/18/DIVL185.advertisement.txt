We always hesitate to talk price be
cause it means so little unless
considered in conjunction with the
Suit or Overcoat it buys.
We have Suits at that are
actually cheaper than most Suits at
$15, and at
$20.00
we have
SUITS
that are in every way superior to the
Suits made to order at $35.
At whatever price you buy a Suit
here, depend on it you get a maxi
mum of value for the expenditure.
