### 
James H. Wallace, a noted Y. M.-
C. A. worker among the Chinese in
Tokyo, talked to a number of Univer
sity men, Sunday, about Christianity
being appropriated by officials and
students of China.
He showed how the student class,
better known to Americans as literati,
has always exerted the greatest
amount of influence over the provin
cial life of China, but that only since
the allies had entered Pekin, in the
Japanese-Chinese war, have the stu
dents determined the reforms for their
positions of leadership.
After the Japanese victory, thou
sands of Chinese students migrated to
Tokyo to learn why Japan had ad
vanced so far. It was among these
students that Wallace worked, and at
Tokyo met Doctor Sun Yat Sen, the
organizer of the revolution.
He proved conclusively that the
work done by the Y. M. C. A. in Tokyo
since 1906 had resulted in a friendly
attitude toward Christianity on the
part of the new leaders, and cabinet
in the new government.
In the province of Yunnan, the new
governor, a former Tokyo student, be
came the honorary president of the
provincial Association, and besides
contributing freely to its work in
money, presented to the Board of
Directors of the Y. M. C. A.a splendid
