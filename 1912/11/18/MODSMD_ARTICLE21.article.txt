# PLANS FOR INTERCLASS DEBATE ARE CANCELLED.
## Sophomores Fail to Sign For Tryouts in Sufficient Numbers to Form a Team. 
### 
Failure of a sufficient number of
Sophomores to sign up for the tryouts
for the interclass debate team has
caused indefinite postponement of
effort to stage the Freshman-Sopho
more forensic contest this semester.
The decision to forego plans for
holding the tryouts Tuesday and Wed
nesday, as scheduled, was reached by
a five to one vote of the intersociety
committee this morning.
Three Sophomores signed as candi
dates for the tryout announced for to
morrow night.
Four members of the Freshman
class showed their intention of trying
for positions on the Freshman team.
The number of debaters required on
each side was at least four, three men
for the team and one alternate.
It is not probable that further effort
will be directed toward staging the
annual interclass debate this year.
