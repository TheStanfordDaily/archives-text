# CARDINAL VARSITY WILL CHALLENGE SANTA CLARA
## 
### 
If Santa Clara accepts the challenge |
of the Stanford Varsity, the two teams |
will meet on the turf in the near;
future. Thanksgiving Day is the pro
posed date for the match. Unanimous
desire on the part of the rooters to
see one of the foremost of Stanford
Varsities in action under favorable
conditions accounts in large measure
for the decision of Coach Presley and
the team members to extend the play
ing season long enough to include
this game. Santa Clara has been se
lected as the team to oppose the Car
dinal for this purpose because of the
championship claims emanating from
the Catholic institution which have so
frequently adorned the sporting pages
of San Francisco journals.
Santa Clara has an excellent fifteen
this season, and should furnish such
stiff opposition as to put the cardinal

jerseyed players through their fastest
paces.
The game was originally planned as
a benefit for the Stanford Union, and
it is believed that this idea will be
carried out. A crowd of football fans
will undoubtedly celebrate the ap
proach of Turkey Day by watching
this fast contest from the bleachers,
and their gate-money should purchase
a few more building stones for the
proposed club building.
Varsity players and side-line men of
the 1912 team will go into light train
ing at once for the contest. Smoking
will be forbidden, but "early to bed"
will not be enforced, and the men will
be allowed to attend dances. At 4:45
tomorrow they will gather at the
training house, where definite plans
for the training season will be de
cided upon.
