# STANFORD PLAYERS STAR IN BRILLIANT RUGBY GAME
## 
### 
Seven Stanford men played in Satur
day's rugby game on California Field,
and there were seven stars in the con
stellation that shone for the Cardinal.
A faster game has never been seen on
this coast, the Waratahs snatching a
I victory from the All-Stars in the last
few minutes of play. The final score
j was 12-S.
The field, dry, level and fairly
smooth, gave the backs a good surface
for fast work. The game was more
open than those the Waratahs had
played, and the eight thousand specta
tors were kept in a frenzy of excite
ment as play surged, drifted or
whirled from one end of the ground
to the other.
The American team was the finest
aggregation of rugby players that has
ever worn the emblem in an interna
tional game, and they played in top
notch form from kickoff to last
whistle. The Waratahs were disap
pointing for the first sixty-five min
utes of play, but when they did wake
up, the score boy was a moving pic
ture of industry. The Antipodeans
registered twelve points in hardly
more than that, number of minutes.
Tommy Griffin, a world beater as a
front-ranker, expressed his opinion of
the All-Star pack, and especially of the
opposing hookers, in no uncertain
terms: "Your pack was extraordinary,
it's good enough to play anywhere."
Augie Sanborn, the Cardinal player
in the front rank, was one of the
I strong factors in that extraordinary
I scrum, and made his mark as a hooker
| equal to the best. He was prominent
| in every ruck play, and rivaled the
j Australians at their own game of
j dribbling.
The work of Smith and Schaupp in
middle rank was perfect, as had been
predicted by those who knew the
I qualities of those two players. As
i Tommy Griffin said, "They're great
j men, heavy, fast, and after the ball
1 every minute." Smith got in two or
three of his startling kicks from the
' ruck, and Schaupp qualified as a
J sprinter when he took a kickoff and

ran thirty yards through a scattered
field.
Frank Gard played the best game
of his career at breakaway. He not
only shot around the scrum in ap
proved style, but he twice got away
from the pack and dribbled the ball
unaided for long gains. His mate,
Momson of Santa Clara, played good
rugby, but was caught offside an in
excusable number of times.
Monte Morris was the half, and
a proper share of the credit for the
backfield work should go to the Cali
fornia player. He is a consistent
player of unusual ability and remark
able "pep."
Harrigan at first five and Noble at
wing were the sensation of the first
half. Playing together as if they were
both fives, backing up perfectly, mark
ing the opposing Waratahs, and get
ting away in runs that, left their mates
behind, the Cardinal backs were di
rectly responsible for the first score.
They were ably seconded by Chet Allen
at center, who played better rugby as
the game progressed.
But the star of first magnitude was
one B. E. Erb, of Chemainus, n. C.
Although he has booted farther on
Stanford Field than he did at any
stage of the game Saturday, the Car
dinal full was caught with the ball


Frank Gard, '14
