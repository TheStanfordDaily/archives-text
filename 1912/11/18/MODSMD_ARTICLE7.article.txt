# MEREDITH TELLS TRUE FACTS OF EARLY KANSAS.
## Is Writing Book to Correct Current Errors on Pre-Bellum Days. 
### 
W. J. Meredith talked before Phi
Delta Kappa, the Education fraternity,
on the subject "The Frontier During
the Civil War," Friday evening. Mere
dith lived in Kansas during the war
and the political disturbances rising
out of slavery agitation preceding it.
He is now writing a book, through
which he hopes to clear up many fal
lacies which are current in our his
tory text-books about this period.
He said in part: "All of our history
books are written in the north-eastern
one-fourth of the United States by men
inconversant with frontier conditions.
Great stress has been laid on certain
characters, who had little or nothing
to do with the developing of the terri
torial government, as its guiding geni
uses. On the other hand, the real per
petrators of it are never mentioned.
To give one example, I have seen the
name of Eli Thayer mentioned only
twice, and that incidentally in school
histories, although he was the head or
the New England Emigration Society,
whose purpose was to bring free-soil
settlers to Kansas, and the leader of
the Anti-slavery forces. I am writing
my book to correct the errors, if
possible."
