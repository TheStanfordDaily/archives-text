# Debating.
## 
### 
A petition has been started by the
debaters of Stanford to have a de
partment of public speaking added to

the University curriculum.
At the present time there
is not a single course

offered in this important field of
modern education, —a regrettable state
of affairs for an institution of Stan
ford's standing. Debating has fallen
to an undeservingly low level among
student activities and were it not for
a few of the most enthusiastic sup
porters of oratory would now be ex
tinct. To achieve success in public
speaking, as in any line of endeavor,
requires work, and this cannot be ac
complished when it is made a side
issue. There are a large number in
the university who would take up an
active interest in debating if sufficient
credit would be the reward, but as it
now there is no incentive to engage in
this work. The petition of the de
baters is deserving of great considera
tion and should receive the hearty in
dorsement of the student body.
