# VOTE IS BEING TAKEN ON TRI-STATE DEBATE TOPICS.
## Stanford Favors "Arbitration" as Subject For Three-Cornered Forum Contests. 
### 
Following receipt of a telegram
from debating headquarters at the
University of Oregon, the Intercollegi
ate Debate Committee voted yesterday
in favor of the question favoring
"Unlimited International Arbitration,"
for the tri-state debates that will be
held in the spring. Second choice is
for the Single Tax question, and third
choice for Immigration.
According to the agreement which
governs the action of universities in
the Pacific Coast Debating League,
each of the three members submits a
proposed question for debate to the
secretary of the league. The three
questions submitted are then voted on
by the league members, and one is
selected by cumulative counting of
votes, first vote counting three points,
second two, and third one.
The arbitration question was sent in
by the Stanford committee. It pro
poses to do away with international
conflict, even in "national honor"
cases.
Suggests Subject.
Oregonian debaters have cast in
favor of the general subject of "Im
migration," which they proposed.
Their second choice is the arbitration
question, and third choice is for the
general topic "Single Tax," suggested
by the University of Washington.
Delay has been caused in selecting
a question for the tri-state debates
because of inactivity of this year's
secretary of the league, at the Univer
sity of Washington. Other members
of the union have had to work inde
pendently of him through the mail, and
it has been hard to come to a definite
understanding.
E. C. Smith, '13, chairman of the
Stanford intercollegiate debate com
mittee, has telegraphed the result of
the local vote to the secretary of the
league at Washington, and has written
to the University of Oregon.
In accordance with the regular cus
tom, each university in the trio will
select two teams, one to take the
affirmative, the other the negative side
of the question adopted for debate.
The affirmative team remains at home
to debate, and the negative team goes
to one of the other universities. This
year the Stanford negative team will
go to Seattle, and Oregon will send a
team here.
