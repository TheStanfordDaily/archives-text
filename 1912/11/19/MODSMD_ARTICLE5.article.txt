# DEBATERS WILL PETITION FOR COURSE IN ORATORY
## Students to Sign Plea to Faculty For New Department-Cause Supported by Statistics. 
### 
Petition will be made within the next
lew days to "Dr. Jordan, the Academic
Council, or whoever has authority to
act in such matters" for the institu
tion of a course in debating at Stan
ford, for which academic credit will
be given.
The petition contains many features
in connection with debating that sug
gest a new departure from the old de
bating regime at Stanford, whose
claim to serious consideration is based
upon statistics regarding collegiate
debating that are formed from letters
received from 2G universities of the
United States.
Members of the local chapter of the
national honorary debating fraternity,
Delta Sigma Rho, and of the various
debating committees, took the work of
gathering material for the petition in
hand. Letters asking a stock type of
eight questions were sent to 30 uni
versities by Delta Sigma Rho.
The petition is to be circulated
among all students who take either an
active or passive interest in debating,
and effort will be made to have at
least MOO signers before the paper is
laid before the consideration of Dr.
Jordan.
Stanford's contemporaries in Cali
fornia have regularly organized courses
of debating, which are conducted in a
manner parallel with other depart
ments in the curriculum. At the Uni
versity of California two professors
devote their time to giving instruction
and coaching public speaking and de
bating. Four professors give such in

struction at the University of South
ern California,where a debating course
of one semester is required of enter
ing freshmen.
The statistics gathered show that
in some universities inducement is
given for men to enter debating
activity, either by remitting a part of
the regular tuition or exempting from
Christmas examinations. At a ma
jority of the universities that sent in
answers, coaching is done either by
members of the faculty or by specially
engaged paid coaches, who are ar
ranged for by faculty supervision.
The meat of the petition is contain
ed in the paragraph which reads: "It
is our desire to have a man to head a
Department of Public Speaking, in the
regular university curriculum, to in
struct in public speaking, oral debate
and argumentation, and to act as
faculty coach for forensic contests."
Further plea is made that men
making the intercollegiate teams be
given university credit, and that such
credit be given but once in a semester
to the same man. The intercollegiate
de' -te- include the debate with Cali
fornia, the Carnot debate with Cali
fornia, and the Tri-state debate.
Feeling is expressed that without
faculty supervision of debating activ
ity, the best results cannot be had from
their work by the now existing stu
dent debating societies. Knowledge
that faculty supervision of debating
existed was considered a point to at
tract the interest of a wider range of
students.
