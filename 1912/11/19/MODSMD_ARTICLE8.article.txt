# Rameses Will Not Ramble.
## 
### 
"Rambling Rameses," the comic
opera produced so successfully by the
Ram's Head society last month, will
not go on tour this season.. B. H.
Laskey, '12, and G. H. Beurhaus, '13,
acting as press agents for the Ram's
Head, signed up Watsonville and Mon
terey but were unable to come to an
agreement with Santa Cruz, and hence
the trip had to be given up. A trip
during the Christmas recess is being
considered.
