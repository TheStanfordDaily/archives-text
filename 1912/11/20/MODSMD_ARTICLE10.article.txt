# Equality.
## 
### 
Stanford has always prided herself
on the spirit of democracy that per
vades the campus, but a decided lack

of this equality is shown at
some of the more important
social functions. The

Sophomore Cotillion, although given
under the auspices of the second-year
students, is an University event, in a
community of this size there are
bound to be those in a position to at
tend such functions in a more elabor
ate fashion than others. But if the
Stanford Spiritâ€”of which we think
social equality is an essential part, is
to prevail, social extravagances will be
relegated to the background. Flowers
and carriages have no place at a
Sophomore Cotillion. The request of
the Cotillion committee to this effect is
a step in the right direction.
