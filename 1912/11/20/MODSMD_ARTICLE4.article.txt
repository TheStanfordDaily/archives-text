# POST-SEASON CAPTAINS PICK TEAMS FOR SERIES
## Eight Groups of Twenty Players Each Will Struggle For Supremacy in Rugby. Two Games Saturday 
### 
Eight teams for the post-season
rugby series were chosen this aftei -
noon by the varsity captains, and the
first two games scheduled for Satur
day afternoon. Twenty men are in
cluded in the list for each team, and
the positions will be filled at the field
by the captain.
The lists include the best rugby
material on the campus, and as the
star players are evenly distributed, the
contests should be fast and exciting.
111 each case the fifteens will be built
around a varsity player as a captain,
and the conduct of the play will be
under his immediate direction.
The committee "have asked that all
men 4 listed practice 011 the field before
their first game, in order that they
may acquire some team-work and
harden up for the series. The train
ing house will be open every after
noon, and Stanford Field will again
become the center of interest for
rugby devotees.
Two Gaines Saturday.
Team 1, under Captain Darsie, is
scheduled to play Team 2, Captain
Gard, on Saturday afternoon, at 2:15.
The contest between Teams 3 and 4
will be staged at 3:15 the same after
noon. F. C. Brown will referee both
games.
The halves are to be twenty minutes,
with a five minute intermission. The
short games will prove the mettle of
the ruggers, without dragging the play
into tiresome lengths.
Teams 5 and 6 will play 011 next
Tuesday afternoon, while the last two
fifteens will settle their differences the
middle of the week. The plan of the
committee is to reach the semi-finals
by Thanksgiving.
The failure of the players to report
on the day of a game will cripple the
entire team, and the captains have
asked that withdrawals or corrections
be reported to the respective captain.
