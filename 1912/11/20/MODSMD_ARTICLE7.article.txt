# STATE OFFICIAL TALKS ABOUT CRIMINAL PAROLE
## REMARKABLE RESULTS SHOWN IN CALIFORNIA. Illustrated Lectures on San Quentin and Folsom to Conclude Series. 
### 
Important facts of the California
criminal parole system were brought
out by E. D. Whyte, State Parole Agent,
in a lecture yesterday afternoon.
Many interesting cases which have
come under his care, together with
statistics compiled by the speaker,
were used to illustrate the workings
of parole.
"Probation before being sent to jail,
or parole afterwards are two reforms
which are commanding attention," said
Whyte. "To be eligible to apply for
parole, a convict must have served at
least half his sentence, and must not
have infringed on the prison rules for
six months. His petition for parole is
advertised in the papers of the county
from which he was sent, to allow any
citizen to give reasons why the man
should not be paroled. With every
evidence before them, the Board of
Prison Directors act on the case."
A(1 vantage of Parole.
"And here," the speaker declared,
"is the advantage of parole. We have
it in our power to partly protect the
paroled men, but are practically help
less in the case of a discharged man
who has to assume alone his great
handicap in beginning life anew, till
the wonder is that these men are not
forced back into crime."
Speaking of its success he said, "The
percentage of men on parole who com
mit fresh crimes is only 1.9 in this
state, while the best figures obtained
from fourteen other state prisons in
this country show 26 per cent. About
16 per cent, are returned for violating
the terms of their parole, and liquor
is generally the cause of their re
turn."
Misdirected Sympathy.
He told of several cases of mis
directed sympathy toward criminals,
largely by benevolent women, which
resulted harmfully, and recommended
cooperation with the parole officers as
the best course. In concluding, he
stated that the State Board of Prison
Directors is the only official body in
control of prison administration.
Next Tuesday evening, a stereopti
con lecture on Folsom Prison will be
given in the Chapel. On Monday, De
cember 2, Ira B. Cross, assistant pro
fessor of Economics, will conclude the
series with an illustrated lecture on
San Quentin.
