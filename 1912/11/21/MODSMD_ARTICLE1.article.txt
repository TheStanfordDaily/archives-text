# ECONOMIST DISCUSSES PROBLEMS OF LABOR
## INSTRUCTOR LARKIN TELLS OF I.W.W. MOVEMENT. Economics Club Meets and Listens to Interesting Address by Member of Faculty. 
### 
The newly organized Economics club
met last evening to hear a lecture by
Instructor Larkin on the I. W. W.
movement. Larkin began by reading
an article from the "Industrial
Worker," their recognized organ, which
showed the attitude of the lower strata
of society toward the capitalist class.
The key-note of it was that the only
way to best the "ruling tryants" was
to organize and oppose them by vio
lence.
Larkin continued: "There are two
methods of approaching the I. W. W.
movement, the sentimental and the
scientific. The sentimental attitude is
held by both sides and arises from ig
norance. You may dismiss the demand
of the I. W. W. by calling him a bum,
but it does not lighten the strike which
he threatens to bring on.
"These men do not pretend to be
banded for the good of humanity, but
solely for their own advantage. The
objection is raised that in this free
country any man can become a capita
list and there is no need of any strife
between capital and labor. The fallacy
in it is that all cannot, and these men
are willing to give up their chances
and devote their energies to securing
better conditions for themselves as
laborers. So to improve conditions,
they unite to act collectively, which is
necessary on account of society's self
ishness. They blame no single em
ployer for the low wages he pays, be
cause they know that if he paid more
he would be driven from business by
his competitors.
"The trade unionist movement grew
up amongst the dissatisfied workers
and brought about many beneficient
changes. The I. W. W.'s wished to
form a union which would include the
unemployed man. These men are also
dissatisfied with the Socialist move
ment, which seeks to control politics,
because of its slowness. Therefore
they have started their movement
which is a combination of trade union
ism, socialism and violence.
"Their violence, however, is of a
non-violent nature. They desire to
enroll all workingmen in their cause
and then to paralyse industry by a gen
eral strike. As William Haywood,
their nominal leader, has said, 'All we
need to do is to go fishing for three
days and our demands will be grant
ed.' Although such violence as that of
the McNamara brothers is not op
posed in principle, the leaders are not
in favor of it, usually because they
think it bad tactics to pursue.
"I appeal to you men not to disre
gard the present labor problems. Take
the side which you think right or
which is advantageous to your condi
tion and follow it with decision."

but it does not lighten the strike which
he threatens to bring on.
"These men do not pretend to be
banded for the good of humanity, but
solely for their own advantage. The
objection is raised that in this free
country any man can become a capita
list and there is no need of any strife
between capital and labor. The fallacy
in it is that all cannot, and these men
are willing to give up their chances
and devote their energies to securing
better conditions for themselves as
laborers. So to improve conditions,
they unite to act collectively, which is
necessary on account of society's self
ishness. They blame no single em
ployer for the low wages he pays, be
cause they know that if he paid more
he would be driven from business by
his competitors.
"The trade unionist movement grew
up amongst the dissatisfied workers
and brought about many beneficient
changes. The I. W. W.'s wished to
form a union which would include the
unemployed man. These men are also
dissatisfied with the Socialist move
ment, which seeks to control politics,
because of its slowness. Therefore
they have started their movement
which is a combination of trade union
ism, socialism and violence.
"Their violence, however, is of a
non-violent nature. They desire to
enroll all workingmen in their cause
and then to paralyse industry by a gen
eral strike. As William Haywood,
their nominal leader, has said, 'All we
need to do is to go fishing for three
days and our demands will be grant
ed.' Although such violence as that of
the McNamara brothers is not op
posed in principle, the leaders are not
in favor of it, usually because they
think it bad tactics to pursue.
"I appeal to you men not to disre
gard the present labor problems. Take
the side which you think right or
which is advantageous to your condi
tion and follow it with decision."
