Efforts are continually being made
for the promotion of clean sport and
the general participation in athletics.
But without some tangible

reward such attempts fail
as soon as the novelty of

the events wears off. This fall, a new
department was added to the athletic
curriculum—that of cross-country run
ning. From the interest manifested
in Saturday's event it seems certain
that this feature has come to stay.
To the loyal alumnus and the mer
chants of Palo Alto who have so gen
erously donated trophies for the com
petition, the success of the venture has
been due. We take this opoprtunity of
expressing our appreciation of the aid
that has been given by the anonymous
alumnus, The Regent, Thoits, Lar
kin Cigar Company, Franklin's Studio,
Ernest Wilson, and the Bank of Palo
Alto.
