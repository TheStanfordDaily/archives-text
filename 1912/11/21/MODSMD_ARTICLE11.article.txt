# Waratahs Lose First Game in North.
## 
### 
The Australian Waratahs were de
feated in their first game with Van
couver yesterday by the score of 6-3.
Playing on a heavy, soggy field, the
northerners had the best of the argu
ment throughout on account of their
effective dribbling. The Australians
excelled on both the offense and the
defense, but owing to adverse weather
conditions were unable to handle the
ball.
