Distribution, habits and variation of
the tree toad are treated in a pamph
let by C. H. Richardson which has re
cently been received in the Zoology
department.
The article enters a field that
hitherto has been treated unreliably.
The tree toad treated, which apparent
ly is peculiar to the American conti
nent, was first discovered in 1854 in
Sonora, Mexico. At the present time
the toad is known to live in California,
Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and
Mexico.
During the last few years the Mu
seum of Vertebrate Zoology at the
University of California has acquired
a number of specimens of the toad
from Southern California, and Richard
son made a study of them to incor
porate in his work.
The scientific name of the toad, Hyla
arenicolor, implies a suggestion of the
peculiar ability of the small toad to
change its color scheme rapidly.
