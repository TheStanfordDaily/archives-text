# INTERCLASS RACKETERS MAKE NOISE SATURDAY
## DRAWINGS HELD FOR ANNUAL TENNIS TOURNEY. Three Rival Camps Will Contest For Court Supremacy of the University. 
### 
Drawings have been made for the
annual Interclass tennis tournament,
which will start on Saturday. Play
will commence promptly at eight
o'clock on the Encina courts. Any
one who is entered and not on the
courts at this time will have to de
fault to his opponent.
The winner of this tourney holds
the championship of the University for
one year. The title is now held by
V. A. Sheldon, '15, who defeated H. S.
Morgan, '12, in the finals of the class
matches last year.
There will only be three classes
represented in the contest as the
Juniors have failed to enter any men.
Six have signified their intention of
playing in the Senior class, three from
the Sophomore class and six from the
first-year men.
Undoubtedly the tournament this
season will bring forth the best ten
nis in the University and will give
the tennis dopesters something to
figure on for varsity material next
spring.
Each class will hold a separate
tournament, in order to determine the
class champion. The Sophomore win
ner will contest with the Freshman
victor for the underclass supremacy
on the courts and the winner will play
the successful man in the Senior
match.
Among the entries are three men
who played on last year's varsity ten
nis team and three who contested
against California in 1911. R. L. Mur
ray, '13, G. L. Shaul, '13, C. S. Grace,
'12, F. S. Pratt, '13, V. A. Sheldon, *15,
and W. N. L. Hutchinson, '15, are for
mer wearers of the cardinal on the
court who will play for the interclass
championship. Among the Freshmen
who have shown a good style of play
ing this year and who look like var
sity men are F. C. Hunter and J. S.
