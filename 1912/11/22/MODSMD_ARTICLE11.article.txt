# Cross-Country
## 
### 
Tomorrow morning will witness the
first real cross-country meet in the
history of Stanford.

While this contest is

not an intercollegiate
event, it, nevertheless, is deserving of
the support of the student body.
Among the eastern universties, cross
country running takes its place along
side the other athletic events, and it
is hoped that this standard will soon
be attained here. The track men have
done their share toward fostering the
event, but the future rests upon the
interest manifested by the university
public. Turn out tomorrow and boost
the meet.
