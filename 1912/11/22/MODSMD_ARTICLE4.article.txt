# FAMED AUTHOR PROPOSES NEW WORLD WITHOUT WAR
## 
### 
A new world order, planning tht
future of the human race, was intro
duced to the students by Dr. Washing
ton Gladden, famed author and divine,
this morning in an assembly.
Dr. Gladden took the subject of his
lecture, "Planetary Politics," from a
book recently published by an un
known English author, and evolved a
scheme to solve the world problems of
statesmen and philosophers today from
the writer's premises.
The speaker presupposed, like the
English author, that a section of the
earth, for instance York county in
England, be suddenly detached and
thrown into space to become a
satellite of this planet, with its three
million population and natural re
sources intact.
The population of this planeticule,
affirmed Dr. Gladden, would then of
necessity have to conserve their re
sources, human and natural, in order
to maintain their existence. The offici
als of the" planeticule would have to
organize all the productive factors to
keep that which they most needed and
do away with that which would not
be absolutely necessary for their very
life. They needs must minister for the
greatest good of all.
!de;i Not Utopian.
Drawing a lesson from the supposed
condition of such a planeticule, shorn
of assistance from the rest of the
world, Dr. Gladden said:
"The idea of a world order to do the
greatest possible good for all people
is not visionary or Utopian. Of course
no economic federation or tribal con
federacy would be possible on this
planet.

"What we want in order to create a
new world order, is knowledge of the
people and the forces and supplies of
nature, both above and under the
earth. Analysis of world conditions
larger than ever before attempted
would easily be possible today. The
recent meeting in Boston of Chambers
of Commerce from all over the world
to discuss world problems of trade,
shows that a new world order is not
Utopian."
"But what would we do with the
races?" asked Dr. Gladden. "Anthro
pologists differ; some would blend
them and some would leave them in
tact. Personally, I am for the integ
rity of the races. The languages?
Should we adopt one of the great lan
guages of today, or one of the univer
sal languages suggested? No people
would consent to any other language
than their own being adopted. To re
duce so rich an orchestra to one in
strument would be a crime. A univer
sal language might retain the beauties
of all.
"Reciprocity has been stamped an
individual obligation, not a national
one. 'Nations,' says a famous states
man, 'will not follow altruistic law;
they must be egoistic.' Now, once
upon a time, fighting was a universal
individual custom. Every man carried
a sword, and many hired assassins to
do work too dirty for their own
weapons. But for the public welfare,
the fighting industry has been made
a state monopoly in the hands of the
courts and police. If we can alter the
code among Individuals why can't we
among the nations?
"The United States every year for
past and future wars, is paying more
money than all the costs of the Pana
ma canal. It is becoming evident to
thinking men that the maintenance of
war relations is bearing heaviest on
the workers. The whole people are
crying out 'Let's be done with it!'"
If any two first-class powers come
to a grapple today, it means that both
are paralyzed industrially," continued
Dr. Gladden, "it takes years of con
valescence to recover from the wounds
received. And what comes of it? It is
impossible to conceive of any contest
in the future between great powers
where the benefits derived would out
weigh the miseries suffered.
"We can't afford today to destroy
the productive workers in our indus
tries, to waste vast sums in dread
noughts that rust in our harbors,
simply to keep peace by being so con
spicuously armed that other nations
will be afraid to attack. The world
can't afford to go on fighting; and to
provide for fighting is almost as bad
as the practice.
"We need this new world order that
we may keep all the wealth of the
world for proper use. Every land to
day is suffering for lack of wealth for
proper use in conserving its resources.
From the waste of war lead paths
direct to the bankruptcy of nations,
the crippling of indivduals and loss of
irrestorable materials."
