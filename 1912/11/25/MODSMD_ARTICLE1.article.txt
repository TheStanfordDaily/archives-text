# DODGE WINS CROSSCOUNTRY RACE IN EXCITING FINISH
## 
### 
Cross-country running as a com
petitive sport between the classes was
auspiciously inaugurated on Saturday
morning with the initial interclass
meet. W. .1. Dodge, '13, covering the
four and a half miles in the excellent
time of 25:6:3, was the first place
man, after a strenuous struggle on the
final lap with .). Is. Cox, '14, and F. L.
Foster, '13, who were second and third
respectively. C. M. Irwin, '10, won the
cup offered for the first Freshman to
finish. G. C. Brainier, '13, by being
the first non-varsity man after the
first three to pass the judges, gained
possession of the Alumnus trophy.
E. T. Worthy, '14, and W. Moore, *15,
were the winners of the two remain
ing prizes. Seventeen of those en
tered completed the long race. The
Seniors get the credit as winners of
the race. 1914 was second, with the
Sophomores and Freshmen next in
order.
"Dad" expressed himself as highly
pleased with the showing made by the
cross-country men, and is confident
that the distance races will be well
taken care of from a Stanford stand
point next spring. He has requested
the men who have been training to
avoid discontinuing the work abruptly
but rather to gradually taper off so as
to prevent any ill effects.
Excellent Marks.
While the cross-country men were
on their tedious journey several ex
cellent performances were recorded by
the track and field men. P. B. Mc-
Kee, '14, set a mark of 10:1 in the
slightly under distance hundred yard
dash. T. Angell, '15, was first in the
GOO yard run in 1:28. The best work
in the field events was that of Fresh
man King, who threw the hammer
134 feet 4V 2 inches.
