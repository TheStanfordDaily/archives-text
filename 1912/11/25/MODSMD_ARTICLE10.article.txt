# BERKELEY HIGH WINS GAME FROM PALO ALTO.
## 
### 
Berkeley High School proved the
stumbling block in Palo Alto's path
of victory, Saturday afternoon, when
they defeated the clever ruggers of the
local school by an 8-5 score. The
game was one of the best that has
been seen on Stanford Field this year,
giving the good-sized crowd a truly
collegiate brand of rugby.
The first score was made by Berke
ley in the second half, when, on a free
kick, M. Forbes sent the ball over for
a goal. Palo Alto rallied, and after a
spectacular rush down field, Lach
mund went over for a try. McGilvray
converted and the score stood 5-3.
Montgomery scored for Berkeley in
the last five minutes of play, Forbes
converting a very difficult, goal.
