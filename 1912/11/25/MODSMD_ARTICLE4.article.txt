# STANFORD WINS IN SOCCER
## LOSES GOLF TOURNAMENT BURNS TEAM OUTPLAYED BY THE CARDINAL STARS. 
### 
Outplaying the clever Hums team,
Stanford won Saturday's soccer match
by a score of 3 to 2. The game was
called at 3:30 on the Gym field.
Greater aggressiveness on the part of
the Cardinal forwards, together with
excellent combination in the backfield,
was responsible for the victory.
During the first half neither side
was able to score, the play being fairly
even. Both goals were threatened at
different times. However, the repeat-
Mi passing rushes of the Cardinal for
wards at the close of this half began
to show Stanford's superiority.
Shortly after the opening of the
second half, Higgins started the ball
down the side line, then centered to
B. Erb, who rushed it into the net for
the lirst score. Again Higgins started
a rush, which was converted into a
goal by Fyfe, Erb, and Pellas. Here
the Burns rallied and kicked to goal
directly in front of the net.
As the half progressed, Newman, un
assisted, shot a fortunate goal directly
from the wing position. Halley ended
the scoring with a goal for Burns, al
though twice more Stanford barely
missed her opponent's net, and once
the ball bounced off the Cardinal
cross-bar.
Stanford played a very much im
proved game, the work of B. Erb
figuring strongly, while Higgins, New
man, and Captain Pellas were promin
ent for their playing. Halley and
Mclntyre starred for the clubmen.
H. W. Maloney is actively engaged
in coaching the men for the second
California contest, to be played here
on the turf field Thanksgiving day.
