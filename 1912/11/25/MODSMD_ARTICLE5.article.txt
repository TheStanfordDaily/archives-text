side golf links, California winning by
four points to two.
The four-ball matches split even, but
California won three out of four two
somes. N, E. Barker, '16, California's
first man, played a wonderful game
and it was largely due to his efforts
that the Blue and Gold was returned
victorious.
In the foursomes Barker and B.
Heath. '16, were ten points behind at
the turn, but managed to pull up on
C. T. Dunham, '13, and E. N. Wright,
'16, and won out by a solitary point at
the eighteenth green. G. I. Wright, '13,
and C. 11. Hayes, '12, won their four
some from T. T. Weldon, '15, and K. B.
Fobes, '15, of California, thus evening
np the match. G. I. Wright won his
match from Weldon. Wright, playing
a steady game, was four up at the turn
and although Weldon won the next
two holes the handicap was too much
for him and Wright finished five up
and four.
