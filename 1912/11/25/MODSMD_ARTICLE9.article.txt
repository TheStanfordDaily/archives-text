# JIMMY THOBURN CHOSEN CAPTAIN OF 1913 VARSITY
## 
### 
Yesterday, James
Harold Thoburn
was chosen by the
sixteen men who
opposed California
011 November 9, to
lead the 1913 Var
sity rugby team.
The captain-elect
is veteran of three
intercollegiate con
tests on the foot
ball field.
Thoburn regis
tered in the Eco
nomics department
in 1909, and that
fall played five
eighths on the

Freshman fifteen that defeated Cali
fornia a-0. The next year he played
wing on the Varsity, and proved one
of the hard fighters on that hard
fighting fifteen. After a year's absence
from the campus, Thoburn joined the
rugby squad this fall, and was named
by Coach Presley as Varsity substi
tute. In the second half of the inter
collegiate contest he replaced Gard
at breakaway and played the remain
der of the game.
Thoburn is one of the most con
sistent players in the Varsity squad,
and can be counted upon to fill the
breakaway positions or any one of
several back-field berths with credit.
Palo Alto claims next year's cap
tain as a citizen, he having been grad
uated from that High school. Phi
Delta Theta is his fraternity.
