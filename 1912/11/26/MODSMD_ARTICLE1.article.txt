The Chaparral will appear in a
Thanksgiving mood tomorrow. Some
time ago "Chappie" told his contribu
tors that it was time to get their
typewriters, pens, and artists' materi
als in a thanksgiving condition of
energy, so he will come onto the cam
pus tomorrow and pass the glad hand
of rejoicing around without favor to
anyone.
Feminine charm of the first degree
insinuates itself from every line of the
"Grace" who sits before a snowy ex
panse of table cloth, carving imple
ments poised, in the drawing called
"(trace Before Meat," by M. A. Oliver,
'15. The drawing is placed on the re
verse side of the frontispiece.
"It All Conies Out in the Wash," is j
a bit of landscape work effectively
done, and is the work of M. W. Allen,
'15, and W. F. Kilcline, '15. Another
full page drawing by Allen, "A Tidal
Wave," gets its pleasing pot-pourri of
tragedy, humor, and very fetching pic
ture of a lady in distress "over" with
a jump.
Other art is served by .1. L. Duff, '13.
M. A. Oliver, '15, M. W. Allen, '15, and
J. Olsen, '15.
Chappie makes editorial note to the j
effect that owing to a recent deartn of j
good plays on the campus, he has de
cided to make his own dramatic ven
tures in the future.
M. A. llagen, '15, has opened the j
new venture with a "melodrama in;
three strikes," that carries a lovelorn'
"hasher" through a proposal scene, a
state of near-opulence, a down-and-j
out stage, and a crashing tableau.
Chippie Gives Thanks.
"Chappie's Thanksgiving" is the
title of a poem from the pen of K. j
Green, '13, which occupies the first
page of the literary department.
Through the scribe, Chappie expresses
gratitude for past, present, and future
conditions, and general joy of living. !
An expository outburst on the sub-j
ject "Eating," by W. F. Kilcline, '15,
carries the reader through an inter-j
esting third of a page of discussion of j
the gastronomic functions, and draws'
a clear-cut distinction between fasti
men and slow women.
.1. W. Howell, '12, has essayed to'
write about "Something," which has,
been described as being a psycholog
ical vagueness. Howell has taken
.three things which might be some- j
thing under various conditions, andj
discloses his convictions in an inter
esting block of bold-face type.
"Chappie Saysâ€”and "A Minute |
Subject," by E. W. Pugh ,'ll, delve
into the solution of a lot of highly I
entertaining nothingness, which may
le something, under Howell's cate- (
gory. At any rate, they offer attrac
tive reading.
"Now That's," this issue, appear in
the number of three, and each contains
a note of solid strength under its jest-,
ing cloak, cap, and bells.
