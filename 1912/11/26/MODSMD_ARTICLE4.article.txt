# THEILE TROPHY FOR THANKSGIVING TENNIS.
## Matches Will Begin Friday Morningâ€” Entries Should be in Thursday Evening. 
### 
Encina courts will be the center of
attraction during the Thanksgiving
holidays, when the annual handicap
tournament for the Theile Cup will be
run off. The tournament is the largest
of the year, and the final matches are
certain to lie well contested.
R. L. Murray, '13, and V. L. Sheldon,
'15, are the two racquet wielders en
tering the tournament with a previous
win to their credit. Both these players
have held the cup for a year.
The handsome trophy was presented
to the University a number of years
ago by F. C. Theile, of Palo Alto, as a
perpetual challenge cup. In 1910 the
winner was W. Dawson, '14, a year
later R. L. Murray, '13, captured the
trophy, and last fall it went to V. L.
Sheldon, '15.
The first match will be played Fri
day morning at 9:00 o'clock, and the
tournament will be run off during the
next two days, weather permitting.
Placards have been posted at the
courts for the names of entries, or
candidates may give their names to A.
Pierpont, '13, R. L. Murray, '13, or
V. L Sheldon, '15. An entrance fee of
fifty cents will be charged.
