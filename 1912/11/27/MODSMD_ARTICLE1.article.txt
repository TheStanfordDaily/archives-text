## ILLUSTRATED LECTURE IS GIVEN BY J.A. DE HASSE, â€™08. Large Audience Hears That the Condition of Folsom is Improved Under New Regime. 
### 
Illustrating his lecture with a num
ber of slides, J. A.de Hasse, '08, spoke
last evening on "Folsoni Prisdn" be-,
fore a large audience in the Chapel. J
During the last few years lie has made
a study of prison conditions in Cali-1
fornia and is now writing a book on:
that subject. Several weeks were
spent by de Hasse in personally in-;
ve3tigating the penitentiary at Fol
soni, nt which time he obtained most
of the views shown last evening.
"1 went to Folsoni expecting to come
away filled with enthusiasm for prison
reform," said de Hasse, "But after two
weeks stay I concluded that the |
present propaganda is more emotional |
than based on facts. There are many
improvements to he made, but condi-1
tions are being greatly bettered under
the new warden."
"The food is plain, but varied and
wholesome," he continued, "and the
recent rumors of dining-room trouble
are false."
Next Monday evening, at 8 o'clock.
Assistant Professor Ira li. Cross, of
the Economics department, will give
an illustrated address in the Chapel
on "San Quentin Prison," which will
conclude the series of lectures on
prison conditions.
