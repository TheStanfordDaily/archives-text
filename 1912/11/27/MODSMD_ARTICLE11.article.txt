Seats go oil sale for the second con
cert given by the Peninsula Musicai
Association on Saturday morning. The

only place that the tickets
will be 011 sale is in Palo
Alto. The reason stated for
tius is that there are not

enough subscribers on the campus to
make it worth while to put them 011
sale here. And this in an university
community. The next singer to be
brought here by the association is a
noted French prima donna and she is
to give her program from the Assem
bly Hall stage. Evidently an apprecia
tion of music among the students
stops with ragtime. It seems to us
that it is about time that something
was done for this. Why not secure
some famous musicians for a morning
Assembly hour? This would give an
added educational value to the Assem
blies.
