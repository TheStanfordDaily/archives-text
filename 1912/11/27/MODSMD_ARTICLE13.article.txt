Editor, The Daily Palo Alto:
The undergraduates may not like be
ing told that the way they sing "Hail,
Stanford, Hail" is "rotten." Rut such
is the dictum of Mary Roberts Coo
lidge, and she wrote it.
"They sing it," she remarked in
Palo Alto recently, "as though it were
a dismal dirge and I wrote the music
to be a sprightly march. It has never
been properly sung at Stanford since
Cleve Raker was leader of the glee
club and yell leader."
The cause of these remarks was
typical of the misinformation and in
difference that I have found so
amazingly rampant in the student,
body. A junior had remarked to nit
in al! seriousness that. Mrs. Stanford
wrote "Hail, Stanford. Hail," and I
was relating the incident to Mrs.
Cool id ge as a good joke, not on her
but on the ignorance of the later col
lege generations as to traditions and

past experiences. For those who may
not know, it might be mentioned that
Mrs. Coolidge, before her marriage t<>
Dane Coolidge, '98, novelist author of
"Hidden Water" and other books of
Arizona life, was an instructor in the
Economics department and took a doc
tor's degree. She has just composed a
great California hymn for the Panama
Fair. When 1 suggested it might be
tried out by the Stanford students I
hesitate to relate what happened.
And Cleve Haker, well, he was an
intercollegiate tennis player several
years, a Zeta Psi, and graduated with
'04. He is now attorney-general of
the state of Nevada.
No undergraduate in the university
seems ever to have heard of Whitte
more, '92, first varsity football cap
tain, as champion mile swimmer of the
United States and all-round middle
western athlete with many gold
medals; of Charlie Adams, '95, who
won seven first places in Stanford's
first field-day, including the hundred
yards, weighed more than 190, was
varsity baseball captain and third
baseman, and played on the first var
sity football team on only one day's
experience at football, and sat up all
night before the game to read Walter
Camp's book 011 football, study the
rules, and commit to memory the in
tricate secret signals of play; or of
Wilbur Edwards, '93, a Sigma Chi, who
established the world's mile record 011
a bicycle by racing the distance in
1:35 2-5; or of Art Humiller, '97, a
Sigma Kho Eta, the lightest man that
has ever made a Stanford varsity, and
yet he was Stanford's greatest of
all second-basemen, second greatest
catcher, varsity tennis player, and
pool and billiard champion of the uni
versity, and president of his class; or
of Abe Lewis, '95, a Zeta Psi, who set
an unrecorded world's record for
three straight jumps, never since
equaled, and scored twenty-three runs
against California during his career
as Stanford's greatest all-round base
ball player, and was editor of the first
Quad. Only casually have they heard
of big Stewart Cotton, '98, a Sigma
Rho Eta, the youngest man that ever
made a Stanford team, playing end
when 16, tackle when 17. back when
18, and fullback and captain of the
28-0 team when 19. graduating just
before he was 20, and scoring a total
of 24 varsity football points, an un
threatened record at either univer
sity.

of big Stewart Cotton, '98, a Sigma

made a Stanford team, playing end
when 16, tackle when 17. back when
18, and fullback and captain of the
28-0 team when 19. graduating just

The undergraduates may not like be
ing told that the way they sing "Hail,
Stanford, Hail" is "rotten." Rut such
is the dictum of Mary Roberts Coo
lidge, and she wrote it.
"They sing it," she remarked in
Palo Alto recently, "as though it were
a dismal dirge and I wrote the music
to be a sprightly march. It has never
been properly sung at Stanford since
Cleve Raker was leader of the glee
club and yell leader."
The cause of these remarks was
typical of the misinformation and in
difference that I have found so
amazingly rampant in the student,
body. A junior had remarked to nit
in al! seriousness that. Mrs. Stanford
wrote "Hail, Stanford. Hail," and I
was relating the incident to Mrs.
Cool id ge as a good joke, not on her
but on the ignorance of the later col
lege generations as to traditions and

past experiences. For those who may
not know, it might be mentioned that
Mrs. Coolidge, before her marriage t<>
Dane Coolidge, '98, novelist author of
"Hidden Water" and other books of
Arizona life, was an instructor in the
Economics department and took a doc
tor's degree. She has just composed a
great California hymn for the Panama
Fair. When 1 suggested it might be
tried out by the Stanford students I
hesitate to relate what happened.
And Cleve Haker, well, he was an
intercollegiate tennis player several
years, a Zeta Psi, and graduated with
'04. He is now attorney-general of
the state of Nevada.
No undergraduate in the university
seems ever to have heard of Whitte
more, '92, first varsity football cap
tain, as champion mile swimmer of the
United States and all-round middle
western athlete with many gold
medals; of Charlie Adams, '95, who
won seven first places in Stanford's
first field-day, including the hundred
yards, weighed more than 190, was
varsity baseball captain and third
baseman, and played on the first var
sity football team on only one day's
experience at football, and sat up all
night before the game to read Walter
Camp's book 011 football, study the
rules, and commit to memory the in
tricate secret signals of play; or of
Wilbur Edwards, '93, a Sigma Chi, who
established the world's mile record 011
a bicycle by racing the distance in
1:35 2-5; or of Art Humiller, '97, a
Sigma Kho Eta, the lightest man that
has ever made a Stanford varsity, and
yet he was Stanford's greatest of
all second-basemen, second greatest
catcher, varsity tennis player, and
pool and billiard champion of the uni
versity, and president of his class; or
of Abe Lewis, '95, a Zeta Psi, who set
an unrecorded world's record for
three straight jumps, never since
equaled, and scored twenty-three runs
against California during his career
as Stanford's greatest all-round base
ball player, and was editor of the first
