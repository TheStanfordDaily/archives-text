# VARSITY SOCCER ELEVENS WILL MEET TOMORROW
## Stanford and California Teams are Primed for Fast Contest, Which is One of Series for Possession of Williamson Trophy. 
### 
For the second time this season the |
soccer elevens of Stanford and Cali- i
fornia will contest on the football <
field when the teams of the rival uni-1
varsities meet Thursday afternoon on 1
the turf field. In addition to its being!
a cup game which will count toward j
the acquiring of possession of the Wil- j
liamson trophy, it is to be a league
game on the schedule of the Califor
nia football league.
in the previous contest, played at
Berkeley on the morning of the inter
collegiate rugby match, the Cardinal
representatives were victorious by a
j to 1 score. Tomorrow the team
which opposes California will be
strengthened by the addition of several
, rugby stars. The same combination
defeated the fast Burns aggregation
hist Saturday. The Burns team is one
of the strongest on the Coast and the
victory of the Stanford men attests
their playing ability.
Six of the men who will play in to
! morrow's contest won their minor "S"
|in the contest with California last
' spring. These men are Captain Pel
j las, Benny and Art Erb, Higgins, Hil
' ton and Butcher. The playing of the
'Stanford eleven has improved with
very game and the team which is to
1 take the field against the Blue and
Gold justifies the confidence which is
J ilaced in it by the student body. Com
petent critics agree that another Stan
! ford victory should be registered in
, this match.
California is to lineup in the same
manner as in the previous contest last
month. The Rangers were defeated
1 y this team by a 3 to 2 score on
Saturday. This is the same score as
that of Stanford against the same
eleven.
H. W. Maloney is to referee the
game. His name was among the list
of available men submitted to the Cali
fornia captain and was immediately
selected. The game will be called as
soon as the championship contest be-
I tween Palo Alto and Stockton high
I schools is completed.

I Contrary to some of the reports,
| there will be no admission charged to I
! t lie soccer game. The management of'
the preparatory school contest has
1 fixed a price of fifty cents as the ad
! mission to witness that game, but this
j match has no connection with the
j varsity soccer game. As the soccer
i game is to begin immediately after the
i rugby match, a large crowd should be
present.
The Williamson trophy, which is to
;.e one of the motives for the game to
morrow, is the gift of C. Y. William
son of the Barbarian club. Under the
terms of the donation permanent pos
session of die cup is to go to the team
which wins the majority of the ten
games which are to be played. Three
contests are to be decided between the
two varsities each year. On Washing
ton's birthday. 1912, the first game was
>layed and resulted in a Stanford vic
tory. The second Cardinal win was
recorded on November 9. Ten games
must lie played before the cup is
awarded permanently. In case of a tie
an additional contest must be played.
The remaining game of the 1912-1913
series is to take place on February 22.
The soccer lineups follow:
Stanford—Newman, Pellas (capt.),
I>. Erb, Fyfe, Higgins, forwards; A.

High Schools Meet.
Preceding the intercollegiate soccer
I match, the high school players from
i Palo Alto and Stockton are to meet
' to decide the A. A. L. championship of
i Northern California. The teams are
! J equally matched and the game will
! serve as a fitting holiday relish. Cap
• i tain Davidson has been putting his
• | men through a severe week of prepara
; tion for the contest and the usual Palo
- A lto high brand of rugby can be ex
i I uet ted. The game is called for two
'clock.
