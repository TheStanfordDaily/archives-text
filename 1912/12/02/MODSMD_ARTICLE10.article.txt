# The 						Right Type
## 
### 
The election of Herbert Clark Hoo
ver, '95, to the Moard of Trustees meets

the popular approval of
the students and graduates
of the University. Hoover
is the highest type of the

American business man, the self-made
man, and takes rank with the foremost
graduates of Stanford. His service to
the University, in fostering the Union
project, is the greatest contribution of
a Stanford graduate to his Alma Mater.
A man of Hoover's type cannot prove
but be a great addition to the Hoard of
Trustees, who have proved such effii
cient administrators of the vast prop
erties of the University.
