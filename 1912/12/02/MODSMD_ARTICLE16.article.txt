# BRINE SHRIMPS HAVE LONG LEASE ON LIFE.
## Wriggling Specimens of Salt Water Life in Zoology Department Have Strange Life-Guard. 
### 
Wriggling about in a Mason jar full
j of saturated sea water in the office of
Professor H. Heath of the Zoology de
. partment, a score or so of small bits
] of life that have the color of a shrimp,
i the size of a sand flea, and the energy
I of a serpent, play tag with each other
i between whiffs of air. The creatures
are known to dwellers in the Zoology
department and in scientific treatises
as Artemia Franciscani. Those of the
lay class who have any knowledge of
them call them Brine Shrimps.
The specimens in Professor Heath's
o'lice were obtained in some salt
water vats near Redwood. The dis
covery of the shrimps at Redwood was
surprising, since they were previous
ly known to exist in this country only
in the Great Salt Lake, Mono Lake,
| and in the water barrels on some rail
! way trestles in the eastern states.
The shrimps are a hardy lot, and
have quite a complete method of pro
tection against bad weather. If con
ditions are unfavorable for the hatch
ing of eggs they can retain the life
inside them for six or seven years.
Some time ago a lump of mud con
taining eggs of the shrimp was sent
to the Mritish Museum from the Red
Sea. The eggs were artifically sur
rounded by unfavorable conditions of
temperature for six years. At the
end of that time ideal conditions were
provided, and a majority of the eggs
were hatched.
