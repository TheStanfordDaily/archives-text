11. L. Hahn, '16, won the Thiele Ten
nis Tournament and the trophy during
the vacation by defeating four oppo
nents, three of whom were veteran
racket wielder.s. The handicap tourney
brought out several new men who have
not appeared heretofore on the local
courts. The matches were close 1
throughout the contest. Many of them j
needed three sets to decide the winner \
and often they ran into deuce sets.
A big surprise was sprung on Fri
day morning when Hahn defeated R. L.
Murray, '13, in straight sets. This was
the first defeat which the premier
player has sustained on the courts this
season. Playing F. S. Pratt, '13, and
CI. L. Shaul, '13, on equal terms, Hahn j
vanquished the former varsity stars,
but needed three sets each time to gain
a hard fought victory. In the final
round lie played Hrown and won the
right to have his name inscribed as the
twelfth victor of the Thiele trophy and
to obtain possession of the cup for one i
year.
