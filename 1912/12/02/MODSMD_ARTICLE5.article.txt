# PROMINENT ALUMNUS IS NOW A MEMBER OF BOARD OF TRUSTEES
## MEETS THE POPULAR APPROVAL. H.C. Hoover, â€™95, "Father of the Stanford Union," to Serve on Executive Body of University. 
### 
Herbert Clark Hoover, '95, "The
Father of the Stanford L'nion," was
appointed to fill one of the two
vacancies on the Board of Trustees of
the Fniversity at the last meeting of
that body. 'I he announcement of the
appointment of the alumnus, who has
shown such a great interest in the un
dergraduate life of the students during
his work in other parts of the world,
has been met with the most hearty
approval on the part of the Stanford
alumni as well as the undergraduates.
Hoover graduated from the Geology
department with high honors, and very
soon distinguished himself and his
University by his work, by which he
has made himself manager, director
and consulting engineer for a large
number of mining companies in the
United States, Australia, China, Corea,
Burma, New Zealand and South Africa.
Although he is but 35 years old, he is
recognized as one of the most reliable
authorities in the world on mining, and
has carried on operations in every
continent o:i the globe.
hi 1909 Hoover returned to the cam
pus, and immediately saw that tlier:?
was- need of a clubhouse, as a common
meeting-place for men of the Univer
sity, for student and graduate, in
which the two might be brought
closer together. He saw that the hotel
service of Palo Alto and the campus
was inadequate for entertainment of
visiting alumni, and that banquets and
annual dinners of the various associa
tions could not be held on the campus,
where they rightly belonged, because
of the lack of facilities. He did not
merely see this need, but started a
remedy for it by subscribing the sum
of ten thousand dollars as the founda
tion for a fund with which to erect a
building suitable for the purpose.
W. H. Newhall, a prominent business
man of San Francisco, will also take
membership with the governing body
at the same time with Hoover. He is
connected with the well-known firm,
Newhall Land and Farming Company,
which has offices in the Newhall Build
ing, San Francisco.
