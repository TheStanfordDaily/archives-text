# VARSITY SOCCER TEAMS BATTLE TO TIE SCORE
## NEITHER ELEVEN ABLE TO MAKE DECISIVE POINT. Thanksgiving Day Match Furnishes Afternoon of Thrilling Sport For Enthusiasts. 
### 
Fated it seems to be that the records
of the intercollegiate contests of ihe
fall season of 1!>1 !i shall show a pre
dominance on drawn contests. Not
content with an equal division of
spoils as far as the points are con
cerned, the fine touch of destiny has
followed up the lead taken on the
eleventh of November and compelled
the rival soccer elevens of the Car
dinal and the Blue and Gold to again
leave the score board with a margin
in favor of neither side. On Saturday
the teams each scored a brace of
goals.
From the opening of the game the
Stanford players took the initiative
and kept the Californians busy pro
tecting their goal line from the press
ing attack. Ihe Cardinal forwards
had things their own way and were
continually in possession of the ball,
but Barbera, the last*defender of the
visitors, showed to advantage in saving
for his team and the work of the Stan
ford players availed little in the scor
ing department.
Captain Pellas and Higgins con
stantly evaded the visiting forwards,
but a chance save here and there kept
the Cardinals from reaching the net.
Mills, captain of California, was the
first to make an impression in the
i scoring column. 11e executed a neat
rush and shot the ball into the Stan
ford net.
Benny Krb Scores.
The Stanford forwards worked the
ball into California's danger zone soon
afterwards. Fyfe, Higgins and Pellas
dribbled the ball to Benny Krb and the
latter equalized the score by kicking
into the net. This ended the scoring
for the half. The remaining minutes
were all in favor of the Stanford eleven
but the clever work of the California
goal guardian saved several dangerous
shots. Newman and Fyfe passed the
ball in continually, but the defense
proved good and long kicks were in
strumental in preventing a score.
Shortly after half time the Stanford
forwards again kept the visitors en
gaged and twice Barbera saved poss
ible points by blocking the kicks of
Pellas and Higgins. The duo were not
to be denied and a dribbling rush car
ried the ball to Higgins who centered
with precision and Erb again was
responsible for a point when he
rushed in to receive Higgin's kick.
After Stanford's second goal the Blue
and Gold eleven suddenly became the
aggressor and took the ball into Car
dinal territory. Cass, Wyant and A.
Krb took matters into their hands —or,
rather, on their feet— and stopped the
advance. A few minutes later Art
Erb was unfortunate in losing a cor
ner shot because of the hindrance of
the goal post. Hilton was injured by
a collision with one of the opposing
players at this stage of the game but
gamely refused to leave the contest
until Coach Maloney found that his
hurt was serious. Williams went in
as substitute hut the line-up was
switched several times, with Erb
brothers and Higgins trying new
positions.
With a settling darkness and a dim
(jutline of the passing day peering over
the edge of the bleachers, Xeedham,
the clever half-back of the California
team, deceived goalkeeper Mutcher by
a long shot which put the two rivals
on an even basis. The Stanford men
made a valiant effort to add an addi
tional point in the last few minutes of
play but the time was too short and
the score remained two all.
The Stanford eleven did not play
ii]i to the standard which characterized
the contest with the Murns team. The
defensive work, although tested but
few times, failed to line up with that
of past games. Moth tcatns gave the
spectators plenty of spectacular play
ing and kept referee Maloney busy
following the play, which was con
stantly moving.
The line-ups follow:
St.iiiU'ord —Newman, Pellas (capt.),
M, Erb, F.vfe, Higgins, forwards; A.
Erb (Williams), Wyant, Cass, halt's;
Hilton, Mlodgett, fulls; Mutcher, goal.
California — Thorpe, Mills (capt),
Dozier, Noreen, Kellas, forwards;
Needham, Miller, Cook, halfs; Shell,
Davidson, fulls; Marbera, goal.

as substitute hut the line-up was

brothers and Higgins trying new
positions.
With a settling darkness and a dim
(jutline of the passing day peering over
the edge of the bleachers, Xeedham,
the clever half-back of the California
team, deceived goalkeeper Mutcher by
a long shot which put the two rivals
on an even basis. The Stanford men
made a valiant effort to add an addi

play but the time was too short and
the score remained two all.
The Stanford eleven did not play
ii]i to the standard which characterized
the contest with the Murns team. The
defensive work, although tested but

The line-ups follow:
St.iiiU'ord —Newman, Pellas (capt.),
M, Erb, F.vfe, Higgins, forwards; A.
Erb (Williams), Wyant, Cass, halt's;
Hilton, Mlodgett, fulls; Mutcher, goal.

Fated it seems to be that the records
of the intercollegiate contests of ihe
fall season of 1!>1 !i shall show a pre
dominance on drawn contests. Not
content with an equal division of
spoils as far as the points are con
cerned, the fine touch of destiny has
followed up the lead taken on the
eleventh of November and compelled
the rival soccer elevens of the Car
dinal and the Blue and Gold to again
leave the score board with a margin
in favor of neither side. On Saturday
the teams each scored a brace of
goals.
From the opening of the game the
Stanford players took the initiative
and kept the Californians busy pro
tecting their goal line from the press
ing attack. Ihe Cardinal forwards
had things their own way and were
continually in possession of the ball,
but Barbera, the last*defender of the
visitors, showed to advantage in saving
for his team and the work of the Stan
ford players availed little in the scor
ing department.
Captain Pellas and Higgins con
stantly evaded the visiting forwards,
but a chance save here and there kept
the Cardinals from reaching the net.
Mills, captain of California, was the
first to make an impression in the
i scoring column. 11e executed a neat
rush and shot the ball into the Stan
ford net.
Benny Krb Scores.
The Stanford forwards worked the
ball into California's danger zone soon
afterwards. Fyfe, Higgins and Pellas
dribbled the ball to Benny Krb and the
latter equalized the score by kicking
into the net. This ended the scoring
for the half. The remaining minutes
were all in favor of the Stanford eleven
but the clever work of the California
goal guardian saved several dangerous
shots. Newman and Fyfe passed the
ball in continually, but the defense
proved good and long kicks were in
strumental in preventing a score.
Shortly after half time the Stanford
forwards again kept the visitors en
gaged and twice Barbera saved poss
ible points by blocking the kicks of
Pellas and Higgins. The duo were not
to be denied and a dribbling rush car
ried the ball to Higgins who centered
with precision and Erb again was
responsible for a point when he
rushed in to receive Higgin's kick.
After Stanford's second goal the Blue
and Gold eleven suddenly became the
aggressor and took the ball into Car
dinal territory. Cass, Wyant and A.
Krb took matters into their hands —or,
rather, on their feet— and stopped the
advance. A few minutes later Art
Erb was unfortunate in losing a cor
ner shot because of the hindrance of
the goal post. Hilton was injured by
a collision with one of the opposing
players at this stage of the game but
gamely refused to leave the contest
until Coach Maloney found that his
hurt was serious. Williams went in
