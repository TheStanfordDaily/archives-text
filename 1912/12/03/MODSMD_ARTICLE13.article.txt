# Don't!

### 
Recently we observed a student in
the Library Reference Room reading
the periodicals. Finally he came to

a magazine, the leaves of
which had not been cut. In
stead of cutting the pages

with a sharp instrument he used the
blunt side of his index finger. The
result was a ragged edged magazine
for the next readers. Such acts of van
dalism are too frequent in the Library.
Nearly every book in the building thai
is used by the students to prepare
their class work contains underlined
phrases and words that happened to
strike the reader's eye. Isn't it about
time that we took a little more care
of the books in the Library? Keep
your pens and pencils at a safe dis
tance from the leaves ot these books in
the future, otherwise leave them at
home.
