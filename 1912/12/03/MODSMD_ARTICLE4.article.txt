# RARE PORTRAITS GIVE GOOD SUBJECTS FOR SCIENTIFIC LECTURES
## PROCESSOR PEIRCE DIRECTS NEW LECTURE SERIES. Harshe Delivers First Talk Tonight. Other Speakers Will be Smith, Abrams and Kellogg. 
### 
A novel series of three lectures of
general interest to the entire student
body will Le given by the Botany de
partment, under the direction of Pro
fessor G. ,1. Peirce.
Hanging in the library of the
Botany department is a remarkable
group of fifteen portraits of famed
scientists, not all botauists, but men
who have attained signal distinction
in every department of science.
This group of portraits, many of
which cannot be duplicated at anv
price, will form the subject of the lec
ture series. Legions of lectures have
been given on the lives of scientific
men; this is not where the novelty
comes in. Neither will the lectures
be reserved to the subject of old en
gravings and etchings.
The unique purpose of the Botany
department is to combine the aes
thetic. the historical-biographical, and
achievement, as suggested and re
vealed by the artists in the physiog
nomy of the men represented in the
pictures.
A preliminary lecture, preparatory
to the series, will be given this even
ing in the Botany lecture room by
R. B. Harshe, assistant professor of
Graphic Arts, on the subject of
"Methods of Portrait Reproduction,"
dealing with engraving, etching, lith
ography and schemes of photographic
reproduction, with special reference
to the library pictures.
The first of the lectures on the in
dividual pictures and the men repre
sented will be by Professor V. L. Kel
logg, of the Entomology department,
on "Huxley," early next semester.
The other two lectures will be by
Professor .1. P. Smith, of the Paleon
tology department, on "Humboldt,"
and by Associate Professor L. Abrams
on "Linnaeus." Other of the great
scientists whose pictures bang in the
Botany library will be introduced in
the lectures.
Last year a lecture series was given
by the Botany department on men
whose pictures are in the library.
President Jordan discussed Darwin;
\stociate Professor W. A. Cooper of
t'.ie German department. Goethe; and
the late Professor Dudley. Asa Cray.
The Botany department began the
collection of pictures soni" years ago,
when a prized portrait of Charle?
Darwin was procured. The collection
has bee . enlarged from time to tine
by additions from private collections
and public sales.
