# PROFESSOR CROSS ENDS SERIES OF PRISON TALKS
## CRIMINALS LEARN TRADES WHILE SERVING TIME. Students Hear Illustrated Discussion of Conditions Among Inmates of San Quentin. 
### 
"San Quentin Prison" was the sub
ject of Assistant Professor Ira B.
Cross of the Economics department in
an illustrated lecture given last even
ing before a large audience in the
Chapel. The address concluded the
series of six lectures on the general
topic of "How We Treat Our Crimin
als.''
Dealing with the facts just as they
are, Professor Cross spoke well of the
present conditions of California crim
inal administration. The work of the
present wardens was especially com
mended, and many false impressions
of prison atrocities were corrected,
while at the same time the limitations
and needed reforms were pointed out.
"There are three theories for pun
ishment," the speaker began, "first
that of revenge for breaking the laws
of society; second, the deterrent effects
of punishment, and. thirdly, there
should always be the idea of reforma
tion of the man."
"The jute mill was established," he
said, "because it did not interfere with
any free trade union, the making of
gunny-sacks being done only by prison
labor. This, however, did not teach
the convicts a trade which they could
apply outside, so the legislature be
gan introducing other trades, as
blacksniithing, carpentry, foundry and
tin work. In as far as possible all
public institutions use these prison
made goods, thus creating quite an
extensive field for them."
Speaking of the prison food he said,
"It is to be regretted that very bad
conditions have existed in the past,
but at present such rumors are en
tirely unfounded. The food is plain,
to be sure, but is wholesome and
varied, comparing favorably with many
boarding houses."
"It is a noticeable fact." he con
tinued. "that the health of the majority
of men improves under the regular
conditions of sleep, meals, and exer
cise."
