# JAPANESE SQUIDS PLASHED BY STANFORD GRADUATE.
## 
### 
Squids, or devil fish of Japanese
coast, waters, are the subject of a
recent report to the Academy of
Natural Sciences of Philadelphia by
S. S. Berry, '09.
Most of the data used in this report
was obtained from the collection of
octopi and notes made oh the Jordan
Snyder expedition to the waters of the
Japanese Empire in 1900. Berry had
access to the findings of the party in
the Zoology department.
Berry has made scientific studies of
the devil fish, or cephalopoda of the
Pacific Coast, from the waters of tht
far north to those of Lower Califor
nia. and of the Hawaiian Islands.
Classification of the cephalopoda of
Japan has lead Berry into a compara
tively new field of study.
