three five-year renewals at the sole
option of the company. This acreage
will form but one of the live large
seed ranches operated by this concern,
the others being in the San Juan

fifty laborers, mostly Japanese, in the
planting of the seed. During harvest
time it is probable that as many as 150
men will be employed in the field.
