# "The Power of Perseverance."

### 
Under the above caption the New
York Sun recently published an edi
torial on the late Homer Lea, ex-'Ol,
which we reprint in this afternoon's
paper. The account is well worth the
reading, in fact it reads more like a
romance than truth. With poor health
and a crippled body. Lea accomplished
more in life than the majority of the
more sturdy members of the human
race. To him must be given a large
share of the credit in carrying the
Revolution in China to a successful
conclusion. As an author he takes
high rank with the greatest writers
that Stanford has produced. Such a
man is a credit to the nation.
