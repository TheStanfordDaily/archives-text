# NEW YORK SUN PAYS TRIBUTE TO THE LATE GENERAL HOMER LEA
## 
### 
A decade or so ago a weak and frail
lad was a student at Stanford Univer
sity. He was but little over five feet
tall. He was a hunchback. His
health was bad. Nature had thrown
innumerable obstacles in his way, but
bad endowed hini with a sturdy will
and the power to stick. His fellow
students used to laugh when this lad
asserted that he was going to be a
general in the Chinese army. They
noticed, however, that he was always
talking with the Chinese servants and
learned their language. He amazed
his instructors with his knowledge oi
ihe great campaigns of Hannibal and
Napoleon. He held nil history of wars
at bis linger tips.
When lie was about to graduate lie
was stricken with smallpox and it
seemed that he could not recover. lUu
he did recover and immediately sailed
for China to join the Boxer movement.
Two years later he was a lieutenant
general in the reform army and a price
was set 011 his head by the Imperial
Government. He became the confi
dential military adviser of Dr. Sun
Yat-Sen. When Sun was elected Pro
visional President of the Republic, the
hunchback was the commander-in
chief of the Republican forces. On
him devolved the difficult duty of the
reorganization of the army. Hut his
frail body could 110 longer stand the
strain. On the third attack of paraly
sis he was forced to relinquish his du
ties and sailed for home. So, after a
career which reads like a romance, at

Los Angeles General Homer Lea pass
ed into the great silence.
He found time in his active life to
publish a book which aroused two con
tinents. "The Valor of Ignorance" did
more to awaken in this country a coin
prehension of the necessity of prepara
tion for war than any other book ever
did. The author presented his facts
so clearly, he was so well informed, he
so evidently knew what he was talk
ing about, that military men, while
criticising his work in many directions,
were stirred to action by it. It was
widely read by people who are inter
ested in our national life. Lately he
published a second volume, which was
really a continuation of "The Valor of
Ignorance." He was also the author
of some novels. If a weak, frail hunch
back could accomplish so much what
right have strong men to complain of
a la.'k of opportunity in this day and
generation? Homer Lea's life seemed
to have been lived to prove the old
adage, "Where there's a will there's a
way."窶年ew York Sun.

He found time in his active life to
publish a book which aroused two con
tinents. "The Valor of Ignorance" did
more to awaken in this country a coin
prehension of the necessity of prepara
tion for war than any other book ever
did. The author presented his facts
so clearly, he was so well informed, he
so evidently knew what he was talk
ing about, that military men, while
criticising his work in many directions,
were stirred to action by it. It was
widely read by people who are inter
ested in our national life. Lately he
published a second volume, which was
really a continuation of "The Valor of
Ignorance." He was also the author
of some novels. If a weak, frail hunch
back could accomplish so much what
right have strong men to complain of
a la.'k of opportunity in this day and
generation? Homer Lea's life seemed
to have been lived to prove the old
adage, "Where there's a will there's a
way."窶年ew York Sun.
