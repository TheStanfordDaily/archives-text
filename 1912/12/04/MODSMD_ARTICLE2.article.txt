# NEOPHYTES INITIATED BY SKULL AND SNAKES.
## Past and Future Brought to Mind in Presenting Five Courses of Indigestible Messes. 
### 
Reveling: in the past and looking
forward to the future with eager anti
cipation, six initiates, representing a
five-course 'dinner, were publicly tried
out by Skull and Snakes this morning
The initiation took place at the Law
steps and in front of the post-office.
Those who executed the roles in the
Christmas Carol entertainment and
were admitted to the honor society, are
J. Thoburn, '13, W. P. Darsie, '14, E. B.
Hall, '14, VV. R. Finney, '12, C. Smith,
'11, and W. L. Smith, '12.
Wallowing in mud that resembled
the California field, the six formed a
scrum near the Law steps and had a
genuine rugby contest with a brick
for a ball. Scrum after scrum occur
red at the same spot until the first
half was called and the dusky, smeared
warriors retreated to the training
house for further instructions.
The second act was the night before
Christmas. Each of the entertainers
hung up his miniature sock above the
improvised fire-place in front of the
Quad. Kris Kringle Smith took the
socks down and was later seen filling
them at the post-office. Here a
Christinas Carol was rendered , up
holding the motto "Yule Like Us if
Yule Watch Us."
