# ENGINEERS APPRECIATE TALK OF ONWARD BATES.
## "Give More Than Value Received," Slogan of Grand Old Man of Profession. 
### 
Onward Hates, past president of the
American Society of Civil Engineers,
addressed a large number of students,
chiefly engineers, last evening in the
Chapel. The subject of his talk was
"Gossip from an old Engineering
Gander to the Goslings."
"High up among the professions, in
honor and in usefulness to humanity,
stands Engineering," said Bates. "I
place it near to the ministry and the
profession of medicine. Perhaps the
educator also precedes the engineer
in importance. In this connection I
will say that I can't see how you can
get the high class of men which you
have here at Stanford and at other
schools to instruct engineering, when
they could receive far higher salary
and more pleasing experiences
through practicing.
"In your' chosen profession, there
are many choices of work. You will
not be given much choice at first. But
when you get a position don't give only
value received, but more. Do more
than is required of you and do it
thoroughly, and you are bound to suc
ceed in the most pleasing of all pro
fessions."
