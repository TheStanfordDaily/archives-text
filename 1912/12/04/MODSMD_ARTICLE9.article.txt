# DAN CARROLL WILL ENTER STANFORD NEXT SEMESTER
## AUSTRALIAN RUGBY VISITOR ON HIS WAY HERE. Impressed With University, Waratah Player Decides to Register After Christmas Vacation. 
### 
Having definitely decided to enter
Stanford next semester, Dan Carroll,
member of the all-star Australian
rugby fifteen which recently visited
this section and was the guest of the
Stanford Student Body for ten days, is
now in San Francisco after journey
ing southward from Victoria, where he
bade boil voyage to the Waratahs now
on the high seas bound for the land
of the Southern Cross.
Carroll played wing for his team and
was one of the best rugby opportunists
who has yet appeared on the local
field. The Australian visitor was
much impressed with Stanford univer
sity and made his intention of return
ing to take up work here known just
before the fifteen left for the series in
the north. Before taking passage for
the north with the Australians, Car
roll made arrangements for register
ing after Christmas and sent to Aus
tralia for his credentials. Because of
an injury received during the game
with the American "All-Stars" he has
been compelled to view the games with
the northerners from the sidelines.
In an interesting letter to friends on
the campus, Carroll gives the follow
ing account of the matches in the
north:
"We were fairly beaten in two games
here, but absolutely robbed in yester
day's game against Victoria, on a fine
dry ground. Such passing and run
ning as our fellows exhibited, I have
never seen before. Though the rushes
were faultlessly executed, the referee
invariably decided that a forward pass
had occurred.
"Victoria was not playing us in tliis
game, however —they were playing
Vancouver, who had previously de
feated us. Even their own local papers
admit that the better team lost.
"We were very short of forwards
near the end of the game, Prentice
being compelled to play breakaway
himself, to complete the eight.
"We may not have delivered the
goods in America as we were expected
to do, but the finish of the "All Star"
game on California's field, and again
yesterday, made me feel proud to call
Australia my native place.
"All of the fellows send their best
to the Cardinal squad. Stanford will
always remain to them the brighest
star in the American firmament."
