You are perfectly safe in buying
your clothes of the store that the
best dressed man patronizes, be
cause i'i providing for the wants of
our regular trade we naturally
gather the same kind of clothing
for tlie new customers that we hop:
to make.
No ready-to-wear clothing store,
and surely no merchant tailor, lias
the great number of well-dressed
men on its books that this estab
lishment has.
