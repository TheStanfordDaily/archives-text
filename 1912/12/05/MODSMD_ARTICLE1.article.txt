# STANFORD NAMES TOPIC FOR TRI-STATE DEBATE
## TRYOUTS FOR TEAMS HELD IN FEBRUARY. Immigration Question Submitted to Vote of Other Members of Debating Union. 
### 
The Stanford Intercollegiate Debate
Committee has selected the subject
"Resolved, That the United States
Should Adopt the Australian System
of Educational Qualification of All
Immigrants," which has bee.i sub
mitted to the secretary of the tri
state debate union. The general field
of argument, "Immigration,' was
chosen some weeks ago by the cumula
tive system of voting of the three uni
versities that compose the Pacific
Coast Debating Association.
Each of the other two members of
the debating union has submitted a
definite debate topic chosen from the
general field, and the questions will
be sent to Stanford, Oregon, and Wash
ington within the next few days for a
vote. Each university will cast a vote
for each of the three subjects as fir.it,
second, and third choice, and the ques
tion that receives the largest number
of votes will be used in the debates,
which are to be held at each of the
universities in the spring.
Tryouts for the two teams that ara
to represent Stanford will probably be
held in February, in th * same way that
the tryout for the team that meet*
California is chosen. Aspirants to
tha teams will choose the side they
wish to support, and will be arranged
in squads for the testing debate.
Four men will 1 e selected to co n
pose two teams of two men eac'i.
The first and third man chosen will
form the tea n that will l:e sent to
Washington to take the negative of
the del ate question. The second and
fourth man will remain at Stanford
to support the affirmative in the de
bate with Oregon. The tryouts will lie
timed to follow the first general set
of mid-semester examinations, and
about five weeks will then remain for
practise.
Under the Australian system, which
the Stanford committee has advocated
as the topic for debate, the immigra
tion o r cial 5 are giv n complete power
to decid;' which are welcome hone
seekers < u their shores, and which
are not. If an applicant for admission
has the auicarance of "good material"
for the citizenry, he is often passed
without question. Otherwise he is re
quire 1 to successfully write twenty
words in any European language from
dictation. It follow* that an ignorant
immigrant from th:» south of Italv
would stand little chance in an exn n
ination in Dutch or French.
