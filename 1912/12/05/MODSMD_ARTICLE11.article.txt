# Friends.

### 
Another examplification of the
friendly athletic relations between
Stanford and the University of Cali
fornia is the joint smoker to be given

to the intercollegiate rivals.
Such occasions as these
cannot but help to increase

the goodwill between the two univer
sities. This is the climax of a seasoi.
of the closest of friendly relations,
during which the two teams played to
a tie in their great annual game and
a week later a fifteen picked mainly
from their ranks played together like
a group that had been practicing to
gether during an entire season. We
are glad to again extend our compli
ments to both teams.
