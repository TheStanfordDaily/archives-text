# SHINE, POLISH, TONIC: WHICH WILL YOU HAVE?
## Standish and Behrens Are Initiated to Press Club in Five Act Entertainment. 
### 
From the soles of their feet to the
tops of their heads, the Press Club
neophytes attempted various phases
of business enterprises this morning to
the delight of the University public.
Executing a five-act entertainment
during classes, A. M. Standish, '11. and
E. C. Behrnes, '14, were initiated into
the Press Club.
As guards they protected the sacred
realms of the Bookstore and stopped
business in the utility shop during the
B:ir> period. Later, as advertising
agents, they were the forerunners of
the real show which was presented
during the morning.
They polished the "gent's" shoes
and attempted to polish the ladies'
shoes "to boot." Since the profits
were small and the work arduous, the
initiates set up a new profession.
Standish as the physic wonder and
Behrens in the role of mediator were
able to display to the audience many
marvels.
The "bald truth" was discovered at
the post-office steps when Professor
Wigge Standish grew a crop of hah
in five minutes by using his magic
restorer.
