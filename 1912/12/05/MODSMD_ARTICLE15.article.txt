# May Run Special Stanford Train.
## 
### 
Officials of the Southern Pacifu
company are now on the campus book
ing names for the holiday travel be
tween the university and the homes
of students. If the results obtained
by the agents promise sufficiently
heavy passenger traffic to the South,
a special train will be made up to
leave Palo Alto ten minutes ahead of
the "Lark," Friday night, December
20.
