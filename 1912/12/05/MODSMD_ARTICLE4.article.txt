# 1912 VARSITY GOLF TEAM AWARDED MINOR EMBLEMS
## Sport Not Placed on Secondary Basis but Sweaters Are Awarded-Quads May Be Sent to all High Schools in State 
### 
Although golf was not placed upon the minor sport basis, the four Stan
ford men who composed the team which lost to California in the tourna
ment of November 21} were awarded (he Circle S, the minor sport emblem,
last evening by the Executive Committee. C. H. Hayes, '12, C. T. Dunham,
'13, and E. N. Wright, '16, are the four who represented the Cardinal. No

precedent was set by the Committee
last evening, and it is optional whether
or not future Varsity golf players re
ceive the sweaters.
The 1914 Quad, and all future Junior
Annuals, will le sent to high schools
and preparatory schools throughout
the state, if the proposition submitted
by S. J. W. Sharp, '14, manager of the
class book, to the Executive Committee
last night, is accepted. It is held that
the presence of the Stanford year book,
with its review of the student activi
ties, in the library of every high
school, will spread the name and fame
of the University among future college
men and give much publicity to the
institution, which would otherwise be
lost. Sharp wants the Committee to
purchase the Quads and have them
sent out. The matter was discussed
at length last evening but no formal
action was taken. From statements
made, it is probable that the plan will
be adopted.
Final decision or the Quad question
will le made at next Wednesday's
meeting. In the meanwhile, a list of
the high schools will lie prepared.
Relinquish Interest.
In order to help place the Palo Alto
Building & Loan Association on a firm
basis, the Executive Committee de
cided last evening to relinquish all
claim to interest on the Student Body's
deposits for six months. This is part
of the plan being adopted by the de
positors of the defunct organization.

write to the manager of the Glee

for the fobs to the Executive Com
mittee for approval.
