# CALIFORNIA CLUB WILL ENTERTAIN VARSITY MEN.
## 
### 
Members and side-line men of the
1912 Stanford and California Varsities
will be the guests of the California
Club tomorrow evening at a smoker
in the club's quarter-- at California and
Powell streets. While the affair is
planned only as an informal "get to
gether" for the rugby men of the rival
universities, the eatables and smok
ables will be so flavored with novel
"stunts" as to make the evening's en
tertainment a striking one. The Stan
ford Varsity men and substitutes will
attend in a body, and most of them
will meet Louis Cass, '13, at the Palo
Alto station in time to catch the train
leaving there for San Francisco at
6:29.
