## WRITER BELIEVES STANDARD OF DAILIES IS RISING. John D. Barry, of the San Francisco "Bulletin," Gives Pointers on News Writing. 
### 
With a wide experience in journal
ism and an author of repute, John I).
Barry lectured in the Chapel yesterday
afternoon under the asupices of the
Press Club. Outlining the kind of
training most useful to students who
look forward to journalistic or news
paper work, he gave as his maxim,
"See clearly and think straight, and
of these two it is perhaps more im
portant to see clearly. Some of the
old newspaper men used to make it
a point to he superficial. They con
sidered it a Quality, but these men are
now crowded out by those who look
for the facts and find the truth."
"A little knowledge of everything
no longer suffices. The successful
newspaper man must have a thorough
foundation. Take all the psychology
and all the sociology you can," lie
stated emphatically.
The importance of a high moral
standard was touched on by the
speaker, "Because," he said, "it is not
merely a matter of influencing an
audience filling Dreamland Rink, but
the paper is read every day by a far
greater audience than can assemble in
a building. The college man's stand
ard is greatly influenced by bis sports,
and the American attitude toward
sports is comparatively low."
"In the newspaper world there are
two standards," he continued, "the
newspaper standard and your own
personal standard. Don't let your own
standard become degraded. However,
the yellow press is not so yellow as it
used to be."
Hearst was quoted as having said,
"Before you can persuade the people
to read what they ought to, you must
let them read what they want to."
The dropping away from the sensa
tional in the Hearst papers was cited
as significant of the general tendency.
