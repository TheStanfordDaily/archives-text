# Consideration.

With considerable regularity a re
quest has to be issued to the enthusi
astic amateur athletes on the Row

to be more careful
about the indiscrim
inate dropping of

footballs upon the heads of passers-b>
or the driving of baseballs with their
threatening whiz within too close
proximity to the hearing organs. This
may be allowed when the pedestrians
are men, but when women are passing
they should have the right-of-way over
any and all athletic paraphernalia.
By this we do not advise that all
exercising on the lawns and streets of
the campus should be discontinued,
but that an intermission be called lie
fore the lunch hour when the most
people are passing. This is a courtesy
that should be extended to the majority
on behalf of the minority.
