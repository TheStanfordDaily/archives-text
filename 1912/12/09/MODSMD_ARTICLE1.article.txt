# HYDRAULIC DEPARTMENTS EQUIP NEW LABORATORY
## Annex to be Completed for Mechanical and Civil Engineering Students by Next September. 
### 
When Stanford opens in Septenibei
of 1913, a new hydraulic laboratory
fitted with the best, equipment for
best instruction in that subject will be
opened to students in Civil and
Mechanical Engineering. Work has
already been commenced by Contrac
tor Ross of Palo Alto, who built the
eating clubs houses, and will be com
pleted in time for the machinery to be
installed before the students return
from their summer vacation.
The building, which will be virtually
an annex of the Mechanical Engineer
ing laboratory, will be located at the
place where the old power house used
to stand and will cover over half an
acre of ground, the floor space being
divided into several rooms. Provi
sion has been made for a power
hydraulics laboratory, a laboratory for
testing of materials, and a lecture
room.
At present, little is done in this line
in the university except theoretically,
and with this equipment Stanford will
l e able to offer to undergraduates a
course in hydraulics equal to any given
in the country.
The cost of the building will be ap
proximately $30,000, and the equip
ment will costa like amount.
