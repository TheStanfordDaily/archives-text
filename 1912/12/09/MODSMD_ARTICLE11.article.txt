# A 						Blunder.

About two months ago we published
a story to the effect that the Univer
sity Organist would give six recitals

per week upon the organ
.in the Assembly Hull.

This was the start. Now
we print the announcement today that
because of the desire of continuing the
above-mentioned recitals by those in
control of the University's policy, that
all classes in music now being given
in the University would be dropped at
tliÂ« end of the semester. It may be
fine to hear the great, swelling tones
of the organ come thundering forth
from the Assembly Hall, daily, except
Saturday, but we do not think that
thi* should justify the deprivation of
approximately one hundred and fifty
students from studying music while
at the University. It seems to us there
must be an error in issuing such an
order. If too much work is being re
quired of the organist, let's omit the
organ on week days and have a grand
concert on Sunday. Let the one hun
dred and fifty students have the bene
fit of his time during the week.
