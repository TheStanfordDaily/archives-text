# PROSPECTS ARE BRIGHT FOR WINNING CREWS NEXT SPRING
## Captain Partridge Has Unlimited Material To Work Into a Matchless Eight for the Intercollegiate Regatta. 
### 
Prospects that the 1913 crew season
may add two more victories on the
Oakland estuary to the long list of
wins for the Stanford varsity and
freshman crews were never brighter
in previous 'ears.
While the lots of three of the men
who rowed in the 1912 shell is re
gretted, Captain J. H. Partridge ,'l2,
lias unlimited material at his disposal
to build ui> a winning varsity. R. H.
Seward, 1912 captain, and F. W. Wick
man, '14, did not return to college this
fall. C. Smith, '11, is ineligible for a
seat in the 1913 boat because of the
five-year rule. R. W. Olmsted, '13, is
the only man whfl might be lost
through graduation. He will receive
his degree in February.
However, I'. P. Clover, '1 1, and E. B.
Wolt'ord, '15, both rowed in a Stanford
varsity shell on the Hudson in the
I Poughkeepsie regatta and will be in
a position to make a strong bid for
: places in the 1913 boat.
The 1915 freshman crew that
| brought the eighth consecutive victory
ito the Cardinal last spring, fairly
; liristles with prospective varsity can
didates. These men, with those of the
1911 class that rowed in their fresh
< man year, will provide lively competi
tion for the 1913 varsity.
Full Training.
Captain Partridge's call for candi
dates for the 1913 freshman crew
brought out 38 men. These men have
worked faithfully in the tedious train
ing of cross-country running and
machine practice of this fall. As soon
as practicable after the opening of
next semester they will be taken to
Redwood for their first trial on the
water.
The University of California has en
tered into training for the regatta this
year with greater determination than
ever before to break the series of de
feats by the Cardinal. Although Cali
fornia has adopted a stroke patterned
after that of Cornell, the fact that the
Blue and Gold crew is attempting to
learn a new sweep without the assist
ance of a coach who has put it into
uiccessful practice, is not bothering

Captain Partridge or his assistants.
It is generally admitted that the suc
cess of the Cornell stroke is not due
so much to the stroke itself as to the
ability of Courtney as a coach. Cali
fornia modified their stroke last year.
The nucleus of the 1913 Stanford
varsity will lie men who rowed in the
Poughkeepsie regatta against live of
the best coached crews in the world.
!I i; evident that these men, captained
by Cartridge, who stroked the eight on
the Hudson, will enter the intercol
legiate regatta next spring with the
best possible experience behind them.
The Executive Committee is seeking
to provide every possible facility to
assist in training winning crews in
1918.
\>M Shell Shipped.
I). \\ r . Burbank, graduate managei,
ha:; ordered the new shell shipped here
from the East. This shell, which was
manufactured by Sims, of Putney, Eng
land, arrived in New York too late to
be used in the Poughkeepsie regatta.
Through the courtesy of Columbia, the
Stanford eight rowed on the Hudson
in a Blue and White shell.
The new boat should arrive here,
bailing accidents, in about a uiontn.
It will come across the continent by
freight. The first shell ordered last
year was crushed in transportation
across the isthmus of Panama, and
Graduate Manager Burbank was forced
to cable to England to notify Sims of
the non-delivery of the shell and the
necessity of a new one to fill the order.
New Pair Ordered.
Bnrbank also has ordered a new
pair of Rogers in Oakland. This boat
will be delivered here about January
15 and will be used in pitting indi
vidual candidates against each othei
to test their "slugging" ability.
In addition, the Executive Com
mittee is considering the purchase of
four new rowing machines of the latest
improved hydraulic pattern. These
machines have a delicate and certain
adjustment that permits them to set
for any required "pull," a feature that
makes them especially desirable for
early indoor work.
