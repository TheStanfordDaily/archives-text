# CAP AND GOWN PLANS PRE-PANAMA EXPOSITION
## Carnival Will be Given in Zoology Building During February for Women's Clubhouse. 
### 
February, 1913, will see a Pre-
I'anama Exposition on the Stanford
campus that will prove a formidable
rival to the great exposition which is
being planned by San Francisco for
1915. Cap and Gown is the governing
body of the affair, and the Women's
Clubhouse will be the direct bene
ficiary.
The Exposition will resemble in
many respects that given for the Club
house two years ago, which proved
very successful. The Zoology build
ing and adjoining laboratories have
been donated by the Board of Trustees
for the occasion, and the greatly in
creased iioorspace which will be
afforded will enable the entire college
public to participate.
The lower floor will be occupied by
the booths conducted by the different
sororities and clubs, representing the
nations, while the upper hall and
rooms will form the Midway, with
varied attractions. A nickel dance
will be one of the money-makers.
Concessions Assigned.
Roble Hall will take charge of tut,
Midway and its attendant features.
Roller coasters, refreshment counters,
and several unusual attractions will
all help to gather the nickels.
Kappa Alpha Theta will have
charge of the Dutch Chocolate room.
Kappa Kappa Gamma will trams
form one of the corners into a
Turkish Bazaar, offering coffee and
Oriental sweets.
Delta Gamma will fly the colors of
the Far Fast, presiding over a Jap
anese tea booth.
A great attraction will be a snappy
one-act play, which the Alumna have
been asked to manage.
Indian Land will be represented b,\
Delta Delta Delta, while Dixie, with
darkie minstrels and clog-dancing,
will be the Gamma Phi Beta booth.
Madrona will bring Esquimax from
the frozen north, and Pi Beta Phi is to
import pretty dolls, with pastry and
candy, from "Gay Paree."
The ladies of the faculty have been
asked to conduct the New England
booth. The Hawaiian group will be
brought to the Stanford Quad for the
evening by Mariposa Club, while Rus
sian dancers will be the attraction
offered by Alpha Phi.
La Liana promises a surprise in the
attraction to be staged, and refuses to
divulge the nature of their "greatest
show on earth."
Italy will be there, costume and all,
with the Langworthy club as stage
directors. Spain, with castenate and
tamales al fresco, has been purchased
outright by Alpha Omicron Pi.
Cap and Gown has offered a prize
for the most attractive booth, the
award to be made at the conclusion of
the fete. A chairman for each house
booth has been appointed and these
are to form a committee which will
meet with Cap and Gown to perfect
the plans made.
