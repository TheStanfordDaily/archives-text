## Article on Stanford Athletic Outlook is Contributed by "Dad" Moulton. Literary Features Strong. 
### 
Tomorrow morning the December
"Sequoia" will be sold on tlie campus.
Two well-written articles on phases
of Stanford athletic activity, one un
usually good story, and two other
good ones, a charming idyl, and a bit
of delectable verse comprise the
literary department.
"The History of a Crime," a story
of settlement work in a squalid
Italian district of San Francisco dis
closes the atmosphere of its setting
with a realism that is cumulative in
effect. Miss Marjorie Tisdale, '15, the
author, has dressed the theft-plot with
skill.
"Dad" Moulton,' Stanford's veteran
trainer, in a page and a half descrip
tive of "The Athletic Outlook at Stan
ford," maintains that the Cardinal
athletes are entering a Golden Age.
lie characterizes the athletic outlook
as being the brightest in history, and
remarks the fact that many men have
signed up for a great many sports this
year and are interested in the work.
Cross-Country Itiilining.
E. C. Behrens, '14, contributes at.
article on "Cross Country Running,"
which favors the long run because of
its help as a part of the training for
track men. Conditions around Stan
ford are spoken of as ideal for the
cross country run, and suggestion is
made that Stanford and California
might inaugurate intercollegiate runs
to good advantage.
"The Voices," an idyl of diction so
soft and delicate as to flow like music,
appears under the name of Miss
Dorothy Clunnell, '14. The voices of
the mysterious world reach two
children in the quiet of a sheltered
garden and call them rrom the play
ground, heavy with the scent of
(lowers. The songs and speech of the
children and their mother, and the
goodbyes given uy the brother and
sister, as they start from the garden
gate into the long, white road of
mysterious attraction, are laden with
a charm of fine perception and sense
of proportion that make "The Voices"
the strong feature of the issue.
M. T. Dooling, '11. in "By the Same
Door," tells a fast moving and inter
esting story, after warning his readers
that "truth is stranger than fiction."
That is all true, but we don't see much
written truth after all, since Dooling's
story has the earmarks of fiction.
Gordon Gassaway, '13, has written
a story called "The Best That is in
Us," which carries a well treated
theme to a satisfactory conclusion.
The story tells of the reclamation of
the son of a cafe entertainer by a
parched and painted woman who had
known her and considered her "on the
square."
The only verse in the issue. "The
Mission of San Juan Capistrano," by
Agnes Kendrick, '15, is a visional
revery before the dark walls of the
old mission, and is effectively done.
Editorial comment touches the
question of the wet field at California
on November 9, and cheating in ex
aminations, among other items.
