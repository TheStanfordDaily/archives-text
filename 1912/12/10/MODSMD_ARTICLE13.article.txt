# HEBREW SCHOLAR TELLS OF JUDAS MACCABAEUS.
## Says Repulsion by Hebrews of Hellenic Influence Had a Vital Effect on Posterity. 
### 
"Judas Maccabaeus," the Hebrew
who saved Hebraic learning for the
Hast after a struggle with Antiochus
which extended from 168 to 165 B. C.,
was the subject of a lecture given in
the Chapel last night by Israel Abra
hams, professor of rabbinical litera
ture at Cambridge University, England.
Maccabaeus' repulsion of the wave
of Hellenic influence with which Anti
ochns hoped to submerge the culture
of the Hebrews, was shown to have
saved Palestine from the mastery of
the pagan Greeks, and left a soil for
the later growth of Christianity.
Many slides were used by the lec
turer to show the centers of learning
and culture in the East that were in
volved in the struggle of two mighty
men, one trying to force Greekism ab
solutely, and the other trying to pre
serve a balance of influence. Slides
of Alexandria, Tyre, and Antioch were
thrown on the screen.
