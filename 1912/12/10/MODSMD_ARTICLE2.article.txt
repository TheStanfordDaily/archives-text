# TRACK PROSPECT PRESAGES VICTORY FOR STANFORD ATHLETES NEXT SEASON
## 
### 
Of the men who took points for
Stanford in the 1912 meet with Cali
fornia, twelve are registered in the
University and will compete again
next semester. They are: J. A. Miller,
'13. E, M. Bonnett, '15, E. P. Campbell,
'13, W. J. Dodge, '13, F. J. Gard, '14,
J. W. Richdale, '14, E. F. Kern, '13,
R. L. Murray, '13, W. M. Argabrito,
'13, R. W. Brown, '13, W. R. Finney,
*12, and V. G. Stephens, '13. B. Wal
lace, '12, member of the winning relay
team, will probably be buck also, al
though he has not been attending col
lege this semester. J. E. Woolley, '12,
a. four star man, will be ineligible be
cause of the four time competition
rule. H. .1, Smith, '11. another point
winner last season, is not eligible to
compete because of the five year
ruling.
It is very probable that the ranks of
the trackmen will be augmented by,
the registration of several more excel
lent performers on January 7.
The Mile Hun.
In the mile the Cardinal will have '
R. L. Murray, '13, who annexed third '
last year. California will depend upon
captain Wood who was forced to ac
knowledge defeat before the wonderful
run of Hill Fletcher who set a new
record at 1:28:2. Stanford will have
Wilson, the phenomenal Freshman
miler from the north and a likely
representation from the ranks of last 1
year's squad. Price is another "S",
man who will be eligible.
Sprinters of the first rank have been
prominent as point winners for Stan
ford for several years. In the century I
McKee is the pick. He has covered
the distance in 10:1 during the fall
season. In the 1912 meet an eleventh
hour injury prevented him from en- j
tering the meet. Captain Campbell ,
may also decide to enter the shorter
races. R. W. Brown, winner of third 1

'Our prospects this year are much better than they were last year.
One reason for tlis is that greater spirit is shown by the men. A
greater number have been out this season for fall training than ever
before. We are particularly weak in the weights and the high jump.
However, it" George llorine returns it will, make chances much
brighter. Cross-country running has been especially bcnclicial for
tire distance men and strengthens our prospects for two-milers.
Freshman material as a whole is better than any material which
entered Stafford since I have been here. I do not positively predict
a wiiiuiiEg team, but one that will make a good showing and one of
which the students will be proud. There is absolutely no chance un
less every one comes out and helps develop a winning team."â€”"Dad"
Moulton.

place in the two-twenty dash last year,
has shown marked improvement and
is to be counted upon as a worthy
opponent for the Blue and Gold
sprinters. From their showing thus
far It. E. Needham, 'til, and L. W.
Harrington, 'lti, seem to be the best
of the first-year sprinters.
"Dad" has not had such an array of
promising men in the timber topping
brigade for many years as will answer
his call next semester. Whitted,
world's interscholastic record holder
for the high hurdles, Kern, who has
already won bis letter in this branch
of competition, Templeton, F. S. Mur
ray, Norton, former Palo Alto High
stars, and Urban, will give any aggre
gation something to worry over when
the final points are to be distributed.
Good Quarter Men.
Captain Campbell was a point getter
in the quarter mile dash last season
and will again be a contender. Mc-
Clure did not compete last year but
is one of the fastest four-forty men
in this section and has been doing
light training this fall in anticipation
of the big meet next April. G. E.
Needham, '13, C. T. McAleer, 'lfi, and
\V. 11. Stammer, '14, have also shown
to advantage during the past semes
ter.
When the two-milers are lined up
for the word to start on their long
journey the hopes of Stanford will be
placed in a representation which will
do credit to any college team. The
results of the cross country work of
the large squad of men who trained so
faithfully will be more in evidence
than on the day of the first annual in
terclass cross country meet. Here
again Stanford is to have an entry
who lias already won an "S" in this
event. W. J. Dodge, '13, winner of
three points last season, is the veteran
who will represent Stanford. J. B.
Cox, '14. F. L. Foster, '13, G. c. Bran
tier. '13, C. M. Irwin, '16, W. Moore,
'15, winners of cups in the cross
country meet, will furnish a nucleus
of a likely two-mile entry list.

Strong in Half.
Bonnett showed his heels to the best
of the California half-milers in the
880-yard race in the last intercollegi
ate and should be considered among
the first place men of the Cardinal in
prospecting for next season. E. T.
Worthy. '14, T. Angell,*'ls, G. Wood,
'13, and D. L. Narver, '14, are four
aspirants who will be among the
fighters at the finish when the rival

universities meet on the cinder path
next spring.
Of the four relay men who estab
lished a new intercollegiate mark for
this event in 11)12, two, F. J. Card, '14,
and .1. Richdale, '14, are still in col
lege. Bruce Wallace, '12, a third
member of the quartet and the runner
who covered his distance in 49:3, is
expected to be back after Christmas.
The ranks of the relay runners will
be augmented by the addition of a
worthy contingent of aspirants who
have not yet won recognition on the
track. "Dad" has a habit of develop
ing men for this event and it lias been
one of the favorite means of increase
ing the Stanford scores in past years.
In the weights the present indica
tions are none too bright for Stanford.
But California can not claim a veteran
array of talent in these events be
cause of the loss of Rice and Hale.
V. A. Sheldon, '1">, V. L. King, 'l(i, C. A.
Chiles, '14, and E. 15. Wolford, '14. give
great promise of developing into avail
able point winners.

Tlie Pole-Vault.
Pole vaulters will surely do their
share toward a Cardinal victory if the
indications of ability shown in the
two meets of this season are reliable.
.1. A. Miller, who has been a point
winner in two previous big nieels, is
to again be an entrant in the altitude
climb. Stephens, who came in for a
division of the spoils in the last inter
collegiate pole vault last season, is
also eligible. From the 191G class R.
Krohn, .1. E. Philips and F. Macumber
seem to be the most promising vault
ers. In an early meet the trio cleared
the bar at eleven feet. E. M. Hall, '14,
and C. E. Hoyle, '15, both of whom
were prevented from competing in the
last meet because of injuries, will
again compete.
W. M. Argabrite. '13, and 1). Dawson,
'15, should be able to arrange for a
favorable balance of points in favor
of the Stanford athletes in the decision
of the broad jump. The former
scored a third in this event last year.
M. E. Hurley, '15, has done the best
work of the newcomers.
W. R. Finney, '12, is the best of the
high junipers, lie is a consistent six
foot juniper and will better the even
mark before the next big meet. Fresh
en Dingley and Norton are two other
candidates who give great promise.
