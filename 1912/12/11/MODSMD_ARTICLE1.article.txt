# WILL DISCUSS PROBLEMS
## University Conference Plans Open Forum Meeting to Ascertain Sentiment. 
### 
A distinct departure in student bodj
assemblies will le instituted by both
the men and the women at the begin
ning of next semester. Simultaneously
but separately, the men and women
students will conduct open forums for
the purpose of discussing the prob
lems which the University Conferencs
and the Women's Conference will have
to meet and lake action on during the
coming and succeeding semester.
The Women's Conference as yet has
not taken definite action arranging
for the proposed assembly but in all
probability will consent to a meeting
of women students such as that ar
ranger! by the Conference for the men.
The object of the separate assem
blies is to promote a frank and open
discussion among the students assem
bled of some of the questions which
come up to the C onference for action,
and to ascertain the sentiment of the
stiu'ent body on such questions.
Under the present system, the Stu
dent Council reports to the University
Conference, of which it is a part, once
every two weeks. The University Con
ference makes no report to the stu
dents as a body and has no way of
ascertaining the sentiment of the
whole student body other than outside
discussions the individual members of
the body may chance to hear or take
part in.
Expression Desired.
The Conference desires that the
student body be thoroughly cognizant
of the problems that arise under the
present system of student control and
wishes an absolutely frank expression
of opinion from the students in order
that its actions may reflect the senti
ment of all the students. This is the
purpose of the assembly.
The reason it has been deemed ad
visable for the men and women to
meet separately is to make the dis
cussion as open and free as possible.
While the problems of both the Uni
versity Conference and the Women's
Conference are to a certain extent the
same, and the interest of the whole
student body, there are certain phases
of lhe problems of both bodies that
would meet with a much more frank
expression of opinion if discussed by
the organization*, as separate bodies.
The men students will meet in the
as e.nliy hall for the discussion at an
early date next semester, and the wo
men students will probably assemble
at the same time in the chapel.
The obligation of student control
will be explained to the new students
while the reiteration of the duty of the
others to the University and the Con
ference will not be wasted.
