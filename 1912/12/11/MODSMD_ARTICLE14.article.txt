# Time and Books.
## 
### 
Last night the bell announcing the
close of the University Library sound
ed ;it twenty-one minutes to ten. And
this occurred with the final

examinations ready to start
on the morning of the fourth
day following. Of course the

hands of the Library clock
pointed 10 a quarter before the hour,
but that is the customary performance
of the aforesaid timepiece. With the
semi-annual time of trial so near it
would be much better and in fact it
ought to be a faculty ruling that the
Library doors remain open at least an
hour later.
At the same time, it would meet the
popular approval of the users of the
books if better service could be secured
behind the counter. Too often does it
happen that a student waits ten or
fifteen minutes in line for a book, only
to he told that the particular work lie
desires is out. Let's have an assistant
or two more behind the desk, if the
present force is inadequate. The
Library should cater to the wants of
the students.
