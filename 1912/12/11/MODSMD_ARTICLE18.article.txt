# TEXAS TOMMY TRAVEL IN TROLLEY TRY-OUT TROUBLES THE TIMID
## 
### 
Timorous spinsters, faint-heart
ed femininity, and philosophical
investigators of physics, fearful
of the fate following the violation
of the laws of gravity and centri
fugal force, have of late relied
upon ambulatory aid to traverse
the tree-lined turnpike across the
sheep-fields to Palo Alto. Auda
cious adventurers still dare death
daily on the conveyances of the
careless corporation controlling
the local street railway known as
the "Paleekarz."
The Embarcadero extension of
our municipal system necessitates
new trolley chauffers. To ac
quaint them with their arduous
duties, they have been entrusted
with the transportation of cam
pus commuters. As a conse
quence, Paleekarz gallivant gayly
down the grade at varying veloc
ities and rotate rapturously in the
Texas Tommy swing 011 I he curves
disregarding momentum, sudden
stops, and tangentially thrown
trinkets. Three tonsorial stays,
six sets of artificial dentistry, a
garter, and four syllabi have been
ruthlessly torn from astonished
students as the car cavorted 011
the curve. Thankfully, these trol
ley tryouts will soon cease.
