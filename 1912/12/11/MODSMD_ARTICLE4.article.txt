To each of the California universities
will return in 1913 unusually strong
groups of experienced rugby players.
On the Stanford turf will be seen in
Suits at least seven of the men who
battled against California this year,
together with one Varsity rugger of a
year ago, an Australian star, and nine
veterans of the side lines. California's
list of possibilities includes eleven
men who won a "C" in 1912 and at
least six substitutes of last season.
.Many Veterans.
The Stanford veterans who are now
ready to announce their intentions of
pursuing their studies and the pig
skin in the shadow of the red-tiled
roofs next year, include Cass, Urban,
Risling, Darsie, Gard, Thoburn and
Hall of the 1912 Varsity, Frank, an
"S" man whose injuries kept him out
of the lineup this year, Reeves. Wat
kins, Clover, Andrews, A. Erb, Sin
clair, Hrown and Peck of the side line
brigade, and Tilton, substitute half in
1911. The ranks of this sjtellar group
will be swelled by the addition of Dan
Carroll, the brilliant Australian wing,
who, if his own intention is not frus

trated, will add bis name to the illus
trious roll in the '-'bawl-out" next
semester.
At California the returning members
ol the original 1912 lineup will be
Peart, Dills, 1 lazeltine, King, Fish,
Fleming, Hoskins, Miller, McKim and
Douglas. Saunders, who replaced Mc-
Kim during the Big Game, will be
back, as will substitutes Mogardus,
Gianelli t Crane, Hill, Hayes and
Abrams.
Ruck field Strong.
In the backfield this assures Stan
ford ten experienced candidates, Cass,
Urban, Risling, Thoburn, Carroll,
Reeves, Andrews, A. Erb, Hrown, and
Tilton. Kern's return is problem
atical. while Erb and Noble are cer
tain losses. With such a wealth of
experienced material and many aspir
ing players, largely underclassmen,
who made a consistent struggle this,
year for a block or German "S," the
center and wing positions should be
adequately filled, while Ray Hrown is
a fullback whose remarkable possibili
ties only began to be realized during
the latter portion of last season. In
the forward division Darsie, Gard,
Hall, Watkins, Clover, Sinclair, and
P"ck will be hard pressed by numer
ous players who have not yet won
Varsity recognition. Frank has signi
fied bis intention of returning to help
with the coaching, but it is not certain
as yet whether he will be able to don
a Cardinal jersey with the team.
The return of Hly and Decius is
uncertain. Either ineligibility or
graduation make the 1912 season the
last appearance of Partridge, Schaupp,
Smith, Sanborn, Corbet, and Lull.
Promising Season.
Thus each of the rival University
teams will have a strong nucleus of
returning stars. The 1913 season
should see intercollegiate rugby re
suming its progress toward the ideal
of its supporters. On the basis of re
turning veterans neither Stanford or
California can be conceded a decided
advantage at this stage of the game,
and victory in 1913 will depend on the
developments of the season.
