# WHY THE FIELD WAS WET
## 
### 
The editorial in the last issue of the
"Sequoia," commenting upon the fail
ure of the University of California
authorities to properly cover the field
before the intercollegiate game, and
upon certain rumors to the effect that
the water on tlie held was not all the
contribution of Jupiter Pluvius, today
called forth a statement and an ex
planation from Graduate Manager NV.
L. Donald of the State University.
Editor, Daily I'alo Alto:
A member el' your stall' brought into
tlie ol'lice this al'ternoon a copy oi' the
Sequoia, in which was an editorial
entitled "Water Wagon." lie asked
a statement in regard to the truth of
the article. The article is too ridicu
lous to answer.
W. L. DONALD,
Graduate Manager A. S. C. C.

The above statement was procured
today by a special representative of
The Daily Palo Alto, who visited
Student Body officials at California.
Graduate Manager Donald's explana
tion of the failure of the California
authorities to cover the field is as fol
lows: "The storm broke during the
night of Saturday a week before the
game. It was impossible to get the
canvas in time, as it is the property of
the Pacific Coast League. The field
having thus become soaked, it would
have done no good to scrape it and
cover it afterwards."
Clare M. Torrey, '13, President of
the Associated Students, and J. L.
Simpson, '13, Editor of the "Daily
Californian," also remarked that the
editorial is "too absurd to answer" but.
declined to make signed statements.
