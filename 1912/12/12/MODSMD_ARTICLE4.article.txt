ink.
.1. L. Duff, '13, opens the contest
with a good panel picture on the back
of the frontispiece. He didn't give it
a name, so much can't be said in praise
of it without cracking the joke that
goes with it.
Two drawings by M. NV. Allen, '15,
are well innoculated with the fun
germ, the one called "All is Over
Between Them," getting "it" over
specially well.
"The Christmas Graduate," a pen
and ink girl who combines a good
many qualities of the Graces, is the
work of Miss Dorothy Egbert, 'lb.
Chappie has observed his custom of
diffusing a page of feminine charm
somewhere in his makeup.
E. E. Manning, '13, is responsible
for an illustration of a new-fangled
| game of "horse-shoes" that will carry
a smile.
"The Firing Line," and"A Riot of
I Color," by M. A. Oliver, '15, cover
! three-quarters of an interesting page.
Other art work is contributed by
Miss Margery Bailey, '14, E. E. Man

Christmas, excluding himself from
hearing of solemn bells or rolling an
thems, and sight of colored window
mines, is sung by Karl Green, '13. on
first page. The verse is well done.
"Dilettante" in this issue is the best
j we have seen this semester, and we
j would like to .give praise to someone.
But in the marked "dummy" that was
I used to write this review from, the
name of the author was left out.
"Verse and Verse," by 11. V.
' Stewart, '10, occupies four stanzas of
j highly entertaining nothingness, and
so I'nlfills the desire of the writer.
A pessimist's view of Christmas
giving and receiving is written by E.
W. Pugh, '11. lie contends that in
presidential election year, campaign
cigars should le used at the proper
time, and not saved over for Yule-tide
presents.
"Owed to Dad" is a very enjoyable
half column of rhymed prose that was
conceived and executed by K. Green,
'I It glides along at a cheerful rate,
and has a surprise in every line.
"Christmas comes but once a year,"
L. S. Levy, 'OS, says at the outset.
Then lie gives a sixteen line inventory
of undesirable things that Christmas
