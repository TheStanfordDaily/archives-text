# SEVEN VETERANS WILL REPORT FOR BASEBALL
## OUTLOOK FOR WINNING NINE IS GOOD Captain Z.A. Terry, '14, and Coach J. D. Peters, '11, to Start Training Season Early. 
### 
With seven Varsity "S" men back,
the outlook for a winning baseball
team next semester is very promising.
Of these veterans six are now in col
lege: Captain Z. A. Terry, '14, 11. A.
Reeger, '13, L. Cass, '13, L. Childs, '13,
W. M. Argabrite, '13, and A.(i. Halm,
'14. .1. D. Couch, 'ir>, is expected to
register after Christmas.
The coming season will be started
by practice on the first Saturday after
the spring semester opens. Coach
J. D. Peters, '12, will again have
charge and together with Captain
Terry will control the team.
From the fall practice both the old
and new men gained much. With the
system of playing games three times
a week in a well organized league, the
players took an interest and pleasure
in the work hitherto not known. For
the new men this fall training proved
to be especially beneficial and much
new material of a high standard was
developed. Of these men, R. C. Maple,
'14. A. S. Hayes, '15, E. Williman, 'Hi.
W. A. McClure, '10, W. F. Noonan,
'10, A. F. Memley, '10, and It. T. Simp
son, '10, all showed to good advan
tage. To this list must be added a
large number of men from the ranks
of the last year's substitutes, some of
whom promise to develop into strong
candidates for positions this spring.
The men from last year's squad who
will again be out for baseball are:
A. O. Gragg, '12, M. F. Enderle, * IU,
R. McNeely, '13, T. E. Workman, '14,
C. W. Dooling, '13, C. P. McLaughlin,
'15, L. F. Dent, '15, P. X. McCloskey,
'in, and 0. B. Morrow, '14.
To guard against trouble over the
umpiring during the coming season it
is very probable that a system will be
arranged whereby professional um
pires from San Francisco will be
brought to the grounds for each
game.
