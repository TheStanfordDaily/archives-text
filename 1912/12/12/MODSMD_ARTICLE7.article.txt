# The
						Trouble.
## 
### 
Y«»terday afternoon an elderly lady
passing along the Row narrowly es
caped being hit by a batted baseball.

The hall had all the
momentum behind it
that would have car-

ries! the runner to second base if the
•cea« of action had been on a dia
mond. A trille more swing to the
bat might have caused serious re
wultl. Now we do not mean to con
demn all front-yard baseball but we
do think that all batting of a baseball
should cease while pedestrians are
within the danger zone. This is a
courtesy that should be demanded of
tlif players.
