Between the How and Lagunita lies
a great open field and at a reasonable
axptnse one 01* more baseball diamonds

might be constructed
that would give ample
room for the men to

exercise. This would also offer splen
did opportunities for daily scrub con
tents as well as series of games be
tween picked teams and organizations.
Witli the athletic ideal of the Univer
sity to get everyone possible out for
soma form of sport this proposition
offers a great opportunity to more
nearly bring this about. Incidentally
it would remove the baseball players
from tbe front yards.
