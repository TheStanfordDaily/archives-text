# KILDEER RETURNS FROM HIS WANDERINGS AFIELD.
## Blackbirdsâ€™ Claim to Grassy Oval is Jumped by Home-Coming of Feathered Campus-Dweller. 
### 
Kildeer has returned to the campus.
For a month, "Kildee," as the youth
ful egg collector of the land names
him, and scores of his ring-necked
fellows have been winging back to
their winter haunts in the geranium
vines and shrubbery about the rim of
the Oval.
Now-a-days, from early till late,
his enlivening calls as he Hies about
or squabbles with a lordly blackbird
for a choice morsel of food, puts an
echo of real music in the air.
Just where Kildeer went when ht.
struck camp and left the campus last
spring is a matter of wide conjecture.
A glance into the books of bird-love
in the Zoology department, gives him
a wide range. The whole out-of-doors
of temperate America falls under his
exploring eye.
It may be that the Stanford Kil
deer, who has become a decided cam
pus institution, strays no farther than
the marshy swamps of the bayshore.
His annual tour may cut through the
sunshine of Alaskan spring. Again,
he may play a food-winning game of
tag with crickets and lady-bugs in the
cool meadow lands of the High
Sierras.
At any rate, he is with us again,
and he has the cocksure, rather dap
per appearance of a widely traveled
bird-personage.
The purple-black blackbird, with
his gloomy chortles and pompous
strut no longer has the Oval in un
disputed possession.
