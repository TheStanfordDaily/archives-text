j [during that time.
];?,vThe Bookstore originally was esr
■mfyished as a cooperative joint stock
."association and continued in this fornji
fur ftve or six years. Difficulty iii
managing the bushiesß because of the
widely scattered locations of the
stockholders made reorganization
necessary.
■> stock, of the association was
bought by the firm now conducting
the birSinyss for about $1485. Tlie
rffnkVtrtfp today is legally a cooperat
ive company; the stwck being in the
hands of members of the faculty and
persons connected with the
sity. It is not possible under thQ

present system for the members to
take any profits from the business.
The building now occupied by the
Books-tore was erected at a cost of
' about $12;OOU. The building was
! started with only about $(>.OOO cash in
, hand. The earthquake that brought
such heavy damage to the University
entailed a loss of approximately
$4.dim, which piled up the debt.
Last June the assets of the firm
( were about $29,000, with debits of
j about $4,000. Since June the debt has
j been reduced to about $.'!,r>oo. The
j credit is excellent: the linn can bor
row at six per cent. At. present the
firm 'estimate's that they hold about
#J6,i100 111 11 xt ures. etc., which they
fee! belongs to the University.
ftUsmlKH'S' of the firm came' volun
tarily to the Student Council with the
suggestion, that a cooperative store be
formed for the students after the plan
of other universities, and received the
hearty- approval of their plan.
It is the belief of the firm, as ex
pressed by one member, that the time
is now ripe for the students to take
in interest in the Bookstore, not only
that they may share in the profits of
i the enterprise, but that future gener'a
| tions of Stanford students may have
the benefits that will accrue from the
operation of the store on a general
i cooperative basis.
Under the new plan, the store will
I ecome a student enterprise in its
entirety and members of the Student
Body may feel henceforth that the
Bookfetore really is an institution of
I their own.
