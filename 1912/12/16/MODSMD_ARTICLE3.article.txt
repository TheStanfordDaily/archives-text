"Dr. Jaime de Angulo," his card
reads, although there is a great deal
more which belongs to his name. lie
is a most assuming person, and he is
to lie found at almost any hour of the
day bending over laboratory experi
ments i:i the physiology department,
evolving intricate theories 'of heredity
and environment. You would not im
mediately suspect him of being a
Spanish nobleman, a Colorado cow
puncher, a fighter of Central American
revolutions, and a student all in one,
yet a half-hour of conversation con
vinces you, if you are lucky enough to
talk with him for half-an-hour, of his
genuineness and charm.
"First let me object to your tradi
tion of not smoking on the Quad," re
marked Dr. de Angulo, yesterday,
lighting a cigarette. "No man can
work well when he cannot smoke if he

wants." In reply to the conventional
arguments lie protested that the habit
is an entirely harmless one.
"Why did I come to California?
because I like the people. Always,
when I was at Johns Hopkins, I longed
to be in the West again, where the
people are broad and tine. Among my
fellow-students those whom I liked
best, were Westerners, some of them
from Stanford. So when I learned that
I could work under Dr. Jordan and
Dr. Kellogg, I came at once."
As a eugenist Dr. de Angulo has al
ready won distinction in this country.
Horn and educated in Paris, where
his parents have made their home for
many years, Dr. de Angulo is
thoroughly cosmopolitan in ideas. He
is a great lover of democracy, and
wishes to forget the old-world tradi
tions of his childhood in the freer at
mosphere of America. Like many men

educated on the continent, he is an
excellent sportsman, and, incidentally,
was a member of the University of
Paris Rugby team which defeated a
crack Australian aggregation several
years before it occurred to the Cali-
exponents of the game to ex
change victories over-seas.
