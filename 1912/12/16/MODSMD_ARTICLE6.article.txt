# The 						End.

### 
With this afternoon's issue, the
eightieth of the semester, volume
forty-one of The Daily Palo Alto is

brought to a close. It is
with a feeling of regret
that we sever our connec-

tions with the paper that we have
been associated with since our Fresh
man year. The comradeship with the
men 011 the staff has been one 0!' the
most enjoyable experiences of it all.
In the entire University there is 110
harder-working or 'self-sacrificing
group of men than these. In addition
to their studies they have willinglj
spent the best hours of (he afternoon
in our little two by four office helping
to get out a live times a week paper.
To attempt to adequately thank these
men would be useless.
At least one gain has been made this
semester in the official recognition of
the Executive Committee in the
awarding of medals to those attaining
the rank of News Editor or higher on
this paper. Any member of the staff
who wins one of these medals may
wear it with pride. There is 110 dis
tinction awarded by the Student Roily
that requires more consistent work to
win.
It is with a feeling of the utmost
confidence in the ability of Henry
Lawrence Loud, of Pomona, as a
newspaperman, that we turn over The
Daily Palo Alto to him to edit next
semester.
