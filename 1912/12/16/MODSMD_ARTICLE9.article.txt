# PRIMITIVE PEOPLE WERE NUMEROUS IN THIS REGION.
## Professor Heath Has Carried On Extensive Work in Indian Mound Near Mayfield. 
### 
That the local regions were once the
habitations of primitive peoples, is
conclusively proven by the numerous
shell-nioumls which have attracted the
attention of Western archeologists.
San Francisco seems to be the center
of these heaps, which number about
425.
Among the investigators is Professor
11. Heath of the Stanford Zoology de
partment, who has carried on exten
sive diggings in a mound, the area of
which is about two acres, two miles
south of Ma.vfield. In his diggings he
has not only unearthed fine skeleton
specimens, hut also bone whistles,
hammers, mortars, ornaments, and
bone-awls, which have been given a
high polish.
Most of the skeletons unearthed
have been sent to Washington, D. C.,
for investigation by authorities in that
line, lnit one of the best specimens has
been placed in the museum.
From measurements it is evident
that most of the men averaged above
six feet in height, but it does not ap
pear that they were a very energetic
or warlike race. Although many mor
tars and pestles, some of a very great
size, have been found, no pottery has
as yet discovered, and but one
arrowhead has been found by the
Stanford investigator.
These peoples seem to be no excep
tion to the shell-mound inhabitants
elsewhere, in that they buried their
dead in the accumulated refuse from
the camp, and it is a common thing
that the remains are unusually well
preserved. The universal practice in
the burial of these peoples can hardly
lie explained, unless there be some
religious significance to the method,
or that it was found too great a task
to dig deep into the soil, the shell
heaps being much easier to dig
through.
