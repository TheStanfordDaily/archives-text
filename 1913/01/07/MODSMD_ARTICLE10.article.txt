# Get a Season Ticket.
## 
### 
Only three hundred season tickets
had been sold up to three o'clock today.
This is a pitiable showing for an insti-

tution with an enrollment
of fifteen hundred. Surely
two dollars is not going to
bankrupt anyone and when

the outlay means a return of five dol
lars worth of athletic contests in ad
dition to membership in the Student
Hody it seems impossible that these
tickets should go a begging.
Last semester when over eleven hun
dred season tickets were disposed of,
ihe Student Hody got together and dis
played that spirit for which Stanford
has become famous. (Jentlemen, are
you going to let that spirit die? Is
that spirit which Stanford men every
where cherish going to pass out of ex
i stance?
Right now we have several bitter de
feats to avenge and the prospects seem
bright for accomplishing this. What
is needed is the united efforts of the
entire university. This means the pur
chase of season tickets. Athetes must
pay their student body dues to repre
sent the university. The rest of ns
must have a season ticket, in order to
give them the support they deserve.
(Jet a ticket today and be ready to start
the season with the teams. You started
right last semester and you saw the
results. Are you going to quit now?
