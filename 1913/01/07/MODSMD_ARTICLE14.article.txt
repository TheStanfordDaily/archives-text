the marks recorded during the past
semester show that l'ewer student
were placed on probation and made
their first failure lhan last year. Wh :n
classes Legin tomorrow there will I t
thirty-six vacant seats, made so by th
failure of this number to reach the re
quirements set by the university and

on the campus. I'll is number is co:i
siderably larger than for a year a
Seventy-one recorded their lirst fail
ure the past semester. The corre
ponding figure for 1911 was ten more
than this nurpber. The probation list
which debars the unfortunates cat;i
logued thereon from participation in
any collegiate activity shows tha:
twenty-seven are to devote their en
tire time to study during the present
semester. Forty-two .were placed c
probation last year. r J he number drop

The names of those who failed t(
reach the standards set by the scholar

is not possible to ascertain just how
seriously the various activities are ef

previous years.
