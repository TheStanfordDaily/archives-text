# STANFORD LOSES FRIEND IN DEATH OF WHITELAW REID.
## 
### 
With the death of the Honorable
Whitelaw Reid, United States Ambas
sador to England, on December 15, the
diplomatic service of the country lost
a trusted unit, and Stanford University
lest a true friend and adviser.
In 1902, Mrs. Stanford appointed Mr.
Reid to a ten year term as trustee of
the university. During the early part
of that period, while he was a resident
of the United States, his services were
unstinted in generosity. After his ap
pointment to the court of St. James
six years ago, he found it impossible to
be in regular attendance at meetings
of the board of trustees of Stanford,
but his live interest in the welfare of
the university was demonstrated con
tinually until the time of his death. His
last visit West, to attend a board meet
ing was about a year ago.
Friend of Stanford*.
Mr. Reid's friendship for Stanford
University grew out of the intimate
regard for the Stanford family when
he was accustomed to spend his win
ters at the home of his father-in-law,
D. O. Mills, in Milbrae. His first great
service to the university was rendered
while he was editor of the New York
"Tribune." At that time he superin
tended the sale of railroad bonds I < l
longing to the Stanford estate.
At the expiration <if bis term as a
trustee of the university, last October,
he requested freedom from further of
ficial duties and was replaced as trus
tee by H. Hoover, '95.
