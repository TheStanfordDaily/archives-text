England's greatest actor-manager, and
the greatest master of the art of pa
geantry in the world, has been se
cured by the Committee on Public Ex
ercises to address the first Assembly
of the semester 0:1 Friday at the 11:15

noted Shakespearean scholar. He is
a leader in the development of his
torical pageants.
At present he is visiting San Fran
cisco in order to devise a plan for a
great series of pageants during the

the Pacific Coast at uiis time.
Tomorrow afternoon he is to speak
in the ballroom of the Palace Hotel
under the direction of the San I< ran
cisco center of the California Civic

story of the West at the Fair. He de

can be brought to perfection.
Discusses l'lans.
In discussing the general plans, Mr.
Benson has said, "There is 110 sphere
of human activity or human thought
that will not find an echo in the har
mony of the great son-;' we wish to
sing on the occasion of the great cel
ebration that is to be held in 191">.
The story to he told in our pageants
will be the blending of the nations,
and the two chief acts in this great
drama, that we propose to produce,
will be the romantic episode of the
trail from the East, across the trail of
'■19—the drama of the mines and the
drama of the rebuilding of San Fran
cisco, and, as a finale, all this heroic
endeavor to make Western America.'
Within recent years the interest in
historical pageants h;is greatly in
creased in England and America. In
many ways the proposed pageants will
be among the most valued educational
features of the Exposition. In the As
sembly, Friday morning, he will de
scribe to the students the significance
of these great dramas.
