The time and money that has been
expended by tlie Board of Control to

erect the athletic fields

been to beautify the

campus, although all construction has
been along artistic lines. The sole
purpose is to enable the members ol
the Student Body to partake in clean
wholesome sport. The equipment does
not belong to the Hoard of Control, the
University Trustees or any similar
body. It is the sole property of the

To date only four hundred and ninety
four season tickets have been sold.
Of this number one hundred and fifty
have been sold to the women of the
university. The sales from these tick

Athletic Association to use as they
see fit. This means that only three
hundred and forty four men are going
to avail themselves of ihe use of the
.$7r ( ,000 worth of athletic fields. Every
able-bodied man in the university owes
a duty to himself and to Stanford to
get out for some branch of athletics.
All that is required to perform this
duty is a certain amount of energy
and a paltry two dollars. It is hard
to reconcile ourselves to the belief that
two-thirds of the men of this univer

gratitude to Stanford and to the men
who have provided these facilities to
use and preserve them, but it would
seem so from the sale ol season tick
