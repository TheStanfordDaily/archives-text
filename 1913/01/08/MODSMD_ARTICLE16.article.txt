### 
Professor Pay son J. Treat of the
History department returned to the
campus a few days before Christmas
Day after spending his sabbatical
leave in a seven months' trip through
Korea, China, Japan and the Philip
pine Islands, supplementing his store
of data on the countries of the Far
East with up-to-date material, which
he will add to the courses he gives on
the Orient.
Perhaps the most interesting of his
studies was that of China and the ef
fects o!' tlie recent revolutionary move
ment upon that great land, lie tells
that one of the most striking features
of the movement was the unity of or
ganization of the Chinese in their re
bellion against the Manchu govern
ment. It has heen marked by people
who have lived in China that as li na
tion the Chinese were not unified, but
that they took a very strong pride in
provincial matters. When it came to
the revolt, the whole of China acted
as one man in stamping out the for
eign governor's power. Professor
Treat compared them to the thirteen
colonies in that respect.
Another notable feature of the war
was that few signs of destruction and
wasting are shown. The city of Han
kow suffered the most. It was nearly
burnt to the ground. Aside from this,
signs of looting may be found in the
larger cities, I:ut in the country and
smaller villages, the violence of the
revolt is unnoticeable.
'1 he Americans have gained a great
deal of prestige in matters of every
nature and the Chinese are now wil
ling to be shown the methods of the
Occident. Americans would have a
still greater influence with them, it' tiie
I'nited States would recognize the new
government of China, but this is being
delayed util it cm be shown that the
new government is upon a perfectly
sure footing.
