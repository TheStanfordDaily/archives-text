# LONG FELT NEED FOR BOAT HOUSE SOON TO BE REALIZED
## 
### 
Time honor e d
visions of a boat
vnd bathing house
>11 the shores of La
;unita will be justi
ied in side the next
three or four weeks.
Tnder the supervis
ion of Professor C.
B. Wing of the civil
engineering depart
ment, and in charge

of the Board of Control, construction
work on a $ 1 r»0() home for the crew
men and student bathers will be com
menced in a few days.
Tentative plans for the building have
already l>pe:i drawn by R. K Dureyen,
'13, and \\ M. Halcombe, '09, under
Professor Wing's direction, and formal
dra lightings will be in the hands of
' id; i ig ;";ntr.'ctors in a few days. It
is pro!::!' !? that a number of minor
changes ii plan will be made before
tlv call is put in for bids, but elemen
tal details have been thoroughly work
ed out by the designers.
Though the work of the Hoard of
Control on :-tudent athletic enterprises
is legally confined to improvements on
the forty acres of land near the foot
hall field, which was set aside by the
Hoard of Trustees, the present project
nf providing the student body with
;uita' le roofing for water sports head- i
quarters has been taken in full charge. |
Location of the building will be west
()'" the silo of the old crew house, which
will he torn down. The dismantled
hoards will be carted to "Sam's lum
beryard" to find future use in repaii
ing various athletic equipment, of the
campus.
In order to make the combination ,
boat and bath house serve all the year
around, Duryea and Halcombe have |
been commissioned by Professors Wing

and Marx to devise an engineering
feat which will enable water to be
sluiced from Felt Lake in the fall,
when I.agunita naturally becomes dry.
The dimensions of the boat house
will be 156 feet along the land side, 72
feet projection from the dike into the
lake, and a height of about 30 feet. A
two-pitched sloping roof will cover tho;
enclosed rooms and abundant platform
space. The entire floor space will 1
over the water of tho lake, two feet
above high water mark, and will be
supported by piling of cast iron pipe.
Downstairs will be reserved for
barge and shell racks, dressing and
locker room for the crew men, and
general training apparatus. Plans for
equipment of the lower lloor include
racks for three barges, and four shells,!
rowing machines, and a large store
room. Railed, uncovered platforms
will extend the width of the house on
the water and land sides. On the west
side a covered platform will extend the
length of the building. The north plat
form will be connected with the dike by
an inclined runway.
Hatlting Facilities.
Outside stairs will lead to the upper
floor, about fifteen feet above water
level, which will be used as a bath
houise for men students of the univer
sity in general and will also have a
| room for a care-taker. The dressing
! room proper will be L'S feet wide by r>o
feet long, and will be fitted with lock
ers and benches. Showers upstairs
and down, and a tub for the crew men
I will be located in a convenient corner
room.
Permission has been granted by the
Hoard of Trustees to begin building as
soon as material is on the ground, and
the structure will be pushed throuh to
completion as soon as the contractor's
bid is accepted.

Tnder the supervis

B. Wing of the civil
engineering depart
ment, and in charge

of the Board of Control, construction
work on a $ 1 r»0() home for the crew
men and student bathers will be com
menced in a few days.
Tentative plans for the building have
already l>pe:i drawn by R. K Dureyen,
'13, and \\ M. Halcombe, '09, under
Professor Wing's direction, and formal
dra lightings will be in the hands of
' id; i ig ;";ntr.'ctors in a few days. It
is pro!::!' !? that a number of minor
changes ii plan will be made before
tlv call is put in for bids, but elemen
tal details have been thoroughly work
ed out by the designers.
Though the work of the Hoard of
Control on :-tudent athletic enterprises
is legally confined to improvements on
the forty acres of land near the foot
hall field, which was set aside by the
Hoard of Trustees, the present project
nf providing the student body with
;uita' le roofing for water sports head- i
quarters has been taken in full charge. |
Location of the building will be west
()'" the silo of the old crew house, which
will he torn down. The dismantled
hoards will be carted to "Sam's lum
beryard" to find future use in repaii
ing various athletic equipment, of the
campus.
In order to make the combination ,
boat and bath house serve all the year
around, Duryea and Halcombe have |
been commissioned by Professors Wing

and Marx to devise an engineering
feat which will enable water to be
sluiced from Felt Lake in the fall,
when I.agunita naturally becomes dry.
The dimensions of the boat house
will be 156 feet along the land side, 72
feet projection from the dike into the
lake, and a height of about 30 feet. A
two-pitched sloping roof will cover tho;
enclosed rooms and abundant platform
space. The entire floor space will 1
over the water of tho lake, two feet
above high water mark, and will be
supported by piling of cast iron pipe.
Downstairs will be reserved for
barge and shell racks, dressing and
locker room for the crew men, and
general training apparatus. Plans for
equipment of the lower lloor include
racks for three barges, and four shells,!
rowing machines, and a large store
room. Railed, uncovered platforms
will extend the width of the house on
the water and land sides. On the west
side a covered platform will extend the
