"In my experience of thirty odd
years I have never met a cleaner or
more desirable body ol' men than
those of Stanford University."
This statement is from the pen of
R. P. Woodward, one of two brothers
who are chiefly responsible for the
development of the game of rugby in
British Columbia. It appears in the
"Athletic News" of Manchester, En
gland, a copy of which has just been
received by Trainer 11. W. Malouey.
This is the leading rugby journal of
the British Empire, and has a larger
circulation than any other athletic oi.
Ihe British Isles or America, being
read, it isaid, by 90 per cent of the
inhabitants of England. The letter
appears in the column of "Rugby Re
flections" edited by "\V. L. S." the fore
mot-1. English rugby authority.
A further extract from the commun
ication follows:
Sound \inateurs.
As far as amateurism is concerned
in the big California 'Varsities, Stan
ford is beyond reproach, having abol
ished for all time the paid coach.
Berkeley (the University of Califor
nia) still retains one and as a con
sequence their play suffers from a
sporting standpoint, for the paid coach,
feeling that he must deliver a win by
any means in lieu of the tremendu
ous salary—about 5,000 dollars per
annum, 1 am told —that he receives.
Outside of that the men are splen
did in - every way, and in my exper
ience of thirty odd years 1 have never
net a cleaner or more desirable body
of n 3U than those of Stanford Univer
sity. Some teams from the old land
should certainly cone out our way !
next season. If not a combined 'Yar- j
sity, why not a mixed lot from the j
Services, Hospitals, 'Varsities, and |
public schools?
You are perfectly correct in sur% |
niising that it would be foolish to
send a medicore team out to the coast,
for if they escaped a licking in Cali
fornia they'd surely get one in Brit
ish Columbia.
