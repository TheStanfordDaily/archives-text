# ARCHITECTS TO DESIGN UNION CLUB
## Present Desire is Strong to Use Land Near Post Office for Building Site of Clubhouse 
### 
Live effort is in progress among
active members of the Stanford Union
to secure a satisfactory tentative de
sign for the proposed club house from
the efforts of the best architects avail
able. It is intended to have as many
as four plans draughted in the next
few months, and from that number
one will be selected as an advisory
working basis. J. C. Hoover, '95, the
president of the Union, has already di
rected some preparation for securing
designs, and during his stay of several
months in London, the search for suit
able architectural advice will be com
pleted by a special committee.
Soon after the desired number of
drawings have been submitted, the
more attractive ones will be printed
off, and posted for general inspection.
Definite selection of a design will be
followed by a petition to the Board ol
Trustees of the university for a suit
aide building site. According to pres
ent opinion among officers of the Un
ion, a request will be made for the
land north of the post office, toward
ilie Quad. The Board of Trustees
will not be interviewed until complete
plans of the proposed work can be sub
mitted for their consideration.
Fouler Will \ssist
During Hoover's absence, F. H.
Fowler, a graduate student in the Civil
Engineering department, whose work
demands r; quent visits to San Fran
cb c;;, will be c ommissioned to obtain
ti e servi." s of capable architects, who

ing department, who will be the ex
ecutive officer of the Union during
Hoover's stay abroad, will work with
Fowler to line up extensive prepara
tions for architectural designing.
'I he fight for student subscriptions
ti the union building fund will lie

waged through all angles of the cam
pus during the present semester.
In an interview this morning, Pro
fessor E. W. Smith of the English de
partment, treasurer of the union said:
Hook impresses (Graduate.
"Hoover recently sent out appeals
for subscriptions to a number of Stan
ford graduates whom he thought re
liable for help. Before leaving San
Francisco to go to England be received
an answer from one oi the men ap
pealed to, who said that after thor
ough canvass of the question he had
decided it wasn't ri.;ht for a man of
pressing business effort to go into bis
pocket for a donation to a cause that
was at best removed from bis interest
by many years' absence from the farm.
Soon after reaching that decision he
bought himself a Christmas present in
order to be assured of remembrance
by someone. The present was 'The
Story of a Good Woman,' a lately pub
lished book of Dr. .Jordan's. After
reading a sympathetic and admiring
chronicle of the struggles Mrs. Stan
ford went through after Governor
Stanford's death, to keep the univer
sity in a healthy condition, he decided
that the help be could give his alma
mater was his duty as a graduate. He
enclosed his check.
"It strikes me that when reading a
good book can impress a man out in
the world with the necessity for loy
alty to his university, the present stu
dent body should have a multiplied in
terest in the welfare of the Stanford
Union. Full opportunity will be given
every student on the campus to he 1
pay for the building which will serve
as a home for graduate and undergrad
uate students alike, and which will
erve as a place for friendly meeting
between the student body and the fac
ulty."
