In accordance with the well-estab
lished plan of making the Stanford
athletic- equipment one of the very
finest in the country, Graduate Man
ager I). \Y. Burbank has had a crew
o men laboring for two weeks on the
track, foot' all and baseball enclos
ures. I 'iiri:j v the Christmas recess
each ol the fields was given its share
of attention and improvement.
In order to prevent the spring rains
from causing a:i overflow onto the cin
der path a complete drainage system
was constructed around the outer
edge ol the track. The track proper
also received a thorough going-over.
\n additional turf runway was also
s-own. This is to lie used by the
sprinters during the early part of the
c e ! ! u)n and will aid in preventing
breakdowns because of the lack of
training when the men first begin to
work out. The idea of the turf track
was tried lar-t semester and "Dad" is
very enthusiastic over its possibilities.
.Mike Murphy, the University of Penn
sylvania trainer, who conditioned the

American representatives at the recent
Olympic games, recommends the turf
tracl: highly.
The-rugby turf suffered under the
11? age 'of a hard gridiron season dur
ing the past semester and the grass

arl liti .mil capacity was laid the entire
length of the field for supplying the
water for irrigation purposes.
