# RALLY IS POSTPONED UNTIL MONDAY EVENING
## TRACK, CREW AND BASEBALL MEN WILL JOIN FORCES. Combination Meeting To Start Spring Season. Originally Scheduled For Friday. 
### 
It has been decided to make the ral
ly scheduled for Friday evening a
combination track, crew and baseball
gathering and the firing of the opening
gun in the spring season of college
sport has been delayed until Monday
evening. Encina club room will be the
place and seven-thirty is to be the time
of the initial rally. Speakers repre
senting each branch of university ac
tivity are to address the meeting.
The active training will begin early
next week. From the number of men
who were out for the fall training last
semester it is very likely that the larg
est squads which have yet signed up
for the teams which are to represent
the cardinal in the contests with Cali
fornia are to turn out next week. This
is the first time that track, crew and
baseball have combined to hold one
rally at the beginning of the semester
for all three activities.
The 19111 season should be one of the
most successful enjoyed by Stanford
for several years. The track squad
presents a strong array of cinder path
stars and "Dad" is enthusiastic over
the prospects for a cardinal victory in
this branch. The eleven point winners
of the 1911 team will be augmented by
a strong representation from the
Freshman class and from the list of
ineligibles of last year.
Coach .1. 1). Peters, *11, of the base
ball squad had his men out for prac
tice during the past semester. The
fall league which played regular
games served to .nive him a good line
on the new men and on the most prom
ising of the past year.
With the addition of the new shell
the equipment of the varsity navy pre
sents the possibilities for a larger
number of men to set actual practice
on the water than ever before. Three
eights, two four-oared shells, a barge
and a steam launch comprise the fa
cilities offered to the oarsmen. The
first year men did light work just be
fore the close of the semester. More
men than before will be needed to com
pete for the places left vacant by the
failure of the veterans to return to
college and Captain Duryea hopes to
have a long list of names of appli
cants for seats in the Varsity and
Freshmen eights.
