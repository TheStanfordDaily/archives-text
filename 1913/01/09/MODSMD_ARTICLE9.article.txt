# Turn Out
## 
### 
There seems to be a growing ten
dency on t lie part of the student body

to regard an assembly
as an hour of recess.
Several times last sem-

ester there were disgracefully small
audiences present to hear some of the
world's foremost men. The men who
are secured to address these meetings
have something to say that is of in
terest to every American citizen and
they come down here at a great per
sonal sacrifice for the sole purpose of
presenting their ideas for the benefit
of the students. Hut unless the student
body shows a greater interest in the
live issues of the day, it will be im
possible to get. these speakers.
Tomorrow morning Frederick R.
Benson of London, the great actor
manager and authority on pageants,
will address the assembly. Mr. Hen
son is devising plans for the produc
tion of gorgeous pageants during the
191 Fair and it is upon this topic that
he will si teak tomorrow. His talk will
be worth while. Turn out and give
him the support he deserves.
