# Cold Storage
## 
### 
With tfce thermometer hovering
around the freezing point the Quad

has suddenly become
transformed into one of
the largest ice and cold
storage plants in exist-

ance. The powers of the power house
are evidently laboring under the de
lusion that all the products of the
Farm must be kept well iced in order
to be used in hot weather. While we
admit that there are some things
raised around here that need refriger
ation we do not think that the resi
dents of the university come under
that classification. Neither are we Es
quimaux. There are plenty of radia
tors in the various rooms to keep
the temperature up to to a comfort
able degree. If those in charge of the
heating apparatus will put some more
steam in the pipes they will confer an
untold benefit upon the faculty and
tiulents.
