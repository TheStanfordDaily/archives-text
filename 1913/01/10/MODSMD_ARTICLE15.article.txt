# HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETES TO COMPETE AT STANFORD ON SATURDAY, APRIL 12
## Board of Governors Send Invitations to Many Preparatory Schools on Pacific Coast. 
### 
Plans have been formulated for the
eighth annual interscholasticc track
meet to be held on April 12. Last year
it was decided to make the second Sat
urday in April the permanent date for
field day. During the vacation letters
have been sent to the principals of the
numerous high schools on the Pacific
Coast by the Interscholastic Athletic
Association, inviting the athletes of the
preparatory institutions to take part
in the field day.
In addition to tlie track contest the
association will conduct its annual
tennis tourney, which is governed by
the same eligibility rules as the inter
scholastic track and field meet. With
tlie purpose of making this meet an ex
ample of how a meet should be con
ducted in the interests of clean ama
teur competition, the association has
asked the different schools which will
be represented to send any ideas which
will make I he meet a success.
The Board of Governors is well
aware of the objections of many au
thorities to pledging students to fra
ternities during their school-days. The
Board sympathizes with this view and
has endeavored to check a tendency in
this direction at the Stanford meet and
to obviate the objection by assigning
the different schools to their quarters
by lot instead of by selection.
From the success and results of the
annual Stanford Interscholastic meet
heretofore in fostering an ideal sports
man spirit and with the increased in
terest which is shown by the prepara
tory schools yearly it is certain that
this year's meet will eclipse previous
records in the number of entries.
