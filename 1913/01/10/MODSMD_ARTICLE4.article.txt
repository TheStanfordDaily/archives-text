# FREDERICK R. BENSON TELLS OF PAGEANT PLANS
## British Authority in Eloquent Address Describes His Dream of a Great Historical Spectacle. 
### 
Frederick R. Benson, Britain's fore-'
most actor-manager, in Assembly Hall
this morning pictured in eloquent per-1
iods his dream of a vast historical j
pageant during the Panama-Pacific
Exposition. Mr. Benson, who is at
once artist, actor, scholar, and master!
of the material side of pageantry, did 1
not burden his audience with practical
details of the proposed spectacle, but!
emphasized its aesthetic elements,
making his appeal both poetic and in- -
spiring.
In developing his theme the speaker!
brought out with fresh vigor the re-!
lation of pageantry to both the ma
terial and the finer aspects of life, \
and the peculiar fitness of California j
to be the home of a renaissance of j
this form of artistic expression.
President David Starr Jordan intro- j
ferred to his success as a producer of
duced Mr. Benson, and in doing so re- j
historical pageants in England. t "A \
Few years ago," he said, "the greaf j
men of England that had fought and j
bled and died suddenly sprang up and I
began to live again and to glorify their
own towns. Behind all this Frederick j
R. Benson was the guiding spirit."
After speaking of Stanford Univer
sity and its espscial inspiration for
him, Mr. Benson introduced his sub
ject by fraying:
"We are fellow-students, and fellow
actors on the stage of life. In this ca
pacitj I address you. In the Old
World we are fighting giants—the ar
tist, uglines:;; t'.ie economist, such
ogres as false insistence upon war.
In California, then, should come the
lenaissance of art, politics, science,
and the drama. Here amid these beau
tiful surroundings should we recover
something that Europe has lost. .\ll

of you here around San Francisco
have a unique opportunity of herald
ing this new age of peace at your great
Exposition. It is for you to sound the
first triumphant note of human
brotherhood. I venture to put before
you a few suggestions as to how this
may bo done in the realm of pageant
ry."
The speaker then told of incidents
and impressions of his American jour
ney, basing upon homely events of the
trip interesting philosophic reflections
and comparisions of the two conti
nents. He went on:
Grout Western Drama Possible.
"It seemed to me you might on the
occasion of your exposition tell the
story of some of the great dramas of
this western life amid the Sequoias,
with the Pacific for a background and
the rocks and cliffs for properties.
Here might we tell a story worthy of
that great westward march across the
continent.
"If this pageant story is told, we
hope for your help in telling it. We
nee 1 those of you who are interested
in the drama and athletics. Let nib
pay an at.hletic's tribute to that muscle
produced in actual work. As the Aus
tralians say, muscle number one is
produced in yielding the pick and
shovel. But it is the long, lithe Greek
muscle we hope to use in telling our
story, and for this we shall call upon
your athletes."
In concluding, Mr. Benson quoted:
"The voice of the pageant will ring
out, as rings out the voice of Shakes
peare, forever through the ages, tell
in:; of those things that never pass
away and make for the better life of
al!—the message of that boy in whose
memory this university was founded."
