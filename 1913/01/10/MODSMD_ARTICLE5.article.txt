# REGULATIONS OF ENCINA GYMNASIUM ARE CHANGED.
## Forty-eight Hours of Attendance Are Required For One Unitâ€”Physical Examinations Given. 
### 
Forty-eight periods of attendance in
gymnasium are now required for one
unit of credit. Absences will be re
corded and any student having three
or more cuts without a reasonable ex
cuse will 1 e dropped from the course.
These changes have been made in or
der to insure more regular exercise
than in the past. Professor R. R.
Long is also giving each man who reg
isters in gymnasium a physical in
spection.
Following the system of last year,
physical training credit will l:e
to men on Varsity squads who are reg
istered. This semester all who are in
good physical condition will be allow
ed to take their work with Varsity
squads. Formerly it was necessary
to pass an apparatus test.
In order to get credit for physical
training work taken with the various
athletic teams, a student must register
in gymnasium and be one of the best
out for the sport he may elect. In

track it is necessary that he be one of
the best sixty-five; in baseball one of
the first twenty; in tennis among the
first six; and in the crew of the twenty
foremost.
Professor Long believes that the
changes in the regulation will be a
benefit to the students as it necessi
tates extension of the gymnasium
work uniformly over a greater period
of time. The students are to register*
for three hours per week as usual, but
as many as four hours may be taken.
If any man has three absences at any
one time lie will be dropped. This
does not mean that a student can be
absent from only three classes; but
that he must not cut three times with
out having a "make-up" in the mean
while. Absences can be made-up as
usual.
