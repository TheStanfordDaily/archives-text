# LARGE NUMBER EXPECTED TO SIGN UP AT RALLY
## MAM APPLICANTS TO KEPOKT FOU THAIKING. Great Opportunity For New Men to Make Places On Varsity and Freshmen Eights. 
### 
Judging from the
number of men
who signed up
for fair work on
the track last sem
ester the roll of
candidates for hon
ors 011 the Stan
ford varsity team
which is to be
complete d Mo n-

day evening at the
initial rally of the new year should ex
ceed the record established in past
seasons. Last January one hundred
and fifty-two signified their inten
tions of training. Captain Camp
bell is certain that when the
registration is completed on Monday
"Dad" will be able to begin work with
the greatest squad that lias yet been
available at the commencement of the
training season.
The freshmen are expected to make
an especially strong showing in the
number signing up. During the past
semester more than sixty men did reg
ular work on the track and cross
country squad. The distance races
will be greatly benefitted by the cross
country training which culminated so
successfully in the run on November
23.
Those who have followed the doings
of the cardinal cinder path men in
past seasons are unanimous in the be
lief that the 1913 season presents a
more auspicious outlook than has been
the prospect for several years. The
entering class has shown that it will
uphold its share in providing athletes,
'l lie scholarship of the men who are
to contest for places on the team
which is to meet California is much
better than in past years and the loss
via the probation and flunk-out route
is extremely small.
Eleven of those who won points for
Stanford last year have registered and
will l;o eligible. These men are Bon
nett, Miller, Campbell, Dodge, Card,
Richdale, Murray, Argabrite, Drown,
Finney and Stevens.
Oarsmen Needed.
For the first few weeks of the crew
training work is to be confined to prac
tice on the rowing machines, cross
country running and gymnasium drill.
The varsity men will be the first to do
actual work on the water. Doth varsity
and Freshmen are to row at Redwood
on the estuary.
A fewer number of veterans are to
report for the crew training this year
than for many seasons. Captain Dur
yca. Heal, Clover and Watkins are the
only men who have ever occupied seats
in a Stanford boat against an oppos
ing crew. The opportunity for the new
men should bring out a larger num
ber of applicants for places in the car
dinal shells.
