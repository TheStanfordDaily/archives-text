Stanford faces the difficult task this
semester of turning out three winning

teams capable of de
feating the University
of California. In

each case there are only a few veter
ans around whom the victorious com
bination must be built. To do this
means that every man in the univer
sity must do his share. In the past
we have accomplished harder things
in the face of greater odds and we
must repeat.
Every able-bodied man in the stu
dent body owes it to himself and Stan
ford to get out for one branch of
sport this spring. Our chances for
victory in April depend largely upon
the development of new material. If
you have never been out for athletics
you cannot tell what you can do until
you try. If you have been out before
and have failed to star don't quit now.
There are many instances of men who
have plugged along for three years
without any apparent promise of abil
ity and have become first place men in
their senior year.
We are not all gifted by nature to
become athletic marvels but we all
have an equally important part to play.
Failure to make the Varsity doesn't
indicate that your efforts have been in
vain. The more competition there is
the harder the first place men will
have to strive to make their places.
The better the second team, the finer
first team we will have.
Don't fail to sign up just because
you think you have no chance to make
your block "S." To win the letter is
a great honor but after all it is a minor
consideration. We are all working,—
or should be—first, last and all the
time for Stanford. Our prime object
is to make Stanford's teams Ihe best
there are. To do this requires keen
competition for places. By turning out
we can all do our share towards per
fecting the winning combinations.
Sign up tonight and help make 101:? a
banner year in Stanford's athletic his
tory.
