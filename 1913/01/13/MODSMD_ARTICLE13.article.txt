# CLIFF IRELAND WILL AGAIN OPPOSE VARSITY.
## Old Baseball Favorite To Again Gather Stars For College Games. 
### 
Cliff Ireland, the old diamond fav
orite, will again be on hand during the
coming bateball season with his In
dependent ball club. He has already
organized his forces and, as usual, will
oppose the nines of California, Stan
ford, Santa Clara, and St. Mary's.
For many years the peerless leader
lias brought out fast teams that al
ways make worthy opponents for the
colleges. Baseball is Ireland's hobby
and this season he promises to collect
an all-star aggregation of big league
stars. It is not known as yet whether
the captain will play the outfield or
second-base, but no matter his posi
tion in the line-up, Ireland's chief as
set lies in his humor and not in his
ability to field or hit the ball.
Ireland's team will be chosen from
among the following leaguers:â€”Duffy
Lewis of the Boston Red Sox, Dick
Egan of Cincinnati, Charlie Swain, the
Sacramento outfielder, Tommy Shee
han of Sacramento, Jack Bliss former
ly with the St. Louis Americans, Babe
Driscoll, Los Angeles outfielder, Doc
Moslciman, the ex-Boston star, Harry
McArdie of San Francisco, Cy Parkin
from the Oakland club, Tom Kennedy
from the Northwest League, Henry
Stultz. also from the Northwest, Tom
Tennant of the St. Louis Nationals
and Cliff Ireland.
