# CHAPEL ASSUMES FORM IT HELD BEFORE QUAKE.
## 
### 
With the work on the roof well
along, the Stanford Memorial Chapel
has now almost assumed the old char
acteristic shape which made it famous
in t lie days before the 190G earthquake.
Hut one feature —The tower with its
wonderful chimes—is missing in the
general plan of the exterior. The spire
will not he replaced for some time yet.
In its place a s.kylight is being iuiilt.
The stonework on the building will
be completed this week. The laying
of the tiling on the roof will be started
shortly.
This semester will probably see the
replacing of the mosaics well ad
vanced. When the Itaian contractor
left last fall, he said he would probably
be back in February. The mosaics
have to be made in Venice and shipped
here. It is expected that all the first
shipments will come through the Pan
ama Canal.
