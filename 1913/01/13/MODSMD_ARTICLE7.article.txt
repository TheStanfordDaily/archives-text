# CONSTRUCTION IS BEGUN ON HYDRAULICS BUILDING.
## New Structure, Near Old Boiler and Power House, to be Completed in January. 
### 
Ground space hus been plotted out,
and the first steel re-inforcements set
up for the new Hydraulics laboratory
division of the engineering depart
ment, which will be built near the car
line, alongside the old boiler and
power house. Professer C. B. Wing of
the Structural Engineering depart
ment said this morning in an inter
view that the new building operation
will be completed by the end of the
semester, and that full equipment for
work will be installed for use by nexl
January.
The hydraulics building will be ISB
feet long, and 50 feet wide, to be coated
on three sides with plaster, and on one
side with brown stone. The structure
will have a tiled roof, with roof win
dows running from end to end, and will
resemble the present wood-working
shop .
Both ends of the old, temporary
power house will be joined by passages
with the hydraulics building, and the
space between the structures will be
utilized lor offices. A high plastered
wall will reach from the east end of
the new building to the adjacent end
of the mechanical engineering shop,
in order to shut off view of unsightly
work materials that may accumulate
in the open space near the chimney.
The former power house will be used
for a lecture room, locker room, and
materials testing department. The old
boiler room will be fitted up as a test
ing room.
