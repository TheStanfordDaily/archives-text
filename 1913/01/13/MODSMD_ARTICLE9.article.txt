# CREW SEASON OPENS TOMORROW WITH SMALL NUCLEUS OF VETERANS
## Candidates For Varsity and Freshmen Shells Will Sign Tonightâ€”Training Begins This Week. 
### 
With two varsity
oarsmen in the
shell, two varsity
substitutes in train
ins. an unusually
large amount of
first rate material
to draw from, and
equipment that far
surpasses anything
that Stanford has
possessed hereto-

fore, the tenth collegiate crew season
will open tomorrow. There have been
years when the outlook was brighter.
From the standpoint of the number of
veterans in the shell, but with the
oarsmen that composed the second
and third varsities last season, and
with eight veterans of the Freshmen
shell in college and eligible, the squad
that will train under Captain Duryea
promises great things.
Veterans a Nucleus.
Captain R. F. Duryea, '13, is a vet
eran of three intercollegiate races,
rowing on his freshman eight and in
ihe varsity contests of 1911 and 1912.
He was a member of last year's coach
ing committee, and upon the determi
nation of Captain-elect Partridge not
to register for the spring semester,
was elected skipper of the 1913 var
sity eight. He rowed No. i3 in last
year's shell.
C. H. Beal, '13, is the second man
who will again wear the the cardinal
this spring. He is another veteran of
three intercollegiate regattas, and
rowed number 2 in the 1912 shell. Beal
did not announce definitely that he
would 1 e in the crew squad until this
morning. P. P. Clover, '14, varsity
substitute and a member of the Car
dinal eight which competed against
the best of the East at Poughkeepsie,
is eligible, as is J. S. Crepe, '13.
Coaching Committee.
Three members of the coaching
committee are in college, Duryea, Clo
ver and Beal. The Executive Commit
tee will probably till the two vacancies
at their next meeting.
E. H. Ford, '14, and L. F. Reineman,
'15, are the two candidates in sight
for the varsity coxswain's seat. Both
were steersmen of their class crews.
Unexcelled Equipment.
1 hree eight oared shells, one of
which was recently built to order in
Putney, England, and has never been
used in a race, one four oared shell,
two pairs, and one four oared barge,
is the equipment now possessed by
the University for that branch of
athletics. A new pair now building,
and a fast power boat now used by the
coaching committee, complete the Ilo
tilla.
The new boat house at Lake Lagun
ita will add immeasurably to the fa
cilities offered on the campus, and all
of the preliminary work will be done
there. Candidates for both freshmen
and varsity boats will sign up tonight
at the rally, and training will com
mence immediately.

ita will add immeasurably to the fa
cilities offered on the campus, and all
of the preliminary work will be done
there. Candidates for both freshmen
and varsity boats will sign up tonight
at the rally, and training will com
mence immediately.


R. F. IMiryea,
With two varsity
oarsmen in the
shell, two varsity
substitutes in train
ins. an unusually
large amount of
first rate material
to draw from, and
equipment that far
surpasses anything
that Stanford has
possessed hereto-

fore, the tenth collegiate crew season
will open tomorrow. There have been
years when the outlook was brighter.
From the standpoint of the number of
veterans in the shell, but with the
oarsmen that composed the second
and third varsities last season, and
with eight veterans of the Freshmen
shell in college and eligible, the squad
that will train under Captain Duryea
promises great things.
Veterans a Nucleus.
Captain R. F. Duryea, '13, is a vet
eran of three intercollegiate races,
rowing on his freshman eight and in
ihe varsity contests of 1911 and 1912.
He was a member of last year's coach
ing committee, and upon the determi
nation of Captain-elect Partridge not
to register for the spring semester,
was elected skipper of the 1913 var
sity eight. He rowed No. i3 in last
year's shell.
C. H. Beal, '13, is the second man
who will again wear the the cardinal
this spring. He is another veteran of
three intercollegiate regattas, and
rowed number 2 in the 1912 shell. Beal
did not announce definitely that he
would 1 e in the crew squad until this
morning. P. P. Clover, '14, varsity
substitute and a member of the Car
dinal eight which competed against
the best of the East at Poughkeepsie,
is eligible, as is J. S. Crepe, '13.
Coaching Committee.
Three members of the coaching
committee are in college, Duryea, Clo
ver and Beal. The Executive Commit
tee will probably till the two vacancies
at their next meeting.
E. H. Ford, '14, and L. F. Reineman,
'15, are the two candidates in sight
for the varsity coxswain's seat. Both
were steersmen of their class crews.
Unexcelled Equipment.
1 hree eight oared shells, one of
which was recently built to order in
Putney, England, and has never been
used in a race, one four oared shell,
two pairs, and one four oared barge,
is the equipment now possessed by
the University for that branch of
athletics. A new pair now building,
and a fast power boat now used by the
coaching committee, complete the Ilo
tilla.
The new boat house at Lake Lagun
ita will add immeasurably to the fa
cilities offered on the campus, and all
of the preliminary work will be done
there. Candidates for both freshmen
and varsity boats will sign up tonight
at the rally, and training will com
mence immediately.
