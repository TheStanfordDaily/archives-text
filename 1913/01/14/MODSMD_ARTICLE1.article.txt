# TOTAL REGISTRATION EQUAL TO OTHER YEARS
## 1540 IS NUMBER OF STUDENTS IN UNIVERSITY. Registrar's Office Denies Rumor That Many Have Left College Since Last Tuesday. 
### 
1540 is the total number of students
who have registered during the first
week of instruction. This is a very
favorable report as compared with a
year ago when 1550 registered in the
same time. There is only a difference
of ten. This is accounted for by the
fact that more graduated last Decem
ber than in December, 1910.
The Registrar's office gave out the
information today that there is abso
lutely no truth in the rumor than many
students have left the University on
account of recent heavy losses in the
citrus fruit industry. That report was
published in the city papers without
any authenticity of facts.
The total registration for the entire
year is 1772 as opposed to 1752 at the
same period last year. These figures
show an increase of twenty students
for 1912-1913. Of the number which
has registered this semester there are
SO new students and 20 old ones who
have been out of college for one sem
ester or more. 100 is the total of the
newly registered men.
Forty over a thousand is the total of
men who have signified their intention
of attending classes and striving for
a degree. Of the entire number of
students now registered 500 are wo
men.
