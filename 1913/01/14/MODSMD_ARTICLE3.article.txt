# CHARACTERISTIC RALLY OPENS SPRING ATHLETIC SEASON
## Record Number Sign for Track, Crew and Baseball.--- Speakers Predict Success for Cardinal Teams 
### 
Displaying the fighting spirit which
has characterized Stanford teams in
seasons past, the men of the university
crowded into Encina clubroom last
evening and in a rally teeming with a
determination which augurs victory
in three branches of sport pledged
their support to cardinal coaches. As
yell-leader Wes Wilson, '13, mounted
the speaker's rostum and called forth
the first cheer of the athletic season,
the latent enthusiasm of the gather
ing leaped forth. Every man listed
on the program of speakers was made
to feel that there was something deep
er than mere volume of voice backing
the cheers.
Every one of the eight men who
talked at the rally had a message.
The oarsmen, the baseball nine and
the track team were in turn represent
ed. The possibility of securing the aid of
Pat O'Dea, the former Wisconsin oars
man, to assist the coaching committee;
the plan for a coaching committee on
track as well as crew; the scheme of
coach Peters' to keep the baseball
squad out during the entire season
was told the men.
Record \iiiiilmt.
One hundred and sixty-six men
signed up for track as against I">2
last year. The baseball squad num
l ers (!4, seven more than in 1912. Six
ty-one signed for crew. Of this num
ber are Freshmen. Fifty-six was
the total a year ago.
j As a fitting speaker to address the
fathering on behalf of the oarsmen,
Professor F. C. Woodward of the law
department who took his degree at the
home of the great eastern champion
crew, Cornell, and who witnessed the
regatta at Po'nghkeepsi√ü last summer,
made the first talk of the evening. In
part he said: "In my observations the
men who make up the varsity crews are
all-around men who have been promi
nent in all lines of activities. The
training which they get is of the great
est physical good. The Stanford crew
men face most discouraging condi
tions without a coach but the pro
gress made here has been great. Ev
ery man must come out and get be
hind the crew and the success of the
season now being entered upon is as
sured."
Coach J. D. Peters, '11, of the base
ball team was the next speaker. He

explained the scheme which has been
devised to keep the entire squad out
all season. The players are to he di
vided into a first and second team and
games are to he played weekly. A
league is to he formed and a schedule
of games arranged. As the men show
improvement they will be moved into
the varsity squad.
"To be a success you must stick,"
said the diamond director. "It is
necessary for every man to get out
and stay out during the entire train
ing period."
"Men, will you come out, who have
the Stanford spirit and clean red blood
in your arteries?" asked .1. P. Hager
man, the second of those to speak.
"The man who is loyal is the man
who faces "Dad" Moulton with the in
tent ion of giving the best he has for
the team which is to face California
next April. We have some of the best
men in the country and if we develop
the material which is at hand we are
bound to win."
"Uiml" Speaks.
That the student body has the utmost
confidence in "Dad's" ability to senu
forth a winning track team was evi
denced in the hearty welcome which
the veteran trainer received when he
mounted the table to.give his advice to
the men. "Dad" has not yet disap
pointed a rally audience by failing to
tell a fevy funny stories and last even
ing was i\o exception.
Tersely, tjae man who
ha:; developed two world's champions
for Stanford in" the last four years
mi hi l;e summed up as,, follows:
' Kee;i up your scholarship. Get out
for something. The Stanford spirit is
to come out and help win. Your pres
ence on the ground will help the
others. Like the hour glass the longer
you wait the less sand you will have.."
"I think this is a golden year for
Stanford athletics," said 11. W. Ma
loney. "This semester we are start
ing for three victories, (let acquaint
ed with your trainer and captain. From
your competition on the field of sport
you will get something from the asso
ciation, with men which is not found
in books."
