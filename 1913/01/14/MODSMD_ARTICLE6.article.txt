Two hundred and ninety-two men
signed up for some branch of athletics

at the rally last evening. This
is a record number but it is not
enough.

in addition to the men who regis
tered last night there are not over one
hundred others engaged in any line of
student activity, such as debating,
dramatics, literary work, or minor
sports. The registration figures as
given out today show an enrollment of
1040 men. This indicates then that
six hundred men in this university are
taking away with them part of what
Stanford has to offer without giving
anything in return.
Every institution of learning is
judged to a great extent by the stan
dard it sets in the various branches of
student activity. The university itself
does not furnish this standard; it is
for the students to make. Stanford en
joys an enviable reputation in this re
spect. The Stanford Spirit is recog
nized everywhere. Naturally everyone
who attends the university is consider
ed a part of it. But what are you six
hundred men doing to earn that repu
tation? To put it frankly you are spong
ing. You are crowning yourselves with
the glory that is reflected by four hun
dred true Stanford ruen.
You six invndred men cannot excuse
your inaction on the ground of lack of
facilities. Stanford offers an oppor
tunity for everyone to ally himself
with some form of student activity.
r.et out and do something that will
not only help you but will benefit the
university. You do not know what
this Stanford Spirit'is that you hear
so much about and you will not know
until you get out and rub up against
the men who make the Spirit.
