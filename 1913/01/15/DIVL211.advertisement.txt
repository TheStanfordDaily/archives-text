Clothing for College Men
INDEPENDENT of meaningless traditions and prece
dents, the Western college man is equally intolerant
of dictatorial style standards, dressing to suit himself,
first of all, letting Fashion follow where it will.
Where Fashion is both reasonable and in good taste,
however, the college man takes up the running and quickly
assumes the lead.
This is our understanding of the college clothing situ
ation after selling chothing to three generations, and you'll
find that our stocks are selected to meet every progressive
requirement, providing that it is neither bizarre nor com
mon place.
