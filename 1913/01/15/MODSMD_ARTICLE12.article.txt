# Pat O'Dea

### 
It is with a feeling of mingled pride
and pleasure that we take this oppor-

tunity of welcoming into our
midst Pat O'Dea, the new row
ing coach. As an oarsman
and upbuilder of clean

sportsmanship O'Dea has a reputa
tion that extends from coast to coast.
It is jLt a great personal sacrifice that
he takes up the work of coaching the
crews but liis love for the sport and
his ardent friendship for Stanford
overcame all obstacles.
Nor is this the first occasion in
which Mr. O'Dea has evinced his in
terest in Stanford. Many times in the
past he has given timely words of ad
vice to the oarsmen and last spring lie
was one of the staunchest boosters of
the eastern trip. The Stanford Stu
dent Body should feel proud of having
such a friend as Pat O'Dea.
