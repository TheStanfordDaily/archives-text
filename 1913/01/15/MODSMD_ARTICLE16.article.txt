# DATE FOR EXPOSITION IS SET FORWARD TWO YEARS.
## Women Students as Directors Assume Power to Change Both Date and Name of Fair. 
### 
In changing the date of the Panama-
Pacific Exposition from 191.") to 1913
and setting the opening date at .lan
nary 25, the women students have
found a great task on their hands.
While the "fair" Directors have
changed the date, they have also taken
it into their hands to change the name,
to the Pre-Panama Exposition. The
Zoology building with its laboratories
will be the exposition ground. On
January 25, representatives of all na
tions will appear upon the scene to
inhabit the villages, now in prepara
tion for them and to show the students
their exhibits.
