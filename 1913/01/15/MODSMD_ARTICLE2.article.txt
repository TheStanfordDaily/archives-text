Playing the original version used by
Henry Miller as a vehicle to one of
the most effective stage triumphs in
the history cf American theatre of
ferings, Sword and Sandals will pre
sent "The Only Way" to the Stanford
public in the Assembly Hall on the
evening of February 7. The "sides"
to lie studied for the student produc
tion are the only copies of the origi
nal, authorized version at present in
the hands of actors for preparation,
and were obtained for Coach F. L.
Mathieu by Holbrook Blinn, ex'9s,
who visited San Francisco last fall.
At the time of his visit, to San Fran
cisco, lilinn assured the Stanford so
ciety representatives that he would
use his influence to obtain the manu
script from Henry Miller, who has
guarded it jealously since his triumph
iu the role of Sidney Carton, many
years ago, in anticipation of a revival.
Pirated versions of "The Only
Way" have been staged throughout
the United States from time to time,
in incomplete, loosely fitted form.
Students on the campus will have an
exceptional fortune in being the first

community to see an interpretation
of the powerfully conceived and exe
cuted drama since it was laid aside
from the masterful setting and pro
duction it had with Henry Miller as the
interpreting genius. ,
Dramatization oi Dickon's Novel.
The play is the stage version of
Dickon's novel "The Tale of Two
Cities," a story of the French Revoke
tion. The dramatist who undertook
the task of transforming one of the
most loved novels of a century to the
stage was daring. A wonderful ability
was needed to convince the audience
that the stage setting before them was
not a travestry and an irreverence
to the art of the immortal English
novel is..
It remains that the dramatist suc
ceeded, and that with "The Only Way"
as a vehicle, Miller rose to a height of
popularity that has not been lost in
following years.
'1 he stage settings used in the orig
inal Miller production will be follow
ed as closely as possible by Coach
Mathieus. Special scenery is being
prepared for the production.
