# STANFORD IS RATED AS SCHOOL OF FIRST RANK
## INSTITUTIONS OF LEARNING CLASSIFIED. "Specialist in Higher Education" Makes Secret Investigation For Government. 
### 
According to Dr. Kendrie ('. Hub
cock, a "specialist in higher i...ica
tion," Stanford University is placed in
the first of the four classes in which
he divides all the larger educational
institutions of the nation. A secret in
vestigation of all the colleges and uni
versities was made by Babcock l'oi
Philander P. Claxtnn, the United Stales
Commissioner of Education.
Commissioner Claxtcn reports that
tae government, in ordering the inves
tigation, was only trying to raise the
standard for bachelor's degrees, and
not sitting in judgement as some in
ferred. The division into classes he
regrets as "unfortunate."
There are i>9 in the first class. Al
though four divisions have been named
the main interest, naturally, is in the
line drawn between the first and sec
ond classes.
The first, class Babcock defines as
follows: "Institutions whose graduates
would ordinarily be able to take mas
ters' degrees at any of the large grad
uate schools in one year after receiv
ing their bachelors' degrees, without
doing more than I he amount of work
regularily prescribed for such higher
degrees."
In the second class there are 161.
The main difference between these
and those of the first division is the
fact that their gra luates reqtMre more
than the prescribed year's time to ear",
their higher degrees.
Following is the total list of the in
stitutions of the first class: Amherst.
Barnard, Beloit, Rowdoin, Brown. Bryn

been treated unjustly.

line drawn between the first and sec
ond classes.
The first, class Babcock defines as
follows: "Institutions whose graduates
would ordinarily be able to take mas
ters' degrees at any of the large grad
uate schools in one year after receiv
ing their bachelors' degrees, without
doing more than I he amount of work
regularily prescribed for such higher
degrees."
In the second class there are 161.
The main difference between these
and those of the first division is the
fact that their gra luates reqtMre more
than the prescribed year's time to ear",
their higher degrees.
Following is the total list of the in
stitutions of the first class: Amherst.

According to Dr. Kendrie ('. Hub
cock, a "specialist in higher i...ica
tion," Stanford University is placed in
the first of the four classes in which
he divides all the larger educational
institutions of the nation. A secret in
vestigation of all the colleges and uni
versities was made by Babcock l'oi
Philander P. Claxtnn, the United Stales
Commissioner of Education.
Commissioner Claxtcn reports that
tae government, in ordering the inves
tigation, was only trying to raise the
standard for bachelor's degrees, and
not sitting in judgement as some in
ferred. The division into classes he
regrets as "unfortunate."
There are i>9 in the first class. Al
though four divisions have been named
the main interest, naturally, is in the
line drawn between the first and sec
ond classes.
