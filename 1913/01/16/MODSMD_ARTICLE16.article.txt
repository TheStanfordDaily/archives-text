# ACADEMIC SECRETARY STUDIES FUR SEALS.
## G.M. Clark, and Doctor Jordan Prepare Report on Killing of Animals In Northern Islands. 
### 
After a trip to the colder regions
in which he carried on an investiga
tion of the seal islands owned by the
United States, G. A. Clark has re
sumed his duties as academic secre
tary of the university. President Jor
dan has also investigated the fur seal,
and with Mr. Clark's new data, the
two men turned in a report to the De
partment of Commerce upon the kill
ing of the seals, and the effect the law
forbidding the further killing of them
for a certain period of time has had
upon the fur seal herd.
In protestation against the law sus
pending the land killing of seals, the
report states: "Pelagic sealing
through its slaughter of females has
been the sole cause of the decline of
the fur-seal herd; its abolition, as
demonstrated by the experience of the
past season, is an adequate remedy
for this decline. Land killing, confined
to the superfluous males, has not. and
cannot under the law, endanger the
life of the herd. Suspension of land
killing can only do harm to the herd
and to the subsidary life upon the is
lands. It carries with it a large eco
nomic waste and financial loss, not
merely to the United States but to the
treaty nations, besides depriving man
kind of a commodity of comfort and
utility. The suspension carries no
compensating advantages."
