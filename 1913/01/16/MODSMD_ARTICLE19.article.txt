# ELEVEN TEAMS ENTERED IN TENNIS TOURNAMENT
## Tomorrow is the Last Day to Sign Up For Mixed Doubles Matches. 
### 
Eleven teams have already signified
their intention of entering the mixed
doubles tennis tournament and striv
ing for the two trophies that go to
the winners. Although twenty-t.vo of
the best racquet wielders have entered,
it is expected that many more will
hand their names in to V. 1.. Sheldon,
'15, or C. V. Park, '11, before tomor
row night.
The possibility of an intercollegiate
mixed doubles match and the novelty
of such a tournament at Stanford has
aroused great enthusiasm among the
players. It will give the women an
excellent opportunity to test their
skill on the court with that of men
and the fans a good chance to com
pare their play.
Such combinations as F. S. Pratt,
'13, and Miss Laura Herron, "14, C. V.
Parke. '11. and Miss Elsie Parker, '12.
R. L. Murray, '13, and Miss Mary Card.
'ir>, V. L. Sheldon, '15, and Miss Joyce
Wand, 14, all of whom are capable of
putting up a fast game, assure the
success of the tournament. The chief
interest of the mixed doubles lies in
the uncertainly of the result and the
winning team may be one of unknown
quality.
Tomorrow is the last day on which
entries will be accepted. All those
who wish to play should hand in their
names at once.
