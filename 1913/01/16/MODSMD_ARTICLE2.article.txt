### 
Concluding an exhaustive session be
gun on Tuesday in which four manu
scripts were carefully heard and dis
cussed the 1914 Junior opera commit
tee last evening ended its preliminary
labors by accepting the opera submit
ted by Miss Emily E. McCord, ' 1 , and
A. T. Stearn, 'lfi. The committee had
difficulty in agreeing on the manu
script to be accepted and it was' only
after careful consideration that the one
chosen was selected. The title of the
successful manuscript has not yet been
announced as the name under which
j the work was first submitted did not
' meet with the favor of the committee
I and a new one is to be framed for the
production.
The book is the work of Miss Mc-
Cord and the music was contributed by
Stearn. The opera, is in two acts, the
first of which is laid at a Senior Prom
in the Memorial Court. The Mojave
Indian Reservation is the scene of the
final act. Part of the book is founded
on an old Indian custom, the burning
of the "Maiden Fires." The opera fur
nishes excellent possibilities for a high
i class production.
The opera will be coached by Fred
j Carlyle of San Francisco who directed
,i he staging of last year's Junior opera.
! Tryonts for the principal parts are to
j be held about February 1.
Of the successful authors of the

Diego and is registered in the Econom
ics department. She is a member of
Roble Club. Stearn has been in the
University but a semester, majoring in
