## 
### 
Every mail who goes down on the
cinder path this spring is to lie given
special individual attention. "Dad"
Moulton and Captain Campbell are to
have a large number of assistants who
will aid the new men in their work.
One of the old track men in each
event who has had experience is to be
0:1 hand daily, lie will faelp the new
material and give them whatever in
formation they may want, lie will
also be in a position to tell a man how
he can improve by following certain
instructions.
Trainer Maloney is to be on the in
side and look after the conditioning of
the athletes in the track house. Here
tofore there has been a rubbing list for
the entire season which was limited to
a certain number of men. This spring
all the men are to be taken care of and
â€¢ire to have the same privileges that
were formerly limited to a few.
"Dad" will now be able to devote
his entire attention to the men on the
outside. In this way he can keep a
constant watch on the men and see
what, each individual is doing.
Strict training rules have not started
vet and will not be enforced for a few
weeks. The distance men have been
requested to stop smoking. All will
follow the simple instructions about
the kind of food that is harmful to the
track men.
