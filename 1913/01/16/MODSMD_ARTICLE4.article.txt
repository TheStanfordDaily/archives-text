# STANFORD SOCCER TEAM TO STRIVE FOR TROPHIES
## Players Will Train For California Cup Competition and Game With Blue and Gold. 
### 
With two trophies in view the Stan
ford soccer team will go into strict
training this semester. A victory in
the third game of the series with Cali
fornia will bring with it the William
son trophy, and, if Stanford wins the
California Cup Competition, the tro
phy offered by that league will also
become the property of the Cardinal.
Of last year's eleven but one man,
W. H. Newman, '12 who graduated at
Christmas, is missing. With the ten
remaining veterans and a wealth of
substitutes to pick from, Stanford's
prospect of winning both of these
prizes is especially bright.
For the first time since they entered
the California Cup Competition, the
Stanford eleven has a chance to win
the $150 trophy. Last year the Cardi
nal players were eliminated in the
preliminary round, but in the coming
tournament they drew a bye which
places them without the necessity of a
contest in the first round.
In the second round the team meets
the Burns eleven, which is at present
tied with the Pastimes at the head of
the California Soccer League, but
which nevertheless fell before the
Stanford dribblers only a short time
ago. H. W. Maloney, who is coaching
iho squad believes that they can du
plicate the trick and place themselves
in a fair way toward winning the cup.
Gold Medals Offered.
Besides the handsome trophy, which
stands some three feet high, gold med
als will be given to each member of
the victorious elevens and bronze med
als to the runners-up. A division of
the gate receipts will be made to the
teams in the competition and Stan
ford's share of this will be turned
over to the Student Body. The game
with the Burns players will be con
tested about the end of this month.
The other cup, the Williamson tro
phy, which the Cardinal eleven is also
out to win for the third time from the
representatives of California, will be
fought for on Washington's birthday.
February 22. Two wins are necessary
to obtain possession of it. Tf Stanford
is returned the victor, the cup will re
main another year on the Farm, as the
team already has one to its credit.
Stanford defeated California by the.
score of 3-1 on the day of the Big
Game, while the second contest of the
series, played on Thanksgiving day,
was 2-2 tie.
