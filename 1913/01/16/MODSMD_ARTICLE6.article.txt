# RUGBY ORGANIZATION ACCEPTS RESIGNATION OF STATE UNIVERSITY
## California Union to Issue Statement Giving Reasons For Acceptance of California's Withdrawal. 
### 
After careful consideration the Cali
fornia Rugby Union unamimousiy
voted to accept the resignation of the
University of California from the or
ganization. The action makes it im
possible for California to arrange any
preliminary games next season with
any of the members of the governing
body. The intercollegiate contest will
be played as usual as a special clause
in the constitution of the Union covers
this game and does not place it un
der the jurisdiction of that body.
The letter of resignation of Califor
nia and the letter explaining the ac
tion was read and discussed by the
members present. It: was the consen
sus of opinion that California was act
ing in a dictatorial manner to the
union.
In the absence of Milton Farmer,
former graduate manager of Califor
nia and president of the union, vice
president D. W. Burbank, '09,
acted as chairman of the meeting,
which was the largest attended since
the organization of the governing
body.
Committee Appointed.
A special committee consisting of
Burbank, L. S. Reading and .J. R.
Hickey was named to draw up a public
statement setting forth the case of
the Rugby Union in the matter, as has
been done by California in the letter
of explanation, and copies of this
statement will be sent to all the mem
bers of the union and given publicity.
The British Columbia teams Van
couver and Victoria, are affiliated with
the California Rugby Union through
the mother body and will no doubt ac
cept the ruling of the California board,
which further handicaps California in
-ecuring games.
The meeting was held at the Olym
pic Club and the following delegates
were present:
Stanford, 1). W. Burbank, '09, and
A. W. Ambrose, '13; University of
Santa Clara, C. L. Tramutolo: St.
Mary's, C. Russell; College of the Pa
cific, W. M. Case; Nevada University.
