The acceptance ot' the resignation
of the University of California was the

only logical action for the
California Rugby Union
to take. It, the parent
body is to continue in ex-

istance it cannot be dictated to by any
of its parts.
The Rugby Union was formed last
year by the leading organizations play
ing rugby in order to put the game on
a sound footing by having a central
governing body. Since its inception
the Union has been the dominant fac
tor in the development of rugby foot
ball on the coast and has dealt im
partially in all matters that have come
before it. We regret the action of
California in withdrawing upon such
insufficient grounds. From this side
of the fence it looks as if California
was biting off her nose to spite her
face.
