an English team to Australia next
fall and it was his idea to have the in
vading players stop in California and
meet the fifteens here. Henry Stan
ley. the secretary of the Oxford-Cam
bridge Club, who is also a representa
tive in the English Rugby Union is
very enthusiastic about the proposed
tour.
If the varsity men are unable to
spare the time from their university
work it is very likely that a team made
up of tho best of the graduates of Ox

In the advent of the visit of the Brit

Though the University of California
is no longer a factor in the Union, this
fact was not considered as a necessity
in arranging the tour. Not being a
member of the Union the Blue and
