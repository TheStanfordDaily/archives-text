# TENNIS PLAYERS WILL DRAW FOR PLACES MONDAY.
## 
### 
Drawings for the mixed doubles ten
nis tournament will be held on next
Monday, and those in charge hope that
the matches will be played off by the
end of the week. Inclement weather
has been the delaying factor in the
game this semester.
There have been twenty-eight en
tries made thus far, and the fourteen
teams formed will furnish a tourna
ment of high order.
Tennis enthusiasts have been asked
to meet at the Kappa Alpha house on
next Wednesday evening at 7:30. A
coaching committee will lie elected at,
that time, and a new plan for choos
ing the teams investigated.
