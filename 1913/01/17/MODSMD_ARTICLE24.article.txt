Control of .Membership.
At a. recent meeting of the club,
President Frank called attention to
the ruling of the board of directors
which controls membership in the club
and residence in the hall. Former hall
men have the first opportunity to re
enter. After these men have been ac
comodated, freshmen, up to the num
ber of fifty can secure rooms, and then
sophtnores and freshmen in their or
der on the waiting list. This ruling
was passed last semester to prevent
upperclassnien from crowding out the
freshmen. Upperclassnien come into
the Hall for purely selfish motives and
do not take what the committee con

j aiders, a proper interest in the affairs
of the club. The committee feels that
if a man comes into Encina a-; an un- j
derclassman, he will not Iqok upon 1
the hall as merely the cheapest place i
on the campus to live.
Frank urged the members to take
! special pains to make fraternity men i
I and others in the University feel that i
1
they were welcome in the Hall and I
I expressed the desire of the club to j
j have Encina Club room serve as the |
meeting place for all the men of the j
I University.
