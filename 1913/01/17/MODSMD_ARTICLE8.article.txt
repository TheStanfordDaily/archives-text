With the shout of
the umpire tomorrow

1913 season will start.
At that time the Stan
ford Varsity and Ire
land's Independents
will each play their
iirst name of the year

lii anticipation of this season's
games Coach Peters had the baseball
men in active practice last fall and
during the past week. From the
work of the players during this time
it is expected that the first game of
the season will furnish a better brand
of ball than us generally shown in (lie
first games played each spring, lie
cause of the weather little practice
on the infield has been had and the
play has been confined primarily to
batting and outfield work.
In tomorrow's game Captain Terry
will take his customary position in the
short field while some of the veterans
of last year will lie seen in changed
positions. Maple, Halm, Gragg and
Hayes will each be given a chance on
the mound. Workman will be tried
out for first and Dent and Hurley will
catch. McNeeley will cover second
and McCloskey will play third. Ar
gabrite will be in left, Cass and Childs
in center and Beeger in right. The
substitute in to morrow's contest will
be: Jack. Dooling, Gates, Gran and
Anderson.
If weather conditions forbid the
playing of the game, notice will bo put
on the bulletin boards at noon.
