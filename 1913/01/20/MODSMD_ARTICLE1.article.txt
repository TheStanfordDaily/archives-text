# STANFORD ASKED TO AID THE PAGEANT MOVEMENT
## OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW PROGRESS OF WESTERN PEOPLES. Professor H.D. Gray, Member of the Exposition Pageant Committee Answers Many Questions.

By Professor 11. I). Gray.
People have been asking each other
lately just what a pageant was, and
have leen consistently refusing to give
each other any particularly lucid an
swer.
A pageant is an historical drama
consisting of several episodes which
are not woven into a connected plot.
It i:> usually produced on a large scale,
in the open air; it may be in panto
nii'iie, or it may have words or music,
it luu no rules of construction, no set
length, no other limitations of any
sort thai are imposed by the imagina
tion of the composers and the interest
of the audience.
The recent revival of this ancient
form of entertainment is due. I think
to a very interesting cause, â€”and it is
this which will make the pageant of
1915, if it is rightly planned and ade
quately staged, the great distinctive
feature of the Panama-Pacific exposi
tion. For a pageant such as we plan
for this occasion is more than a mag
nificent spectacle; it is the picturesque
and dramatic expression of the entire
people by whom the pageant is given.
Pageantry is ihe dramatic self-expres
sion of a people at an advanced stage
of civilization, just as communal poet
ry and early religious drama were of
le.-s sophisticated peoples. The writ
ing of a drama for the stage has be
come a highly technical task, and the
actors, too, are more remote from the
attempt of the people to write its own
story once more, to give expression
to the community rather than to a dis
tant playwright and a passing troupe
of professional actors; it is the liber
ated patriotism of the audience itself,
proud of its accomplishment and of its
history; it speaks the voice of the peo
ple, and it should express the whole
people, and be in a way spontaneous
and friendly.
California.
So this should not be a mere "show"
devised by an English stage manager;
and Mr. Benson would be the last man
in the world to deflect the pageant
from its historical and local signifi
cance. "CALIFORNIA" should, I take
it, be the name and the subject of our
pageant; and consequently it should
show every important phase in the de
velopment of the people, and be writ
ten and presented, as far as possible,
by the people themselves. Any epi
sode in the history of California could
be taken by any institution, community,
or organization which stands for some
thing in the State, and presented be
fore the committee in competition for
a place in the great pageant. This has
not been decided upon; but if some
such plan is adopted, Stanford may be
gin at once to write and prepare its
pageant. Even for its own sake, such
a pageant, or pageant episode, as we
might compose and produce here would
have its very great interest and value.
It would give more opportunities both
in composition and in acting than are
now furnished by the plays and op
eras we give; it would have a wider
appeal and a greater audience; and,
best of all, it would bring to a focus
the patriotism of Stanford to the state
and nation.
I know this sounds somewhat "up
in the air;" and what was said lately
by our distinguished visitor seemed
to some of us to lack definiteness and
practicality. The reason is that these
matters are new. and have not been re
duced from the dreams of their in
ventors to actual performance. Es
pecially iu this country, where we
have no large leisure class interested
in matters of this sort, the evolution
of the pageant is far from accom
plished. We are still in the stage of
the miracle-play, where different epi
sodes of the great cycle were acted In
different guilds; and I am only pro
posing that Stanford should have its
appropriate place in the pageant-cycle.
I'iiuHinls Evolving.
Hut that pageantry is evolving may
he seen on all hands. Several cities
and towns in the East have given their
history in pageant form; and Peter
borough, N. H., leads the country in
its yearly tribute to MacDowell, the
great composer who lived there. This
is, a pageant in musical setting. Two
vastly different aspects of evolving pa
geantry may be found in the historic
and symbolic elements introduced in
the Mardi Gras celebration at New Or
leans and the famous and once-thrill
ing stage-coach episode in the "Huf
falo Hill Wild West Show." Hut with
in the State of California itself there
are at least three approximations to the
final pageant which are of the very
greatest significance. These are the
Bohemian Club "jinks," the Fourth of
.Tilly pageant at Carmel, and the Mis
sion play in Los Angeles. The tre
mendous appeal of each of these is in
dicative' of what the great pageant may
be when it comes.
