Since the address by Frederick R.
Benson in which he made an appeal

to Stanford to assist in
the staging the grand

pageant at the Panama-
Pacific Exposition, there has been a
great deal of speculation among the
students as to the nature of the pa
geant and the part Stanford is to play.
Upon request, Professor H. D. Gray,
who is a member of the Exposition
pageant committee has furnished us
with a definite idea of what the pa
geant is to be.
While the plans of the committee
are far from complete, the "Califor
nia" scheme suggested by Professof
Gray seems to be the most logical se
lection that can lie made. If this idea
is carried out it will be necessary for
the various institutions in the State to
furnish episodes. As one of the lead
ing factors in the history of California,
Stanford should be proud to join in
such a fete, and in entering would
put forth such efforts as would make
California proud of having numbered
in its pageant the story of Stanford.
