### Scorer 
Heavy rains on Friday evening pre
vented the playing of the Varsity-1 re
land baseball game on Saturday. A
light work out for the battery aspir
ants was the only practice indulged in
by any of the players.
The auxiliary field has been put into
shape and will be used extensively
from now on.
On Wednesday at 4:30 the Varsity
will play the University of Santa
Clara the first, game of a long series
between the two nines.
Nine of the eleven California men
who faced the Cardinal during the In
tercollegiate series of last year are
expected to report for the first prac
tice at Herkeley the last of the week
