A team will be or

mine of Encina Gymnasium.
With the expectation of an active
season on the court, Professor R. R
Long has appointed a committee to
assist him in arranging the schedule.
The men who are to serve, are: F.
Price, '13, R. W. Wilcox, '13, W. B.
Blodget.'la, L. R. Reynolds, '15, and
S. S. Schnetzler, '15.
Already a number of games have
been planned, but the schedule is still
far from complete. Two contests with
California will be the most important
of the semester. One game is to be
played on Encina Court, with the re
turn match at California.
The Encina five will also appear
twice against, both Santa Clara
and the College of the Pacific. Among
the other games which have already
been scheduled, are the contests with
Berkeley and Oakland Y. M. C. A.'s.
Palo Alto High School and the Stock-
I ton All-Stars. Matches with Sacra
mento Athletic Association. Fort Bar-
I ry, San .lose Normal, and St. Mary's
are being arranged.
All-Stars First.
The team v. ill line up for the first
time this semester against the All-
Stars at Stockton on the evening c. -
January 24th. In last year's Pacific
Athletic Association, the All-Star quin
tet won tiie unlimited championship.
For the first time permission has
been obtained from the Board of
Trustees to hold these contests on the
indoor courts in Encina Gymnasium
and to charge admission in order to
defray the expenses of bringing oppo
nents here.
With the opening of the Pacific Ath
letic Association tournament in March,
two teams will be entered; one in the
unlimited and the other in the 140
pound class.
So that all who come out for the
sport may have a chance to play, Pro

foremost of it's opponents. Against
the weaker teams, lie will place either
a second or a third five. Practice will
be held on Tuesdavs, Thursdays and
Saturdays at 4:30 in the gymnasium.
