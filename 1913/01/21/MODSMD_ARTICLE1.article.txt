ber of people were presented last even
ing by Associate Professor Payson J.
Treat of the history department. The
talk was given before an open meet

"We entered China from a back
door," he began, "coming inland from
Korea to the Manchurian province. It J
is unbelievable that the Japanese!
could roll back the forces of a tirst
class power from such naturally pro
tected country as Manchuria. Every
where is evidence of the Japanese. The
newspaper reports that Japan already
owned southern Manchuria are false.
They can never have more than a com
mercial control. There are 10,000 Chi
nese to one Japanese. The only dan
ger of Japanese annexation was at the
close of the war and that time is now
passed."
Pleased W if h Troops.
Speaking of the road to Pekin he
said. "We passed under the guardian
ship of seven different nations along
this railroad, first the Japanese, then
the Americans and the Russians and
so on.and 1 must say that the Ameri
can troops compared very favorably
and made a countryman feel proud.
They were tall, alert, clean cut men.
fine representatives of the nation."
r l he I eauties of Pekin were touched |
on, then turning to Hankow, the cen
ter of the recent revolution, Professor
Trent s;>id. "The Imperialist troops set
fire to the city and burned over the
greater part after they had driven back
the untrained forces of the revolu
tionists. It is often thought that the
Chin"se are net brave but their stub
born defence here showed the great
est lirav 'i y. Hankow is already being
re 1 nil) by money borrowed from the
Unite I States, and if will le the first
modern cily in China."

"Except for Hankow there are prac
tically no signs of devastation to mark
the recent revolution. It has been a
change in spirit more than a change in
the personnel of t lie Government.
There is $60,000,000 worth of opium
in the storehouses of China which the
Chinese are not using. Ihe govern
ment, in spite of the counter influence
of a great European power is makiing
every effort to stamp out the opium
evil.
"It is evident." he continued, "to
anyone who has been in China during
the last year that the new republican
government is firmly founded. Ihe
United States has lost an opportunity
to increase the good will tor our peo
ple and the high regard for our gov
ernment. which prevails by not being
the first to recognize the new repub
