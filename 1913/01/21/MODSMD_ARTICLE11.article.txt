### 
There is one matter that The Daily
Palo Alto would like to call to the at-

tention of the student
body in connection with
the Intercollegiate Athle-

tic Agreement. Under the presentagree
ment student assistants in the gymna
sium who receive pay for their services
are not allowed to participate in Stan
ford-California contests. This is in
strict accord with the A. A. U. rule
concerning professionalism , which
Inirs from the ranks of amateurs, any
who receive money for athletic work.
We are of the opinion that an ex
ception should be made in the case of
the gymnasium assistants. They are
in tlie employ of the Hygiene depart
ment of the university and are no more
professional than the student assist
ants in any other department of tin
university. The only difference is that
they are performing physical labors
while the assistants in the other
branches are paid for mental work. The
purpose of the present rule is to keep
the collegiate sports free from profes
sionalism. We cannot see how the in
clusion of the gym assistants
among the list of amateurs will con
flict with this purpose.
The Athletic Agreement Committees
from Stanford and California meet next
week. The members will lie guided
by the sentiment of the student body
they represent. If there are any who
desire to express their ideas on this
subject their communications will lie
welcomed by The Daily Palo Alto.
