# Pre-Panama For All.
## 
### 
There seems to be a general belief
011 the part of a great number of the
student body that the Pre-Panama Ex
position which is to be held in the Zoo
logy building, Saturday afternoon and
evening is for women only. The mem
bers of Cap and Gown, who are in
charge of the affair are particularly
anxious to dispel this idea. Ther 1 are
10 lie special entertainments in the na
ture of food, roller-coasters, games of
chance, and "nickel crawls" designed
to attract the male contingent.
