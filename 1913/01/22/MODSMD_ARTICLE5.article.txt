### 
Dr. Jordan addressed the Y. W. C. A.
Tuesday afternoon upon "Dr. Thoburn;
A Spiritual Life in a College Commun
ity." The late Dr. Thoburn will be
remembered as former Professor of
Hionomics and teacher of practical
Christianity. In connection with his
religious teachings, Dr. Jordan spoke
at some length of his simple, lucid
practical creed, and his great influence
upon Stanford students. This creed
taught a philosophy of present oppor
tunities. "No one," said Dr. Jordan,
"who does his or her best can escape
the fundamentals of Christianity."
