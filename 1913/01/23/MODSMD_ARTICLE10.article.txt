For a clear frank discussion of the
problems that the student body has to

meet, the assembly today takes
the lead. After listening to the
several speakers there was not

a man present who could say that he
was not fully informed as to the pol
icy of our self-governing system and
the part he has to play. There were
no vague allusions to unexplainahle
circumstances. Each speaker stated
the true conditions and drove his
words straight to the mark.
Every man in the university is a
unit in the system of student control.
The Student Council is not an arbi
trary body. It is merely our judicial
representatives chosen to enforce the
rules that all of us subscribe to
when we become members of the Stan
lord Student Body. The punishments
they inflict are not their punishments
but ours, judged in the light of the
circumstances by our representatives.
We all realize perfectly where we
stand in this regard. If we will think
before we act we will never have oc
casion to punish ourselves. "A lit
tle forethought is better than a great
deal of afterthought" is a saying well
worth remembering.
We need more of such assemblies.
