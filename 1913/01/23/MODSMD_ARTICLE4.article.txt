# STUDENT CONTROL IS DISCUSSED BY THE MEN IN LARGE ASSEMBLY
## 
### 
Problems of Student Control were
frankly discussed at the Men's As
sembly during the 11:15 period. For
the guidance of the students, a definite
statement of the attitude of the Con
ference and Council toward the more
serious of the difficulties which are
likely to arise in a college community
was made by E. F. Kern, '13, Presi
dent of the Conference, and by K. L.
Schaupp, '12, Student Adviser. The
oresent status of the Stanford Union
iroject and certain phases of execu
five committee work were explained
by I. I. Ingraham, '13, Campus Chair
man of the Union, and by A. W. Am
brose. '13, Student Body President.
Ambrose presided over the assem
bly. In opening it he said "The pur
oo.e of this meeting is to afford op
•jortunity for a very informal discus
sion of student problems. For that
reason it was thought best to have
-Indents only in attendance." After
>\-phuning the necessity for certain
Ti-'tl'ods of the Executive Committee
which have been criticized by some.
Ambrose took up thp Intel-scholastic
Meet which is to be held in April. "The
'nterscholastic," ho said, "is handi
canped by a lack of funds for adequate
advertising. On the otlier hand Cali
fornia is going into publicity work
for its interscholastic in an ambitious
manner. Our meet cannot go any fur

ther unless we have more means to ad
vertise; and to this end there should
be some means of allowing to the In
terscholastic Hoard the advantage of
Student Body finances. Some have
proposed a Student Body amendment '
to this effect. But this plan is open to !
objections, and so the Executive Com
mittee lias decided that if petitioned it ,
will take over the Interscholastic and !
appoint the present board to manage
it. Thus we give the meet the backing
of Student Body finances without a
constitutional amendment."
When called for to express then
opinion in regard to this proposal, the
men by a unanimous rising vote dem
onstrated that their attitude is favor
able.
In an effectual appeal for the Stan
ford Union, 1. I. ingraham first ex
plained the nature and value of the
proposed clubhouse. He continued,
"We now have $22,000 in out of $43,-
000 pledged in 1910. Funds are com
ing in slowly at the present time, only
$70 having been paid this semeste.
But this $22,000 is enough to make the
Union an assured success: how soon
depends on you fellows. When the ,
plans are drawn we can estimate how !
much the Union will cost, and then we
are going to raise the money. It is up
to you fellows to come through."

Kern told of the
Constitution of the
Conference and
Council. "The Con
ference is a repre
sentative bo d y
of uperclassmen
elected from de
partments. Any
department having
40 members is en-

titled to a representative, and the
smaller ones combine for purposes of
representation. Before we had Stu
dent Control the Conference was
merely an advisory body, but now it is
executive in character. It elects the


Karl Scliaupp


<<ene Ken;
Student Council which has taken over
tne duties of the old faculty Student
Affairs Committee, and with whose
work a faculty members has never in
terfered. Ihe students brought up be
fore this committee are perfectly
frank with it, and this is an impor
tant advantage which was brought out
when Student Control was lirst pro
posed. in all its rulings tu date the
Council has acted realizing that it was
setting a precedent for the future."
Karl Schaupp said: "Dutch Rotu
used to tell of an ideal condition when
%e might be under Student Control.
The time came when we could get Stu
dent Control and we got it. Now we
must keep up the good work. As soon
as we stand still in Student Control
we are apt to slide. The Council
wants every man to be a man ac
cording to his own lights, but he must
not interfere with the rights ot
others."
Kern and Schaupp both took occa
sion to warn the men in no uncertain
terms that should necessity arise at
any time to deal with the drinking
problem, the Council would not depart
from the rulings which have always
been in force in regard to bringing
liquor upon the campus, either "with
in or without."
At the close of the Assembly a
straw vote in regard to the proposed
pageant in 1915 showed that the stu
dents were in favor of participation
in such an affair.

fore this committee are perfectly
frank with it, and this is an impor
tant advantage which was brought out
when Student Control was lirst pro
posed. in all its rulings tu date the
Council has acted realizing that it was
setting a precedent for the future."
Karl Schaupp said: "Dutch Rotu
used to tell of an ideal condition when
%e might be under Student Control.
The time came when we could get Stu
dent Control and we got it. Now we
must keep up the good work. As soon
as we stand still in Student Control
we are apt to slide. The Council
wants every man to be a man ac
cording to his own lights, but he must
not interfere with the rights ot
others."
Kern and Schaupp both took occa
sion to warn the men in no uncertain
terms that should necessity arise at
any time to deal with the drinking
problem, the Council would not depart
from the rulings which have always
been in force in regard to bringing
liquor upon the campus, either "with
in or without."
At the close of the Assembly a
straw vote in regard to the proposed
pageant in 1915 showed that the stu
dents were in favor of participation
in such an affair.
Problems of Student Control were
frankly discussed at the Men's As
sembly during the 11:15 period. For
the guidance of the students, a definite
statement of the attitude of the Con
ference and Council toward the more
serious of the difficulties which are
likely to arise in a college community
was made by E. F. Kern, '13, Presi
dent of the Conference, and by K. L.
Schaupp, '12, Student Adviser. The
oresent status of the Stanford Union
iroject and certain phases of execu
five committee work were explained
by I. I. Ingraham, '13, Campus Chair
man of the Union, and by A. W. Am
brose. '13, Student Body President.
Ambrose presided over the assem
bly. In opening it he said "The pur
oo.e of this meeting is to afford op
•jortunity for a very informal discus
sion of student problems. For that
reason it was thought best to have
-Indents only in attendance." After
>\-phuning the necessity for certain
Ti-'tl'ods of the Executive Committee
which have been criticized by some.
Ambrose took up thp Intel-scholastic
Meet which is to be held in April. "The
'nterscholastic," ho said, "is handi
canped by a lack of funds for adequate
advertising. On the otlier hand Cali
fornia is going into publicity work
for its interscholastic in an ambitious
manner. Our meet cannot go any fur

ther unless we have more means to ad
vertise; and to this end there should
be some means of allowing to the In
terscholastic Hoard the advantage of
Student Body finances. Some have
proposed a Student Body amendment '
to this effect. But this plan is open to !
objections, and so the Executive Com
mittee lias decided that if petitioned it ,
will take over the Interscholastic and !
appoint the present board to manage
it. Thus we give the meet the backing
of Student Body finances without a
constitutional amendment."
When called for to express then
opinion in regard to this proposal, the
men by a unanimous rising vote dem
onstrated that their attitude is favor
able.
In an effectual appeal for the Stan
ford Union, 1. I. ingraham first ex
plained the nature and value of the
proposed clubhouse. He continued,
"We now have $22,000 in out of $43,-
000 pledged in 1910. Funds are com
ing in slowly at the present time, only
$70 having been paid this semeste.
But this $22,000 is enough to make the
Union an assured success: how soon
depends on you fellows. When the ,
plans are drawn we can estimate how !
much the Union will cost, and then we
are going to raise the money. It is up
to you fellows to come through."

Kern told of the
Constitution of the
Conference and
Council. "The Con
ference is a repre

of uperclassmen
elected from de

department having
40 members is en-

titled to a representative, and the

"We now have $22,000 in out of $43,-
000 pledged in 1910. Funds are com
ing in slowly at the present time, only
$70 having been paid this semeste.
But this $22,000 is enough to make the
Union an assured success: how soon
depends on you fellows. When the ,
plans are drawn we can estimate how !
much the Union will cost, and then we
are going to raise the money. It is up
to you fellows to come through."

Kern told of the
Constitution of the
Conference and
Council. "The Con

Student Council which has taken over
tne duties of the old faculty Student
Affairs Committee, and with whose
work a faculty members has never in
terfered. Ihe students brought up be
fore this committee are perfectly
frank with it, and this is an impor
tant advantage which was brought out
when Student Control was lirst pro
posed. in all its rulings tu date the
Council has acted realizing that it was
setting a precedent for the future."
Karl Schaupp said: "Dutch Rotu
used to tell of an ideal condition when
%e might be under Student Control.
The time came when we could get Stu
dent Control and we got it. Now we
must keep up the good work. As soon
as we stand still in Student Control
we are apt to slide. The Council
wants every man to be a man ac
cording to his own lights, but he must
not interfere with the rights ot
others."
Kern and Schaupp both took occa
sion to warn the men in no uncertain
terms that should necessity arise at
any time to deal with the drinking
problem, the Council would not depart
from the rulings which have always
been in force in regard to bringing
liquor upon the campus, either "with
in or without."
At the close of the Assembly a
straw vote in regard to the proposed
pageant in 1915 showed that the stu
dents were in favor of participation
in such an affair.
