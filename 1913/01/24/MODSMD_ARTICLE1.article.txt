## NEW SYSTEM INAUGURATED TO SELECT TEAM. V.L. Sheldon, '15, R.L. Murray, '13, and L. Sloss, '15, Will Have Charge of Racquet Wielders. 
### 
With the appointment of a coaching
committee, an entirely new method of
selecting the tennis team was inaug
urated at ii. gathering of Stanford's
racquet wielders. Captain V. L. Shel
don, '15, R. L. Murray, '13, and L. Sloss,
' 1 r>, were chosen on the committee.
According to the system which has
been installed, each spring a coaching
committee of three men, picked by the
committee of the former year, will
rank the first ten players in the Uni
versity. 1 hese ten men will then play
in a continuous tournament, which
must be finished four weeks before the
third Saturday in Afiril. Any player
may challenge the man directly above
him and if victorious gains his place.
In case the challenger loses both men
retain (lie same position that they held
before the match.
At the close of the tournament, the
first four men in rank will constitute
the intercollegiate team, which meets
California in April.
Fair Competitive System.
Up to the adoption of the new plan
there has always been more or less
difficulty in picking the first player,
due to the method of selection. The
old system was to play four tourna
ments, the winners of each making a
place on the team. In this way four
men were selected, as the winner of
one tournament did not play in any of
the others. The difficulty arose be
cause all the players did not enter each
of the four tournaments and it was
therefore impossible to choose the best
man of the four as he had not met all
the others.
The present system is exceedingly
fair and prevents any favoritism in the
picking of the team. The man ranked
ten I y the committee can work up to
first place I y defeating in succession
the players directly ahead of him. In
case the challenger loses the first
match he is entitled to one more try
at the victor.
The coaching committee, which is to
have full charge of all tennis matters
and has also been invested with the
power to appoint, successors, was
the choice of all the men interested in
the snort in the University.
V the present tirtie the first eleven
players, as ranked by the committee,
are: (1) R. L. Murray, '13. (2) V. L.
Sheldon, '15, (3) W. N. L. Hutchinson.
