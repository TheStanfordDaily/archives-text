The women of the university have
been working diligently the past few

weeks under the supervision of
Cap and Gown to make the Pre-
Panama Exposition an interest-

ing affair. Judging from their pro
grams they have succeeded in arrang
ing a carnival of entertainments that
should interest all the members and
friends of the University. The pro
ceeds of the Exposition are to be tinn
ed over to the Women's Clubhouse
fund. This clubhouse will be to the
women what the Stanford Union is to
he for the men. The women have al
ways supported the entertainments
that the men have staged for the bene
fit of the Stanford Union and it be
hooves the men to reciprocate.
