# MIDWINTER "CHAPARRAL" WILL APPEAR ON THE CAMPUS NEXT MONDAY
## 
### 
"Chaparral" is scheduled to come on
the campus Monday in Midwinter form
echoing the laughs of his pages from
cover to cover, in a frame of mind to
smile at his own jokes. Scintillating
columns of pen and ink work show the
initials of M. W. Allen, '10, M. A,
Oliver, '15, A. T. King, '12, R. N. Wen
zel, 'If., Miss Hazel Clark, '15, and L.
I). Summerfield, '12.
"Star Gazers," "Opportunity," "The
Jews Harp," and "An Artist in His
Own Line," are captioned drawings
that crystalize the humor of Allen and
Wenzel.
Miss Clark has drawn a "500 to 1
Shot" girl's head to soften the bare
ness of a full page with wavy hair,
cupid's how mouth, and enthralling
eyes.
In the current issue, J. L. Duff, '13,
imbibes the spirit of the Muse, and
gives it expression in three stanzas of
protest against the call of some such
thing as wanderlust, called "The
Voices." Chaparral's custom of lay
ing aside the jester's implements
for a page each issue to offer a bit of
thoughtful verse has been well ob
served in the present instance.
In rhymed prose, dubbed "As Usual,"
K. Green, '13, outlines his plan of re
formed action for the new year, and
claims a right to a respected hearing
because he does the same thing each
yea.v
"Molly's Mistake," by L. D. Summer
field. '12, is a story of high and low
Stanfordites written in tableaus, and
illustrated. A new Fable in Slang
has been created.
A course in Accounting, conducted
by H. H. Beall, '11, admits the inac
countability of coeds' tastes, and at
tempts to figure out the inner work
ings of some other campus institu
tions.

A triad of "Now That's" considers
t.lie late action taken by the California
Rugby Union, cold rooms, and tryouts.
Contributors of short verse are: E.
W. Pugh, Ml, L. 1). Sunnnerfleld, '12,
P. Levy, '12, K. Green, '13, C. 11. Wintr
ler, '07, C. F. Paul, '13, M. A. Hagon,
ler, '07, C. P. Paul, '13, M. A. Hagen;
R. V. Iliggins, *16.
