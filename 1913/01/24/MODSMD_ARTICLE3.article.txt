# "THE ONLY WAY" CAST TO BE PHOTOGRAPHED IN CHARACTER ROLES
## Rhearsal of Dramatic Prologue to Dicken's Historical Story is Present Center of Effort. 
### 
Principals of "The Only Way" cast
will be photographed Sunday in tab
leau scenes from the play, with a back
ground gotten up for the occasion by
the Alcazar scenic studio, and in spec
ial costuming from Goldstein. The
photographer of the Bohemian Club
"Jinks" will picture the scenes. Cuts
will be made up from the pictures for
the posters.
Late rehearsals have been directed
with the purpose of running the lines
and "business" of the short prologue
of the play together to form a pleas
ing historical preface to the later
movement of four acts which throw
their characters into the maelstrom
of the French Revolution.
The characters who appear in the
prologue, and the names of the stu
dents who will essay their roles art
4veil for the first time, with the ex
ception of E. A. Wells, as Dr. Man
ette, who appears in the play proper.
The introductory action shows the
cause for his imprisonment in the Has
tily, .a condition which forms the mo
tif for the story that was conceived
by Charles Dickens. The persons
of the prologue are: Monsieur le Mar
tinis de St. Evremonde, father of the
Marquis de Evremonde of the play
(Charles Darnay)â€”H. J. Horde, '14.
The Vicompte W. Gross, 'IG.
Jean DeFarge, brother of the Ernest
DeFarge of the play
I. T. Ingraham, '13.
Dr. Manette E. A. Wells, '14.
Peasant D. Davy, 'IT).
Servants of the Marquis
H. M. Bellinger, '16 and C. W. Ide, '16.
Ingraham appears later in the role
of Ernest DeFarge.
The action, and impulse for later
action given in the prologue is that
Jean DeFarge seeks to revenge him
self on the elder Marquis for the se
duction of his sister, and is murdered
in an unequal duel. Dr. Manette, being
present hears the dying moans of De-
Farge's sister in an adjoining room,
gives expression to his indignation, and
is bundled off at the command of Evre
monde, to a living tomb in the Bastile.
\;i attempt on the part of an old
friend, Lcrry, and his daughter, Alice,
to "resore him to life" furnishes inci
dent for the four act drama.
The impression that is thrust from
every speech and bit of action in the
prologue is that the domineering sway
of the aristocrats of France over hum
bler people, their position outside the
pale of punishment for crime commit
ted on one lelow their station, is fo
menting the dissatisfied rumble of the
commoners into readiness for concert
ed revolt.
