# Patronize
## 
### 
There is another matter in connec
tion with the Palo Alto merchants that

The Daily Palo Alto
would like to call to the
attention of â€¢ the stu-

dents. This publication is supported
solely by advertising. The merchants
who advertise do so with the expecta
tion of pecuniary return but each
month when the manager makes his
collections he finds many who are not
receiving their share of student pat
ronage. Various stores are paying for
space in this publication and they car
ry first class goods. When you make
your purchases patronize those mer
chants who support your enterprises.
