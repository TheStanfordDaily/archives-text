Gross receipts of the Pre-Panama
Exposition reached $1,040.53 accord
ing to the report of Cap and Gown is
sued today. The profits have not as
yet been estimated as there are a num
ber of bills outstanding. Statement
will be issued tomorrow concerning
the net returns.
The Exposition was the most exe
tensive entertainment of the kind ever
attempted at Stanford. The Zoology
Building presented a brilliant scene
throughout the afternoon and evening,
the gaiety lasting until nearly mid
night. The crowds animated by a
spirit of fun, drifted from the lobby
where the various nations were repre
sented upward to the Midway and the
"Nickel Crawl" and back again to the
Cafe Chantant amid showers of con
fetti and shouts of laughter. The up
stairs concessions were perhaps the
moat popular, being crowded during
the entire evening.
The cash prize of five dollars offered
for the most successful concession
was awarded to the Cafe Chantant
operated by La Liana. Both the Stan
ford shield offered by Alpha Omicron
Pi and the ukelele given by the Ha
waiian booth were won by J. H. Rea,
'13.
To Cap and Gown is due the credit
for the clever management, and evi
dent organization of the affair.
