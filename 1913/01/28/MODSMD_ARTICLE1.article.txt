# DRAMATIC IMPULSE RUNS RIOT IN "THE ONLY WAY"
## STRONG CHARACTER PORTRAYALS QUICKEN FOURTH ACT. Guillotine is Being Made to Fit Scene Depicting Bloody Sway of Paris Mob. 
### 
Four scenes of the fourth act, which
is i lie final chapter in the story of
"The Only Way," contain a great deal
of the dramatic impulse which bids to
make the offering of Sword and San
dals pulsate with the life of many
types of people.
A picture of La Force prison, dis
gorging its daily offering of victims to
the guillotine, as their names are
called one by one from the proscribed
lists, the crash of the falling axe, and
the demoniac acclaim of the Jacobin
throng as life blood floods the head
block, is drawn with an intensity of
sight and sound that revives the aban
doned passions of the Paris mob.
in tlie third scene, Miss M. F. Em
mons, '13, as Mimi, a friendless little
country girl who has been placed on
the death list, is given opportunity for
wonderful touches of deep apprecia
tion of her role, when her courage is
supported by Sidney Carton, (W. 15.
Owens, *14) who has willingly as
sumed the role and fate of his success
ful rival in love, Charles Darnay. The
tender sympathy and words of en
couragement used by Carton to
strengthen Mimi's resolve, the pathetic
and exquisite air of dependance dis
played by the poor girl, and the su
perb coolness of Fouchet (J. R. Mor
gan. '16) are given great depth of ex
pression by the trio of actors.
Far removed in station of life, but
drawn close by the common tie of
impending death, the three characters
created by Owens, Morgan, and Miss
Emmons will hold the sympathy of the
audience until the statje darkens for
the last time, and the axe is heard to
fall on the loved head of Carton, "52."
Changes of scenes in the final act
will be marked by darkening the stage
at four intervals, and making rapid
changes of effects. The guillotine
which will be need is being made in
San Francisco, in reproduction of the
tvoe used during the Reign of Terror.
