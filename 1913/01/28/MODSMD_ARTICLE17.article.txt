The following article appeared in
the Los Angeles Times under the cap
tion, "Is This Cowardice." The story is
the work of Owen R. Bird pseudo
amateur sporting writer for the south
ern paper.
"Last night the authorities of Stan
ford University sent word to the Uni
versity of Southern California stating
that this semester the Stanford team
would not journey south. Manager
l'.ui hank wrote only three days ago
that his squad would be in Los An
geles on March I~> and all details
would soon lie arranged.
"Now, some power higher up than
the manager has stopped the good
work. The southern public has just
begun to make the U. S. C.-Stanford
game the big sporting event of the
year. This year for the first time,
dope points to the local university as
the winner and Stanford refuses to
take a chance.
"This action on her part will lead
a great many sport-loving fans in this
part of the State to entertain grave
doubts as to whether the hitherto
boasted sportsmanship has been the
real genuine article.
"The report that the University of
California has withdrawn from the
Rugby union looks a bit bad, but Cali
fornia's Rugby team made such a clean
showing here and in other matters have
been so sportsmanlike toward South
ern California of late, that it begins to
look as if some other northern insti
tutions would suffer by comparison.
It is rumored that U.S.C. is about
to enter into a dual agreement with
University of California. The Tro
jans and the Bears would pull off some
finish fights. Their athletic policies
are very similar —both are everlasting
ly after the championship of their sec
tion of the State and then for taking
on all comers. Both will probably
send teams East this year.
"A man well up on intercollegiate
relations in the north wrote here from
San Francisco a short time ago stat
ing that if Stanford University main
tained its present attitude in regard to
all sports and tried to continue its pol
icy of dictatorship, intercollegiate re
lations in the north would go to the
dogs and California would look to
U.S.C. for future competition."
