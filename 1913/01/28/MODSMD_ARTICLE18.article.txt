How a man. who is supposed to
mssess a few grains of intelligence,

can write such rot is
beyond us. Nor is this
the first time that this

same writer, pursuing his policy of
partiality, lias been guilty of publish
ing perverted stories of Stanford. In
view of the true state of affairs as set
forth by Graduate Managers Burbank
i Upv:>in the accompanying col

umn, Bird's remarks stand out as ma
liciously untrue.
From such a man as Bird, the state
ment that California and IT.l T . S. C. will
become intercollegiate rivals of the
Coast is ludicrous. If Mr. Bird's head
was not of billiard ball composition he
would remember that the Blue and
Gold has never recognized the south
ern institution as an athletic equal.
With the exception of last fall when
California consented to play a post
season football game between thp var
sities, the transbay institution lias
been represented by their freshmen
teams in their contests with U. S. C.
An for Stanford's polio.v of dictator
ship, mentioned by Bird as coming
from one who is well up on northern
affairs but whose name he refuses to
disclose, probably for .fear of having
his physiognomy marred, it is ridicu
lous, to say the least. Stanford has
always stood and will continue to
stand for what is fair in athletics;
and her reputation for clean play
bears out the statement.
