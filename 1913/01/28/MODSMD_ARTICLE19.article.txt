# The 						True Conditions.

### D.W. Burbank 
"There is absolutely no ill feeling of
any kind or nature between Stanford
ami the University of Southern Cali
fornia; nothing but the best of feeling
exists. The situation is this: Mi.
Bovard and myself had negotiations
practically complete for our annual
meet to be held on March 15. At this
point Dad Moulton and Captain E. P.
Campbell decided that it would be best
not to take a track trip this spring.
They arrived at this decision for two
reasons, first, they wish to beat the
University of California this year at
all odds; second, they realize that the
preparation necessary to meet the Uni
versity of Southern California brings
the men to the pink of condition so
early that it is impossible to keep
them there from four to six weeks un
til the California meet on April 10. I
at once telegraphed Bovard as follows:
'W. B. Bovard—
Hegret plans changed. \\ill take
no truck trip this semester. Want you
here. Writing.
1), \V„ Burbank'
We have since arranged for the
University of Southern California to
come here for a meet on April 7.
1 have not seen any newspaper ar
ticle, but if it intimates hard feeling
it does an unfair and unjust thing and
is guilty of rank yellow journalism."
D. W. Burbank.
In reply to Burbank's telegram the
following message was received from
Bovard:
"Hard feeling not official. News
papers and student dopesters keenly
disappointed. I will call at your oi'lice
Tuesday p.u>."
