# SITE IS SELECTED FOR UNION BUILDING
## TRUSTEES TO DONATE GROUND NEAR POST OFFICE. Chairman Ingraham to Begin Active Campaign to Secure Payment of Subscriptions. 
### 
The Stanford Union building will in
all probability be reared upon the site
between the Postoftice and the elec
tric railway tracks. This location has
been found the most advantageous in
every respect of those proposed, and
the Trustees of the University have
agreed to donate it for the Union upon
mere formal acceptance of the plans
for the building. By the selection of
this site opportunity is given for the
erection of a clubhouse in the quad
rangular or any other style, with am
ide ground in the rear and space upon
all other sides.
F. H. Fowler, a graduate student in
the Civil Engineering department, who
is associated with H. C. Hoover, '9a,
in working for the Union, has charge
of the preparation of architectural
plans during the latter's absence. Com
petitive designs for the clubhouse and
grounds are now being worked upon
by various architects of note. When
the final plans are accepted they v.-ill
be at once submitted to the Trustees
for ratification and the site near the
Postoftice will then become the prop
erty of the Union.

I. 1. Ingraham, '13, Campus Chair
man of the Union, is now about to en
ter upon an active campaign to induce
students who have pledged money to
the Union to pay in the amount of
their subscriptions. He declares that
it is most essential that this be done
it actual work is to be speedily com
menced uiion the clubhouse. Many
who in the glow of enthusiasm pledged
considerable sums to the Union after
wards found their ardor cooling and
now have nothing to their credit upon
the secretary's books save a row of
ciphers. Constructive work upon the
Union is to be in order shortly after
the return of H. C. Hoover from Eng
land, which is expected in about two
months; and with such signs of real
life in the air it is expected that the
delinquent ones will hasten to pay in
their subscriptions. Chairman Ingra
ham states that it is the prompt pay
ment of the little five and tens which
will make the Union a reality.
