# BLOOD-GLUTTED PARIS MOB IN TRIBUNAL SCENE
## PRINCIPAL AND MINOR ACTORS REHEARSE TOGETHER. Students Tread the Boards in Effective Court Room Picture From Dickens' Story. 
### 
Students who are to depicit the bru
tality and senseless vacilliation of the
blood-gutted Coninmnistic mob of
Paris in the trial of Charles Darnay,
rehearsed the third act of "The Only
Way" last night with the principals),
under the direction of Coach Mathieu.
Successful effort was made to install
in the mob actors the spirit of the
French patriots which lead them head
long into their excesses of fiendish
ness in treatment of the aristocrats.
The impassioned plea of Sidney Cai
ton (W. H. Owens, '14) for the life of
Darnay, who is being hounded in court
as an aristocrat hateful to the mob be
cause fate lias made him the son of
the hated Marquis Evremonde, suc
ceeds in gaining the sympathy of the
tribunal, and the prisoner is acquitted.
The tide of sympathy is turned to
hatred by the harangue of Jean l)e-
Farge (I. I. Ingraham) who uses his
rude eloquence to obtain vengeance on
the son of the cruel marquis who had
in years gone ruined his sister and
killed his brother. Darnay is quickly
retried, and sentenced to the guillotine,
amid the acclaim of the court throng,
and is hustled away to prison.
Ingraham throws himself into the
character of DeFarge with a complete
abandonment that results in strong
portrayal of the Jacobin leader.
F. I!. Hilton, Ml, as president of the
tribunal does effoctive work. Miss R.
Borough, '14, as Lucy Manette, sweet
heart of Darnay, Miss M. F. Emmons,
'14, as Mimi, and E. A. Wells, '14, as
Dr. Manette. whose lines in the. third
act are not heavy, promise compelling
work in other scenes of the drama.
