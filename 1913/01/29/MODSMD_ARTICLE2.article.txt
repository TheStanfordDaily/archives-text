and A. C. Sandstroni, '14, are new mem
bers of the University Conference.
This honor was accorded them by
members of their respective depart

afternoon. Lantz was elected from the
Geology and Mining department, Mc-
Kee hy the Electrical Engineers, and
Sandstroni by the Civil Engineers. No
member was elected from the com
bined Zoology, Entomology and Psych
ology departments, owing to lack of
a quorum. To be more exact, one
qualified voter was present at the
meeting of the three allied depart
ments.
