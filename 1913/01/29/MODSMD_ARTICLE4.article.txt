# CALIFORNIA CENSURED BY UNION FOR WITHDRAWING
## Committee Says State University Refuses to Put Itself on Level With Other Clubs. 
### 
Graduate Manager D. W. Burbank,
L. 15. Reading, and J. R. llickey, as a
committee of the Rugby Union, have
prepared the promised official state
ment of the union concerning the at
titude of that organization in respect
to the resignation of the University of
California.
The statement in full is as follows:
"The California Rugby union was
formed by the University of California,
Stanford University, the Barbarian
and Olympic clubs, St. Mary's and
Santa Clara colleges, and the univer
sities of Southern California and Ne
vada during last spring and summer.
"Delegates from these clubs met and
adopted a constitution which announ
ced its objects to be to foster and con
trol Rugby football in this state, to ar
range visits to this state, to manage
California representative teams, and
drew up a set of rules and bylaws,
same in accordance with those adopt
ed by the Rugby unions of Great Brit
ain, Australasia, South Africa, and
France. All was done voluntarily and
unanimously, and all clubs seemed
united in the general idea that organi
z-ition was not only desirable but es
sential. rt was recognized that Rugby
had developed many problems that
would take an organization to cope
with.
C. C. Aided Australian Trip.
"1 he immediate burden assumed by
the union on its organization was the
financing and management of the Aus
tralian trip. This it successfully did —
all members cooperating fully. The
University of California was foremost
in this endeavor, furnishing the presi
dent and several men who were very
active workers and guaranteeing their
share of the money needed, and also
getting their share of the games.
"It became necessary to pick an all
star team to play the Australians. In
two meetings, in which the University
of California was well represented and
voted, a committee was chosen to se-

lect the team. The University of Cal
i'ornia immediately presumed that the
se'ected committee would discriminate
to the interests of the state institution
•(layers and before the team was an
nounced or the game played voiced
themselves as opposed to any commit
tee on which the University of Califor
nia did not have a man. Consistent
with this attitude the executive com
mittee of the University of California
voted on November 0, 1912, to with
draw from the Rugby union, the resig
nation to take effect November 17.
This action, however, was not made
public until November 11. The matter
was thoroughly discussed. Every club
could not be represented on a neces
sarily small committee, and it was felt
that, inasmuch as the 1 niversity of
California and every one else had had
a hand in choosing the committee, it
was quite fair. The committee re

mained intact and chose the team,
which vindicated their judgment in the
All Star-Australian match.
"Now conies California and resigns
from the union. It demands that
though all agreed on a proposition, in
cluding themselves, yet that such
agreement must he but advisory, and
of course, all others must be free to
have 'unquestioned authority' on their
own field. They demand independence.
No one would deny it to them. The
union is only a mutual agreement by
independent units—not a mystic oli
garchy. Hut the union does ask,
through each club to each other:
"First—That eaeli will state what
its proposed actions will be in certain
events,
"Second—That all matters of mo
ment to all the clubs be discussed
thoroughly and impartially.
"Third—That each member do as the
majority decides to be best.
"Fourth—That all rules and bylaws
adopted should be observed.
"Rut the University of California re
fuses this: refuses to put itself on a
level with the other cllibs; refuses to
join in the common council and take
its common sense to abide by the ma-

jority. The University of California
must rule or not play. It must stand
not on principle or right of reason in
its differences but on its strength. It
announces that no one's will but its
own shall dictate as to games on its
own field. It would have an advisory
union where delegates meet to discuss
and exchange ideas, but never binding
ly agree. It would emasculate the or
iginal union and leave it a skeleton of
paper—a monument to one member's
self sufficiency.
"Further in its demand for such 'in
dependence,' California demands rep
resentation on all selection commit
tees of representative teams. That, in
itself, is an expression of distrust in
the knowledge and fairness of all other
Rugby men. Such a committee has al
ready been chosen and has acted with

and another could do equally well,
probably, with a University of Califor
nia member. Rut the demand for
membership is ill advised and is indi
cative of a distrust which is not whole
some.
Cuion Promotes Hntrby.
"The third basis of the University of
California's demand is that the union
should not require any of its mem
bers to get its sanction before playing
against teams outside of the union, if
the union is to be the propagator of the
best ideas of football evolved from the
opinions and experiences of its con
stituents. then when issues warrant, it
must maintain these ideas by execu
