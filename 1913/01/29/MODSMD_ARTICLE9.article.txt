On the iirst page of this paper is
found the complete statement of the

California Rugby Union in
regard to the resignation
of the University of Cali-

fornia. As usual, the Union sets forth
every phase of the affair in a clear and
impartial manner. There is no at
tempt to hoodwink the readers and
give false impressions.
After carefully reviewing all sides of
the matter there is only one conclusion
to lie reached. The Rugby 1 nion was
completely justified in t lie action they
took.
The reasons given for the resigna
tion are laughable. To require a Cali
fornia representative on every commit
tee of tlie Union because that institu
tion has more members than any of the
others is farcical. The suggestion
that the I'nion be nothing more than
an arbitration board is a weak-kneed
excuse for their action. The difficulty
that Intercollegiate Arbitration Com
mittees have in reaching any conclu
sion when they are only two institu
tions concerned, makes such a scheme
appear ridiculous when we think of the
merry time if eight arbitration boards
crot together, each with the determina

tion to get everything for their con
stituents.
As for California, we do not believe
that the majority of the members of
that institution would have consented
to the withdrawal had the uncolored
facts been presented to the associated
students for ratification.
Again we repeat, California is only
spiting herself.
