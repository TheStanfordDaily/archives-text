# Interscholastic
## 
### 
Last night the Executive Committee
formally took over the control of the

annual Interscholas
tic Track Meet. At
the same time the

supervision of the event was left in the
hands of the Hoard of Governors who
have so successfully conducted the
meets in the past. The purpose of
this change is to enable the Board to
have access to tlie Student Body funds
in promoting the contests. In former
years the Interscholastics have been
self-supporting but the competition
that is now in the field necessitates
greater expenditures.
Our meets in the past have been the
best managed of any on the Coast and
with the additional resources, this
year's Tnterscholastic should be big
ger and better than ever. All that is
needed is the organized support of the
Student Body. The event is now a
regular Student Body affair and if we
are to maintain our present reputa
tion in face of the competition we
must all get behind the Board of Gov
ernors and boost. Tf every man will
write to his high school and impress
upon it the importance of the event
we will have an Tnterscholastic here
in April, the like of which has never
been seen on the Coast.
