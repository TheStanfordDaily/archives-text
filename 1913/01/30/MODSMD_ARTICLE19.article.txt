## 
### 
February 17 has been set as the date
for the tryouts for the annual Fresh
nian-Sophomore debate. "Resolved,
That the immigration to the United
States of all unskilled laborers of the
Slavonic, Hellenic, and Italic races
of Eastern and Southeastern Europe
should be prohibited," is the question
which the candidates for the teams
will discuss. This is the question chos
en for the Tri-state debates, and the
Freshmen and Sophomore contestants
will be enabled to enter the tryouts for
that debate on February 21 with little
additional work.
A team of three men and an alter
nate will be selected from both the
Freshmen and Sophomore classes. An
unusually small number of men have
signified their intention of trying out
for the underclassmen debate. The
contestants from the Sophomore class
are particularly few. E. C. Smith, '13,
or F. L. Foster, '13, will receive the
names of those desiring to try out, and
state that they expect the lists to be
considerably swelled in the near future,
since this contest has in the past been
considered as of prime importance
both as a forensic event and as an out
let for interclass rivalry.
