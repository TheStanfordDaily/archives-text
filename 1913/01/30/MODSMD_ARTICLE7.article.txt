of the Library Building will be a thing
ol" the past. The preliminary work on
the razing oi' the structure, which was
started Monday, is finished and the ac
tual wrecking has begun. The Pio
neer Construction of San Francisco
has charge of the destruction and the

loomed up as a land-mark since the

dome to the ground, the construction
company has erected a trolley.

confined to the dome, the bricks being
carried down the trolley in a car. A
derrick is to be erected and the com
pany has one donkey engine here, with
When the Library was wrecked it

the Library was laid by Charles G.
Lathrop, treasurer of the University,
on May 1">, 100r.. There are no definite
