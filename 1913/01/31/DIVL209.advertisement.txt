Positively no experience or literary excellence necessary.
No "flowery language" is wanted.
The demand for photoplays is practically unlimited.

earth" in their attempts to get enough good plots to
supply the ever increasing demand. They are offering
$100, and more, for single scenarios, or written ideas.
We have received many letters from the film manu
facturers, such as VITAGRAPH, EDISON, ESSANAY,
LUBIN, SOLAX, IMP, REX, RELIANCE, CHAM
PION, COMET, MELIES, ETC., urging us to send
photoplays to them. We want more writers and will
gladly teach you the secrets of success.
