# LEADER GIVES HISTORY OF NATIONAL MOVEMENT.
## S.A. Moffat, as Commissioner of Boy Scouts of America Tells of Origin of Organization. 
### 
S. A. Moffat, National Field Scout
Commissioner of the Boy Scouts of
America, this morning explained to a
large number, the workings of the Hoy
Scout Movement. He also gave a
brief history of the work, which began
in England, shortly after the Hoer War.
He told how Haden Powell, A British
officer, noticed that much of the scout
ing work was distasteful to the sol
diers. With the aid of some of his
friends he fell upon the scheme of the
Scout movement as one that would
interest the rising generation and
make the work of the scouts one of
interest. Although the inspiration for
the movement came through a military
channel, its primary purpose is not
military, but educational.
At noon today at a banquet lunch,
attended by a large number of Palo
Alto business men, the scout leader
spoke of his work and the relation it
bears to the future business of the
country.
Tomorrow morning at 9:1.1 confer
ence will be held in room 50, at which
President David Starr Jordan will pre
side. Discussions will follow each
talk. Addresses will be made by Mr.
Moffat and Professor E. P. Cubberley,
of the Education department. At noon,
luncheon will be served by the Camp
Fire Girls, under the direction of Miss
Laura Herron, '14. After lunch, W. E.
Talbert, '13, scout commissioner, and
S. A. Moffat, will continue the discus
sions.
