# SLOW TRACK IMPEDES RUNNERS IN WORK-OUT
## DESPITE LOOSE CINDER PATH MEN IMPROVE. Gard and Murray Make Good Time in Dashes. All Distances Were Shortened. 
### 
Although marred by the unsatisfac
tory condition of tlie track the results
of the second meet of the season on
Saturday showed "Dad" Moulton and
Captain Campbell that the non-varsity
men and Freshmen must lie given a
prominent place in the early prognos
tication for the success of the Cardinal
this year. The runners were handi
capped by the soft cinder path and the
time for the various distances suffered
accordingly. Hut few of the varsity
men participated in the meet.
The shortened dashes again brought
out the stellar performances of the
meet. F. S. Card, '14, surprised the
cinder path enthusiasts by covering a
sixty yard heat in G:4. F. S. Murray,
'10, was accredited with the record of
a fast 28:1 in the 220 yard run. F. E.
McClure, '15, won his heat for the
same distance in 23:2. The half mile
shortened to 600 yards introduced a
new runner in the person of H. B. Wol
c( tt. '14, who scored his initial win in
1:21: 1.
