# California Note.
## 
### 
More than a hundred men are en
rolled in the Varsity squad at Califor
nia. and four or live 'eights' are on
the water every afternoon. Four vet
erans of last year's crew are in the
number, Denman, Eaton, Shaw and
Coxswain Mutton.
The first severe test for the candi
dates will be the interclass races,
which are to be held the middle of
this month. This will also be the first
opportunity for the crew enthusiasts
to see the newly adopted 'Cornell'
stroke used in competition.
