Outplayed both at the bat and in the
Held the Stanford Varsity lost to lie
land's independents on Saturday 4 to
0. The Cardinal men were unable to
connect with the ball at the right
times, their three hits being far scat
tered while twelve of the players suc
cumbed via the strikeout route.
For live innings Gragg pitched shut
out ball allowing the professionals but
two hits, while his team went out in
one, two, three order for the first four
frames of the game, lu the sixth the
visitors gained a run without the aid
of a hit when Spencer reached first
on Workman's error, stole second and
scored when McCloskey let a throw
get away from him.
In the next inning Hayes went in the
box and disposed of the Leaguers in
good order. But the eighth frame
proved his undoing. A base on balls
and three hits, one double, scored
three runs.
Stanford's best chance came in this
same inning when Childs singled and
reached third on miscues but could
get 110 farther. Three double plays by
the Varsity were features of the game.
Ireland's familar line of talk and the
presence of the Stanford band enliv
ened the afternoon.
