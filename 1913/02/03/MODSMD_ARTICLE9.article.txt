# Why Not Saturday?
## 
### 
Everytinie there is a seat sale for a
play in the Assembly Hall a wholesale

cutting of 8:1."> classes en
sues. This is not the
fault of the purchasers of

tickets. It is impossible for all to
draw before the last bell rings and
then those who hold the lower num
bers must remain for most of the hour
in order to secure their tickets. The
present system of drawing for choices
is the best that can be had but it
could be employed just as well on Sat
urdays as on Mondays and there would
not be the customary loss of college
work. Custom seems to be the only
reason for opening the sale on Mon
day. We would like to see the Sopho
mores establish a new precedent and
make Saturday the opening day.
