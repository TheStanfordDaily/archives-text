# WOMEN OF POWERFUL DRAMA RADIATE CHARM
## TYPES OF PLAY SHOW STRENGTH OF WEAKER SEX. Miss. R. Borough, â€™14, and Miss M.E. Emmons, '13, Offer Convincing Delineation of Roles. 
### 
Feminine charm that radiates its
fullest measure of appeal in the time
of great demand for womanly strength,
not the kind that blooms its loveliness
over the tea-cup, has been drawn with
soft colors into the roles of Lucy Man
ette, i he Thread of Gold, and of Mimi,
Carton's French ward in "The Only
Way.'' Lucy, the innocent motif for
the final tragic heroism of the drama
which i.--. pictured in the death of Car
ton, and Mimi, the little maid who hides
a hopeless love for her master until
she stands with him under shadow of
the guillotine, live their lives of sim
ple grandeur with an enveloping
sweetness. Difference in position on
the rounds of the presumptive social
ladder is swept from mind by the pres
ence of common worth.
Lucy Manette of the play retains the
same qualities of character that were
given her in the great, novel in which
the dramatist found the source of his
triumph. But Mimi is a character
introduced gently for the first time in
"The Only Way." She is a more inti
mately conceived elaboration of the
terrified seamstress who held the hand
of Carton in the tumbril that carried
its offering to the "bloody barber."
She suggests the womanly courage of
Miis Pros of "The Tale of Two Cities."
But she is something more than those
two characters combined. The fore
note of a tragic fate is made to sound
in her voice, and the trampling rage
of the ominus mob of Paris shrieks in
her ears.
.Miss It. Borough, '14, and Miss M. F.
Emmons, 'I I, have realized the latent
wonder of their respective roles of
Lucy and Mimi that the cold type of
their lives cannot give. They have
learned to live, not to make believe,
the reality of their stage creatures
