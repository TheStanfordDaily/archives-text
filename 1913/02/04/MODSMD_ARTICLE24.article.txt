# COMMITTEE ON HEALTH ADVISES VACCINATION
## SMALL-POX IN BAY CITIES REASON FOR ACTION. Owners of Dogs Urged to Keep Animals at Home to Prevent Hydrophobia. 
### 
In view of the fact that there have
been a number of cases of smallpox
at Berkeley, it has seemed to the com
mittee 011 Public Health a part of its
duty to advise those who have had no
successful vaccination for seven years
to have themselves revaccinated even
though unsuccessful tries have been
made since then. It is the purpose of
this notice, therefore, merely to ad
vise since there have been 110 indica
tions at present of a possible spreading
of the disease, and since there is abso
lutely no present cause for alarm as
regards Stanford. Nevertheless there
is of necessity a certain amount of in
tercommunication between Stanford
and the town of Berkeley and it has
seemed proper to advise such revacci
nation as an extraordinary precaution
to safeguard the University commun
ity. The situation is such at present
that no compulsory methods further
than a rigid enforcement of the ex
isting regulations seem warranted.

The committee further wishes to in
form owners of dogs 011 the campus
that, within the last week a diagnosis
of hydrophobia lias been made on two
dogs, one from Mayfield and one from

Palo Alto. The committee is not, at
present, in a position to take adequate
measures to keep stray dogs off the
campus, and it wishes to urge upon
owners of do 4s the necessity of keep
ing their (loss at home, or at any rate
of not allowing them to roam about
the campus unattended. Such a pre
caution, though inconvenient, will go
far to avoid possible loss of a valuable
dog and the far more serious possibil
ity of subjecting someone to the neces
sity of the very disagreeable Pasteur
treatment.
