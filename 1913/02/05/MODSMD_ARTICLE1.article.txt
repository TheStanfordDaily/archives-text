### 
While the course of rehearsals for
the production of the Sword and San
dals play has been progressing, the
property men and scenic artists have
been busy fitting up effective stage
dressings.
Costumes from Goldstein, that lend
their full share to an accurate por
trayal of men and women of all types
of 1 Nth century Fiance and England
have been received and distributed
among the members of the cast. Ex
pert stage carpenters have worked for
a week on the Assembly Hall stage to
perfect a mechanical background for
the six sets of scenes that are being
finished by the Alcazar scenic studio
of San Francisco. Trial cast of the
scenes will be used in rehearsal tomor
row evening. Lighting effects have
I een minutely arranged to aid the
coloring of the play.
Rehearsal of the prologue, and of
the first and fourth acts yesterday
was carried through with the finished
interpretation of lines that the coach
has worked for insistently.
Heavy seat sales were recorded at
the Bookstore and at Weingartner's
drugstore in Palo Alto yesterday. The
crowds of ticket buyers included resi
dents of many towns and cities of the
Ray district who wrote their orders,
and school children of San Mateo, Palo
Alto, and San .lose, who have studied
the classical novel from which "The
Only Way" is written. Student Thes
pians made a popular choice when they
selected the thrilling revolutionary
drama as the most daring vehicle to a
stage triumph in the history of Stan
ford dramatics.
