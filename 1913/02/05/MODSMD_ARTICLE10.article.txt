Dartmouth stands too high in our
estimation for us to think that she

would knowingly con
sent to such robbery as
that which appears on

the first page of this issue. Hut in
justice to Stanford and Dartmouth we
think it is no more than right that such
thievery and thieves be exposed.
While we appreciate the compliment
that has been paid to our literary abil
ity by the Dartmouth copyist who pub
lished their poster, the fact that they
were able to reap a rich harvest from
the sale of our product is a hard pill
to swallow. Not being copyrighted, we
have no claim to the proceeds. Worse
than this is the embarassing
position in which Dartmouth has
been placed by this man who lias been
posing before the college as a literary
genius.
Having called Dartmouth's attention
to the presence of the impostor in
their flock we hope to see summary
measures taken by that institution to
show up the guilty individual in his
true light.
