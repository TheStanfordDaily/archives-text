# 185 MEN SIGNED UP FOR TRACK THIS SEMESTER.
## Captain Campbell Urges All to Compete in Meet on Saturday Morning. 
### 
One hundred and eighty-five men
have signed up for track this semester.
When the students made intentions of
trying out it was with the understand
ing that they should train regularly,
unless excused. There are thirty-live
more signed up than last year, but
many of these come out only when
they feel like it and maybe not at all.
Captain E. P. Campbell, '13, has issued
the order that all must appear on the
track from, now on unless excused for
personal reasons by himself or "Dad."
Only about one hundred have been
entering the informal meets on Satur
day mornings, and twenty men have
been excused from competing. This
means that practically sixty are indif
ferent and not working out regularly.
The track along the straightaway is
being hardened this week by putting
clay oniift 112 as a binder for the cinders.
It will be in good condition for the
third preliminary meet which is sched
uled for Saturday morning at ten
o'clock. All distances will be length
ened. Orders from headquarters are
that all men who signed up must enter
unless excused.
