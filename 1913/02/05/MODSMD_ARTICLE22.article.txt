Bay a few miles north of San Francis
co many years before the founding of

tify my title, 'A Bit of Elizabethan Cal
ifornia' by tracing this early landing
of one of Elizabeth's courtiers."

Dr. Gardner briefly told of his great
religious and educational achievements
in Alaskan missions. Bishop Rowe
said in part, "Alaska is one of the
United States' greatest assets, it is a
vast in area and has inexhaustible re
sources. The discovery by Stephansson
of the blonde esquimaux has recently
brought Alaska into the limelight. The
discoverer declared that it would be
useless to try to extend Christian civ
ilization to them, but already a number
of native converts have set out to
work among the blonde brethren."
Speaking of the Indian population,
lie said, "Thirty per cent of the Indians
are tubercular. We have applied to
Washington for aid in bettering their
conditions. We have taught them to
improve their squalid igloos in which
they live, and do away with many of
their unsanitary habits. Hospitals and
modern clubhouses at different places
serve the medical and social needs of
the men in those solitary regions."
