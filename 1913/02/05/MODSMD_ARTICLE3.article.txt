# DARTMOUTH STEALS STANFORD POSTER
## 
### 
"Imitation is the sincerest flattery."
Stanford admits the truth of this time
honored adage of the breakfast-food
and lleece-lined underwear manufac
turer. Hut we are essentially a modest
student body, and the spirit of sincere
flattery which prompted the Poster
Committee of Dartmouth College to is
-ue as an original production the pla
card depicted in Cut No. 2 has failed
of due appreciation from Andy Hili,
ex-'CI, and li!s classmates.
Hill, it is (-aid, is the artist whose
: rm h first portrayed the naval scene
of sacred memory appearing in cut No. j
1 and ( ut No. _. His class mates wrote |
he terse, fervent English which bor-I
lers it. in No. 1.
On t'.ie Friday following registration
in the autumn of the year IMO this
poster was King rushed to the campus
1 y heavfrly armed band of Sopho
mores in an automobile. In the cold
dawn grim band of Freshmen sur
rounded the ijiachine and reduced to a
heap of smoldering ashes the treasure;',
posters. After a return to the printers
which broke records, speed-laws, and
almost, necks, a new batch of placards
was procured, each bearing the his- ,
toric taunt, "He Who Laughs l-.ast, I
Krosh!"
Now let ih shift the scene. An am
bitious young gentleman living in Se

attle, Washington, entered Dartmouth
college. I lis prowess as a gridiron
liero secured liim election to the presi
dency of the class of 11*14, and he also
served as chairman of the poster com
mittee of his class. He and the mem
l.ers of his committee brought their
intellects to bear upon the production
of a poster which should humble those
of the incoming class. After a severe
brainstorm they brought, forward the
placard of cut No. 2. Each member of
:he Freshman class was obliged to
mrchase one of these posters at a dol-
I l'i> a throw. And Andy Hill never got
1 i", cent!
There is a striking family resem
| blence between poster Xo. 1 and poster
\'o in fact, the only important
point ( 112 difference is that the word
"Dartmouth" is substituted throughout
'.n t! - e latter for the word "Stanford"
in the former. A reference to the
"tubs of Encina" was not even elimi
nated; no doubt this was regarded at
Dartmouth as a learned allusion to
elastic il mythology. And the phrase
"hie Who Laughs Last, Frosh!" strip
ped of its background, must have been
funny as a crutch at good old Dart
mouth.
The effete and plagiaristic East has
paid a sincere tribute to the original,
if uncouth, West.
