The distance for the varsity oarsmen
will be three miles, the start being at
the Webster street bridge and the fin
ish line at the end of the Western Pa
cific mole. The Freshmen are to start
a mile below the bridge, the finish be
ing at the same point.
The shells will start from anchor,
and a provision has been inserted call
ing for a new start, should there be a
mishap within ten strokes. The course
is to he bouyed for the entire distance,
to insure aginst cutting-in at the bend
of the estuary.
Two judges are to be stationed at
(he finish line, one on the Western Pa
cific mole and the other on the Alameda
pier. This change was the result of
last year's experience, when the
iudge's launch was left far behind in
the race. An umpire is to follow the
shells i.ll a power boat, and will be in
general charge of the eights while the
contestants are on the water.
