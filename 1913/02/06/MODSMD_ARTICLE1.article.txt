# INTERSCHOLASTIC STARS WILL MEET IN TOURNEY
## TENNIS PLAYERS WILL COMPETE APRIL 11-12. Medals For Track Men to be of Higher Standard at Slight Additional Cost. 
### 
The Stanford Interscholastic tennis
tourney is to be held at the University
on April 11 and 12. Invitations were
sent out yesterday by the board of
governors, inviting the preparatory
schools of the Coast, including about
2rÂ»o in number, to compete here on the
above date. As in the past, the tour
nament is to lie under the direct super
vision of the Stanford varsity tennis
players, and all who enter have been
requested to communicate with R. L.
Murray, '13.
Last year John Strachan of Lowell
High School was the victor in the
singles tourney. The doubles cham
pionship was won by Strachan and
Leviuson of Lowell. It is expected
that both of these racket wielders will
enter in the matches this April.
The tournament is to be held in con
junction with the annual Interschol
astic track meet. The preliminary
contests however are scheduled for the
afternoon previous to the meeting of
the trackmen. This will mean that
the matches will extend over two days
and the (inals will be played off on the
morning of April 12.
Special rates are to be given by the
railroads to those who visit Stanford
either as contestants or spectators at
this time. The arrangement will make
it possible for many to be the guests of
the University who would otherwise be
unable to come.
Medals Improved.
The medals which will be given to
the contesting athletes in the Inter
scholastic track meet this spring are
to lie of a higher grade and quality
than ever before. As yet the contract
has not been given for the supplying of
the medals, but it will specify exactly
tlie kind of material to be used in the
making of them. These higher class
medals will add but little expense to
the cost of holding the meet and will
add materially to its already high stan
dard.
Two schools have at this early date
signified their intention of entering
teams and have sent for applications.
These come from Harold Phillips, ath
letic manager at Healdsburg and E. E.
Ames, athletic manager at Stockton.
Boise, Idaho has written for informa
tion regarding the meet and an invi
tation has been forwarded to the
school. I!ill Military Academy of Port
land, Oregon, finds it impossible to
send a team south this year.
