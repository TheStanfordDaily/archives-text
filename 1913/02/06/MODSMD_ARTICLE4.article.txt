# OMENS OF COMING TERROR WOVEN INTO INTENSE PLOT
## CAST REHEARSES FOR LAST TIME TONIGHT IN COSTUME. Supernal Prophecies of Mob-Ridden Paris Furnish Delicate Dramatic Shading and Persuasive Value. 
### 
Much of the dramatic power that
gives "The Only Way" and its charac
ters a vivid, breathing reality throws
itself over the footlights in a sugges
tive form that is intangible, but none
the less insistent. The web of circum
stances, hatred, and inevitable fate
that is to wind itself about the players
in the dranm later, in the class strife
of Paris begins to weave itself in the
quiet seclusion of a garden and a
home in staid old Soho Square in LOll
- The premonitions of long hours
a".id trials of terror mix with the glad
ness of lover's smiles, and force them
selves into the tenderness of a parent*
regard.
In the sleeping and waking dreams
of Mimi, the little French maid, of

Lucy Manette and her aged father, of
Darnay and Sidney Carton, the awful
muttering, and death weighted tread
of the Jacobin patriots in their fiend
ish excesses weave a warning from
far off. The sound of voices, and
sight of black figures can never be
surely excluded from the minds of the
actors in the great romance of love,
life, and death.
The warnings do not obtrude them
selves. They are always just around
the corner of present reality, and show
themselves only when the joy or sad
ness of the actors is most intense.
Stage effects for the production of
Stanford's most daring dramatic ven
ture have been installed. Quick
changes of scenes, made in darkness
without a drop of the curtain preserve
the continuity of spell with yhich the
story is destined to glamour its aud
ience.
