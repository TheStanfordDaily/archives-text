Committee to act for Stanford in the

California has contended that the
rules governing the annual intercol
legiate football game hold for one year
and that the entire set of rules be
enacted each year. Stanford holds
that the rules must remain in force
until changed. Owing to this differ
ence, no decisions or actions could be
taken by the Intercollegiate Athletic
Committee.
To settle this question, the Agree
ment Committee requested that each
university appoint three men to serve
as an arbitration committee to decide
the issue. The California members will
be named shortly. The committee will
meet February 13, at the Palace Hotel.
