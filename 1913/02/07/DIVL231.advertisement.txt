The L System Clothes
lor Young Men
POWER to discriminate is the goal of true education
in the world of business as well as in the world of
letters, for without it no true progress is possible.
Power to discriminate has characterized the manufacture
of L System clothes. Added to the knowledge of L System
buyers, it has secured the most distinctive fabrics and
patterns. Combined with the skill of L. System designers
it has produced clever styles and striking models. And
your own power of discrimination must and will choose
the L System finished garment.
