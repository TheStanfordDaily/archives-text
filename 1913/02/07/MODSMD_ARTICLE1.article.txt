# MEET SCHEDULED WITH U.S.C. FOR MARCH 15
## STANFORD TRACK TEAM WILL JOURNEY SOUTH. Number of Events in Which Men Can Enter Will Be Limited to Avoid Injuries. 
### 
Through a decision reached last
evening the Stanford track team is to
journey to Los Angeles and meet the
representatives of the University of
Southern California on March 15. Af
ter careful consideration it was found
possible to select a team to make the
trip south and not have each man
compete in too many events. This
will avoid any possible strain on the
athletes. The annual meeting with
U.S.C. has always been one of great
collegiate importance in the south. For
a time it seemed possible that there
would be no journey to Los Angeles
this season. Heretofore the meets on
Bovard field have been held earlier in
the season and it has worked a detri
ment to the Cardinal in the intercol
legiate competition with California be
cause of the necessity of getting the
men into condition so early.
With the meet scheduled for two
weeks later than in any previous year
it will not fce necessary for "Dad" to
work his squad into the proper con
dition so soon. The plan of limiting
the number of events which the Stan
ford trackmen will be required to par
ticipate in will do away with the pos
sibility of injury to the athlete. This
has always been one of the things
which has troubled the cardinal coach
and captains in the past and has in
some cases resulted disastrously.
The southerners have a strong team
this year and number many stars
among their aggregation. Kelly,
Olympic, games winner, Courtney, for
merly of the University of Washington,
Hen Ward, Stonewall Jackson, Hen
drick, Swiggett, Throop, Bergstrom,
Durkee, Livernash, Cookman, Hodge,
Tipton, Torrence, Earl, Bettinger, and
Carrigan are among those who are in
cluded in the U.S.C. squad.
The trip,to Los Angeles will be the
only one which the track team will
take off the campus during the present
semester except for the big meet at
Berkeley. The number of men who
will be taken on the team is to be de
cided upon later.
