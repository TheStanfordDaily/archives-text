# ENGLISH SCHOLAR GIVES TRIO OF LITERARY TALKS.
## Professor Gottfried Unit Declares That Sincerity is the Keynote of Lasting Quality. 
### 
Professor Gottfried Hult of the Uni
versity of North Dakota this morning
concluded his series of interesting
addresses on literary topics.
"The Poetry of William Vaughan
Moody" was the subject of the first lec
ture yesterday. The speaker read se
lections from Moody's poems and
dramas and explained his interpreta
tion of the Democracy of the present
day. In an address last night entitled,
"Whitman Once More," Professor Hult
showed how Whitman had caught the
'spirit of the age.' This morning un
der the topic of "Literary Longevity"
the speaker made the point that lit
erature which has come down through
the ages of the past is the literature
which will endure for the future.
"Sincerity," he said, "is the keynote
of strength."
