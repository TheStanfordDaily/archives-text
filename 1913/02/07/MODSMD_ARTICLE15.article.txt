Speaking of theatricals reminds us
of the lop-sided arrangement of plays

this year. Last semes

staged while alread>

there are five on the calendar in ad
dition to a proposed concert by the
(Jlee Club. These include the Sword
and Sandals production for this even
ing. the Sophomore play, the Junior
Opera, The Senior Farce, and the
Freshmen Vaudeville.
The one performance to a semester
rule is a good rule and will not work
a hardship on the standard of the pro
ductions if the various dramatic 01
ganizations will use a little discretion
in selecting dates. Right now it looks
as if the theatrical talent will be ex
hausted by the time the try-outs are
announced for the Senior play. A
judicious arrangement of dates would
raise the standard of the plays and
preclude the possibility of a dearth of
material. A joint committee, coin pos
ed of members from the several dram
atic societies would be able to secure
a more equal distribution of perform
ances and prevent any future difficul
ties in securing talent.
