# CONFERENCE TO ENFORCE RULING ON DRAMATICS
## Actors Can Appear But Once Each Semesterâ€”Use of Lagunita Restricted. 
### 
Discussion of the canoeing and
swimming situation on Lagunita and
of the "one performance a semester
rule" in regard to dramatics occupied
most of the time of the University
Conference at its regular meeting last
evening.
The necessity of absolutely safe
guarding life if further enjoyment of
Lagunita is to be permitted by the
Trustees, was brought out in the meet
ing. It was stated that small boys
of the neighborhood who infest the
lake are indulging in fool-hardy ex
ploits, and also that canoeists have
adopted various ingenious devices to
avoid takeing the swimming test. A
committee was appointed to frame
rules covering the use of Lagunita.
Although the hardship of forbidding
those who have very small lion- speak
ing parts in a dramatic performance
from participating in another the same
semester was apparent to the Confer
ence members, the difficulty of draw
ing a line to limit the operation of the
one-performance rule was equally ap
parent. The old rule in its entirety
was tacitly endorsed as a result of the
discussion.
Formal announcement of the elec
tion of G. B. Lantz, '13, A. C. Sand
strom, '14, and P. B. McKee, '14. to the
Conference, was made by the commit
tee in charge of the recent, elections.
Informal discussion of various stu
dent problems was indulged in by the
Conference members.
