A considerable amount of rebate is
due to persons who have paid taxes 011
personal property. This includes tht
fraternity and other houses 011 the
Campus counted as personal property.
This is due to the tax collector hav
ing assigned a tax according to the
previous year's rate, while the rate
is often reduced by the Hoard of
Equalizers.
The Salinas Collection Agency, The
Angelas, San Jose, is looking up these
matters, charging fifty per cent of the
amounts collected for its services.
There are perhaps other ways of mak
ing collections but every taxpayer
about the University has some sum
coming back to him.
