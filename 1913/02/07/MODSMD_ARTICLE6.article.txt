# RESTORATION OF MUSEUM TO TAKE PLACE SHORTLY
## Rare Art Collection Donated by Thomas Welton Stanford Will Have Separate Gallery. 
### 
The Board of Trustees of the Uni
versity have decided to restore a por
tion of the Museum. The part to be
rebuilt is to accommodate the collec
tion of paintings given to the univer
sity by Thomas Welton Stanford.
The south wing has been designated
as the section which will lie made into
a picture gallery. The plans for con
struction are in the hands of the
Structural Engineering department,
and although the building will follow
the lines of the previous structure,
the construction will be stronger than
before. It was in this wing that the
art collection was to be housed prior
to the earthquake but before the pic
tures could be hung the building was
destroyed. Since then the collection
has been stored avvav. The value of
the collection is estimated at several
hundred thousand dollars and was
gathered by the foremost European
art critics in the interests of Thomas
Welton Stanford. In the collection
there are pictures by Hobbema, Mel
choir, Hondcootre, Salvator Rosa and
Alfred East.
Mr. Stanford is now living in East
Melbourne, Australia, surrounded by
pictures gathered from the best of the
world's stock. From him the Curtis
collection came and Stanford is in
debted to him for many other things
including the library and a fund for
psychic research.
