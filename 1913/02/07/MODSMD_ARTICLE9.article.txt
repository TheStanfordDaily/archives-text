The Olympic Club of San Francisco
will send their ball team against the
Stanford Varsity tomorrow afternoon.
The game will be called at 3:15,
weather permitting.
The cllib have a stronger team than
the one with which they opened the
season. Their practices have been
held regularly, and during the last
two weeks they have won from some
of the best semi-professional teams
around the bay.
Stanford's line-up will lie changed
frequently during the game by Coach
Peters. Captain Terry will play short,
with McCloskey on third and Work
man on first. Jack and McNeely will
divide the afternoon at second. In
the outfield, Argabrite and Day, Cass
and Dooling, and Beeger and Noonan
will change places. Anderson and
Wickersham will alternate in the box
with Dent catching. Other changes
are probable. The regular admissions
hold for the game.
