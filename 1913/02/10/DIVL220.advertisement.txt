There is one great advantage
about the kind of advertising we
<l(i. When a man brings one of
our advertisements to the store
>ve can read to him and look him
in tlx- eye without blushing, hut
when a man tnkes an advertise
ment tlial promises him a suit of
clothes worth three times the
price to the store, the boss
dodges because his promise is
absurd when fuee to face with
I is fellowa:en.
