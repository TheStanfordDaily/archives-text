# "THE ONLY WAY" STAGED AS AN ARTISTIC DRAMA
## STUDENT ACTORS SCORE SUCCESS IN ROMANTIC PLAY. Mrs. T.P. Russell Reviews Sympathy Which Stumped Interpretation of Lines with Real Power. 
### 
In choosing "The Only Way," Sword
and Sandals certainly avoided the
crime of low aim, and in presenting it,
the cast maintained throughout an ad
equate standard of dignified, sympa
thetic and intelligent interpretation.
From the first, smiting, incoherent,
knell-like wail, which preceded the
line of the curtain and struck the key
note of terror and suffering, to the fin
al glimpse of the great renunciation
in the. shadow of the guillotine, scene
followed scene with an increasing
power. In the case of Mr. Mclnerney
there was, to lie sure, some forgetful
ness of another sort, but on the whole
the lines themselves were mastered, as
well as the content of them.
The unusually wide range of charac
ters was met by corresponding adapt
ability of the actors. In Mr. Horde
and Mr. Gross as the St. Evremonde
brothers we saw well represented the
aristocrat, insolent at the pinnacle of
his power; in Mr. Bellinger and Mr.
Morgan as Marquis and Compte, and
the others of the condemned, we saw
hint again, equally insolent under de
feat and counter-cruelty. Mr. Morgan
in particular brought before us the
patrician, bringing drawing-room
poise to prison cell, debonnaire in the
iace of death; and in his pliant grace
lie gives good Thespian promise. As
he voiced the crushed but uncrumpled
nobility, so Miss Murray typified the
triumphant proletariat. With her res
olute bearing, raucous pronounce
ments, canny relish of a jest, exultant
dominance, she was the spirit incar
nate of the plastic, passionate mob.
The entire mob work was literally hor
ribly well done and the whole third
act a vivid, realastic spectacle.
Last Acts Rest.
It was in the last two acts, indeed,
that most of the distinctive work was
done. As the tragedy towered more
and more imminent these young play
ers rose to meet it with astonishing
sureness and grasp; there was no fal
tering in them. And whatever of awk
wardness. or insufficient assimiliation
of role there may have been in the first
half was atoned for by the convincing
sweep and sincerity of the second. If
Mr. Mclnerney, for instance, left some
thing to lie desired by way of assured
bearing and winning manner as
Charles Darnay in London, as Marquis
St. Evremonde in Paris, prisoner and
victim, he made the silent pathos of
the part very expressive and real. Mr.
Ingraham, on the other hand set a high
standard for himself in the first part
in the prologue, and lived up to it in
the second, though they were both
extremely difficult in that they de
manded absolute abandonment and
surrender to an unusually alien part.
The nervous, expressive, French use
of the hands, both in persuading and
threatening, the wonderful smile of
triumph when he, as Earnest Defargb,
had out-Antonied Antony and secured
a reversal of sentence for Darnay, are
things destined to be remembered. It
was this same quality of self-efface
ment that made Mimi also so unforget
table a figure. Miss Emmons mani
fested to a marked degree the artist's
ability to comprehend a part and sub
ordinate herself to it, and her Mimi
was throughout a creature of haunt
ing, wistful appeal.
Miss Borough was a witching little
Lucy Manette, always an adorable pic
ture in her quaint, charming costumes
that suited her so well (by the way
the costuming of the whole play was
of course a source of much pictur
esque effect) and as welcome in the
somber play as a gleam of sunshine
before quenched by the gloom, ft is
too bad that on account of inadequate
development of voice she was more
satisfying to look at than listen to and
that her part was consequently some
what discounted.
Owens Shows Versatility.
Sydney Carton was Mr. Owens' best
yet, and that too in a role of the great
est demands. In this complex charac
ter, with its Hamlet-like crust of re
serve, now jocular, now cynical, with
the burdened, struggling, generous
soul breaking through in soliloquy or
under the stress of supreme moments,
Mr. Owens portrayed a type hitherto
a stranger to the Stanford stage, and

with a so far unequalled degree of
sincerity. The versatile ability re
quired for such a character was also
continually in evidence, and one could
hardly choose a high water mark; but
for charm, dash, wit, there was his
inimitable plea and argument by which
he snatches his friend from the guillo
tine; and for simple nobility and "high
seriousness," there was his answer lo
the final call, wherein his progress
with Mimi across the cell became the
march of a conqueror.
In a play of so many contributing
elements, many more deserve honor
aide mention: the breezy entrance and
infectious laugh of Mr. Stryver (Mr.
Manning): the manly apology of Mr.
Lorry in the last act (Mr. Soper); the
sudden transformation of de Maury
(Mr. Ide) from the pitiful youth
afraid to die, to the "gentleman" calm
lv going forth to his doom; the clear
enunciation and quiet good taste of
Mr. Wells' Dr. Manette; and the en
semble of all the minor characters.
The coaching spoke for itself, as did
the stage managementâ€”and the or
chestra! All the participants are on
all account entitled to that best source
of satisfaction, a high attempt worth
ily achieved; and if the emotion and
romance of the play is of last cen
tury's style and so out of date in this
era of subtlety, subjectivity and Sophis
tication it at least may lay claim to
some breadth of appeal and primal
truth of motive. If our amateur actors
wish occasionally to venture into the
realm of the tragic, and yet not be in
danger of becoming Comic Tragedians,
this type is decidedly the wisest choice.
We should lie glad to see in the future
another as good.
