# "THE ONLY WAY" STAGED AS AN ARTISTIC DRAMA
## STUDENT ACTORS SCORE SUCCESS IN ROMANTIC PLAY. Mrs. T.P. Russell Reviews Sympathy Which Stumped Interpretation of Lines with Real Power. 
### 
In choosing "The Only Way," Sword
and Sandals certainly avoided the
crime of low aim, and in presenting it,
the cast maintained throughout an ad
equate standard of dignified, sympa
thetic and intelligent interpretation.
From the first, smiting, incoherent,
knell-like wail, which preceded the
line of the curtain and struck the key
note of terror and suffering, to the fin
al glimpse of the great renunciation
in the. shadow of the guillotine, scene
followed scene with an increasing
power. In the case of Mr. Mclnerney
there was, to lie sure, some forgetful
ness of another sort, but on the whole
the lines themselves were mastered, as
well as the content of them.
The unusually wide range of charac
ters was met by corresponding adapt
ability of the actors. In Mr. Horde
and Mr. Gross as the St. Evremonde
brothers we saw well represented the
aristocrat, insolent at the pinnacle of
his power; in Mr. Bellinger and Mr.
Morgan as Marquis and Compte, and
the others of the condemned, we saw
hint again, equally insolent under de
feat and counter-cruelty. Mr. Morgan
in particular brought before us the
patrician, bringing drawing-room
poise to prison cell, debonnaire in the
iace of death; and in his pliant grace
lie gives good Thespian promise. As
he voiced the crushed but uncrumpled
nobility, so Miss Murray typified the
triumphant proletariat. With her res
olute bearing, raucous pronounce
ments, canny relish of a jest, exultant
dominance, she was the spirit incar
nate of the plastic, passionate mob.
The entire mob work was literally hor
ribly well done and the whole third
act a vivid, realastic spectacle.
Last Acts Rest.
It was in the last two acts, indeed,
that most of the distinctive work was
done. As the tragedy towered more
and more imminent these young play
ers rose to meet it with astonishing
sureness and grasp; there was no fal
tering in them. And whatever of awk
wardness. or insufficient assimiliation
of role there may have been in the first
half was atoned for by the convincing
sweep and sincerity of the second. If
Mr. Mclnerney, for instance, left some
thing to lie desired by way of assured
bearing and winning manner as
Charles Darnay in London, as Marquis
St. Evremonde in Paris, prisoner and
victim, he made the silent pathos of
the part very expressive and real. Mr.
Ingraham, on the other hand set a high
standard for himself in the first part
in the prologue, and lived up to it in
the second, though they were both
extremely difficult in that they de
manded absolute abandonment and
surrender to an unusually alien part.
The nervous, expressive, French use
of the hands, both in persuading and
threatening, the wonderful smile of
triumph when he, as Earnest Defargb,
had out-Antonied Antony and secured
