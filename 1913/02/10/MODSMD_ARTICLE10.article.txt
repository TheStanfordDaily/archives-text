# BURNS TEAM FORFEITS TO STANFORD ELEVEN.
## 
### 
Stanford soccer team jumped into
second place in the California Football
League, when the Burns eleven de
faulted the game scheduled to have
been played on Saturday. The local
team has one victory over the Scotch
men to its credit, having defeated them
earlier in the season. Until last Sat
urday the Burns eleven was in second
place and Stanford in third: but the
defaulted game reversed the positions
of the two teams.
