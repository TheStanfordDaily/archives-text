### 
The Board of Directors of the Students' Guild submit the following re
port on the available supplies of milk for the Campus.

Palo Alto, Cal., February 1, 1913.
To the Honorable The Board of Directors of the Students' Guild,
Stanford University, California.
1 submit herewith a report upon the milk supply of the Stanford Uini- 4
versity campus together with a brief review of the Palo Alto milk ordinance.
All of the dairies that supply the campus also supply Palo Alto and
therefore come under the jurisdiction of the town milk ordinance. This
ordinance allows three grades of milk (or cream) to be sold, namely:
Market milk, Inspected milk and Pasteurized milk.
Market Milk is comprised of all milk that does not fall into either of
the other two grades. The minimum requirements for this grade are es
sentially those of the state law, and are as follows:
1. Dairy score 90% or over.
2. Milk to test 3.25% or over.
3. Cream to test 18% fat or over.
4. No adulteration of milk or cream.
5. Healthy cows as shown by physical examination.
6. No contagious disease among employees.
These requirements must be complied with in the production of both
of the following grades of milk and in addition there are certain other
minimum requirements as follows:
Inspected Milk or Cream. This is milk or cream that is kept as safe
;:s possible from infection by methods of extreme care and cleanliness, but
is not allowed to be heated. The rules for ibis grade are:
1. Dairyq score 90% or over.
2. All cows tuberculin tested and passed.
3. Employees to keep themselves in a cleanly condition and to wash
their hands in soap and water before handling the milk.
4. No other grade of milk allowed on the dairy premises or bottling
room.
5. Milk rooms entirely separate from living rooms.
G. Delivered within 24 hours of milking.
7. Containers sterilized in steam at 212 degrees for 15 minutes.
8. Containers sealed, and labeled with the words "Inspected Milk or
Cream, Class 'A' Dairy. Palo Alto Hoard of Public Safety." (No other
milk is allowed to be thus labeled.)
9. Milk or cream cooled to and kept at 50 degrees or lower until de
livered.
10. To contain not over 10,000 bacteria per cc. until delivered.
Pasteurized Milk or Cream. The rules for this grade are:
1. Dairy score GOor over.
2. Pasteurizing plant and bottling room score or over.
3. Milk rooms entirely separate from living rooms.
4. Pasteurization by heating milk to 140 or 145 degrees for not less
than 20 minutes. A recording thermometer is required, the records of which
become the property of the board of safety.
5. Cooled immediately after pasteurization to and kept at 50 degrees
or lower.
G. To be delivered within 24 hours of pasteurization.
7. Containers sterilized in steam at 212 degrees for 15 minutes.
8. Containers sealed, and labeled with the words "Pasteurized Milk
or Cream. Palo Alto Board of Public Safety." (No other milk is allowed
to be thus labeled.)
General Improvement in Milk Supply.
Since my last report to the Students' Guild in August 1912 none of the
scores have been decreased and several have been raised. The greatest raise
was given to the Palo Alto Creamery when it moved from the rather un
favorable location on Middlefield road to its present location at 262 Univer
sity avenue. The score was increafed from G4 to 84 per cent on account
of better equipment and methods.
Another improvement has been in the voluntary testing of all cows on
the Wildwood dairy, for tuberculosis, and the elimination of the reactors.
One dairy is now selling "Inspected" milk on the campus and no dairy
has yet started lo sell pasteurized milk.
