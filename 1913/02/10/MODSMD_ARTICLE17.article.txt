The Editor of The Daily Palo Alto:
if 1 may assume the role of critic
1 should like to call the attention of
the Stanford public to a very regret
able matter in the performance of
"The Only Way"—not connected with
the actors, but the audience. This is the
noticeable tendency of the Assembl>
Hall audience to titter in scenes where
there is not the slightest occasion
for demonstrating that one has a sense
of humor. Dramatic performances
may be occasionally so ridiculously
bad that the actors deserve to be
laughed at, but in a good production,
even if a slight break occurs, it is
fairer not to disconcert the performers
and annoy that part of the audience
which is glad to see the best of the
performance, by ill-timed tittering.
To turn to another side of the mat
ter. it is a little difficult to see why
the Stanford audience is always so
much amused at sentimental scenes
in a play. The average mixed aud
ience in a theatre will witness even
romantically sentimental scenes in a
serious play with only the legitimate
interest which they were intended to
excite. Perhaps the attitude here is
due to an exaggeration of a healthful
enough tendency which prevails in not
taking sentiment too seriously. It is
to be feared, however, that it is caused
by the fact that the actors are all
more or less well known to the mem
bers of the audience. Are we then
being fair to them when we do not
give them the same chance that we
would to professionals? It is more
over especially unfair to laugh at the
actors when any unintentional or in
tentional disturbance occurs in the
house.
To how great an extent this un
called-for tittering is due to the pres
ence of "highbrows" from Palo Alto,
it is not easy to judge; but the largest
part of the audience is made up of
Stanford men and women and their
friends, and it is theirs to say that
they will give plays presented by
Stanford talent a fair hearing.
Graduate.
