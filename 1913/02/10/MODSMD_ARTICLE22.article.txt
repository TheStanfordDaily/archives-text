# GOLD MEDALS WILL BE AWARDED WINNERS OF HIGH SCHOOL RELAY
## 
### 
Gold medals will be given to the
members of the relay team which wins
the race in the annual Interscholastic
track meet on April 12. This decision
was reached by the Board of Govern
ors on Saturday. Heretofore five
bronze medals have been awarded to
the team which crossed the line first
in the mile relay. It is very probable
with this extra incentive that many
more schools will send their rela.v
runners here this year to compete in
the big event of the track meet.
Besides the medals which are given
to the individual members of the win
ning team the school whose colors
are upheld, is given the Bittner cup.
This trophy is now in the possession
of Citrus Union, and was captured in
1911 by Los Angeles High School. The
cup will lie given permanently to the
school first winning the relay race
three times, not necessarily in suc
cessive years.
Entry blanks will lie sent to all the
schools on the Coast in about three
weeks. Already several preparatory
institutions have asked for them, but
they will not he distributed until a. let
ter is written to all the captains of the
track teams, telling what trophies will
be given and who the present holders
are.
.Mission High School of San Fran
cisco is the most recent school to en
ter a team. .Monterey and Fullertyn
find it impossible to send a team here
this spring, but will next year.
