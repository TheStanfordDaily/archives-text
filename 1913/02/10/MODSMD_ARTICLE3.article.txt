# OLYMPIC CLUB FAILS TO APPEAR FOR HALL GAME.
## Two Games Between First and Second Tennis Are Substituted For Practice. 
### 
Because of the non-appearance of
the Olympic Club baseball team on
Saturday the Varsity was forced to
engage the second division in an exhi
bition game. The failure of the city
men to appear caused the second dis
appointment of the week for the fans.
Receiving no word to the contrary
until the last minute the Varsity was
prepared to meet the Club team. In
ability to get their team together was
the only reason stated over the phone
to the local management. Besides
working a hardship on the spectators
This was bad on the Stanford team
who were thus denied a regular prac
tice game.
For practice purposes Coach Peters
put two teams thru thirteen innings of
ball. The first game was won by the
Varsity 4 to 3, while the second con
test went but four innings and resulted
in a win for the same team, 3 to 0.
Wickersham and Anderson pitched the
first game while Peters and Gragg op
posed each other in the second con
test.
