# STANFORD OARSMEN WILL ADOPT CORNELL STROKE
## COACH O'DEA OUTLINES POLICY FOR CREW TRAINING. Famous Wisconsin Athlete Shows Squad Advantages of New Stroke— Instructs Freshmen Tomorrow. 
### 
Saturday morning April 19 will find
the varsity crews of the three great
western universities, California, Wash
ington, and Stanford, competing in the
annual intercollegiate regatta, using
the Cornell stroke, a radical change
from the style of rowing that swept
Stanford into first place at the last
race on the Oakland estuary.
That the Cardinal crew will this
year completely change their form,
abandoning the old "Dan Murphy"
stroke which has carried their shell
far into the lead on many a regatta
day, and taking up the long established
"Cornell" stroke, was the startling an
nouncement. made by crew captain
Duryea at the first practice under
Coach P. J. O'Dea at Lagunita on Sat
urday afternoon.
Captain Duryea introduced the Stan
ford Coach to the squad by saying
that "here is a man who is making a
great sacrifice of time to come to the
campus and teach us how to row, and
row in a way that is new to every one
of us. It is up to every one to prove
their appreciation by good, honest
work. Mr. O'Dea is a man known as a
premier oarsman by every row ing in
thusiasist in the United States, in him
we iiave a coach that is without a peer,
it is left for us to do our best."
O'Dea Outlines Policy.
"I think the Golden Rule applies as
well in coaching ;is in anything else,
and I am going to work with you on
that basis. We are all apt to make
mistakes, and we are certain to makt»
mistakes while learning, so an error
is not a cause for shame. I want all
to try their best to follow the instruc
tions of the Coaching Committee, and
a mistake will only mean a quiet cor
rection. Repeated mistakes will not
mean embarrassing comments from the
coach or committee, for it is part of
our work to be patient and teach you.
"The work of the squad is to lie
lighter this year than it has been for
some time. On a number of instances
one or two of your best oarsmen have
broken down at the last minute from
overtraining—that is enough to con
vince us that the system was at fault.
As little of the 'grind' as is consistant
with developing a winning crew will
come this spring, and at the end of the
season you will be in good health.
"The experience of the Wisconsin
and Cornell crews with their stroke
over a long period of years has showed
that the greatest efficiency is reached
with that style. There is no hard fin
ish to the stroke, all of the power go
ing into the catch and the first half of
the oar's sweep. At Wisconsin regis
ters were placed on the outriggers,
and they proved conclusively that from
the catch to a point opposite the out
riggers the stroke is hardest, from
that point rapidly losing its power.
"An eight oared shell, with its hu
man machinery, is a perfect type of
machine, and that is a thing for you to
