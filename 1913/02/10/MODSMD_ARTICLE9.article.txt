The Daily Palo Alto heartily ap
proves of the words of the graduate

which appear in another col
umn of this issue. The con
duct of a large number of

students at "The Only Way" on Friday
evening was disgusting, to say the
least. Whenever there was the slight
est hitch or a sentimental scene it was
the cue for some to begin their child
ish snickering. This ten cent vaude
ville house conduct should not be tol
erated at Stanford theatricals and
drastic measures must be taken if
there are any more of such exhibitions
of small boy rudeness.
