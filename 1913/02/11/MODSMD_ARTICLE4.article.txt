# EXISTENCE OF PRIVILEGE HAS NO PLACE IN GOVERNMENT
## Doctor Jordan Points Out Fundamentals Necessary for State’s Existence in Address on Democracy and Peace. 
### 
"It is a blunder on the part of the
American people to give to any indi
vidual or corporation anything without
a corresponding return. This is a
fundamental of democracy."
Pointing this moral in his customary
simple and convincing manner, Presi
dent David Starr .Jordan delivered bis
first address of the year to tne stu
dents in assembly at 10:15 this morn
ing. "Democracy and Peace" was Dr.
Jordan's subject. The link connecting
the two he found in the absence
of the institution of Privilege in a
democratic government.
Privilege, Dr. Jordan lucidly dem
onstrated, is indispensible to war and
incompatible with democracy. Privi
lege stands behind the puppet govern
ments of Europe, directs the war, and
reaps the profits; but the people pay
the price. America, on the oilier hand,
can never be true to its ideal of equal
ity before the law if it permits the
existance of privileged interests;
therefore America as a democracy can
never stand for war. This was the
conclusion lying behind the Presi
dent's straightforward talk of this
morning.
Hy way of introduction. Dr. Jordan
said, "When I went to college in 1868
I was undecided whether to become u
botanist or a rearer of fine sheep. As
things have turned out, the raising of
fine lambs has been my life work."
Showing that his interest in the lower
animals and his realization that what
ever laws relate to them also relate
to man, caused liini to study the eu
genics of war, the President continued.
"I developed the formula, 'War id
unreasoning anger and we must take
it out of the councils of nations.' In
private life we take our troubles to the
courts instead of to the field,' and in
the same way arbitration is a remedy
for the unreasoning anger of war. In
ternationalism. a fundamental of edu
cation is really a remedy for the prob
lems of war. Most wars are the rich
man's war and the poor man's fight.
Internationalism is the true cure for
this elass of war."
War is Worldsickness.
Illustrating by means of the Balkan
War the idea that "War is world
sickness," Dr. Jordan said; "Every war
is due lo human blundering or crimi
nality. Sickness in man is also due to
somebody's blunder, and the remedy
is sanitation. In like manner the rem
edy for war is sanitation—removing
the causes of difficulty beforehand. If
our Monroe doctrine is offensive to
other nations and a probable cause for
war, we should remedy it before it is
too late. It is offensive to Europe and
more so to the South American nations
which we boast of protecting. It. has
recently been attempted to make this
doctrine more obnoxious by applying
it to private companies, because of
supposed Japanese designs on Magda-

Lena Hay. Japan has no designs on
Magdalena Hay. The President
blocked this attempt to alter the Mon
roe Doctrine refusing to sign the con
gressional resolution. President-elect
Wilson, of whom we used to say that
he should have been a southern sena
tor before the war, may be the man to
smooth out the Monroe Doctrine."
(living the audience a look behind the
scenes at the Bulgarian War to show
that it is really only a large exploiting
project. Dr. Jordan stated that a few
bankers own nearly one-third of En
gland. and that the governments of
Europe are nearly all in the hands of

those exploiting establishments. This
proposition he developed by striking
illustrations and Comparisons. He
showed further that the people who do
not reap the profits do bear the bur
dens of these wars.
Mentioning the book, "Paris in Amer
ica," in which a Frenchman looked
away from privilege-ridden France to
democratic America, Dr. Jordan went
on, "There has been an ideal of Ameri
cans, which was the ideal of Dem
ocracy; and the only hope of America
lies in keeping this ideal. Democracy
implies freedom and equality of the
people and the best of expert service.
America should mean a chance for
each man to make the best of his own
life, which rests on the principle of
equality before the law. It was for
this that the forefathers came.
"The question at issue, then, is that
of privilege, .lust so long as we allow
corporations or individuals something
for nothing we violate the principles of
democracy.
"In the United States we have start
ed to make the mistake of giving some
thing for nothing. We have allowed
ships which we call "ours," but which
are owned by London and New York
bankers to go through the canal free.
These will be owned by the railroads
through the operation of the interlock
ing directorate. It is a blunder on the
part of the American people to give to
any individual or corporation any
thing without a corresponding return.
This is a fundamental of democracy.
It is really the principle behind the so
called Progressive movement."

our Monroe doctrine is offensive to
other nations and a probable cause for
war, we should remedy it before it is
too late. It is offensive to Europe and
more so to the South American nations
which we boast of protecting. It. has
recently been attempted to make this
doctrine more obnoxious by applying
it to private companies, because of
supposed Japanese designs on Magda-

Lena Hay. Japan has no designs on
Magdalena Hay. The President
blocked this attempt to alter the Mon
roe Doctrine refusing to sign the con
gressional resolution. President-elect
Wilson, of whom we used to say that
he should have been a southern sena
tor before the war, may be the man to
smooth out the Monroe Doctrine."
(living the audience a look behind the
scenes at the Bulgarian War to show
that it is really only a large exploiting
project. Dr. Jordan stated that a few
bankers own nearly one-third of En
gland. and that the governments of
Europe are nearly all in the hands of

those exploiting establishments. This
proposition he developed by striking
illustrations and Comparisons. He
showed further that the people who do
not reap the profits do bear the bur
dens of these wars.
Mentioning the book, "Paris in Amer
ica," in which a Frenchman looked
away from privilege-ridden France to
democratic America, Dr. Jordan went
on, "There has been an ideal of Ameri
cans, which was the ideal of Dem
ocracy; and the only hope of America
lies in keeping this ideal. Democracy
implies freedom and equality of the
people and the best of expert service.
America should mean a chance for
each man to make the best of his own
life, which rests on the principle of
equality before the law. It was for
this that the forefathers came.
"The question at issue, then, is that
of privilege, .lust so long as we allow
corporations or individuals something
for nothing we violate the principles of
democracy.
"In the United States we have start
ed to make the mistake of giving some
thing for nothing. We have allowed
ships which we call "ours," but which
are owned by London and New York
bankers to go through the canal free.
These will be owned by the railroads
through the operation of the interlock
ing directorate. It is a blunder on the
part of the American people to give to
any individual or corporation any
thing without a corresponding return.
This is a fundamental of democracy.
It is really the principle behind the so
called Progressive movement."

"It is a blunder on the part of the
American people to give to any indi
vidual or corporation anything without
a corresponding return. This is a
fundamental of democracy."
Pointing this moral in his customary
simple and convincing manner, Presi
dent David Starr .Jordan delivered bis
first address of the year to tne stu
dents in assembly at 10:15 this morn
ing. "Democracy and Peace" was Dr.
Jordan's subject. The link connecting
the two he found in the absence
of the institution of Privilege in a
democratic government.
Privilege, Dr. Jordan lucidly dem
onstrated, is indispensible to war and
incompatible with democracy. Privi
lege stands behind the puppet govern
ments of Europe, directs the war, and
reaps the profits; but the people pay
the price. America, on the oilier hand,
can never be true to its ideal of equal
ity before the law if it permits the
existance of privileged interests;
therefore America as a democracy can
never stand for war. This was the
conclusion lying behind the Presi
dent's straightforward talk of this
morning.
Hy way of introduction. Dr. Jordan
said, "When I went to college in 1868
I was undecided whether to become u
botanist or a rearer of fine sheep. As
things have turned out, the raising of
fine lambs has been my life work."
Showing that his interest in the lower
animals and his realization that what
ever laws relate to them also relate
to man, caused liini to study the eu
genics of war, the President continued.
"I developed the formula, 'War id
unreasoning anger and we must take
it out of the councils of nations.' In
private life we take our troubles to the
courts instead of to the field,' and in
the same way arbitration is a remedy
for the unreasoning anger of war. In
ternationalism. a fundamental of edu
cation is really a remedy for the prob
lems of war. Most wars are the rich
man's war and the poor man's fight.
Internationalism is the true cure for
this elass of war."
War is Worldsickness.
Illustrating by means of the Balkan
War the idea that "War is world
sickness," Dr. Jordan said; "Every war
is due lo human blundering or crimi
nality. Sickness in man is also due to
somebody's blunder, and the remedy
is sanitation. In like manner the rem
edy for war is sanitation—removing
the causes of difficulty beforehand. If
our Monroe doctrine is offensive to
other nations and a probable cause for

fundamental of democracy."
Pointing this moral in his customary
simple and convincing manner, Presi
dent David Starr .Jordan delivered bis
first address of the year to tne stu
dents in assembly at 10:15 this morn
ing. "Democracy and Peace" was Dr.
Jordan's subject. The link connecting
the two he found in the absence
of the institution of Privilege in a
democratic government.
Privilege, Dr. Jordan lucidly dem
onstrated, is indispensible to war and
incompatible with democracy. Privi
lege stands behind the puppet govern
ments of Europe, directs the war, and
reaps the profits; but the people pay
the price. America, on the oilier hand,
can never be true to its ideal of equal
ity before the law if it permits the
existance of privileged interests;
therefore America as a democracy can
never stand for war. This was the
conclusion lying behind the Presi
dent's straightforward talk of this
morning.
Hy way of introduction. Dr. Jordan
said, "When I went to college in 1868
I was undecided whether to become u
botanist or a rearer of fine sheep. As
things have turned out, the raising of
fine lambs has been my life work."
Showing that his interest in the lower
animals and his realization that what
ever laws relate to them also relate
to man, caused liini to study the eu
genics of war, the President continued.
"I developed the formula, 'War id
unreasoning anger and we must take
it out of the councils of nations.' In
private life we take our troubles to the
courts instead of to the field,' and in
the same way arbitration is a remedy
for the unreasoning anger of war. In
ternationalism. a fundamental of edu
cation is really a remedy for the prob
lems of war. Most wars are the rich
man's war and the poor man's fight.
Internationalism is the true cure for
this elass of war."
War is Worldsickness.
Illustrating by means of the Balkan
War the idea that "War is world
sickness," Dr. Jordan said; "Every war
is due lo human blundering or crimi
nality. Sickness in man is also due to
somebody's blunder, and the remedy
is sanitation. In like manner the rem
edy for war is sanitation—removing
the causes of difficulty beforehand. If
our Monroe doctrine is offensive to
other nations and a probable cause for
war, we should remedy it before it is
too late. It is offensive to Europe and
more so to the South American nations
which we boast of protecting. It. has
recently been attempted to make this
doctrine more obnoxious by applying
it to private companies, because of
supposed Japanese designs on Magda-

Lena Hay. Japan has no designs on
Magdalena Hay. The President
blocked this attempt to alter the Mon
roe Doctrine refusing to sign the con
gressional resolution. President-elect
Wilson, of whom we used to say that
he should have been a southern sena
tor before the war, may be the man to
smooth out the Monroe Doctrine."
(living the audience a look behind the
scenes at the Bulgarian War to show
that it is really only a large exploiting
project. Dr. Jordan stated that a few
bankers own nearly one-third of En
gland. and that the governments of
Europe are nearly all in the hands of

those exploiting establishments. This
proposition he developed by striking
illustrations and Comparisons. He
showed further that the people who do
not reap the profits do bear the bur
dens of these wars.
Mentioning the book, "Paris in Amer
ica," in which a Frenchman looked
away from privilege-ridden France to
democratic America, Dr. Jordan went
on, "There has been an ideal of Ameri
cans, which was the ideal of Dem
ocracy; and the only hope of America
lies in keeping this ideal. Democracy
implies freedom and equality of the
people and the best of expert service.
America should mean a chance for
each man to make the best of his own
life, which rests on the principle of
equality before the law. It was for
this that the forefathers came.
"The question at issue, then, is that
of privilege, .lust so long as we allow
corporations or individuals something
for nothing we violate the principles of
democracy.
"In the United States we have start
ed to make the mistake of giving some
thing for nothing. We have allowed
ships which we call "ours," but which
are owned by London and New York
bankers to go through the canal free.
These will be owned by the railroads
through the operation of the interlock
ing directorate. It is a blunder on the
part of the American people to give to
any individual or corporation any
thing without a corresponding return.
This is a fundamental of democracy.
It is really the principle behind the so
called Progressive movement."
