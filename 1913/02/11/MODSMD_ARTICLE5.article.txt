relay team in the nineteenth annual
intercollegiate relay carnival which
will be held at Franklin field in Phil
adelphia on April 12(». These races are

letic Association oil the last Saturday
in April.
Captain E. P. Campbell, *13, has
found it impossible to send a team
East this year and lias written Frank
1?. Ellis, graduate manager, to that
effect. Although it is impossible foi
Stanford to compete in the big meet
this year the eastern association hopes
that the University may find it possible
to send representatives in 1914. The
date of the relay carnival is only one
week after the annual track meet with

the idea had to be dropped for this
April.
