# Cooperation
## 
### 
A short time ago The Daily Palo Alto
called attention to the unsanitary con-

ditions existing at the
upper end of Lagunita.
Since then we are

pleased to note that t lie I niversity
authorities have removed the nuisance.
We hope that any future criticism we
may make concerning existing condi
tions will be looked upon by the au
thorities in the same light. Our criti
cisms are not made with any idea of
antagonism but solely in the hope of
improvement. There are many things
that come to the notice of the students
which the management of the Univer
sity cannot possibly know of in the
ordinary course of its business. Per
haps. too, there are many matters
which the students criticize which
would not be subjected to censure if
the underlying causes were known. It
is our aim to call attention to defects
as we see them in the hope that they
may lie removed. If we are right in
our criticisms we appreciate action.
If wrong, then we likewise, will wel
come the exposition of our errors. By
working together the authorities, fac
ulty, and students can accomplish
much for the betterment of Stanford.
What we need is cooperation.
