# McKENZIE WILL REFEREE CALIFORNIA SOCCER GAME.
## Contest With Blue and Gold to Take Place at Berkeley on Washington's Birthday. 
### 
Jack McKenzie of the Barbarian
Club of San Francisco has been se
lected to referee the soccer contest be
tween Stanford and California on
Washington's birthday. He is one of
the leading soccer enthusiasts around
the bay region and has played on his
club team for several seasons.
The game scheduled for February
22 is to take place at Berkeley. Since
the varsity nine is to play a baseball
game in the afternoon the California
players have asked that the match be
contested in the morning. This re
quest has been granted by the Stan
ford eleven. The exact time will be
announced later by Coach Maloney.
Since soccer has been placed on the
list of minor sports at California the
number of men turning out for the
game has increased. A coaching com
mittee has been formed to aid in in
structing the players.
