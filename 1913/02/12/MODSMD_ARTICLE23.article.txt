# MINING RECORDS BROKEN BY STANFORD ENGINEER.
## 
### 
E. A. Austin, ex-'O6, manager of the
Guggenheim interests in the Iditarod
district, arrived last night from New
York where he has been for the past
six weeks.
Austin left the university a month
before the earthquake of 1906, under a
contract with the Yukon Gold Com
pany and has remained with them
since. From a subordinate position
he has risen to be one of the most
eminent mining engineers in the United
States. During the last year he broke
two of the world's mining records in
installing and running plants, notwith
standing the fact that he was in one
of the most isolated spots of the world.
Austin leaves tonight for Los Angeles.
