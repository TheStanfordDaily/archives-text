# VOICE TESTS FOR JUNIOR OPERA ARE HELD TODAY
## COMMITTEE CANNOT DECIDE ON SUITABLE NAME. Second Tryouts Will Be Held Later to Choose Actors For Holes of the Play. 
### 
Tryout of voices for the Junior
Opera is being held this afternoon and
evening. The libretto, written by Miss
Emily McCord, '15, and the musical
numbers, composed by A. E. Stearns,
'16, are now in their final form, and re
hearsals will begin as soon as the voice
tests are completed and the characters
chosen.
A name for the opera will lie an
nounced in a few days.
The first act is laid in the Inner
Quad, on the night of the Senior Prom.
Veeda, a girl from the Mojave Indian
reservation is visited on the eve of
graduation by Kwitha, her tribal
lover, who has come to see the inter
collegiate meet, and stays over for
commencement.
Veeda has told her campus friends
she will return to the reservation to
teach her people. All of them, and
Hilly Framing in particular decide to
discourage the idea, in a visit to her
Arizona home during the summer.
In the ensemble of the first act, col
lege songs are sung in solo and chor
us by the graduates, and goodbyes are
said to Stanford.
The second act shows the young
squaws of the Mojaves in the midst of
the Huckleberry Festival, when those
of marriageable age are to light their
maiden fires and be chosen by admir
ing bucks. Billy Framing and Veeda's
other Stanford friendo reach the res
ervation on the evening that the
torches are lighted.
Veeda tells her grandmother that she
won't light her fire because she loves
Hilly, and can't marry him on account
of race difference. Then she learns
that she is not a member of the tribe,
but was rescued as a baby by Keemah,
her foster father, who found her in the
desert.
Billy enters the ceremony of the love
torches and chooses Veeda.
Eighteen musical numbers, including
choruses, quartets, and solos will be
given in the opera. Comedy will be
furnished by a rah-rah type of college
sport and his bull dog.
