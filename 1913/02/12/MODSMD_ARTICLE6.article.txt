# MISCHA ELMAN OFFERS FINE CONCERT PROGRAM.
## Celebrated Violinist Will Appear in Assembly Hall Tomorrow Night as Third of Musical Series. 
### 
A crowded Assembly Hall will greet
Mischa Elman tomorrow evening, when
the great violinist appears on the
Stanford stage in the third concert of
the Peninsula Musical Association ser
ies. The virtuoso is perhaps the most
popular of the artists brought to the
campus by the Association, and stand
ing room is already at a premium.
The program is an unusually inter
esting one, including as it does, Tar
tini's sonata in G minor, a favorite
of violinists with perfect technique,
Sarasate's Zigeunerweisen, and Wag
tier's Albumblat.
Percy Kahn is the accompanist. The
full program is as follows:
1. Sonata in D, Op 12, No. 1

Allegro con brio.—Tenia con
Variazioni (Andante con
