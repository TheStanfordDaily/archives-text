Tomorrow evening the annual Ed
ward Berwick Jr. Peace Prize Contest

will be held in room 214
of the History building.
The reward for this dis-

sertation is the gift of Mr. Edward
Berwick of Pacific Grove in memory of
bis son, Edward Berwick Jr., '02. His
idea in establishing this contest was
to promote the work in the University
along the lines of peace and oratory.
The contestants who will participate
in the dissertation tomorrow evening
have spent much time in preparation
and should furnish an instructive dis
cussion. The least we can do in ex
pressing our appreciation of the inter
est taken by Mr. Berwick is to turn
out and fill the room.
