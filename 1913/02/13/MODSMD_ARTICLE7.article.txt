# PROSPECTS FOR VICTORY IN TENNIS ARE BRIGHT
## FOUR VETERAN PLAYERS ARE IN COLLEGE. But One Man Missing From Last Year's Team.â€”Abundance of New Material. 
### 
With four veterans and seven other
promising racquet wielders trying for
the team, Stanford's chance of dupli
cating last year's victory in tennis ap
pears to be particularly bright. Of
the men who helped to defeat Califor
nia last spring, Captain V. Sheldon, '15,
Lynn Murray, '13, and W. N. Hutchin
son, '15, will again be seen on the
courts. The fourth veteran is P. S.
Pratt, '13, who was a member of the
Varsity two seasons ago.
H. S. Morgan, '12, is the only player
missing from the 1912 team. While
his loss is keenly felt, it is expected
that his place will not be hard to till
satisfactorily with the abundance of
material in college.
While Captain Sheldon is out for
the track this spring he will have time
to get into shape for the intercollegiate
tennis matches after the track meet.
This applies also to Murray, who is
at present running on the cinder path.
Neither of these men take long to get
into condition, so there is little fear
that they will not go on the court at
their best.
Moth Pratt and Hutchinson have
been showing up well in their practice
games. It was Pratt's good work com
bined with that of Miss Elsie Parker,
'12, that defeated all comers in the
mixed doubles tournament and won
for them the championship.
Of the new men, L. Sloss, '15, is the
strongest and gives promise of devel
oping into a first class Varsity player.
The Freshmen, H. L. Hahn and K.
Uhls. are both likely contestants for
places on the team. Other candidates,
who are ranked by the tennis coach
ing committee among the first eleven
men who can try out for the Varsity,
are H. S. Chapman, '16; F. C. Hunter,
16; T. J. Blethen, '13; and F. B. Hana
walt, '13.
The team will probably consist of four
men. There is, however, a possibility
of having an extra man for doubles,
thus raising the number of players on
the team to five. The try-outs are be
ing conducted in a new manner. The
number of men trying for places has
been limited to the eleven best, as
ranked by the coaching committee.
This method is proving to be of the
greatest satisfaction.

H. S. Morgan, '12, is the only player
missing from the 1912 team. While
his loss is keenly felt, it is expected
that his place will not be hard to till
satisfactorily with the abundance of
material in college.
While Captain Sheldon is out for
the track this spring he will have time
to get into shape for the intercollegiate
tennis matches after the track meet.
This applies also to Murray, who is
at present running on the cinder path.
Neither of these men take long to get
into condition, so there is little fear
that they will not go on the court at
their best.
Moth Pratt and Hutchinson have
been showing up well in their practice
games. It was Pratt's good work com
bined with that of Miss Elsie Parker,
'12, that defeated all comers in the
mixed doubles tournament and won
for them the championship.
Of the new men, L. Sloss, '15, is the
strongest and gives promise of devel
oping into a first class Varsity player.
The Freshmen, H. L. Hahn and K.
Uhls. are both likely contestants for
places on the team. Other candidates,
who are ranked by the tennis coach
ing committee among the first eleven
men who can try out for the Varsity,
are H. S. Chapman, '16; F. C. Hunter,
16; T. J. Blethen, '13; and F. B. Hana
walt, '13.
The team will probably consist of four
men. There is, however, a possibility
of having an extra man for doubles,
thus raising the number of players on
the team to five. The try-outs are be
ing conducted in a new manner. The
number of men trying for places has
been limited to the eleven best, as
ranked by the coaching committee.
This method is proving to be of the
greatest satisfaction.
