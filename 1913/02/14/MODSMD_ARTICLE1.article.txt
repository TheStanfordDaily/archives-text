nament for April 11 and 12. Greater
interest is being taken in the meet
than ever before. H. C. Richardson,
coach of the Salt Lake City High
School team has sent a letter asking
for information regarding the meet.
The possibility of schools from Ore
gon, Idaho, Utah and California com
peting, places the meet on a much
higher level than it has ever held he
fore.
Two preparatory institutions who
have never entered the meet before
have asked for membership in the as
sociation in order that they may enter
teams this spring. These are Drew's
Coaching School of San Francisco and
Anderson Military Academy. J. R.
Martin, tennis manager of the former
school has signified the intention of
entering a team in the tennis tourney.
Lawrence Chapman, captain of the
Santa Rosa team. C. W. Schlingheyde,
captain of the Lowell High School
squad and .lack Clark, manager of the
California Polytechnic School team of
San Luis Obispo have entered teams in
the track meet.
The Interscholastic Association is
an association of the high schools
which are members of it. In order to
compete in the annual meet the
schools must secure membership in
the association. However, it is nec
essary for a school to apply for admit
tance only once. This entitles them
to compete year after year without ap
plying for membership again.
