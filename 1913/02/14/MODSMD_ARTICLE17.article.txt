# Encourage
## 
### 
A few years ago there used to be
good sized turnouts for the Saturday

morning track meets
but lately there has
been a decided lack of

spirit shown by the student body.
Kach week a mere handful of rooters
no down to the oval to encourage the
contestants.
If there is one branch of athletics
that, needs support from the bleachers
and lots of it, it is the track. All the
pleasure the men get out of their work
is the interest that is manifested by
the students. There is no fun connect
ed with track training. It is a hard
steady grind from the beginning of
the season to the end. It surely can't
be very encouraging for a man to
train every day and compete in trials
once a week with only the trainers and
competing athletes interested in his
work. Winning the trial satisfies one
man but the others must console them
selves in losing. Losers can be de
veloped into winners if they receive
the proper encouragement in their
work. What they need is the backing
of the students.
We have the makings of a wonderful
team this year if we will give the men
our undivided support. Stanford has
accomplished the seemingly impossible

in times gone by and it has been done
by the entire student body getting be
hind the teams. What we have done
we can do again.
