# Keep Your Seats
## 
### 
Another word in connection with the
track meets. When ydu go down to

the meets keep off the oval.
There are plenty of seats in
the bleachers for everyone
and the view is much better.
Last Saturday everybody

wanted to be inside the track and as a
result the men in the field events were
greatly handicapped. It is not neces
sary to get hold of the tape to see
who wins a race. If everybody except
the officials and contestants will stay
up in the bleachers the meets will be
run off faster and with better results.
