ing to bring to the Assembly Hall the

The San Francisco Symphony Or
chestra is undoubtedly the finest or
ganization of its kind west of Chicago,
it has reached an enviable position in
the world's musical circles, and its

Elman Appreciated.
Music lovers of the Peninsula filled
the Assembly Hall last, night to over
flowing and were rewarded by a pro
gram of masterful violin selections
that showed consummate art in theplay
er, Mischa Elman. The young Rus
sian played on the heartstrings of his
hearers, his wonderful mellow tone,
and his perfect technique stamping
him as an artist of the highest type.
Elman was generous with encores,
and responded to the repeated requests
of the audience for more with selec
tions that proved in some cases to be
the favorites of the evening. The ac
companiment of Percy Kahn left noth
ing to be desired.
The last of the concert series will
he given during the last week in March
hy the Russian pianist, Josef Lhevinne.
