# JAPANESE STUDENT GIVES WINNING PEACE ADDRESS.
## Berwick Prize is Won by I.M. Akahoshi, '13, in Spirited Contest of Four Speakers. 
### 
I. M. Akahoshi, '13, won the annual
Berwick Peace Prize Friday evening,
against an opposition of three speak
ers. The arguments for international
peace brought out by the contestants
were interesting in substance and in
the manner they were advanced.
The four speakers were: I. M. Aka
hoshi, '13 G. Holcomb, '11, P. D. Now
ell, '13, and A. F. Coyle, '15. Three
other students who were scheduled tc
speak were not present.
Two points of Akahoshi's speech
that were most warmly urged were
that the removal of protective tariff
by nations, and the extensive use â€¢of
an international language would help
the cause of world peace.
Holcomb stated that parties to a
national quarrel should get together in
a conference before bloodshed instead
of after, lie insisted that in that way
most needs for war would be over
come by sane thought.
Removal of the means of warfare
was advocated by Nowell. He de
clared that so long as great navies
and armies are supported the cause
of peace cannot be secure.
Coyle favored a gradual movement
toward peace by wide diffusion of ed
ucation. His means of educating the
world would be through exchange of
professors between countries, the sup
port of cosmopolitan clubs, and the ed
ucation of present and coming genera
tions in the schools.
