Ireland and his Independents took
their second same from Stanford Sat
urday by defeating the Varsity 4 to 15
The victory was the result of errors,
as the Cardinal players outhit the vis
itors and kept the result in doubt until
the last out was registered.
Nine hits were secured off Schimpf
by the Varsity, while the visitors drt w
but six safeties from the Stanford of
ferings. Captain Ireland featured in
a double play in the ninth which put
an end to a garrison finish, resulting
in two runs.
Freshman Noonan scored the initial
run for the Varsity in the fifth frame.
A long clout carried him to third, lie
came home when McCloskey dumped
the ball in a play which brought the
rooters to their feet. In the ninth
Noonan and Workman scored.
Duffy Lewis, of the Hoston Red Sox.
was the first to register for Ireland,
lie went to first on a hit, to second
on an error and was brought home by
Perkins' single. Stanford's undoing
came in the sixth, when Kennedy,
Swain and Lewis scored as a result of
two bits and three errors.
Halm opened the game for Stanford
and kept the three hits he allowed well
scattered. Gragg went on the mound
in the fatal sixth and was replaced by
Maple in the eighth.
Two snappy double plays by the In
dependents were features. Cliff Ire
land was armed with his usual line of
comedy. The Stanford Band played
