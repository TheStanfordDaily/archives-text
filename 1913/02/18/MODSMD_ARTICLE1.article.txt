# YACHT SCENE TANGLES "ON THE QUIET" SCHEMES
## SOPHOMORES USE ASSEMBLY HALL IN REHEARSAL. Work on Settings and Lines of Third Act Being Combined to Offer Comedy Situations. 
### 
Until the production of "On The
Quiet" on February 28, Sophomore
stage craft will lie developed at As
sembly Hall rehearsals. The cast (bat
will offer the comedy has mastered the
difficulties of the first two acts, under
the coaching of Garnet Holme, and is
now well launched on the spectacular
yacht scene of the final act.
Scenery is being built and painted
by the Alcazar studio in San Francis
co. The great stage achievement of
the artists is to be a scene that shows
two decks of an ocean-going yacht. To
contrast with the usual confusion of
storm at sea, the author of "On the
Quiet" lias confronted his characters
with a becalmed sea, and a pursuing
steam tug, which furnishes occasion
for tangled comedy.
Millions rampant, dukes, beautiful
heiresses, college scape-graces, and ex
acting brothers are thrown together
in an appalling jumble of situations
that will keep tlie audience guessing
how the schemes that are being car
ried out "on the quiet" will resolve
themselves.
On the whole, the production prom
ises to be rich in humor and scenic
fixtures.
Pictures of the cast in costume, il
lustrating tableau scenes, were taken
yesterday. Posters will be placed on
the Quad Wednesday.
