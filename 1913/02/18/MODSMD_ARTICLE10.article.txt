For a number of years it has been
the custom of the alumni to hold their

annual banquet on
Founders' Day but here
tofore the affair has al
ways taken place in San

Francisco. This year the committee
in charge has arranged to have the
banquet in Encina so that the under
graduates and faculty can join in the
gathering. This move on the part of
the alumni is one that should be Wel
comed by the student body. There is
nothing that can be of more benefit to
a university than a strong alumni a&
sociation. In the East Ihe graduate
body plays an important part in the af
fairs of the older institutions and
there are frequent gatherings held for
the purpose of bringing together the
old and Ihe new members of the uni
versities. Stanford has not been in
existence long enough to have as
strong an alumni association as our
Eastern contemporaries. Relatively
speaking our association is in its in
fancy and it is up to the present stu
dent body to aid in advancing the or
ganization. The best way that this
can be done is to bring the alumni
back to tin? campus occasionally. There
is nothing that rekindles the sentiment
in the old grads so much as a visit to
the Farm and there are many who will
take the time to come back if there
is some incentive for their return.
The gathering on Founders' Day
will be of untold benefit to Stanford
if the student body will play its part
There will be two hundred alumni at
the banquet and we must have as
many undergraduates. Much can be
accomplished by the closer relation
ship between the old students and the
new. TheYc are many alumni who are
eager to aid their Alma Mater and we
need their assistance. The alumni
want to hear from us as to how we
think they can best direct their efforts.
March 8 is a good time to get together
and tnlk things over.
