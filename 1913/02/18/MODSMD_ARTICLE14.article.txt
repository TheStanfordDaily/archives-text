# SENIORS PLAN FOUR UNIVERSIIY EVENTS
## 1913 TO BE HOST AT SOCIAL AFFAIRS. University Dance, Masquerade, and Barbecue, and Moving Pictures Are on the Program. 
### 
Before filling your "date-book" for
the remainder of the semester, consult
the Senior class. If present plans
mature the class of 1913 will furnish
enough amusement during the ensu
ing few months to keep the entire stu
dent body in excellent spirits. The
prospective program of hilarious
events follows:
March I—University Dance at the
Armory.
March It —University Masquerade at
the Armory.
April I—Moving pictures of Inter
collegiate Game at the Armory.
April 20 —University Barbecue at the
Armory.
The first of these events is a cer
tainity. The others are probabilities
and will be definitely decided upon at
an important meeting of the Senior
Class tomorrow afternoon. They have
been arranged under the supervision
of the committee appointed last sem
ester by President W. M. Argabrite for
the purpose of devising ways and
means to raise funds. The members
of this committee are 11. (r. Boyd, L. C.
Lull, and P. S. Pratt.
The purpose of the Senior Class in
providing these various entertain
ments is twofold. Part of it is purely
financial. Again, the class of 1913
hopes to aid attendance at its Senior
Week by enabling underclassmen to
become better acquainted among them
selves and with the Seniors, and also
by innoculating them with the amuse
ment bug. 1913 plans a Senior Week
"bigger and better than ever," and be
lieves that these preliminary events
will increase interest in the post grad
uation festivities.
The dance on March 1 is to follow
the lines of the ordinary campus
dances. Having the backing of the
entire class, however, it should be
more elaborate in its nature. At the
dance of March 14 masks and cos'
fumes will be strictly in order.
