Editor Daily Palo Alto:
As a Stanford fail grown gray in the
service I should appreciate the privi
!e;e if you would allow nie to toe the
rubber for a moment and float across
a suggestion or two for the betterment
o;' (he baseball situation. Let me
hasten to observe that 1 do not pro
note to reconstruct the managerial
policies of Coach l'eters: the Wednes
day game with St. Mary's seems to in
dicate that it would be advisable to
permit him to struggle along without
assistance from the bleachers. My
humble suggestions deal rather with
Ihe grosser, more material aspects of
the game.
Is there any compelling reason —
apart from immemorial tradition —
why the Varsity should be garbed, dur
ing three-fourths of the scheduled
sames, like a solar spectrum in a mud
storm? Violet-i'ndigo-blue-green-yel
low-orange-red is not the Stanford
color. Why llien do we so blithely
sport it'-' We now have one of the best
and prettiest ballfields in the West:
the visiting nines are nearly always
trimly uniformed; the stands are filled
with enthusiastic rooters; the team
is the fastest we have had in years —
and the men are dressed as if they
shop. Why not adopt a suitable shade
shop: Why not adopt a suitable shade
of gray for the suits, with Stanford
cardinal for belts and stockings, and
stick to it J Each spring let the squad
designated by the coach be measured
for uniforms, and let the prep-school
niultiforms be relegated to little Willie.
After all, the California games aren't
the entire hippodrome—some of us
are more than liable to graduate be
fore we s-ee a speedier exhibition of
the national pastime than the team
delivered Wednesday.
Worry No. -. Have we enough
catchers as good as Dent to feel no
inconvenience if we should break the
necks of a few of them with our play
ers' benches? Personally 1 don't think
we have, but granting that point for
the argument's sake, isn't it rather
expensive to lose a sky-scraping foul
just because it falls into a thicket of
players, bats, demijohns, and other
bric-a-brac, all of which, under the
rules, should be at least ninety feet
from the lines? We all admire the
nerve of our catchers, who are noth
ing if not regardless of personal com
fort, but coming a, cropper over those
handsome mission benches is really
trifle more than the regular day's
work seems to call for. Why not copy
a good point in the big league parks
and install a couple of "Rathskellers"
(I use the word in a purely technical
sense) against the wall of the stands?
That for the home team would be near
the present location of the ding-dong
and the war-scribe (twin glories o'
our up-to-date plant,) while the other
would be correspondingly situated on
the third-base side. A projecting roof
would afford all needful protection
from the encroachments of too inquis
itive fans, and the nimble mit-wielder
would then be able to snare the un
suspecting foul with neatness and pre
cision.
Ninety-five.

would afford all needful protection
from the encroachments of too inquis

Editor Daily Palo Alto:
As a Stanford fail grown gray in the
service I should appreciate the privi
!e;e if you would allow nie to toe the
rubber for a moment and float across
a suggestion or two for the betterment
o;' (he baseball situation. Let me
hasten to observe that 1 do not pro
note to reconstruct the managerial
policies of Coach l'eters: the Wednes
day game with St. Mary's seems to in
dicate that it would be advisable to
permit him to struggle along without
assistance from the bleachers. My
humble suggestions deal rather with
Ihe grosser, more material aspects of
the game.
Is there any compelling reason —
apart from immemorial tradition —
why the Varsity should be garbed, dur
ing three-fourths of the scheduled
sames, like a solar spectrum in a mud
storm? Violet-i'ndigo-blue-green-yel
low-orange-red is not the Stanford
color. Why llien do we so blithely
sport it'-' We now have one of the best
and prettiest ballfields in the West:
the visiting nines are nearly always
trimly uniformed; the stands are filled
with enthusiastic rooters; the team
is the fastest we have had in years —
and the men are dressed as if they
shop. Why not adopt a suitable shade
shop: Why not adopt a suitable shade
of gray for the suits, with Stanford
cardinal for belts and stockings, and
stick to it J Each spring let the squad
designated by the coach be measured
for uniforms, and let the prep-school
niultiforms be relegated to little Willie.
After all, the California games aren't
the entire hippodrome—some of us
are more than liable to graduate be
fore we s-ee a speedier exhibition of
the national pastime than the team
delivered Wednesday.
Worry No. -. Have we enough
catchers as good as Dent to feel no
inconvenience if we should break the
necks of a few of them with our play
ers' benches? Personally 1 don't think
we have, but granting that point for
the argument's sake, isn't it rather
expensive to lose a sky-scraping foul
just because it falls into a thicket of
players, bats, demijohns, and other
bric-a-brac, all of which, under the
rules, should be at least ninety feet
from the lines? We all admire the
nerve of our catchers, who are noth
ing if not regardless of personal com
fort, but coming a, cropper over those
handsome mission benches is really
trifle more than the regular day's
work seems to call for. Why not copy
a good point in the big league parks
and install a couple of "Rathskellers"
(I use the word in a purely technical
sense) against the wall of the stands?
That for the home team would be near
the present location of the ding-dong
and the war-scribe (twin glories o'
our up-to-date plant,) while the other
would be correspondingly situated on
the third-base side. A projecting roof
would afford all needful protection
from the encroachments of too inquis
itive fans, and the nimble mit-wielder
would then be able to snare the un
