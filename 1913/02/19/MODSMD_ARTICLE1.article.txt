exercises in the Assembly Hall on
March 9. The 1913 classmen are also
to march to the Tomb of the Stanfords
after the address by Doctor Henry Van
Dyke, the eminent Princeton Profes
sor and divine, and decorate the maus
oleum. A special reservation is to be
made* in the Assembly Hall to accom
modate the Seniors who are to meet
in the Chapel shortly before the hour
set for the exercises. The women are
to wear caps and gowns. The men are
asked to be attired In dark suits.
The Seniors are urged to attend the
address as this is one of the few op
portunities when the undergraduates
have occasion to honor the memory of
the founders of the University.
That the Seniors might be well rep
resented at the Founders' Day banquet
in Encina clubroom on the evening of
March 8, plans of the affair were
placed before the class and an appeal
made for a large reservation of seats.
An innovation in class entertain
ments is to be attempted next Thurs
day evening when a picnic is to be held
in the foot hills.. President I. I. In
graham has named the following com
mittee to prepare for the picnic: W.
M. Argabrite, chairman, Miss V. Wag
ner, Miss R. Seeley, K. R. Levy, F. B.
Belcher and W. J. Dodge.
Plans for the series of entertain
ments to be given this semester were
also discussed. The dance on March
1 is the first of these functions and is
to be in the nature of a campus dance.
Programs are to be made out previous
to the dance. The finance committee
asks that it be made clear that the
dance is not in the nature of a Jolly-
Up and is to be open to the entire
university public. The proceeds are
to be used toward defraying the ex
penses of the great Senior week of fes
tivities which have been planned for
the final days of the semester.
A report of the treasurer showed
that there was a balance of $250 on
the right side of the class ledger.
