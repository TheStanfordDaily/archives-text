# STANFORD AGAIN DOWNS ST. MARY'S IN BASEBALL
## CARDINALS KNOCK GLAVENICH OUT OF THE BOX. Coach Peters' Men Take Revenge on Twirler Who Blanked Them Before. 
### 
Timely hitting and daring base run
ning coupled with Glavenich's wlld
ness enabled Stanford to defeat St.
Mary's this afternoon. The final score
was 10 to 2.
The supposedly invincible Phoenix
heaver was as wild as a March hare
today and when he was able to
locate the plate the Stanford stickers
drove his offerings to all corners of
the lot. Two home runs were made
off Glavenich in the second, Halm and
Cass connecting for the round trip.
Johnson who replaced him in the third
held the Cardinal batters safe but the
damage had been done.
Halm pitched a masterful game and
was accorded excellent support.
