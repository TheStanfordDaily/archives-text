# Founders' Day
## 
### 
Today the Senior Class voted to at
tend the Founders' Day services in a

body. This is a
praiseworthy action
but why stop with

the Seniors? The Stanfords have giv
en us their all. We take what they
have so magnanimously bestowed and
in return what do we do? Founders'
Day is the one day in the year that is
set aside by the University to com
memorate the founders of our institu
tion. The members of the University
both faculty and students should wel
rome this opportunity to honor the
memory of those to whom we owe so
much. We would like to see the other
classes follow the example of the Sen
iors and each attend in a body.
