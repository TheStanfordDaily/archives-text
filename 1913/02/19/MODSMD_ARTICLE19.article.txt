# FOIL AND MASK WILL FENCE AT CALIFORNIA.
## Eight Cardinal Representatives Entered in Women's Tournament. Maloney to Meet Fencing Instructor. 
### 
On the morning of Washington's
Birthday, the representatives of the
Foil and Mask Society will engage in
a fencing tournament with California.
The following women from Stanford
will make the trip to Berkeley:â€”Rose
Bennett, Hilda Volkmor, Maria Eus
tace, Mary Gard, Evelyn Trent, Fran
ces Odenheimer, Blanche Whelan and
Jeannette Hitchcock.
Immediately following the women's
tournament, H. W. Maloney, the Stan
ford instructor, will meet Louis Itan
delle, teacher of fencing of California
in a bout with the foil. Randelle is the
author of the only established book on
"Fencing" which was published some
time ago in England. He held the po
sition of fencing master at the Boston
Athletic Club and Harvard University
from 1889 until two years ago when
he became connected with the Univer
sity of California. Maloney ranks very
high in fencing circles of the country,
since in 1907 he won the champion
ship of the Pacific Coast. The meet
ing of these two exponents of skill and
dexterity is certain to give a fine exhi
bition of the art of fencing.
