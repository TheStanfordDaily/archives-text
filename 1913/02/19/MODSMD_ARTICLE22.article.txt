Probation Officer Astredo of San
Francisco lectured in the Chapel yes
terday afternoon under the auspices
of the Y. W. C. A. r l he subject of his
address was "Constructive Criticism
of the .Juvenile Court."
"Some have the idea that the Juven
ile Court is a panacea for all wrong
doing, and thus we have all kinds of
trivial complaints against children,"
said the speaker. Others criticize th_
court because juveniles are out at
night and in the dance halls. These
are not constructive criticisms.
"Most of our failures are with girls.
This is due to two reasons; generally
they have gone further along the path
of wrong-doing before they come to
our notice, and then it is always much
harder to find proper places for them
in homes."
