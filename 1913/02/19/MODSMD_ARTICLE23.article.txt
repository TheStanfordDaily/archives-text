### 
Professor V. L. Kellogg spoke on the
"Life of Thomas Huxley" in the Phys
iology lecture room last evening. He
briefly outlined the life history of the
scientist and showed the personality
of the man.
The speaker, who is the author of
"Darwinism To-day," brought out the
parallelism of these two great con
temporaries, and Huxley's influence in
the acceptance of Darwin's theory of
evolution.
