# STANFORD SOCCER TEAM WILL MEET CALIFORNIA
## INTERCOLLEGIATE MATCH TO BE PLAYED SATURDAY. Williamson Trophy to Be contested For in Third Game of the Series. 
### 
Stanford soccer team will meet the
Blue and Gold eleven in the third
game of the series for the Williamson
Trophy on Saturday afternoon on Cal
ifornia Field. The Cardinal players
already have one victory to their cred
it and if they win Saturday's contest
the cup will remain here for another
year. The second game resulted in a
2-2 tie.
Despite the fact that the men have
had but one practice contest and wii
line-up without the services of F. H.
Hilton, '11, their experience should be
too great for the Blue and Gold eleven
to overcome. The eleven has been
weakened at different times by in
juries but Coach H. W. Maloney will
have the men in the best possible
shape for Saturday.
Since soccer was made a minor
sport at California this semester for
which a "circle C" is given, a large
squad has turned out. A number of
new players have been discovered to
augment the team, which has been
playing with ten veterans in its line
up. Although Stanford should win,
Maloney believes that it will only do
so by the hardest kind of a fight as the
Blue and Gold men are playing an im
proved game.
If California should win, the series
will still stand one ail and a fourth
game will be necessary to decide which
eleven is to have the trophy.
This afternoon the last practice will
l e held on the turf field and the line
up for Saturday's contest will be an
nounced by Coach Maloney.
