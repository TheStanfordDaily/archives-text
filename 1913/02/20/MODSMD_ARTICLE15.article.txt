# Keep On The Path

### 
Acting upon the request of Crew
Captain Duryea, Farm Superintendent

Hewston has placed a
turn stile in the fence
that crosses the path

between Lagunita and
Lasuen. The Daily Palo Alto, in be
half of the Student Body, wishes to
thank the superintendent for his ser
vices in accommodating the crew men
and the residents of the row. The
management had good reason for not
granting this request but again they
evinced their desire to aid the stu
dents. Each spring a great deal of the
grain is trampled down by the users
of the path cutting across the field.
The erection of the stile means that
more will take this route. If the au
thorities have been so generous as to
give us a more convenient approach
to the Lake, we should be considerate
of their property and keep on the path.
