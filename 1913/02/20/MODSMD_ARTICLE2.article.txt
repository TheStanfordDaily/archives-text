Tryouts for the Tri-State Debating
teajns will lie held in the Chapel next
Friday afternoon at 2 o'clock. The
question for discussion will be the

States of all unskilled labor of the
Slavonic, Hellenic, and Italic races
of Eastern Europe should be prohib
ited."
All who desire to try out should
hand their names to F. B. Belcher, '13,

will be allowed eight minutes for the
constructive speech and three minutes
for rebuttal.
There will be two teams chosen,
each consisting of two men and an al

to argue the negative of the question
against the University of Washington.
The other team will uphold the af
firmative against the University of
Oregon in a debate to be held in the
Stanford Assembly Hall. Washington
will also send a team to Oregon, so
that there will be a debate at each of
the three Universities. According to
the Tri-State agreement all the con
tests will take place on the night of
March 28.
