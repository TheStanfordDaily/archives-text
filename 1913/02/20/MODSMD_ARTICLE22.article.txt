The outlook for a successful con
cert tour of Southern California by the
Stanford Hand during Easter vacation
is bright. P. E. Blanchard, '13, as
sistant manager of the Hand, who has
charge of the spring trip, has written
letters to twenty-eight southern high
schools regarding dates. Enthusiastic
answers received to date promise a
hearty reception of the Cardinal mus
icians in the South.
