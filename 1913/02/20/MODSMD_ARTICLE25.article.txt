# O.B. COLDWELL, '01, GIVES ORIGINAL REPORT.
## Electrical Engineering Department Receives Blueprint Copy of Technical Investigation by Graduate. 
### 
O. B. Cold well, '01, General Super
intendent, Light and Power Depart
ment, Portland Railway, Light and
Power Company has presented to the
department of Electrical Engineering
a blueprint copy of a large report nit
on an extensive technical investigation
conducted by himself and co-workers.
One hundred and seventy-five oscillo
gram records were made of voltage
.strains induced in an extensive high
tension power transmission system un
der normal and abnormal conditions
of operation. The report is made up of
the original oscillograms, related
structural data and an exceptionally
well made and well written analysis of
results.
This report is of great value to the
Electrical Engineering department for
purposes of instruction.
