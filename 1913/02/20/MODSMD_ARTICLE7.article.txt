# DUKE MARRIES HEIRESS FOR LOVE-ON THE QUIET
## SOPHOMORE PLAY GOES IN FACE OF TITLE MARKET THEORY. Antics of Cupid Effect Romance of Three Fair Girls and Their Sixty Millions. 
### 
Prompted by unadulterated love, a
duke of the realm with a monocle and
a family tree of gray age marries a
beautiful American heiress to twenty
millions in the Sophomore comedy "On
the Quiet." And the heiress is so
wrapped in the love of her noble hus
band that she doesn't care one bit for
her new title or a chance to be pre
sented at St. James' court.
So for a few hours of plotting and
planning the time honored tradition
that is supposed to govern internation
al marriages is laughed at, and the
audience is convinced that an English
man may be a pretty good sort and a
nobleman at one time.
In some way or other before the cur
tain rises 011 the second resounding
act of "On the Quiet" the duke begins
to stew over a fear that his wife was
a mere title seeker. He makes an ef
fective test case by inviting a bevy of
chorus ladies to take breakfast in his
apartment. By previous arrangement
his wife and relatives happen along at
a dramatic moment. There is an ex
plosion and near hair pulling. By the
time the duke has finished explaining
situations he feels quite sure that his
wife loves him.
After that scene the audience is al
lowed to consider the duke and his
wife happily married so they turn to
consideration of some mixups (on the
quiet) of two other heiresses to twen
ty millions and their lovers. New
scenery is being painted by the Tom
Crowley Company of San Francisco.
