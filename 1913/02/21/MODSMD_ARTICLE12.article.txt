# Roughneckism
## 
### 
Stanford University has a democrat
ic Student Body. Any one who dis-

claims this is either
abnormally prejudic
ed or knows not

whereof he speaks. Actions are tol
erated here that would not be conn
tenanced in other communities. As a
part of our democracy there has been
a growing custom on the part of the
men during the last few years to at
tend the University functions in the
capacity of onlookers. In fact the
presence of the so-called "roughs" has
come to be expected by guests and
hosts.
Despite this healthy state of affair*
there has been a tendency on the part
of ihe weaker minded to take advan
tage of this democracy—this main
spring of the Stanford Spirit which
makes life on the Farm so enjoyable.
Last semester complaints were made
to the University Conference regard
ing the conduct of some of the roughs
who were wont to frequent the var
ious functions. The Conference
thought that if "roughneckism" was
carried on in a manner befitting col
lege men there was absolutely no harm
in the custom. It was the consensus
of opinion at the time that there had
been a few who had given away to
their boyish instincts and had commit
ted acts which they would frown upon
in their more sober moments. Ac
cordingly a resolution was passed con
demning acts of "roughneckism" but
the mere looking-on was considered
no particular evil.
Hut. recently the spirit of hoodlum
ism has broken out worse than ever.
Such acts as those set forth by the
Conference in their statement would
b<> punitive offenses in other localities.
Evidently there are men in this Uni
versity who have no business here,
if they have not learned the rudiments
of decency at home they should have
been sent to Whittier Reform School
where the State furnishes such an
education free of charge.
Nine out of ten of the men who at
tend the functions as "roughnecks"
are as tine fellows as are to be found
in the University. But there is a dif
ference between being an interested,
gentlemanly onlooker and a sneaking,
vile-mouthed intruder. But the fact
that there are men in our midst with
perverted senses means that the ma
jority of the fellows will have to fore
go the harmless pastime of "rough
necking."
Resolutions apparently have been of
no avail and there were only two pos

sible ways to suppress the offenders.
Either the Student Council would have
to assume the role of detectives at
each function, or else "roughneckism"
in all its forms must cease. The for
mer is obviously impossible. So dies
the custom of "roughneckism," a vic
tim of the offensive few.

erated here that would not be conn
tenanced in other communities. As a
part of our democracy there has been
a growing custom on the part of the
men during the last few years to at
tend the University functions in the
capacity of onlookers. In fact the
presence of the so-called "roughs" has
come to be expected by guests and
hosts.
Despite this healthy state of affair*
there has been a tendency on the part
of ihe weaker minded to take advan
tage of this democracy—this main
spring of the Stanford Spirit which
makes life on the Farm so enjoyable.
Last semester complaints were made
to the University Conference regard
ing the conduct of some of the roughs
who were wont to frequent the var
ious functions. The Conference
thought that if "roughneckism" was
carried on in a manner befitting col
lege men there was absolutely no harm
in the custom. It was the consensus
of opinion at the time that there had
been a few who had given away to
their boyish instincts and had commit
ted acts which they would frown upon
in their more sober moments. Ac
cordingly a resolution was passed con
demning acts of "roughneckism" but
the mere looking-on was considered
no particular evil.
Hut. recently the spirit of hoodlum
ism has broken out worse than ever.
Such acts as those set forth by the
Conference in their statement would
b<> punitive offenses in other localities.
Evidently there are men in this Uni
versity who have no business here,
if they have not learned the rudiments
of decency at home they should have
been sent to Whittier Reform School
where the State furnishes such an
education free of charge.
Nine out of ten of the men who at
tend the functions as "roughnecks"
are as tine fellows as are to be found
in the University. But there is a dif
ference between being an interested,
gentlemanly onlooker and a sneaking,
vile-mouthed intruder. But the fact
that there are men in our midst with
perverted senses means that the ma
jority of the fellows will have to fore
go the harmless pastime of "rough
necking."
Resolutions apparently have been of
no avail and there were only two pos

sible ways to suppress the offenders.
Either the Student Council would have
to assume the role of detectives at
each function, or else "roughneckism"
in all its forms must cease. The for
mer is obviously impossible. So dies
the custom of "roughneckism," a vic
tim of the offensive few.
Stanford University has a democrat
ic Student Body. Any one who dis-

claims this is either
abnormally prejudic
ed or knows not

whereof he speaks. Actions are tol
