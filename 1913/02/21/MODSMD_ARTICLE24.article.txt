# EASTERN CRITIC PRAISES WORK OF MADAME WRIGHT.
## American Artiste, Who Appears at Markers Sunday, Has Glowing European Reputation. 
### 
Mme. Herbst-Wright, who has won
fame as a singer in Europe, is but lit
tle known in her native land. A Palo|
Alto lady, however, recently received I
a letter from a friend in New York ;
who had heard Mme. Herbst-Wright
sing, and he speaks of her singing in
the following glowing terms:
"Monday evening I had the pleasure j
of meeting Mme. Ina Herbst-Wright—J
a singer of little fame in America but!
one whose claim to greatness needs j
only the approval of the critics and the ;
opportunity to hear her to stamp her j
as an artiste of rare attainments. It
has been my good fortune to hear most
of the great sopranos of recent years
and Mme. Herbst-Wright suffers in
no way by comparison with the great
est.
"She possesses a voice of wonderful
range—low A flat to high E Hat—and of
a wonderfully sympathetic quality,
and the gift that so many of our sing
ers lack, temperament, which is guided
by a mind of intelligence. Let the peo
ple of Palo Alto know what to expect
and let them show their appreciation
as I know they will in a warm and
hearty greeting to this artist who is a
hearty greeting to this artiste who is a
try."
The concert is to he given at Miss
Harker's School Sunday afternoon at
4 o'clock. Mrs. F. C. Woodward will
be the accompanist.
