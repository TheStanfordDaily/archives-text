not serve as sleuths to ferret out the
guilty parties. Time and again reso

condemning hoodluiiiisin and the co
operation of the various organizations i

sions of sentiment have been of no
a v ;iil. In order to safeguard the wel
fare of the guests and preserve the
existence of social functions the above
rule is deemed necessary and will be
rigidly enforced.
In addition to the above action the
Conference expressed as its opinion
that a new swimming test of a more
thorough nature be put into effect and
so advised the committee which is to
take charge of the matter.

The above action was taken by the
University Conference at its meeting j
last evening and is to go into force

reached only after a careful discussion
of all the phases of the situation and
the vote was unanimous. Following
are the reasons for the action as set
forth by the student governing body: —
Last fall a resolution was passed by
the University Conference barring the
"roughneck" element at dances. At
that time it was stated that si moderate
form of "roughtieckisin," such as

called to our attention: the forcible
opening of windows, iitsnltiiiu* remarks
made to guests, the blowing of smoke
in ladies' faces, jabbing ladies with
sticks and asking them to move from
the windows, repeatedly throwing a
dog on the dance floor, the stealing of
property of the house.
The Conference realizes that the,
great majority of the men who attend
the university functions as rough
necks are not guilty of any of the above j
offenses but the Student Council can- j
not serve as sleuths to ferret out the
guilty parties. Time and again reso

sions of sentiment have been of no
a v ;iil. In order to safeguard the wel
fare of the guests and preserve the
existence of social functions the above
rule is deemed necessary and will be
rigidly enforced.
In addition to the above action the
Conference expressed as its opinion
that a new swimming test of a more
thorough nature be put into effect and
so advised the committee which is to
take charge of the matter.
Professor A. I?. Clark, chairman of
the Faculty Committee on Student Af

relation between llie student govern
ing body and the University. Me said
in part that the Faculty Student Af
fairs Committee existed and would al
ways continue in existence according
to the rules of organization of the Uni
versity. but so long as the students
continued to efficiently govern them
selves there would never be any re
sumption of control by the faculty.
