# INTERCOLLEGIATE SOCCER SERIES WON BY STANFORD
## CALIFORNIA LOSES THIRD GAME THREE TO TWO. Cardinal Players Score Winning Goal Near End of Contest at Berkeley On Saturday. 
### 
Scoring the winning point within the
last three minutes of final time, Stan
ford soccer team defeated California
at Berkeley on Saturday afternoon by
3 goals to 2. The victory gives the
Cardinal players the intercollegiate
series and the Williamson trophy for
another year.
Stanford's victory was due to a gar
rison finish. With the greater part of
the second half over, California was
leading by the score of 2 to 0. The
Cardinal men rallied and played their
opponents off their feet. A long goal
by Captain Pellas and another by Ben
nie Erb placed the teams on even
terms.
For a time it appeared as though
the third match of the series would re
result in a 2-2 tie as the second game
did. Three minutes from the end
however, a Blue and Gold player foul
ed and gave Stanford the opportunity
to win. Art Erb took the ball on the
free kick, cleverly passed to his bro
ther Bennie and the latter sent, the
sphere into the net with the winning
point.
Both teams struggled through the
first half and part of the second before
either could get the ball past the goal
keeper. California came through with
two in quick succession. After But
cher had skillfully saved a shot by Doz
ler, Thorpe, another Blue and Gold for
ward, tallied the first point of the
game. Shortly afterwards Mills, the
California captain, placed his eleven
two goals in the lead by a lucky kick.
Against a two point lead, the Cardi
nal forwards played with far better
combination than they had earlier in
the contest and kept, the Blue and Gold
goalkeeper busy. But for the excel
lent work of Barbera, Stanford would
have rolled up a much greater score.
in the first half the Cardinal players
had a slight advantage over their op
ponents. On several occasions the
men threw away what seemed to be
certain scores. Only once did the pig
skin find its way into the net. Art
Erb placed the ball between the up
rights but was off-side and the goal
was not allowed.
The game was Ihe fastest that has
been played between the two univer
sities and the result was in doubt un
til the very end. As usual Stanford's
offence was strong; but the players
are still somewhat on the defence.
The game was satisfactorily refereed
by James Wardlow.

Scoring the winning point within the
last three minutes of final time, Stan
ford soccer team defeated California
at Berkeley on Saturday afternoon by
3 goals to 2. The victory gives the
Cardinal players the intercollegiate
series and the Williamson trophy for
another year.
Stanford's victory was due to a gar
rison finish. With the greater part of
the second half over, California was
leading by the score of 2 to 0. The
Cardinal men rallied and played their
opponents off their feet. A long goal
by Captain Pellas and another by Ben
nie Erb placed the teams on even
terms.
For a time it appeared as though
the third match of the series would re
result in a 2-2 tie as the second game
did. Three minutes from the end
however, a Blue and Gold player foul
ed and gave Stanford the opportunity
to win. Art Erb took the ball on the
free kick, cleverly passed to his bro
ther Bennie and the latter sent, the
sphere into the net with the winning
point.
Both teams struggled through the
first half and part of the second before
either could get the ball past the goal
keeper. California came through with
two in quick succession. After But
cher had skillfully saved a shot by Doz
ler, Thorpe, another Blue and Gold for
ward, tallied the first point of the
game. Shortly afterwards Mills, the
California captain, placed his eleven
two goals in the lead by a lucky kick.
Against a two point lead, the Cardi
nal forwards played with far better
combination than they had earlier in
the contest and kept, the Blue and Gold
goalkeeper busy. But for the excel
lent work of Barbera, Stanford would
have rolled up a much greater score.
in the first half the Cardinal players
had a slight advantage over their op
ponents. On several occasions the
men threw away what seemed to be
certain scores. Only once did the pig
skin find its way into the net. Art
Erb placed the ball between the up
rights but was off-side and the goal
was not allowed.
The game was Ihe fastest that has
been played between the two univer
sities and the result was in doubt un
til the very end. As usual Stanford's
offence was strong; but the players
are still somewhat on the defence.
The game was satisfactorily refereed
by James Wardlow.
The line-ups follow:
Stanford California
Butcher Goal Barbera
King Right full Shell
Steinhart Left full Davidson
Blodget (Cottrell) Right half Cook
Wyant Center half Miller
Price Left half Needham
Bellas (Capt.)Outside right Isaac
