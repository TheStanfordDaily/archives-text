# LAGUNITA BOATHOUSE READY FOR USE
## 
### 
With the formal acceptance of
the new Boathouse at the end
of Lagunita, the University re
ceives a long needed addition to the
athletic equipment of the major sport,
crew. For years the squad that has
worked out during the spring months
on Lagunita, in preparation for the
intercollegiate regatta, has had to be
content with the very primitive facili
ties offered at the old boathouse. Now
the candidates for the Cardinal shells
are housed in quarters that, are in
every way a credit to University ath
letics.
The new boathouse has been built
in the past month by Contractor Mills
of Palo Alto, according to the plans
and specifications drawn up by Crew
Captain Duryea, '13, and J. S. Grepe
'13. On Thursday, the structure was
formally accepted by Professor C. B.
Wing of the Engineering department,
Farm Superintendent .T. E. Hewston
and Captain Duryea. The contract
price was $1800.
Within the week the building will
receive a coat of paint, dark green,
with light green on window casings

and door frames. The roof will be red,
harmonizing in color with the tiled
roofs of the Quad. The floors will be
painted, and lockers installed in the
upper room. Benches have been made
for the balcony overlooking the lake.
The work of tearing down the old
hoathouse will begin at once, and the
next ten days will see a great change
for the better in the appearance of
Lagunita's shores.
O'Dea at Redwood
Coach O'Dea supervised the work
of two eights on the estuary at Red
wood Saturday. This was the first
time this season that more than one
shell has been on the bay water, al
though all of the varsity candidates
have been on one of the half dozen
workouts which Captain Duryea has
had at Redwood.
The Freshmen are training regular
ly at Lagunita, under the eye of Coach
O'Dea who has been visiting the cam
pus two or three times a week. With
the rapid development of form in the
candidates, he will begin daily trips
from San Francisco in the interest of
both varsity and freshmen.
