# Some Saturday!
## 
### 
Saturday was a gala day for Stan
ford in athletics. The soccer baseball

and second basketbal,l
teams each registered
victories over their op
ponents. The soccer

men are to be commended for the real
Stanford Spirit they displayed when
they changed a seemingly inevitable
defeat into victory in the last ten min
utes of play and thereby added ano
ther intercollegiate contest to Stan
ford's credit. The baseball team ac
complished a praiseworthy feat in
scoring their third successive win over
St. Mary's. For .years we have fallen
victims to the speedy Catholics in base
ball but at lust we have beaten them
at their own game. Let's take Santa
Clara into camp next and wind up the
season with two straight from Califor
nia. We're due to gather this year
and we have started right. Let's keep
it ui>.
