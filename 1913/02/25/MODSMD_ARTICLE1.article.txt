# "ON THE QUIET" COMEDY VALUES FLASH BRIGHTLY
## SCENERY FOR SOPHOMORE PLAY HAS BEEN INSTALLED. Remaining Time For Rehearsals Will Be Spent On Review of Three Acts. 
### 
Augustus Thomas' scintilating com
edy of love tangles among representa
tives of the classes of high degree in
the monied and titled spheres lias been
dressed lavishly for its production by
the Sophomore class Friday evening.
The three acts of "On The Quiet" call
for three effective sets of stage scen
ery, which have been built and install
ed in the Assembly Hall by the Tom
Crowley Company. Rehearsals
recently been held before a full back
ground of the new scenery.
The fast moving of the third act,
aboard a steam yacht at sea, has been
rehearsed to a degree of finished ex
cellence, and promises to afford many
opportunities for the cast to get its

lines and situations over with their
entire complements of amusement. The
plots of the co ;iedy are twisted into
their most fantastic forms at the close
of the second act, and a rapid tire suc
cession of explanations is necessary to
resolve heart throbs, titles, and mil
lions into a happy relationship by the
end of the last chapter of the play.
A great deal of the charm of "On The
Quiet" depends on the spontaneous
backfiring of wit, plot, and situation
which combine to send the action along
with unhampered dash.
Desirable seats for the production
are still on sale at the Hookstore.
