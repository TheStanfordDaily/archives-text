## 
### 
Stanford registered one victory and
suffered one defeat last night in the
P. A. A. Basket Pall Tournament
when Encina Team No. 1, downed the
San .Mateo Alumni by the decisive
score, 54 to IS, and Team No. 2 lost
to the fast Exposition Five, 51 to H;.
Both winning teams outclassed then
opponents from the start and it was
only a Question ol how large a score
they would chalk up against the op
posing players. For the first team
Blodget and Button were the most ef
fective tossers, the former throwing
ten goals and the latter eight. Team
1 lined-up as followsHlodget and
Wilcox, forwards; Button, center;
Reynolds and Belcher, guards.
