# CONSTRUCTION OF AGREEMENT IS STILL MOOTED QUESTION
## Interpretation of Football Rules Compact Remains Unsettled---Stanford Awaits Action of California 
### 
With the question as to the inter
pretation of the Football rules agree
ment yet undecided, just what con
struction is to be placed on the rules
is still as much unsettled as it was be
fore the meeting of the Arbitration
committee on February 13. The moot
ed point is whether or not the rules
are to hold from year to year or wheth
er it is necessary to pass upon them
each year. The discussion arose over
the recjuest of Stanford last semester
that an umpire be named for the an
nual intercollegiate rugby match.
Stanford has asked the California
executive committee what action is to
be taken in regard to the motion pass
ed by the vote of the California dele
gates at the last session of the Arbi
tration committee recommending that
the California student body abrogate
the present agreement covering foot
ball. No answer has been received to
the communication sent to Berkeley
by the Stanford executive committee.
The controversy has been dragging
since last semester and has occasioned
frequent committee meetings and pro
longed discussion. Stanford has in
terpreted the agreement to be in force
until legislation is taken to alter it.
California has insisted that the rules
hold for one year only. The discussion
in brief is given below.
T.:e Rules Committee
By the terms of the agreement be
tween the Associated Students of
Stanford and California the president
of the student body of each university
is empowered to appoint each year a
committee of three, consisting of the
captain and coach of the football team
for the ensuing year and one alumnus.
These representatives are known as
the Football Rules Committe , and by
Article I, section "112" of the agreement
"shall have power to enact, regulate,
change and interpret and publish the
rules governing football for the ensu
ing year. This committee shall meet
the first Saturday in September.
r i ho committee did not meet last
September localise neither side had
any changes to make in the rules. The
Stanford representatives were G. .1.
Presley, '07, D. W. Burbank, '09, and
Louis Cass, '13. These men believed
that the football rules were similar to
any other rules and would hold until
changed.

According to a clause in the special
amendment to the rules adopted from
the English Rugby Union with amend
ments by Stanford and California.
"The officials of the game shall be a
Referee, an Umpire, if the captain of
either team desires one; two Touch
judges, and two Time-keepers." Be
lieving it advisable to have an umpire
Captain Cass, in accordance with the
clause mentioned asked for such an
official. California refused to grant
this request on the ground that as the
committee had not met and endorsed
the special rules of the previous years
this "umpire" clause did not bind as
the amendments to the rules held to,
one year only. In view of the fact
that the two universities were able to
secure the services of W. W. Hill of
the visiting Australian team as referee,
ifi whom both teams placed such con
fidence Stanford did not insist on an
umpire. But the Stanford representa
tives did not permit this to be an
acknowledgment that the rules must
be amended each year. Referee Hill
was given the privilege of naming his
i w;, linesmen and chose Larry Dwyei
of the Waratahahs and L. S. Reading.
The A mum I Meeting
Or. January 2.') in accordance to the
terms of the agreement which is that
"There shall be an annual meeting of
threo representatives of each univer
sity held on the fourth Saturday in
January, at the Palace Hotel in San
Francisco, California and at this an
nual meeting any proposed amend
ments may be considered;" the com
mittee met in regular session. Stan
ford sent Presley, Burbank and R. W.
Barrett, '04. California's delegates
were Grimes, Donald and Judge Ev
erett Brown. No decision could be
reached at this meeting. Stanford
contended that the rules remained in
force until changed while California
held that the entire set of rules had to
be reenacted each year. Judge Brown
voted that the rules did not hold but
later explained bis vote in a manner
to indicate that he was voting thusly
on the grounds of his being a Califor
nia representative with the sentiment
of the student body against the rules
holding. His general opinion was that
such an interpretation would however
not hold in any court. Presidents A.
W. Ambrose, '13, and C. M. Torrey,
'13, of the rival student bodies were
also in attendance at the meeting.
Since the committee was unable to
agree an Arbitration committee was
named to attempt to adjust the differ
ence. 1). M. Polsom, '02, James Lana
gan, '00 and W. P. Fuller, '10 were
chosen as Stanford's representatives.
Califc rnia sent. GrifHths, Farmer and
Plileger. After a protracted discus
sion this committee was also unable
to cri.ne to a decision on the football
nil v. The California delegates fav
ored recommendation to the execu
tive co-r-'itto?:: t 112 bot.i student bodie
that they abrogate the present agree
ment and make a new one. This was
lu: t by a tie v< te, Stanford against
aid California favoring. California
then favored a motion that tho coni
n itte ■ rccommend that the California
►student )•( dy abrogate section 1. 112. of
article I of the present agreement.
The fc .112 ud delegates refrained from
voting as they considered the matter
to be purely one for the California
student body to decide. This motion
was carried by a two to one vote of
the California delegates, Farmer vot
ing against.
Propositi! Rejected
A proposal was made that a commit
tee of fifteen rugby experts be named
to draw up new rules. This was not
favored on the grounds that it was
not necessary to make a new code of
rules. Stanford proposed that three
easterners not acquainted with the
affairs under discussion be named as
an arbitration committee to decide
whether the rules hold or not. Cali
fornia was willing to accept this sug
gestion if she could reserve the right
to reject any clause which the corn
'vitfee derided upon. Another con
troversy would probably result in such
a case and the arbitration would be
for naught. The arbitration committee
then voted to notify the resepective
student bodies that an agreement
could not be reached and asking that
the committee be discharged. Thus |
the matter is yet unsettled and the
answer of the California executive
committee is being awaited by the
Stanford committee.
