# Convicts Enrolled in College.
## 
### 
Another important step was taken
toward prison reform when fifty con
victs were permitted to enroll in the
Kansas Agricultural College. The
prisoners do their work in the prison
at Leavenworth and send their lessons
by mail to the college for correction.
This idea of giving the convicts an op
â– porti.init:' for education originated
with some of the professors, who, when
visiting: the prison, learned that many
of the men were desirous of obtaining
a college education.
