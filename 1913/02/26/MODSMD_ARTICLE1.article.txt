# DRESS REHEARSAL IS HELD ON THE QUIET
## GOOD WORK IS PROMISED FOR CLEVER COMEDY. Sophomore Actors Ready for Finished Performance. Members Promise Good Work in Clever Comedy. 
### 
Tonight for the last time the cast of
"On The Quiet" will go through their
lines without the inspiration of an
audience across the footlights. The
dress rehearsal of the clever Sopho
more comedy will be complete in cos
tume and scenery, and only the final
touches will need to be added before
the evening of February 28.
"On The Quiet" is a drama of dol
lars, dukes and dilemmas—one big
laugh succeeds another, as situations
pile up with bewildering rapidity. An
apparently incongruous assortment of
millionaires, ministers, college boys,
titles and chorus girls form a unique
plot which culminates in an uproarious
denouement, as the yacht "Coryphee"
seta sail in act three on a honeymoon
tour, with all hands on deck.
Some of the Sophomore stars are al
ready familiar to Stanford audiences;
others are hitherto undiscovered lights.
Martin Allen, in the role of Robert
Ridgeway, the seventy horse-power
hero, is a whole show in himself. The
first appearance of Miss Dorothy Coop
er as the beautiful heiress to twenty
millions, is sure to be effective as it is
artistic. The character parts are well
sustained, and Boomer Forbes as the
Duke of Carbondale, is as humorously
British as an edition of "Punch." .T. A.
Paul, as McGeachey, a bookmaker, and
E. A. Haggart as a divine, are both sure
to create laughter. Miss Elizabeth
Taff is already known as an unus
ually attractive and gifted little in
genue, a reputation which will not
suffer in her appearance as Phoebe
Ridgeway, with W. W. Thoburn to play
opposite her as Clyde Ogden, college
queener. The rest of the cast are like
wise instrumental in the successful
production of this snappy play, which
judging by the seat sale, will be wit
nessed by a heavy representation of
"queeners" and "roughs."
