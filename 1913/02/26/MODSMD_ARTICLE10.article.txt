# CLOSE GAME IS VICTORY OVER SANTA CLARA
## IMPRESSIONS OF EVENT GIVEN BY STAFF SOB SISTERS. Noble Captain Terry Wins Admiration of Throng of Bleacher Fans. 
### 
Ah!! Captain Terry strode up to the
plate. "Last year," said he,"I was the
only man to get a good write-up in the
Pink Sheet. There's class to nie, all
right." And on the strength of that
he let the ball bump right into him
and walked to first.
"Argy" came next. He was bound
and determined to sacrifice (you all
know what a generous disposition he
has) but it didn't work very well and
he fixed it so he didn't do anyone any
good.
Tom Workman gave the visitors a
treat by appearing in his delectable
striped "pantaloons" (French name
for pants) that the invincible Giants
wear while visiting. To quote Tom,
these very ones "have rubbed up
against Christy Mathewson." Just
think!
Babe Dent was the next batter up.
He pops flies almost as well as he
catches them when he gets his little
mask on and looks through the bars.
Heine Beeger sneaked up to the
plate and waved his bat at the um
pire as a signal that he was ready
to have the game begin. Once when
he was sending a message out to the
Santa Clara center he happened to hit
the ball. One of the other team
caught it though and spoiled his nice
play.
Louie Cass was the next victim. You
all know that awfully tall, thin,
straight-legged ball (and incidentally
heart) smasher. He swung around
and around and finally hit the ball,
but he didn't get far —not even to first.
Pete McCloskey certainly shows his
Junior Opera chorus training. He
sashays around the plate as though
he were doing the butter-fly dance.
The way he went to first looked like
the baseball march with an orchestra
accompaniment.
That cute little Mr. McNeely was
next. He was so busy ragging that he
forgot to try tb hit the ball and the
umpire finally told him to go and sit
down.
"Al" Gragg had an awful time try
ing to bat. He just couldn't do the
work. When he was pitching, though,
he certainly did things. Why, even
Ireland says that "he's the best pitch
er in the league—socially." The most
fun he had today was playing catch
w'th Tom on first, but never caught a
man—only the ball.
The umpire wasn't too good. He
hardly put any expression into his
lines and once he called strike when
Zeb didn't teven lift his bat.
Stanford—Terry, short; Argabrite,
left; Dent, catcher; Beeger, right;
Cass, center; McCJoskey, third; Mc-
Neely, second; Gragg, Pitcher.
Santa Clara—Milbourn, center; Zar
ick, second; Tramatula, short; Ybar
by Coach O'foea and the committee.
These changes have been instituted to
make the long training less severe
than it has formerly been for the crew
aspirants.
The rowing machines, which have
been ordered from A1 Rogers in Ala
meda, will be delivered within the
week and will complete the equipment
for the new boathouse.
