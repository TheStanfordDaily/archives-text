family can spare, while the men, sole
victims of the local reform, appear in
brown shoes and informal attire. Now
is a good time to carry out the spirit
of the first campus dance with appro
priate simplicity and note the increas
ed attendance at about eighteen or
twenty of these affairs each semester.
On the Quad there is the eternal
fashion show .velvets and varied degrees
of decollete putting the old trust
worthy roughneck sweaters iji the
shade.
This incongruity of taste can be eas

dances of the future saner and more
really enjoyable functions.
Anyway we are too near a metropo
