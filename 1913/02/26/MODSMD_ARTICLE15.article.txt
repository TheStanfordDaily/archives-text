# TENNIS PLAYERS WILL MEET BERKELEY STARS.
## Women Nearing Finals in Matches to Select Trio of Champions. 
### 
Play in the Tennis Tournament to
select the women to represent Stan
ford against California on April 19, is
rapidly being completed and competi
tion among the players has reached a
keen point. Places on the representa
tive trio have been practically con
ceded to Captain L. Herron, M. Lowell,
and E. Parker, these three having
shown championship play throughout
the tourney. An unusually good sec
ond string is competing for the two
remaining positions, honors
about equally divided between J.
Waud, A. Wells, M. Lockwood, I. Tal
boy, 11. Batcheller, and P. McCarthy.
More spirit has been shown during the
present season among women tennis
enthusiasts than in years past, and
constant practice on the Roble, En
cina or Peninsula courts is steadily
improving the game of the players.
The first three rounds of the Tennis
Club tournament have been finished,
Wells, J. Waud, M. Lowell, E. Parker,
M. Lockwood, L. Herron and I. Talboy.
Miss Lowell drew in an easy half and
should easily reach the finals, while
Captain Herron has the moie difficult
task of disposing of Miss Parker in
order to be in the final running.
During Easter vacation :â–  tourna
ment with IT.S.C. will be held, and in
the near future the Ladies Park Club
of San Francisco will enter a contest
on the local courts. A second team,
picked at the time of the California
games, will also be provided with op
ponents from among the Peninsula
players.
