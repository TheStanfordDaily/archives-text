# Dr. Jordan Talks on Work in Eugenics
## 
### 
Discussing the subject of Eugenics
from a scientific and practical view
point, Doctor Jordan spoke last even
ing in the chapel under the auspices of
the Philosophy Club. The lecturer ex
plained a number of scientific experi
ments which have been conducted
along this line, and outlined further
work now being advocated, taking oc
casion to deny the charge that the
study of Eugenics would result in
merely a scheme of government.
