## 
### 
A triangular track meet has been ar
ranged for the afternoon of March
fifteenth, in which Stanford will fight
it out with St. Mary's and Palo Alto
High.
As it will be impossible for Captain
Campbell to take but. a small part of
the season's squad to Los Angeles for
the meet with U.S.C., much good ma
terial will be left on I lie campus and
ihe local meet should furnish keen
competition.
