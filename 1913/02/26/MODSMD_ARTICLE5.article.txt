# FRESHMAN OARSMEN TRAIN AT REDWOOD WITH VARSITY SQUAD.
## 
### 
This week has inaugurated freshman
crew work at Redwood. Previously all
Freshmen have been training regular
ly on Lagunita under the direction
of Coach O'Dea. but now two men are
taken daily to row with the varsity
candidates in the eight. In this way a
full squad can be kept working on the
lake, and at the same time the Fresh
men gain experience from the veteran
oarsmen.
Facilities for work at Redwood will
be increased by the arrival of the oars
for the new shell. These are to be de
livered in the course of two weeks
and will make it possible for three
eights to be put on the water at one
time.
Permission has been obtained from
the Frank Tannery to install showers
at the boathouse at Redwood, using the
tannery's tanks for water supply. The
coaching launch has also been put in
to commission and will soon be in use

This week has inaugurated freshman
crew work at Redwood. Previously all
Freshmen have been training regular
ly on Lagunita under the direction
of Coach O'Dea. but now two men are
taken daily to row with the varsity
candidates in the eight. In this way a
full squad can be kept working on the
lake, and at the same time the Fresh
men gain experience from the veteran
oarsmen.
Facilities for work at Redwood will
be increased by the arrival of the oars
for the new shell. These are to be de
livered in the course of two weeks
and will make it possible for three
eights to be put on the water at one
time.
Permission has been obtained from
the Frank Tannery to install showers
at the boathouse at Redwood, using the
tannery's tanks for water supply. The
coaching launch has also been put in
to commission and will soon be in use
