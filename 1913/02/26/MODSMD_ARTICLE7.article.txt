# COEDUCATION APPEALS TO "DUFFY" LEWIS.
## Rod Sox Player Sends Swift Line of Talk For Home Run. 
### 
"Duffy" Lewis, the old Red Sox out-*
fielder, came through beautiiully
this afternoon with his ideas on coed
ucation. His countenance was suf
fused with the pink that makes this
sheet famous, hut he looked the lady
interviewer straight in the eye and
when he once got under way showed
what he could do in a pinch.
"On coeducation? Say, does that
mean a peg to home or a 'popped fly?'
I'll have to turn around to the bleach
ers and 'look 'em over' right now, I
guess. Some of these little ladies are
certainly 'Rig League, Class double A*
and what gets me is how some of these
'Hush Leaguers' in cords 'steal home.'
Why it would be coeducation for me
'all the time' if 1 thought there was
even a chance of 'getting on' with some
of the coeds that live up to the five
hundred limit by a five hundred bat
ting average. They look as though
they could 'hit the ball a mile' too, and
as for 'speed' they're there a million.
Say, the man who invented coeduca
tion was 'on his toes' and I'd take a
chance and say he looked ahead and
saw a lot of 'squeeze plays' and 'home
runs.' Myself I've been making single
plays for some time and I've just about
decided to 'try a double.' "
