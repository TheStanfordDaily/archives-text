After weeks of endeavor to peace
ably arbitrate the dispute that has
arisen over the interpretation of the
football rules the action taken last
evening by the Executive Committee
was the only course for Stanford to
pursue after the ultimatum which was
delivered by the representatives of
California. To any fair-minded person
the facts speak for themselves.
According to the article in the
Agreement that was abrogated by Cali
fornia, "the Football Ilules Committee
shall have power to enact, regulate,
change, and interpret and publish the
rules governing football for the ensu
ing year. This committee shall meet
the first Saturday in September." This
agreement was entered into by tbe As
sociated Students of Stanford and Cali
fornia in January 1910. In September
of 1910, acting under the agreement
the football rules committee met and
enacted the rules governing football.
Tn 1911 the same committee met and
made slight changes and additions to
the rules but there was no motion
made to the effect that the rules as
then in force should be reenacted, it
being taken for granted by both sides
that they would continue in force un
til changed. In 1912 as neither side
had any changes to propose or addi
tions to make, the committee did not
even meet, again indicating the opinion
that the rules continued as before.
California made no objections nor did
they raise the point that they later
brought up.
There is a section in the football
rules as they existed and were played
under, providing that at the request of
either captain, an umpire may be chos
en to assist (lie referee. Prior to the
Hig Game last year and in accordance
with the rules as they were accepted
by California, Captain Cass requested
that an umpire be appointed. Califo.
nia objected. But owing to the fact
that such a competent official as W. W.
Hill was chosen to referee Stanford
did not press her point as she might
have done.
The Big Game was played. The
rules governing the contest were the
same as those adopted in 1910 and not
reenacted in either 1911 or 1912, both
universities conceding them to be in
force. California, not desiring to have
un umpire in future contests as is
provided in the rules but not being
able to give any valid reason why
there should not be such an official
and doubting that they would be able
to change the rules on that point, came
forth with the statement that there

were no rules after having played un
der the rules for three years. Thus
they violate all prevailing customs
that exist in regard to rules on any
subject in any place and in direct con
tradiction to their own acts in regard
to this particular subject.
At the annual meeting of the Inter
collegiate Agreement Committee in
January last, the California repre
sentatives raised the point at issue.
A vote was taken and the result was a
tie. The three Stanford representa
tives upheld the rules as interpreted
by Stanford and California in the past
and according to the established cus
tom. The California representatives
voted solid against the customary in
terpretation but one of their number,
Judge Brown, a fair-minded jurist,
explained his vote solely on the
grounds that he was acting as Cali
fornia's representative and must up
hold their contention, at the same time
expressing his opinion that California's
argument would not be countenanced
by any court. Not being able to reach
a decision, Ibis committee advised the
appointment of an arbitration commit
tee. Representatives to this latter
body were appointed by the respective
Student Body Presidents and met in
San Francisco February 15. Again
there was a deadlock. At this meet
ing the Stanford representatives offer
ed to submit the bare facts to any three
judges in the State of California or
to any three Eastern football authori
ties, uninterested in either University
and abide by their decision. But what
did California do.' They refused point
blank <o arbitrate unless they should
have the power to reject any decision
oi such a hoard. In other words, un
less the matter was decided in Califor
nia's favor they would not accept. It
was then moved and passed by a vote
of two to one of the California repre
sentatives that the University of Cali
fornia Student Body abrogate the dis
puted section. This was but a con
sistent step in California's dictatorial
policy.
Unable to gain a decision in the
Agreement Committee or in the Arbi
tration Committee and unwilling to
place the matter before an unprejud
iced board they abrogate the section.
This means that if Stanford accepted
the abrogation of that one section that
new rules would have to be adopted
and such could not happen until Stan
ford would consent to California's
views for it takes a majority to pass
a rule in the committee. Thus would
California gain her point!
From these facts it is evident that
California is willing to abide by the
terms of the agreement until the terms
are sought to be utilized. Then if the
terms which they have accepted don't
strike their fancy they dictate new
terms which do! Such arbitrary ac
tion cannot and will not he tolerated.
Stanford is only standing up for her
rights. We have been willing to ar
bitrate any and all disputes.
nia has refused unless they are al
lowed to reserve a complete veto of
the decision of any arbitration board!
There was only one course open to
the Executive Committee and they took
it. Upon these facts Stanford rests
her case.
