# SIXTEEN STANFORD SONGS SET TO MUSIC.
## 
### 
Musicians who play by note instead
of by ear will have a chance to show
their college spirit. Cap and Gown
is gathering together a collection of
Cardinal choruses never before pub
lished with the music. The favorite
rally and bleacher songs set in four
part harmony will be included in this
much needed addition to Stanford pub
lications. Fifty cents is the price re
quired, and the chairman ol' the com
mittee in charge, Miss R. Seeley, '13,
announces that the hooks will be
ready for sale before spring vacation.
