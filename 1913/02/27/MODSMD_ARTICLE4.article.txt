# STANFORD ABROGATES FOOTBALL AGREEMENT WITH CALIFORNIA
## Dispute Over the Interpretation of Rules Culminates in Action of Executive Committee. 
### 
The following resolution was unanimously adopted by the Executive
Committee, all voting:
WHEREAS: sub-division fof Section 1. Article I of the Intercolleg
iate Agreement relating to the powers and duties of the football rules
committee has been the subject of disagreement and arbitration be
tween the Universities of California and Stanford; and
>YHEREAS:by peremptorily abrogating the above provisions of the
Agreement, California has placed the matter beyond further arbitration
and taken an attitude inimical to a fair consideration of the question;
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED:
That this Committee, acting by virtue of the power given by Sec
tion 2, Article IV of the said Agreement, does hereby abrogate all of
section 1, article 1 of the Agreement, and directs that the requisite no
tice of this action be given the Associated Students of the University
of California.

The above action of the Executive
Committee taken last evening resulted
from the arbitrary conduct of Califor
nia in regard to the interpretation of
the agreement heretofore in force,
and was the only possible move under
the existing circumstances. res
olution means that all football rela
tions with California are severed.
Had Stanford accepted the action of
the California executive committee it
would have left the universities
with no football rules for next year
except the plain Rugby code and with
no measures for adopting any rules as
the clause abrogated dealt with the
means by which rules are enacted.
This would necessitate a readoption
of that portion of the Intercollegiate
Agreement before the next big game.
Since such adoption would have to
come by a majority vote of the Inter
collegiate Agreement Committee it is
evident that no prevision with regard
to the football rules could be adopted
except one entirely in accordance with
California's ideas.

Gentlemen:
The Executive Committee of the As
sociated Students of the University of
California, acting upon the recommen
dation «i' the arbitration committee
which met February l.» to interpret
\rtiele I. section !, subsection (112), in
regard to the powers of the Football
Wales Committee, and for the purpose
(if obtaining in the shortest time pos
sible a solution to the deadlock now
tufting place i;i this arbitration com
mittee and in the Intercollegiate Agree
ment Committee, hereby gives notice
to you that it abrogates the sentence
in subsection (a), of Article I, section
I,rending "The rules shall be such as
are laid down by the Rules Committee
hereinafter described in this article,"

and subsection (112) of section 1, Ar
ticle I, reading, "The President of the
Associated Students of each Univer
sity shall appoint a committee of three,
consisting of the captain and the coach
of the football team for the ensuing
year, and one alumnus. These repre
sentatives shall he known as the Foot
ball Rules Committee, and shall have
power to enact, regulate, change, and
interpret and publish the rules govern
ing football for the ensuing year.
This committee shall meet the tirsl
Saturday i<i September."
The Executive Committee of the A.
S. I. in abrogating these portions
of its agreement with the students of
the Lclaird Stanford Junior University
is using that power vested in it by sec
tion 2, Article IV of that same agree
ment.
Respectfully,
11. P. Nachtrieb,
Secretary.
The discussion which terminated in
the resolution of last evening began
last, semester. The main point of con
tention was the question of the mean
ing to he placed on the rules. It is
this matter of adopting rules for the
big game which has been the subject
of disputed construction. Neither the
Intercollegiate Agreement Committee
nor the special Arbitration Committee
could agree upon the interpretation of
the disputed point.
(*ives Power to Abrogate
'the abrogation of the agreement is
made in pursuance of the clause in the
Agreement which provided that the
whole or any portion of it may he
terminated by either University by
giving three months notice in writing
to (lie Executive Committee of each.
By the resolution enacted after a
careful consideration of the entire mat
ter the Executive Committee abrogates
section I, Article I of the Intercolleg
iate Agreement which relates to foot
ball. This was necessitated by the ac
tion of the Executive Committee of the
California student body in abrogating
the sentence in subsection (a) of Ar
ticle I, section I, reading "The rules
shall be such as are laid down by the
Rules Committee hereinafter described
in this article," and subsection (112) of
section I, Article I. That clause reads
as follows:
"The President of the Associated Stu
dents of each university shall appoint
a committee of three, consisting of the
captain and coach of the football team
frr the ensuing year, and one alumnus.
These representatives shall be known
as the Football Rules Committee and
shall have power to enact, regulate,
change, and interpret and publish the
rules governing football for the ensu
ing year. This committee shall meet
the first Saturday in September."
California Raises Objections
The rules were perfectly satisfac
tory up to the time that some particu
lar rule did not suit California. Then
an objection was raised to the rules
by California who held that they were
vague and that the Football rules held
for the ensuing year only. It is fur
ther a significant fact that the Foot
ball Rules Committee has not for the
past three years at any of its meetings
passed a resolution adopting the rules
of previous years. But on the other
hand the Rules committee has as
sumed that these rules held as any
rules have held until revised or
changed. This has been Stanford's
contention throughout the discussion.
By indirect move California placed
Stanford in the position of doing one
of two things—either acceding to her
interpretation and ideas or playing a
big game without football rules other
than the plain Ru-by code. This lat
ter course does not seem to be a prac
ticable one in as much as it has been
found necessary during the entire
course of intercollegiate Rugby play
ing to draw up certain agreed inter
pretations of Rugby rules and to add
certain amendments to those which
our peculiar situation has found nec
essary.
The following resolution was unanimously adopted by the Executive
Committee, all voting:

Gentlemen:
The Executive Committee of the As

California, acting upon the recommen
dation «i' the arbitration committee
which met February l.» to interpret
\rtiele I. section !, subsection (112), in
regard to the powers of the Football
Wales Committee, and for the purpose
(if obtaining in the shortest time pos
sible a solution to the deadlock now
tufting place i;i this arbitration com
mittee and in the Intercollegiate Agree
ment Committee, hereby gives notice
to you that it abrogates the sentence
in subsection (a), of Article I, section
I,rending "The rules shall be such as
are laid down by the Rules Committee
hereinafter described in this article,"

and subsection (112) of section 1, Ar
ticle I, reading, "The President of the
Associated Students of each Univer
sity shall appoint a committee of three,
consisting of the captain and the coach
of the football team for the ensuing
year, and one alumnus. These repre
sentatives shall he known as the Foot
ball Rules Committee, and shall have
power to enact, regulate, change, and
interpret and publish the rules govern
ing football for the ensuing year.
This committee shall meet the tirsl
Saturday i<i September."
The Executive Committee of the A.
S. I. in abrogating these portions
of its agreement with the students of
the Lclaird Stanford Junior University
is using that power vested in it by sec
tion 2, Article IV of that same agree
ment.
Respectfully,
11. P. Nachtrieb,
Secretary.
The discussion which terminated in
the resolution of last evening began
last, semester. The main point of con
tention was the question of the mean
ing to he placed on the rules. It is
this matter of adopting rules for the
big game which has been the subject
of disputed construction. Neither the
Intercollegiate Agreement Committee
nor the special Arbitration Committee
could agree upon the interpretation of
the disputed point.
(*ives Power to Abrogate
'the abrogation of the agreement is
made in pursuance of the clause in the
Agreement which provided that the
whole or any portion of it may he
terminated by either University by
giving three months notice in writing
to (lie Executive Committee of each.
By the resolution enacted after a
careful consideration of the entire mat
ter the Executive Committee abrogates
section I, Article I of the Intercolleg
iate Agreement which relates to foot
ball. This was necessitated by the ac
tion of the Executive Committee of the
California student body in abrogating
the sentence in subsection (a) of Ar
ticle I, section I, reading "The rules
shall be such as are laid down by the
Rules Committee hereinafter described
in this article," and subsection (112) of
section I, Article I. That clause reads
as follows:
"The President of the Associated Stu
dents of each university shall appoint
a committee of three, consisting of the
captain and coach of the football team
frr the ensuing year, and one alumnus.
These representatives shall be known
as the Football Rules Committee and
shall have power to enact, regulate,
change, and interpret and publish the
rules governing football for the ensu
ing year. This committee shall meet
the first Saturday in September."
California Raises Objections
The rules were perfectly satisfac
tory up to the time that some particu
lar rule did not suit California. Then
an objection was raised to the rules
by California who held that they were
vague and that the Football rules held
for the ensuing year only. It is fur
ther a significant fact that the Foot
ball Rules Committee has not for the
past three years at any of its meetings
passed a resolution adopting the rules
of previous years. But on the other
hand the Rules committee has as
sumed that these rules held as any
rules have held until revised or
changed. This has been Stanford's
contention throughout the discussion.
By indirect move California placed
Stanford in the position of doing one
of two things—either acceding to her
interpretation and ideas or playing a
big game without football rules other
than the plain Ru-by code. This lat
ter course does not seem to be a prac
ticable one in as much as it has been
found necessary during the entire
course of intercollegiate Rugby play
ing to draw up certain agreed inter
pretations of Rugby rules and to add
certain amendments to those which
our peculiar situation has found nec
essary.
The following resolution was unanimously adopted by the Executive
Committee, all voting:
WHEREAS: sub-division fof Section 1. Article I of the Intercolleg
iate Agreement relating to the powers and duties of the football rules
committee has been the subject of disagreement and arbitration be
tween the Universities of California and Stanford; and

and taken an attitude inimical to a fair consideration of the question;
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED:
That this Committee, acting by virtue of the power given by Sec
tion 2, Article IV of the said Agreement, does hereby abrogate all of
section 1, article 1 of the Agreement, and directs that the requisite no
tice of this action be given the Associated Students of the University
of California.

The above action of the Executive
Committee taken last evening resulted
from the arbitrary conduct of Califor
nia in regard to the interpretation of
the agreement heretofore in force,
and was the only possible move under
the existing circumstances. res
olution means that all football rela
tions with California are severed.
Had Stanford accepted the action of
the California executive committee it
would have left the universities
with no football rules for next year
except the plain Rugby code and with
no measures for adopting any rules as
the clause abrogated dealt with the
means by which rules are enacted.
This would necessitate a readoption
of that portion of the Intercollegiate
Agreement before the next big game.
Since such adoption would have to
come by a majority vote of the Inter
collegiate Agreement Committee it is
evident that no prevision with regard
to the football rules could be adopted
except one entirely in accordance with
California's ideas.

Gentlemen:
The Executive Committee of the As
sociated Students of the University of
California, acting upon the recommen
dation «i' the arbitration committee
which met February l.» to interpret
\rtiele I. section !, subsection (112), in
regard to the powers of the Football
Wales Committee, and for the purpose
(if obtaining in the shortest time pos
sible a solution to the deadlock now
tufting place i;i this arbitration com
mittee and in the Intercollegiate Agree
ment Committee, hereby gives notice
to you that it abrogates the sentence
in subsection (a), of Article I, section
I,rending "The rules shall be such as
are laid down by the Rules Committee
hereinafter described in this article,"

and subsection (112) of section 1, Ar
ticle I, reading, "The President of the
Associated Students of each Univer
sity shall appoint a committee of three,
consisting of the captain and the coach
of the football team for the ensuing
year, and one alumnus. These repre
sentatives shall he known as the Foot
ball Rules Committee, and shall have
power to enact, regulate, change, and
interpret and publish the rules govern
ing football for the ensuing year.
This committee shall meet the tirsl
Saturday i<i September."
The Executive Committee of the A.
S. I. in abrogating these portions
of its agreement with the students of
the Lclaird Stanford Junior University
is using that power vested in it by sec
tion 2, Article IV of that same agree
ment.
Respectfully,
11. P. Nachtrieb,
Secretary.
The discussion which terminated in
the resolution of last evening began
last, semester. The main point of con
tention was the question of the mean
ing to he placed on the rules. It is
this matter of adopting rules for the
big game which has been the subject
of disputed construction. Neither the
Intercollegiate Agreement Committee
nor the special Arbitration Committee
could agree upon the interpretation of
the disputed point.
(*ives Power to Abrogate
'the abrogation of the agreement is
made in pursuance of the clause in the
Agreement which provided that the
whole or any portion of it may he
terminated by either University by
giving three months notice in writing
to (lie Executive Committee of each.
By the resolution enacted after a
careful consideration of the entire mat
ter the Executive Committee abrogates
section I, Article I of the Intercolleg
iate Agreement which relates to foot
ball. This was necessitated by the ac
tion of the Executive Committee of the
California student body in abrogating
the sentence in subsection (a) of Ar
ticle I, section I, reading "The rules
shall be such as are laid down by the
Rules Committee hereinafter described
in this article," and subsection (112) of
section I, Article I. That clause reads
as follows:
"The President of the Associated Stu
dents of each university shall appoint
a committee of three, consisting of the
captain and coach of the football team
frr the ensuing year, and one alumnus.
These representatives shall be known
as the Football Rules Committee and
shall have power to enact, regulate,
change, and interpret and publish the
rules governing football for the ensu
ing year. This committee shall meet
the first Saturday in September."
California Raises Objections
The rules were perfectly satisfac
tory up to the time that some particu
lar rule did not suit California. Then
an objection was raised to the rules
by California who held that they were
vague and that the Football rules held
for the ensuing year only. It is fur
ther a significant fact that the Foot
ball Rules Committee has not for the
past three years at any of its meetings
passed a resolution adopting the rules
of previous years. But on the other
hand the Rules committee has as
sumed that these rules held as any
rules have held until revised or
changed. This has been Stanford's
contention throughout the discussion.
By indirect move California placed
Stanford in the position of doing one
of two things—either acceding to her
interpretation and ideas or playing a
big game without football rules other
than the plain Ru-by code. This lat
ter course does not seem to be a prac
ticable one in as much as it has been
found necessary during the entire
course of intercollegiate Rugby play
ing to draw up certain agreed inter
pretations of Rugby rules and to add
certain amendments to those which
our peculiar situation has found nec
essary.
The following resolution was unanimously adopted by the Executive
Committee, all voting:
WHEREAS: sub-division fof Section 1. Article I of the Intercolleg
iate Agreement relating to the powers and duties of the football rules
committee has been the subject of disagreement and arbitration be
tween the Universities of California and Stanford; and
>YHEREAS:by peremptorily abrogating the above provisions of the
Agreement, California has placed the matter beyond further arbitration
and taken an attitude inimical to a fair consideration of the question;
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED:
That this Committee, acting by virtue of the power given by Sec
