The small blaze that occurred at 13
Lasuen yesterday calls attention to

the inadequacy of the fire pro
tection here on the campus.
At the time the alarm was

turned in there was no one near the
firehouse. It was not until the stu
dents from the Quad came tearing up
Salvatierra en route to the scene of
the fire that enough persons could be
secured to man the hose cart. Luckily
the blaze was discovered in time so
that it could be extinguished by a gar
den hose. Had it gotten a fair start it
could never have been stopped after
the fire fighters arrived.
There is not a great deal of danger
from fires on the campus but then
there is always a chance of one start
ing. And it is just such chances that
we should guard against. If a fire
should once get under way our present
equipment would be useless. Condi
tions on the campus do not demand
that a first class force of fire fighters
be maintained but there should tie
modern apparatus at hand capable of
extinguishing an ordinary fire and
some means provided to get that ap
paratus on the scene within a reason
aide time after the alarm is sounded.
