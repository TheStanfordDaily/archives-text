# C.F. ELWELL, '07, PLANS BIG WIRELESS STATION
## POST WILL BE SITUATED ON PANAMA CANAL Electrical Engineering Graduate in Washington to Negotiate Contract With United States Government 
### 
C. F. Elwell, '07, a prominent elec
trical engineering graduate, is at pres
ent negotiating a contract with the
United States Government at Wash
ington for a record breaking wireless,
station. The station is to he situated
at the Colon entrance ol" the Panama
Canal and is to be a precautionai.
measure to provide for the transmis
sion of news and dispatches in case of
the interruption of the other news
bearing channels by the enemy in
time of war.
The contract was won by Elwell for
the Federal Wireless Company, of
which he is Chief Engineer, by a re
markable demonstration of his system.
At this time he exchanged messages
with Honolulu, a distance of 3,000
miles over land and 2,000 miles over
water, partly by day, an extraordinary
achievement. Elwell recently gave a
Poulsen five kilowatt high frequency
generator to the Electrical Engineer
ing department with which an investi
gation is being made upon the causes
of insulator failures on modern high
voltage transmission lines. The re
sults from experiments already made
show that high voltage when applied
to line insulators at 100,000 alternations
per second produce injuries similar to
those that have caused much trouble
on modern transmission lines which
could not be accounted for by any
means heretofore available.
Elwell negotiated himself the rights
of the Poulsen system of undamped
electric waves for radio electric work
in 1009 and has surprised the world by
his enterprise and energy in reducing
that system to a practical basis.
