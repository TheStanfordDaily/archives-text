# UNIVERSITY DANCE TOMORROW PROMISES TO BE BIG SUCCESS.
## 
### 
A three piece orchestra, piano, vio
lin, and drums, will play the latest
musical hits at the University Dance
which will be held at the Palo Alto
armory tomorrow night under the aus
pices of the Senior Class.
The order of dances will include 16
regular numbers and two extras. The
eighth to the thirteenth dances have
been reserved for supper. Those who
have not procured their tickets can
obtain them at the Bookstore for the
sum of $1.
Patrons should sign up the charts
at the Bookstore for the dance which
they have reserved for supper. The
dances that have been set aside for this
purpose will be lengthened so that but
one will be necessary for obtaining re
freshments. Programs can be secured
at the Bookstore until 5 o'clock to
morrow.
Ogier will do the catering and has
promised something new that will
catch the fancy of the patrons.
