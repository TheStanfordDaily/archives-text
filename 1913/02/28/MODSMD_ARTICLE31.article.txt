"Record Breaking Engineering Pro
jects of the West" was the subject of
the address by Professor Robert Sib
ley, head of the mechanical engineer
ing department at the University of
California, given this morning before
the engineering classes. The speaker
is also editor of the "Journal of Elec
tricity, Power and Gas," and is a for
mer graduate of California. The lec
ture was illustrated by a remarkable
collection of lantern slides which be
has collected himself while inspecting
the different projects.
In his lecture he reviewed the Roos
evelt Dam project, the Los Angeles
Aqueduct, the Hetch Hetchy water sun
ply system, and detailed the steam tur
bine "stand-by" power stations for
compensating irregularities $>112 hydio
electric power supply. Sibley brought
out the fact that on the Pacific Coast
are being established the greatest ag
gregation of engineering projects in
