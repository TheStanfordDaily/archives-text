### 
A change in the baseball schedule
was made today which will effect to
morrow's play, the varsity going to
Santa Clara and the second team play
ing Presley's All-Stars here. This sud
den shifting of the Varsity to Santa
Clara and the substitution of the sec
ond team against the All-Stars was
necessitated at the last moment and
fortunately is acceptable to all three
nines.
The Varsity will take the field
against the neighboring team in some
what different form than usual. Cass,
second baseman in last year's Varsit>,
will be stationed at that bag tomorrow
for the first time this season and be
given a thorough trial at his old place.
This combination, Terry and Cass
proved a fast and good one last year.
Workman will play first tomorrow,
while Day will be given a trial at
third. Day has played in the outfield
in some of the games this year.
Argabrite will play in left, whi
Spaulding, a new candidate, will be
tried in center. Beeger and Noonan
will change places in right. Halm and
Maple are to be the pitchers while
Dent will catch. .Tack will accompany
the team as utility man.
Hayes will pitch for the second team
tomorrow with Simpson and Hurley
catching. O'Neil will play first, Mc-
Neely, second, Wynne, short, and Mc-
Closkey, third. Childs, Dooling and
Worthy will play in the outfield.
Presley has written that he has
gathered a star team that promises to
give the Varsity a close contest. Sev
eral leaguers will be scheduled in the
line-up besides the regular old time
college players.
The Stanford band will play at to
morrow's game. Regular admissions
of twenty-five cents or season tickets
