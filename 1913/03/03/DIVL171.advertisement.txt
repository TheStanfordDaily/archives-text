There is hardly a day in the
year in this climate hut that
there is use for an overcoat if it
is of the proper weight.
We make great effort to have
a large stock of such overcoats
of fabrics not too heavy for
warm weather and warm enough
for as cold as we have it.
Needless to say, all are in per
feet style and beautifully tail
ored.
