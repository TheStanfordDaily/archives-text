# MAPLE PITCHES NO-HIT GAME AT SANTA CLARA
## STANFORD PITCHER PERFORMS REMARKABLE FEAT. Second Defeat of Year is Handed to Missionites On Their Home Grounds. 
### 
Ray Maple pitched a no-hit game
against Santa Clara on Saturday, a
feat that has not been accomplished
by a Stanford pitcher for many years.
And while he was doing this, the Var
sity clouted the ball seven times for
as many runs and won their second
game from the Mission team 7 to 2.
Maple was complete master of the
day, retiring the Catholic players in
one, two, three order in five innings.
In the third frame three thrown balls
were enough to send them back to the
field. The two runs scored off his de
livery were aided by errors and in
field outs, and started with bases on
balls.
The Stanford team hit when it meant
the most and took advantage of the
situation whenever offered.
Stanford scored four times in the
second and held the lead thruout the
game. Day opened with a single and
Ueeger bunted safely. Spaulding got
in the way of a fast one and helped fill
the bags. Then Maple singled and was
out at second after scoring two.
Spaulding tallied on a passed ball and
Argabrite did likewise when the right
fielder dropped Workman's fly.
In the next frame ('ass doubled and
scored on Beeger's out. Another run
came in the fourth when Terry singled
and scored on Dent's long fly to right.
The last Stanford run was registered
in the fifth inning. Day reached first
on an error, was advanced on Spauld
ing's hit, and scored with a sacrifice
fly by Maple.
Santa Clara got one run in the
second when Ybarrando walked, ad
vanced on an error, and scored on a
passed ball. Their other run came
after Milburn walked, was advanced on
an error, and registered on Ybarran
do's out at first.

against Santa Clara on Saturday, a
feat that has not been accomplished
by a Stanford pitcher for many years.

game from the Mission team 7 to 2.
Maple was complete master of the
day, retiring the Catholic players in
one, two, three order in five innings.
In the third frame three thrown balls
were enough to send them back to the

field outs, and started with bases on
balls.
The Stanford team hit when it meant
the most and took advantage of the
situation whenever offered.
Stanford scored four times in the
second and held the lead thruout the
game. Day opened with a single and
Ueeger bunted safely. Spaulding got
in the way of a fast one and helped fill
the bags. Then Maple singled and was
out at second after scoring two.
Spaulding tallied on a passed ball and
Argabrite did likewise when the right
fielder dropped Workman's fly.
In the next frame ('ass doubled and
scored on Beeger's out. Another run
came in the fourth when Terry singled
and scored on Dent's long fly to right.
The last Stanford run was registered
in the fifth inning. Day reached first
on an error, was advanced on Spauld
ing's hit, and scored with a sacrifice
fly by Maple.
Santa Clara got one run in the
second when Ybarrando walked, ad

an error, and registered on Ybarran
do's out at first.
