# Careless
## 
### 
The residents of this community
have fallen into a very careless habit

of late. We refer to the
throwing of waste paper
along the pathway from

the car tracks to the Post Office. The
scattering of such rubbish as candy
bags and boxes, tobacco sacks, and
newspapers makes this section of the
campus very messy and anything but
attractive to visitors. The waste bar
rels that are placed at convenient in
tervals along the way are intended to
be used. A little thought on the part
of the students passing by will greatly
improve the appearance of the street.
