### 
In observance of the eighth anni

held at the Mausoleum Friday after
noon. A goodly number of students
and friends were present to pay
respect to the memory of the Uni
versity's benefactress.
Doctor J. M. Stillman, head of the
Chemistry department, one of the "old
guard" of the faculty, who knew Mr.
and Mrs. Stanford long before the Uni
versity was their dream, was the
speaker, lie told, in touching phrases,
of the work and sacrifices of the Stan
fords, of the benevolent spirit in
which they planned the institution, of
their hopes, of their devotion and faith
and eulogized their personal charac
teristics.
Doctor D. Charles Gardner presided
and led in the prayers. A number of
hymns were sung, with CI. C. Ruehrer,
University organist accompanying.
At the conclusion of the ceremony
the Senior Class wreath was placed
in the mausoleum by Miss Ileen Bullis,
'1.". and Louis Cass, '13, the Senior
flower committee.
