# SOPHOMORE FARCE WELL RECEIVED BY PLAYGOERS
## DASHING LIGHT COMEDY SOOTHES RELAXED MINDS Underclassmen Carry Parts With Pleasing Ability; Scenic Art Upholds Stanford Stage Tradition By Everett W. Smith, '99 
### 
The Sophomore class with Augustus
Thomao's farce, "On The Quiet," last
Friday furnished the college play go
ers an evening's pleasure that was no
strain on the intellect and very little
on the imagination. The play was a
very satisfactory selection for produc
tion by a group of underclassmen,
and the actors were surprisingly ade
quate to their parts, especially when it
is remembered that the range of se
lection was confined to second-year
students. To say a few words regard
ing the personal impressions of a sin
gle member of the audience is as easy
and pleasant as any such task of pub
lic criticism can be.
It seemed to me the best work was
that of Mr. Heyneman as the world
experienced but sensitive hearted
"Judge Ridgway." Oi couise, in a way
it was the easiest of all the principal
parts, since there was greater oppor
tunity for the actor to hide his own
personality in his stage character, but
Mr. Heyneman did the work extremely
well, handling his voice and his ges
tures in mighty fine shape.
The next part in the printed cast is
that of "Robert Ridgway" by Mr. Allen.
This was a far more difficult under
taking, and whether Mr. Allen made
his stage personality exactly tally with
the character as indicated by the lines
is, I suppose, a matter of individual
opinion. Personally, without going
into details as to my own interpreta
tion, I didn't think he did; and I don't
think it could be expected from any
actor short of a mature professional
whose talent lay along that especial
line. But, that question aside, Mr.
Allen presented a lively, irresponsible,
resourceful scapegrace in a consist
ent and attractive manner.
The rest of the characters 1 must
let go with a mere mention, although
each could readily be made the subject
of an extended review. Mr. Forbes
was remarkably successful in making
the English duke of stage tradition
likeable for his fundamental genuine
ness. Mr. iliggins, as tlie calculating
conservator of the family fortune, fitted
his part. Mr. Thoburn agreeably acted
the part of Robert's college chum.
The other men in the cast filled roles
with well-established comedy charac
teristics, and filled them very well.
In such a brief review as this even
a mention of the chuckle and shamble
of Mr. Ross's "Black Joe" may lie out
of proportion, but they stand in pleas
ant prominence in my memory of the
performance
Politeness as well as justice would
seem to dictate a more respectful
precedence for mention of the excel
lent work of the young ladies, but in
the absence of any inevitable order
through the striking superiority of any
particular individuals over the others,
I am using the program as a guide.
Miss Cooper, as the cause of all the
