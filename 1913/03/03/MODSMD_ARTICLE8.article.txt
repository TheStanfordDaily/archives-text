# SOPHOMORE FARCE WELL RECEIVED BY PLAYGOERS
## DASHING LIGHT COMEDY SOOTHES RELAXED MINDS Underclassmen Carry Parts With Pleasing Ability; Scenic Art Upholds Stanford Stage Tradition By Everett W. Smith, '99 
### 
The Sophomore class with Augustus
Thomao's farce, "On The Quiet," last
Friday furnished the college play go
ers an evening's pleasure that was no
strain on the intellect and very little
on the imagination. The play was a
very satisfactory selection for produc
tion by a group of underclassmen,
and the actors were surprisingly ade
quate to their parts, especially when it
is remembered that the range of se
lection was confined to second-year
students. To say a few words regard
ing the personal impressions of a sin
gle member of the audience is as easy
and pleasant as any such task of pub
lic criticism can be.
It seemed to me the best work was
that of Mr. Heyneman as the world
experienced but sensitive hearted
"Judge Ridgway." Oi couise, in a way
it was the easiest of all the principal
parts, since there was greater oppor
tunity for the actor to hide his own
personality in his stage character, but
Mr. Heyneman did the work extremely
well, handling his voice and his ges
tures in mighty fine shape.
The next part in the printed cast is
that of "Robert Ridgway" by Mr. Allen.
This was a far more difficult under
taking, and whether Mr. Allen made
his stage personality exactly tally with
the character as indicated by the lines
is, I suppose, a matter of individual
opinion. Personally, without going
into details as to my own interpreta
tion, I didn't think he did; and I don't
think it could be expected from any
actor short of a mature professional
whose talent lay along that especial
line. But, that question aside, Mr.
Allen presented a lively, irresponsible,
resourceful scapegrace in a consist
ent and attractive manner.
The rest of the characters 1 must
let go with a mere mention, although
each could readily be made the subject
of an extended review. Mr. Forbes
was remarkably successful in making
the English duke of stage tradition
likeable for his fundamental genuine
ness. Mr. iliggins, as tlie calculating
conservator of the family fortune, fitted
his part. Mr. Thoburn agreeably acted
the part of Robert's college chum.
The other men in the cast filled roles
with well-established comedy charac
teristics, and filled them very well.
In such a brief review as this even
a mention of the chuckle and shamble
of Mr. Ross's "Black Joe" may lie out
of proportion, but they stand in pleas
ant prominence in my memory of the
performance
Politeness as well as justice would
seem to dictate a more respectful
precedence for mention of the excel
lent work of the young ladies, but in
the absence of any inevitable order
through the striking superiority of any
particular individuals over the others,
I am using the program as a guide.
Miss Cooper, as the cause of all the
di fliculties, made it seem entirely rea
sonable that as discerning a young
man as "Robert" should get himself
tangled up on account of her. Miss
Cooper's voice seemed at first not al
together pleasing—a little strident—
but as the play progressed that same
voice was, to me, at least, one of the
most satisfactory points in her very
satisfactory rendition of the part; it
created a sense of sincerity and whole
someness that was very winning in
"Agnes Colt." Special commendation,
by the way, ought to be given to all
the participants in the play for the
clearness and ease of their enuncia
tion. But I must say in this connec
tion that, although I myself heard
every word that Miss Trent spoke, I
could not help fearing that some in
the audience could not. Her tone was
very sweet and her modulation charm
ing, but a little more volume, which
she could obviously attain with no ef
fort. might have been an improvement.
She was, of course, beautiful to see,
and in one or two places where the
acting was a little difficult showed
ability apparently greater than was de
manded by her part. Miss Taff filled
attractively the ingenue part in the
play. The two young ladies who
played the actresses are to be com
plimented on the way in which they
portrayed women who were not ladies,
and nevertheless did it in a manner to
cause no regrets. Miss Shelton, as the
maid, appealed to our sympathies when
•she felt the motion of the yacht, which
is to say that she made the best of a
small part.
Stanford audiences take it for grant
ed nowadays that scenery and cos
tumes, and the music of the college
orchestra, will be on a professional
plane of excellence. On Friday night,
expectation in all these respects was
more than merely fulfilled; in particu
lar, the stage setting of the third act,
aboard the yacht, with the lighted
cabin below and the dark deck above,
was absolutely realistic
r l 'ie action of the whole play moved,
as it ought to, with dashing swiftness,
showing careful preparation. The
actors were put to the test at the end
of the second act. when they so skill
fully gathered themselves together af
ter someone had missed a cue. Fortu
nately Judge Ridgway remembered
that "the carriage in which he came
was at the door," and they were once
more merrily on their way, even
though the audience did not for the
moment know where they were going,
on hoard the yacht Coryphee.
