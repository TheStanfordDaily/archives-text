# Overtime
## 
### 
The holding of classes beyond the
bell is being overdone by some few of

our instructors. This same
criticism has often been
made in these columns but

the numerous complaints that we have
received lately compel us to ask cer
tain members of the faculty to play
fair. To hold a class overtime is man
ifestly unjust to both the student and
to the professor in whose class he will
be the next period. The Quad is a
rather expansive building and it takes
the full ten minutes to make many of
the hikes between classes. If the pre
ceding professor is late in dismissing
his class then the next professor is
interrupted by the tardy entrants. Nor
can those giving 11:15 classes be ex
cused for late dismissal. 12:15 to
1:30 does not give any one an abun
dance of time to go to lunch in Palo
Alto, on the Terrace, or the far ends
of the Row and back to the Quad again
for afternoon work. If these profes
sors think they need more time to
cover the ground in their course then
increase the number of units and hold
the class another hour during the
week. It would be much fairer than
having us do the extra work without
credit after the bell rings.
