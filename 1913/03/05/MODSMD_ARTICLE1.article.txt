# CLUBHOUSE GROUNDS TO BE SCENE OF PICNIC
## SENIORS MEET AND HEAR PLANS FOR FROLIC Holdovers and Postgraduates to Join With 1913 in Enjoying Mirth and Music Tomorrow. 
### 
Changes in the arrangements for the
Senior Frolic tomorrow afternoon at
4:45 insure an affair even more unique
in its character than that at first
planned. Seniors were told of the
nature of the picnic this afternoon in
their class meeting and the importance
of a large attendance was impressed
upon them at that time.
For the sake of greater convenience,
the scene of the picnic has been
changed to the Faculty Clubhouse
grounds. Here musical instruments
will be found in abundance, swings
will be hung, and tables spread under
the trees. Upon these tables will be
served a "feed" of mouth-watering
aroma, delicious taste, and satisfying
quantitiy. This supper will be of a
character never before attended on a
similar Stanford occasion. Something
new and exceedingly novel in the way
of "stunts" is also promised. Talks
will be made by representative Seniors,
as well as by Professor P. J. Treat
and Professor E. R. Krehbiel. Every
feature of the afternoon has been
planned for the purpose of prompting
mirth and friendliness.
The picnic is designed for every
Senior, Holdover, and Postgraduate,
the only prerequisite being the pay
ment of twenty-five cents. Each arri
val at the grounds will be presented
with a numbered tag bearing his name,
which will aid in his efforts to become
better acquainted with the members of
his class.
The committee in charge of this af
fair has spent earnest efforts to make
it a success with the idea of promot
ing thorough acquaintance among the
members of 1913 and of starting with
proper zest the preparations for a
glorious Senior Week. The committee
consists of Miss Vesta Wagner, Miss
Ruth Seeley, Miss Jo Long, Miss El
ecta Clithero, i\liss Margaret Emmons,
Harold Boyd, James Dodge, Karl Levy,
Frank Belcher, Linford Lull, and
James H. Mathews. Preparations
have been under the general charge of
Mathews and Boyd.
Arrangements were announced in
accordance with which the Seniors will
attend the Memorial Services on Sun
day in a body. They are to meet at
the Chapel at 10:4r>, the women wea"-
ing caps and gowns and men in dark
suits. They will then march to the As
sembly Hall, where front seats wf.l
be reserved for them.
Seniors were urged to attend in
large numbers the Alumni Banquet on
Saturday evening.
The president was empowered to ap
point a committee to look into, the ad
visability of a class jolly-up to be held
after the Track Meet. This committee
lias not as yet been selected.
