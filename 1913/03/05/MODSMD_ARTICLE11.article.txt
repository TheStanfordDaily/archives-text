Whenever the "old boys" come back
to the campus they invariably coni-

ment upon the lack of con
geniality that exists be
tween the various factors of

the University as compared with that
of a decade ago. And when wt listen
to the tales they tell we are forced to
admit that they are correct. The fault
lies in the fact that we don't have
enough functions where wo can all
get together informally. But there is
no reason why this should be.
The introduction of the jolly-up tw
years ago has partly supplied this
want but jolly-ups alone will not suf
fice. We must get together more fre
quently and in various sorts of func
tions. Tomorrow the Seniors are to
hold a class picnic on the Faculty
Club grounds. A better means of get
ting together and becoming acquaint
ed would be impossible to arrange and
with the proper patronage this picnic
will lie a long step toward a closer
union. It behooves every senior, hold
over and graduate to be on hand to
morrow and help make the affair the
success it should be.
