# RABBI MEYER ACCEPTS INVITATION TO LECTURE
## 
### 
Martin A. Meyer Ph.D., Rabbi of
Temple Emannuel, has accepted the
invitation of President Jordan to de
liver a series of lectures here, and will
speak in the Chapel, Thursday after
noon at 1:30. The subject of the first
lecture is to be "Palestine and Jewish
Literature." This will be an intruduc
tion to a course on "The relation of the
post biblical literature to the new tes
tament."
The Temple Emannuel is an old es
tablished liberal synagogue in San
Francisco, and Rabbi Meyer occupies
a very important place as its head. He
is a well versed scholar in the litera
ture of Palestine, and the course of
lectures will prove a valuable series to
all interested.
