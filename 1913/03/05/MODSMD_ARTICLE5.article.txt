# SENIORS PICK RIPPLING COMEDY "SEVEN SISTERS"
## LAURETTE TAYLOR'S STARRING VEHICLE OBTAINED Tryouts For Cast of Four Act Play From Hugarian are Open to All Classes. 
### 
"Seven Sisters," the fantastic farce
comedy that was used by Laurette
Taylor as her vehicle in a two season
starring success has been secured for
the 1913 Senior Class play. Playing
rights of the four act manuscript were
obtained by the Senior committee
through negotiations with Miss Taylor
and her manager Daniel Frohman,
who control the American copyright.
Tryouts for the cast that will play
"Seven Sisters" in the Stanford As
sembly Hall are scheduled for Friday
at 2 o'clock, in room 68. The tryouts
are open to all students, and charac
ters will be chosen from the broadest
field of dramatic talent available.
The play in its American version is
adapted from the Hungarian of Fer
encz Herczegh by Edith Ellis, and
translated to English by Ferike Boros.
The action of the play is centered
about the efforts of Micigyurkovles
the fourth sister in a family of seven
to conduct a matrimonial bureau that
will see her older sisters happily mar
ried. As punishment for a "shocking"
escapade at a convent, the mother has
forbidden Mici to "grow up" and be
married until her older sisters have
married. She is put in short skirts,
and dictatorial mamma cuts her age
from 19 to 14 years.
The oppressed sister is very much
in love with a dashing young count,
whom she met at the convent and the
two set out to get the three older
sisters out of their path to the altar.
It is about this part of the story that
the first act begins to twist its actors
into ravels of difficulty. But though
the girls are poor, they are comely, and
Mici and her lover manager to marry
one of them off, one at the end of
each act.
