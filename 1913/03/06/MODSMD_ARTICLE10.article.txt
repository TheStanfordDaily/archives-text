Lagunita has found its one all
powerful enemy in the Weather Man,
and atter a two month's tussle has
given up the fight. The waters of the
spring-and-summer lake have ebbed
until there is left little more than a
mud puddle, and the new boathouse
stands in a dry waste. With the reced
ing waters goes the crew squad, ana
Lagunita retires in favor of the es
tuary at Redwood.
Today Coach O'Dea supervised the
work of a freshman eight on the bay
water for the first time this season,
and with this initiation the work on
salt water for the first year oarsmen
begins. A freshman eight will be on
the water every afternoon, under the
direction of Coach O'Dea, while the
varsity candidates will take their daily
row of a half-score miles with Captain
Duryea. For a time one of the varsity
candidates will stroke the freshman
eight, but it will not be long before
(hey will work in their shell as a unit.
Nineteen men are out for the nine
positions in the varsity boat, Captain
Duryea being the only one of the num
ber who has pulled an oar in the var
sity shell against California. How
ever all of the men, with the exception
of seven, have won their numerals in
the race with the Blue and Gold babes,
and the squad is a seasoned aggre
gation of oarsmen. Three of the num
ber are working for the coxswain's
seat. Reineman and Ford having coxed
their respective freshman eights, while
Wolcott gained his experience at Cor
nel?.
