# Where is Our Spirit?

Reports from the sale of tickets for
the Alumni banquet on Saturday
evening show that a comparatively

small number of under
graduates are to attend
the gathering. Why the
members of this insti-

tution should be so devoid of loyalty
to Stanford and to the Alumni Asso
ciation is deplorable. We all realize
that there is so much that can be ac
complished by the Alumni for the bet
terment of Stanford and we are con
tinually calling on them for assistance.
Hut we refuse to forego selfish de
lights when we have an opportunity of
uniting with the Alumni. We dislike
to admit that the undergraduates have
less interest in the welfare of Stan
ford than the graduates but it is the
only conclusion that can be drawn
from the comparative reservations for
the Alumni banquet. There should be
at least two hundred undergraduates
at Encina Saturday evening. It is es
pecially important that the Seniors
attend but all members of the univer
sity are urged to be there. Let's turn

out and show the Alumni that we have
the same spirit that made Stanford
famous in days gone by. Tickets may
be secured at the Registrar's Office
before tomorrow noon.
