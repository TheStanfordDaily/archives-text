Chloe Leslie Starks has at. the Old
Studio an exhibition of pictures of ex
treme interest to coastwise dwellers.
Seascapes predominate. Monterey Bay
and its cypresses, the Quad and the
deep pellucid waters of Puget Sound
and the Straights of Juan de Fuca are
all portrayed by the artist's brush. The
exhibition contains oils, opaque and
transparent water colors and washes.
"Evening, Naniam's Shaft" amongst the
washes and "In the Fog," an oil, are
particularly absorbing.
