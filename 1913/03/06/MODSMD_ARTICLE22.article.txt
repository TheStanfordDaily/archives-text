# BEGIN WAR ON FLY TO EXTERMINATE HIM
## NO ORGANIZATION WILL BE FORMED HERE Several Prominent Faculty Members are Agitating the Movement. 
### 
The Swat-the-Fly-Movement which
is being so widely agitated over the
United States has been taken up by
the Civic League of Palo Alto and by
a few of the members of the Stanford
Faculty. At present there is to be
110 regular organization started, but
instead of this, posters will be put up
in the Bookstore and in Palo Alto.
These posters will tell how the fly car
ries filthy disease, why it .breeds so
rapidly and how it can be extermi
nated. A member of the faculty said
the only reason we tolerate the fly
is because we have become so ac
customed to them. Just to give an
idea how filthy it is she cited a few
sentences taken from an article by
Professor C. F. Hodge of Clark Uni
versity in La Follette's weekly. A fly

is almost continuously feeding, gorg
ing itself on whatever it can find to
drink. Digestion is rapid and weak
and the most ■* virulent germs pass
through it uninjured. It also regurgi
tates quantities of the liquids it has
swallowed.
There are three things to do to get
rid of the fly. They are: get rid of the
breeding places, trap them out-of
doors and then "Swat" the few that
remain. Tliis member of the faculty
also says that it may appear to be im
possible to catch any great number of
flies by the means of traps, especially
out-of-doors, but Professor C. F.
Hodge, who is the inventor of the
"Hodge Method" has invented a trap
which will practically catch all (lies
in the vicinity. The cuts above illus
trate his trap for catching the insects
out-of-doors. The smaller one should
be attached to a hole in a garbage can
or similar receptacle and the larger
may be placed near refuse piles. These
traps will be placed on sale at the
Bookstore.
