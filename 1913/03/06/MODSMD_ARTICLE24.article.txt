delegation to the annual Y. M. C. A.
Conference at Pacific Grove the last of
this month. The Conference will last
eight days from the evening of March
29 to Monday morning, April '7. It
will be entertained in the Pacific Grove
Hotel.
This annual gathering is attended

sity of Southern California, Pomona
College, Occidental College, Redlands
University, and Whittier College. It
is expected that over two hundred men
from the different institutions will
gather at the annual institute this

Heretofore the Conference has been
held at a date not satisfactory for the
Stanford students to attend. This year
the time was changed to coincide with
the local spring vacation, and all other
colleges in the State and Nevada
changed their regular spring recess
so that it would be satisfactory for
Stanford. The University of Califor
nia has no Easter recess, but always
sends a large delegation.
Some of the greatest speakers in the
country will deliver addresses at the
daily platform periods. Among these
are Bishop Edwin H. Hughes, Dean
Shailer Mathews of the University of
Chicago, Dr. Edward Steiner, Profes
sor Charles G. Paterson of San Fran
