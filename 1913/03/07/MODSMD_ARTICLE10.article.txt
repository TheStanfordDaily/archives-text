# Founders' Day
## 
### 
Sunday is the one day in the year
that we can manifest our respect for

those who made the
University possible.
The Stanford's have

given us their all that we may enjoy
and profit by it. The University au
thorities have arranged impressive
services to commemorate the occasion.
Attendance at the ceremony is a slight,
but sincere token of our reverence for
the Founders of our institution.
