"Dee-lighted" was the word used by
Dr Jordan in characterizing the As-

sembly this morning
and it exactly ex
pressed the sentiment

of the large audience. The address by
Dr. Ng Poon Chew was one of the best
we have ever had the pleasure of
hearing. The distinguished Chinese
had a message to give and he delivered
it in an intensely eloquent and enter
taining manner. We sincerely hope
that we may be favored again with a
talk by this man.
The Committee on Public Exercises
is to be complimented for securing
such an able speaker. Give us more
of such assemblies.
