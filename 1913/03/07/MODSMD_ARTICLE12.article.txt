There was one incident that marred
an otherwise perfect assembly. That

was the miserable singing
of "Hail, Stanford Hail!"
There was an evident lack

of understanding between the song
leader and the director of the Band
and neither knew when the other was
ready to start, It was almost the end
of the hymn before the singers caught
up with the music. The Stanford an
them is a very effective hymn and
should be rendered at the conclusion
of each assembly. But unless it is
sung right it loses its charm. A prev
ious understanding between the lead
ers will remedy such defects as the one
that occurred today.
