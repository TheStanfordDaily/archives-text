# RABBI MEYER DELIVERS A SCHOLARLY ADDRESS
## Leader in Emannuel Temple Talks On Distinction Between Palestine and Jewish Literature. 
### 
Rabbi Martin A. Meyer of the Tem
tile' Emannuel, San Francisco deliver
ed a scholarly address yesterday af
ternoon on "Palestine and Jewish Lit
erature." The important point of his
lecture was brought out in the dis
tinction between the Palestinean Jew
ish literature and the Hellenistic lit
erature. The Palestinean literature
pictured the Jewish .lesus rather as a
learned -lew, a scholar. The speaker
explained how it was customary, in
this inter-testament period to attrib
ute writings to great historical char
acters. Such, he said, was the case
in the so called Psalms of Solomon
which bear the marks of writings
eight or nine hundred years later. The
reason for tliis practice of attributing
writings to others was due to the fact
that men worked for the glory of God
and it mattered not to whom a writ
ing was credited. The oppression of
the time made it safer to write under
the name of one who had died some
centuries before.
"Palestinean literature," said Rabbi
Meyer, "had for its view point the idea
that the way of life was the religious
way,"
Further lectures by Rabbi Meyer
will be announced at a later date.
