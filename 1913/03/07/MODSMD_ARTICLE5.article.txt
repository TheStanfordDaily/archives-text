# CHINESE LEADER HEARD IN MEMORABLE ADDRESS
## "PROBLEMS OF THE REPUBLIC" STRIKINGLY EXPLAINED Dr. Ng Poon Chew Tells of Financial, Military, Political and International Difficulties. 
### 
Certain assembly addresses will find
a permanent niche in the minds of the
present generation of students, and
among them will he that of this morn
ing by Dr. Ng Poon Chew. Trench
ant thought dressed in the most origi
nal and effective garb brought re
peated applause which was far from
forced. Dr. Ng is an orator of no mean
ability, his use of English is masterful;
but above all praiseworthy was his
well-organized and thought-compelling
presentation of the problems now con
fronting the Chinese republic. With
wit of the Mark Twain order which
amused and left an idea behind when
the laughter had passed the speaker
pointed out the respects in which the
West and particularly the United
States may and should aid the young
nation.
Two selections by the Stanford
Rand not only pleased in themselves
but furnished Dr. Ng with a starting
point for a laughable introductory!
story.
Chinese Problems
The Chinese editor and leader dis
tinguished four classes of problems
which are to be contended with by the
new republic. These are financial, mil
itary, political, and international diffi
culties.
As to financial problems, Dr. Ng said,
"China is without money and has an
enormous national debt left by the
Manchu government. Money is the
crying need. We are fain to add the
missing word to the motto on the
American coins, thus making it read,
'In THIS God we trust.' We appealed
to the bankers of the west for a nec
essary loan, but they imposed humili
ating conditions to which we cannot
submit. These conditions meant that
for the next forty years China's finan
cial affairs would be controlled by the
foreign nations. We are willing to
borrow and pay big interest, but we
cannot allow such stipulations, so the
necessary loan has not yet been nego
tiated."
The military problem Dr. Ng saw in
the necessity of organizing and train
ing an army for purposes of national
defence; in learning from Europe to
kill "in an artistic and civilized man
ner." Military organization for pro
tection against foreign aggression, he
said, is necessary so long as the na
tions refused to adopt the Golden Rule
of the Nazarene.
Principles of Democracy
Turning to political problems, the
speaker said, "The principles of dem
ocracy as applied to the government of
a nation are new to the Chinese. We
lack experience, and 011 this ground
we are advised to go more slowly. Are
we going too fast now? Experience
comes from experiment, and to all ex
periment there must be a beginning.
China has a compulsory education law;
it has absolutely eliminated all rank
and is instituting ideas of perfect
equality in the minds of the young. Ry
