# REVISED HOLES WRITTEN FOR "THE MOJAVE MAID"
## Chorus Girls and Men Trip Gaily Through Measures of Sprightly Dance Music. 
### 
Several changes and additions to
the cast of "The Mojave Maid" have
been announced by the Junior Opera
committee. The reorganized cast of
principals remains as before except
the following roles:
Chiumhevi.Miss Madeleine Turner, '15
Charley Van Alstyne. .H. L. Reid, '14
Frances Merrill. .Miss Jean Long, '14
Edith Mitchell....Miss Marion Vaughn
Duffy Sloan L. G. Gillelen, '16
The lines of Van Alstyne, who was
the only extreme comedy character in
the original manuscript have been re
arranged, and Duffy Sloan, a race
track tout, ex-jockey, and general live
wire sport has been created to share
his antics. Van Alstyne and Sloan
are inseparable pals, and with a well
built bull dog as silent partner, should
make a formidable trio of laughmake
ers. Jokesmiths have fitted them out
with a strong line of quips, local and
general.
Rehearsals are now drilling lithe
chorusters in the airy dance numbers.
Sinuous glides, Grace-like dips, and
dazing whirls woven into composite
charm by inviting music and tripping
lyrics reveal the enticement of poetic
motion.
