# Founders' Day
## 
### 
Founders' Day is past. And glanc
ing backward over the celebrations

that have commemorat
ed this occasion in
previous years we are

pleased to note that the
services yesterday were the best that
this college generation has had the
pleasure of attending.
Doctor Henry Van Dyke came here
with a high reputation. Naturally we
exepected a great deal of him and we
were not disappointed. A master of
pulpit oratory and possessing a great
command of simple words, he made his
talk straight to the point and brief.
The University authorities are to be
congratulated for securing such an
able man to speak on this memorable
occasion. The large assemblage that
gathered to pay their respects to our
Founders was pleasing to note. And
especially encouraging was the fine
turn-out of Seniors.
The Alumni banquet on Saturday
evening was likewise a success. The
holding of this annual affair on the
campus was a step in the right direc
tion and we hope to see it continued.
While there was not as large a repre
sentation from the student body as
there should have been, the fact that
this was the first event of this nature
to be held here must be taken into ac
count. With the permanent establish
ment of this event on the campus coun
ter attractions can be eliminated and
the Alumni gathering will assume its
proper place in the eyes of the stu
dents.
Appropriate services like those of
yesterday coupled with an Alumni
banquet on the campus in the even
ing will give to Founders' Day its
merited importance.
