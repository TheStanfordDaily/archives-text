# HENRY VAN DYKE DELIVERS THE FOUNDERS' DAY SERMON
## 
### 
Taking his subject, "Freedom," from
the Scriptures and explaining his
points and impressing his figures and
comparisons with the natural delivery
that has made him noted as a talker,
Doctor Henry Van Dyke, delivered the
annual Founders' Day sermon in the
Assembly Hall Sunday morning.
Stanford alumni, faculty members,
undergraduates, and visitors from all
the nearby towns and sections crowded
into the Assembly Hall to hear the
message brought by the learned east
erner.
Doctor Van Dyke proved a forceful
speaker. His artfully constructed fig
ures of speech were those of a master.
In plain words he brought out his
points and held the complete atten
tion of the large audience throughout
the entire length of the talk.
"For freedom did Christ set us free."
he took Irom Galatians, 5:1 as his text.
In part, his sermon follows:
"Jesus Christ came to redeem man
into Liberty. And so down through
the ages have come his doctrines. In
the first dawn of Christianity and in
every new revival of its sunrise power,
it has come to men as a gospel of lib
eration.
"But what is freedom? We cannot
answer it completely. We can only
try to see a little more clearly the
things that makes for the pe:U'.3 of our
souls and the good of the world, and
the victory of truth. Liberty does not

consist in doing what you like. It
consists in liking to do what you can,
what you may and what you ought.
"There are three things in true free
dom. First, a true concord between
your desires and your powers. Sec
ond, the exercise of your powers in
willing harmony with the world and
third, the unfolding of your life by
voluntary efforts to conform it to the
will of God.
"Now I know all this is contrary to
the doctrines of liberty which are be
ing preached today by modern philos
ophers who warm up the ancient doc
trines and serve them up as a new
dish. They say to break loose and you
will find liberty. But I look at the
fruits which those old doctrines of the
new era have produced and I see that
it is but a proclamation of license.
"For freedom did Christ set us free.
Then for what freedom?
"For freedom lof conscience from the
burden of sin, freedom of spirit from
the bondage of fear, for freedom of
mind from the passion of current
opinion, for freedom of heart from the
burdens of the world, for freedom of
soul from the dark dread of coming
death and for freedom of life from the
prison of self."
The music, rendered under the di
rection of University Organist G. C.
Buehrer, was a feature of the ser
vices. The Glee Club and Schubert
Club assisted in the song services.
The rendition of the anthem "All
Praise to God in Light Arrayed," was
especially pleasing. The members of
the University Conference acted .is
ushers.
Doctor Van Dyke's sermon was pre
ceded by a few words from President
Jordan who mentioned that the Found
ers' Day services were the twentieth
held since the death of Senator Stan
ford. The benediction was given by
the distinguished visitor.
Rev. D. Charles Gardner offered the
opening prayer, which was followed by
the prayer of President Johnson at
the laying of the cornerstone of King's
college August 23, 1756.
Following the services, the Senior
Class proceded in a body, to the Maus
oleum, where flowers were placed at
the tomb of the Stanfords and the
singing of "Hail, Stanford Hail'"
closed the services.

the tomb of the Stanfords and the
singing of "Hail, Stanford Hail'"
closed the services.
Taking his subject, "Freedom," from
the Scriptures and explaining his
points and impressing his figures and
comparisons with the natural delivery
that has made him noted as a talker,
Doctor Henry Van Dyke, delivered the
annual Founders' Day sermon in the
Assembly Hall Sunday morning.
Stanford alumni, faculty members,
undergraduates, and visitors from all
the nearby towns and sections crowded
into the Assembly Hall to hear the
message brought by the learned east
erner.
Doctor Van Dyke proved a forceful
speaker. His artfully constructed fig
ures of speech were those of a master.
In plain words he brought out his
points and held the complete atten
tion of the large audience throughout
the entire length of the talk.
"For freedom did Christ set us free."
he took Irom Galatians, 5:1 as his text.
In part, his sermon follows:
"Jesus Christ came to redeem man
into Liberty. And so down through
the ages have come his doctrines. In
the first dawn of Christianity and in
every new revival of its sunrise power,
it has come to men as a gospel of lib
eration.
"But what is freedom? We cannot
answer it completely. We can only
try to see a little more clearly the
things that makes for the pe:U'.3 of our
souls and the good of the world, and
the victory of truth. Liberty does not

consist in doing what you like. It
consists in liking to do what you can,
what you may and what you ought.
"There are three things in true free
dom. First, a true concord between
your desires and your powers. Sec
ond, the exercise of your powers in
willing harmony with the world and
third, the unfolding of your life by
voluntary efforts to conform it to the
will of God.
"Now I know all this is contrary to
the doctrines of liberty which are be
ing preached today by modern philos
ophers who warm up the ancient doc
trines and serve them up as a new
dish. They say to break loose and you
will find liberty. But I look at the
fruits which those old doctrines of the
new era have produced and I see that
it is but a proclamation of license.
"For freedom did Christ set us free.
Then for what freedom?
"For freedom lof conscience from the
burden of sin, freedom of spirit from
the bondage of fear, for freedom of
mind from the passion of current
opinion, for freedom of heart from the
burdens of the world, for freedom of
soul from the dark dread of coming
death and for freedom of life from the
prison of self."
The music, rendered under the di
rection of University Organist G. C.
Buehrer, was a feature of the ser
vices. The Glee Club and Schubert
Club assisted in the song services.
The rendition of the anthem "All
Praise to God in Light Arrayed," was
especially pleasing. The members of
the University Conference acted .is
ushers.
Doctor Van Dyke's sermon was pre
ceded by a few words from President
Jordan who mentioned that the Found
ers' Day services were the twentieth
held since the death of Senator Stan
ford. The benediction was given by
the distinguished visitor.
Rev. D. Charles Gardner offered the
opening prayer, which was followed by
the prayer of President Johnson at
the laying of the cornerstone of King's
college August 23, 1756.
Following the services, the Senior
Class proceded in a body, to the Maus
oleum, where flowers were placed at
the tomb of the Stanfords and the
singing of "Hail, Stanford Hail'"
closed the services.
