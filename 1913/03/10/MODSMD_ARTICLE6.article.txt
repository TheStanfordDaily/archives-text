# MEMORY OF STANFORDS IS HONORED AT BANQUET BOARD
## 
### 
Establishing a precedent that will
probably be continued in the future,
two hundred and twenty-five Stanford
men and women gathered in Encina
Hall Saturday night at the first Found
ers' Day banquet ever held on the cam
pus. The affair was a success from
every standpoint, the attendance was
greater than the average, taxing the
capacity of the hall, the cusine was ex
cellent, the toasts were timely and
well given and the interest displayed
gave a keen air to the function.
From all sections of the Pacific coast
came alumni. The undergraduate
body was well represented and a large
number of the faculty were present.
Stanford history, Stanford stories
and Stanford hopes were recounted in
the toasts, all of which exemplified the
occasion. It was the twentieth Found
ers' Day eve and the banquet was a
fitting tribute to the memory of Sena
and Mrs. Stanford.
President David Starr Jordan offic
iated as toastmaster. With appropri
ate words and touches of a personal
nature he introduced each speaker.
In a spirit that expressed his feeling
more plainly than words, Hugh H.
Brown, '!Â»6. told of several traditions of
the University. "I like to think the
Stanford man and woman shows as a
chief characteristic the use and mastery
of simple words," he said. Mrs. May
Hulburt Smith, '02, in a witty and in
teresting talk, told of the saying, "The
Children of California Shall be Our

Children," which was expressed by the
Stanfords while the University was yet
a dream. Mrs. Smith stated that the
Stanford alumni had lived up to the
hope and had brought credit to the
Stanfords, as their son would have
done.
Lester J. Hinsdale, '95, spoke as a
member of the pioneer class and
praised the sacrifice and efforts of the
early faculty. Introduced as the "baby
of the faculty," Judge Emlin McClain
related his impressions and paid a
glowing tribute to President Jordan
and his Peace work.
"Stanford of Today"
A. W. Ambrose, '13, student body
president, told of the present condi
tions at Stanford and said that like all
other Stanford men, "we of today think
that the present Stanford is the equal
of any." One ideal condition he talked
of was the relation between faculty and
students.
Doctor Jordan, in his toast, deplored
the poor rate of salaries paid college
professors when the cost of living has
so increased. Me expressed pleasure
in the fact that students in general are
coming to realize that they come to col
lege to prepare for life. Student con
trol he said was merely living up to
the highest ideals that are brought be
foro them.
During the evening McDonald's Or
chestra played. A number of Stanford
songs and yells were given. Dancing
closed the program.
