# CARNOT TRYOUTS SET FOR ST. PATRICK'S DAY
## MARCH 17 SELECTED AS DATE FOR CONTEST Specific Topic for Debaters to be Annouced Two Hours Before Contest. 
### 
Tryouts for the annual Carnot de
bate are scheduled for March 17 at 8
o'clock in room 231. The general
subject for this year's Carnot is
"France and Republicanism." The
specific topic will be announced two
hours before the time set for the com
mencement of the tryout. Each con
testant will then select his side and
will be given until 8 o'clock to bring
his material to bear upon this subject.
The specific topic is to be given out in
the office of Professor A. M. Cathcart
of the Law department.
Each speaker will be allowed fifteen
minutes on the platform. This time
is to be divided between two speeches,
neither of which is to be less than four
or more than eleven minutes in length.
Thus the contestants will be enabled
to divide the time between set and re
buttal speeches to suit their own J'ancy.
The Carnot debate with California
will be held on April 11. This classic
of forensic events is to be staged this
year in the Stanford Assembly Hall.
