# UNDERCLASSMEN TO CLASH IN FORENSIC BATTLE
## Freshmen and Sophomores Meet on Platform in Annual Event on March 18. 
### 
The Freshmen having accepted the
challenge of the Sophomores to an
interclass debate, this annual forensic
event will take place in room 231 on
March 18 at 7:30. The Freshmen
have selected the negative side of the
question, which is the same as that de
cided upon for the Tri-state debates
and reads as follows: "Resolved, That
the immigration to the United States
of all unskilled laborers of the Slav
onic, Hellenic, and Italic races of
eastern and southeastern Europe
should be prohibited." The speakers
as selected in recent tryouts are A. F.
Coyle, J. D. Adams and L. S. Argall
for the Sophomores: A. J. Hettinger,
C. F. Cook, and J. F. Elden for the
Freshmen. W. R. Oiulerkirk is Sopho
i lore alternate while H. R. English will
serve in like capacity for the first
m- students.
Nestoria and Euphronia will convene
in joint meeting to hear the debate,
and a general invitation is extended to
the public. In the past this has been
an important field for underclass riv
alry and an excellently argued debate
has always been the result.
