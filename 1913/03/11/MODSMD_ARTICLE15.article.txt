The Daily Palo Alto desires to in
form the automobilists and motorcy-

clists of the University
and vicinity that the cam
pus highways are not

speedways. The excessive rate of
speed that is maintained by some of
our young Barneys not only violate
the University ordinance but endan
gers the life and limb of campus resi
dents. In our unique location we are
in the habit of using roads and side
walks co-extensively for walking pur
poses and in some parts of the campus
the roads are necessarily the sole paths
for pedestrians. In connection with
our city-free existence we are not ac
customed to cross streets at
only or to wait for a traffic officers's
whistle before going ahead. Most of us
dart across the road whenever and
wherever we wish. And it is the right
of the large majority to demand that
the small minority conform to their
habits. There is rarely ever an occa
sion for the great haste that many of
the motorists make and unless such
speeding ceases, sooner or later a ser
ious accident is bound to occur.
