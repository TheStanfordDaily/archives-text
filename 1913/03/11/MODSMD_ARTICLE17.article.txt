# WEST LECTURES TO BE GIVEN AFTER VACATION.
## Samuel McChord Crothers to Speak to Students on Immortality. 
### 
Immediately following the spring re
cess the West Lectures on Immortality
are to be recommenced. Two years
ago the first of the series was given,
and since then the fund has been ac
cumulating until it is now possible to
revive the work started at that time.
Samuel McChord Crothers of Cam
bridge, Massachusetts, has been chosen
to give the first talk. Mr. Crothers
has had wide experience as a divine,
having preached in several states in
the east and in the west, Nevada and
California. As an author Mr. Crothers
has won the name of America's great
est living essayist, many of his essays
appearing in the Atlantic magazine.
Some of his best known are: "The Gen
tle Reader," "Among Friends," and
"Miss Muffet's Christmas Party."
The West lectures were endowed
several years ago by Mr. and Mrs.
F. W. West of Seattle, Washington,
whose son died while attending Stan
ford University. They were founded
as a memorial to the boy and are al
ways to be lectures upon immortality.
