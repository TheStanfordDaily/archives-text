The interclass Irish Marathon, which
is held each year under the auspices
of the Quadrangle Club, is to take
place on Friday morning, March 28.
The exact time of the event has not
been set as it depends upon whether
the weather conditions between now
and Junior Day will permit of the cus
tomary sports on the Lake. If La
gunita does not fill, then the race will
be substituted for the water sports. In
case the boat races can be held then
the Marathon will come immediately
after the affair at the Lake. The track
meet between Stanford and the com
bined Occidental and Pomona team
makes it impossible to hold the contest
in the afternoon.
As usual the Marathon will consist
of twenty-four runners from each
class, every man covering one lap.
Gold medals are offered by Quadrangle
Club to the Varsity man making the
fastest lap and also to the novice who
records the fastest quarter. A silver
medal will be given to the novice mak
ing the second best time. Additional
cups and prizes may be added.
In addition to the Marathon a varied
program of stunts and specialties will
be provided for the amusement of the
bleacherites. The Hold-overs will
stage some novel race, and a greased
pig catching contest, obstacle races,
turkey shooting and oriental games
are among the contemplated fun
makers.
Class captains for the various teams
are to be chosen within the next few
days and tryouts for places on the
teams will be held on the oval.
