# BASEBALL FIELD DAY WILL BE HELD THURSDAY WEEK
## Plans for Big Time at Ball Park Now Under Way for March 20. First Held Here. 
### 
The first baseball fieldday ever to be
held at Stanford will take place one
week from Thursday, on March 20.
The scene of the meet will be at the
ball park, and the whole afternoon
will be given over to the various games
and contests.
The final selection of the date by
Coach Peters is pleasing to both play
ers and fans, many of whom have been
anxiously awaiting this news. The
preparation and practice for the var
ious events are now being indulged in
daily. Throwing, running, and batting
are each receiving their share of at
tention.
In these games all baseball men will
be eligible to compete. All events will
be from scratch. Both Varsity and Pea
nut League players will enter the
same events and upon equal terms.
Bach man will be allowed to enter as
many contests as he wishes, while no
limit of numbers will be placed in any
of the events.
