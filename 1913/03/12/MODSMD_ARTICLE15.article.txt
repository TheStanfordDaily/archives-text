# Honor Cards
## 
### 
The editor of the Quad reports that
there are about one hundred Seniors

who have not re-,
turned their Honor
Cards. A good

many of the delinquents have probably
neglected to attend to this matter and
a brief reminder will be sullicient for
them. But there are also among this
list, some who possess such a degree
of "modesty" that they refuse to be in
cluded in a list that they deem to be
an expression of vanity.
There way be, and probably are, ob
jections to the system of publishing
the Senior Class roll, but of all the
arguments that of vanity that we have
heard put forth is the most far fetched.
This form of modesty that some of
the Seniors think they have appears
to us to be more self conceit than
modesty. These Seniors should first
of all realize that the Senior Roll is
not a scheme of individual advertising,
it is the Class Record. The part that
the class of 1913 has taken in Univer
sity affairs during their four year stay
here is to be found in that roll and
with the publishing of the 1914 Annual
the doings of the 1913 class become
a matter of history. If for no other
reason than class pride every Senior
should enter his name in the Quad list
and in that way help swell the class
record. If some of the Senior names
do not appear it means that an incom
plete record goes down in Stanford's
annals as the complete record of the
class of 1913.
