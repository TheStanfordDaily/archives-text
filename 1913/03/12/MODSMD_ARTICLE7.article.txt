# 1913 CLASS WILL REVIVE FORMER SENIOR CUSTOM
## 
### 
President I. I. Ingraham of the Sen
ior Class announced today that the old
custom of Senior singing will be re
vived Sunday evening, when the 1913
class will assemble informally in the
Memorial Court and enjoy a brief hour
of harmony.
The practice has been permitted to
die of late, and was abandoned after
a half-hearted trial last year, at which
only two or three patriotic wearers of
"sombrero" attended. The program
was formerly held at the Lake, but
owing to prevailing conditions this
year the place of meeting has been
transferred to a more central and ac
cessible point.
President Ingraham is very anxious
that the first affair be a decided suc
cess. Several Seniors will be asked
to form an orchestra and the whole
class will mingle their voices in sing
ing Stanford songs, ending with "Hail,
Stanford, Hail."
