# PEACE ADVOCATES REFUTE NAVY LEAGUE ARGUMENTS
## "SIXTY-SEVEN REASONS" SHOWN TO BE FALLACIOUS Doctor Jordan and Professor Krehbiel Answer Pleas of Naval Expansionists for Increased Budget. 
### 
Answering tlio "sixty-seven" rea
sons which the Navy League
of the United States has just prepared
and put into circulation in petition
form for "legislation reorganizing the
personnel of the navy" and showing
their fallacy, Doctor David Starr Jor
dan and Professor E. B. Krehbiel of
the history department are the au
thors of a booklet just off the press
which is to be sent broadcast over the
nation in the interest of the peace
movement.
'the petition of the Navy League
recommends a "continuing and con
sistent program of naval construction,
to be determined by a Council of Na
tional defense duly authorized by Con
gress." Both Doctor Jordan and Pro
fessor Krehbiel takes exception to the
reasons as outlined in the petition and
have prepared refutations to each of
the arguments proposed by the advo
cates of increased naval construction.
The answers of the two Stanford peace
advocates were occasioned by the cir
cular letter sent by the Navy leaguers.
All Arguments Refuted
Doctor Jordan and Professor Kreh
biel refute in detail the reasons of the
Navy league. The arguments are
grouped under the following heads,
according to the letter; one, opinion
and quotations, the service the navy
renders; two, to commercial trade;
three, to science and invention; four,
to education; five, to general welfare;
six, to economy (the Navy as insur
ance of peace); seven, the inade
quacy of other means; eight, Ameri
can diplomacy and policies; nine, his
tory; ten, the uncertainty of the fu
ture; eleven, the National defense.
"The sixty-seven reasons consist of
short sentences or quotations, often
axiomatic in form, postulating the
broadest generalizations. Many of
them in a single line assert a world of
untruth or half-truth. In many cases
the reasons are no reasons at all, for,
even granting them to be ti ue they
have no bearing on the question
whether or not our present navy is
strong or whether it ought to be in
creased. Some of the reasons are
merely opinions or quotations. An
opinion, however bluntly or epigram
atically stated, is not an argument:
and it does not improve the situation
to give some one's else opinion in quo
tation arks."
Doctor Jordan sums up the three
motives or groups of motives for nav
al expansion as (1) caution or fear,
(2) business demands, and (3) love of
display.
Waste in Naval Expenditures
"Necessary expenditures in any line,
we need not call into question. What
ever gees beyond tliis is waste. What,
then," asks Doctor Jordan, "are our
motives for this steady and enormous
increase in naval expenditure? The
'sixty-seven reasons' furnish no satis
factory explanations, no valid argu
ment!'."
