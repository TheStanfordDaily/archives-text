# They're Off
## 
### 
Twenty athletes depart for Los An
geles this evening to engage in a track

and field meet with the
best that, the Southland has
to offer. Although they
will be handicapped by

having to enter the contests with only
one day oL' rest after a hard trip, we
are confident that they will successful
ly uphold Ihe good name of Stanford.
The University of Southern California
is touted as having one of the best
track teams in the West and they are
confident of victory. At this distance
it does not look as if the meet will be
such a walk-away for the Stanford
team as it, has been in the past, but
we expect to see another victory added
to our list for the year on Saturday af
ternoon.
