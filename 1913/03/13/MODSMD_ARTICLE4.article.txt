### 
Feature events for the 1913 Class
Senior Week program were planned
and discussed at a meeting of the com
mittee last night. Active preparations
for the class celebration will be com
pleted before final examinations com
mence in order to insure a more suc
cessful working out of the schedule*

degree of failure that would result
from delayed preparation.
Ideas for Carnival stunts will be so
licited from every available source,
and concessions will be granted to all
originators of feasible suggestions.
Arrangements can be made for stag
ing side shows in the house on the
Row.

provided Saturday evening, May 17, for
underclassmen, during the time the
Senior-Alumni Reception is held at En
cina Clubroom.

of doors in the Memorial Court in
stead of the Chapel, if weather condi
tions permit. The plans for class ex
ercises are only one of a number of
new departures that will be used this
year.

campus residents will be held the af
ternoon of Carnival Day, after the par
