### 
Speaking before the members of the
Economics Club at the Delta Kappa
Epsilion house last night on "The
Evolution of Economics Departments."
Professor M. L. Larkin criticised the
teaching of Economics in our colleges,
saying that the economists have held
too long to the ultra-scientific view
and have disregarded the human l'rer
will. He also stated that the tetchers
have heen incapable and poorly paid.
The aim of departments in Econom
ics, he said, should be towards Ihe
teaching of practical affairs, and there
should be a sequence of courses which
would give uniformity. The ideal de
partment he characterized as One in
cluding students who have a definite
idea of what they intend doing in later
years, and in which vocations are "las
rified.
