A suit of clothes reflects one
of two things—honesty of pur
pose or ti scramble for profit.
There isn't a garment in this
store hut that we could Iwy it
for a dollar or two cheaper, and
to all outward appearance it
would be 1 lie same, but we pay
the extra price to get the super
ior linings and we pay for the
honesty of purpose of Ihc tailor,
which assures skillful workman
ship.
