# STANFORD WOMEN TO FENCE CALIFORNIANS AT ROBLE GYMNASIUM
## 
### 
Following the recent plan of having
several informal matches each year
between the women fencers of the
University of California and Stanford
to promote closer relationship in this
branch of intercollegiate activities,
six members of the California women's
team will be the guests of the Stan
ford women for some fencing bouts in
Roble Gymnasium Saturday evening
beginning at 7:30. The following wo
men will fence with the California
representatives: Rose Bennett, Hilda
Volkmer, Maria Eustace, Mary Gara,
Evelyn Trent, Frances Odenheimer,
Blanche Whelan, and Jeanette Flitch
cock. H. W. Maloney will referee the
matches but no decisions will be given
as it is entirely in the nature of a
friendly exhibition meet. Previous to
Iho women's events Instructor Ma
loney will fence R. W. Griffin, '13 and
other members of Foil and Mask. The
meet is open to the public.
The handsome Spalding cup which
is to be awarded to the winning class
team in the interclass tournament
which will be held immediately after
spring vacation will be on exhibition
on the campus next week. Five teams
including one composed of holdovers
will contend for this trophy. Each
team composed of three members will
compete in a round robin. Any class
winning the cup three times succes
sively will become its permanent
possessor. Later in April there will
be an individual championship series
for a gold medal.
