# A 						Merited Custom
## 
### 
That no member of the present Sen
ior Class may say in future years that

ample opportunities for
meeting ..his fellow
classmates was denied
him during his under-

graduate residence at the University,
1913 has taken another step in the
line of get-togethers for fostering
class spirit and cementing the ties of
friendship made during the eight sem
esters of college life. A revival of the
custom of Senior singing is to be made
Sunday evening. This is an old tra
dition which was allowed to become
dormant last year. The Seniors re
sume the custom with the idea of pei -
petuating it for its worth. Since the
waterless Lagunita offers no available
lake shore the place for the half-hour
of song service has been fixed as the
Inner Quad. Seven-fifteen is the
scheduled hour and the singing will
be over in ample time for any later
engagements which would otherwise
seem to be a reason for staying away.
The good that, a class may do will live
after it. The Seniors are presented
an opportunity of making permanent a
merited custom. What shall we do
about it?
