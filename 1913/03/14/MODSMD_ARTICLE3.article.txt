# STANFORD ATHLETES PRESENT INDIVIDUAL CUPS FOR MEET
## 
### 
Instituting a new custom in the An
nual Interscholastic track and field
meet, twelve Stanford Alumni have of
fered a silver loving cup to be pre
sented to the winner of each event in
this year's meet. The trophies are to
be given by Stanford graduates who
have been prominent in track athletics
during their undergraduate days many
of whom have made records which
have gone down in college history.
The great value of these cups is that
they are given by representative men.
On each trophy will be engraved the
name of the donor of the gift.
Never before have cups been award
ed to the preparatory school athletes
for the winner of each event in any
interscholastic meet held on the Coast.
In fact the Interscholastic Associa
tions in the past usually gave only
medals to the winners. Stanford will
give not only gold medals to tlie fir.it
place men but also a trophy. These
for the most part will become the per
manent pfoper.y of the winnev. How
ever, two or three of the d< nors may
give perpetual trophies which w:!l lie
contested for from year to year. The
men who give the cups have 'lie right
to say whether they Mill be perpetual
trophies or become the property oi
the men who win them this year.
Twelve Individual Cups
Cups will be given in six track events
and seven field events to individuals.
Besides these the seven trophies which
are awarded annually will also be
contested for. This makes a total of
twenty cups which will be given to

point winners this April, Also twen
ty one gold medals, sixteen silver and
sixteen bronze medals will be present
ed to first, second and third place men
in the thirteen events in the track
meet.
This added incentive will ceriainly
increase the number of entries al
though at the present time there p.om
ises to be a record gathering at Stan
ford on April 11 and 12. Manv schools
who have never been represented will
enter the tennis tournament or track
meet, while most all cf the old entries
have sent word that they Vv ill send
teams.
