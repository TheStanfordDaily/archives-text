# STRONG CONSTRUCTION USED IN NEW BUILDINGS
## Commodious Class and Experimental Rooms Will be Features of New Building. 
### 
Roofing work is fast being complet
ed on the Hydraulics and Mechanics of
Materials testing laboratories. Tile
will be placed on the roof and a peb
ble dash finish will be used on the com
pound wall and those parts of the
building not finished in sandstone.
The compound is to be completely
fenced in, so it can be locked when
valuable materials are kept within.
The power hydraulic laboratory will
lie situated in the old furnace room.
The old engine pits are to be used as
tanks and pumps will be installed for
water pressure experiments. To the
west of the building the original elec
tric power house will be converted in
to a 50 by 42 feet classroom, with tiers
of seats and a materials testing labora
tory.
A cement laboratory will be installed
in the smith extension. The south
wing is almost entirely given up to the
elementary hydraulics laboratory.
Here ten experimental wler boxes are
to be built between brick walls.
A thirty foot water tank is to be
placed near the middle of this labora
tory and from this head will be ob
tained lor the hydraulics experiments.
The old oil tanks are to be brought to
the level of the floor and used for
their original puposes. The oil will
run the machinery and supply mater
ials for oil-flow experiments.
