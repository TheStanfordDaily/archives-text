# CARDINAL RETURNS WITH SHORT END OF SCORE
## LOSE UNSATISFACTORY MEET TO U.S.C. IN SOUTH Stanford Takes Eight First Places. Campbell Wins Sprints in Fast Time. 
### 
Twenty Stanford athletes went to
Los Angeles Thursday night, met the
University of Southern California on
Saturday and returned with the short
end of a 63 to 59. score. This in a
nutshell, is the result of the expedition
to the Southland. At the close of the
meet the score stood 62 to 60 but the
referee was prevailed upon to disqual
ify Whitted for falling over a hurdle
in the low stick race.
Captain Campbell was the leading
point winner for Stanford, taking first
place in both the hundred and two
twenty besides running a fast la]), in
the relay. Dawson made a good leap
of 23 feet 2/> inches in the broad jump.
Wilson and Bonnett were easy win
ners in the mile and the half mile re
spectively. King had things all his
own way in the hammer throw. Drake
was unable to stay in the ring on ac
count of the soft ground and Bailey oi
U. S. C. took off his coat and tossed
the hammer forty feet for the one
point. Dodge ran a heady race in the
two mile and broke the tape twenty
yards ahead of the much touted Swig
gett in the fast time of 10:7.
Finney and Templeton showed their
ability in the high jump when they cap
tured first and second in the face of the
howling mob of U. S. C. rooters. Tem
pleton tied for second in the pole vault
but the southern men refused to vault
off the tie and were supported in their
contentions by the referee.
McClure was boxed by Hodge and
Jackson in the 440 but finally succeed
ed in passing the pride of Congo. Gard
took third when Jackson quit cold as
McClure passed him in the straight
away.
The unsatisfactory ending of the re
lay, when McClure was tripped on the
last turn as he was going past Jackson,
closed a most unsatisfactury meet. The
detailed story of the contest may best
be had of the track men or any who
saw the meet.
Kelly was the particular star for U.
S. C. winning three firsts, in the high
and low hurdles and the shot put, and
running the first lap in the relay, lie
was caught at 15 fiat in the 120 yard
event.
