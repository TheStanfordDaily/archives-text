# The 						Southern Meet
## 
### 
Stanford has always maintained a high
reputation for being a praisewothy

winner and a game
loser and we are not
going to make Satur
day's reverse an ex
ception lo the rule.

Hence the less we say about the meet
the better. The twenty men who rep
resented the Cardinal in the South
showed that, they possessed the real
Stanford Spirit, They fought clean
and hard in the face of fearful odds
and there was not a man who did not
give his best. The members of the
team should not feel downcast in the
least for the Student Body fully real
izes what you had to contend with.
On April 3 we will get our revenge.
It may sound strange but it is the
opinion of The Daily Palo Alto that
Saturday's meet will prove to be a
blessing in disguise. On the team
that went against IT. S. C. there were
six freshmen and Several other men
who were representing Stanford in an
intercollegiate contest for the first
time. Naturally these men were more
or less nervous. But the experience
they gained in Los Angeles should be
a valuable asset in the meets to come.
