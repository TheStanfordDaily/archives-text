# INTERCLASS SOCCER TO BE PLAYED FOR SHIELD
## Williamson Offers Trophy to be Competed for by Stanford Footballers. 
### 
Five-a-side interclass soccer will be
played for a shield donated by C. 1.
Williamson, president of the Barbarian
Club of Sail Francisco. The date for
the matches has not yet been set but
all the games will be contested on a
Saturday morning in the near future.
The shield is the third trophy that
has l>een given by Williamson in the
interest of soccer. The other two
cups are to contested for by Stan
ford and California. This his last gift
is to be presented to the team winning
the five-a-side interclass soccer cham
pionship of the university.
The new soccer game which has be
come very popular of late around the
bay is played under the same rules as
the eleven-man contest, with the ex
ception that there is no off side and
that the goalkeeper only can handle
the ball within the penaltry area. The
team consists of three forwards, a full
back, and a goalkeeper.
The interclass matches will be open
to all students in the university. If
any class has more than enough play
ers for one team, either the best five
will be chosen, or the two teams will
be entered in the tournament.
All the contests can be completed
within a couple of hours as the length
of a game is but sixteen minutes,
which is divided into two halves.
