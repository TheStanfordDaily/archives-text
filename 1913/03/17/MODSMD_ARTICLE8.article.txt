# Last of Reverend Palmer's Talks.
## 
### 
Reverend A. W. Palmer will close his
Tuesday afternoon series tomorrow
with a talk on "What Jesus Did for
Humanity" in the Chapel at 4:30.
These talks have effectively presented
many of the problems among thinking
students, and increasing audiences
have greeted the succeeding meetings.
