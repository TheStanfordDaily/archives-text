# TENNIS MEN PRACTICE FOR INTERCOLLEGIATE MATCHES.
## Changes Occur in Ranking of Players. Team to Be Selected on April First. 
### 
With but two weeks remaining be
fore the final selection of the tenuis
team, the racquet wielders practicing
daily on Encina courts have caused
many changes to be made in the rank
ing of the players. At present it ap
pears that the team will be composed
of R. L. Murray, '13, Captain V. L.
Sheldon, '15, W. N. Hutchinson, '15,
and H. L. Hahn, '10, although they are
being hard pressed by L. Slos, '15, F.
S. Pratt, '13, and S. Chapman, '10.
Hahn has advanced from sixth place,
given him by the tennis committee at
the beginning of the season, to fourth.
If he can retain this position he is
sure to be one of the four men to meet
California. Chapman has climbed
from eleventh to ninth place and will
contest F. C. Hunter, '10 for the next
higher rank.
Captain Sheldon and Murray have
not yet appeared on the courts as both
are out for track. Hutchinson has
been playing the best game of the men
in training and has kept rank number
three from all challengers. Sloss,
who is in fifth position, and Pratt,
ranking sixth, are both liable to be
among the first four on April first
when the team to meet California will
be selected.
The date of the intercollegiate
matches has not yet been definitely
settled and has been the cause of much
discussion. It will take two days to
complete the tournament and the
racquet wielders will meet either on
the Saturday of the track meet with
California and the Saturday following
or on the Wednesday and Thursday af
ter the meet.
