If the person or persons who
thoughtlessly carried away the Alumni
Directory and the last four editions of
the Quad from this office will kindly
return same to the shelf from whence
they came, he, or they, will greatly
oblige The Daily Palo Alto. These
books are kept here for our own use.
We do not object if others come here
to use them for reference but they are
not to be taken from the oflice. A
prompt restoration by the present pos
sessor is requested.
