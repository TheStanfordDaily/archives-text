To run a newspaper all a fellow has
to do is to be able to write stories, to

discuss tariff and money
questions, umpire a base
ball game, report a wed-

ding, saw wood, describe a fire so that
tlie readers will shed their wraps,
make $1 do the work of $10, shine at a
dance, subscribe to charity, go without
meals, attack free silver, wear dia
monds, invent advertisements, sneer at
snobbery, overlook scandal, praise ba
bies, and also minister to the afflicted,
heal the disgruntled, fight to a finish,
set type, mould opinions, sweep the of
fice, speak at the prayer meetings and
stand in with everybody and every
thing.
This isn't half of it either. We have
to side with the faculty, agree with the
students that the faculty members are
a lot of dead ones, run articles for some
and explain to others why we print
such trash, keep enough religious
news going to satisfy the preachers,
and still not offend the laws, explain to
some indignant contributor why his
story was not on the front page, and,
in general, keep everybody in good
humor till they pay their subscrip
tions. In the meanwhile we all carry
fifteen hours' work and sometimes
study.—Drake Daily Delphic.
