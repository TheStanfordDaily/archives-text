# WOMEN'S FENCING MADE INTERCOLLEGIATE SPORT
## TWO TOURNAMENTS TO DECIDE LOCAL CHAMPIONSHIP Fencing is Second Women's Activity to Receive Standing-Basketball Postponed. 
### 
By the action of the faculty ath
letic committee, women's fencing will
now be on an intercollegiate basis.
This decision was made at Friday's
meeting of the committee and explain
ed to the women by the chairman, Dr.
Angell, following the fencing match
between California and Stanford wo
men in Roble Gym on Saturday.
The action came as a result of a pe
tition made by the women that both
fencing and basketball be established
on an intercollegiate basis. The fenc
ing was made an intercollegiate sport
on probation for one year, and its con
tinuance is dependent on the interest
taken and on the existance of friendly
relations with the California women.
Similar action on basketball was post
poneil.
Women's fencing at California has
been on an intercollegiate basis for
some time, while the Stanford women
have merely been as representatives
of a club. So much activity in this
sport has developed that it was de
termined to recognize it. Women's
tennis is the only other women's in
tercollegiate activity.
There are two trophy fencing tour
naments to be held this semester, and
another informal meet with the Cali
fornia women is planned. The beau
tiful Spalding cup will be awarded
the winning team in the women's in
terclass tournament to be held after
the spring recess. A gold medal will
be awarded the individual champion
in a later tournament. The first regu
lar intercollegiate meet will not oc
cur till next year as the women have
already met California this year under
the auspices of Foil and Mask.
