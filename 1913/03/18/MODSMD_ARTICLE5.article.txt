# OPERA BALLETS HARMONIZE POETIC MOTION AND MUSIC
## 
### 
Tripping, skipping, gliding chorus-,
ters are daily running terpsichorean
trills and tempting dips up and down
the stage boards at "Mojave Maid" re
hearsals. Dances and lyrics that flow
with the spirit of many live occasions
on the Quad and the Painted Desert
domain of the bronzed Mojaves, give
the opera its original, appealing
"kick." The novel story of the Love
Torches that is played in the second
act is colored with dances of maids
and braves that combine the sway of
tribal dances with the more exciting
motions of glide steps.
The rhythmic movement, and pleas
ing music of the choruses are fitted in
to a variety of kinds. Among the chor
us numbers are the Pony Chorus,

Baby Dolls, Candy Kid, and Jockey
Patrol, besides Indian numbers.
Negotiations Saturday resulted in a
contract with Goldstein for costumes.
The costume equipment will be exten
sive and rich, on account of the variety
of characters, choruses and occasions.
Photogaphs that show scenes from
the opera are now posted on the Quad.
Numbers for ticket purchasers will
be drawn Thursday morning at 8 o'-
clock. The sale of seats will com
mence the same afternoon at 1 o'clock.
Tickets will be placed on sale in Palo
Alto at Weingartner's at the same time
they are offered at the Campus Rook
store. No tickets can be bought either
in Palo Alto or on the campus until
the time set.


Candy Kid Chorus.
