### 
William Harvey Allen, of New York
City, will lie the speaker at an As
sembly to lie held on Friday morning
at 11:15. His subject will be "Seven
Yeais of Municipal Reform in New
York City." On such a topic Mr. Al
len is unusually well-informed. For
a number of years he was the general
agent of the very active New York As
sociation for Improving the Condition
of the Poor, and he lel't that position
to assume the direction ot the Bureau
of Municipal Research which has done
so much to improve the political con
ditions in New York through informed
citizenship and citizen cooperation.
Mr'. Allen is also the author of sev
eral widely read books dealing with
present-day problems, such as "Effi
cient Democracy," "Civics and
Health," "Woman's Part in Govern
ment, whether she votes or not," and
"Modern Philanthropy." In the lat
ter volume he analyzed the 6.000 ap
peals for aid which were sent to Mrs.
Harriman shortly after her husband's
death, appeals which reached a total
of some $200,000,000. From tins sr.ud.v
Mr. Allen worked out a plan for a na
tional clearing house for benefactors.
One reviewer, commenting on this
work, describes it as "pungent with in
dividuality, live-wirey with ideas and
brimming with the results of exper
ience and with practical suggestions. '
Mr. Allen's address should prove of
great interest to all members of the
University community. Friday after
noon Mr. Allen will meet all interested
students in an informal discussion of
the New York Training School for
Public Service, and the need of men
and women specially trained.
