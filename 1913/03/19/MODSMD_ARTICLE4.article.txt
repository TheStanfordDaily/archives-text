### 
Tomorrow afternoon at 1 o'clock,
tickets for "The Mojave Maid" will
be offered for sale at the Campus Hook
store and at Weingartners' in Palo
Alto. Numbers for the ticket purchas
ers will lie distributed at S o'clock to
morrow at the Bookstore and at one in
Palo Alto.
Properties and scenery are nearly
ready for the costume rehearsal that
will be held Tuesday evening, to per
fect the opera for its production
Thursday, March 21. The Alcazar
studio of San Francisco has been com
missioned to build and paint the set 1 -:
of scenery sketched by Miss Emily Mc-
Cord, '15, and the opera committee.
The second act of the opera is set
on the willow arched banks of a can
yon stream that flows through the saii
dy expanse of a Mojave reservation
in Arizona. The reservation scene
will reflect both the arid heat of a

desert, afternoon, and the cool breeze
of evening. Swishing waters in the
stream will add a charm to the quaint
tribal ceremony of the "Maiden ''iros,"
and the lovemaking of canoeists undei
the Hooding moon. Every effort will
be used to make the stage sceno n
pleasing and realistic blend of cos
tumes and background.
A pleasing glimpse of the Inner
Quad on the evening of the Senior
prom will be shown in the first act.
The recast comedy characters of
the opera have a formidable line of
jokes and pranks to spring through
the course of both acts. Duffy Sloan,
the live wire track fan, has been made
a classic devotee of the turf. Charley
Van Alstyne, the rah-rah feature of
the opera is well fitted out for a riotous
reception. Jibbers, the canine star of
the cast, gets his nose in a good share
01! the comedy.


The Male Element.
