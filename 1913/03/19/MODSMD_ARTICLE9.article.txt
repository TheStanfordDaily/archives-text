# "Music Math Charms."
## 
### 
Four years ago there was a group
of about a dozen men at Stanforu
who possessed horns and who assem
bled on the day of each intercolle
giate contest and paraded under the
name of the Stanford Band. Today
we are pleased to note that Stanford
has a band of sixty musicians equal
if not superior, to any amateur or
ganization of the kind on the coast.
This change has been brought about by
tli© activity of certain members of the
University, by the granting of an hour
of University credit for band work,
and by the generous contilmtions of
the Student Body to the support and
extension of the organization.
Until recently the Student Body has
been well repaid for the expenditures
it has made in this direction. The
band was an attractive feature at
every football ganie last semester and
greatly helped to stir up bleacher spir
it. At the reception on the arrival of
the Waratahs in San Francisco they
did themselves and Stanford proud.
In appreciation of the services they
had rendered and in expectation of
many more, the Executive Committee
gladly donated between six and seven
hundred dollars to the band, in order
to raise more money the band gave a
dance recently. They enlisted and re
ceived the support of the students,
which was proper.
But, in return for these contributions
we expect to get value received. We
expect to have music at the baseball
games and track meets just as we had
at the football contests. To date the
band has appeared at but two ball
games, and there have been two con
tests a week since the opening of the
semester, and has given three Sunday
concerts. There is a series of inter
collegiate contests coming during the
Spring vacation and Stanford will be
without the services of the Band.
The students do not begrudge tho
band a trip south for we know they
will give entertaining concert 3 and
will put in a good boost for Stanford.
Also the boys will have a good time.
But if we are going to have a S+anfo-d
• {and it does seem as if it should be
primarily for Stanford People. We
are contibuting the funds for the or
ganization and like to hear good music

just as well as the people of South
ern California. We claim a right to a
portion of the services of the organiza
tions that we foster, ami among the
occasions at which we desire the band
the most, are the various atu'ctic con
tests. We see no reason why trips
cannot be arranged without inconven
iencing anybody. But if the excur
sions involve the cession of campus
concerts for weeks prior to the de
parture and during times when we de
sire them most, then it is evident that
trips must cease.

Four years ago there was a group
of about a dozen men at Stanforu
who possessed horns and who assem
bled on the day of each intercolle
giate contest and paraded under the
name of the Stanford Band. Today
we are pleased to note that Stanford
has a band of sixty musicians equal
if not superior, to any amateur or
ganization of the kind on the coast.
This change has been brought about by
tli© activity of certain members of the
University, by the granting of an hour
of University credit for band work,
and by the generous contilmtions of
the Student Body to the support and
extension of the organization.
Until recently the Student Body has
been well repaid for the expenditures
it has made in this direction. The
band was an attractive feature at
every football ganie last semester and
greatly helped to stir up bleacher spir
it. At the reception on the arrival of
the Waratahs in San Francisco they
did themselves and Stanford proud.
In appreciation of the services they
had rendered and in expectation of
many more, the Executive Committee
gladly donated between six and seven
hundred dollars to the band, in order
to raise more money the band gave a
dance recently. They enlisted and re
ceived the support of the students,
which was proper.
But, in return for these contributions
we expect to get value received. We
expect to have music at the baseball
games and track meets just as we had
at the football contests. To date the
band has appeared at but two ball
games, and there have been two con
tests a week since the opening of the
semester, and has given three Sunday
concerts. There is a series of inter
collegiate contests coming during the
Spring vacation and Stanford will be
without the services of the Band.
The students do not begrudge tho
band a trip south for we know they
will give entertaining concert 3 and
will put in a good boost for Stanford.
Also the boys will have a good time.
But if we are going to have a S+anfo-d
• {and it does seem as if it should be
primarily for Stanford People. We
are contibuting the funds for the or
ganization and like to hear good music

just as well as the people of South
ern California. We claim a right to a
portion of the services of the organiza
tions that we foster, ami among the
occasions at which we desire the band
the most, are the various atu'ctic con
tests. We see no reason why trips
cannot be arranged without inconven
iencing anybody. But if the excur
sions involve the cession of campus
concerts for weeks prior to the de
parture and during times when we de
sire them most, then it is evident that
trips must cease.
