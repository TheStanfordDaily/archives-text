# EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE ANSWERS CALIFORNIA
## STANFORD TAKES SAME STAND AS BEFORE Will Either Reenact Old Agreement Entirely or Arbitrate Disputed Section. 
### 
In response to the letter from the
California Executive Committee in re
gard to a meeting of the Intercollegiate
Agreement Committee to settle the
football question, the Stanford Execu
tive Committee last night sent the fol
lowing letter to California: —
Executive Committee Univ. California,
Gentlemen:
We beg to acknowledge your favor
of March G relative to the Intercol
legiate Agreement. Last evening this
matter was considered by the Stanford
Executive Committee which held its
first meeting after the receipt of your
communication.
We do not care to discuss the rea
sons for California's action in this
matter, except to correct what seems
to be an erroneous impression on your
part; that is, the Stanford members
of the Arbitration Committee did not
vote a recommendation to you in this
matter. They refrained from voting as
any such action was entirely outside
their province. Further, the recom
mendation you acted upon was made
by the votes of two California mem
bers —one California member voting
against, and the Stanford members re
fusing to vote on such a question.
We wish to make our position plain.
The Stanford Executive Committee is
not desirous of discontinuing intercol
legiate football when it can be con
ducted under established rules. The
Committee is of the opinion that such
rules should hold until changed, and
further, that such rules should not be
terminated by either institution on the
grounds of a mere technicality.
We object to the University of Cali
fornia solving the disputed question
of football rules by abrogation. This
move placed the question beyond a
fair consideration in that it made nec
essary a majority vote of the Intercol
legiate Agreement for its reenactnient.
Otherwise, there would be no football
rules.
Section 1 of Article I of the Agree
ment is perfectly satisfactory to Stan
ford except as to that part abrogated
by you. We desire that Sub-section
A. of Section 1, Article I read as it
has heretofore. We wish sub-section
I', of section 1, of Article I to ex
press clearly tnat the football rules
as played in 1911 shall continue in
force for 1913 and for each succeeding
year except as they may be changed
by the football rules committee at
their annual meeting.
If you cannot coincide with our
ideas of what Sub-section F. of Section
I of Article 1 shall bo then we are
willing to submit the question to a
non-partisan arbitration committee.
We shall be glad to have the Agree
ment Committee meet and reenact the
big game into our schedule. How
ever, we must insist upon the ques
tion of football rules being disposed
of in one of the two ways above men
tioned.
Yours very truly,
A. W. AMBROSE,

ment is perfectly satisfactory to Stan
ford except as to that part abrogated
by you. We desire that Sub-section
A. of Section 1, Article I read as it
has heretofore. We wish sub-section
I', of section 1, of Article I to ex
press clearly tnat the football rules
as played in 1911 shall continue in
force for 1913 and for each succeeding
year except as they may be changed
by the football rules committee at
their annual meeting.
If you cannot coincide with our
ideas of what Sub-section F. of Section
I of Article 1 shall bo then we are
willing to submit the question to a
non-partisan arbitration committee.
We shall be glad to have the Agree
ment Committee meet and reenact the
big game into our schedule. How
ever, we must insist upon the ques
tion of football rules being disposed
of in one of the two ways above men
tioned.
Yours very truly,
A. W. AMBROSE,
In response to the letter from the
California Executive Committee in re
gard to a meeting of the Intercollegiate
Agreement Committee to settle the
football question, the Stanford Execu
tive Committee last night sent the fol
lowing letter to California: —
Executive Committee Univ. California,
Gentlemen:
We beg to acknowledge your favor
of March G relative to the Intercol
legiate Agreement. Last evening this
matter was considered by the Stanford
Executive Committee which held its
first meeting after the receipt of your
communication.
We do not care to discuss the rea
sons for California's action in this
matter, except to correct what seems
to be an erroneous impression on your
part; that is, the Stanford members
of the Arbitration Committee did not
vote a recommendation to you in this
matter. They refrained from voting as
any such action was entirely outside
their province. Further, the recom
mendation you acted upon was made
by the votes of two California mem
bers —one California member voting
against, and the Stanford members re
fusing to vote on such a question.
We wish to make our position plain.
The Stanford Executive Committee is
not desirous of discontinuing intercol
legiate football when it can be con
ducted under established rules. The
Committee is of the opinion that such
rules should hold until changed, and
further, that such rules should not be
terminated by either institution on the
grounds of a mere technicality.
We object to the University of Cali
fornia solving the disputed question
of football rules by abrogation. This
move placed the question beyond a
fair consideration in that it made nec
essary a majority vote of the Intercol
legiate Agreement for its reenactnient.
Otherwise, there would be no football
rules.
Section 1 of Article I of the Agree
ment is perfectly satisfactory to Stan
ford except as to that part abrogated
by you. We desire that Sub-section
A. of Section 1, Article I read as it
has heretofore. We wish sub-section
I', of section 1, of Article I to ex
press clearly tnat the football rules
as played in 1911 shall continue in
force for 1913 and for each succeeding
year except as they may be changed
by the football rules committee at
their annual meeting.

I of Article 1 shall bo then we are
