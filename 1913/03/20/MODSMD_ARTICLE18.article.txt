The letter sent by the Stanford Ex
ecutive Committee to the University of

California clearly sets forth
the stand taken by Stanford
in the foootball dispute. We

are, and always have been willing to
settle all controversies in any fair and
reasonable manner. Before the abro
gation of the disputed section by Cal'-
fornia, we offered to arbitrate the mat
ter in a way that could be nothing but
just. California refused to submit to
a decision rendered by an arbitration
hoard. Acting upon the sugges
tion of two of California's representa
tives on the Intercollegiate Arbitra
tion Committee California abrogated
the disputed section. The Stanford
members of the body did not give a
"passive assent" to the measure as
California seems to have been given to
understand. They declared at the time
that it was clearly beyond their power.
The abrogation of the disputed sec
tion of the Agreement by the Califor
nia Executive Committee was virtually
an ultimatum from that body. If
Stanford had accepted the abrogation
we would have acceded to the very
point that we had been contending
against. There was only one course
to pursue and that was to abrogate
the entire agreement relating to foot
ball. which we did.
The articles of the old agreement
are satisfactory to Stanford in every
particular, and, save for one section,
are apparently acceptable to Califor
nia. This section, however, has until
this year been satisfactory to Califor
nia and both universities have accept
ed the same interpretation of it.
Stanford holds the same position as
she did before the abrogation occurred.
We are willing to adopt the old agree

ment in its entirety, applying the same
interpretation to the disputed section
as has formerly been given it, or we
will leave the interpretation of the dis
puted section to an impartial board of
arbiters. Nothing could be fairer than
this.
