The crowds of ticket buyers at the
Campus Bookstore and at Weingart
ners' in Palo Alto this afternoon prom

production of "The Mojave Maid"
When nuhmbers are drawn at the
Bookstore this morning the longest
line of students that has come out this

line very few reached the counter far

Many studentes who failed to get

better luck with the townspeople.
