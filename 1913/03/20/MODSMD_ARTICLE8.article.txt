# HOOVERS PUBLISH WORK OF ANCIENTS ON METALS
## VOLUME IS NOW IN STANFORD LIBRARY "Father of Stanford Union" and Wife Translate Latin Work First Issued in 1556. 
### 
Herbert C.. Hoover, '95, and his wife,
Lou Henry Hoover, '98, have made the
first English translation of "De Re
Metallic," a Latin work on mining pub
lished in 1556 by Georgius Agricola.
Their translation has been given to the
Stanford Library.
It is printed in a handsome folio vol
ume illustrated by wood cuts, of an
cient appearance but of modern im
print. The work is dedicated to Doc
tor J. C. Branner, of the Geology and
Mining department.
A biographical note gives an esti
mate of Agricola's importance as a
man of letters and of affairs in his own
time, and shows the extent of his lit
erary activity. The work itself, "De
Re Metallica," was twenty years in
preparation and remained a text book
and guide to miners and metallurgists
for 180 years. The translators, both
former geology students at Stanford,
with the libraries of Europe at their
command, have endeavored to put this
early work into a literal and readable
form.
They have preserved as much as pos
sible the style of the text and have
reproduced the illustrations, letters
and type of the original. The foot
notes by Hoover are the only depart
ure from the form of the older volume.
