# MUNICIPAL GRAFT IS HANDLED WITHOUT GLOVES
## Head of New York Bureau Heard in Straightforward Assembly Addess at 11:15. 
### 
In a i)ractical straightforward talk
at 11:15 this moning Dr. William Har
vey Allen told of "Seven Years of
Municipal Reform in New York City."
The businesslike manner in which Dr.
Allen attacked his subject, coupled
with his illuminating habit of illus
trating it with facts, figures, and
pointed examples, made the address
an exceptionally helpful one. The
speaker, who is Director of the Bu
reau of Municipal Research in New
York, told something of the work of
his bureau, but his words did not tell
the complete story of the results it
has accomplished through its active
and efficient methods.
The remedy for municipal graft Dr.
Allen saw in inducing the public to
focus its eyes on the work the office
holder is actually doing rather than
on his personal characteristics. This
thesis he proceeded to develop at once,
his hearty reception furnishing him
with a starting point. â€¢
Applause Encourages Graft
"I do not like to appear ungracious
in the face of this cordial welcome,"
he said, "but I must remark that noth
ing has done more to encourage graft
than applause. Public men have been
judged by their appearance on the
platform rather than by their records
in office. In this way audiences have
made very serious mistakes. The pub
lic has not yet learned to keep its eye
on the ball rather than on the runner."
Dr. Allen then proceeded to detail
the accomplishments of his bureau in
New York made by focusing public at
tention on the men who really run
the city, the appointed subordinates.
On one job alone, said he, the saving
at a time when the gang of workers
knew that the public was watching it
over a time when the gang knew that
the public was not watching it, amount
ed to $90,000 out of a $200,000 contract.
Giving examples of such graft by
subordinates working under honest
chiefs, and the methods by which these
conditions have been corrected, he de
clared, "These things have happened
in our large cities as a result of stop
ping talk about the personal cpialifica
tions of the man in office and keeping
our eyes on the thing the man is do
ing."
Dr. Allen explained the eminently
practical budget exhibit of his bureau,
by which public attention has been
turned to the making of budgets. As
a result, of this, said he; "The men
who made the budget, realizing that
the people had their eyes on them,
made the people's kind of a budget.
The result was a saving of forty to
fifty thousand dollars a year as well
as an improvement in the way the
money was spent."
