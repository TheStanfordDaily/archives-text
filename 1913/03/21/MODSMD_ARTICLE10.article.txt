It lias come to be a general practice
among some of the residents of the
Row to make a conspicious use of
bathrobes. This is particularly true on
Sundays, when at any time of the day,
men, attired in multi-colored bath
robes may be seen playing ball or loaf

respective houses. The bathrobe is a
very serviceable garment for indoor
wear and may be used to advantage
by track athletes while resting be

Stanford men as a substitute for the
sack suit.
Such sights as these present any

visitors who pass through the campus.
