## 
### 
First in the series of lectures by
professors of the University of Califor
nia was the talk given in the Chapel
yesterday afternoon by T. H. Reed,
Professor of Political Science. With
a vigorous and forceful presentation
the speaker discussed "Big Business
as a Corrupting Influence in Politics."
He said in part, "The old method of
influencing legislation was directly
through the legislators by means of
lobbyists whose business it was to find
each man's price, and not to pay more
than enough. The condition is chang
ed now. Very little money is passed at
the state legislature. It is done by
control of the dominant party organ
ization, which is then known as the
machine."
"The System" he defined as "an in
formal combination—when a big cor
poration tvets control of a legislature
or a city government, the smaller cor
porations go to the large one and deal
directly though it instead of the legis
lature. The Southern Pacific formerly
held that position in California.
"Corporation control of employees'
votes is an appreciable influences in
politics. Big Business in many cases
i3 coming tc seek the hearty coopera
tion of i::-; employees by partially di
viding wiih them their swollen profits.
This tendency is facilitated by the
stronger organization of labor unions,
because that only leaves two parties
for the bargain. The struggle between
this new economic feudalism and the
free elements will lie the crucial test
of democracy."
