# SECOND PRODUCTION OF "MOJAVE MAID" SATURDAY
## FILL HOISE FOR FIRST SHOW CAUSES REPETITION Seat Sale Scheduled for Monday Morning at 8 O'clock; No Drawing for Numbers. 
### 
An unprecedented demand for seats
at the production of the Junior Opera,
"The Mojave Maid," on Thursday even
ing has necessitated a second engage
ment. This is to be presented on Sat
urday evening March 29. The sale of
seats for the first production of the
opera has totalled over a thousand dol
lars. This is the largest in the history
or recent dramatic performances at
Stanford.
The . . Alto people were unable
to obtain . • iitable seats at the initial
show because of the rapid sale and it
is by reason of the numerous requests
that the opera is to be repeated.
'Hie 'Second sale of seats is to be
held on Tuesday morning at S o'clock.
There will not i>e a drawing for places
but the pasteboards will be sold im
mediately. The Bookstore, and Wein
gartner's in Palo Alto will handle the
tickets, it will not be possible to ex
change tickets for Thursday's show
in order to get better seats at the
second staging of the opera.
A complete scene rehearsal is to be
held tomorrow morning in the As
sembly Hall. The final dress practice
is scheduled for Tuesday evening.
This was originally planned for Mon
day but the concert dated by the Pen
insula Musical Association made this
impossible.
The scenic artists secured in San
Francisco are laboring on the elab
orate stage setting which is ro ' ■ used
in producing "The Mojave Maid." The
Opera committee has found it neces
sary to expend a larger sum than
usual in order to affect the proper at
mosphere of the piece which ranges
from a scene at Stanford's Senior
Prom to the sandy wastes of the
parched Mojave Indian reservation.
