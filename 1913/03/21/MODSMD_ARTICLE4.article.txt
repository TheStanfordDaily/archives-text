# EDGERTON LECTURES ON UTILITIES COMMISSION
## 
### 
Edwin 0. Edgerton, of the state rail
road commission, yesterday afternoon
delivered to the law students a lec
ture on the organization and practice
of the Railroad Commission in Califor
nia. He told how the commissioners
are chosen by the governor and that
the commission is more efficient and
quicker in action than the regular
courts. He also said that the commis
sion goes as far as anything can go
towards regulating public utilities, and
if the present system does not work
the next step would have to be public
ownership of such utilities. The board
has the power to regulate all rates,
establish matters concerning service
and regulate competition, besides othev
powers of less importance.
Last evening after the lecture the
commissioner was the guest of honor
at a banquet in the Stanford Inn given
by the Phi Alpha Delta honorary legal
fraternity.
