# HOLDOVERSSECRETLY PLAN STUNTS FOR JUNIOR DAY
## MARATHON AND FIELD DAY ARE TO BE FEATURES Quadrangle Club Will Give Trophies to Athletes Making Good Showing in Events. 
### 
Holdover residents of the Student
Body are secretly laboring on a ser
ies of stunts, ranging from pageantry
to peerade, which are to be sprung on
the campus public on the morning of
Junior day, March 28. The feature
work of the veteran students is under
the supervision of It. S. Worthington,
'12 who promises to provide ample
amusement to entertain the bleacher
ites before and after the annual inter
class Irish Marathon, to be staged by
the Quadrangle Club. In addition to
the relay between the rival classmen
tho stunts and features which are
being planned are certain to be of a
novel character and a departure from
the usual line of laugh-producers.
Handsome trophies have been se
cured also for the first baseball field
day which the Quadrangle Club will
also promote during the 1914 week of
festivities. This will be held on the
varsity diamond on Thursday after
noon. Fungo hitting, circling the
bases, bunting, hitting for accuracy,
distance throwing, and other events
peculiar to the national pastime are
to be included in the program. Base
ball field days are annually held by
major league players but this is the
initial attempt to stage such a com
petition between varsity players.
A handsome silver shield will be
given by the Quadrangle Club to the
athlete who makes the largest number
of points in the baseball meet. The
shield is to be a perpetual trophy to
be contested for annually.
