# LAST SATURDAY BALL GAME WITH PRESLEY'S ALL STARS
## Hayes Will Pitch Tomorrow. Remainder of Team Same as on Wednesday. 
### 
The Varsity will play its last Satur
day game before the first Intercolle
giate contest tomorrow afternoon. At
3:30, Stanford and Presley's "All
Stars" will open their last game to
gether.
With but one more contest before the
first big game, that on next Wednes
day against Santa .Clara, tomorrow's
play will count for much. These last
games are important in developing
team play, and each man is endeav
oring to improve his record and
stamp himself as a stronger candidate
for his position.
Tomorrow's Stanford line-lip will
be identically the same as that which
took the field on Wednesday last, with
the exception of the man in the box.
Hayes will be given an opportunity
tomorrow to show his worth against
Presley's men. Dent will catch.
Workman, Cass, Captain Terry and Mc-
Closkey will complete the infield, from
first to third respectively. Halm, Ar
gabrite, and Heeger will play in the
outfield, each in his customary place.
The "All Stars" played a close game
with the California Varsity last Sat
urday, being beaten only in the last
innings of the contest. The same
strong team will make the journey
here to oppose the Varsity.
