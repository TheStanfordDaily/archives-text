# WORLD RECORD MAY GO IN STANFORD-OLYMPIC MEET
## Rose and Snedigar to Try for New Marks in Shot Put and Javelin Throw. 
### 
For the first time this season the
entire Cardinal track squad will be
seen in action against a visiting team
tomorrow afternoon at 2:15. The
Olympic Club is to invade the campus
with as strong a group of athletes as
are to he found on the Coast. The
team which will represent the Winged
"O" runners will be made up of former
world champions and track men who
represented the United States in Stock
holm last summer.
World's records in the 24 pound shot
and the javelin throw will probably
be smashed tomorrow when the giant
weight heaver, Ralph Rose, endeavors
to establish a new record in the shot
put while Olie Snedigar is hurling
the spear for a new mark. The Olym
pic Club asked that the heavy weight
event could be added to the number of
events as well as the discus throw and
the javelin throw. Graduate Manager
I). W. Burbank and Captain E. P.
Campbell complied with the wishes of
the CI ill) men and have added the three
events to the program.
George L. Horine, ex-'l3, s again
to compete on the Stanford track
against his former teammates. lie will
enter in his popular event, the hign
jump and also compete with Snedigar
in the javelin throw.
Pete Gerhardt will accompany the
Olympic Club team, but will not. enter
the dashes as he has given up running.
Before Gerhardt decided to quit the
game he was the oldest sprinter in
the coutry and was making good in
every meet he entered. On last Sat
urday he took the trip to Los Angeles
and assisted the Stanford team in
many ways which were certainly ap
preciated by the athletes.
"Dad" Moulton and Captain Camp
bell will enter a strong contingency of
men in all of the regular collegiate
events and Sheldon will probably com
pete in the discus throw. It is not
probable that any Stanford men will
enter the javelin throw or the 24 pound
shot put.

enter in his popular event, the hign
jump and also compete with Snedigar

many ways which were certainly ap
preciated by the athletes.
"Dad" Moulton and Captain Camp
