# OLYMPIC TRACKMEN ARE DEFEATED BY STANFORD
## WINGED-O ATHLETES BESTED BY 81 TO 50 SCORE F.S. Murray, ’16, Breaks Stanford Record in Low Hurdles. Visitors Bring Strong Team. 
### 
Stanford easily surpassed the track
representatives of the Olympic Club on
Saturday by a score of 81 to 50. Ad
verse weather conditions prevented
better performances in some events
but the meet proved satisfactory to both
teams. The visiting Winged-O's were
very strong in some departments but
the squad is not yet up to its best form.
F. S. Murray, *16 registered the best
mark of the afternoon when he did 25
flat in the low hurdles, breaking the
Stanford track record. In the high
hurdles H. Whitted, '16 won a close
first from Murray and R. R. Temple
ton, *15 in 15:4.
W. R. Finney, '12 surprised the spec
tators by besting champion G. L. Hor
ine, ex-'l3 in the high jump. The for
mer cleared the bar at 5 feet 11/
inches, while Horine did 2 ] /> inches
less.
F. E. McClure, '15, proved himself
a good mudder and negotiated the
quarter in 51:1. R. E. Murray, '13,
and E. M. Ronnett, '15 ran a dead heat
in the 880 yard event. Jack Nelson of
the Olympic Club took both sprints
in excellent time.
The day was too cold for the heavy
weight Ralph Rose of the Olympic
Club and he was forced to content him
self with first places only in the ham
mer and shot without smashing any
records.
