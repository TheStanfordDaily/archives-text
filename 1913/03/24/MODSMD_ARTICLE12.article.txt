# The
						Marathon
## 
### 
With the idea of encouraging a
more general participation in track

athletics among men
who might not other
wise become cinderpath
devotees a group of in-

terested men established the Irish
Marathon several years ago as an an
nual event. The founders of this In
terclass relay race had in mind also
the fact that the Marathon would serve
to introduce runners who but for the
interest aroused by class competition
and the novelty of the affair would
never compete on the varsity oval. On
Friday morning the annual race is to
be staged. This year the varsity men
are to be kept from the Interclass
carnival because of the meet in the
afternoon. The Quadrangle Club
which is promoting the affair has of
fered handsome medals for the run
ners who make the best time. These
are not offered on the principle that
to him that hath, more should be given,
but are put up especially for the nov
ices who have never won recognition
on the Cardinal track.
Leaders of the various class teams
have made a plea for more candidates
and the call for runners should lie an
swered. This event not only furnishes
an opportunity for a display of class
loyalty but is a University affair of
general interest. If the race is to be
continued, and it deserves to be, there I
must be a full representation of every
class on Friday.
