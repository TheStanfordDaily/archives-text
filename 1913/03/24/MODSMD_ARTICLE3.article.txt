# SECOND OPERA SEAT SALE AT 8 O'CLOCK TUESDAY
## FULL COSTUME REHEARSAL IN THE EVENING Lavish Stage Equipment and Wardrobe Will Make "Mojave Maid" Production Rich in Detail. 
### 
Tickets for the second production
of the Junior Opera "The Mojave
Maid" will be sold tomorrow morning
at 8 o'clock at the Bookstore and at
Weingartners' in Palo Alto. The sale
for the first performance was so
heavy that it was evident that hun
dreds of people would be unable to
secure tickets for next Thursday
evening. The audience at the second
production on Saturday will number
many patrons from Palo Alto and San
Jose, besides students. The number
of applicants for tickets to the first
performance who had to be turned
away assures a crowded house at the
reproduction.
Final rehearsal of the entire opera
in two acts will be held in costume to
morrow evening. For the first time
the principals and chorus people will
work together with a full complement
of character dress and scenery.
Elaborate stage settings have been
prepared by the Alcazar studio, and
will be installed for the rehearsal to
morrow evening. The list of prop
erties and stage effects is more exten
sive and lavish than any that has been
used in the staging of a Stanford
opera in past years.
Catchy music composed by A. E.
Stearns, '16 and J. L. McDonald, '14,
pleasing lyrics, comedy lines, and an
interesting plot by Miss Emily McCord,
' 1 r>, furnish the cast with one of the
liest vehicles that lias ever been evolv
ed by student talent.
