# OPERA CAST WILL HOLD LAST REHEARSAL TONIGHT
## ASSEMBLY HALL STAGE READY FOR PRODUCTIONS Miss Betty Funsten Will Carry Role First Cast for Miss Louise Curtice. 
### 
Full rehearsal of "The Mojave Maid"
was held I his afternoon with scenery,
costumes, and orchestra accompani
ment. This evening at 7:30 the cast
of the 1914 opera will face an empty
house for the last time in rehearsal,
to perfect the performance for its first
production Thursday evening.
Miss Mary Gard, 'If), will assume
the out of door grace and unspoiled
charm of Chiumhevi, the winsome maid
of the Mojaves. Her opportunities for
drawing the admiration of the audience
are numerous, and Chiumhevi promises
to be one of the star characters of the
opera. The Indian girl is altogether
likeable, and her love for Veeda, whom
klic has thought to be her sister is
proved by her joy when it is learned
that Veeda is a white girl.
Because of the sudden illness of Miss
Louise Curtice, '14, who was to have
played the part of Mabel Wiley, the
role will be taken by Miss Hetty Fun
ster, '14.
