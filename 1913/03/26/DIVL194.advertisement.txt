An Object Lesson in Home Industry
California needs more new factories. This State lias the workers,
the materials, and the intelligence to manufacture as cheaply r.nd as
well, as any section in the United States. We need more people who
believe in the future of California, and who will insist upon "made
in California" products.
We could not have expected to be successful in the manufacture
of Knit Wear unless our quality and our prices were right, nor could
we have succeeded without the support of people living withifn this
State. Our new factory will give profitable employment to 400 Cali
fornians. $200,000 will be spent in the construction of it.
You as a loyal Californian, should insist upon "made in Califor
nia" goods wherever and whenever possible, and particularly when
quality and price are equal, as they always are in the case of G. & M.
Knit Wear.
