# Junior Week
## 
### 
Junior Week festivities commence
tonight with the Hand Concert and fire-

works at the Lake. Though
handicapped by the lack of
water in Lagunita which

precludes all possibility of
the usual aquatic sports, the members
of the 1914 class and the Junior Week
Committee have labored diligently to
make the event a success. The attrac
tions that have been substituted should
afford entertainment for the most fas
tidious. Good luck to you 1914. May
your Junior Week be the best ever.
