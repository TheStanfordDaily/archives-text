# Is This Vacation?
## 
### 
According to the Calendar issued by
the University authorities, March 29

to April G is set aside as
a "mid-semester recess."
The purpose of this vaca
tion is to give the faculty

and students a chance to take a new
lease of life preparatory to entering
the final "grind" of the year. But
judging from the number of exes that
have been assigned for Monday April
7, this intent seems to have been lost
sight of by several members of the fac
ulty.
To have to face two exes in a single
day at any time of the year is bad
enough but to have them hanging over
our head in vacation is worse. Nor can
we see any justice in an arrangement
where the students are confronted witti
the task of studying for two, and in
some cases three, exes during a week
of supposed vacation, while our pro
fessors are taking a much needed rest.
If the trustees are willing to grant us
a "mid-semester recess" we should be
permitted to enjoy it. The fact that
there will be no classes for a week is
no ground upon which to sentence us
to nine days of hard labor.
