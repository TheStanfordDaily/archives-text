# NOVICE MARATHON RUNNERS TO FURNISH KEEN SPORT

### 
Keen competition is being made
among novice runners for places on
the respective class squads for the
Marathon teams which will enter the
six mile Irish grind on Friday morning
The fact that varsity athletes will be
kept out of competition on account of
the meet with Pomona and Occidental
in the afternoon will place the teams
on the fairest basis possible. The two
men who cover the quarter mile in the
fastest time will each be given a medal
by the Quadrangle Club which is stag
ing the Marathon.
