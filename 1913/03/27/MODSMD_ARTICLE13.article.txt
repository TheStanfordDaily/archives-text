# DISTRIBUTION OF PROGRAMS TOMORROW MORNING
## List of Patrons and Patronesses Announced. Supper to he Served in Eating Clubs. 
### 
Half past eight tomorrow evening,
the grand march of the nineteenth
annual Junior Prom will begin in
Encina clubroom. This is the con
cluding feature of the 1914 week of
festivities. Decorators have been busy
today transforming the spacious dor
mitory clubroom into a maze of cher
ry blossoms and greens.
The programs for the Prom are to
be distributed tomorrow morning from
the Bookstore. Holders of tickets
must present the numbered pasteboard
before receiving an announcement of
the engagements for the dance. The
program is the work of Miss Hazel
Clark '15.
This year the supper is to be served
in the new Eating Clubs just south of
Encina. The plan will be tried for
the first time and the new location
promises to do away with the difficul
ties encountered by the caterers when
the supper was served on the second
floor of the Hall. The ninth and
twelfth dances are reserved for the
refreshments. The plan of selecting
the dance at which each couple will
eat is to be announced during the
dancc.
