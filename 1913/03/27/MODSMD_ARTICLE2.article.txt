# "MOJAVE MAID" WILL BE TONIGHT'S ATTRACTION
## 
### 
The "Mo.jave Maid" will sing dance,
and charm at the Assembly Hail pro
duction of the 1914 Junior Opera this
evening. The splendor of two me
lodious acts, conceived and written
with a free rein of originality carries
a medley of chorus and solo numbers
through a pleasing variety of situa
tions. From the time the first curtain
discovers spooning couples of Senior
promenaders on the Quad until the
final ensemble of college people, paint
ed Indians, a race track plunger, ann
a real dog, life in the scenes of the
opera is never dull.
Costumes, stage fixtures, and or
chestra accompaniment, the beauty of
the music and swing of the dances
stamp the offering with unusual value.
The curtain will rise at 8:15.
