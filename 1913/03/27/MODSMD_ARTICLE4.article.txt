# COACH PETERS ANNOUNCES STANFORD TEAM TO START CALIFORNIA SERIES
## 
### 
With a team that has won twelve
out of seventeen preliminary games
and one that has been playing inside
ball for the past month, the Stanford
fans look for but two games to bring
them the Intercollegiate championship
of the year. A team that is fast in
every department of the game and one
that has proven itself a good scoring
combination is the result of the sea
son's work.
The year's record shows the Cardi
nal victorious in the series with Santa
Clara, St. Mary's, Olympic Club and
Presley's All Stars, while the games [
with Ireland's Independents resulted j
two each. In these contests Stanford |
has scored SO runs to her opponents' I
49. I'p to yesterday's contest the Var- ;
sity won nine straight.
The Stanford team has proven itself
a light but timely hitting combination,
on many occasions getting fewer hits
than its opponents. Of the twenty
three extra basehits, five were home
runs, six three-baggers, and twelve
doubles. The batting average of the
team is 22ti. Coupled with the hitting
in the pinches, the pitching of Maple
has been the largest factor in the win
ning of games. This player has proved

to be the best man that Stanford has
had in the box for many years, and
his record of twirling no-hit ball
against Santa Clara and of allowing
Ireland's men but one safety in their
last game is likely to stand for years.
On third base the Varsity has an ex
cellent fielder in McCloskey. Halm, Ar
gabrite, and Beeger are all outfield
veterans and have again proven their j
right to places on the team. One ad- ;
ditional substitute will be named to- !
morrow afternoon.
When the season opened, Coach
Peters had six veterans with which to
work. Of these men none had ever
played battery positions. Halm, last j
year's center fielder, and Gragg, a for
mer second team man, have been given i
work in the box together with Fresh
man Hayes. .Maple entered college last
fall with advance standing and has
proven the pick of them all. Dent, in- |
eligible last year, has proven himself'
not only the best catcher on the squad ,
but is also leading the team in batting, i
Captain Terry lias played all season J
at his old short-stop position in ens- j
toniary style. His fielding and base-i
running is even better than ever,-..this.|
year. Workman, ineligible last year,
is playing first base because of his abil
ity both at the bat and in the field.

Cass, a veteran of last year, is playing
second in an improved style and is
hitting heavily.
In this, the third season of the non
paid undergraduate coaching system
and the second year under I). Peters,
'11, the Stanford team lias had the
coaching of an excellent leader and
good ball player. Peters is an advo
cate of clean, inside baseball and has
given his time with exceptional results.

son's play follow:
