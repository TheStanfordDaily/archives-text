### 
Coach Peters today names the base
ball team that will represent Stanford

in the game with Cali
fornia Saturday. There
are 110 surprises in his
selections and we think

that he has picked the strongest nine
possible. The men have practiced
faithfully all season and their playing
in the preliminary games speaks well
for Coach Peters and Captain Terry.
We feel_ confident that they will bring
the series to Stanford this year but in
meeting California they will go against
the hardest proposition they have yet
faced. We want to win that first game
Saturday and we are going to if the
student body gets behind the team.
