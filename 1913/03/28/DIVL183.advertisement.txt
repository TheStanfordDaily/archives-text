New Gantner & Matters Factory
An Object Lesson in Home Industry
California needs more new factories. This State has the workers,
the materials, and the intelligence to manufacture as cheaply and as
well as any section in the United States. We need more people who
believe in the future of California, and who will insist upon "made
in California" products.
We could not have expected to he successful in the manufacture
of Knit Wear unless our quality and our prices were right, nor could &
we have succeeded without the support of people living with to this
State. • Our new factory will give profitable employment to 400 Cali- I
fornians. $200,000 will he spent in the construction of it.
You as a loyal Californian, should insist upon "made in Califor- I
nia" goods wherever and whenever possible, and particularly when I
quality and price are equal, as they always are in the case of G. &M. ft
Knit Wear.
