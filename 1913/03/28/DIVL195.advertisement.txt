A Delightful Route East!
YOU AVOID THE COLD DURING
THE WINTER MONTHS
BY RAIL AND OCEAN
You see the South, taking the palatial South
ern Pacific steamer from New Orleans, or if
you prefer, take the ALL-RAIL ROUTE, with
Standard Sleepers, Observation and Library
cars.—Through personally conducted tourist
sleepers.
