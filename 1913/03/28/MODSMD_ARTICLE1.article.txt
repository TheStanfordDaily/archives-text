# JUNIOR OPERA AUDIENCE WITNESSES GOOD SHOW
## WELL BALANCED PERFORMANCE RENDERED Critic Tells of "Skit" and Praise Work of Those Who Took Part. 
### Colbert Seales 
A Junior Opera is not an opera; it
is a skit, a thread of a story on which
are strung a series of comic and sen
timental songs, alternating 'fith jokes,
swinging choruses, dancing and fine
stage pictures. That is what people go
to Junior Operas for and that is what
a large and enthusiastic audience saw
last night—it was a good show.
After a medley overture the curtain
rose on a corner of the Quad, beauti
fully staged with admirable light ef
fects, and the chorus began its trium
phant career. It was a chorus to jus
tify the enthusiastic comment of Duf
fy Sloan: "The prettiest bunch of fav
orites that ever caressed my optics,"—
or words to that effect. And all
through the evening the chorus made
good in charming costume effects and
graceful dances; the "doll" and "jock
ey" choruses being especially pleasing
for a variety of reasons. Thpn some
jokes and Charley Van Alstyne an
nounced in tuneful numbers that he
was ''the candy." Some more jokes and
the word "dolls" being mentioned,
Frances Merrill (Miss Long) and Hal
Butcher (R. Krohn) sang "Baby Doll"
introducing the chorus which was one
of the hits of the evening.
Choruses Score Triumph
After a while the story began. It
differed from preceding Junior Opera
stories in that the university did not

ine. A waif of the Mojave desert, she
had sucessfully eluded the five hun
dred limit and, after an enviable ca
reer on the university romantic war
path, returned to her native lair; all
of which was a sufficiently plausible
excuse for a very beautiful and artistic
staging of this corner of California.
And that was the second act which, in
stage effects, surpassed the first, whilts
the musical numbers and the "feat
ures" were considerably more attrac
tive. In fact the producers of the piece
are to I o congratulated on the clever
ness with which they maintained an
evenly ascending scale of pleasing ef
fects throughout the evening.
It was a very well balanced perform
ance with very few hitches in which
all did their parts very well without
any one being preeminent. At least so
it seemed to the writer. Van Alstyne
(H. L. Reed and Duffy Sloan (L. G.
Gillelen) "put across" their jokes in
adroit fashion and they were good
jokes much appreciated by the aud
ience.
Duets and Solos Charming
.Miss Long and Mr. Krohn did very
good work throughout, and especially
in the doll chorus feature and the sen
timental tune "In the Moonlight."
which ended in a very pretty dance;
which, in turn was a queer ending for
a sentimental effusion —but that is a
way sentimental effusions have in mus
ical comedy. Billy Framing's (W. S.
Burns) singing after being afflicted
with nasality in the first act got mucn
better in the second, and was at its
