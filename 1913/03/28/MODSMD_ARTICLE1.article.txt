# JUNIOR OPERA AUDIENCE WITNESSES GOOD SHOW
## WELL BALANCED PERFORMANCE RENDERED Critic Tells of "Skit" and Praise Work of Those Who Took Part. 
### Colbert Seales 
A Junior Opera is not an opera; it
is a skit, a thread of a story on which
are strung a series of comic and sen
timental songs, alternating 'fith jokes,
swinging choruses, dancing and fine
stage pictures. That is what people go
to Junior Operas for and that is what
a large and enthusiastic audience saw
last night—it was a good show.
After a medley overture the curtain
rose on a corner of the Quad, beauti
fully staged with admirable light ef
fects, and the chorus began its trium
phant career. It was a chorus to jus
tify the enthusiastic comment of Duf
fy Sloan: "The prettiest bunch of fav
orites that ever caressed my optics,"—
or words to that effect. And all
through the evening the chorus made
good in charming costume effects and
graceful dances; the "doll" and "jock
ey" choruses being especially pleasing
for a variety of reasons. Thpn some
jokes and Charley Van Alstyne an
nounced in tuneful numbers that he
was ''the candy." Some more jokes and
the word "dolls" being mentioned,
Frances Merrill (Miss Long) and Hal
Butcher (R. Krohn) sang "Baby Doll"
introducing the chorus which was one
of the hits of the evening.
Choruses Score Triumph
After a while the story began. It
differed from preceding Junior Opera
stories in that the university did not
have to go so far in pursuit of the hero
ine. A waif of the Mojave desert, she
had sucessfully eluded the five hun
dred limit and, after an enviable ca
reer on the university romantic war
path, returned to her native lair; all
of which was a sufficiently plausible
excuse for a very beautiful and artistic
staging of this corner of California.
And that was the second act which, in
stage effects, surpassed the first, whilts
the musical numbers and the "feat
ures" were considerably more attrac
tive. In fact the producers of the piece
are to I o congratulated on the clever
ness with which they maintained an
evenly ascending scale of pleasing ef
fects throughout the evening.
It was a very well balanced perform
ance with very few hitches in which
all did their parts very well without
any one being preeminent. At least so
it seemed to the writer. Van Alstyne
(H. L. Reed and Duffy Sloan (L. G.
Gillelen) "put across" their jokes in
adroit fashion and they were good
jokes much appreciated by the aud
ience.
Duets and Solos Charming
.Miss Long and Mr. Krohn did very
good work throughout, and especially
in the doll chorus feature and the sen
timental tune "In the Moonlight."
which ended in a very pretty dance;
which, in turn was a queer ending for
a sentimental effusion —but that is a
way sentimental effusions have in mus
ical comedy. Billy Framing's (W. S.
Burns) singing after being afflicted
with nasality in the first act got mucn
better in the second, and was at its
best in the duet "Far From You" which
formed the sentimental climax of the
piece. Here the audience true to tra
dition emitted the suppressed "tee
hee" which lias greetecr the culminat
ing embrace of amateur heroes and
heroines ever since the days of Soph
ocles. It is discouraging to librettists
and composers and unfair to actors
and singers, but there is no help for it:
we can only call attention to the in
tense pathos of it.
Miss Harier had but little oppor
tunity to show her vocal attainments
but she was very much in evidence
contributing immensely to the life of
the performance, and in that she was
ably seconded by her partner Dick
Gardner (J. W. Bennett).
With the exception of Quitha's (E.
10. Tincher) one song, which made us
wish for more, all of the serious vocal
work of the play fell to the lot of the
heroine Veeda St John (Miss Hanna)
who showed a strong voice ot' very
pleasing quality, though slightly mar
red by a lack of clearness in enuncia
tion and in breath control.
The Indian dance of Chachee St John
(Miss Card) was, in the writer's opin
ion, the most notable and the most ar
tistic achievement of the evening.
In short it was a good show, and
a large proportion of the community is
indebted to the class of 1914 for a very
enjoyable evening.
