On behalf of Coach J. D. Peters, The
Daily Palo Alto wishes to thank the
men of the second team

and Peanut League
who practiced faithful-

ly all season. You fellows who did not
make the team may think your work
is in vain but it is your efforts that
have made made the Varsity team what
it is. it is a great honor to be a mem
ber of a team such as the one that
faces California tomorrow. But
whether you made the nine or pot you
have done your share and may be
rightly termed real Stanford men.
