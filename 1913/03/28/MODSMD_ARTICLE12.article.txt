# Over-eager

It is seemingly natural for us to
greet the members of our teams on

the eve of an approach
ing contest with such
salutations as "feeling

fit today," "you'll have to beat that
bunch," etc. Such remarks as these
tend to make the athletes nervous.
This is particularly true of track men,
(many of them have complained of it
already) but it applies to baseball
teams as well. We do not mean to say
that you shall not talk to the men on
the team, far from that. But when
you do converse with them jolly them
along 011 some more remote subject.
Their thoughts are 011 what is ahead
of them more than yours and they
don't need to be reminded of it. Let
them keep their minds off the race
as much as possible. More than one
good college team has suffered from
stage fright that has been superin
duced by over-eager and thoughtless
supporters.
