The Seniors won the Irish Mara
thon this morning for the third suc

the team was 55:4 seconds for each

nual interclass affair. A. R. Edwards,
'14 and J. M. Fitzhugh, '16 made the
fastest time for one lap, running the
distance in 52:3 seconds. Each will
receive a gold medal from the Quad
rangle Club. K. X. Davis, '16 crossed
the tape in 52:4 and won the silver
medal offered for the man making the
second best time. All competitors
were novice athletes and no varsity
men were allowed to compete.
Seniors, Freshmen, Juniors and
Sophomores was the order of finish.
The 1913 team took the lead on the
second lap and gradually increased the
lead until Cottrell crossed the line at
the end of the six miles a third of a
lap ahead of the Freshmen who placed
an easy second. The Juniors were the
tail enders until the twenty-second lap
when Clark passed McPberson of the
Sophomores.
The fun fest started with the bur
lesque appearance of the holdovers
as a sporty college bunch from the
south. Rah rah boys and girls gath
ered along the track twenty strong to
yell defiance at their opponents and to
cheer their colleagues on.
Results of the broad jump, hurdles,
quarter mile run at the tunnel, officials
judges and timers were typified as
they happened in connection with a
recent track meet.
G. V. Wallach, '12 in the role of a
440 negro sprinter easily caught the
slippery greased pig on his first dive
after the squealing hog. Lack of pep
in the porker and the fact that he had
been sat upon before he fairly got
away made the event all too short.
Four prize hens which had been
selected from among the best fowls on
the peninsula were let loose with a
score of students after them. Those
who made lucky catches were W. .T.
Finch, '15, L. D. Sweet, '13, S. S.
Brown. '16 and W. H. More, '15.
