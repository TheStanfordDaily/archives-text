# STANFORD WINS AGAIN
## CARDINAL VICTORS IN FIRST BALL GAME Varsity Comes From Behind and Knocks Ball to all Corners of Field 
### 
Confidence and the ability to hit the
ball won the first Intercollegiate base
ball game of the year for Stanford on
March 29 With a lead of three runs
at the end of the fifth inning, the Cali
fornia team was overtaken by the
Cardinals and lost the opening game
of the series on their own field, 9 to 4.
The Stanford players hit the ball for
a total of fourteen bingles, forcing the
Veteran Conklin from the box. Webb,
who succeeded him, was accorded a
royal welcome with a boquet of hits
and runs. He started his work with
one down and the bases full, and be
fore he had his half-inning rest, three
runs had been scored and his team was
no longer in the lead.
The Stanford battery, Maple and
Dent, got off to a bad start due to
nervousness, but settled down as the
game progressed. Maple went good
after the third inning and pitched ex
cellent ball, allowing but two more
hits and no runs. The Stanford twir
ler was tendered poor support at the
outset of the contest, but each inning
found him going better and the work
of the whole team improved likewise.

ing frame. Terry singled infield and
was forced at second by Argabrite

shoots for two bags, and Workman

same play Dent was caught at the plate

the fifth on his own single and Work
man's double.

the lead in the sixth. Halm started
with a single. McCloskey sacrified and
Maple singled infield. Terry walked,

Confidence and the ability to hit the
ball won the first Intercollegiate base
ball game of the year for Stanford on
March 29 With a lead of three runs
at the end of the fifth inning, the Cali
fornia team was overtaken by the
Cardinals and lost the opening game
of the series on their own field, 9 to 4.
The Stanford players hit the ball for
a total of fourteen bingles, forcing the
Veteran Conklin from the box. Webb,
who succeeded him, was accorded a
royal welcome with a boquet of hits
and runs. He started his work with
one down and the bases full, and be
fore he had his half-inning rest, three
runs had been scored and his team was
no longer in the lead.
The Stanford battery, Maple and
Dent, got off to a bad start due to
nervousness, but settled down as the
game progressed. Maple went good
after the third inning and pitched ex
cellent ball, allowing but two more
hits and no runs. The Stanford twir
ler was tendered poor support at the
outset of the contest, but each inning
found him going better and the work
of the whole team improved likewise.
Stanford Scored in First.
Stanford took the lead in the open
ing frame. Terry singled infield and
was forced at second by Argabrite
Workman reached first on Rubke's
error. Dent hit to short and Aarga
nr'te was caught at the plate. Cass
connected with one of Conklin's
shoots for two bags, and Workman
came home for the first run. On the
same play Dent was caught at the plate
for the third out.
California tied the score in her half
of the same inning. With one gone,
Adair walked, went to second on a
passed ball and on to third on Maple's
wild heave to second. Coane fanned,
but Dodson doubled, scoring Adair.
Shepherd ended the inning by fanning.
In the third, Stanford got three hits
but no runs. This was California's big
inning. Adair singled and Coane
sacrificed. Goodwin singled, Adair go
ing to third. The former then stole
second. Dodson worked the squeeze,
scoring the center fielder and arriving
safely on first. Dodson knocked the
ball from Terry's hands, landing safely
on second and Goodwin scored. Shep
herd walked and Coane flew to Beeger,
Dodson scored on the throw to the
plate. This ended the scoring for Cal
ifornia.
Argabrite tallied one for Stanford in
the fifth on his own single and Work
man's double.
Stanford scored three runs and took

the lead in the sixth. Halm started
with a single. McCloskey sacrified and
Maple singled infield. Terry walked,
filling the hases. At this stage of the
game Webb relieved Conklin. The Cal
ifornia man was nervous and uncorked
a wild pitch that scored Halm. Arga
brite struck out but reached first when
Sebastian lost the ball, Maple scoring.
Workman sent a long fly to left and
registered Terry.
The Stanford players took a likeing
to Webb's offerings and hit them to all
corners. In the seventh Heeger
ingled after one was down, Halm was
hit by a pitched ball and together with
Beeger scored on McCloskey's double,
the latter taking third on the throw
in. Maple flew out to center and Terry
walked, stole second and scored with
McCloskey on Argabrite's timely
single, Ihe latter being caught at sec
ond trying to stretch the hit.

fornia team was overtaken by the
Cardinals and lost the opening game

The Stanford players hit the ball for
a total of fourteen bingles, forcing the
Veteran Conklin from the box. Webb,

royal welcome with a boquet of hits
and runs. He started his work with
one down and the bases full, and be
fore he had his half-inning rest, three
runs had been scored and his team was
no longer in the lead.

after the third inning and pitched ex
