# STANFORD WINS AGAIN
## CARDINAL VICTORS IN FIRST BALL GAME Varsity Comes From Behind and Knocks Ball to all Corners of Field 
### 
Confidence and the ability to hit the
ball won the first Intercollegiate base
ball game of the year for Stanford on
March 29 With a lead of three runs
at the end of the fifth inning, the Cali
fornia team was overtaken by the
Cardinals and lost the opening game
of the series on their own field, 9 to 4.
The Stanford players hit the ball for
a total of fourteen bingles, forcing the
Veteran Conklin from the box. Webb,
who succeeded him, was accorded a
royal welcome with a boquet of hits
and runs. He started his work with
one down and the bases full, and be
fore he had his half-inning rest, three
runs had been scored and his team was
no longer in the lead.
The Stanford battery, Maple and
Dent, got off to a bad start due to
nervousness, but settled down as the
game progressed. Maple went good
after the third inning and pitched ex
cellent ball, allowing but two more
hits and no runs. The Stanford twir
ler was tendered poor support at the
outset of the contest, but each inning
found him going better and the work
of the whole team improved likewise.
