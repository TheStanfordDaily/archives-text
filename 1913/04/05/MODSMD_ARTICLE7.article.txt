# LAST CAMPUS DANCE AT THE ARWORY TONIGHT
## 
### 
The last informal Campus dance of
the year will be held in the Palo Alto
Armory this evening. The fact that
there are to be no more of these func
tions this semester assures a large
crowd. For the benefit of the many
people who only returned to the
Campus today, no programs have been
made out in advance. The cards will
be filled out on the floor and every
body will have an even chance
whether they have been around the
entire week or not. McDonald's
orchestra has been engaged for the
occasion and Ogier will serve light
refreshments. Special cars will be
on hand to convey the dancers back
to the Campus.
