# NOTES OF THE SERIES.
## 
### 
Argabrite caught the last ball in the
first game, and Captain Terry did like
wise in the second contest.
The California team was supported
by an exceptionally small number of
rooters on Saturday.
California used thirteen players dur
ing the two games, while Stanford did
not make a single change.
. . \V. Rubke. '14, has been chosen
captain of the California team for next
year.
Goodwin, with his three hits, and
Webb by his improved pitching, did the
best, work for the losers in the second
game.
Al. Gragg played in rightfield the
last of the ninth inning and won his
letter.
Coach Schaeffer said after the first
game in Berkeley last week that there
would be two more games. He is right,
but the second game does not come
until next year.
Five Stanford men, Maple, McClos
key, Gragg, Workman and Dent, played
this year in an Intercollegiate gamt
for the first time. Six California men,
Webb. Glenney, Young, Adair, Stevens
and Sebastian won their C's for the
first time. The last three are Fresh
men.
The last six Stanford men to face
Webb went out on flies, while the last
three California men did likewise.
Stanford won, and the Cardinal
looked to have the better team. They
fielded better, hit better and seemed
better acquainted with the inner
workings of baseball. II was Stan
ford's first baseball victory since
191 (», and too much credit cannot be
sent the way of Coach "Nig" Peters
and Captain Terry—(Leon T. Wing, in
S. F. Examner.)
Terry, Workman and Maple, that
splendid trio of university ball players
that supports the cardinal colors, were
the brilliants in the opening game of
the Berkeley-Stanford series. Each of
these players is being focused by hi'j
league scouts, Cincinnati wanting
Terry, Boston anxious to secure Work
man, and Connie Mack urging his look
out man to corral Maple for the Phila
delphia Americans.— (S. F. Chronicle.)
