The Daily Palo Alto desires to call
the attention of the management of the

Estate to the undesirableness
of the sheep corral that occu
pies a conspicuous place in

tlie aboretum beside the car line. The
corral is a necessary accessory of the
farm but it should be placed in a more
distant spot where it would be less ob
noxious and not so much of an eyesore.
