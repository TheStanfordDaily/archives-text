A short time ago we announced in
this column that an Alumni Directory

and four Quads had been
taken from the Daily Palo
Alto office and requested

that the person or persons who had the
books return them immediately. We
thought that the missing articles had
been borrowed by some one for tem
porary use and had carelessly forgot
ten to bring them back. But down to
date none of the missing articles have
appeared at this office. Evidently there
is a thief in (he student body for such
books as these could not lie desired
by any one else than a member of the
University.
A request having failed to locate
them we are forced to institute a still
hunt to recover the books, and the one
in whose possession they are found
will have to explain to the Council.
