# TENNIS TOURNAMENT IS
## 
### 
DATED FOR APRIL 23--'1
Representatives of Stanford ana
California met Saturday and definitely
decided to hold the intercollegiate
tennis tournament at Berkeley on
April 23 and 24. The date of this con
test has been hanging fire for some
time. California wanted the tourney
to take place prior to the track meet,
but this was unsatisfactory to Stan
ford for both Captain Sheldon and
Murray would lie unable to participate.
It will be impossible for these two
players to get in the best of shape in
lhe three days of practice after the
track meet but it is thought that they
can round into fair enough form to
take their opponents into camp.
The four men who are to represent
Stanford will be picked this week. At
present the rating is as follows: Mur
ray (1), Sheldon (2), Hutchinson (3),
and Halm (4).
