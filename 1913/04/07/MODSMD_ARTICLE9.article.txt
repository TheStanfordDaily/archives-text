## TWELVE PLAYERS WILL MAKE SUMMER TRIP. Notes and Clippings of the Recent Series.â€”Leon T. Wing Praises Cardinal Nine. 
### 
The victorious Stanford baseball
team is to invade Japan this summer.
Such was the news given out in the
training house to the players immed
iately after last Saturday's game.
Twelve players and Assistant Man
ager R. W. Wilcox will make the trip.
It is not certain whether Coach Peters
will be able to go or not. The men
will sail on the Nippon Maru on May
10. The return will be about August
first. The exact personell of the party
will be announced later.
All arrangements have been made
for an extensive tour of Japan and the
Hawaiian Islands. The trip will be
taken under the auspices of the Keio
University of Tokio and will include
games with the Waseda University
team and numerous other Oriental
nines. At Honolulu the Stanford
players will again oppose the Hawaiian
Chinese baseball team now playing
ball in this country. The Keio Univer
sity nine is a formidable one, many
of the players having played on United
States soil three years ago, when their
nine was touring this country. This
team was coached in 1910 by Art
Shafer, ex '14. Their trip here the
same year was a most successful one,
winning twenty out of the thirty
games played.
