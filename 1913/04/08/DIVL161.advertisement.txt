Omar Takes in a Burlesque Show
S/. mßk He piped off a Market Street Show from a Box.
"Why, look who's here?" called little Goldie Locks
Right from the Stage; "Thanksgiving's coming, Turkey!" ff^'%
He held an Omar up; "It's Here, Perox!"
If j|i That got the Crowd; "You're in the Wrong Pew, Bo," j||pp|i
Pfllp They yelled. "Climb out and get into the Show!''
ftp! He did a Smoke Dance with an Omar—say,
pppp The crowd went Wild, and wouldn't let him Go.
OMAR is the new value in Turkish blend cigarettes,
|S|pp Its price gives no indication of its unusual character.
