# Final Exes
## 
### 
With the announcement of the
schedule for final examinations comes

the semi-annual wail of
the students, each one
claiming that his arrange-

ment is the worst. And when we listen
to their cries we find that they are
not without reason. Many are com
pelled to take two exes in one day and
some have two a day for two or three
successive days.
In most courses the passing of the
final is essential to securing credit
for the course. Also many of the
exes cover the work of a semester and
in some cases the entire year. There
are many arguments against laying so
much stress on finals but we know of
no other scheme that could be em
ployed effectively in an institution the
size of Stanford.
But granted that the final examina
tion is necessary, and until a suitablb
substitute is found, we believe that it
is obviously unfair to the students to
have such an arrangement as con
fronts many of them. It is a mental
and physical impossibility for a per
son to do himself justice in his
courses when the work is piled up in
this way.
The fault for such an arrangement
is not attributed to the committee that
makes out the schedule. They do all
in their power to make an equitable
distribution, but it is impossible to
arrange a schedule in which severat
hundred tests are to be given in six
days and have the results satisfac
tory to very many.
The trouble with our system is that
the examination period is not long
enough. In our opinion an examination
period of ten days extending from a
Monday to a Wednesday of the week
following would be a most satisfac
tory arrangement for all concerned.
We realize that it would be im
possible for a change to be made this
year, but we would like to see the mat
ter thoroughly discussed before the
University Calendar for 1913-14 is
made out. This subject is of interest
to faculty and students alike. The
Daily Palo Alto welcomes communica
tions. If we are right in our criticism
we appreciate commendation; if
wrong, we likewise desire to have our
errors made known.
