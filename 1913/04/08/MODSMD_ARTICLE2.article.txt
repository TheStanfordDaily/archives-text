Word was today received from the
Keio University completing all
arrangements for the Stanford baseball
team's trip to Japan during the com
ing summer. The contract received
is favorable in every way and will be
accepted without change.
Keio University has guaranteed
$3,500 for the expenses. The Stanford
team is to leave on May 10 and re
main in Tokio thirty days. The
Varsity is to play not more than
twelve games, all of which are to be

later.
