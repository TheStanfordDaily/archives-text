# WILL TEACH PUBLIC SPEAKING NEXT YEAR
## L.E. BASSETT TO INSTRUCT IN FORENSICS. As a Resut of Petition New Work and Debating Credit Will be Given. 
### 
A sub-department of public speak
ing, in connection with the English
department, and with Professor Lee
Emerson Hassett as its head, is as
sured for next year. The installation
of the new department will come as
a result of the petition recently circu
lated by the debating interersts, and
signed by a majority of the students.
Professor Hassett will have an as
sistant, who will probably be a Stan
ford graduate and former varsity de
bater.
The awarding of credit for the work
in public speaking and debating will
be left within the discretion of the
English department. Professor Ras
sett has expressed himself as in favor
of giving university hours to those
making deflating teams. Such men
will conduct their preparations and
practice in connection with the regu
lar class work.
The instruction in debating and pun*
lie speaking will be upon a much more
elaborate scale than that attempted
while Professor Hassett was formerly
a member of the Stanford faculty. He
will be relieved of all such classes as
those in voice culture, and together
with the instructor to be selected will
devote his entire efforts to the new
work.
