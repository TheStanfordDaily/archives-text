To the two hundred and fifteen
high school athletes who are to be our

guests this week, Stanford
University bids welcome.
The gates of the campus

are thrown open and the privileges of
the Farm are yours. Above all, we
want you to feel at home during your
stay here.
A word to the undergraduates.
With the arrival of the Interscholas
tic entries, comes the question of
housing the preparatory athletes.
When thrown into such close contact
with these desirable men, there is
bound to be a strong tendency on the
part of the various fraternities and
clubs to "rush" their guests.
The Interscholastic Board of Governors
has passed a ruling to the effect that
there shall be no "rushing" and it has
been made one of the strongest fea
tures of the meet. This rule was passed
several years ago when the results of
"rushing" tactics threatened to dis
rupt the Interscholastic. Since then
the fraternities have strictly adhered
to it and there have been no diffi
culties on this score. If the men
will remember this and abide by
the rule of the Association, this meet
will be the best ever.
