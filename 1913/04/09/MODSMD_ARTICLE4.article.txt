# COACH O'DEA WILL NAME CARDINAL CREWS FRIDAY
## Oarsmen Are Well Seasoned by Vacation Practiceâ€”Three Shells Used Daily on Redwood Waters. 
### 
Eighteen men will be named next
Friday afternoon to represent Stan
ford on the Oakland Estuary, Satur
day morning, April 19. The oarsmen,
selected by Coach O'Dea and Captain
Duryea, will be given their positions
in the boats imfediately 011 their
arrival at liedwood for the Friday
afternoon workout.
Five days will then be left to them
for practice on home waiters. On
Wednesday, April 10, the crews will
journey to Oakland to spend the re
maining days. Headquarters will be
established at the Hotel St. Mark in
Oakland, and the new Stanford shell
will slip into the waters of the
course for the first time Wednesdaj
afternoon. Thursday and Friday will
find both crews in regular workouts
011 the estuary, familiarizing them
selves with the course.
The week of uninterrupted work
011 the estuary at Redwood, with
weather that was fairly propitious,
has given the twenty-four men 011 the
training table a heavy coat of tan
and has gone far toward making of
balanced and seasoned eights.
The past days of vacation came at a

crucial time in the development of the
oarsmen, and proved an invaluable
period to Captain Duryea and Coach
O'Dea. With the three eights in per
fect shape, it has been possible to
have an eight oared shell manned by
the candidates who are proving to
be near-varsity material on the water
every day, without interfering with
the work of the men who are conceded
to be leading in the race for the nine
seats.
Coach O'Dea has been at the tiller
in the varsity substitute shell, and
from his position lias been able to
direct the work of all three shells, as
they are kept abreast in the long
rows, with the substitute rowing in
the middle. The course has been
covered every afternoon, although 110
attempt was made to catch the time
for the three miles.
Rivalry furnishes abundant spirit
lor the long stretches. The second
varsity, by taking a handicap of a
length or two at the start, gives the
first shell a hard fight for the first
mile, and at. the end of (hat distance
the Freshmen wait, ready to cover the
last two miles in racing time.
