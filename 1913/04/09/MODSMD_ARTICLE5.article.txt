* World's Interscholastic record.

Judging by the list of entries and the
high caliber of performances made by
many of the high school athletes,
eight records will in all probability
be shattered in the Interscholastic
track and field meet on Saturday.
Ever since the Stanford Interschol
astic was inaugurated in 1906, Lee of
Harvard school has held the record of

4:39 for the mile run. Beebe of Ana
heim has covered the four laps under
4:34 several times this spring and is
counted on to repeat on the Stanford
cinder path. Other records which will
probably go are the half mile, broad
jump, shot put, pole vault. 100
and 220 yard sprints and discus
throw.
