names as against nineteen for last
year's tournaments. They represent
fifteen of the preparatory schools in
the state.

pick. The players who have been put
ting up a good exhibition of tennis this
spring are Pottrel of Cogswell, Det
rick of Drew's Coaching School, Johns
of Lowell, Murray of Palo Alto and
Stitch of Sacramento.
In order to run the matches off
within the specified time contests will
be played in Palo Alto as well as on
the campus. Through the courtesy of

1:30 on Friday afternoon and all the
matches will be played off by noon on
Saturday morning.
