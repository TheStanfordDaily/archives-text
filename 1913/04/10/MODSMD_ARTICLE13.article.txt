The Stanford Interscholastic was
founded eight years ago by W. H. B.

Fowler, 'OG, for the
purpose of fostering a
clean athletic spirit

among the youth of the West, and
spreading the healthful influence of
track athletics. In assembling so
many young men under a friendly and
conservative management the board of
governors hoped to aid them in form
ing academic friendships and to pro
vide, withal, a pleasant entertain
ment.
The success of the past seven Inter
scholastics has convinced the board
of the worth of its plan. Each year
it has profited by the experience of
the meet before and each spring has
found the Interscholastlc better than
the preceding one. Saturday the In
terscholastic will take place for the
eighth time. Many novel attractions
have been added; more prizes are to
be awarded; more athletes will com
pete; and the meet will be run off with
the same promptness and precision
thai has characterized the event in
the past.
Rut with the furnishing of the
mechanics of the meet, Stanford's side
of the affair must necessarily stop.
The Interscholastic is the High
Schools' meet not ours. What we
have done in a material way is for you
preparatory men to enjoy. We have
tried to make this affair mechanically
perfect. It is your competition that is
the real making of the meet and we
think that you are capable of making
this the best Interscholastic ever held
in the West.
