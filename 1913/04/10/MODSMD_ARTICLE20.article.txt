# CALIFORNIA MAN LECTURES ON IMMIGRATION PROBLEMS
## Professor Parker Shows Its Effects on American Industries and Labor. 
### 
"In recent years the proportion of
unskilled laborers has increased from
32 per cent, to 72 per cent. In 1907
73 per cent, of the immigrants were
male, and on the average 50 per cent,
leave the country again.
These laborers only want to get
all the money they can within a few
years, therefore they are not in
sympathy with strikes for shorter
hours, safely devises, an age limit,
pensions, nor with social improve
ment."
Speaking on "The Influence of Immi
gration on American Industries,'' Pro
fessor C. M. Parker gave the third lec
ture here in the exchange series by
professors of Stanford and California.
In the course of the lecture he
traced the labor tendencies in the
United States, showing the part in this
movement played by immigration.
"Trade unions of skilled laborers in
a certain profession were the first
form of organization. With the devel
opment of American industrial tech
nique and the growth of industrial
trusts beginning in 1898, the trade
unions began to die a natural death.
The rise of labor unions is the direct
result of the coming of technique and
the immigrant.
