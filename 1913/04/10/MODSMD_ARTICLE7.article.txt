# WASHINGTON CREW LEAVES FOR SCENE OF REGATTA
## ELEVEN MEN COME SOUTH WITH COACH CONIBEAR Record Time Made oil Lake Washington Raises High Hopes of Northern Supporters. 
### 
The University of Washington eight
leaves tomorrow morning on the
steamer President for Oakland, where
they are to compete in the regatta for
the Pacific Coast rowing champion
ship on April 19. Eleven of the
northern oarsmen, under the direction
of Coach Hiram Conibear, are mak
ing the trip.
The Seattle papers laud the univer
sity crew as being the best that has
been developed on Lake Washington
in years, and they predict that after
a week's workout on the Oakland
estuary, they will be fit to cross the
line in the three cornered race in rec
ord time. In a recent trial, the Purple
and Gold shell covered the three
mile course in the fast time of 16 min
utes and 31 seconds. This is 11 sec
onds faster than the time of the win
ning Cardinal crew of 1912.
The fact that only two "W" men are
pulling an oar in the shell makes it
impossible to judge just what factors
they will prove to be in the contest.
Captain Waller, who strokes, and Tay
lor at bow, are the two men who
helped to take a close second last year.
Rumors have come from the north
that after last year's race, Coach
Conibear modified the slow, smooth
stroke that marked the Washington
eight and adopted the hard, quick
catch of the "Dan Murphy" stroke. If
that be so, the chances of the north
erners are lessened in the eyes of the
Californians, for Poughkeepsie seemed
to prove that an unnaturally hard
catch lessened the efficiency of the
stroke. The test will come on April
19.
