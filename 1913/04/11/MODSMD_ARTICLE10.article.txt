Two events of more than passing in
terest are on the calendar for this

evening, the C'arnot de
bate with California
and the exhibition of

I?ig Game pictures.
The debate which takes place in the
Assembly Mall is the leading forensic
contest of the year. It has been four
years since a Stanford man has had
the honor of taking this prize, but this
evening promises a different story.
This is our year. We have yet to
lose a single contest to California this
season and tonight will be no excep

tion. The men who are to represent
Stanford in this event have worked
hard and they deserve the support of
the Student Body.
At the Palo Alto Armory, the Senior
Class will stage motion ipctpures of
last fall's "mud light." This enter
tainment promises to be of interest to
all, and as proceeds are to go to that
worthy cause, Senior Week, it should
receive more than a fair share of sup
port.
It is regretable that two events of
this caliher should fall on the same
evening, but the size of this Univer
sity is sufficient to furnish good audi
ences at both affairs if the students
will turn out as they should.
