# VISITING ATHLETES TO WITNESS PICTURES
## Senior Class Invites Preparatory School Men to First Exhibition of Remarkable Films. 
### 
Preparatory school athletes will be
the gues?ts of honor at the motion pic
tures of the Intercollegiate Rugby
game to be presented by the Senior
class in the Armory this evening.
Realizing that they will desire to re
tire early in preparation for the meet,
the Senior class has invited them to
the first show only. As the seating
capacity of the Armory is .">OO, there
will also be room for all others who
desire to attend this exhibition, which
begins at 7:lu. The second show
starts at S: 15. Admission to either
show to all except preparatory school
athletes is twenty-five cents. The
complete pictures of the Big Game
are remarkably clear and interesting.
