# CAMPUS DWELLERS WILL CHANGE BOARDING HOUSE
## 
### 
A general exodus of students to
Palo Alto between the hours of eleven
and two will be noticed Saturday,
when many of the campus eating
houses will resign in favor of the La
Liana Cafeteria at Fraternity Hall.
Home-made cakes and pastries, salads,
and all sorts of eatables tempting to
the "stude" will be served. Hot
drinks will cheer those who are
spending the day on the bleachers,
while stray athletes will find food
strictly in harmony with training
rules. The proceeds will be devoted
to the club house fund. Last year's
cafeteria was highly successful, and
the good mus-'ic and good eats attract
ed a large crowd.
