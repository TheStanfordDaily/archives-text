# COACH SELECTS VARSITY AND FRESHMAN CREWS FOR REGATTA
## Oarsmen Form A Well Balanced Eight O'Dea Expresses His Appreciation of 1913 Season's Work 
### 
Eighteen men to take seats in the
Varsity and Freshmen shells, and five
substitutes, were named by Coach
O'Dea at the regular practice at Red
wood this afternoon. The Varsity boat
will have one Senior, Captain Duryea,
one Junior, and six Sophomores at the
oars, while L. F. Reineman, who
coxed last year's victorious Fresh
men, will handle the tiller ropes.
The Freshmen, who have been
selected after months of the most
severe competition, still have a slight
element of uncertainty to keep them
on edge. Coach O'Dea emphasized
the fact that either or both substi
tutes might replace men now in the
boat.
The eight Varsity oarsmen who are
to wear the Cardinal a week from
tomorrow make up a machine of the
highest efficiency. From the point or
varsity experience, this year's crew
cannot be said to equal the Coast
Champions of 1912, but in other ways
they have advantages which seem
likely to make them the superior
eight.
Captain Duryea is an oarsman of
wide experience and great strength.

In Coach O'Dea the men have had the
services of one of the premier oars
men of the country, and the advan
tages which come with the cooperation
and instruction of such a man are in
calculable. And not least important,
is tiie long, lean, polished racing shell,
built by a famous firm in England,
and to he initiated to racing on that
Saturday morning. This master work
of the boatbuilder's art will play a
big part in the three mile struggle.
P. P. Clover, who pulls in the sec
ond seat, was varsity substitute for
last year's eight, and rowed in the

Stanford shell in the regatta at Pough
keepsie.
.letters, Rehm, Haggart, Jacomini
and Hulsman were all in the Fresh
man boat which was sent through the
estuary waters at such a clip just a
year ago. Olmsted who is stroke
in this year's Varsity, was captain of
the 1915 eight and stroked the shell
to a three-quarter length victory. His
form, after three months practice with
the new stroke, is above criticism.
The Fresh men.
The Freshmen, according to the
statement of Coach O'Dea, have been
easier to train than the Varsity can
didates. They have had no tradi
tions of the old Dan Murphy stroke to
confuse them, and have proven
especially apt at picking up the finer
points of the oarsmen's art. Compe
tition for all the positions has been
very keen, as is evidenced by the fact
that two of the seats are still in
doubt. The first year shell will not
have a weak spot in it on April 19.
The Stanford Stroke.
This year the Cardinal crews are to
use an entirely new stroke, which is
radically different from that used here
tofore. The stroke has not been
borrowed from Cornell or Wisconsin,
but is one adapted to conditions oi
this coast. The stroke is made up of
a long reach, a powerful drive, and a
slow recovery, most of the energy go
ing into the first half sweep of the oar.
The movement is remarkable for its
smoothness, all jerk and rush being
eliminated. It is based unon the prin
ciple of getting the greatest amount
of energy, and reducing to a mini
mum the checking of the run of the
boat between strokes.
At the end of the strenuous train
ing season. Coach O'Dea expressed ap
preciation of the work of all the candi
dates. "In spite of all difficulties, the
hearty co-operation of Captain
Duryea and the faithful work of the
men have made the preparation a
pleasure, rather than a task. They
have done all that has been asked of
them in a gentlemanly manner and
will go to the line ready to uphold
the honor of the Cardinal, fully en
titled to the absolute confidence of
the student body."

Eighteen men to take seats in the
Varsity and Freshmen shells, and five
substitutes, were named by Coach
O'Dea at the regular practice at Red
wood this afternoon. The Varsity boat
will have one Senior, Captain Duryea,
one Junior, and six Sophomores at the
oars, while L. F. Reineman, who
coxed last year's victorious Fresh
men, will handle the tiller ropes.
The Freshmen, who have been
selected after months of the most
severe competition, still have a slight
element of uncertainty to keep them
on edge. Coach O'Dea emphasized
the fact that either or both substi
tutes might replace men now in the
boat.
The eight Varsity oarsmen who are
to wear the Cardinal a week from
tomorrow make up a machine of the
highest efficiency. From the point or
varsity experience, this year's crew
cannot be said to equal the Coast
Champions of 1912, but in other ways
they have advantages which seem
likely to make them the superior
eight.
Captain Duryea is an oarsman of
wide experience and great strength.

In Coach O'Dea the men have had the
services of one of the premier oars
men of the country, and the advan
tages which come with the cooperation
and instruction of such a man are in
calculable. And not least important,
is tiie long, lean, polished racing shell,
built by a famous firm in England,
and to he initiated to racing on that
Saturday morning. This master work
of the boatbuilder's art will play a
big part in the three mile struggle.
P. P. Clover, who pulls in the sec
ond seat, was varsity substitute for
last year's eight, and rowed in the

Stanford shell in the regatta at Pough
keepsie.
.letters, Rehm, Haggart, Jacomini
and Hulsman were all in the Fresh
man boat which was sent through the
estuary waters at such a clip just a
year ago. Olmsted who is stroke
in this year's Varsity, was captain of
the 1915 eight and stroked the shell
to a three-quarter length victory. His
form, after three months practice with
the new stroke, is above criticism.
The Fresh men.
The Freshmen, according to the
statement of Coach O'Dea, have been
easier to train than the Varsity can
didates. They have had no tradi
tions of the old Dan Murphy stroke to
confuse them, and have proven
especially apt at picking up the finer
points of the oarsmen's art. Compe
tition for all the positions has been
very keen, as is evidenced by the fact
that two of the seats are still in
doubt. The first year shell will not
have a weak spot in it on April 19.
The Stanford Stroke.
This year the Cardinal crews are to
use an entirely new stroke, which is
radically different from that used here
tofore. The stroke has not been
borrowed from Cornell or Wisconsin,
but is one adapted to conditions oi
this coast. The stroke is made up of
a long reach, a powerful drive, and a
slow recovery, most of the energy go
ing into the first half sweep of the oar.
The movement is remarkable for its
smoothness, all jerk and rush being
eliminated. It is based unon the prin
ciple of getting the greatest amount
of energy, and reducing to a mini
mum the checking of the run of the
boat between strokes.
At the end of the strenuous train
ing season. Coach O'Dea expressed ap
preciation of the work of all the candi
dates. "In spite of all difficulties, the
hearty co-operation of Captain
Duryea and the faithful work of the
men have made the preparation a
pleasure, rather than a task. They
have done all that has been asked of
them in a gentlemanly manner and
will go to the line ready to uphold
the honor of the Cardinal, fully en
titled to the absolute confidence of
the student body."
