Tomorrow evening the Interschol
astic contestants are to be the guests

of Stanford at a vaudeville
entertainment in Encina Club
room. At this time the cups

and medals will be presented to the
winners and a rousing reception is in
store for all. Every event that had
been scheduled for Saturday evening
has been postponed and it behooves
every Stanford man to attend. Turn
out and give the boys a taste of real
Stanford spirit.
