To Stockton High School goes the
honor of winning the eighth Inter-

scholastic Track Meet
and with it the best
wishes of the Stanford

student body. We wish to congratu
late George Parker of Stockton, the
highest point winner. To have such an
athlete as he. is a credit to any school.
The meet as a whole was the best
that has ever been held at Stanford.
There was not a single incident to
marr the event, and every contestant
proved himself to be a true sportsman.
High school athletes, Stanford Uni
versity bids you good-bye, and invites
you to come again.
