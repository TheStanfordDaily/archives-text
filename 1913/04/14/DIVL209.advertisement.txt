Omar Takes in a Burlesque Show
|p |l|l||l He piped off a Market Street Show from a Box.
j "Why, look who's here?" called little Goldie Locks
Right from the Stage; "Thanksgiving's coming, Turkey!" |$j|||s
v He held an Omar up; "It's Here, Perox!"
That got the Crowd; "You're in the Wrong Pew, Bo,"
. They yelled. "Climb out and get into the Show!''
|* He did a Smoke Dance with an Omar—say,
The crowd went Wild, and wouldn't let him Go.
OMAR is the new value in Turkish blend cigarettes.
Its price gives no indication of its unusual character^
