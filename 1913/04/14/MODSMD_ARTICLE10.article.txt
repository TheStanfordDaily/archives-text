### 
Albert Bull, of Lowell High School,
won. the Stanford Intel-scholastic Ten
nis Tournament from Edward McCor
mick, of Los Angeles, yesterday after
noon by a score of 3-6, 7-5, 10-S. With
the score of 5-6 and 40-15 in the de
ciding set McCormick needed but one
point to capture the match but Bull
was equal to the occasion and evened
up the count and finally won the game.
After that each player took his serv
ice until the Lowell man broke in on
McCormick's in the seventeenth
game. A victory in the next game gave
Bull the Interscholastic champion
ship and the cup and gold medal which
goes with it. The runner-up received
a silver medal.
Two teams, Wilder and Rogers of
Thatcher and McCormick and Barber
of Los Angeles, still remain in the
doubles, owing to the fact that it was
necessary for the Thatcher duo to
leave before the match could be
played. As both teams are from the
south they will decide to whom the
doubles cup should go on April 24 at
Nordhoff in the Ojai Valley Tourna
ment.
Henry of St. Ignatius and Barber
of Los Angeles received bronze medals
for reaching the semi-final round in
the singles.
