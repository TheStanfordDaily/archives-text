Py the re-election of Z. A. Terry, '14,
to the captaincy of the Stanford base-

ball team another successful
season is assured for next
year. Zeb has proven to be

a great little captain, and the mem
bers of the team made a wise choice
in electing him to the position. A
natural ball player and clean athlete.
Terry has the absolute confidence of
every fan on the team, which is a most
essential qualification for a good
leader.
