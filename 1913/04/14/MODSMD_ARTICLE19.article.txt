# POLAR PICTURES WILL BE ON DISPLAY AT ARMORY
## 
### 
Fascinating motion pictures of the
Carnegie Expediton, which penetrated
the far North to secure- specimens of
Arctic fauna for the Museum at Pitts
burg, will again be shown at the Ar
mory on April 15 and 16.
The film depicts the voyage of the
stout power steamer "Polar Pear,"
and its passage up the beautiful Alas
kan coast, where abound enormous
herds of seals and screaming water
fowl. The trip continues to Wrangl
Island, Nome, and up to within
eighteen degrees of the Pole. The
hunt of the magnificent moose, the life
among the Igloos of the north, the im
mense herds of walrus, and the excit
ing pursuit of the swimming and
diving polar bear in order to seize
from her her young cub are thrown
upon the screen with a vivid realism
that is startling.
The cleverness with which these un
usual pictures were taken by the man
behind the camera is attested by the
fact that one of the pictures discovers
a hungry polar bear within several
feet of the photographer.
