# Key Down
## 
### 
This week is the most important time
of the year for the men who are to

represent Stanford in
track and crew next Sat
urday. All the athletes

are just about on edge and the next
few days will see them brought into the
pink of physical condition. Hut there
is another element which is just as im
portant to each contestant as physical
perfection, and it is one in which the
rest of us can play a large part. That
is their mental fitness. Many star
athletes have fallen down at the
crucial moment because of nervous
ness. Often times this condition is
brought on by friends who insist upon
giving vent to their patriotism. The
more the events of next Saturday are
talked over by the students the bet
ter, for it serves to stimulate bleacher
spirit. Hut drop your discussion when
in tbe presence of the contestants.
Every reference to the meet or the
regatta, naturally unnerves the men
when they are keyed up to such a
high pitch and this is just what the
trainers are fighting against. To win
Saturday will require physical and
mental perfection. The trainers can
bring about the former, it is up to us
to help with the latter. A little judge
ment in our speech will aid materially.
Another thing, the athletes need
plenty of sleep these next few nights.
Music and other disturbances on the
campus should be dispensed with
until after April 19.
