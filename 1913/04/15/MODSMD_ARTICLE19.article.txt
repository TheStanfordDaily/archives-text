# EYES, ORBS THAT SPARKLE AND BEWITCH, IN THIS PLAY
## Blue Optics Predominate and Translate Lover's Love Laid in Buda Pesth. 
### 
Seven sisters of varied, but unas
sailable charms comprise the feminine
element that coquets through the in
tricate conspiracies of the Senior farce
that will be played on the evening of
May 14. Of course there is a Spartan
mother also. Such a delectable bevy
of creatures as exists in this Hungar
ian fantasy of beautiful women would
lose half of their charm if the audience
couldn't see them deliberately work
wonders with their eyes in spite of
a frowning mother.
Eyes are a dominant aid in the art of
making love. The fact that the author
of "Seven Sisters," in his remote
Hungarian home endowed the women
of his play with eyes that can sparkle
with mischief, soften with sympathy,
and beam with love makes it possible
for the English translation to retain
a rich beauty of love plots.
Lovers in the neighborhood of Buda
Pesth may talk in phrases that can't
be translated with any share of justice,
but attractive eyes speak a language
more universal than Esperanto. That
is especially true of blue eyes.
Six of the sisters who will appear
on the Stanford stage have blue eyes.
So has the mother for that matter but
we are not considering her now.
When the first curtain rises, four of
the sisters are old enough to use their
beautiful eyes to advantage with in
telligence. The people in the play live
so fast during their four act life that
the other three daughters don't grow
sufficinetly to cast any glamouring
glances.
