# REVENUE CUTTERS TO PATROL COURSE OF COLLEGIATE RACES
## Officials are Chosen for the Regatta on Estuaryâ€”Stanford Varsity Heaviest of Three Eights 
### 
The United States government,
through its revenue officials at San
Francisco, has formally notified the
crew officials at California and at
Stanford of its willingness to take en
tire charge of the course of the Inter
collegiate races on next Saturday
morning. The offer has been accept
ed by the rowing authorities. This
means that the government revenue
cutter "Golden Gate" will be stationed
at the end of the Oakland Estuary an
hour before the first scheduled race,
blocking the entrance to all vessels,
and effectutally preventing the dis
turbance of the waters of the course
by plodding stern wheelers, ferry boats,
or sight seeing launches.
Contrary to precedent and to the
i>robable expectations of many sight
seers on the launches, the various
craft will not be allowed to follow the
Freshmen shells to the finish, to re
turn to the starting line again and oc
compan.v the Varsity shells. The
course is not to be crossed from the
time of closing, at 9:10, until after the
Varsity boats have passed in the sec
ond race. This means that the obser
vation trains will this year furnish a
sightseeing point that will probably
not be excelled.
The l'atrol.
Three other government motor boats
will patrol the course, keeping the
three-mile stretch clear. This policy
of making business subsidiary to col
legiate sports for a time, was inaugu
rated last year, when the harbor offi
cials were notified that collegiate
sports were to be given the right of
way over traffic for limited periods,
provided the proper application was
made.
The race course has been buoyed for
the entire distance, from the Webster
street bridge, to the end of the West
ern Pacific .Mole. This will prevent any
cutting of corners, and will also keep
the shells out cf midstream where the
tide runs strong.
The officials for the regatta were
chosen last night at a meeting of the
rowing representatives of the three
universities. E. .1. Scully is to be the
referee; Dean Witter, starter; Prof
essor T. Putnam, W. Magee, and J.

Houston, timers; Professor G. O'Neil,
D. M. Folsom, and J. Elliott, judges
of the finish. The judges will this year
be stationed at the finish line, at the
end of the Western Pacific and Ala
meda piers.
Time of Knees.
Rain or shine the two Freshmen
shells will he sent from their starting
point one mile below the Webster
street bridge, promptly at 9:30. The
order of the races has been reversed,
as last year the first year men raced
after the Varsity contest. The finish
line is the same for both crews.
Washington on Estuary.
The Washington eight, with two sub
stitutes, reached San Francisco Sun
day on the steamer "President," and
yesterday took a trial spin on the
Estuary. Coach Conibear is again in
charge of the northern oarsmen, and
is as enthusiastic as ever over their
chances for victory.
The crew is considerably heavier
than the 1912 combination, which
rowed such a close second last year.
Captain Waller was the heaviest man
in the boat a year ago, but this year,
at 170 pounds, he is the fifth in weight.
The average weight is 171 ponds, as
compared to the IG2 average of last
year.
Weights.
Stanford will have the heaviest
Varsity, the eight husky men at the
oars averaging 173 pounds. This is
only seven-eights of a pound to the
man lighter than the 1912 Varsity.
Captain Duryea, in the fifth slide, is the
heavy man of the eight, tipping the
scales at 185. Stroke Olmsted is the
featherweight, at 157 pounds. The
weights have been carefully graded,
the heaviest men being in the waist
of the boat, with two light weights in
the bow.
The California Varsity, taking the
very probable line-up, will average
169 pounds to the man, as compared
to last year's mark of 176. This means
that the Blue and Gold oarsmen will
be the lightest of the three eights.
The Stanford Freshmen average
166, five pounds lighter than the 191."
eight. The California Babes, taking a
probable line-up, will reach 162.
