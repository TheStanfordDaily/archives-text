# STANFORD CREWS LEAVE FOR OAKLAND
## 
### 
Eighteen oarsmen and five substi
tutes who are to represent Stanford
in the triangular regatta next Satur
day morning, left the campus today for
the scene of the races. The last prac
tice spin on the Redwood slough was
made yesterday afternoon. This morn
ing the two shells were placed on
board a tug boat and started for Oak
land. The Freshmen crew also went
up on the tug to take care of the
shells.
The boats are to be taken to the
"Amador," the California boat house,
where the Stanford men will finish
their training. The crews will make
their headquarters at the Hotel St.
Marks, in Oakland. Trial spins will be
taken over the course every afternoon.
Captain Duryea stated before his de
parture this morning, that every man
was in the best of condition and he was
confident that the Cardinal oarsmen
would register another double victory
Saturday.
The Washington eight has been
working out on the Estuary since last
Sunday and are reported to be in fine
fettle. Yesterday the members of the
northern crew visited the Stanford
campus for a few hours. The trip
around the bay was made by automo
bile.
The California teams have not been
definitely decided upon, and no offi

cial announcement will be made until
after the last practice Thursday but
the most probable line-up is that pub
lished below. Any change in the
eight will be announced in The Daily
Palo Alto Friday evening.
Three and five are the positions
which may possible be changed. Lyons
or Craig may supplant Merritt at three
and Denman may be used in five in
stead of Williams.
