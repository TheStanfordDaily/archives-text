# CLASS DISCUSSES THE SENIOR WEEK PROGRAM
## Special Assessment Levied to Defray Expensesâ€”Barbecue Eliminated from Program. 
### 
Reports of committees were heard
and discussions in regard to Senior
Week indulged in, by the Seniors at
their meeting this noon. The treas
urer's report showed the finances of
the class to be in average condition.
An assessment of two dollars was
levied upon each member to be used in
defraying expenses of Senior Week.
The "usual Senior Week assessment is
two dollars in excess of this. All who
pay this levy will be considered mem
bers of the class in good standing and
will be given a handsome leather
bound souvenier program of the events
of the big week.
Owing to the already over-crowded
condition of the Senior Week calendar,
it was decided to cancel the barbecue
which has been planned for the after
noon of Carnival Day.
