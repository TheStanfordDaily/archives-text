The company of English actors,
whom the English Club has obtained
for the first time in several years,
were enthusiastically received by for
mer Stanford audiences. Working to
gether in Shakesperian drama for a
number of years under the direction of
Ben Greet, one of the greatest living
authorities on Elizabethan drama,
these players have become noted for
their interpretation of the classical
drama.
Well known in England for twenty
years, Ben Greet first appeared in
America through his presentation of
the old mortality play "Everyman"
under the mangement of Charles
Frohraan. This was followed by
numerous productions of Shakes
pearean plays and classical comedies.
Leonard Shepherd plays the leading
role of the old merchant, Aegon in
"The Comedy of Errors." Creighton
I lale and Percival Vivian are unus
ually fitted for the comedy parts of
the two Dromios by their own remark
able physical likeness to each other.
Shakespeare's humor is as immortal
as his tragedy, and in no other play
does he come so perilously near the
ridiculous. No modern dramatist with
out the great bard's incomparable wit
and delightful drolleries could write
such r. play without falling headlong
into the ludicrous.
"The Comedy of Errors" is one of
the most clever of Shakespeare's
comedies and one of the best known.
Everyone has heard of the two
Dromios who were as like as two peas,
and of their two masters who were
also the image of one another. The
master and servant from Syracuse
who discovers their twin brothers in
Ephesus, and the wife who believes
her husband indifferent and demented
until she learns that it was her hus
band's brother all the time who dis
claimed relationship, are some of the
situations that produce splitting
laughter.
The whole ludicrous tangle and the
"who's who" and the "why's why" are
happily settled in the end.
