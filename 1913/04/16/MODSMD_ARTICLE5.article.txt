# TALES OF STANFORD LIFE BY IRWIN AND FIELDS TO REAPPEAR
## 
### 
"Stanford Stories," by Charles K.
Field, '95, and Will Irwin, '99, which
has long been out of print, is to be
made available once more through the
efforts of the English Club. The new
edition will be published by A. M. Rob
ertson of San Francisco, who has ob
tained the rights of the book from the
original publishers, Doubleday, Page
and Company. The English Club
obtained the cordial consent of the
authors to reissue the volume.
The new edition will be very similar
in appearance to the original issue and
will contain the same cuts and pictures
of the Quad and other campus scenes
which illustrated the stories in the
first edition. The size of the volume
will be somewhat increased by the in
clusion of two additional stories, writ
ten after the authors had left college
and had become men of literary prom
inence.
"Stanford Stories" the first collection
of tales of college life on the Palo Alto
Farm, will always hold a place undis
puted by any successors, since it not
only interprets our own campus life in
a manner that remains perennially
true, but it also presents a picture of
that life in the midst of scenes and
conditions of the first year of the
University, which have now, many of
them, disappeared or been hidden by
the accretions o,' years. It was the
pirn.*: r volume <T Stanford fiction and
has preserved in colors that are re
markably true for young writers a
picture of the pioneer Stanford years.
The first edition found a ready sale, be
cause the stories were intrinsically in
teresting to readers of widely varying
temperaments and interests; with the
passing of years the book lias gained
additional value as history, since it re
produces a life, many features of which
have passed away.
The sale of the entire edition will be
managed by the English Club, for
which Mr. Robertson is bringing out
the book. The price has been set at
$1.25.
