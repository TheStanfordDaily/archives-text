Baseball is a grand game, but like
everything else it has its proper place.

The lawns along Lasuen
street cannot be classed as
suitable locations for ball

parks, although they seem to be taken
as such 1)y many of the men on the
Row. At almost any time of the day,
but particularly at the noon hour when
there is more travel up Lasuen than at
any other time, many fellows may be
seen batting flies or playing "one ole
cat."
Acting upon complaints registered by
passers-by, (he Conference last year,
passed a resolution against batting
balls on the Row. The men respond
ed and confined their attentions to
playing catch. Lately the practice has
been renewed with the result that yes
terday two women were struck by bat
ted balls. Fortunately neither were
seriously injured, but these incidents
serve to show the danger of the sport.
Sooner or later some one will lie badly
hurt and drastic action will be taken by
the Trustees.
There are any number of vacant
fields around here where the men can
enjoy this sport without endangering
anyone, but it cannot be permitted on
the front lawns. Playing catch is a
harmless pastime but batting must
stop.
