# STANFORD PAVES WAY FOR SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTE
## Cardinal Point is Gained and Football Rules Will Stand Until Changed. 
### 
Last evening the Executive Commit
tee paved the way to an early settle
ment of the football dispute by ac
cepting one of the four alternatives
which the California Committee had
stated that they would agree to. The
letter from the University of Califor
nia Executive Committee which was
received during the spring vacation,
contained two proposals from that
body and also included the two meth
ods of settlement which the Stanford
Committee had previously recom
mended to California. Stanford's pro
posals were: (1) that a non-parti
san arbitration board be appointed to
decide the questions of interpretation
and both institutions to abide by its de
cisions; and (2) that the disputed
section of the Intercollegiate Agree
ment be made to express clearly that
the rules continue in force during the
life of the present agreement or until
changed by the Rules Committee.
California stated in the letter that
they would accept either of these
propositions but preferred that two
methods recommended by themselves,
namely, (1) that a Board of Rugby
experts rewrite the rules, and that the
Universities should then agree as to
the duration of the rules and the
powers of the Football Rules Commit
tee, and that this agreement hold until
the expiration of the entire agreement
in January, 1915; and (2) that Stan
ford's contention that the game of
1913 be played under the 1911 rules
be accepted, but upon the understand
ing, that, thereafter the rules shall be
considered as lapsing, and requiring
re-enactment to be in force in 1914.
Neither of the two schemes proposed
by California would be satisfactory
for in each case the same question of
interpretation would come up again
and an acceptance of either would
only postpone the present disagree
ment another year. Of the two meth
ods advocated by Stanford, the sec
ond is the most advisable for, as Cali
fornia has stated that this idea was
acceptable it would only require the
insertion of one sentence in the dis
puted section to arrange matters sat
isfactorily to both.
Following is the motion passed by
the Stanford Executive Committee.
The section abrogated by California
remains as it was except that the
sentence in black face type has been
added. The inclusion of this sentence
embodies in the agreement what Stan
ford has contended for all along, that
the football rules like all other rules
hold until changed and are not to be
completely re-enacted each year to suit
the whims of either party.
Moved, seconded and passed: That
of the four alternatives offered by the
Executive Committee of the University
of California in their letter of April 3,
the following be recommended:
That Article I, Section I, of sub
sections (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) of the
Intercollegiate Agreement remain the
same as before abrogation, and that
sub-section F of the same section
read as follows:
The President of the Associated
Students of each University shall ap
point a committee of three, consisting
of the captain and coach of the foot
ball team for the ensuing year, and
one alumnus. These representatives
shall be known as the Football Rules
Committee, and shall have power to
enact, regulate, change and interpret
and publish the rules governing foot
ball. These rules shall remain In
force from year to year except as
changed by the football rules commit
tee. This committee shall meet an
nually on the first Saturday in Sep
tember.
Other business transacted follows:
Meeting called to order by President
Ambrose.
Roll call —Frank, Duryea, Jacomini,
Clover, and Templeton absent.
H. S. Chapman, '14, appointed to the
Board of Directors of the Stanford
Guild to succeed W. R. Chandler, '13.
Ambrose was instructed to answer
the letter of the High School De
bating League of California asking for
permission to hold the final debate for
the Stanford Cup in San Francisco in
stead of in the Assembly Hall as both
the contesting schools are in the city.
Petition to make basketball a minor
sport, laid on the table.

Last evening the Executive Commit
tee paved the way to an early settle
ment of the football dispute by ac
cepting one of the four alternatives
which the California Committee had
stated that they would agree to. The
letter from the University of Califor
nia Executive Committee which was
received during the spring vacation,
contained two proposals from that
body and also included the two meth
ods of settlement which the Stanford
Committee had previously recom
mended to California. Stanford's pro
posals were: (1) that a non-parti
san arbitration board be appointed to
decide the questions of interpretation
and both institutions to abide by its de
cisions; and (2) that the disputed
section of the Intercollegiate Agree
ment be made to express clearly that
the rules continue in force during the
life of the present agreement or until
changed by the Rules Committee.
California stated in the letter that
they would accept either of these
propositions but preferred that two
methods recommended by themselves,
namely, (1) that a Board of Rugby
experts rewrite the rules, and that the
Universities should then agree as to
the duration of the rules and the
powers of the Football Rules Commit
tee, and that this agreement hold until
the expiration of the entire agreement
in January, 1915; and (2) that Stan
ford's contention that the game of
1913 be played under the 1911 rules
be accepted, but upon the understand
ing, that, thereafter the rules shall be
considered as lapsing, and requiring
re-enactment to be in force in 1914.
Neither of the two schemes proposed
by California would be satisfactory
for in each case the same question of
interpretation would come up again
and an acceptance of either would
only postpone the present disagree
ment another year. Of the two meth
ods advocated by Stanford, the sec
ond is the most advisable for, as Cali
fornia has stated that this idea was
acceptable it would only require the
insertion of one sentence in the dis
puted section to arrange matters sat
isfactorily to both.
Following is the motion passed by
the Stanford Executive Committee.
The section abrogated by California
remains as it was except that the
sentence in black face type has been
added. The inclusion of this sentence
embodies in the agreement what Stan
ford has contended for all along, that
the football rules like all other rules
hold until changed and are not to be
completely re-enacted each year to suit
the whims of either party.
Moved, seconded and passed: That
of the four alternatives offered by the
Executive Committee of the University
of California in their letter of April 3,
the following be recommended:
That Article I, Section I, of sub
sections (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) of the
Intercollegiate Agreement remain the
same as before abrogation, and that
sub-section F of the same section
read as follows:
The President of the Associated
Students of each University shall ap
point a committee of three, consisting
of the captain and coach of the foot
ball team for the ensuing year, and
one alumnus. These representatives
shall be known as the Football Rules
Committee, and shall have power to
enact, regulate, change and interpret
and publish the rules governing foot
ball. These rules shall remain In
force from year to year except as
changed by the football rules commit
