# MISS DOROTHEA SPINNEY INTERPRETS HIPPOLYTUS
## The 						English Artist's Charming Portrayal is Witnessed by a Large Audience. 
### 
An audience which overflowed the
seating capacity of the chapel listened I
last night to Miss Dorothea Spinney's
dramatic interpretation of Euripides'
Hippolytus. Gowned in a simple robe
of classical design and with no prop
erties other than two great waxen
tapers the artist charmed the audience j
with her versatile portrayal of Greek
tragedy.
The grace and youthful impulsive
ness of Hippolytus, the hero, who re
fuses to pay tribute to the statue of
Aphrodite were pictured by appro
priate gesture and voice. From the
well poised Hippolytus the actor in
stantly turns to an impersonation of
the old Huntsman with bended back
and rude manner. The speech of the
weary Phaedra in mental anguish as
she lay restless on her couch was well
contrasted with the abrupt speech and
movement of the attending nurse.
The scene between the impassioned
Theseus and his son Hippolytus at the
point where Theseus coolly folds his
arms and faces his son brought forth
a wealth of dramatic ability. To the
calm utterances of the Goddess
Artemis the interpreter added an ab
solute majesty of pose as she stood
with outstretched arms. The beauti
ful rendition of the weird chants added
the final charm to the interpretation.
