# PICK OF STANFORD ATHLETES ARE READY FOR ANNUAL MEET
## 
### 
Stanford and California track rep
resentatives will contest in the twen
tieth annual track and field meet on
Saturday afternoon on the Berkeley
oval. Both Universities will send on
the field well balanced teams, num
bering among the contestants some
of the star college athletes of the
country. Just who will win is the ques
tion which is perplexing the track
devotees on the eve of the greatest
competition. Experience has proven
that tlie pre-meet prognostication or
"dope sheet" is a waste of time and

paper. Followers of both squads, how
ever, have figured the meet for them
selves and to a Cardinal adherent the
prospect has a most roseate hue.
The Stanford team coached by the
veteran, "Dad" Moulton, conditioned
by Trainer H. W. Maloney and lead by
Captain E. P. Campbell, '13, one of the
hardest working generals who has
ever commanded a Cardinal aggrega
tion is ready for the closest of compe
tition. The number of first year stars
on whom reliance is placed is larger
than in previous years, but the team
is well balanced by veterans who may
be relied on to steady the new men
representing their university for the
first time.
Those who have spent time figur
ing on the results of the meet have
reached various conclusions. Many
predict that Stanford will win by ten
points. Taking into account the con
dition of the men, the fact that Stan

ford will be meeting the Blue and Gold
athletes on their own track, the possi
bility of changes in the placing of the
men relied on, the customary "sur
prises" and a comparison of the work
of the rival athletes victory should
come to the Cardinal by at least a
62 to GO score. This is made on a
basis of giving California the benefit
of every doubtful point. There are
some, who, relying on certain reports
from the camp of the Blue and Gold
squad, look" for the Cardinal landslide.
The Mile.
According to the Intercollegiate
schedule the mile run will lie the ini-
I tial event of the afternoon. Wilson, L,
| Murray, Price, Worthy and Irwin will
be the reliances of Stanford. Against
this quintet the most likely opponents
are Captain Harry Wood and Saxon.
Last year Murray took a good third to
Wood in the record breaking four-lap
race. Wilson, the Portland Freshman,
lias been timed around the 4:30 mark
and many look to him to win the first
race of the meet for Stanford.
In the sprints Captain Campbell,
McKee, McNair and R. Needham are to
measure speed with the three best
California century and furlong men,
"Fui" Woods, Stanton and Wadsworth.
ueports have it that Stanton will not
be in pink of condition on Saturday.
Campbell and McKee are consistent
performers around the even time mark
and the Intercollegiate records stand
exposed to an erasure.
Against the Cardinal Freshmen,
Whitted, holder of the world's Inter
scholastic high hurdle record, F.
Murray, Norton and Urban and R. R.
Templeton, '15, Eddie Beeson will pit
bis veteran experience for the sake of
California. Preble is the second best
opponent, but the odds seem in favor
of Stanford to annex the majority of
points.
Quarter Milers.
One of the best races of the meet
promises to be the 440-yard dash.
Captain Campbell, "Mickie" McClure,
Gard, G. Needham, Robb and Stammer
are the Stanford entries. Todd, win
ner of the event last year, Freshman


"DAD" VOFLTOX.
Clark and Meyer are the -best of the
opposing dash men. Clark has "comr
through" with a rush and is carrying
many hopes of the California rooters.
Campbell and McClure are a duo
which can be relied 011 to look well to
the interests of the adherents of
"Dad's" team.
Dodge, Wilson, Cox, Foster, and
Bassett will face the starter as the
Stanford representatives in the two
mile grind. Crabbe, who was forced
to make a new record in this event
last season by Dodge, is again the
mainstay of Christie's distance men.
Before coming to college Wilson had
an enviable record as a two mller and
il he is right the "dope" stands in
danger of another upset. A week ago
Dodge set a new Stanford record by
covering eight laps in 9:59:4.
Bonnett and McClure have both
recorded better times in the half mile
than any of the California 880-yard
men. They will be backed by L. Mur
ray, Angell and Irwin, and Stanford
seems safely assured of a least six
points in this event.
The relay team is problematical, .lust
who will be members of the team will
not be announced until the time for
the race. The list of probabilities in
cludes Captain Campbell, McClure,
Richdale, Robb, Chace, Stammer,
Gard and CI. Needham.
Field Events.
In the hammer-throw Stanford will
send Freshmen Drake and King
against the record holder Shattuck.
The latter has made far the best
throws during the present season and
the Cardinal chances of points must
rest on the second and third places.
Bedeau, Sheldon, Campbell, Smith
and Downing will toss the shot, for
Stanford. This evenâ€ž is uncertain as
California has shown but one man,
Thomas, to any advantage. Lockhart
seems to be a "dark" horse. Bedeau
and Sheldon are well able to care for
the Cardinal points in this event. The
former will not spring a surprise 011
the followers of track if he should
annex first place.
The pole vault and broad jump show
an advantage for the Cardinal. In the
altitude climb Miller has done better
than any of liis opponents, and he will
be assisted by Stevens, a point winner
last year, Te npleton and the first
year men, Krohn, Phillips, Tufts, and
Macomber. Bangs and Young are the
best of th? Californians. Miller
should take first place with the indi
cations pointing to a division by a tie
of the remaining points. Dawson,
Argabrite, Knight and Dingley will
give Fred Allen, the Blue and Gold
reliance, plenty of cause for worry,
in (lie broad. Dawson has bettered
the best jump made by Allen, and
Argabrite, only last week, exceeded
the twenty-three foot mark.
California will send forth a strong
entry list in the high jump in the per
sons of Beeson, Hill, Ariola and Me-
Fie. All have done better than six
feet. Finney, also jumping higher
than six feet, Templeton, numbered
among the most likely surprises,
Dingley, Argabrite and F. Murray con
stitute the Cardinal athletes who will
contest in this event.
