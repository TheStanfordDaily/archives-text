# BEN GREET OFFERS CLASSIC COMEDY
## 
### 
lien Greet's splendid organization of
English players comes to the Stanford
Assembly Hall Monday evening after
a metropolitan season that won
glowing approval from ttie New York
critics. Shakespeare's "Comedy of
Errors" will be the offering at Stan
ford. It bas been the most successful
bill in the repertoire of Shakespearian
dramas and classic comedy which Hen
Greet has received this season.
For many years the Ben Greet play
ers have been the favorite interpreters
of classic drama on the American and
English stage. This company was the
first to prove that the plays of the
bard mean prosperity to capable
managers instead of spelling ruin as
in the past.
A notable feature of the Ben Greet
performances has always been that the

actors speak clearly, and with intelli
gence.
Greet's company has had unique
success, and lias gained popularity
seldom equalled in the history of the
theater. The aim has always been to
j furnish entertainment to audiences of
1 taste and intelligence which have sel
' (loin failed to appreciate the honest
! values of Hen Greet performances.
The solid and dignified quality that
j marks the plays of the organization
shows the ability of the trainer and
manager.
Following the drawing for num
bers this afternoon at 1 o'clock, ticket
were put on sale both at the Book
store and at Weingartner's. The usual
Assembly Hall prices of 50 cents, 75
cents, and one dollar will obtain for
the performance Monday evening.
