# FERRIES OFFER CHOICE OF ROUTES TO REGATTA
## Crew Spectators Must Leave Campus by 6:58 A.M.â€”First Race Scheduled for 9:30. 
### 
Saturday morning will see a great
exodus from the campus, and to
handle the Berkeley-bound crowds
properly, special arrangements have
been made with the Southern Pacific
for additional service.
As the first crew race is scheduled
for 9:30, the start to be made at the
Webster street bridge in Oakland,
those wishing to arrive at the course
in plenty of time must take the train
leaving Palo Alto at 6:35. This train
arrives in San Francisco at 7:35, and
allows ample time for connections at
the Ferry Building for the trip across
the bay. The next train passes
through Palo Alto at G:5B, and is the
last that may be taken by the regatta
sightseers. This train would mean
closer connections, and leaves little
time at the course before the race.
Cars connecting with the 6:35 and
G:5B trains leave the campus at 6:20
and 6:40.
The best, route across the bay is the
Alameda ferry, which runs into the
slip on the Alameda side just at the
finish line of (he race.
Xo better point could be found for
viewing the race than the Alameda
pior, which extends along one side of
the Estuary for over a mile. On the
Western Pacific Mole the observation
trains are to be run. Tickets on the
trains have been sold in advance and
California has exhausted the seating
capacity.
The Webster street bridge may be
reached from the Oakland Mole, by
taking the Alameda electric inter
urban, and this point would offer a
view of the start of the Varsity race.
The Freshmen start a mile below the
bridge.
The most convenient way of reach
ing the starting point is to take the
Creek ferry, leaving from the slip at
the end of Clay street, just to the left
of the main Ferry Building. The trip
across on this ferry takes about forty
minutes.

Three launches were chartered by
private parties for the morning, and
tickets to the limit of their capacity
were sold within a few days. As the
tickets to these boats were sold before
the regulation was made prohibiting
a'l craft from following the first race,
these boats will be given certain
privileges consistent with the proper
patrolling of the course.
