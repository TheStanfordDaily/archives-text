With the action of the Stanford
Executive Committee last evening the

football situation seems
to be on a fair way to a
speedy and equitable

settlement. If California's last letter
is to be taken as a criterion, and we
believe that it is, the Blue and Gold
powers have taken a fair view of the
matter, and have seen the weakness
of their former position.
The course that the Stanford com
mittee adopted is by far the best of
the four, and is one of the two meth
ods of settlement that we have been
contending for throughout. Rules
governing any form of proceedings are
always considered to be in force until
changed, but the addition of the one
sentence to the disputed section re
moves all possibility of doubt in this
regard in the future.
Arbitration would have been the most
advisable had the two institutions
failed to come to any definite under
standing, but as California has signi
fied a willingness to accede to the
proposal adopted by Stanford, the
means taken by the Executive Com
mittee but hasten what would have
been the inevitable result had arbi
tration been resorted to.
The schemes suggested by Califor
nia for clearing the situation we do
not think would be as satisfactory as
either of the others. It would be im
possible for a Board of Rugby experts
to agree on any set rules for each
authority has favorite theories of
his own as to how the game should
be played. Furthermore foreign ex
perts might not arrange a game that
would meet with the approval of
Rugby patrons in California. But
granted that a satisfactory set of rules
was adopted, we would be in the same
position with regard to the subject in
dispute, as when we started. The
proposal to have the 1913 game played
under the 1911 rules and then decide
the matter of interpretation would
only postpone settlement.
It is regrettable that two institu
tions of the standing of Stanford and
California had to sever football rela
tions on such a minor point as inter
pretation, but now that it is to be
amicably settled old scores should be
forgotten.
