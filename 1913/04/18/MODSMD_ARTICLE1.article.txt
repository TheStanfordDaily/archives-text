# CAMBRIDGE DIVINE TO BE HEARD AT ASSEMBLY
## CLASSES TO SUSPEND TUESDAY FOR TWO HOURS. Samuel McChord Crothers of Harvard to Inaugurate Second West Lecture Series. 
### 
Inaugurating the second series of
West Memorial lectures, a two period
assembly will be held Tuesday, April
22, at 10:15. Dr. Samuel McChord
Crothers, of Cambridge, Massachu
setts, is to be the speaker.
Dr. Crothers stands in the front
rank of American clergymen. As the
pastor of the First Church in Cam
bridge, preacher of Harvard Univer
sity, and a frequent contributor to
periodicals, he has thoroughly estab
lished his claim to distinction, both as
a theological and secular writer and
as a speaker. Dr. Crothers graduated
from Princeton in 1574 with the degree
of A. B. He received his D. D. from
Harvard in 1899, and since that time
he has been granted an honorary Litt.
D. by St. Lawrence and Princeton.
During the early part of his career
Dr. Crothers occupied a pulpit in
Santa Barbara, California. Among
his best known literary productions
are "Members of One Body," "Miss
Muffet's Christmas Party," "The
Understanding Heart," "The Endless
Life," "Oliver Wendell Holmes and His
Fellow Boarders," and "Among
Friends."
West Endowment.
The first series of West Memorial
Lectures was delivered during Feb
ruary, 1911, Rev. Charles E. Jeffer
son, D. D., of the Broadway Taber
nacle, New York, being the lecturer.
This course of lectures, which, accord
ing to the grant to the University, is
to be known as the "Raymond F. West
Memorial Lectures on Immortality,
Human Conduct, and Human Destiny,"
was established by F. W. West and
wife of Seattle, Washington, in memory
of their son Raymond F. West, who
was drowned in the Eel river in this
state on January IS, 1906, before the
completion of his college course. The
income on a sum of $10,000 is to be
used by the University in securing a
lecturer and publishing his manu
script. By the terms of the grant the
lecturers are to be held in alternate
years, and the manuscript of each
series is to become the property of the
University.
This foundation at Stanford is
similar in nature to the Dudleian and
Ingersoll lectureship at. Harvard. In
the ability to offer these lectures bi
annually, Stanford possesses a unique
distinction, since there are but four
fir live institutions of higher education
in the United States which have foun
dations providing for lecturers by
eminent men upon theological sub
jects.
The second lecture will be on Tues
day evening at 8 o'clock, and the third
Wednesday evening at the same time.
