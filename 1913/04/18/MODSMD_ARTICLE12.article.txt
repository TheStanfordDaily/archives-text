# A 						BIG DAY
## 
### 
Tomorrow three of the most import
ant events on the athletic calendar will

take place at Berkeley.
In the morning the
Freshmen and Varsity

crews will match their skill with the
Blue and Gold eights while the Varsity
will have the added competition of the
University of Washington. The fact
that the Cardinal has been returned
victorious so many times 011 the water
does not necessarily mean that she
will never be beaten, but we do not
think that the spell will lie broken this
year at least. Spurred on by succes
sive defeats at the hands of Stanford,
both California and Washington have
put forth great efforts this year to
turn out winning crews. Both have
modified their stroke and by this means
they hope to win. But the same thing
that has brought more than one vic
tory home to the Cardinal we feel con
fident will do the work tomorrow, and
that is condition.
In competing 011 the Berkeley oval
the track men will be hampered by not
being accustomed to the sharp turns
and softer dirt, but in the end class
will tell. While the track may cost us
a few points we feel safe in predicting
that Stanford will have a safe lead be
fore the relay is run.
Nor must we forget the Women's
Tennis which takes place at Berkeley
this afternoon and tomorrow morn
ing. The women say they have better
than an even chance to win and we
think they have.
Indications point to a big day for
Stanford tomorrow. The athletes are
in condition to put up the fight of their
lives. We should be there to give
them the support they deserve.
