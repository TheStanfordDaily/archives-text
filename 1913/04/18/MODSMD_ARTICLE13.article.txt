Seven years ago today Stanford
University was almost put out of ex-

istence by an earthquake.
The elegant buildings, for
which the University was

noted, were many of them completely
ruined while there was not a single
one that did not suffer some damage.
At that time there were many pessi
mists who declared that the institution
would never be rebuilt and if it was it
would not be the Stanford of former
years. To the casual observer of 190 C
these pessimists were not far amiss.

In fact it would have taken an enthu
siastic optimist to have believed that
this institution of ours would ever
rise again.
But the same spirit that overcame
the difficulties in the early nineties
was here in 1906, and out of a mass of
ruin, Stanford emerged greater and
grander than ever. Seven years later
finds the Quad completely restored,
the engineering buildings rebuilt and
new ones added, the church well on
the way to completion and the only
remaining wing of the museum soon
to be repaired. But two relics of the
famous quake are now visible, the
library and the gymnasium, and it will
not be long before these ruins are re
stored.
When one thinks of what has been
accomplished since 1906, and considers
that it has been done on the same in
come that the University enjoyed be
fore the disaster, it is impossible to
bestow too much praise upon President
Jordan and the Board of Trustees.
