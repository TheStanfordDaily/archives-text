Editor of the Daily Palo Alto:
1 have been pleased to notice that you
have given much space to the per
formance of ' The Comedy of Errors"
by the Hen Greet players, but I was
disappointed to see how small was the
advance sale of tickets. I saw this
company in the great Auditorium
theater in Chicago last summer, where
they had played the season through,
and i have seldom seen Shakespeare
so satisfactorily given. I induced the
English Club to bring the Ben Greet
players here because I thought that
I here could hardly be a student at
Stanford who would not realize that
we are doing him a very great favor in
enabling him to see this company in a
Shakespeare play. I know how un
fortunate the time is; but still the oc
casion is one not to be passed by.
"The Comedy of Errors" is the most
boisterously funny of all Shakespeare's
plays. Even with examinations com
ing, and our funds almost (or quite)
exhausted, we are entitled to one even
ing's absolute relaxation and the re
lief that comes with a prolonged and
hearty laugh. Going to this comedy
is no solemn task imposed by a sense
of duty. But at the same time it is
Shakespeare too, and so is not only
worth seeing at the time but worth
having seen all the rest of one's life.
