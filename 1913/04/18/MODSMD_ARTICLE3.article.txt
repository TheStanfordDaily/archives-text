## RIVAL CAMPS REPORT MEN IN CONDITION. Twentieth Annual Meet Will Start on Berkeley Oval at 2:30; Hammer Throw at 1:80. 
### 
The Stanford track men are on edge
for the what promises to be the great
est track meet in several years. Pros
pects point to several Intercollegiate
records being broken before the relay
race is run at 4:00. Every one of the
Cardinal athletes are in condition to
come to the mark when called, and will
put up the r-ace of the season.
Reports come from the enemies
camp that Ed. Stanton will not be in
trim tomorrow. Last week the
sprinter pulled a tendon and it was not
until yesterday that he put on a pair
of spikes. Maclise will also be one
of the veterans who will not contest.
The California runners are in top
season form and are certain to give a
good account of themselves besides
springing the usual eleventh hour sur
prises.
The track meet is scheduled to start
on the Berkeley oval at 2:30, and the
last race will be finished at four. The
hammer throw will take place on the
baseball field at 1:30. Following is
