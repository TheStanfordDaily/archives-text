age, both attended the same college.
They both wear the same size collars,
shoes, hats and gloves; both have
light hair, and fair complexions. Un

the same part in England, and they
have both known of each other for a
great many years.

agement alone in the United States
and England. Vivian is always cast
for the principle comedy role in the
Greet productions. Hale is an ex
perienced actor. He made his first
debut tweny-five years ago as Little
Willie in "East Lynn," in Ireland. He

Leonard Shepherd, who plays the
part of Aegeon, is an English actor of
prominence. For many years he has
starred in England as Shylock, Rich

Ben Greet is considered today one
of the greatest living authorities on
the English drama, and has become
world famous for his Elizabethan pro
ductions. He has been connected with
the stage for thirty years and has per
haps trained more actors than any
other man living today.
