# STANFORD SCORES GREAT VICTORIES
## VARSITY SECOND IN REGATTA 
### 
Philip I'etrie Clover, '14, of
Pasadena, was elected 1914 crew
captain by tlie Varsity oarsmen
Saturday noon, (luring; lunch at
their hotel. Clover was 15)12
Varsity substitute, rowed in the
Poughkeepsie regatta, and was
No. 2in the 1918 Varsity. He is a
member of the Delta Kappa Epsi
lon fraternity.

Superiority of strength, with the
linesse in their stroke that comes only
with several year's experience in rac
ing shells, enabled eight Washington
oarsmen to drive their boat across the
finish line twelve lengths ahead of the
Cardinal shell, and some twenty
lengths ahead of California in the re
gatta on Saturday morning. The dis
tance between the racing crews left
no dispute possible as to the merits
of the three Varsities, and Washington
rsturned to the north acknowledged as
the premier eight of the Pacific Coast.
The winners were never headed after
the first half mile and the result
did not seem in doubt. The two
southern crews hit up a lively clip
at the start, California taking the lead
with their high stroke of 42. But the
smooth sweep of the white bladed oars,
in perfect rythm with the eight sway
ing oarsmen, steadily sent the Wash
ington shell to the front, and the rac 3
resolved into a struggle for second
place between California and Stan
ford.
The Freshmen boats came to their
starting line before the Varsity, and
the Stanford first year men proved
themselves worthy of their Cardinal
lG's by beating the California babe&
by about three lengths. It was the
closest race of the day, with the Rlue
and Gold in the lead for the first
stretch. After turning into the Estuary
proper between the two moles, the
Stanford shell forged ahead, and
shortly put open water between stern
and bow. The stroke used by the Cal
ifornia Freshmen did not presage well
for the success of their varsity, as
their fast and choppy 40 to the minute
could not hold pace with the 32 stroke
of the victors, and Cardinal hopes
for a HI tie and Gold defeat were corre
spondingly raised.
Perfect Weather.
The weather conditions on Satur
day morning were made to order, with
a smooth course, no wind, and a
slightly hazy sky that prevented any
glare on the water's surface. The
course was well patrolled, the reve
nue cutter "Golden Gate" taking up
its position at the end of the Estuary
at about 9:15, and closing the stretch
to all vessels. Government tugs kept
the sightseeing launches at one side,
and almost unruffled water formed
the racers' course.
The Varsity.
The flood tide prevented the lock
start being used, as the current swept
the stake boats upstream. From the
free start, the three shells were off
without a hitch, and the race was on.
California, with a 42 stroke slipped
to the front, with Stanford using a 36
pace, and Washington a 36.

The eights were close together For
the first half mile, but at the end of
that stretch the Washington shell took
the lead and were not headed again.
They had drawn the inside course
where they were least affected by the
tide. Stanford was next, with Califor
nia on the outside, bucking the
strongest current.
Follow the Loader.
At the half way point, Washington
was some four lengths in the lead, with
Stanford leading the California shell
by two lengths. The northerners did
not vary their stroke a fraction, dip
ping the big sweeps into the water
just 32 times a minute. The Cardinal
eight had dropped to 34, and main
tained that pace until the final spurt,
when they picked up to 36. California
was averaging 38, but was not pulling
as evenly as either of the crews ahead,
and the strokes were much shorter.
Spurts of spray and swirling eddies
marked their course and the "Golden
Bear" slowly hut surely dropped be
hind and out of the race.
and out of the race.
The Time.
The winning shell crossed the finish
line just 17 minutes and 54 seconds
after the starting gun had been fired,
Stanford came across in 18:36, while
California finished in 19:7. The time
cannot be compared to that of last
year, 16:42 for the three miles, as the
flood tide made a difference which is
impossible to estimate, the three shells
being retarded in the inverse order in
which they finished.
The Freshmen.
The Stanford Freshmen were off to
a bad start, the No. 6 jumped his slide
and the shell hesitated for a few sec
onds. California went to the front
with their fast stroke, and the eights
settled down for their two mile tussle.
Neither eight was working especially
smoothly, and when the racers turned
the one liend it looked like a hard fight
to the finish. But Stanford's 32 was
holding California's 3S to 40, and when
in the last mile Coxswain Goodman
urged the men to "pick it up," they
speedily left their rivals behind, cross
ing the line a good three lengths
ahead.
Now Stroke Proven.
The two races proved to the satis
faction of the Stanford oarsmen that
the new stroke is practically perfect
for use on this coast, and the next sea
son will find the squad being trained
to the stroke with only the slightest
modifications. To the average ob
server, the strokes used by the Wash
ingtonian and by the Stanford eight
were identical. A minor difference was
in the square-up the northerners
squaring-up high above the water
while the Cardinal eight swept their
blades back only an inch or more
above surface.
The California stroke was conclu
sively proven to be inferior to that
used by the shells taking the first two
'daces, as the short reach and fast
stroke could not keep pace with the
sweeping blades, and then the men
were not capable of keeping up the
pace to the end.
