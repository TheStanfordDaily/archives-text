# STUDENT BODY TREASURY IN FINE SHAPE
## 
### 
Today The Daily Palo Alto publishes
the report of Graduate Manager D. W.
Burbank for last semester. The pur
pose of this report is to show the stu
dents just how the Student Body
stands financially and it should be of
interest to every member of this insti
tution.
The bookkeeping system recently
installed by Burbank is the most com
plete scheme that has ever been
evolved, and it is this system that
makes such reports as this one pos
sible. The plan as it now been
worked out is not a sudden departure
from the old system of bookkeeping,
but is the growth of years of effort on
the part of Burbank to develop the
most scientific scheme possible in
keeping account of the Student Body's
funds. When Burbank first came into
office in 1909 there was a deficit of
$2,395.85. He immediately set out to
clear this up and the first step in this
direction was to employ a system
atized scheme of bookkeeping which
was something new for this office. He
segregated the funds for various
activities more distinctly than they
had. been before, for the purpose of
making it easy to compare the ex
penses in one year in any direction
with those of any previous years, and
so provided a check. Finally, at the
end of last semester he submitted all
his books to an expert accountant for
a thorough examination, and asked
him to examine carefully all the meth
ods in use and to suggest any im
provements that nis expert knowledge
indicated to be desirable.
The expert's report is given here en
tire. Burbank immediately installed
the bookkeeping methods that were
suggested, differing slightly from his
own methods, and tending to make
comparison of special expenses still
more readily comparable from season
to season. There has been increased
segregation of funds with this object
in view.
The books of the system, as it is in
operation now, include a combined
cash journal and a ledger. In the
journal every movement of a piece
of money is indicated by a credit to
one fund and a debit to another, the
bank account being debited with all
sums as they are deposited and
credited as they are paid by check, and
debited to some other fund. The
voucher checks, the indorsements of
which make them signed receipts are
filed in numbered series.
The extract by the accountant of the
Graduate Manager's accounts forms a
detailed analysis of the finances of the
first semester. It is the plan to have
the accounts analyzed in this way at
the end of each semester. Sheets 1,
2 and 3 are self-explanatory, and show
that there was a gain of $11,664.78 for
the half-year, the total cash available
being nearly $15,000 at the end of the
semester, not counting $4,000 in the
Palo Alto Building and Loan Associa
tion. Sheet 1 takes up all expenditures,
and sheet 2 all that did not produce
assets. Sheet 3 lists the assets and
liabilities from the semester's activ
ities. Sheet 4 shows in detail bow the
amount in hand at the beginning of
the semester's receipts, balances the
amount in hand at the end of the
semester plus the disbursements.
Sheet 5 shows disbursements divided
according to the various funds to
which they are debited.

detailed analysis of the finances of the
first semester. It is the plan to have
the accounts analyzed in this way at
the end of each semester. Sheets 1,
2 and 3 are self-explanatory, and show
that there was a gain of $11,664.78 for
the half-year, the total cash available
being nearly $15,000 at the end of the
semester, not counting $4,000 in the
Palo Alto Building and Loan Associa
tion. Sheet 1 takes up all expenditures,
and sheet 2 all that did not produce
assets. Sheet 3 lists the assets and
liabilities from the semester's activ
ities. Sheet 4 shows in detail bow the
amount in hand at the beginning of
the semester's receipts, balances the
amount in hand at the end of the
semester plus the disbursements.
Sheet 5 shows disbursements divided
according to the various funds to
which they are debited.
Today The Daily Palo Alto publishes
the report of Graduate Manager D. W.
Burbank for last semester. The pur
pose of this report is to show the stu
dents just how the Student Body
stands financially and it should be of
interest to every member of this insti
tution.
The bookkeeping system recently
installed by Burbank is the most com
plete scheme that has ever been
evolved, and it is this system that
makes such reports as this one pos
sible. The plan as it now been
worked out is not a sudden departure
from the old system of bookkeeping,
but is the growth of years of effort on
the part of Burbank to develop the
most scientific scheme possible in
keeping account of the Student Body's
funds. When Burbank first came into
office in 1909 there was a deficit of
$2,395.85. He immediately set out to
clear this up and the first step in this
direction was to employ a system
atized scheme of bookkeeping which
was something new for this office. He
segregated the funds for various
activities more distinctly than they
had. been before, for the purpose of
making it easy to compare the ex
penses in one year in any direction
with those of any previous years, and
so provided a check. Finally, at the
end of last semester he submitted all
his books to an expert accountant for
a thorough examination, and asked
him to examine carefully all the meth
ods in use and to suggest any im
provements that nis expert knowledge
indicated to be desirable.
The expert's report is given here en
tire. Burbank immediately installed
the bookkeeping methods that were
suggested, differing slightly from his
own methods, and tending to make
comparison of special expenses still
more readily comparable from season
to season. There has been increased
segregation of funds with this object
in view.
The books of the system, as it is in
operation now, include a combined
cash journal and a ledger. In the
journal every movement of a piece
of money is indicated by a credit to
one fund and a debit to another, the
bank account being debited with all
sums as they are deposited and
credited as they are paid by check, and
debited to some other fund. The
voucher checks, the indorsements of
which make them signed receipts are
filed in numbered series.

Graduate Manager's accounts forms a
