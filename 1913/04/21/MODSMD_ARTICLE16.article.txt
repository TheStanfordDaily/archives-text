Some items in these tables are in
teresting. There are a number of ex
penses entered under Rugby on sheet
5 which ought not to be as big again.
The bill for the entertainment of the
Australians and .$2,000 of the gnaran
taes, which was on their account, were,
of course, special expenditures and
would not usually lie met with. The
value of those segregated accounts
comes out clearly in the entries for
"drugs" and "training table." Both
these expenses were incurred under a
new system and ought to be reduced
at least a third next year, and with
the figures of this year before him the
Graduate Manager next year will have
a criterion by which to govern ex
penditures. The Graduate Manager
this year chartered a fraternity house
outright and met all bills for five
weeks. Next, year the time will be a
month and much experience gained
this year will be made available for
Bui-bank's successor next year. The
charge for medical services is excep
tionally high on account of a peculiarly
difficult muscle injury to one man
which alone cost $200.
The cost of footballs for the season,
$20.30, seems a mistake, in view of the
fact that between three and four dozen
are used and they cost nearly $5 apiece,
wholesale. This is a good exemplifi
cation of Burbank's attention to de
tails. As a matter of fact the footballs
purchased cost about $180, but he has
a waiting list of those who want to
purchase the second-hand balls.
The charge against "office expense,"
$1,741.99, is unfairly high, because this
fund is made the recipient of all ex
penses that cannot lie in their entirety
charged to any other, as is shown by
the items on sheet 5. The entry "dead
heads" on sheet 2 represents the free
equipment furnished to "S" men; about,
half of it was for outfitting the Rugby
team for the Big Game. The startlingly
large sum under "bad debts" conies
about because it. includes a large num
ber of unpaid or mischarged debts that
have been carried on the books for
years and are now wiped off by enter
ing them on the credit side of the
ledger and thus disposing of them.
