# The 						Bookstore Has a Few Quads.
## 
### 
About twelve copies of the 1913
Quad have been found and may be had
at the campus Bookstore. Many calls
have been received for last year's an
nual but the Bookstore has been un
able to supply them as it was thought
that all had been disposed of. The
few that remain were misplaced at the
bindery and not sent to the campus
with the shipment last spring. They
were not discovered until last week.
