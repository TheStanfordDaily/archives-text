# CARDINAL WINS THRILLING MEET
## 
### 
Victory by the narrow margin of
two-fifths of a point, the rerunning of
the second place men in two-hun
dred and twenty yard dash to decide
a tie with Paul McKee of Stanford
winning the deciding race and bring
ing second points for himself and first
place for his alma mater; these were
the features which climaxed the most
sensational meet ever held between
the Cardinal and the Blue and Gold
and probably the closest college ath
letic competition ever staged in this
country. Stanford 61 1-5; California
60 4-5, this is the way the result of
Saturday's meet will be embossed on
the pages of Stanford athletic history
along side of which will be the name
of every man who helped to win for
the Cardinal the twentieth annual
meeting of the rival universities.
In the 220-yard dash a dispute arose
as to the placing of the men for second
points. Captain Campbell of Stanford
won the race, of that there was no
question, but the judges could not
agree on the next man, the two offi
cials who were judging second place
called it a tie, whle the third place
judge named Wood, of California, as
third.
Then McKee proposed that the race
be run over to decide second place,
and California accepted. For an hour
previous to this suggestion the judges
were deadlocked on the question.
More than seven thousand minds
were thinking the same but differ
ently. The partisans on opposite sides
waited intently as the two runners
came to the mark. Wood was very
nervous but McKee remained as cool
as a cucumber. Starter Wand sent
the runners away in the deciding race,
the great crowd which filled every bit
of space within the enclosure arose
en masse. To the stretch they ran
even. Then McKee drew out and
forged ahead. His superiority began
to tell and he breasted the tape three
yards ahead of "Fui" Wood, winning
for himself second place and for his
team the meet.
Five Stanford-California Intercol
legiate records were broken, one
world's Intercollegiate record was
established, and one American record
was tied during the meet. Shattuck,
of California, added his name to the
world's best hammer throwers when
he smashed the world's Intercollegiate
hammer throw mark by heaving the
hammer 175 feet 10 inches, breaking

the previous record by over two feet
and his own Stanford-California mark
by almost fourteen feet.
Stanford gets credit for three new
marks. Wilson was the first member
of "Dad" Moulton's squad to place his
name on the list of record holders
when he ran the mile in 4:26 2-5
breaking the previous record of
4:28:2 held by Fletcher also of Stan
ford, and made last year.
Herb Whitted erased the record
formerly held by Maclise of California
in the high hurdles by winning in
15:1-5 seconds, just a fifth better than
the old time. This also equals the
American record. Don Dawson was
the other Stanford man to get his
name on the athletic sheet for excel
lency. He recorded a jump of 23 feet
7 1-4 inches. Crabbe of California
beat his own mark of 9:55:3 by cut
ting one and three-fifths seconds off
his old time.
Surprises, reversals, together with
the disqualification of Dodge in the
two-mile, caused the meet to be so
closely contested.
Five men cleared 12 feet 1 inch in
the pole vault —Miller, Krohn, Stevens
and Tnfts of Stanford and Young of
California—but none were able to get
over at the next height, six inches
higher and the score was further com
plicated by a fractional division of
points. The work of the Freshmen,
Krohn and Tufts, was especially
meritorius since neither had done this
well before.
Ric Templeton threw a scare into
the California high jumpers by clear
ing the bar at 6 feet 2 inches, tying
for second place. His work is remark
able for he also competed in the high
hurdles and pole vault.
Herb Whitted was the highest indi
vidual scorer of the meet, getting ten
points. Captain Campbell and McKee
each made eight. Meeson made the
most—nine—for California.
Stanford won eight first places and
included four men in the tie for a
ninth, took three second places and
tied for a fourth, and annexed two
thirds. This is the first Cardinal track
victory in three years.
Eight of the Stanford point winners
—Whitted, Wilson, Bedeau. Dawson
F. Murray, Templeton, Krohn and
Tufts—received their block "S" for
the first time as the result of Satur
day's meet.


THE STANFORD TRACK TEAM.
Wilson of Stanford, Wood of Cali
fornia and R. L. Murray of Stanford,
the three most dangerous competitors
in the opening event allowed the field
to set the pace for the greater part of
the journey. Murray picked up first and
lengthened his stride as the men en
tered 011 the last lap. Wilson had
been coming nearer the leaders and in
the backstretch both Stanford run
ners passed the Blue and Gold captain.
Wilson was running easily and Wood's
finish was not able to bring him bet
ter than second place, he having
passed Murray on the stretch. Wilson
won by ten yards. His time of
4: lit! 3-5 was almost two seconds bet
ter than the record made last year by
Bill Fletcher of Stanfor ■.
Hundred Yard Bash.
McKee took the lead from the firs 112
stride and was never headed. Captain
Campbell, about two yards behind
McKee, outran Wood of California and
finished more than a foot ahead of the
Californian, who barely beat out Mc-
Nair of Stanford for third.
l'iO-1 ard Hurdles.
Displaying a form in getting over the
high sticks that was nothing short of
beautiful, Herb \\ bitted had tilings his
own way in the 120-yard hurdle event
and took the lead from the pistol start,
lie was never breasted and set a new
Intercollegiate record of 15:1-5 sec
onds in addition to tying the American
Intercollegiate record held by Krenz
lein of Pennsylvania, Shaw of Dart
mouth, Edwards of California, and
Nicholson of Missouri. Tenipleton was
second place man along side of liee
son, the pride of Christie's men, until
almost the last hurdle. Both men
were passed in the last yards of the
race by Murray of Stanford, who also
ran a wonderful race. The Stanford
man took second and Beeson was for
tunate in annexing the lone point for
third.
140-Yard Dash.
The first real surprise of the meet
came with the upset of the "dope" in
the quarter, when McClure fell four
yards short from the tape, failing to
place. Todd drew the pole with Mc
Clure second. The pace makers led
out with three favorites, Clark and
Todd of California and McClure of
Stanford holding back. Then the real
struggle began. McClure moved up
an i was swung wide on the turn in
passing Todd. Coming into the
stretch with a three-yard lead the
Stanford runner was gradually over-'
hauled by Todd with Clark closing up.
Ten yards from the tape the leaders
were even. Suddenly as if in a
faint McClure, with but four yards to
go, fell to the track and the two Blue
and Gold runners crossed the line in
the first two places. Card, of Stanford,
came from behind and captured third.
The time was 50:1-5 second: 1
Two .Mile.
To be disqualified after forcing the
winner to breast the tape in the re
markable time of !1:54 was one of the
most unfortunate occurance of the
meet. "1 his fel lto the ltoof Jitnmie
Dodge, the gritty Stanford two-miler,
who not only compelled Crabbe of Cal
ifornia to smash the existing record,
but also was beaten by less than a foot
in a race which was one of the most
cxciting of the meet. The two leaders
exchanged the first position time after
time. Dodge seemed to worry Crabbe
and in the last lap the Stanford runner
tried for the polo 011 the first turn.
Crabbe swung wide and just as Dodge
attempted to take the inside the Cali
fornia two-miler closed in and the
Stanford man was forced to step off
the track. For the crowding and the
stepping off the track the disqualifica
tion was inflicted giving California a
clean sweep in the longest race of the
meet. Stowitts and Zeille took the
second and third points.
220-Yard Hurdles.
Familiarity with the track probably
gave Beeson the advantage at the
start of the low hurdle event but the
class of Whitted off-set any such
lead and when the straight-away was
reached the latter decisively proved
his superiority and beat the veteran
Blue and CI old athlete by three yards.
Beeson took second. Murray drew the
poorest lane and was bothered by the
curve but came on and nipped third
place in excellent fashion.
220-Yard Dash.
Wcod of California drew the pole
with his teammate Scott next to him.
Captain Campbell occupied the ad
joining lane and McKee was on the far
side. The men were well bunched
when they came into the straight
away. Campbell broke the tape first
two feet ahead of McKee who looked
to have made second. But the finish
was so close that the judges were at a
difference as to the place. A dead
lock ensued. Then came the Stanford
man's proposal to run off the tie and
its acceptance with a victory for Mc-
Kee. The first race was clocked in
22:4-5. Their run was timed in 23 flat.
fSSO-Yard Run.
For the second time Bonnett of Stan
ford was returned the winner of the
Irilf-mile in the Intercollegiate compe
tition. Getting a poor start Bonnett

was badly pocketed in the first lap and
was forced to run around a large field
of runners before he was able to get
the pole. Smith of California made a
great fight and seemed on the verge of
passing the Stanford favorite when
Bonnett gamely responded and put out
enough effort to win by a scant mar
gin. Smith and Cuendett added their
points to the Blue and Gold total.
Broad .lump.
Don Dawson had everything his own
way in the broad jump and won with
a leap of 23 feet 7 1-4 inches, breaking
the Stanford-California Intercollegiate
record of 23 feet 4 7-8 inches held by
Fred Allen of California. Dawson was
the only one of the Stanford trio to
place in the finals. Argabrite and
Knight could not get the take-off
properly and failed to make 22 feet, as
did the veteran Allen. Two "dark
horses" annexed second and third.
Bradway of U. C. took second with a
jump of 22 feet 2 7-8 inches and Reed
third, distance 22 feet 1 3-4 inches.
Shot I'ut.
Bedeau proved his superiority over
all competitors in the shot put when
he sent the ball through the air fori
43 feet 5 1-8 inches. This is further i
than he has ever put the shot before, I
winning by nearly two feet over his j
closest opponent. Thomas and Lock-1
hart of California were second and
third in order, the former placing
with a mark of 41 feet 6 inches, just
one inch further than his teammates.
Lockhart had been considered a"a
dark horse" by many with a chance
of winning the event.
High Jump.
Eddie Beeson was forced to jumpl
.higher than he has ever done this sea- j
son to win the high jump. He cleared |

the bar at li feet 3 1-S inches,while Tem
pleton and McFie tied for second at
G feet 2 inches. At the time that Hie
Templeton was competing in the high
jump he was also pole vaulting and
running the high hurdles.
Pole Vault.
The pole vault was a deciding issue
at the last minute of the meet. The
score stood 4G-58 in favor of Califor
nia with the ]iole vault and 220-yard
dash yet to finish. Four Stanford
men aud one California vaulter had
cleared 12 feet 1 inch and were trying
at 12 feet (i inches. Each man took
three tries and failed, so that the nine
points were divided among the five
contestants, seven and one-fifth points
went to Stanford. The vaulters who
tied for first were Miller, Stevens,
Krohn, Tufts of Stanford and Young
of California.
