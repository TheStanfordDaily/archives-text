# CARDINAL WINS THRILLING MEET
## 
### 
Victory by the narrow margin of
two-fifths of a point, the rerunning of
the second place men in two-hun
dred and twenty yard dash to decide
a tie with Paul McKee of Stanford
winning the deciding race and bring
ing second points for himself and first
place for his alma mater; these were
the features which climaxed the most
sensational meet ever held between
the Cardinal and the Blue and Gold
and probably the closest college ath
letic competition ever staged in this
country. Stanford 61 1-5; California
60 4-5, this is the way the result of
Saturday's meet will be embossed on
the pages of Stanford athletic history
along side of which will be the name
of every man who helped to win for
the Cardinal the twentieth annual
meeting of the rival universities.
In the 220-yard dash a dispute arose
as to the placing of the men for second
points. Captain Campbell of Stanford
won the race, of that there was no
question, but the judges could not
agree on the next man, the two offi
cials who were judging second place
called it a tie, whle the third place
judge named Wood, of California, as
third.
Then McKee proposed that the race
be run over to decide second place,
and California accepted. For an hour
previous to this suggestion the judges
were deadlocked on the question.
More than seven thousand minds
were thinking the same but differ
ently. The partisans on opposite sides
waited intently as the two runners
came to the mark. Wood was very
nervous but McKee remained as cool
as a cucumber. Starter Wand sent
the runners away in the deciding race,
the great crowd which filled every bit
of space within the enclosure arose
en masse. To the stretch they ran
even. Then McKee drew out and
forged ahead. His superiority began
to tell and he breasted the tape three
yards ahead of "Fui" Wood, winning
for himself second place and for his
team the meet.
Five Stanford-California Intercol
legiate records were broken, one
world's Intercollegiate record was
established, and one American record
was tied during the meet. Shattuck,
of California, added his name to the
world's best hammer throwers when
he smashed the world's Intercollegiate
hammer throw mark by heaving the
hammer 175 feet 10 inches, breaking

the previous record by over two feet
and his own Stanford-California mark
by almost fourteen feet.
Stanford gets credit for three new
marks. Wilson was the first member
of "Dad" Moulton's squad to place his
name on the list of record holders
when he ran the mile in 4:26 2-5
breaking the previous record of
4:28:2 held by Fletcher also of Stan
ford, and made last year.
Herb Whitted erased the record
formerly held by Maclise of California
in the high hurdles by winning in
15:1-5 seconds, just a fifth better than
the old time. This also equals the
American record. Don Dawson was
the other Stanford man to get his
name on the athletic sheet for excel
lency. He recorded a jump of 23 feet
7 1-4 inches. Crabbe of California
beat his own mark of 9:55:3 by cut
ting one and three-fifths seconds off
his old time.
Surprises, reversals, together with
the disqualification of Dodge in the
two-mile, caused the meet to be so
closely contested.
Five men cleared 12 feet 1 inch in
the pole vault —Miller, Krohn, Stevens
and Tnfts of Stanford and Young of
California—but none were able to get
over at the next height, six inches
higher and the score was further com
plicated by a fractional division of
points. The work of the Freshmen,
Krohn and Tufts, was especially
meritorius since neither had done this
well before.
Ric Templeton threw a scare into
the California high jumpers by clear
ing the bar at 6 feet 2 inches, tying
for second place. His work is remark
able for he also competed in the high
hurdles and pole vault.
Herb Whitted was the highest indi
vidual scorer of the meet, getting ten
points. Captain Campbell and McKee
each made eight. Meeson made the
most—nine—for California.
Stanford won eight first places and
included four men in the tie for a
ninth, took three second places and
tied for a fourth, and annexed two
thirds. This is the first Cardinal track
victory in three years.
Eight of the Stanford point winners
—Whitted, Wilson, Bedeau. Dawson
F. Murray, Templeton, Krohn and
Tufts—received their block "S" for
the first time as the result of Satur
day's meet.
