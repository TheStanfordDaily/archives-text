Saturday, April 19, 1913, will go
down as one of the greatest days in

Stanford's athletic history.
A track meet won by two
fifths of a point, second in a

Varsity regatta, and first in a Fresh
man crew race mark the achievements
oL' a day, the like of which has never
been seen, and probably never will be
duplicated.
Words fail to describe the track
meet. The score speaks for itself.
Two of the best college track teams in
America opposed each other on the
Berkeley oval Saturday and fought
out every point. Yes, "fight" is what
they did, but it was "fight" of the right
kind, not the "anything to win" brand
but cleanly and fairly under the rules
of the game and all in a spirit of true
sportsmanship.
As long as men and women go to
Stanford and California that race be
tween Paul McKee and Dwight Wood
will be remembered and with it win
descend that spirit of true sportsman
ship which marked the culmination of
that great meet. Captain Campbell
Trainer "Dad" Moulton, Assistant
Trainer Harry Maloney and every
member of the team deserve un
limited praise for Saturday's victory.
They won a clean and fair meet from
a great team and established the 1913
Stanford Track Team as the equal, if
not the superior, of any college team
in America.
Although the crew did not finish]
first in the triangular regatta, defeat
ing California is satifaction enough.
To be defeated by such a crew as
Washington is no disgrace, sterling
oars men and fine fellows they are a
credit to any university.
Too much praise cannot go the way
of Pat O'Dea, Captain Duryea and
the men on the Stanford crew who
worked so hard all season in the face
of the most adverse conditions. With
but one veteran in the boat and limited
training facilities these men devel
oped into a rowing unit of which Stan
ford is justly proud. Eight of the men
will he back next year to work under
Captain Clover. Under such a capable
leader as be and with the experience
gained this year, these men should be
able to repeat this year's success and
go one step farther and take Wash
ington into camp.
