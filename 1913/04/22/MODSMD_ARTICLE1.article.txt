# DR. CROTHERS DESCRIBES THE WAY OF COURAGE
## SCHOLARLY LECTURE HEARD THIS MORNING. Second and Third Addresses in West Memorial Series Set for Tonight and Tomorrow. 
### 
With a scholarly and thoughtful
presentation of certain problems relat
ing to human conduct and destiny, Dr.
Samuel McChord Crothers this morn
ing inaugurated the second series of
West Memorial Lectures. Presenting
at the outset the primeval and still
persisting view of life as a person be
yond whose walls man cannot hope to
penetrate, Dr. Crothers distinguished
three ways of passing the confines of
this prison and attaining to the higher
life.
These, he said, were first the Way
of Courage, second the Way of Service,
and third the Way of Love. The as
sembly address of this morning was
devoted to a discussion of the Way of
Courage.
Dr. Crothers was introduced by Pres
ident David Starr Jordan. In opening
his discussion he said: "I do not pro
pose any argument for human im
mortality, but merely to bring to your
minds the great practical question in
regard to human conduct and human
destiny—in the first place, the ques
tion of our destiny here and seen, and
then the question of a larger destiny
as yet unseen."
To introduce his principal thesis Dr.
Crothers questioned "What is the rela
tion between the living soul of man
when it becomes conscious of itself
and hopeful for the future, to his
destiny? We must chose between two
views. Is the universe to you a prison
house or an open road leading to
eternity? Is the proper attitude of
man the attitude of spiritual free
dom?"
Speaking of man's eternal question,
"What am I?" the speaker continued.
"At first man has the feeling of Cali
ban on his island—of wierd creatures
at work and above them blind forces.
He feels himself in the grip of irresist
ible destiny. Thus he defines the walls
of his prison house. His fate seems
just to be whirled about by forces
stronger than himself.
"That is Sheer Rebellion."
"But did ever atom whirled in cos
mic dust rebel against its destiny?
Did it every say, 'I will do the thing
that I choose?' That is sheer rebellion,
and that i3 just what you do when
ever you make a deliberate choice
which moves you against the stream
of destiny and seek and end higher
than yourself."
Stating the three ways out of the
prison house to be those of courage,
service, and love, Dr. Crothers de
clared that the first appeal must be.
not to prudence, but to courage.
"We must not put our emphasis on
some eternal force which says 'Thou
must!' Inner compulsion says 'I will!'
'Leap from your seats and contend for
your lives.' These are words of in
spiration. Matthew Arnold sums it all
up . 'Man hath all that nature has, and
more, and in that more lies all his
hope of good.'"
