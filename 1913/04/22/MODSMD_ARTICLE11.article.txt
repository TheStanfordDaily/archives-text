# Non-Partisan

As the excitement attending our
Saturday victories subsides and we re-

turn to our normal
selves again we can
take a saner post mor-

tem of the track meet. And as we
glance back over that most thrilling
of all Intercollegiate contests we are
more convinced than ever that there
is one part of our system of conduct
ing meets that should he changed,
that is, the employment of partisan
officials. We do not mean to cast a
slur upon any of the alumni of either
Stanford or California who officiated
Saturday, for we know that they made
their decisions as they saw them. But
the Stanford-California track meet is
too important and close a contest to
he decided by judges representing the
two institutions. Alumni are always
interested in the competition. Their
eyes arc on the race and not on the
tape. It is only human for one to
see a close decision in favor of his
side and no judges can be blamed
for that. Also the alumni are more
or less aware of the relative merits
of the respective runners and
often times a dark horse will
slip in unnoticed. One of the
most noticeable occuranees of this
was the 100-yard dash in 1909, when
Billy Cline led the field but was no?
seen by the judges, and was not given
a place. There were instances of th«
same thing in Saturday's meet and
there have been similiar happenings
in other meets. Far be it from us to
reflect discredit upon the alumni offi
cials but we do think that results
would be more satisfactory to all if
non-partisans were secured for these
important positions.

The University of California would
surely accept such a proposal and we
would like to see some measure to
(his effect adopted before the 1911
track meet.
