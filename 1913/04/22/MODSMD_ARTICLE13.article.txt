# FRESHMAN ATHLETICS
## 
### 
Settlement of the ever troublesome
problem of Freshman participation in
Varsity contests, is something which
should lie accomplished by the present
administration. This question, the
subject of ho much discussion in times
past, is beginning to present itself in
such a light as to make its solution
at the earliest opportunity, one of al
most vital interest for the future ot
athletics at ibis University. And fon
the success of our athletic teams in
years to come, there is only one way
in which the problem can he solved —
Freshman athletics must be abolished,
first year men must he excluded from
Varsity contests.
In the past, those who have stood
opposed to this movement have always
been forced back to the one argument,
"Stanford allows it—we cannot afford
to dispense with it,"and today, this
same old time worn defense is offered.
Hut we are rapidly outgrowing those
'conditions which made this assertion
seem so plausible twenty years ago
and a few years hence the statement
will utterly fail to hold water. Already
the great majority are coming to
consider the, and we may rightly call
it annual, eastern trip as the real end
of the track season, and the whole
student body is slowly beginning t(
realize that among the colleges on the
other side of the Rockies, is where, in
(lie near future, we must look for com
petition. The Pacific Coast is growing
too small, and the barriers that once
stood in the way of our gaining an en
trance into the east are rapidly being
demolished.
These conditions demand that in
place of our own local reguations
governing athletics, we adopt the rules
in general use by those who are soon
to become our opponents. And in
practically every institution of note
throughout the east, Freshmen are not
given a place upon varsity teams. Too
much interest cannot be laid upon the
necessity for this University to as
sume a like attitude in regard to thni
question. Regardless of what action
Stanford may see fit to take in the
matter, California should take imme
diate steps to debar her freshman from
participation in any Varsity contest,
and the sooner we enact such a ruling
the better. (Editorial, "The Daily
Californian," on March, 25, 1913.)
