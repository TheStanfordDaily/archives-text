# INTERCOLLEGIATE TENNIS MATCHES BEGIN TOMORROW
## TOURNAMENT WILL BE HELD AT CALIFORNIA. Captain Sheldon, Murray, Hutchinson, and Sloss Will Strive to Win Cardinal Victory. 
### 
Stanford will have a chance to make
a clean sweep of the spring's athletics,
both major and minor sports, when the
Cardinal players meet the Blue and
Cold representatives in the annual
Intercollegiate Tennis Tournament on
the California courts tomorrow and
Thursday. Captain V. L. Sheldon, '15,
R. L. Murray, '13, W. N. Hutchinson,
'15, and L. Sloss, '15, are the players
who will strive to keep up the winning
streak and again bring the tennis
championship to Stanford.
The prospects of the Cardinal play
ers winning is particularly bright as
three of the men who meet California
tomorrow were on last year's victor
ious team. The chances have been
strengthened by Captain Sheldon's re
turn to the game. It was feared for a
time that he would be kept out of the
tournament by a lame arm, but this
has sufficiently recovered to permit
him to wield a racquet. Both he and
Murray have striven to get in the best
possible form in the short time that
they have had since track training has
been over. Both played a strong game
in the practice on Encina courts yes
terday afternoon.
Hutchinson, a veteran of last year's
four, and Sloss, the second double
team, have put in a long season of
training and are both at their best.
Hutchinson is playing a far better
game than he did last spring and
should give a good account of him
self in his match on Thursday. Sloss
is playing in his first Intercollegiate
tournament, but is a strong, steady
player, who covers the court with com
parative ease.
Murriy vs. Davis.
Murray will play the first singles
and will probably meet Willis Davis.
Sheldon is the second single man and
Hutchinson the third. The first
doubles team is composed of Murray
and Sheldon.
On Wednesday the first singles and
second doubles will be decided. The
second and third singles and the first
doubles matches will be contested on
Thursday.
The Blue and Cold team will be com
posed of Captain Charles Rogers, Vic.
Breeden, both veterans; Davis, a
Freshman who won the University
championship, and either Robert Lip
man or Dick Smith. The fourth man
as yet has not been definitely decided
upon.
The committee in charge of the Ojia
Valley tournament has sent an invi
tation to the Stanford players to com
pete. If this is accepted the men will
have to leave immediately after the
matches with California on Thursday.
Stanford has sent a team south for the
last eight years. Last spring Sheldon
won the single 3 championship and
coupled with S. Morgan, '11, capture!
the doubles.
