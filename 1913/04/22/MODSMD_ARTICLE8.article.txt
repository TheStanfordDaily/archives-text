# ERRORS OF CLASSIC FARCE PROVOKE LOUD LAUGHTER
## TWO DROMIOS CAPER THEIR WAY TO FAVOR. Poorly Taken Female Roles Disappointing; Fart of Aegeon Alone Shows Unusual Dramatic Ability. 
### 
An eleventh hour seat sale gave the
Hen Greet production of " A Comedy
of Errors" a fair sized audience last
night. On the whole the boisterous
comedy of Shakespeare's one riotous
farce was well presented, and was well
received.
There was reason to be disappoint
ed in the cast. Most of the male roles
were well taken, but with the excep
tion of Miss Grace Halsey Mills, the
women of the play were worse than
mediocre both in st.'ige presence and
in quality of voice.
Shakespeare must have been in an
unusual mood when he conceived "A
Comedy of Errors." The double cases
of mistaken identity that cause the
humorous dilemmas of the comedy are
laughable. The treatment of the situ
ations is also laughable, but depends
too much on the laughter that can be
caused by horse play.
The antics of the two Dromios
drained the last bit of grotesque
comedy from their lines. Percival
Vivian, as the Dromio of Ephesus, and
P. Creighton Hale as the Dromio of
Syracuse capered through the play
with admirable ease and success.
The brothers Antipholus, played by
George Seybolt and W. J. Keighley
were well represented, but unusual
acting was not apparent in either case.
Thr> Dromios were so alike in ap
pearance and mannerism that it was
lml to distinguish them from scene to
scene.
Hy far tlie most impressive work
done last night was that of Leonard
Shepherd as Aegeon, the bearded mer
chant of Syracuse. His dignified art,
and organ like tones made his two
appearances on the stage seem far too
short.
