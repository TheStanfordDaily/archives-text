# NOTED EASTERN DIVINE GIVES SECOND ADDRESS
## "THE WAY OF SERVICE" WAS HIS SUBJECT. Dr. Samuel McChord Crothers Concludes West Foundation Lecture Series This Evening. 
### 
Taking up the second way of man's
surmounting destiny Dr. Samuel Mc-
Chord Crothers last evening developed
the Way of Service. The Way of Cour
age he had treated of in the first lec
ture. There remains the last step in
his hypothesis—The Way of Love —
which will he given in the Assembly
Hall this evening.
In continuance of the thought of the
morning lecture Dr. Crothers said,
"Man's struggle against destiny be
comes a matter of scepticism, or of
faith. The assertion of human will
within ourselves which makes us free
from sin and death which seems all
around us—the fact that such asser
tions have been made, shows us that
there is something here that is not
represented in nature which is lower
than itself.
Ways of \ature arc Hard.
"The ways of nature are hard and
harsh. When man would be kindly
and benevolent, nature seems cruel.
There is a contrast between the ruling
power and the inner consciousness of
right. The really essential and start
ling thing then is the man who de
clares his environment all wrong and
makes a stand against it."
Here he made two premises. First
"I! is possible for the groping soul to
interpret and understand the universe.
'By their fruits shall ye know them.'
By their conduct we know the kind of
man he is. But more, not only may
we know of tlie tree, but also of its
soil and climate."
From this illustration lie drew the
second conclusion: "This world,
however forbidding at first sight, is
something which has produced the
fruits of spirituality. There is some
thing in the laws of the universe
which nourishes the humane soul.
liciilization Comes.
There comes to those who have
really matched their moral selves
against the universe, first the realiza
tion of new powers within themselves
and secondly of friendly powers about
them working with them.
"Thus it has been said there are two
kinds of churches, the turbulent
churches who are against the world
and merely stand aside and scold, and
the constructive churches who fight
with the world. The individual begins
with the turbulent state—everything
seems against him—then in the con
structive state he finds many forces
with him.
"Lord Bacon said, 'When a thing
can't l e done it means it can't lie done
that way.' It is the problem of the in
ventor to find the way, then that
which was relentless fate becomes a
friendly and helpful element. It is
this that makes history interesting.
In (lis concluding lecture Dr Cro
thers will pass from "the man at
work, to the man through work, who
has come to love as the determiner of
human destiny."
