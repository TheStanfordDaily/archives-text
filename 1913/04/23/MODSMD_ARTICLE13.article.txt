# A
						Needed Amendment

### 
An amendment to the Constitution
which provides for the placing of en-

tire control of
the Sequoia in
the hands of

the English Club was presented to the
Student Body by the Executive Com
mittee today. This amendment is one
that is much needed and unless it is
adopted the Sequoia will have to sink
into oblivion. At tlu; present time
there is little excuse for the existence
of the monthly magazine, and it is re
grettable that such should lie the case.
The Sequoia originated as a purely
literary magazine and for a long time
served its purpose very well. But dur
ing the past few years it has failed to
come up to the standard set by the
founders. It has vainly endeavored
to satisfy both the "roughs" and the
lovers of pure literature, but in trying
to please both sides of the house it has
failed.
We refuse to reconcile ourselves to
the belief that Stanford is no longer
capable of turning out men like the
Irwins, Charles K. Field and the rest
of the famous pioneers. We are
confident that there are just as capable
writers in our midst now if we could
only discover them, or if they would
discover themselves.
In an institution of Stanford's size
and standing there should be a place
for a good literary magazine, but it
has been found impossible to produce
such an edition under our present
management. The editors are not to
blame. We have had competent chiefs
in charge and they have worked hard
to bring the monthly up to its former
position but it has proved to be a
losing game. It is obviously impos
sible for an editor to go out and dig up
the talent and they are forced to rely
upon voluntary authors and friends to
fill the book. The sole responsibility
rests with the editor and no one is
willing to aid.
Under the management of such an
organization as the English Club, the
Sequoia should be brought back to its
proper place. The members of this
club are all more or less interested in
literary work. A magazine worthy of
the name of Stanford should be the re
sult of their combined efforts.
