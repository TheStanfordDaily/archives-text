With Saturday's splendid exhibition
of strength and loyalty still fresh in
our minds and with the realization
that every man on the track team
may pat himself on the back and say
"my points counted in the victory,"
most of us are thinking of still an
other thing. Why does Stanford use
such an unfair system of granting the
"S," her final prize to her athletes.
Does it seem square that a man who
runs a fine and a winning race in the
U. S. C. meet or in the Conference
meet and through some accident loses
out in the California meet should be
deprived of the "S," which to every
Stanford student is such a mark of
honor and ability.
Surely the Stanford "S" is not sup
posed to lie a thing won by chance.
Surely it is a reward for loyalty, faith
fulness and worth. Take for example
a man who runs the mile in 4:30 in the
I T . S. C. meet and wins it. If by acci
dent. he should fail to place in the
California meet isn't bis work as good
its say a slow third in the same race?
What of the man who goes to the Con
ference meet and does honor to Stan
ford by placing and perhaps even tak
ing a first in a contest where the best
of the big and great universities are
represented? That man deserves an
"S." Let Stanford look back at some
of her heroes who have gone unhon
ored from this old, outgrown system.
Do you think it would cheapen the
"S?" Nothing is cheapened by being
awarded by fair and square judgment.
Loyalty and the highest achievement
are inspired by a square deal.
