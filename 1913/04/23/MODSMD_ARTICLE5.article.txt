# SENIOR PLAY PICTURES ON DISPLAY TOMORROW
## POSES FROM "SEVEN SISTER" TO BE SEEN ON QUAD. Fosters Will Show Five of the Most Humorous Situations in the Play. 
### 
Poses of animated groups in the
Senior farce "Seven Sisters" will be
exhibited tomorrow morning on the
campus and in Palo Alto.
The pictures that will be shown on
the posters illustrate five of the most
humorous situations in the comedy.
In one group, Gida, the young Baron
Radviany is shown on his return from
the university in Buda Pesth. After
surveying his foppish dress he stupid
ly tells the seven sisters "I have
failed my examinations." Then with
more stupid assurance he announce
that his uncle was unkind to send him
into training for the diplomatic service
anyway.
The camera snaps a tableau in the
second act just after Sari, the second
sister has blushed and said in answer
to Lieutenant Sandorffy's proposal:
"Ask mother." Sandorffy, a young
officer and member of parliment with
many romances to his credit, trembles
as lie turns to "pop the question" to
that Amazon, Widow Gyurkovics.
Lieutenant Horkoy in the third act
climbs through a bedroom window late
at night in masquerade costume. With
the moon streaming on him, he bows
to the wondering children who
clamour at him and says:"I am the
man in the moon, who came down too
soon."
Gida unwittingly climbs through a
boudoir window in order to escape
from the terrors of the night. He is
found there by the entire household,
and is forced to marry Ella, the third
si ter. This scene is the end of the
third act. Mici and Horkoy have suc
ceeded in marrying off all three of
. v 'ici's elder sisters.
The picture that shows the last
morning of a three weeks' wedding
feast is the essence of weariness. But
the Widow Gyurkovics is able to throw
an approving glance at her daughters
and their happy husbands.
