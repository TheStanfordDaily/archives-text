# Freshman Vaudeville
## 
### 
Tomorrow evening the Freshman
class will stage a vaudeville enter-

tainment in
the Varsity
Theater. The

program that has been announced in
cludes a variety of events that would
please the most discriminate, and the
l'act that the proceeds are to go to that
worthy cause, the Stanford Union,
should prove an added incentive for
the members of the University to pat
ronize the show.
The efforts of the Freshmen in
staging this production are to be com
mended. When the youngest mem
bers of the institution get together and
display such "pep" in boosting a
cause in which the entire University
is interested, it speaks well for that
class and for the future of Stanford.
A Freshman class that shows that it
has grasped the real Stanford spirit
like 1916 seems to have done, deserves
the support of the entire Student
Body in any undertaking and partic
ularly in one which is for the benefit
of us all.
