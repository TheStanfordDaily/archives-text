# WHY YOU SHOULD WORRY.
## 
### 
Perchance you are planning for a
party of some kind this week-end.
Perhaps you are planning to go some
place or to appear at some function
in other than your ordinary dress. If
you have any idea of doing anything
out of the ordinary in which your
make-up is to count in the least, in the
words of the slangist "you should
worry." Why? Mac ,the man who
'â€¢dves you clean clothes for soiled ones,
the man who gives out receipts in ex
change for money, the man who makes
you proud when he stands his auto
mobile delivery in front of your very
door twice each week, McKee the
Laundryman, mistook a passing ma
chine for an open speedway yesterday
afternoon and ran directly into it. The
damage was confined solely to both
machines, two drivers, three passen
gers, and a load of wash.
