# DR. CROTHERS CONCLUDES SERIES OF WEST LECTURES
## "WAY OF LOVE" THE THEME OF LAST ADDRESS. Essayist Gives Third View on Relation of Man's Conduct to Destiny. 
### 
Concluding the series of lectures on
the relation of man's conduct to des
tiny, Dr. Samuel McChord Crothers
last evening described the Way of
Love as the third means of escaping
life's prison.
A brief review of the two preced
ing addresses lead up to the conclud
ing thought. The Way of Courage is
that of sheer rebellion, when man sees
that the world about him is wrong
and takes his stand in the middle of
the current against it. This compul
sion by the will must come first. All
is strife and turmoil in this state.
"But then there comes to those who
have really matched their moral selves
against the universe the realization
that there are friendly powers about
them working with them. When he
finds the forces with him he enters
the second or constructive state of
service."
Beginning on the third conclusion
the speiker declared, "Among all the
strife and unrest we find that pathetic
cry for peace and rest. Where can
you find peace? rt must be a return,
a return to the principle of life, an
interpretation and understanding not
of the incidents of life but of life itself.
"In a changing, growing world the
power that joins with the current not
reluctantly and sadly, but wisely and
joyfully is the best. 'Whither thou
goest, I will go." This power is love.
The characteristic of love is attach
ment. Today we come to a new power
in this world which we must invoke
if we are to succeed."
