# SHELDON HURTS WRIST IN CALIFORNIA MATCH
## INJURY CAUSES UPSET IN TENNIS TOURNAMENT. Blue and Gold Duo Defeats Weakened Cardinal Second Team in Straight Sets. 
### 
The straining of the injured tendon
in Captain V. L. Sheldon's right wrist
gave California an unexpected ad
vantage in yesterday's matches in the
Intercollegiate Tennis tournament on
the courts at Berkeley. Sheldon's in
jury caused him to lose the first set
of his match with the Blue and Gold
captain, Charles Rogers, when he was
within one point of taking the set
and necessitated the postponement of
play until this afternoon. The loss of
the Cardinal captain to the first
doubles team made it necessary to
advance W. H. Hutchinson, '15, to the
first doubles team, and to substitute
H. L. Hahn, '16, on the second with L.
Sloss, 'IG. The weakened duo was
then defeated in the only match which
was completed yesterday, by Breeden
and Breck, 6-3, 6-2, 6-4.
In his match with the California
leader, Sheldon was having a com
paratively easy time until his wrist
went back on him. The Cardinal cap
tain took the firs:, four games, play
ing fine tennis and running Rogers
all over the court. The California
player took the next, three only to
lose the eighth game on his own serv
ice, making the score 5-3 in favor of
Sheldon. In the ninth game Sheldon
took the lead and needed but one point
to win the first set when he twisted
his wrist. I'nable to use his right arm,
he changed hands and gamely contin
ued the match. Playing left, handed,
Sheldon was no match for Rogers and
the California skipper took the next
four games and the match, 7-5. The
play was then postponed and will be
resumed today if Sheldon can wield
a racquet.
This afternoon the final matches
are being played. R. L. Murray, '13, is
opposing W. Davis, and Hutchinson is
facing Lipman. In the doubles .Mur
ray and Hutchinson are endeavoring
to take three matches from Davis and
Rogers. The result of the tournament
depends upon the score of today's
contests.
Immediately after the matches at
Berkeley Murray and Hutchinson will
leave for Nordhoff to take part in the
Ojai Valley Tournament. Miss Laura
Herron, '14, and Maud Lowell, '16, will
represent Stanford in the women's
singles and doubles. In the Intercol
legiate matches teams are entered
from Stanford, California, IT. S. C., I'.
S. C. Law School, Pomona, Redlands,
and Occidental.
