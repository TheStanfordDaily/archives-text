### 
Patterned after the well-tried model
of former year-books, but embodying
as well original features of merit, the
1914 "Quad" will be distributed upon
the campus Thursday. This is the date
originally set for the sale of the
annual.
The 1914 "Quad" will contain more
than 500 pages, a number in excess of
that in last year's volume. Editor C. C.
Close and Manager S. J. W. Sharp
have, however, bent their efforts
chiefly upon quality rather than upon
quantity. A distinctive feature of the
forthcoming book will be the color
work. Seven colored inserts will
mark the volume. It will as well be

lighter and finer grade of stock being
used. The illustrations and art work
are of a high order.
The Quad will contain all the usual
departments, and for the convenience
oi' readers the customary arrange
ment will be followed. It will include
the two departures of last year's an
nual, sorority pictures and a complete
account of spring athletics.
