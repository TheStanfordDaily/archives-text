# Vote

### 
Tomorrow the members of the Stan
ford Student Body are to chose the

men who are to take charge of
their affairs for tlie year 1913-
14. The positions to lie filled at

this time are the most important offi
ces in the undergraduate body and the
men who are to be selected must not
be chosen at random. Every individ
ual voter should decide for himself
which candidates he desires to see in
office and vote accordingly. Above all
things don't fail to vote. It is the duty
of every member of the University who
lias paid his or her Student Body as
sessment to cast a ballot at tomor
row's election. Don't stay at home
and abide by the other fellow's deci
sion. More than one good man has
been defeated on this account.
