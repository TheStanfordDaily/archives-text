# Vote Yes

There is an apparent misunder
standing,—or rather lack of any under-

standing,—on the part of a
great number of the Student
Body in regard to the proposed
amendment to turn the Sequoia

over to the English Club. This
amendment was drawn up by the Ex
ecutive Committee after reviewing the
present situation and it was deemed
to be the only way to plane the maga
zine on its proper footing. The Eng
lish Clu 1) willingly accepted the pro
posal and it h;is been heartily in
dorsed by the present editor and man
ager of the Sequoia.
Hut to make the scheme effective re
quires a two-thirds vote of the Stu
dent Body. Tomorrow the matter will
be put before the students for them to
say what shall become of the monthly
paper. This amendment is an import
ant one and must be voted upon by
all. Don't neglect to mark yoilr ballot
opposite the amendment. Otherwise
the proposal will be lost and the
Sequoia will be left to pursue its
feeble existence or die.
