# WITS OF OTHER SCHOOLS FILL CURRENT CHAPARRAL
## EXCHANGE NUMBER OF COMIC IS DUE TOMORROW. Stanford Humorous Publication Clipped More Times Than Any Other Similar Paper. 
### 
The Chaparral is scheduled to ap
pear on the Quad tomorrow morning
in a form that should he a welcome'
novelty to its many readers. Chappie
calls it amexchange number, and it is
filled from cover to cover with a col
lection of tiie best art, verse, and
prose which has appeared in the col
lege comics of the country during the
current year.
Chappie has gone through the
eighteen comics that come regularly
to his desk and picked out what ap
pealed to him as the best and most
representative humor of the college
world. So far as is known no such
collection of college fun has ever been
attempted anywhere before, and this
exchange number should prove as in
teresting as it is unique.
During the year Chappie has kept
an accurate tally of the clipping col
umns in all the college comics. A
couple of weeks ago on totaling then 1 )
up he was surprised to find that the
Chaparral had been clipped more
limes than any of the others, with the
Cornell Widow second, the Yale Rec
ord third, and the California Pelican
fourth. The total number of jokes
clipped from these four follow: Chap
arral 242; Widow, 175; Record, 13S;
Pelican 130.
The Now Thats in this issue deal
with College comics, the recent track
victory, the proposed change in the
Sequoia management, and Senior
Week.
