# Y.M.C.A. TICKETS ENHANCED BY STATE WIDE RECOGNITION
## Membership on Local Tickets Made Transferable by State Convention. 
### 
Two great advantages have been
gained by the Stanford Y. M. C. A. ia
the extension of the full club and
social privileges of all holders of stu
dent tickets to any city association
in the state, and the reciprocal recog
nition by the Stanford club of tickets
held by incoming students from other
associations.
The first step in this direction was
taken by the Bay City Association in
cluding San Francisco, Oakland and
Berkeley. As a result of this action
J. P. Hagerman, the Stanford secre
tary, placed the matter before the
State Convention and largely due to
his efforts the state wide recognition
was granted.
it was stipulated in the agreement
that the new clause will only go into
effect when the person takes out his
membership in the fall at Stanford
and names the city association with
which he is affiliated.
A Stanford ticket holder can now
transfer his membership during the
summer and will also be allowed to
purchase such additional privileges
as may be desired at the same rates as
the regular city members. This will
be a great benefit to the University
\ssociation and greatly increase the
membership.
