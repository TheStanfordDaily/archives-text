# VARSITY S MEN ESTABLISH CUSTOM OF SACRIFICE
## 
### 
Establishing a new custom all
Varsity S men in the University met
last evening in an informal gathering
to celebrate the events of the past
i year. A large bonfire on the baseball
I field attracted the throng around
j which the members of the different
Intercollegiate teams met.
The idea for the final gathering of
the athletes was worked up and pro
moted by L. Cass, '13, and B, F. Kern,
; '13. At the gathering it was decided
: to make the event a permanent affair
to be handled by the different captains
at the end of each college year. The
evening closed with a monstrous ser
pentine around the fire into which
| each man threw a part of his playing
j uniform as a token to Cardinal the
I Cod of Victory.
