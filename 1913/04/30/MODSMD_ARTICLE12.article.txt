# Senior Week
## 
### 
The past two years have witnessed
the evolution oi' Senior Week from a

mere epilogue to four
years of university life
to a genuine Com-

mencement Week. Prior to 1911 the
final days of the year were devoted to
a formal program which was partici
pated in by a few members of the grad
uating class. Today the Commencement
Week festivities are coming more and
more to be enjoyed by Stanford stu
dents past and present. We are at last
beginning to realize the great good
that can result from a general meeting
of alumni and undergrauates and par
ticularly at a time when we are all
relieved from work and worries of
studies and business.
Among our more ancient Eastern
contemporaries Commencement Week
is looked upon as the crowning event
of the year. Old grads come back by
the hundreds and revel in the joys of
college life once more. The present
generation remain to enjoy the great
est of all weeks in the year.
To the Eastern universities the col
lege year is not finished until the last
night of Commencement Week. The
1911 Class was the first to see a move
in this direction at Stanford. 1912 saw
it grow and it is now up to 1913 to
push it ahead another notch. It will
take time to make our Senior Week
what it ought to be but it must come
and the sooner the better.
We must get the alumni imbued with
the idea of returning and to do this
requires the co-operation of the entire
University, not just the Seniors. The
Stanford graduates must have some in
centive to come back and it is up to
us to furnish that incentive.
The program as arranged by the
1913 Senior Week committees is an

improvement over those of the past
years. There is not a member or
friend of Stanford University who
would not enjoy such an affair. What
we must do now is to pass the word
along to the alumni. The old grads
didn't have anything to compare with
it in their day and many are unaware
of the advancement that has been
made.
We cannot bring them all back in
one year, or two, or three, but if the
present members of Stanford take the
proper interest in Senior Week it will
not be long before we will have the
alumni returning from all sections of
the country. "Seeing is believing,"
and when those that have gone before
us see that there is such an interest
taken in Commencement Week that
the entire student body remains, —in-
stead of a small part of the Senior
Class, —then, and not until then, will
they realize that there must be some
thing in it after all. It will bring them
back to the campus and that is what
we want to do. We need them here.
