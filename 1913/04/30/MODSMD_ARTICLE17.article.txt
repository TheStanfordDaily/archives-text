# FREE-FOR-ALL BRAWL FOLLOWS ALTERCATION IN THE LAW LIBRARY
## 
### 
Charges of assault and battery will
bo preferred against C. H, Warlow, '11,
by M. T. Dooling, '11, in room 12 of
the Law Building tomorrow afternoon
at 1:30, the trial to be conducted by
members of the department. G. A.
Ditz, '11, will appear as counsel for
the plaintiff, and S. W. Guthrie, '13,
will act for the defendant.
Yesterday afternoon four graduate
law students of the Class of '11, em
broiled themselves and the occupants
of the crowded law library in a battle
of words and blows, in which Dooling
claims that Warlow knocked him to
the floor without provocation and ser
iously injured his head.
Accounts of the trouble are widely
varied, but the general facts of the
affair, gathered from friends of both
sides are these:
In spite of a rule to the contrary,
Ditz carried a California Code book
from its place, and kept it in another
part of the library an undue time.
Warlow objected to the act, and an
altercation followed in which forceful
language was used by both parties.
Disregarding raps for silence, the dis
putants continued to threaten and
abuse each other.
Then it was that elementary law
drawn into the trouble. A free-for-all
drawn in the trouble. A free-for-all
conflict followed, which was at last
quieted by E. W. Pugh, '11, who rushed
across the room on top of the reading
desks.
The quarrel, blows, and general
pandemonium were planned by Profes
sors F. C. Woodward and S. W.
Charles in conjunction with M. T.
Dooling, E. W. Pugh, G. A. Dilz, and C'.
H. Warlow, who wanted to provide
realistic grounds for a moot court
1 rial.
