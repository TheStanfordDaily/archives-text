The Electrical Engineering Depart
ment is at present making experi
ments on the causes of failure of
string insulators on high tension
transmission lines. String insulators
have been in use for live years on
110,000 lo 175,000 volt lines and al
though many tests have been made in
—— S

the laboratories, yet under natural
conditions, not entirely known but
sometimes attributed to lightning,
they have been known to fail. It is to
find and bring these natural condi
tions, causing the failures, into the
laboratory so that complete tests can
be made, that Professor Ryan is
working.
