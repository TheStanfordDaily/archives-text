# STANFORD ENTERS TEAM IN COAST CONFERENCE MEET
## Thirteen Cardinal Athletes to Contest With Leading Representatives of Nine Colleges on May 10. 
### 
Thirteen athletes of the victorious
1 li 13 Cardinal track team will probably
don their togs again on May 10 and
enter the Pacific Coast Conference
meet, at Berkeley. This will not be the
strongest team that Stanford can put
in the field and the team does not enter
with the certain prospects of a victory.
Examinations materially hinder the
work of the track team and for that
reason several of the sure point win
ners will not be included in the list
of entries.
Those who will represent Stanford
are Captain E. P. Campbell, '13, E. M.
Ronnett, '15, W. J. Dodge, '13, P. S.
Murray, '1(>, I). Dawson, '15, J. A. Mil
ler, '13, V. Stevens, '13, P. E. McClure,
'15, M. L. McNair, *15, R. W. Brown,
'13, J. W. Richdale, '14, C. W. Knight,
'14, and R. Krohn, '16.
Nine universities and colleges will
be represented in the Conference meet
which is the only meet of its kind west
of the Rocky mountains. Fifteen men

are allowed to compete from each in
stitution entered, but California is the
only one that will send a full team into
the field.
The institutions which will be repre
sented will be Stanford, California,
University of Washington, University
of Oregon, Oregon Agricultural Col
lege, University of Southern Califor
nia, St. Mary's and Santa Clara.
