# PROGRAM FOR CLASS DAY CEREMONIES IS COMPLETE
## OUTDOOR EXERCISES WILL BE A NEW DEPARTURE For First Time Reception Will Not be Held at Jordan Home Because of Mrs. Jordan's Illness. 
### 
Class Day will be observed on Fri
day, May 16. The exercises will in
clude some of the most interesting an
nual customs of Commencement
The program of exercises that will
be followed is: Reading of the history
of the class of 1913, by H. L. Loud;
reading of the will, by J. L. Duff; the
oration, by E. C. Smith, and the ad
dress of the class president, by I. 1.
Ingraham.
A new departure will be made by
holding the exercises out of doors this
year. Just what part of the campus
will be used for the ceremonies is un
decided. It was hoped at first that the
Memorial Court might be used, but the
plan was abandoned because prepara
tions will be in progress for the
Senior Prom which is to be held in
the evening.
Immediately after the exercises,
the 1913 class plate will be placed
on the walk in front of the Memorial
Church, and dedicated. The plate
has been procured, and the contract
let for placing it.
At the close of the dedication,
Seniors and Juniors will go to the
Mausoleum, where the memorial
duties of the graduating class
will be transferred to the care of
1914 class.
Prom Arrangements Complete
The last arrangements are complete
for the Senior Prom on the Inner
Quad. Labor has been employed to en
close the section used with burlap
wind shields, and to construct refresh
ment booths which will be occupied by
the sororities.
For the first time the entire Stan
ford band will play for the pronienad
ers who enjoy the fun on the Quad at
the Prom. Unique lighting effects will
bring about a pleasant combination of
light and shadows that will be re
flected throught the arcades and
arches of the Quad.
Dr. and Mrs. Jordan will not be
al)le to hold their usual reception to
tho graduating class. The cause for
the change is Mrs. Jordan's ill
health. Both Dr. and Mrs. Jordan
have expressed their regret that they
cannot offer the usual hospitality.
This will be the first time since the
organization of the university that the
Jordan home has net been used for a
reception to the Seniors.
