# EXCELLENT "QUAD" HAS LARGE DISTRIBUTION
## CUTS NOTABLE FOR QUALITY AND QUANTITY Annual Published by Class of 1914 Finds High Favor from Readers Today 
### 
The red row on the shelf has been
lengthened a few inches by the addi
tion of the 1914 "Quad." In the in
terests of strict truth, however, as
well as to give due credit to the pro
duct of Editor Close, Manager Sharp,
and their assistants, it must be con
fessed that the book is probably not
on the shell' as yet. All those fortun
ate enough to obtain a copy in the
first distribution this morning and not
cursed with afternoon classes are
still perusing its interesting con
tents. For the volume possesses the
enviable quality of attracting atten
tion and then holding it.
Cuts are Numerous
It attracts attention through its
careful make-up and typographical ex
cellence, its color inserts, the origin
ality and quality of its art work, and
its profuse and excellent illustrations.
The cuts are much more numerous
than in any "Quad" which can at this
time be recalled. Moreover, some of
them are remarkable, notably the
large action picture of the Big Game.
The colored inserts find favor as a
novelty, even though all of them are
not in themselves remarkable as spe
cimens of the color printer's art. The
handsome buff stock on which they
are printed, moreover, lends a pleas
ing variety as the pages of the book
arc turned. Speaking of stock, a word
must be said for the attractive nature
of the light but highly glazed paper
upon which the book as a whole is
printed. Not only does it exhibit the
cuts and art work to advantage, but it
permits a slight increase in the num
ber of pages along with a decrease of
cumbersomeness.
A Good Start
On first opening the "Quad" one
cannot but believe that it has put its
best foot foremost. The book-plate,
the dedication to and cut of Vice-
President J. C. Brainier, the cut of the
beautiful University Library book
plate, and the strong and simple
"Confession of Faith" by President
David Starr Jordan, are features of
unusual merit. But on looking fur
ther through the "Quad" one finds the
standard maintained throughout the
500 pages.
It is readable and interesting; it is
notably well edited and well arranged;
and as you close it after a look at the
joshes you do so with a real chuckle—
and you are not chuckling entirely at
"prep-school" humor at that.
Wisely and well, the editors of the
1914 annual have followed the time
honored arrangement and style set
by a long line of good "Quads." By
careful workmanship and a judicious
insertion of original features, they
have place a unique stamp of excel
lence upon their own production.
The "Quads" sold heavily at the
Law Steps at 10:15 this morning. The
sale will continue at the same time
and place tomorrow.

The cuts are much more numerous
than in any "Quad" which can at this
time be recalled. Moreover, some of
them are remarkable, notably the
large action picture of the Big Game.
The colored inserts find favor as a
novelty, even though all of them are
not in themselves remarkable as spe
cimens of the color printer's art. The
handsome buff stock on which they
are printed, moreover, lends a pleas
ing variety as the pages of the book
arc turned. Speaking of stock, a word
must be said for the attractive nature
of the light but highly glazed paper
upon which the book as a whole is
printed. Not only does it exhibit the
cuts and art work to advantage, but it
permits a slight increase in the num
ber of pages along with a decrease of
cumbersomeness.
A Good Start
On first opening the "Quad" one
cannot but believe that it has put its
best foot foremost. The book-plate,
the dedication to and cut of Vice-
President J. C. Brainier, the cut of the
beautiful University Library book
plate, and the strong and simple
"Confession of Faith" by President
David Starr Jordan, are features of
unusual merit. But on looking fur
ther through the "Quad" one finds the
standard maintained throughout the
500 pages.
It is readable and interesting; it is
notably well edited and well arranged;
and as you close it after a look at the
joshes you do so with a real chuckle—
and you are not chuckling entirely at
"prep-school" humor at that.
Wisely and well, the editors of the
1914 annual have followed the time
honored arrangement and style set
by a long line of good "Quads." By
careful workmanship and a judicious
insertion of original features, they
have place a unique stamp of excel
lence upon their own production.
The "Quads" sold heavily at the
Law Steps at 10:15 this morning. The
sale will continue at the same time
and place tomorrow.
The red row on the shelf has been
lengthened a few inches by the addi
tion of the 1914 "Quad." In the in
terests of strict truth, however, as
well as to give due credit to the pro
duct of Editor Close, Manager Sharp,
and their assistants, it must be con
fessed that the book is probably not
on the shell' as yet. All those fortun
ate enough to obtain a copy in the
first distribution this morning and not
cursed with afternoon classes are
still perusing its interesting con
tents. For the volume possesses the
enviable quality of attracting atten
tion and then holding it.
Cuts are Numerous
It attracts attention through its
careful make-up and typographical ex
cellence, its color inserts, the origin
ality and quality of its art work, and
its profuse and excellent illustrations.
