# SENIORS WILL WEAR CAP AND GOWN THROUGH WEEK
## Collegiate Atmosphere to be Enhanced by Wearing of Time-Honored Garb. 
### 
All members of the class of 1913
will don Cap and Gown on the morn
ing of Friday, May 16, and will wear
the traditional robe of the Senior
throughout the week. This was the
decision reached at a meeting of the
Senior class this afternoon, when the
graduating students met for a dis
cussion of the events to come during
the last week of the semester. In
past years the gowns have been dis
carded except for a few special occa
sions, but in the coining days of class
celebration the black robes will be
"de rigueur."
A. W. Ambrose was chosen by the
class as their representative on the
Advisory Board of the Alumni Asso
ciation.
J. B. McDowell addressed the class,
urging attendance at the Alamni din
ner on Saturday, the 17th, where the
members of the class will meet with
the Alumni for the first time. At ibis
time one of the class will respond to
the address of welcome made by an
Alumnus, who is yet to he chosen.
