The Stanford Student Body should
congratulate itself 011 securing Floyd

Brown to act as foot
ball coach next fall. It
would be impossible to

find a man better qualified for the
position. For four years Brown was
a star player on Stanford's Varsity
teams. During that time he was a
close student of the game under those
two famous teachers Jimmie Lana
gan and George Presley. A clean
sportsman, honest as the day is long,
Brown takes charge of the team next
year with the absolute confidence of
every Stanford student and alumnus.
With such a man as Brown at the
helm and with George J. Presley cast
ing a watchful eye over the Cardinal
football destinies there is only one
possible result for the 1913 season,
SUCCESS.
