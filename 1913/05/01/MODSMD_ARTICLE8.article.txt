It. is with no little regret that we
announce the resignation ot' J. P.

Hagerman from the posi
tion of secretary of the
ford Y. M. C. A. Coming

here but one year ago and at a time
when the Y. M. C. A. was anything but
popular, Hagerman set out to put the
organization on its feet. What he
has accomplished in this short time is
well known to all Stanford students.
Nor has he confined his attentions to
this one branch of work. From the
first day he arrived he has taken a
keen interest in student activities,
and the services he has rendered the
various athletic teams, and particu
larly the track squad, have been of
unspeakable value. Stanford is loath
to part with such a valuable man as
Mr. nagerman but extenuating circum
stances make it impossible for him
to remain. May his successor prove
to be as good as he.
