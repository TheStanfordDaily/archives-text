# DANCE REPRESENTATIVES MAKE RECOMMENDATION
## OVERCROWDING OP CALENDAR MAY BE PREVENTED Rules Avoiding Conflicts of Dates Have Been Submitted to Organizations for Approval. 
### 
Representatives of the fraternities,
sororities, and clubs last evening de
cided to submit to these various organ
izations a set of recommendations
which if ratified will be understood to
govern the future method of secur
ing dates for campus functions. These
resolutions have as their purpose the
elimination of present overcrowding
the social calendar at certain points.
They also aim to pi event undue con
flict with affairs which interest a com
paratively large number of students,
namely, performance of the dramatic
and musical organizations, official uni
versity and class functions, and the
Encina and Roble dances. This is to
be accomplished by opening the date
book exclusively to these organizations
during the remainder of the Spring
semester and the two first weeks of
the Fall semester, after which it will
bo open to all in the usual manner.
Conflicts Impossible
It is not expected that the new
system will entirely eliminate con
flicts of dates. This is rendered a
physical impossibility by the fact that
there are more organizations giving
dances than there are available dates.
But it is hoped to more evenly dis
tribute the various functions through
out the entire year. The present meth
od of using the "Date Book" does not
work to this end. This is due to the
fact that when it is open in the Fall
semester the most desirable dates are
immediately taken and as a result the
majority of the organizations postpone
their functions until the second
semester.
in order to encourage the replacing
of formal underclassmen dances by
less elaborate informal affairs, and
also to avoid the conflicts between the
house formals and those dances which
are to be favored as interesting a
larger number of students, provisions
were adopted recommending that each
fraternity, sorority and house club
shall give but one formal representa
tive dance a year. This date is to be
the only one entered in the date book
by that organization. This in no way
places a limit upon the number of in
formals which may be given.
To Start Early
To meet objectionable features
found by some in the ruling of the
Conferences that all dances must close
at twelve o'clock, a recommendation
was inserted to the effect that dances
start at an earlier hour.
The representatives last evening
adopted seven recommendations drawn
up by a subcommittee appointed at a
previous meeting, and added recom
mendation eight. A copy of the pro
posed legislation was sent today to nil
of the organizaations concerned.
These bodies are asked to take imme
diate action upon them and to mail
notice of ratification or rejection to
K. L. Schaupp before Tuesday. If ac
cepted the rules will be considered to
