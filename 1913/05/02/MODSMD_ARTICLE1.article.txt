# DANCE REPRESENTATIVES MAKE RECOMMENDATION
## OVERCROWDING OP CALENDAR MAY BE PREVENTED Rules Avoiding Conflicts of Dates Have Been Submitted to Organizations for Approval. 
### 
Representatives of the fraternities,
sororities, and clubs last evening de
cided to submit to these various organ
izations a set of recommendations
which if ratified will be understood to
govern the future method of secur
ing dates for campus functions. These
resolutions have as their purpose the
elimination of present overcrowding
the social calendar at certain points.
They also aim to pi event undue con
flict with affairs which interest a com
paratively large number of students,
namely, performance of the dramatic
and musical organizations, official uni
versity and class functions, and the
Encina and Roble dances. This is to
be accomplished by opening the date
book exclusively to these organizations
during the remainder of the Spring
semester and the two first weeks of
the Fall semester, after which it will
bo open to all in the usual manner.
Conflicts Impossible
It is not expected that the new
system will entirely eliminate con
flicts of dates. This is rendered a
physical impossibility by the fact that
there are more organizations giving
dances than there are available dates.
But it is hoped to more evenly dis
tribute the various functions through
out the entire year. The present meth
od of using the "Date Book" does not
work to this end. This is due to the
fact that when it is open in the Fall
semester the most desirable dates are
immediately taken and as a result the
majority of the organizations postpone
their functions until the second
semester.
in order to encourage the replacing
of formal underclassmen dances by
less elaborate informal affairs, and
also to avoid the conflicts between the
house formals and those dances which
are to be favored as interesting a
larger number of students, provisions
were adopted recommending that each
fraternity, sorority and house club
shall give but one formal representa
tive dance a year. This date is to be
the only one entered in the date book
by that organization. This in no way
places a limit upon the number of in
formals which may be given.
To Start Early
To meet objectionable features
found by some in the ruling of the
Conferences that all dances must close
at twelve o'clock, a recommendation
was inserted to the effect that dances
start at an earlier hour.
The representatives last evening
adopted seven recommendations drawn
up by a subcommittee appointed at a
previous meeting, and added recom
mendation eight. A copy of the pro
posed legislation was sent today to nil
of the organizaations concerned.
These bodies are asked to take imme
diate action upon them and to mail
notice of ratification or rejection to
K. L. Schaupp before Tuesday. If ac
cepted the rules will be considered to
constitute a binding agreement be
[ tween the organizations. This will be
their only sanction, since they in no
way emanate from either of the Con
. ferences.
The recommendations follow:
(1) That two weeks before the last
day of collegiate instruction of the
t Spring semester, a suitable date book
be placed in the Registrar's office in
which all organizations shall enlist
their functions for the coming year
which concern the entire student body
| or a representative assemblage from
j the entire student body.
>j (2) That during the remainder of
the Spring semester and the first week
j of the Fall semester, only those func
tions which will interest a compara
tively large number of students shall
|be entered. It is intended by this rec-
J ommendation that representatives of
J dramatic and musical organizations
1 shall enter the dates of their perform
ances; that the president of the stu
dent body shall enter the dates of im
portant university functions; that
class presidents shall enter the dates of
class plays and class dances; and that
the presidents of Encina and Roble
clubs shall enter the dates of their
dances.
(3) That one week after registra
tion in the Fall, the book be thrown
open to the fraternities, sororities and
house clubs, according to the custom
in vogue at the present time.
(4) That each fraternity, sorority
and house club shall hold but one
formal representative dance a year.
(.">) That the fraternities, sororities
and house clubs shall enter the dates
of their respective formal representa
tive dances and those only, and shall
avoid conflicts with those functions
named in recommendation two, namely
musical and dramatic performances,
official class and university functions.

(6) That no invitations shall be is
! sued until the date has been entered in
the date book.
(7) That if possible the dances on
I the campus be started at an earlier
j hour.
(5) And it. is further recommended
that invit itions not be sent out more
than six weeks in advance of a formal
dance.

that invit itions not be sent out more

Representatives of the fraternities,
sororities, and clubs last evening de
cided to submit to these various organ
izations a set of recommendations
which if ratified will be understood to
govern the future method of secur
ing dates for campus functions. These
resolutions have as their purpose the
elimination of present overcrowding
the social calendar at certain points.
They also aim to pi event undue con
flict with affairs which interest a com
paratively large number of students,
namely, performance of the dramatic
and musical organizations, official uni
versity and class functions, and the
Encina and Roble dances. This is to
be accomplished by opening the date
book exclusively to these organizations
during the remainder of the Spring
semester and the two first weeks of
the Fall semester, after which it will
bo open to all in the usual manner.
Conflicts Impossible
It is not expected that the new
system will entirely eliminate con
flicts of dates. This is rendered a
physical impossibility by the fact that
there are more organizations giving
dances than there are available dates.
But it is hoped to more evenly dis
tribute the various functions through
out the entire year. The present meth
od of using the "Date Book" does not
work to this end. This is due to the
fact that when it is open in the Fall
semester the most desirable dates are
immediately taken and as a result the
majority of the organizations postpone
their functions until the second
semester.
in order to encourage the replacing
of formal underclassmen dances by
less elaborate informal affairs, and
also to avoid the conflicts between the
house formals and those dances which
are to be favored as interesting a
larger number of students, provisions
were adopted recommending that each
fraternity, sorority and house club
shall give but one formal representa
tive dance a year. This date is to be
the only one entered in the date book
by that organization. This in no way
places a limit upon the number of in
formals which may be given.
To Start Early
To meet objectionable features
found by some in the ruling of the
Conferences that all dances must close
at twelve o'clock, a recommendation
was inserted to the effect that dances
start at an earlier hour.
The representatives last evening
adopted seven recommendations drawn
up by a subcommittee appointed at a
previous meeting, and added recom
mendation eight. A copy of the pro
posed legislation was sent today to nil
of the organizaations concerned.
These bodies are asked to take imme
diate action upon them and to mail
notice of ratification or rejection to
K. L. Schaupp before Tuesday. If ac
cepted the rules will be considered to
constitute a binding agreement be
[ tween the organizations. This will be
their only sanction, since they in no
way emanate from either of the Con
. ferences.
The recommendations follow:
(1) That two weeks before the last
day of collegiate instruction of the
t Spring semester, a suitable date book
be placed in the Registrar's office in
which all organizations shall enlist
their functions for the coming year
which concern the entire student body
| or a representative assemblage from
j the entire student body.

the Spring semester and the first week

ances; that the president of the stu
