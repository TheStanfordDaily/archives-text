# Deserved
## 
### 
The Daily Palo Alto heartily in
dorses the communication from Tom

Coleman which is published
in this issue. The block
"S" is supposed to be, and

is awarded to men who earn it. To
take a place in an Intercollegiate track
meet is considered grounds upon which
an "S" is given. Placing is usually de
termined by the points earned, but
when a man wins a place and fails to
receive the points because one man
failed in the performance of his duty
as judge it is inconsistent to say that
that athlete does not deserve his "S."
At the time the hundred was run in
the last meet it was conceeded by
everyone that McNair was third. Since
then the pictures have coroborated the
spectators' impressions. Obviously
then McNair is entitled to the block
"S."
