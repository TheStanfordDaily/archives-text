Editor The Daily Palo Alto:
To every Stanford man present or
past the "S" has been a badge of
honor to which each man aspires.
Some men have worked for years unre
warded in their ambition to get this
emblem. Every Stanford man cannot
help but agree that a man that earns
his "S" should have it.
To several thousand people who
saw the last Intercollegiate meet it
was plainly evident that McNair earned
third place in the 100-yard dash, and
for some reason was overlooked by the
judges.
To those who would argue against
this position I should like to give two
proofs in favor of it.
1 The crowd as eye witnesses.
2 Every picture yet shown of the
race.
Pictures are the best means of judg
ing close finishes of foot races as is
shown by their adoption by the Olym
pic Games Committee last year.
That the judges relied on them was
proven in the 1,500 meter race in
Stockholm where the finish was so
close between four men that no deci
sion was given until the pictures taken
of the race were developed.
Fui Woods, next year's captain of
California, tolls with his eyes his opin
ion of who was third. Anyone who
knows track knows that the men run
ning behind involuntarily glance at
the man just ahead in a close finish.
It seems to me that in justice to Mc-
Nair he should be given his "S." It is
the judgment of thousands against that
of one man and that, one man proved
himself further incompetent in the 220.
The executive committee has the
power to take this action and a former
committee did this in the famous Pete
Daly case in 1907. Daly did not get
into a baseball game because he re
fused to go in when the chance was
offered him. He was voted a letter
however, and the student body ap
plauded to a man. McNair did get
into the game and did the work.
