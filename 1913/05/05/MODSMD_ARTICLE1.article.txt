Sword and Sandals will usher in
the dramatic season next semester

given September 26. F. L. Mathieu
has been engaged as coach and will
come to the campus next Monday with
several plays, from which Sword and
Sandals will make its final selection.
Parts will be assigned before the
close of the semester, so that the

of studying their roles during the
summer.
