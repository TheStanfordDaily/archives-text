The editor, manager and staff of the
1914 Quad are to be congratulated

upon the success of this year's
annual. The Volume XX is
up to the standard of former

years in every particular and also in
cludes several new features. The fact
that the Quad is intended to lie a rec
ord of a year's activities makes it in
advisable and practically impossible
to introduce any radical changes and
each succeeding editor has kept this
object in view.
Hut there is one change in the com
position of the Quad that should be
made and one which would eliminate
a great number of dead pages. That
is tbe granting of two pages to each of
the fraternities and sororities instead
of four. The Quad, while still main
taining its position as a University
chronicle, should be made as interest
ing as possible but the chapter rolls
and the blank pages are unnecessary
and unattractive. Furthermore, with
the growth in University activities the
Annual becomes bulkier and in time
will assume too great proportions, if
it has not already. The removal of
these two pages would reduce the size
by fifty-six pages. We would like to
see the 1915 editor depart from the
established custom. It will make the
book just as complete and more com
posite.
