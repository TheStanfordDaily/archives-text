# TRI-STATE DEBATES TO BE HELD LATER IN YEAR
## Proposed Question of Next Year's Stanford-California Contest Has Been Submitted 
### 
By an amendment just adopted to
the Tri-State debating agreement, the
date of these contests is changed from
the last Friday in March to an evening
two weeks previous to this time. The
amendment was submitted by the
Stanford debating authorities and
ratified by the Universities of Oregon
and Washington. Its purpose is to
avoid the present conflict of the tri
angular debates with the Stanford
Junior Week festivities.
E. C. Smith, '13, secretary of the In
tercollegiate Debate Committee, has
submitted to California as the quest
tion for next year's Stanford-Califor
nia contest, "Resolved, That the immi
gration of unskilled laborers of the
Slavonic, Hellenic and Italic races of
Eastern and Southeastern Europe
should be prohibited." This was the
topic argued in the recent Tri-State
debates. It is expected that Califor
nia will submit her choice of sides
at the beginning of next semester.
