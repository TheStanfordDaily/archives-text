# NATIONAL REALISM IN SENIOR FARCE
## 
### 
Much of the charm that courses
through the action of the Senior play
"Seven Sisters" is an undercurrent of
national realism. Hungary is an ad
mirable place for the setting of a
romantic comedy of the "Seven
Sisters" type. With the male char
acters chosen from the ranks of army
gallants, and the women from a peas
ant family, there is rich opportunity
for coloring the play with touches of
varied social and personal character
istics.
Vienna, the Austrian capital, has
been a favorite location for many
musical comedy productions, but its
sister city Buda Pesth has not been
explored for dramatic possibilities.
The comedy that will be played in
the Assembly Hall on May 14. offers
much more opportunity for true-to-life
pictures than the musical productions,

which seldom venture outside cafes
for the action.
In adapting "Seven Sisters" for the
American stage, as much colloquial
flavor has been retained as is pos
sible in a translation.
Quaint peasant customs are inserted
in the first act to make the Gyurkovics
household seem a real institution.
Mici, the fourth sister( Miss Emily
Coleman, '13) retains the use of
charming little native expressions of
one syllable throughout the play, and
helps to make her role distinctively
individual by the use of often repeated
gestures.
Neither the setting nor the people of
"Seven Sisters" are strained to an un
natural degree. No mental gymnas
tics on the part of the audience are re
quired to reconcile impossible situa
tions, and actions.


"Why, It's Gida!"
