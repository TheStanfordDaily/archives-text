Week, set. aside for the ceremonies

and festivities of gradua
tion time, in past years
successively greater num-

bens "of students and alumni have been
(in the camnus to take part in the
pleasures that follow final examina
tions. We may hope that from prece
dent still more Stanford men and wo
men, both graduate and undergraduate,
will stay over or return to enjoy the
program that has been prepared by the
class of 1913.
The fact remain- that :•">•> mai \ of
the student body, especially from the
underclasses are looking to the day
of the last ex as an opportunity to
pack grips for home; The college year
does not close on the day that, the last
examination is finished, and until that
fact, is absorbed by Stanford men and
women, Senior Week will not lie mo:-r
successful. The program of he period
is intended for the use of all the
classes, and in proportion
terest alumni will be induced to share,
the Stanford spirit in reunion with the
younger sons.
Commencement Week 111 many uni

what it js intended to be. It is the one
bi.y opportunity of the year for the
gathering in of those who have gone
before, to re-unite, to brighten the
loyalty and purpose of the under
graduates, and to share the fun.
We want, the old grads back with 11s,
so stay on the campus, and let them
know that they can find us here when
they come. We want those who come
this year to come again next year, and
to bring others with them. Be hero
to meet them.
