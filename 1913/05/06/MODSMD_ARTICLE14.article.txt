# Sponsorship

### 
The plan for upperclass sponsor
ship of first your women students that

will be followed next
year should meet with
wide approval. An ar-

rangement to have women of the upper
class act as chaperones and advisors
of Freshmen was nominally in force

I last year, but was not closely followed.
A general committee of ten women,
will supervise the work of forty
sponsors. Each sponsor is to have
three Freshmen under her advice.
The benefit of such a system to new
students will be great in giving them
advantage of the experience and
knowledge of Stanford conditions that
belongs to members of the upper
classes.
