The Stanford band of thirty-two
pieces will make their last trip of tlie
season this afternoon when they leave
for San Jose at 1:iJ0. The band will
give an afternoon concert beginning at
2:30 in the State Normal Auditorium
to tin' Normal and San .lose High
school students. The numbers, com
posed of popular operatic and college
iiirs will be the same as those rendered
on the Southern tour.
The last trip taken by the hand was
in every way successful as lias been
attested to by tbe different schools and
clubs before which the organization
gave concerts.
The main reason for giving this con
cert is to enable the band to pay off
the small deficit incurred by the trip
South.
