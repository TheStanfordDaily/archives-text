Students of astronomy in the Ap
plied .Mathematics Department now
have a new universal instrument for
determination of time, latitude and
longitude. The instrument is from the
work shop of Carl Bamberg, of
Friedenau, Germany. By the use of a
microme'.er eyepiece, observations of
great accuracy can he made with the
instrument. It will be used by students
of geodesy in triangulation work.
