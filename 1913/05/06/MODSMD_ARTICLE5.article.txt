# FALL RUGBY LIST LOOKS PROMISING
## 
### 
Commencement of spring football
practice has caused much speculation
as to the probable line-up for next
November. A cursory glance over the
list of next fall's eliglbles reveals a
material chance for success on the
til!'!' fie!#
The game will be played at Stanford
field, I<■ • iillno opportunity for a
mud-pie contest. With Floyd Brown
and George Presley to coach the team,
and Trainer Maloney back to mould
them into condition, another brilliant
season is predicted. Five of last year's
men are rendered ineligible by the
ib V \i. SanU> .'1 3k K P..
Corbet, 12, K. L. Schaupp, '112, R. M.
Noble, '1 J. and li. E. Erb. '12.
Of the •veterans among the forwards,
E. li. Hall. '14, F. li. Wat kins, 14, W.
P. Darsie, "14, and F. .1. (lard, '14, will
return to college in August. It was
rumored that Card would go East to
Ames Agricultural College in lowa, but
he has decided to remain here for bis
\. li. Other strong c mdidates for the
scrum will lie E, 1,. Peck, *13, li. Sin
clair. 'la, 11.I 1 . p. Clover, 'I I, ami L. C.
Decitis, '13, who substituted on last
year's Varsity, and also li. R. lilase,
'14. (I. A. .lacomini, '1.1. 11. 11. Duben
dorf, 'Hi. and .1. R. Mraden, 'Hi, who
madia v< ry creditable record.
In the backfield only three veterans,
Captain .1. H. Thoburn, '13, F. W.

Reeves, '11 and .J. C. Urban, 'Iti, will
Icon tlie team, Frban will probably
be back in his old position of right
wing. Of last year's substitutes A.
Erb, M.", will contest the position of
halfback with L. 1. Tilton. '14, of
Bakersfield, who was substitute half in
1911. R. R. Templeton, '1">, will make
a strong bid for wing three-quarters,
as will 1). It. Carroll. 'Hi. who played
center on the All-Australian Rugby
team. 11. W. Andrews. '14, will also
be among the aspirants for places in
lbe backfield. E. F. Kern, 'IM, stated
definitely last night that he will not
be back next semester, and L. Cass, '12,
has expressed his intention of working
in S:iu Francisco while commuting
from the campus. The position of
fullback is the most doubtful in the
backfield. R. Brown, '14, even if he
comes back to college, will hardly l:e
able to get in the game owing to a
weak neck, and the incoming class of
Freshmen, from which much is ex
pected, will probably furnish several
, strong men to succeed Erb.
The Blue and Gold will have an al
most complete veteran team, but Car
dinal strength lies in the host of star
übstitutes which have had almost
veteran experience. Captain Thoburn,
the versatile utility man, will un
doubtedly lead a strong team onto the
I gridiron in November.
