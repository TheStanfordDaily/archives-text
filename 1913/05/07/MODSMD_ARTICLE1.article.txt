# SENIOR CAST IS READY TO STAGE RICH COMEDY
## MANY GOOD TICKETS ARE STILL TO BE HAD Miss Emily Coleman, '13, and W.S. Wilson. '13, Play Leading Roles With Convincing Charm. 
### 
By starting rehearsals for "Seven
Sisters" at an early date, the cast of
the Senior play is practically able to
rest effort until the night of produc
tion on May 14.
The'comedy has been played through
its entire course at the last all day
rehearsals, and all trace of conscious
ness or forgetfulness has been
removed.

Four sets of scenery are being
built, and painted, and will be placed
for the performance in the next few
days. There is ample opportunity in
this year's play for a Stanford stage
management to keep up the standard
that has been set for excellent scenic
effects.
Miss Emily Coleman, '13, and W. S.
Wilson, '13, as Mici and Count Horkoy,
respectively, will play opposite each
other in a delightful romance whose
phases are original and surprising.
They have thrown a great deal of
talent and personal attraction into
their roles.


Miss Coleman and W. 8. Wilson.
