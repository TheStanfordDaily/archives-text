With this issue volume forty-two of
The Daily Palo Alto is brought to a

close. It is with no little
regret that the present edi
tor severs his connection

with the paper after four years of
work in various capacities on the staff.
The work that is done each day in our
little six by six office probably brings
the members of The Daily, Palo Alto
staff closer together than the partici
pants in any other field of stu
dent activity and it is here that many
of our strongest and happiest associa
tions have been made.
To attempt to thank each and every
member of the staff for the services
rendered this semester would be use
less. It has been a pleasure to have
worked with such a group of competent
and self-sacrificing men. They put

in several hours of hard work each day
and receive little or 110 credit, but such
is the life of the newspaper reporter.
The outsider does not comprehend the
rough side of the work and the mem
bers of the University do not and can
not conceive of the time and labor that
it takes to publish the daily paper.
We admit that our publication is far
from faultless but if we have been able
to give our readers a fair account of
the day's doings in and around the
campus we think we have served our
purpose. Our limited facilities prevent
many desired improvements but we
hope that the time is not far off when
some of them will be realized. It is our
fondest hope that at some time in the
not far distant future, the Student
Body will be able to own its printing
plant and there publish the various
student papers. Then and not until
then, will it be possible to increase the
size of The Daily Palo Alto.
Next semester the Daily will be in
charge of one of the most capable edi
tors who has ever been elected to the
office. In Earl C. Behrens the Student
Body will find a thorough newspaper
man and it is with the utmost confi
dence in his ability that we turn the
reins over to him.
