# UNION WILL BE BUILT THIS SUMMER
## 
### 
Satisfactory plans for the new Stan
ford Union have at last been drawn
up by Charles F. Whittlesey, and con
tracts for the building will be let im
mediately after the close of the sem
ester. Active construction will begin
on July 1, and the Union will be well
toward completion when college opens
in the fall. Charles F. Whittlesey, the
architect, recently designed an exten
sive system of stations for the Santa
Fe railroad, and his services have been
invaluable to the Stanford Union Com
mittee.
The general plan includes two club
houses, one for the men, the other for
the women, with a large quadrangle
between the two structures. These
buildings will occupy the block on
Lasuen street, between the postoffice
and the electrical engineering build
ings. Eventually an assembly hall,
suitable for mass meetings, dances,
and banquets, will be erected in the
rear of the court, but at present finan
cial obstacles stand in the way.
The clubhouses will each be three
stories in height. The ground floor in
each case will lie slightly sunk below
the level of the sidewalk outside. In
the men's club house, the bottom floor
>v-i 11 be devoted to a barber shop on the
north side, a smoking room in which
magazines and periodicals will be pro
vided, a large hall to be furnished with
pool and billiard tables, and offices in
front for the four college publications;

The Quad, The Daily Palo Alto, The
Sequoia, and the Chaparral.
The second floor will contain a large
assembly hall which can he used for
social gatherings and business meet
ings. The third floor will be divided
into two and three room suites to be
used by retiring alumni.
The women's building, which will
occupy the lot next to the postoffice,
I has not yet been planned as definitely
as the men's, but on the lower floor
I rest rooms and music rooms will oc
cupy most of the space. On the middle
floor an assembly room will probably
be placed, while bedrooms will be fur
j nished for the visiting alumni on the
I third floor.
The quadrangle will be two-thirds
the size of the Memorial Court, and
spacious arcades will enclose a central
area of gravelled walks and beds of
trees and flowers.
All of the buildings will be con
structed of reinforced concrete with
a handsome stone finish, and glisten
ing red-tiled roofs will furnish an at
tractive touch to the general Mission
style of architecture which will be
adopted throughout the entire plan.
The men's club will cost approxi
mately $35,000 when completed, and
the' women's will cost $25,000. Pro
visions are being made for constant
additions to the buildings, as soon
as the membership warrants the
expense.

magazines and periodicals will be pro
vided, a large hall to be furnished with
pool and billiard tables, and offices in
front for the four college publications;

The Quad, The Daily Palo Alto, The
Sequoia, and the Chaparral.
The second floor will contain a large
assembly hall which can he used for
social gatherings and business meet
ings. The third floor will be divided
into two and three room suites to be
used by retiring alumni.
The women's building, which will
occupy the lot next to the postoffice,
I has not yet been planned as definitely
as the men's, but on the lower floor
I rest rooms and music rooms will oc
cupy most of the space. On the middle
floor an assembly room will probably
be placed, while bedrooms will be fur
j nished for the visiting alumni on the
I third floor.
The quadrangle will be two-thirds
the size of the Memorial Court, and
spacious arcades will enclose a central
area of gravelled walks and beds of
trees and flowers.
All of the buildings will be con
structed of reinforced concrete with
a handsome stone finish, and glisten
ing red-tiled roofs will furnish an at
tractive touch to the general Mission
style of architecture which will be
adopted throughout the entire plan.
The men's club will cost approxi
mately $35,000 when completed, and
the' women's will cost $25,000. Pro
visions are being made for constant
additions to the buildings, as soon
as the membership warrants the
expense.
Satisfactory plans for the new Stan
ford Union have at last been drawn
up by Charles F. Whittlesey, and con
tracts for the building will be let im
mediately after the close of the sem
ester. Active construction will begin
on July 1, and the Union will be well
toward completion when college opens
in the fall. Charles F. Whittlesey, the
architect, recently designed an exten
sive system of stations for the Santa
Fe railroad, and his services have been
invaluable to the Stanford Union Com
mittee.
The general plan includes two club
houses, one for the men, the other for
the women, with a large quadrangle
between the two structures. These
buildings will occupy the block on
Lasuen street, between the postoffice
and the electrical engineering build
ings. Eventually an assembly hall,
suitable for mass meetings, dances,
and banquets, will be erected in the
rear of the court, but at present finan
cial obstacles stand in the way.
The clubhouses will each be three
stories in height. The ground floor in
each case will lie slightly sunk below
the level of the sidewalk outside. In
the men's club house, the bottom floor
>v-i 11 be devoted to a barber shop on the
north side, a smoking room in which
magazines and periodicals will be pro
vided, a large hall to be furnished with
pool and billiard tables, and offices in
front for the four college publications;

The Quad, The Daily Palo Alto, The
Sequoia, and the Chaparral.
