# STUDENTS CONFER HONOR UPON GRADUATE MANAGER
## DOC. BURBANK IS PRESENTED WITH GOLD WATCH Student Body Expresses Appreciation of His Four Years' Service as Financial Administrator. 
### 
As an appreciation of liis services to
the University as graduate manager
and as a token of the esteem in which
he is held hy the student body, the
Executive Committee has voted a
handsome gold watch to I). W. Bur
hank, '09, who is just, closing his
fourth term as graduate manager.
The watch is of the Swiss make, I'atek
Phillippe movement. On the inside
the following inscription has been
placed: "D. W. Burbank, from the
Associated Students of Leland Stan
ford Junior University, May, 1913. As
a token of esteem and in appreciation
of services rendered as graduate man
ager 1909-1913."

In making the gift the Executive
Committee voiced not only the senti
ment of the undergraduates, but also
of the alumni and the men without the
confines of the university who have
had dealings with Burbank during his
period as manager. The appreciation
is not only for the manner in which
he has conducted the affairs of his
office but also for his services to his
Alma Mater. Few graduates of Stan
ford have returned so much for the
benefits they secured during a resi
dence here as has the retiring official.
When Burbank took over the grad
uate manager's position he found the
Student Body finances in a bad shape.
The balance was all 011 the wrong side
of the ledger but under his far
sighted business policy and the meth
ods which he installed the Associated
Students now have a substantial sum
in reserve. Improvements without
number in and around the athletic
fields mutely testify to Burbank's
work.
Burbank has not limitted his work
to his office duties alone. In 1910 he
managed the tour of the Ail-American
Rugby fifteen to the Antipodes and has
been an active figure in the California
Rugby Union since its founding. He
has been elected to the treasurership
of that organization for next season.
The retiring graduate manager has
taken up the practice of law in San
Francisco.
