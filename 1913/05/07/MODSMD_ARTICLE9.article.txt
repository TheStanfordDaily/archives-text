# The
						Union
## 
### 
The Stanford Union is a reality,
introduced four years ago by H. C.

Hoover, 95, and intermit
tently agitated by the
Student Body since then,

the Union and the Women's clubhouse
will soon be realized. Work on the
buildings will be commenced in the
forepart of the summer and by the
opening of college in September will
be well on the way to completion. A
most needed acquisition, it looked for
a time as if it was but a far off
dream, but due to the efforts .of H. C.
Hoover, '95, E. W. Smith, '99, and F.
H. Fowler, '04, the vision has become
a tangible object. At present there is
not enough money to carry the build
ing on to completion but if the students
and almuni of Stanford University
possess that spirit for which they are
noted, —and we think they do, —work
will never have to stop because of a
lack of funds.
If you have pledged a sum, pay up.
Don't let it be said of you that work
had to stop because you failed to meet
your pledge. If you have not taken
out a life membership, do so. We need
the Union and the Union needs you.
