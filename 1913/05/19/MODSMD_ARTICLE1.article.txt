# SENIOR FARCE PLEASES LARGE AUDIENCE WITH ITS COMEDY
## "SEVEN SISTERS" PROVES GOOD VEHICLE FOR CAST MISS BAILEY AND MISS COLEMAN WIN LAURELS. 
### 
Another graduating class has paid
its dramatic tribute to Stanford and
Palo Alto theater goers. The Class of
1913 placed a high value on its an
nual debt to the public, and discharged
its payment with interest last Wed
nesday, in the production of the
comedy "Seven Sisters."
The humor of the farce was poured
out in a riotous flood through all
of the four acts, and it was seldom
abated, even in the few moments when
the stage was devoted to love making.
The fact that there was mischief afoot,
and that adorable little Mici and her
co-conspirator were enjoying all the
fun of it never got further from the
foot lights than the wings.
Although the rich comedy of the
farce justified almost continuous
laughter, part of the audience was in
clined to consider the whole play a
cause for mirth, and spoiled part of a
very pretty love scene between Mici
(Miss Coleman), and Horkoy (Mr.
Wilson).
There were just a few lines in the
comedy that seemed stilted. The
trouble lay mostly in repitition of
words that appeared to have no un
usual value. Such a defect may be at
tributed to the difficulty of an other
wise pleasing translation from the
Hungarian, with its different word
values.
As Mrs. Gyurkovics, the widow of an
army officer, and Spartan mother of
seven daughters, Miss Bailey achieved
the dramatic laurels of the play. The
success of the role of the exacting
mother depended more than that of
any other, on clever character acting.
The feat was accomplished with great
success by Miss Bailey. An excellent
presence, clear voice, and appreciation
of her part, allowed her to entertain
very successfully as the Junoesque
mother, who "had a method" in en
forcing military discipline on her
charges.
Miss Coleman carried the charms of
Mici, the fourth sister, with an added
charm of personality that made the
mischievous heroine a delightful crea
ture. Vividly and adoreably, Mici
played with her doll during her en
forced age of fourteen and a half, and
plotted to find husbands for her three
sisters, whose marriage would bring
her "emancipation" from youth and
short skirts. After she had grown up
to be eligible for marriage, her pres
ence was equally pleasing. Miss Cloe
man played with enthusiasm, and pre
sented a lively character.
W. S. Wilson, as Count Horkoy,
showed as much dash, daring, and
gallantry as the most gaily uniformed
young officer could display. His pres
ence on the stage was at all times a
signal for things to happen in lively
fashion, and the way in which he
played with chance and made love
was one of the bright qualities of the
comedy. A slight nasal quality of
voice was atoned for by clear enuncia
tion. In the boudoir scene of the third
act, and in his scene with Mici in the
fourth act, Wilson's easy grace of
speech and action were irrestible.
Among the other sisters, Miss Ober,

as Katiuka, carried her part with suc
cess. The simple charm of her acting
flagged once or twice early in the
play, but her last entrances were ve.'y
convincing.
Miss Beach, as Sari, and Miss
Stevick, as Ella, the sentimental sister
added agreably to the scenes.
As Gida and Sandorffy respectively,
C. M. Vrang and G. H. Beurhaus de
serve praise. Vrang, as Gida, present
ed the character of an aristocratic
dullard with distinction. During the
wedding feast in the last act, Beur
haus, as Sandorffy, made good use of
an effective bit of business to show
how thoroughly he had been "in his
cups."
F. Q. Wilson, as Baron Colonel Rad
viany, portrayed his role acceptably.
His acting was consistent and thor
ough, and he used a mediocre role in
good fashion.
Toni Telki, presented by C. R. Shaw
was laughable. The vagaries of the
part might have been exaggerated
more than they were.
Thoroughly bright and pleasant
were the pictures formed by the three
smaller sisters. They were Terka,
Liza, and Klara, played respectively
by Misses Gray and Stewart, and
little Miss Lautterstein.

sisters, whose marriage would bring
her "emancipation" from youth and
short skirts. After she had grown up
to be eligible for marriage, her pres
ence was equally pleasing. Miss Cloe
man played with enthusiasm, and pre
sented a lively character.
W. S. Wilson, as Count Horkoy,
showed as much dash, daring, and
gallantry as the most gaily uniformed
young officer could display. His pres
ence on the stage was at all times a
signal for things to happen in lively
fashion, and the way in which he
played with chance and made love
was one of the bright qualities of the
comedy. A slight nasal quality of
voice was atoned for by clear enuncia
tion. In the boudoir scene of the third
act, and in his scene with Mici in the
fourth act, Wilson's easy grace of
speech and action were irrestible.
Among the other sisters, Miss Ober,

as Katiuka, carried her part with suc
cess. The simple charm of her acting
flagged once or twice early in the
play, but her last entrances were ve.'y
convincing.
Miss Beach, as Sari, and Miss
Stevick, as Ella, the sentimental sister
added agreably to the scenes.
As Gida and Sandorffy respectively,
C. M. Vrang and G. H. Beurhaus de
serve praise. Vrang, as Gida, present
ed the character of an aristocratic
dullard with distinction. During the
wedding feast in the last act, Beur
haus, as Sandorffy, made good use of
an effective bit of business to show
how thoroughly he had been "in his
cups."
F. Q. Wilson, as Baron Colonel Rad
viany, portrayed his role acceptably.
His acting was consistent and thor
ough, and he used a mediocre role in
good fashion.
Toni Telki, presented by C. R. Shaw
was laughable. The vagaries of the
part might have been exaggerated
more than they were.
Thoroughly bright and pleasant
were the pictures formed by the three
smaller sisters. They were Terka,
Liza, and Klara, played respectively
by Misses Gray and Stewart, and
little Miss Lautterstein.
Another graduating class has paid
its dramatic tribute to Stanford and
Palo Alto theater goers. The Class of
1913 placed a high value on its an
nual debt to the public, and discharged
its payment with interest last Wed
nesday, in the production of the
comedy "Seven Sisters."
The humor of the farce was poured
out in a riotous flood through all
of the four acts, and it was seldom
abated, even in the few moments when
the stage was devoted to love making.
The fact that there was mischief afoot,
and that adorable little Mici and her
co-conspirator were enjoying all the
fun of it never got further from the
foot lights than the wings.
Although the rich comedy of the
farce justified almost continuous
laughter, part of the audience was in
clined to consider the whole play a
cause for mirth, and spoiled part of a
very pretty love scene between Mici
(Miss Coleman), and Horkoy (Mr.
Wilson).
There were just a few lines in the
comedy that seemed stilted. The
trouble lay mostly in repitition of
words that appeared to have no un
usual value. Such a defect may be at
tributed to the difficulty of an other
wise pleasing translation from the
Hungarian, with its different word
values.
As Mrs. Gyurkovics, the widow of an
army officer, and Spartan mother of
seven daughters, Miss Bailey achieved
the dramatic laurels of the play. The
success of the role of the exacting
mother depended more than that of
any other, on clever character acting.
The feat was accomplished with great
success by Miss Bailey. An excellent
presence, clear voice, and appreciation
of her part, allowed her to entertain
very successfully as the Junoesque
mother, who "had a method" in en
forcing military discipline on her
charges.
Miss Coleman carried the charms of
Mici, the fourth sister, with an added
charm of personality that made the
mischievous heroine a delightful crea
ture. Vividly and adoreably, Mici
played with her doll during her en
forced age of fourteen and a half, and
plotted to find husbands for her three
sisters, whose marriage would bring
her "emancipation" from youth and
short skirts. After she had grown up
to be eligible for marriage, her pres
ence was equally pleasing. Miss Cloe
man played with enthusiasm, and pre
