### 
Bubbling over-, with .the; .spirit of
Senior Week and festooned in gay
attire 1913 ushered in underclassmen
day on Thursday morning "with the
smile that won't Come off." It was a
big day from start to finish.
With the pleasant bows and greet
ings, signifying proprietorship and
plutocracy, the members of the com
mittee, and officers of the class rode
in front of the "parade." President I.
I. Ingrahafii and'Vide-Pi'e&ident Dodge
led the line of lltVats and automobiles
from the gates on Lasuen down the
Row, up Salvaterria 'arid back by
Alvarado, finally finishing on Univer
sity avenue in Palo Alto.
The Stanford band played through
out. the entire march for the first time
"since the annual Senior Week
"Pe-rade" was inaugurated two years
ago. The music announced that, the
procession was coming and as the
Varsity . "S" girls of the Senior class
came along, drawn by four brown
horses in a tally-ho, and also in three
automobiles, they strew tin? way with
streamers of varied lines, hurling
them at the crowds which lined both
sides of the Row.
The mojHt original and interesting
floaty was that of the Freshman class
advertising., their concession. "The
Cabaret" with the Terpsichorean
beauty as a drawing card. She (aliasi
he) danced to the music of a piano
while members of the class enjoyed
themselves at the tables of the cab
aret. "Duck the Coon," the Delta IJpsi
lon concession and a.take-oif on the
"Seven Sisters" with their mother
- I '
next came in line.
Last,- but by far the most humorous;
lloat was that of the prize fighters,!
Never before have heavy weights]
fought so .many rounds and With as
little satisfaction to either side as was:
that between "W.ee Willie" Batch and
"Slim" Chace. The "Pe-rade" con
cluded with a great number of auto- 1
inobiles following the fun unikey*s : .
King Carnival held forth in despotic
s.tatp lajst Thursday from- 8 o'clock
until midnight. During the .four hours
of riotous -mirth making, he held'
laughing throng of more than a thou
sand fun seekers in his power.. '.Carni
val spirit, confetti,, "funny paper-." and'

-laughter ..epnyulsed - the.. Row in a
! paraxysm of glee. Crowds of campus
, people and visitors streamed past, and
through' the concessions on lawns,
and in the houses. A thousand electric
| bulbs twinkled and glittered from
bright strings in the trees overhead.
"Barkers," and ticket sellers
i vaunted the excellence of their
j booths in stentorian tones during the
early hours, and ' continued to croak
their slogans bravely after their
voices had shrunk to a piping staCcafo.
Many people ill the crowd who had
dimes arid nickels to exchange in the
scramble for amusement, spent their
money in methodical " fashion by
visiting the booths and show's accord
ing to their geographical'location.
After taking a walk along the Row
to "size up" the extent and lavishness,
they usually stocked up with a gener
ous string of tickets 1 . u
The Delta Kappa' Epsilon Fresh
men attracted notice with their
ful Dodger" and several cases of eggs.!
Arrayed in shinning black smiles and
a white shirt front the dodger played
a lusty game of hide and seek.
A frontier dance lial'l and bar proved
|to be'a lucrative occupation in the
i Kappa Alpha house. Nickel dances,
1 soda water and "near beer*' were the
principle attractions. The name of,
the latter beverage sounded better than
the concoction tasted, but everyone
; was satisfied,' and the cash dra'werl
tilled rapidly.
The Senior class conducted a lively,

frolic.
Wheels of chance near the sidewalk
j were exploited by Delta Chi. The
premiums were candy and cigarettes.

Kappa Sigma houses, the Stanford
branch of the A. 1. E. E. showed an

At the Sigma r Chi house', a "Slide
for Life" t;n a cable was made several
times by H. H. Walcott, '14, to drum
up customers for the house conces
sion. The plan succeeded, and gave
many people- a chance to hear "The
Shooting ol Dan McGrew," alias
"Lady Lou," produced in talking
moving pictures.
In the Beta Theta Pi house "The
Lure of Gold," a pioneer feature was
run -.by the Geology and Mineral so

gaems of chance held the crowd.
The last concession 011 the circuit
was the "Freshman Cabaret" at the
Kappa Alpha Theta house. An at
tractive electric sign lured more than
a thousand people to the gaieties of
the cafe scene inside. Dances, songs
and dialogue combined to make the
"fun in a cafe" one of the features of
the carnival.
