# PRESIDENT JORDAN PROMOTED TO OFFICE OF CHANCELLOR
## Vice-President Branner To Assume Presidential Chair Announcement Unexpected. 
### 
By announcement made today at the
Commencement exercises President
David Starr Jordan assumes the posi
tion of Chancellor of the University,
while Doctor John Casper Branner,
head of the Geology and Mining De
partment, will assume the office of
President.
The announcement coming as it did
just before the paper went to press
could not be given the space and at
tention that it deserves. At the
heighth of his career Doctor Jordan
takes the position where lie can be of
the greatsefet service to Stanford and
can come into closer connections with
the undergraduates and the world a I
large. The active management of the
University affairs is entrusted to the
life-long friend of Doctor Jordan and
student favorite, John Casper Bran :
ner.
. . . .

The creation of this office has had
two purposes: "First, the division be
tween the offices of Chancellor and
President of the burden of administra
tive duties and responsibilities hither
to vested solely in the President, and
which fhe development of the modern
university has ' triade increasingly
laborious u and 'onerous. Second, in
high appreciation of the great service
President .lordait has rendered and is
rendering, not lherely to this univer
sity. bill to the world's work in the

cause of education, science, and civi
ligation, it is intended that tlie institu
tion ot this new office shall, by re
lievelng hini of riiuch of the routine of
executive work, enable him to devote
'his attention in increasing measure to
the greater problems within and with
out the University.
For 22 years' President Jordan has
been the inspiration of Stanford Uni
versity. What it is is due mainly to
his' "high" ideals, his breadth of out
look, and warmth of sympathy. Tlvefee
Tfualit'ies and abilities the University
need's fn the'future as in the past, and
tfiesti 'the office of Chancellor ensure
tis. *'Tritstees and Faculty, "Alumni
rtml''Students,' will continue to profit by
his wisdonr and his enthusiasm. But
it is also' recognized that the world
at large lias a clAim upon his abilities
which it' should be the mission of
Stanford hi further and to encourage.
ft is the belief that the division of
administrative tuJietions between two
such co-opferati'fe and sympatic
leaders as Chancellor Jordan' and
President' BranneSV, will promote the
efficiency, uSefnllnfe'ss, and influence
of tb'e University, and that, under their
guidance the aims and ideals of
at'arttorff UniVefsitv will be carried
