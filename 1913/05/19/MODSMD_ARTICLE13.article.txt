Mr. President, Classmates, and
Friends:

A little less than
four years ago,—
September 1, 1909,
to be exact, —there
arrived 011 the
S t an 112 ord Farm
some three hun
dred and fifty high
school graduates.
Gathered from each
quarter of the
globe, unknown to

each other, they came for the express
purpose of increasing their store of
knowledge. Today two hundred and
sixty of these same individuals, now
friends and comrades, leave the red
tiled roof of the Quad behind them to
seek for what the world has to offer.
What has transpired in these four
years is now a matter of history, and
as such it is my pleasure to chronicle
on this occasion, the last meeting of
the class of Nineteen Hundred and
Thirteen.
Each class that goes out of Stanford
thinks that its generation is the best,
and 1913 is no exception. It has been
our good fortune to have resided on
the Farm in what Dr. Jordan —than
whom there is 110 one better qualified
to judge—has termed "The Golden
Age of Stanford," and the class of
1913 has played no small part in bring
ing about this excellent state of affairs.
The men and women of 1913 have done
their duty, as members of the Univer
sity and the Student Body; and de
parting leave behind them many not
able achievements.
Two things of the greatest import
ance stand out as milestones in the
career of the class. Student Control
and the Stanford Union. The former
was evolved with the aid of Thirteen
men, and members of the 1913 class
carried it over the first and most try
ing stage. The life of this venture
naturally depended upon the results of
the first, year's trial. That the sys
tem has been an unqualified success
cannot be gainsaid and the Thirteen

men, Kern, Ingraham and Ambrose
who are members of the first Student
Council are three of those most de
serving of credit.
The Stanford Union was first con
ceived by that loyal alumnus, Her
bert C. Hoover, '95, and has been
largely financed by him. Its being de
pended upon procurring enough inter
est and capital in the Student Body.
The plan was fostered in February,
1910, while the members of this class
were still in their collegiate infancy.
13ut age counted for naught when it
came to showing the real Stanford
spirit. In that memorable assembly
011 February 25, the class of 1913, the
babes of the University, subscribed
$3,000 in less than one hour. This
sum exceeded that raised by the class
of 1910 and was only a little short of
the largest amount, which was con
tributed by 1911. Subscribing and
paying, however, are vastly different.
The Union funds increased but little
in the first year and a half and the
Union came to be considered a vague
dream. It remained for members of
this class to set the active campaign
in motion. As soon as we left our
underclassmen days and acquired the
"corduroy" privilege our influence
commenced to be felt and the Union
was one of the instances. Fete Am
brose started the boom. Chandler car
ried it 011, and Ingraham finished the
work so well started. And now as we
are about to leave the University we
can almost see the concrete realiza
tion of Hoover's plan. Time will tell
the great service that this building
will render. What the Houston Club
is to the University of Pennsylvania,
what the Reynolds Club is to the Uni
versity of Chicago or for a more
homely example what the Encina Club
room is to the men of the Hall, the
Stanford Union will be to the students
and alumni of Stanford.
The women have kept right along
side of the men in the matter of pro
gress. They have secured Self Gov
ernment and a Woman's clubhouse
which mean just as much to the wo
men as Student Control and the Stan
ford Union do to the men. Both have
been due largely to the efforts of mem

bers of this class. A successful sys
tem of self-government has been per
fected by Misses Hullis, Seeley, and
Wagner of the Women's Council and
Misses Hullis and Baker have been
active in securing funds for the club
house.
These two achievements mark great
epochs in Stanford history. Not since
the days of the pioneers when, we are
told, nothing was frequently made
into something over night, have there
been such important permanent ad
vances made in Student Body condi
tions. Student Control gives every as
surance of internal peace. The Union
should produce greater cohesion and
strength.
As a potent power in Student Body
activities, Nineteen Thirteen has been
second to none. From the day of the
underclass rush when time had to be
extended and sophomores released
from the morgue in order to save the
day for 1912, our strength has been
realized and each year has seen us
grow stronger. With but six days of
practice our freshman football team
held the sophomores to a tie in the
Interclass series and it required an
other twenty minutes for the exper
ienced sophs to cross our line. In
October, 1910, we scored the first vic
tory over the California babies in five
years and also won the distinction of
being the first and only Stanford class
to win an intercollegiate freshman
Rugby game. Stan Mitchell led the
team that day and was supported by
Fyfe, Ambrose, Bly, Frank, Baum
gartner, Duryea, Murlin, Lull, Belcher,
Worswick, Thoburn, Arrell, Cass,
Kern, and Ellis. In crew we upheld
the Cardinal reputation of never hav
ing lost a freshman regatta by
triumphing over the Blue and Gold
four in the one mile race. Beal, Dur
yea, Grepe and Olmstead pulled the
oars in this boat and were guided by
Larry Marx. That same day saw the
Stanford Varsity win the big race with
a freshman, Hofer, in the shell. In
track 19K5 was forced to succumb to
the overwhelming numbers of the Blue
and Gold on an oval that bore a strik
ing resemblance to the football field
last fall.
The second semester of our fresh
man year was the stormiest that has
been experienced since we have been
in college. It looker for a time as if
Intercollegiate relations would be
severed on account of the dispute over
the "Five Year Rule" and within the
University dissension was ram
pant. The Sequoia—Scaraboeia con
troversy divided the Student Body
and the quarrel became so warm that
violence was resorted to on one occa
sion. Being freshmen, Nineteen
Thirteen had to play the role of the
interested onlooker in these stirring
times, but the lessons we learned were
not forgotten and often stood us in
good stead when we assumed control
of affairs later.

It whs in the Sophomore year that.
Thirteen's star began to shine most
brilliantly. By that time we had be
come full-fledged Stanford men and
women and our true worth commenced
to tell. At the opening of the first
semester occurred that memorable
poster episcode when a horde of
Freshmen captured the Sophomore de
crees as they were being brought to
the campus in the wee small hours of
the morning. But even then Thirteen
could not be downed. A fast run
back to San Jose, the awakening of an
irate printer, and a record breaking
return to the campus with a fresh
edition spread gloom over the Fresh
men which was enhanced by the
wholesale tubbing and the rapid tie-up
in the afternoon. That year found
1913 first in interclass football, track,
crew, and tennis and we also captured
our first of a series of three Irish
marathons. The same season wit
nessed the passing of Menlo and pro
miscuous hazing from the Stanford
Hall of Fame.
The remaining years have been com
paratively peaceful, being taken up
with the customary plays, operas,
Plug-Uglies, Proms, cotillions and
Pe-rades. In each the class has dis
played skill and ingenuity and has left
a high standard for future genera
tions to follow.
1913 has had the pleasure of witness
ing two of the most successful ath
letic seasons ever recorded in Stan
lord annals. Our freshman year
brought victories in everything but
football, and this year, marked an
era of greater triumph, not a single
defeat did we suffer in a major sport.
The mean years were rather disas
trous, but the crew relieved our feel
ings somewhat. Our athletic suc
cesses have not been restricted to
California during the past four years.
We have won three Pacific Coast
championships, in baseball, track and
crew, sent an eight to the Pough
keepsie regatta, won the Middle West
Confrence once and we now have a
champion baseball team on the way
to Japan. Our one regret is that we
have failed to witness a Stanford foot
ball victory. Jupiter Pluvius robbed
us- of a sure chance and gave us a
mud-tie for consolation prize.
In each branch of sport 1913 men
have been in the lead. We have given
four captains of winning teams; Cass.
Campbell, Duryea and Murray. Be
sides them we have loaned Jimmie
I hoburn to 1914 in order to help de
teat ( alifornia in the fall, it being
found impossible to do without some
of us.
Ever since our first semester when
Stan Mitchell and Louis Cass dis
placed two Varsity football veterans,
I hirteen has been the dominant party
on the athletic teams. In football,
Thoburn, Kern, Baumgartner, Frank,
Mitchell and Cass have won the Var


II L. Loiml.
sity "S" and Kern was also a member
of the All-American team that invaded
Australia in 1910.,
In track there have been our prize
captain, Campbell, Dodge, Kern, Mor
rison, Murray, Argabrite, Brown,
Stevens, Horine, Price, Leaman and
Miller. Two world's records have
come to Stanford in this time, the
high jump and the pole vault. Un
fortunately Lee Scott's record no
longer stands, but the high jump
mark of six feet seven set by George
Horine, '13, will remain to remind our
posterity of the prowass of 1913's
athletea.
Mitchell, Cass, Argabrite, Beeger
and Childs formed as classy a lot of
ball tossers as every upheld the rep
utation of Stanford, while in crew,
Thirteen has been represented by
those husky warriors, Duryea, Heal,
Olmstead and Hofer. Never did these
men have to taste defeat in an in
tercollegiate boat race, but Dan
Cupid has since proved the master of
three.
Our tennis have been Murray,
Shaul, and Pratt; and for soccer we
have furnished Captains Pellas for
this year and Kiggins for next, be
sides a goodly number of players.
Nor have the accompishments of
1913 been confined solely to athletic
activities. As editors of The Daily
Palo Alto we have had Ingraham and
Loud. Miss Driscoll edited the Se
quoia and Duff has been loaned to
1014 in order to save the "lit."it not

being deemed safe to entrust it to less
experienced hands. Our funny men
have all been artistically bent and
hence we can claim no Chaparral
editor, but Duff and Manning are the
ones whose work we look for first
in the comic. In debating we have
had Smith, Leib, Simpson, Newell,
Bradford and Wood.
Originality has always marked
Thirteen's dramatic efforts. For four
years Wilson and Forbes have been
conducting the 1913 playwright bureau
for the benefit of the University. The
past three Junior operas have either
been written or revised by them, and
in addition they furnished skits in
numerable on demand. Misses Bullis,
Coleman, Ober, Beach, Parkinson,
Stevick, Emmons, Driscoll, Long, and
Messrs. Kern, Ingraham, Wilson,
Forbes, Mclnerney, Spence, Turpin,
Beurhaus, Brown and Manning form
a galaxj of dramatic talent from which
a cast to fit any play may be chosen.
For Student Body President we
have had Ambrose, and we contrib
ute Campbell to help guide the 1914
ship of state as vice-president. Not
since the 1909 class graduated has
there been a man capable of filling
Burbank's position and each year the
genial "Doc" has returned to be
graduate manager. It remained for
1913 to supply a satisfactory relief in
Wilcox who takes charge of the Stu
dent Body Finances in the fall.
In the scholarship list 1913 again
has an enviable position. Twenty
six have been elected to membership
in Phi Beta Kappa. They are Misses
Prekke, Newcomer, Driscoll, Judah,
Brooks, Crellin, Culp, Current, Gard
ner, Gower, Heckler, Kilpatrick, Libis,
Weaver, Withey, and Messrs. Fleming,
Smiley, Johnson, Green, Smith, Hatr
wig, Jenkins, Lawrence, Murray.
Swan, and Talbert.
This in brief is the story of the
life cf the class of 1913. Time for
bids me to take up many of the in
teresting details that have marked
the journey of the class. There are
events that stand out vividly in the
minds of each of us as individuals but
these must be overlooked in a gen
eral survey of our four year's life.
To attempt to pay for what we have
received at Stanford would be futile
but if our achievements have been
and will be of any benefit to the Uni
versity, then our efforts have not been
in vain. In our opinion the Stanford
of 1913 is better than the Stanford of
1909. May she continue to advance.

the Farm in what Dr. Jordan —than
whom there is 110 one better qualified
to judge—has termed "The Golden
Age of Stanford," and the class of
1913 has played no small part in bring
ing about this excellent state of affairs.
The men and women of 1913 have done
their duty, as members of the Univer
sity and the Student Body; and de
parting leave behind them many not
able achievements.
Two things of the greatest import
ance stand out as milestones in the
career of the class. Student Control
and the Stanford Union. The former
was evolved with the aid of Thirteen
men, and members of the 1913 class
carried it over the first and most try
ing stage. The life of this venture
naturally depended upon the results of
the first, year's trial. That the sys
tem has been an unqualified success
cannot be gainsaid and the Thirteen

men, Kern, Ingraham and Ambrose
who are members of the first Student
Council are three of those most de
serving of credit.
The Stanford Union was first con
ceived by that loyal alumnus, Her
bert C. Hoover, '95, and has been
largely financed by him. Its being de
pended upon procurring enough inter
est and capital in the Student Body.
The plan was fostered in February,
1910, while the members of this class
were still in their collegiate infancy.
13ut age counted for naught when it
came to showing the real Stanford
spirit. In that memorable assembly
011 February 25, the class of 1913, the
babes of the University, subscribed
$3,000 in less than one hour. This
sum exceeded that raised by the class
of 1910 and was only a little short of
the largest amount, which was con
tributed by 1911. Subscribing and
paying, however, are vastly different.
The Union funds increased but little
in the first year and a half and the
Union came to be considered a vague
dream. It remained for members of
this class to set the active campaign
in motion. As soon as we left our
underclassmen days and acquired the
"corduroy" privilege our influence
commenced to be felt and the Union
was one of the instances. Fete Am
brose started the boom. Chandler car
ried it 011, and Ingraham finished the
work so well started. And now as we
are about to leave the University we
can almost see the concrete realiza
tion of Hoover's plan. Time will tell
the great service that this building
will render. What the Houston Club
is to the University of Pennsylvania,
what the Reynolds Club is to the Uni
versity of Chicago or for a more
homely example what the Encina Club
room is to the men of the Hall, the
Stanford Union will be to the students
and alumni of Stanford.
The women have kept right along
side of the men in the matter of pro
gress. They have secured Self Gov
ernment and a Woman's clubhouse
which mean just as much to the wo
men as Student Control and the Stan
ford Union do to the men. Both have
been due largely to the efforts of mem

bers of this class. A successful sys
tem of self-government has been per
fected by Misses Hullis, Seeley, and
Wagner of the Women's Council and
Misses Hullis and Baker have been
active in securing funds for the club
house.
These two achievements mark great
epochs in Stanford history. Not since
the days of the pioneers when, we are
told, nothing was frequently made
into something over night, have there
been such important permanent ad
vances made in Student Body condi
tions. Student Control gives every as
surance of internal peace. The Union
should produce greater cohesion and
strength.
As a potent power in Student Body
activities, Nineteen Thirteen has been
second to none. From the day of the
underclass rush when time had to be
extended and sophomores released
from the morgue in order to save the
day for 1912, our strength has been
realized and each year has seen us
grow stronger. With but six days of
practice our freshman football team
held the sophomores to a tie in the
Interclass series and it required an
other twenty minutes for the exper
ienced sophs to cross our line. In
October, 1910, we scored the first vic
tory over the California babies in five
years and also won the distinction of
being the first and only Stanford class
to win an intercollegiate freshman
Rugby game. Stan Mitchell led the
team that day and was supported by
Fyfe, Ambrose, Bly, Frank, Baum
gartner, Duryea, Murlin, Lull, Belcher,
Worswick, Thoburn, Arrell, Cass,
Kern, and Ellis. In crew we upheld
the Cardinal reputation of never hav
ing lost a freshman regatta by
triumphing over the Blue and Gold
four in the one mile race. Beal, Dur
yea, Grepe and Olmstead pulled the
oars in this boat and were guided by
Larry Marx. That same day saw the
Stanford Varsity win the big race with
a freshman, Hofer, in the shell. In
track 19K5 was forced to succumb to
the overwhelming numbers of the Blue
and Gold on an oval that bore a strik
ing resemblance to the football field
last fall.
The second semester of our fresh
man year was the stormiest that has
been experienced since we have been
in college. It looker for a time as if
Intercollegiate relations would be
severed on account of the dispute over
the "Five Year Rule" and within the
University dissension was ram
pant. The Sequoia—Scaraboeia con
troversy divided the Student Body
and the quarrel became so warm that
violence was resorted to on one occa
sion. Being freshmen, Nineteen
Thirteen had to play the role of the
interested onlooker in these stirring
times, but the lessons we learned were
not forgotten and often stood us in
good stead when we assumed control
of affairs later.

It whs in the Sophomore year that.
Thirteen's star began to shine most
brilliantly. By that time we had be
come full-fledged Stanford men and
women and our true worth commenced
to tell. At the opening of the first
semester occurred that memorable
poster episcode when a horde of
Freshmen captured the Sophomore de
crees as they were being brought to
the campus in the wee small hours of
the morning. But even then Thirteen
could not be downed. A fast run
back to San Jose, the awakening of an
irate printer, and a record breaking
return to the campus with a fresh
edition spread gloom over the Fresh
men which was enhanced by the
wholesale tubbing and the rapid tie-up
in the afternoon. That year found
1913 first in interclass football, track,
crew, and tennis and we also captured
our first of a series of three Irish
marathons. The same season wit
nessed the passing of Menlo and pro
miscuous hazing from the Stanford
Hall of Fame.
The remaining years have been com
paratively peaceful, being taken up
with the customary plays, operas,
Plug-Uglies, Proms, cotillions and
Pe-rades. In each the class has dis
played skill and ingenuity and has left
a high standard for future genera
tions to follow.
1913 has had the pleasure of witness
ing two of the most successful ath
letic seasons ever recorded in Stan
lord annals. Our freshman year
brought victories in everything but
football, and this year, marked an
era of greater triumph, not a single
defeat did we suffer in a major sport.
The mean years were rather disas
trous, but the crew relieved our feel
ings somewhat. Our athletic suc
cesses have not been restricted to
California during the past four years.
We have won three Pacific Coast
championships, in baseball, track and
crew, sent an eight to the Pough
keepsie regatta, won the Middle West
Confrence once and we now have a
champion baseball team on the way
to Japan. Our one regret is that we
have failed to witness a Stanford foot
ball victory. Jupiter Pluvius robbed
us- of a sure chance and gave us a
mud-tie for consolation prize.
In each branch of sport 1913 men
have been in the lead. We have given
four captains of winning teams; Cass.
Campbell, Duryea and Murray. Be
sides them we have loaned Jimmie
I hoburn to 1914 in order to help de
teat ( alifornia in the fall, it being
found impossible to do without some
of us.
Ever since our first semester when
Stan Mitchell and Louis Cass dis
placed two Varsity football veterans,
I hirteen has been the dominant party
on the athletic teams. In football,
Thoburn, Kern, Baumgartner, Frank,
Mitchell and Cass have won the Var


II L. Loiml.
sity "S" and Kern was also a member
of the All-American team that invaded
Australia in 1910.,
In track there have been our prize
captain, Campbell, Dodge, Kern, Mor
rison, Murray, Argabrite, Brown,
Stevens, Horine, Price, Leaman and
Miller. Two world's records have
come to Stanford in this time, the
high jump and the pole vault. Un
fortunately Lee Scott's record no
longer stands, but the high jump
mark of six feet seven set by George
Horine, '13, will remain to remind our
posterity of the prowass of 1913's
athletea.
Mitchell, Cass, Argabrite, Beeger
and Childs formed as classy a lot of
ball tossers as every upheld the rep
utation of Stanford, while in crew,
Thirteen has been represented by
those husky warriors, Duryea, Heal,
Olmstead and Hofer. Never did these
men have to taste defeat in an in
tercollegiate boat race, but Dan
Cupid has since proved the master of
three.
Our tennis have been Murray,
Shaul, and Pratt; and for soccer we
have furnished Captains Pellas for
this year and Kiggins for next, be
sides a goodly number of players.
Nor have the accompishments of
1913 been confined solely to athletic
activities. As editors of The Daily
Palo Alto we have had Ingraham and
Loud. Miss Driscoll edited the Se
quoia and Duff has been loaned to
1014 in order to save the "lit."it not

being deemed safe to entrust it to less
experienced hands. Our funny men
have all been artistically bent and
hence we can claim no Chaparral
editor, but Duff and Manning are the
ones whose work we look for first
in the comic. In debating we have
had Smith, Leib, Simpson, Newell,
Bradford and Wood.
Originality has always marked
Thirteen's dramatic efforts. For four
years Wilson and Forbes have been
conducting the 1913 playwright bureau
for the benefit of the University. The
past three Junior operas have either
been written or revised by them, and
in addition they furnished skits in
numerable on demand. Misses Bullis,
Coleman, Ober, Beach, Parkinson,
Stevick, Emmons, Driscoll, Long, and
Messrs. Kern, Ingraham, Wilson,
Forbes, Mclnerney, Spence, Turpin,
Beurhaus, Brown and Manning form
a galaxj of dramatic talent from which
a cast to fit any play may be chosen.
For Student Body President we
have had Ambrose, and we contrib
ute Campbell to help guide the 1914
ship of state as vice-president. Not
since the 1909 class graduated has
there been a man capable of filling
Burbank's position and each year the
genial "Doc" has returned to be
graduate manager. It remained for
1913 to supply a satisfactory relief in
Wilcox who takes charge of the Stu
dent Body Finances in the fall.
In the scholarship list 1913 again
has an enviable position. Twenty
six have been elected to membership
in Phi Beta Kappa. They are Misses
Prekke, Newcomer, Driscoll, Judah,
Brooks, Crellin, Culp, Current, Gard
ner, Gower, Heckler, Kilpatrick, Libis,
Weaver, Withey, and Messrs. Fleming,
Smiley, Johnson, Green, Smith, Hatr
wig, Jenkins, Lawrence, Murray.
Swan, and Talbert.
This in brief is the story of the
life cf the class of 1913. Time for
bids me to take up many of the in
teresting details that have marked
the journey of the class. There are
events that stand out vividly in the
minds of each of us as individuals but
these must be overlooked in a gen
eral survey of our four year's life.
To attempt to pay for what we have
received at Stanford would be futile
but if our achievements have been
and will be of any benefit to the Uni
versity, then our efforts have not been
in vain. In our opinion the Stanford
of 1913 is better than the Stanford of
1909. May she continue to advance.
With the reading of the ("hiss History, tlie Last Will and Testa

Mr. President, Classmates, and
Friends:

A little less than
four years ago,—
September 1, 1909,
to be exact, —there
arrived 011 the
S t an 112 ord Farm
some three hun
dred and fifty high
school graduates.
Gathered from each
quarter of the
globe, unknown to

each other, they came for the express
purpose of increasing their store of
knowledge. Today two hundred and
sixty of these same individuals, now
friends and comrades, leave the red
tiled roof of the Quad behind them to
seek for what the world has to offer.
What has transpired in these four
years is now a matter of history, and
as such it is my pleasure to chronicle
on this occasion, the last meeting of
the class of Nineteen Hundred and
Thirteen.
Each class that goes out of Stanford
thinks that its generation is the best,
and 1913 is no exception. It has been
our good fortune to have resided on
the Farm in what Dr. Jordan —than
whom there is 110 one better qualified
to judge—has termed "The Golden
Age of Stanford," and the class of
1913 has played no small part in bring
ing about this excellent state of affairs.
The men and women of 1913 have done
their duty, as members of the Univer
sity and the Student Body; and de
parting leave behind them many not
able achievements.
Two things of the greatest import
ance stand out as milestones in the
career of the class. Student Control
and the Stanford Union. The former
was evolved with the aid of Thirteen
men, and members of the 1913 class
carried it over the first and most try

this class to set the active campaign
in motion. As soon as we left our
underclassmen days and acquired the
"corduroy" privilege our influence
commenced to be felt and the Union
was one of the instances. Fete Am
brose started the boom. Chandler car
ried it 011, and Ingraham finished the
work so well started. And now as we
are about to leave the University we
can almost see the concrete realiza
tion of Hoover's plan. Time will tell
the great service that this building
will render. What the Houston Club
is to the University of Pennsylvania,
what the Reynolds Club is to the Uni
versity of Chicago or for a more
homely example what the Encina Club
room is to the men of the Hall, the
Stanford Union will be to the students
and alumni of Stanford.
The women have kept right along
side of the men in the matter of pro
gress. They have secured Self Gov
ernment and a Woman's clubhouse
which mean just as much to the wo
men as Student Control and the Stan
ford Union do to the men. Both have
been due largely to the efforts of mem

bers of this class. A successful sys
tem of self-government has been per
fected by Misses Hullis, Seeley, and
Wagner of the Women's Council and
Misses Hullis and Baker have been
active in securing funds for the club
house.
These two achievements mark great
epochs in Stanford history. Not since
the days of the pioneers when, we are
told, nothing was frequently made
into something over night, have there
been such important permanent ad
vances made in Student Body condi
tions. Student Control gives every as
surance of internal peace. The Union
should produce greater cohesion and
strength.
As a potent power in Student Body
activities, Nineteen Thirteen has been
second to none. From the day of the
underclass rush when time had to be
extended and sophomores released
from the morgue in order to save the
day for 1912, our strength has been
realized and each year has seen us
grow stronger. With but six days of
practice our freshman football team
held the sophomores to a tie in the
Interclass series and it required an
other twenty minutes for the exper
ienced sophs to cross our line. In
October, 1910, we scored the first vic
tory over the California babies in five
years and also won the distinction of
being the first and only Stanford class
to win an intercollegiate freshman
Rugby game. Stan Mitchell led the
team that day and was supported by
Fyfe, Ambrose, Bly, Frank, Baum
gartner, Duryea, Murlin, Lull, Belcher,
Worswick, Thoburn, Arrell, Cass,
Kern, and Ellis. In crew we upheld
the Cardinal reputation of never hav
ing lost a freshman regatta by
triumphing over the Blue and Gold
four in the one mile race. Beal, Dur
yea, Grepe and Olmstead pulled the
oars in this boat and were guided by
Larry Marx. That same day saw the
Stanford Varsity win the big race with
a freshman, Hofer, in the shell. In
track 19K5 was forced to succumb to
the overwhelming numbers of the Blue
and Gold on an oval that bore a strik
ing resemblance to the football field
last fall.
The second semester of our fresh
man year was the stormiest that has
been experienced since we have been
in college. It looker for a time as if
Intercollegiate relations would be
severed on account of the dispute over
the "Five Year Rule" and within the
University dissension was ram
pant. The Sequoia—Scaraboeia con
troversy divided the Student Body
and the quarrel became so warm that
violence was resorted to on one occa
sion. Being freshmen, Nineteen
Thirteen had to play the role of the
interested onlooker in these stirring
times, but the lessons we learned were
not forgotten and often stood us in
good stead when we assumed control
of affairs later.

It whs in the Sophomore year that.
Thirteen's star began to shine most
brilliantly. By that time we had be
come full-fledged Stanford men and
women and our true worth commenced
to tell. At the opening of the first
semester occurred that memorable
poster episcode when a horde of
Freshmen captured the Sophomore de
crees as they were being brought to
the campus in the wee small hours of
the morning. But even then Thirteen
could not be downed. A fast run
back to San Jose, the awakening of an
irate printer, and a record breaking
return to the campus with a fresh
edition spread gloom over the Fresh
men which was enhanced by the
wholesale tubbing and the rapid tie-up
in the afternoon. That year found
1913 first in interclass football, track,
crew, and tennis and we also captured
our first of a series of three Irish
marathons. The same season wit
nessed the passing of Menlo and pro
miscuous hazing from the Stanford
Hall of Fame.
The remaining years have been com
paratively peaceful, being taken up
with the customary plays, operas,
Plug-Uglies, Proms, cotillions and
Pe-rades. In each the class has dis
played skill and ingenuity and has left
a high standard for future genera
tions to follow.
1913 has had the pleasure of witness
ing two of the most successful ath
letic seasons ever recorded in Stan
lord annals. Our freshman year
brought victories in everything but
football, and this year, marked an
era of greater triumph, not a single
defeat did we suffer in a major sport.
The mean years were rather disas
trous, but the crew relieved our feel
ings somewhat. Our athletic suc
cesses have not been restricted to
California during the past four years.
We have won three Pacific Coast
championships, in baseball, track and
crew, sent an eight to the Pough
keepsie regatta, won the Middle West
Confrence once and we now have a
champion baseball team on the way
to Japan. Our one regret is that we
have failed to witness a Stanford foot
ball victory. Jupiter Pluvius robbed
us- of a sure chance and gave us a
mud-tie for consolation prize.
In each branch of sport 1913 men
have been in the lead. We have given
four captains of winning teams; Cass.
Campbell, Duryea and Murray. Be
sides them we have loaned Jimmie
I hoburn to 1914 in order to help de
teat ( alifornia in the fall, it being
found impossible to do without some
of us.
Ever since our first semester when
Stan Mitchell and Louis Cass dis
placed two Varsity football veterans,
I hirteen has been the dominant party
on the athletic teams. In football,
Thoburn, Kern, Baumgartner, Frank,
Mitchell and Cass have won the Var


II L. Loiml.
sity "S" and Kern was also a member
of the All-American team that invaded
Australia in 1910.,
In track there have been our prize
captain, Campbell, Dodge, Kern, Mor
rison, Murray, Argabrite, Brown,
Stevens, Horine, Price, Leaman and
Miller. Two world's records have
come to Stanford in this time, the
high jump and the pole vault. Un
fortunately Lee Scott's record no
longer stands, but the high jump
mark of six feet seven set by George
Horine, '13, will remain to remind our
posterity of the prowass of 1913's
athletea.
Mitchell, Cass, Argabrite, Beeger
and Childs formed as classy a lot of
ball tossers as every upheld the rep
utation of Stanford, while in crew,
Thirteen has been represented by
those husky warriors, Duryea, Heal,
Olmstead and Hofer. Never did these
men have to taste defeat in an in
tercollegiate boat race, but Dan
Cupid has since proved the master of
three.
Our tennis have been Murray,
Shaul, and Pratt; and for soccer we
have furnished Captains Pellas for
this year and Kiggins for next, be
sides a goodly number of players.
Nor have the accompishments of
1913 been confined solely to athletic
activities. As editors of The Daily
Palo Alto we have had Ingraham and
Loud. Miss Driscoll edited the Se
quoia and Duff has been loaned to
1014 in order to save the "lit."it not

being deemed safe to entrust it to less
experienced hands. Our funny men
have all been artistically bent and
hence we can claim no Chaparral
editor, but Duff and Manning are the
ones whose work we look for first
in the comic. In debating we have
had Smith, Leib, Simpson, Newell,
Bradford and Wood.
Originality has always marked
Thirteen's dramatic efforts. For four
years Wilson and Forbes have been
conducting the 1913 playwright bureau
for the benefit of the University. The
past three Junior operas have either
been written or revised by them, and
in addition they furnished skits in
numerable on demand. Misses Bullis,
Coleman, Ober, Beach, Parkinson,
Stevick, Emmons, Driscoll, Long, and
Messrs. Kern, Ingraham, Wilson,
Forbes, Mclnerney, Spence, Turpin,
Beurhaus, Brown and Manning form
a galaxj of dramatic talent from which
a cast to fit any play may be chosen.
For Student Body President we
have had Ambrose, and we contrib
ute Campbell to help guide the 1914
ship of state as vice-president. Not
since the 1909 class graduated has
there been a man capable of filling
Burbank's position and each year the
genial "Doc" has returned to be
graduate manager. It remained for
1913 to supply a satisfactory relief in
Wilcox who takes charge of the Stu
dent Body Finances in the fall.
In the scholarship list 1913 again
has an enviable position. Twenty
six have been elected to membership
in Phi Beta Kappa. They are Misses
Prekke, Newcomer, Driscoll, Judah,
Brooks, Crellin, Culp, Current, Gard
ner, Gower, Heckler, Kilpatrick, Libis,
Weaver, Withey, and Messrs. Fleming,
Smiley, Johnson, Green, Smith, Hatr
wig, Jenkins, Lawrence, Murray.
Swan, and Talbert.
This in brief is the story of the
life cf the class of 1913. Time for
bids me to take up many of the in
teresting details that have marked
the journey of the class. There are
events that stand out vividly in the
minds of each of us as individuals but
these must be overlooked in a gen
eral survey of our four year's life.
To attempt to pay for what we have
received at Stanford would be futile
but if our achievements have been
and will be of any benefit to the Uni
versity, then our efforts have not been
in vain. In our opinion the Stanford
of 1913 is better than the Stanford of
1909. May she continue to advance.
With the reading of the ("hiss History, tlie Last Will and Testa

Mr. President, Classmates, and
Friends:

A little less than
four years ago,—
September 1, 1909,
to be exact, —there
arrived 011 the
S t an 112 ord Farm
some three hun
dred and fifty high
school graduates.
Gathered from each
quarter of the
globe, unknown to

each other, they came for the express
purpose of increasing their store of
knowledge. Today two hundred and
sixty of these same individuals, now
friends and comrades, leave the red
tiled roof of the Quad behind them to
seek for what the world has to offer.
What has transpired in these four
years is now a matter of history, and
as such it is my pleasure to chronicle
on this occasion, the last meeting of
the class of Nineteen Hundred and
Thirteen.
Each class that goes out of Stanford
thinks that its generation is the best,
and 1913 is no exception. It has been
our good fortune to have resided on
the Farm in what Dr. Jordan —than
whom there is 110 one better qualified
to judge—has termed "The Golden
Age of Stanford," and the class of
1913 has played no small part in bring
ing about this excellent state of affairs.
The men and women of 1913 have done
their duty, as members of the Univer
sity and the Student Body; and de
parting leave behind them many not
able achievements.
Two things of the greatest import
ance stand out as milestones in the
career of the class. Student Control
and the Stanford Union. The former
was evolved with the aid of Thirteen
men, and members of the 1913 class
carried it over the first and most try
ing stage. The life of this venture
naturally depended upon the results of
the first, year's trial. That the sys
tem has been an unqualified success
cannot be gainsaid and the Thirteen

men, Kern, Ingraham and Ambrose
who are members of the first Student
Council are three of those most de
serving of credit.
The Stanford Union was first con
ceived by that loyal alumnus, Her
bert C. Hoover, '95, and has been
largely financed by him. Its being de
pended upon procurring enough inter
est and capital in the Student Body.
The plan was fostered in February,
1910, while the members of this class
were still in their collegiate infancy.
13ut age counted for naught when it
came to showing the real Stanford
spirit. In that memorable assembly
011 February 25, the class of 1913, the
babes of the University, subscribed
$3,000 in less than one hour. This
sum exceeded that raised by the class
of 1910 and was only a little short of
the largest amount, which was con
tributed by 1911. Subscribing and
paying, however, are vastly different.
The Union funds increased but little
in the first year and a half and the
Union came to be considered a vague
dream. It remained for members of
this class to set the active campaign
in motion. As soon as we left our
underclassmen days and acquired the
"corduroy" privilege our influence
commenced to be felt and the Union
was one of the instances. Fete Am
brose started the boom. Chandler car
ried it 011, and Ingraham finished the
work so well started. And now as we
are about to leave the University we
can almost see the concrete realiza
tion of Hoover's plan. Time will tell
the great service that this building
will render. What the Houston Club
is to the University of Pennsylvania,
what the Reynolds Club is to the Uni
versity of Chicago or for a more
homely example what the Encina Club
room is to the men of the Hall, the
Stanford Union will be to the students
and alumni of Stanford.
The women have kept right along
side of the men in the matter of pro
gress. They have secured Self Gov
ernment and a Woman's clubhouse
which mean just as much to the wo

ford Union do to the men. Both have

practice our freshman football team
held the sophomores to a tie in the
Interclass series and it required an
other twenty minutes for the exper
ienced sophs to cross our line. In
October, 1910, we scored the first vic
tory over the California babies in five
years and also won the distinction of
being the first and only Stanford class
to win an intercollegiate freshman
Rugby game. Stan Mitchell led the
team that day and was supported by
Fyfe, Ambrose, Bly, Frank, Baum
gartner, Duryea, Murlin, Lull, Belcher,
Worswick, Thoburn, Arrell, Cass,
Kern, and Ellis. In crew we upheld
the Cardinal reputation of never hav
ing lost a freshman regatta by
triumphing over the Blue and Gold
four in the one mile race. Beal, Dur
yea, Grepe and Olmstead pulled the
oars in this boat and were guided by
Larry Marx. That same day saw the
Stanford Varsity win the big race with
a freshman, Hofer, in the shell. In
track 19K5 was forced to succumb to
the overwhelming numbers of the Blue
and Gold on an oval that bore a strik
ing resemblance to the football field
last fall.
The second semester of our fresh
man year was the stormiest that has
been experienced since we have been
in college. It looker for a time as if
Intercollegiate relations would be
severed on account of the dispute over
the "Five Year Rule" and within the
University dissension was ram
pant. The Sequoia—Scaraboeia con
troversy divided the Student Body
and the quarrel became so warm that
violence was resorted to on one occa
sion. Being freshmen, Nineteen
Thirteen had to play the role of the
interested onlooker in these stirring
times, but the lessons we learned were
not forgotten and often stood us in
good stead when we assumed control
of affairs later.

It whs in the Sophomore year that.
Thirteen's star began to shine most
brilliantly. By that time we had be
come full-fledged Stanford men and
women and our true worth commenced
to tell. At the opening of the first
semester occurred that memorable
poster episcode when a horde of
Freshmen captured the Sophomore de
crees as they were being brought to
the campus in the wee small hours of
the morning. But even then Thirteen
could not be downed. A fast run
back to San Jose, the awakening of an
irate printer, and a record breaking
return to the campus with a fresh
edition spread gloom over the Fresh
men which was enhanced by the
wholesale tubbing and the rapid tie-up
in the afternoon. That year found
1913 first in interclass football, track,
crew, and tennis and we also captured
our first of a series of three Irish
marathons. The same season wit
nessed the passing of Menlo and pro
miscuous hazing from the Stanford
Hall of Fame.
The remaining years have been com
paratively peaceful, being taken up
with the customary plays, operas,
Plug-Uglies, Proms, cotillions and
Pe-rades. In each the class has dis
played skill and ingenuity and has left
a high standard for future genera
tions to follow.
1913 has had the pleasure of witness
ing two of the most successful ath
letic seasons ever recorded in Stan
lord annals. Our freshman year
brought victories in everything but
football, and this year, marked an
era of greater triumph, not a single
defeat did we suffer in a major sport.
The mean years were rather disas
trous, but the crew relieved our feel
ings somewhat. Our athletic suc
cesses have not been restricted to
California during the past four years.
We have won three Pacific Coast
championships, in baseball, track and
crew, sent an eight to the Pough
keepsie regatta, won the Middle West
Confrence once and we now have a
champion baseball team on the way
to Japan. Our one regret is that we
have failed to witness a Stanford foot
ball victory. Jupiter Pluvius robbed
us- of a sure chance and gave us a
mud-tie for consolation prize.
In each branch of sport 1913 men
have been in the lead. We have given
four captains of winning teams; Cass.
Campbell, Duryea and Murray. Be
sides them we have loaned Jimmie
I hoburn to 1914 in order to help de
teat ( alifornia in the fall, it being
found impossible to do without some
of us.
Ever since our first semester when
Stan Mitchell and Louis Cass dis
placed two Varsity football veterans,
I hirteen has been the dominant party
on the athletic teams. In football,
Thoburn, Kern, Baumgartner, Frank,
Mitchell and Cass have won the Var


II L. Loiml.
sity "S" and Kern was also a member
of the All-American team that invaded
Australia in 1910.,
In track there have been our prize
captain, Campbell, Dodge, Kern, Mor
rison, Murray, Argabrite, Brown,
Stevens, Horine, Price, Leaman and
Miller. Two world's records have
come to Stanford in this time, the
high jump and the pole vault. Un
fortunately Lee Scott's record no
longer stands, but the high jump
mark of six feet seven set by George
Horine, '13, will remain to remind our
posterity of the prowass of 1913's
athletea.
Mitchell, Cass, Argabrite, Beeger
and Childs formed as classy a lot of
ball tossers as every upheld the rep
utation of Stanford, while in crew,
Thirteen has been represented by
those husky warriors, Duryea, Heal,
Olmstead and Hofer. Never did these
men have to taste defeat in an in
tercollegiate boat race, but Dan
Cupid has since proved the master of
three.
Our tennis have been Murray,
Shaul, and Pratt; and for soccer we
have furnished Captains Pellas for
this year and Kiggins for next, be
sides a goodly number of players.
Nor have the accompishments of
1913 been confined solely to athletic
activities. As editors of The Daily
Palo Alto we have had Ingraham and
Loud. Miss Driscoll edited the Se
quoia and Duff has been loaned to
1014 in order to save the "lit."it not

being deemed safe to entrust it to less
experienced hands. Our funny men
have all been artistically bent and
hence we can claim no Chaparral
editor, but Duff and Manning are the
ones whose work we look for first
in the comic. In debating we have
had Smith, Leib, Simpson, Newell,
Bradford and Wood.
Originality has always marked
Thirteen's dramatic efforts. For four
years Wilson and Forbes have been
conducting the 1913 playwright bureau
for the benefit of the University. The
past three Junior operas have either
been written or revised by them, and
in addition they furnished skits in
numerable on demand. Misses Bullis,
Coleman, Ober, Beach, Parkinson,
Stevick, Emmons, Driscoll, Long, and
Messrs. Kern, Ingraham, Wilson,
Forbes, Mclnerney, Spence, Turpin,
Beurhaus, Brown and Manning form
a galaxj of dramatic talent from which
a cast to fit any play may be chosen.
For Student Body President we
have had Ambrose, and we contrib
ute Campbell to help guide the 1914
ship of state as vice-president. Not
since the 1909 class graduated has
there been a man capable of filling
Burbank's position and each year the
genial "Doc" has returned to be
graduate manager. It remained for
1913 to supply a satisfactory relief in
Wilcox who takes charge of the Stu
dent Body Finances in the fall.
In the scholarship list 1913 again
has an enviable position. Twenty
six have been elected to membership
in Phi Beta Kappa. They are Misses
Prekke, Newcomer, Driscoll, Judah,
Brooks, Crellin, Culp, Current, Gard
ner, Gower, Heckler, Kilpatrick, Libis,
Weaver, Withey, and Messrs. Fleming,
Smiley, Johnson, Green, Smith, Hatr
wig, Jenkins, Lawrence, Murray.
Swan, and Talbert.
This in brief is the story of the
life cf the class of 1913. Time for
bids me to take up many of the in
teresting details that have marked
the journey of the class. There are
events that stand out vividly in the
minds of each of us as individuals but
these must be overlooked in a gen
eral survey of our four year's life.
To attempt to pay for what we have
received at Stanford would be futile
but if our achievements have been
and will be of any benefit to the Uni
versity, then our efforts have not been
in vain. In our opinion the Stanford
of 1913 is better than the Stanford of
1909. May she continue to advance.
With the reading of the ("hiss History, tlie Last Will and Testa

President I. I. Ingraliam addressed tiro members of the graduat

during their residence at Stanford. 11. L. Loud read the record and
achievements of the class. The Will was presented by ,1. L. Duff who
legally made bequests to those who are to guide the destinies of
student activity next year.
The row of class plates in front of the Memorial Church received
its yearly addition when E. C. Smith dedicated the eighteenth tablet

Mr. President, Classmates, and
Friends:

A little less than
four years ago,—
September 1, 1909,
to be exact, —there
arrived 011 the
S t an 112 ord Farm
some three hun
dred and fifty high
school graduates.
Gathered from each
quarter of the
globe, unknown to

each other, they came for the express
purpose of increasing their store of
knowledge. Today two hundred and
sixty of these same individuals, now
friends and comrades, leave the red
tiled roof of the Quad behind them to
seek for what the world has to offer.
What has transpired in these four
years is now a matter of history, and
as such it is my pleasure to chronicle
on this occasion, the last meeting of
the class of Nineteen Hundred and
Thirteen.
Each class that goes out of Stanford
thinks that its generation is the best,
and 1913 is no exception. It has been
our good fortune to have resided on
the Farm in what Dr. Jordan —than
whom there is 110 one better qualified
to judge—has termed "The Golden
Age of Stanford," and the class of
1913 has played no small part in bring
ing about this excellent state of affairs.
The men and women of 1913 have done
their duty, as members of the Univer
sity and the Student Body; and de
parting leave behind them many not
able achievements.
Two things of the greatest import
ance stand out as milestones in the
career of the class. Student Control
and the Stanford Union. The former
was evolved with the aid of Thirteen
men, and members of the 1913 class
carried it over the first and most try
ing stage. The life of this venture
naturally depended upon the results of
the first, year's trial. That the sys
tem has been an unqualified success
cannot be gainsaid and the Thirteen

men, Kern, Ingraham and Ambrose
who are members of the first Student
Council are three of those most de
serving of credit.
The Stanford Union was first con
ceived by that loyal alumnus, Her
bert C. Hoover, '95, and has been
largely financed by him. Its being de
pended upon procurring enough inter
est and capital in the Student Body.
The plan was fostered in February,
1910, while the members of this class
were still in their collegiate infancy.
13ut age counted for naught when it
came to showing the real Stanford
spirit. In that memorable assembly
011 February 25, the class of 1913, the
babes of the University, subscribed
$3,000 in less than one hour. This
sum exceeded that raised by the class
of 1910 and was only a little short of
the largest amount, which was con
tributed by 1911. Subscribing and
paying, however, are vastly different.
The Union funds increased but little
in the first year and a half and the
Union came to be considered a vague
dream. It remained for members of
this class to set the active campaign
in motion. As soon as we left our
underclassmen days and acquired the
"corduroy" privilege our influence
commenced to be felt and the Union
was one of the instances. Fete Am
brose started the boom. Chandler car
ried it 011, and Ingraham finished the
work so well started. And now as we
are about to leave the University we
can almost see the concrete realiza
tion of Hoover's plan. Time will tell
the great service that this building
will render. What the Houston Club
is to the University of Pennsylvania,
what the Reynolds Club is to the Uni
versity of Chicago or for a more
homely example what the Encina Club
room is to the men of the Hall, the
Stanford Union will be to the students
and alumni of Stanford.
The women have kept right along
side of the men in the matter of pro
gress. They have secured Self Gov
ernment and a Woman's clubhouse
which mean just as much to the wo
men as Student Control and the Stan
ford Union do to the men. Both have
been due largely to the efforts of mem

bers of this class. A successful sys
tem of self-government has been per
fected by Misses Hullis, Seeley, and
Wagner of the Women's Council and
Misses Hullis and Baker have been
active in securing funds for the club
house.
These two achievements mark great
epochs in Stanford history. Not since
the days of the pioneers when, we are
told, nothing was frequently made
into something over night, have there
been such important permanent ad
vances made in Student Body condi
tions. Student Control gives every as
surance of internal peace. The Union
should produce greater cohesion and
strength.
As a potent power in Student Body
activities, Nineteen Thirteen has been
second to none. From the day of the
underclass rush when time had to be
extended and sophomores released
from the morgue in order to save the
day for 1912, our strength has been
realized and each year has seen us
grow stronger. With but six days of
practice our freshman football team
held the sophomores to a tie in the
Interclass series and it required an
other twenty minutes for the exper
ienced sophs to cross our line. In
October, 1910, we scored the first vic
tory over the California babies in five
years and also won the distinction of
being the first and only Stanford class

the Cardinal reputation of never hav
ing lost a freshman regatta by

four in the one mile race. Beal, Dur

to tell. At the opening of the first
semester occurred that memorable
poster episcode when a horde of
Freshmen captured the Sophomore de
crees as they were being brought to
the campus in the wee small hours of
the morning. But even then Thirteen
could not be downed. A fast run
back to San Jose, the awakening of an
irate printer, and a record breaking
return to the campus with a fresh
edition spread gloom over the Fresh
men which was enhanced by the
wholesale tubbing and the rapid tie-up
in the afternoon. That year found
1913 first in interclass football, track,
crew, and tennis and we also captured
our first of a series of three Irish
marathons. The same season wit
nessed the passing of Menlo and pro
miscuous hazing from the Stanford
Hall of Fame.
The remaining years have been com
paratively peaceful, being taken up
with the customary plays, operas,
Plug-Uglies, Proms, cotillions and
Pe-rades. In each the class has dis
played skill and ingenuity and has left
a high standard for future genera
tions to follow.
1913 has had the pleasure of witness
ing two of the most successful ath
letic seasons ever recorded in Stan
lord annals. Our freshman year
brought victories in everything but
football, and this year, marked an
era of greater triumph, not a single
defeat did we suffer in a major sport.
The mean years were rather disas
trous, but the crew relieved our feel
ings somewhat. Our athletic suc
cesses have not been restricted to
California during the past four years.
We have won three Pacific Coast
championships, in baseball, track and
crew, sent an eight to the Pough
keepsie regatta, won the Middle West
Confrence once and we now have a
champion baseball team on the way
to Japan. Our one regret is that we
have failed to witness a Stanford foot
ball victory. Jupiter Pluvius robbed
us- of a sure chance and gave us a
mud-tie for consolation prize.
In each branch of sport 1913 men
have been in the lead. We have given
four captains of winning teams; Cass.
Campbell, Duryea and Murray. Be
sides them we have loaned Jimmie
I hoburn to 1914 in order to help de
teat ( alifornia in the fall, it being
found impossible to do without some
of us.
Ever since our first semester when
Stan Mitchell and Louis Cass dis
placed two Varsity football veterans,
I hirteen has been the dominant party
on the athletic teams. In football,
Thoburn, Kern, Baumgartner, Frank,
Mitchell and Cass have won the Var


II L. Loiml.
sity "S" and Kern was also a member
of the All-American team that invaded
Australia in 1910.,
In track there have been our prize
captain, Campbell, Dodge, Kern, Mor
rison, Murray, Argabrite, Brown,
Stevens, Horine, Price, Leaman and
Miller. Two world's records have
come to Stanford in this time, the
high jump and the pole vault. Un
fortunately Lee Scott's record no
longer stands, but the high jump
mark of six feet seven set by George
Horine, '13, will remain to remind our
posterity of the prowass of 1913's
athletea.
Mitchell, Cass, Argabrite, Beeger
and Childs formed as classy a lot of
ball tossers as every upheld the rep
utation of Stanford, while in crew,
Thirteen has been represented by
those husky warriors, Duryea, Heal,
Olmstead and Hofer. Never did these
men have to taste defeat in an in
tercollegiate boat race, but Dan
Cupid has since proved the master of
three.
Our tennis have been Murray,
Shaul, and Pratt; and for soccer we
have furnished Captains Pellas for
this year and Kiggins for next, be
sides a goodly number of players.
Nor have the accompishments of
1913 been confined solely to athletic
activities. As editors of The Daily
Palo Alto we have had Ingraham and
Loud. Miss Driscoll edited the Se
quoia and Duff has been loaned to
1014 in order to save the "lit."it not

being deemed safe to entrust it to less
experienced hands. Our funny men
have all been artistically bent and
hence we can claim no Chaparral
editor, but Duff and Manning are the
ones whose work we look for first
in the comic. In debating we have
had Smith, Leib, Simpson, Newell,
Bradford and Wood.
Originality has always marked
Thirteen's dramatic efforts. For four
years Wilson and Forbes have been
conducting the 1913 playwright bureau
for the benefit of the University. The
past three Junior operas have either
been written or revised by them, and
in addition they furnished skits in
numerable on demand. Misses Bullis,
Coleman, Ober, Beach, Parkinson,
Stevick, Emmons, Driscoll, Long, and
Messrs. Kern, Ingraham, Wilson,
Forbes, Mclnerney, Spence, Turpin,
Beurhaus, Brown and Manning form
a galaxj of dramatic talent from which
a cast to fit any play may be chosen.
For Student Body President we
have had Ambrose, and we contrib
ute Campbell to help guide the 1914
ship of state as vice-president. Not
since the 1909 class graduated has
there been a man capable of filling
Burbank's position and each year the
genial "Doc" has returned to be
graduate manager. It remained for
1913 to supply a satisfactory relief in
Wilcox who takes charge of the Stu
dent Body Finances in the fall.
In the scholarship list 1913 again
has an enviable position. Twenty
six have been elected to membership
in Phi Beta Kappa. They are Misses
Prekke, Newcomer, Driscoll, Judah,
Brooks, Crellin, Culp, Current, Gard
ner, Gower, Heckler, Kilpatrick, Libis,
Weaver, Withey, and Messrs. Fleming,
Smiley, Johnson, Green, Smith, Hatr
wig, Jenkins, Lawrence, Murray.
Swan, and Talbert.
This in brief is the story of the
life cf the class of 1913. Time for
bids me to take up many of the in
teresting details that have marked
the journey of the class. There are
events that stand out vividly in the
minds of each of us as individuals but
these must be overlooked in a gen
eral survey of our four year's life.
To attempt to pay for what we have
received at Stanford would be futile
but if our achievements have been
and will be of any benefit to the Uni
versity, then our efforts have not been
in vain. In our opinion the Stanford
of 1913 is better than the Stanford of
1909. May she continue to advance.

Mr. President, Classmates, and
Friends:

A little less than
four years ago,—
September 1, 1909,
to be exact, —there
arrived 011 the
S t an 112 ord Farm
some three hun
dred and fifty high
school graduates.
Gathered from each
quarter of the
globe, unknown to

each other, they came for the express
purpose of increasing their store of
knowledge. Today two hundred and
sixty of these same individuals, now
friends and comrades, leave the red
tiled roof of the Quad behind them to
seek for what the world has to offer.
What has transpired in these four
years is now a matter of history, and
as such it is my pleasure to chronicle
on this occasion, the last meeting of
the class of Nineteen Hundred and
Thirteen.
Each class that goes out of Stanford
thinks that its generation is the best,
and 1913 is no exception. It has been
our good fortune to have resided on
the Farm in what Dr. Jordan —than
whom there is 110 one better qualified
to judge—has termed "The Golden
Age of Stanford," and the class of
1913 has played no small part in bring
ing about this excellent state of affairs.
The men and women of 1913 have done
their duty, as members of the Univer
sity and the Student Body; and de
parting leave behind them many not
able achievements.
Two things of the greatest import
ance stand out as milestones in the
career of the class. Student Control
and the Stanford Union. The former
was evolved with the aid of Thirteen
men, and members of the 1913 class
carried it over the first and most try
ing stage. The life of this venture
naturally depended upon the results of
the first, year's trial. That the sys
tem has been an unqualified success
cannot be gainsaid and the Thirteen

men, Kern, Ingraham and Ambrose
who are members of the first Student
Council are three of those most de
serving of credit.
The Stanford Union was first con
ceived by that loyal alumnus, Her
bert C. Hoover, '95, and has been
largely financed by him. Its being de
pended upon procurring enough inter
est and capital in the Student Body.
The plan was fostered in February,
1910, while the members of this class
were still in their collegiate infancy.
13ut age counted for naught when it
came to showing the real Stanford
spirit. In that memorable assembly
011 February 25, the class of 1913, the
babes of the University, subscribed
$3,000 in less than one hour. This
sum exceeded that raised by the class
of 1910 and was only a little short of
the largest amount, which was con
tributed by 1911. Subscribing and
paying, however, are vastly different.
The Union funds increased but little
in the first year and a half and the
Union came to be considered a vague
dream. It remained for members of
this class to set the active campaign
in motion. As soon as we left our
underclassmen days and acquired the
"corduroy" privilege our influence
commenced to be felt and the Union
was one of the instances. Fete Am
brose started the boom. Chandler car
ried it 011, and Ingraham finished the
work so well started. And now as we
are about to leave the University we
can almost see the concrete realiza
tion of Hoover's plan. Time will tell
the great service that this building
will render. What the Houston Club
is to the University of Pennsylvania,
what the Reynolds Club is to the Uni
versity of Chicago or for a more
homely example what the Encina Club
room is to the men of the Hall, the
Stanford Union will be to the students
and alumni of Stanford.
The women have kept right along
side of the men in the matter of pro
gress. They have secured Self Gov
ernment and a Woman's clubhouse
which mean just as much to the wo
men as Student Control and the Stan
ford Union do to the men. Both have
been due largely to the efforts of mem

bers of this class. A successful sys
tem of self-government has been per
fected by Misses Hullis, Seeley, and
Wagner of the Women's Council and
Misses Hullis and Baker have been
active in securing funds for the club
house.
These two achievements mark great
epochs in Stanford history. Not since
the days of the pioneers when, we are
told, nothing was frequently made
into something over night, have there
been such important permanent ad
vances made in Student Body condi
tions. Student Control gives every as
surance of internal peace. The Union
should produce greater cohesion and
strength.
As a potent power in Student Body
activities, Nineteen Thirteen has been
second to none. From the day of the
underclass rush when time had to be
extended and sophomores released
from the morgue in order to save the
day for 1912, our strength has been
realized and each year has seen us
grow stronger. With but six days of
practice our freshman football team
held the sophomores to a tie in the
Interclass series and it required an
other twenty minutes for the exper
ienced sophs to cross our line. In
October, 1910, we scored the first vic
tory over the California babies in five
years and also won the distinction of
being the first and only Stanford class
to win an intercollegiate freshman
Rugby game. Stan Mitchell led the
team that day and was supported by
Fyfe, Ambrose, Bly, Frank, Baum
gartner, Duryea, Murlin, Lull, Belcher,
Worswick, Thoburn, Arrell, Cass,
Kern, and Ellis. In crew we upheld
the Cardinal reputation of never hav
ing lost a freshman regatta by
triumphing over the Blue and Gold
four in the one mile race. Beal, Dur
yea, Grepe and Olmstead pulled the
oars in this boat and were guided by
Larry Marx. That same day saw the
Stanford Varsity win the big race with
a freshman, Hofer, in the shell. In
track 19K5 was forced to succumb to
the overwhelming numbers of the Blue
and Gold on an oval that bore a strik
ing resemblance to the football field
last fall.
The second semester of our fresh
man year was the stormiest that has
been experienced since we have been
in college. It looker for a time as if
Intercollegiate relations would be
severed on account of the dispute over
the "Five Year Rule" and within the
University dissension was ram
pant. The Sequoia—Scaraboeia con
troversy divided the Student Body
and the quarrel became so warm that
violence was resorted to on one occa
sion. Being freshmen, Nineteen
Thirteen had to play the role of the
interested onlooker in these stirring
times, but the lessons we learned were
not forgotten and often stood us in
good stead when we assumed control
of affairs later.

It whs in the Sophomore year that.
Thirteen's star began to shine most
brilliantly. By that time we had be
come full-fledged Stanford men and
women and our true worth commenced
to tell. At the opening of the first
semester occurred that memorable
poster episcode when a horde of
Freshmen captured the Sophomore de

Australia in 1910.,
In track there have been our prize
captain, Campbell, Dodge, Kern, Mor

Stevens, Horine, Price, Leaman and
Miller. Two world's records have
come to Stanford in this time, the
high jump and the pole vault. Un
fortunately Lee Scott's record no
longer stands, but the high jump
mark of six feet seven set by George
Horine, '13, will remain to remind our
posterity of the prowass of 1913's
athletea.

Our tennis have been Murray,
Shaul, and Pratt; and for soccer we
have furnished Captains Pellas for
this year and Kiggins for next, be

Nor have the accompishments of
1913 been confined solely to athletic
activities. As editors of The Daily
Palo Alto we have had Ingraham and
Loud. Miss Driscoll edited the Se
quoia and Duff has been loaned to
1014 in order to save the "lit."it not

being deemed safe to entrust it to less
experienced hands. Our funny men
have all been artistically bent and
hence we can claim no Chaparral
editor, but Duff and Manning are the
ones whose work we look for first
in the comic. In debating we have
had Smith, Leib, Simpson, Newell,
Bradford and Wood.
Originality has always marked
Thirteen's dramatic efforts. For four
years Wilson and Forbes have been
conducting the 1913 playwright bureau
for the benefit of the University. The
past three Junior operas have either
been written or revised by them, and
in addition they furnished skits in
numerable on demand. Misses Bullis,
Coleman, Ober, Beach, Parkinson,
Stevick, Emmons, Driscoll, Long, and
Messrs. Kern, Ingraham, Wilson,
Forbes, Mclnerney, Spence, Turpin,
Beurhaus, Brown and Manning form
a galaxj of dramatic talent from which
a cast to fit any play may be chosen.
For Student Body President we
have had Ambrose, and we contrib
ute Campbell to help guide the 1914
ship of state as vice-president. Not
since the 1909 class graduated has
there been a man capable of filling
Burbank's position and each year the
genial "Doc" has returned to be
graduate manager. It remained for
1913 to supply a satisfactory relief in
Wilcox who takes charge of the Stu
dent Body Finances in the fall.
In the scholarship list 1913 again
has an enviable position. Twenty
six have been elected to membership
in Phi Beta Kappa. They are Misses
Prekke, Newcomer, Driscoll, Judah,
Brooks, Crellin, Culp, Current, Gard
ner, Gower, Heckler, Kilpatrick, Libis,
Weaver, Withey, and Messrs. Fleming,
Smiley, Johnson, Green, Smith, Hatr

Swan, and Talbert.
This in brief is the story of the
life cf the class of 1913. Time for
bids me to take up many of the in
teresting details that have marked
the journey of the class. There are
events that stand out vividly in the
minds of each of us as individuals but
these must be overlooked in a gen
eral survey of our four year's life.
To attempt to pay for what we have
received at Stanford would be futile
but if our achievements have been
and will be of any benefit to the Uni
versity, then our efforts have not been
in vain. In our opinion the Stanford
of 1913 is better than the Stanford of
1909. May she continue to advance.

Mr. President, Classmates, and
Friends:

A little less than
four years ago,—
September 1, 1909,
to be exact, —there
arrived 011 the
S t an 112 ord Farm
some three hun
dred and fifty high
school graduates.
Gathered from each
quarter of the
globe, unknown to

each other, they came for the express
purpose of increasing their store of
knowledge. Today two hundred and
sixty of these same individuals, now
friends and comrades, leave the red
tiled roof of the Quad behind them to
seek for what the world has to offer.
What has transpired in these four
years is now a matter of history, and
as such it is my pleasure to chronicle
on this occasion, the last meeting of
the class of Nineteen Hundred and
Thirteen.
Each class that goes out of Stanford
thinks that its generation is the best,
and 1913 is no exception. It has been
our good fortune to have resided on
the Farm in what Dr. Jordan —than
whom there is 110 one better qualified
to judge—has termed "The Golden
Age of Stanford," and the class of
1913 has played no small part in bring
ing about this excellent state of affairs.
The men and women of 1913 have done
their duty, as members of the Univer
sity and the Student Body; and de
parting leave behind them many not
able achievements.
Two things of the greatest import
ance stand out as milestones in the
career of the class. Student Control
and the Stanford Union. The former
was evolved with the aid of Thirteen
men, and members of the 1913 class
carried it over the first and most try
ing stage. The life of this venture
naturally depended upon the results of
the first, year's trial. That the sys
tem has been an unqualified success
cannot be gainsaid and the Thirteen

men, Kern, Ingraham and Ambrose
who are members of the first Student
Council are three of those most de
serving of credit.
The Stanford Union was first con
ceived by that loyal alumnus, Her
bert C. Hoover, '95, and has been
largely financed by him. Its being de
pended upon procurring enough inter
est and capital in the Student Body.
The plan was fostered in February,
1910, while the members of this class
were still in their collegiate infancy.
13ut age counted for naught when it
came to showing the real Stanford
spirit. In that memorable assembly
011 February 25, the class of 1913, the
babes of the University, subscribed
$3,000 in less than one hour. This
sum exceeded that raised by the class
of 1910 and was only a little short of
the largest amount, which was con
tributed by 1911. Subscribing and
paying, however, are vastly different.
The Union funds increased but little
in the first year and a half and the
Union came to be considered a vague
dream. It remained for members of
this class to set the active campaign
in motion. As soon as we left our
underclassmen days and acquired the
"corduroy" privilege our influence
commenced to be felt and the Union
was one of the instances. Fete Am
brose started the boom. Chandler car
ried it 011, and Ingraham finished the
work so well started. And now as we
are about to leave the University we
can almost see the concrete realiza
tion of Hoover's plan. Time will tell
the great service that this building
will render. What the Houston Club
is to the University of Pennsylvania,
what the Reynolds Club is to the Uni
versity of Chicago or for a more
homely example what the Encina Club
room is to the men of the Hall, the
Stanford Union will be to the students
and alumni of Stanford.
The women have kept right along
side of the men in the matter of pro
gress. They have secured Self Gov
ernment and a Woman's clubhouse
which mean just as much to the wo
men as Student Control and the Stan
ford Union do to the men. Both have
been due largely to the efforts of mem

bers of this class. A successful sys
tem of self-government has been per
fected by Misses Hullis, Seeley, and
Wagner of the Women's Council and
Misses Hullis and Baker have been
active in securing funds for the club
house.
These two achievements mark great
epochs in Stanford history. Not since
the days of the pioneers when, we are
told, nothing was frequently made
into something over night, have there
been such important permanent ad
vances made in Student Body condi
tions. Student Control gives every as
surance of internal peace. The Union
should produce greater cohesion and
strength.
As a potent power in Student Body
activities, Nineteen Thirteen has been
second to none. From the day of the
underclass rush when time had to be
extended and sophomores released
from the morgue in order to save the
day for 1912, our strength has been
realized and each year has seen us
grow stronger. With but six days of
practice our freshman football team
held the sophomores to a tie in the
Interclass series and it required an
other twenty minutes for the exper
ienced sophs to cross our line. In
October, 1910, we scored the first vic
tory over the California babies in five
years and also won the distinction of
being the first and only Stanford class
to win an intercollegiate freshman
Rugby game. Stan Mitchell led the
team that day and was supported by
Fyfe, Ambrose, Bly, Frank, Baum
gartner, Duryea, Murlin, Lull, Belcher,
Worswick, Thoburn, Arrell, Cass,
Kern, and Ellis. In crew we upheld
the Cardinal reputation of never hav
ing lost a freshman regatta by
triumphing over the Blue and Gold
four in the one mile race. Beal, Dur
yea, Grepe and Olmstead pulled the
oars in this boat and were guided by
Larry Marx. That same day saw the
Stanford Varsity win the big race with
a freshman, Hofer, in the shell. In
track 19K5 was forced to succumb to
the overwhelming numbers of the Blue
and Gold on an oval that bore a strik
ing resemblance to the football field
last fall.
The second semester of our fresh
man year was the stormiest that has
been experienced since we have been
in college. It looker for a time as if
Intercollegiate relations would be
severed on account of the dispute over
the "Five Year Rule" and within the
University dissension was ram
pant. The Sequoia—Scaraboeia con
troversy divided the Student Body
and the quarrel became so warm that
violence was resorted to on one occa
sion. Being freshmen, Nineteen
Thirteen had to play the role of the
interested onlooker in these stirring
times, but the lessons we learned were
not forgotten and often stood us in
good stead when we assumed control
of affairs later.

It whs in the Sophomore year that.
Thirteen's star began to shine most
brilliantly. By that time we had be
come full-fledged Stanford men and
women and our true worth commenced
to tell. At the opening of the first
semester occurred that memorable
poster episcode when a horde of
Freshmen captured the Sophomore de
crees as they were being brought to
the campus in the wee small hours of
the morning. But even then Thirteen
could not be downed. A fast run
back to San Jose, the awakening of an
irate printer, and a record breaking
return to the campus with a fresh
edition spread gloom over the Fresh
men which was enhanced by the
wholesale tubbing and the rapid tie-up
in the afternoon. That year found
1913 first in interclass football, track,
crew, and tennis and we also captured
our first of a series of three Irish
marathons. The same season wit
nessed the passing of Menlo and pro
miscuous hazing from the Stanford
Hall of Fame.
The remaining years have been com
paratively peaceful, being taken up
with the customary plays, operas,
Plug-Uglies, Proms, cotillions and
Pe-rades. In each the class has dis
played skill and ingenuity and has left
a high standard for future genera
tions to follow.
1913 has had the pleasure of witness
ing two of the most successful ath
letic seasons ever recorded in Stan
lord annals. Our freshman year
brought victories in everything but
football, and this year, marked an
era of greater triumph, not a single
defeat did we suffer in a major sport.
The mean years were rather disas
trous, but the crew relieved our feel
ings somewhat. Our athletic suc
cesses have not been restricted to
California during the past four years.
We have won three Pacific Coast
championships, in baseball, track and
crew, sent an eight to the Pough
keepsie regatta, won the Middle West
Confrence once and we now have a
champion baseball team on the way
to Japan. Our one regret is that we
have failed to witness a Stanford foot
ball victory. Jupiter Pluvius robbed
us- of a sure chance and gave us a
mud-tie for consolation prize.
In each branch of sport 1913 men
have been in the lead. We have given
four captains of winning teams; Cass.
Campbell, Duryea and Murray. Be
sides them we have loaned Jimmie

quoia and Duff has been loaned to
1014 in order to save the "lit."it not

being deemed safe to entrust it to less
experienced hands. Our funny men
have all been artistically bent and
hence we can claim no Chaparral
editor, but Duff and Manning are the
ones whose work we look for first
in the comic. In debating we have
had Smith, Leib, Simpson, Newell,
Bradford and Wood.
Originality has always marked
Thirteen's dramatic efforts. For four
years Wilson and Forbes have been
conducting the 1913 playwright bureau
for the benefit of the University. The
past three Junior operas have either
been written or revised by them, and
in addition they furnished skits in
numerable on demand. Misses Bullis,
Coleman, Ober, Beach, Parkinson,
Stevick, Emmons, Driscoll, Long, and
Messrs. Kern, Ingraham, Wilson,
Forbes, Mclnerney, Spence, Turpin,
Beurhaus, Brown and Manning form
a galaxj of dramatic talent from which
a cast to fit any play may be chosen.
For Student Body President we
have had Ambrose, and we contrib
ute Campbell to help guide the 1914
ship of state as vice-president. Not
since the 1909 class graduated has
there been a man capable of filling
Burbank's position and each year the
genial "Doc" has returned to be
graduate manager. It remained for
1913 to supply a satisfactory relief in
Wilcox who takes charge of the Stu
dent Body Finances in the fall.
In the scholarship list 1913 again
has an enviable position. Twenty
six have been elected to membership
in Phi Beta Kappa. They are Misses
Prekke, Newcomer, Driscoll, Judah,
Brooks, Crellin, Culp, Current, Gard
ner, Gower, Heckler, Kilpatrick, Libis,
Weaver, Withey, and Messrs. Fleming,
Smiley, Johnson, Green, Smith, Hatr
wig, Jenkins, Lawrence, Murray.
Swan, and Talbert.
This in brief is the story of the
life cf the class of 1913. Time for
bids me to take up many of the in
teresting details that have marked
the journey of the class. There are
events that stand out vividly in the
minds of each of us as individuals but
these must be overlooked in a gen
eral survey of our four year's life.
To attempt to pay for what we have
received at Stanford would be futile
but if our achievements have been
and will be of any benefit to the Uni
versity, then our efforts have not been
in vain. In our opinion the Stanford
of 1913 is better than the Stanford of
1909. May she continue to advance.
