# CLASS WILL
## 
### 
We, the Class of
Nineteen Thirteen,
having attained
that number of
hours allotted to
man, and being
therefore about to
pass into that
other life where
the monthly check
does not come
from home, and

being of sound and disposing mind
and memory, do hereby make this, our
last will and testament in order to
distribute, as justly as we may, our
interests and our possessions among
succeeding men.
ITEM: Of that part of our inter
ests and possessions represented by
credits duly stored up in the Regis
trar's office, by which the Faculty
reckons our worth, being inconsider
able and of none account, we will take
none account in this our last will and
testament.
ITEM: To those who remain, and to
those who are to come, we give a
legacy of Stanford Spirit,â€”a legacy
to cherish and to guard, for we, who
are about to go, realize now more
fully than we ever did, what Stanford
is and what Stanford means. This
spirit we leave as a sacred thing, con
fident that it will be kept so always.
ITEM: To the Stanford Farm we
give a very true affection and a
promise to return as often as may
be, for no matter where we are, our
days here shall come to us as a
blessed memory.
ITEM : We entrust the Football Team
to Jimmy Thoburn, knowing well that
in no hands are the sportsmanship,

honor, and success of a Stanford Var
sity safer than in his. We commend
the wise choice of Floyd Brown, -is
coach, and of Harry Maloney, as
trainer of the Football Team. We
grant to this happy combination the
right and privilege of giving to Cali
fornia a large and thorough beating
on the turf next fall.
ITEM: We leave to Zebulon Terry
our full and unconditional consent,
not only to lead another of those Base
ball Teams that hit, and field, and
run liases as baseball teams should,
but to repeat next spring the success
that marked his efforts this semester.
ITEM: In the hands of Paul Mc-
Kee we leave the destinies of the
Knights of the Limited Wardrobe,
with the admonition to beat Berkeley
by more than two-fifths of a point, for
it is too great a strain on the student
body nerves to live through another
track meet like the last one.
ITEM: The Crew we confidently in
trust to Phil Clover to lead to another
victory over the Blue and Gold.
ITEM: The Daily Palo Alto we
grant, in trust for one semester, to
Squire Behrens, hoping that he may
find a little time now and again, be
tween his fussing activities, to pub
lish the paper.
ITEM: We grant to Les Summer
field the Hammer of Weight, for none
can wield it better than he. We are
Chappie's "Now Thats" will knock
the things that need knocking most,
and boost the things of most worth.
ITEM: We leave Art Halm in
charge of the Student Body, knowing
that his act and ability will still fur
ther improve the good fellowship that
now exists.
ITEM: We devise and bequeath to
the Student Body, and to their heirs
and assigns forever, one Stanford

Union Building, with whatever of
good times, true friendships, and ade
quate meeting places it may bring.
Here, we are sure, will be fostered
and preserved always, that true de
mocracy that we boast of now.
ITEM: To the Class of Nineteen
Fourteen we concede our sombreros,
feeling that they are fully capable,
with the aid of such and sundry of the
Class of Nineteen Thirteen, as re
main, to guide and direct the policies
of the University.
ITEM: We give to Nineteen Fifteen
premission to step into corduroys and
wear the Ugly Plug, but only after
said plugs have been duly christened
by the Seniors.
ITEM: To the Class of Sixteen we
gives in trust for one year, the Red
Hat, the symbol of the rough and
rowdy, but with the admonition that
they do not let Seventeen do to them
what they did to others, for it is good
that the Frosh be tied up. And also,
we give to be theirs, the right and
privilege of wearing a pipe, as is the
inalienable right and privilege of
Sophomores.
ITEM: To the queeners we give,
devise and bequeath Five Hundred of
Them, together with Lagunita and the
Arboretum, with such appurtenances
thereof as the witchery of moonlit
nights and the long, lazy days of
spring.
ITEM: To Blondy Claussen, we give
our full consent, to continue being the
goat as long as he may remain in our
fair University.
ITEM: To Shorty Ross we leave an
air of selfconfidence and importance,
since we feel that he needs only that
to attain leadership of the Band.
ITEM: To the Business Office we
concede one last, long, glad farewell,
and our live dollar graduation fee. It

must be fine to be a Business Office.
So end our gilts, devises and be
quests. In a little while we will be
saying good-by to the tiled roofs, and
the arched corridors, to the palm-and
eucalyptus lined drives, to hall and to
Row, to the terrace and Pally, and we
will be going out into the world to
make Stanford and for ourselves, a
name worth the making.
So be it willed.
(Signed)
CLASS OF NINETEEN THIRTEEN.
