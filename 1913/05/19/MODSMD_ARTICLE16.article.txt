# CLASS ORATION
## 
### 
President Jordan, and Members of the
Class of 1913:

It was eigh
teen years ago
that the mem
bers of the
pioneer class
of Stanford
entered upon
what was to
them as mem
orable a Com
mencement as
th is is to us.
It was at that

time that they conceived the idea of
dedicating a bronze piate which should
stand as a memorial to their four years
of college life, and as a mute testi
monial of their gratitude for what had
been so freely given them.
Succeeding classes have seen fit
to follow their example, not simply
because they wished the formality
of living up t oa custom but be
cause they had lived through the
same thoughts that the class of '95
had. It is in this spirit that we, to
day, as one of the last acts which we
perform under the name of "191.'?,"


E. ('. Smith
