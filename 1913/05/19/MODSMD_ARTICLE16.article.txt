# CLASS ORATION

### 
President Jordan, and Members of the
Class of 1913:

It was eigh
teen years ago
that the mem
bers of the
pioneer class
of Stanford
entered upon
what was to
them as mem
orable a Com
mencement as
th is is to us.
It was at that

time that they conceived the idea of
dedicating a bronze piate which should
stand as a memorial to their four years
of college life, and as a mute testi
monial of their gratitude for what had
been so freely given them.
Succeeding classes have seen fit
to follow their example, not simply
because they wished the formality
of living up t oa custom but be
cause they had lived through the
same thoughts that the class of '95
had. It is in this spirit that we, to
day, as one of the last acts which we
perform under the name of "191.'?,"


E. ('. Smith
meet here to dedicate our class plate.
This short row of bronze plates
marks with symbolic significance the
history of the University. It repre
sents to the world the results of this
great educational institution. Every
twelve months a new link is added to
the chain. As years go by this metal
lic band will creep slowly around the
quadrangle. None of us, perhaps, will
live to see it reach yonder corner. By
the time it gets around to the pioneer
plate again and forms a complete
circle, as much as five centuries will
have passed. The plate of "1913"
which we are about to lay will form
an integral part of that metallic chain.
In the same manner the "Class of
1913" will form an integral part of the
product of this University. As the
success of any institution depends
upon the quality of its product, so
the justification of the continued ex
istence of Stanford rests to a large
extent upon us. Therefore we must
not forget the responsibility that .ve
have assumed by becoming Stanford
men and women.
It seems but yesterday that we
came upon this quadrangle for the
first time and were called Stanford
Freshmen. I can well remember how
some one counted off four blank
squares from the plate of the class of
'09 and said, "Here is where our plate
will be laid." During the past four
years each one of us has taken those
four steps, through the Freshman,
Sophomore, Junior, and Senior years.
We now stand at the end of our task.
Though we all regret leaving our
Alma Mater which has been so dear
to us, yet we cannot help but feel
happy at having completed the task
which we mapped out for ourselves
years ago. Our thoughts can be
likened to those of the men who were
on the winning Irish Marathon team
as they talked over the race at the
close of the day. Our feelings may be
likened to those of the vvhole Student
Body a few weeks ago when Stanford
scored three successive victories over
her rival. A worthy task had been
brought to a successful termination.
The satisfaction that conies from
having done something worth while,
the joy of achievement, upurs us on to
greater and greater heights.
The plate which we are about to lay
is more than a mere memorial of the

four years spent within these halls.
Each and every one of us will have
ample recollection of all that has
happened within that time, for the
tablets of our memories will be filled
with cherished thoughts of happy days
we have spent here. This bronze plate
is a mute token of acknowledgement of
that which we have so richly received.
Just as we have taken out the soft
mortar from this sidewalk and now
put back a harder and more enduring
block composed of bronze, so the Uni
versity has replaced our weak and
childish ideas with firmer convictions
and truer opinions. Much has been
freely given us. This we have en
joyed to the fullest extent,, and ex
tremely ungrateful we would be were
we to take all we could get and leave
without a mere "Thank You." To
Dr. Jordan and others in the Univer
sity we represent a part of their life
work. They have spent months and
years with us, watching our intellects
and personalities slowly unfold. They
have done all they could and now
leave us to prove whether the effort
was worth while or not. They await
the justification of their labors. It is
for us to prove to society that their
work was not in vain.
This dedication, however, has a
deeper significance than a mere ack
nowledgement. If that were all that
it meant our payment would indeed be
meager. In its truest sense, this
plate represents a pledge upon our
part that we will not prove unworthy
of the priceless gift which we have
received. We are told that educa
tion is free; yet some one has had to
pay for it. It is thus incumbent upon
us to pay this debt back to society.
The ideals and spirit of this Uni
versity have been inculcated into us
until they have become a part of us.
Having been taught the value of
reality and the fruitlessness of pom
pous ceremony and idle action, we
should not simply sit on the side-lines
of life but mix in the heat of the fray.
Indeed, we would be unworthy of the
name of Stanford should we fail to
become great dynamic forces on the
side of civic righteousness, progress,
and humanity.
We have been inspired by that spirit
of broadmindedness which permeates
this whole institution. It has been
our privilege to become citizens of the
world; to look beyond the borders
of our own home, town, state, or na
tion; to include the whole globe with

in our scope. As college men and
women, we have seen the vision of the
world as a unit and have recognized a
common humanity in all races. It 3s
thus our duty to lead public opinion
in the right path and to tight against
prejudice, intolerance, and ignorance.
The doctrine of the Brotherhood of
Man is sure to triumph and the mem
bers of the Class of 1913 should play
a vital part in hastening that triumph.
Dr. Jordan, it is in this spirit that
the "Class of 1913" dedicates this
plate to its Alma Mater. May it be a
memorial of the four happy years w<
have spent here, an acknowledgement
of the priceless gift that we have re
ceived, and a pledge that we will
strive to live up to the responsibility
that falls upon us as alumni of this
institution. We hope that in years
to come we will not be found wanting.

plate to its Alma Mater. May it be a
memorial of the four happy years w<
have spent here, an acknowledgement
of the priceless gift that we have re
ceived, and a pledge that we will
strive to live up to the responsibility
that falls upon us as alumni of this
institution. We hope that in years
to come we will not be found wanting.
President Jordan, and Members of the
Class of 1913:

It was eigh
teen years ago
that the mem
bers of the
pioneer class
of Stanford
entered upon
what was to
them as mem
orable a Com
mencement as
th is is to us.
It was at that

time that they conceived the idea of
dedicating a bronze piate which should
stand as a memorial to their four years
of college life, and as a mute testi
monial of their gratitude for what had
been so freely given them.
Succeeding classes have seen fit
to follow their example, not simply
because they wished the formality
of living up t oa custom but be
cause they had lived through the
same thoughts that the class of '95
had. It is in this spirit that we, to
day, as one of the last acts which we
perform under the name of "191.'?,"


E. ('. Smith
meet here to dedicate our class plate.
This short row of bronze plates
marks with symbolic significance the
history of the University. It repre
sents to the world the results of this
great educational institution. Every
twelve months a new link is added to
the chain. As years go by this metal
lic band will creep slowly around the
quadrangle. None of us, perhaps, will
live to see it reach yonder corner. By
the time it gets around to the pioneer
plate again and forms a complete
circle, as much as five centuries will
have passed. The plate of "1913"
which we are about to lay will form
an integral part of that metallic chain.
In the same manner the "Class of
1913" will form an integral part of the
product of this University. As the
success of any institution depends
upon the quality of its product, so
the justification of the continued ex
istence of Stanford rests to a large
extent upon us. Therefore we must
not forget the responsibility that .ve
have assumed by becoming Stanford
men and women.
It seems but yesterday that we
came upon this quadrangle for the
first time and were called Stanford
Freshmen. I can well remember how
some one counted off four blank
squares from the plate of the class of
'09 and said, "Here is where our plate
will be laid." During the past four
years each one of us has taken those
four steps, through the Freshman,
Sophomore, Junior, and Senior years.
We now stand at the end of our task.
Though we all regret leaving our
Alma Mater which has been so dear
to us, yet we cannot help but feel
happy at having completed the task
which we mapped out for ourselves
years ago. Our thoughts can be
likened to those of the men who were
on the winning Irish Marathon team
as they talked over the race at the
close of the day. Our feelings may be
likened to those of the vvhole Student
Body a few weeks ago when Stanford
scored three successive victories over
her rival. A worthy task had been
brought to a successful termination.
The satisfaction that conies from
having done something worth while,
the joy of achievement, upurs us on to
greater and greater heights.
The plate which we are about to lay
is more than a mere memorial of the

four years spent within these halls.
Each and every one of us will have
ample recollection of all that has
happened within that time, for the
tablets of our memories will be filled
with cherished thoughts of happy days
we have spent here. This bronze plate
is a mute token of acknowledgement of
that which we have so richly received.
Just as we have taken out the soft
mortar from this sidewalk and now
put back a harder and more enduring
block composed of bronze, so the Uni
versity has replaced our weak and
childish ideas with firmer convictions
and truer opinions. Much has been
freely given us. This we have en
joyed to the fullest extent,, and ex
tremely ungrateful we would be were
we to take all we could get and leave
without a mere "Thank You." To
Dr. Jordan and others in the Univer
sity we represent a part of their life
work. They have spent months and
years with us, watching our intellects
and personalities slowly unfold. They
have done all they could and now
leave us to prove whether the effort
was worth while or not. They await
the justification of their labors. It is
for us to prove to society that their
work was not in vain.
This dedication, however, has a
deeper significance than a mere ack
nowledgement. If that were all that
it meant our payment would indeed be
meager. In its truest sense, this
plate represents a pledge upon our
part that we will not prove unworthy
of the priceless gift which we have
received. We are told that educa
tion is free; yet some one has had to
pay for it. It is thus incumbent upon
us to pay this debt back to society.
The ideals and spirit of this Uni
versity have been inculcated into us
until they have become a part of us.
Having been taught the value of
reality and the fruitlessness of pom
pous ceremony and idle action, we
should not simply sit on the side-lines
of life but mix in the heat of the fray.
Indeed, we would be unworthy of the
name of Stanford should we fail to
become great dynamic forces on the
side of civic righteousness, progress,
and humanity.
We have been inspired by that spirit
of broadmindedness which permeates
this whole institution. It has been
our privilege to become citizens of the
world; to look beyond the borders
of our own home, town, state, or na
tion; to include the whole globe with

in our scope. As college men and
women, we have seen the vision of the
world as a unit and have recognized a
common humanity in all races. It 3s
thus our duty to lead public opinion
in the right path and to tight against
prejudice, intolerance, and ignorance.
The doctrine of the Brotherhood of
Man is sure to triumph and the mem
bers of the Class of 1913 should play
a vital part in hastening that triumph.
Dr. Jordan, it is in this spirit that
the "Class of 1913" dedicates this
plate to its Alma Mater. May it be a
memorial of the four happy years w<
have spent here, an acknowledgement
of the priceless gift that we have re

thus our duty to lead public opinion
in the right path and to tight against
prejudice, intolerance, and ignorance.
The doctrine of the Brotherhood of
Man is sure to triumph and the mem
bers of the Class of 1913 should play
a vital part in hastening that triumph.
Dr. Jordan, it is in this spirit that
the "Class of 1913" dedicates this
plate to its Alma Mater. May it be a
memorial of the four happy years w<
have spent here, an acknowledgement
of the priceless gift that we have re
ceived, and a pledge that we will
strive to live up to the responsibility
that falls upon us as alumni of this
institution. We hope that in years
to come we will not be found wanting.
President Jordan, and Members of the
Class of 1913:

It was eigh
teen years ago
that the mem
bers of the
pioneer class
of Stanford
entered upon
what was to
them as mem
orable a Com
mencement as
th is is to us.
It was at that

time that they conceived the idea of
dedicating a bronze piate which should
stand as a memorial to their four years
of college life, and as a mute testi
monial of their gratitude for what had
been so freely given them.
Succeeding classes have seen fit
to follow their example, not simply
because they wished the formality
of living up t oa custom but be
cause they had lived through the
same thoughts that the class of '95
had. It is in this spirit that we, to
day, as one of the last acts which we
perform under the name of "191.'?,"


E. ('. Smith
meet here to dedicate our class plate.
This short row of bronze plates
marks with symbolic significance the
history of the University. It repre
sents to the world the results of this
great educational institution. Every
twelve months a new link is added to
the chain. As years go by this metal
lic band will creep slowly around the
quadrangle. None of us, perhaps, will
live to see it reach yonder corner. By
the time it gets around to the pioneer
plate again and forms a complete
circle, as much as five centuries will
have passed. The plate of "1913"
which we are about to lay will form
an integral part of that metallic chain.
In the same manner the "Class of
1913" will form an integral part of the
product of this University. As the
success of any institution depends
upon the quality of its product, so
the justification of the continued ex
istence of Stanford rests to a large
extent upon us. Therefore we must
not forget the responsibility that .ve
have assumed by becoming Stanford
men and women.
It seems but yesterday that we
came upon this quadrangle for the
first time and were called Stanford
Freshmen. I can well remember how
some one counted off four blank
squares from the plate of the class of
'09 and said, "Here is where our plate
will be laid." During the past four
years each one of us has taken those
four steps, through the Freshman,
Sophomore, Junior, and Senior years.
We now stand at the end of our task.
Though we all regret leaving our
Alma Mater which has been so dear
to us, yet we cannot help but feel
happy at having completed the task
which we mapped out for ourselves
years ago. Our thoughts can be
likened to those of the men who were
on the winning Irish Marathon team
as they talked over the race at the
close of the day. Our feelings may be
likened to those of the vvhole Student
Body a few weeks ago when Stanford
scored three successive victories over
her rival. A worthy task had been
brought to a successful termination.
The satisfaction that conies from
having done something worth while,
the joy of achievement, upurs us on to
greater and greater heights.
The plate which we are about to lay
is more than a mere memorial of the

four years spent within these halls.
Each and every one of us will have
ample recollection of all that has
happened within that time, for the
tablets of our memories will be filled
with cherished thoughts of happy days
we have spent here. This bronze plate
is a mute token of acknowledgement of
that which we have so richly received.
Just as we have taken out the soft
mortar from this sidewalk and now
put back a harder and more enduring
block composed of bronze, so the Uni
versity has replaced our weak and
childish ideas with firmer convictions
and truer opinions. Much has been
freely given us. This we have en
joyed to the fullest extent,, and ex
tremely ungrateful we would be were
we to take all we could get and leave
without a mere "Thank You." To
Dr. Jordan and others in the Univer
sity we represent a part of their life
work. They have spent months and
years with us, watching our intellects
and personalities slowly unfold. They
have done all they could and now
leave us to prove whether the effort
was worth while or not. They await
the justification of their labors. It is
for us to prove to society that their
work was not in vain.
This dedication, however, has a
deeper significance than a mere ack
nowledgement. If that were all that
it meant our payment would indeed be
meager. In its truest sense, this
plate represents a pledge upon our
part that we will not prove unworthy
of the priceless gift which we have
received. We are told that educa
tion is free; yet some one has had to
pay for it. It is thus incumbent upon
us to pay this debt back to society.
The ideals and spirit of this Uni
versity have been inculcated into us
until they have become a part of us.
Having been taught the value of
reality and the fruitlessness of pom
pous ceremony and idle action, we
should not simply sit on the side-lines
of life but mix in the heat of the fray.
Indeed, we would be unworthy of the
name of Stanford should we fail to
become great dynamic forces on the
side of civic righteousness, progress,
and humanity.
We have been inspired by that spirit
of broadmindedness which permeates
this whole institution. It has been
our privilege to become citizens of the
world; to look beyond the borders
of our own home, town, state, or na
tion; to include the whole globe with

in our scope. As college men and
women, we have seen the vision of the
world as a unit and have recognized a
common humanity in all races. It 3s
thus our duty to lead public opinion
in the right path and to tight against
prejudice, intolerance, and ignorance.
The doctrine of the Brotherhood of
Man is sure to triumph and the mem
