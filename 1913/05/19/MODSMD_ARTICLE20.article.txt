# PROFESSOR CLAPP ADDRESSES PHI BETA KAPPA ON GREEK STOIC
## DR. JORDAN READS POEM "IN THE WILDERNESS" IN WHICH HE DEPICTS THE HORRORS OF WAR. 
### 
Professor Edward Bull Clapp of the
University of California delivered an
address to the Phi Beta Kappa hon
orary society Friday afternoon, and
D:ivid Starr Jordan read the poem
entitled "In the Wilderness."
Professor Clapp's theme was the
philosophy of the Greek Stoic phil
osopher, Epictetus. This man was a
cripple and a slave but obtained his
freedom through the medium of his
philosophy. His teachings were that
man must be absolutely impervious 'o
all bodily pains, he must never com
plain, and be peevish. If the pains
and cares of the world should become
too heavy then there was a way out
of the strife and turmoil. That way
was suicide. He said that when the
time comes we are to do as Socrates.
He also believed and taught the
Christian teaching that we should not
retaliate when injured in anger by
fellow men.
Dr. Jordan's poem touched very
pathetically the horrors, sorrows and
futileness of war. He used the civil
war as his model and the battle of
The Wilderness as the specific case.
IN TIIE WILDEBNESS
I
1 stand as in a dream within a wood;
A forest crass, men call "The Wilderness,"
Of ill-grown oak trees and stunt, scanty
pines,
With sumacs, dun and huddling sassafras
Enmeshed with brambles rude and tangling
vines.
its mossy brooksides blue with violets,
Its red soil ever redder with men's hurt.
Men named this forest once "The Poisoned
Woods,"
And it was poisoned by the wrath of man,
T'was trebly poisoned by the flames of Hell
That burned ttirough every corner of the
wood.
Out from the forest, as in nightmare dream,
Out from its straggling trees and strugg
ling vines.
Out from its red soil, redder with men's
hurt,
Its ravaged bank-sides blue with violets,
From withering venoiw of its flames of
Hell,
I see a sad procession creeping down
Full seven miles of maimed and broken
men,
Full seven miles of ghastly shapes of men
Pour like a vomit from the Wilderness
Out from the pious shades of Salem
Church,
Out from the charcoal Furnace on the hill,
From sparse farm-houses saturate with
dread,
Field hospitals of gruesome awfulness,
Where women, war-crazed, neither know
nor recked
Of their own children if alive or slain.
From Sunlight's enfilade where Sedgwick
fell,
The Bloody Angle, by McCool's sweet
spring,
From the old roadside inn whose awful
name,
Men spoke in bated whispers—Chancel
lor svilie !
In its green paddock, leading toward the
ford
Of Rappahanock and of Rapidan,
Amidst the peach trees' rosy blossoming,
Among the white-washed shanties of the
slaves,
The ground was piled thrice deep with
wrecks of men
Living and dying—those which once were
men,
The Blue—the Red —commingled with the
Gray !
The blazing Inn an awesome funeral pyre.

Men tell us how the angry sun went down
A blood-shot disc upon a shrinking sky ;
And then uprose the great white Maytime
moon,
Flooding the forest with her patient light
Till Horror paled in dumb forgetfulness.
Shall we not ask in contrite humbleness
Can we give praise to Lord of Heaven, or
Hell.
For aught men did here in the wilderness?
II
Down in yon sombre hollow Jackson fell,
His red hand raised in worship, to the last,
Austere, devoted, of his Duty sure,
For States make Duty of the wrath of
man,
Imputing Righteousness to deeds abhorred.
"The soldier has no duty save to die."
And is this Duty that he thus should die?
Are nations built, on bones of mangled
men ? .
Have bonds of union no cement save
blood ?
"Obedience to the Law before all Time!"
But then is such obedience supreme,
Biought to fulfillment through red-handed
rage ?
"The brave makes Danger Opportunity."
Is there no danger save from cannonades?
Is there no hardier, craftier foe than this
Whose strength is measured by a sabre
thrust ?
The path to Justice between man and man
Must lead through strife, but not through
pools of blood;
The clash of will, but not the crush of men.
But war's fierce furnace melts the chains
of slaves;
Its march obliterates old vested wrongs;
Foul Bastiles crumble at its trumpet call,
And tyrants gasp at serried hosts of men.
War's candent fire-bath purifies the state,
War's furnace heat the bond of union
welds.
Shall not war bring the great Enfranchise
ment,
The freedom from all shackles of the Past?
He reaps dire harvest who sows dragon's
teeth !
When Law is silent, anarch murder rules;
Law is humanity's consummate flower.
And Love is the fulfillment of the Law.
Its blind and brute denial, that is War,
The Laws of War! In war, there is no
law,
Where war is not, there and there only—
Law.
Where armies quarter, thorns and thistles
grow.
New wrongs spring ever in the wake of
war,
From their red ashes mount up fresh
Bastilles ;
The Sutler camps on the Avenger's trail ;
Fine mailed Fist is but a burglar's tool;
< iross cities swell with loot of great cam
paigns,
The Vulture gorges where the F.agle
strikes.
And each fresh slaughter dwarfs the breed
of men
l"he Unreturning ever were the Brave!
Nothing enduring yet in wrath was
wrought ;
No noble deed in hatred: evermore
The Master Builder works in soberness :
A world which reeked with wars, and
and reeks again,
The Prince of Peace in patience recreates.
Oh, take away the frippery of war.
Its zest for glory, its mouth-filling lies.
Its rippling colors and resounding drums,
Its chargers, bannerets and bugle calls,
Its heady wine of music and acclaim
I hat make a slaughter seem a holiday!
Oh. take away the sanction of the State,
That haloes murder with a holy light.
That makes our common hate seem Wrath
Divine,
And thunderous shoutings as the voice of
God.

I do remember in the far-off years
Through the long twilight of the August
nights,
(The nights of half a century ago)
I waited for my brother, whom I loved, —
I waited for my brother, and he came, —
Came but in dreams and never came again,
For he was with the Sisterhood of Fate ;
Man is ; Man is not; Man shall never be.

How like a chasm yawns our history !
Still figures pour out from the Poisoned
Wood.
I seem to see them on their fated way,
I seem to see them creep from death to
death,
Full seven miles of crushed and wasted
men,
Full seven miles of tattered shreds of men,
Some dazed with blood, not knowing what
they do,
Rising to fall, and falling not to rise.
Whither they go—What matter? They
must go !
If there be ghosts, they hover o'er this
road;
If they be ghosts, they fill this Poisoned
Wood!
Perchance no spirits wander of the slain,
For these are sleeping in the woodland
glade,
The Blue for aye commingling with the
Gray.
Under that Flag where Hatred dies away
They rest as men may rest whose work is
done,
The Horror lost in blest forgetfulness.
For they are with the Sisterhood of Fate,
Man is; Man is not; Man shall never be.
Yet there be ghosts here, Ghosts that haunt
for Aye !
Rising forever from the Poisoned Wood,
The Slain Unnumbered; those who, still
unborn,
Through wistful ages never to be born,
Never may answer to their country's call;
The long, sad roll that lengthens with the
years.
The sweet life wasted, widening with the
years,
1 hose who have lived not, never yet can
live;
Their fathers slumber in the Wilderness,
While these are with the Sisterhood of
Fate,
Man is ; Man is not; Man shall never be.
Shall God not fill another universe
With Life we waste in wicked wantonness?
David Starr Jordan.
