# DR. BURDETTE PREACHES PERTINENT SERMON ON WEALTH
## STATELY MUSIC, IMPRESSIVE PRAYERS, AND STRONG ADDRESS HEARD BY BACCALAUREATE CONGREGATION. 
### 
Preaching more directly to the class
in cap and gown, yet preaching a
lesson pertinent to the lit'e of every
one of his auditors in the well-filled
Assembly Hall, the Rev. Robert W.
Burdette gave a powerful and mas
terly sermon at the Hacealaureate
services Sunday morning His text
was taken from the book of Habak
kuk, second chapter, first verse: "I
will stand upon my watch and set me
ui)on the tower, and will watch to
see what God will say unto me."
The address was delivered in an un
dowered yet eloquent style thai. held
the congregation by its simple and
homely force. Disparaging the emo
luments of wordly wealth and em
phasizing the necessity of treasuring
heavenly riches, the well-known prea
cher appealed to the graduating class
to watch and give ear to the words
of God that they might enrich their
souls and increase their wealth of
spiritual things for the enjoyment of
the spiritual life.
Impressive and appropriate pray
ers were said by the Rev. D. Chas.
Gardner in opening the services. The
Scripture Lesson was read by the
class president, I. I. Ingraham, and a
special prayer oflered by the gradu
ates for the University. A pleasing
solo and two well rendered anthems
added to the beauty of the ceremonial.
"There are two things which you
will tell me you are bound now to do
as you go out into the world—to make
»
a living and to live," stated Dr. Bur
dette in beginning his sermon. "The
second of these should be first for it is
more important that we should live
according to the precepts of Christ
and live happily in our afterlife than
that we should make a million in this
life. 'Seek ye first the Kingdom of
God.' The body does not last long;
neither is the mind immortal. The
mind may often succumb to disease
and die while a man's physical being
is yet strong. That divine spark that
God breathed into the first man alone
continues and is everlasting and to
the increase and benefit if it should
turn your energy.
Give
"I wish you no ill luck. I hope
that you will possess material pros
perity, that you will benefit by the
promises of God to his chosen people.
But the Lord Jesus brought a new
promise, a new teaching, that we
should give, always give, give, give.
These are not good business prin
ciples, but the principles of Jesus
never are such. He gave always and
garnered nothing. He gave no gold
but He gave life, healing, joy, and pro
mise. Material prosperity of itself is
not to he decried but it is not to be
made the god,—the chief thing of life.
"There was a popular melody a few
years ago whose burden took a great
hold on the American people. The
philosophy of the expression,—'Every
little bit added to what you've already
sot. just makes that little bit more' was
.that of the man who was grasping for
wealth, and more wealth, and more,
and more. But when such a man dies,

did you ever realize what a poor man
a dead man is. A dead horse is move
valuable than a dead man. Scrap
iron can be made from the horse's
shoes and glue from the hoofs and
bones. A dead man is a useless thing;
other people must even pay for his
funeral expenses.
"A Lazarus in the Kingdom of
God will have an accumulation of
spiritual wealth with the Father that
will, on the other hand, take millions
of years to spend. Men that live only
to make a million dollars starve their
souls and no man ever really lived
who starved his soul.
"Watch and See"
"There is a potency to the words
of the text 'watch' and 'see' that would
not be found in the mere expression
'look' and 'listen.' To know God and
what he says unto you, you must pos
sess the vision of the hearing, the
vision that a dog shows when he will
read in his master's eyes what he will
not trust to his ears to hear. We
cannot thus hear God when we are de
voted to other interests. He demands
our undivided attention. You must
forget everything save that by waiting
and watching you may know the Lord.
"We must climb, too, in order that
we may hear His words. 'I will set
me upon my tower.' You don't go
down into a gravel pit to get a broad
view. You climb and you must en
dure the difficult ascent. It is nothing
to climb, it is easy to run—both are
exhilirating. The hardest thing is to
walk, walk, walk, patient, enduring,
steady o'er desert plains, up dizzy
slopes. It is the endurance of walk
ing that will bring you to the Lord.
It must be an active endurance; not
the endurance of a wooden horse but
that of a thorough-bred animal, the
strength of the soul is superior to the
strength of the body. It is the strength
that kept the soul strong of the Christ
ian sirl that lay crunched in the jaws
of Nero's lions.
"Gods word, the Bible, preaches you
active endurance. The terminology
of the Scripture is that of the work
shop and the form. The New Tes
tament is a book of service, action,
and the battlefield, full of work, ac
tion, and activity. There is not one
moment of waste in the story All
action is calm and deliberate, a peace
ful activity from a peace that only God
can import into you. Even at the end,
the Christ is at his work, his service.
Even on the cross, he gives to the cri
minal at his side salvation and a king
dom.
"In God's name keep in touch with
him. In God's name keep care of your
spiritual life. There was a man who
met a woman beautiful beyond all des
cription and he loved her. Years af
ter. when he had forgotten her. cast
off from his life, he met the woman
again, decrepit, diseased, vice-streak
ed and he knew her then to be his
own soul. See that you do not cast
away your own soul. No man can do
your soul harm except yourself. Hear
God and you will keep your soul. Day
by day, watch and see what God wants
of thee."
