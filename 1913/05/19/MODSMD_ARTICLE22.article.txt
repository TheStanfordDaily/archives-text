thirty-five were given the Master of Arts Degree. In addition to these
the Academic Council also awarded three Engineer, thirteen .luris Doc
tor of Philosophy Degrees. The Co miuencemnet address preceded the
presenting of the sheepskins, *Th e Conquest of Europe by America,"
wsis the subject of the strong address delivered by Doctor Jordan.

I wish this morning to say a serious
word to you as citizens of the great
republic and as future leaders in its
thought and action. I wish you to
think earnestly of the part American
influence must play in the world his
tory of our century. It is for us to
help cure the accumulated evils of
the older civilization. Those men in
Europe who look furthest into the
future hope for the salvation of
Europe through ideals brought back
from practical service in America.
One of these. Senator La Fontaine of
Brussels, has given me my title as the
expression of the hope of his life,
"The Conquest of Europe by America."
I hasten to say that 1 do not mean
conquest by force of arms, for 1 have
no interest in such conquests and no
belief that victories thus won result in
any permanent good to any nation.
Nor do I mean financial conquests,
the floating of imperial loans or the
permeation of any part of European
business by financiers from the New
World. Still less do I celebrate a
shoppers' contest on the Place de
I'Opera or among the dazzling bar
gains of the Hon Marche. Nor does
the trail of American tourists who
cross with gold the palms of Europe's
servitors, all the way from Piccadilly
to the Pyramids awaken in me any
pride of nation or of race. The only
permanent conquest is that of ideas.
America stands, has always stood, for
two ideals from which she cannot
escape, for they are fundamental in
her origin and in her growth. These
are internationalism and democracy,
and these ideals being invincible
must conquer America, and through
her, reconquer Europe. And as both
are incompatible with war, their final
triumph marks the end of spoliation,
of and of that relation be
tween nations which breeds suspicion
and hatred. The conquest of the
world by the ideals of International
ism and Democracy marks the coming
of universal peace.
In the address at Baltimore in 1911,
Henri La Fontaine of Brussels, the
veteran prophet of International Life,
used these striking words.
"Emigration perhaps more than
war has deprived the old, historic
countries of their most energetic and
fittest ones to build the progressive
and wealthy people you are on this side
of the Atlantic. You are for us
Europeans, the beloved Brotherland,
Do not forget that Europe is always

and will still remain for you the be
loved Motherland. Europe is now for
America what Greece was for Europe.
Europe has liberated (Ireece. Amer
ica has to liberate Europe from its
burdens, its prejudices, its hatreds.
It is your duty, it is your highest duty
to reconcile outside your borders the
people you have reconciled within
your borders. For indeed the Amer
ican people is at present the true
international people. It is the elect
people which alone can further inter
nationalism and can transform all of
the people of the Earth into a family
of nations, a brotherhood of men, an
international people." "For coloniza
tion is not mainly done by men and by
capital, but also by ideas, by example,
by experiment."
Not Always True to Ideals
We may freely admit in the begin
ning that America has not always been
true to her own ideals, and that she
has not always clearly seen her own
future. She has had her own lapses,
moral and social, some of these be
cause of associations with Europe and
through imitation of glories alien to
her history. If she had been true to
herself she would never have known
a single foreign war. She has no part in
those greeds and jealousies of money
or of race which still keep up turmoil
in Europe. Her war with Spain with
its eagerness for exploitation, its
tinsel imperialism and its pride of
participation in "world politics" rep
resents the worst of these lapses, and
its evil effects are long in passing.
But though the inception of this affair
was European in method, its contin
uance has been characteristically
American. Instead of exploitation, we
have brought to the Philippines educa
tion and sanitation. We have expend
ed on them a hundred times what we
have received, and if ever imperilism
can be respectable we have made it so.
Another false movement has been
in the building of warships and forts
in America. This lacks the motive
for similar extravagances in Europe,
because the peace of the new world is
no where threatened. But with us as
everjwhere the military spirit grows
with the money spent on it. The more
mouths fed by the State the greater
the clamor for the feeding of still
more. We have also to reckon with
the desire for giant decoration, for
big navies for sheer bigness' sake, the
feeling that this is the richest and'
most progressive nation on the globe,

and that as such she can beat old
Europe at her own game even though
that game be not worth the candle.
But with all lapses and delinquin
cies the fact of internationalism and
the ideal of democracy have been and
must always remain with the United
States, and from the United States
these ideals will react with greater
and greater force on the thoughts and
deeds of Europe.
Internationalism is the heritage of
America, not of choice at first, but cf
necessity. She has perforce grown
up with this ideal, because no other
was possible. She became the cosmo
politan nation of the world because
of her complex origin and with this
origin she could be nothing else. In
a new civilization, in the struggles of
the frontier each man is rated for
what he is worth. Under these condi
tions no one cares for the petty pre
cedences of rank or race. What a
man can do in the next twenty-four
hours outvalues any question as to
who were his ancestors.
All Hate Dies
On a railway train not long ago
some one was overheard to say: "This
is the land where all hate dies. My
father was German; my mother was
French. What do I care for all that?
I am an American. The old hatreds
and rivalries are nothing to me."
America was English, first. In lang
uage, in spirit, in conscience and in
government it is England which domi
nates. For the English race, above
all others, with its adaptation for co
operation and for compromise is the
builder of free states.
It was the chosen among the Eng
lishmen of three centuries ago who
founded the germ colonies of Virginia
and Massachusetts May. In the fol
lowing years it has been the like
minded from their own nation and
from others who have crossed the seas
to enter into their work.
The first who came were the bold,
the free, the self-ruling, the pleasure
scorning element of English life. They
came to escape from the state
church and the church-state, that they
might worship in their own fashion
and according to dictates of their indi
vidual consciences.
They detested the law of primogeni
ture which thrust the spirit of pre
cedence into the bosom of every fam
ily. They abhorred the law of entail
which burdened the land with the
curse of privilege even to unborn gen
erations.
They had caught from France the

spirit of liberty, equality, fraternity,
but as befits the calmer blood of the
north, they gave this spirit a con
structive interpretation, and the idea
of equality was to them especially rich
in practical results. Equality before
the law, equal access to land, to edu
cation, to professions and trades,
. equal access to legislat ion, each of
these conceptions broadened out into
the spirit of democracy.
And after England came to other
nations of Europe, each with its own
part and in its own degree giving its
contingent of free-born men, the ad
| mixture of blood gave strength and
! versatility to the rising nation.
But withal, the dominant note is
English still, with as many diver-
I gences from the England of today as
j from the England of the Stuarts.
In later years other immigration has
come, not alone the bold in search of
adventure, of new homes and new free
doms, but the weak and the oppressed,
"the beaten men of the beaten races,"
who llee from war taxation in search
of living wages and of daily bread.
But all these are cast into the same
melting pot and in most of them there
arises a clear response to the call of
free institutions.
In this melting pot of America, all
the old racial antipathies disappear
and all hereditary hatreds. There is
110 final distinction of British or Ger
j man, of French or Italian, of Spanish
|or Slav, of Dutch or Scandinavian,
!or of Jew or Gentile. The average
| American is as cosmopolitan in origin
j and relationship as is royalty in
Europe, though for a different set of
| reasons. But in America there is 110
[ distinction of common or noble, of
high or low, of aristocracy, bour
j geoisie or proletariat except as these
| are artificially emphasized in the in
dustrial strife we have inherited from
Eu rope.
To the international mind of Amer
ica, there seems 110 need or pertinence
to an Anglo-Saxon alliance as against
any other people. In so far as such
alliance is desirable or humanly pos
sible it exists already in a common
sympathy and a common literature, ft
would lie weakened by a stated agree
ment of the Anglo-Saxon group to
swell each others Meets with dread
naughts. The true bond of Union of
the Greater Britain involves no rup
ture with the Greater Germany, or the
Greater France or the Greater Scandi
navia to which we in America likewise
claim allegiance.
To the American, "Pan-Germanism,"
Pan-Slavism," as lie hears these ex
