Today marks the passing of the Class
of Nineteen Hundred and Thirteen

from the ranks of the Stanford
Student Body. After four
years of work and pleasure on

the Farm we pack our trunks and
scatter to the far ends of the earth.
As Stanford students we cea?e to tie
but we are and always will be Stan
ford men and women, and as such it
will be our earnest endeavor to make
the University as proud of us as we
are proud of being Stanford grad
uates.
As undergraduates the Class of 1913
has shown itself to be one of the best
classes that has ever entered the
University. Throughout their college
course the members of this class
have been foremost in all activities
that would in any way bring credit to
Stanford and on joining the list of
alumni the same idea will prevail.
University that can be of greater serv
ice than the Alumni Association, and
the strength of this organization de
pends upon the members getting to
gether, with themselves and with the
undergraduates. The time for gather
ing is when we are all free from
work and worry and this can best lie
done in Commencement Week. During
the past four years we have seen
Senior Week evolve from a mere
formal presentation of diplomas to an
event that, means something to both
young and old. Each class has
profited by the experience of the
Commencement. Week up to its proper
place. This cannot he done in one
year, or two or three. Like all other
things that are to endure, it takes
time to develop it. The completion of
the Stanford Union and the Woman's
Clubhouse is a great step toward the
perfection of Senior Week.
As Alumni it is Thirteen's first am
bition to help make the Stanford
Senior Week, the equal to the Com
mencements of our eastern contem
poraries. Then, and not until then,
will the Stanford Alumni Association
become the power that it should be
and that Stanford needs.
