# Token of Esteem Presented to Martin.
## 
### 
As a token of the esteem in which
the student body holds Professor E.
W. Martin for his untiring efforts in
organizing and keeping alive one of
the finest military bands west of the
Mississippi, the Executive Committee
has presented him with an ivory-gold
mounted baton. It bears the engrav
ing "E. W. Martin, from The Associ
ated Students of Stanford University,
May, 1913." This was voted by the
Executive Committee to be given to
Professor Martin as an expression
of gratitude of both the Committee and
the Student Body.
Four years ago the band was a dis
grace and did not deserve the name of
a musical organization. In the past
four years Professor Martin has taken
hold of it and raised it from the pitfall
until today it is a pleasure to hear,
an organization of thirty-five pieces.
Many times during the present college
generation the band would have fallen
to pieces , but Professor Martin has
held it together through his personal
interest in its welfare and through
the capable leadership which he lias
demonstrated.
