# WORK TO BE BEGUN ON STANFORD UNION AND WOMEN'S CLUBHOUSE
## Preliminary Plans are Completed. Plot Between Postoffice and Engineering Building is Site. 
### 
As was announced in the last regu
lar issue of The Daily Palo Alto, the
time of actual building of the Stan
ford Union and the Women's Club
house, long looked forward to, has
arrived. Unless the plans of the direc
tors of the two projects miscarry, the
men and women in college next year
will enjoy the benefits, denied to the
members of '13, of common meeting
places in which all have equal rights
of proprietorship. The preliminary
plans for the two buildings, facing
an enclosed patio, on the plot between
the postoffice and the Engineering
buildings, have been completed to the
satisfaction of the committees in
charge, and at the present time more
detailed plans and specifications are
being prepared in order that bids may
be called for at an early date and
construction begun.
The directors of both the Union and
the Clubhouse are determined not to
open their buildings encumbered wi'b
debts the interest on which would
add to the running expense of the
houses, necessitate high dues and
thereby in part defeat the purpose of
having these buildings open to all,
with none barred by reason of the
cost. The Union has on hand now a
little more than $23,000 in cash and
the Clubhouse a little more than
$12,000, slightly less than one-half the
sum being sought in each case. This
fear of incurring debt has been the
•chief cause for not beginning the build
ings before this.
Now, however, these promises will
be put to the test. Building will be
begun at once, and if the money is
forthcoming, it will be pushed to im
mediate conclusion. The directors are
still as firmly determined as ever not
to open either building with a debt
over it. Each organization, therefore,
has announced its intention of build
ing just as far as the money in hand
will pay for, and then, if there is not
•enough money to pay for a com
pleted building, stopping at the point
where the funds give out. The con
struction will be of re-enforced con
crete, and if the event should unfor
tunately make it necessary the build
ings can be halted at any point and re
main without deterioration until it is
possible to resume.
No wordy argument for the immedi
ate payment of pledeges is needed,
once the situation is realized. No man
cr wvman who has been on the campus
bince the twin projects were broached
needs to be told of the intense desire
•of all to see the Union and the Club
house available for the good work
they will accomplish. When it was
found that the annual reception by
President and Mrs. Jordan would be
impossible this year, they desired to
spend the money that would have sone
to this purpose in gome way that would
serve somewhat the same end. As a
result of a moment's thought, he
turned over to the Union his check for
one hundred dollars.
All men who are eager to see the
Union a fact owe a debt of gratitude
to Ambrose, Chandler and Ingraham
for their efforts. Secretary E. W.
