### 
On Sunday afternoon, members of
the graduating class repaired to Palo
Alto to continue the custom that has
been established by former Senior
classes of planting ivy in memory of

observed "at the Old Saint's church,
where at half-past four o'clock the
Seniors planted ivy in the grounds
surrounding the building.
