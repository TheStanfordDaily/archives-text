# SENIOR ALUMNI RECEPTION PROVES INFORMAL SUCCESS
## 
### 
The informal Senior-Alumni recep
tion held in Encina club room on Sat
urday evening was one of the most
pleasant and enjoyable informal affairs
of the week. Its very informality was
an addition to the pleasure of the even
ing and brought forcefully to the
minds of both alumni and seniors the
contrast between like functions in
other universities and at Stanford.
The reception was open to the en
tire University public for the second
time in Stanford history, last year be
ing the first. The classes of '03, '08,
'11, and '12 were most in evidence, and
the renewal of friendships of old, new,
and neargrads marked a fitting end
to one of the most successful Alumni
Days at Stanford.
The reception committee consisted of
Misses L. Rider, C. Madison, M. Mc-
Clurg, M. L. Walton, and Messrs. L.
Cass, W. C. Hammon, J. S. Grepe, C.
S. Turpin, S. F. Pellas, Miss I. Bullis,
