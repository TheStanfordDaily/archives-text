The Class of 1913 evolved a pleas
ant idea when they donated a large
"Stanford Alumni Register" to the
University. The volume contains one
thousand spacious pages, measuring
It") by 12 inches, and is tastefully
bound in a durable grade of pigskin.
The lists are arranged alphabetic
ally, and visiting alumni as well as
retiring undergraduates are asked to
add their signatures to the great Toll.
which provides space for the date,
name, home address, and occupation
and business address.
No definite place for its being kept
has yet been decided upon, but the
book will be taken to all alumni func
tions, especially during Senior Week.
The register will enable alumni to
keep informed as to the whereabouts
of their former college friends.
