# NEW POLICY OF TRUSTEES MEANS ERA OF EXPANSION
## NEW LIBRARY WILL REPLACE BUILDING RAZED BY TEMBLOR 
### 
In preparation for the immediate
construction ot' a new library build
ing to replace the structure destroyed
in the earthquake of 1906, George T.
Clark, University Librarian, is tour
ing the eastern states with the idea
of getting plans from tlie various large
libraries to be used in arranging the
new Stanford building. The new
library will be capable of holding a
million volumes. It will be modern in
every respect. The probable site of
the structure is the plot of ground
opposite the English building along
the walk to Encina and Lasuen street.
Clark expects to visit many of the
most recently constructed library
buildings in the East. He is to pay
special attention to the lighting and
shelving details. The plans of sev
eral new libraries now in contem
plation are to be available for inspec
tion by the Stanford librarian. The
new Widner library at Harvard is
among the book repositories which
will be inspected.
Monthly Additions
The Stanford library contains at
the present time about 200,000 vol
umes. Additions to the number of a
thousand volumes are added each
month. The money for the purchase
of the new books is derived from a
special $500,000 fund known as the
Jewel Fund. This was created in a
large part by the sale of Mrs. Jane L.
Stanford's jewels. There is an an
nual income of $1!5,000 from this sum
of money. Before her death Mrs.
Stanford expressed a wish that her
jewels be sold and the money set
aside for the purchase of books. This
wish was carried out by the Board of
Trustees.
Modern Appliances
The new library building is to be
equipped with all the latest appliances
for the handling of books and library
accessories. It will probably be lo
cated with the view to making it the
possible corner structure of an en
tirely new Quadrangle as the growth
of the University may necessitate m
the future.
Since the announcement of the new
policy of the Trustees Librarian
Clark has been engaged in studying
plans for the new structure. Before
coming to Stanford Clark undertook a
similar mission for the city of S;in
Francisco, where he was labrarian of
the San Francisco Public Library. He
will be absent several weeks.
