Twenty-two years ago the Daily
Palo Alto first made its entrance into

the field of news
paperdom. To
day's issue thus
becomes No. 1 of
Volume 43. Like

our predecessors we have long cher
ished a desire to do something which
would make our tenure in the editorial
chair just a little distinctive. A lar
ger paper has been the dream of
those who have had a part in the edit
ing of the paper but due to our pecul
iar geographical situation away from
te center of greater business activi
ties it has been found impossible from
a financial standpoint to increase our
space limits. We will, therefore, in
stitute no radical changes during the
present semester. All the news that's
fit to print will be handled by our
staff. It will be our aim to cover
everything of interest to alumni, for
mer students as well as campus resi
dents, and to publish an early edition.
At times it will be necessary to stray
from our resolutions of earliness, but
we crave indulgence from our read
ers, especially during the first few
days of the semester.
The Daily Palo Alto is the Student
Body organ and as such devotes its
news columns to the students. We
reserve the right to claim for our own
this particular section of the paper,
while in the adjacent space our com
municants are especially welcomed.
It will be our policy to devote our en
ergies to the furtherance of the best
interests of Stanford, both in the uni
versity and abroad.
