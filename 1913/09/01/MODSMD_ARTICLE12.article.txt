# Problems Ahead.
## 
### 
As the shadows of approaching
events cast before us we think of what
is ahead of us during the present
semester. Student Control after a
year's successful is yet in its infancy.
Whether the system succeeds or fails
depends upon the students. Thus far
it has been demonstrated that the sys
tem is a success. The men and women
of the university can make or unmake
their government. It is up to them.
Athletically, we cannot refrain from
becoming enthusiastic. With the mem
ory of last year's victories fresh in
our minds we entertain hopes for an
other season of prosperity on the
field of sport.
Scholastically, indications point to
an advancement in the already high
standard of educational opportunity
offered at Stanford. New blood has
been added o the teaching staff and
the strengthening process outlined by
the trustees is beginning to bear
fruit. Rearrangement of the courses
given in the past has been carried out

by various departments and the curri
culum has been revised along the lines
of particular efficiency
After several years' effort the Stan
ford Union and the Women's Club
house are soon to be a reality. The
site has been selected and plans have
been drawn for the structures. Within
a month actual construction should
begin.
There is much to be accomplished.
We are here to do our share toward
making this year an epoch in the
Golden Age of Stanford.
