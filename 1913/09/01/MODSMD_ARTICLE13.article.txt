# Chancellor Jordon
## 
### 
To provide Doctor Jordan with the
liberty necessary for his greatest use-

fulness to Stanford
the Board of Trustees
created for him the
post of Chancellor of

the university. The position is unique
in the history of American universi
ties. In his new office Chancellor
Jordan will devote his mind in the
larger duties toward the university
and toward the public.
For twenty-two years Chancellor
Jordan has been the master mind
which has made possible the develop
ment of Stanford as one of the leading
educational seats in the world. When
the late Senator Stanford cast about
for a president to head his new west
ern university David Starr Jordan
was the man to whom was given the
gigantic task of materializing the
dream of the founders of Stanford; of
moulding the raw materials into a
reality; of attracting young men, des
tined later to become leaders in edu
cational fields, into the faculty, and of
framing the ideals which have come to
be recognized as the "Stanford Spirit."
Chancellor Jordan has accomplished
his task well. lie has faced problems
which would have caused a smaller
man to give up. Pew will ever know
the difficult situations which present
ed themselves in the early days of the
university while the endowment fund
was tied up in legal proceedings fol
lowing Senator Stanford's death. For
months the fate of the new univer
sity was in the balance. Then fol
lowed difficulties while the university
was yet in its infancy. When Stan
ford was well on along in its devel
opment stage came the disastrous
earthquake of 1906 with its attendent
damage, totalling thousands of dol
lars.
It has been Chancellor Jordan who
has directed the university through
its transitional stage, and now as
Stanford is just past its majority it is
fitting that he should be given a
greater freedom to exercise his use
fulness. David Starr Jordan has be
come a world figure, grappling with
problems of national and international
import; doing a great work in the
cause of world arbitration; devoting
his energies to the betterment of man
kind. His sphere of interest has long
since ceased to be bounded by the con
fines of Stanford University, his own
state, or his native land. He is a citi
zen of the world whose only limita
tion of interest is humanity. Posteri
ty will remember David Starr Jordan
as a scholar, scientist, writer, lecturer,
teacher of men, a humanitarian and
the maker of a university.
