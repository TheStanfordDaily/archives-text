During the summer recess the Board of Trustees of the university start
led the educational world by the announcement of an entirely new policy
hy which they expect to apply business principles to the management of
the university expansion and to set new standards of learning among the
universities and colleges of the United States. The most notable features
of the new policy are the erection of a new library and a new gymnasium
on the campus; the erection of a woman's hospital in Sim Francisco as
a part of the Medical School and the enlargement of the facilities and
staff of the Medical School; limitation on tiie number of students; and the
elevation of the departments now contained in the university curriculum,
instead of the addition of more departments.
The professional schools of the university are to be built up to class with
the best in the country; research work is to be made a feature of the pure
science departments, and additional strength is to be given the English,
History and Economics departments... The era of progress is to begin im
mediately. Already plans are beingexamined for the Library building.
The Gymnasium may be turned overto the Student Body to conduct as th
ey do the athletics. This proposition will be submitted as early as possible.
The announcement of the changes in the policy of governing the uni
versity followed soon after the elevation of l)r. Jordan to the post of Chan
cellor and the promotion of Dr. Branner to the presidency.. Chancellor
Jordan is to be absent for a year on leave. He is devoting his time to the
propagation of the world peace idea and is now in Europe. Later he will
visit Australia on university business. President Branner, after twenty
two years of service to Stanford, is already engaged in administering his
duties as executive head of the university.
