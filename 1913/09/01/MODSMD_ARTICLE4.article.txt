# TRUSTEES TO LIMIT NUMBER OF STUDENTS
## Change Is In Line With Policy of Raising Standards of Institution. 
### 
As announced by the Board of Trus
tees in outlining the new policy which
is to guide them in directing the af
fairs of the university a limitation is
to be placed on the number of men
students permitted to register. The
definite limitation has not yet been
definitely settled. It is probable that
the total male registration allowable
until more funds are available for the
use of the various departments will be
in the neighborhood of 1300.
This limitation is intended to go
toward the working out of the policy
of increasing standards of the depart
ments rather than increasing the
number of departments. It is planned
to make a special effort to admit those
students into the professional schools
who have special qualifications as to
character, as well as experience and
accomplishment. The aim of the Trus
tees in making this radical change is
to select men primarily with a view
to the promise they give of being able
to profit most through the highly spe
cialized training which the university
will offer.
The number of women students was
long ago fixed at half a thousand.
This has resulted in a large number
of women entering from other institu
tions with advanced standard. It has
been announced however that the pro
posed limitation is in no way in line
with the much discussed Junior Col
lege idea.
