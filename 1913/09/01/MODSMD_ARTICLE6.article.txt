## Trustees to Take Action Upon the Return of H.C. Hoover from the East. 
### 
Plans for the new gymnasium to be
erected on Stanford Field are still in
the tentative form. Professor C. B.
Wing, who was empowered by the
board of trustees to make the pre
liminary arrangements for the con
struction of the new structure, stated
yesterday that no plans had yet been
drawn. It is proposed to locate the
new gymnasium near the present
football field, where tlie swimming fa
cilities can be used by the athletes
using the fields rt is also planned to
turn the management of the building
over to the student body. A proposal
will probably be made shortly to tne
executive committee. The new gym
will not contain much space under
roof, thus allowing plenty of out-of
door exercise.
No action will probably be taken
until the return of Trustee Herbert C.
Hoover, '95, from the east.
