# UNIVERSITY WILL SET STANDARD OF COLLEGIATE EDUCATION
## 
### 
Stanford is to be an institution that
will set standards of collegiate edu
cation. This is the decision of the
Board of Trustees of the University.
The whole of the resources of the uni
versity foundation are to be devoted
to the existing branches of study.
No new departments will be added or
new work pursued until the most im
portant of the present departments
have become preeminent among such
departments in the United States. The
trustees believe that the resources of
the university justify in the future an
increase in the annual sum allotted
to academic work and are sufficient
to extend and improve the most im
portant of these departments. The
growing body of alumni are looked
to as an indication of ultimate further
financial support to the university
which will enable the expansion of
the university into other fields.
Teaching ltnngc
The present teaching range cover
ing law, medicine, engineering, educa
tion chemistry, geology, physics, zoo
logy, botany, history, economics, En
glish, literature, philosophy, psycho
logy, mathematics, classic and modern
languages and literature, will be
maintained. The standards in each
branch of study are to be placed on a
level with the leading special schools
in each branch of education.
Although the general endowment of
the university seems large, there is
a great amount of unproductive assets
included in the endowment. Grad
ually these are being made to yield
an income sufficient to carry out the
work that the trustees have planned
and to maintain the policy of cen
tralized expansion which they have
decided upon. With the completion in
the near future of various repairs
necessitated by the earthquake of 1906
additional funds will be available.
Each year a sum of $100,000 has been
devoted to rehabilitation.
The medical school is one of the
first departments of instruction to be
given consideration. An increased ex
pansion of both the teaching and hos
pital facilities has already been be
gun. A new women's hospital in San
Francisco and the renovation of the
present hospital building in San Fran
cisco with the addition of a substan
tial wing for private patients are soon
to be erected.
