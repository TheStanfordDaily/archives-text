# CHANCELLOR JORDAN SENDS FIRST LETTER TO STANFORD PUBLIC
## Letter to Daily Palo Alto Reviews Visit in England and Outlines Continental Travel 
### 
Devoting his time to the spread of
the movement for world peace, Chan
cellor Jordan is now traveling on the
Continent, being absent from his uni
versity duties on a year's leave. He
has attended various peace confei
ences during his stay in Europe, and
plans to visit the Balkans, Alsace Lor
raine, Spain, Italy, Russia, Australia
and the Orient before returning to
Stanford. He is to give more than
twenty lectures in the British Isles
after his stay on the Continent.
As a welcoming message to the
Student Body, Chancellor Jordan has
forwarded an interesting account of
his travels to the Editor of the Daily
Palo Alto. The letter, dated Arton, te,
France, August 10, follows:
"I regard it as one of the pleasant
duties of my wandering office to make
a monthly report of my doings to
'The Daily Palo Alto.' We landed at
London 011 July 7, and were promptly
met by our honored and übiquitous
trustee, Mr. Herbert C. Hoover and
Mrs. Hoover, and for a month we en
joyed their hospitality at the Red
House 011 Hornton street, known and
beloved of all Stanford folks who go
to Europe, and also at their summer
home, the Dower House at Stratford
on-Avon. We record two automobile
trips across England in two direc
tions, to see what rural England is
doing, the one to Lincoln in the north
east, the other to Jordan in Devon en
the southwest.
"In the interest of the peace of na
tions I spoke to the Eugenics Society
and their friends in the parlor of the
Duchess of Marlborough, and to Ihe
American women in London in the
parlors of the Savoy. No bricks were
thrown at either place. I also spoke
to the American men in London, but
that was in secret session at the Sa
voy and no reporters were present.
"For the sake of vanity, I spoke In
Paris before a religious congress on
The Federation of Europe, and at
Ghent before a congress of school di
rection on 'World Peace and the
Treaty of Ghent'. Later 1 have a
regular peace campaign in England
and Scotland, but the time to describe
this is after it comes off. In London
—naturally at the Red House, we met
Professor Woodward, Professor Stu
art and Mr. Brooks. Next week Pro
fessor Guerard joins 11s for a tour of
Alsace-Lorraine. The attempt to
Germanize these provinces continued
for fifty years, makes the people con
tinually dissatisfied. They do not
want war, but they want equality,
French schools, as well as German
schools, and with freedom to run their
own affairs. Half the trouble in Eu
rope would vanish if Aisace and Lor
raine were allowed the privilege as to
languages and ways that Saxony and
Hanover enjoy. The same complaint
arises from Polish Germany and from
Danish Germany. The people cling to
their old ways and their own language
because the government tries to force
something on them.
"This is the plea of Alsace:
" 'Since you have taken us by force,
you owe us a legal status, a consti
tution, political find civil harmony
without traditions, our manners and
our customs.'
"We leave tomorrow for the peace
congress at The Hague, and later for
the Balkans where all kinds of 'awful
example' useful in our business has
been shown to the world within the
year,
"The classes are now gathering
again at Stanford. It makes us home
sick to think of it all. We are always
homesick when we cross the borders
of California. No nicer folks any
where than gather at the farm!
"Sincerely yours,
"DAVID STARR JORDAN."
