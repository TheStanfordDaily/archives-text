# A 						Summer In the Orient
## 
### 
A record of a baker's dozen victories
out of a total of twenty games played

besides pleasant mem
ories of a wonderful
trip are a part- of the

non-dutiable possess
ions brought back from the Orient by
eleven Stanford representatives who
journeyed six thousand miles over sea
to meet the best exponents of Uncle
Sam's own national pastime. Stan
ford's sportsmanship and gentlemanly
conduct received ample commendation
everywhere. The men of the Orient
proved gracious hosts during the stay
of the Cardinals and the team mem
bers feel grateful for the many courte
sies shown them during the tour. We
hope that the visit of the Stanford
players must cement a friendly feel
ing with our eastern contemporaries.

Cornmendation for the success of the
tour belongs to Captain Terry for the
playing details; to Graduate Manager
Wilcox, who controlled the exchequer;
to the players and citizens of .la
pan and Hawaii, who looked to the en
tertainment of the visitors, and to Stan
Kennedy, and the Stanford men in the
Islands who arranged the stay in
Aloha-land.
