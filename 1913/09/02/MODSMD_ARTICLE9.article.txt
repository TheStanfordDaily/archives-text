Informally the customary under
class rush was anticipated last even-

ing by a selected gath
ering of rivals from
the Sophomore and
Freshmen classes. Un-

der class rivalry is as old as higher
education. In American alma maters
it has become traditional that the in
coming students must receive atten
tion at the hands of their year older
brothers. At Stanford whenever Red
meets Green in the first days of the
college year there is a clash. A repe
tition of last evening's affray may re
occur before truce is declared with
Thursday's tying contest. Consider
able damage resulted to university
property last evening. Perhaps this
was due to the exuberance of youth.
But in any case it is well for the up
perclassmen to impress strongly upon
the rivals that property must be re
spected. Warning should be given
that whatever damage is done must be
paid for by the unfortunate individ
uals or classes who transgress beyond
the bonds of reasonableness.
