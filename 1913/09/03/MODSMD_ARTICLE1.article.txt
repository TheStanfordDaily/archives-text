# DEATH CALLS PROFESSOR OF POLITICAL SCIENCE
## BURT ESTES HOWARD DIES IN LOS ANGELES HOME Incessant Work Brings Fatal Illness To Well Known Worker In Municipal Problems 
### 
Burt Estes Howard, Professor of
Political Science in the Economics de
partment of Stanford, died at bis Los
Angeles home at 11 o'clock on the night
of July 10. While Dr. Howard has been
in poor health for some time, his de
mise was unexpected, nothing serious
being seen in his condition until a
week before his death. Too incessant
work on his new book, "Emperor Wil
liam II", is believed to have contrib
uted materially to the breakdown pre
ceding his death.
Dr. Howard was a member of the
Stanford faculty at various intervals
since 1900. From 1900 to 1901 he had
the title of Assistant Professor of Po
litical Science and was then advanced
to acting Associate Professor, which
position he relinquished in 1902 to go
abroad for advanced work. On his re
turn to the university staff Dr. How
ard became dean of the Department of
Political Science. He occupied this
place from 1908 until the time of his
death.
Graduating from Western Reserve
University in 1883, Dr. Howard went
to Lane Theological Seminary and
was ordained as a Presbyterian minis
ter three years later. He became pas
tor of the First Presbyterian church
in Los Angeles in 1592 and occupied
that pulpit for five years. He then
preached in the Church of the Cove
nant for two years, coming to Stan
ford for the first time from that
church.
After studying at the University of
Heidelberg for a year Dr. Howard be
came a Doctor of Philosophy. Dur
ing 1903-4 he did advanced work at
the University of Berlin. On his re
turn to California, the First Unitarian
church in Los Angeles became the
pastorate of Dr. Howard's endeavors,
this being the last pulpit which he oc
cupied before accepting the call to
Stanford.
While in Germany Dr. Howard was
busy on his manuscript "Des Ameri
kanische Burgerrecht", and "The Ger
man Empire". His thorough knowl
edge of municipal problems made his
books authorities in the schools of the
Fatherland. In addition to numerous
articles and short stories which he
contributed to the magazines and
press of the country, "Democracy and
Education", written in 1901, and "The
Shepherd's Question", in 1906, are left
as memorials of his literary ability.
At the time of his death Dr. Howard
was working on the manuscript "Wil
liam II". This was to have been his
best effort and would have undoubted
ly caused marked comment in the field
of literature.
A widow, two sons, Grenville and
Graeme, and a daughter, Miss Emily
Howard, '16, survive Dr. Howard.
