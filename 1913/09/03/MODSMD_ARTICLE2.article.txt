With the registration yesterday of
much promising material among the
newcomers to the campus, and the ap
pearance today of five veterans of last
year's contest in the mud and rain,
the sport of Rugby again comes into
its own and Stanford Field becomes
the hub of the universe to the Cardi
nal fans.
The players who fought the Blue
and Gold fifteen to a tie last fall and
have returned for another year are:
Captain J. H. Thoburn, '13, F. J.
Gard, '14, W. P. Darsie, '14, E. B. Hall,
'14, and J. C. Urban, '16. Seven of the
1912 substitutes are to be included in
the Rugby squad: L. C. Decius, '13, E.
L. Peck, '13, F. W. Reeves, '14, F. B.
Watkins, '14, P. P. Clover, '14, H. W.
Andrews, '14, and A. Erb, *15.
The return of star players in both
the scrum and backfield, eligible to
compete another year, is particularly
encouraging, and the prospects for
success throughout the two months

schedule of games are bright. In the
front rank E. B. Hall, a 1912 veteran,
will again head the scrum, while L. C.
Decius and E. L. Peck are experienced
players who will make a strong fight
for the varsity berth. Watkins, the
giant middleranker, is expected to
register tomorrow. For the breaka
way positions there is a world of ma
terial, as both Gard and Darsie are
registered, with Clover, last year's
substitute, as a strong rival.
New Material
In the backfield squad will be Cap
tain Thoburn, Urban, Andrews, Erb,
Reeves, and other fast and experi
enced players. And it is in this de
partment, perhaps, that the new ma
terial will show to best advantage.
In D. B. Carroll, '16, Stanford has an
exceptionally strong and speedy wing
or center. Carroll came to California
with the Australian Waratahs last
October, and after playing with that
fast fifteen through their schedule re
mained on the Pacific Coast. He
registered in January.
Among the first year men who will
tryout on the Rugby field this season
is Charlie Austin, former Berkeley
High and Boone's Academy player,
who was the first five in the All Star
fifteen chosen to meet the Waratahs
in a final game. Others who come to
Stanford with a prep school reputa
tion are Pettingill, of Los Angeles,
Maurer, of Belmont, Lachmund, Dav
idson, and Huttmann, of Palo Alto.
Scott, of Santa Barbara, and Mc-
Euwen, of Pasadena.
The first practice has been set fo>
Saturday. The suits will be given to
players on Friday afternoon, at the
football training house. The first
work will be of a light character, un
der the direction of Coach Floyd
Brown. Advisory Coach George Pres
ley is expected on the campus each
week end during the season.
