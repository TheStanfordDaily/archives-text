# FIRST RUGBY RALLY COMES TOMORROW
## 
### 
Mounting the table in Encina club
room at 7:30 Thursday evening Ad
visory Coach George J. Presley will
again make the "keynote speech" of
the football season. Five other talks
by favorite speakers, together with
free smokes and the good old Stanford
songs and yells, will be on the bill at
this, the first "pep-producer" of the
year. The complete list of speakers
follows: Advisory Coach George J.
Presley, Professor Frank J. Angell,
Chairman of the Faculty Committee
on Athletics, "Dad" Moulton, Stan
ford's track coach, Rugby Trainer
Harry W. Maloney, Field Coach Floyd

C. Brown, '11, and Captain J. H. Tho
burn, '13.
It is the intention of the Varsity
yell leaders, who will preside at this
rally, to make it short and full of life
in an unusual degree. For this reason
the number of speakers has been kept
to a limit of six. This will give oppor
tunity for the expected large number
of football candidates to sign up at
the conclusion of the rally. This list
will be worked over by Coach Brown
on Friday, suits will be distributed to
the candidates on Friday afternoon,
and the first Rlugby workout is set for
Saturday.
