# DRAMATIC ACTIVITIES OF SEMESTER UNDER WAY
## TWO SOCIETIES ARE PREPARING STAGE PRODUCTIONS Sword and Sandals Will Put on Problem Play; Ram's Head in Burlesque 
### 
Dramatic activity is being wakened
early in the semester by Ram's Head
and Sword and Sandals societies. An
original musical production by Ram's
Head will be staged October 18, and
Sword and Sandals will likely put on
"The Servant in the House" Septem
ber 26 or a week later.
J. H. Forbes, '13, has written the
scenario for the Ram's Head extrava
ganza, and will remain on the campus
several weeks to see rehearsals well
under way. The music scores are the
joint achievement of W. S. Wilson, '13,
J. L. McDonald, ex-'l4, and E. E.
Chase, ex-'ll, and represent some of
the best talent of the composers, who
are all closely connected with Stan
ford song history.
The scenario is not quite completed
and the nature of the story will be
kept secret, as was "Rambling Ra
meses" last year. The setting will be
in Hawaii.
Fred Carlyle, of San Francisco,
manager and coach of the society, will
come to the campus tomorrow to be
gin work on the production. Tryouts
for parts, which will all be taken by
men, will be open to all men students.
The call for contestants will be made
in a week or so, and selections will
follow an elimination tryout of two
weeks' work.
Sword and Sandals Choose Drama
"The Servant in the House" is in
preparation for the latter part of
September. A hold-up in plans has
been caused by uncertainty as to
whether W. B. Owen, '14, will register
this semester. He is cast for the lead,
and Coach Frank Mathieu, who will
be in charge is assigning the other
parts. An announcement of the entire
cast will be made very soon, and regu
lar rehearsals will be got under way.
Sword and Sandals is relying on
an experienced cast of actors to carry
off as heavy a play as the one chosen
with short time for preparation, and
the lines are already in the hands of
some of the principles.
A choice of play was made over
the week end, when a number of grad
uate members of Sword and Sandal
returned to the campus. They were:
W. P. Fuller, '10, R. \v. Woodville, '11,
R. H. Seward, '12, and J. H. Forbes,
'13.
