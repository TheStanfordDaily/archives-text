# Stanford's Loss
## 
### 
In the death of Doctor Burt Estes
Howard in Los Angeles on July 10,

Stanford loses a true
friend, Councellor and
teacher. Beloved by those
who knew him best, his

passing is made more sad by the fact
that his death was due in a large
measure to his continuance of his
work of instruction in the university
after his health had begun to fail.
Doctor Howard felt that his duty lay
with his students, and he kept his
place on the faculty until the close
of the college last May.
His intimate knowledge of students
and student affairs made him one of
the most intimate friends of Stanford
men and women. On behalf of the
Student Body we extend sincerest
sympathy to those on whom the act
of the Maker in summoning one of
his most useful disciples falls most
heavily.
