We have sung the praises of the
Stanford Band for several semesters.
Our musical organization has reached
a plane where it has received recogni
tion as one of the best bands in the
state. We hope to see this excellence
continued, but this will only be possi
ble by keen competition on the part of
the old members and the new students
for the places in the organization.
Tomorrow afternoon at 2:30 tryouts
are to be commenced under the direc
tion of Professor E. W. Martin.
