# CARVED TABLE TOPS ARE ACQUIRED BY JOE LARKIN
## 
### 
Fifteen table tops, on which are
carved the initials and nicknames of
many of the most prominent men who
ever attended college, have been pur
chased by Joseph Larkin, proprietor
of Larkin's grill and hotel, from Char
lie Meyer, of Menlo Park. A consid
erable sum was paid for these old
relics of early Stanford history. Their
former owner has refused many
tempting offers from San Francisco
and Los Angeles alumni organiza
tions.
Since 1910, when the mile-and-a
half regulations went into effect, the
practice of each class decorating a
table has been discontinued, but Mr.
Larkin is planning to provide a new
table for the present classes and hopes
to perpetuate the custom by adding
table tops representing all succeeding
classes to his present collection.
