That the Student Body may be pro

and possibly pleasure,
a period of University
time has been official-

ly set aside for a general assembly on
Friday morning. For the first time
since assuming his new ofiice, Presi
dent Branner is to speak to the stu
dents. The assembly is intended for
both faculty members and students,
particularly the entering class. Not
merely as a compliment to the speak
ers, but as a duty to yourself, it should
be your business to occupy a seat in
the Assembly Hall at 11:16 tomor
row.
Since this is the initial Assembly
of the semester it seems timely that
a suggestion regarding these meet
ings which the Committee on Public
Exorcises so zealously arrange. Con
siderable adverse comment has been
occasioned by the failure ot' the stu
dents to fill the front seats of the
hall. Some years ago it was custom
ary for the men of the Senior class i
occupy this section. Due to the inva
sion of certain off-campus residents
it became impossible for even thoso
who arrived on time to secure a for
ward seat. Time have changed how
ever, and during the past semester it.
was frequently necessary to delay a
speaker while a request was made
to take the seats in front. Out of
deference to those who are considered
worthy enough to have a period of our
daily working time set apart that they
may give us the benefit of their cult
ure and experience it is ofily proper
that their remembrance of Stanford
listeners be made as memorable as
possible. We may create a more fav
orable impression by at least showing
our interest in their efforts. Every
speaker prefers to talk directly to his
hearers rather than trusting to the
acoustic properties of his auditorium
to carry his message to the audience.
We hope to see the Seniors revive the
tradition of places in the front rows.
