# RUGBY BACKERS WILL RALLY TONIGHT
## 
### 
Rugby will be marked in red let
ters on the Stanford sports calendar
this evening at 7:45 with the signing
up of candidates for the Varsity and
Freshmen fifteens. At the close of
the rally last season IG3 volunteers
signed the roll, 47 less than were re
cruited in 1911. The increased regis
tration of students this semester and
the spirited program of speeches and
cheering that will be conducted by
the yell leaders promise a record en
rollment of athletes.
Presley's straight arm remarks will
be followed by talks from five other
leaders of Cardinal athletic spirit.
The number of speeches has been re
duced and each one will be brief and

charged with pithy significance in or
der to add to the force of the appeal.
Following is the list of men who
will address the rally: Advisory
Coach George J. Presley, Professor
Frank J. Angell, Chairman of the Fac
ulty Committee on Athletics, "Dad"
Moulton, veteran trainer and track
coach, Harry W. Maloney, Rugby
trainer, Floyd C. Brown, '11, Field
Coach, and Captain J. H. Thoburn, '13.
There will be plenty of time at thy
end of the rally for men to sign the
Rugby roll. Coach Brown will ar
range the list Friday and suits will be
given out Friday afternoon. The
squad will be called out for initial
warming up Saturday.
