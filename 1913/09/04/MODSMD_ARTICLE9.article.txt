# "SIXTEEN" TRIUMPHS OVER "SEVENTEEN" IN ANNUAL TIEUP
## 
### 
Twenty-five minutes after Referee
Floyd Brown's starting gun had sent
the phalanx of Sophomores hurtling
into the ranks of the wearers of the
green this afternoon on Stanford
Field, a second shot signaled the
bleachers that the last madly kicking
"Frosh" had been skidded across the
turf into the "morgue", and that the
class of '1G had triumphed for the
second time. Perhaps never in the
history of the tieups on the varsity
field has there been such a strenuous-

ly fought contest, for both sides were
in full strength and the difference in
number did not make the result a
foregone conclusion.
Shortly after 3:30 the first men as
sembled near Encina Gym, where
each acquired a distinguishing smear
of green paint and the implements of
warâ€”long canvas strips. Their jeer
ing opponents chose the tennis courts
as a point of vantage to view the
Freshmen parade, and did not lock
step in to the field until after the long
line had settled on the turf for
instructions.
Individual battles, battles in groups,
and battles of all known varieties
kept the crowd of spectators in the
best of humor, and none of the con
testants could complain of the laclj
of vociferous encouragement.
The Freshmen as they filed through
the training house gate numbered two
hundred and thirty-four, while the
victorious knights of the red hat
had two hundred men on their side
of the field.
