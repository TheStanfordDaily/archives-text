# WELCOME SPIRIT PERVADES ATMOSPHERE AT ASSEMBLY
## President Branner Greets Stanford Folk. Mrs. Allan, Dr. Gardner and Karl Schaupp Make Addresses. 
### 
Rising from their places en masse,
two thousand Stanford men and wom
en greeted Dr. J. C. Branner in the
Assembly Hall this morning to wel
come his first appearance as president
of the university. President Branner
acknowledged the spontaneous cor
diality of his reception with a smile,
and tendered the hand of friendship
in return to the faculty and students,
old and new. He said in part:
"I cannot hope to enter on flights
of oratory or fancy, but in this Wel
come Assembly, must keep near the
beaten path. The trustees have seen
fit to lay on my back great responsi
bilities. In order to carry them out
I shall need the help of the trustees
and the students.
"We are assembled to welcome the
new additions to the ranks, to wel
come each other, and to make the
Freshmen believe that we are not as
bad as the Sophomores may have lead
them to think.
"My first duty is to welcome Pro
fessor W. H. Carruth, from the Uni
versity of Kansas, who is to be our
professor of English. He is a thor
ough student, a capable instructor,
and (with a bow toward Professor
Carruth) a good looking man. And
I am glad to welcome Dr. W. H. Man
waring, of the Rockefeller Institute
in New York, who is to be our Pro
fessor of Bactereology. I can't wel
come our long list of instructors and
students individually, but T do wel
come them all heartily.
"I can't fail to welcome one who
has staid faithfully at the university
â€”Dr. J. M. Stillman, the new vice
president. Another of our members
who has returned from Europe fresh

to put his shoulder to the wheel is
'Daddy' Marx.
"Finally we welcome the large num
ber of new students. From the
strange noises I have heard for sev
eral nights passed, they may be in
doubt as to their status. It is for the
student body to say whether or not
you are welcome.
"To the Freshmen the president is
expected to give advice, but I shall
only advise you regarding a few mat
ters. In behalf of the trustees 1 ask
you to respect property at all times.
Keep the place in order, don't destroy,
don't smoke on the Quad, and in
other things be simply ladies and
gentlemen.
"Don't fall in with some commit
tees; avoid the new broom, for it is
expected to sweep clean. We may be
afraid of a reputation for leniency.
Do not expect us to temper justice
with mercy.
"Don't play too much, or study too
much."
Student Adviser K. L. Schaupp ex
tended his welcome and services to
the entering Freshmen and assured
them that since the hostilities of the
Sophomores ended yesterday they
could consider themselves duly initi
ated to the work and pleasures of
Stanford. He said in part:
"You have come to Stanford with a
purpose. Things will adjust them
selves. Don't forget your ideals. Let's
brace up, and look up to things that
are right. Straight, honest men and
women are the kind we want in Stan
ford, and the kind we have. We want
every man and woman behind those
who are leading."
