# INITIAL RALLY STRIKES KEYNOTE OF SUCCESS
## Speakers Catch Enthusiasm of Big Crowd. Number Signing Up Equals the Record of 1911. 
### 
"Go to it!" That was the keynote
of the big football rally last night in
Encina Hall, the note that was struck
by Dr.- Angell, Advisory Coach, George
Presley, Trainer Maloney, and all the
other men who spoke so in tune with
i the great crowd's awakened enthusi
asm.
"You've got the best of facilities.
As fine athletic men have been found
here as can be found. All you need
' to do is to work hard and work to-
I gether. And the very prestige of
i Stanford athletics depends on what
I you will do!" That was the appeal
made by George Presley from the
' table top, an appeal that was answer
ed by the hundreds of loyal cardinal
i fans who packed Encina Clubrooms
to overflowing and swerved in floor
i shaking "steam-roller" and the fa
| miliar railroad and screeching siren
yells.
A year's success in athletics meas
ured the superabundance of 'pep' that
, swelled into deep throated enthusiasm
with the first yells. The past year's
â€¢success, the return of veterans, the
large incoming class, and the pres
ence of trusted coaches and trainers
nil contributed to the laying of a firm
foundation of confidence.
Immediately after Captain Tho
burn's talk the Rugby candidates sign
ed up for practice. The number total
! Ed 210, tying the highwater mark of
1911. Only 163 signed up in 1912.
Professor Prank J. Angell was the
first speaker to mount the table. He
addressed the Freshmen first:
"The newcomers to our midst must
be in a perplexed state of mind after
going through the past few days. 1
want them to remember the saying

from the scriptures that 'He whom
God loves he chasteneth'. They are
our future hope and joy.
"I want to see a very general par
ticipation in Rugby club games and
games with outside teams, and inci
dentally the intercollegiate game.
"We have found here as fine ath
letic men as can be found. You have
got the best facilities. Now go to it."
Next on the platform was "Dad"
Moulton, who delivered his annual
medley of good advice and jokes. "All
of you have got to work together.
There is no such word as 'die' at
Stanford. You have had good coaches
before, but you have good coaches
now. You have the best chances to
win that you have ever had. All you
need is to work hard, and work to
gether."
Trainer Harry W. Maloney fanned
the enthusiasm of the rally with a
few spirited words:
"Last year was a cuccessful year in
athletics. The whole student body
brought it about, our beloved advisory
coach George Presley, and the thing
called 'Stanford Spirit' brought it
about. To the Freshmen let me say
that we cannot all be members of the
varsity team, but you can know that
you at least had your share in round
ing out a successful team for Novem
ber 8."
After cheering that was prolonged
for several minutes Advisory Coach
George .T. Presley made his appeal:
"You fellows start tonight on what
to my mind is the most important
football season Stanford has entered.
The prestige of Stanford athletics de
pends on what you do. It is up to
