# NEW ZEALAND "ALL BLACKS" WILL ARRIVE OCTOBER 3
## 
### 
With a party of twenty-three play
ers and their manager, the famous
All Blacks of New Zealand will arrive
in San Francisco on or about October
3. The team is coming under the aus
pices of the California Rugby Union,
and play their first game on October
4 with the Olympic Club.
Differing from the Waratahs, the
visitors from Australia of last season,
the All Blacks are not an assembled
team. For this reason their playing
should be uniform from the start, as
each man knows well his partners.
The first Stanford game will be played
on Wednesday, October 15, and the
last game on the following Saturday.
California has three contests sched
uled with the New Zealanders, whilo
Santa Clara, Nevada, the Olympic
Club and Barbarian Clubs, and an All
American team will face the visitors.
The day of Saturday, October 18,
has been signed for in the date-book
and all organizations are asked to
keep this time open for the entertain
ment of the visitors.
