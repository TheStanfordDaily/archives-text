# Rugby 1913
## 
### 
Marked by the spontaneity of ap
plause and characterized by a spirit

of get-together, the rally
last evening not only re
corded over two hundred

candidates for the Cardinal Rugby
teams sed etiam bodes well for the
success of Stanford on the football
turf during the season of 1913. As
Coach Brown explained, practice be
gins at 3:30 tomorrow. This means
that every man signed up must re
port at the hour named unless he is
excused. The requirements for a
winning varsity fifteen on November
8 were amply treated last evening.
It's up to you!
