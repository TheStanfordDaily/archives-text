# NEW RULES ARE NOW IN EFFECT FOR DATE-BOOK
## SOCIETIES RATIFY PROPOSED REGULATIONS Books Will be Open to Fraternities, Sororities and Clubs Friday Morning. 
### 
By action of the organizations in
volved. the rules devised last spring
by a special committee to regulate
the securing of dates for dances and
other social and dramatic functions
have gone into effect, dating from
the first of this semester. These rules
are designed to obviate the confusion
and conflicts attendant upon the old
method. They were submitted last
Way to a vote of all the fraternities,
sororities and house clubs, as well as
Encina and Roble clubs, and were for
mally ratified by all except three.
These have given their tacit consent.
The rules, then, are made effective by
authority of all university organiza
tions and are only enforceable
through their good faith. This, it is
believed, will be sufficient to guard
them against any violation in spirit
or letter. Attention is particularly
called to the rules numbered six and
eight below.
In accordance with these regula
tions, a date-book has been provided
in which have been entered in red
ink the dates of important university
functions, such as the entertainment
for the New Zealand Rugby players,
the class plays and dances, and the
Encina and Roble club dances for the
year. These dates are exclusive.
From now until Fridayâ€”that is, until
a full week after the beginning of
collegiate instruction, the book will
be thrown open to semi-public organ
izations, such as Sword and San
dals, the gym club, and the band,
which may each enter a date in black
ink. These dates are not exclusive,
but will not be interfered with by or
ganizations of a less public nature.
Beginning Friday, the book will be
open to fraternities, sororities, and
house clubs.
1. That two weeks before the last
day ol ! collegiate instruction of the
spring semester, a suitable date
book be placed in the Registrar's
office in which all organizations shall
enlist their functions for the coming
year which concern the entire student
body or a representative assemblage
from the entire student body.
2. That during the remainder of
the spring semester and the first
week of the fall semester only those
functions which will interest a com
paratively large number of the stu
dents shall be entered. It is intend
ed by this recommendation that rep
resentatives of dramatic aud musical
organizations shall enter the dates of
their performances; that the presi
dent of the student body shall enter
the dates of the important university
functions; that class presidents shall
enter the dates of the class plays
and class dances; and that the presi
dents of Encina and Roble Clubs
shall enter the dates of their dances.
3. That one week after registra
tion in the fall, the book be thrown
open to the fraternities, sororities
and house clubs, according to the
custom in vogue at the present time.
4. That each fraternity, sorority
and house club shall hold but one
formal representative dance a year.
5. That the fraternities, sororities
and house clubs shall enter only the
dates of their respective formal rep
resentative dances and shall avoid
conflicts with such functions named
(namely Encina dances, Roble dances,
official class functions and dramatic
productions.)
6. That no invitations shall be is
sued until the date has been entered
in the date book.
7. It is further recommended that
if possible the dances on the campus
be started at an earlier hour and shall
close promptly at twelve o'clock, and
8. That invitations be not sent out
until at least six weeks before the
date of any formal dance.
