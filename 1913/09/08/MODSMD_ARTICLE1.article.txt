# NEW RULES ARE NOW IN EFFECT FOR DATE-BOOK
## SOCIETIES RATIFY PROPOSED REGULATIONS Books Will be Open to Fraternities, Sororities and Clubs Friday Morning. 
### 
By action of the organizations in
volved. the rules devised last spring
by a special committee to regulate
the securing of dates for dances and
other social and dramatic functions
have gone into effect, dating from
the first of this semester. These rules
are designed to obviate the confusion
and conflicts attendant upon the old
method. They were submitted last
Way to a vote of all the fraternities,
sororities and house clubs, as well as
Encina and Roble clubs, and were for
mally ratified by all except three.
These have given their tacit consent.
The rules, then, are made effective by
authority of all university organiza
tions and are only enforceable
through their good faith. This, it is
believed, will be sufficient to guard
them against any violation in spirit
or letter. Attention is particularly
called to the rules numbered six and
eight below.
In accordance with these regula
tions, a date-book has been provided
in which have been entered in red
ink the dates of important university
functions, such as the entertainment
for the New Zealand Rugby players,
the class plays and dances, and the
Encina and Roble club dances for the
year. These dates are exclusive.
From now until Fridayâ€”that is, until
a full week after the beginning of
collegiate instruction, the book will
be thrown open to semi-public organ
izations, such as Sword and San
dals, the gym club, and the band,
which may each enter a date in black
ink. These dates are not exclusive,
but will not be interfered with by or
ganizations of a less public nature.
Beginning Friday, the book will be
open to fraternities, sororities, and
house clubs.
