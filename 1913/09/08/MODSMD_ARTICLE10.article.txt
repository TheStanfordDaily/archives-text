### 
Two hundred men answered the
rollcall of Captain Thoburn Satur
day afternoon in the lirst Rugby prac
tice of the season. Practically all of
those signing up at Thursday's rally
were on the field or had been excused
before the appointed hour, booting
the ball and becoming familiar with
the turf.
Advisory Coach Presley was in
charge of the squad, with Coach
Hrown assisting in segregating
unwieldly crowd of candidates into
selected groups. A number of the
backs were in charge of Captain Tho
burn, some of the forwards were un
der the direction of W. P. Darsie, '14,
and F. J. Card, '14.
The Practice.
After some minutes of calesthenics,
the men were put through a half
hour's fast practice in passing the
ball, picking up, and booting to touch.
And as a final touch to the initial
workout of the season. Coach Presley
then drilled the entire squad in cov
ering the field for a kickoff.
While little can be learned con
cerning the work of the new men in
one practice, there was enough
knowledge of the game shown on
Saturday by Freshmen and others
out for the first time to make th« out
look for the next months very en
couraging. There are a number of
prep school stars included in the 1917
squad, and a fifteen of no mean abili
ty could be picked from the names on
the roll.
As a means of grouping the players
for the first few days, the men were
given positions on their class teams,
or were named as substitutes. The
Freshmen were divided into several
teams, chosen solely from the ex
perience the candidates had specified
on the enrollment cards.
The turf is unusually fine, and with
a good deal of practice on the auxili
ary field, the ground should remain
green and smooth through the season.
Old Stars Present,
Among the close observers of the
initial practice were "Bill" Pember
ton, '08, varsity football and crew
man, and "Babe" Crawford, 1898
football captain.
