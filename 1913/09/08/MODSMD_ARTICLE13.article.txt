# Track And Crew
## 
### 
Fall track and crew training is 10
begin immediately. Tomorrow even-

ing at 7:30 a rally is sched
uled for Encina clubroom.
Training at this season of
the year is intended primarily
for the new men who are not

out for the regular fall sports. Last
season was the first year that much
attention was paid to workouts on
the cinder path and the success of the
distance runners in the last intercol
legiate was largely due to the cross
country training done long before the
spring semester.
Stanford is fortunate in having for
leaders in track and rowing such
worthy exponents of their respective
branches of activity as Paul McKee
and Phil Clover. "Dad" Moul toil's
business is to make track athletes.
It has been found difficult in the pas:
to make winning teams without men.
So here is the opportunity for those
who are not out for Rugby.
