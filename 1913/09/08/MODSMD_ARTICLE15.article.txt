monologue. The speakers were

Captain Campbell said in part:
"When you come out for athletics
you are able to see the different men
about the campus in action and you
can get on the boat and recognize the
truly big men. Here at Stanford we
offer you as good athletic facilities
as there are anywhere. You owe it
to yourself and to your college to
come out and if you do you can easily
repeat last year's victories."
"The college man is coming to the
front more and more all the time
now," said Lockwood, "and 1 am on
the campus to teach you men to take
advantage of the opportunity for
service to your fellow men which is
yearly coming more into the hands
of the college man."
