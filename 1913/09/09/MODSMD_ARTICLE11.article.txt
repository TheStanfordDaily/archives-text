# Not Intentional

Numerous complaints have come
into this office regarding the failure

of our subscribers to re
ceive their copies of this
paper. Naturally, a great
hardship has resulted

from this deprivation of all the news
of the day and week. Part of the re
sponsibility for this may be due to the
unfamiliarity of our carriers with the
host of new subscribers during the
first days of the semester. But an in
vestigation has shown us that numer
ous misappropriations on the part of
some of the student lodging house
residents who have thus far inad
vertently neglected to become attach
ed to our subscription lists is to
blame. A word to the absent minded
ones is sufficient.
