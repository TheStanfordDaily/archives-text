# Early Notices
## 
### 
To aid us in our attempt to publish
an early paper so that the news of the

day may be disseminated be<-
fore the dinner hour, it will
be necessary that all notices

for our columns be in before
2:30 o'clock on the day of their pub
lication. This early ruling has been
made absolute and no announcements
will be received later than the pre
scribed hour.
