# EXPERTS APPROVE PLANS FOR BLEACHER ADDITIONS
## 
### 
Contractors' bids for the construc
tion of a block of about sixteen hun
dred new seats in the football bleach
ers will be received at 2 o'clock Tues
day afternoon, September IG, in room
279 of the C. E. building. All bids
must be delivered to Professor
Charles Closer of the C. E. department,
and none will be accepted after the
date named. The successful bidding
contractor will begin work at once.
By the addition of the new seats to
the open space at the left of the train
ing house, the total seating capacity
of the bleachers will be increased to
about 17,000 persons. The construc
tion will be completed by October
25, according to terms of the con
tract, and all waste materials cleared
away. During work, the turf must be
kept clear from waste and Rugby
practice will not be interfered with.
Specifications for the new stand are
similar to those followed in erecting
the present bleachers. Considerable
excavation will be required to estab
lish a foundation on which concrete
bases can be placed.
Suggestions which have been cur
rent for some time to the effect that
the condition of the old bleachers can
not safely stand the strain of a large
crowd, have been completely refuted
by expert examination. The findings
of Heller and Wilson, consulting en
gineers of San Francisco, in their re
port to the trustees reports that the

strength of the structure is ample for
complete safety.
Experts Report.
A part of their formal report fol
lows :
"In accordance with instructions we
have calculated the stresses develop
ed in nil parts of the structure sub
mitted to strain, and have examined
the plans for additions to be built to
the bleachers.
"The bleachers are in good physical
condition, largely attributable to the
fact that the seats protect the struct
ure from the action of the elements.
There is no evidence of any kind of
rotting of timbers, nor of the struct
ure being out of plumb. The design
of the addition to the bleachers has
been examined, and we recommend
that they be constructed in accordance
with the plans submitted."
A few minor suggestions were made
by Heller and Wilson for additional
braces to the new bleachers as shown
in the drawings, and for extra sup
porting beams to run from the ground
to the top row of seats all around the
enclosed part of the field.
Further report of the examining en
gineers is: "The design of the
bleachers is of sufficient strength so
long as their physical strength re
mains reasonably good. In fact we do
not consider that it will be necessary
to have the design of the structure
checked."

ing house, the total seating capacity
of the bleachers will be increased to
about 17,000 persons. The construc
tion will be completed by October
25, according to terms of the con
tract, and all waste materials cleared
away. During work, the turf must be
kept clear from waste and Rugby
practice will not be interfered with.
Specifications for the new stand are
similar to those followed in erecting
the present bleachers. Considerable
excavation will be required to estab
lish a foundation on which concrete
bases can be placed.
Suggestions which have been cur
rent for some time to the effect that
the condition of the old bleachers can
not safely stand the strain of a large
crowd, have been completely refuted
by expert examination. The findings
of Heller and Wilson, consulting en
gineers of San Francisco, in their re
port to the trustees reports that the

strength of the structure is ample for
complete safety.
Experts Report.
A part of their formal report fol
lows :
"In accordance with instructions we
have calculated the stresses develop
ed in nil parts of the structure sub
mitted to strain, and have examined
the plans for additions to be built to
the bleachers.
"The bleachers are in good physical
condition, largely attributable to the
fact that the seats protect the struct
ure from the action of the elements.
There is no evidence of any kind of
rotting of timbers, nor of the struct
ure being out of plumb. The design
of the addition to the bleachers has
been examined, and we recommend
that they be constructed in accordance
with the plans submitted."
A few minor suggestions were made
by Heller and Wilson for additional
braces to the new bleachers as shown
in the drawings, and for extra sup
porting beams to run from the ground
to the top row of seats all around the
enclosed part of the field.
Further report of the examining en
gineers is: "The design of the
bleachers is of sufficient strength so
long as their physical strength re
mains reasonably good. In fact we do
not consider that it will be necessary
to have the design of the structure
checked."
