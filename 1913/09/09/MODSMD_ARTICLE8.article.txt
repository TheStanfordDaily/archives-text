# Interclass Chess Tournament.
## 
### 
As an innovation in chess circles
an interclass tournament to take the
place of the fall tournament for be
ginners is being planned by the Stan
ford Chess Club. All varsity players
are to be eligible for the play. New
men are needed for the intercollegi
ate team, as but four of those who
successfully competed with California
last spring have returned to college.
A set of chess men is at the dis
posal of the players in Encina club
room and another is to be placed on
the Quad, probably in the Y. M. C. A.
room.
