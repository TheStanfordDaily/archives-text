# BRITISH PHYSIOLOGIST LECTURES IN CHAPEL
## Sir Edward Schaefer, Lane Medical Lecturer, Demonstrates Methods of Resuscitation. 
### 
Sir Edward Schaefer, of Edinburgh
University, Lane Medical lecturer for
this year, addressed a crowded chapel
audience yesterday as was scheduled
011 "Methods of Resuscitation."
"Newspaper men," began Professor
Schaefer, "often accuse rue of restor
ing the dead to life. This I cannot do,
and if I could, would do in many cases
only with great regret."
Continuing, his listeners were told
that after much experimenting, he had
been able to restore life to animals
from twenty-four to thirty-six hours
after the heart had ceased beating,
and to humans eighteen hours after
death, â€”this in cold weather.
Professor Schaefer's original investi
gations in physiological work cover
xnany years, and his methods of resus
citation are the result of much ex
perimenting. When known, these
methods will replace all others. In
devising them, the effect upon every
organ of the body was taken into ac
count. They are so valuable and yet
so simple that no one should be with
out a knowledge of them.
The method of resuscitating a drown
ed person was carefully described
and illustrated. In the illustrations
were used lantern slides and living
models. The "models" were students
who kindly consented to be resusi
tator" and "resuscitated." Professor
Schaefer proved himself to be not
only a scientist, hut a humorist as
well, and kept his auditors not only
much interested, but also in a good
humor.
