That problems of vital interest to
the Student Body may be adequately

considered by the leaders of
undergraduate activities the
Committee on Public Exer-

cises has designated the 9:15
hour tomorrow as a time when all
university work is to be discontinued.
Student Control, Women's Activities
and the proposed new gymnasium
which is to be built by the Board of
Trustees and which may be turned
over to the Student Body are to be
discussed. Before any formal action
is taken on the gymnasium proposi
tion it is necessary that a thorough
discussion of the proposal be had, so
that the situation will be well under
stood, as it is a matter which will ef
fect every person registered in the
university. The best means of fa
miliarizing one's self with the details
of contemplated plans and also of
the workings of student self-govern
ment is to attend the Assembly on the
morrow.
