# CROSS COUNTRY RUNNING FOR TRACK AND CREW MEN
## 
### 
Inaugurating the second season for
cross country work, forty-seven men
signified their intentions of entering
this sport. One hundred and twenty
signed up for the fall track work at
the rally in Encina Hall last evening.
Cross country running proved to be
the most popular branch of track
work. I'.oth Captain P. 15. McKee and
Crew Captain 13.I 3 . P. Clover, '14, em
phasized the necessity of cross coun
try work and the great benefit de
rived therefrom by the distance run
ners.
Captain Clover asked that all Fresh
men who'were not out for any sport
and intended taking up crew work
next spring to devote their fall pre
j liminary training to cross country
I work. The old crew men were not
1 asked to sign up as there are no pros
-1 pects for a fall regatta, but were
: urged to take up some sport and keep
!in good physical condition,
j Following the policy adopted last
spring, Professor R. R. Long has an
nounced that track and crew work
may be substituted for regular gym
nasium instruction, and that credit
| will be given for the three hours of
I work each week. Every Monday, Wed
nesday and Friday afternoon a gym.
nasium instructor will give a cales
thenics drill at 4:50 at the track
, training house before the regular
workout.
i Track practice is to start this af
i ternoon. The cross country men will
work under the direction of F. L.
Foster, '13.
Captain McKee stated that the best
I possible team available will be sent
to the Portola Festival on October 25.
The most important reason for mak
ing a showing at Portola is to give
the men competition. "Nothing is so
i good for an athlete as outside com
■ petition," said Trainer Maloney.
The necessity of developing raw ma
| terial during the fall season was dwelt
J upon by each speaker.

"Dad" Moulton emphasized the fact
that athletics are the making of a
man, but that one must live up to good
i scholarship in order to becuine an
! athlete.
"There is no question but what
every man in athletics owes it to the
rest of the men to keep up in scholar
ship and to stay in college, and not
to come here primarily for athletics,"
j said Professor D. M. Folsom. "Every
underclassman should sign up for
j some sport and stay with it through
| his entire time at college. Those who
; have done most for the Stanford spirit
and for athletics are those who have
not won points, but stayed with the
sport year after year. I believe our
athletic equipment is an important
as our library or our laboratories.
You get things out on the field such
as discipline, confiednce, and what it
means to be beaten and to win, which
cannot be given in the class room.
The sooner the fellows learn to go
out to win victories for their college
1 the sooner they will be prepared to
meet the issues of life."
