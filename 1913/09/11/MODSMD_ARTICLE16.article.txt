# CONCERT ARRANGED BY PENINSULA ASSOCIATION
## All-Star Combination of Musicians to Be Heard About October 20. 
### 
The first concert of the Peninsula
Musical Association for the coming
season is to be given in the Assembly
Hall about October 20. An all-star
combination has been secured for the
initial musical, and includes Frances!
Alda, a soprano of the Metropolitan
Opera Company, of New York; Frank
La Forge, who needs no introduction
to the musicians of the Pacific Coast,,
and Casini, the cellist, who toured with
Mine. Lembrick last season.
During the year just closed the peo
ple of the vicinity of Stanford were
privileged to hear such talent as Ri
ca rdo Martin, Gerville Reache, Misch?
El man and Josef Lhevine.
In planning for the second season
it will be necessary for all associa
tion members to sign the new cards
of membership and mail them to the
secretary, Miss Lora D. Ilarker, of
Palo Alto. The season tickets may be
purchased for five dollars and entitle
the owner to two tickets for each of
the four concerts. Last season there*
were many more applications for mem
bership than could be filled on ac
count of the limited seating capacity
of the Assembly Hall. From present
indications the concerts will be more
popular this year.
