# NEW PLAY IS CHOSEN FOR FIRST ONE OF SEMESTER
## Sword and Sandals Will Produce "The Tyranny of Tears" on September 26. 
### 
"The Tyranny of Tears," by C. Had
don Chambers, has been definitely de
cided upon as the Sword and Sandals
play to be staged in the Assembly
Hall on the evening of September 26.
The society originally planned to put
on "The Servant in the House," but
the lateness of some of the members
in registering leaves insufficient time
for the rehearsal of the problem play
so that it has been thought best to
substitute Chambers' popular comedy.
There are but seven in the cast. W.
B. Owens, '14, will play the lead, but
the other characters have not been
fully decided upon. Coach Frank
Mathieu will probably choose them
tonight Anally when the first rehearsal
will be held.
Rehearsals will be held every af
ternoon and evening on account of
the short space of time intervening
before the date set for the produc
tion.
