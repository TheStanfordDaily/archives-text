# SCRIMMAGES HELP COACHES ORGANIZE RUGBY SQUAD.
## Class Teams in First Stages of Development. Two Games On Saturday. 
### 
With four days of practice to their
credit and scrimmages that included
every Rugby candidate, the big squad
on Stanford Field has begun to as
sume a definite shape, and the class
teams to appear as workable units.
The first game of the season is sched
uled for Saturday afternoon, and al
ready conjecture is rife as to the
choice of the coaches for the initial
contest.
The tirst year ruggers are now list
ed in four teams, with substitutes,
and progress is marked to some ex
tent by the shifting of positions on th*
teams. In the scrimmages on Tuesday
the 3917 men showed some skill and
an abundance of energy and willing
ness, the first team crossing the Soph
omores goal line twice in the fifteen
minute half.
It now seems likely that W. W. Hill,
of the Australian Rugby Union, will
referee the big game on November Sth.
as that past master of the English
game has cabled his willingness to ac
cept the invitation of California and
Stanford. Only an unforseen contin
gency will iirevent his making the
trip to California.
Game With IT.l T . S. C.
The much discussed game with the
University of Southern California,
much discussed by the Los Angeles
newspapers at least, has been set at
last for November 22, a week after
the All Star game with the New Zeal
anders.
