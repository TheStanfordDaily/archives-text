# BUILDING PROSPECTS ARE OUTLINED AT ASSEMBLY
## 
### 
The general assembly of men and
women students this morning was di
rected to start a successful second
year in the student control experi
ment, and to explain prospects for the
erection of the Stanford Union and
new athletic buildings. After wel
coming and imposing obligations of
service on the Freshmen, A. G. Halm,
*14, President of the Student Body,
outlined plans for building construc
tion. Some of his remarks were:
"The best piece of real news that
has occurred around here for a long
time is that plans and specifications
for the Stanford Union will be sub
mitted to the contractors Saturday.
You of the present generation of Stan
ford will see it built."
President Halm stated that at the
meeting of a joint building committee
of students and faculty members, the
construction of a new gymnasium
and concrete stadium in the near fu
ture had been proposed.
The gymnasium is proposed to be
L shaped, situated on athletic fields,
and to be constructed in similar man
ner as the engineering buildings, with
ample accommodations. The build
ing will be erected by the university,
and supported by the students after
completion. An assessment of $10
per annum for upkeep will be levied
on all students, giving a sum of about
$11,000 annually.
Halm continued: "The second pro
posal of the committee concerned *
concrete stadium. The stadium will
not be situated on the site of the pres
ent football turf. The field will be
excavated, dirt thrown on the sides,
and concrete terrace put in. The
stadium will accommodate fifteen
or twenty thousand people, and a
promenade around the top will pro
vide standing room for five or ten
thousand more.
"Money for the undertaking will be
forwarded by the trustees, to be ra

paid within a period of fifteen years
at an interest of five per cent. We
can expect these propositions to ,ie
working very smoothly as soon as H.
0. Hoover returns from Europe in
October."
Miss Carol Green, '14, President jf
the Women's Conference, was the sec
ond of three speakers on the lloor.
Miss Green gave a detailed descrip
tion of the machinery of the Women's
Conference, and offered advice to the
students in the form of three "Do's."
She said in closing:
"If we each feel the responsibilities
that rest on us as members of the
student government, there will he no
work for the council to do."
Karl Schaupp, Student Adviser, up
pealed for the help of each individual
student to make student control a
real success, and to carry it beyond
the stage of experiment. Schaupp
said in part:
"We want every member of the stu
dent body, men and women alike be
hind the various leaders. We have
passed a bad year, one that was full of
trials. Now we have another year be
fore us, which is either to put this
system 011 a firm foundation or show
that it is inadvisable. If we are to
have student control there must be 110
slow stepping forward. We've got to
stand 011 our marks. You should elect
men to the conference who will ex
press your wishes. These in turn will
elect the student council of five.
"We want you to understand that
there has been 110 faculty interfer
ence in student government, and will
be none. Freshmen, if student control
is to be a success, it's up to you to do
the right thing.
"Often we get inquiries from the
East about student control at Stan
ford. President Branner lias said
that the name of Stanford is brighter
since the students individually began
to control themselves."
