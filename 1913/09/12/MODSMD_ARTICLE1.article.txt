# MAKES INTIMATE STUDY OF BRAZILIAN PEOPLE
## 
### 
IJ.1 J . A. Martin, Assistant Professor in
the History Department, has just com
pleted a very interesting tour of Bra
zil. While there he had every oppor
tunity of observing the educational
activities of the Brazilians, and was
able to make a thorough study of his
torical, economic, and social phases of
life in Brazil.
Professor Martin's purpose in mak
ing the journey was to accumulate
material for the Stanford department's
courses in Latin American history,
both by purchase and by gift. The re
sult of his endeavors was a decided
success, as the Brazilian government
cooperated with him by adding a very
rare set of books to his collection.
There are live cases of these volumes,
many of which are now out of print
and exceedingly difficult to secure.
Professor Martin made two excur
sions into the interior of the country,
travelling over three thousand miles
in all, and met many of the leading
Brazilian statesmen, educators, amV
scientists of the day. lie remarked:
"I visited all of the leading colleges
and was pleased to note that those
run by Americans rank high in point
of literary standing. There are two
of these institutions which are con
ducted for men only: McKenzie Col
lege, at Sao Paulo, and Granberry Col
lege, at Juiz de Fora. Both exert a
great influence on the educational life
of Brazil."
During his travels, Professor Martin
met two Stanford alumni, E. K. Soper,
'US, and H. L. Small, '11, who are both
in the employ of the Brazilian Geologi
cal Survey. "They are considered to
be two of the most eminent of the
younger school of geologists in Bra
zil," said Professor Martin.
"I noticed that the Brazilians evince
a close interest in the affairs of yur
country," continued Professor Martin.
"There is an ever increasing tendency
to seek educational models in the
United States rather than in Europe,
especially as regards agricultural in
stitutions. As an example of this ten
dency, it may lie noted that four Bra
zilian scholars have been to the
International Congress of students at
Ithaca, X. Y., which is in session at
the present time. The people greatly
appreciate the reception accorded to
Lauro Midler, the noted Brazilian dip
lomat who recently toured the United
States, and the papers gave detailed
accounts of the incidents of his trip,
including his visit to Stanford. C.o/-
ernment officials and educators are
greatly pleased with the interest shown
in Latin America in our schools and
colleges. These four scholars at Ith
aca have been instructed to promote
an interchange of students and pro
fessors between the two countries."
In concluding. Professor Martin
stated that the enthusiastic apprecia
tion of Olivera Lima's lectures, which
were given here las:t fall, was very
favorably commented upon in Brazil,
and it is to be hoped that such friendly
relations will be strengthened in the
future.

IJ.1 J . A. Martin, Assistant Professor in
the History Department, has just com
pleted a very interesting tour of Bra
zil. While there he had every oppor
tunity of observing the educational
activities of the Brazilians, and was
able to make a thorough study of his
torical, economic, and social phases of
life in Brazil.
Professor Martin's purpose in mak
ing the journey was to accumulate
material for the Stanford department's
courses in Latin American history,
both by purchase and by gift. The re
sult of his endeavors was a decided
success, as the Brazilian government
cooperated with him by adding a very
rare set of books to his collection.
There are live cases of these volumes,
many of which are now out of print
and exceedingly difficult to secure.
Professor Martin made two excur
sions into the interior of the country,
travelling over three thousand miles
in all, and met many of the leading
Brazilian statesmen, educators, amV
scientists of the day. lie remarked:
"I visited all of the leading colleges
and was pleased to note that those
run by Americans rank high in point
of literary standing. There are two
of these institutions which are con
ducted for men only: McKenzie Col
lege, at Sao Paulo, and Granberry Col
lege, at Juiz de Fora. Both exert a
great influence on the educational life
of Brazil."
During his travels, Professor Martin
met two Stanford alumni, E. K. Soper,
'US, and H. L. Small, '11, who are both
in the employ of the Brazilian Geologi
cal Survey. "They are considered to
be two of the most eminent of the
younger school of geologists in Bra
zil," said Professor Martin.
"I noticed that the Brazilians evince
a close interest in the affairs of yur
country," continued Professor Martin.
"There is an ever increasing tendency
to seek educational models in the
United States rather than in Europe,
especially as regards agricultural in
stitutions. As an example of this ten
dency, it may lie noted that four Bra
zilian scholars have been to the
International Congress of students at
Ithaca, X. Y., which is in session at
the present time. The people greatly
appreciate the reception accorded to
Lauro Midler, the noted Brazilian dip
lomat who recently toured the United
States, and the papers gave detailed
accounts of the incidents of his trip,
including his visit to Stanford. C.o/-
ernment officials and educators are
greatly pleased with the interest shown
in Latin America in our schools and
colleges. These four scholars at Ith
aca have been instructed to promote
an interchange of students and pro
fessors between the two countries."
In concluding. Professor Martin
stated that the enthusiastic apprecia
tion of Olivera Lima's lectures, which
were given here las:t fall, was very
favorably commented upon in Brazil,
and it is to be hoped that such friendly
relations will be strengthened in the
