# Protection

Property holdings un the Stanford
campus have a valuation totaling well

into the millions. The
acreage belonging to the
University in our imme-

diate neighborhood exceeds the 7000
figure. To protect the lands and build
ings on this vast estate the University
has provided a hose cart or two, a hook
and ladder wagon, some lire fighting
implements and a fire alarm. Besides
this we have practically nothing. The
only organization which is intrusted
with the duties of the man with the
ladder and the hose is composed of
workmen about the campus. The in
adequacy of our lire protection was
amply demonstrated this morning.
Last year an additional fire house and
equipment were provided but this is
not enough. A better fire department
should be organized and better provis
ion made for any emergency which
fortunately has never caused a mate
rial loss here. Financially speaking, it.
is far cheaper to pay for firemen than
depend on insurance companies.
