While students of economics are
worrying over the high cost of living

and the anti-militarists are
tilting with the battleship
builders over our country's ex
travagance, an investigator

has outdistanced them all and discov
ered a reason at our door step why the
monthly stipend so rapidly decreases
in such a short time. It is our imbibi
tion of the colorless liquid compound
of hydrogen and oxygen in the propor
tion of two volumes of hydrogen to
one of oxygen with an occasional dash
of citric acid or a touch of congealed
water. The increase in Ihe cost of
high living results from the recent
boost which has been given the an
nouncement of courses at the only
nectar-quaffing establishment on the
campus. Monopolies are joys forever
when you're the monopoly, but when
the other fellow sends the bill it is a
different matter. Verily, it must be fine
to be a camel on these thirst produc
ing days.
Organization of the lntersociety De
bating League, which controls local
debating affairs of the university, was
completed last evening by the selec
tion of K. Leib, '13, president, and E.
C. Smith, '13, secretary. The league
comprises two members from each lit
erary society and ex-officio the two
presidents. P. D. Nowell, '13. and O. IT.
