# L.H. EATON WILL DIRECT REORGANIZED GLEE CLUB
## 
### 
L. H. Eaton, the noted San Francisco
musical expert, has been chosen to
direct the Glee Club this year. Under
his leadership an entire reorganiza
tion of the Glee Club is to take place.
The number will be reduced from forty
to twenty-four, and owing to this re-,
adjustment, old, as well as new appli
cants for membership will be expected
to tryout for positions.
The old method of selection by a
student committee has been discon
tinued, and Director Eaton will choose
for the Glee Club those who, in his es
timation, possess the best and most ex- |
perienced voices.
At a preliminary tryout, which will |
take place Wednesday evening at 7:00 |
o'clock in the chapel, forty of the !
most likely candidates will be select- [
ed, and the number will later be re
stricted to twenty-four. By this plan, j
it is hoped that the Glee Club will
represent the best talent of the uni
versity when it takes its journey to
Vancouver at Christmas time.
