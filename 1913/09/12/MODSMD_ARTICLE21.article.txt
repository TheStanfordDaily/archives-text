# GASOLINE AND BRINK.
## 
### 
One automobile for 1655 students is
not enough and yet it is enough. Were
this number to ride in and enjoy their
new cooperative machine it would be
one thing, but as they can only gaze
and cast longing glances at its 14 up
holstery a different light than that n'
ihe sun is thrown on the matter.
A machine being*paid for by all the
students of a university is something
out of the ordinary, especially when
they were not consulted at the time of
its purchase. But then a monopoly is
a monopoly. Sticky Wilson is now
running a new auto delivery and
prices have gone up accordingly.
To make up for the breakage of eggs
when being transported at the rate of
60 per, the price of all egg drinks has
gone up.
That last, pure, unadulterated, non
intoxicating, passed-by-the-National-
Board-of-Censorship drink, plain lem
onade. has been raised accordingly. In
fact, nearly all beverages have taken
a jump with the exception of ice water.
This is still given free. But then tirei
and gasoline are necessary for any
automobile.
