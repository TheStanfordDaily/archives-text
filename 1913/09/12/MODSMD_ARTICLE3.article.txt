The cast of "The Tyranny of Tears"
, was chosen definitely last night by
Coach Mathieu. Some of the places
have been in doubt, but now that, they
are decided rehearsals will go on im
mediately to round the play in shape
in the next two weeks. The date set.
for it. is September 2(5. two weeks from
tonight.
The motif of "The Tyranny of
Tears" is that human weakness in
which a man so universally smiles at
in his neighbors but can never recog
nize in his home—the manner which
wives have of ruling their husbands
by resorting to tears when other
means of gaining their end have been
exhausted—the pink and white tyran
ny of many households. The tyrant
is not the new militant woman, but
the gentle-handed ministrant who de
sires her husband to be happy, pro
viding lie becomes so in her way.
Humor is present everywhere in the
lines, and at many this humor breaks
out into a riot of comedy. John Drew
appeared in the play for two seasons
and later revived it for a third, so
; great was its popularity.
