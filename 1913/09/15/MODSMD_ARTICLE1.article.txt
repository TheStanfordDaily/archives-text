# VARSITY LOSES TO "WINGED-O" FIFTEEN
## 5-3 GAME TAKEN BY STRONG OLYMPIC TEAM. Freshman-Lowell Melee Goes to First Year Class With A 8-5 Score. 
### 
Fifty-five minutes were not enough
for the Stanford Varsity to cross their
opponent's goal line more than once
in their game with the Olympics on
Saturday, and the clubmen left the
field the victors in the initial Rugby
contest of the year with the score
5-3. The Varsity fifteen made a great
fight against a team that was heavier
and stronger in the scrum, and show
ed surprisingly good form in general
offensive work for a contest so early
in the season.
The Freshman game with Lowell
High ended in % 8 to 5 victory for
1917.
The Varsity game throughout, both
halves was largely confined to the
forwards, and the backfield rushes
were short and usually the result of
individual play rather than of com
bination. A pretty passing rush at
the end of the first two minutes of
play electrified the bleachers, Gard
securing the ball in a lineup on the
Olympic 25 yard line, passing to Aus
tin, who shot through the club de
fence and passed to Carroll, the sec
ond five going over the line for a try.
The goal was a very difficult one, and
Davidson failed to convert by the nar
row margin of a few inches, the ball
hitting the cross bar and bouncing 1
back.
The Cardinal triumph was short
lived. however, for before the end of
the half, while the play was deep in
the enemy's territory, Stolz, of the
Olympics, took advantage of a fum- !
ble, secured the ball and ran
down an open field for a try, placing '
the pigskin directly beneath the goal
posts. The conversion was an easy
one, and Cass added two points to the 1
clubmen's total.
With the score 5 to 3 against them J
when tho whistle blew for the second
half, the gray and black jerseyed
players carried the play into the ;
Olympic danger zone, and with the ex- 1
ception of short periods when the I
pack went back up the field, Stan- j
ford's hopes for a touch down ran '
high. Rut Hanley, the 'Winged 0' full
back, and others of the club backfield, 1
proved strong in defense, and the ball
did not cross their goal line. Toward
the last of the half the play centered
in the Stanford half of the field, and
the game ended with the ball at cen-«n
ter. with the honors even for the last,
period of thirty minutes.
In the Varsity scrum the good work
of Gard, Dajsie, Hall and Clover was
noticeable, and they were ably backed
up bv their first scrum mates and the
substitute forwards that, were soon
sent into the game. Austin and Car
roll were a speedy combination and
proved their going ability on more
than one occasion.
Coaches Presley and Brown used
tho second team men freely, and there
were few who lasted the fifty-five min
utes of play.
The 'Winged O' fifteen was probably
the fastest and most formidable ag
gregation of Rugby players that has
ever come to the campus under the
banner of the San Francisco club.
The forwards were heavy and experi
enced players, and the backfield was
la combination of flrst-rate players
who are still in the best of playing
condition and are not resting on past
laurels. "Stubby Stolz, '09, was
perhaps the most conspicuous player
on the field, but lie was ably seconded
in the back field by Hanley, Forbes,
Best, Cass and Risling. Palmer Ful
ler, '10, was the referee.
The Freshmen.
The preliminary game with the
Freshmen versus Lowell High School
was a melee from the word go. There
were occasional flashes of heady play
ing, and once or twice the backs show
ed some combination, but an as exhi
bition of Rugby the contest would
not rank very high. Substitutes were
used for practically every position.
The first score came at the end of
fifteen minutes of play from a passing
rush, Eyer to Templeton to Harris,
who went across. McGilvray convert
ed and the score board read S. 5, L. 0.
In the second half the Freshmen
were awarded a free kick on the Low
ell 25 yard line, and Townsend sent
the ball between the posts, adding
three points to the 1917 total. Lowel!
came back with a rush, and Turking
ton scored for his team. Knight con
verted and the final score was Fresh
men S, Lowell 5.
The lineups with first substitutes
were:
Freshmen: McGilvray, Baumgart
'ier, McEuen, Maurer, Swiggart, Har
ris, Gartz, Scott, forwards; Townsend,

The Freshmen.
The preliminary game with the
Freshmen versus Lowell High School
was a melee from the word go. There
were occasional flashes of heady play
ing, and once or twice the backs show
ed some combination, but an as exhi
bition of Rugby the contest would
not rank very high. Substitutes were
used for practically every position.
The first score came at the end of
fifteen minutes of play from a passing
rush, Eyer to Templeton to Harris,
who went across. McGilvray convert
ed and the score board read S. 5, L. 0.
In the second half the Freshmen
were awarded a free kick on the Low
ell 25 yard line, and Townsend sent
the ball between the posts, adding
three points to the 1917 total. Lowel!
came back with a rush, and Turking
ton scored for his team. Knight con
verted and the final score was Fresh
men S, Lowell 5.
The lineups with first substitutes
were:
Freshmen: McGilvray, Baumgart
'ier, McEuen, Maurer, Swiggart, Har
ris, Gartz, Scott, forwards; Townsend,
llalt". Dickey. Gilory, five-eights; Eyer,
center: Templeton, Crary, wings;
Chapman, full.
Substitutes: Nagle, Halstead, Mc-
Nulty, Koener, Talboy, Hanunon, May
bury. Smitherum, Mudd, Gladstone.

(Franceschi), Clover, Vanderburg,
(Orme), Jacomini, (Pettingill), Dar

Fifty-five minutes were not enough
for the Stanford Varsity to cross their
opponent's goal line more than once
in their game with the Olympics on
Saturday, and the clubmen left the
field the victors in the initial Rugby
contest of the year with the score
5-3. The Varsity fifteen made a great
fight against a team that was heavier
and stronger in the scrum, and show
ed surprisingly good form in general
offensive work for a contest so early
in the season.
The Freshman game with Lowell
High ended in % 8 to 5 victory for
1917.
The Varsity game throughout, both
halves was largely confined to the
forwards, and the backfield rushes
were short and usually the result of
individual play rather than of com
bination. A pretty passing rush at
the end of the first two minutes of
play electrified the bleachers, Gard
securing the ball in a lineup on the
Olympic 25 yard line, passing to Aus
tin, who shot through the club de
fence and passed to Carroll, the sec
ond five going over the line for a try.
The goal was a very difficult one, and
Davidson failed to convert by the nar
row margin of a few inches, the ball
hitting the cross bar and bouncing 1
back.
The Cardinal triumph was short
lived. however, for before the end of
the half, while the play was deep in
the enemy's territory, Stolz, of the
Olympics, took advantage of a fum- !
ble, secured the ball and ran
down an open field for a try, placing '
the pigskin directly beneath the goal
posts. The conversion was an easy
one, and Cass added two points to the 1
clubmen's total.
With the score 5 to 3 against them J
when tho whistle blew for the second
half, the gray and black jerseyed
players carried the play into the ;
Olympic danger zone, and with the ex- 1
ception of short periods when the I
pack went back up the field, Stan- j
ford's hopes for a touch down ran '
high. Rut Hanley, the 'Winged 0' full
back, and others of the club backfield, 1
proved strong in defense, and the ball
did not cross their goal line. Toward
the last of the half the play centered
in the Stanford half of the field, and
the game ended with the ball at cen-«n
ter. with the honors even for the last,
period of thirty minutes.
In the Varsity scrum the good work
of Gard, Dajsie, Hall and Clover was
noticeable, and they were ably backed
up bv their first scrum mates and the
substitute forwards that, were soon
sent into the game. Austin and Car
roll were a speedy combination and
proved their going ability on more
than one occasion.
Coaches Presley and Brown used
tho second team men freely, and there
were few who lasted the fifty-five min
utes of play.
The 'Winged O' fifteen was probably
the fastest and most formidable ag
gregation of Rugby players that has
ever come to the campus under the
banner of the San Francisco club.
The forwards were heavy and experi
enced players, and the backfield was
la combination of flrst-rate players
who are still in the best of playing
condition and are not resting on past
laurels. "Stubby Stolz, '09, was
perhaps the most conspicuous player
on the field, but lie was ably seconded
in the back field by Hanley, Forbes,
Best, Cass and Risling. Palmer Ful
ler, '10, was the referee.

the enemy's territory, Stolz, of the
Olympics, took advantage of a fum- !
ble, secured the ball and ran
down an open field for a try, placing '
the pigskin directly beneath the goal
posts. The conversion was an easy
one, and Cass added two points to the 1
clubmen's total.
With the score 5 to 3 against them J
when tho whistle blew for the second
half, the gray and black jerseyed
players carried the play into the ;
Olympic danger zone, and with the ex- 1
ception of short periods when the I
pack went back up the field, Stan- j
ford's hopes for a touch down ran '
high. Rut Hanley, the 'Winged 0' full
back, and others of the club backfield, 1
proved strong in defense, and the ball
did not cross their goal line. Toward
the last of the half the play centered
in the Stanford half of the field, and
the game ended with the ball at cen-«n
ter. with the honors even for the last,
period of thirty minutes.
In the Varsity scrum the good work
of Gard, Dajsie, Hall and Clover was
noticeable, and they were ably backed
up bv their first scrum mates and the
substitute forwards that, were soon
sent into the game. Austin and Car
roll were a speedy combination and
proved their going ability on more
than one occasion.
Coaches Presley and Brown used
tho second team men freely, and there
were few who lasted the fifty-five min
utes of play.
The 'Winged O' fifteen was probably
the fastest and most formidable ag
gregation of Rugby players that has
ever come to the campus under the
banner of the San Francisco club.
The forwards were heavy and experi
enced players, and the backfield was
la combination of flrst-rate players
who are still in the best of playing
condition and are not resting on past
laurels. "Stubby Stolz, '09, was
perhaps the most conspicuous player
on the field, but lie was ably seconded
in the back field by Hanley, Forbes,
Best, Cass and Risling. Palmer Ful
ler, '10, was the referee.
The Freshmen.
The preliminary game with the
Freshmen versus Lowell High School
was a melee from the word go. There
were occasional flashes of heady play
ing, and once or twice the backs show
ed some combination, but an as exhi
bition of Rugby the contest would
not rank very high. Substitutes were
used for practically every position.
The first score came at the end of
fifteen minutes of play from a passing
rush, Eyer to Templeton to Harris,
who went across. McGilvray convert
ed and the score board read S. 5, L. 0.
In the second half the Freshmen
were awarded a free kick on the Low
ell 25 yard line, and Townsend sent
the ball between the posts, adding
three points to the 1917 total. Lowel!
came back with a rush, and Turking
ton scored for his team. Knight con
verted and the final score was Fresh
men S, Lowell 5.
The lineups with first substitutes
were:
Freshmen: McGilvray, Baumgart
'ier, McEuen, Maurer, Swiggart, Har
ris, Gartz, Scott, forwards; Townsend,

Fifty-five minutes were not enough
for the Stanford Varsity to cross their
opponent's goal line more than once
in their game with the Olympics on
Saturday, and the clubmen left the
field the victors in the initial Rugby
contest of the year with the score
5-3. The Varsity fifteen made a great
fight against a team that was heavier
and stronger in the scrum, and show
ed surprisingly good form in general
offensive work for a contest so early
in the season.
The Freshman game with Lowell
High ended in % 8 to 5 victory for
1917.
The Varsity game throughout, both
halves was largely confined to the
forwards, and the backfield rushes
were short and usually the result of
individual play rather than of com
bination. A pretty passing rush at
the end of the first two minutes of
play electrified the bleachers, Gard
securing the ball in a lineup on the
Olympic 25 yard line, passing to Aus
tin, who shot through the club de
fence and passed to Carroll, the sec
ond five going over the line for a try.
The goal was a very difficult one, and
Davidson failed to convert by the nar
row margin of a few inches, the ball
hitting the cross bar and bouncing 1
back.
The Cardinal triumph was short
lived. however, for before the end of
the half, while the play was deep in
the enemy's territory, Stolz, of the
Olympics, took advantage of a fum- !
ble, secured the ball and ran
down an open field for a try, placing '
the pigskin directly beneath the goal
posts. The conversion was an easy
