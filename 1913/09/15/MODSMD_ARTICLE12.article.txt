# WILL FOURTEEN MAN TEAM IMPROVE THE RUGBY GAME?
## VALUE OF TWO, THREE, TWO SCRUM IS DEBATED Coach Schaeffer Favors New Formation In Belief That It Will Open Up Game. 
### 
The seeming certainty of the adop
tion of a fourteen man team clause by
i the Intercollegiate Rugby Rules Com
-1 niittee with the important changes
! that might result from such an adop
! tion, lias given rise to a deal of specu
j lation and comment among the follow
j ers of the English game. That the use
of the seven man scrum, without the
wing forward, would change the play
seems generally conceded, but whetii
er the change would be for the better
or the worse is a point that can be
disputed.
It is obvious that such a change
would not place either college at a
disadvantage, as the elimination of
one forward would not seriously weak
en the team or break up a scoring
combination.
j The question reduces itself then to
this: Would a scrum without break
aways tend to make the play faster
and more open, better from the spec
; tator's point of view, or would the
.only result be the weakening of the
! forward division with a proportionate
i decrease in the importance of the
j scrum players?
Arguments against the elimination
of the breakaways or of the wing for
ward if that formation is used, seemed
jto be summed up in 'custom'. It is
i urged that Rugby is a game of years
jof development, and that practically
; every conceivable variation in the
playing rules has been given a tryont
.in tbe countries where Rugby has
reached its highest development. With
out the breakaways to smother the
I play of the opposing half, the game

could be compared to a changed Amer
ican football, with the center snapping
the ball to the quarterback without in
terefrence.
On (lie other hand, it has been a
matter of note to California Rugby
enthusiasts for the past year or two
