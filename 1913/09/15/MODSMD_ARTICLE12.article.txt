# WILL FOURTEEN MAN TEAM IMPROVE THE RUGBY GAME?
## VALUE OF TWO, THREE, TWO SCRUM IS DEBATED Coach Schaeffer Favors New Formation In Belief That It Will Open Up Game. 
### 
The seeming certainty of the adop
tion of a fourteen man team clause by
i the Intercollegiate Rugby Rules Com
-1 niittee with the important changes
! that might result from such an adop
! tion, lias given rise to a deal of specu
j lation and comment among the follow
j ers of the English game. That the use
of the seven man scrum, without the
wing forward, would change the play
seems generally conceded, but whetii
er the change would be for the better
or the worse is a point that can be
disputed.
It is obvious that such a change
would not place either college at a
disadvantage, as the elimination of
one forward would not seriously weak
en the team or break up a scoring
combination.
j The question reduces itself then to
this: Would a scrum without break
aways tend to make the play faster
and more open, better from the spec
; tator's point of view, or would the
.only result be the weakening of the
! forward division with a proportionate
i decrease in the importance of the
j scrum players?
Arguments against the elimination
of the breakaways or of the wing for
ward if that formation is used, seemed
jto be summed up in 'custom'. It is
i urged that Rugby is a game of years
jof development, and that practically
; every conceivable variation in the
playing rules has been given a tryont
.in tbe countries where Rugby has
reached its highest development. With
out the breakaways to smother the
I play of the opposing half, the game

could be compared to a changed Amer
ican football, with the center snapping
the ball to the quarterback without in
terefrence.
On (lie other hand, it has been a
matter of note to California Rugby
enthusiasts for the past year or two
that the game was not gaining greatly
in popularity with the non-college
world. Various reasons have been as
signed, but this one stands preeminent
—with the ball in forward play the
same seems more haphazard and is
not c o spectacular to the onlooker .is
the old American game; if the ball
dot's leave the scrum the passing rush
is usually nipped in the bud, and com
bined action by the entire line of
backs is a rare thing. To date only
one game has bet n played that shows
the ejects on the backfleld. In Sat
urday's contest on the California Field
the Blue and (iold varsity and the
Barbs played the fastest kind of Rugby
to it scoreless tie, with the play center
ing in the backlield.
In the opinion of Watts, the referee,
and Coach Schaeft'er the fast play was
due to the absence of breakaways, and
to the increased opportunities thus
•uvea the half.
The Stanford-Olympic contest 011 S;it
urady was not a factor in the trial of
the new formation, as the wing for
ward helped to block the play, and the
clubmen used tins "free agent" of tlie
forwards to keep the ball in the pack.
Another advantage often urged foi
tlio sevt n man scrum is the claim that
the forwards are able to break more
rapidly after tiie ball is out to the
half. While the rear rankers lose
most of their opportunities for spec
tacular play, they are better able 111
their changed positions to see the ball
in the scrum and so can judge more
accurately its probable direction.
If the change proposed is adopted
the referee will lie given the task of
throwing the bull into the scrum.
The tl»ito for the next meeting of tlie
Intercollegiate Rules Committee, when
the final vote will lie taken 011 the sev
en-man scrum clause, has not been
sot as yet, but a decision will probably
be reached in the next two weeks.

is usually nipped in the bud, and com

backs is a rare thing. To date only
one game has bet n played that shows
the ejects on the backfleld. In Sat
urday's contest on the California Field
the Blue and (iold varsity and the
Barbs played the fastest kind of Rugby
to it scoreless tie, with the play center
ing in the backlield.
In the opinion of Watts, the referee,
and Coach Schaeft'er the fast play was
due to the absence of breakaways, and
to the increased opportunities thus
•uvea the half.
The Stanford-Olympic contest 011 S;it
urady was not a factor in the trial of
the new formation, as the wing for
ward helped to block the play, and the
clubmen used tins "free agent" of tlie
forwards to keep the ball in the pack.
Another advantage often urged foi
tlio sevt n man scrum is the claim that
the forwards are able to break more
rapidly after tiie ball is out to the
half. While the rear rankers lose
most of their opportunities for spec
tacular play, they are better able 111
their changed positions to see the ball
in the scrum and so can judge more
accurately its probable direction.
If the change proposed is adopted
the referee will lie given the task of
throwing the bull into the scrum.

of the seven man scrum, without the
wing forward, would change the play
seems generally conceded, but whetii
er the change would be for the better
or the worse is a point that can be
disputed.
It is obvious that such a change
would not place either college at a
disadvantage, as the elimination of
one forward would not seriously weak

combination.

this: Would a scrum without break

and more open, better from the spec

.only result be the weakening of the
! forward division with a proportionate
i decrease in the importance of the
j scrum players?
Arguments against the elimination
of the breakaways or of the wing for

could be compared to a changed Amer
