An excellent example of what the
proper expression of bleacher spiiit

at Stanford should not be
was furnished 011 Saturday.
Opportunities for outbursts

oL' approval are usually limited so ear
ly in the playing season, but excuse
is missing for the utter lack of "pep
displayed 011 the bleachers. The lack
of spirit is not the only complaint.
W hen half of the Morris chair ath
letes become so numbed with cold 011
an afternoon when any Fahrenheit
regulator is well up past the blood
heat mark that an exodus is necessary
to the sunny side of the field, some
thing is wrong. It is marvellous what
martyrs the dear boys have been in
the past when they so magnanimously
kept their places with the thermome
ter batting around the ice producing
point and responded to the yell lead
ers' exhortations for a varsity on the
kick-off. Sinct it seems impossible to
steam heat the bleachers it might be
desirable that a little cardinal hued
fluid be put into circulation 011 the
bleachers and so avoid the necessity
of the hegira across the turf.
The Yell leader is not alone in his
protestations over the conduct of his
charges on Saturday, but the Gradu
ate Manager has notified us that in
the future if it is necessary to emi
grate the travelers must keep off the
grass. To those, we should like to say
a few, but can not, who so forgot
themselves to trample on the gerani
ums planted along the bleachers re
primand might not go amiss. Pedes
trians are privileged to utilize the
proper exits and entrances.
