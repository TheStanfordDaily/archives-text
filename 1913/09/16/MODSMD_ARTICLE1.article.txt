Had Long Service.
As a member of the faculty Pro
fessor Newcomer was one of the oldest
professors in regard to service in the
university, lie came to Stanford in
1891 and was one of the pioneers who
grew up with the university. As a
personal friend of the students and
one who understood the individuals
in his classes Professor Newcomer ob
tained his best results through his
personal contact with the students.
For the past seven years Professor
Newcomer was head of the English
department. This semester he asked
that he be relieved of the duties in
order that lie might pursue research
work, and Professor William H. Car
ruth. of Kansas University was made
head of the department. If Professor
Newcomer had returned this semester
he would have entered upon his twen
ty-filth year as a teacher.
More and more of recent years Pro
fessor Newcomer has centered his in
terest on the works of Shakespeare.
This has particularly taken the form
of a new discovery of means by which
the vexed passages are interpreted
and explained by Shakespeare him
self. In the case of disputed pas
sages. where many explanations are
offered and none are satisfactory. Pro
fessor Newcomer has found parallel
readings from other plays of Shakes
peare's which show the author's own
use of the words in question.
Was Editing Shakespeare.
At the time of liis death Professor
Newcomer was engaged in editing
"Much Ado About Noothing" on this
principle. Every disputed passage, of
which there are many, received some
light from parallel passages in other
plays.
The exploitation of this method is
his own plan and makes him distinc
tive among Shakespearian scholars
for his contributions to literature.
Professor Newcomer has made fre
quent contributions of late to modern
philology publications and to other
technical magazines. He has also con
tributed interesting views of great
value to "The Dial", a Chicago publi
cation.
