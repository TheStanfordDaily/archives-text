For the second time within a short
interval the name of a member of the
University faculty has been stricken
from the Faculty roll by the drawing
of Life's frail curtain. Professor Al
fonso Newcomer, for tyventy-two years
a member of the English department,
is the latest to lie summoned by the
Master.
Coming to Stanford in the days
when the Pioneers had just assem
bled, lie served through the formula
tive period of the University. Be
cause of his own analytical mind, he
was able to impress the deeper signifi
cance of his subjects upon those who
attended his classes. His scholail>
work backed by the genuineness of
bis quiet personality left its import
on those who came in contact with
him. Sincere, unselfish and modest,
Professor Newcomer was beloved by
his associates and students.
