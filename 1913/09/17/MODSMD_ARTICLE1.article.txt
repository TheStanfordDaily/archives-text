# PALO ALTANS DEFEAT FIRST-YEAR RUGBY MEN
## CLEVER HIGH SCHOOL RUGGERS TAKE MATCH. Freshmen Forced to Take Short End of 23-0 Score This Afternoon. 
### 
The fourteen men who represented
1917 on the Rugby field this afternoon
proved no match for the clever Rug
gers of Palo Alto High, and after 45
minutes of play the score read 23-0
against them. The game did not de
velop football of even second rate or
der, though the high school players
showed passing and kicking ability
and a willingness to follow up the ball.
The Freshmen were able to offer no
opposition worthy of the name.
Gladstone kicked off for the Fresh
men, but with the return play went at
once into their territory and the goal
line was threatened. Palo Alto out
played the first year Ruggers in every
department of the game, but overeag
erness prevented scoring for ten min
utes. The first score was the result of
a passing rush, Weeks, Card, Olaine
to Slocum, who went across. Boul
ware converted. Score 5-0.
Palo Alto was given a free kick in
the 1917 twenty-yard line, and Boul
ware booted a goal. Score 8-0.
The second half proved no better a
time for Freshman fight than the first
20 minutes, and O'Laine soon scor
ed for Palo Alto, a good passing rush
sending him across. The same player
failed to convert.
Another three points were added by
Weeks, who scored from a five-yard
scrimmage. On the kick, the ball
went clear of the posts, and the score
stood 14-0.
Green was the next man to score,
and was followed at once by Owen.
Score 20-0.
The remaining ten minutes gave
"Pally" lliree more points, the final
score reading 23-0.
