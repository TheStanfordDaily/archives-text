mast, and all classes in the depart
ments of Entomology and English

At the house services Dr. Flugel, in
a very touching address paid a sincere
tribute to Professor Newcomer. Pro
fessor Bassett read Tennyson's
"Crossing the Bar."
The services were private. The
members of the English department
and their wives, older members of the
faculty and a few Intimate friends
were the only ones in attendance.
Members of the faculty of the English
department acted as pall bearers.
The deep personal esteem with
which Dr. Newcomer was regarded by
those who knew him well is exhibited
in the following personal tributes
from his friends:
Professor Newcomer was a tine
scholar, an able teacher, an inspiring
writer, a man of highest ideals, toler
ant, helpful, retiring, and unassuming.
J. C. Branner,
When 1 consider what was the
strongest characteristic of him, 1 find
that it was purity. What a wonderful
judge of style he was; what a never
failing judge of poetry; what a po.it
he was himself. A true poet in his
heart and soul, his refined soul show
ed, as 1 had occasion to observe, in
the management of affairs in the de
partment of which he was the leader.
ITis leadership there was characterized
! _ .
by conscientiousness and considerate
ness. The same considerateness, th;
! same tact, the same gentleness, lie
showed in his intercourse with his
students. And how refining and ele-
I vating an influence has been emanat
ing from his personality, during this
first epoch of Stanford University life,
cannot and can never be calculated.
His itrong beneficent influence for the
souls and minds of his students is one
of the great facts of Stanford life and
shall never he forgotten.
Edward Flugel.
I have known Alphonso Gerald New
| Comer for thirty-five years, r was
I first, his teacher, and for twenty-two
j years 1 have been his colleague at
Stanford. He was my brother's most
intimate friend. I have never known
a man of purer soul, of finer intellect
ual power, or of more worthy life.
Fernando Sanford.
Professor Newcomer's death conies
as a most intimate, personal loss to
all the members of the English depart
ment. Each year that we have worked
together and each time that we met
him in conference over our depart
ment affairs or in social intercourse
we felt more closely drawn to him.
He was not a man who revealed his
heart at once; only those who were
privileged to know him through years
of association came really to appreci
ate the pure gold of his character. V.'u
never came away from his house with
out having had our affections touched
1 y his simplicity, his gentleness, his
deep-hearted interest in all our com
mon problems. Howard .Tudson Hall.
