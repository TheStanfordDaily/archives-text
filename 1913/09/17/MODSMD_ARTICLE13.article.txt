Recognition of the labors expended

by the men who devote their
spare time to forensic activi
ties has come in the shape of

a plan announced last evening. Men
who make the intercollegiate teams
may, by registering in the course on
Oral Expression, receive an additional
two hours of credit for the work they
do in preparation for their debates.
Members of the debating societies who
are registered in Oral Expression are
to be siven an extra hour of credit
provided they participate in at least
four debates in their society duriti -
the semester. The debating activities
are to be under Faculty supervision.
Interest in debating at Stanford has
been on a low ebb for the last few
years, and the granting of University
credit by the Faculty is commendable.
It. will do much to raise the standard
of public speaking and oratory at
Stanford.
