# Prompt Response Prevents Big Blaze
## 
### 
Sparks from a chimney falling on a
dry roof caused a fire at, the Pi Beta
; '!ii house late this- afternoon. In ad
dition to damage done to the roof, con
siderable loss was occasioned by water
which was copiously supplied by the
campus fire brigade. Prompt work on
the part of the "re volunteers pro
vented what promised to be a more
serious blaze.
