### 
Graduate Manager R. W. Wilcox to
day announced the regulations cov
ering the sale of seats for the big
same to members of the Stanford
Student Body alumni. There have
been a number of changes made in the
scheme of ticket distribution, with the

the public sale taking the best seats
from the students, and in cutting down
the number of tickets purchased only
for resale.
The main feature of the new plan is
the filing of applications for all seats,
and the filling of the orders by lot
and not in the order of receipt. Stud
ents, faculty and alumni are given
from September 22 until October 11 to
file their applications for either root
ers', women's, or general sections, dif
ferent colored cards being provided
for the different sections. The orders
will then lie tilled by chance drawing
and the tickets will be ready for dis
tribution by October 25.
The regulations follow:
The Stanford management will have
on sale the east half of the Stanford
field.
Price—-All tickets will be $2.50 each,
except rooters' tickets, which will be
$2.00 each.
App/icutions—All tickets will be
sold ONLY on written applications,
accompanied by cash, check, or money
order. Students and faulty members
desiring seats either in rootertl, wom
en's, or general sections will apply for
