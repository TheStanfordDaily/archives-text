# BIG GAME SEATS.
## 
### 
An absolutely changed system of
selling seats to the Big Game lias been
devised by Graduate Manager Wilcox.
The details of the plan, which differs
materially from the system used in
the past, is printed in another column.
One of the chief points in the new
scheme is the elimination of the con
fusion occasioned by the drawing of
tickets on the Quad. Hereafter the
apportioning of the seats will be done
by a chance drawing held in the office
of the Graduate Manager. Handling
of orders for tickets to the game will
be simplified and the holders of season
tickets are given a preference in ob
taining seats. A careful perusal of
the plan as outlined will obviate un
necessary questions.
