Less than a week ago the apparent
unpreparedness of the campus fire de
partment was made noticable by the
first alarm of the semester. Yester
day the volunteers were brought out
by what gave promise of developing
into a disastrous blaze. Only the
promptness of the fire fighters and the
able directions of .1. E. Hewston. Farm
Superintendent, and his assistant, O.
S. Warner, Superintendent of Con
struction, prevented a heavy loss. At
present the campus lire department is
under the supervision of Mr .Hewston,
and in his absence Mr. Warner. Fur
ther than this little provision lias been
made in the matter of organization.
Why would not this be a proper time
for the authorities to give Mr. Hews
ton a commission to organize a corns
from the students and place men un
der his supervision at different sta
tions with regular hours to meet the
exigencies of any occasion?
