# OLYMPIC CLUB SEVERS RELATIONS WITH U.C
## 
### 
Football relations between the Uni
versity of California anil the Olympic
Club have apparently been severed,
judging from the published action of
the football committee of the San
Francisco club, cancelling the game
scheduled for Saturday because of
trouble over the substitute rule.
Coach Schaeffer, of California, has
refused to limit himself in the matter
of substitutes to be used against the
club team, and as the 'Winged O' com
mittee insists that no more second
men shall be put in the game than
were used by Coach Urown last Satur
day, the contestants are deadlocked.
Ten men is the limit for which the
Olympics are holding out, but even the
suggestion of limitation proved obnox
ious to the California coach.
Yesterday's action does not specify
the game scheduled for October 25, but
it is not likely that a settlement will be
reached.
