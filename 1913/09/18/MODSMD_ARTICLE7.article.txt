## CUPS ARE OFFERED FOR ANNUAL MEET. Executive Committee Places Sport on Interclass Basis, Providing Fifteen Men Enter. 
### 
I Cross country running was placed
on the firmest basis the sport has
enjoyed : ince its inauguration two
years ago when the Executive Com
mittee placed it on an interclass foot
ing last night.
The following motion was moved
and carried: "That cross country run
ning be put on an interclass basis,
i classes having privileges of granting
,class sweaters for first seven places
providing fifteen men enter."
This means that the classes will not
have to award the class numerals un
less they deem fit but they may do so.
The proviso has been inserted that fif
teen men must enter the meet. This
is only one-half the number which left
the tape last November on the four
and one-half mile grind.
At the present time about fifty men
are working out three times a week
in anticipation of the November meet.
The runners are under the direct su
pervision of F. L. Foster, '13, and .).
M. Cox. '14. These men finished third
and second respectively in last year's
test.
Not inly will class numerals be
awarded this year, but several Palo
Alto merchants have offered to award
cups to tho firs. men who cross the
line.
