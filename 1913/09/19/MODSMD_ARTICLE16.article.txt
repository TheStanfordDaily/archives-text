Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Sir Edward Grey wears enormous
side-whiskers. George Ade, on seeing
Edward for the lirst time, exclaimed:
"Wal, a hairlip is an infirmity, a club
fist is a deformity, but side-whiskers
are a man's own fault."
We are led to so remark concern
ing men's coats at Leland Stanford.
An old Latin adage "Vestis viriim
fecit" corresponds to the ancient Eng
lish saying: "Fine feathers make fine
birds." Shaksepeare said, "Through
tattered clothes small vices do ap
pear. Robes and furred gowns hide
all." Contradicted in part by Sir Wal
ter Raleigh, who declared: "No man
is esteemed for gay garments but by
fools and women." Here is expressed
the only reason, 1 suppose, why super
fluous clothes are worn by men.
Ida M. Tarbell lays down three car
dinal principles of dress as follows:
1. Fitness of dress depends upon
occasion.
2. Beauty of dress depends upon line
and color.
'A. Ethics of dress depend upon
quality and size of purse.
Which explains the purpose of the
letter and constrains us to ask, "In
the name of fitness, beauty, and ethics,
WHY THESE COATS?"
The source of our complaint lies in
two facts about Stanford life just at
present; viz, excessive heat, and the
reluctance of the men in discarding
coats when in the Quad. Library or
dining room, and in classes where
girls are in evidence.
Now we insist that, on a hot day, a
coat is neither necessary, beautiful,
ethical or agreeable, and, aside from
the convenience afforded by the si>:
pockets it contains, could well be dis
pensed with.
We are willing lo concede that not
all days are hot and that not all men
wish to go without coats. We suggest

levertlieless that there are enough to
warrant such manner of change in
the prevailing custom that men who
wish to may appear in the aforesaid
places minus their coats with clear
consciences.
One studies in one's room usually in
negligee—and studies better by reason
thereof. If said one could remove his
coat in the library and be allowed to
assume the same shirt-sleeve atti
tude toward his books that he would
toward an axe and a wood-pile there
would he less ineffectual effort and
more study.
Kipling tells of an Englishman liv
ing alone at a remote Himalayan sta
tion who used to dress for dinner "to
maintain" his "self-respect". Char
lotte Gilman (we're not acquainted
with her either) remarks that "you
might respect a king, a general, or a
policeman by his clothes, but not
yourself", because you know too well
what is in them. Why should Stan
ford students keep up an irksome cus
tom when they know each other so
well?
The high silk hat preceded civili
zation. When a missionary wants to
show how far China has progressed
he exhibits a photo of the Chief of
Staff dressed in stiff shirt and dress
suit. "When a nation has once grown
habituated to the patent leather shoe
and the four-in-hand it should have no
trouble about the intricacies of its
Parliament".
All of which foregoing stuff is of
course the sarcasm based on the fact
that too much we lay stress on dress,
sacrifice comfort and even beauty, for
clothes and the desire to look "con
ventional."
We misht argue for the independ
ence in dress —as a sort of peroration.
We'll content ourselves with the ask
ing for a change in convention suffi
cient to accommodate the needs of
persons who don't like to add clothes
to climate.
In other words. "WHY THESE
COATS?"
Cordially yours
NEGLIGEE.
