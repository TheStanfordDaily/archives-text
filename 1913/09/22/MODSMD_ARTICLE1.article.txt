# VARSITY TAKES FAST GAME FROM BARBS ON SATURDAY
## THREE CONTESTS GIVE RUGBY FANS THREE FILL. Santa Clara Outplays Second Team. Freshmen Easily Defeat Mission High. 
### 
Rugby fans had their inning on
Saturday afternoon, when three games
were staged on Stanford Field, the
Cardinal being victorious in two of
them. The main event was the Var
sity-Barbs contest, and the bleacher
ites were justly elated when the col
lege team annexed the long end of an
8 to 3 score, after the most exciting
match of the season.
The second team was not so suc
cessful against Santa Clara, the Mis
sion players running through the Car
dinal defense for three tries, and each
try was converted. Thus the score
read 15 to 0.
The Freshmen fought hard against
Mission High to redeem their defeat
of Wednesday, and were able to leave
the field as victors, 13-0.
The Varsity.
The Barbarians proved a strong
combination, and their offense and
defense were enough to extend the
Stanford team to the limit. The game
was fairly open, the forwards proved
themselves a second backfield when
the ball got out of the scrum, and
the passing was good for the second
game of the season. A number of
pretty plays were spoiled by offside
penalties.
Austin scored first for the Varsity,
going across the line after intercept
ing a short kick at the Barbs' 20 yard
mark. 11. Brown converted.
The second try was a more spectac
ular one. A dribbling rush, Clover,
Gard and Andrews, carried the ball
to their opponent's 35 yard line,
where Peck picked up, passed to Aus
tin, to Gard, who scored. Brown fail
ed to convert, and Stanford's eight
points had been made.
The Barbs scored in the second half,
Momsen getting the pigskin at the
Cardinal 45, and passing to Lopez,
who made the try. The attempt at con
version failed, and the score read 8-:'.
The Second Team.
Milburn, Ybarrando and Hardy were
the Santa Clara trio who were direct
ly responsible for the 15 points rolled
up against the second team. Milburn
made the first score from a 20 yard
scrum, Ybarrando converting. The
next try was made in the second half,
Curtin intercepting a pass in Mis
sion territory and starting down an
open field with the ball, lie passed
to Milburn, who covered most of the
distance and passed to Hardy, who
scored. Ybarrando converted.
Milburn scored again when Detels
failed to stop a rush, and the try was
converted. Score 15 to 0.
The Freshmen.
The Freshmen made two tries in
the first half of their game. Day scor
ing the first and Huttman the second.
The first conversion was easy, but
McGilvray failed in the second. Score
8-0.

ites were justly elated when the col
lege team annexed the long end of an
8 to 3 score, after the most exciting
match of the season.
The second team was not so suc
cessful against Santa Clara, the Mis
sion players running through the Car
dinal defense for three tries, and each
try was converted. Thus the score
read 15 to 0.
The Freshmen fought hard against
Mission High to redeem their defeat
of Wednesday, and were able to leave
the field as victors, 13-0.
The Varsity.
The Barbarians proved a strong
combination, and their offense and
defense were enough to extend the
Stanford team to the limit. The game
was fairly open, the forwards proved
themselves a second backfield when
the ball got out of the scrum, and
the passing was good for the second
game of the season. A number of
pretty plays were spoiled by offside
penalties.
Austin scored first for the Varsity,
going across the line after intercept
ing a short kick at the Barbs' 20 yard
mark. 11. Brown converted.
The second try was a more spectac
ular one. A dribbling rush, Clover,
Gard and Andrews, carried the ball
to their opponent's 35 yard line,
where Peck picked up, passed to Aus
tin, to Gard, who scored. Brown fail
ed to convert, and Stanford's eight
points had been made.
The Barbs scored in the second half,
Momsen getting the pigskin at the
Cardinal 45, and passing to Lopez,
who made the try. The attempt at con
version failed, and the score read 8-:'.
The Second Team.
Milburn, Ybarrando and Hardy were
the Santa Clara trio who were direct
ly responsible for the 15 points rolled
up against the second team. Milburn
made the first score from a 20 yard
scrum, Ybarrando converting. The
next try was made in the second half,
Curtin intercepting a pass in Mis
sion territory and starting down an
open field with the ball, lie passed
to Milburn, who covered most of the
distance and passed to Hardy, who
scored. Ybarrando converted.
Milburn scored again when Detels
failed to stop a rush, and the try was
converted. Score 15 to 0.
The Freshmen.
The Freshmen made two tries in
the first half of their game. Day scor
ing the first and Huttman the second.
The first conversion was easy, but
McGilvray failed in the second. Score
8-0.
