# VARSITY TAKES FAST GAME FROM BARBS ON SATURDAY
## THREE CONTESTS GIVE RUGBY FANS THREE FILL. Santa Clara Outplays Second Team. Freshmen Easily Defeat Mission High. 
### 
Rugby fans had their inning on
Saturday afternoon, when three games
were staged on Stanford Field, the
Cardinal being victorious in two of
them. The main event was the Var
sity-Barbs contest, and the bleacher

8 to 3 score, after the most exciting
match of the season.
The second team was not so suc

sion players running through the Car
dinal defense for three tries, and each
try was converted. Thus the score
read 15 to 0.
The Freshmen fought hard against
Mission High to redeem their defeat
of Wednesday, and were able to leave
the field as victors, 13-0.

defense were enough to extend the
Stanford team to the limit. The game
was fairly open, the forwards proved
themselves a second backfield when

the passing was good for the second
game of the season. A number of
pretty plays were spoiled by offside
penalties.
Austin scored first for the Varsity,
going across the line after intercept

The second try was a more spectac
