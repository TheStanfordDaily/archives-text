Results count. Student self govern
ment at Stanford lias been on ti iiil
for a year. It is a success. But
whether or not it is to continue to
a success rests with the men who are
the governed and those who are to as
sume the none too pleasant task oi
meting out justice to those who
transgress the rules of ordained con
duct. Any form of rule is decreed a
success or failure by its accomplish
ments for the general welfare ol the
governed. Practically every system

of rule has its advant
ages and its defects. A
system is generally

good or bad as the men who are in
control are examples of good or evil.
Self government at Stanford is un
der the supervision of the University
Conference composed of a stated num
ber of upperclass representatives
from the various departments. From
this body is chosen the quintet who
are designated as the Student Council.
Tomorrow members are to be chosen
from a large number of departments
to till vacancies on the Conference.
The type of man who is needed on
the Conference is the man who under
stands the sentiments of the under
graduates and is able at the same time
to impartially pass judgment on the
acts of his fellow-student.
Experience is an excellent instruct
or. and some of the men whose terms
expire could be of valuable aid if they
were reelected to the Conference. In
the power of the qualified voters rests
the fabric of student control. Elect
the proper men, but before you ballot
take a long, critical, second look over
the available candidates.
