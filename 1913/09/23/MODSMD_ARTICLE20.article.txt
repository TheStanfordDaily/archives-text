# FRESHMEN AND VARSITY SQUADS AGAIN DIVIDED.
## 
### 
Both the Varsity and the Freshmen
Rugby squads have been divided, and
hereafter the sections will practice
separately. Coach Floyd Brown. '11,
states that the division is in no way to
lie considered as a cutting down of
the squad, and that men in either of
the second divisions have a chance to
make the teams as long as they con
tinue practice. Those whose names
do not fall into the Varsity or Fresh
men divisions are urged to continue
work, which will be carefully coached.
About sixty Ruggers have been
picked to work with the Varsity sec
tion, and forty Freshmen will be re
tained an the turf field. The other
candidates will practice on the auxili
ary iield.
Practice on the auxiliary field will
he directed by competent men, and
available material developed there
will be sent at once to report with
the other squads. Two or three
games will be played each week by
the teams made up from the outer
field divisions. There will be games
with outside teams as well as inter
squad contests.
