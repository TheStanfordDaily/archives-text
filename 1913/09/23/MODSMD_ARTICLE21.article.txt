# SEATS FOR "TYRANNY OF TEARS" SELLING RAPIDLY.
## 
### 
Beginning immediately after the
drawing of numbers yesterday after
noon, the sale of seats for "The Tyr
anny of Tears" has been heavy. The
crowd at Weingartner's at noon yes
terday was rather small, but is wis
composed almost entirely of college
people, nlid the steady demand for
tickets by the Palo Alto people dur
ing the afternoon and this morning
was such that the audience which
greets the Sword and Sandals' produc
tion will be a record one.
The high standard set by Sword and
Sandals in its plays in the past and
the popularity of the present play and
cast is combining to fill the house for
next Friday evening.
