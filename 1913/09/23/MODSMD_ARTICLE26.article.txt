# TRAINING RULES FOR A COLLEGE ATHLETE.
## 
### (By H.W. Maloney 
Sleep .—A college athlete should
have at least eight hours sleep. A
good time to retire is about 11 p.m.
(allowance might be made for a later
hour —say on Saturday night.)
Exercise—The work on the foot
ball field or track eacli afternoon is
usually suflicient to keep one in good
| condition. However, simple correct
ive gymnastics, together with breath
ing exercises taken two or three times
, a week, are very beneficial to an ath
lete in training.
Bathing.—Nothing is so invigorat
ing to the body as the daily shower.
A warm (not hot) shower is the best,
followed by a COLD shower; this
should be followed again by a brisk
rub with a turkish towel.
Diet.—There is quite a variety of
foods that, a college athlete can eat
with advantage. He should, however,
refrain from eating pastries and can
dies. Eat very liberally of such foods
as roast lamb, chicken, beef, (not too
raw), broiled steaks or chops, poach
ed or boiled eggs, vegetables, fruits
such as apples, oranges, figs, French
prunes (but not with cream), walnuts,
raisins, etc.
Tobacco.—With reference to tobac
co, experts differ. A committee of
physicians in London, England, re
cently reported that a cigarette yield
ed only .06 per cent of nicotine and
the pipe from 37 to .">7 per cent, but
the cigarette was very irritating to
the throat. They also reported that
"the cigar was without doubt the
least injurious form of smoking."
Moderation then seems to be the
keynote—or self control; and where
would one expect to find this virtue
of self control more prevalent than
in a college student? To those who
smoke, however, r would say, NEVER
(with strong emphasis) smoke on an
empty stomach. There should posi
tively be no smoking for at least one
month before a hard athletic contest,
such as an intercollegiate game.
Milk.—The following is a quotation
from an article prepared by Professor
\V r . O. Atwater, F. S. Department of
Agriculture: "Milk is peculiarly
adapted for use as a food. It. con
tains all four classes of nutrients: —
protein, fats, carbohydrates, and min
eral matters". An athlete who wishes
to increase in weight should drink at
least one quart of milk daily. Milk
should be sipped and not gulped. A
glass of warm milk just before retir
ing, especially after hard study, will
usually bring on refreshing sleep.
Don't—.lnst a few "don'ts.
Don't study during your meals, re
member the stomach requires all the
blood it can get to help digest your
food, without chasing any of it up to
the brain.
Don't gobble your food, but masti
cate it, thoroughly.
Don't eat between meals, unless it
be an apple or a glass of milk.
Don't fail to become enthusiastic
with your athletics—enthusiasm is
the best tonic for tired nerves; it is
also a dynamo for human energy.
These simple training rules faith
fully carried out will surely bring
beneficial results.
