### 
Action in "The Tyranny of Tears"
all takes place at the home of the
Parburys* and the unity of action, re
quiring only two shifts of scenery,
will greatly hasten the action of the
play 011 Friday evening and will re
move one of the objections to amateur
theatricals —the long waits usually
necessary between acts. The first act
opens upon the study of Parbury,
where he is dictating to his secretary
a criticism he is writing for one of
the leading magazines. The second
and fourth acts are also laid in this
room.
The third scene is laid in the gar
den of the home. Here an opportuni
ty is given for making an excellent
setting for some of the best lines of
the play which the stage managers
are taking full advantage of.
The sale of seats is progressing
rapidly, but tickets are still to be had
at the Bookstore and in Palo Alto.
