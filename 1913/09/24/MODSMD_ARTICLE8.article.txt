# SEVEN MAN SCRUM PLAN REJECTED BY COMMITTEE
## CALIFORNIA BALKS AT CHANGE IN FOOTBALL RILES Fifteen Players Will Be Used . International Difficulties Fatal To New Formation. 
### 
The proposed "seven man scrum"
agreement, which would have limited
the Rugby teams of Stanford and Cal
ifornia to fourteen men in the annual
football contest, was last night re
jected by the Intercollegiate Rules
Committee at their second meeting in
San Francisco. The immediate cause
for the abandonment of the new plan
was the ultimatum delivered by the
representatives of the University of
California, which stated that the Rug
by authorities of the state institution
would no longer consider the adoption
of a seven man scrum.
The decision came as a surprise to
the followers of the game at both
Berkeley and Stanford, for Coach
Shaeffer had been quoted as saying
that the elimination of the breakaways
would work wonders in the opening
up of the play, while Coach Presley
and Coach Brown were known to
favor the change. However, the stand
taken by the California representa
tives left no other course open to the
committee as a whole than the rejec
tion of the tentative agreement and
the return to the rules of straight
I Rugby caliber.
The first reason given by the Cali
j fornia men as an irrefutable argu-
I ment in favor of the eight-man forma
j tion was its international adoption by
j Rugby teams. Any change that would
| have any material effect on the style
of play would be a departure from the
i
| recognized English standard, and as
i such would prove a detriment, it was
j said.
A second argument made was the
, anticipated difficulty in reaching an
agreement with visiting teams, as the
j New Zealanders, who will play both
universities in October. It is mani
festly unfair to visitors to require
them to change their team formation.',
and if not changed the eight man
scrum would have a great advantage
over the seven man formation, play
ing without the wing forward.
The fourteen man team is said by
the California coaches to have arous
ed a, great ileal of unfavorable com
ment on the part of the college men
i and general public. This is in mark-
I ed contrast to the reception accorded
the new formation 011 Stanford Field.
And so the Rugby games on Stanford
Field and on California Field will be
the old type, with the 'straight' 3-2-.'!
