# Still Or Out
## 
### 
In this column we print a com
munication from a "Music Lover'

who rightfully takes occasion
to criticise certain persons, pos
sibly university students and
possibly not. who disturb the
daily organ recitals. We do

not agree with our communicant's
statement in its entirety. Hut we are
in accord with the sentiment tliat
those who find it impossible, even out
of deference for the organist or a
reverence for sacred music, should
either remain away or remain quiet.
What is the reason for these "marks
of savagery" as our correspondent
titles them? Mere forgetfulness or
wilfulness?
