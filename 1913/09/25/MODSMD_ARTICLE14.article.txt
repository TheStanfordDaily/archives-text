If we are to join with Europeans in
the belief that America is a nation of
barbarians we will still expect to find
the marks of savagery a little more
carefully varnished over in a college
community than otherwise. But cer
tain things that happen daily at Stan
ford lead us to question our right to
even this last consolation.
Your true barbarian takes delight in
the profanation of sanctuaries. Or
worse still, his lumbering wits fail to
point out to him the difference be
tween a cathedral and a shop. Now,
shall we brand as ignorant or mali
cious the daily disturbance of the As
sembly organ recitals?
Within two weeks workmen will
commence the moving of the organ
from the Assembly Hall to the Memo
rial Church. Some of the students
know that the time the work is in
progress will be a desert of silence
and just now ihey are anxious to en
joy just so much of the music as re
mains to them before the removal be
gins. Why then should their after
noons with the organ be disturbed by
the giggling and whispering barbar
ians who drop in because they have
nothing else to do? Why should these
triflers stamp down the aisle during
the playing of a selection, strike up
a conversation that becomes distinct
ly audible when the music falls to its
softest notes, and then romp out
again while the organ is still play
ing?
The glorious music of the organ is
calculated to inspire reverence and
awe in minds capable of these emo
tions. To such as cannot attain to
these feelings we say. with all the
emphasis italics can give. KEEP
STILL OR KEEP OUT.
Music Lover.
