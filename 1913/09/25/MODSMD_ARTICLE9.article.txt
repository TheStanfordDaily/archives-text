# ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING LABORATORY BEING BUILT
## EQUIPMENT WILL TAKE CARE OF HIGH VOLTAGE TESTS New Structure and Fittings Will Give Department Opportunity for Extensive Experiments. 
### 
A high tension laboratory for the
of tlie Electrical Engineering de
partment is at present in course of
construction. The building is 36 feet
by 50 feet and lias a height of 17 feet.
Tbe floor is of concrete and drained
towards (be center to take care of
water used in experiments on high
voltage line insulators demanding
conditions of rainfall. Removable
seats are provided for a class of 50.
Lightproof doors and window shut
ters will make artificial night condi
tions for corona experiments. The
north and west walls are windowless,
providing for metal facing which is
to form the ground sheet for an ample
high voltage air condenser, to lie used
for the delivery of high voltage im
pacts upon line insulators.
Appended to the building is a
storehouse and a 90 by 300 foot yard.
The yard will be used for outside ex
perimentation on high voltage lines.
It will lie enclosed by a high open
fence for safety guard. A hooded op
ening in the west wall S by 12 feet
will serve to make the connections
through.
Eventually it is planned to install
r»00,000 volt equipment. This will
break through 50 inches of atmos
phere and consequently calls for
much space to work in. The two 6(i,-
"00 and the 33,000 volt transformers
now in use will be transferred to the
new building. These will furnish
It! 5,000 volts —one terminal grounded
—and will develop electric line stress
es equivalent to those produced by
330,000 volts —neutral grounded. Two
175,000 volt units are planned for
later on. This will lie ample to test
to destruction any full sized modern
suspension insulators.
During the past year tbe depart
ment. has developed with the aid of
a Poulsen oscillating current gener
ator, an equipment for the production
of 100,000 volts sustained at high fre
quencies of 50,000 to 200.000 cycles
per second. The Poulsen generator
was presented by C. F. Ehvell, '07.
The entire outfit as now developed
will be transferred to the new labor
atory for the study of obscure but an
noying high frequency troubles on
transmission lines.
