That the Trustees of the University
might come into closer contact with
the other elements which make up
tiie university family and at the same
time do homage to the man who has
been selected as Stanford's second
president, the twenty-second anniver
sary of the founding of the university

was chosen as a fitting time
for the installation of Presi
dent Branner. The four ele
ments in the university—Trus-

tees, Faculty, Alumni, and Undergrad
uates —are to come together and min
gle on terms of equality. Distinction
of class, position or superiority of
rank are to he forgotten in the truly
Stanford way in an endeavor to make
the day stand for what is truly the
Stanford expression of democratic
ideals. The Trustees, men of affairs,
husy with their own vast interests,
did not set the day apart for general
recreation time. They are to be pres
ent. These men have done their
share toward making the occasion
one or the most distinctive in the his
tory of the university. If the cere
monies are to stand for that which
the Trustees intend them to, the Un
dergraduates must do their part. On
the morning of the installation each
class will have a place reserved for
its members. This will be the first
time that the classes have ever been
assembled in such a manner. The
Trustees have shown us their interest
in our welfare. It is incumbent upon
every Stanford man and woman to bo
in attendance.
