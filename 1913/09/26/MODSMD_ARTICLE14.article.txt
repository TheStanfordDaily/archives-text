# Musicians to Be Comfortable.
## 
### 
My a unanimous vote the Mandolin
club members have decided to dis
card the traditional full dress suit
raiment and adopt in its stead white
flannel trousers, soft shirts, and bow
ties. This will be the costume of the
clubmen during the warm weather at
least. The Mandolin club is to make
its first appearance of the semester
on the evening of the installation of
President Branner.
