Editor Daily Palo Alto:
At the service last evening Dr. Flu
gel alluded in terms of high praise to
Professor Newcomer's Memorial Ode,
read at the Founders' Day Exercises
iu 1894—the year after Senator Stan
ford's death. Possibly some of Mr.
Newcomer's students now in the uni
versity may he glad to know where
the poem is to be found. It was pub
lished in the '96 Quad, and so far as
I know has not been reprinted. Some
day it will have the place of honor
it deserves in an anthology of Stan
ford verse, for nowhere has the Stan
ford spirit been so nobly voiced as in
this tine ode.s^
I well remember the occasion when
it was read. An ex-president of the
United States delivered an address,
but the only striking thing he said
was the somewhat superfluous asser
tion, uttered with mighty emphasis,
that "Perpetuity is essential to an
endless work."
It was Mr. Newcomer's ode that
made the day really memorable. Few
of those who heard him read it can
have forgotten these fine lines—
"Mute majesty of guardian towers,
and sweep
Of arcades gleaming afar in pillared
pride,
And beauty of binding arches multi
plied."
It was delightful to hear Dr. Flugel
say that this passage was to him, as
it always has been to me, the most
satisfying expression we have had of
what we all feel for the "Quad."
