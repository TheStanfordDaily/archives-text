# Cornerstone of Library Located.
## 
### 
Workmen excavating among the
ruins of the library recently unearth
ed the corner-stone that has been
missing since the destruction of Ihe
building in 1906. Effort has been
made to find the valuable stone, but
it was not until the last few days that
the block was located. Its contents,
which included valuable coins of the
l T niled States and copies of the col
lege publications, were intact. The
square is now in the oflice of the
Farm Superintendent. It will prob
ably be used again in the construc
tion of the new library, when that
building is restored.
