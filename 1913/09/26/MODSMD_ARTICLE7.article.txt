was a graduate of Western Reserve
University and Lane Theological In
stitute. Before coming here he held
the pastorate of the First Presbyter
ian church of Los Angeles. While
in Los Angeles Professor Howard was
instrumental in organizing the Civic
League, and later became head of
that powerful factor for civic right
eousness. He brought with him to
his duties here that same active
spirit, which, with his winning per
sonality, made him eminently success
ful as a teacher."
A collection in pamphlet form by
friends and admirers, of gems of
thought from his sermons and essays

Shepherd's Quest" in 1909 is a short
meditation of great beauty. His
most important writing was the
"German Empire" in 1906. Promi
nent, critics have said that in this
book he did for the German Empire
what Hryce did for the United States.
The memory of Professor Alphonso

comer came to Stanford in 1891, and
has been the head of the English de
partment. fince 1906, where everyone
hoped his work might be long. His
life was ended in its prime. Purity
was the charm of his character, gen
tleness and self effacement marked
his personality. His keen acumen
in literary criticism wonderfully lilt
ed him for the interpretation of
Shakespeare by Shakespeare's own
works, which he had not yet. com
pleted. He was a true poet at heart
and his few poems and essays leave
only the regret that his writings were
not more in quantity.
"The simple and spontaneous ex
pressions of sadness and affection
from friends and former pupils which
have flooded the family mail are the
highest testimony to his memory, and
it may lie truly said that his life,
though cut. off in its prime, was hap
py."

"German Empire" in 1906. Promi
nent, critics have said that in this
book he did for the German Empire
what Hryce did for the United States.
The memory of Professor Alphonso
Gerald Newcomer was eulogized by
Professor Flugel. "Professor New
comer came to Stanford in 1891, and
has been the head of the English de
partment. fince 1906, where everyone
hoped his work might be long. His
life was ended in its prime. Purity
was the charm of his character, gen
tleness and self effacement marked
his personality. His keen acumen
in literary criticism wonderfully lilt
ed him for the interpretation of
Shakespeare by Shakespeare's own
works, which he had not yet. com
pleted. He was a true poet at heart
and his few poems and essays leave
only the regret that his writings were
not more in quantity.
"The simple and spontaneous ex
pressions of sadness and affection
from friends and former pupils which
have flooded the family mail are the
highest testimony to his memory, and
it may lie truly said that his life,
though cut. off in its prime, was hap
py."
