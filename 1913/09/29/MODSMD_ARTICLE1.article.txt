# IMPORTANT ADDITIONS TO BE MADE TO ORGAN
## TRUSTEES TAKE ACTION FRIDAY AT MEETING. Loan Fund Committee Chosen and Assistants Appointed by Members of Board. 
### 
Important improvements which will
make the organ to be placed in the
Memorial Church the equal of the one
originally planned by Mrs. Stanford
were authorized by the Board of Trus
tees on Friday. Arrangements were
made with the Johnson Organ and
Manufacturing Company, of Los An
geles, for the placing of the organ in
the Memorial Church in as good con
dition as new, with the addition of
pneumatic punches in the wind chest,
an echo organ, cathedral chimes and
concert harp stop.
The pneumatic punches have to do
with the manipulation of the instru
ment, and will obviate the mechanical
noise now heard during the playing
of the organ. The echo organ was
originally intended for the dome, but
will now probably be installed in one
of the transepts. In connection with
the echo organ will be a set of Cathe
dral Chimes. The main instrument,
which is an antiphonal organ, will
eventually have 54 speaking stops,
together with ten couplers and two
tremolo stops. With the composition
pedals and two swell pedals and cres
cendo there will be SI registers and
mechanical accessories.
A committee was appointed for the
administration of the William Burton
Barton Loan Fund by the Board con
sisting of Professor E. P. Cubberly,
Professor J. O. Griffin, assistant regis
trar J. E. McDowell and Student Ad
visor, ex-offlcio.

Important improvements which will
make the organ to be placed in the
Memorial Church the equal of the one
originally planned by Mrs. Stanford
were authorized by the Board of Trus
tees on Friday. Arrangements were
made with the Johnson Organ and
Manufacturing Company, of Los An
geles, for the placing of the organ in
the Memorial Church in as good con
dition as new, with the addition of
pneumatic punches in the wind chest,
an echo organ, cathedral chimes and
concert harp stop.
The pneumatic punches have to do
with the manipulation of the instru
ment, and will obviate the mechanical
noise now heard during the playing
of the organ. The echo organ was
originally intended for the dome, but
will now probably be installed in one
of the transepts. In connection with
the echo organ will be a set of Cathe
dral Chimes. The main instrument,
which is an antiphonal organ, will
eventually have 54 speaking stops,
together with ten couplers and two
tremolo stops. With the composition
pedals and two swell pedals and cres
cendo there will be SI registers and
mechanical accessories.
A committee was appointed for the
administration of the William Burton
Barton Loan Fund by the Board con
sisting of Professor E. P. Cubberly,
Professor J. O. Griffin, assistant regis
trar J. E. McDowell and Student Ad
