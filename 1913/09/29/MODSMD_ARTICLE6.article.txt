## SCORE THREE TRIES AGAINST COLLEGE VETERANS. Booting Is Feature of Saturday Match â€”Freshmen Down College of Pacific 11 to 3. 
### 
The Stanford Varsity won its sec
ond game of the season 011 Saturday,
defeating the fast University of Cali
fornia Club fifteen by a score of 13 to
3. The match was an exciting one
from the first whistle to the end of the
sixty minutes of play, and the three
tries registered by the Cardinal Rug
gers against the "Winged C" were
the result of play that thrilled the
bleacherites. The eight man scrum
was used, and the ball was heeled
back to tlie half often enough to pre
vent the play being monopolized by
the forwards. There was little pass
ing, open play being more the result
of individual action.
Both periods were marked by good
booting to touch, many yards being
gained by clever kicking from the
ruck. At fullback, R. Brown showed
unusual ability to get the ball away
for great distances, getting touch
more than forty yards from his posi
tion 011 several occasions.
In the preliminary game the Fresh
men found the College of the Pacific
fifteen easy opponents, defeating them
by an 11 to 3 score.
The Varsity.
The first score was made by Car
roll for the Varsity in the first five
minutes of play. Carroll had cross
kicked to Urban, who advanced the
ball ten yards by a pretty run. The
clubmen saved, but after the dropout
Thoburn secured and passed to Car
roll, who scored under the goal posts.
Brown converted and the score stood
5-0.
Schaupp gained the three points for
the club a few minutes later. The
forwards had forced the play into
Stanford territory, and after a series
of short passing rushes Schwartz se
cured and passed to Schaupp, who
scored. Morris failed to convert, and
the scoreboard read S. 5-U. C. C. 3.
On the dropout the action went to
the other end of the field, where
Card scored for the Varsity from a
five yard scrum by sliding across the
lino close to the corner flag. Brown
found the angle too difficult, and the
score remained 8-3.
Thoburn made the third try for
Stanford, taking the ball on a cross
kick and going over the lino. Brown
converted, and the half ended 13-3.
