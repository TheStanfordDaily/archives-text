# ENGLISH MADE COMEDY WINS GENEROUS APPROVAL
## SWORD AND SANDALS CAST STAR IN "TYRANNY OF TEARS." First Offering of Dramatic Season Affords Good Sized Audience Full Value of Enjoyment. 
### 
'1 he Sword and Sandals production
| of C. Haddon Chambers' comedy, "The
Tyranny of Tears," justified the en
thusiasm of the audience which gath
ered in the Assembly I-lall last Pridey
evening. Some of the seven members
j of the cast threw more fun into the
offering than others, because of great
er opportunity and greater ability.
None of them failed to keep the story
of the play in lively progress.
There is a tradition among English
playwrights which usually chooses a
suburban setting for British com
edies. Once located, there seems to
be no prescription to govern the nat
ure of the comedy itself.
In the case of "The Tyranny of
Tears" it happens that the author
chose to make his effort simply de
lightful. There are no thrills any
where in the four-act history of the
plot. It is true that a moral is en
joined, but it is insinuated rather
than tacked on, and is agreeable
enough.
There have been few recent stage
offerings at Stanford for which so
much unassuming charm can be
boasted as falls to the share of this
most recent one.
The actors and coach who prepared
the comedy accomplished the task
with speed and success that ap
proaches that of stock company pro
ductions. What would otherwise be
entirely remarkable, is partly ex
plained by the small cast called for.
Among the men of the play the two
principals, W. J?. Owens, '14, and L. W.
Lewis, '14, shared their time on the
stage about equally, and each attain
ed complete success of different types
to correspond to his role.
Owens, as Mr. Parbury, literary lion
of the reading world, and victim of
the tear-splashed whims cf an un
sympathetic wife, has won new lau
rels on the local stage, rt may be
permitted to hint at comparison be
tween Owens' work in the last pro
duct ion and his dramatic Sidney Car
ton. in "The Only Way." The part of
Mr. Parbury did not offer such chance
for character portraiture as did that
of Carton. The blame may be laid
with the fact that the writer of "The
Tyranny ot Tears" is a man of lesser
mould than the conceiving genius of
"The Only Way." In any case, Owens'
acting both characters has been of
first order, and the difference in the
strength of their appeal may not be
discredited to him.
Since it was said in beginning that
"The Tyranny of Tears" was simply
delightful, there is no need to look
further down the list of characters
for highly colored parts.
Lewis Successful.
L. W. Lewis, '14, presented the
pleasant cynicism of Parbury's bach
ellor friend, Gunning, with an abund
ance of artful resource. His presence
on the stage meant very frequent
laughter from the audience, and he
