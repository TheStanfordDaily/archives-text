It is a mathematical truth that the
whole can be no greater than the sum
of its parts. Conversely, to make a
perfect equation it is necessary that
every factor be in the proper relation

to every other factor. Wheth
er this has been true of the
units in our own University
life in the past is aside the

point. But tomorrow will mark the
commencement of a new epoch for
Stanford University. A new Presi
dent is to be installed; the first period
of history closes; a new page is nec
essary for our line of day book and
two new factors are to have a new
meeting with the other elements in
our University organization. Tomor
row's participation is but a begin
ning and the unification which is to
be begun will have its fruitful benefits
evidenced in the years ahead.
