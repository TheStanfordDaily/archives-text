# CHARLES K. FIELD, '95, SPEAKS FOR THE ALUMNI
## 
### 
Address by Charles K. Field, class
of '9") (Editor of Sunset Magazine).
"This happens to be the first time
that an alumnus of Stanford has been
called ui)on to welcome a president to
his chair in the university. The in
teresting duty is a new one, even Lo
the pioneers of '95. It is true that
twenty-two years ago today, in prac
tically this very spot, we were on
hand to hear the President of Stan
ford deliver his inaugural address,
but we were not invited to express
ourselves on that occasion. As I re
member it, we had not even a yell,
and we let out the pent-up enthusiasm
of the hour by singing a hymn.
"Yet on that other First of October,
in that first Stanford "get-together",
under the leadership of Stanford's
first president, the 'Stanford spirit'
was born. It is for us who were there
that day to testify to the steady
growth of that spirit under the in
spiration of his ideals. We were all
Freshmen really, in that first year, in
an uncharted sea, unmarked by pre
cedent or tradition. And our Captain
had been, himself, a Freshman at Cor
nell under the same sailing condi
tions. He knew that 'the greatest
value of tradition lies in the making
of it'; he believed in us and we in
him, and that is a combination that
is hard to beat. So we and the classes
that have come after us understood
and rejoiced in the spirit which he
breathed into Stanford at the begin-
ning—a spirit of democracy which ac
counts a man's clothes of less mo
ment than liis skin, and both less im
portant than his mind and heart; a
spirit that declares 'the strength of
being clean' a spirit of definite loyalty
which, after the inevitable vicissitudes
of twenty-two years, has undeniably
and unequivocally triumphed in this
place. Ten years ago this month, as
it happens, at a University Assembly,
I tried to paraphrase that spirit, and
the words of that credo come to me
today as they came to me then:
"'ln loyalty to Stanford, —to the
whole university—by word and deed,
always, by silence even, when speech
were disloyal; in honoring Stanford
people to measure their loyalty and
no more; in building with the build
ers through faith in the Stanford
plan; in making every best ef
fort spell Stanford before another
name; in planting 110 seed in Stan
ford ground without hope of flow
er somewhere; and for the sake of
these things reverencing the senti
ment that gave the Stanford oppor
tunity;—therein lies the beginning,
but not the end, of the Stanford
Spirit.'
"Today, from the deepest depth of
that loyal spirit, the hearts that
learned it from their first president
send grateful tribute across the world
to their first Chancellor.
"Against such a background, the
alumnus of Stanford stands to wel
come the new President of the Uni
versity. We shall say which is the
easier to welcome, —the old-timer or
the tenderfoot. With the stranger,
anything you say about climate, for
instance, is likely to pass, but your
old friend knows that the heat and
the fog are no surprising novelty, and
you must needs choose your words
with greater care. But if words today
are few and cautious, the joy of them
is all the greater that the man of the
hour is no new man in these quarter
century old places which we love in
direct ratio to the number of years
we have known them. He has been
a part of all that we count worth
while upon this campus, shoulder to
shoulder, from the beginning, with
the leader of the Stanford spirit, hard
ly second through it all. in the devo
tion of the sons of that spirit, to the
man whose active place he takes to
day. It needs no sleight-of-hand to
slip over his shoulders the mantle of
Stanford leadership—it lies there eas
ily in Stanford minds! Welcome to
him on our part seems but the tech
nicality of occasion. Confidence, loy
alty, affectionate esteem, —if there be
need of speech for these let twenty
two years give tongue to them. Let
twenty-two years of love for the old
Stanford pledge alumni support
through the unnumbered years of the
new Stanford whose bugle call the
Trustees have sounded in this memor
able year of 1913, pledge the best that
is in us all to the service of the new
President."
