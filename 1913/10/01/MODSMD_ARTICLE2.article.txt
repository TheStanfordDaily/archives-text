# GOOD CHEER DOMINATES RECEPTION AND REUNION OF MANY GENERATIONS
## 
### 
During two pleasant hours this af
ternoon under the good light of the
California sky, the Memorial Court
held a fullness of Stanford cheer
and kindly spirit. The reception from
lour until six o'clock was an occasion
for tiie mingling and exchanged greet
ing of many generations of Stanford
folk. Men of the "Old Guard," alumni
of the middle years, faculty, trustees
and undergraduates gave their best
effort and enthusiasm to the store of
high spirit. The Memorial Court, the
center of the University's best tradi
tions, and its surrounding arcades
echoed the sincerity of congratulation
and good wishes.
At the entrance to the Court from
the Inner Quad, participants in the
reception and re-union were met by
the reception committee, led by Pro
lessor S. S. Seward, E. C. Dehrens, '14,
\\ r . S. Burns, '14, and Miss Carol
Green, '14. The scores of people were
led in turn to the receiving party, and
presented to President Brainier and
Mrs. Branner, the and their
wives, and representatives of the fac
ulty and alumni. Thereafter the guests
and hosts, as they may be interchange
ably termed, began the pleasant duty
of making acquaintances, and renew
ing old ones. The legends and tra
ditions of twenty-two Stanford genen-
lions passed in rapid exchange, during
tliis best opportunity of the day.
Palms and potted plants nestled in
the nooks and niches of the arcades.
Many liued carpets and rugs were
stretched over the pavement and lawn.
From behind a screen of foliase the
Alcazar Theater orchestra sent music
into the open. The multicolored gar
ments of Stanford's fair daughters com
bined with these blending sights and
sounds to bring back a memory of the
old Spanish California. The Memor
ial Court lent its grace of Spanish,
design to build a beautiful patio. â– <
Volunteers from the Freshmen class
helped the committee of seventy-five
from the upper classes to serve ice
cream and punches from numerous
booths. P. B. McKoe, '14, B. L. Wines,
'15, and H. R. Harvey, '16, the presi
dents of the three classes, marshalled
the work of the general committee.
Wilson and Ogier catered the re
lreshments, which included punches,
and maple parfait. A generous sup
ply of good things to eat. was distribut
ed.
After 5 o'clock, strains of organ mu
sic could be heard, coming from the
Assembly Hall. Between five and six
o'clock, many of the assemblage pass
ed into the Hall to listen to selected
music of the organ rendered by Pro
fessor Louis H. Eaton.
The light of sunset shone on the
parting of the people in groups. The
most intimate gathering of Stanford
people that has ever been held ended
with a lingering beauty, and left its
lesson of typical and general cheer to
commemorate the twenty second 1
birthday of Stanford, and the installat
ion of its second president.
