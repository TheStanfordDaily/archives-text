# Strong Men Are Stanford Trustees
## 
### 
The Hoard of Trustees of Stanford
University is a remarkable group of
successful men. Their training and
instincts, attained in the modern bus
iness world, have made them able
executives of the affairs and manage
ment of the university.
It is doubtful if any sum would be
sufficient to hire them to do for pay
the work that as Trustees of tho
University they give without pay for
the public welfare. Not only does the
responsibility of the welfare of the
University and the management of
its external affairs, its buildings and
campus, rest on their shoulders, but
they administer the farms and other
properties that form part of the Uni
versity's endowment, and in general
control funds the annual income of
which is over $800,000, and determine
the expenditure of that income. •
The members of the Board of Trus
tees are: Timothy Hopkins, president;
Charles I'. Eells, Charles G. Lathrop,
Vanderlynn Stow, Frank B. Anderson,
William Habcock, Horace Davis, James
Donohoe Grant, Herbert C. Hoover. >

al board of trustees. It has been said
that if lie had devoted as much at- ;
tention to his own affairs as lie has 1
to those of the University, he could

tune. He keeps in intimate touch
