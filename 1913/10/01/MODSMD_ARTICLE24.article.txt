# STANFORD HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION FORMED.
## Object of Organization to Gather Data, Literature and Photographs Relating to University. 
### 
Definite steps were recently taken
toward the formation of the Stanford
Historical Association. As tentative
jy outlined, the object of the society
will be to gather historical data, pub
lications, maps, literature and photo
graphs which in any way relate to
the University.
The historical periods will lie divid
ed approximately into five sections,
that dating from the time of Porto
la's visit to the acquisition of the
grounds by Senator Stanford; from
that date to the death of Lelaiul Jr.,
then to the inauguration of President
David Starr Jordan, from that to the
inauguration of President John Cas
per Hranner, which will be the be
ginning of the fifth period.
Each division will be under separate
heads, with research committees work
ing under the general direction of the
president and the advisory board. In
this way each member has a definite
outline for which he alone is re
sponsible. As a result, very effective
work will be accomplished, for the
lack of activity of any member accept
ing an appointment on a committee
will lie apparent at once. One of the
qualifications for membership will lie
that the number shall be. or has at
one time been connected with the Uni
versity or the Stanford estate. Next,
week a meeting will he called when a
committee will lie appointed to draft
a constitution and a set of by-laws.
Among those particularly interested
are Professors E. D. Adams, E. E.
Robinson, R. E. Swain, H. Heath, P.
J. Treat, R. W. Doane, A. M. Bspinosa,
H. R. Fairclough, E. Flugel and it. D.
Harshe.
