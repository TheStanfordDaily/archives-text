### 
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of the
University:
Just twenty-two years ago, on the
first of October, 1891, the doors of
Stanford University swung open for
the reception of students.
These years have been eventful ones
in tlie life of the institution. It be
gan its career full of high hope un
der the wise and loving care of Sen
ator and Mrs. Stanford, but after a
short period of sunshine, it lost the
strong guiding hand of Senator Stan
ford and was plunged into a period of
gloom and distress from which it was
rescued by the heroic struggles and
noble sacrifice of Mrs. Stanford which
were crowned with final victory. The
clouds passed away, and now as we
approach the end of our first quarter
of a century, we find the University
on a firm educational basis, enjoying
the vigor of robust youth, with a fu
ture full of promise.
In reading the Founding Grant we
are impressed with the grandeur cf
the scheme and the breadth of its de
sign. The ultimate scope of the insti
tution is of the broadest and most
comprehensive nature and demanded
exceptional qualities of mind and char
acter in the executive head chosen to
put into effect the plans of the found
ers.
In his hands lay the success or
marring of the project, and Senator
Stanford showed his wisdom and
knowledge of man in his selection of
David Starr Jordan as the first presi
dent of this institution. Educational
ly broad and sane, purposeful, ener
getic and courageous with construc
tive ability of an unusual type, Presi
dent Jordan has safely guided the
University through the most trying
period it probably will ever have.
His ideals and spirit have become
Stanford Ideals and Stanford Spirit,
and to him and the faithful men chos
en by his wisdom to carry out his
plans belongs the praise for the high
standing of the University in the edu
cational world.
The Founding Grant enjoins upon
us "to promote the public welfare by
exercising an influence in behalf of
humanity and civilization." The time
has come when, in deference to Dr.
Jordan's request, the Trustees have
relieved him of the executive burdens
of the University that he may devote
part of his time to these broader as
pects of world affairs, and have nunje
him Chancellor of the University that
he may represent us in this wider
arena.
David Starr Jordan stands in the
very front rank of university presi
dents; as Chancellor Jordan he is ac
quiring international fame in the
greater field of human interests; his
idealism is voiced at the Hague; his
sturdy support is given to every
movement for general betterment of
the human race; but his heart is still,
as it always will be, with us here at
Stan ford.
The Trustees have chosen for his

| successor a man whose worth has been
j tested by long years of experience, a
man who is loved, honored, and re
injected by Alumni, Faculty, and Stu
dents.
Eminent in his profession and dis
j tinguished as a scholar, his strength
j of character, sound judgment, and ex
! ecutive ability combine to promise suc
i cess for his administration.
Marked out for the place by all
these assurances of efficiency, Doctor
Branner takes up his burdens with the
cordial and hearty support of Trus
tees, Alumni, Faculty, and Students â€”
the whole University, in each and all
its parts, stands ready to assist him
in the great work which is before him.
Doctor John Casper Branner, on the
first of August, 1913, the Board of
Trustees of the Leland Stanford Ju
nior University unanimously elected
you President of this institution.
In the name of the Board and as
its President, I now formally invest
you with the authority and dignity of
that office, and in token of the trust
reposed in you, I present to you a copy
of the Founding Grant, in full confi
dence that the objects and purposes
therein set forth will receive your
loyal support and that you will cher
ish and foster with zeal and fidelity
the ideals of the University.
May the fullest measure of success
crown your labors.
