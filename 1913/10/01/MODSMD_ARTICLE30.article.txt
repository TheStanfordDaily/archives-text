# UNION OF ELEMENTS URGED BY BEHRENS
## 
### 
Members of the Stanford Family:
This morning the four elements
which make up the Stanford family—
Trustees, Faculty, Alumni and Under
graduates— meet on terms of equality
to do honor to the man on whom is
placed the burden of the Presidential
duties. As a representative of the Un
dergraduates of the University it be
comes my agreeable duty to express
our sense of good fortune to the mem
bers of the Hoard of Trustees upon
their choice of an executive head of
the University. We desire also to
thank the Trustees for giving us an
opportunity to participate in this dis
tinctive and memorable occasion—
marking the 2:2 anniversary of the
founding of the University and the in
stallation of its second president.
It is a truism that the personality of
the teacher is the vital factor in all
grades of education and that a uni
versity cannot be truly great without
great teachers. There are invaluable
elements which only reach us through
vital contact with the mind and per
sonality of a masterful teacher. As
we replace the exuberance of youth
by the soberer judgment of upperclass
men days we become more and more
conscious of this truth. Though we
forgot all we learned from books, the
influences woven into our lives by per
sonal contact with the personalities in
our faculty will always remain a part
of us. At 110 time more than during
the formulative period of undergrad
uate days is there needed that life giv
ing breath which emanates from
scholarly, courageous and wholesome
personalities. Personality though dif
ficult to define is easily recognized
when one comes into its presence.
Today we pay homage to a teacher who
possesses a conspicuous personality,
together with intellectual qualities

which have enlarged the world's stock
of knowledge; emotional qualities
which endow him with a rich sym
pathy; volitional qualities which lead
him to action and achievement, and
moral qualities which inspire him to
seek what is right in all things
We are fortunate at Stanford in hav
ing other rich niijuls in our faculty.
For the advantage of the present and
future generations of Stanford stu
dents we hope that this day which
witnesses the installation of a new
president may also mark the beginning
1! .
of a golden ago of contact between
faculty and students.
Students and faculty are only a
part of the University. A Quadrangle
is not complete without its four
sides and for its perfection our Uni
versity requires the proper alignment
of its four sides—Trustees and Faculty,
Alumni and Undergraduates. If the
student profits from his personal con
tact with tlie Faculty, how much the
greater must this profit be if he and
the Faculty continue in touch with the
two other factors in the University.
For the sake of the University as also
for selfish reasons the undergraduates
wish to see the Quadrangle complete
by the intimate connection of all its
parts. Therefore, on this day mark
ing the beginning of a new era, we
not only express a wish for close re
lationship with the faculty, but also
an earnest and sincere desire for ef
fectual contact with the Trustees and
Alumni.
President Branner, we look to you
as one whose administration is to
bring about the perfect association and
cooperation of the Trustees, Faculty,
Alumni and Undergraduates. We be
lieve iu you and we believe that your
personality will attract all of us to
you as the center of our activities.
We are confident that the unification
which you will achieve will have as its
fruit the advancement of the great and
noble ideals for which this institution
stands. And on this anniversary which
marks the close of the first era of our
history we pledge our loyalty to you
in your efforts to realize these great
aims. We congratuJate you. \\ e wish
you success and we pledge you our
loyalty in the name of that future to
ward which our faces are so hopefully
turned.
