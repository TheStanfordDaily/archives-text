# PRESIDENT OF STUDENTS WELCOMES NEW EXECUTIVE
## PRESENTATION OF CHAIR. 
### A.G. Halm 
Mr. Hopkins and members of the
Hoard of Trustees:
The Students of Leland Stanford
Junior University desire me on this
auspicious occasion to express their
pleasure and dee]) satisfaction upon
the inauguration of Dr. John Casper
Branner to the Presidency.
They desire to offer as proof of their
affection and admiration for President
Branner, a Presidential chair, â€”symbol
of authority, and seat of power.
It is built to harmonize with the
happy style of the Quadrangle and
bears the seal of the University.
Its massiveness and strength of line
are peculiarly appropriate to this oc
casion, as they symbolize the firmness,
the stability, the solid worth of him
who is to be the first to occupy it.
To President Branner I bear the
felicitations and lasting good will of
this generation of Stanford Sons and
Daughters, and for them express the
hope that for many years you may be
spared to uphold the dignity of your
high office.
