# GYMNASIUM AND STADIUM PROPOSITIONS CONSIDERED
## BOARD OF CONTROL DISCUSSES TRUSTEES OFFER. Expediency of Accepting Proposal Bused on Receipts and Expenditures of Student Body. 
### 
From comparative receipts and ex
penditures of the Associated Student
Body for the last three years the
Board of Control considered last ev
ening whether or not it would be ex
pedient from a financial standpoint to
accept the proposal of the Board of
Trustees to build a new gymnasium
and a stadium.
During the past two or three years
the receipts and expenses have
amounted to about $35,000 annually.
Considering that both the expendit
ures and receipts have been increas
ing proportionally, and on the as
sumption that they will continue to
do the same each year, the Student
Body would be able to meet the ex
pense providing a fee of five dollars
a semester was levied on all men
students by the university.
The proposition submitted by the
Board of Trustees is that they pro
vide funds for the erection of the new
gymnasium and equip it. Then they
would turn it over to the Student
Body to run. The Board proposes
that this additional cost be met by a
compulsory fee of five dollars a sem
ester being paid by each registered
man student. This would net $11,000
annually based on the present regis
tration for the upkeep of the building
and instruction. In case the Student
Body does not care to do this the
Trustees propose to erect the gymnas
ium, charge the five dollar fee annu
ally and run the gym under the di
rection of the university. In the for
mer case it would be a student enter
prise, and in the latter it would not,
but the fee would have to be paid any
way.
At the present time the students
who take gym work are paying five
dollars annually. Those who belong
to the Associated Student Body are
also assessed five dollars each year.
For all who pay the ten dollars annu
ally now there would be no increase
in fees, the only difference would be
that they are paid at the business
office and the money turned over to
the Student Body. For those who do
not take gym at the present time or
hold a season ticket the charge would
be an added fee to their present ex
penses.
As figured by the Board of Control
the receipts from the fees, games and
other resources would be sufficient,
based on present statistics, to meet
all expenses of the coaches, upkeep
of equipment and athletic fields, and
new gymnasium and also have be
tween seven and eight thousand dol
lars which would be turned into a
sinking fund to pay back to the Trus
tees the amount expended by them on
the proposed stadium.

not take gym at the present time or
hold a season ticket the charge would
be an added fee to their present ex
penses.
As figured by the Board of Control
the receipts from the fees, games and
other resources would be sufficient,
based on present statistics, to meet
all expenses of the coaches, upkeep
of equipment and athletic fields, and
new gymnasium and also have be
tween seven and eight thousand dol
lars which would be turned into a
sinking fund to pay back to the Trus
tees the amount expended by them on
the proposed stadium.
From comparative receipts and ex
penditures of the Associated Student
Body for the last three years the
Board of Control considered last ev
ening whether or not it would be ex
pedient from a financial standpoint to
accept the proposal of the Board of
Trustees to build a new gymnasium
and a stadium.
During the past two or three years
the receipts and expenses have
amounted to about $35,000 annually.
Considering that both the expendit
ures and receipts have been increas
ing proportionally, and on the as
sumption that they will continue to
do the same each year, the Student
Body would be able to meet the ex
pense providing a fee of five dollars
a semester was levied on all men
students by the university.
The proposition submitted by the
Board of Trustees is that they pro
vide funds for the erection of the new
gymnasium and equip it. Then they
would turn it over to the Student
Body to run. The Board proposes
that this additional cost be met by a
compulsory fee of five dollars a sem
ester being paid by each registered
man student. This would net $11,000
annually based on the present regis
tration for the upkeep of the building
and instruction. In case the Student
Body does not care to do this the
Trustees propose to erect the gymnas
ium, charge the five dollar fee annu
ally and run the gym under the di
rection of the university. In the for
mer case it would be a student enter
prise, and in the latter it would not,
but the fee would have to be paid any
way.
At the present time the students
who take gym work are paying five
dollars annually. Those who belong
to the Associated Student Body are
also assessed five dollars each year.
For all who pay the ten dollars annu
ally now there would be no increase
in fees, the only difference would be
that they are paid at the business
office and the money turned over to
the Student Body. For those who do
not take gym at the present time or
hold a season ticket the charge would
be an added fee to their present ex
penses.
