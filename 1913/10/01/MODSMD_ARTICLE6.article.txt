# EVENTS OF INSTALLATION OCCUPY MORNING HOURS
## 
### 
I)r. John Casper Hranner was offi
cially installed as second President
j of Stanford University this morning
j to succeed David Starr Jordan, who
[ iias been promoted to the office of
i Chancellor of the University. The
installation was purely a family af
fair, being attended primarily by the
Hoard of Trustees, Faculty, Alumni
and Students.
Led by the graduate students, the
line of march extended down the
north side of the Inner Quad, past the
Greek building and through the East
Arch down the middle of the Inner
Quad. Here seats were placed on the
cement pavement for the entire Stud
ent Hody, Faculty, and Alumni, imme
diately in front of an improvised
platform where the speakers and
Board of Trustees were seated. The
graduate students were followed by
members of the Senior, Junior, Soph
omore and Freshman classes, Facul
ty, Academic Council, Advisory Board
ol the Alumni Association, Trustees
of the University, speakers, Acting
Registrar, Chaplain, Master of Cere
monies. President of the University,
and President of the Hoard of Trus
tees. The Stanford Hand played both
the overture and the processional
connected with the incidents of this
occasion.
It is proper that a university should
collect about it such heirlooms. If
you go to Harvard or Yale they will
show you with pride those relics of
the past that have come down to them
and which they treasure as the price
less heirlooms of their history. And
Stanford should do something of the
kind and make a collection. It be
tokens the character of the house.
Sometimes when you enter a house
the door is opened and you enter a
drawing room upholstered in the
style of Louis XIV or the Empire.
You look around for something char
acteristic of the family. You open a
door and see something closely con
nected with the family life. It is an
old clock which has ticked away the
lives of five or six generations. In
the library is an old desk coming
down from colonial times upon which
Washington may have written his dis
patches. You perhaps see pictures of
ancestors looking down upon you
from the wall and beaming peace
fully and with satisfaction upon the
history of the family us indicated in
these things. We should have some

thing here that gives the life of the
family. The alma mater should col
lect something of its history around
the home and accumulate a history
of its family.
This beautiful chair of yours will
go down generation after generation
in that way. As these classes of to
day pass away we shall be forgotten.
If we are remembered at all it will
only be as dim JJgures in the past his
tory of the university. This chair as
class after class passes away will be
come invested with not only a haze of
mystery but with a reverence for the
memory of those men who occupied
it and for those men who have built
up the university.
I thank you again for this token
of your good will, and hope it will
go down among the treasures of the
university forever.

Washington may have written his dis
patches. You perhaps see pictures of
ancestors looking down upon you
from the wall and beaming peace
fully and with satisfaction upon the
history of the family us indicated in
these things. We should have some

thing here that gives the life of the
family. The alma mater should col
lect something of its history around
the home and accumulate a history
of its family.
This beautiful chair of yours will
go down generation after generation
in that way. As these classes of to
day pass away we shall be forgotten.
If we are remembered at all it will
only be as dim JJgures in the past his
tory of the university. This chair as
class after class passes away will be
come invested with not only a haze of
mystery but with a reverence for the
memory of those men who occupied
it and for those men who have built
up the university.
I thank you again for this token
of your good will, and hope it will
go down among the treasures of the
university forever.
I)r. John Casper Hranner was offi
cially installed as second President
j of Stanford University this morning
j to succeed David Starr Jordan, who
[ iias been promoted to the office of
i Chancellor of the University. The
installation was purely a family af
fair, being attended primarily by the
Hoard of Trustees, Faculty, Alumni
and Students.
Led by the graduate students, the
line of march extended down the
north side of the Inner Quad, past the
Greek building and through the East
Arch down the middle of the Inner
Quad. Here seats were placed on the
cement pavement for the entire Stud
ent Hody, Faculty, and Alumni, imme
diately in front of an improvised
platform where the speakers and
Board of Trustees were seated. The
graduate students were followed by
members of the Senior, Junior, Soph
omore and Freshman classes, Facul
ty, Academic Council, Advisory Board
ol the Alumni Association, Trustees
of the University, speakers, Acting
Registrar, Chaplain, Master of Cere
monies. President of the University,
and President of the Hoard of Trus
tees. The Stanford Hand played both
the overture and the processional
connected with the incidents of this
occasion.
It is proper that a university should
collect about it such heirlooms. If
you go to Harvard or Yale they will
show you with pride those relics of
the past that have come down to them
and which they treasure as the price
less heirlooms of their history. And
Stanford should do something of the
kind and make a collection. It be
tokens the character of the house.
Sometimes when you enter a house
the door is opened and you enter a
drawing room upholstered in the
style of Louis XIV or the Empire.
You look around for something char
acteristic of the family. You open a
door and see something closely con
nected with the family life. It is an
old clock which has ticked away the
lives of five or six generations. In
the library is an old desk coming
down from colonial times upon which
Washington may have written his dis
patches. You perhaps see pictures of
ancestors looking down upon you

history of the family us indicated in
