# President Takes Vows of Loyalty
## INSTALLATION ADDRESS. 
### John Casper Brainier 
Dr. Horace Davis, Chairman; Mr.
Timothy Hopkins, President of the
Hoard of Trustees; Members of the
Board of Trustees; Members of the
Faculty; Alumni and Students of
Stanford University:
In assuming the duties and re
sponsibilities to which I am called
today I take upon myself anew the
vows of loyalty to the purposes for
which this institution has been found
ed, and I make public confession of
the faith and hope that nre in me.
Inasmuch as the trustees are pri
marily responsible for my appearance
before you as the president of the uni
versity, 1 address myself first and
principally to them.
Gentlemen of the Board: 1 count
it a great honor to be chosen presi
dent of Stanford University, and in
that capacity I count it a great priv
ilege to be in a position to cooperate
with you in carrying out the pur
poses for which this university was
founded.
1 count it a great honor to succeed
to the office so long and so ably
held by David Starr Jordan; and a
great privilege to carry forward the
work so well begun by him.
But I warn you at the outset that
you must not expect to find in nie
any of the evidences of Chancellor
Jordan's genius.
Being a practical man the problems
of life appear to me to bo simply the
problems of each day as the days
bring them along. 1 am compelled
by nature and by principle to depend
—not mi the inspirations of genius,
but on routine work directed to a
definite end.
I bespeak your patience and for
bearance with my personal shortcom
ings. I cannot promise to be diplo
matic, but you can always count on
my frankness and my straight-for
wardness, which are nioie important
I hope, in our dealings with each
other.
As we enter upon this new period
of university administration it seems
an appropriate occasion to take
stock of our deeds, our fears, our
hopes, and our promises. And while
taking stock we might go through
the house, open all the doors and
look in, and we might see whether
there are any skeletons hidden away
in dark closets or in obscure cor
ners.
In the founding grant Mr. and Mrs.
Stanford stated in so many words that
it was their purpose to found "a uni
versity of high degree" (p. 53). in de
fining its nature, they say that it is
to be ";i university with such semin
aries of learning as shall make it of
the highest grade" (p. 55). And while
we are looking over our results we
may profitably ask ourselves whether
and how closely we are coming to the
clearly expressed purposes and ex
pectations of the founders.
The university lias now been open
twenty-two years. In that period we
have conferred 4092 bachelor's de
grees, and siis advanced degrees. The
degrees conferred, however, represent
only a part of the instruction given,
for the total number of persons en
rolled in the twenty-two years
amounts to 11,251. This number in
cludes each individual only once, and

it does not include the new students
of the current year.
These numbers are not large as
compared with those of some of our
American universities, but they are
certainly large enough when all things
are considered.
In the faculty gathered here we
have some of the most distinguished
scholars now living. It is a faculty
of which we may well be proud, and
one that it will not le easy to im
prove. And not only are they able
men and ripe, productive scholars,
but they are men of the finest possi
ble fiber. Speaking from a knowledge
of the circumstances i am constrained
to tell you that the cheerful courage
of the faculty during these years of
hope deferred is beyond all praise. A
more loyal, self-sacrificing body of
men cannot be found anywhere.
And when we look over the total —
the thousands of fine young people
who have been • educated here, the
present faculty, the material equip
ment in the forms of libraries, appara
tus, and buildings, and when we con
template the university's secure finan
cial condition, and when we glance
back over the difficulties of starting
behind us, the difficulties of starting
the university and getting it through
the second summer of its childhood,
and through the growing pains of its
youth, we have just reason to be con
tented with the results and to take
courage for the future. Such in brief
are our deeds.
sity has only lately reached the stage
And now as to our fears: The univer
of its growth and that fixity of policy
that permits us all to feel confidence
in its orientation and in its stability.
It may be compared to a ship that
has set out on a long voyage, and
that has lately cleared the dangers
of the shoals, the cross currents, and
the rocks of the coast line. It must
now be headed on a definite course,
and if every one on board will do his
duty, there can be no doubt but that
the voyage will be a happy and suc
cessful one.
To continue this figure for a mo
ment, we must not forget a grave dan
ger that threatens ships at sea. and
that is the shifting of the cargo.
For the benefit of those of you who
may not be familiar with these nau
tical matters I may explain that owing
to the rolling of the vessel the cargo
of a ship sometimes moves gradually
from its original position toward one
side or the other, causing the ship
to list. This shifting may be so slight
that it is scarcely noticeable and may
be of no particular importance, but
it is sometimes not only serious, but
it may even throw the vessel so far
over on its side as to lead to disaster
and fatality to all on board.
A university is very like a ship to
this extent at, least, that a shifting
cargo spreads panic. The only deep
seated fear of which I am aware in
regard to this ship of ours is tlie fear
that the cargo may shift.
Having been promoted from the
ranks of the faculty of our own uni
versity I take it upon myself to men
tion some of the hopes of the faculty
that cannot well be sent, in to you in
the form of requisitions. They are
hopes that are in the air, and thoy
are in our hearts and in our lives.
The beauty of our surroundings is
an educational asset which some of

us are slow to appreciate at its full
value.
When this group of buildings was
first put up it was unique, and justly
excited world-wide admiration. In
this country it was a revelation. Col
leges and universities everywhere be
gan at once to realize the importance
and esthetic value of attention to their
architecture and to the grouping of
their buildings. Meanwhile the novel
ty of it wore off for us; we forgot
I that we were good-looking; we gave
the matter less attention, and the at
tractiveness of the grounds has been
greatly diminished by the bare sun
baked courts and the general shabbi
ness that probably seemed too unim
portant. to be taken seriously. A few
years ago a visitor to these grounds
was heard to remark, entirely without
feeling, that he had never seen an in
stitution where there were so many
evidences of poverty.
I am delighted to say that the trus
tees now have in mind the improve
ment of these conditions, and the new
grounds committee will doubtless see
that they do not continue.
The question often arises in my own
mind whether or not our buildings can
be made more attractive within. The
attractiveness and good inlluence of
our church is unquestionably due in
no small degree to its beautiful in
terior.
We have in the museum thousands
of beautiful works of art, and our
students seldom or never see them,
in addition to many valuable origin
al paintings, the museum contains
copies of many of the most famous
paintings in the world, copies that
most of us could hardly distinguish
from the originals; and yet the walls
of our lecture and seminary rooms
are as bare as the walls of a prison
or of any factory.
To lie sure the students can visit
j the museum if they see fit, but there
; is no concealing the fact that our
j educational institutions are largely
' engaged in thrusting education upon
[ the young people who come within
1 our reach. 1 do not say this as a
| reproach to the young. That is what
we do with our children, and we must
do it with all the rest of them. For
purposes of education it must be con
fessed that the works of art in the
museum arc of but little value at
present.
From the faculty point of view there
is nothing this university desires or
needs so much as a sympathetic
atmosphere for all of its legitimate
functions. There is probably nothing
you can do that will contribute more
to this sympathetic atmosphere than
to encourage and stimulate every
member of our Instructing body,
young and old alike, each in his own
work, no matter what that work may
be, whether in science, art, or liter
ature. Indeed as I see all these
things, work that is not worth en
couraging ought not to be here. And
1 do not need to remind you that a
university is judged, and very proper
ly judged, by (he contribution made
by its faculty to literature, science,
art and all the rest, and above all
I by its contribution to good and sound
citizenship and to high thinking and
to right acting. Indeed it is for this
very reason that most of our modern
civilization has its roots in our uni
versities. On the other hand any

act of the trustees that discredits or
tends to discredit our professors is
absolutely fatal, not only to the indi
vidual, but to the faculty and to the
university as a whole. A sympathetic
atmosphere doesn't necessarily cost
money; and neither does it spring
from promises that flee before our ad
vancing footsteps.
As for promises: most of our disap
pointments have come from promises
forgotten. 1 l'eel like asking you—be
seeching you—never to promise any
thing to anyone, for although promises
keep alive that hope which springs
eternal, sometimes they also leave be
hind them a brood of evils without
name.
Many of the members of our faculty
have lived on promises and hope now
these twenty-odd years, and we all
know by bitter experience what hope
deferred means. They came here
young men, full of vigor, courage, and
enthusiasm, they have learned the les
sons of poverty, they have restrained
their demands, they have been put off
from year to year with promises old
and new, and now behold them with
gray hairs, with grown-up families,
and with defeated ambitions, but still
cheerful and faithful and loyal.
To be sure all promises do not turn
to disappointments. For that reason
I want to make just one myself, and
if I make it here and now perhaps
the occasion will help hold me firmly
to it.
Gentlemen of the Board, permit me
to call your attention to a provision
printed 011 page 157 of the trustees'
manual, it is there provided "that
the president of the university shall
annually present to the Board of Trus
tees * * * the names of all mem
bers of the teaching or executive staff
of the university who shall lie over G. r >
years of age 011 the first day of the
following academic year, with the
recommendations as to the retirement
or retention of all such persons."
Here and now 1 beg to remind you
that I shall be Go years of age in
July, 1915, and I recommend that 1
be retired at the end of that academic
year.
In spite of protests on the part of
some of my friends it seems to me
best for the university to fix that limit
to my tenure now while I have the
si length of mind to see what is best
for the university, and to set the
limit before old-age can fasten me
on the university as an unproductive
and unwelcome pensioner.
in closing here what I address
chiefly to the Hoard I wish to give
public expression to my high appre
ciation of tiie cordial support given
me by the trustees, and also to ex
press my admiration of the unselfish
ness of the busy men who give so
much of their valuable time to the af
fairs of the university.
To My Colleagues of the Faculty:
My friends, I take up the duties of
this office with a strong sense of my
own shortcomings, and with a pro
found feeling of personal gratitude to
you for the cordial support you have
given me as your president. More
than any other one thing it is my
knowledge of your sympathy, of your
faitli in me, and of your long-tried
patience, that has given 1110 courage
to undertake the duties of this office.
1 would have every one of you feel
that I am here to serve you in every
