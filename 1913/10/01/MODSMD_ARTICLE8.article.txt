# STANFORD OFFERS LARGEST PUBLIC CHARITY IN BAY CITY
## Seventy Thousand Patients Received Medical Treatment Without Charge Last Year—To Be Enlarged. 
### 
Tlie treating of charity patients at
llie Lane Hospital of the Stanford
Medical School in San Francisco has
been one of the greatest steps in
the development of public work by
the University during the past year.
Over 70,000 patients have taken ad
vantage of the free clinic treatment
during the past year where the ser
vices of specialists was given when
cases demanded. For some time Stan
ford lias maintained the largest public
charity in San Francisco without pub
lic appropriation.
With the opening of the free ortho
pedic clinic in the Hospital today a
new step in the development of the
public charity work of the Stanford
Medical department is inaugurated.
The formation til the new clinic is not
an innovation but a new department
of the work which has been carried
on in the past. This department will
he in charge of Dr. Leonard W. Ely,
chairman of the section of orthopedics
in the American Medical Association.
The poor receive the same treatment
at Lane Hospital with as much care
and skill involved, as do the patients
of its private rooms. r lhe only differ
ence is that in the case of the charity
patients the treatment is given or the
operation performed—by a specialist
before a class of Stanford medical
students.

Although Stanford has been in com
plete charge for only one year of what
was formerly Cooper's Medical Col
lege, the arivai.r s of the department
during its administration has been
great. This advancement began with
tiie erection of a $140,000 building to
liou.se the Lane Library lust year. Over
30,000 volumes are contained in the
medical Library which is one of the
largest in tlia United States.
HI ILI) IT DEIWirniENT.
The Trustees have announced that
they intend to spend sufficient of the
income of the University in the up
building of the Medical department to
place it on a plane, so far as standards
and efficiency are concerned, with the
ranking institutions of the East. Al
i ready half a million dollars have
been appropriated toward this end.
For a limited number of students Stan
ford now offers medical instruction
second to none in the land.
Another manner in which the useful
ness of the medical school has been
increased is through the action of
| the Trustees last Friday which re
| moved the tariff on the use of the
I books in Lane Library. For some
| time past the charge has been only
jnminal, but this recent action removes
even this. Looks may lie withdrawn
j by the payment of a fee of five dollars
| a year.

Tlie treating of charity patients at
llie Lane Hospital of the Stanford
Medical School in San Francisco has
been one of the greatest steps in
the development of public work by
the University during the past year.
Over 70,000 patients have taken ad
vantage of the free clinic treatment
during the past year where the ser
vices of specialists was given when
cases demanded. For some time Stan
ford lias maintained the largest public
charity in San Francisco without pub
lic appropriation.
With the opening of the free ortho
pedic clinic in the Hospital today a
new step in the development of the
public charity work of the Stanford
Medical department is inaugurated.
The formation til the new clinic is not
an innovation but a new department
of the work which has been carried
on in the past. This department will
he in charge of Dr. Leonard W. Ely,
chairman of the section of orthopedics
in the American Medical Association.
The poor receive the same treatment
at Lane Hospital with as much care
and skill involved, as do the patients
of its private rooms. r lhe only differ
ence is that in the case of the charity
patients the treatment is given or the
operation performed—by a specialist
before a class of Stanford medical
students.

Although Stanford has been in com
plete charge for only one year of what
was formerly Cooper's Medical Col
lege, the arivai.r s of the department
during its administration has been
great. This advancement began with
tiie erection of a $140,000 building to
liou.se the Lane Library lust year. Over
30,000 volumes are contained in the
medical Library which is one of the
largest in tlia United States.
