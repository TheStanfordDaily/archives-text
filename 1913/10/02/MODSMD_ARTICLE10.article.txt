Editor, Daily Palo Alto,
As one interested in dramatics at
Stanford, I want to make a suggestion,
addressed chiefly to the Sophomores,
for the betterment of conditions in
dramatics this year. At the present
time there is just one other dramatic
attraction scheduled for this semes
ter, i.e., the Ram's Head show. This
is unfortunate, not only from the
standpoint of attractions for this
semester, but doubly so when we con
sider what it means in the way of
crowding next semester.
Consider for a moment the outlook
for next semester. First the Masquers
play, then the Sophomore, the Junior
opera, the English Club play, the Sen
ior farce, and the possibility of a track
show, in addition to which we are to
have two concerts in the musical as
sociation series. This makes five stud
ent attractions assured, with the pos
sibility of a sixth, and two concerts;
surely an overdose for one semester.
Another unfortunate aspect of the
situation is this, that this semester we
are entirely without a tryout show of
any kind from which to recruit new
material for dramatic work. As 1 un
derstand the situation it is impossible
for the English Club to produce their
play this semester. But why cannot
the Sophomores put on their play iu
the latter part of November? This
would give the members of the Sopho
more east, an opportunity to appear
in some of the later productions of
the year, would relieve the congested

condition next semester, and would
give us one more play this semester.
If the Sophomores could give their
show as the football show they would
be assured of a full house, thus mak
ing the financial return far greater
than they can possibly hope to have
it, as one of a hall dozen attractions
next semester.
I am firmly convinced that unless
something is done to distribute the
dramatic attractions, more e/enly over
the two semesters, the interest in such
productions will wane, simply because
the student body cannot be expected
to turn out to support six plays com
ing in rapid succession within a few
weeks of each other, four of which are
straight plays, similar in their appeal.
The Sophomores can, if they act
promptly, choose their play within the
next two weeks, leaving nearly live
weeks for rehearsals before the foot
ball game, or nearly seven weeks if
they decide upon a later date, ample
time in either case. There are no
plans as yet for a football show, and
I can see no reason why the Sopho
mores should not be allowed to pro
duce it. If so, as 1 said before, the
financial return to them will be far
larger, and they will materially aid
the cause of Stanford dramatics.
I urge this suggestion strongly upon
the Sophomore play committee.
Respectfully, W. B. Owens.

condition next semester, and would
give us one more play this semester.
If the Sophomores could give their
show as the football show they would
be assured of a full house, thus mak
ing the financial return far greater
than they can possibly hope to have
it, as one of a hall dozen attractions
next semester.
I am firmly convinced that unless
something is done to distribute the
dramatic attractions, more e/enly over
the two semesters, the interest in such
productions will wane, simply because
the student body cannot be expected
to turn out to support six plays com
ing in rapid succession within a few
weeks of each other, four of which are
straight plays, similar in their appeal.
The Sophomores can, if they act
promptly, choose their play within the
next two weeks, leaving nearly live
weeks for rehearsals before the foot
ball game, or nearly seven weeks if
they decide upon a later date, ample
time in either case. There are no
plans as yet for a football show, and
I can see no reason why the Sopho
mores should not be allowed to pro
duce it. If so, as 1 said before, the
financial return to them will be far
larger, and they will materially aid
the cause of Stanford dramatics.
I urge this suggestion strongly upon
the Sophomore play committee.

Editor, Daily Palo Alto,
As one interested in dramatics at
Stanford, I want to make a suggestion,
addressed chiefly to the Sophomores,
for the betterment of conditions in
dramatics this year. At the present
time there is just one other dramatic
attraction scheduled for this semes
ter, i.e., the Ram's Head show. This
is unfortunate, not only from the
standpoint of attractions for this
semester, but doubly so when we con
sider what it means in the way of
crowding next semester.
Consider for a moment the outlook
for next semester. First the Masquers
play, then the Sophomore, the Junior
opera, the English Club play, the Sen
ior farce, and the possibility of a track
show, in addition to which we are to
have two concerts in the musical as
sociation series. This makes five stud
ent attractions assured, with the pos
sibility of a sixth, and two concerts;
surely an overdose for one semester.
Another unfortunate aspect of the
situation is this, that this semester we
are entirely without a tryout show of
any kind from which to recruit new
material for dramatic work. As 1 un
derstand the situation it is impossible
for the English Club to produce their
play this semester. But why cannot
the Sophomores put on their play iu
the latter part of November? This
would give the members of the Sopho
more east, an opportunity to appear
in some of the later productions of
the year, would relieve the congested

condition next semester, and would
give us one more play this semester.
If the Sophomores could give their
show as the football show they would
be assured of a full house, thus mak
ing the financial return far greater
than they can possibly hope to have
it, as one of a hall dozen attractions
