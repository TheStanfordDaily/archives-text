Dr. Rashdall is a scholar, author,
and teacher of unusual note in Eng
land. Since his graduation from Ox
ford in 1881 he has been closely asso
ciated with the institution for thirty
two years. I lis ollices have included
that of lecturer, tutor, chaplain, and
select preacher.
His academic connections have been
with Hereford, Balliol, and New Col
leges at Oxford, and through that re
lation he has gained intimate under
standing of college men. Among the
degrees of Dr. Rashdall are: D. Litt.,
D.C.L., from Durham, and LL.D. from
St. Andrews College.

Among the many printed studies
by Doctor Rashdall are some well
known works on the history of educa
tion.
The committee that has secured the
services of Dr. Rashdall for the pres
ent lectures considers the choice for
tunate, since he is one of the prom
inent preachers and scholars of the
day.
The West Memorial Lecture founda
tion was established by Mr. F. W.
West and wife, of Seattle, Washing
ton, in memory of their son, Raymond
F. West, 1902-5, who was drowned in
the Eel River in 190 G. The income on
an endowment of $10,000 is used to
bring distinguished scholars to the
university in alternate years, on the
general field of immortality, conduct
and destiny. Two series have been
delivered to date.
The series this semester does not
appear on the regular schedule. The
third regular series will be given next
year.
