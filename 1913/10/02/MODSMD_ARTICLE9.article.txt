# Too Many Shows.
## 
### 
Six dramatic productions in one
semester, in addition to numerous
musical attractions, represent a super
abundance of theatrical effort. The
communication published today is
timely, as the semester has not pro
gressed so far that it is impossible to
alleviate the crowded condition which
the dramatic calendar promises to
have next semester. From a financial
standpoint it would be advisable for
some of the organizations to deprive
us of the privilege of a performance.
if the present high plane of liis
tronic art is to prevail at Stanford it
is necessary that the new material be
given an opportunity to try out dur
ing the first, semester. The Sopho
more show seems to be the logical
play to stage during the late fall.
Originally the Sophomore show was
given at this time. But judging from
the temper of "after the game audi
ences" a show of the "stunt" nature
seems better adapted than a straight
performance. The listeners are usu
ally fatigued from the afternoon's ex
citement, and something of the after
dinner variety is desired.
