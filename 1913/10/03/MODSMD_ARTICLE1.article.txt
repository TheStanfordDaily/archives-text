Watkins, Card, Blase, Darsie, Erb,
Austin, Carroll, Andrews, Reeves,
Thoburn, Urban, Brown, and Tilton.
The Barbarians will invade the
campus tomorrow as the opponents
of the Varsity. Two weeks ago the
clubmen held the Cardinal players
to an 8-5 score in a game that was
replete with excitement. Tomorrow
the black jerseyed lineup will meet a
strong fifteen named by Coach Brown,
and the match should be a good one.
The Freshmen are scheduled to ap
pear against Belmont, while a second
team will play an extra game on the
auxiliary field with the ruggers from
Palo Alto high. Following this con
test the Grays and Blacks will try
conclusions for two short periods.
The end of the fourth week of prac
tice finds the big Rugby squad on
Stanford Field divided into four sec
tions for the benefit of the coaches,
and each man settled into a fairly
definite routine. Every Saturday each
section is to have a game, two to be
staged on the Varsity field and two
on the auxiliary turf.
Tiie Varsity.
In the Varsity front rank Soper,
Peck and Wines have been named to
lock shoulders with the Barb for
wards. Clover and Watkins will again
be the middle rankers, with Blase as
lock. Card and Darsie will be the
breakaways.
Erb is to take the ball as it is heel
ed back by the scrum, while Austin
and Carroll are the five eighths. Lacli
mund will play in the center three
position, with Reeves and Urban on
: he wings, and Brown at full.

Training Table.
Seventeen men of the Rugby squad
have been picked to go under Varsity
training table rules during the re
mainder of the season. The hospital
ity of the Phi Delta Theta house has
been accepted, and the squad will
make its home there with Captain
Thoburn. Sunday morning the squad
will report to Trainer Maloney for
their first prescribed meal.
This year's list exceeds that of last
season by three names. The train
ing table has been in operation since
1911, and may now be considered a
fixture in the coaching system.
The coming visit of the All Blacks
has hastened the establishment of the
training table, making it necessary
to get the squad in playing trim at
once as did that o r the Waratahs last
last season.
Names on the list may be changed
and shifted from time to time at the
discretion of the coaches, Captain
Thoburn and Trainer .Maloney. Fol
lowing are those who are to report
today: Hall, Peck. Wines, Clover,
Watkins, Card, Blase, Darsie, Erb,
Austin, Carroll, Andrews, Reeves,
Thoburn, Urban, Brown, and Tilton.
