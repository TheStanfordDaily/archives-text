An observer has taken occasion to
criticise the singing of the "sixth
line - ' of our university hymn. From
a sprightly march "Hail, Stanford,
llail" lias been sung into a funeral

dirge. To say that the sing
ing of the hymn has been
wretched is a mild use of

the language. It is not merely the
"sixth line" which needs attention,
but the entire song. The writers of
the words and music never intended
that "Hail. Stanford, Hail" was to be
rendered as a mournful chant. Some
of the musical directors or organiza
tions can do no better service than
to teach the college public how to
sing their own hymn.
