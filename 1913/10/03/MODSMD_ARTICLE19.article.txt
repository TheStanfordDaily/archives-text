Editor, Daily Palo Alto: â€”
Is it not time that the band and
song leaders came to some agreement
i. l>on the time in which we are to sing
the sixth line of "Hail, Stanford,
Hail?" The hand plays the music for
this line as it is written and as it
ought to be sung to keep the rythm
and swing of the verse and (he music.
It should take the same amount of
time to sing the last two words,
"voices hailing," as it takes to sing
ilie first four. That is, a quarter note
is given to each of the four words,
"Here we raise our," and two quar
ter notes to each of the words, "voices
hailing." What we did yesterday, and
have done for the past year in every
assembly, was to add an extra meas
ure to the music by giving two half
notes to each of the words, "voices
hailing." If the majority prefers to
sing our hymn in the new time, the
least that can be done is to change
the band's playing of it.
Those of us who have heard it sung
in assemblies here in earlier years,
us the iiuthor and composer intended
to have it sung, cannot help feeling
that the original is the more musical
and rythmical, that it. better expresses
the spirit of our hymn. We suggest
that the words and music be printed
in The Daily Palo Alto, or that the
(ilee Club be asked to sing it, or the
band to play it alone once or twice at
assembly. We feel that if the correct
rendering were known, it would be
rcme the popular one. A Student.
