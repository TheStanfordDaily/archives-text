# RAM'S HEAD WILL STAGE FOOTBALL PERFORMANCE
## DATE OF PRODUCTION CHANGED TO NOVEMBER 8. Cast Promises Finished Playâ€”Tryouts Will Be Held Tomorrow Morning. 
### 
Ram's Head will stage the football
. how. At a request from the Execu
tive Committee 111 dramatic society
changed its date from October 18,
as was originally intended, to the ev
ening of November S.
Under the supervision of Fred Car
iyle, the cast, consisting of over thir
ty men, is rehearsing regularly. With
over two weeks more in which to per
fect the acting than was originally
planned, the play promises to be far
ahead of anything ever attempted in
that line. "Rambling Rameses," as
presented by Ram's Head last year,
was a decided success, and present in
dications are that this season's show
will far surpass the former produc
tion.
Originality prevails throughout the
iew piece. The musical numbers are
;he work of J. McDonald, '14, and W.
Wilson, '13, who produced the music
for "Rambling Rameses." E. E..Chase.
'11, has also contributed to the list.
Coach Carlyle is greatly pleased
with the number out for practice and
promises an unequaled performance.
Those who have not yet tried-out and
intend to do so must appear at the re
hearsal on Saturday morning, as this
will be the last chance to enter. The
tryouts will last about a week before
the cast and chorus is announced.
