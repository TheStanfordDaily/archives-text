# EXPOSITION DIRECTORS ASK MALONEY'S ADVICE.
## Stanford Expert To Give Suggestions On Fencing and Staging of Contests. 
### 
Trainer H. W. Maloney announced
recently at the meeting of the Mask
and Foil that he had been asked by
the directors of the sports in the
Panama-Pacific International Expo
sition to confer with them regarding
fencing on the Pacific Coast, and to
offer suggestions concerning the Ex
position contests.
The notification came in a letter
from J. J. McGovern, secretary to
John L. Sullivan, General Director of
Athletics, who said that fencing
would be featured among the sports
held during the Exposition. Because
of its international prominence as an
art in the military and naval services
of all nations, many countries will be
represented in the fencing tourna
ments.
The Stanford expert hopes to enter
a fencing team from the university
in the Exposition tournaments. It
will be necessary to start work at
once.
Trainer Maloney announced after
witnessing several fast bouts that the
outlook for the coming year was very
bright, lie has arranged to give fenc
ing lessons on Fridays between ten
and twelve o'clock in the Encina gym
nasium.
