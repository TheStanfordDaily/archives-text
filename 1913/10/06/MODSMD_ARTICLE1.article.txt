# BARBARIANS FALL PREY TO CARDINAL PLAYERS
## 18-0 IS SCORE OF SATURDAY'S RUGBY GAME Freshmen Take Long End of 21.3 Score From Belmont School Ruggers. 
### 
The black jerseyed combination of
rugby players lined up against (ho
Cardinal varsity on Saturday in the
fourth game of the season, proved an
easy one for the Stanford ruggers 10
solve, and the clubmen were defeated
18 to 0. Both teams played ragged ,
football for the most part, and to tlu> i
disappointment of the bleacherites
the forwards again managed to crowd
the backs out of the limelight. It was
a game for the scrum men, but those
players made it fast enough to keep
the crowd on edge for sixty minutes
of rugby.
The Barbs played a good defensive
game at times, and stopped many
passing rushes by the Varsity backs
at the Hrst or second five positions.
King proved a good fullback lor the
clubmen, and Brown and Boulware
were always in the thick of it in the
scrum. The Cardinal scrum worked
well as a unit and got the ball from
the Barb hookers for their share of
times.
In the curtain raiser, the Freshmen
defeated Belmont 21 to i5. The Cardi
nal babes played one of their best :
games of the season, showing a will- I
ingness at all times to get into the
scrimmages and follow up the ball.
The Varsity.
A free kick awarded to Stanford
started the ball rolling for the Var
sity, and within a few minutes of the
first whistle Card and Darsie went
across the Barb line with the pigskin,
Card scoring. Brown easily convert
ed.
Dribbling the hall soon took play
back into Black territory, and a short
passing rush, Darsie to Wines to
Gard, sent the breakaway over for
the second try. The angle was a
more difficult one than the first, and
Brown failed to add the two points.
The third try proved rather spec
tacular, Carroll and Crary taking the
ball close to the Barb line, where Dar
sie picked ui> Carroll's short punt and
dashed across. Brown couldn't miss
the goalposts, and the score read
Stanford 13, Barbs 0.
The second half furnished a more
strenuous session for the Varsity, and
tor the first ten minutes their oppon
ents had things their own way. The
action was afterwards at about cen
ter, neither team obtaining a decided
advantage. The one try of the half
was made in the last minutes, Gard
intercepting a pass from Worswick
and sliding across from the ten yard
line. Darsie added the two points,
and the final score read 18 to 0.
The Fresh men.
Townsend and Dickey were the first
scoring combination for the Fresh
men, and following West's failure to
convert, they tried the same combina
tion again, and with Iluttman's help
added the second three points. West
converted. Nagcl and Huttruan are
credited with the second try, made
after Nagel's good run. West con
verted, and the scoring ended for the
half.
Mayberry again found an end run
equal to a score. Huttman made the
first try and West converted.
Belmont's one score was made by a
penalty kick near tlie end of the hall',
Fisher dropping the ball over the
crossbar for three points.
The second Varsity and St.Mary's
rugby teams played through twenty
minute halves to a no score tie after
the Varsity match. During the entire
play the ball ricocheted freely from
one goal to the other. The final pis
tol found the ball near the center
field.
In a snappy battle on the auxiliary
turf, the second Freshman rugby
team defeated the Palo Alto high
school second team by a score of 18-0.
