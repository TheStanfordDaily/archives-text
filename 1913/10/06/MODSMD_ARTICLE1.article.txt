### 
The black jerseyed combination of
rugby players lined up against (ho
Cardinal varsity on Saturday in the
fourth game of the season, proved an
easy one for the Stanford ruggers 10
solve, and the clubmen were defeated
18 to 0. Both teams played ragged ,
football for the most part, and to tlu> i
disappointment of the bleacherites
the forwards again managed to crowd
the backs out of the limelight. It was
a game for the scrum men, but those
players made it fast enough to keep
the crowd on edge for sixty minutes
of rugby.
The Barbs played a good defensive
game at times, and stopped many
passing rushes by the Varsity backs
at the Hrst or second five positions.
King proved a good fullback lor the
clubmen, and Brown and Boulware
were always in the thick of it in the
scrum. The Cardinal scrum worked
well as a unit and got the ball from
the Barb hookers for their share of
times.
In the curtain raiser, the Freshmen
defeated Belmont 21 to i5. The Cardi
nal babes played one of their best :
games of the season, showing a will- I
ingness at all times to get into the
scrimmages and follow up the ball.
The Varsity.
A free kick awarded to Stanford
started the ball rolling for the Var
sity, and within a few minutes of the
first whistle Card and Darsie went
across the Barb line with the pigskin,
Card scoring. Brown easily convert

Dribbling the hall soon took play
