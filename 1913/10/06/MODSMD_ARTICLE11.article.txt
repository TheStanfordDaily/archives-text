# The
						Stanford "Minster"

### 
Resumption of services in the Me
morial Church is a distinct addition
to the richness of life at Stanford.
Famed round the world for its beauty,
its symmetry, its massiveness and
wonderful mosaic work, the Stanford
"Minster" has been aptly titled by
one of the university's most distin
guished alumni the "Picture Book"
church. To those who were here be
fore the destruction of the structure

on the fateful April morn
ing in 1906 the church
brings back pleasant mem
ories. There is a certain
feeling of reverence em-

bodied in the very edifice itself which
makes it a privilege to attend the
Sabbath services.
.lust two years ago the Trustees
announced their intention of rebuild
ing the church. The work of restora
tion will be completed in the fullness
of time and the services are to be
held regularly. The place of the
Memorial Church in the university is
best exemplified by the following ex
cerpt from a letter written by the
Mother of the university:
"I endeavored to make the edifice
sacred by beautifying it with statues
of the Holy Family and Christ's Apos
tles, with mosaic pictures relating to
the life of our precious Saviour, and
stories told in the old Bible. I did
this to impress the students and to aid
the preacher in doing the work among
precious souls, seeking for light for
which we earnestly pray. Without
teaching a belief in God and His be
loved Son and life beyond this earth,
the university fails in its most vital
importance It should make an effort
to enlighten souls in darkness, and
not send forth young men and women
into the world fitted only to battle
with life on the lowest plane, with
never a thought of any obligation
towards a tender living God, never a
thought of a time of reckoning be
yond this short fleeting life. This
life on earth is only a kindergarten
school, preparing each one of us for
a higher education in the Better Life.
All that makes life sweet, and the
glory of life here among the rich or
poor is the belief in the teaching of
our Lord Jesus. There is but one
ideal character, and that is the one
who lives near to God through joy
and sorrow."
