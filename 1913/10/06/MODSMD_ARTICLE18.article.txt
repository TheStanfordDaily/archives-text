### 
The strange blight which has
struck the eucalypti in the arboretum
is being investigated by members of
the Botany and Entomology depart
ments. The trees become infected at
the crown and the yellow color so
noticeable the last few weeks is grad
ually working down.
Superintendent J. E. Hewston at
tributes the dying-off to last winter's
lreeze. Professor R. \Y r . Doane, head
of the Entomology department, de
clares that insects have not caused
the disease. Professor D. H. Camp
bell is not certain of the cause, but is
Prone to lay it to the cold weather
or continued drouth. Investigation
will be continued until the cause has
been ascertained, as the trees are too
joung to be falling before the decay
of old age.
