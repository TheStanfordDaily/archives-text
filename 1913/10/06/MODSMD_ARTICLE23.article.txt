# TRACK MEN COMPETE IN PRELIMINARY MEET
## 
### 
Stanford trackmen were given their
first workout of the season in a pre
liminary meet on Saturday. But few
of the veterans competed, as the meet
was intended primarily for the new
men. As is customary, all the dis
tance races were shortened. Cross
country runners competed in a free
for-all relay race in order to become
accustomed to running on the cinder
track.
