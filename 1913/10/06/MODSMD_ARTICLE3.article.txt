# SUNDAY SERVICES REOPEN THE MEMORIAL CHURCH
## Chaplain Gardner Emphasizes in Sermon Function of Church Is Function of the University. 
### 
With the reopening of the Memorial
Church yesterday morning the crowd
ed assembly listened to a strong ami
inspiring sermon by Rev. I). Charles
Gardner, University Chaplain. In the
course of the address Chaplain Gard
ner said:
"I congratulate yau on the privi
lege of worshiping again within these
walls. We meet in a place hallowed
by many sacred memories. The
church is different, yet it is the same.
Stone by stone it has been restored,
practically as it was before, strength
ened only by skill and steel.
"The function of the church is the
making of better men and women, and
that, in the last analysis, is the func
tion of the university. 1 believe that
it has been proved that religion has
a function in relation to education,
and that a 11011-sectarian church can
minister to the spiritual life of the
university. So far we have avoided
sensation. We have escaped notori
ety. We have been spared contro
versy. Not one single word has
vexed or disturbed the inner life
of this church in the past ten
years."
Speaking of the deeper genius of
tiie church, Chaplain Gardner quoted
the motto to be placed in stained
glass over the vestibule door "Domi

nils illuminatio niea;" translated "The
Lord is niv light," and said; "Out of
the beautiful sunshine of (!od's pres
ence came llie Christ. The Sun of
Righteousness, the glory of I lis life
streams through the life of every suc
ceeding century, teaching the sad
sweet face of our humanity to look
onward, upward, heavenward, and
forward.
" It will be one function of this pul
pit to interpret for this and every
succeeding generation the wonder and
mystery, as well as the simplicity and
beauty of the Man of Nazareth. He
said of Himself, '[ am the light of
the word.' And the work of this
church will be done just so far as :t
wins men and women to the faith
which enables them to say in reply,
'the Lord is my light.'"
Rev. Gardner closed with a strong
appeal to each of the different ele
ments in the congregation to help
him make the church a center of
light. "Help me to make Stanford a
city set upon a hill, whose spiritual
light shall shine through all the state
of California."
Under the leadership of L. H. Eaton,
the University Organist, the choir,
composed of the combined Schubert
and Glee clubs, sang the anthem,
"Send Out Thy Light."
