### 
Stanford men of San Francisco and
the bay cities feted President liranner
Friday night in the new clubhouse of
the San Francisco Press Club. The
attendance was large, as it was tlio
first opportunity the college men of
the city had of greeting President
Brainier as the new executive. The
college community, faculty and un
dergraduate body were well repre
sented.
The affair was in the nature of a
banquet. Charles K. Field, '95, editor
of the Sunset Magazine and president of
the Bohemian Club, presided as toast
master. Responses were given by
Timothy Hopkins, president of the
Board of Trustees, J. F. English, '01,
assistant district attorney of San
Francisco county, Dr. J. M. Stillman,
vice president of the university, Ed
ward Nutter, '02, and President Bran
ner.
President Brainier was urged by
all the speakers to reconsider his de
termination of retiring at the end of
two years. Not only was this senti
ment voiced in the toast, but a dele
gation of Brazilian warriors fought
their way into the room to urge that
lie remain at Stanford instead of re
turning to Brazil, as they intimated
lie would do. The words of the
spokesman of tiie Amazon warriors,
Shirley Baker, '.'tr>, wore translated by
the toastniaster. His speecli was a
burlesque upon portions of President
Branner's installation address, and
his recent trip to Brazil was also
spoken of by the armed men from the
southland.
Stanford songs, Stanford yells, and
Stanford stories made up the rest of
the evening. It was a rousing "get
together" meeting in which the pion
eers rubbed elbows with the under
graduates. Every class that has grad
uated from the university was repre
sented.
