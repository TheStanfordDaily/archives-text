# Leaders
## 
### 
Mere ability to wave tbe arms m
rythmetic motion to the accompani
ment of a leather-lunged rooting sec
tion should not in itself be a suffi
cient qualification to entitle a man to

a position of college yell
leaders. It may be said that
leaders like poets are born

and nut made. This should apply
equally as well to the directors ot
the cheering throng 011 the bleachers.
If the yell leader does not have the
personal magnetism to hold the con
fidence of his followers he will be a
failure. This should be given consid
eration in expressing a preference foi
the men who are seeking to be chos
en to the assistant yell leaders* posi
tions.
Tomorrow afternoon the last
"straw" vote is to be taken 011 the
bleachers. This vote is the barome
ter by which the Executive Committee
gauges its action in the selection of
the yell leaders.
It should not merely represent the
wishes of a few close friends or one
or two crowds hut should be the senti
ment of the entire number of men stu
dents.
