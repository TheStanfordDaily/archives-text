# DR. RASHDALL FAVORS RATIONAL MORALITY IN ASSEMBLY ADDRESS
## Oxford Scholar Compares Emotional Control With That of Reason In West Lecture. 
### 
The Reverend Dr. Hastings Rasli
dall, Canon of Hereford and Fellow
of Oxford, gave the first of the series
of three West Memorial lectures in
the Assembly Hall this morning,
choosing the topic "Moral Reason or
Moral Sense." Dr. Rashdall was in
troduced by Vice-President .John Max
son Stillman. Parts of the address
follow:
"We are all conscious of approv
ing some kinds of conduct and con
demning others. We all attribute
some distinctive meaning to the
terms right and wrong. In the pres
ent lecture I shall venture to assume
that much—and something more. The
question which I propose to discuss
is the nature of the phenomenon—
what is the real character of the men
tal act which takes place in our minds
when we call this act right, that one
wrong.
"Through the history of moral phil
osophy there have been two explana
tions of this act. Some have treated
moral approbation as essentially an
act of judgment and reason, coming
from the intellectual side of our men
tal nature. Others have regarded it
simply as a particular sort of feel
ing or emotion, or complex of emo
tions.
"So long as we have a conscience,
what matter whether we call it reas
on or moral sense? 'A rose by any
other name would smell as sweet.'
"Historically the moral sense theo
ry was a protest against the system
of theological hedonism. The real
tendency of the moral sense theory
was first brought out by David Hum::.
He considered it merely a sensation
which had no claim to authority or
superiority over other emotions.
"Morality, according to Hume, 's
simply a name for the fact of social
approbation. It is clear that all no
tion of an intrinsic, moral obligation,
of an absolute 'ought,' of ethical ob
jectivity must disappear from such a
system as this.
"The only objectivity which our
moral judgments on this view can
possibly possess depend upon the
counting of heads. Such a system is
as fatal to utilitarianism as to any
other kind of morality. Utility, ac
cording to Hume, is the true criterion
of morality so long as utility pleases.
"I am endeavoring to show you that
there are such things as self evident
moral judgments. I do not believe
that any act can be pronounced right
or wrong without references to its
consequence.
"In the moral conscience of man
at its highest, is an expression of the
highest will. On that fact must rest
the hope that this world is merely a
phase—a stage, and not the whole
life of man. The hope of immortality
must rest on a belief in a righteous
and loving God, based on a moral con
sciousness which is no mere sense or
emotion, but the activity of reason."
Dr. Rashdall will continue the ser
ies tomorrow evening at 8 o'clock in
the Chapel.
