# ALL BLACKS TAKE MEASURE OF OLYMPICS BY IS TO 0.
## New Zealand Forwards Show Skill in Serum and In Dribblingâ€”Backs Prove Disappointment. 
### 
Three weeks on board ship did not
slow up the "All Blacks" very ma
terially, if the score of IS to 0 for
Saturday's contest with the Olympics
can )>e taken as evidence. The New
Zealanders did not play up to their
expected form in the first half, but
the second period found them more
accustomed to the dirt field, and the
Winged O ruggers were swept off
their feet.
The forwards made ;i great im
pression 011 the spectators, as they
averaged some six feet in height and
ISO pounds in weight, and yet they
were past masters at the art of drib
bling the ball. The phrase "educated
toe-work" seems to be taken as de
scriptive of their skill in advancing
the ball.
The "All Blacks" crossed to Berke
ley yesterday and will be the guests
of the University of California for
several days. They will meet the
Blue and Gold Varsity for the first
time 011 Wednesday.
