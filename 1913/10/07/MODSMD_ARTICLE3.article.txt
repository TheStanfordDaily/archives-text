Arthur Shafer, ex-'l4, infielder of
the New York "Giants", will write of
the World's Series baseball games ex
clusively for "The Daily Palo Alto."
Shafer's complete story dealing with
today's game, the contests to follow,
and inside "dope," will appear in to
morrow evening's edition of this pa
per.
Shafer attended Stanford in the fall
of 1911, and in the spring of the fol
lowing year rejoined McGraw's team.
During the past year he batted .28S
and led the club in home-run hits on
the Polo Grounds. He is one of the
fastest men in either of the big
leagues, and is a sensational fielder.
