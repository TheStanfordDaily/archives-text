### 
Santa Clara will oppose tlie Fresh
men in the regular midweek game of
rugby tomorrow. This is the second
appearance of the Mission ruggers
011 Stanford Field this season, their
first invasion having been against the
second varsity on September 20, when
they took the long end of a 15 to 0
score.
The game tomorrow promises to ne
the hardest of the season for the 1917
aggregation, as the Santa Clara team
is of varsity calibre, and under the
coaching of Walsh, an English rugby
player, has developed into a strong
scoring machine. The exact lineup
to be used by the Catholic players
has not been announced.
Coach Brown has named to repre
sent the Freshmen fifteen strong
players, who should be able to give
a good account of first year rugby
skill. The game against Belmont on
Saturday was the best exhibition of
football the Freshmen have given
thus far, and tomorrow's match
should be fast from start to finish.
The Freshman line-up will be as
follows:—Scovel, Smitherum, McNul
ty, Halsted, Hammou, Harris, Swigart,
forwards; Scott, wing forward;
Townsend, half; Dickey, Huttman,
