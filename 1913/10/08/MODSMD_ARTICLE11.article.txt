To facilitate the handling of appli
cations for tickets to the big game,
October 11th has been fixed as abso
lutely the last date for filing orders
for seats. After 5 o'clock on Friday

requests for reservations are
to be filled by a chance draw
ing without any regard to

preference except in the matter of
time of arrival. Purchasers of tickets
should send in their applications im
mediately.
It is well to remind those who in
tend purchasing seats in the rooters'
section that this space is reserved only
for those who expect to lend their aid
to the yell leaders in making the
stunts and cheering a success. These
places are not put aside for friends
and acquaintances of the students and
those who attend the game merely as
spectators may find accomodations in
other sections. This,"fact should be
remembered by the undergraduates in
applying for tickets.
