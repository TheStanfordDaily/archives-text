# UNIVERSITY LIBRARIAN STUDIES NEW BUILDINGS
## 
### 
A thorough study of the libraries of
the east, with a view to formulating
plans for the new Stanford library,
was made by Librarian G. T. Clark
during his recent absence from the
campus. The tour was made at the
request of the Stanford trustees.
Clark inspected all the more im
portant library buildings of recent
construction, and was enabled also to
study the plans of several buildings
either about to be started or already
under way, such as the Widener Me
morial building, at Harvard, the
Brooklyn public library, the Univers
ity of Missouri library, the the library
to be erected at Columbia, and the
Johns Hopkins University library, in
course of construction at Baltimore.
The librarian reports finding on his
travels a keen interest in the affairs of
Stanford University, particularly with
reference to the recent administrative
changes.
