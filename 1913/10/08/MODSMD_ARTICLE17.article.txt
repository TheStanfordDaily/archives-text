Editor, Daily Palo Alto:
Dear Sir: —Many a time and oft,
from the pulpit and the proscenium, by
our preceptors and our fellow stud
ents, have we been extended the large
glad hand. Student advisor after
student advisor has advised us to take
this golden opportunity and meet our
professors. Now that is all very well
and all that, but it is seldom that the
advice is carried out.
In the good old clays, when every
one was new to Stanford, the profess
ors houses were the meeting places of
the best men and women in the uni
versity. Then somebody shoved the
bottom out and we who came after
could not bridge the gap.
From then till now, we have trav
elled on, side by side, like two tele
phone wires—only meeting for busi
ness. As they say in the sawmill :;t
Battle Week, "There's a reason." Two
or three in fact. Probably the stud
ents would visit the faculty if invited.
Even so there is a dress-suit feeling
experienced by many when visiting
their pastors and masters. The only
community of interest lies in the stud
ies which bind the two "sides of the
quadrangle" together, and the Lord
knows that in the ordinary course of
events we hear enough of those in
class periods. Yet imagine that there
are some really quite human species
of the Faculty who can talk the jargon
of the students. Let these Facilitate
Domestica but give us the sign and we
will spring immediately into the bos
om of their families.
To paraphrase the girls in the bal
lad. "Why don't you ask us sirs, we
say." We're bashful. That's all.
.T. S.
