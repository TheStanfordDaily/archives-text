# GENERAL PUBLIC TO BE ABLE TO SEE BIG GAME
## Standing Room Provided to Accommodate Crowds as Demand for Tickets Warrants. 
### 
The general public will be able to
see the big game between California
and Stanford on Nevember 8. A
means of providing for the demands
of all those not directly connected
with the university has been provided.
The Hoard of Control solved the
problem by supplying standing room
to all those unable to secure the paste
boards which admit of a bleacher
seat.
At the present time there is ample
space wired off at the end of the foot
ball turf under the score board where
over 3000 people will be able to secure
accommodation. A committee has been
appointed consisting of Professor C.
B. Wing, Graduate Manager R. W.
Wilcox, and E. P. Campbell, '13, to
consider the advisability of enlarging
this standing space.
If an advance sale of seats warrants
it, the fence will be moved further
back t|id additional space annexed to
the present accommodations. The ad
visability of throwing up the dirt and
making a gradual slope from the back
fence to the turf or erecting a plat
form will be considered. The entire
problem lies in how great the demand
by the public is for standing room
tickets.
