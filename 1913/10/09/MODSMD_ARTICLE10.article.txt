With the organization of the Uni
versity Conference last evening and
the selection of the five members of
the Council, the functions of student
self government are being performed
by representatives of the Student
Body. The men who compose these

two bodies are chosen be
cause they are in touch with
student sentiment and un-

derstand student problems. The Con
ference is a legislative body, the Coun
cil also acts as the judicial body.
The Council members are not secret
service agents. Neither are they rab
idly puritanical in their beliefs. But
certain rules of conduct are -prescrib
ed. Certain things are tabooed. In
fringement of the rules of the Con
ference will result in punishment.
Shall the system of self government
continue to be a success?
The answer lies in the support giv
en the Conference and Council by the
Student Body.
