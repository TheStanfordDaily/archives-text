# SECOND WEST LECTURE ON MORALITY OF SAVAGES
## CHAPEL ADDRESS THIS EVENING COMPLETES SERIES Eminent Oxford Scholar Discusses The Early Ethical Development Of the Race. 
### 
"The Morality of Savages" was the
subject ol' the second address given
by the eminent Dr. Hastings Rash
dall in the West Memorial series. He
said in part:
"In the present lecture I propose
a new form of what may lie compre
hensively called Emotionalism in
Ethics. The older school of Hutche
son. and Shaftesbury believed in a
single distinctive feeling of appro
bation or disapprobation.
"A far stronger case for the emo
tional view is presented by Dr. Mc-
Dougal in 'Social Psychology'. He re
cognized that primitive man was far
from the cold blooded utilitarian
which the older naturalists supposed.
Dr. McDougal traces the emergence
of human morality to the develop
ment, under the influence of growing
intelligence, of many different in
stincts which exist in the lower ani
mals, together with the emotional ex
citments which accompany the exer
cise of these instincts.
"It cannot be denied that the expla
nation of the reasons why particular
kinds of conduct first came to be ap
proved or disproved really is to be
fourd in emotions of a kind which is
simpler and more primitive form and
commonly shared by the lower ani
mals. It must be granted that the
tate of mind which induces savages
to resent anti-social, or even any sort
rf unsocial conduct, is very like the
'tate of mind which impels a llock of
wild birds to put to death the escan
ed cage bird, whose behavior is unlike
that of its wild fellow creatures.
"In his tribal customs, in his hat
red of the tribe's enemies, in his pas
sionate desire to avenge the death of
bis slaughtered kinsman, in his jeal
ous indignation at interference witli
his martial rights, it is difficult to
detect anything which is not similar
to the passions which may be pre
sumed from their outward actions un
der similar circumstances to have in
fluenced bis remote simian ancestors.
"There is no doubt in the savages
ideas of morality, as in his other ideas,
much confusion of categories. Hut
beneath all this confusion there
Is to be detected the germs of
a notion which the emotionalistic
ethic is quite incapable of explain
ing.
The lecturer then quoted from Pro
fessor Westermarch and other writ
ers statements which recognize the
existence in the savage of a sense of
justice, and this implies the idea of
an objective duty to be impartial in
conduct which cannot be explained
by any of the instincts or emotions
appealed to by the anthropological
moralists, and which can only be ex
plained by an intellectual conception
or category of duty.

to resent anti-social, or even any sort

"In his tribal customs, in his hat

fessor Westermarch and other writ
ers statements which recognize the
existence in the savage of a sense of
justice, and this implies the idea of
an objective duty to be impartial in

moralists, and which can only be ex

"The Morality of Savages" was the
subject ol' the second address given
by the eminent Dr. Hastings Rash
dall in the West Memorial series. He
said in part:
"In the present lecture I propose
a new form of what may lie compre
hensively called Emotionalism in
Ethics. The older school of Hutche
son. and Shaftesbury believed in a
single distinctive feeling of appro
bation or disapprobation.
"A far stronger case for the emo
tional view is presented by Dr. Mc-
Dougal in 'Social Psychology'. He re
cognized that primitive man was far
from the cold blooded utilitarian
which the older naturalists supposed.
Dr. McDougal traces the emergence
of human morality to the develop
ment, under the influence of growing
intelligence, of many different in
stincts which exist in the lower ani
mals, together with the emotional ex
citments which accompany the exer
cise of these instincts.
