# ARTISTIC MANEUVERS OF NEW ZEALAND TEAM BLANK BLUE AND GOLD
## "All Blacks" In Class Apart; 31-0 Resuit Useless for Stanford Dope-Sheet. 
### 
Hooting the ball between the goal
posts from the fifty yard line is a
sensational play in football at any
time but when such a feat is exe
cuted in the first few minutes of tht
game, it sets a standard of play for
the remainder of the match that re
quires the best of football experts '.o
maintain. Just such an example of
art in rugby was given by the "All
Blacks" in their first game with the
California varsity yesterday, when
the New Zealand fullback, Stohr,
started proceedings by calmly drop
ping the pigskin over the crossbar
from a point near center field. His
teammates, not to be outdone, played
up to that standard of rugby, and, as
a result, rolled up a score of thirty
one points against the Blue and Gold
zero.
Eight thousand people greeted the
team that is representing the New
Zealand Rugby Union as they trotted
out on California Field yesterday af
ternoon. And in the sixty minutes
of play those thousands learned some
of the possibilities of rugby.
It was very evident that the days
on shore had restored the "All
Blacks'" confidence on the field, for,
from the first whistle, they outplayed
their university opponents in every
department of the game. Dribbling
by the forwards was the feature of
the game, and in this style of play
every man showed himself to be won
derfully proficient. In the lineouts
the superior weight and strength of
the New Zealanders enabled them to
get the ball and drop it in front of
two or three forwards locked should
er to shoulder. Then the procession
toward the goal line would begin.
Their form in passing was in mark
ed contrast to that of the varsity, and
as it proved, was much more effective.
"Pass as occasion demands" seems to
be their rule.
The most conspicuous player on
the field was Roberts, the "All Black"
center three quarters. His is an un
usual all-round ability in backfield
play, as he is equally adept at dodg
ing and twisting through opposing
line and at getting off kicks in tight
places.
Varsity Fights Hard.
The game cannot be taken as a cri
terion for judgment upon the merits
of the California varsity, as they were
not given even a fighting chance and
could not show the results of train
ing and experience. They tackled
hard and fought every yard of the
New Zealand advance, putting every
ounce of their strength into the de
fense. McKim and "Bill" King were
probably the most conspicuous among
the forwards, with Fish doing good
work at breakaway. Captain Peart
was at second five, but few oppor
tunities came his way. Bogardus be
gan the game at full, but after the
"All Blacks" had made their four first
trips across the California line, Gian
elli was substituted. He found the
position a hazardous one, as the black
jerseyed men, with their bewildering
assortment ot' fake passes, short
kicks, and unexpected swerves and
dives, were continually in his terri
tory.
The Gil me.
The first half ended with the score
18 to 0. At the whistle for the second
period the varsity came on the field
determined to score, and for ten min
utes there seemed a chance of get
ting rid of the goose egg. But their
opponents were equal to the emer
gency.
Few of the tries were converted,
the boots being only half hearted at
tempts. In the second half two diffi
cult points for conversion awakened
the interest of Stohr, and he suc
ceeded in converting one try, miss
ing the second one by a narrow mar
gin. The New Zealanders will play
tiie Barbarians Saturday and will
come to Stanford the first of the week.
The California varsity will meet the
Santa Clara players this weekend.
