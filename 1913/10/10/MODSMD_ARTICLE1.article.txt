ber 10. —Bender today won his second
game of the Championship Series. The
Athletics took the game to 5, and
as a result the Giants will be. forced
to take two in a row to tie up the
series.
Demaree starting for the Giants was
an easy victim and was driven from
the mound at the end of the fourth,
lie was touched up for seven hits and
four runs. The first inning Marquard
worked he gave two runs, but later
had the Athletics at his mercy.
The Giants finished strong, making
three runs in the seventh and two in
the eighth. In this inning Burns'
double scored Fletcher, and a minute
later Shafer scored the shortstop
with a long triple. After Burns and
Murray had singled in the seventh,
Merkle slammed a hit deep into left
field which bounded into the bleachers
for a home run.
The luck broke against the Giants.
Two of the Athletics' hits would have
been easy outs had Snodgrass been
in condition. His "Charley Horse"
was so bad that he was forced out of
the game.
