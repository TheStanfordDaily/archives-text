# GAME WITH ALL BLACKS SHOULD SPEED UP PLAY OF OYMPICS TOMORROW
## 
### 
A three-deck rugby schedule will
provide interest for the bleachers to
morrow afternoon. The curtain rais
er will be staged at 2 o'clock, when
the Freshmen meet Berkeley high
school. At 3:15 the Varsity will take
on the Olympic club, which is sending
down practically the same team that
was defeated by the "All Blacks" 19-
0 last Saturday. In the final contest,
the Second Varsity and Titans will
oppose.
With the exception of Davidson in
place of Brown at full, and Hall for
Peck in the front rank, the Varsity is
unchanged from that which outscored
the Barbarians on Saturday. The
Winged "O" men have not played on
Stanford Field since the first game
of the season, when they carried off
the heavy end of a 5-3 score.
For the first time, the Titans, made
up of former California and Berkeley
high school men, are sending a
team to the campus to measure
up with the Second Varsity. They
have scored a win and a tie over the
California Varsity earlier in the sea
son, and were bested by California's
second team two weeks ago. Dickey
and Huttman have been promoted
from the Freshmen team to five
eighths berths on the Second Varsity.
Nineteen Seventeen will be repre
sented by the same fifteen that played
a tie match with the Santa Clara
freshmen Wednesday, with one change.
The place at five eighths left vacant
by Huttman will be filled tomorrow
by Patterson.
Polished backfield work, and ag
gressive scrums in the case of all
three Cardinal representatives have
rewarded the coaching of the past
week, and fast play should result to
morrow.
Following are the Stanford lineups;
Varsity: Soper, Hall, Wines, Clover,
Watkins, Card, Blase, Darsie, for
wards; Erb, half; Austin, Carroll, five
eighths; Lachmund, center; Reeves,
Crary, wings; Davidson, full.

Following are the Stanford lineups;
Varsity: Soper, Hall, Wines, Clover,
Watkins, Card, Blase, Darsie, for
wards; Erb, half; Austin, Carroll, five
eighths; Lachmund, center; Reeves,
Crary, wings; Davidson, full.
Second Varsity: Single, Fyfe, Clark,
Uehm, Vanderberg, Ogden, Orme,
Wright, forwards; Burns, half; Dick
ey, Huttman, five eighths; Halm, cen
ter; Dingley, Warren, wings; Detel
full.

Nulty, Halsted, Higgins, Harris, Swi
gart, forwards; Scott, wing forward;
Townsend, half; Horner, Patterson,
five eighths; Eyer, center; Sisson,
Mayberry, wings; West, full.
A three-deck rugby schedule will
provide interest for the bleachers to
morrow afternoon. The curtain rais
er will be staged at 2 o'clock, when
the Freshmen meet Berkeley high
school. At 3:15 the Varsity will take
on the Olympic club, which is sending
down practically the same team that
was defeated by the "All Blacks" 19-
0 last Saturday. In the final contest,
the Second Varsity and Titans will
oppose.
With the exception of Davidson in
place of Brown at full, and Hall for
Peck in the front rank, the Varsity is
unchanged from that which outscored
the Barbarians on Saturday. The
Winged "O" men have not played on
Stanford Field since the first game
of the season, when they carried off
the heavy end of a 5-3 score.
For the first time, the Titans, made
up of former California and Berkeley
high school men, are sending a
team to the campus to measure
up with the Second Varsity. They
have scored a win and a tie over the
California Varsity earlier in the sea
son, and were bested by California's
second team two weeks ago. Dickey
and Huttman have been promoted
from the Freshmen team to five
eighths berths on the Second Varsity.
Nineteen Seventeen will be repre
sented by the same fifteen that played
a tie match with the Santa Clara
freshmen Wednesday, with one change.
The place at five eighths left vacant
by Huttman will be filled tomorrow
by Patterson.
Polished backfield work, and ag
gressive scrums in the case of all
three Cardinal representatives have
rewarded the coaching of the past
week, and fast play should result to
morrow.
