# STUDENT MANAGEMENT OF EQUIPMENT CONSIDERED.
## Board of Control Thinks Undergraduate Charge of Athletic Building Is Feasible. 
### 
The Board of Control has consider
ed the feasibility of the propo
sition of the Board of Trustess
by the Student Body for as
suming the control ot' the new
gymnasium and the cost of the
stadium. The concensus of opinion
of both the Faculty and student mem
bers of the board is that the plan is
feasible from a financial standpoint.
This conclusion was reached after
checking up the receipts and expend
itures of the Student Body in the past
and taking an average estimate of the
receipts and expenses of the future.
The management and organization
of fields and equipments is the next
consideration in contemplation of the
proposed improvement. It is deemed
advisable to preserve the present
Student Body Executive Committee,
ind tho Board of Control with simi
lar functions as they now have.
The natural proposition which aris
es is that some head will have to be
selected to have entire clnrge of the
field and equipment, if the gymnas
ium and athletic management is plac
d entirely in the hands of the Stud
'l.'t Body there will necessarily have
o be some gymnasium and athletic
field directors. Under him would
come all assistants to take care of
Lhe gym classes. This plan of stud
ent control over gymnasium as con
e ived by the board is an original one
rid has never been attempted in any
of the large universities of the coun
try.
The Board of Control is taking an
active interest in the new responsi
' ililies contemplated by the Student
Bcdy and they meet, once a week to
consider plans and propositions as to
the manner of undertaking the new
schemes.
