# FINAL WEST MEMORIAL LECTURE HELD YESTERDAY
## Dr. Hastings Rashdall Tells of Views Held By the Late Professor James. 
### 
The concluding lecture of the West
Memorial series Dr. Hastings Rasli
dall devoted chiefly to a criticism of
the view held by the late Professor
James, which identifies ''the good"
with "the satisfactory." He pointed
out how James admits that all desires
cannot he satisfied, and that every ra
tional man will aim at satisfying as
many desires or aims as possible.
This "ideal objectivity," to use James*
own words, implied the recognition of
an ultimate principle "more satisfac
tion is better than less satisfaction."
and such a principle could he recog
nized by the Reason and not by the
Emotions.
"The first and most important conse
quence of this theory," declared the
speaker, "is that it gives us a ground
for inferring that if there is such a
thing as a world purpose, that pur
pose must he good; and that if that
purpose is the purpose of self-con
scious, rational will, that will must
be thought of as directed to the good,
and therefore as being good itself.
"However, there is no ground for
such an assumption except what is
derived from our own judgements of
value as possessing objective validity.
The mere fact that the universe seems
tending towards a certain end, will
not prove that end to he good.
"Only if we regard moral approba
tion as a rational judgement about
what ought to be, have we a right to
•issume that the Mind from which our
minds are derived will recognize their
truth and act upon it. Thus and thus
only, have we a, ground for inferring
that there is being realized by the
world's history an end or good which
Reason must pronounce to lie the best
possible.
"To put all this in more popular
language, the belief in Immortality
rests uiion our belief in God, and our
belief in God as a righteous and lov
ing Being must rest in the last resort
upon our belief in the objective truth
or validity of moral judgement of hu
manity at its highest. If God is a
Being in whom is evident the ideal
which our moral consciousness recog
nizes as good, it seems inconceivable
that he should give life to human
souls for the sake of such a life as
life is for most of them who enter it.
And if we can regard this life as a
preparation for a richer and fuller
life, can we reasonably regard life
as the goal toward which the whole
creation moves as good, and explain
the evil that is in it as the necessary
means for the realization of that end.'

preparation for a richer and fuller
life, can we reasonably regard life
as the goal toward which the whole
creation moves as good, and explain
the evil that is in it as the necessary
means for the realization of that end.'
The concluding lecture of the West
Memorial series Dr. Hastings Rasli
dall devoted chiefly to a criticism of
the view held by the late Professor
James, which identifies ''the good"
with "the satisfactory." He pointed
out how James admits that all desires
cannot he satisfied, and that every ra
tional man will aim at satisfying as
many desires or aims as possible.
This "ideal objectivity," to use James*
own words, implied the recognition of
an ultimate principle "more satisfac
tion is better than less satisfaction."
and such a principle could he recog
nized by the Reason and not by the
Emotions.
"The first and most important conse
quence of this theory," declared the
speaker, "is that it gives us a ground
for inferring that if there is such a
thing as a world purpose, that pur
pose must he good; and that if that
purpose is the purpose of self-con
scious, rational will, that will must
be thought of as directed to the good,
and therefore as being good itself.
"However, there is no ground for
such an assumption except what is
derived from our own judgements of
value as possessing objective validity.
The mere fact that the universe seems
tending towards a certain end, will
not prove that end to he good.
"Only if we regard moral approba
tion as a rational judgement about
what ought to be, have we a right to
•issume that the Mind from which our
minds are derived will recognize their
truth and act upon it. Thus and thus
only, have we a, ground for inferring
that there is being realized by the
world's history an end or good which
Reason must pronounce to lie the best
possible.
"To put all this in more popular
language, the belief in Immortality
rests uiion our belief in God, and our
belief in God as a righteous and lov
ing Being must rest in the last resort
upon our belief in the objective truth
or validity of moral judgement of hu
manity at its highest. If God is a
Being in whom is evident the ideal
which our moral consciousness recog
nizes as good, it seems inconceivable
that he should give life to human
souls for the sake of such a life as
life is for most of them who enter it.
And if we can regard this life as a
preparation for a richer and fuller
life, can we reasonably regard life
as the goal toward which the whole
creation moves as good, and explain
the evil that is in it as the necessary
means for the realization of that end.'
