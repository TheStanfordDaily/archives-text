# HOHFELD EXAMINES WAYS OF ADMITTING TO BAR
## Carnegie Foundation Will Make Report on all Law Schools of the Country. 
### 
Professor \V. N. llohfeld of the Law
Department has been apointed by the
Carnegie Foundation for the Advance
ment. of Education, to investigate the
system used for admitting candidates
to the bar and of conducting the bar
examinations in the states of Cali
fornia, Oregon and Washington. Pro
lesor llohfeld has already started his
work and has made the examination
in Oregon.
The Carnegie Foundation has begun
an investigation of all the law schools
of the country for the purpose of mak
ing a criticism of them, similar to
the report made by the same Founda
tion on the medical schools which has
been published. AH types of institu
tions teaching law will be investigat
ed, including regular day schools, night
schools and correspondence schools.
As an adjunct to this report the in
vestigation of the method of admitting
to the bar and of conducting bar ex
aminations in the different states is
being made with the purpose of rais
ing the qualifications for admission
and of making them more uniform in
ail of the different stales. This lat
ter work is being done at the request
of the American Bar Association.
On last Tuesday Professor lloh
feld was present, and questioned the
principals at the bar examination at
Salem for the State of Oregon. Next
week the examination will be held for
admission into the Washington bar at
Olympia and he will also be present
then. The fact that the next Cali
fornia examination will not be held
until the latter part of January will
prevent his report from being made
until after that time.
