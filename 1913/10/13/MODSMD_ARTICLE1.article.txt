Three victories for the Cardinal at
tended the rugby matches on Stanford
Field Saturday. The team combina
tions and the respective scores were:
Varsity-Olympics, 29-3; Freshmen-
Berkeley High, 2r>-0; Second Varsity-
Titans, 5-0.
The week-end spectators were treat
ed to the snappiest series of contests
that has been seen on the turf this
season. Stanford's Varsity backflebl
which was made up of Freshmen with
the exception of Tilton and Reeves
at half and wing, and the forwards
fell into excellent scoring stride. The
play of the Freshmen and Second Var
sity also reached high water mark
Saturday.
Though the play of the Olympics
and Berkeley was ragged at times,
and the Stanford ruggers rollicked
down the field for plentiful tallies,
the scoring machines were spiked of
ten enough by the visitors to provide
thrills.
Individual starring marked the
game of the clubmen. Miller, Cass,
Stolz, Partridge, and Comstock play
ed winning rugby for the losers.
By placing a penalty kick from the
thirty-five yard line soon after the
kick-off, Miller scored the Olympics
three lone points. The ball was soon
secured from a fifteen yard scrum,
passing to Austin for a try. Darsie's
conversion raised the score two
notches.
After a long dribbling rush from
center between Blase and Clover,
Darsie secured and went over for a
try. Darsie again converted. The pro
cess was repeated when Austin, Car
roll, Soper, and Hall made a pretty
passing run from center, allowing
Soper to go over. Darsie again found
goal.
The half ended soon after Card
picked the ball from a twenty yard
ruck and passed to Darsie for three
more p<rfnts.
At the beginning of the second
period Andrews cross kicked on the
Olympic forty-five yard line. Crary
received neatly and passed to Carroll,
who scored between the goal posts.
The second score was tallied when
the Stanford forwards dribbled over
and Franceschi dropped on the ball.
Darsie converted.
The last try was made when Hutt
man intercepted a kick at the fifty
yard line and passed to Andrews, who
passed to Ogden for a thirty yard
rush. The ball was dribbled over,
and Darsie covered it. Final score,
29-3.
Freshmen lMay Slmt-nut (Jame.
Nineteen Seventeen's exhibition
against Berkeley high school was
tight, and fast, after the first ten min
utes, and play rarely crowded Stan
ford territory. Freshmen who figured
primarily in the scoring were: Town
send, Sisson, Eyer, Patterson, Hor
ner, West, Hammon, McGilvrav.

pic lineups:
