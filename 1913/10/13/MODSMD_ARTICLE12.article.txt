Hail, All Blacks. You are thrice
welcome. As friends, as opponents,
and as representatives of a great is
land comonwealth, the Stanford Stud
ent Body extends its hospitality to
you during your visit on the campus.

In past years we have greeted
other teams from across the
Pacific, but your coming is of

greater significance than the invasion
of any previous fifteen. Your visit is
of international import. Rugby is on
a higher plane than ever before. We
are better prepared to match skill in
the game which is to you what base
ball is to us.
We trust that your visit on the Stan
ford campus will do much toward ce
menting the already cordial relations
which we have with your own coun
try.
May such pleasant recollections be
crowded into the nine days you are
here that your stay in Stanford will be
marked down in cardinal letters in
your remembrance of the visit to
America.
