## Theme Is That Manâ€™s Every Act Affects His Life and Follows Him. 
### 
A strong sermon, full of inspiration
and great appeal, was built up by
Bishop Hughes around the text "And
their works follow with them" in the
Memorial Church yesterday.
The address covered a wide field,
touching on immortality and dwelling
upon the reflex action of every human
deed. Bishop Hughes applied the law
of Physics, stating that, "for every ac
tion there is an equal and opposite
reaction" to the human life. Strad
ivarius was taken as an instance of
the sublime in devotion to one's work,
while Kipling was drawn upon for a
quotation from "The Seven Seas,"
wherein was illustrated the true
Heaven.
'1 he idea of the idle Heaven was
scouted and a condition of whole
hearted work substituted. "Of
course,' said Bishop Hughes, "there
being no contentions in Heaven the
lawyers would have no employment
and the physicians could not perform
their duties, but there would be plen
ty of work for all."
