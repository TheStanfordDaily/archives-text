# PICKING A WINNER IN BASEBALL IS HAZARDOUS
## ARTHUR SHAFER, EX-’14, WRITES WORLD’S SERIES ”DOPE” Story Penned by Former stanford Man for ”The Daily Polo Alto” Follows. 
### 
The difficulty of picking a winner iu
baseball, the most uncertain gamo
of all, is well illustrated from the
following "dope" written for "The
Daily Palo Alto" by Arthur Sliafer,
ex-'M, member of the New York
Giants.
The accompanying story was penn
ed last Tuesday morning, the day of
the first game of the World's Series.
"Your telegram just came today at
noon at the Polo Grounds. Will comply
gladly with your wishes. By the time
this reaches yon my dope may lie
wrong—however as things appear to
me and to all our players at this writ
ing—1 shall elucidate.
"New York has never had a better
chance for a World's Series. We
have four corking good pitchers, who
! think will be rated this way in re
gards to their turn in the bog. Math
ewson, Marquard, Tesreau, and Dema
ree. I have a "hunch" that Marquard
will open the series with Matty fol
lowing, and if we win both games
then Tesreau. If we win and lose
Tesreau; if we lose both then Mar
qnard and Matty back again.
"According to batting figures they
have us backed off the boards, but In
this series they don't amount to com
parative values. We have a wonder
ful club to fight in New York. They
have a scrappier lot, a team that gen
erally plays its best in pinches. In
this series the Athletics will go up
against a different kind, and a forty
per cent, better club than they defeat
ed in 1911.
"Doyle was hurt by crashing into a
tree going thirty miles an hour on
Fordham Road. A fog caused him to
lose the road and he made a bad turn
into the woods. His right arm is
very badly bruised, but lie will play
second in series. Snodgrass pulled
"charley horse," and I fear that he
will lie out of the series, which means
that Herzog at third and myself in
center field. 1 was doped to play
third and hate to give up my position
as there is more to do in the infield,
and I like it better for that reason.
All our players are very confident
and not worried, while I have heard
that the Athletics are very nervous.
Bender will pitch one good game and
maybe another, while Plank is figured
for one. Then they will have to use
Shawkey, Brown, Houck and Bush.
New York has a big edge in the
pitching line and has faster men on
liases.
"It's hard to try to dope the series,
for one can't figure on past perform
ances much. Baseball is so tickle —
a poor batter may be the star. Cobb
has never shone in a World's Series,
and he is the greatest player of them
all. Baker's home runs in 1911 were
luck, and the chances are 100 to 1 that
he will never repeat. Any way you
look at these games its an even bet.
Big baseball authorities in the East
have broken about 50-50 in stating
their views as to the best team. So
let's just sit tight, hold our breath in
the pinches and wait.
"Best regards to all the boys, and
I hope to visit you during the Big
Game."

very badly bruised, but lie will play
second in series. Snodgrass pulled
"charley horse," and I fear that he
will lie out of the series, which means
that Herzog at third and myself in
center field. 1 was doped to play
third and hate to give up my position
as there is more to do in the infield,
and I like it better for that reason.
All our players are very confident
and not worried, while I have heard
that the Athletics are very nervous.
Bender will pitch one good game and
maybe another, while Plank is figured
for one. Then they will have to use
Shawkey, Brown, Houck and Bush.
New York has a big edge in the
pitching line and has faster men on
liases.
"It's hard to try to dope the series,
for one can't figure on past perform
ances much. Baseball is so tickle —
a poor batter may be the star. Cobb
has never shone in a World's Series,
and he is the greatest player of them
all. Baker's home runs in 1911 were
luck, and the chances are 100 to 1 that
he will never repeat. Any way you
look at these games its an even bet.
Big baseball authorities in the East
have broken about 50-50 in stating
their views as to the best team. So
let's just sit tight, hold our breath in
the pinches and wait.
"Best regards to all the boys, and
I hope to visit you during the Big
Game."
The difficulty of picking a winner iu
baseball, the most uncertain gamo
of all, is well illustrated from the
following "dope" written for "The
Daily Palo Alto" by Arthur Sliafer,
ex-'M, member of the New York
Giants.
The accompanying story was penn
ed last Tuesday morning, the day of
the first game of the World's Series.
"Your telegram just came today at
noon at the Polo Grounds. Will comply
gladly with your wishes. By the time
this reaches yon my dope may lie
wrong—however as things appear to
me and to all our players at this writ
ing—1 shall elucidate.
"New York has never had a better
chance for a World's Series. We
have four corking good pitchers, who
! think will be rated this way in re
gards to their turn in the bog. Math
ewson, Marquard, Tesreau, and Dema
ree. I have a "hunch" that Marquard
will open the series with Matty fol
lowing, and if we win both games
then Tesreau. If we win and lose
Tesreau; if we lose both then Mar
qnard and Matty back again.
"According to batting figures they
have us backed off the boards, but In
this series they don't amount to com
parative values. We have a wonder
ful club to fight in New York. They
have a scrappier lot, a team that gen
erally plays its best in pinches. In
this series the Athletics will go up
against a different kind, and a forty
per cent, better club than they defeat
ed in 1911.
"Doyle was hurt by crashing into a
tree going thirty miles an hour on
Fordham Road. A fog caused him to
lose the road and he made a bad turn
into the woods. His right arm is
very badly bruised, but lie will play
