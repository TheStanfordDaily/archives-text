# TWO BITS WILL ADMIT TO INTERNATIONAL GAMES
## 
### 
Admission to the International rugby
games between Stanford Varsity and
the New Zealand team will be twenty
five cents for all who hold associated
student body tickets, instead of fifty
cents, as was originally planned. This
means that each student may see the
two games for fifty cents if he holds
a season ticket. Admission price for
all others will be fifty cents for each
game. The money which is received
from the members of the associated
student body will go toward defraying
the expenses for the entertainment of
the visiting All Blacks.
