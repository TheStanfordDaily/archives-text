For the first time in the history of
the university a fund has been estab
lished to lie known as the William
Burton Barber fund to help needy
students through their college course.
The Trustees of the university have
accepted a gift of $:!00 to establish
such a fund to provide loans for needy
and worthy students. A committee of
the Faculty consisting of Professor E.
P. Cubberly, chairman, Professor .T.
O. Griffin, Acting Registrar J. E. Mc-
Dowell and the student advisor, ex
officio were recently appointed by the
Trustees to draw up the rules under
which the loan shall be made.
The following rules have been
adopted by the committee to govern
the making of loans:
In the making of loans no distinc
tion shall be made between men and
women.
Owing to the small sum available,
loans shall be confined for the pres
ent to the members of the Senior
class.
Not more than $100 shall be loaned
to any one student.
Loans shall be made on written ap
plication and after approval by the
committee and the President of the
University on the personal note of the
student, made payable to the Univers
ity not later than one year after the
date of graduation or withdrawal from
the university.
Applicants for loans must have
been registered in the university for
at least one year prior to the time of
application.
Tt will be the purpose of the uni
versity, in selecting those to whom
loans may be made, to emphasize
character, scholarship, and intellect
ual promise, as well as personal need.
Applications should be made by per
sonal letter to the Academic Secre
tary, who will refer them to the com
mittee.
