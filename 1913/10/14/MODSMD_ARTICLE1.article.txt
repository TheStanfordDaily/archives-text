# NINETEEN FRESHMEN ARE TO BE AWARDED FOOTBALL SWEATERS
## 
### 
Nineteen football sweaters and
numerals have been awarded to the
members of the Freshmen rugby
squad whose playing throughout tha
season has shown the highest merit.
Though the regulation number of
sweaters to be given is eighteen,
Coach Brown found it impossible to
choose between two members of the
squad. The formal granting of the
sweaters will be made by the Execu
tive Committee.
A number of the men who have
played regularly on the Freshman
team during the latter part of the sea
son will be disappointed at their fail
ure to appear on the list of fortun
ates. The apparent slight was una
voidable. Six of the Freshmen, Pet
tingill, Austin, Carroll, Crary, David
son, and Lachmund, who have been
placed on the Varsity squad, have not
been on the Freshman team regular
ly, but are entitled to sweaters and
so must displace those who have sub
stituted for them on (he 1917 lineup.
The thirteen remaining awards pos
sible were too few to go around.
Following are the Freshmen who
have qualified: Scovel, Smitlierum,
front rank; McNulty, Halsted, Pe,-
tingill (Hammon), middle rank; Nu
gel. Swigart (Harris), rear rank;
Scott, wing forward; Townsend, half;
Austin, Carroll (Dickey), live eighths;
Lachmund (Huttman), center; Crary,
Mayberrv, wings; Davidson, full.
