Each semester as the time for Final
examinations draws near the campus
is beseiged by numerous trallic agents
who come authorized to offer cut rata
prices to those who will travel b}
particular route. Practically every
mode of travel, either by rail or boa:,
is cheaper at this time. But between
seasons whatever saving may have ac
crued by reason of the excursion
rates is counterbalanced by the high
rates on the peninsula. Complaint
lias been filed against one of tiiese
common carriers, those who com
mute daily to the campus have been
deprived of the benefits of the date
formerly given to the purchasers ol
the students' commutation book. The
railways place the blame on the Cal
ifornia Railroad Commission, which
has requested the abolition of the
commutation rate because it is a dis
crimination in favor of one class of
travelers. This may he true. But
the student should be allowed a reas
onable discount for his regular daily
trips. The most expedient means of
reaching both the railroads and the
commissioners is by petitions and
complaints. Concentrated action on
the part of the commuters may pro
duce the desired result.
