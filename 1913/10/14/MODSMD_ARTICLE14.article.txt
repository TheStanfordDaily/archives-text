Editor "Daily Palo Alto:''
Oil May 1st, lid.'5, the Southern Pa
cific company, upon the request of
the California Railroad Commission,
abolished the students' commutation
rate from points on the peninsula to
the university.
One of tlie articles of the Public
I't'lities act provides that the rail
roads shall not make rules of traffic
which have for effect discrimination
between persons.
The commission abolished this rate
on the grounds that it was a dis
crimination as between persons—that
is a person travelling as a student to
Palo Alto should not be allowed pref
erence over a person going there on
a different mission.
Why did the legislature incorporate
this provision in the Public Utilities
act? Simply because through a period
of a good many years the railroads
were discriminating in favor of par
ticular persons and particular classes
of persons for some unlawful gain,
in money or in influence. This dis
crimination was detrimental to the
trade, legislation, and public welfare
of the state. In brief, it was forbid
den by the legislature for the purpose
of eradicating a wrong.
Now can it lie said to be a wrong,
in any respect whatsoever, to discrim
inate in favor of a student? Can it
lie presumed that the state legisla
ture intended that such a. law should
reach the case in question?
It is obvious that it is the para
mount duty of a state to provide all
the facilities within its power to fur
ther the education of its citizens. This
state goes so far in some cases as to
make it compulsory upon negligent
or unwilling parents to send their
children to public schools. Further
more it makes large appropriations
to the state university for the purpose
of facilitating the education of its
future citizens. The educatfon of the
individual is not merely a question of
private benefit but in ils larger scope
it is of great public importance.
Why then should the state defeat
its own cause, by making it more dif
ficult to secure an education, the
state being the ultimate beneficiary"
Many people have made their res
idence on the peninsula because of
its educational facilities and because
they must be within easy reach of
San Francisco where their business
calls them. At present the only way
they can exercise these privileges is
by paying an exhorbitant rate to the
Southern Pacific which is sanctioned
by the state.
While Stanford University gener
ously offers us all opportunities i'i
furtherance of our education, the pow
ers that be in Sacramento uncon
sciously join hands with the railroad
to curtail our facilities of obtaining
it. A Commuter.

Editor "Daily Palo Alto:''
Oil May 1st, lid.'5, the Southern Pa
cific company, upon the request of
the California Railroad Commission,
abolished the students' commutation
rate from points on the peninsula to
the university.
One of tlie articles of the Public
I't'lities act provides that the rail
roads shall not make rules of traffic
which have for effect discrimination
between persons.
The commission abolished this rate
on the grounds that it was a dis
crimination as between persons—that
is a person travelling as a student to
Palo Alto should not be allowed pref
erence over a person going there on
a different mission.
Why did the legislature incorporate
this provision in the Public Utilities
act? Simply because through a period
of a good many years the railroads
were discriminating in favor of par
ticular persons and particular classes
of persons for some unlawful gain,
in money or in influence. This dis
crimination was detrimental to the
trade, legislation, and public welfare
of the state. In brief, it was forbid
den by the legislature for the purpose
of eradicating a wrong.
Now can it lie said to be a wrong,
in any respect whatsoever, to discrim
inate in favor of a student? Can it
lie presumed that the state legisla
ture intended that such a. law should
reach the case in question?
