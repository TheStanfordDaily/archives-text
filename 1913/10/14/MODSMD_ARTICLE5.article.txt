# VISITORS AND VARSITY NOW AWAIT INTERNATIONAL MATCH
## 
### 
Stanford Cardinal-New Zealand All Blacks. That will be the color com
bination tomorrow afternoon at 4 o'clock on the turf, when the referee's
whistle sends the Varsity and trans-Pacific fifteens into the first contest of
the international series.
Manager George Mason will rest a number of his men who have been
played in the three preliminary games around the bay, substituting fresh
players for them. His fighting machine should be as effective as the lineups
used in the earlier games that have been played on California soil.
The All Blacks are bringing for the contests with Stanford a collection
of rugby experts whose powerful team work and individual brilliance has
so far proved invincible. In three games played to date with the Olympic
Club, University of California, and Barbarian Club, the visitors have swamped
their opponents under heavy scores. The combined effort of the bay teams
has amounted to zero.
As masters of the English sport, the Silver Fern ruggers from the
Pacific Islands have proved their worth. The brand of football served up
in their exhibitions has so far eclipsed any rugby play that has been seen
in the United States since its introduction in 190(5.
To meet tomorrow's onslaught, Coach Floyd Brown has prepared the best
lineup that can be chosen from the Cardinal squad after five weeks' prac
tice. The personnel of the team has developed high mark speed, close team
work, and a lot of rugby. Stanford's Varsity lineup as it stands on paper,
is one of the most formidable playing combinations that has been brought
into condition.
The absence of Captain .Jimmy Thoburn from the line of play is the one
serious absence from the team.
On the Varsity's front rank division will be Soper, Peck, and Hall.
Clover and Dubendorf will occupy the middle rank, and Card, Blase and
Darsie will go in at breakaway. The back fie Id positions will be filled by the
men who turned their speed and accuracy against the "Winged O" last
Saturday. Tilton will play at half back, Reeves and Crary on the wings,
Austin and Lachmund five eighths, Carroll center, and Davidson on the line
of last defense.
Season tickets and twenty-five cents will admit at the gate. The general
admission price will be fifty cents.
The All Black lineup follows; â€”Sellers, Williams, Bruce, Wyllie, Down
ing, Dewar, Cain, forwards; McDonald (Captain), wing forward; Taylor,
half; Gray, McKenzie, five eighths; McGregor, Lynch, wings; R. Roberts,
center; Cuthill, full. Substitutes: Loveridge, Graham. Bush.
