# TEAM CHOSEN FOR PORTOLA MEET
## 
### 
Representing the pick of the Stan
ford track athletes out for fall train
ing, "Dad" Moulton and Captain P.
B. McKee, '14, have selected twenty
four men to wear the Cardinal in the
Portola meet. Stanford will be rep
resented in every event with the ex
ception of the shot put. This is the
strongest aggregation of athletes
which have ever run under the Stan
ford colors in a fall track meet.
The Portola meet will be held in
the Golden Gate stadium in San Fran
cisco on October 25. With the large
list of entries from all parts of the
Pacific Coast it is probable that the
heats in the shorter distance and
trials in the field events will be sched
uled for the morning, while the finals
will be run off in the afternoon. With
out doubt this meet is the largest one
ever held west of Chicago.
The athletes selected form only a
provisional list. If any of the men
who have not been chosen show up
to good advantage thus far, do well
in the final workout on Friday or be
tween now and October 25 they weill
be entered immediately. The present
list of entries has been picked from
the result of the previous tryouts this
season.
Twelve Varsity "S" men are includ
ed in the team which has been se
lected. Seven competed in the big
meet against California last April,
and four of the entries are Freshmen.
