## 
### 
Spreading the doctrine of universal
peace, Chancellor David Starr Jordan
lias now turned his attention to the
Balkans and is investigating the reas
ons for the continual unrest there.
In a letter dated at Wessen, 011 Walen
Luke, Switzerland, the Chancellor
writes 1111 account to the editor of
"The Daily Palo Alto" and makes
note of political conditions in Alsace-
Lorraine and Bulgaria. Chancellor
Jordan's letter follows:
"1 am told that the clans have gath
ered and that everything is humming
as usual on the old farm. Lest 1 be
forgotten I hasten to make my month
ly report on what I am doing in Eu
rope.
"1 attended the 'Universal L>eace
Congress' at the Hague with the ex
pected degree of edification. After
that 1 made, in company with Pro
lessor Uuerard, a tour through Lor
raine and Alsace, interviewing all the
leading people and some others 011
the past and future of that much dis
puted region. Our conclusion, in
brief, is the future of Alsace-Lorraine
lies with the empire of Germany, but
that the question will remain a burn
ing one in international politics until
Germany ceases to hold Alsace-Lor
raine as conquered territory and
gives to her people home rule and the
rights of the other states in the Em
pire. Her position in Germany now
is about the same as that of Porto
Rico within the United States, and Al
sace-Lorraine is one of the richest,
most productive and progressive reg
ions in Europe.
"We have next an attack 011 the
Balkan problem, hampered by failing
trains, cholera quarantines, and the
utter collapse of order in Bulgaria.
".Just now we are moving slowly—
that is, not moving at all—and for the
present, at least, it seems unwise to
go further than Servia and Monte
negro, and of this I must tell you, if
at all, in my next."
