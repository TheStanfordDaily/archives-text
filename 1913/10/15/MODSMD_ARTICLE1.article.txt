# All-Blacks Roll Up Fifty-Four Points Varsity Fights Big Odds to Last Gun
## 
### 
Fast, clever, and thoroughly exper
ienced, the wearers of the black from
overseas overcame the gallant but
futile defense of the gray-jerseyed
Stanford men on the turf this after
noon. 54-0 tells the story of the game
in the imperfect manner in which fig
ures must tell the tale of the fight
of thorough sportsmen against the
best of all the players who have been
born and bred in the rugby game. The
Stanford men are playing against a
team the equal of which for speed and
natural ability, splendid following of
the ball, and brilliant offensive tac
tics, has not been seen on the Stan
ford turf. At that the play of the
New Zealaiulers, though of a high
order, was not the tightest of which
they are capable.
With every Stanford man fighting
to the last gun, the fact that Austin,
Carroll, Gard and Darsie were par
ticularly noticeable for individual
playing casts no discredit upon the
other members of the team.
Members of the California Var
sity squad were interested spectators
at the match. The California party
included Mclvim, Abrams, Douglas,
Smith, Russell, Saunders, Fish, Brant,
King, Canfield, Hunt, Hazeltine, Peart,
Lane, coaches Schafer and Cerf, and
Trainer Voltz.
The Stanford band added its usual
contribution to the spirit of the after
noon. The Stanford rooters worked
out under the direction of the newly
appointed yell leaders.
An appreciative crowd of 2500 peo
ple was in evidence in the bleachers.
