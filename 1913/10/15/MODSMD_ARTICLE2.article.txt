# NEW ZEALAND MANAGER TELLS OF RECEPTION
## GEORGE H. MASON WRITES ON IMPRESSIONS. Welcome Accorded "All Blacks" In San Francisco, Berkeley and Stanford Pleases Whole Team. 
### 
An English tourist, visiting Aus
tralia, decided to include in his tour
a trip to New Zealand, and took a
round trip ticket from Sidney via New
Zealand ports. En route he visited
Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch,
Dunedin, and Invercargill, his stay in
each place averaging about twenty
four hours. On his return to England
he wrote and published a "Descriptive
History of New Zealand." I am re
minded of this story by my promise to
write for "The Daily Palo Alto" some
of the impressions gathered by us
during our two weeks sojourn in Sun
ny California. Our first impression
on reaching Folsom Street Wharf two
weeks ago tomorrow was that, if the
demonstrative welcome accorded us
there meant anything at all, it meant
that we were in for a really good time
and this has already been thoroughly
borne out by results. That excite
ment over, we had a chance to look
around us, and we marvelled-at the
fine city, which, in the course of seven
short years, had grown out of the
ruins of the devastating earthquakes
and fire of the year of 1906.
Your glorious climate has impress
ed us most favorably, especially as
when we left home the weather was
cold and wet, for July and August are
about our coldest and wettest months
in the whole year.
To those of us who had never been
beyond the doors of New Zealand, the
life and bustle of a great city was a
source of infinite wonder and excite
ment, and the brilliant illumination
of the streets and buildings came to
us as a great surprise and is still a
matter of considerable interest to us.
Then, coming from a country where
all hotels are closed and the buildings
are in darkness at 10 p.m. and Sunday
is a day of almost complete rest, the
late hours at which all amusements
are carried on here and the barter
ing and selling which is going on
and the many games that are played
on Sundays has heen a source of great
astonishment, and we are confronted
with a prize puzzle in endeavoring to
figure out when the good people of
San Francisco sleep.
Our visit to Berkeley, as the guests
of the University of California, was
a most pleasant one, the picturesque
campus being greatly admired and
the students at the several fraternity
houses at which we were quartered
vied with each other in attending to
our slightest desires. The hospitality
and kindness shown us, both by the
general body of students and the
members of the faculties, will not lie
Torgotten.
We have all been eagerly looking
forward to our stay at Palo Alto, and
our anticipations of an enjoyable
time at Stanford have already been
more than realized. The site chosen
for the university could not have been
bettered, and we are all struck with
the delightful campus, the glorious
green lawns, and the beautiful trees.
Our delightful surroundings have im
pressed us greatly, and have brought
us nearer home than anything that
we have seen since leaving the shores
of New Zealand. And may I add that
the fresh complexions and graceful
carriage of tlie fair lady undergradu
ates of Stanford go far to enhance the
natural beauties of this attractive and
beautiful spot.
The kindness and attention bestow
ed upon us by each and everyone has
been remarkable, and in attempting to
record our high appreciation of it I
am voicing the sentiments of every
member of my team.
I am sure that, when we return
home, tlie story of our delightful ex
periences and the hospitality accord
ed us. will still further cement the
good feeling which exists between the
United States and the distant and
slightly known Dominion of New Zea
land.

The kindness and attention bestow
ed upon us by each and everyone has
been remarkable, and in attempting to
record our high appreciation of it I
am voicing the sentiments of every
member of my team.
I am sure that, when we return
home, tlie story of our delightful ex
periences and the hospitality accord
ed us. will still further cement the
good feeling which exists between the
United States and the distant and
slightly known Dominion of New Zea
land.
An English tourist, visiting Aus
tralia, decided to include in his tour
a trip to New Zealand, and took a
round trip ticket from Sidney via New
Zealand ports. En route he visited
Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch,
Dunedin, and Invercargill, his stay in
each place averaging about twenty
four hours. On his return to England
he wrote and published a "Descriptive
History of New Zealand." I am re
minded of this story by my promise to
write for "The Daily Palo Alto" some
of the impressions gathered by us
during our two weeks sojourn in Sun
ny California. Our first impression
on reaching Folsom Street Wharf two
weeks ago tomorrow was that, if the
demonstrative welcome accorded us
there meant anything at all, it meant
that we were in for a really good time
and this has already been thoroughly
borne out by results. That excite
ment over, we had a chance to look
around us, and we marvelled-at the
fine city, which, in the course of seven
short years, had grown out of the
ruins of the devastating earthquakes
and fire of the year of 1906.
Your glorious climate has impress
ed us most favorably, especially as
when we left home the weather was
cold and wet, for July and August are
about our coldest and wettest months
in the whole year.
To those of us who had never been
beyond the doors of New Zealand, the
life and bustle of a great city was a
source of infinite wonder and excite
ment, and the brilliant illumination
of the streets and buildings came to
us as a great surprise and is still a
matter of considerable interest to us.
Then, coming from a country where
all hotels are closed and the buildings
are in darkness at 10 p.m. and Sunday
is a day of almost complete rest, the
late hours at which all amusements
are carried on here and the barter
ing and selling which is going on
and the many games that are played
on Sundays has heen a source of great
astonishment, and we are confronted
with a prize puzzle in endeavoring to
figure out when the good people of
San Francisco sleep.
Our visit to Berkeley, as the guests
of the University of California, was
a most pleasant one, the picturesque
campus being greatly admired and
the students at the several fraternity
houses at which we were quartered
vied with each other in attending to
our slightest desires. The hospitality
and kindness shown us, both by the
general body of students and the
members of the faculties, will not lie
Torgotten.
We have all been eagerly looking
forward to our stay at Palo Alto, and
our anticipations of an enjoyable
time at Stanford have already been
more than realized. The site chosen
for the university could not have been
bettered, and we are all struck with
the delightful campus, the glorious
green lawns, and the beautiful trees.
Our delightful surroundings have im
pressed us greatly, and have brought
us nearer home than anything that
we have seen since leaving the shores
of New Zealand. And may I add that
the fresh complexions and graceful
carriage of tlie fair lady undergradu
ates of Stanford go far to enhance the
natural beauties of this attractive and
beautiful spot.
