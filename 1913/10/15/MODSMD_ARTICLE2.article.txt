# NEW ZEALAND MANAGER TELLS OF RECEPTION
## GEORGE H. MASON WRITES ON IMPRESSIONS. Welcome Accorded "All Blacks" In San Francisco, Berkeley and Stanford Pleases Whole Team. 
### 
An English tourist, visiting Aus
tralia, decided to include in his tour
a trip to New Zealand, and took a
round trip ticket from Sidney via New
Zealand ports. En route he visited
Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch,
Dunedin, and Invercargill, his stay in
each place averaging about twenty
four hours. On his return to England
he wrote and published a "Descriptive
History of New Zealand." I am re
minded of this story by my promise to
write for "The Daily Palo Alto" some
of the impressions gathered by us
during our two weeks sojourn in Sun
ny California. Our first impression
on reaching Folsom Street Wharf two
weeks ago tomorrow was that, if the
demonstrative welcome accorded us
there meant anything at all, it meant
that we were in for a really good time
and this has already been thoroughly
borne out by results. That excite
ment over, we had a chance to look
around us, and we marvelled-at the
fine city, which, in the course of seven
short years, had grown out of the
ruins of the devastating earthquakes
and fire of the year of 1906.
Your glorious climate has impress
ed us most favorably, especially as
when we left home the weather was
cold and wet, for July and August are
about our coldest and wettest months
in the whole year.
To those of us who had never been
beyond the doors of New Zealand, the
life and bustle of a great city was a
source of infinite wonder and excite
ment, and the brilliant illumination
of the streets and buildings came to
us as a great surprise and is still a
matter of considerable interest to us.
