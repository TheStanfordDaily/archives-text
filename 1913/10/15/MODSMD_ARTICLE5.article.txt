Good cheer and fellowship marked
the gathering of New Zealanders and
Stanford men around the bonfire last
night. Under the auspices of Skull
and Snakes, an informal Jolly-up wa.s
tendered Stanford's guests on the
track field.
The New Zealanders were escorted
to the field by the Stanford Varsity
team and the members of the Mandolin
and Glee clubs. After a feast of ap
ples the Mandolin club gave several
popular selections. All joined in sing
ing the airs. The Glee club contrib
uted its share of lively songs. The
visitors enlivened the evening with
toasts to Stanford, followed by their
native cheers. A round of story tell
ing followed, and the jollification end
ed with cheers for both teams.
