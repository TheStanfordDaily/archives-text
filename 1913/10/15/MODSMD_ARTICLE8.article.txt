# Scalpers
## 
### 
As in the case of every other event
where the demand for seats exceeds
the supply, there is always a certain
undesirable element which attempts
to make a profit out of the scarcity of
desirable tickets. In the expectation

of a considerable gain over
the purchase price of the
tickets these speculators

hold their seats until fancy sums are
offered and then reap a harvest. Out
siders have already attempted to ob
tain a corner on blocks of tickets.
Students have never been accused of
this practice and never will. But as
a protection it is necessary to prevent,
"scalpers" from securing tickets. Care
should be taken that no tickets are
allowed to fall into the hands of per
sons who want them for monetary
gain.
