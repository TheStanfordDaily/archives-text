# MANAGER MASON WANTS "ALL STAR" GAME HERE
## SUGGESTS FINAL CONTEST BE PLAYED ON TURF Head of New Zealand Team Praises Stanford Field and Remarks On Game. 
### 
George H. Mason, the manager of
the New Zealand All Blacks, writes
in "The Daily Palo Alto" this evening
of his views of yesterday's glfime.
Mason also suggests that the final
contest between the Antipodeans and
the "All-Stars" be played on the Stan
ford turf. Mason's letter follows:
"For the first time since our ar
rival in California, the All Blacks had
a game yesterday under home condi
tions. And bow they simply revelled
in the green turf after puddling about
in the mud and dust for three
matches! Since our first experience
of the dirt field, two days after land
ing here, the consoling cry among
the boys has been 'Wait until we get
down to the grass field at Stanford.'
And the general verdict is that it was
well worth waiting for, not because
we were victorious by a large mar
sin of points, but that we were af
forded the opportunity of giving an
exhibition of the good old rugby game
as it is played in New Zealand, where
a mud field is never heard of in con
nection with football of any grade.
"And now we are counting up the
number of fixtures remaining which
will be played under similar pleasant
conditions as yesterday's game. One
more here, one on the Stadium in
San Francisco next Wednesday, and
one at Reno; then conies the del
uge.
"But why should not the game
against the 'All-Stars' be played here?
New Zealand versus California is
surely a game of sufficient import
ance to warrant it being played on
the best ground available. And what
about the possibility of a heavy fall
of rain, and the consequent repetition
of the conditions attached to the last
Intercollegiate match? I commend
the sugg'estion to the powers that be.
"With regard to yesterday's game.
1 desire to add my quota to the meed
of praise which has been bestowed,
and rightly, on the Stanford team
for the strenuous fight put up by
them against the overwhelming odds.
That is the true sporting spirit in the
best sense of the word, and the re-
Jention of that spirit must spell suc
cess in the near future. That the re
ward will come quickly is the earnest
wish of all of your present guests, ts
well as of the great army of well
wishers to Stanford resident in Amer
ica.
"In conclusion may I record the
appreciation of the members of our
team of the great compliment paid
us by the large body of students who
took part in the 'pee-rade' last night.
It was an unique experience to us,
and was greatly enjoyed."
