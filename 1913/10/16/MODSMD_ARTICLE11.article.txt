Why should not the game against
the "All-Stars" be played on the
Stanford turf? This is a question
asked in an article published today

from the pen of Mr.
(leorge 11. Mason, man
ager of the visiting

"All Blacks." The possibility of rain,
which may mar the match, as the In
tercollegiate game was interfered
with last fall; the unfamiliarity of
the New Zealanders with dirt fields,
and the opportunity which the tuil
offers for a better brand of rugby,
are among the reasons in favor of
playing the championship match here.
Approximately twenty-five hundred
people attended the match yesterday
afternoon —a week day. two thous
and students and faculty membois
may be counted upon to be present
on the coming Saturday. Fifteen
hundred more will come from the
nearby Peninsula territory. lhiity
five hundred spectators then will wit
ness the game between the Cardinal
Varsity and the visitors.
Six thousand people at a dollar will
be sufficient crowd to draw the nec
essary sum into the coffers of the
Rugby Union for defraying the ex
penses in arranging the tour. With
a representative team, having on its
roster the pick of the players in the
game, it seems certain that a suffi
ciently large crowd will be encour
aged to make the journey to the Stan
ford campus to meet the financial
exigency. The suggestion deserves
consideration at the hands of the Cal
ifornia Rugby Union authorities.
