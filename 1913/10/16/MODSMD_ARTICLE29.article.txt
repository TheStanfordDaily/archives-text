# CHAPPIE'S HAMMER WILL COME OUT OF SECLUSION
## Emblem of Comic Editor's Power Will Announce Issuance of Much-Read Campus Magazine. 
### 
Chaparral's hammer will be placed
in the Bookstore window Monday.
This is because Chappie conies out
Tuesday, and because in former years
the symbolic piece of metal was al
ways placed on display on the day
before the issuance of the comic. For
the past six years this ancient cus
tom lias not been carried out. Editor
L. D. Summerfleld, '12, intends to give
the campus a chance to see the ham
mer. Many students are of the opin
ion that it is but a symbolic affair,
while as a matter of fact it is a
chunky piece of sledge-shaped silver
plated steel on the end of a hard piece
of hickory. It is the emblem of Chap
pie's authorized privilege of knock
ing.
On silver bands around the nandle
are engraved the names of the Ham
mer and Coffin society. Each year a
new band is added, containing the
names of the staff. There are but
nine rings, as the working humorists
of the first few years of Chappie's ex
istence were so few in number that
their names were put on one ring.
In the future the hammer will be
placed in the Bookstore window on
the day before the issuance of the
current Chaparral.
