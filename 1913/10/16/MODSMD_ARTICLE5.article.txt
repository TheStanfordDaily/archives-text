# ALL-BLACKS WORLD'S BEST RUGGERS
## 
### (By D.J. Guiney, New Zealand Press Representative 
When a team in New Zealand is
beaten by a large total of points we
usually regard a criticism of the game
as useless, the score itself being suffi
cient criterion of the play. The win
ning team occupies all the limelight,
and tbe losers get nothing, except,
perhaps, casual reference. In the
match on Wednesday, however, be
tween the All Blacks and Stanford it
was the case of a past master in the
art against a beginner, and 1 guess
that you want to know more about
what 1 think of the Stanford team and
their play than anything else.
Well, it is a rather hard proposi
tion. Your fellows did not get enough
opportunities to make any play that
would give one a thorough grasp of
their capabilities. The Hlacks con
trolled the ball practically the whole
of the game, consequently the Stan
ford men did not figure at all prom
inently in the picture. I can only
draw conclusions from very limited
data. The first thing that struck me
was that the Stanford footballers have
had their feet set in the right track.
They are learning the game in the
right way. They were hopelessly out
classed from the start, but it was a
fine thing to see them endeavor to
make play on their own account
whenever they got control of the ball.
They aimed at. keeping the ball in

play, and at making the game as open
as possible. A team that does this
lias been well taught in the first prin
ciples of first-class rugby, and this
is the style of play that you see per
fected in the New Zealand game. Per
severance in such tactics will lead
to improvement in Stanford football,
success is just a matter of time. The
fielding and kicking of your men is
good, and I have no doubt that. given
more opportunities than they were
allowed to receive on Wednesday, they
would show that they have a well or
ganized system of attack. 1 could not
help noticing that on one or two occa
sions some of the backs got into rath
er awkward positions, from which
they extricated themselves in' fine
style. They were not at a loss what
to do on the spur of the moment, -v
most necessary attribute to a good
footballer. A football team should be
like a well oiled piece of machinery,
but it is also necessary that each
piece of the combination should be
capable of playing a lone hand when
called upon to do so. In rugby foot
ball a man is continually being called
upon to act and think instantaneous
ly. Hesitation brings disaster, an.l
your men can do that.
Coaching is sometimes apt to make
a man rely too much on others, but
the Stanford coaching has not had
tlie effect of destroying the players'
self reliance. It is really not possible
to express a definite opinion of the
team as a whole, their chances were
so limited. I am pretty sure, how
ever, that if they are given any lati
tude they will make it very warm for
their opponents.
Comparisons are already being
made between Stanford and Berkeley,
something after this style: The All
Blacks beat California by thirty points
and Stanford by fifty points, therefore
California should be able to beat
Stanford by about twenty points. The
people who are taking a line through
the play of the New Zealanders
against the two universities with the
idea of arriving at the strength of
the teams are away off the track.
The play of the New Zealanders on
Wednesday was infinitely better than
against California, in fact it could
hardly find room for improvement ex
cept in minor details. Stanford was
up against the best team in the world
playing at the top of their form for
the first time on the tour, and any
conclusions drawn from the result
relative to the game on November S
will be all wrong.
The New Zealanders join with me
in saying that we could not wish to
meet with truer sportsmen than the
dwellers on the Stanford campus, and
the men that ran up that big score
are unanimous in their opinion that
it was one of the most pleasant games
they had ever played in as regards
spirit of fair play. !t. was good to see
the way the Stanford men went down
fighting to the last, and it was even
more splendid to witness the spirit
shown at the rally in the evening.
There is nothing wrong with a crowd
who can cheer and back up with their
moral support a defeated team as
you boys did on Wednesday evening.
It made us feel almost ashamed of
ourselves to be acknowledged victors
and can only say that the Stanford
spirit is something grand to comtem
plate.

and tbe losers get nothing, except,
perhaps, casual reference. In the
match on Wednesday, however, be
tween the All Blacks and Stanford it
was the case of a past master in the
art against a beginner, and 1 guess
that you want to know more about
what 1 think of the Stanford team and
their play than anything else.
Well, it is a rather hard proposi
tion. Your fellows did not get enough
opportunities to make any play that
would give one a thorough grasp of
their capabilities. The Hlacks con
trolled the ball practically the whole
of the game, consequently the Stan
ford men did not figure at all prom
inently in the picture. I can only
draw conclusions from very limited
data. The first thing that struck me
was that the Stanford footballers have
had their feet set in the right track.
They are learning the game in the
right way. They were hopelessly out
classed from the start, but it was a
fine thing to see them endeavor to
make play on their own account
whenever they got control of the ball.
They aimed at. keeping the ball in

play, and at making the game as open
as possible. A team that does this
lias been well taught in the first prin
ciples of first-class rugby, and this
is the style of play that you see per
fected in the New Zealand game. Per
severance in such tactics will lead
to improvement in Stanford football,
success is just a matter of time. The
fielding and kicking of your men is
good, and I have no doubt that. given
more opportunities than they were
allowed to receive on Wednesday, they
would show that they have a well or
ganized system of attack. 1 could not
help noticing that on one or two occa
sions some of the backs got into rath
er awkward positions, from which
they extricated themselves in' fine
style. They were not at a loss what
to do on the spur of the moment, -v
most necessary attribute to a good
footballer. A football team should be
like a well oiled piece of machinery,
but it is also necessary that each
piece of the combination should be
capable of playing a lone hand when
called upon to do so. In rugby foot
ball a man is continually being called
upon to act and think instantaneous
ly. Hesitation brings disaster, an.l
your men can do that.
Coaching is sometimes apt to make
a man rely too much on others, but
the Stanford coaching has not had
tlie effect of destroying the players'
self reliance. It is really not possible
to express a definite opinion of the
team as a whole, their chances were
so limited. I am pretty sure, how
ever, that if they are given any lati
tude they will make it very warm for
their opponents.
Comparisons are already being
made between Stanford and Berkeley,
something after this style: The All
Blacks beat California by thirty points
and Stanford by fifty points, therefore
California should be able to beat
Stanford by about twenty points. The
people who are taking a line through
the play of the New Zealanders
against the two universities with the
idea of arriving at the strength of
the teams are away off the track.
The play of the New Zealanders on
Wednesday was infinitely better than
against California, in fact it could
hardly find room for improvement ex
cept in minor details. Stanford was
up against the best team in the world
playing at the top of their form for
the first time on the tour, and any
conclusions drawn from the result
relative to the game on November S
will be all wrong.
The New Zealanders join with me
in saying that we could not wish to
meet with truer sportsmen than the
dwellers on the Stanford campus, and
the men that ran up that big score
are unanimous in their opinion that
it was one of the most pleasant games
they had ever played in as regards
spirit of fair play. !t. was good to see
the way the Stanford men went down
fighting to the last, and it was even
more splendid to witness the spirit
shown at the rally in the evening.
There is nothing wrong with a crowd
who can cheer and back up with their
moral support a defeated team as
you boys did on Wednesday evening.
It made us feel almost ashamed of
ourselves to be acknowledged victors
and can only say that the Stanford
spirit is something grand to comtem
plate.
When a team in New Zealand is
beaten by a large total of points we
usually regard a criticism of the game
as useless, the score itself being suffi
cient criterion of the play. The win
ning team occupies all the limelight,
and tbe losers get nothing, except,
perhaps, casual reference. In the
