# ALL-BLACKS WORLD'S BEST RUGGERS
## 
### (By D.J. Guiney, New Zealand Press Representative 
When a team in New Zealand is
beaten by a large total of points we
usually regard a criticism of the game
as useless, the score itself being suffi
cient criterion of the play. The win
ning team occupies all the limelight,
and tbe losers get nothing, except,
perhaps, casual reference. In the
match on Wednesday, however, be
tween the All Blacks and Stanford it
was the case of a past master in the
art against a beginner, and 1 guess
that you want to know more about
what 1 think of the Stanford team and
their play than anything else.
Well, it is a rather hard proposi
tion. Your fellows did not get enough
opportunities to make any play that
would give one a thorough grasp of
their capabilities. The Hlacks con
trolled the ball practically the whole
of the game, consequently the Stan
ford men did not figure at all prom
inently in the picture. I can only
draw conclusions from very limited
data. The first thing that struck me
was that the Stanford footballers have
had their feet set in the right track.
They are learning the game in the
right way. They were hopelessly out
classed from the start, but it was a
fine thing to see them endeavor to
make play on their own account
whenever they got control of the ball.
They aimed at. keeping the ball in

play, and at making the game as open
as possible. A team that does this
lias been well taught in the first prin
ciples of first-class rugby, and this
is the style of play that you see per
fected in the New Zealand game. Per
severance in such tactics will lead
to improvement in Stanford football,
success is just a matter of time. The
fielding and kicking of your men is
good, and I have no doubt that. given
more opportunities than they were
allowed to receive on Wednesday, they
would show that they have a well or
ganized system of attack. 1 could not
help noticing that on one or two occa
sions some of the backs got into rath
er awkward positions, from which
they extricated themselves in' fine
style. They were not at a loss what
to do on the spur of the moment, -v
most necessary attribute to a good
footballer. A football team should be
like a well oiled piece of machinery,
but it is also necessary that each
piece of the combination should be
capable of playing a lone hand when
called upon to do so. In rugby foot
ball a man is continually being called
upon to act and think instantaneous
ly. Hesitation brings disaster, an.l
your men can do that.
Coaching is sometimes apt to make
a man rely too much on others, but
