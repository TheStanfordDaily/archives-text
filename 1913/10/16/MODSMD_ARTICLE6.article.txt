# SAN FRANCISCO WANTED AS PLACE FOR DEBATES
## CALIFORNIA PROPOSES TO HOLD INTERCOLLEGIATE THERE Euphronia In Favor of Proposition; Nestoria Yet to be Heard From 
### 
Future Stanford-California debates
may be held in San Francisco if the
proposition submitted by the execu
tive committee of the University of
California to Stanford debaters is ap
proved. The subject has been put
before the Intersociety Debating
League and the Nestoria and Euphro
nia debating societies. The only act
ion which has been taken to date wag
by Euphronia, which declared in favor
of the change.
Until six years ago the debates were
always held in San Francisco, and
the argument advanced in favor of
the proposition by its proposers is
that at that time a large audience of
San Francisco people were in at
tendance to swell the college lists.
Moreover, each year's debate would
be conducted on neutral ground, in
stead of the debaters being compelled
to fact an entirely hostile audience
every other year. It is thought that
this year's subject, pertaining to im
migration, would especially attract
a large audience of the people of San
Francisco. If the change is made it
will affect the 1913 debate, which is
now scheduled to be held here on the
night before the big game.
