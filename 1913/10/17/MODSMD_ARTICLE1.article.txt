# STANFORD UNION AND WOMEN'S CLUB LAUNCHED
## NOT SUFFICIENT FUND TO FINISH STRUCTURE. $79,000 Lowest Bid for Entire Construction. Certain Features Will be Eliminated. 
### 
The Stanford Union was formally
launched at the recent meeting of the
building committee. The trustees of
the Union have officially accepted tl:
bids, and it only remains for the con
tractors to start breaking ground.
This action marks the final step in a
five years struggle to secure for Stan
ford a men's union building and wom
en's club house.
The completed plans provide for
two buildings joined by an arcade.
The lowest bid for the entire con
struction was $79,000. The funds
available for the men was $28,000.
Upon a demand by the committee for
a segregated bid upon each piece
of work a lowest bid of $37,000 was
made upon the men's building. As
this amount was still in excess of the
moneys on hand, it was decided to
cut down the cost by eliminating cer
tain features and postponing the com
pletion of a number of the sleeping
rooms and the arcade until more mon
ey could be obtained. New bids on
this basis were then called for. By
these measures it has been possible
to cut do # n the cost to $32,000.. Al
though over four thousand dollars
are needed to cover the cost of the
present limited plans, the trustees of
the Union have been empowered to
let the contracts for the above
amount, feeling that the needed finan
cial support will be forthcoming.
The site of the Union includes the
territory between the post office and
the engineering buildings on Lasuen.
The structures will be of reinforced
concrete, built on the mission style.
Charles F. Whittelsey, a San Fran
cisco architect, thoroughly familiar
with the mission type of buildings, is
responsible for the plans.
The women's building will be start
ed simultaneously with the men's
building. The women are not yet in
possession of sufficient funds to cov
er the cost of their club-house, and
will have to effect a loan. The men'.?
committee has been acting in behalf
of the women's club and will continue
in that capacity as far as possible.
The members of the committee are
H. C. Hoover, '9rÂ», Professor C. B.
Wing, Dr. Ray L. Wilbur, '96, A. E
Roth, '09, Frederick H. Fowler, *05.
chairman. Vice-President Professor
C. D. Marx and E. W. Smith, '99,
permanent secretary of the Union
have been acting in co-operation with
the committee.
