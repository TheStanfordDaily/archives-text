# Actions Rather Than Intention.

Five years ago the Stanford Union
project was launched. The idea be
hind the Union was the fostering of
that spirit of democracy whict has
been *o deeply ingrained in the hearts
of every man or woman who has come
within the borders of the Stanford
campus. What the Encina clubioom
is to the men of the llall so will the
Union lie to the men of the Univers
ity. Every element in Stanford life
will find the Union a common meet
ing ground, where each may become
acquainted with the other units which
make up the I niversity.
Four thousand dollars is needed to
complete the Union building as it is
planned by the specifications accepted
by the building committee. Upon the
assumption that Ibis money would be
available to pay the bills as they come
due, the building committee has taken
final action in the preliminary work,
and everything is in readiness tor
the breaking of the ground. Among
the undergraduates several thousand
dollars has been pledged but has nev
er been paid in. Immediately a cam
paign is to be begun to gather in this
money, and new subscriptions, es
pecially among the Freshmen, are to
be solicited. In the quintet of years
since the Union was suggested too
much lias been written and said about
the project and too little has been
done. Now is the time for action on
the part of the undergraduates.
