# ISLANDERS VS. CARDINAL IN FINAL GAME TOMORROW
## 
### 
Captain McDonald lnis revised the
All [Slack's lineup which will meet
tho Varsity tomorrow in the final
Stanford-New Zealand match, giving
.seven of the ruggers who figured in
Wednesday's victory a rest. The
chan. e in personnel will give the Car
dinal spectators an opportunity to see
all of the Island champions in action
except Teddy Roberts, the fast back,
who has not appeared in California
on account of a leg injury received be
fore sailing.
Four changes in the backfield will
present four new puzzles to the Stan
ford players.
Coach Floyd Brown of the Stanford
Varsity announces a lineup for tho
contest tomorrow which reveals eight
changes from last Wednesday's per
sonnel. Three new players will be
placed in the backiield. Several play
ers have been shifted from their usu
al positions.
Davidson and Patterson, of the lirst
year class, will replace their class
mates Austin and Lachmund, at the
Ave eighths positions. Andrews is
named for center, and Kauffman will
appear at full.
The forwards who will be tested to
morrow for the first time in the face
of the Islanders' onslaughts are Hall,
Watkins, Whitaker, Sands,trom and
Ogden.
Tilton will remain at half. Crary
and Urban will be seen again on the
wings. Forwards who will meet the
New Zealand team a second time are
Wines, Peck and Dubendorf.
Substitutes: Soper, Templeton,
Dickey, Jacomini. The game will com
mence at 3:30. Season tickets and
twenty-five cents will admit.
Loveridge will be played at half for
the first time tomorrow. His regular
berth is at wing, and his change to j
the position taken by Taylor last j
Wednesday may Lie considered an ex- i
periment.
The five eighths men are to be Gray j
and Mitchinson. Mitchinson demon
strated bis skill in the first game of |
the series. He has the faculty of !

dropping unexpected field goals when
ever he comes in range. Gray will
set foot on the Stanford turf tomor
row for tho first time. He is reck- j
oned by many to be the best fivo j
eighths with the New Zealanders.
It. Roberts will reappear at center.
Ills whirlwind progress with the bah
was a big feature in the Barbarian
game on St. Ignatius field.
Phenomenal playing may be expect
ed at wing. In the All Black-Cali
fonia game his fifty yard boot for goal !
in the opening minuses of play was
a thriller. Stohr is credited with
seventy yard goal kicks in several
New Zealand games. McGregor, the
other wing, probably played his best
game of the tour on Wednesday. His
dodging runs were past solution.
Cuthill will demonstrate again at
full. His kick and speed make him
formidable, but it is reported that he
has not yet shown his best form. He
is one of the youngest men with the
All Blacks, and is a university star.
The New Zealand press declares him
to be without a peer, past or present,
in the position.
Among the forwards will appear
a nearly invincible combination of
ruggers.
Harold Murray will go in in place
of Captain McDonald at wing for
ward. Murray is numbered among
New Zealand's masters of the game.
He is always on the ball, and plays
a game of lightning speed. His antics
about the scrum will make it difficult
for the Varsity forwards to get the
play into the back field.
Sellers is reputed to be the best
hooker in New Zealand. Wylie, who
came to California with the Waratahs
last year, is the most dependable line
out man, and is gifted with great ac
curacy in passing.
Atkinson at lock is a genius at hold
ing the scrum together.
Williams, Bruce, Douglas and Gra
ham are an aggressive quartet of for
wards who will fight hard to secure
the ball, and will figure prominently
in the loose.
