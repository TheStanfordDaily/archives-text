# INVINCIBLE BLACKS TAKE HARD-FOUGHT TURF BATTLE
## Score Is 56-0 in Match Marked by Improved Work on the Part of Stanford in Ever-Fighting Game. 
### 
With the forwards as well as the
backs playing the ever-fighting brand
of rugby, the Stanford fifteen Satur
day afternoon succeeded in preventing
much of that machine-like team work
displayed by the All Blacks on Wed
nesday. At that the All Blacks were
not to be denied a score past the half
century mark, and by means of bril
liant individual rugby, broken at times
by flashes of open backfield work, roll
ed up 56 points to (he nothing of their
doggedly fighting opponents.
As an example of this individual
starring, the try made by McGregor in
the second half has probably seen few
equals on any turf. Dodging, side
stepping, and wriggling through the
whole tired-out Stanford team, the lit
tle Scott carried the leather forty
yards to the try.
A Stanford team inferior 011 paper to
that which played on Wednesday had
apparently well-learned the lessons
of that day's battle.
i ighting even harder than did the
Cardinal ruggers of the midweek
game, tackling more surely, and best
of all, with the forwards closely fol
lowing the play, the team played a
game which won the approbation of
Stanfi rdites and New Zealanders alike.
Graham's kickoff was returned to
the Stanford forty yard line by Ur
ban. The Varsity forwards settled in
to a strong defense at once, and began

the plucky fight that characterized
their play throughout the game. A
free kick for Stanford from the twen
ty-live yard line entered Davidson, at
five eighths into a kicking duel with
the All Black backs in which his ac
curacy and distance held the game
near center for several minutes.
The Cardinal defense was broken
when Graham secured at the New Zea
land forty, and ran to the Stanford live
yard line, where he was downed by
Kauffman. Loveridge later got the ball
from the scrum and slipped through
, the line of defense for a try. Stohr
failed to convert. Score 3-0.
Roberts received the kickoff, and
1 attempted to drop from the 40 yard
line, which fell short of the goal posts.
1 Gray got the ball from a 15 yard scrum
and commenced a dazing run with
Mitchenson, Roberts and Stohr, which
allowed the latter to score. Roberts
converted. Score S-0.
The third try was registered when
Murray, the All Black's wing forward,
snatched the ball from the ground on
I the ten yard lino and waded across
the goal line. Stohr converted nicely.
Score 13-0.
Just before the try was made, Love
ridge, the New Zealand half, re-sprain
ed an ankle. The accident caused a
shakeup in the All Black's line, Lynch
being put in at wing.
Murray again figured in the scoring
machinery when he ran with the ball
from the twenty yard line and passed
to Wylie for the fourth try. Roberts'
attempt at conversion failed. Score
16-0.
Following Davidson's forty yard
kick through to touch on the New Zea
land forty, Gray caught the ball from
the scrum, passing to McGregor for a
pretty run and try. Stohr converted
easily. Score 21-0.
The growth of the score during the
first half ended when Stohr intercept
ed on the twenty-five yard line, and
passed to McGregor, later receiving It
again to cross the goal line. He con
verted, making the score at the end
of the half 26-0.
Scoring Plays of the Second Half.
Kauffman warded off a try by kick
ing from the ground on the Stanford
five to touch at the twenty-five yard
line. Murray soon carried the ball
back to goal, after receiving from
Gray, who intercepted a kick on the

at conversion by Stohr failed. Score
12-0.
Atkinson and Douglas achieved a
joint try by converting the ball after
they had been forced over by the All
Black forwards. Lynch's conversion
raised the score to 34.
Immediately after Stohr failed to
drop over the bar from the fiffty yard
line, McGregor received the ball from
the Stanford backs and executed a
brilliant corkscrew run through a
close field which resulted in the most
spectacular try of the game. Roberts
passed to Murray, who forced a path
across the line. Lynch missed the
goal. Score 40-0.
Three points were added when

passed to Roberts after a dodging
run which baffled the defense. The

riddle for the tackling backs when

scrum and snapped to his mate for
a try. Graham converted. Score 48-0.

allowed to score. Successful conver
