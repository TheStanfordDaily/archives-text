# D.J. GUINEY SPEAKS ON NEW ZEALAND NEWSPAPERS
## Commends Our Sporting News and Shows High Regard for Our Magazines. 
### 
D. J. Guiney, New Zealand corres
pondent with the All Blacks, present
ed an interesting comparison of
American and New Zealand newspap
ers in a talk at the Chapel this after
noon.
His remarks in part were as fol
lows:
"New Zealand has a high degree of
literacy, and the people take a great
interest in their papers. We follow
essentially the English type of news
paper.
"The difference that struck me on
my first look at an American paper
was the first page. Here your papers
have large headlines and pictures on
the first page where they spread all
their news. With us the heads are
small, and the front page is occupied
by advertisements. The New Zealand
Times once tried the American style
of make-up, but it did not suit the
people.
"Your papers here report the events
as they are in the opinion of the re
porter or in view of the paper's poli
cy, while we print the facts with ab
solutely no coloring.
"A story in our papers must be
read clear through like a novel to get
the gist of it, while an American pa
per has all the essentials in the lead.
The stories are also written up in a
more personal style, somewhat cor
responding to American reports of
social affairs. The people like to
read of themselves and of their do
ings. This local coloring does not
appear nearly so strongly in the pi
pers here. However, a great interest
in world news is also shown. One
complete page is given to world cab
les. Commercial and political news
are carefully chronicled, market
quotations, and financial statements
are universally read. Fifteen columns
are given to the annual financial
statement of the government.
"Our papers look to the American
magazines as the best, and take sto
ries from them for a fiction column
in the paper. As in America, sports
are given prominence. The sporting
writers are the only specialized re
porters on our papers. As no Sun
day -editions come out, we get out.
the Saturday sports in a special edi
tion about S o'clock on Saturday even
ing. All reporters work twelve hours
a day.
"The Americans seem to want to be
entertained by their papers. They
want sensational news, whether it is
true or not. The papers hit the
Americans in the eye. The New Zea
lander seeks not only to be enter
tained in his paper, but also to be
educated. The paper is read thor
oughly from front to back.
