# INTERSCHOLASTIC RUGBY MATCHES ARE PROPOSED
## Skull and Snakes Society Plans to Found Annual All-Star Football Meet Next Thanksgiving Day. 
### 
All star interscholastic rugby be
twoen teams .that represent the be3t
football skill of Northern and South
ern California respectively has been
proposed, and is now being projected
by Skull and Snakes honor society.
The match will be played on Stan
ford Field next Thanksgiving day if
plans mature, as they promise to do.
Success in the new departure will es
tablish an annual institution of as
much value to preparatory school ath
letics and interest to the public as is
the interscholastic track meet, which
was originated at Stanford in 1906.
To date the proposition stands in
skeleton form. Skull and Snakes so
ciety has set a committee at work to
estimate llie financial expense and to
formulate a means of selecting the
i two teams.
A committee of three men who are
; familiar with high school rugby
:in the two sections will likely be
! appointed to choose the best quali
. fled players. Xo distinct boundary
! h is yet been drawn between the terri-
I tories which shall comprise north and
i south. Los Angeles logically forms
i the active center of the southern
province, while one of the Bay cities
serves in the northern part of the
state.
The task of selection will not be dif
ficult for men who are in close touch
with the season's schedules, results,

and lineups. For several years past
the newspapers have picked all star
teams from the high schools 011 paper.
The method of collecting an actual
playing combination will rest on much
the same comparative standard. Each
squad will be allowed eighteen or
twenty players.
Some question has been raised as
to the possibility of getting a good
brand of playing from teams that have
not developed team work, both in prac
tice and in contests. It is probable
that the interscholastic teams will
give a much more natural exhibition
of rugby than the American team of
all stars which is to meet New Zea
land. The reason is that preparatory
school teams are not primarily coach
made.
Since the California Rugby Union
is divided into a northern and a south
ern province, the teams in the differ
ent zones have ordinarily little chance
to meet eacli other. The annual inter
scholastic match which Skull and
Snakes propose to stage 011 the Stan
ford turf will make a practical judge
ment of merit possible.
The expenses of all ruggers who are
chosen to represent their portion of
California will be fully paid from the
time they leave home. Distinctive
colors will be assigned each team, and
the jerseys used will be awarded the
players.
