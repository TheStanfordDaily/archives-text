# MANAGER MASON TELLS OF LAST GAME AND STAY
## EXPRESSES APPRECIATION FOR NEW ZEALANDERS Suggests Developing Scoring Plays By Varsity. Says "The Best Defense is Attack." 
### 
Manager George H. Mason, of the
New Zealand "All Blacks," has the
following to say regarding the linal
game between his team and the Var
sity, and of their stay on the campus:
The second match between Stanford
University and the All Blacks was
hardly as interesting as the first. The
absence of Carroll and Austin from
the Cardinal ranks was severely felt
and one or two of the alterations in
the visitors' team did not make for
improvement. At the commencement
of the game the students went into
their work with plenty of vim and
dash and kept their doughty oppon
ents busy. For some little time it
looked as though Stanford would be
the first team to register a score
against the All Blacks. There were
certainly two openings which should
have been taken advantage of. The
opportunities were, however, lost,
and with the combination of our new
team improving, the chances of Stan
ford rapidly diminished, and it soon
became only a question of how many
points our fellows would put up.
The Varsity boys worked every Lit
as hard as Wednesday's team, but
there is wanting in their work the fin
ishing touch which gets tries, ami
without which a team may put in an
enormous amount of work without
achieving the desired end.
I would suggest, with all due defer
ence to those who have the team in
hand, that more encouragement
should be given to the members of the
team to develop attacking methods.
In New Zealand we are strong believ
ers in the declaration that "the best
defense is attack," and although that
creed may be overtaxed, it could be
preached vigorously over here to the
great improvement of the play.
1 hope that the heavy scores regis
tered against Stanford in these two
games will not in the least discour
age the players. Remember that they
are the first teams that have had to
meet us under conditions in any way
favorable to us; conditions similar
(with the exception of the heat), to
those under which we play the game
at home. If they will forget the
scores and remember the tactics and
skill which produced those scores the
two games with the All Blacks will
produce good results and effect great
improvement in the play of every
member of your team.
Yesterday our short stay at Stanford
expired and we returned to the city.
May I take this opportunity of return
ing thanks, on behalf of the boys and
myself, to all who have been so kind
and attentive to us. Our visit to the
campus has been a delightful one,
and we all hope to run out again be
fore leaving for home, if only to say
farewell to the many friends that we
have made here. Everyone has treat
ed us so generously, and to profess
ors, graduates and undergraduates,
both men and women, we owe our
gratitude.
The women students have added
their quota to our enjoyment, and
those of us who had the pleasure of
meeting them at afternoon tea and
dinner will long remember the pleas
ant time spent in their company.
In leaving this delightful spot we
heartily wish success to Stanford, and
sincerely hope each and every one of
us that we may be spared to visit sun
ny California again at some future
time, and that visit will assuredly in
clude a run down to Palo Alto and the
campus of Stanford University.

ors, graduates and undergraduates,
both men and women, we owe our
gratitude.
The women students have added
their quota to our enjoyment, and
those of us who had the pleasure of
meeting them at afternoon tea and
dinner will long remember the pleas
ant time spent in their company.
In leaving this delightful spot we
heartily wish success to Stanford, and
sincerely hope each and every one of
us that we may be spared to visit sun
ny California again at some future
time, and that visit will assuredly in
clude a run down to Palo Alto and the
campus of Stanford University.
Manager George H. Mason, of the
New Zealand "All Blacks," has the
following to say regarding the linal
game between his team and the Var
sity, and of their stay on the campus:
The second match between Stanford
University and the All Blacks was
hardly as interesting as the first. The
absence of Carroll and Austin from
the Cardinal ranks was severely felt
and one or two of the alterations in
the visitors' team did not make for
improvement. At the commencement
of the game the students went into
their work with plenty of vim and
dash and kept their doughty oppon
ents busy. For some little time it
looked as though Stanford would be
the first team to register a score
against the All Blacks. There were
certainly two openings which should
have been taken advantage of. The
opportunities were, however, lost,
and with the combination of our new
team improving, the chances of Stan
ford rapidly diminished, and it soon
became only a question of how many
points our fellows would put up.
The Varsity boys worked every Lit
as hard as Wednesday's team, but
there is wanting in their work the fin
ishing touch which gets tries, ami
without which a team may put in an
enormous amount of work without
achieving the desired end.
I would suggest, with all due defer
ence to those who have the team in
hand, that more encouragement
should be given to the members of the
team to develop attacking methods.
In New Zealand we are strong believ
ers in the declaration that "the best
defense is attack," and although that
creed may be overtaxed, it could be
preached vigorously over here to the
great improvement of the play.
1 hope that the heavy scores regis
tered against Stanford in these two
games will not in the least discour
age the players. Remember that they
are the first teams that have had to
meet us under conditions in any way
favorable to us; conditions similar
(with the exception of the heat), to
those under which we play the game
at home. If they will forget the
scores and remember the tactics and
skill which produced those scores the
two games with the All Blacks will
produce good results and effect great
improvement in the play of every
member of your team.
Yesterday our short stay at Stanford
expired and we returned to the city.
May I take this opportunity of return
ing thanks, on behalf of the boys and
myself, to all who have been so kind
and attentive to us. Our visit to the
campus has been a delightful one,
and we all hope to run out again be
fore leaving for home, if only to say
farewell to the many friends that we
have made here. Everyone has treat
ed us so generously, and to profess
ors, graduates and undergraduates,
both men and women, we owe our
gratitude.
