# WHAT STANFORD ALUMNI ARE DOING IN NICARAGUA
## 
### 
A. W. Frolli, '10, and G. E. Cheda,
'10, have recently returned from the
mines of Nicaragua, where six Stan
ford graduates are located, and give
interesting reports under which the
engineers work. With Frolli and
Cheda were L. .J. Taylor, Ml, and A.
Remington, '12, at the Babylonia gold
mine, in the same country H. Coe,
'03, is general manager and H. Cran
dall, '12, engineer at the Leonessa
mine. Frolli states that the country
has been unsettled since the revolu
tion of 1912, and that 100 American
troops are stationed there for police
duty. The Babylon mine is four clays'
journey from the west coast in a heal
thy, yet rainy climate. The trip from
the coast to the mine is made by train
to Lake Nicaragua. One day is spent
in crossing the lake and two days
more over land on mules.
