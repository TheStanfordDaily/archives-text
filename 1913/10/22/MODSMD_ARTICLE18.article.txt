# Borrowers

### 
The Bulgars have a proverb which
says that God is not sinless for he
created borrowers. The borrower be
longs to a class which the strenuous
Mr. Roosevelt would call "undesirable
citizens." The worst genus of the en-

tire species is the man or
woman who borrows with
out so much as request-

ing the consent of the owner of a par
ticular object. For many years we
have prided ourselves on the security
which we have felt in the matter of
leaving our property unattended at
any time or place on the campus.
There has recently grown up a class
of individuals which have become a
public nuisance and deserve suppress
ion. These are the persons who ob
tain from others with the expressed
or implied promise of returning either
the article or its equivalent but neg
lect to carry out their good intentions.
Bicycles are the most common ob
jects of the depredations of these
pests, who probably tire of relying
on their own powers of locomotion in
wending their weary way about the
campus. Without any qualms of
conscience the hospitality of some in
nocent owner is accepted and the lat
ter stands the loss. Continuance of
this borrowing nuisance will lead to
stringent action, for as B. Franklin
tells us in his Almanac, "He that goes
a borrowing, goes a sorrowing."
