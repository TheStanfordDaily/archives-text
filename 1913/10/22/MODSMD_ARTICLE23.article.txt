# PAINTINGS OF H.V. POOR PRAISED AS REAL ART
## FIGURES ESPECIALLY SHOW EVEN BALANCE Critic Commends Work of Stanford Man To Be Exhibited Beginning Saturday. 
### Arthur B. Clark 
The paintings which Mr. Henry V.
Poor will exhibit for two weeks, be
ginning Saturday next, show progress
as the Stanford public who saw his
exhibit of two years ago will nat
urally expect, and yet the figure
paintings especially will startle by
their vigor of conception and artistic
style. Their type is new in the Stan
ford exhibits, and they demand study,
not one but several while the exhibit
lasts.
How can one describe this art?
Consider, for example, the full size
portrait group called "The Lunch
eon;" a mother and child are seated
at a table and the grandmother stands
between them pouring tea. The scene
is real, the colors glow in the light,
the method is direct, the "old rose"
gown is charming in color and qual
ity, the plates, cups, trays and spoons
have a freshness and unlabored spon
taneity which is technically delight
ful, the flesh tones are good, the draw
ing is strong; and yet, when all of
this is said, the art of the picture is
scarcely hinted at. Great art not
merely recalls beauty, but expounds
it. The modeling here is within slight
range, still it is firm, strong light and
shade are absent, the picture is sim
plicity itself. Perhaps the secret of
the greatness of this art —and it is
truly great—is its grasp of essential
truth and beauty, and the rejection of
fortuitous incident or over-painting,
—the perception that even balance;
painting the subject in its simplicity,
the costumes of rich colors, rose,
black and tan, the attitudes, natural,
and not conscious, is sufficient.
An artist of less caliber would have
fussed over the garments until their
details concealed their identities, and
have over-posed and over-modeled
the figures until they were common
place, all the time losing relative bal
ance and charm. But here the great
harmonious relations were perceived
at the beginning when the painting
was first determined and they have
been preserved through its painting.
See the face of the boy, with eyes like
brown beads in the slightly modelled
face, so in the other faces and in the
details of the dishes, nothing is over
done nor under done, but the rich col
ors and forms of reality are presented
evenly. This picture repays hours of
study.
The "Portrait —the Blue Pitcher"
shows the satne conviction and force
in choice of subject, and the same firm
drawing; see the grasp of the hand on
the pitcher and the drawing of the
same arm. We may understand why

this painting was so well received
at the most important Eastern exhib
ition last Spring.
The "Mother with the Sleeping
Baby," (The Salmon Gown), will not
be appreciated for what it is—unless
one knows Manet or Degas, and to
understand them took thirty years,
and yet the simple way in which the
finest quality of color is here shown,
and the uncompromising truth with
which the subject is painted are the
characteristics of the. greatest type
of modern art.
One landscape painting shows a
stretch of sea, a distant deep-blue
mountain range, a brown hay field,
and a sand dune fringed by a large
patch of rich green forest. Contrast
of tones, richness of color, and sim
plicity of treatment characterize this
painting.
"The Cattle," lying on a snow-cov
ered hillside presents the same color
charm. "The Wharf at Monterey" has
the same qualities, with intense blue,
rich chocolate and orange and warm
greys, which dazzle and yet harmon
ize.
These and other canvasses show
Mr. Poor's style to consist in a sub
ject selection containing strong and
contrasting colors, direct painting,
firm drawing and solid, but slight
modeling, a method which ignores the
pretty and casual, and emphasizes the
essential, the significant and the per
manent.

plicity itself. Perhaps the secret of
the greatness of this art —and it is
truly great—is its grasp of essential
truth and beauty, and the rejection of
fortuitous incident or over-painting,
—the perception that even balance;
painting the subject in its simplicity,
the costumes of rich colors, rose,
black and tan, the attitudes, natural,
and not conscious, is sufficient.
An artist of less caliber would have
fussed over the garments until their
details concealed their identities, and
have over-posed and over-modeled
the figures until they were common
place, all the time losing relative bal
ance and charm. But here the great
harmonious relations were perceived
at the beginning when the painting
was first determined and they have
been preserved through its painting.
See the face of the boy, with eyes like
brown beads in the slightly modelled
face, so in the other faces and in the
details of the dishes, nothing is over
done nor under done, but the rich col
ors and forms of reality are presented
evenly. This picture repays hours of
study.
The "Portrait —the Blue Pitcher"
shows the satne conviction and force
in choice of subject, and the same firm
drawing; see the grasp of the hand on
the pitcher and the drawing of the
same arm. We may understand why

this painting was so well received
at the most important Eastern exhib
ition last Spring.
The "Mother with the Sleeping
Baby," (The Salmon Gown), will not
be appreciated for what it is—unless
one knows Manet or Degas, and to
understand them took thirty years,
and yet the simple way in which the
finest quality of color is here shown,
and the uncompromising truth with
which the subject is painted are the
characteristics of the. greatest type
of modern art.
One landscape painting shows a
stretch of sea, a distant deep-blue
mountain range, a brown hay field,
and a sand dune fringed by a large
patch of rich green forest. Contrast
of tones, richness of color, and sim
plicity of treatment characterize this
painting.
"The Cattle," lying on a snow-cov
ered hillside presents the same color
charm. "The Wharf at Monterey" has
the same qualities, with intense blue,
rich chocolate and orange and warm
greys, which dazzle and yet harmon
ize.
These and other canvasses show
Mr. Poor's style to consist in a sub
ject selection containing strong and
contrasting colors, direct painting,
firm drawing and solid, but slight
modeling, a method which ignores the
pretty and casual, and emphasizes the
essential, the significant and the per
manent.
The paintings which Mr. Henry V.
Poor will exhibit for two weeks, be
ginning Saturday next, show progress
as the Stanford public who saw his
exhibit of two years ago will nat
urally expect, and yet the figure
paintings especially will startle by
their vigor of conception and artistic
style. Their type is new in the Stan
ford exhibits, and they demand study,
not one but several while the exhibit
lasts.
How can one describe this art?
Consider, for example, the full size
portrait group called "The Lunch
eon;" a mother and child are seated
at a table and the grandmother stands
between them pouring tea. The scene
is real, the colors glow in the light,
the method is direct, the "old rose"
gown is charming in color and qual
ity, the plates, cups, trays and spoons
have a freshness and unlabored spon
taneity which is technically delight
ful, the flesh tones are good, the draw
ing is strong; and yet, when all of
this is said, the art of the picture is
scarcely hinted at. Great art not
merely recalls beauty, but expounds
it. The modeling here is within slight
range, still it is firm, strong light and
shade are absent, the picture is sim
plicity itself. Perhaps the secret of
