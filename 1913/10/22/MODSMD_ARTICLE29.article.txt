# COMMITTEES INCREASE LOCAL Y.M.C.A. ROLL.
## 
### 
As a result of the membership coiu
mittees in Encina and Palo Alto
which have been working for several
weeks, the membership of the Y. M.
C. A. has reached 140.
J. W. Kaufman, 'IG, is chairman of
the Encina membership committee,
and J. lv. Norton, '16, the chairman of
the committee which is working in
Palo Alto. Complete reports are not
yet received from three committees.
Instead of conducting a member
ship canvass the Y. M. C. A. has made
membership a matter of invitation,
aiming to allow every man in the uni
versity a chance to join. Through the
courtesy of the city associations of
California, membership tickets in the
Stanford association is recognized for
full social privileges in these associa
tions and also grants full privileges
to students who are visitors in their
buildings.
