# ACTIVE PLANS FORMULATED FOR INTERSCHOLASTIC RUGBY
## 
### 
Prospects for the interscholastic
rugby match at Stanford next Thanks
giving have been advanced a notch
further by the appointment of a com
mittee on arrangements, with A. O.
Gragg," '12, as chairman. The new
venture to hold an annual football
game at Stanford, between teams of
preparatory school stars from the
north and south of California was
originated by Skull and Snakes. The
honor society will plan actively for
the contest from now on.
The arrangements committee is in
structed to appoint two committees
to select the northern and southern
teams at once. The selection com
mittees will be composed of three men
each, who are in close touch with
high school games and players. One
committee will choose the northern
team and the other the team that will
represent Southern California.
Telnu'hapi Dividing Line.
Tehachapi has been made the divid
ing line between the north and south
in the present case, as it is usually
considered, and should be the fairest
possible division.
Further provisions if the prelim
inary regulations formed by Skull and
Snakes follow: Each team will be
allowed nineteen players and a man
ager or coach, making in all twenty
men. Ti e expenses of the visitors
will be paid from the time they leave
their homes. During their stay on

the campus they will be housed in the
fraternity houses.
Varsity men will be assigned to
coach the two teams as soon as they
arrive.
It is likely that a second list of
players for each section of the state
will be chosen by the committee, to
act as substitutes in case of accident
to the first teams.
Emblems that have been suggested
for the players call for red and white
jerseys. Members of the white jer
seyed team will have a red shield
with a white "S," while the wearers
of the red will have a white shield
with a red "S." Football outfits will
be furnished the members of the
teams, which they will be allowed to
keep.
The method of advertising the in
terscholastic football match will be
much the same as that used in the
publicity campaign for the inter
scholastic track meet. Letters will
be sent to the high schools and other
preparatory schools throughout the
state, and later posters will be dis
tributed.
Representatives of various prepar
atory schools on the campus are al
ready speculating on the prospects
of their home towns in the match.
There is evidence that the members
of the teams will have ardent sup
porters from among the Stanford
students in the bleachers.

Prospects for the interscholastic
rugby match at Stanford next Thanks
giving have been advanced a notch
further by the appointment of a com
mittee on arrangements, with A. O.
Gragg," '12, as chairman. The new
venture to hold an annual football
game at Stanford, between teams of
preparatory school stars from the
north and south of California was
originated by Skull and Snakes. The
honor society will plan actively for
the contest from now on.
The arrangements committee is in
structed to appoint two committees
to select the northern and southern
teams at once. The selection com
mittees will be composed of three men
each, who are in close touch with
high school games and players. One
committee will choose the northern
team and the other the team that will
represent Southern California.
Telnu'hapi Dividing Line.
Tehachapi has been made the divid
ing line between the north and south
in the present case, as it is usually
considered, and should be the fairest
possible division.
Further provisions if the prelim
inary regulations formed by Skull and
Snakes follow: Each team will be
allowed nineteen players and a man
ager or coach, making in all twenty
men. Ti e expenses of the visitors
will be paid from the time they leave
their homes. During their stay on

the campus they will be housed in the
fraternity houses.
Varsity men will be assigned to
coach the two teams as soon as they
arrive.
It is likely that a second list of
players for each section of the state
will be chosen by the committee, to
act as substitutes in case of accident
to the first teams.
Emblems that have been suggested
for the players call for red and white
jerseys. Members of the white jer
seyed team will have a red shield
with a white "S," while the wearers
of the red will have a white shield
with a red "S." Football outfits will
be furnished the members of the
teams, which they will be allowed to
keep.
