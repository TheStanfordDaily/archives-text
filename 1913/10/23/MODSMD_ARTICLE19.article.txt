# GRAYS FIGHT BLACKS TO A THREE-POINT VICTORY
## VARSITY SQUADS FIGURE IN A CLOSE MATCH. Forwards Assume Most of the Work and Make All Advances of Ball Difficult. 
### 
Thirty minutes of whole-hearted
fight dominate the rugby game yester

three to nothing victory for the Vars
ity Grays over the black jerseyed men.
The forwards of both teams should
ered the big share of the game, but
occasionally got the ball out of the
scrum for open play in the backfleld.
Little chance was given either side
for fast or brilliant play. The pro
gress from one end of the field to the
other was slow, and accomplished
in the face of Continued resistance.
During the first period the Grays
had a shade the best of the game, and
their advances were steady. Con
ditions were reversed in the second
half, and Black scores were in calling
distance several times.
Whitaker kicked off for the Grays,
and the play was followed into the
Black's territory. Wynne made a pret
ty side kick to Long for a run that
ended with a scrum on the five yard
line. The Blacks saved, but after the
kickout, the Gray forwards again
forced a path to the five yard line.
From a five yard scrum Clark secured
and started a passing rush between
Dickey and Andrews which allowed
Whitaker to cross the goal line. Det
els failed to convert, and the score
of the game was fixed at 3-0.
The Blacks at once began an at
tempt to retrieve the score by taking
the game to center field in the face
of stubborn opposition. Offensive
work in the scrum and a number of
short runs were responsible for the
gain. Davidson, playing at full for
the Blacks, checked an attempt for
a second try by securing on the
twenty-five yard line and kicking
touch on the Gray's forty.
In the second half, a dribbling rush
by the Grays which started at center
took the ball to the Black's twenty
yard line after a long kick from the
ground by Ogden. The Gray for
wards started down the field with
a hope to score which was terminated
abruptly when Davidson saved by
finding touch on the twenty-five yard
line. Play was held near center until

twenty-five yard line and kicking
touch on the Gray's forty.
In the second half, a dribbling rush
by the Grays which started at center
took the ball to the Black's twenty
yard line after a long kick from the
ground by Ogden. The Gray for
wards started down the field with
a hope to score which was terminated
abruptly when Davidson saved by
finding touch on the twenty-five yard
line. Play was held near center until
the end of the game. Late in the
second half, Davidson was shifted to
the Gray's backfield, along with other
substitutions and changes in the line
ups.

Grays: —Vanderberg, Franceschi,
Single, Whitaker, Ogden, .Tacomini,
Dubendorf, Soper, Clark, half; Dickey,

Thirty minutes of whole-hearted
fight dominate the rugby game yester
day afternoon, which resulted in a
three to nothing victory for the Vars
ity Grays over the black jerseyed men.
The forwards of both teams should
ered the big share of the game, but
occasionally got the ball out of the
scrum for open play in the backfleld.
Little chance was given either side
for fast or brilliant play. The pro
gress from one end of the field to the
other was slow, and accomplished
in the face of Continued resistance.
During the first period the Grays
had a shade the best of the game, and
their advances were steady. Con
ditions were reversed in the second
half, and Black scores were in calling
distance several times.
Whitaker kicked off for the Grays,
and the play was followed into the
Black's territory. Wynne made a pret
ty side kick to Long for a run that
ended with a scrum on the five yard
line. The Blacks saved, but after the
kickout, the Gray forwards again
forced a path to the five yard line.
From a five yard scrum Clark secured
and started a passing rush between
Dickey and Andrews which allowed
Whitaker to cross the goal line. Det
els failed to convert, and the score
of the game was fixed at 3-0.
The Blacks at once began an at
tempt to retrieve the score by taking
the game to center field in the face
of stubborn opposition. Offensive
work in the scrum and a number of
short runs were responsible for the
gain. Davidson, playing at full for
the Blacks, checked an attempt for
a second try by securing on the
twenty-five yard line and kicking
touch on the Gray's forty.
