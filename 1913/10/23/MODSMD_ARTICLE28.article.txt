# INVINCIBLE BLACKS DOWN SANTA CLARANS
## 42-0 is Score at End of Exhibition Before Great Crowd in Golden Gate Park. 
### 
"Our goal line uncrossed on Cali
fornia soil" is still the record of the
All 1 Slacks after yesterday's contest
with Santa Clara in the Golden Gate
Park Stadium. 42-0 was the score
at the end of the exhibition.
Though they played a wonderful
game, the showing of the visitors was
not the most remarkable of which
they are capable, particularly in the
first half. At the end of that period
the score was only 9-0. This is partly
to be explained, however, on the
ground that the Santa Clarans played
a strong offensive game, which served
them as well as an effective defense.
The play of the collegians was ag
gressive throughout. At the same
time the game of the wearers of the
fern was not water-tight. All three
tries in this half were made by "Dick"
Roberts, the stellar center three of
the New Zealanders.
In the second period the New Zea
landers by active and brilliant offen
sive tactics bewildered the tired San
ta Clarans and rolled up thirty-three
points. During this half "Dougie"
McGregor delighted the bleachers
with another twisting and squirming
clash for a try, similar to the one
which he made during the second
Stanford game.
