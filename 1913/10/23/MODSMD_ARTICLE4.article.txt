# CAPTAIN THOBURN DISABLED; DARSIE WILL DIRECT VARSITY
## 
### 
Captain "Jimmy" Thoburn will be
unable to lead the 1913 Stanford Vars
ity against California on November

eighth because of
a dangerous
blood clot that
has formed be
tween the mus
cles of his left
leg. The injury
was received in
the game be
tween the Vars
ity and Barbar
ian team on Oc
tober 4, by the
impact of one of
the players'knee.
Coach Floyd
Brown of the
Varsity said this

afternoon: "Thoburn's condition is
such that it will be impossible for
him to play against California. In
view of that fact, the captain and
coach have appointed "Bill" Darsie
to act as field captain."
Since receiving the injury, Captain
Thoburn has had the medical atten
tion ot' Dr. E. Williams, of Palo Alto,
lie is now under treatment of Trainer
11. W. Maloney, who is massaging the
leg and applying hot poultices.
There is little possibility that the
crutches can be laid aside inside of
ten days at least.
Following is the substance of a

statement made by Dr. Williams yes
terday when Maloney asked him for
a definite opinion on Thoburn's con
dition: "Thoburn would not be able

to play at his
best if he should
attempt to go on
the field in the
Big Game. He
would run great
risk of ruining
his future career
as an athlete. I
consider it use
less to hope that
he will be in fit
condition to take
the chance."
Captain Tho
burn was placed
under experts

and poultices were looked to as a
remedy for the injury. Instead of the
blood clot being removed it has been
dislodged from its original position
between two thick sheet muscles of
the upper leg, and now lies at the
side of the leg, just above the knee.
Monday afternoon, Captain Tho
burn attended practice as a spectator,
and though he was using crutches at
the time, his splints had been remov
ed. He expressed the hope that he
would be able to resume practice last
night. The new turn of the difficulty
resulted from an examination made by
Dr. Williams yesterday afternoon.

and poultices were looked to as a
remedy for the injury. Instead of the
blood clot being removed it has been
dislodged from its original position
between two thick sheet muscles of
the upper leg, and now lies at the
side of the leg, just above the knee.
Monday afternoon, Captain Tho
burn attended practice as a spectator,
and though he was using crutches at
the time, his splints had been remov
ed. He expressed the hope that he
would be able to resume practice last
night. The new turn of the difficulty
resulted from an examination made by
Dr. Williams yesterday afternoon.
