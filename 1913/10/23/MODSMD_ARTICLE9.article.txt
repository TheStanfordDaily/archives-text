# COMMITTEE WILL COACH NOVICE TRACK ATHLETES
## FRESHMEN WILL CONTINUE FALL TRAINING Cross Country Runners and Track Men Prepare for Annual Fall Meet. 
### 
Every energy on the track from
now on will be devoted to training
the Freshmen and new men in prepa
ration for next spring's work. The
Varsity men will devote their entire
time looking after all the athletes
who are out for track or field events
on the oval.
In preparation for this new system
of training a committee has been ap
pointed by Captain P. B. McKee, '14,
consisting of eleven varsity men.
The committee and the events each
one will look after are: P. B. McKee,
100 and 220 yard dashes; E. P. Camp
bell, '13, 440 yard dash and broad
jump; E. M. Bonnett, '15, 880 yard
run; P. R. Wilson, 'IG, mile and two
mile; P. S. Murray, '16, low hurdles;
J. H. Whitted, '16, high hurdles; J. M.
Tufts, pole vault; R. R. Templeton,
'15, high jump; G. W. Bedeau, '15,
shotput; B. P. Drake, and V. L. King,
'16, hammer throw. These men will
be at the track every day and person
ally take charge of the new men in
the respective events.
Last year the same system was in
augurated for the spring work, but
it is the first time that so much em
phasis has been laid on the fall work.
The men who train this season will
undoubtedly be in better trim to start
on spring training next January after
two months workout than if they did
not train regularly.
All Freshmen finishing football work
or those who have been out for other
sports and have dropped them are
urged to come out. "Dad" says "If
you never come out we can never
see what you are made of."
It is still possible to sign up for
cross country running. The squad
of hill chasers is increasing daily in
anticipation of the cross country race
next month. The men leave the train
ing house three times a week, on
Monday, Wednesday and Friday after
noons at five o'clock for a run of from
one to three miles. The squad is di
vided into several groups, and the
men proportioned to their ability and
endurance to run.
At the same time as the annual
cross country race there will be a
novice interclass track meet for all
men who have been training regu
larly on the track. No varsity men
will compete in this contest as it is
primarily a meet set aside for new
athletes.
When the novice men go out. for
training they are asked to report to
a member of the committee in order
that they may be instructed in the
workouts and be aided in any way
possible.

two months workout than if they did
not train regularly.
All Freshmen finishing football work
or those who have been out for other
sports and have dropped them are
urged to come out. "Dad" says "If
you never come out we can never
see what you are made of."
It is still possible to sign up for
cross country running. The squad
of hill chasers is increasing daily in
anticipation of the cross country race
next month. The men leave the train
ing house three times a week, on
Monday, Wednesday and Friday after
noons at five o'clock for a run of from
one to three miles. The squad is di
vided into several groups, and the
men proportioned to their ability and
endurance to run.
At the same time as the annual
cross country race there will be a
novice interclass track meet for all
men who have been training regu
larly on the track. No varsity men
will compete in this contest as it is
primarily a meet set aside for new
athletes.
When the novice men go out. for
training they are asked to report to
a member of the committee in order
that they may be instructed in the
workouts and be aided in any way
possible.
Every energy on the track from
now on will be devoted to training
the Freshmen and new men in prepa
ration for next spring's work. The
Varsity men will devote their entire
time looking after all the athletes
who are out for track or field events
on the oval.
In preparation for this new system
of training a committee has been ap
pointed by Captain P. B. McKee, '14,
consisting of eleven varsity men.
The committee and the events each
one will look after are: P. B. McKee,
100 and 220 yard dashes; E. P. Camp
bell, '13, 440 yard dash and broad
jump; E. M. Bonnett, '15, 880 yard
run; P. R. Wilson, 'IG, mile and two
mile; P. S. Murray, '16, low hurdles;
J. H. Whitted, '16, high hurdles; J. M.
Tufts, pole vault; R. R. Templeton,
'15, high jump; G. W. Bedeau, '15,
shotput; B. P. Drake, and V. L. King,
'16, hammer throw. These men will
be at the track every day and person
ally take charge of the new men in
the respective events.
Last year the same system was in
augurated for the spring work, but
it is the first time that so much em
phasis has been laid on the fall work.
The men who train this season will
undoubtedly be in better trim to start
on spring training next January after
two months workout than if they did
not train regularly.
