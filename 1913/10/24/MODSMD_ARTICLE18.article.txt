To the E i: .• uf Tlu Daily Palo Alto:
There has been a great deal of tall-:
since the first of the semester con
cerning the yelling on the bleachers.
Vnd there might be a great deal more
talk, because the rooting of the
Stanford students has been very poor.
The noise, the uniformity, and the
"pep" that goes to make successful
organized rooting has been lacking.
The enthusiasm of the rooters has
not been exemplified as it should bo.
The yells have been loose and the
songs that have been sung—sung is
hardly the proper word—have been
disjointed and out of pitch, tune, and
seemingly without a bit of heart.
It appears that we try to master too
many songs. Why not confine our ef
forts to two or three yells and the
same number of songs? These W3
could learn well and on the day of the
California game we could put all our
spirit into the rendition of these
pieces.
Two of the spontaneous yells ar*
very much out of place. These are
the "Fight 'em, Stanford," and "Scoiv-,
Varsity," which arise from the rooting
section when the fifteen is backed up
against the opponents' line or is about
to carry the ball over. Some of tlio
players slate the roar of "Score, Var
sity," rolling onto the field is not
the most pleasant sound to hear. It
seems out of place. I do not attempt
to claim that the rooters should no 112
yell when Stanford is about to score,
but I think that "Score, Varsity." is
bad form.
If we are going to have organized
yelling at the California game, why
should we not have it at its best? The
only way to have it this way is to con
centrate on what we intend to do.
Concentrate NOW. Do not wait until
the cardinal and the blue and gold
are fighting before you learn the
yells.
There is another thing concerning
the games that might bear mentioning.
That is the delay that always occurs
lust before the varsity trots onto th?
field. At almost every game thr*
spectators and the visiting players
are kept waiting by the collegians.
Why cannot their preparations be
started just a few minutes earlier?
This delay seems discourteous to both
visitors and the spectators.
These things have been brought to
my attention by people about the
campus who are "on the boat." It
seems the wish of many that the coa
litions lie remedied.
We want to go into the Big Gamo
not only at our best on the field, 1 ut
also in the bleachers. I hope for im
provement.

The yells have been loose and the
songs that have been sung—sung is
hardly the proper word—have been
disjointed and out of pitch, tune, and
seemingly without a bit of heart.
It appears that we try to master too
many songs. Why not confine our ef
forts to two or three yells and the
same number of songs? These W3
could learn well and on the day of the
California game we could put all our
spirit into the rendition of these
pieces.
Two of the spontaneous yells ar*
very much out of place. These are
the "Fight 'em, Stanford," and "Scoiv-,
Varsity," which arise from the rooting
section when the fifteen is backed up
against the opponents' line or is about
to carry the ball over. Some of tlio
players slate the roar of "Score, Var
sity," rolling onto the field is not
the most pleasant sound to hear. It
seems out of place. I do not attempt
to claim that the rooters should no 112
yell when Stanford is about to score,
but I think that "Score, Varsity." is
bad form.
If we are going to have organized
yelling at the California game, why
should we not have it at its best? The
only way to have it this way is to con
centrate on what we intend to do.
Concentrate NOW. Do not wait until
the cardinal and the blue and gold
are fighting before you learn the
yells.
There is another thing concerning
the games that might bear mentioning.
That is the delay that always occurs
lust before the varsity trots onto th?
field. At almost every game thr*
spectators and the visiting players
are kept waiting by the collegians.
Why cannot their preparations be
started just a few minutes earlier?
This delay seems discourteous to both
visitors and the spectators.
These things have been brought to
my attention by people about the
campus who are "on the boat." It
seems the wish of many that the coa
litions lie remedied.
We want to go into the Big Gamo
not only at our best on the field, 1 ut
also in the bleachers. I hope for im
provement.

To the E i: .• uf Tlu Daily Palo Alto:
There has been a great deal of tall-:
since the first of the semester con
cerning the yelling on the bleachers.
Vnd there might be a great deal more
talk, because the rooting of the
Stanford students has been very poor.
The noise, the uniformity, and the
"pep" that goes to make successful
organized rooting has been lacking.
The enthusiasm of the rooters has
not been exemplified as it should bo.
The yells have been loose and the
songs that have been sung—sung is
hardly the proper word—have been
disjointed and out of pitch, tune, and
seemingly without a bit of heart.
It appears that we try to master too
many songs. Why not confine our ef
