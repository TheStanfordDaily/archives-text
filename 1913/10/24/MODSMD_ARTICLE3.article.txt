# OLD INJURY WILL KEEP RAY BROWN FROM GAME
## SURGICAL EXPERTS SAY RISK WOULD BE GREAT. Broken and Displaced Vertebrae In Neck Are Result of Hurt In Freshmen Year. 
### 
Ray Brown, whose skillful demon
stration!- on the rugby field this sea
son have promised to bear remarkable
results in the contest with California
on November :-th, is the second Varsity
man to be proscribed by serious in-

jury. Dr. Leonard
W. Ely, professor
in orthopedic sur
gery in the Stan
ford Medical De
partment, submit
ted expert testi
mony on the case
at a special meet
ing of the Faculty
Athletics C'ommit-

tee yesterday afternoon. The result of
Dr. Ely's findings is that the commit
tee has reported to Coach Floyd
Drown that Brown's presence in the
game might result in a fatality.
The trouble is the result of a blow
on the neck, received in Brown's
Freshmen year, which split one verte
bra and dislodged another. The
wrenched and broken bono has grown
together in a misshapen condition,
and any further injury received about
the neck might cause paralysis, or
death.
Since learning that his former in
jury might cause danger, Brown has
made two trips to San Francisco to
have X-ray photographs of the ver
tebrae taken in the laboratories of the
Medical College. The photographs
were taken from two positions, and
stereoscopic study of them has enabled
the authorities to reach the final de
cision.
Though unable to attend the com
mittee meeting yesterday in person,
Professor Ely submitted a written re
port. Though he stated that in prob
ability Brown could go through a hard
game without injury, a chance blow
could result in any one of a number
of grave misfortunes.
The announcement of Brown's re
tirement from the Varsity squad will
be a disappointment to the bleacher
enthusiasts whp have followed his
game during the early part of the
year.


Buy Brown, '14.
