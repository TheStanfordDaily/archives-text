# PLACE OF DEBATE WILL BE IN SAN FRANCISCO
## CHANGE ALSO MADE IN DATE OF INTERCOLLEGIATE. Committee Decides to Accept Both Propositions Submitted By California Council. 
### 
Both of the propositions submitted
to Stanford for a change of time and
place of the Intercollegiate Debate by
the University of California have been
accepted and the debate will be held
in San Francisco on November 22nd.
The debate was scheduled to be held
here on November 7th, but the prob
ability of larger crowds and greater
enthusiasm for the contest if held in
the city and at a time when interest
would not all be centered in the Big
Game led to the change. This change
of place to San Francisco will apply
to all future debates.
The change was suggested by Cali
fornia's Debating Council and the con
sideration of the question has been
before the Intercollegiate Debate Com
mittee for some time. The executive
committees of the Student Bodies of
both Universities have each given
their consent to the plan and have
allowed the payment of the expense in
curred, which will be borne equally
by the two. The Scottish Rite Temple
has been suggested by California as
the hall in which the debate be held,
and it will probably be secured
for this purpose.
Previous to 1906 the Intercollegiate
Debates were held in San Francisco
and were better attended and were
accompanied with more interest than
when held locally at either of the
universities.
