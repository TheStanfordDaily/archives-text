All of us are prone to display a
willingness to get something for noth
ing. This desire is given expression
in various forms. Some are frowned
upon while others are accepted on
their face value. Speculation is con
sidered legitimate. Gambling is in
disfavor. Is gambling immoral?
Weigh the arguments pro and con
for yourself. As defined on Sunday by
the University Chaplain, gambling is
"the seeking after personal gain
through another's loss, with his con
sent, but making no adequate return."
Inherently man has more or less of
the gambling instinct. It is said that
a little wager adds certain zest to
the game which is not otherwise ob
tainable. But is there needed an in
centive of selfish interest to help a
contestant win an athletic contest?
Unquestionably, gambling is demoral
izing both to the individual and to so
ciety in general. This fact is attested
to by the many statutes making the
placing of wagers on various events
criminal and the disfavor with which
the courts look upon all cases involv
ing bets.
Baseball managers in the large
cities have prohibited betting in their
parks because of the effect it has on
the men who play the game. To hear
the supporters of a team constantly
discussing the probable outcome of
the game in terms of the money it
will bring them has its evil conse
quences. Is a bet necessary to the
enjoyment of the game? Can the
players do justice to themselves and
the team, knowing that there are bets
up which their playing will win or
lose? Think it over.
