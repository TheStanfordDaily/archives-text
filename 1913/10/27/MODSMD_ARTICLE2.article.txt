On Saturday noon Dr. Hall talked to
the men on the training table. Re
fering to training tables in years past
in many of the Eastern colleges and
the way in which they were run he
spoke of the former idea of training
the men on meat alone, while now
vegetables and good wholesome food
have largely supplanted the old idea.
Dr. Hall was formerly a trainer him

Several talks were given at fratern
ity houses including Beta Theta Pi, Phi

afternoon Dr. Hall gave two lectures,
one before the boys of high school age.
and one before women in the Pres

lecture of the series will be given in
the Assembly Hall to men at 8 o'clock
this evening.
