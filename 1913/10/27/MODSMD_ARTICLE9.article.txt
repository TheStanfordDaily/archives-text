# GAMBLING IS SUBJECT OF SERMON BY THE CHAPLAIN
## RELATION TO UNIVERSITY LIFE IS BROUGHT OUT Unprejudiced View Shows Pleasure Decreased Rather Than Increased By the Vice.

"Gambling" was Hie subject of a
very pertinent sermon by the Rev.
D. Charles Gardner in the Memorial
church Sunday. The moral vice of
the practice was shown 011 rational
grounds. He then continued, "How
do these principles apply here?"
"For centuries the English-speak
ing peoples have struggled tio de
velop physical vigor and healthy
mindedness in its sons and daughters
by the habit of physical exercise.
Play and sport have developed in our
civilization a fine type of virtuous,
vigorous manhood and womanhood.
Schools and universities have fostered
this healthy spirit. Our own univers
ity is conspicuous for its spirit of fair
play in athletic contests. In intercol
legiate games, in interscholastic ef
forts for good sport, Stanford's name
is honored.
"Why should we bring into our hap
py, sport-loving university life the
black light of gambling? There is
surely enough fun, enough uncertain
ty, enough excitement in the nature
of a game of football or baseball or
a track meet without adding the un
healthy excitement of a bet.
"It cannot be denied that there is
betting here. But you hear the men
argue that there can be no harm in a
little bet 011 the game. Then answer
this question, 'If a bet can be fair in
your judgment of the play, can you
be just in judging a disputed pointâ€”
will it add any real pleasure to the
game? Does not betting add to the
passion which debases sport?'
"It is a poor sportsman who needs
the incentive of selfish interest to help
him win an athletic contest, and on
the other hand, I know of a track
favorite who lost his points complete
ly because he knew bets of his sup
porter depended upon him and was
depressed by the burden.

"Again, card playing is a common
and very good form of recreation. I
do not think it is spoiled here by
prize giving, but it is often cluttered
by play for money.

"I cannot but associate the spirit
of gambling with cheating at exams.
Cheating is taking a chance. It is the
desire to get something for nothing.

"Plainly then it is your moral duty
to do all in your power to stamp it
out, and thus to keep your sports
cleau, your pleasures harmless, your
social life gracious, and your national
character sound."
