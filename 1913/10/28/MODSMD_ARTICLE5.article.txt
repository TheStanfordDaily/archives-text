# SANTA CLARA DENIES IMPUTED RESENTMENT
## MISSION ATHLETIC DIRECTOR MAKES STATEMENT Neighboring University Appreciates Reason of Stanford for Cancelling Varsity Match. 
### 
Graduate Manager Wilcox, '13, is in
receipt of a letter from Father S. A.
Eline, S. J., director of athletics of the
University of Santa Clara, which is a
fitting reply to the hasty prejudice
shown by some of the morning papers
in their discussion of Stanford-Santa
Clara rugby relations.
The Stanford management regrets
that circumstances make it inadvisible
for the Stanford Varsity to meet Santa
Clara's first team Wednesday, and
then to play the Olympic team 011 the
following Saturday with the California
game only a week distant. Through
out the season the midweek games
have been between the Freshmen or
Second Varsity and visiting teams of
equal rank. The Varsity has been
played only 011 Saturdays.
Manager Wilcox notified Santa Clara
of the difficulty which the scheduled
match caused, and asked that Stan
ford be released to the extent of using
a team composed of seven Varsity
men and eight of the substitute squad.
An additional offer was made that
Santa Clara might use any team she
wished in the game. That arrange
ment has proved satisfactory, and ar
rangements have been completed for
tomorrow's match between the second
teams of both institutions.
No official condemnation of Stan
ford's action has been expressed. Fol
lowing is Father Kline's message,
which is ample proof of the kindly
feeling at the Catholic university:
'Relative to our talks over the
phone yesterday, [ will state that
while we deeply regret the fact that
a meeting with Stanford this year
seems impossible, still we appreciate
to the full your position on the mat
ter and agree with you that your de
cision against playing a hard game
just previous to the California contest
is most probably to the best interests
of rugby in California.
"We are somewhat disappointed in
not having had sufficient time to ar
range a contest to take the place of
the one scheduled with Stanford, but
under the circumstances we do not
hold you culpable.
"I assure you that the already exist
ing good feeling of Santa Clara to
wards Stanford has suffered no dimi
nution as a result of this unfortunate
circumstance."
