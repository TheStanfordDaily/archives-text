# ROADS TO BE PREPARED FOR BIG GAME TRAFFIC
## 
### 
Hoping to reduce traffic congestion
after the Big Game to a minimum and
desiring to safeguard the visiting pub
lic on November Bth, work has been
started on the roads and paths that,
lead from Palo Alto to the university
grounds to the football field. The
most important roadways are to be
fenced in and signed, certain roads
will be blocked, and the main thor
oughfares will be improved and put
in condition for the heavy traffic that
will of necessity pass over a few nar
row avenues before and after tho
game.
