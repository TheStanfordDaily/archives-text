Metropolitan sporting experts comb
ing the field of possibility for a "story"
seized upon the unfortunate circum
stances necessitating the sending of a
second varsity fifteen against the San
la Clara team on Wednesday. Imme
diately the copy paper was covered

with a tirade against the
Stanford and California
coaches for their unwil-

lingness to subject their men to possi
ble injuries 011 the eve of the annual
intercollegiate match between the two
universities. By some accounts the
athletic relationship between Stanford
and Santa Clara was in a very unset
tled state because of the proposal to
pit the second varsity against the for
midable Missionites. This is not true.
In a spirit of fairness to both teams
Santa Clara was notified that it would
lie impossible for Stanford to include
the first varsity players in the line-up
which was to represent the Cardinal
iu the midweek game. Naturally
Santa Clara felt chagrined at not be
ing able to test the ability of its team
with the Varsity. From the stand
point of the coaches it would be dan
gerous to play the men who are the
most likely candidates for the team
which is to meet the Blue and Gold
011 Nevember 8 in a hard game as this
match promised to be. Santa Clara
appreciated the position taken by
Stanford iu this regard. I' ather
Kline, moderator of athletics, mani
fested the fair attitude and sportsman
ship taken by Santa Clara in a letter
sent to Graduate Manager Wilcox.
This hasty and inconsiderate action
011 tlie part of some of the scribes is
decidedly detrimental to the best in
terests of the rugby game in Cali
fornia.
