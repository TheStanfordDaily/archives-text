### 
Six to nothing was the sum of the
Second. Varsity victory over Santa
Clara's second team this afternoon.
The game was a fight from the first
kickoff, the Mission ruggers proving
a close defense in the moments of
last resort.
In the second period open back
field work among the Cardinal players
took on speed, and afforded neat pass
ing runs that were almost absent from
the earlier part of the game.
The forwards of both lines followed
the ball with a will and proved for
midable both in offense and defense.
Until the last twelve minutes of the
game, the score board showed zeros.
Sudden speeding up of the Cardinal for
wards and back overcame all opposi-
I tion, and shot the two trys over.
After Patterson's kickoff for the
Second Varsity, the Cardinal backs to'ik
early opportunity to run the ball to
Santa Clara's limit. The Mission plav
ers forced out ot' danger as a result
of Davidson's touch in goal, and
Schultz and Hardy, half and wing, re
spectively, carried the play to the
home twenty yard line.
During the next twelve minutes, the
forwards struggled well inside Santa
Clara's danger zone. Soto's kicking
from the right wing oL' the visitors
gave Santa Clara occasional spurt»
across center field. The first pretty
back lield combination of the game
was a passing run from the Santa.
Clara forty between Davidson, Brad
en, Fyfe and Halm. Hardy covered
the Hall and saved for the Catholic
team.
Hardy opened the half for the Saa
ta Clarans, who followed the ball
downfield to Stanford's twenty yard
mark. Taking an intercepted pass,
Patterson ran to center, where he lost
the ball on being tackled by Carber
ry. Wynne advanced five yards more,
before Santa Clara secured and found
touch on their forty. Tilton, Patter
son, Halm and Davidson opened a sec
ond neat passing burst, which was
checked on the visitors' fifteen yard
line by a clean tackle.
Tilton passed to Davidson from a
five yard scrum for the first try of the
match. Davidson missed conversion.
The scoring was preceded by a daz
ing series of line bucks and clever
passing by the Cardinal backs in the
face of desperate defense.
The Tilton-Davidson coinbinatior
again scored from a scrum 011 the
five yard line. Just before the try
Patterson passed to Halm for a spec
tacular run and dive.
