# Football Show Tickets Sold Monday.
## 
### 
' Wooing Wohlma," is a name well
adapted to the Ram's Head produc
tion of this year as there are few in
the cast who do not try for her hand.
The play will be the football show,
and will be staged for the benefit of
our visitors from across the bay.
Tickets will be on sale Monday
morning at the Bookstore and also
at Weingartner's drug store in Palo
Alto. Drawing will take place at S
o'clock.
