Six hundred California students
have been vaccinated as a preventative
against typhoid fever since the open
ing of the university. An average of
one hundred and fifty are being treat
ed each day. The members of the
faculty and their families are being
treated without charge.
An innovation in athletic competi
tion was tried out yesterday when an
interclub track meet was staged on
the varsity oval. One hundred men
entered the meet. The events are to
be finished on Thursday.
