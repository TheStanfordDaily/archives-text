tween thirty and forty men are train
ing three times a week, on Mondays,

both of whom placed in the run last
November.
The course and length of the race
has not been decided as yet. Last
year the runners competed over a
four and one-half mile distance. They
started from the track oval thirty
odd strong, ran down the palm drive
to the county road to Mayfield, turn
ing to the left up the county road,
past the row and finishing in front
of the bleachers, after covering a
lap on the track.
For the first time class numerals
will be granted this year to the first
seven contestants to cross the finish.

Committee several weeks ago to the
effect that the first seven to finish
would receive class numerals, pro
viding fifteen men enter the cross
country race. From present indica
tions this requirement will be fulfilled
and the only thing which remains to
be done is for the classes to award the
sweaters after the race is run.
