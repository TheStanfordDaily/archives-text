# RILES OF YEAR AGO TO GOVERN THE PLUG UGLY
## POSTERS CANNOT BE TORY UP WHEN ONCE DOWN Seniors and Juniors Will Have Annual Combat Around the Inner Quad. 
### 
Junior will fight Senior tomorrow.
The first annual upperclass rush will
probably occur some time tonight,
when the third year men lay tlieir
posters about on the campus. The
big fight for the possession of the
Inner Quad will take place tomorrow
night immediately after the Plug Ugly
show at the Oval.
The rules for the combat, will be
the same as those drawn up last
year by the University Conference
and a committee from the rival class
es. The rush will begin on the steps
of the general library. The Juniors,
unmolested, will then circle the Outer
Quad by the English building, thence
to the Law building, while the Seniors
pass through the Memorial Court.
Around the arcades of the Inner
Quad the fight will take place and
will terminate at the East arch, where
the fourth year men will mass. This
plan places the annual Plug Ugly fight
on the same footing as those of earlier
years. The rules follow:
1. It shall be permissable for Sen
iors to oppose bringing of Junior
posters on the campus, but said post
ers once laid shall not be removed".
2. There shall be no rough-hous
ing of the show. The Juniors shall
be allowed to produce the burlesque
without such continued interruption
as will make it impossible for the
audience to hear the lines. Any act
which tends to make the production
of the show impossible, snob as steal
ing scenery, kidnapping, etc., is con
sidered objectionable.
The Plug Ugly rush shall be
started on the steps directly in front
of the general library. From there
the Juniors will then circle the Outer
Quad by the English building to the
Law building unopposed. Here a
fight for the possession of the Inner
Quad will ensue, terminating In the
East arch.
