# ROOTERS ROUT RUGGERS
## 
### 
There is ample evidence that the
fearsome sounds of an approaching
rally in front of the training house
last night precipitated a confused
scramble of Varsity warriors for the
back door. The easiest conclusions
available are that the strong hearts
of the turf are addicted with a misera
ble lot of stage fright.
The loyal throng of rally makers
massed itself ten deep before the Phi
Delta Theta house and burst the even
ing quiet with calls for Captain ".Jim
my" Thoburn and others of the squad
to appear. Lights in the dining room
were suddenly dimmed, and a pene
trating silence issued from within.
Chug-chuggings in the distance wafted
a message that the doughty ruggers
had trusted themselves to the dangers
of a joy ride rather than mount the
speakers' rostrum 011 the front porch.
