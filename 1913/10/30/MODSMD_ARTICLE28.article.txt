# INSTRUCTOR DE HAAS SPEAKS BEFORE FRESHMAN DEBATERS
## Attributes General Rise in Prices to Increased Cost of High Living. 
### 
"The American people are not com
plaining about the high cost of living,
but the cost of high living," said In
structor J. A.de Haas last evening in
his address before the Freshman De
bating society. He added that accord
ing to the report of the Bureau of La
bor, the purchasing price of money
has decreased fifty per cent in the last
ten years, but the decrease in the
future will be less, in proportion to
the increase of gold production.
The regular debate of the evening
followed his address. The question
was, "Resolved, That present high
prices are chiefly due to increase of
gold production." W. E. Licking and
R. H. Bickel upheld the affirmative
side of the question, while W. I.
Ames and M. E. Tedford constituted
the negative team. The judges decid
ed in favor of the affirmative.
The question box will be opened
at the regular meeting of the society
next Wednesday evening, and subjects
will be assigned for the rest of the
yea?.
