# RAM'S HEAD SOCIETY TO STAGE HAWAIIAN PLAY
## "WOOING WOHLMA" TO BE THE FOOTBALL SHOW Best Female Impersonators at Stanford to Take Part In the Production. 
### 
The scene of "Wooing Wohlma" the
Ram's Head production for the night
of the football game, is laid in Hawaii.
The center of attraction throughout
the whole play in Wohlma, daughter
of the Hawaiian Chief, whose part is
taken by J. R. Morgan, '10. She is
wooed by practically the entire cast,
either for her wealth or for her
charms.
The custom of each year sacrificing
to the God of Peli one of the fairest
maidens of the island realm threatens
at any moment to introduce a note or'
tragedy. The events which fill the
day preceding the night of the festival
of Peli occupy the whole of the first
act. The second act covers the night
of the festival. At the beginning of
the first act the arrival of the Ameri
can party on the yacht "Yankee," of
Mr. Applewhite, the millionaire,
brings joy to most of the natives, but
is proclaimed an ill omen by the witch
Kahuna.
In preventing the condemning lot of
the God of Peli befalling Wohlma, and
in selecting the future prince, are
brought about many clever situations
which afford great opportunity for the
introduction of comedy, pathos and
love.
In her opposition to the white men,
old Kahuna is aided by the negro
mate of the yacht, and together they
plan to capture the most dangerous
of the Americans. By mistake the
son of the millionaire is kidnapped by
brigands, and a magic spell cast over
him by Kahuna, rendering him invis
ible.
