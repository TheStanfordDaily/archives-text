# MADAME FRANCES ALDA PLEASES MUSIC LOVERS
## 
### 
Madame Frances Alda, the Metro
politan soprano, charmed a throng of
Palo Alto and campus music lovers
at the Assembly Hall last night in the
first concert of the Peninsula Musical
Association of the season. A beautiful
and easy range of voice made Madame
Alda's happily chosen selections very
acceptable. The audience was quick
to respond to the singer's art. and ac
knowledged its appreciation with un
stinted applause.
Gutia Casini, violoncellist, and
Frank La Forge, pianist, scored great
favor both in accompaniment and solo
work. All three of the entertainers
were generous with encores. Perhaps
the most spontaneous pleasure shown
was caused by the rendition of "Love
Tales From Hoffman," by Madame
Alda, Sgr. Casini and La Forge as an
encore. The choice of selections was
excellent, and the performance bore
a high artistic stamp.
