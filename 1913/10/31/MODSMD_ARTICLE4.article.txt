# VARSITY MEETS OLYMPICS IN FINAL CLASH TOMORROW
## Strong Cardinal Combination Is Entered in Last Preliminary Game of the Rugby Season. 
### 
Dope sheet compilers, rugby ex
perts, and rooters will have their final
opportunity to "size up" the Stanford
Varsity in action tomorrow afternoon
against the Winged "O" fifteen. At
3:30 the Cardinal players will line up
for the linal match of the preliminary
season, before meeting California ou
Stanford Field November S.
The largest press box attendance of
the season may be expected, and the
place of several men on the Intercol
legiate team may result from the show
ing made. With three exceptions the
Stanford personnel is the same that
outscored the Barbarians last Sat
urday. Most of the men who meet
the Olympics tomorrow have opposed
them twice before this season. The
first visit, of the clubmen to the cam
pus was the initial match of the sea
son. in which they carried away a
five to three victory. The Varsity
took the heavy end of a 29-3 score
from their opponents in the second
game, on October 11.
Tomorrow's exhibition may be con
sidered the crucial test of the season
for the members oi', the Varsity squad,
and the Cardinal representatives as
a whole. The team will receive its
ultimate fighting edge, and practic
ally all the substitutes named by the
coaches will get in the game for a
part of the period.
For the first time. ITelmus Andrews
will (. say tho Varsity fullback's po
sition from tho first whistle. He
first played on the last line of de
fense last week in the Second Vars

ity-Insurrectos match, and later re
lieved Tilton at fullback on the Vars
ity during the last minutes. Since
vacating his old position at center
three Andrews has kicked the ball
and tackled to advantage.
Pettingill will again be seen in tho
middle rank after his long absence
The other change from last week's
personnel is in the case of Lachmund.
who will resume his work at second
five eighths.
The Olympic club team will be a
good combination to give Stanford a
final seasoning. The match prom
ises to be the speediest attraction
that has so far been offered on the
schedule.
