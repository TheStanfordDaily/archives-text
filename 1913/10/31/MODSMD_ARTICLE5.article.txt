# ENGINEERS PLAN ASSEMBLIES
## 
### 
The Engineering societies of the uni
versity have cooperated to inaugurate
this semester a series of engineering
assemblies to start next week.
Its the intention of the four Engi
n i ring societies, under the new plan,
to secure speakers who are authori
ties on their particular subject and
who will give talks of general interest
to the Engineering students. As an
indication of their enthusiasm for this
plan, the faculties of the Engineering
departments have agreed to excuse all
classes in the session on such occa
sions. All upper- and underclassmen

in engineering and faculties of the
departments, and any of the general
public who may be interested, are cor
dially invited to attend the lectures.
The committee in charge of these
assemblies has secured as the initial
speaker M. M. O'Shaughnessy, city en
gineer of San Francisco, and one of
the foremost authorities on water sup
ply engineering of the West. His sub
ject will be the Hetch-Hetcliy water
supply lor San Francisco, a question
of vital importance to all engineers.
He will speak next week, at a time
and place to be announced later.
