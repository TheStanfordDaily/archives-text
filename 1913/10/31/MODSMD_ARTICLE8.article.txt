# VENETIAN MOSAIC ARTIST BEGINS WORK ON CHURCH
## RESTORATION WILL CONSUME OVER THREE YEARS Lorenzo Zampato, Original Designer, Will Reconstruct All of Former Decorations. 
### 
Signor Lorenzo Zampato has ar
rived from Venice to take up the
work of restoration of the famous
Memorial Church mosaics. Zampato
is the artist of the original mosaics,
having spent four and a half years
on the work. He had left but three
months when the church was practic
ally destroyed by the earthquake. The
Italian artist now returns to take up
the work anew, and will be engaged
in it for at least three years.
It is planned to follow the former
designs with but few exceptions,
where slight changes will increase
the beauty. In most places the walls
have been completely cleaned of the
former mosaic preparatory to entirely
new work, but in two instances the
old mosaic was so little damaged that
repairs with pieces from the destroy
ed mosaic will be made by Zampato.
The facade and the mosaic wall be
neath the choir loft can thus be re
perfected by the artist.
The new mosaic will be sent in sec
tions from the makers in Venice, Dr.
-V Salviati Company, of whom Signor
Zampato is a representative. These
sections will come in small blocks
with numbers by which they may be
laid in their proper positions. It Is
the work of Zampato to work out the
minutely perfect specifications on
which the mosaics will fe formed in
Venice, to prepare the walls with the
peculiar brick-like receptive material,
then to place the numbered pieces of
mosaics as he had planned them.
The work of restoration begins
with the vestibule, then the apse,
where the famous Hymn of the Se
raphs, one of the most beautiful por
tions, will receive attention. This
work will consume five or six months.
During the favorable weather of the
summer months the great scene of the
Sermon on the Mount of the front
facade will be restored. Beyond this
Zampato has not definitely ordered
his plans, but fully three years will
be required for the completion of the
extensive mosaics.
