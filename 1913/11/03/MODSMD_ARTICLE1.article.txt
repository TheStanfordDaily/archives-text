# MANY CALIFORNIANS TO ATTEND SENIOR LUNCHEON
## 200 WILL BE GUESTS OF 1914 CLASS AT STANFORD Committee Arranges to Serve Visitors From 11:30 to 1:00 on November Eighth. 
### 
At least two hundred men and wom
en of the Senior class of the Univers
ity of California will be extended hos
pitality by the Stanford Seniors on
the day of the Intercollegiate game.
E. L. Shirrell, the California Senior
President, has advised President P. B.
McKee, '14, that this number may be
expected at the luncheon which the
Stanford graduating class will tender
the California Seniors on Nevember
eighth. Slightly over this number of
tickets for the luncheon will at once
be mailed to California by the com
mittee in charge. The tickets are
used in order to avoid the presence
of' uninvited guests at this expression
of intercollegiate amity.
It is hoped that both the men's and
women's luncheons may be served in
the Stanford Inn, separate rooms be
ing used for the two. Final sanction
for the use of the Inn, however, has
not as yet been obtained. If the Inn
is obtained it will be decorated, and
a sign will be placed on the outside
notifying the Californians that it is
the place of the luncheon. The Cali
fornia guests will be greeted at the
luncheon by a committee of Stanford
Seniors to be appointed. The men's
committee has arranged to have a cat
erer serve a hot lunch between the
hours of 11:30 and 1 o'clock.
Other luncheons for the California
students as well as the alumni of
both universities will be served in
fraternity and sorority houses and
private homes. The Stanford band
will entertain the California band at
lunch in the band room.
