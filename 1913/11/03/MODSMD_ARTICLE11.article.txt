# PARKING OF AUTOMOBILES AT BIG GAME ARRANGED
## SPECIAL TRAIN SERVICE FROM CITY IS PLANNED Southern Pacific Enlarges Schedule to Accommodate Big Game Crowds From San Francisco. 
### 
Detailed plans are being made for
the parking of the large number of
automobiles which are expected to
crowd the grounds around the football
field on November S. All motor vehi
cles will be directed to come through
the arboretum via the main automobile
highway, and egress will be had on
the Embarcadero Road, thus avoiding
the congestion of traffic which would
arise from the use of the one thor
oughfare only. The machines are to
be lined up in orderly rows, the posi
tion of which will be plainly indicated
when the automobilists reach the cam
pus.
It is expected that a temporary gar
age will be erected near the field, un
der the supervision of one of the lead
ing Palo Alto shops. Gasoline and
other supplies will be sold, and facili
ties for making simple repairs will
contribute to the convenience of those
who motor down for the Big Game.
The Southern Pacific Company has
agreed to run twelve special trains
from San Francisco to Palo Alto on
the day of the Big Game to accommo
date the large crowds which will come
to the campus. The first train will
leave the city at 10 o'clock, and the
remaining eleven will depart as soon
as they are filled. The round trip fare
from Berkeley has been fixed at $1.05,
and from San Francisco at $1.00. Ne
gotiations are also under way to se
cure special train service from all
points south of the campus.
The California rugby squad will
come in a special car, which will be
run on the siding at Menlo, allowing
them time to eat lunch before coming
to Palo Alto.
