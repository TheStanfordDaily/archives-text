The action of the Student Council
regarding the Junior poster was
merely an incident of Student Con
trol. Responsibility had to be placed
somewhere. Yet it is hard for some
of us to look upon the position of the
individual students who were sus
pended as anything more than a mis
fortune; for back of it all they were
not really to blame. This year's Plug
Ugly as a whole was largely the result
of a demand on the part of the stud
ents t'or something that could not be
labeled tame. The Student Body it
self is to blame.
Under such circumstances, many of
us seriously question the advisability
of continuing the Plug Ugly. As a
Junior-Senior scrap the time for stag
ing it, just a few days before the Big
Game, when everyone is pulling for
a strong school spirit, is certainly the
most illogical one that could be se
lected.
Yet, alter all, there is really no
place in the life of the University for
a contest between the two upper
classes. Can we say that any rivalry
whatever exists between them? Cer
tainly, whatever is produced at this
time is forced. To a transfer from
Harvard or Cornell it savors of prep
school days.
Anyone who has seen the evolution
of the affair during the past four or
five years realizes that it cannot be
regulated in its present form.
As an opportunity to "pull off some
rough stuff" it certainly is the climax
of the whole college year. Yet would
it not be better for us fellows to do
such things among ourselves, if there
is any need for our doing it, rather
than make a public affair of it and
thus disgrace the university in the
eyes of the surrounding communities?
Why should we make it a class or
university affair, and thus require the
women of the university to feel under
obligation to witness that which not
a single one of us would take his sis
ter to see?
The whole affair is out of place ex
cept as a means of initiating the Jun
iors' headgear, which is at present too
heavy to wear. Why should we not
adopt a plan similar to that in vogue
in a certain other university, where
the Juniors all appear on a certain
morning wearing their plugs to class?
They could then be battered up, and
worn for the rest of the year.
