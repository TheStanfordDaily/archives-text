The Vocational Opportunities club
was organized two years ago under
the auspices of the association of Col
legiate Alumnae as a means of bring
ing before college women a knowledge
of the demand for trained workers in
lines other than teaching; the prepa
ration required and the compensation
offered.
This year the club will hold month
ly meetings, at which various persons
who have succeeded in different lines
will speak. An opportunity will be
given at each meeting for an informal
discussion on the topic taken up. The
public is cordially invited to these
meetings.
