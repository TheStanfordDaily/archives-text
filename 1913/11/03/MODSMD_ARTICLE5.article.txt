# VARSITY TRIMS WINGED "0" PRELIMINARY SEASON OVER
## Contest on Wet Turf Affords Pleasing Featuresâ€”Varsity Receives Last Fighting Edge. 
### 
The last rugby match of the pre
liminary season, and one of the best
that has been seen at Stanford this
year, resulted in a 19-12 score, with
the Varsity on the heavy end. The
game took on speed from the first,
and was remarkably open. Dribbling
rushes by both sets of forwards were
effective, and the ball was carried
in many pretty passing runs by the
backfield men.
No better opponents than the Wing
ed "O'' ruggers could have been chos
en to whet the skill of the Stanford
Varsity to its final fighting edge. The
match was of great value to the play
ers, and put the forwards and backs
in almost perfect working narmony.
The wet turf made it somewhat dif
ficult for the men to get started, and
made the kicking mediocre. However,
a fast contest was furnished, and only
an occasional failure of cleats to
catch a grip marred the play.
The appearance of Captain Tho
burn in Reeves' place at left wing
during the last fifteen minutes of play
was a surprise to the spectators, who
had not expected to see "Jimmy" in
fighting togs again this year.
From the time of Darsie's kickoff
for Stanford, the teams went nip and
tuck during the first period, with the
Olympics a shade more effective than
the Varsity, in the start. Hemming
the ball in at the ten yard line, the
visitors forwards dribbled across the
line, and Knowles, second five, cov
ered for a try. M. Forbes failed to
convert. Score, 3-0.

Reeves again gave Stanford the
lead soon after. Reeves fell on the
ball after it had been sent over by a
dribbling rush from the forty-five
yard line. Austin added two points
by conversion. Score, 5-3.
The Stanford backs took the ball
after the kickoff, executed a rare pass
ing run, which resulted in a short
kick downfield by Lachmund. From
the five yard scrum that followed,
Erb secured, and passed to Reeves,
who gave the ball to Austin for a
head on run and a try. Darsie failed
conversion. Score, 8-3.
The Olympics went down the field
in successive rushes and brought the
ball to a ten yard scrum. M. Forbes
forced through the defense for a try,
and S. Forbes' kick failed to find
place. Score, S-6.
M. Forbes scored another try from
a five yard scrum and S. Forbes failed
to convert. Score, S-9.
M. Forbes concluded the first half's
scoring by placing a penalty kick
over the bar from the thirty yard line.
Total score for the half, S-12, for the
Olympics.
Erb, Austin, Lachmund, Carroll and
Reeves carried the ball into Olympic
territory from the Stanford forty,
when Reeves short kick gave the op
ponents the ball. Afterward, Urban
intercepted a kick on the 20 yard line,
and registered a neat try. Darsie
failed. Score, 11-12.
Austin worked the fake pass to ad
vantage, allowing Hall to score the
