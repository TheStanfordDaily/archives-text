# SATISFACTORY ENDING; BOTH SIDES CLAIM WIN.
## 
### 
Ending in a most satisfactory man
ner, both Seniors and Juniors consid
ering themselves the winners, the an
nual Plug Ugly came to a close on
Friday evening.
The one-act show given by the Jun
iors was tended to a large audience at
the track. Immediately following the
performance the customary rush was
held on the steps of the Library. The
men of 191 rÂ» gained the Quad, and after
a short and fierce struggle fought their
way through the East arch.
