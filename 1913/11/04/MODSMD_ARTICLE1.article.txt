# FORMER ALL-AMERICAN BACK GIVES RELATIVE MERITS OF TWO TEAMS
## 
### 
Franklin B. Morse, Princeton, '95,
who was halfback on the champion
ship Princeton team in 1593, and Ail-
American halfback of 1593 and 1894,
and who is at present with the San
Francisco Post, was on the campus
today on the "Big Game" story. Morse
has taken an unbiased view of the
football situation and lias written a
short review at the solicitation of
"The Daily Palo Alto." His article
follows:
"While California is being made a
slight favorite in the betting, based,
as far as I am able to determine, al
most entirely on the showings made
by the Cardinal and the Blue and Gold
against the New Zealanders, when it
comes down to the cold calculations
of the non-partizan bettor, it is found
that the margin of difference as to
the relative merits of the two teams
is not particularly appreciable.
"There can be but little doubt that
the students of California are basing
their calculations on the New Zealand
games, and it would appear that the
public, in the majority of instances,
in making California the favorite, is
simply falling in line and taking the
most tangible argument that comes
to hand. As a matter of fact the
bettor who is taking chances with
his money purely on the New Zealand
scores made against California and
Stanford is liable to have all his dope
knocked sky high. The foreigners
have admitted that they are far faster
on sod than they are on dirt, in fact
many of them never before played on
a dirt field, so that it would seem to
me that the very method of compari
son now being generally used in siz
ing up the two teams is about the
most, uncertain and unsatisfactory
that could he selected.
A wet field on Saturday will put
awry the most carefully studied dope.
In all my experience in football, I do
not know of any one element that will
more upset calculations than water.
I am inclined to the belief that this
condition will favor Stanford more
than it will California, for the reason
that, the Berkeleyans are used to the
solid footing which comes of a shoe
implanted firmly in soil. Stanford is
used to the faster footing.
