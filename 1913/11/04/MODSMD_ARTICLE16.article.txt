# Prolonged Cheering
## 
### 
No more sensible request could have
been made than that the rugby enthu
siasts place a limit upon the time they
cheer for the men of the Varsity team
and the speakers at the final send-off
to the fifteen on Thursday

evening. There will be
ample opportunity allowed
for the supporters of the

team to give proof of the confidence
which they have placed in the men
chosen to represent the Cardinal on
Saturday. A stop-watch used for the
purpose of continuing the outbursts of
enthusiasm long enough to establish
a new cheering record is a poor indi
cator of the true interest the Student
Body has in the team. Prolonged ap
plause and niose tends to put the play
ers in a nervous state, which is not
beneficial at this stage of the season.
Watch the yell leader's signals.
