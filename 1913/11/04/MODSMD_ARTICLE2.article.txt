# WOMEN'S PRESS CLUB TO STAGE PLAY AT VARSITY
## 
### 
Under the direction of the Women's
Press Club, an entertainment is to be
given at the Varsity theater on the
evening of November 14. A play by
college talent will be the chief attrac
tion, but the regular program of the
Varsity theater, consisting of motion
pictures, will be given between the
acts.
The proceeds are to be divided, one
third going to the theater and the re
mainder to the Press Club, which will
donate its share to the Women's Club
house.
