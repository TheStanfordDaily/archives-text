# BALL LOST IN THE MUD BUT ALL-BLACKS GET 33
## YEAR-OLD MEMORIES REVIVED BY GAME IN SLUSH. California Second Team Blanked by New Zealanders In Slow Battle Yesterday. 
### 
A field of soft, sticky mud, sur
rounded by bleachers, white-lined
with lime, and with drainage ditches
that marked the touch lines, was the
scene of the third rugby game of the
All Blacks with the California Var
sity yesterday. Two thirty minute
sessions in the mud gave the black
jerseyed experts a total of thirty
three points, while the California men
did not threaten their opponents' goal.
Yesterday's contest should not be
classccl as a game, for the heavy field
made speed an impossibility, and the
play became a long and tiresome ser
ies of scrums and lineouts in Cali
fornia territory. None of the tries
were converted, in fact no effort was
made to boot the heavy lump of black
mud that concealed the pigskin. At
one point in the first half the ball was
actually driven out of sight in the
ground by the trampling forwards,
and a pause of almost a minute en
sued while Referee Hill recovered the
sphere.
Coach Schaeffer sent a second team
into the game, using only players
whose work had not developed to the
satisfaction of the coaches. The Var
sity squad, including the fifteen play
ers who seem certain of their position
for Saturday, huddled in blankets in
the bleachers opposite the rooting
section, and watched the mudfest
through the first half.
Captain McDonald, of the All
Blacks was the scoring player in four
of the tries, the skipper seeming to
navigate the sea of mud much more
readily than did his compatriots.
Roberts and Lynch were often in evi
dence back of the scrum, while the
forwards soon were so well plastered
with sticky Mother Earth that, recog
nition from any distance was impossi
ble.
