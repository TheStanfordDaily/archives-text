# STANFORD WILL GREET THE VARSITY THURSDAY
## WELCOME TO BE MADE AT FOOTBALL BALLY. Abbreviated Cheering Is Urged for Good of Team. Alumni Will Speak. 
### 
The Student Body will welcome the
1913 Varsity team in the Assembly
Hall Thursday evening at 7:30, in the
annual football rally. For twenty
minutes before the rally commences
the Row will be lighted with the flare
of red lire, set in front of the houses.
Tomorrow the list of speakers will
be announced. Yell Leader Don Cass,
'14, is in communication with a num
ber of alumni who have been closely
connected with Stanford athletic his
tory. He has not yet received an
swers from all.
One departure to be sought is an
abbreviation of the time spent in con
certed cheering. The cheers that
greet the Varsity men when they take
their seats and those given the speak
ers are desired to be short. The past
practice of continuing the applause
for ten and fifteen minutes is a strain
on the players and speakers, and must
be avoided in the interests of the team.
All members of the audience are ask
ed to observe the yell leader's motions
for silence.
A request is also made that no one
climb on the backs of the chairs in the
Assembly Hall in order to get a better
view of the stage. The breakage and
other damage done has been a consid
erable item of expense.
Custom prescribes that the men will
serpentine through the arcades and
walks of the Inner Quad, in the lights
and shadows of colored fire, at the end
of the indoor ceremonies. At the con
clusion of the serpentine the Fresh
men bonfire will be lighted on Enciua
field. There the skipping in ranks of
four will be resumed.
