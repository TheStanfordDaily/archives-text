# FIRST-HAND NEWS FROM MEXICAN BATTLEFIELDS
## PECKHAM, â€™11, LATEST ARRIVAL FROM LAND OF STRIFE. Describes Wretched Conditions In Mexico, Arms From States Would End War. 
### 
A. 13. Peckham, '11, who has just
returned from the strife in Mexico,
reports some interesting information
obtained at first hand on the actual
war condition in the disturbed repub
lic. Peckham was in the employ of an
American mining corporation operat
ing the Minas Del Tajo mines in Sina
loa State, Mexico.
The political situation is in its pres
ent unsettled condition due largely
to the action of Huerta in deposing all
the officers appointed under Madero.
This sweeping removal, which Includ
es all officers from state governors to
pound masters, has angered the
masses of peoples throughout the
towns and cities of Mexico. Much of
the fighting, says Peckham, has been
in the nature of guerilla warfare, with
the attendant cruelty and barbarity.
The narrator witnessed such acts as
the throwing of wounded men from
the tops of buildings to the ground
below.
He tells of an incident which took
place in Resario, where he was sta
tioned. The Relels were in possess
ion of the town, and on hearing that
the Federals were advancing to be
siege it, they marched out to meet the
army. The armies passed each other
without being aware of the fact, con
sequently the Federals took the town.
When the Rebels found that their
plans had miscarried they immediately
came back to Resario on the dead run
and attacked the town at eight o'clock
in the evening. The Federals fought
from the tops of the flat adobe build
ings for some time, but were finally
driven from their posts, and the fight
ing continued in the streets at very
close quarters. So close in fact that
hand bombs were used.
The fighting ceased at 12 o'clock
the next day, with the Rebels in pos
session. They immediately commenced
to kill the wounded.
While the fighting was going on
Peckham was calling on one of the
senoritas, sister of a captain of a Fed
eral company. When he went to his
quarters after the battle he found this
officer in his bunk. He was shot
through the lungs by a soft-nosed
Mauser bullet. The senor's mother
and sister soon arrived and sent a
boy to the Rebel colonel asking him
to come to the bunk house. The col
onel was asked to keep the matter
quiet and help save the Federal cap
tain. He promised to do this. Two
days later the Rebel soldiers found
the man and told their commander
that if he was not immediately turned
over they would kill him. The wound
ed officer was turned over. The sol
diers broke into the bunk house, drag
ged him from his bed without giving
heed to the cries of his mother and
sister. They then marched him through
the streets until he fell exhausted and
then shot him until he was unrecog
nizable. These scenes are of daily
occurrence, and show the entire lack
of authority in our sister republic.
Peckham further states that if arms
and ammunition were sent into Mexico
by the United States the revolution
would be over in two months. Car
ranza, who is leader of the constitu
tionalists, would be elected president,
and it would be very probable that the
fighting would be brought to an end.
