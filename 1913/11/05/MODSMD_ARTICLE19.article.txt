# CALIFORNIA CRITICIZES ATTITUDE TOWARD RUGBY
## 
### 
'"Brass Tacks," the magazine of cur
rent comment published at the Uni
versity of California by the League of
the Republic, contains in its last issue
a plea for clean rugby sportsmanship.
The article is in the form of a commu
nication from the pen of W. W. Beatty,
'13, a contributing editor of the maga
zine. The letter follows:
Honor at Stake.
(.By W. W. Beatty, '13.)
"Saturday's game was brought home
to California in such a manner that
it can't be dodged, the fact that thero
is something wrong in our attitude
towards football.
"We of the bleachers have discover
ed that together with what else we
could learn from New Zealand, we
still needed to learn the courtesies of
the game.
"The New Zealand team, which
waited for a winded Californian who
had played hard but useless ball after
the whistle had blown, to regain his
condition, never learned that courtesy
from California. And the California
team which ran off the field at the end
of the game, not even waiting for the
last conversion, never learned its
courtesy from New Zealand. Count
less other instances of where our dut
ies as hosts were ignored as though
we were playing on a hostile field
against enemies, could be cited. Is it
any wonder that our opponents learn
to dislike us?
"Our bleachers also learned that
three points, secured by trickery,
scarcely compensate for fifteen points
lost while putting up a bluff.
"California will have to learn to
play straight football. California will
have to learn that to play straight
football, the 'anything to beat Stan
ford' attitude must be dropped. This
lesson must be taken, not from the
New Zealand game only, but from
every other game played on California
field. Our present attitude is wrong.
Down at its basis comes the fault
which the student body as a whole is
guilty of—the demand for a coach and
a style of play which will beat Stan
ford, regardless of the reputation it
begets us.
"Our coach has yielded to that de
mand—he has for four years given up
a team which ranks with or above that
of our Cardinal rivals, but to do it lie
has made us the most heartily disliked
institution on the coast. The attitude
assumed toward us by the members of
the California Rugby Union is clear
proof of this. Today, California rules
in the realm of sport purely by right
of might, not by courtesy, fair treat
ment, or friendship.
"It is high time that this attitude
was changed."
