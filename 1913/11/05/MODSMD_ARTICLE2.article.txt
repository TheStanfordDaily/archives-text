# VOLUNTEERS ARE NEEDED TO PUT STRAW ON TURF.
## 
### 
Three hundred bales of straw will
form a blanket six inches deep to
keep the turf dry in case there is rain
fall before Saturday. Two hundred
men will he needed at the football
liebl tomorrow to help spread the
straw, and they are requested to re
port at any possible time during the
day. Saturday at 12:15 at least two
hundred men will be needed to clear
the field before the gates open at
12:30.
Manager Wilcox has enough straw
on the field this afternoon to keep
a squad of volunteers busy. A car
load lot has been ordered from the
city, to till out the amount obtained
in Palo Alto.
The straw will be scattered as loose
ly as possible, and will be sufficient
to absorb a reasonably heavy rain.
