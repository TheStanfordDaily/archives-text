# O'SHAUGHNESSY TALKS ON THE HETCH-HETCHY
## 
### 
M. M. O'Shaughnessy, City Engineer
of San Francisco, pointed out the
many advantages of the Hetch-Hetchy
water supply for San Francisco in an
interesting address at the Chapel yes
terday afternoon in the lirst Engineer
ing assembly of the semester.
His remarks in part were as fol
lows:
"No other project in the United
States lias been more talked of in the
last ten years than the Hetch-Hetchy
question.
"One of the greatest antagonists of
San Francisco in regard to the Hetch-
Hetchy supply was the Spring Valley
Water Works.
"Other antagonists are the nature
lovers. The East thinks that San
Francisco intends taking the Yosemite
Valley for their water supply. But
Hetch-Hetchy is thirty miles north of
Yosemite, and the construction of a
dam and the creation of a lake there
would add to the scenic beauty of the
valley.
"The available water sites in Cali
fornia are very rare. Few offer the
facility for dam building that is af
forded by the Tuolumne River region.
This river occupies a water-shed of
about 1500 square miles.
"Until 1908 the Hetch-Hetchy ques
tion was buried. San Francisco had
the water lights-, but the Schmitz-Ruef
administration let them alone. Now,
San Francisco has one of the best mu
nicipal governments in the United
States, and the women's votes will
still further assure the predominence
of the best in politics.
"In the permit granted to San Fran
cisco by Secretary Garfield, it was
urged that Lake Eleanor should lirst
be developed to its utmost capacity
before touching Hetch-Hetchy. Sec
retary Ballinger succeeded Garfield
and lie appointed an army-board to in
vestigate California conditions and
make him a report at Washington.
Every competing water proposition
was presented to the board, and they
reported to tlie Secretary of the In
terior that the Hetch-Hetchy was the
safest and most available source of
water supply for San Francisco. In
spite of the army-board's favorable
report the conclusion was withheld.
"John R. Freeman, of New York,
was appointed to supervise the report
and make a linal one to the Secretary
of the interior. After a year's study,
Freeman changed Grunsky's original
plan to a gravity proposition, which
called for the delivery of water to
San Francisco within 300 feet of the
city limits.
"The Yosemite River Co., of which
John Hays Hammond, of New York, is
the head, made various findings in
Lake Eleanor, where San Francisco
had permanent rights, and the city
had to pay the company $1,300,000 to
give up the locality.
"The nature lovers were very much
opposed to the Hetch-Hetchy propo
sition. The farmers of the San Joa
quin Valley claimed in a hearing be
fore the senate the other day that
their interests were being jeopardized
by granting San Francisco this per
mit.
"The Sacramento River site pos
sesses merit, but the slough water is
not good enough for San Francisco.
San Francisco wants the Hetch-
Hetchy, and will eventually probably
land it."

Lake Eleanor, where San Francisco
had permanent rights, and the city
had to pay the company $1,300,000 to
give up the locality.
"The nature lovers were very much
opposed to the Hetch-Hetchy propo
sition. The farmers of the San Joa
quin Valley claimed in a hearing be
fore the senate the other day that
their interests were being jeopardized
by granting San Francisco this per
mit.
"The Sacramento River site pos
sesses merit, but the slough water is
not good enough for San Francisco.
San Francisco wants the Hetch-
Hetchy, and will eventually probably
land it."
M. M. O'Shaughnessy, City Engineer
of San Francisco, pointed out the
many advantages of the Hetch-Hetchy
water supply for San Francisco in an
interesting address at the Chapel yes
terday afternoon in the lirst Engineer
ing assembly of the semester.
His remarks in part were as fol
lows:
"No other project in the United
States lias been more talked of in the
last ten years than the Hetch-Hetchy
question.
"One of the greatest antagonists of
San Francisco in regard to the Hetch-
Hetchy supply was the Spring Valley
Water Works.
"Other antagonists are the nature
lovers. The East thinks that San
Francisco intends taking the Yosemite
Valley for their water supply. But
Hetch-Hetchy is thirty miles north of
Yosemite, and the construction of a
dam and the creation of a lake there
would add to the scenic beauty of the
valley.
"The available water sites in Cali
fornia are very rare. Few offer the
facility for dam building that is af
forded by the Tuolumne River region.
This river occupies a water-shed of
about 1500 square miles.
"Until 1908 the Hetch-Hetchy ques
tion was buried. San Francisco had
the water lights-, but the Schmitz-Ruef
administration let them alone. Now,
San Francisco has one of the best mu
nicipal governments in the United
States, and the women's votes will
still further assure the predominence
of the best in politics.
"In the permit granted to San Fran
cisco by Secretary Garfield, it was
urged that Lake Eleanor should lirst
be developed to its utmost capacity
before touching Hetch-Hetchy. Sec
retary Ballinger succeeded Garfield
and lie appointed an army-board to in
vestigate California conditions and
make him a report at Washington.
Every competing water proposition
was presented to the board, and they
reported to tlie Secretary of the In
terior that the Hetch-Hetchy was the
safest and most available source of
water supply for San Francisco. In
spite of the army-board's favorable
report the conclusion was withheld.
"John R. Freeman, of New York,
was appointed to supervise the report
and make a linal one to the Secretary
of the interior. After a year's study,
Freeman changed Grunsky's original
plan to a gravity proposition, which
called for the delivery of water to
San Francisco within 300 feet of the
city limits.
"The Yosemite River Co., of which
John Hays Hammond, of New York, is
the head, made various findings in
Lake Eleanor, where San Francisco
had permanent rights, and the city
had to pay the company $1,300,000 to
give up the locality.
