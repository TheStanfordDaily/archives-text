# ROOTERS WILL RALLY TO GREET STANFORD VARSITY
## 
### 
Four Cardinal supporters sought by
Yell Leader Cass today sent word they
would be on hand tomorrow night to
speak to the rooters gathered in the
Assembly Hull. The culminating ef
fort of the students to express their
loyalty and confidence in the fifteen
Varsity players will bring every Stan
fordite within miles to the campus to
morrow, and no better group of repre
sentative men could be found to put
the sentiment of that throng into
forceful speach than Palmer Fuller,
Ed Cunha, George Presley, and "Stub
by" Stolz.
Palmer Fuller, '10. is too well known
to the Stanford campus to require an
introduction, for he has appeared on
the rugby field almost weekly this fall
as referee.
Ed" Cunha, '06, is a former student
body president and is an ardent sup
porter of all things Stanford. He is
now in the law practice in San Fran
cisco.
George Presley, '07, head rugby
coach for four years, is the third

speaker who will come to the campus.
H. R. Stolz, '09, former track man
and rugby player, will make his first
address before a Stanford audience
since his return from Oxford, where
he was Rhodes scholar.
The men have been asked to observe
the signals of the Yell Leader for sil
ence, and not to stand on the seats or
backs of the chairs.
Immediately following the last
speech in the Assembly Hall, the root
ers will serpentine through the Inner
Quad and out to the Freshman fire.
The houses along the Row are ask
ed to provide their own red fire, as
the committee in charge has secured
only the amount to be used in the
Quad.
Coach Brown and Trainer Maloney
have promised to tell their side of the
season's work and their belief in the
Cardinal players.
The whole plan is to make the rally
shorter than those of former years,
to lessen the strain on the players
and coaches alike.
