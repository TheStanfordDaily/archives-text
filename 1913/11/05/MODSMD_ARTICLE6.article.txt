# CROWDS TO BE ADMITTED TWO HOURS BEFORE GAME
## 
### 
The gates to the bleachers on Stan
ford Field will be opened to the
crowds at 12:30 o'clock Saturday.
This was the announcement made by
Graduate Manager Wilcox today, as
the details for the Big Game were be
ing perfected.
All ticket sellers, takers, splitters,
and ushers have been asked to report
at the football training house on Sat
urday promptly at 12:15. They will
ho assigned places at that time, and
instructed in their work for the after
noon.
A new feature of the great collegi
ate contest will be the concert given
by the united bands on the turf be
fore the game. In past years the or
ganizations have entered the field sep
arately, and have devoted all their ef
forts before the game to encouraging
the rival rooting sections. In this
way the public never learned to ap
preciate the college bands as musical
organizations.
By using the center of the field be
fore the referee blows his whistle,
the bands will he enabled to give a
fair rendition to the pieces selected,
and they will be in full view of the
entire throng.
