# SOCCER TEAM ANNOUNCED FOR CALIFORNIA MATCH
## SATURDAY'S GAME IS FIRST OF CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES. Six Former Players Appear On Cardinal Line-up and Eight Veterans With California. 
### 
Eleven soccer men have been chos
en by Trainer H. \Y. Maloney, Cap
tain Higgins and ex-Captain Bellas to
take the field against the California
eleven next Saturday morning in tho
first of the annual series of three
games which determine the Intercol
legiate soccer championship with Cali
fornia. Six of the players are veter
ans of last year's victorious team.
The forward line is practically the
same as last year with the exception
of Best, who fills Vail's position at
outside left. Vail is out of the game
with a sprained ankle. Pratt, last
year's speedy outside right, tills that
position again this year. This will be
his third year on the Cardinal soccer
lineup. Another three-year veteran
in the front rank is Bellas, captain of
last year's team. He is an exception
ally versatile player, having had for
mer experience with the Barbarian
team, and in Switzerland. Captain
Higgins has had experience in the for
ward line on two former Cardinal
teams. He played center forward at
Shrewsbury College, England, and
will appear in that position against
California next Saturday. Fyfe, a vet
eran of one year, will complete the
forward line. He plays left inside.
The half back line has had less
playing experience, Dutton and
Hughes making their initial appear
ance on a Cardinal soccer team.
Steinhart, who will play the center
half, began last season as a substi
tute and ended up on the regular line
up. Center half bears much of the
brunt of the attack, for which Stein
hart's stocky build fits him.
Blodgett, who last year played on
the half-back line, has been shifted
to right fullback, where his long kick
ing may be more effective. Glass,
playing beside Blodgett at the left
fullback, is a new man on the Stan
ford lineup. His steady playing in the
preliminary matches has entitled him
to the position, where he will be es
pecially strong in the defense. Butch
er, the veteran goal keeper, will play
his third season at the post of last
defense. His ability in past games
was a material factor in Cardinal suc
cess, and he is looked to as a potent
factor in Saturday's game.
Cottrell, who substituted for last
year's team, with Clawson, Day, and
Conger, will be on the sidelines for
the Cardinal. The playing of these
men has shown to best advantage
among the soccer squad in the prac
tices, and all are capable of meeting
any emergency in the first lineup.
The game will be called on the soc
cer field adjoining the track at 10:30
on Saturday morning. S. Y. William
son, of the Barbarian club, and donor
of the Williamson interclass soccer
trophy, will referee the game.
