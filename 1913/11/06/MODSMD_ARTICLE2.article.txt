# CARDINAL PLAYERS ARE IN TRIM AND AWAIT REFEREE'S WHISTLE
## 
### 
The 1913 Stanford Varsity is an
nounced. The value of fifteen men,
proved in the grilling workout of a
long preparatory season, has entitled
them to wear the Cardinal jersey
against California next Saturday. Six
veterans, tried and found worthy in
past contests, will measure courage
and skill against six veterans of the
Blue and Gold. Two Freshmen have
earned positions in the lineup, while
the other seven players come from the
ranks of those who received their
rugby education in former seasons.
Many of the places on the team have
been closely contested. Others have
been fairly won since the early part
of the year. The decisive showing
made by the candidates this week has
enabled Coach Brown to choose the
team that is best fitted to guard the
Cardinal honor in the twenty-third
Intercollegiate match.
Erb assumes the responsibility of
play at half, the position which has
been the most closely debated during
the final weeks of practice. His dem
onstration of skill, speed, and nerve
during the time of probation has se
cured him the berth. In other re
spects, the lineup represents the nat
ural process of selection that has been
anticipated by followers of the season
at Stanford. It is the best that the
squad could offer, and will be a credit
to the Cardinal.
The total weight average of the
Stanford fifteen is 16411-15 pounds,
as opposed to 100 pounds even weight
of the California ruggers. In the
scrum the Cardinal also has an ad
vantage of one eighth pound, the aver
age being 170 2-8 pounds. Steinhart's
superior weight is a surprise to many
rugby fans who have followed the for
tunes of both Varsities. The drop in
California's weight is due to the fact
that Lockhart, who has made a strong
bid for the Blue and Gold scrum, has
yielded his place and two hundred
odd pounds weight to a much lighter
player.
Those fifteen fortunates who will
oppose California are biographed be
low'.
CARROLL.
Daniel Brendan Carroll at his posi
tion of center three quarters, locks the
backfield together with his masterly
handling of the ball. An Australian
by birth, he accompanied the team
from the Antipodes last year and play
ed brilliantly even in that aggregation
of rugby experts. He is well versed in
every department of the game, and
will prove a great factor in Saturday's
contest. He gained his knowledge of
the sport at St. Aloysius College, in
Sydney, and subsequently played great
ball for the St. George, New South
Wales, and All-Australia rugby clubs.
"Danny" is a member of Sigma Alpha
Epsilon and majors in Civil Engineer
ing. He is 5 feet 9 1 / 2 inches in height,

24 years of age, and weighs 164
pounds.
DARSIE.
William Pettigrew Darsie, field cap
tain in the absence of Captain James
Thoburn, is the only man fast enough
to serve as teammate for Gard in the

breakaway posi
tion. Always in
the thick of the
contest, he rarely
loses sight of the
ball, and leaves
nothing to be de
sired in his work
in rear rank. Ho
hails from the
nearby college
town and took a
thorough course
in rugby at the
Palo Alto high
school, on whose
football teams he

starred for several years. Darsie
played wing forward on the 1914
Freshman team, and was one of the
pack that combatted the Blue and
Gold in the muddy fight last Novem
ber. His fraternity is Phi Kappa Psi;
he is 22 years of age, 5 feet 11 inches
tall, and weighs 158 pounds.
BLASE.
Roland Roy Blase has proved his
ability to hold the scrum together
throughout the present season, and has
earned the right to play at lock In
consistent work in the preliminary
games. His height serves him in good
stead in the lineouts, and he figures
prominently in the dribbling rushes of
every contest. Blase attended high
school in St. Paul, Minnesota, where
rugby was an unknown quantity, but
his progress in learning the game has
been rapid. "Jumbo" registers from
North St. Paul, Minn., and is a Civil
Engineering major. His fraternity h -
Sigma Nu. Mlase is the heaviest mem
ber of the team, as he tops off the
scales at 191 pounds; his height is
6 feet 3 inches, and his age 27.
A. ERB.
The most hotly contested place on
the team has been that of halfback,
and in a nip and tuck battle all the
way Arthur Leslie Erb finally firoved
his superiority, and has been selected
by the coaches to direct the Stanford
scrum on the day of the Big Game.

The stocky back gets his passes out to
the backfield in double quick order,
and stops many a dangerous dribbling
rush of the opposing forwards by
timely faliing on the ball. Erb hails
from Tacoma, Washington, and gradu
ated from the high school of that city,
but he gained his previous knowledge
of rugby in the Victoria high school.
He filled the position of first five
eighths on the 1915 Freshman football
team, and substituted in the backfield
on last year's Varsity. Erb belongs to
Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity, and
is majoring in the Law department.
He weighs 155 pounds, is 21 years of
age, and stands 5 feet 9/> inches.
HALL.
Always fighting, and fighting hard,
Elwin Benoni Hall merits his position
as front, ranker. Equally dexterous
in the lineout and in the scrum, in
dribbling and in passing, Hall stands

out as one of the
most versatile
P layers on the
Stanford Varsity.
He filled the wing
position on the
1914 Fresh m an
team, but has
since found the
forwar d berth
more to his liking,
and was last year
included as front
ranker in the final
lineup.
Hall is a mem
ber of Skull and
Snakes honor so-

ciety, and Beta Theta Pi fraternity. He
is majoring in Geology and Mining,
and registers from Los Angeles.
Hall is 22 years of age, is 5 feet
9 3-4 inches in height, and weighs 163
pounds.
CLOVER.
From the start of the season, Philip
Petrie Clover made a strong bid for
middle rank, and the final lineup finds
him in the position, tlis energy in the
lineouts, his skill at dribbling, and his
tackles have shown him to be worthy
of his place. Clover starred on the
1914 Freshman team as side ranker,
and substituted last year on the Var
sity. He belongs to Quadrangle club,
Skull and Snakes, and Delta Kappa
Epsilon. He registers from Pasadena

iii the Civil Engineering department.
Clover is 21 years of age, 5 feet 11
inches in height, and weighs 16S.
GARD.
Frank Jacob Card, our phenomenal
breakaway, is completing his third
year on the Varsity. Probably the
best man in his position on the Coast,
teammate

Darsie, will
give m ore
trou ble to
Card and his
the Blue and
Golrl f o r
wards than
any other
p 1 a yers on
the Stanford
tea m. He
played in the
scrum on the
All-Star team
that held the
A u s t ralians
to such a close

score last year at Berkeley. He comes
from Glendora, but received no rugby
experience until his Freshman year,
when he earned his '14 as rear ranker
on the first year team. He is a mem
ber of Skull and Snakes and Phi Gam
ma Delta fraternity, and registers in
the Chemistry department. He weighs
162 pounds and stands 5 feet
inches, and is 21 years of age.
PECK.
Edward Lawrence Peck completes
the trio of forwards who will take
care of the front rank in the Big Game.
His aggressive playing has often won
him applause, and his tackling is al
ways a feature of every rugby match
on the turf. Steady perseverance on
his part won him the place of substi
tute last season, and this year we find
him an acknowledged Varsity man.
Peck is a member of the class of 1913,
and is a candidate for a degree in Me
chanical Engineering. He belongs to
Encina club, while his home is in

W ATKINS.
Frederick Bradshaw Watkins lias
been tried at lock, but fits most natur
ally in the side rank. He is a factor
in the scrum to be reckoned with, and
is very skillful in heeling the ball out

to the halfback,
Equal ly ag
gressive an d
powerful in the
defense, Wat
kins will prove
a great asset
in Stanford's
scoring Satur
day. His home
town is Los
Angeles, where
he attended the
Los Angeles
P o 1 y t e c h nic
high school. He
filled the post of

side rank in the 1914 Freshman team,
and was awarded his block "S" in
football when he replaced Gard at
breakaway in the intercollegiate con
test of 1911. He substituted at for
ward last year, and this season finds
him again back in the Varsity ranks.
Watkins is a member of Encina club.
Age, 24; height, 6 feet 1 inch; weight,
173 pounds.
LACHMUND.
Up till the last moment the position
of second five eighths has been in
doubt. Otto Gray Lachmund, a Fresh
man star, has out-distanced a strong
field of competitors, and is named for
the post in the final lineup. Accurate
kicking and speed in the passing rush
es has distinguished Lachraund's play
throughout the season, and he well
merits the honor which has been con
ferred upon him. lie prepared in Palo
Alto high school, and for several years
was one of the mainstays of the fast
rugby team there. His home is in Palo
Alto, and he is studying for the legal
profession. Lachmund belongs to the
Alpha Tan Omega fraternity, is IS
years of age, 5 feet 9'/j inches in
height, and weighs 153 pounds.
URBAN.
The only first year man to be chos
en on last year's Varsity, Joseph
Charles Urban, is again included on
the lineup as wing three quarters. At

all times playing
where he is need
ed, Urban fre
quently cuts loose
for a long run
or a brilliant
kick, and furn
ishes many thrills
in every contest
in which he is
entered. He cap
tained 1910's
Freshman team,
and before that
])la ye d several
years of rugby
at Mountain View
high school. His

home is in Hamilton City, and he maj
ors.in Botany. He is the lightest man
011 the team, weighing only a scant
150 pounds, but he makes up for his

lack of weight in speed on the turf.
He is 22 years of age, and 5 feet 9'/j
inches tall.
ANDREWS.
Helmus Weddel Andrews has figur
ed prominently this year in the back
field, and after being tried at five
eighths and center three quarters, his
natural aptitude for the fullback posi
tion was found. His defense is unusu
al, as he is an exceptional tackier, and
his kicks to touch are of a high order.
Andrews played the old game at San
Hiego high school and at Pomona Col
lege, but easily shifted to the English
game when he came to Stanford. He
registers in the Law department from
San Diego, and is a member of Kappa
Alpha fraternity. Age, 21; weight,
168; height, 5 feet 9>2 inches.
REEVES.
The ability of an old-timer to "come
back" is well illustrated this year in
the selection of Frank Wixon Reeves
for wing three quarters. He made the

Varsity in his
Freshman year,
playing at the
post of second five
eighths. Last year
ho substituted for
the team, and this
year displayed his
o 1 d-t im e form,
beating out sever
al clever aspir
ants for the honor.

Reeves' playing in the pinches is the
notable feature of his skill, and for
following up the ball, the veteran is
on the highest plane of efficiency. He
lives in San Bernardino, and played
four years of rugby for the high school
there before coming to Stanford.
Reeves is enrolled in Sigma Xu fra
ternity and is taking a Geology and
Mining course in the University. His
weight is IGI pounds, his height ">
feet 10 inches, and he is 21 years of
age.
AUSTIN.
Charles Alphin Austin, one of the
most prominent wearers of the Fresh
man caps, has occupied the place of
first five-eights throughout the sea
son, and will be a very dangerous op
ponent of the Blue and Gold next
Saturday. His speed and stragetic
skill earned him a place on the All-
Star team last fall, when he was the
American first five.
He prepared at Berkeley high
school, from which city he registers,
and is making Civil Engineering his
study in college. Theta Delta Chi is
his fraternity. Comparatively light in

relation to his activity, he weighs 156
pounds, is 5 feet 9 1-2 inches in height,
and is 21 years of age.
WINES.
Blaine L. Wines will oppose Cali
fornia in one of the front rank posi
tions. One of the heaviest men on the
team, he is a bulwark of strength
against the opponents' attack. He
won the block "15" as front ranker on
his Freshman team, and his ability
and marked improvement during the
present season have shown him to be
the logical man for the place. His
home is in Ruby Valley, Nevada.
Wines is a member of Sigma Alpha
Epsilon, and registers in the Geology
department. He weighs 184 pounds,
stands 5 l'eet 10 1-2 inches, and is 22

rugby education in former seasons.
Many of the places on the team have
been closely contested. Others have
been fairly won since the early part
of the year. The decisive showing
made by the candidates this week has
enabled Coach Brown to choose the
team that is best fitted to guard the
Cardinal honor in the twenty-third
Intercollegiate match.
Erb assumes the responsibility of
play at half, the position which has
been the most closely debated during
the final weeks of practice. His dem
onstration of skill, speed, and nerve
during the time of probation has se
cured him the berth. In other re
spects, the lineup represents the nat
ural process of selection that has been
anticipated by followers of the season
at Stanford. It is the best that the
squad could offer, and will be a credit
to the Cardinal.
The total weight average of the
Stanford fifteen is 16411-15 pounds,
as opposed to 100 pounds even weight
of the California ruggers. In the
scrum the Cardinal also has an ad
vantage of one eighth pound, the aver
age being 170 2-8 pounds. Steinhart's
superior weight is a surprise to many
rugby fans who have followed the for
tunes of both Varsities. The drop in
California's weight is due to the fact
that Lockhart, who has made a strong
bid for the Blue and Gold scrum, has
yielded his place and two hundred
odd pounds weight to a much lighter
player.
Those fifteen fortunates who will
oppose California are biographed be
low'.
CARROLL.
Daniel Brendan Carroll at his posi
tion of center three quarters, locks the
backfield together with his masterly
handling of the ball. An Australian
by birth, he accompanied the team
from the Antipodes last year and play
ed brilliantly even in that aggregation
of rugby experts. He is well versed in
every department of the game, and
will prove a great factor in Saturday's
contest. He gained his knowledge of
the sport at St. Aloysius College, in
Sydney, and subsequently played great
ball for the St. George, New South
Wales, and All-Australia rugby clubs.
"Danny" is a member of Sigma Alpha
Epsilon and majors in Civil Engineer
ing. He is 5 feet 9 1 / 2 inches in height,

24 years of age, and weighs 164
pounds.
DARSIE.
William Pettigrew Darsie, field cap
tain in the absence of Captain James
Thoburn, is the only man fast enough
to serve as teammate for Gard in the

breakaway posi
tion. Always in
the thick of the
contest, he rarely
loses sight of the
ball, and leaves
nothing to be de
sired in his work
in rear rank. Ho
hails from the
nearby college
town and took a
thorough course
in rugby at the
Palo Alto high
school, on whose
football teams he

starred for several years. Darsie
played wing forward on the 1914
Freshman team, and was one of the
pack that combatted the Blue and
Gold in the muddy fight last Novem
ber. His fraternity is Phi Kappa Psi;
he is 22 years of age, 5 feet 11 inches
tall, and weighs 158 pounds.
BLASE.
Roland Roy Blase has proved his
ability to hold the scrum together
throughout the present season, and has
earned the right to play at lock In
consistent work in the preliminary
games. His height serves him in good
stead in the lineouts, and he figures
prominently in the dribbling rushes of
every contest. Blase attended high
school in St. Paul, Minnesota, where
rugby was an unknown quantity, but
his progress in learning the game has
been rapid. "Jumbo" registers from
North St. Paul, Minn., and is a Civil
Engineering major. His fraternity h -
Sigma Nu. Mlase is the heaviest mem
ber of the team, as he tops off the
scales at 191 pounds; his height is
6 feet 3 inches, and his age 27.
A. ERB.
The most hotly contested place on
the team has been that of halfback,
and in a nip and tuck battle all the
way Arthur Leslie Erb finally firoved
his superiority, and has been selected
by the coaches to direct the Stanford
scrum on the day of the Big Game.

The stocky back gets his passes out to
the backfield in double quick order,
and stops many a dangerous dribbling
rush of the opposing forwards by
timely faliing on the ball. Erb hails
from Tacoma, Washington, and gradu
ated from the high school of that city,
but he gained his previous knowledge
of rugby in the Victoria high school.
He filled the position of first five
eighths on the 1915 Freshman football
team, and substituted in the backfield
on last year's Varsity. Erb belongs to
Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity, and
is majoring in the Law department.
He weighs 155 pounds, is 21 years of
age, and stands 5 feet 9/> inches.
HALL.
Always fighting, and fighting hard,
Elwin Benoni Hall merits his position
as front, ranker. Equally dexterous
in the lineout and in the scrum, in
dribbling and in passing, Hall stands

out as one of the
most versatile
P layers on the
Stanford Varsity.
He filled the wing
position on the
1914 Fresh m an
team, but has
since found the
forwar d berth
more to his liking,
and was last year
included as front
ranker in the final
lineup.
Hall is a mem
ber of Skull and
Snakes honor so-

ciety, and Beta Theta Pi fraternity. He
is majoring in Geology and Mining,
and registers from Los Angeles.
Hall is 22 years of age, is 5 feet
9 3-4 inches in height, and weighs 163
pounds.
CLOVER.
From the start of the season, Philip
Petrie Clover made a strong bid for
middle rank, and the final lineup finds
him in the position, tlis energy in the
lineouts, his skill at dribbling, and his
tackles have shown him to be worthy
of his place. Clover starred on the
1914 Freshman team as side ranker,
and substituted last year on the Var
sity. He belongs to Quadrangle club,
Skull and Snakes, and Delta Kappa
Epsilon. He registers from Pasadena

iii the Civil Engineering department.
Clover is 21 years of age, 5 feet 11
inches in height, and weighs 16S.
GARD.
Frank Jacob Card, our phenomenal
breakaway, is completing his third
year on the Varsity. Probably the
best man in his position on the Coast,
teammate

Darsie, will
give m ore
trou ble to
Card and his
the Blue and
Golrl f o r
wards than
any other
p 1 a yers on
the Stanford
tea m. He
played in the
scrum on the
All-Star team
that held the
A u s t ralians
to such a close

score last year at Berkeley. He comes
from Glendora, but received no rugby
experience until his Freshman year,
when he earned his '14 as rear ranker
on the first year team. He is a mem
ber of Skull and Snakes and Phi Gam
ma Delta fraternity, and registers in
the Chemistry department. He weighs
162 pounds and stands 5 feet
inches, and is 21 years of age.
PECK.
Edward Lawrence Peck completes
the trio of forwards who will take
care of the front rank in the Big Game.
His aggressive playing has often won
him applause, and his tackling is al
ways a feature of every rugby match
on the turf. Steady perseverance on
his part won him the place of substi
tute last season, and this year we find
him an acknowledged Varsity man.
Peck is a member of the class of 1913,
and is a candidate for a degree in Me
chanical Engineering. He belongs to
Encina club, while his home is in

W ATKINS.
Frederick Bradshaw Watkins lias
been tried at lock, but fits most natur
ally in the side rank. He is a factor
in the scrum to be reckoned with, and
is very skillful in heeling the ball out

to the halfback,
Equal ly ag
gressive an d
powerful in the
defense, Wat
kins will prove
a great asset
in Stanford's
scoring Satur
day. His home
town is Los
Angeles, where
he attended the
Los Angeles
P o 1 y t e c h nic
high school. He
filled the post of

side rank in the 1914 Freshman team,
and was awarded his block "S" in
football when he replaced Gard at
breakaway in the intercollegiate con
test of 1911. He substituted at for
ward last year, and this season finds
him again back in the Varsity ranks.
Watkins is a member of Encina club.
Age, 24; height, 6 feet 1 inch; weight,
173 pounds.
LACHMUND.
Up till the last moment the position
of second five eighths has been in
doubt. Otto Gray Lachmund, a Fresh
man star, has out-distanced a strong
field of competitors, and is named for
the post in the final lineup. Accurate
kicking and speed in the passing rush
es has distinguished Lachraund's play
throughout the season, and he well
merits the honor which has been con
ferred upon him. lie prepared in Palo
Alto high school, and for several years
was one of the mainstays of the fast
rugby team there. His home is in Palo
Alto, and he is studying for the legal
profession. Lachmund belongs to the
Alpha Tan Omega fraternity, is IS
years of age, 5 feet 9'/j inches in
height, and weighs 153 pounds.
URBAN.
The only first year man to be chos
en on last year's Varsity, Joseph
Charles Urban, is again included on
the lineup as wing three quarters. At

all times playing
where he is need
ed, Urban fre
quently cuts loose
for a long run
or a brilliant
kick, and furn
ishes many thrills
in every contest
in which he is
entered. He cap
tained 1910's
Freshman team,
and before that
])la ye d several
years of rugby
at Mountain View
high school. His

home is in Hamilton City, and he maj
ors.in Botany. He is the lightest man
011 the team, weighing only a scant
150 pounds, but he makes up for his

lack of weight in speed on the turf.
He is 22 years of age, and 5 feet 9'/j
inches tall.
ANDREWS.
Helmus Weddel Andrews has figur
ed prominently this year in the back
field, and after being tried at five
eighths and center three quarters, his
natural aptitude for the fullback posi
tion was found. His defense is unusu
al, as he is an exceptional tackier, and
his kicks to touch are of a high order.
Andrews played the old game at San
Hiego high school and at Pomona Col
lege, but easily shifted to the English
game when he came to Stanford. He
registers in the Law department from
San Diego, and is a member of Kappa
Alpha fraternity. Age, 21; weight,
168; height, 5 feet 9>2 inches.
REEVES.
The ability of an old-timer to "come
back" is well illustrated this year in
the selection of Frank Wixon Reeves
for wing three quarters. He made the

Varsity in his
Freshman year,
playing at the
post of second five
eighths. Last year
ho substituted for
the team, and this
year displayed his
o 1 d-t im e form,
beating out sever
al clever aspir
ants for the honor.

Reeves' playing in the pinches is the
notable feature of his skill, and for
following up the ball, the veteran is
on the highest plane of efficiency. He
lives in San Bernardino, and played
four years of rugby for the high school
there before coming to Stanford.
Reeves is enrolled in Sigma Xu fra
ternity and is taking a Geology and
Mining course in the University. His
weight is IGI pounds, his height ">
feet 10 inches, and he is 21 years of
age.
AUSTIN.
Charles Alphin Austin, one of the
most prominent wearers of the Fresh
man caps, has occupied the place of
first five-eights throughout the sea
son, and will be a very dangerous op
ponent of the Blue and Gold next
Saturday. His speed and stragetic
skill earned him a place on the All-
Star team last fall, when he was the
American first five.
He prepared at Berkeley high
school, from which city he registers,
and is making Civil Engineering his
study in college. Theta Delta Chi is
his fraternity. Comparatively light in

relation to his activity, he weighs 156
pounds, is 5 feet 9 1-2 inches in height,
and is 21 years of age.
WINES.
Blaine L. Wines will oppose Cali
fornia in one of the front rank posi
tions. One of the heaviest men on the
team, he is a bulwark of strength
against the opponents' attack. He
won the block "15" as front ranker on
his Freshman team, and his ability
and marked improvement during the
present season have shown him to be
the logical man for the place. His
home is in Ruby Valley, Nevada.
Wines is a member of Sigma Alpha
Epsilon, and registers in the Geology
department. He weighs 184 pounds,
stands 5 l'eet 10 1-2 inches, and is 22

The 1913 Stanford Varsity is an
nounced. The value of fifteen men,
proved in the grilling workout of a
long preparatory season, has entitled
them to wear the Cardinal jersey
against California next Saturday. Six
veterans, tried and found worthy in

onstration of skill, speed, and nerve
during the time of probation has se
cured him the berth. In other re
spects, the lineup represents the nat
ural process of selection that has been
anticipated by followers of the season
at Stanford. It is the best that the
squad could offer, and will be a credit
to the Cardinal.
The total weight average of the
Stanford fifteen is 16411-15 pounds,
as opposed to 100 pounds even weight
of the California ruggers. In the
scrum the Cardinal also has an ad
vantage of one eighth pound, the aver
age being 170 2-8 pounds. Steinhart's
superior weight is a surprise to many
rugby fans who have followed the for
tunes of both Varsities. The drop in
California's weight is due to the fact
that Lockhart, who has made a strong
bid for the Blue and Gold scrum, has
yielded his place and two hundred
odd pounds weight to a much lighter
player.
Those fifteen fortunates who will
oppose California are biographed be
low'.
CARROLL.
Daniel Brendan Carroll at his posi
tion of center three quarters, locks the
backfield together with his masterly
handling of the ball. An Australian
by birth, he accompanied the team
from the Antipodes last year and play
ed brilliantly even in that aggregation
of rugby experts. He is well versed in
every department of the game, and
will prove a great factor in Saturday's
contest. He gained his knowledge of
the sport at St. Aloysius College, in
Sydney, and subsequently played great
ball for the St. George, New South
Wales, and All-Australia rugby clubs.
"Danny" is a member of Sigma Alpha
Epsilon and majors in Civil Engineer
ing. He is 5 feet 9 1 / 2 inches in height,

24 years of age, and weighs 164
pounds.
DARSIE.
William Pettigrew Darsie, field cap
tain in the absence of Captain James
Thoburn, is the only man fast enough
to serve as teammate for Gard in the

breakaway posi
tion. Always in
the thick of the
contest, he rarely
loses sight of the
ball, and leaves
nothing to be de
sired in his work
in rear rank. Ho
hails from the
nearby college
town and took a
thorough course
in rugby at the
Palo Alto high
school, on whose
football teams he

starred for several years. Darsie
played wing forward on the 1914
Freshman team, and was one of the
pack that combatted the Blue and
Gold in the muddy fight last Novem
ber. His fraternity is Phi Kappa Psi;
he is 22 years of age, 5 feet 11 inches
tall, and weighs 158 pounds.
BLASE.
Roland Roy Blase has proved his
ability to hold the scrum together
throughout the present season, and has
earned the right to play at lock In
consistent work in the preliminary
games. His height serves him in good
stead in the lineouts, and he figures
prominently in the dribbling rushes of
every contest. Blase attended high
school in St. Paul, Minnesota, where
rugby was an unknown quantity, but
his progress in learning the game has
been rapid. "Jumbo" registers from
North St. Paul, Minn., and is a Civil
Engineering major. His fraternity h -
Sigma Nu. Mlase is the heaviest mem
ber of the team, as he tops off the
scales at 191 pounds; his height is
6 feet 3 inches, and his age 27.
A. ERB.
The most hotly contested place on
the team has been that of halfback,
and in a nip and tuck battle all the
way Arthur Leslie Erb finally firoved
his superiority, and has been selected
by the coaches to direct the Stanford
scrum on the day of the Big Game.

The stocky back gets his passes out to
the backfield in double quick order,
and stops many a dangerous dribbling
rush of the opposing forwards by
timely faliing on the ball. Erb hails
from Tacoma, Washington, and gradu
ated from the high school of that city,
but he gained his previous knowledge
of rugby in the Victoria high school.
He filled the position of first five
eighths on the 1915 Freshman football
team, and substituted in the backfield
on last year's Varsity. Erb belongs to
Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity, and
is majoring in the Law department.
He weighs 155 pounds, is 21 years of
age, and stands 5 feet 9/> inches.
HALL.
Always fighting, and fighting hard,
Elwin Benoni Hall merits his position
as front, ranker. Equally dexterous
in the lineout and in the scrum, in
dribbling and in passing, Hall stands

out as one of the
most versatile
P layers on the
Stanford Varsity.
He filled the wing
position on the
1914 Fresh m an
team, but has
since found the
forwar d berth
more to his liking,
and was last year
included as front
ranker in the final
lineup.
Hall is a mem
ber of Skull and
Snakes honor so-

ciety, and Beta Theta Pi fraternity. He
is majoring in Geology and Mining,
and registers from Los Angeles.
Hall is 22 years of age, is 5 feet
9 3-4 inches in height, and weighs 163
pounds.
CLOVER.
From the start of the season, Philip
Petrie Clover made a strong bid for
middle rank, and the final lineup finds
him in the position, tlis energy in the
lineouts, his skill at dribbling, and his
tackles have shown him to be worthy
of his place. Clover starred on the
1914 Freshman team as side ranker,
and substituted last year on the Var
sity. He belongs to Quadrangle club,
Skull and Snakes, and Delta Kappa
Epsilon. He registers from Pasadena

iii the Civil Engineering department.
Clover is 21 years of age, 5 feet 11
inches in height, and weighs 16S.
GARD.
Frank Jacob Card, our phenomenal
breakaway, is completing his third
year on the Varsity. Probably the
best man in his position on the Coast,
teammate

Darsie, will
give m ore
trou ble to
Card and his
the Blue and
Golrl f o r
wards than
any other
p 1 a yers on
the Stanford
tea m. He
played in the
scrum on the
All-Star team
that held the
A u s t ralians
to such a close

score last year at Berkeley. He comes
from Glendora, but received no rugby
experience until his Freshman year,
when he earned his '14 as rear ranker
on the first year team. He is a mem
ber of Skull and Snakes and Phi Gam
ma Delta fraternity, and registers in
the Chemistry department. He weighs
162 pounds and stands 5 feet
inches, and is 21 years of age.
PECK.
Edward Lawrence Peck completes
the trio of forwards who will take
care of the front rank in the Big Game.
His aggressive playing has often won
him applause, and his tackling is al
ways a feature of every rugby match
on the turf. Steady perseverance on
his part won him the place of substi
tute last season, and this year we find
him an acknowledged Varsity man.
Peck is a member of the class of 1913,
and is a candidate for a degree in Me
chanical Engineering. He belongs to

W ATKINS.
Frederick Bradshaw Watkins lias
been tried at lock, but fits most natur
ally in the side rank. He is a factor
in the scrum to be reckoned with, and
is very skillful in heeling the ball out

to the halfback,
Equal ly ag
gressive an d
powerful in the
defense, Wat
kins will prove
a great asset
in Stanford's
scoring Satur
day. His home
town is Los
Angeles, where
he attended the
Los Angeles
P o 1 y t e c h nic
high school. He
filled the post of

side rank in the 1914 Freshman team,
and was awarded his block "S" in
football when he replaced Gard at
breakaway in the intercollegiate con
test of 1911. He substituted at for
ward last year, and this season finds
him again back in the Varsity ranks.
Watkins is a member of Encina club.
Age, 24; height, 6 feet 1 inch; weight,
173 pounds.
LACHMUND.
Up till the last moment the position
of second five eighths has been in
doubt. Otto Gray Lachmund, a Fresh
man star, has out-distanced a strong
field of competitors, and is named for
the post in the final lineup. Accurate
kicking and speed in the passing rush
es has distinguished Lachraund's play
throughout the season, and he well
merits the honor which has been con
ferred upon him. lie prepared in Palo
Alto high school, and for several years
was one of the mainstays of the fast
rugby team there. His home is in Palo
Alto, and he is studying for the legal
profession. Lachmund belongs to the
Alpha Tan Omega fraternity, is IS
years of age, 5 feet 9'/j inches in
height, and weighs 153 pounds.
URBAN.
The only first year man to be chos
en on last year's Varsity, Joseph
Charles Urban, is again included on
the lineup as wing three quarters. At

all times playing
where he is need
ed, Urban fre
quently cuts loose
for a long run
or a brilliant
kick, and furn
ishes many thrills
in every contest
in which he is
entered. He cap
tained 1910's
Freshman team,
and before that
])la ye d several
years of rugby
at Mountain View
high school. His

home is in Hamilton City, and he maj
ors.in Botany. He is the lightest man
011 the team, weighing only a scant
150 pounds, but he makes up for his

lack of weight in speed on the turf.
He is 22 years of age, and 5 feet 9'/j
inches tall.
ANDREWS.
Helmus Weddel Andrews has figur
ed prominently this year in the back
field, and after being tried at five
eighths and center three quarters, his
natural aptitude for the fullback posi
tion was found. His defense is unusu
al, as he is an exceptional tackier, and
his kicks to touch are of a high order.
Andrews played the old game at San
Hiego high school and at Pomona Col
lege, but easily shifted to the English
game when he came to Stanford. He
registers in the Law department from
San Diego, and is a member of Kappa
Alpha fraternity. Age, 21; weight,
168; height, 5 feet 9>2 inches.
REEVES.
The ability of an old-timer to "come
back" is well illustrated this year in
the selection of Frank Wixon Reeves
for wing three quarters. He made the

Varsity in his
Freshman year,
playing at the
post of second five
eighths. Last year
ho substituted for
the team, and this
year displayed his
o 1 d-t im e form,
beating out sever
al clever aspir
ants for the honor.

Reeves' playing in the pinches is the
notable feature of his skill, and for
following up the ball, the veteran is
on the highest plane of efficiency. He
lives in San Bernardino, and played
four years of rugby for the high school
there before coming to Stanford.
Reeves is enrolled in Sigma Xu fra
ternity and is taking a Geology and
Mining course in the University. His
weight is IGI pounds, his height ">
feet 10 inches, and he is 21 years of
age.
AUSTIN.
Charles Alphin Austin, one of the
most prominent wearers of the Fresh
man caps, has occupied the place of
first five-eights throughout the sea
son, and will be a very dangerous op
ponent of the Blue and Gold next
Saturday. His speed and stragetic
skill earned him a place on the All-
Star team last fall, when he was the
American first five.
He prepared at Berkeley high
school, from which city he registers,
and is making Civil Engineering his
study in college. Theta Delta Chi is
his fraternity. Comparatively light in

relation to his activity, he weighs 156
pounds, is 5 feet 9 1-2 inches in height,
and is 21 years of age.
WINES.
Blaine L. Wines will oppose Cali
fornia in one of the front rank posi
tions. One of the heaviest men on the
team, he is a bulwark of strength
against the opponents' attack. He
won the block "15" as front ranker on
his Freshman team, and his ability
and marked improvement during the
present season have shown him to be
the logical man for the place. His
home is in Ruby Valley, Nevada.
Wines is a member of Sigma Alpha
Epsilon, and registers in the Geology
department. He weighs 184 pounds,
stands 5 l'eet 10 1-2 inches, and is 22

The 1913 Stanford Varsity is an
nounced. The value of fifteen men,
proved in the grilling workout of a
long preparatory season, has entitled
them to wear the Cardinal jersey
against California next Saturday. Six
veterans, tried and found worthy in
past contests, will measure courage
and skill against six veterans of the
Blue and Gold. Two Freshmen have
earned positions in the lineup, while
the other seven players come from the
ranks of those who received their
rugby education in former seasons.
Many of the places on the team have
been closely contested. Others have
been fairly won since the early part
of the year. The decisive showing
made by the candidates this week has
enabled Coach Brown to choose the
team that is best fitted to guard the
Cardinal honor in the twenty-third
Intercollegiate match.
Erb assumes the responsibility of

of the California ruggers. In the
scrum the Cardinal also has an ad
vantage of one eighth pound, the aver
age being 170 2-8 pounds. Steinhart's
superior weight is a surprise to many
rugby fans who have followed the for
tunes of both Varsities. The drop in
California's weight is due to the fact
that Lockhart, who has made a strong
bid for the Blue and Gold scrum, has
yielded his place and two hundred
odd pounds weight to a much lighter
player.
Those fifteen fortunates who will
oppose California are biographed be
low'.
CARROLL.
Daniel Brendan Carroll at his posi
tion of center three quarters, locks the
backfield together with his masterly
handling of the ball. An Australian
by birth, he accompanied the team
from the Antipodes last year and play
ed brilliantly even in that aggregation
of rugby experts. He is well versed in
every department of the game, and
will prove a great factor in Saturday's
contest. He gained his knowledge of
the sport at St. Aloysius College, in
Sydney, and subsequently played great
ball for the St. George, New South
Wales, and All-Australia rugby clubs.
"Danny" is a member of Sigma Alpha
Epsilon and majors in Civil Engineer
ing. He is 5 feet 9 1 / 2 inches in height,

24 years of age, and weighs 164
pounds.
DARSIE.
William Pettigrew Darsie, field cap
tain in the absence of Captain James
Thoburn, is the only man fast enough
to serve as teammate for Gard in the

breakaway posi
tion. Always in
the thick of the
contest, he rarely
loses sight of the
ball, and leaves
nothing to be de
sired in his work
in rear rank. Ho
hails from the
nearby college
town and took a
thorough course
in rugby at the
Palo Alto high
school, on whose
football teams he

starred for several years. Darsie
played wing forward on the 1914
Freshman team, and was one of the
pack that combatted the Blue and
Gold in the muddy fight last Novem
ber. His fraternity is Phi Kappa Psi;
he is 22 years of age, 5 feet 11 inches
tall, and weighs 158 pounds.
BLASE.
Roland Roy Blase has proved his
ability to hold the scrum together
throughout the present season, and has
earned the right to play at lock In
consistent work in the preliminary
games. His height serves him in good
stead in the lineouts, and he figures
prominently in the dribbling rushes of
every contest. Blase attended high
school in St. Paul, Minnesota, where
rugby was an unknown quantity, but
his progress in learning the game has
been rapid. "Jumbo" registers from
North St. Paul, Minn., and is a Civil
Engineering major. His fraternity h -
Sigma Nu. Mlase is the heaviest mem
ber of the team, as he tops off the
scales at 191 pounds; his height is
6 feet 3 inches, and his age 27.
A. ERB.
The most hotly contested place on
the team has been that of halfback,
and in a nip and tuck battle all the
way Arthur Leslie Erb finally firoved
his superiority, and has been selected
by the coaches to direct the Stanford
scrum on the day of the Big Game.

The stocky back gets his passes out to
the backfield in double quick order,
and stops many a dangerous dribbling
rush of the opposing forwards by
timely faliing on the ball. Erb hails
from Tacoma, Washington, and gradu
ated from the high school of that city,
but he gained his previous knowledge
of rugby in the Victoria high school.
He filled the position of first five
eighths on the 1915 Freshman football
team, and substituted in the backfield
on last year's Varsity. Erb belongs to
Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity, and
is majoring in the Law department.
He weighs 155 pounds, is 21 years of
age, and stands 5 feet 9/> inches.
HALL.
Always fighting, and fighting hard,
Elwin Benoni Hall merits his position
as front, ranker. Equally dexterous
in the lineout and in the scrum, in
dribbling and in passing, Hall stands

out as one of the
most versatile
P layers on the
Stanford Varsity.
He filled the wing
position on the
1914 Fresh m an
team, but has
since found the
forwar d berth
more to his liking,
and was last year
included as front
ranker in the final
lineup.
Hall is a mem
ber of Skull and
Snakes honor so-

ciety, and Beta Theta Pi fraternity. He
is majoring in Geology and Mining,
and registers from Los Angeles.
Hall is 22 years of age, is 5 feet
9 3-4 inches in height, and weighs 163
pounds.
CLOVER.
From the start of the season, Philip
Petrie Clover made a strong bid for
middle rank, and the final lineup finds
him in the position, tlis energy in the
lineouts, his skill at dribbling, and his
tackles have shown him to be worthy
of his place. Clover starred on the
1914 Freshman team as side ranker,
and substituted last year on the Var
sity. He belongs to Quadrangle club,
Skull and Snakes, and Delta Kappa
Epsilon. He registers from Pasadena

iii the Civil Engineering department.
Clover is 21 years of age, 5 feet 11
inches in height, and weighs 16S.
GARD.
Frank Jacob Card, our phenomenal
breakaway, is completing his third
year on the Varsity. Probably the
best man in his position on the Coast,
teammate

Darsie, will
give m ore
trou ble to
Card and his
the Blue and
Golrl f o r
wards than
any other
p 1 a yers on
the Stanford
tea m. He
played in the
scrum on the
All-Star team
that held the
A u s t ralians
to such a close

score last year at Berkeley. He comes
from Glendora, but received no rugby
experience until his Freshman year,
when he earned his '14 as rear ranker
on the first year team. He is a mem
ber of Skull and Snakes and Phi Gam
ma Delta fraternity, and registers in
the Chemistry department. He weighs
162 pounds and stands 5 feet
inches, and is 21 years of age.
PECK.
Edward Lawrence Peck completes
the trio of forwards who will take
care of the front rank in the Big Game.
His aggressive playing has often won
him applause, and his tackling is al
ways a feature of every rugby match
on the turf. Steady perseverance on
his part won him the place of substi
tute last season, and this year we find
him an acknowledged Varsity man.
Peck is a member of the class of 1913,
and is a candidate for a degree in Me
chanical Engineering. He belongs to

W ATKINS.
Frederick Bradshaw Watkins lias
been tried at lock, but fits most natur
ally in the side rank. He is a factor
in the scrum to be reckoned with, and
is very skillful in heeling the ball out

to the halfback,
Equal ly ag
gressive an d
powerful in the
defense, Wat
kins will prove
a great asset
in Stanford's
scoring Satur
day. His home
town is Los

high school. He
filled the post of

side rank in the 1914 Freshman team,
and was awarded his block "S" in
football when he replaced Gard at
breakaway in the intercollegiate con
test of 1911. He substituted at for
ward last year, and this season finds
him again back in the Varsity ranks.
Watkins is a member of Encina club.
Age, 24; height, 6 feet 1 inch; weight,
173 pounds.
LACHMUND.
Up till the last moment the position
of second five eighths has been in
doubt. Otto Gray Lachmund, a Fresh
man star, has out-distanced a strong
field of competitors, and is named for
the post in the final lineup. Accurate
kicking and speed in the passing rush
es has distinguished Lachraund's play
throughout the season, and he well
merits the honor which has been con
ferred upon him. lie prepared in Palo
Alto high school, and for several years
was one of the mainstays of the fast
rugby team there. His home is in Palo
Alto, and he is studying for the legal
profession. Lachmund belongs to the
Alpha Tan Omega fraternity, is IS
years of age, 5 feet 9'/j inches in
height, and weighs 153 pounds.
URBAN.
The only first year man to be chos
en on last year's Varsity, Joseph
Charles Urban, is again included on
the lineup as wing three quarters. At

all times playing
where he is need
ed, Urban fre
quently cuts loose
for a long run
or a brilliant
kick, and furn
ishes many thrills
in every contest
in which he is
entered. He cap
tained 1910's
Freshman team,
and before that
])la ye d several
years of rugby
at Mountain View
high school. His

home is in Hamilton City, and he maj
ors.in Botany. He is the lightest man
011 the team, weighing only a scant
150 pounds, but he makes up for his

lack of weight in speed on the turf.
He is 22 years of age, and 5 feet 9'/j
inches tall.
ANDREWS.
Helmus Weddel Andrews has figur
ed prominently this year in the back
field, and after being tried at five
eighths and center three quarters, his
natural aptitude for the fullback posi
tion was found. His defense is unusu
al, as he is an exceptional tackier, and
his kicks to touch are of a high order.
Andrews played the old game at San
Hiego high school and at Pomona Col
lege, but easily shifted to the English
game when he came to Stanford. He
registers in the Law department from
San Diego, and is a member of Kappa
Alpha fraternity. Age, 21; weight,
168; height, 5 feet 9>2 inches.
REEVES.
The ability of an old-timer to "come
back" is well illustrated this year in
the selection of Frank Wixon Reeves
for wing three quarters. He made the

Varsity in his
Freshman year,
playing at the
post of second five
eighths. Last year
ho substituted for
the team, and this
year displayed his
o 1 d-t im e form,
beating out sever
al clever aspir
ants for the honor.

Reeves' playing in the pinches is the
notable feature of his skill, and for
following up the ball, the veteran is
on the highest plane of efficiency. He
lives in San Bernardino, and played
four years of rugby for the high school
there before coming to Stanford.
Reeves is enrolled in Sigma Xu fra
ternity and is taking a Geology and
Mining course in the University. His
weight is IGI pounds, his height ">
feet 10 inches, and he is 21 years of
age.
AUSTIN.
Charles Alphin Austin, one of the
most prominent wearers of the Fresh
man caps, has occupied the place of
first five-eights throughout the sea
son, and will be a very dangerous op
ponent of the Blue and Gold next
Saturday. His speed and stragetic
skill earned him a place on the All-
Star team last fall, when he was the
American first five.
He prepared at Berkeley high
school, from which city he registers,
and is making Civil Engineering his
study in college. Theta Delta Chi is
his fraternity. Comparatively light in

relation to his activity, he weighs 156
pounds, is 5 feet 9 1-2 inches in height,
and is 21 years of age.
WINES.
Blaine L. Wines will oppose Cali
fornia in one of the front rank posi
tions. One of the heaviest men on the
team, he is a bulwark of strength
against the opponents' attack. He
won the block "15" as front ranker on
his Freshman team, and his ability
and marked improvement during the
present season have shown him to be
the logical man for the place. His
home is in Ruby Valley, Nevada.
Wines is a member of Sigma Alpha
Epsilon, and registers in the Geology
department. He weighs 184 pounds,
stands 5 l'eet 10 1-2 inches, and is 22

The 1913 Stanford Varsity is an
nounced. The value of fifteen men,
proved in the grilling workout of a
long preparatory season, has entitled
them to wear the Cardinal jersey
against California next Saturday. Six
veterans, tried and found worthy in
past contests, will measure courage
and skill against six veterans of the
Blue and Gold. Two Freshmen have
earned positions in the lineup, while
the other seven players come from the
ranks of those who received their
rugby education in former seasons.
Many of the places on the team have
been closely contested. Others have
been fairly won since the early part
of the year. The decisive showing
made by the candidates this week has
enabled Coach Brown to choose the
team that is best fitted to guard the
Cardinal honor in the twenty-third
Intercollegiate match.
Erb assumes the responsibility of
play at half, the position which has
been the most closely debated during
the final weeks of practice. His dem
onstration of skill, speed, and nerve
during the time of probation has se
cured him the berth. In other re
spects, the lineup represents the nat
ural process of selection that has been
anticipated by followers of the season
at Stanford. It is the best that the
squad could offer, and will be a credit
to the Cardinal.
The total weight average of the
Stanford fifteen is 16411-15 pounds,

odd pounds weight to a much lighter
player.
Those fifteen fortunates who will
oppose California are biographed be

CARROLL.
Daniel Brendan Carroll at his posi
tion of center three quarters, locks the
backfield together with his masterly
handling of the ball. An Australian
by birth, he accompanied the team
from the Antipodes last year and play
ed brilliantly even in that aggregation
of rugby experts. He is well versed in
every department of the game, and
will prove a great factor in Saturday's
contest. He gained his knowledge of
the sport at St. Aloysius College, in
Sydney, and subsequently played great
ball for the St. George, New South
Wales, and All-Australia rugby clubs.
"Danny" is a member of Sigma Alpha
Epsilon and majors in Civil Engineer
ing. He is 5 feet 9 1 / 2 inches in height,

24 years of age, and weighs 164
pounds.
DARSIE.
William Pettigrew Darsie, field cap
tain in the absence of Captain James
Thoburn, is the only man fast enough
to serve as teammate for Gard in the

breakaway posi
tion. Always in
the thick of the
contest, he rarely
loses sight of the
ball, and leaves
nothing to be de
sired in his work
in rear rank. Ho
hails from the
nearby college
town and took a
thorough course
in rugby at the
Palo Alto high
school, on whose
football teams he

starred for several years. Darsie
played wing forward on the 1914
Freshman team, and was one of the
pack that combatted the Blue and
Gold in the muddy fight last Novem
ber. His fraternity is Phi Kappa Psi;
he is 22 years of age, 5 feet 11 inches
tall, and weighs 158 pounds.
BLASE.
Roland Roy Blase has proved his
ability to hold the scrum together
throughout the present season, and has
earned the right to play at lock In
consistent work in the preliminary
games. His height serves him in good
stead in the lineouts, and he figures
prominently in the dribbling rushes of
every contest. Blase attended high
school in St. Paul, Minnesota, where
rugby was an unknown quantity, but
his progress in learning the game has
been rapid. "Jumbo" registers from
North St. Paul, Minn., and is a Civil
Engineering major. His fraternity h -
Sigma Nu. Mlase is the heaviest mem
ber of the team, as he tops off the
scales at 191 pounds; his height is
6 feet 3 inches, and his age 27.
A. ERB.
The most hotly contested place on
the team has been that of halfback,
and in a nip and tuck battle all the
way Arthur Leslie Erb finally firoved
his superiority, and has been selected
by the coaches to direct the Stanford
scrum on the day of the Big Game.

The stocky back gets his passes out to
the backfield in double quick order,
and stops many a dangerous dribbling
rush of the opposing forwards by
timely faliing on the ball. Erb hails
from Tacoma, Washington, and gradu
ated from the high school of that city,
but he gained his previous knowledge
of rugby in the Victoria high school.
He filled the position of first five
eighths on the 1915 Freshman football
team, and substituted in the backfield
on last year's Varsity. Erb belongs to
Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity, and
is majoring in the Law department.
He weighs 155 pounds, is 21 years of
age, and stands 5 feet 9/> inches.
HALL.
Always fighting, and fighting hard,
Elwin Benoni Hall merits his position
as front, ranker. Equally dexterous
in the lineout and in the scrum, in
dribbling and in passing, Hall stands

out as one of the
most versatile
P layers on the
Stanford Varsity.
He filled the wing
position on the
1914 Fresh m an
team, but has
since found the
forwar d berth
more to his liking,
and was last year
included as front
ranker in the final
lineup.
Hall is a mem
ber of Skull and
Snakes honor so-

ciety, and Beta Theta Pi fraternity. He
is majoring in Geology and Mining,
and registers from Los Angeles.
Hall is 22 years of age, is 5 feet
9 3-4 inches in height, and weighs 163
pounds.
CLOVER.
From the start of the season, Philip
Petrie Clover made a strong bid for
middle rank, and the final lineup finds
him in the position, tlis energy in the
lineouts, his skill at dribbling, and his
tackles have shown him to be worthy
of his place. Clover starred on the
1914 Freshman team as side ranker,
and substituted last year on the Var
sity. He belongs to Quadrangle club,
Skull and Snakes, and Delta Kappa
Epsilon. He registers from Pasadena

iii the Civil Engineering department.
Clover is 21 years of age, 5 feet 11
inches in height, and weighs 16S.
GARD.
Frank Jacob Card, our phenomenal
breakaway, is completing his third
year on the Varsity. Probably the
best man in his position on the Coast,
teammate

Darsie, will
give m ore
trou ble to
Card and his
the Blue and
Golrl f o r
wards than
any other
p 1 a yers on
the Stanford
tea m. He
played in the
scrum on the
All-Star team
that held the
A u s t ralians
to such a close

score last year at Berkeley. He comes
from Glendora, but received no rugby
experience until his Freshman year,
when he earned his '14 as rear ranker
on the first year team. He is a mem
ber of Skull and Snakes and Phi Gam
ma Delta fraternity, and registers in
the Chemistry department. He weighs
162 pounds and stands 5 feet
inches, and is 21 years of age.
PECK.
Edward Lawrence Peck completes
the trio of forwards who will take
care of the front rank in the Big Game.
His aggressive playing has often won
him applause, and his tackling is al
ways a feature of every rugby match
on the turf. Steady perseverance on
his part won him the place of substi
tute last season, and this year we find
him an acknowledged Varsity man.
Peck is a member of the class of 1913,
and is a candidate for a degree in Me
chanical Engineering. He belongs to

W ATKINS.
Frederick Bradshaw Watkins lias
been tried at lock, but fits most natur
ally in the side rank. He is a factor
in the scrum to be reckoned with, and
is very skillful in heeling the ball out

to the halfback,
Equal ly ag
gressive an d
powerful in the
defense, Wat
kins will prove
a great asset
in Stanford's
scoring Satur
day. His home
town is Los

high school. He
filled the post of

side rank in the 1914 Freshman team,
and was awarded his block "S" in
football when he replaced Gard at
breakaway in the intercollegiate con
test of 1911. He substituted at for
ward last year, and this season finds
him again back in the Varsity ranks.
Watkins is a member of Encina club.
Age, 24; height, 6 feet 1 inch; weight,
173 pounds.
LACHMUND.
Up till the last moment the position
of second five eighths has been in
doubt. Otto Gray Lachmund, a Fresh
man star, has out-distanced a strong
field of competitors, and is named for
the post in the final lineup. Accurate
kicking and speed in the passing rush
es has distinguished Lachraund's play
throughout the season, and he well
merits the honor which has been con
ferred upon him. lie prepared in Palo
Alto high school, and for several years
was one of the mainstays of the fast
rugby team there. His home is in Palo
Alto, and he is studying for the legal
profession. Lachmund belongs to the
Alpha Tan Omega fraternity, is IS
years of age, 5 feet 9'/j inches in
height, and weighs 153 pounds.
URBAN.
The only first year man to be chos
en on last year's Varsity, Joseph
Charles Urban, is again included on
the lineup as wing three quarters. At

all times playing
where he is need
ed, Urban fre
quently cuts loose
for a long run
or a brilliant
kick, and furn
ishes many thrills
in every contest
in which he is
entered. He cap
tained 1910's
Freshman team,
and before that
])la ye d several
years of rugby
at Mountain View
high school. His

home is in Hamilton City, and he maj
ors.in Botany. He is the lightest man
011 the team, weighing only a scant
150 pounds, but he makes up for his

lack of weight in speed on the turf.
He is 22 years of age, and 5 feet 9'/j
inches tall.
ANDREWS.
Helmus Weddel Andrews has figur
ed prominently this year in the back
field, and after being tried at five
eighths and center three quarters, his
natural aptitude for the fullback posi
tion was found. His defense is unusu
al, as he is an exceptional tackier, and
his kicks to touch are of a high order.
Andrews played the old game at San
Hiego high school and at Pomona Col
lege, but easily shifted to the English
game when he came to Stanford. He
registers in the Law department from
San Diego, and is a member of Kappa
Alpha fraternity. Age, 21; weight,
168; height, 5 feet 9>2 inches.
REEVES.
The ability of an old-timer to "come
back" is well illustrated this year in
the selection of Frank Wixon Reeves
for wing three quarters. He made the

Varsity in his
Freshman year,
playing at the
post of second five
eighths. Last year
ho substituted for
the team, and this
year displayed his
o 1 d-t im e form,
beating out sever
al clever aspir
ants for the honor.

Reeves' playing in the pinches is the
notable feature of his skill, and for
following up the ball, the veteran is
on the highest plane of efficiency. He
lives in San Bernardino, and played
four years of rugby for the high school
there before coming to Stanford.
Reeves is enrolled in Sigma Xu fra
ternity and is taking a Geology and
Mining course in the University. His
weight is IGI pounds, his height ">
feet 10 inches, and he is 21 years of
age.
AUSTIN.
Charles Alphin Austin, one of the
most prominent wearers of the Fresh
man caps, has occupied the place of
first five-eights throughout the sea
son, and will be a very dangerous op
ponent of the Blue and Gold next
Saturday. His speed and stragetic
skill earned him a place on the All-
Star team last fall, when he was the
American first five.
He prepared at Berkeley high
school, from which city he registers,
and is making Civil Engineering his
study in college. Theta Delta Chi is
his fraternity. Comparatively light in

relation to his activity, he weighs 156
pounds, is 5 feet 9 1-2 inches in height,
and is 21 years of age.
WINES.
Blaine L. Wines will oppose Cali
fornia in one of the front rank posi
tions. One of the heaviest men on the
team, he is a bulwark of strength
against the opponents' attack. He
won the block "15" as front ranker on
his Freshman team, and his ability
and marked improvement during the
present season have shown him to be
the logical man for the place. His
home is in Ruby Valley, Nevada.
Wines is a member of Sigma Alpha
Epsilon, and registers in the Geology
department. He weighs 184 pounds,
stands 5 l'eet 10 1-2 inches, and is 22

Frank W.Kccves'l!
The 1913 Stanford Varsity is an
nounced. The value of fifteen men,
proved in the grilling workout of a
long preparatory season, has entitled
them to wear the Cardinal jersey
against California next Saturday. Six
veterans, tried and found worthy in
past contests, will measure courage
and skill against six veterans of the
Blue and Gold. Two Freshmen have
earned positions in the lineup, while
the other seven players come from the
ranks of those who received their
rugby education in former seasons.
Many of the places on the team have
been closely contested. Others have
been fairly won since the early part
of the year. The decisive showing
made by the candidates this week has
enabled Coach Brown to choose the
team that is best fitted to guard the
Cardinal honor in the twenty-third
Intercollegiate match.
Erb assumes the responsibility of
play at half, the position which has
been the most closely debated during
the final weeks of practice. His dem
onstration of skill, speed, and nerve
during the time of probation has se
cured him the berth. In other re
spects, the lineup represents the nat
ural process of selection that has been
anticipated by followers of the season
at Stanford. It is the best that the
squad could offer, and will be a credit
to the Cardinal.
The total weight average of the
Stanford fifteen is 16411-15 pounds,
as opposed to 100 pounds even weight
of the California ruggers. In the
scrum the Cardinal also has an ad
vantage of one eighth pound, the aver
age being 170 2-8 pounds. Steinhart's
superior weight is a surprise to many
rugby fans who have followed the for
tunes of both Varsities. The drop in
California's weight is due to the fact
that Lockhart, who has made a strong
bid for the Blue and Gold scrum, has
yielded his place and two hundred
odd pounds weight to a much lighter
player.
Those fifteen fortunates who will
oppose California are biographed be

will prove a great factor in Saturday's
contest. He gained his knowledge of
the sport at St. Aloysius College, in
Sydney, and subsequently played great
ball for the St. George, New South
Wales, and All-Australia rugby clubs.
"Danny" is a member of Sigma Alpha
Epsilon and majors in Civil Engineer
ing. He is 5 feet 9 1 / 2 inches in height,

24 years of age, and weighs 164
pounds.
DARSIE.
William Pettigrew Darsie, field cap
tain in the absence of Captain James
Thoburn, is the only man fast enough
to serve as teammate for Gard in the

breakaway posi
tion. Always in
the thick of the
contest, he rarely
loses sight of the
ball, and leaves
nothing to be de
sired in his work
in rear rank. Ho
hails from the
nearby college
town and took a
thorough course
in rugby at the
Palo Alto high
school, on whose
football teams he

starred for several years. Darsie
played wing forward on the 1914
Freshman team, and was one of the
pack that combatted the Blue and
Gold in the muddy fight last Novem
ber. His fraternity is Phi Kappa Psi;
he is 22 years of age, 5 feet 11 inches
tall, and weighs 158 pounds.
BLASE.
Roland Roy Blase has proved his
ability to hold the scrum together
throughout the present season, and has
earned the right to play at lock In
consistent work in the preliminary
games. His height serves him in good
stead in the lineouts, and he figures
prominently in the dribbling rushes of
every contest. Blase attended high
school in St. Paul, Minnesota, where
rugby was an unknown quantity, but
his progress in learning the game has
been rapid. "Jumbo" registers from
North St. Paul, Minn., and is a Civil
Engineering major. His fraternity h -
Sigma Nu. Mlase is the heaviest mem
ber of the team, as he tops off the
scales at 191 pounds; his height is
6 feet 3 inches, and his age 27.
A. ERB.
The most hotly contested place on
the team has been that of halfback,
and in a nip and tuck battle all the
way Arthur Leslie Erb finally firoved
his superiority, and has been selected
by the coaches to direct the Stanford
scrum on the day of the Big Game.

The stocky back gets his passes out to
the backfield in double quick order,
and stops many a dangerous dribbling
rush of the opposing forwards by
timely faliing on the ball. Erb hails
from Tacoma, Washington, and gradu
ated from the high school of that city,
but he gained his previous knowledge
of rugby in the Victoria high school.
He filled the position of first five
eighths on the 1915 Freshman football
team, and substituted in the backfield
on last year's Varsity. Erb belongs to
Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity, and
is majoring in the Law department.
He weighs 155 pounds, is 21 years of
age, and stands 5 feet 9/> inches.
HALL.
Always fighting, and fighting hard,
Elwin Benoni Hall merits his position
as front, ranker. Equally dexterous
in the lineout and in the scrum, in
dribbling and in passing, Hall stands

out as one of the
most versatile
P layers on the
Stanford Varsity.
He filled the wing
position on the
1914 Fresh m an
team, but has
since found the
forwar d berth
more to his liking,
and was last year
included as front
ranker in the final
lineup.
Hall is a mem
ber of Skull and
Snakes honor so-

ciety, and Beta Theta Pi fraternity. He
is majoring in Geology and Mining,
and registers from Los Angeles.
Hall is 22 years of age, is 5 feet
9 3-4 inches in height, and weighs 163
pounds.
CLOVER.
From the start of the season, Philip
Petrie Clover made a strong bid for
middle rank, and the final lineup finds
him in the position, tlis energy in the
lineouts, his skill at dribbling, and his
tackles have shown him to be worthy
of his place. Clover starred on the
1914 Freshman team as side ranker,
and substituted last year on the Var
sity. He belongs to Quadrangle club,
Skull and Snakes, and Delta Kappa
Epsilon. He registers from Pasadena

iii the Civil Engineering department.
Clover is 21 years of age, 5 feet 11
inches in height, and weighs 16S.
GARD.
Frank Jacob Card, our phenomenal
breakaway, is completing his third
year on the Varsity. Probably the
best man in his position on the Coast,
teammate

Darsie, will
give m ore
trou ble to
Card and his
the Blue and
Golrl f o r
wards than
any other
p 1 a yers on
the Stanford
tea m. He
played in the
scrum on the
All-Star team
that held the
A u s t ralians
to such a close

score last year at Berkeley. He comes
from Glendora, but received no rugby
experience until his Freshman year,
when he earned his '14 as rear ranker
on the first year team. He is a mem
ber of Skull and Snakes and Phi Gam
ma Delta fraternity, and registers in
the Chemistry department. He weighs
162 pounds and stands 5 feet
inches, and is 21 years of age.
PECK.
Edward Lawrence Peck completes
the trio of forwards who will take
care of the front rank in the Big Game.
His aggressive playing has often won
him applause, and his tackling is al
ways a feature of every rugby match
on the turf. Steady perseverance on
his part won him the place of substi
tute last season, and this year we find
him an acknowledged Varsity man.
Peck is a member of the class of 1913,
and is a candidate for a degree in Me
chanical Engineering. He belongs to

W ATKINS.
Frederick Bradshaw Watkins lias
been tried at lock, but fits most natur
ally in the side rank. He is a factor
in the scrum to be reckoned with, and
is very skillful in heeling the ball out

to the halfback,
Equal ly ag
gressive an d
powerful in the
defense, Wat
kins will prove
a great asset
in Stanford's
scoring Satur
day. His home
town is Los
Angeles, where
he attended the
Los Angeles
P o 1 y t e c h nic
high school. He
filled the post of

side rank in the 1914 Freshman team,
and was awarded his block "S" in
football when he replaced Gard at
breakaway in the intercollegiate con
test of 1911. He substituted at for
ward last year, and this season finds
him again back in the Varsity ranks.
Watkins is a member of Encina club.
Age, 24; height, 6 feet 1 inch; weight,
173 pounds.
LACHMUND.
Up till the last moment the position
of second five eighths has been in
doubt. Otto Gray Lachmund, a Fresh
man star, has out-distanced a strong
field of competitors, and is named for
the post in the final lineup. Accurate
kicking and speed in the passing rush
es has distinguished Lachraund's play
throughout the season, and he well
merits the honor which has been con
ferred upon him. lie prepared in Palo
Alto high school, and for several years
was one of the mainstays of the fast
rugby team there. His home is in Palo
Alto, and he is studying for the legal
profession. Lachmund belongs to the
Alpha Tan Omega fraternity, is IS
years of age, 5 feet 9'/j inches in
height, and weighs 153 pounds.
URBAN.
The only first year man to be chos
en on last year's Varsity, Joseph
Charles Urban, is again included on
the lineup as wing three quarters. At

all times playing
where he is need
ed, Urban fre
quently cuts loose
for a long run
or a brilliant
kick, and furn
ishes many thrills
in every contest
in which he is
entered. He cap
tained 1910's
Freshman team,
and before that
])la ye d several
years of rugby
at Mountain View
high school. His

home is in Hamilton City, and he maj
ors.in Botany. He is the lightest man
011 the team, weighing only a scant
150 pounds, but he makes up for his

lack of weight in speed on the turf.
He is 22 years of age, and 5 feet 9'/j
inches tall.
ANDREWS.
Helmus Weddel Andrews has figur
ed prominently this year in the back
field, and after being tried at five
eighths and center three quarters, his
natural aptitude for the fullback posi
tion was found. His defense is unusu
al, as he is an exceptional tackier, and
his kicks to touch are of a high order.
Andrews played the old game at San
Hiego high school and at Pomona Col
lege, but easily shifted to the English
game when he came to Stanford. He
registers in the Law department from
San Diego, and is a member of Kappa
Alpha fraternity. Age, 21; weight,
168; height, 5 feet 9>2 inches.
REEVES.
The ability of an old-timer to "come
back" is well illustrated this year in
the selection of Frank Wixon Reeves
for wing three quarters. He made the

Varsity in his
Freshman year,
playing at the
post of second five
eighths. Last year
ho substituted for
the team, and this
year displayed his
o 1 d-t im e form,
beating out sever
al clever aspir
ants for the honor.

Reeves' playing in the pinches is the
notable feature of his skill, and for
following up the ball, the veteran is
on the highest plane of efficiency. He
lives in San Bernardino, and played
four years of rugby for the high school
there before coming to Stanford.
Reeves is enrolled in Sigma Xu fra
ternity and is taking a Geology and
Mining course in the University. His
weight is IGI pounds, his height ">
feet 10 inches, and he is 21 years of
age.
AUSTIN.
Charles Alphin Austin, one of the
most prominent wearers of the Fresh
man caps, has occupied the place of
first five-eights throughout the sea
son, and will be a very dangerous op
ponent of the Blue and Gold next
Saturday. His speed and stragetic
skill earned him a place on the All-
Star team last fall, when he was the
American first five.
He prepared at Berkeley high
school, from which city he registers,
and is making Civil Engineering his
study in college. Theta Delta Chi is
his fraternity. Comparatively light in

relation to his activity, he weighs 156
pounds, is 5 feet 9 1-2 inches in height,
and is 21 years of age.
WINES.
Blaine L. Wines will oppose Cali
fornia in one of the front rank posi
tions. One of the heaviest men on the
team, he is a bulwark of strength
against the opponents' attack. He
won the block "15" as front ranker on
his Freshman team, and his ability
and marked improvement during the
present season have shown him to be
the logical man for the place. His
home is in Ruby Valley, Nevada.
Wines is a member of Sigma Alpha
Epsilon, and registers in the Geology
department. He weighs 184 pounds,
stands 5 l'eet 10 1-2 inches, and is 22

Frank W.Kccves'l!
The 1913 Stanford Varsity is an
nounced. The value of fifteen men,
proved in the grilling workout of a
long preparatory season, has entitled
them to wear the Cardinal jersey
against California next Saturday. Six
veterans, tried and found worthy in
past contests, will measure courage
and skill against six veterans of the
Blue and Gold. Two Freshmen have
earned positions in the lineup, while
the other seven players come from the
ranks of those who received their
rugby education in former seasons.
Many of the places on the team have
been closely contested. Others have
been fairly won since the early part
of the year. The decisive showing
made by the candidates this week has
enabled Coach Brown to choose the
team that is best fitted to guard the
Cardinal honor in the twenty-third
Intercollegiate match.
Erb assumes the responsibility of
play at half, the position which has
been the most closely debated during
the final weeks of practice. His dem
onstration of skill, speed, and nerve
during the time of probation has se
cured him the berth. In other re
spects, the lineup represents the nat
ural process of selection that has been
anticipated by followers of the season
at Stanford. It is the best that the
squad could offer, and will be a credit
to the Cardinal.
The total weight average of the
Stanford fifteen is 16411-15 pounds,
as opposed to 100 pounds even weight
of the California ruggers. In the
scrum the Cardinal also has an ad
vantage of one eighth pound, the aver
age being 170 2-8 pounds. Steinhart's
superior weight is a surprise to many
rugby fans who have followed the for
tunes of both Varsities. The drop in
California's weight is due to the fact
that Lockhart, who has made a strong
bid for the Blue and Gold scrum, has
yielded his place and two hundred
odd pounds weight to a much lighter
player.
Those fifteen fortunates who will
oppose California are biographed be
low'.
CARROLL.
Daniel Brendan Carroll at his posi
tion of center three quarters, locks the
backfield together with his masterly
handling of the ball. An Australian
by birth, he accompanied the team
from the Antipodes last year and play
ed brilliantly even in that aggregation
of rugby experts. He is well versed in
every department of the game, and
will prove a great factor in Saturday's
contest. He gained his knowledge of
the sport at St. Aloysius College, in
Sydney, and subsequently played great
ball for the St. George, New South
Wales, and All-Australia rugby clubs.

William Pettigrew Darsie, field cap
tain in the absence of Captain James
Thoburn, is the only man fast enough
to serve as teammate for Gard in the

breakaway posi
tion. Always in
the thick of the
contest, he rarely
loses sight of the
ball, and leaves
nothing to be de
sired in his work
in rear rank. Ho
hails from the
nearby college
town and took a
thorough course
in rugby at the
Palo Alto high
school, on whose
football teams he

starred for several years. Darsie
played wing forward on the 1914
Freshman team, and was one of the
pack that combatted the Blue and
Gold in the muddy fight last Novem
ber. His fraternity is Phi Kappa Psi;
he is 22 years of age, 5 feet 11 inches
tall, and weighs 158 pounds.
BLASE.
Roland Roy Blase has proved his
ability to hold the scrum together
throughout the present season, and has
earned the right to play at lock In
consistent work in the preliminary
games. His height serves him in good
stead in the lineouts, and he figures
prominently in the dribbling rushes of
every contest. Blase attended high
school in St. Paul, Minnesota, where
rugby was an unknown quantity, but
his progress in learning the game has
been rapid. "Jumbo" registers from
North St. Paul, Minn., and is a Civil
Engineering major. His fraternity h -
Sigma Nu. Mlase is the heaviest mem
ber of the team, as he tops off the
scales at 191 pounds; his height is
6 feet 3 inches, and his age 27.
A. ERB.
The most hotly contested place on
the team has been that of halfback,
and in a nip and tuck battle all the
way Arthur Leslie Erb finally firoved
his superiority, and has been selected
by the coaches to direct the Stanford
scrum on the day of the Big Game.

The stocky back gets his passes out to
the backfield in double quick order,
and stops many a dangerous dribbling
rush of the opposing forwards by
timely faliing on the ball. Erb hails
from Tacoma, Washington, and gradu
ated from the high school of that city,
but he gained his previous knowledge
of rugby in the Victoria high school.
He filled the position of first five
eighths on the 1915 Freshman football
team, and substituted in the backfield
on last year's Varsity. Erb belongs to
Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity, and
is majoring in the Law department.
He weighs 155 pounds, is 21 years of
age, and stands 5 feet 9/> inches.
HALL.
Always fighting, and fighting hard,
Elwin Benoni Hall merits his position
as front, ranker. Equally dexterous
in the lineout and in the scrum, in
dribbling and in passing, Hall stands

out as one of the
most versatile
P layers on the
Stanford Varsity.
He filled the wing
position on the
1914 Fresh m an
team, but has
since found the
forwar d berth
more to his liking,
and was last year
included as front
ranker in the final
lineup.
Hall is a mem
ber of Skull and
Snakes honor so-

ciety, and Beta Theta Pi fraternity. He
is majoring in Geology and Mining,
and registers from Los Angeles.
Hall is 22 years of age, is 5 feet
9 3-4 inches in height, and weighs 163
pounds.
CLOVER.
From the start of the season, Philip
Petrie Clover made a strong bid for
middle rank, and the final lineup finds
him in the position, tlis energy in the
lineouts, his skill at dribbling, and his
tackles have shown him to be worthy
of his place. Clover starred on the
1914 Freshman team as side ranker,
and substituted last year on the Var
sity. He belongs to Quadrangle club,
Skull and Snakes, and Delta Kappa
Epsilon. He registers from Pasadena

iii the Civil Engineering department.
Clover is 21 years of age, 5 feet 11
inches in height, and weighs 16S.
GARD.
Frank Jacob Card, our phenomenal
breakaway, is completing his third
year on the Varsity. Probably the
best man in his position on the Coast,
teammate

Darsie, will
give m ore
trou ble to
Card and his
the Blue and
Golrl f o r
wards than
any other
p 1 a yers on
the Stanford
tea m. He
played in the
scrum on the
All-Star team
that held the
A u s t ralians
to such a close

score last year at Berkeley. He comes
from Glendora, but received no rugby
experience until his Freshman year,
when he earned his '14 as rear ranker
on the first year team. He is a mem
ber of Skull and Snakes and Phi Gam
ma Delta fraternity, and registers in
the Chemistry department. He weighs
162 pounds and stands 5 feet
inches, and is 21 years of age.
PECK.
Edward Lawrence Peck completes
the trio of forwards who will take
care of the front rank in the Big Game.
His aggressive playing has often won
him applause, and his tackling is al
ways a feature of every rugby match
on the turf. Steady perseverance on
his part won him the place of substi
tute last season, and this year we find
him an acknowledged Varsity man.
Peck is a member of the class of 1913,
and is a candidate for a degree in Me
chanical Engineering. He belongs to

W ATKINS.
Frederick Bradshaw Watkins lias
been tried at lock, but fits most natur
ally in the side rank. He is a factor
in the scrum to be reckoned with, and
is very skillful in heeling the ball out

to the halfback,
Equal ly ag
gressive an d
powerful in the
defense, Wat
kins will prove
a great asset
in Stanford's
scoring Satur
day. His home
town is Los
Angeles, where
he attended the
Los Angeles
P o 1 y t e c h nic
high school. He
filled the post of

side rank in the 1914 Freshman team,
and was awarded his block "S" in
football when he replaced Gard at
breakaway in the intercollegiate con
test of 1911. He substituted at for
ward last year, and this season finds
him again back in the Varsity ranks.
Watkins is a member of Encina club.
Age, 24; height, 6 feet 1 inch; weight,
173 pounds.
LACHMUND.
Up till the last moment the position
of second five eighths has been in
doubt. Otto Gray Lachmund, a Fresh
man star, has out-distanced a strong
field of competitors, and is named for
the post in the final lineup. Accurate
kicking and speed in the passing rush
es has distinguished Lachraund's play
throughout the season, and he well
merits the honor which has been con
ferred upon him. lie prepared in Palo
Alto high school, and for several years
was one of the mainstays of the fast
rugby team there. His home is in Palo
Alto, and he is studying for the legal
profession. Lachmund belongs to the
Alpha Tan Omega fraternity, is IS
years of age, 5 feet 9'/j inches in
height, and weighs 153 pounds.
URBAN.
The only first year man to be chos
en on last year's Varsity, Joseph
Charles Urban, is again included on
the lineup as wing three quarters. At

all times playing
where he is need
ed, Urban fre
quently cuts loose
for a long run
or a brilliant
kick, and furn
ishes many thrills
in every contest
in which he is
entered. He cap
tained 1910's
Freshman team,
and before that
])la ye d several
years of rugby
at Mountain View
high school. His

home is in Hamilton City, and he maj
ors.in Botany. He is the lightest man
011 the team, weighing only a scant
150 pounds, but he makes up for his

lack of weight in speed on the turf.
He is 22 years of age, and 5 feet 9'/j
inches tall.
ANDREWS.
Helmus Weddel Andrews has figur
ed prominently this year in the back
field, and after being tried at five
eighths and center three quarters, his
natural aptitude for the fullback posi
tion was found. His defense is unusu
al, as he is an exceptional tackier, and
his kicks to touch are of a high order.
Andrews played the old game at San
Hiego high school and at Pomona Col
lege, but easily shifted to the English
game when he came to Stanford. He
registers in the Law department from
San Diego, and is a member of Kappa
Alpha fraternity. Age, 21; weight,
168; height, 5 feet 9>2 inches.
REEVES.
The ability of an old-timer to "come
back" is well illustrated this year in
the selection of Frank Wixon Reeves
for wing three quarters. He made the

Varsity in his
Freshman year,
playing at the
post of second five
eighths. Last year
ho substituted for
the team, and this
year displayed his
o 1 d-t im e form,
beating out sever
al clever aspir
ants for the honor.

Reeves' playing in the pinches is the
notable feature of his skill, and for
following up the ball, the veteran is
on the highest plane of efficiency. He
lives in San Bernardino, and played
four years of rugby for the high school
there before coming to Stanford.
Reeves is enrolled in Sigma Xu fra
ternity and is taking a Geology and
Mining course in the University. His
weight is IGI pounds, his height ">
feet 10 inches, and he is 21 years of
age.
AUSTIN.
Charles Alphin Austin, one of the
most prominent wearers of the Fresh
man caps, has occupied the place of
first five-eights throughout the sea
son, and will be a very dangerous op
ponent of the Blue and Gold next
Saturday. His speed and stragetic
skill earned him a place on the All-
Star team last fall, when he was the
American first five.
He prepared at Berkeley high
school, from which city he registers,
and is making Civil Engineering his
study in college. Theta Delta Chi is
his fraternity. Comparatively light in

relation to his activity, he weighs 156
pounds, is 5 feet 9 1-2 inches in height,
and is 21 years of age.
WINES.
Blaine L. Wines will oppose Cali
fornia in one of the front rank posi
tions. One of the heaviest men on the
team, he is a bulwark of strength
against the opponents' attack. He
won the block "15" as front ranker on
his Freshman team, and his ability
and marked improvement during the
present season have shown him to be
the logical man for the place. His
home is in Ruby Valley, Nevada.
Wines is a member of Sigma Alpha
Epsilon, and registers in the Geology
department. He weighs 184 pounds,
stands 5 l'eet 10 1-2 inches, and is 22

Frank W.Kccves'l!
The 1913 Stanford Varsity is an
nounced. The value of fifteen men,
proved in the grilling workout of a
long preparatory season, has entitled
them to wear the Cardinal jersey
against California next Saturday. Six
veterans, tried and found worthy in
past contests, will measure courage
and skill against six veterans of the
Blue and Gold. Two Freshmen have
earned positions in the lineup, while
the other seven players come from the
ranks of those who received their
rugby education in former seasons.
Many of the places on the team have
been closely contested. Others have
been fairly won since the early part
of the year. The decisive showing
made by the candidates this week has
enabled Coach Brown to choose the
team that is best fitted to guard the
Cardinal honor in the twenty-third
Intercollegiate match.
Erb assumes the responsibility of
play at half, the position which has
been the most closely debated during
the final weeks of practice. His dem
onstration of skill, speed, and nerve
during the time of probation has se
cured him the berth. In other re
spects, the lineup represents the nat
ural process of selection that has been
anticipated by followers of the season
at Stanford. It is the best that the
squad could offer, and will be a credit
to the Cardinal.
The total weight average of the
Stanford fifteen is 16411-15 pounds,
as opposed to 100 pounds even weight
of the California ruggers. In the
scrum the Cardinal also has an ad
vantage of one eighth pound, the aver
age being 170 2-8 pounds. Steinhart's
superior weight is a surprise to many
rugby fans who have followed the for
tunes of both Varsities. The drop in
California's weight is due to the fact
that Lockhart, who has made a strong
bid for the Blue and Gold scrum, has
yielded his place and two hundred
odd pounds weight to a much lighter
player.
Those fifteen fortunates who will
oppose California are biographed be
low'.
CARROLL.
Daniel Brendan Carroll at his posi
tion of center three quarters, locks the
backfield together with his masterly
handling of the ball. An Australian
by birth, he accompanied the team
from the Antipodes last year and play
ed brilliantly even in that aggregation
of rugby experts. He is well versed in
every department of the game, and
will prove a great factor in Saturday's
contest. He gained his knowledge of
the sport at St. Aloysius College, in
Sydney, and subsequently played great
ball for the St. George, New South
Wales, and All-Australia rugby clubs.
"Danny" is a member of Sigma Alpha
Epsilon and majors in Civil Engineer

24 years of age, and weighs 164
pounds.
