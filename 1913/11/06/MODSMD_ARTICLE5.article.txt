# The
						Fifteen
## 
### 
After long weeks of faithful prac
tice the 1913 Stanford Varsity has
been named for the annual intercol
legiate match on Saturday. Power-

ful, speedy, well balanced,
thorough exponents of the
Rugby game, the fifteen which
has been selected to repre-

sent the Cardinal on Saturday is one
which any institution may well feel
proud of. The selection of the team
is based on the showing of the men
during the preliminary season and the
players were chosen after an exhaus
tive consideration of their respective
abilities.
To the men who are not included in
the list of those who are to play on
Saturday but who made such a mag
nificant Rugby unit possible by their
unselfish devotion to the team must
go an additional mead of praise. It
is largely due to their efforts that thn
team has rounded into a combination
which has the confidence of the stu
dent body. Stanford is satisfied with
the men named for the twenty-third
intercollegiate match.
