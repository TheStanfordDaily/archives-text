Moved and carried that the follow
ing be adopted: "Resolved, That the
number of Freshmen football sweaters
granted each year be 18, —this number
to be based on season's showing."
Moved and carried that the follow
ing be adopted: "Resolved, That any
one found scalping tickets be refused
admission to all future games, and
membership in Associated Students be
cancelled."
Adjourned.
