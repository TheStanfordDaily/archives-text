Injury resulting from a hard tackle
received in the Barbarian game of

long to get back
into condition to
lead the varsity

During the last
week Jimmy has
reported for the
final workout in a
suit, l> u t the
111 011 th off the
field lias been too
severe a handi
cap to be offset.
Twice Thoburn
has qualified for
his "S," both in
his Sophomore

and Senior years.
and the misfortune which keeps him
from this year's intercollegiate is a
widespread disappointment to Stan

Remarkable versatility in rugby art
is shown by the fact that lie played
right wing 011 the varsity of 1910 and
breakaway last season.
Thoburn's home is in Palo Alto and
