Following the disturbance of the re
cent Plug Ugly there is still a great
deal of unrest and there may lie an
uncertainty in the minds of some as
to I he attitude of Student control on
the occasion of the Big Game.
To me it seems that this is the most
critical period in the life of self-gov
ernment and the utmost precautions
should he taken that nothing happens
in this period of intense excitement
that may in any way act as a detri
ment to the system. It means that
each student must realize that he is
absolutely responsible for his own
acls and that he will be so held. To
most men it is needless to give words
of advice in such a matter, and in fact
this is not meant to be anything more
than a word to ask everyone to coop
erate toward keeping up a high stand
ard of ideals and conduct.
Let us remember that we ane still
men and not do anything which would
hurt us in our own self-respect, for
individually I am sure that we feel
very much the same in matters of
good conduct.
