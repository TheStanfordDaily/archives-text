# OPINIONS ON TOMORROW'S GAME WITH BLUE AND GOLD AS GATHERED FROM MEN CONNECTED WITH THE TURF
## FORMER VARSITY MEN EXPECT A HARD-WON VICTORY TOMORROW Stanford Alumni. John O. Miller, '08. 
### 
if the Stanford forwards can stand
California's attack, the game will be
won by the backs in the last fifteen
minutes.
E. F. Kern, 'IS.
The result of the whole game de
pends on our forwards. If they can
hold their own and get the ball out
to our backs 1 believe that we will win
by a good margin.
Ac, 31. Sanborn, 'I*2.
â€¢ I believe we will win the game to
morrow because our team will be fit.
1 have now seen a number of Stan
ford teams oppose California, but I
have never seen one that did not give
all it had. They have always had the
spirit, but only too often that spirit
has been handicapped by the lack of
physical endurance.
It has been said by visiting teams
that our team does not show the fight
against them that is evinced by Cali
fornia. This is not because we have
not that quality, but because the oc
casion does not happen to bring out
their intensity of feeling. Will the
Big Game do this? I say it WILL.
K. L. Sehaupp, '12.
If anyone thinks that Stanford will
be easily taken into camp he is badly
mistaken. On the other hand if he
thinks that we will have an easy vic
tory he is again mistaken. The team
from across the bay is a mighty strong
one, and will give the Cardinal
ruggers all that they can do, but I
feel from having played against Stan
ford and having watched California
that our men are just a little more
than equal to the occasion.
It has been the comment of many
that California fights harder than we
do, yet they must realize that we of
Stanford never fight so hard as when
we face our old rival. Then, too, any
one who has played on our field
against the team will not have an idea
that it does not fight. So far, however,
the fight has been of a different kind,
a kind that has not been noticeable for
the same reasons that makes some
fighters noticeable. Stanford is play
ing a more open game, more a game of
the backs, while that of U. C. is es
sentially one of the forwards. The
speed of our forward division will
make up for what they lack in weight.
The game will, I think, be very
close, and Stanford will be returned
the victor by only two or three points.
