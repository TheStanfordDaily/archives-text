# "DAILY CALIFORNIAN" WRITER EXPECTS HIS TEAM TO TAKE GAME

California expects to win tomorrow.
It is not a mere feeling of "we have
not been defeated for four years, and
we are naturally going to win," that
animates the Blue and Gold support
ers. The California students know
their team, and they feel that it is
capable of winning the victory which
did not come last year.
At the beginning of the present sea
son the prospects for a final victory
were none too bright. Eight veterans
ot the scrum came back, but almost
the entire veteran backfleld, which
had gone through so many winning
battles, had been lost. So Californi
ans resigned themselves to a forward
game. For six weeks the Varsity
went through as many practice games
and failed to show the winning Big
Game form.
But then one Saturday the bleach
ers awoke to the fact that a real team
was being built under their eyes. That
was in the Varsity-California Club
game on October 18. Then five days
later came the All Black Game. The
fight put up by the Varsity in that en
counter aroused the whole University,
The forwards performed in even bet
ter form than usual, and were fighting
and on the ball every minute. But it
was the backs who gave the great sur»
prise. The way they passed and ran
and dodged rivaled even the renown
ed All Blacks. It was like a veteran
back field, and yet with all the snap
and speed of youth.
That game showed Californians
what their team could do. "If you
play like that on November 8 there
will only be one team in the game,"
said a number of the All Blacks. But
California knows that Stanford never
reaches her top notch form until the
day of the Big Game, and they took
the compliment with a grain of salt.
Stanford has a great backfield, but
California thinks that she will not
suffer to a great extent even if the
ball does get out behind the scrum.
Her backs are, for the most part, new
men, but they are fighters and they
know some rugby, too.
Contrary to most reports, Califor
nia does not badly outweigh Stanfor 1
in the scrum. Taking an average of
the eight men who will probably rep
resent the Blue and Gold the weight
is 169.7 lb. Stanford's average taken
in the same way gives her men a
weight of IGB lb. each. That Califor
nia's forwards have shown up far bet
ter than Stanford's is an acknowledg
ed fact.
No one can tell how the stress of
California-Stanford competition will
affect either team. But as the "dope"
now stands the victory should be Cali
fornia's.

is 169.7 lb. Stanford's average taken
in the same way gives her men a
weight of IGB lb. each. That Califor
nia's forwards have shown up far bet
ter than Stanford's is an acknowledg
ed fact.
No one can tell how the stress of
California-Stanford competition will
affect either team. But as the "dope"
now stands the victory should be Cali
fornia's.
11. 1.. Dunn, i'. I'.. '15.
California expects to win tomorrow.
It is not a mere feeling of "we have
not been defeated for four years, and
we are naturally going to win," that
animates the Blue and Gold support
ers. The California students know
their team, and they feel that it is
capable of winning the victory which
did not come last year.
At the beginning of the present sea
son the prospects for a final victory
were none too bright. Eight veterans
ot the scrum came back, but almost
the entire veteran backfleld, which
had gone through so many winning
battles, had been lost. So Californi
ans resigned themselves to a forward
game. For six weeks the Varsity
went through as many practice games
and failed to show the winning Big
Game form.
But then one Saturday the bleach
ers awoke to the fact that a real team
was being built under their eyes. That
was in the Varsity-California Club
game on October 18. Then five days
later came the All Black Game. The
fight put up by the Varsity in that en
counter aroused the whole University,
The forwards performed in even bet
ter form than usual, and were fighting
and on the ball every minute. But it
was the backs who gave the great sur»
prise. The way they passed and ran
and dodged rivaled even the renown
ed All Blacks. It was like a veteran
back field, and yet with all the snap
and speed of youth.
That game showed Californians
what their team could do. "If you
play like that on November 8 there
will only be one team in the game,"
said a number of the All Blacks. But
California knows that Stanford never
reaches her top notch form until the
day of the Big Game, and they took
the compliment with a grain of salt.
Stanford has a great backfield, but
California thinks that she will not
suffer to a great extent even if the
ball does get out behind the scrum.
Her backs are, for the most part, new
men, but they are fighters and they
know some rugby, too.
Contrary to most reports, Califor
nia does not badly outweigh Stanfor 1
in the scrum. Taking an average of
the eight men who will probably rep
resent the Blue and Gold the weight
is 169.7 lb. Stanford's average taken
in the same way gives her men a
weight of IGB lb. each. That Califor
nia's forwards have shown up far bet
