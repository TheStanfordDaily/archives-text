# Stanford Lines Up With Varsity in Final Rally
## 
### 
It took that crowd of cardinal hued
and brazen lunged enthusiasts that
packed the Assembly Hall to the up
per windows last night just fifty min
utes to let out enough surplus energy
to make further existence on this
campus possible. Uncounted scores
and hundreds of students, all the
members of the great Stanford fam
ily that were able to secure seats
or standing room, old grads who
make the annual sendoff to the chos
en varsity their one visit of the year
to the campus, strangers attracted
by association or curiosity, all these
and the rest stamped, whistled, cheer
ed, yelled and waved their greeting
to the Fifteen that is to fight for Stan
ford on the football turf Saturday,
and they kept it up until the most
skeptical felt that this year's was
an unusual spirit. That was not a
crowd that would "Ride with the
winner" whatever their first alleg
iance might be, and they proved it in
a way that left 110 room for doubt.
Long before the time set for the
first yell, the streams of humanity
began to filter into the Assembly Hall,
and the space in the gallery was
soon at a premium. The women of
the university had been given the

right of first entrance to that section,
and after the lower rows had been fill
ed the contingent from the nearby
towns packed the aisles to the farth
est corner.
On the main floor the rooters waited
long and impatiently for the arrival
of the serpentine from Encina and
for the first piece by the Band. The
yelling line of men from the hall
marched down to the stage on one
side, in swaying lockstep, clambered
up to the level of the foot lights and
swept across to the opposite side to
take their first places in the front
rows. Soon after the team and sub
stitutes entered the hall and pan
demonium reigned. Streamers from
the balcony, hats sailed toward the
ceiling, and a deafening roar greeted
the men who had been named as the
team, and the repeated injunctions of
the yell leaders against prolonged
cheering seemed about to be ignored.
Palmer Fuller Says "(Jotretem."
The first of six speakers to com
ment on the game prospects was Pal
mer Fuller, '10. A part of his remarks
was as follows:
"It seems to me that one of the most
important things that will make for
greater speed than lie is credited with
to stop the play of the Stanfordite.
In this position lies a great part of
Stanford's hope to win the day.
In Reeves and Urban are two wing
three-quarters that will rank with any
pair Stanford has ever named. Joe
Urban is one of the best players on
the field, has improved his game since
the last intercollegiate and will give
Hunt tlie time of his life along the
touch lines. Hunt is considered a
strong player. Frank Reeves has
played well in the preliminary games,
is speedy and has given the rooters
no worry as to his fitness for the po
sition. His opponent, Lane, is a
Sophomore at California and is an
unknown quantity.
Stanfordites are well satisfied with
affairs 011 the line of last defense, for
Andrews won the approbation of all
the enthusiasts in the last two games
on Stanford Field. Skinner may be
fairly good, but we don't think lie will
prove stronger than Andrews and we
put our bottom dollar on the Stan
fordite. If Peart were to play full it
would put a different complexion on
affairs, as he is undoubtedly a fine
fullback.
The varsity's playing after tlie exhi
bitions of artistic rugby had been giv
en by tlie All Blacks, was of a very list
less character and Glooms marched
onto the campus. Rut the game with
the Olympics on Saturday last was far
more encouraging to the team's
supporters than the score would indi
cate. With the odds against them at
first they fought tlie harder and dis
played team work that made the
bleacherites want to yell approval at
every step.

Long before the time set for the
first yell, the streams of humanity
began to filter into the Assembly Hall,
and the space in the gallery was
soon at a premium. The women of
the university had been given the

right of first entrance to that section,
and after the lower rows had been fill
ed the contingent from the nearby
towns packed the aisles to the farth
est corner.
On the main floor the rooters waited
long and impatiently for the arrival
of the serpentine from Encina and
for the first piece by the Band. The
yelling line of men from the hall
marched down to the stage on one
side, in swaying lockstep, clambered
up to the level of the foot lights and
swept across to the opposite side to
take their first places in the front
rows. Soon after the team and sub
stitutes entered the hall and pan
demonium reigned. Streamers from
the balcony, hats sailed toward the
ceiling, and a deafening roar greeted
the men who had been named as the
team, and the repeated injunctions of
the yell leaders against prolonged
cheering seemed about to be ignored.

was as follows:
"It seems to me that one of the most
important things that will make for
greater speed than lie is credited with
to stop the play of the Stanfordite.
In this position lies a great part of
Stanford's hope to win the day.
In Reeves and Urban are two wing
three-quarters that will rank with any
pair Stanford has ever named. Joe
Urban is one of the best players on
the field, has improved his game since
the last intercollegiate and will give
Hunt tlie time of his life along the
touch lines. Hunt is considered a
strong player. Frank Reeves has
played well in the preliminary games,
is speedy and has given the rooters
no worry as to his fitness for the po
sition. His opponent, Lane, is a
Sophomore at California and is an
unknown quantity.
Stanfordites are well satisfied with
affairs 011 the line of last defense, for
Andrews won the approbation of all
the enthusiasts in the last two games
on Stanford Field. Skinner may be
fairly good, but we don't think lie will
prove stronger than Andrews and we
put our bottom dollar on the Stan
fordite. If Peart were to play full it
would put a different complexion on
affairs, as he is undoubtedly a fine
fullback.
The varsity's playing after tlie exhi
bitions of artistic rugby had been giv
en by tlie All Blacks, was of a very list
less character and Glooms marched
onto the campus. Rut the game with
the Olympics on Saturday last was far
more encouraging to the team's
supporters than the score would indi
cate. With the odds against them at
first they fought tlie harder and dis
played team work that made the
bleacherites want to yell approval at
every step.
It took that crowd of cardinal hued
and brazen lunged enthusiasts that
packed the Assembly Hall to the up
per windows last night just fifty min
utes to let out enough surplus energy
to make further existence on this
campus possible. Uncounted scores
