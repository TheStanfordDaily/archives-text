# HOME TURF SHOULD TURN TIDE OF BATTLE FOR THE CARDINAL
## S.S. Simonson, '15.

The proverbial bet on the jump of j
the frog would be ;i wager placed on
a sure tliiug compared to speculation
on the coming intercollegiate contest.
With practically no definite basis for
comparison of strength in the season's
games at the two universities and
with a small proportion of veteran
players included in the lineups, the
college dopester, layman or player,
at a loss for speculative material. The
only method left to him is to conjec
ture on the relative merits and de
merits of the individual players in
their respective positions, and to pass [
judgment on their ability in combi
nation as shown in two or three of
the season's matches. Introduce a
possible outside influence or two, and
the prophecy is shaped.
Stanford coaches have named a
team to wear the cardinal that in
cludes only six veterans of the strain
and tension of an intercollegiate bat
tle. California is hardly superior in
this regard, as both teams depend
to a large degree upon men with lit
tle college experience on the football
field.
Injuries have not necessitated elev
enth hour changes as in past years,
both Blue and Gold and Cardinal
trainers have no excuses to make in
the matter of condition, and the thirty
players will undoubtedly go the
8o-minute stretch at their best pace.
Local "dopesters" and followers of
the game in the metropolis have giv
en the California scrum the edge on
the Cardinal pack. At first sight their
conclusion seems logical, as the Cali
fornia forwards are an experienced
and hard fighting eight, with Fen
stermacher in the front rank and
Saunders in the middle rank as the
two new players of the lot. How
ever. while conceding the place of
McKim and King in the first rank of
ruggers, the Cardinal supporters are
justified in the faith placed in the two
breakaways, Card and Darsie. These
two men have been at their top stride
throughout the season and it will take
a fast halfback to get the ball away to
the opposing line.
The halfback position is not the
stronghold of either team, nor does
either camp claim superiority.
Among the backs in any clime Aus
tin would be considered a heady
player, and the speedy five is often
brilliant in his attack. Opposing him
is Hazeltine, a California player that
did not prove especially strong last
year, but is said to have improved,
wonderfully this season. The Cardi
nal would seem to have the better of
the argument. The second five posi
tion is filled by Lachmund, a player
with little college experience, but one
that is gratifyingly steady in his work.
Tlis opponent in the line is Captain
Peart, the most versatile and proba
bly the best of the Blue and Gold rug
gers. He should prove dangerous to
Stanford.
Carroll is too well known through
his work on the field to require com
ment. Gianelli, the California center
three-quarters, will have to show |
