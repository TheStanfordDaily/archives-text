# HOME TURF SHOULD TURN TIDE OF BATTLE FOR THE CARDINAL
## S.S. Simonson, '15. 
### 
The proverbial bet on the jump of j
the frog would be ;i wager placed on
a sure tliiug compared to speculation
on the coming intercollegiate contest.
With practically no definite basis for
comparison of strength in the season's
games at the two universities and
with a small proportion of veteran
players included in the lineups, the
college dopester, layman or player,
at a loss for speculative material. The
only method left to him is to conjec
ture on the relative merits and de
merits of the individual players in
their respective positions, and to pass [
judgment on their ability in combi
nation as shown in two or three of
the season's matches. Introduce a
possible outside influence or two, and
the prophecy is shaped.
Stanford coaches have named a
team to wear the cardinal that in
cludes only six veterans of the strain
and tension of an intercollegiate bat
tle. California is hardly superior in
this regard, as both teams depend
to a large degree upon men with lit
tle college experience on the football
field.
Injuries have not necessitated elev
enth hour changes as in past years,
both Blue and Gold and Cardinal
trainers have no excuses to make in
the matter of condition, and the thirty
players will undoubtedly go the
8o-minute stretch at their best pace.
Local "dopesters" and followers of
the game in the metropolis have giv
en the California scrum the edge on
the Cardinal pack. At first sight their
conclusion seems logical, as the Cali
fornia forwards are an experienced
and hard fighting eight, with Fen
stermacher in the front rank and
Saunders in the middle rank as the
two new players of the lot. How
ever. while conceding the place of
McKim and King in the first rank of
ruggers, the Cardinal supporters are
justified in the faith placed in the two
breakaways, Card and Darsie. These
two men have been at their top stride
throughout the season and it will take
a fast halfback to get the ball away to
the opposing line.
The halfback position is not the
stronghold of either team, nor does
either camp claim superiority.
Among the backs in any clime Aus
tin would be considered a heady
player, and the speedy five is often
brilliant in his attack. Opposing him
is Hazeltine, a California player that
did not prove especially strong last
year, but is said to have improved,
wonderfully this season. The Cardi
nal would seem to have the better of
the argument. The second five posi
tion is filled by Lachmund, a player
with little college experience, but one
that is gratifyingly steady in his work.
Tlis opponent in the line is Captain
Peart, the most versatile and proba
bly the best of the Blue and Gold rug
gers. He should prove dangerous to
Stanford.
Carroll is too well known through
his work on the field to require com
ment. Gianelli, the California center
three-quarters, will have to show |
the success of the team next Saturday
will be the support of the bleachers,
all the time —every minute. The
coaches have done their work, the
trainer his; we have our own field
to play on, and we have Bill Hill, the
squarest and best referee in the
world. Every man on the team is go
ing to do his damnedest. It is up to you
fellows to do yours. If you do, the
team has a good chance to achieve
that which rain and mud kept it from
doing last year,—a victory, which
will start another long string of Stan
ford victories. A victory this year at
the conclusion of the term of the Ad
visory Coach will write the word "Vic
tory'' along side his name, as we
always have written fair and clean
sportsmanship. Gogetem!"
Stubby Slolz of Winged "0" Confident.
Stubby Stolz, '09, said:
"Any Stanford man is willing to get
up to express his faith in the Stan
ford team. You know the little ways
and tricks of play the team has de
veloped, and how it has developed
in headway and speed. Coaches
Brown and Presley, Dad Moulton
and Trainer Maloney have lain awako
nights thinking, until we have a team
that can go through seventy minutes
of hard fight to a victory.
"I have never seen a team that
could go harder from whistle to gun,
with the ability to come back, to score
when scores were necessary, and to
refrain from crabbing at the umpire
as the Stanford team can. The only
thing that Berkeley can do to win the
game Saturday is to be careful not to
score."
funha Speaks for Old Grads.
Next to express himself was Ed
Cunha, '06, who said:
"I am here as the representative
of that group of Stanford men that
was fortunate enough to attend here
six years, and to see six Stanford
teams go out on the firing line, with
out ever seeing one defeated. During
the last few weeks, as things have
warmed up to the Big Game, I have
been feeling around in common with
others of the Old Grads, and from
what we've been able to see and hear,
and knowing what Stanford men with
a fighting chance can do, we know
that, just as surely as the sun rises
next Saturday morning, just as sure
ly it will set on a Stanford victory."
Ilrown Declares Faith.
Floyd Brown, '11, field coach of the
1913 Varsity, made the following de
claration of faith:
"I should like to take this oppor
tunity to thank the entire squad, and
specially the second string men for
the spirit displayed this afternoon
when the team was announced. Too
much praise can't be given the men
who came out with the same loyalty
throughout the season, knowing that
there was little chance for personal
success.
"No critic can judge the outcome
of Saturday's game by comparing the
scores of the two teams made during
the season. Though the team is light,
it is a fast, scoring team. T have
no regrets, or excuses to offer. I have
every confidence in the men who will
represent us on the field Saturday."
Maloney Pronounces Team Fit.
Trainer Harry Maloney followed on
the list of speakers. He said in part:
"We are in the last, lap of prepar
ation for the game that is going to
take place on Saturday. Though only
a few men of last year's squad have
gone to make up the team, more men
have been out, and stayed out than

ever before. We are arrived at the
state we call fitness—fitness for any
thing we feel called on to do. Every
man should have the courage of his
convictions, and I do not hesitate to
place myself on record as saying that
our men are physically fit. Victory
is going to be ours next Saturday."
Coach Presley Charges Rooters.
"To my mind, if there's one thing
that shows a fighter, it is the courage
to fight whether things are going for
or against him. It takes a fighter to
stick when the tide is against him.
Any one can go with the tide of suc
cess. The same thing applies to the
bleachers. The whole world rides
with a winner, but it takes a bunch
with heart to fight in the face of dif
ficulty. Those who saw the team meet
the Olympics know that the team is
as good a fighting one as ever rep
resented Stanford or any other uni
versity. You saw that those fellows
were the kind of a team that gives
everything it has when luck is going
against it. No one can tell how a
game is going to go from the way
it starts. Don't wait for the team to
show you that it is going to win be
fore you get behind it. Brown has
done his part. If we ever get them
we've got to get them this year. Go
to it, and stay with it to the end."
