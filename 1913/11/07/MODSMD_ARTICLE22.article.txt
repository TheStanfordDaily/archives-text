# "EVEN BREAK" IS STATEMENT OF NEW ZEALAND EXPERT
## D.J. Guiney, New Zealand. 
### 
It is an even break. On the displays
given against the All Blacks Califor
nia would appear to be stronger for
ward, but in the first spell of that sec
ond game against the New Zealanders
tlie California team got away with a
lot of play that killed the All Blacks'
game and made their own work look
good, and this is not the sort of foot
ball that referee Billy hill will stand
tor tomorrow. Make your minds easy
on that point. Billy Hill is the best
mail for the job that you could have
got; he knows the game from A to Z,
and he will promptly call anything
that tends towards a repetition of
that second All Black game against
California.
1 am quite convinced that the Stan
ford team will show something to
morrow that will surprise a good
many people. I have seen Sehaeffer's
men fully extended, and they were
good. I certainly hand it to the Cali
fornians; they are full of ginger
("pep" you call it), and they will
prove very hard to stop. But Stanford
has not yet given of her best. Those
two New Zealand games 011 the turf
field were not strenuous football in
the same sense that strenuous play
was necessary at Berkeley. There
was an exceedingly goodfellowship
feeling in both games, and the Stan
ford men I am certain were not right
out. I feel and I know that tomorrow
the play of the Cardinal team will be
a revelation.
On the Berkeley campus there is
a feeling of supreme confidence that
amounts almost to conceit. I think
they are relying entirely on the form
shown in their games against the New
Zealanders, and they firmly believe
they have a cinch. I just as firmly
believe that tomorrow they will have
to go for their lives.
The teams have now been picked and
I was surprised to see the compara
tively small difference in the weights.
In fact the Stanford men have the ad
vantage with the exception of about
three pounds in the scrum. This mar
gin will not make the big difference
that has been claimed for it. For
merly I was under the impression
that the California advantage in
scrumming weight was much greater,
but now it seems to be practically a
case of level terms. California has
two men in King and McKim who are
great forwards, but outside these two
their vanguard possesses no player
who is endowed with special qualities.
Stanford will play different football
against California from what she did
against New Zealand. The difference
will not lie in the character of the
play or in the sportsmanship, every
body knows that, win or lose, that
part of it will always stand high, but
in the earnestness and vim that the
Cardinals will put into their work.
I am looking for the Stanford scrum
to hold the Blue and Gold in the Dig
Game.
lu Danny Carroll Stanford possesses
a great asset, and there is au able
second string in Charlie Austin. Cali
fornia has Sterling Peart, a fine, care
ful and safe player, but Danny is bet
ter than the Berkeley skipper, and
Austin is as good. I saw the Cardi
nals work out last night, and 1 was
impressed with the accuracy of the
backfleld. Of course there was no
opposition, but their handling was
perfect and their style of backing up
if carried out in the game as it was
last night, will prove a tremendous
factor in deciding the issue. The
Stanford three quarters line is a
strong one, and they should be given
all the chances possible. In my opin
ion the best three quarters at Cali
fornia are Hayes and Sharp. Both of
these boys possess that quality of dash
that should be the first attribute of a
successful wing, but neither of them
are in the team and Sharp is not even
?, substitute.
I understand that there is consider
able discussion on the campus over
the halfback position going to Erb in
preference to Tilton. I like Tilton.
and I like Erb, and I think that either
would have done well. The position
goes to Erb, and it can be considered
in safe keeping.
The general opinion is in favor of
California, and while most of the New
Zealanders are inclined to think so
too, they say that it will be too close
to bet on. One of the best judges in
the New Zealand team has taken Stan
ford at even chances and he has re
fused to call it off.
The Stanford men have the right
spirit, the spirit that wins matches,
and it can be confidently stated that
tomorrow they will go out like lions,
fight like lions, strongly and honora
bly, and will return with honors thick
upon them.

It is an even break. On the displays
given against the All Blacks Califor
nia would appear to be stronger for
ward, but in the first spell of that sec
ond game against the New Zealanders
tlie California team got away with a
lot of play that killed the All Blacks'
game and made their own work look
good, and this is not the sort of foot
ball that referee Billy hill will stand
tor tomorrow. Make your minds easy
on that point. Billy Hill is the best
mail for the job that you could have
got; he knows the game from A to Z,
and he will promptly call anything
that tends towards a repetition of
that second All Black game against
California.
1 am quite convinced that the Stan
ford team will show something to
morrow that will surprise a good
many people. I have seen Sehaeffer's
men fully extended, and they were
good. I certainly hand it to the Cali
fornians; they are full of ginger
("pep" you call it), and they will
prove very hard to stop. But Stanford
has not yet given of her best. Those
two New Zealand games 011 the turf
field were not strenuous football in
the same sense that strenuous play
was necessary at Berkeley. There
was an exceedingly goodfellowship
feeling in both games, and the Stan
ford men I am certain were not right
out. I feel and I know that tomorrow
the play of the Cardinal team will be
a revelation.
On the Berkeley campus there is
a feeling of supreme confidence that
amounts almost to conceit. I think
they are relying entirely on the form
shown in their games against the New
Zealanders, and they firmly believe
they have a cinch. I just as firmly
believe that tomorrow they will have
to go for their lives.
The teams have now been picked and
I was surprised to see the compara
tively small difference in the weights.
In fact the Stanford men have the ad
vantage with the exception of about
three pounds in the scrum. This mar
gin will not make the big difference
that has been claimed for it. For
merly I was under the impression
that the California advantage in
scrumming weight was much greater,
but now it seems to be practically a
case of level terms. California has
two men in King and McKim who are
great forwards, but outside these two
their vanguard possesses no player
who is endowed with special qualities.
Stanford will play different football
against California from what she did
against New Zealand. The difference
will not lie in the character of the
play or in the sportsmanship, every
body knows that, win or lose, that
part of it will always stand high, but
in the earnestness and vim that the
Cardinals will put into their work.
I am looking for the Stanford scrum
to hold the Blue and Gold in the Dig
Game.
lu Danny Carroll Stanford possesses
a great asset, and there is au able
second string in Charlie Austin. Cali
fornia has Sterling Peart, a fine, care
ful and safe player, but Danny is bet
ter than the Berkeley skipper, and
Austin is as good. I saw the Cardi
nals work out last night, and 1 was
impressed with the accuracy of the
backfleld. Of course there was no
opposition, but their handling was
perfect and their style of backing up
if carried out in the game as it was
last night, will prove a tremendous
factor in deciding the issue. The
Stanford three quarters line is a
strong one, and they should be given
all the chances possible. In my opin
ion the best three quarters at Cali
fornia are Hayes and Sharp. Both of
these boys possess that quality of dash
that should be the first attribute of a
successful wing, but neither of them
are in the team and Sharp is not even
?, substitute.
I understand that there is consider
able discussion on the campus over
the halfback position going to Erb in
preference to Tilton. I like Tilton.
and I like Erb, and I think that either
would have done well. The position
goes to Erb, and it can be considered
in safe keeping.
The general opinion is in favor of
California, and while most of the New
Zealanders are inclined to think so
too, they say that it will be too close
to bet on. One of the best judges in
the New Zealand team has taken Stan
ford at even chances and he has re
fused to call it off.
The Stanford men have the right
spirit, the spirit that wins matches,
and it can be confidently stated that
tomorrow they will go out like lions,
fight like lions, strongly and honora
bly, and will return with honors thick
upon them.
