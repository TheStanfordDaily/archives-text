# 22,000 WILL WITNESS BIG GAME TOMORROW.
## For First Time No Tickets For Bleachers Have Been Put on General Sale. 
### 
Twenty-two thousand persons will
be 011 hand to witness the twenty-third
Intercollegiate football game between
Stanford and California when Billy
Hill blows the whistle for the contest
to start at 2:30 tomorrow. Never
before in the history of the sport has
the Stanford Graduate Manager made
plans to be host to so many followers
of the game.
Every seat in the bleachers has been
sold to the students, alumni and fac
ulty of the two universities and for
the first time no big game tickets
have been placed on general sale. More
alumni than ever before have reserved
seats. They will return to their
alma mater from far and near to wit
ness the greatest athletic event of the
year.
Graduate Manager Wilcox of Stan
ford lias disposed of 7,500 tickets,
while Graduate Manager Donald of
California has handled 9,500 bleacher
paste boards. The seating capacity
of the bleachers has been materially
increased this year with the addition
of two new sections in the end, adding
about 1,000 more seats to the capacity
of the stands.
Tomorrow morning standing room
tickets will be placed on sale, prob
ably at the football field, selling for
11.50 apiece. These will admit to
standing room at the south end of the
turf field. It is expected that this
portion which has been reserved for
standing room will be taxed to its
capacity. Four thousand persons will
probably be accommodated to see the
game from this section of the field.
