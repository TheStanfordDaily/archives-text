# Even Weight and Skill Promise Hard Struggle

### 
A year ago the Stanford rooters
came closer to that coveted honor of
serpentining on the field of battle
than had been allowed a wearer of
the red since the davs of Captain
Crawford and the '08 Varsity. But
a field knee-deep in mud did not seem
to offer the best of opportunities for
a serpentine and the rooters were dis
couraged, or it might have been that
the rival fifteens were most evenly
matched.
Tomorrow the two universities of
the state again send their football rep
resentatives against each other, and
before the biggest crowd that ever
assembled at Stanford, on a turf that
could hardly be improved the rivals
will try conclusions. Incidentally the
result will probably shatter the "dope"
of the experts to naught.
In the long history of intercolle
giate football matches the Cardinal
has been returned victorious ten times,
the Blue and Gold seven times. Each
university has entered three victories
011 the right side of the ledger since
the introduction of the English game,
and in each case the victories have
been in series. Last November the
Weather Man expressed his disap
proval of collegiate sport in very de

cided terms, and effectually prevented
either side from deriving much satis
faction in the work of its favorites.
Early in September Coach Brown
called the first practice for the var
sity squad. The first game, with the
Olympics, was something of a set
back to the college players, as the club
men captured the match, 5-3.
The varsity played well for the initial
game, however, and a week later took
a fast game from the Barbs with a
score of 8-3. The next opponents, the
U. of C. Club, gave them an exciting
tussle and the bleacherites thrilled
when they saw their team put up a
game that would have been a credit a
month later in the season.
The October games with the Olym
pics and the Barbs did not prove so
exciting and the month's record does
not do any great credit to the team.
Especially did their pace slacken in
the Olympic game after the New Zea
landers had staged their exhibitions
here. In criticising the season no espe
cial, attention is paid to the All Black
games, for the scoring by the South
Sea stars was merely incidental to
their remarkable display of rugby skill
and the varsity could not offer oppo-
sition worthy of the name.
The last appearance of the Olym
pics, however, brought joy to the
Stanford rooters, for their team aftei
being outplayed in the first half by a
fifteen that was undoubtedly the strong,
est combination ever brought down
by the club, came back with a rush
and turned defeat into victory by i
safe margin.
Just how much of a test these sea
son games may be is a matter of per
sonal opinion. In other columns a
number of outside players have ex
pressed their views of Stanford's
strength. As in many another year,
the experts unite in saying that the
varsities are very evenly matched,
with the luck of the day to be consid
ered as a great factor. A close score
is easy to prophesy, but there have
been strange reversals of form in past
years.
California enthusiasts, both laymen
and experts, do not hesitate to say
that this year's varsity is superior to
the fifteen that held Stanford to a
tie score in that November rain.
Coach Sclvaeffer has developed a com
bination that is undoubtedly a bard one
to solve, a number of star players are
included in the lineup and the team as
a whole is more experienced than the
Stanford fifteen.
