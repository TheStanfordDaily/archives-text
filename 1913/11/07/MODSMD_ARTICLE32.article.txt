# INTERCOLLEGIATE SOCCER IS FEATURE OF MORNING
## SIX VETERANS STRENGTHEN THE CARDINAL LINEUP. Williamson Trophy Goes To Winner of Series. Stanford Has Held Cup Two Years. 
### 
The Williamson Trophy will again
be contested for on the soccer field
when the Stanford and California elev
ens clash on Saturday morning.
At the founding of soccer on an In
tercollegiate minor sport basis three
years ago, a handsome cup was offered
by S. Y. Williamson of the Barbarian
club as an added incentive to the com
petition. The trophy is held from year
to year by the university winning two
out of three matches in the annual ser
ies. The letters L. S. J. U. have twice
been inscribed on the cup, Stanford
having held possession of the trophy
during the two years of its existence.
The third season of Intercollegiate
soccer with California will see a strong
Cardinal team in the field to retain
the honors for Stanford. Six veter
ans will appear in the lineup. The
forward line is especially strong with
Captain Higgins, ex-Captain Pellas,
and Pratt playing for their third year
in the Cardinal lineup. Clawson is a
new man at left inside. The remain
ing position in the forward line was
to be filled by Vail, a veteran of two
years. A sprained ankle necessitated
the substitution of Rest, who has
made a strong showing in the practice
games.
Butcher at goal has filled this post
of last defense in all Stanford soccer
contests, and much reliance is put in
his ability. Blodgett at left fullback
and Steinhart at center halfback have
won their circle "S" in former terms.
The remaining backs, Glass at full,
Dutton and Hughes in the halfback
line, are making their first appearance.
C. Y. Williamson, the donor of the
Intercollegiate cup and the interclass
soccer shield, will referee the match.
He is a player on the Barbarian team,
and a soccer expert whose decisions
should give satisfaction to both sides.
The game will be held on the soccer
field near the track at 10:30. This
will allow spectators convenient time
for lunch before the rugby contest in
tho afternoon.
