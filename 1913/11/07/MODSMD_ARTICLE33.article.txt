# BIG GAME PROGRAMS WILL HAVE ATTRACTIVE COVERS.
## Brief History and Data on Two Teams Gives Reliable Information. 
### 
Distinctive programs with attractive
covers and numerous cuts as features
will appear on Saturday morning con
taining all information about the Big
Game. The booklets are unique in
size, being of handy dimensions for
the pocket.
A Cardinal background with a white
"S" for the adherents to the Stanford
team and a blue background with a
gold "C" for followers of the Berkeley
fifteen are the only differences in the
5,000 programs which will be put on
sale at twenty-five cents apiece. 2500
of each color have been supplied.
A brief survey of the history of
football between the two universities
and data on the relative merits of the
two teams is recorded. More cuts than
usual appear in the 1913 program.
The only place where these may be
obtained is at the football field. Per
sons should beware of fake programs
which will probably be offered for
sale in Palo Alto and at the station
which will not contain the data and
information that will be found in the
real article.
