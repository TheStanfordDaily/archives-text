# STANFORD PROVES ITS SUPREMACY OVER CALIFORNIA IN ALL DEPARTMENTS OF GAME
## 
### 
Seventeen cardinal jerseyed play
ers made rugby history for Stanford
Saturday when they sent the Golden
Hear scurrying back to his lair,
smarting under a decisive defeat, 13
to S. The bear had come to Stanford
Field in the best of fighting trim for
the twenty-third annual tussle with
its rivals, but the odds were too great
and in two forty minute sessions on
the turf the Berkeley quadruped was
soundly trounced.
After an interval of five years Stan
ford has broken again into the win
ners' column in the football record,
and the present generation of Stan
ford men have learned the riotous joy
of the serpentine. In as fine an exhi
bition of rugby as the intercollegiate
contest has ever furnished, the Cardi
nal Varsity outplayed a strong fifteen
from the University of California,
scoring three tries to their opponents'
one.
It was a day of superlatives—the
players, the weather, the turfed
field, the vast throng of spectators, all
were at their best. The game was not
marred in any way, there was not a
suspicion of rough tactics, the play
was comparatively open, the referee's
decisions were not questioned, and
the victors clearly had the better of
the argument. November S, 1913, will
bo red-inked in the calendar of Stan
ford's history.
Thrill a Second.
The referee's whistle sounded the j
first signal at 2:38 p.m., and from I
that moment no loyal partisan of
either team was able to take a full
breath. Stanford won the toss for
kickoff, and Field Captain Darsie was
the first player to boot the pigskin.
Play did not get deeper than the Cali
fornia twenty-five yard line, and two
tree kicks awarded the Blue and Gold
took the smile from the faces of the
Cardinal rooters. And after that they
forgot to breathe.
These facts stand out in an outline
of the eighty minutes of play:
The first try was made for Stanford
after twenty minutes of hard fighting,
Lachmund taking a high spiral from
Austin and scooting through the Cali
lornia line. Austin's kick was wide

of the goal posts, and Stanford had
only a three point lead.
Carroll made the second try by
swerving and dodging for thirty-five
yards through his opponents, plant
ing the ball near the posts. Austin
converted.
Peart kicked a tielU goal shortly af
ter this, bootingf»-om the forty yard
line. Score, 8; California 3.
Urban started the play in the second
half that gave Stanford the third try.
He dodged along the side line from
the California 25 yard mark, and
then passed to Blase, who transferred
the ball to Austin. The first five dodg
ed through for a try, and converted it
himself.
Lockhart bucked across the Stan
ford line for California's try late in
the second half, and Peart converted.
That ended the scoring.
Stanford Hacks Star.
While the Cardinal scrum held the
opposing pack nearly every time the
forwards locked together, and out
hooked the Blue and Gold, the backs
were clearly superior to their oppon
ents, and were continually on the of
fense. It seemed the plan of the Cali
fornia men to bottle up the play in
the forward division, and this meant
that the backs remained on the de
fensive. On the few occasions that
the backfield attacked strongly they
made good gains and pressed the Car
dinal defense. The best passing rush
of the day is credited to the California
backs, who carried the ball from their
own 55 yard line to the Stanford 15
yard line, every man handling the pig
skin.
Peart played a wonderful game for
the Blue and Gold, bolstering up the
backs in every play and often making
great gains by booting to touch. Again
•and again the California Captain
would stop the Stanford advance by
scooping up the ball and kicking it out
of the dangerous territory. His play
ing compares with that of any man on
the field.
-McKim proved a dangerous for
ward, and was continually in the thick
of the play. Unassisted, he broke
through the Cardinal forwards several
times and dribbled the ball well down
the field. King succeeeded in smoth
er ng Stanford play a few times, but
was not here, there and everywhere,
as was McKim.
Carroll was in the best form that he
has ever shown on Stanford Field.
He was speedy enough to get awny
' rom the would-be tacklers, was accu
rate in looting, and was unerring in
scooping up the ball in defense and
sending it to the touchlines.
Charley Austin, at first five, proved I
equally indispensable to the team,
scoring one try, converting two, and
opening up holes in the California fle
fense again and again. He was ably
seconded by Otto Lachmund at second
five, who scored the first try of the
