# STANFORD PROVES ITS SUPREMACY OVER CALIFORNIA IN ALL DEPARTMENTS OF GAME
## 
### 
Seventeen cardinal jerseyed play
ers made rugby history for Stanford
Saturday when they sent the Golden
Hear scurrying back to his lair,
smarting under a decisive defeat, 13
to S. The bear had come to Stanford
Field in the best of fighting trim for
the twenty-third annual tussle with
its rivals, but the odds were too great
and in two forty minute sessions on
the turf the Berkeley quadruped was
soundly trounced.
After an interval of five years Stan
ford has broken again into the win
ners' column in the football record,
and the present generation of Stan
ford men have learned the riotous joy
of the serpentine. In as fine an exhi
bition of rugby as the intercollegiate
contest has ever furnished, the Cardi
nal Varsity outplayed a strong fifteen
from the University of California,
scoring three tries to their opponents'
one.
It was a day of superlatives—the
players, the weather, the turfed
field, the vast throng of spectators, all
were at their best. The game was not
marred in any way, there was not a
suspicion of rough tactics, the play
was comparatively open, the referee's
decisions were not questioned, and
the victors clearly had the better of
the argument. November S, 1913, will
bo red-inked in the calendar of Stan
ford's history.
Thrill a Second.
The referee's whistle sounded the j
first signal at 2:38 p.m., and from I
that moment no loyal partisan of
either team was able to take a full
breath. Stanford won the toss for
kickoff, and Field Captain Darsie was
the first player to boot the pigskin.
Play did not get deeper than the Cali
fornia twenty-five yard line, and two
tree kicks awarded the Blue and Gold
took the smile from the faces of the
Cardinal rooters. And after that they
forgot to breathe.
These facts stand out in an outline
of the eighty minutes of play:
The first try was made for Stanford
after twenty minutes of hard fighting,
Lachmund taking a high spiral from
Austin and scooting through the Cali
lornia line. Austin's kick was wide

of the goal posts, and Stanford had
only a three point lead.
Carroll made the second try by
swerving and dodging for thirty-five
yards through his opponents, plant
ing the ball near the posts. Austin
converted.
Peart kicked a tielU goal shortly af
ter this, bootingf»-om the forty yard
line. Score, 8; California 3.
Urban started the play in the second
half that gave Stanford the third try.
He dodged along the side line from
the California 25 yard mark, and
then passed to Blase, who transferred
the ball to Austin. The first five dodg
ed through for a try, and converted it
himself.
Lockhart bucked across the Stan
ford line for California's try late in
the second half, and Peart converted.
That ended the scoring.
Stanford Hacks Star.
While the Cardinal scrum held the
opposing pack nearly every time the
forwards locked together, and out
hooked the Blue and Gold, the backs
were clearly superior to their oppon
ents, and were continually on the of
fense. It seemed the plan of the Cali
fornia men to bottle up the play in
the forward division, and this meant
that the backs remained on the de
fensive. On the few occasions that
the backfield attacked strongly they
made good gains and pressed the Car
dinal defense. The best passing rush
of the day is credited to the California
backs, who carried the ball from their
own 55 yard line to the Stanford 15
yard line, every man handling the pig
skin.
Peart played a wonderful game for
the Blue and Gold, bolstering up the
backs in every play and often making
great gains by booting to touch. Again
•and again the California Captain
would stop the Stanford advance by
scooping up the ball and kicking it out
of the dangerous territory. His play
ing compares with that of any man on
the field.
-McKim proved a dangerous for
ward, and was continually in the thick
of the play. Unassisted, he broke
through the Cardinal forwards several
times and dribbled the ball well down
the field. King succeeeded in smoth
er ng Stanford play a few times, but
was not here, there and everywhere,
as was McKim.
Carroll was in the best form that he
has ever shown on Stanford Field.
He was speedy enough to get awny
' rom the would-be tacklers, was accu
rate in looting, and was unerring in
scooping up the ball in defense and
sending it to the touchlines.
Charley Austin, at first five, proved I
equally indispensable to the team,
scoring one try, converting two, and
opening up holes in the California fle
fense again and again. He was ably
seconded by Otto Lachmund at second
five, who scored the first try of the
day. Laclimund was pitted against
Sterling Peart, but did not find the
Blue and Gold captain at all invincible
and was always in the game.
Stanford's confidence in the two
wings, Urban and Reeves, was more
than justified, for the two players
were bulwarks for the Cardinal along
the sidelines, Reeves' opponent, Hunt,
was one of the California stars, but
he was effectually prevented from do
ing any damage. Helmus Andrews
was as good as a stone wall when the
opposing forwards broke through and
rushed the hall down the field, and it
was his cool headedness and hard
tackling that prevented McKim or one
of his scrum-mates from scoring on
several occasions. Andrews was not
given a great many opportunities to
boot the ball, but when the chance did
come he made good.
Art Erb's defensive work was a feat
ure of the game in the first half, and
he continually showed his fitness for
the half back position. When injured
in the second half, Tilton was sent into
the game and proved as strong a play
er as had bis predecessor. His pass
ing was clean and his short boots to
touch were good.
"Jumbo" Blase was as conspicuous
in the lineouts as was the giant lock,
King, and got the ball to his ball" more
often than did the California player.
Blase was the starting point of most
of the Stanford plays from the lineout.

Gard and Darsie will be entered in
the pages of Cardinal rugby history
a.s a premier pair of breakaways,
'I hey had two men of the first rank
opposing them, but were conspicuous
in the play at every stage of the game.
Watkins and Clover were equal to
the task assigned them in middle rank,
and were instrumental in upsetting
the carefully worked out "dope" of the
experts that California would outplay 1
us in the forward position.
Hall, Wines and Peck in the front
rank are given credit for outplaying
the three California forwards, in hook
ing the ball as it was shot into the
pack. They were a hard fighting,
cool-headed trio, and proved a great
factor in determining the final re
sult.
First Half.
Darsie kicked off to California, but
the play was quickly smothered. Cal
ifornia was given a free kick on her
own 25 yard line, Peart finding touch
at center. After a second free kick
given California from the 10 yard line,
the ball was carried to a scrum at
Stanford's 25. The Cardinal pack
fought back to center, and a free kick
taken there resulted in a tussle that
snapped the ball out at center result
ing in a lineout. Securing from a
scrum on the Stanford 10 yard line,
Hazeltine dropped the ball, allowing
the play to be broken up -when An
drews got touch at Stanford's 25 yard
line. The throwins were quick in
each instance, and the scrums did not
pack well.
Blase gained twenty yards by a kick
to touch at center after receiving the
ball on the Stanford 25 yard line.
Scrum at center followed. Andrews
next failed to find touch on a long
kick, and Skinner returned, finding
the sidelines on Stanford's fifty. A
dribbling rush that threatened Cali
fornia's goal was checked by Captain
Peart, who scooped and found touch
at the Stanford 50 yard line.
Starting from the Stanford fifty, a
dribbling rush carried the ball to Cal
ifornia's 25 yard line, but from a line
out the play was carried to Stanford's
twenty-five. After Austin's kick to
touch at the California 50 yard line,
Captain Peart again saved his goal by
a pretty boot out at center. Austin's
next long kick gained forty yards, go
ing out on the twenty yard line. A
free kick allowed Austin to send the
ball to California's backs on their ten
yard line, where they were forced out.
A moment later Austin failed to place
a kick for goal from the 25 yard line.
Erb marked a free kick made by
Captain Peart, Urban took the second
return from California and made a
short run, but slipped on the grass,
giving Erb a chance to kick out of
danger. Darsie, Austin, and Lach
mund figured in a short passing run
which was blocked when Captain
Peart found center touch, standing
nut as star of the match thus far. Erb
stopped ii]) a passing run of the Cali
fornia backs by a kick to the enemies'
territory from Stanford's forty. Danny
Carroll and Frank Reeves broke away
for a neat passing run, Carroll cross
kicked, and the ball went into the
ruck. Andrews returned the ball to
California's fifteen by a beautiful kick
from center. Given a free kick, Aus
tin sent a high spiral, which Lacli
mund caught on the bounce and car

vied over for the first score. Austin
failed to convert. Score, Stanford 3,
Caifornia 0.
After the dropout and a scrum at
center, rapid fire play kept the ball in
California territory. Carroll executed
a wonderful left-looted kick after re
ceiving from the ten yard scrum. Cal
ifornia saved, and Peart dropped out,
Carroll burst through from a center
lineout, intercepted a rolling pass
from Hazeltine to Peart, cut through
the line, and scored directly under the
goal posts. Austin converted. Score,
Stanford 8, California 0.
Peait kicked off after the second
try, finding touch at Stanford's twen
ty-live. While Peart, was attempting
a kick for goal from Stanford's thirty
live Blase booted the ball downfield
before the kick was made. Andrews
took the return of Urban's spiral from
center, finding touch on the Califor
nia 40 yard line.
California hammered into Stanford
territory when Peart's dropout was
followed by a kicking run that sent
the ball over Andrews' head. Peart's
next attempt to kick the goal succeed
ed. Score, Stanford 8, California 3.
Darsie kicked off for Stanford, the
ball finding touch on California's thir
ty. A bomb, shot at that time stopped
play for a few minutes, being mistaken
for the pistol. When play was resum
ed, Austin returned a free kick to
Skinner , who found touch at center.
Half time ended with Hazeltine finding
touch on the Stanford 25 yard line.
Sceoml Hnlf.
Peart kicked off for California, but
Stanford dribbled the ball down the
field and reached touch at California's
30 yard line. Tilton replaced Erb, who
was taken out with ah injured kne \
and Crane replaced Fenstermacher.
California was awarded a free kick on
the yard line. Tilton short kicked
from a 40 yard scrum and Skinner
marked the ball on California's 2. r >
yard line. Urban received the luck,
made a short high kick, scooted along
the side line, but was downed on Cal
ifornia's 5 yard line. In the lineout,
Blase took the ball, passed to Urban,
who crossed the field and passed to
Austin. The Stanford five-eighths
dodged through the California line for
a score. Austin converted. Score,
13 to 3.
Peart kicked off and touch was found
on Stanford's 35 yard line. On a free
place kick Peart failed from the 40
yard line. Stanford was awarded a
freo kick from her own 5 yard line
and Austin found touch on Stanford's
i0 yard line. Stanford more than held
her own in a zigzag dribbling play in
center field. Carroll broke away from
the pack for a long run almost the
length of the field and passed to Card,
who was smeared on California's 5
yard line. Play was carried back to
touch at center field, where Austin
sot away on a short run. Gianelli ran
to Stanford's 30 yard line, where he
was tackled by Urban. Fish replaced
Fleming. Russell replaced Abrams,
and Lockhprt went in for Saunders.

Card dribbled across the center field
line.
McKim blocked Tilton's kick over
scrum at California's 10. A passing
rush took the ball to Stanford's 15.

ball fifteen yards. A backfield rush in
which all the Blue and Gold backs took
part, carried the ball to Stanford's 10
yard line, where a scrum resulted.
Peart failed to drop the ball between
the goal posts from the 35 yard line.
From a scrum on the Stanford one
yard line Lockhart made an old game
line buck and went over the line for
California's only try. Peart converted.
