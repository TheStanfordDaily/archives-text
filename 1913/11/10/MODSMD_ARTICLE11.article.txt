# Victory

### 
On the honor roll in Cardinal letters
the names of the men who fought and
won for Stanford Saturday will go
clown deeply embossed on the pages
of college athletic history. The game

must be recorded as one of
the hardest played and most
stubbornly contested battles

ever waged by the intercollegiate riv
als. Stanford's ruggers won on their
merits.
To Field Coach Floyd Brown, Ad
visory Coach George Presley, Trainer
Harry Maloney, and the men who aid
ed in moulding the raw possibilities
into a winning fifteen, must go a large
share of the praise and credit occas
ioned by the result of the game. Ev
ery man on the team was a hero, and
no team wes ever more clearly entit
led to win. 'Twas a glorious victory!
