# BLEACHERS ARE BANKS OF RIOTOUS COLOR ON PERFECT AUTUMN DAY
## 
### 
At noontime Saturday the smooth
grass carpet of the football field was
busy absorbing the welcome sun's
rays that struck down from the rain
proof canopy of a blue sky. Just a
trace of white cloud basked comforta
bly here and there as a truce between
the storm god and the rugby enthusi
asts of the state.
When the cumbined Stanford-Cali
fornia military bands appeared in their
bright colored uniforms at two o'cloclt
some fifteen thousand places were fill
ed by partisan spectators, who were
on hand early to champion the cause
of their ruggers. There was a har
monious jumble of gay colored dresses,
pennants and parasols. Cardinal hued
carnations and roses, great yellow
chrysanthemums, and clusters of vio
lets betokened the patriotism of their
wearers. The tiers of seats were bank
ed into riotous terraces of color and
perfume that sloped down to the lawn
field 011 three sides, completing the
prettiest picture that has been seen
at Stanford for many a day.
No more fitting prelude to the exhi
bition of good sportsmanship seen Sat
urday could have been offered than the
concert given by the mingled bands
men of California and Stanford. Their
criss-cross marching was a joy to be
hold, and the music, coming from the
center of the field was appreciated on
all sides.
The new arrangement of
the Stanford "S" formed as part of a
pennant by red and white stoles of
bunting worn by the men was effective.
Cheering from both sides was vig
orous and interesting. A very useful
comic interlude for the two nerve try
ing chapters of the main event was
provided by the burlesque rugby con
test between curiously attired players
of the "Amazons" and "Guerrillas."
This new feature on the Big Game pro
gram served a real purpose.
