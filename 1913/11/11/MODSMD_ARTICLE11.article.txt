By a plain and concise statement m
the rugby agreement between Stan
ford and California it is agreed that
"neither team shall in any game play
more than eighteen men —that is each

team shall be allowed three
substitutes, and no more.
All substitutes must lire-

sent themselves to the Referee before
taking their place." Through substi
tution of fresh players this pact was
broken on Saturday. The violation
was flagrant. Our intercollegiate riv
als numbered nineteen. This is one
in excess of the number allowed.
Long and tiresome sessions of the rep
resentatives of the two universities
who compose the rules committee
have been necessary to work out the
regulations which shall govern the
big ga,>. Openly these rules have
been transgressed.
rnoflicially it, has been explained
that the extra substitute was injected
into the game because of a misunder
standing between the California
coaches. This is inexcusable. It
does not. sound plausable. If it was
intentionally ilone it was an unsports
manlike action savoring of the un
scrupulous. This should not be coun
tenanced by either university. An ade
quate explanation is due from the
proper athletic authorities at Cali
fornia.
