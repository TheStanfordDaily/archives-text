Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Sir —One of the most remarkable
features of Saturday's spectacular
contest was the apparent weakening
of the Stanford forwards in the last
fifteen minutes of play and the in
creased aggressiveness of the Califor
nia pack. This was undoubtedly at
tributed by most of the spectators to
a difference in condition, in stamina,
and in lighting spirit in the two teams.
It seems to me that in justice to the
Stanford fifteen and to the coaches
and trainer the fact should be pub
lished that the improved showing of
California was due to the judicious
injection of four fresh men into the
Mine and Gold scrum after the middle
of the second half. This was in di
rect defiance and violation of the rules
adopted by the Football Rules Com
mittee of the two universities, which
permits the use of but three substi
tutes in the intercollegiate match, and
forced the eight Stanford forwards to
play twelve men during the game.
Furthermore, at one period in the sec
ond half, sixteen men were on the
field playing for California. To all
fair minded people this desperate at
tempt to turn the tide of battle
against a better team must appear a
marring feature of this year's game.
For tho benefit of future teams is it
not proper that an inquiry should be
directed to the executive committee of
the Associated Students of the Uni
versity of California to determine
what action California intends to take
in the future in regard to this and
other articles in the agreement be
tween the universities to which both
executive committees have subscribed
their official approval?
