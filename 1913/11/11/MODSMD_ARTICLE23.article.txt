# CALIFORNIA HOLDS CONSOLATION RALLY.
## 
### 
For the first time in four years, the
students of the University of California
held a consolation rally this morning,
when the coaches, trainers, and mem
bers of the team addressed a gathering
of students on the football bleachers.
All classes were let out between the
hours of 11:00 and 12:00 o'clock for
the purpose of allowing the students
to hear the explanations offered.
