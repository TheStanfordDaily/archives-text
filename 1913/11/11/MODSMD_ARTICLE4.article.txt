# SEVEN STANFORD VARSITY MEN WILL WEAR THE SHIELD OF THE ALL-STARS
## 
### 
Seven Stanford rugby players from
the Varsity that defeated Cal'fornia
on Saturday have been named by the
selection committee of the California

Rugby Union to
wear the American
shield in the game
with the All Blacks
Two other posi
tions on the team
are filled by Stan
ford graduates and
lor m e r Varsity
players, while four
of the substitutes

are Cardinal veteran.s
The fifteen named by the committee
to play on California Field next Sat
urday includes seven men from the
Stanford Varsity, three players from
tiie lUne and Gold fifteen, two from
Santa Clara, and one from each of
the three rugby playing clubs, the
Olympics, the Harbs, and the Los An
geles Athletic club. The committee
that is responsible for the selection
is composed of W. P. Fuller, .loe Hick
ey, and Ralph Merritt.
\V. \V. Hill has been asked by the
Union to act as referee, and has ac
cepted the invitation to take charge
of the game.
George Presley will be official coach
of the All Star fifteen, and will put
the players through a light workout

the end of the
week as well as
direct their play
on Saturday.
Ft seems likely
that continued wet
weather will mean
the transfer of the
game to Stanford,
the condition of
California Field

after a rain would preclude any pos
sibility of good rugby.
The proportion of Stanford players
on the All American team is exactly
the same as in the 1912 game with the
Australian Waratahs. Stanford's dele-

gation numbered seven last year, while

five men were
Blue and Gold
veterans.

the Bar b aria r

club. Hall is a two year veteran o
the Cardinal Varsity.

sie, a pair of forwards that have beet
a mainstay in the Stanford Varsitj
for two years. Gard was named or
the All Star team in 1912 and ai
breakaway played the game of his
career. His teammate this year is
Hill Darsie.
Louis Cass, '13, captain of the 191:
Varsity, is to be the halfback, am
