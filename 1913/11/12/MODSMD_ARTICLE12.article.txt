# The 						Great Illusion
## 
### 
As a representative of the Garton
Foundation for the study of interna
tional problems Mr. Langdon-Davies,
a brilliant Oxford scholar and econo-

mist, is to discuss the doc
trine of international concil
iation in a University As
sembly tomorrow morning.
The distinguished peace ad-

vocate has chosen as a topic "The
Great Illusion"â€”the misbelief that
war can be made to pay a profit to the
victor. This theory is based upon a
pure optical deception. As a student
of economics and world problems the
speaker comes well qualified to dis
approve the mistaken ideas of the mil
itarists and show the futility of the
"armed peace." The 10:15 period to
morrow will be devoted to the Assem
bly with all university work suspend
ed for that hour.
