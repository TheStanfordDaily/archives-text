Lists of football players who are
eligible to represent Northern Cali
fornia in the rugby match for the
American Interscholastic champion
ship next Thanksgiving Day will be
submitted to Skull and Snakes Mon
day. The committees of judges were
appointed by the society late last
month to prepare lists of the high

I school ruggers who have made the
I ljost showing in both sections of the
! state. The judges have accomplished
: their work by personal attendance ai
| preparatory school matches, and by
! careful study of news reports and
| other statistics. From the lists of
! eligibles submitted, a special Skull
| and Snakes committee will choose two
j teams, with four substitutes and a
manager for each, to meet on Stanford
Field in the first contest of the kind
that has ever been staged in America.
The announcement of the teams and
substitutes will not be made for sev
eral days after the judges send in
their lists.
M. M. Mitchell, '10, of Los Angeles,
former Varsity captain, who witness
ed the intercollegiate game last Sat
urday stated that all the preparatory
schools in the Southern province of
California are showing active interest
in the interscholastic match. Both
Mitchell and Thomas Sanborn, '12, of
Redlands, who compose the Southern
committee, have made a number ot'
trips to the Southern schools, and
have been able to base their judgment
on first-hand knowledge of the teams
and players. Mitchell promises that
the All Southern aggregation will
turn loose a lot of speed and skill
against their Northern rivals.
Those on the Northern California
committee are: G. A. Ditz, '11, Stock
ton; CT. Presley, '07, San Francisco;
Douglas Erskine, San Francisco; K.
L. Schaupp, '12, Stanford, and W. E.
Sprott, Porterville.
The line of demarcation set between
the Northern and Southern parts of
California is a parallel through the
Tehachapi mountains.
One value that the interscholastic
match will have as an annual institu
tion will be to turn the schools of Cal
ifornia from the old game of football
to rugby.
