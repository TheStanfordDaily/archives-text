Twenty-three members of the Stan
ford Glee club will travel through the
Northwest during the Christmas vaca
tion on an extended concert tour.
Manager S. V. Claggett, '14, has se
cured contracts with fourteen theater
j proprietors in various cities cn route,
| and well prepared programs depicting
Stanford life will be staged every ev
ening at some point on the trip.
The first concert will take place in
San Jose on December 20, just after
final examinations are over on the
campus. Christmas eve will find the
club in Portland, Oregon; Vancouver,
British Columbia, will be reached on
December 30. The return trip will be
made by January C, in time for the
opening of the spring semester. The
finest theaters available have been
secured for these performances, nota
bly the Cort, in Seattle, the Heilig, in
Portland, and the Opera House, in
Vancouver. Stanford Alumni Associ
ations are promising hearty coopera
tion in several towns along the way,
and their support alone should insure
the success of the enterprise. The
Alumni Associations of Portland and
Aberdeen, Washington, are planning
to entertain the Stanford men royally
when they reach those cities, and
other attractions are being offered

throughout the trip, which will cover
approximately over 3000 miles.
Tho programs themselves are novel
in character. The first part partakes
of a formal nature. The performers
will appear in dress suits and give
select classical numbers, as well as
several solos and instrumental pieces.
The second division of the program
consists of a skit, with its setting in
v. Stanford fraternity house. The four
classes in characteristic dVess appear
seated about a table, and during the
course of the meal exchange jokes
and Stanford songs. A choice male
quartet will come in for a round of
applause by singing popular college
airs. After this scene is over, lights
will be extinguished and slides of the
university and its customs will be
thrown upon a screen, while the com
pany sings "Hail, Stanford, Hail."
