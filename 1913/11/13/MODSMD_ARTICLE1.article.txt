# GEORGE HAMLIN FITCH WILL SPEAK TOMORROW
## LECTURE IS CHANGED FROM 4:30 TO 1:30 O'CLOCK Editorial Duties of San Francisco journalist Necessitate His Leaving Campus Early. 
### 
Because of editorial duties which
require his attention in the latter part
of the afternoon, George Hamlin Fitch
will speak in the Chapel tomorrow af
ternoon at 1:30, instead of 4:30, as
was previously announced. The San
Francisco editor will talk to the stu
dents on the general subject of good
books and the duty of students to take
an interest in the best literature, art
and drama.
Mr. Fitch is well known to many
Stanford people, either personally or
through his book "Comfort Found in
Good Old Books," the writing of which
was the direct outcome of the sudden
death of his son, Harold Fitch, '09.
While Harold Fitch and his sister,
Mary, were at Stanford, Mr. Fitch
made a wide circle of friends on the
Campus. In the first chapter of this
book Mr. Fitch sets forth his ideas of
the value of the habit of reading good
books as a resource in meeting the
problems of real life, and his talk
next Friday will be along these lines.
Although Mr. Fitch is known chiefly
to the public as a literary critic, he
preaches the doctrine that there is
today too much criticism about books
and writers rather than first hand
reading of the books themselves. Mr.
Fitch has not only been the literary
editor of the "Chronicle" for more
than thirty years, but he is also night
editor of the paper, the man on whom
the whole brunt of the work of getting
out the paper falls during the strenu
ous iinal hours before the paper goes
to press. Me is also San Francisco
correspondent for many of the chief
newspapers oi the East, including the
New York "Sun," Chicago "Tribune,
and St. Louis "Post-Dispatch,"' and is
a contributor to many magazines. He
is probably the most experienced and
versatile journalist un the Pacific
Coast, and his daily contact with life
through his duties us an active news
paper man gives added value to his
views as a scholar.
Mr. Fitch was a student at Cornell
with Chancellor Jordan, President
Bianner, Professor C. D. Marx, and
the late Professor Dudley, and it was
at the suggestion of President Bran
uer that the English department in
vited him to speak at Stanford. At
Cornell Fitch was greatly influenced
by Hiram Corsan, and was one of a
group of students who used to meet
with him to discuss books and writers.
After leaving college Mr. Fitch imme
diately joined the staff of the New
York "Tribune" and rose rapidly to
become assistant night editor. One
of the interesting incidents of his
time on the "Tribune" was his recog
nition of the ability of Jacob Riis, who
wanted to become a reporter on the
"Tribune," but would probably have
failed except for Mr. Fitch's assist
ance. Later on Riis went to the "Sun"
where as a reporter he laid the foun
dation for his later success as an
author and reformer.
In 1879 Mr. Fitch took a vacation
from the "Tribune," for the purpose
of seeing a little of the West. 11l
San Francisco one evening he dropped
casually into the "Chronicle" office,
and finding there a pressure of work,
lent them a hand to get through the
evening. He has never left the
"Chronicle" since that time.
Following the publication of his
first book, in 1911, he has issued sev
eral others on literature and travel,
all of them collections of his contri
butions to the "Chronicle."

made a wide circle of friends on the
Campus. In the first chapter of this
book Mr. Fitch sets forth his ideas of
the value of the habit of reading good
books as a resource in meeting the
problems of real life, and his talk
next Friday will be along these lines.
Although Mr. Fitch is known chiefly
to the public as a literary critic, he
preaches the doctrine that there is
today too much criticism about books
and writers rather than first hand
reading of the books themselves. Mr.
Fitch has not only been the literary
editor of the "Chronicle" for more
than thirty years, but he is also night
editor of the paper, the man on whom
the whole brunt of the work of getting
out the paper falls during the strenu
ous iinal hours before the paper goes
to press. Me is also San Francisco
correspondent for many of the chief
newspapers oi the East, including the
New York "Sun," Chicago "Tribune,
and St. Louis "Post-Dispatch,"' and is
a contributor to many magazines. He
is probably the most experienced and
versatile journalist un the Pacific
Coast, and his daily contact with life
through his duties us an active news
paper man gives added value to his
views as a scholar.
Mr. Fitch was a student at Cornell
with Chancellor Jordan, President
Bianner, Professor C. D. Marx, and
the late Professor Dudley, and it was
at the suggestion of President Bran
uer that the English department in
vited him to speak at Stanford. At
Cornell Fitch was greatly influenced
by Hiram Corsan, and was one of a
group of students who used to meet
with him to discuss books and writers.
After leaving college Mr. Fitch imme
diately joined the staff of the New
York "Tribune" and rose rapidly to
become assistant night editor. One
of the interesting incidents of his
time on the "Tribune" was his recog
nition of the ability of Jacob Riis, who
wanted to become a reporter on the
"Tribune," but would probably have
failed except for Mr. Fitch's assist
ance. Later on Riis went to the "Sun"
where as a reporter he laid the foun
dation for his later success as an
author and reformer.
In 1879 Mr. Fitch took a vacation
from the "Tribune," for the purpose
of seeing a little of the West. 11l
San Francisco one evening he dropped
casually into the "Chronicle" office,
and finding there a pressure of work,
lent them a hand to get through the
evening. He has never left the
"Chronicle" since that time.
Following the publication of his
first book, in 1911, he has issued sev
eral others on literature and travel,
all of them collections of his contri
butions to the "Chronicle."
Because of editorial duties which
require his attention in the latter part
of the afternoon, George Hamlin Fitch
will speak in the Chapel tomorrow af
ternoon at 1:30, instead of 4:30, as
was previously announced. The San
Francisco editor will talk to the stu
dents on the general subject of good
books and the duty of students to take
an interest in the best literature, art
and drama.
Mr. Fitch is well known to many
Stanford people, either personally or
through his book "Comfort Found in
Good Old Books," the writing of which
was the direct outcome of the sudden
death of his son, Harold Fitch, '09.
While Harold Fitch and his sister,
Mary, were at Stanford, Mr. Fitch
made a wide circle of friends on the
Campus. In the first chapter of this
book Mr. Fitch sets forth his ideas of
the value of the habit of reading good
books as a resource in meeting the
