# War and Waste
## 
### 
Indicating the futility of war and
condemning the needless expenditure
for armies and navies in the armament
struggle of the nations, a plea was

made this morning in a Uni
versity Assembly for the crea
tion of a public sentiment
against the continuance of
war and waste. As it was

pointed out, public opinion ultimately
controls whatever form of government
there is. The college community is
naturallv looked to to furnish the lead
ers in progressive ideas, and for the
things which are highest and best in
government. Stanford has the distinc
tion of being the first American uni
versity to conduct an investigation in
the classroom of the case for and
against war. Her own Chancellor has
become one of the world's leaders in
the cause of international conciliation.
From the college men must come the
impetus which will touch the men now
in control of our international affairs.
The university can do the most toward
creating tne opposition which will
sweep aside the objections or the mili
tarists.
