the Chemistry building last evening
on the subject of Liquid Air.
"Water at zero degree and below
forms a solid," said Professor Frank

it is supplied with heat, it rises to a
temperature of 100 degrees and begins
to boil. Liquid air is simply the air
ive breathe cooled to .so low a tempera
ture that it takes on liquid form."

ments to show the effect of a quantity
