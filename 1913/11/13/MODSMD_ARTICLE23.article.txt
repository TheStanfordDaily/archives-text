# Team 3 Wins By Default.
## 
### 
Members of Acacia, Cardinal Club,
and Tbe Lodge, scheduled in the post
season rugby series as Team 9, failed
to collect fifteen men for their side
yesterday afternoon, and consequently
forfeited the game to Team 3 of the
league, consisting of players from
Sigma Alpha Epsilon and Sigma Chi.
