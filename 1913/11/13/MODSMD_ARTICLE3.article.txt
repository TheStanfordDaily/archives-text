# WARFARE AND ARMED PEACE DECLARED ECONOMIC DRAINS
## Langdon-Davies, British Economist, Looks to the American Nation For a Solution of the War Problem. 
### 
B. N. Langdon-Davies, English au
thority on economic problems, and
member of the Garton Foundation for
the study of international problems,
interested an Assembly this morning
with a lecture on "The Great Illus
ion." The economic evil of national
armament was put forth in two forms,
first, the destructive drain of actual
warfare, and second, the check on na
tional progress ot' armed peace. The
speaker based considerable portions
of his address on the book "The Great
Illusion," by Norman Angell. Parts ot'
the address follow:
"There are in the world three kinds
of people. First, those who do not
find any problems in life; second,
those who see problems but do not
find a solution: and third, those who
see the problems and set about solv
ing them. You people in this country
represent the latter class.
Three Theories.
"The most serious present day prob
lem is that of war, â€”or rather, the
double problem of war and armed
peace. Warfare is practically absent
from the earth, but nations are engag
ed in constant rehearsal for a war
which may never come off. The result
of headlong effort at military and
naval armament is a continual drain
on commerce and industry.
"You can't spend wealth on unpro
ductive things and remain prosperous.

What solutions for the problem have
been proposed hitherto?
"First, the militarists advance the
proposition that it' you want peace,
prepare for war. 1 question if that
policy prevents war, for it has been
the unavailing maxim ever since the
time of our remotest ancestors.
"Second, is the solution advanced
by the old peace advocates, which
'No arms.' That plan does not appeal
to us, for in the words of Norman An
gell, 'So far as we have gone in human
history, we feel that if there is going
to be a feast, we would rather be the
diner than the dinner.' The act of
defense is a claim that reason and in
telligence are justified to protect
themselves against opposition.

"The third solution is that of Nor
man Angell and the Garton Founda
tion. We have reached the following
conclusions: first, that men are led
by phrases, without giving thought to
what they mean; second, that those
phrases are almost without exception
out of date, and have no relation to
the facts of the world. Many of the
professors, statesmen, and economists
of my country are looking back in his
tory for a solution instead of feeling
the pulse of life about them.
"All nations of the world are in
creasing their armies for the purpose
of defense, not that any one of them
