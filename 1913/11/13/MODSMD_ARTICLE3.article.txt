# WARFARE AND ARMED PEACE DECLARED ECONOMIC DRAINS
## Langdon-Davies, British Economist, Looks to the American Nation For a Solution of the War Problem. 
### 
B. N. Langdon-Davies, English au
thority on economic problems, and
member of the Garton Foundation for
the study of international problems,
interested an Assembly this morning
with a lecture on "The Great Illus
ion." The economic evil of national
armament was put forth in two forms,
first, the destructive drain of actual
warfare, and second, the check on na
tional progress ot' armed peace. The
speaker based considerable portions
of his address on the book "The Great
Illusion," by Norman Angell. Parts ot'
the address follow:
"There are in the world three kinds
of people. First, those who do not
find any problems in life; second,
those who see problems but do not
find a solution: and third, those who
see the problems and set about solv
ing them. You people in this country
represent the latter class.
Three Theories.
"The most serious present day prob
lem is that of war, —or rather, the
double problem of war and armed
peace. Warfare is practically absent
from the earth, but nations are engag
ed in constant rehearsal for a war
which may never come off. The result
of headlong effort at military and
naval armament is a continual drain
on commerce and industry.
"You can't spend wealth on unpro
ductive things and remain prosperous.

What solutions for the problem have
been proposed hitherto?
"First, the militarists advance the
proposition that it' you want peace,
prepare for war. 1 question if that
policy prevents war, for it has been
the unavailing maxim ever since the
time of our remotest ancestors.
"Second, is the solution advanced
by the old peace advocates, which
'No arms.' That plan does not appeal
to us, for in the words of Norman An
gell, 'So far as we have gone in human
history, we feel that if there is going
to be a feast, we would rather be the
diner than the dinner.' The act of
defense is a claim that reason and in
telligence are justified to protect
themselves against opposition.

"The third solution is that of Nor
man Angell and the Garton Founda
tion. We have reached the following
conclusions: first, that men are led
by phrases, without giving thought to
what they mean; second, that those
phrases are almost without exception
out of date, and have no relation to
the facts of the world. Many of the
professors, statesmen, and economists
of my country are looking back in his
tory for a solution instead of feeling
the pulse of life about them.
"All nations of the world are in
creasing their armies for the purpose
of defense, not that any one of them
is going to attack, but because each
one thinks that every other nation is
going to attack. "
The speaker then summarized the
war scares in various countries, men
tioned the inflammable speeches of
militarist speakers.
He continued: "If you have spent
your last penny in defense, you have
nothing left to defend, are starving,
and looking for a chance lo kill your
selves by the quickest method
"The only purpose for attack is that
by conquest you can win advantages.
Norman Angell says that as the con
quered nation is worse off at the end
of a war, no also is the conquering na
tion, perhaps in greater degree. Ger
many and England are each other's
best customers. If they fight, neither
will gain. After a war, people have
to work longer hours, wages are poor.
As to the advantage of acquisition of
territory, people forget that when the
conquerors annex territory they also
annex the people who inhabit and ow i
the territory. There is no new gain.
"Concerning the militarist theory
that war leads to the survival of the
fittest, your own Chancellor is a mas
ter student. The unfit are allowed to
stay at home, to live, and to breed the
next generation. The fit men make
marks for the bullets of the enemy,
suffer disease, and are destroyed.
That is the militarist idea of survival
of the fittest.
"War can only decide one thing—
which nation is strongest. It does not
vindicate national honor, as the mili
tarists claim.
"Such militarists as Homer Lea in
your own country, and Lord Roberts
in mine, declare that because we live
at peace we are becoming idle, lethar
gic, and indolent. They say in the
same breath that we must have bigger
armies and navies to avoid war. There
is poor reasoning, lack of logic some
where in their argument. I wonder
if the nations who fight most do con
trol the destiny of the world, and are
the most vigorous?
"I believe that America, England,
and Germany control the destiny of
the world because they believe in rea
son, not force.
"We've got to create public opinion,
which will back up our statement when
they are right. In the end, whatever
form of government there is, public
opinion ultimately controls.
"You Americans stand apart from
the quarrels of Europe. From across
the Atlantic you can see the absurdity
of the fearsome superstitions which
impelled the other nations. I believe
that, clear thought is coming from this
side of the Atlantic.
"In conclusion, with regard to the
Mexican situation. You ask if T think
that there is no place in the world for
force. Yes, for a long time there will
be a place for force, —the police force.

There is room for a force which de
nies the right of any nation to cut its
own throats, or the throats of others,
and to destroy national resources. It
is the right and duty of some nation
to interpose force in such a case.
"I hope that you will learn more of
the great illusion of war, secure books
from your libraries and from Con
gress, and send men to the Senate who
will help to set straight thinking to

with a lecture on "The Great Illus

armament was put forth in two forms,
first, the destructive drain of actual
warfare, and second, the check on na
tional progress ot' armed peace. The
speaker based considerable portions
of his address on the book "The Great
Illusion," by Norman Angell. Parts ot'
the address follow:
"There are in the world three kinds
of people. First, those who do not
find any problems in life; second,
those who see problems but do not
find a solution: and third, those who
see the problems and set about solv
ing them. You people in this country
represent the latter class.
Three Theories.
"The most serious present day prob
lem is that of war, —or rather, the
double problem of war and armed
peace. Warfare is practically absent
from the earth, but nations are engag
ed in constant rehearsal for a war
which may never come off. The result
of headlong effort at military and
naval armament is a continual drain
on commerce and industry.
"You can't spend wealth on unpro

"First, the militarists advance the
proposition that it' you want peace,
prepare for war. 1 question if that
policy prevents war, for it has been
the unavailing maxim ever since the

"Second, is the solution advanced
by the old peace advocates, which
'No arms.' That plan does not appeal

history, we feel that if there is going
to be a feast, we would rather be the
diner than the dinner.' The act of
defense is a claim that reason and in
telligence are justified to protect
themselves against opposition.

"The third solution is that of Nor

conclusions: first, that men are led
by phrases, without giving thought to
what they mean; second, that those

B. N. Langdon-Davies, English au
thority on economic problems, and
member of the Garton Foundation for
the study of international problems,
interested an Assembly this morning
with a lecture on "The Great Illus
ion." The economic evil of national
armament was put forth in two forms,
first, the destructive drain of actual
warfare, and second, the check on na
tional progress ot' armed peace. The
speaker based considerable portions
of his address on the book "The Great
Illusion," by Norman Angell. Parts ot'
the address follow:
"There are in the world three kinds
of people. First, those who do not
find any problems in life; second,
those who see problems but do not
find a solution: and third, those who
see the problems and set about solv
ing them. You people in this country
represent the latter class.
Three Theories.
"The most serious present day prob
lem is that of war, —or rather, the
double problem of war and armed
peace. Warfare is practically absent
from the earth, but nations are engag
ed in constant rehearsal for a war
which may never come off. The result
of headlong effort at military and
naval armament is a continual drain
on commerce and industry.
"You can't spend wealth on unpro
ductive things and remain prosperous.

What solutions for the problem have
been proposed hitherto?
"First, the militarists advance the
proposition that it' you want peace,
prepare for war. 1 question if that
policy prevents war, for it has been
the unavailing maxim ever since the
time of our remotest ancestors.
"Second, is the solution advanced
by the old peace advocates, which
'No arms.' That plan does not appeal
to us, for in the words of Norman An
gell, 'So far as we have gone in human
history, we feel that if there is going
to be a feast, we would rather be the
diner than the dinner.' The act of
defense is a claim that reason and in
telligence are justified to protect
themselves against opposition.

"The third solution is that of Nor
man Angell and the Garton Founda
tion. We have reached the following
conclusions: first, that men are led
by phrases, without giving thought to
what they mean; second, that those
phrases are almost without exception
out of date, and have no relation to
the facts of the world. Many of the
professors, statesmen, and economists
of my country are looking back in his
tory for a solution instead of feeling
the pulse of life about them.
"All nations of the world are in
creasing their armies for the purpose
of defense, not that any one of them
is going to attack, but because each
one thinks that every other nation is
going to attack. "
The speaker then summarized the
war scares in various countries, men
tioned the inflammable speeches of
militarist speakers.
He continued: "If you have spent
your last penny in defense, you have
nothing left to defend, are starving,
and looking for a chance lo kill your
selves by the quickest method
"The only purpose for attack is that
by conquest you can win advantages.
Norman Angell says that as the con
quered nation is worse off at the end
of a war, no also is the conquering na
tion, perhaps in greater degree. Ger
many and England are each other's
best customers. If they fight, neither
will gain. After a war, people have
to work longer hours, wages are poor.
As to the advantage of acquisition of
territory, people forget that when the
conquerors annex territory they also
annex the people who inhabit and ow i
the territory. There is no new gain.
"Concerning the militarist theory
that war leads to the survival of the
fittest, your own Chancellor is a mas
ter student. The unfit are allowed to
stay at home, to live, and to breed the
next generation. The fit men make
marks for the bullets of the enemy,
suffer disease, and are destroyed.
That is the militarist idea of survival
of the fittest.
"War can only decide one thing—
which nation is strongest. It does not
vindicate national honor, as the mili
tarists claim.
"Such militarists as Homer Lea in
your own country, and Lord Roberts
in mine, declare that because we live
at peace we are becoming idle, lethar
gic, and indolent. They say in the
same breath that we must have bigger
armies and navies to avoid war. There
is poor reasoning, lack of logic some
where in their argument. I wonder
if the nations who fight most do con
trol the destiny of the world, and are
the most vigorous?
"I believe that America, England,
and Germany control the destiny of
the world because they believe in rea
son, not force.
"We've got to create public opinion,
which will back up our statement when
they are right. In the end, whatever
form of government there is, public
opinion ultimately controls.
"You Americans stand apart from
the quarrels of Europe. From across
the Atlantic you can see the absurdity
of the fearsome superstitions which
impelled the other nations. I believe
that, clear thought is coming from this
side of the Atlantic.
"In conclusion, with regard to the
Mexican situation. You ask if T think
that there is no place in the world for
force. Yes, for a long time there will
be a place for force, —the police force.

There is room for a force which de
nies the right of any nation to cut its
own throats, or the throats of others,
and to destroy national resources. It
is the right and duty of some nation
to interpose force in such a case.
"I hope that you will learn more of
the great illusion of war, secure books
from your libraries and from Con
gress, and send men to the Senate who
