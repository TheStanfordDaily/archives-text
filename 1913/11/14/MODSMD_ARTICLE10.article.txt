# LANGDON-DAVIES SPEAKS OF ENGLAND'S ATHLETICS.
## 
### 
According to the viewpoint of B. N.
Langdon-Davies, there has been no
general decline in English athletics.
This was the opinion given by the dis
tinguished peace advocate during his
recent visit to Stanford. He gave the
instance of English superiority in row
ing, and the fact that an Englishman
holds the golf championship to re
fute this generally circulated im
pression.
"The cause of the slight decline is
not due to any decadence, but to other
causes," said Langdon-Davies. "One
of these is the periodic rising and fall
ing of nations in such respects. In
athletics, there are periods when one
is on to]) and then another."
Another reason given by the visitor
as to why the English have not been
so successful of late was the fact that
they are not out primarily to win. The
final reason was the way in which the
Britons train for events. They do not
work so strenuously as do the Ameri
cans.
Although he had kept in touch with
British athletics of late, Langdon-Dav
ies would not venture an opinion as
to England's showing in the next
Olympic games.
