# An Unadulterated Fake
## 
### 
Stanford sportsmanship has been at
tacked by the publication of one of the
most fabulous myths yet uninclosed
by the covers of a six best sellers.

Founded upon an en
tire 1 y groundless
charge, one of the
San Francisco dailies
has given a start to

a "kidnapping story" which is a pal
pable fake. It has been printed that
Stanford students attempted by force
to prevent one of the Cardinal track
athletes from sailing for the Antipo
des with an American team because
it would injure the chances for an in
tercollegiate cinder path victory next
spring. The story in its absurdity
would not require an answer but for
the fact that the paper which first
printed it continues in an endeavor to
â€¢mislead the reading public.
The alleged kidnapping tale has
been spread about through the press.
The facts are untrue in themselves.
Such absolute prevarications are not
only deregatory to the best interests
or college sport, but are disgusting to
those who know the utter lack of
truth in them.
