### 
With the clear weather of the past
two days hardening the surface of Cal
ifornia Field, the thirty rugby players
who will represent New Zealand and
America in the International match
tomorrow were out in suits today for
a final practice. The All Star squad
is under the direction of George Pres
ley, '07.
The All Blacks have named their
strongest fifteen for the last contest!
in this state, and with the field in fair
shape they should give a masterly ex
hibition of football skill against the
California players. The All Blacks'
scores for the tour now total 462
points, while their own line has been
crossed but once.
The New Zealand team will use the
wing forward formation, while the All
Stars pin their faith to the three-two
tliree scrum..
W. W. Hill will referee the contest,
and this insures that the play will be
open and will not be unnecessarily de
layed. The players will be called on
the field at 1:30 p.m., in order that the
visiting men may take the steamer
leaving for the north at 4:30. The line
ups follow:
All Stars —Hall, McKim, Glasscock,
Blase, Voiglit, Darsie, King and Gard.
