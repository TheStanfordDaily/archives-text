# ALL-AMERICA YIELDS INTERNATIONAL MATCH TO ALL-BLACK SKILL
## 
### 
All America vs. All New Zealand
was a struggle between enthusiastic
novices and well balanced experts.
When the experience of the All Blacks
was matched against the inexperi
ence of the youthful Americans there
could be but one outcome. The older
team won. Isut the visiting wearers
of the silver fern put up the best ex
hibition of their present tour in order
to roll up 51 points while their op
ponents gathered three.
Stanford and California divided hon
ors in scoring the only points regis
tered by the losers. "Mow" Mitchell,
displaying the old form which stamp
ed him a star when he wore the Card
inal, ran thirty yards through a scat
tered field with Danny Carroll ready
to take his pass, when an over-anx
ious All Black tackled Danny before
he had the ball. A penalty kick gave
Peart, of California, an opportunity
to boot the ball Viet ween the goal
posts for a trio of points.
Seven members of Stanford's vic
torious 1913 team wore the American
shield Saturday. Three former wear
ers of the Cardinal jersey played be
side them.
Card showed the spectators that his
teammates had made no mistake in
naming him as their captain, and was
one of the most conspicuous players
on the field. He broke through the
opposing ranks continually, and was
a constant source of worry to the All
Black backfield players. On numer
ous occasions he dribbled through for
substantial gains. Darsie, who part
nered Gard as breakaway, was equal
ly effective in spoiling the attempts
of the halfback to get the New Zeal
and backs in action.
"Jumbo" Blase demonstrated his
superiority over the other American
scrum men in the line outs, and re
peatedly took the ball on the throw in.
No man on the team played a more
consistent game than did Hall, at
front rank. By falling on the ball
time after time he foiled many a drib
1)1 ing rush on the part of the All
Macks' forwards.
Charlie Austin gained many yards
for the All Americans by his kicks to
touch, and his swerving runs were a
feature of the game. Carroll was well
marked by his opponents, who feared
to give him an opportunity with the
ball. Danny played a saving game
and kept the Americans out of many
difficulties by stopping up the play
near the goal line and booting the
ball into touch. One of the best runs
of the game was made by Urban in
the second half of the game, when he
circled the scrum for a twenty yard
gain, which kept the visitors busy
protecting their goal line.
When Peart was switched to full
back "Stubby" Stolz, '09, went in at
wing and immediately started attack
ing. The former Oxford star made
several gains before before final time
put an end to the effort to cross the
All Black's line.
"Louie" Cass, last year's Varsity
leader, played one of the best games
of his career. He was in the midst of
every play and was kept busy falling
on the ball to prevent dribbling rush
es. McKim showed much of the ag
gressiveness which has characterized
his play this season.
The All blacks exhibited everything
in their rugby repertoireâ€”feinting,
running, dodging, dribbling, sure
catching, team combination, every
thing.
The great work of the forwards sup
ported by the clever work of the
backs, who opened up the play in the
loose was responsible for the large
score rolled up by the New Zealanders.
Fullback Cuthill, of the All blacks,
was given the busiest session he has
had on the tour because of the deter
mined attack of the Americans, who
frequently carried or booted the ball
into the visitors' danger zone.
