# ALL-AMERICA YIELDS INTERNATIONAL MATCH TO ALL-BLACK SKILL
## 
### 
All America vs. All New Zealand
was a struggle between enthusiastic
novices and well balanced experts.
When the experience of the All Blacks
was matched against the inexperi

could be but one outcome. The older
team won. Isut the visiting wearers
of the silver fern put up the best ex
hibition of their present tour in order
to roll up 51 points while their op
ponents gathered three.
Stanford and California divided hon

substantial gains. Darsie, who part

of the halfback to get the New Zeal
and backs in action.
"Jumbo" Blase demonstrated his
superiority over the other American
scrum men in the line outs, and re
peatedly took the ball on the throw in.
No man on the team played a more
consistent game than did Hall, at
front rank. By falling on the ball
time after time he foiled many a drib
