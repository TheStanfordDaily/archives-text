## 
### 
Burnt cork and banjos will furnish
entertainment for the women of the
university Thursday afternoon at Ro
ble. Fifteen dusky ladies well known
on the Quad will lend color to the oc
casion, and the air will resound with
darky jokes and melodies. The min
strel show is being planned as the
monthly entertainment of the Women's
League, and will be given promptly at
4:30.
