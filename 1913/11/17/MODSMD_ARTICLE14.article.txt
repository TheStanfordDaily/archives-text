# Captain Gard
## 
### 
In the selection of Frank Jacob
Gard to captain the 1914 Varsity rug
by fifteen a merited athletic honor
has been conferred upon one of Stan
ford's most deserving sons. The new-

ly chosen leader has with
stood the brunt of three In
tercollegiate Varsity matches
and in addition has won his

block letter on the track. Twice his
superior ability as a player has won
him a place on the Ail-American team
in the International contests with the
exponents of the game from the coun
tries of the Southern Cross and Silver
Fern. An experienced leader, steeped
in the Stanford ideals of sportsman
ship and fair play, the new captain
will bring additional glory to himself
and his university. The naming of
Frank Gard as captain augers well for
a repetition of the past season's suc
cess.
