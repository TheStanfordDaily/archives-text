### 
Miss Donoldina Cameron, who was
to speak at the meeting of the Y. W.
C. A.on Tuesday on Chinese Rescue
Work, will be unable to give her talk
until after Christmas. The opportuni
ty which her absence affords will be
used to lay an important matter be
fore the membership of the associa
tion, and a large attendance is desir
ed.
