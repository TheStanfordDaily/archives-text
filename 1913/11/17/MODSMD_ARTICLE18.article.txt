# TWO STANFORD MEN PASS RHODES SCHOLARSHIP TEST
## ERROR OMITTED J.D. COOKE FROM ELIGIBLE LIST Successful Candidate Who Will Receive Appointment Will Be Announced Next Month. 
### 
The two candidates from Stanford
who took the Rhodes Scholarchip ex
aminations this year were successful
in passing the tests instead of one as
was previously announced. J. D.
Cooke, '14, and J. D. Adams, '15, to
gether with E. Hollmann, who passed
the examinations last year, are eligible
to appointment this year.
The error which omitted Cooke's
name from the list of successful can
didates is due to a confusion of names
of those who took the examinations
this year. It seems that a Cook from
another university took the examina
tions at Berkeley, and when the cable
gram was received submitting a list of
those who passed it was taken for
granted that he was the successful
candidate.
Professor Fairclough, of the Latin
department and chairman of the
Rhodes Scholarship committee here, is
authority for the statement that .T. D.
Cooke is ihe one who passed the test.
Cooke is a Senior, registering in the
Greek department, from Palo Alto. He
entered the University with the class
of 1915, but will complete the four
year course in three years and receive
his A. B. degree May, 1914. He is a
member of the Stanford band and sec
retary of the Classical club.
The successful candidate who will
receive the appointment will be an
nounced next month. The Rhodes
Scholarship committee for the state
consists of Presidents Brainier, of
Stanford, Wheeler, of California, and
Dean Norton, of Pomona. For the se
lection of the scholar sub-committees
are appointed in the University of Cali
fornia and Stanford. Professor H. M.
Stevens is the chairman of the local
committee at California, while Pro
fessors H. R. Fairclough, F. Angell,
and V. L. Kellogg, form the commit
tee at Stanford.
