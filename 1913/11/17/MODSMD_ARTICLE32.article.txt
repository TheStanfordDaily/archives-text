# FITCH DEPLORES TASTE FOR ”TRASHY” READING
## PUBLISHERS NAMES NO LONGER GUARANTEE OF WORTH Journalist Advises Readers to Seek Out Worth-while Writers; Discusses Books.

"There is much comment on the
wave of frivolity that has become ap
parent during the last ten years," was
the opening statement of George Ham
lin Fitch, journalist and editor, in his
lecture on "Good Books," given in the
Chapel.
"The tendency," he continued, "is
evidenced in the increased volume of
trashy literature of recent years, and
the public taste for the musical com
edy and vaudeville.
"This depravity seems to be due to
the mercenary spirit. Until recent
years the imprint of the name of Har
per or Putnam as publisher was guar
antee of the book. Magazines of the
same type have succumbed to the
craze for novelties, and all alike in
dulge in such hyperboles as 'the
greatest book ever.'
"All such ephemerial material should
be rigidly barred, and our short time
devoted to that which really has a
place in literature. The Bible is the
greatest book. There is something in
it which even the richest authors have
not. The limpid, spiritual, unlabored
writing of Hawthorne is a refresh
ment. Poetry as that of Kipling, with
his dynamic force should appeal to
everyone.
".My admonition is to not follow the
mob and read this or that most popu
lar book. It will pass away in a sea
son and you will have lost nothing.
Stay with the old authors who have
the style and the thought.
"Let a regular period each, as in
the case of physical exercise, be set
aside for the reading of some good
old book. Poetry or rythmetic com
position should be read aloud to get
the most value from it." The speak
er concluded with a discussion of the
best authors and poets.
