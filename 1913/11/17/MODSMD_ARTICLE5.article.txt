# POMONA’S PRESIDENT IS HEARD IN STRONG SERMON
## "MOTIVES AND MEN” SUBJECT OF DR. BLAISDELL Compelling Force of Hunger Is Told of Yesterday in the Memorial Church. 
### 
"Motives and Men" was the subject
of a forceful sermon by Rev. James A.
Blaisdell, president of Pomona Col
lege, yesterday in the Memorial
Church. He said in part:
"We see the world in many ways
according as we look at it, the econo
mist in one way, the astronomer in
another; and to some it is a world
made up of a range of motives from
that strongest, most primitive one—
hunger, up to the finest motive of
man's soul— the privilege of being
the son of Cod."
He used the prodigal son as an ex
ample of the motive of hunger and
thirst which is the compelling force
in many lives. "He could hear no
call in his own soul nor in the world
outside until he heard the call of a
man starving to death and was sum
moned back by that last call by which
God summons back man to his em
pire—the call of hunger. He hears
nothing until he comes to feeding
upon the husks and then he said, 'I
will arise and go to my father.'"
"The status of right living is to
make vivid to fine's self in one's daily
life the great motive, for men and
women can he awakened into life by
p, good motive.
"What is all this world of motives?
It is the voice of Cod. It is God. The
very foundation of our theme is that
Jesus is the representation of God in
this world and through Jesus we come
to understand God so that we say, 'I
live, but not I, for Christ liveth in
me."
