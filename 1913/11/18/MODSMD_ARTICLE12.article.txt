Manager George H. Mason of tho
New Zealand All Blacks was almost
among those lel't behind Saturday
when the visitors made a rush for the
steamer "Congress" after the game
He failed to notice its departure, but
by hiring a launch and signalling the
captain, he was able to join his team.
The All Hlacks will play three games
in Canada. Two will be in Vancouver
and the third in Victoria. They sail
from Vancouver for New Zealand No
