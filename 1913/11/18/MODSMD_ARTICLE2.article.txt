# GOOD EATS IN THE INN ON SATURDAY NOON
## La
						Liana Will Hold Annual Cafeteria for Benefit of Women's Clubhouse Fund. 
### 
The Stanford Inn will be the scene
of post-season festivities Saturday
noon. La Liana and Cap and Gown'
are uniting energies to prepare a huge
benefit for the Women's club-house in
the form of the annual cafeteria, for
which Palo Alto cooks have won fame
in years past.
Good eats, Thanksgiving eats, home
made eats, there will lie in abundance.
Dishes "lit for queen"-ers or roughs
alike, food for any taste, as well as
music and a gala time, are among the
attractions which will convert the
abandoned Inn to the most popular
center of activity.
Every house and eating club on the
campus will be asked to give their
own cooks a special vacation on Sat
urday so that no one need miss the
rare opportunity to enjoy "good food
in the Inn for once."
Now that the club-house is so near
its beginning special interest attache-;
to every movement to swell the neces
sary funds, and those who remember
the former successful La Liana cafe
teria are confident of a marked addi
tion in receipts due to the change in
holding the affair on the campus this
year, instead of as formerly in Palo
Alto.
