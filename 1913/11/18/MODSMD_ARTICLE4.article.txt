# CROSS COUNTRY COURSE SHORT THIS YEAR
## First Seven to Finish Win Numerals; Annual Fall Track Meet Cancelled. 
### 
The annual fall interclass cross
country run will be started from the
rugby turf Saturday afternoon at 2:30.
The start will be made from a line
opposite Section E of the bleachers.
The finish will alt-o be made on the
turf. The run will be a part of the
entertainment offered the spectators
of the interclub rugby match.
When the first runners return from
their course of three and seven-tenths
miles, the rugby match will be finish
ed. The seven men who finish first
will be awarded their class numerals.
A feature of this year's run is that
the course is much shorter than the
one of four and a half miles followed
last year. The runners will leave the
football field through the south gate,
passing the eating clubs, go to Col
lege Terrace, follow Stanford avenue
to the county road, enter the main
gate to the university, follow the ave
nue to the diagonal road leading to
the Faculty club-house, and run past
the football bleachers to the south
gate, finishing inside the turf.
The cross country run will be the
only interclass competition held this
season. The usual track meet will not
be held. The reasons are that on ac
count of early training this year and
entrance in outside meets the men
have worked in good condition, and
that an organized meet at this part of
the season would interfere with final
examinations.
