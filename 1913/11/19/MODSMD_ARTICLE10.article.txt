Northern California will be ably
represented on the rugby turf in the
All Star Interscholastic match sched
uled for Thanksgiving Day. A glance

over the list of the nineteen
players chosen by the selec
tion committee gives ample
evidence of this. The five

men 011 whom was placed the task ol
choosing the best possible team have
performed their duty well. Skull and
Snakes society, under whose manage
ment the project has been, feels obli
gated to Mr. Sproutt, Mr. Erskine,
Mr. Presley, Mr. Ditz, and Mr.
Schaupp, and desire to thank them
for their efforts in the interest of the
All Star game.
