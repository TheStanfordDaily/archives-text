# The
						Game
## 
### 
With all the preliminary prepara
tions completed, the success of the
game on Thanksgiving Day depends

upon the support given by the
Student Body. Never before
has there been staged a cham
pionship match of this nat

ure. Each year an all star team
has been chdsen by the rugby critics,
but the championship match has bee 1
a "paper" battle only, with each ex
pert picking his own winner. This
year a real contest will be played.
The All Star I nterscholastic game is
of university interest. Moost it.
