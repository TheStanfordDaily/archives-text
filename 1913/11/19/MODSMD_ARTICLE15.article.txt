# PLANS COMPLETED FOR SATURDAY'S CAFETERIA.
## 
### 
Plans ure rapidly being completed
for the big cafeteria luncheon to be
held Saturday in the Inn under the
auspices of La Liana and Cap and
Gown.
In former years La Liana has held
its annual cafeteria in the second sem
ester, which is also the time of hold
ing the pie-Panama fair. This year
it was decided not to detract from
either of the two big affairs by hold
ing them so near together.
In addition to the cafeteria lunch
eon there will be plenty of fresh fruit,
home-made candy, cakes and pies,
which can be purchased and taken
home.
The cafeteria will be open from 11
o'clock until three.
