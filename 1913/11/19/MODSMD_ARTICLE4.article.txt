The nineteen rugby players who will represent All Northern
California preparatory schools in the match for the interscholastic
championship of the state are announced for the first time by Skull
and Snakes society. C. S. Morris, 'OS, of Palo Alto, will act as coach
and manager of the Northern team.
Within the next few days the nineteen interscholastic ruggers who
are to represent the South will be announced. Though a provisional
list of the eligibles from South of the Tehachapi has been submitted
by the judges, Skull and Snakes is awaiting additional information
before naming the team.
After comparing the records of various schools in the Northern
province during the rugby season, the committee of five judges made
a personal study of the individual players who were responsible for
the best playing. Their choice represents the final judgment of foot
ball experts. That fact is reasonable assurance that the ruggers who
wear the shield of the Northern team in the first interscholastic
rugby match held in America will be the best athletes available. A
general interest in the project of the Thanksgiving match has been
shown by all the schools of the state that are playing the English
game. Eagerness on the part of the schools has made the task of
selection comparatively easy.
The judges who submitted the names are: Douglas Erskine, San
Francisco; K. L. Schaupp, Stanford; G.. J. Presley, San Francisco;
G. A. I)itz, Stockton, and W. E. Sprctt, Porterville.
A wide territory is represented in the lineup of the Northern
team. Sixteen high schools and academies have contributed players.
Palo Alto and Berkeley high schools, and Boone's Acadamy, of Berke
ley, are represented by two men each. The other sixteen members of
the team represent as many schools.
The definite time for arrival of tbe Northern and Southern teams
has not 1 ?en set. Each squad will have several days to spend in
practice on the local turf. Under tbe instruction of their managing
coaches and Varsity "S" men who will be appointed for the purpose,
good team work should be developed before the match. W. P. Fuller,
'10, will be asked to act as referee.
Following is the All Northern team:
