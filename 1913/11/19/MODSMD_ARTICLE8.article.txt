ford tlie winners in the cross country
meet this year which will be run on

class numerals. The first seven men

ures. This was made possible this

country match as an interclass affair.
Heretofore it has been run more on
the basis of the first man across the
line wins the race, but this year each
class will count in the final score.
About thirty men have been training
regularly for th:s annual event, and
will toe the mark in the crucial test
on Saturday. For the past two months
the cross country men have been tak
ing long runs regularly three times
a week in order to work into condi
tion. At first the length of the runs
was not more than a mile or two, but
now the runners regularly travel foiu
miles three times a week.
The distance is nearly a mile short
er this year for the cross country
1 ace than last season. The reason for
this is that the runners have, as a
rule, not covered much more than this
in a single day, and to lengthen it
would be to over tax the competitors.
I he start and finish will be from the
rugby turf and the distance to be run
is three and seven-tenths miles. To
