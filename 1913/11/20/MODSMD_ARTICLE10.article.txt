## 
### 
Great interest is centering around
the iiual game of the post season rug
by series, which is to be played Sat
urday afternoon at 2:30 on the turf.
A small admission of twenty-five cent;*
v, II I u charged the spectators. The
teams which have qualified for the
semi-finals have played a very good
brand of rugby in the preliminary
matches, and Saturday's contest should
compare favorably with many of the
trial games which were played by the
Varsity early in the season, it is ex
pected that a large crowd of rooters
will assemble for the support of the
contestants.
The committee in charge of the af
fair has arranged for a battle between
the giants and the pigmies of the col
lege as a diversion for the fans be
tween the halves of the main contest,
and several other minor stunts are
being worked up to fill out the pro
gram.
Saturday's contestants will be pick
ed from the winners of today's semi
iinals. Team 2, Phi Delta Tlieta and
Phi Kappa Psi, played Team 4, Zeta
Pi and Delta Kappa Epsilon, and the
victor in this scrimmage will meet the
successful fifteen in the contest be
tween Team G, representing the cof
bilied strength of Chi Psi and Delta
Upsilon, and Team S, composed of
players from the Delta Chi, Delta Tau
Delta, and Sigma Nu fraternities.
An added attraction will consist in
the annual fall cross country races,
which are to start and finish on the
turf, in full view of the audience.
