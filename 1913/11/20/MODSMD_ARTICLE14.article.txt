Because of the necessity of meeting
certain expenses incident to the stag
ing of the All Star Intercollegiate
rugby game on Thanksgiving Day, it
has been found expedient to begin a
campaign for financial support among
the students in advance of the day set
for the contest. The success of the
match as far as the game is concerned
is assured. The state's best prepara
tory school players are to participate.
But if the venture is to be a success
financially it is incumbent upon every
member of the Student Body to get be
hind the project. Possession of a tick
et to the All Star contest is an excell
ent evidence of a boosting spirit.
