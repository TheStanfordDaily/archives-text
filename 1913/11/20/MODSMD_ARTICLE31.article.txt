# PICTURES FOR QUAD MUST BE TAKEN NOW.
## 
### 
All fraternities, organizations and
clubs are requested by the manage
ment of the 1915 Quad to have their
pictures taken before Christmas vaca
tion. it is imperative that this be
done this semester in order that the
photographer and the engraver can
devote their entire time next semester
to the events of the college year.
Many of the Juniors have paid their
Quad assessment but few have had
their picture taken. In order to obtain
the best results and if necessary have
more than one sitting they must see
Davey, the photographer, this semes
ter. Otherwise, the work will lie rush
ed, and perfection will have to bo
overlooked in order to make the best
of the time available.
