# CROSS COUNTRY RUN ASSURED SUCCESS TEAMS TO PLAY FOR THE RUGBY TITLE
## 
### 
Sports on the turf will be the program for a Stanford "at home" tomor
row afternoon. Inteiclub rugby will be the star event. The two rugby
lil'ieens that qualify in the semi-final matches this afternoon will contest
tomorrow for the Timothy Hopkins trophy, which will be engraved with
the name of the post season victors.
The annual interclass cross country run will start from the field at
2:30, and after following a course of three and seven-tenths miles the racers
will finish in sight of the bleachers. The contest of forty-seven men of all
four classes for the seven sweaters and class numerals available will be an
object of interest to spectators.
Immediately after the runners have started, the final rugby match will
be started. When the first cross country men come into view on the return,
the match will be stopped in order to give the bleachers a clear view of the
finish.
Between halves of the football game, a burlesque match will be played
between the long and short athletic aspirants of the campus. Other comedy
events are promised by the Skull and Snakes management which will be
sprung as a surprise.
Twenty-five cents will admit to the football bleachers, giving full view
of all the turf events.
