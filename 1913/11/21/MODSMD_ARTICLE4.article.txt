Post-season rugby for this fall will
!jo brought to a close tomorrow after
noon at Stanford Field, when Team 2,
I "'hi Delta Theta and Phi Kappa Psi,
will meet the winner of today's rugby
battle between Teams 4 and 0. The
contest for the club rugby champion
ship of the University is attracting
unusual interest among the fans, as
a high grade of football has been
played throughout the series.
Teams 2 and 4 played a no-score
;.m e yesterday and this made a draw--
ing for today's match necessary. The
Phi Delta Theta-Phi Kappa Psi com
bination drew the bye, insuring their
place in tomorrow's finals. The fif
teen from the Delta Upsilon and C'hi
Psi houses meet the Zeta Psi-Delt;}
Kappa Epsilon team this afternoon.
The prize at stake is the beautiful
silver trophy donated by Timothy
Hopkins early last season. The post
season series of 1912 was not finished
and the huge bowl of silver engraved
"Hopkin's Trophy" remained in the
trophy room.
This year a different method of
picking the club teams was tried, and
the result was a hard fought series
of games, with practically all availa
ble rugby material represented.
Between halves tomorrow there will
be a burlesque battle of the Pigmies
and Giants, with several other lively
â– tiirl interesting stunts which have
been prepared by the committee in
charge. An admission fee of twenty
j five cents will be charged to the game,
i which will be called at 2:30 o'clock.
