## LEIB, COYLE AND JOHNSON WIN DEBATE Unanimous Decision for Stanford Rendered by Judges Including City Mayors. 
### 
Girls' Auditorium in San Francisco
was tlie scene of a Stanford victory in
the twenty-flrst annual debate with
the University of California last Sat
urday evening. The auditorium with
its seating capacity of 2,500 was com
pleted filled to hear successfully ar
gued "That all immigration to the
United States of unskilled laborers of
the Italic, Slavic and Hellenic races
from Southern and Eastern Europe
should be prohibited."
The decision which was quickly
reached by the three judges was unani
mous for Stanford. The judges were
Mayors James Rolph, of San Fran
cisco; and Frank Mott, of Oakland;
and John L. McNab, of San Francisco.
The three Stanford debators were
K. E. Leib, *13; A. F. Coyle, '15, and A.
L. Johnson, 'Hi; California was repre»
sented by E. K. Sturgis, \Y. 0. Mar
vin, and A. W. Drury.
A. F. Coyle, '15, the first speaker for
Stanford, pointed out. that the true
question regarding the admittance of
these races was not whether they
might be assimilated but what the re
sult of that assimilation would be. He
also showed the importance to Califor
nia of deciding this question now be
fore the beginning of a large immigra
tion to this country. That these people
are morally, politically and socially in
ferior and that the affirmative offered
a thoroughly practical plan for their
exclusion he proved conclusively.
Sturgis advanced the claims of the
literacy test and other forms of selec
tion as opposed lo prohibition by racial
discrimination, and in this connection
pointed out the difficulty of determin
ing race and also unskilled laborers.
Stanford's second speaker, A. L.
Johnson, '16, enlarged upon the cheap
and vile living conditions of the South
ern Europeans and showed how this
would tend to lower wages. He stated
that "An overstocked labor supply has
led to a condition of wages being divid
ed in half by men who worked only 160
days in the year, there being no work
all the time for everybody."
Marvin in the second speech for the
negative sought to show that these
people were a positive benefit to the
country in its industrial and agricul
tural development.
The argument of the third affirma
tive speaker, K. E. Leib, squarely de
nied that the Italians would aid any
in advancing intensive farming, al
though they carry it on successfully
at home they are merely skillful imi
tators and are not. qualified to intro
duce it into a country where it has
not been carried on to any extent. He
then showed that people of South
eastern Europe are unable to appre
ciate democratic institutions, citing the
case of Argentina with her large im
migration from these countries.
Professor A. M. Cathcart of the
Stanford Law Department presided

mous for Stanford. The judges were
Mayors James Rolph, of San Fran
cisco; and Frank Mott, of Oakland;
and John L. McNab, of San Francisco.
The three Stanford debators were
K. E. Leib, *13; A. F. Coyle, '15, and A.
L. Johnson, 'Hi; California was repre»
sented by E. K. Sturgis, \Y. 0. Mar
vin, and A. W. Drury.
A. F. Coyle, '15, the first speaker for
Stanford, pointed out. that the true
question regarding the admittance of
these races was not whether they
might be assimilated but what the re
sult of that assimilation would be. He
also showed the importance to Califor
nia of deciding this question now be
fore the beginning of a large immigra
tion to this country. That these people
are morally, politically and socially in
ferior and that the affirmative offered
a thoroughly practical plan for their
exclusion he proved conclusively.
Sturgis advanced the claims of the
literacy test and other forms of selec
tion as opposed lo prohibition by racial
discrimination, and in this connection
pointed out the difficulty of determin
ing race and also unskilled laborers.
Stanford's second speaker, A. L.
Johnson, '16, enlarged upon the cheap
and vile living conditions of the South
ern Europeans and showed how this
would tend to lower wages. He stated
that "An overstocked labor supply has
led to a condition of wages being divid
ed in half by men who worked only 160
days in the year, there being no work
all the time for everybody."
Marvin in the second speech for the
negative sought to show that these
people were a positive benefit to the
country in its industrial and agricul
tural development.
The argument of the third affirma
tive speaker, K. E. Leib, squarely de
nied that the Italians would aid any
in advancing intensive farming, al
though they carry it on successfully
at home they are merely skillful imi
tators and are not. qualified to intro
duce it into a country where it has
not been carried on to any extent. He
then showed that people of South
eastern Europe are unable to appre
ciate democratic institutions, citing the
case of Argentina with her large im
migration from these countries.
Professor A. M. Cathcart of the
Stanford Law Department presided
over the debate.
