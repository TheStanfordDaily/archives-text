# ROBERT MANTELL AT THE CORT THEATRE
## Great Interpreter of Classic Has a Comprehensive Arrangement of the Bard's Plays. 
### 
Robert Mantell, the recognized
leader of the American stage in the
interpretation of the great roles of
Shakespeare and the classics, conies
to the Cort Theater for a two weeks'
engagement beginning .Monday, .No
vember 24th.
Mr. Mantel 1 is the only American
actor now living who can be regarded
as the legitimate successor of the long
line of tragedians that included For
rest, Kean, McCullough, the Booths and
Mansfield. lie is the only actor fitted
by voice and physique and long, hard
training in tlie classics for such great
roles as King Lear and Othello, and is
the only one who has dared recreate
these personages and include them in
a permanent repertoire.
His success in the interpretation of
the big classic roles led William Win
ter in 1907 to proclaim Mantell leader
of the American stage, and since then
many other critics of note have echoed
this opinion. Mantell's speeches in
".Macbeth" are regarded by Winter as
the best readings of Shakespearean
linos since the days of Edwin Booth.
Professor H. H. Hay of Girard Col
lege, Philadelphia, recently went a
step further even than Mr. Winter and
declared Mantell the superior of Booth
in natural qualifications for Shakes
pearean tragedies and quite his equal
in most points of art. Professor Hay,
who is a Shakespearean scholar of
note and whose memory of acting ex
tends back to the days of Forrest and
the Uootlis, unhesitatingly pronounced
Mantell the greatest King Lear in the
history of the stage, not only of Amer
ica, but of the world.
I'or each of Mantell's productions
his manager, William A. Brady, has
provided stage settings in keeping with
the dignity of the acting of the fore
most Shakespearean star, and Man
toil's company, which has steadily im
proved year after year, is now con
sidered one of the greatest organiza
tions that ever interpreted Shakes
peare to America.
