# ENGINEERS' ASSEMBLY ADDRESSED BY BRILL
## LEADING PROFESSIONAL MAN TALKS TO STUDENTS Stanford's System of Engineering Education Commended in Combined Meeting Friday. 
### 
The second Engineer's Assembly of
the year was addressed by George M.
Hrill, prominent consulting engineer
of Chicago. The lecture was given in
the Geology lecture room before the
students of the combined engineering
departments. C. P. Campbell, '12, in
troduced Brill, who spoke on
"The Engineering of Manufacturing
Plants."
In beginning he stated, "I am very
favorably impressed by the system
here of the first two year's work being
the same for all the different branches
of engineering, so that an electrical
engineer will have some training in
mechanical engineering, or a civil
engineer in mechanical work. While
the engineering required in the build
ing of a manufacturing plant is prin
cipally that of a mechanical engineer,
it also calls for a civil and electrical
engineering knowledge. I have known
mediocre mechanical engineers, who
with a little training in civil engineer
ing could have made marked successes
in that line, and so with civil engineers
whose ability lay in mechanics, if
their engineering training had only
been broad enough to allow them to
change.
The speaker then read from a treat
ise of his writing formerly prepared
for an engineering magazine. This
he summarized as follows: "In con
clusion it may be said that in all cases
compromises in 1 lie arrangements and
design of the buildings for a site
should be avoided as much as possible.
The designer to thoroughly fulfil his
obligations must keep in mind all the
conditions imposed by the manufac
ing operations; recognize all build
ing ordinances which may pertain to
the undertaking; observe all reason
able requirements imposed by under
writing companies; give consideration
to simplicity, and with keen percep
tion bring together all these elements
which contribute to the success and in
tegrity of the enterprise. By follow
ing these methods he should make
every plant fully meet the require
ments, and therefore result in the high
est efficiency of production."
A blue print of the B. F. Avery and
Son's plant, an agricultural imple
ments concern of Louisville, Kentucky,
which was recently designed by Brill,
thtf speaKer illustrated the actual prac
tis-s of (lie general principles laid
down in the treatise.
