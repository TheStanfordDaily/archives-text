# VARSITY BLANKS SOUTHERNERS IN RUGBY
## Ten to Nothing Score History of Watch On Bovard Field; Opponents On Defence. 
### 
Using the lineup that outplayed Cali
fornia two weeks ago, the Stanford
Varsity blanked the University of
Southern California with ten points on
Hovard Field Saturday, in a match
that kept the southerners on defence.,
Though the resistance of the oppon
ents 011 their home field was stubborn,
they seldom crossed the center line
into Stanford territory. Close playing
in the pinches, when the ball was
rushed at the U. S. C. goal line time
after time, held the Cardinal ruggers
to two tries.
Good ground surface made for fast
play on the dirt field. The smallness
of the playing space, and the fact that
it is banked at the ends by the sur
rounding cinder path proved a dis
advantage to the Stanford fifteen.
Considerable time was lost when kicks
to touch repeatedly sent the ball over
the side fences.
A good attendance of Stanford peo
ple from Southern California tempered
the cheering of the opposing rooters
with a spirit of support.
The strong work of the Cardinal rug
gers from the start was an indica
tion that the edge of the active rugby
season has not been worn off since
training was broken. Stanford was on
the offensive during most of both per
iods of the game, and repeated rushes
hammered the Southern California
danger limit.
Gard registered the first try for
Stanford by breaking the opposing
defence with a rush and crossing the
goal line unresisted. The chance to
score was the result of a free kick
made by Austin from the forty-yard
line, which was misjudged by Numan,
Southern California wing, on the fif
teen-yard mark. Numan's error al
lowed Gard to secure the ball with a
clear field ahead. Austin chalked up
an additional two points by I.b easy
conversion.
In the second half, Carroll tallied
the second and last try of the game for
Stanford. He took the ball in a pass
ing rush at the thirty-yard line, and
outwitted the opposing defence in a
dodging run that allowed him to down
the ball over the line. Austin again
negotiated the cross bar, and set the
final score at 10-0.
Only once was the Stanford goal in
great danger. Teschke, a U. S. C.
scrum man took the ball at a twenty
five-yard lineout, and progressed as '
far as the five-yard line, when he was
downed by Helmus Andrews, who cov
ered the emergency line.
The Stanford squad follows:
Hall, Wines, Peck, Braden, Clover,
Watkins, Gard, Darsie, Blase, Ogden,
forwards; Erb, Tilton, half; Austin,
Davidson, Lachmund, five-eighths;
Carroll, center; Captain Thoburn,
Reeves, Urban, wings; Andrews, full.

teen-yard mark. Numan's error al
lowed Gard to secure the ball with a
clear field ahead. Austin chalked up
an additional two points by I.b easy
conversion.
In the second half, Carroll tallied
the second and last try of the game for
Stanford. He took the ball in a pass
ing rush at the thirty-yard line, and
outwitted the opposing defence in a
dodging run that allowed him to down
the ball over the line. Austin again
negotiated the cross bar, and set the
final score at 10-0.
Only once was the Stanford goal in
great danger. Teschke, a U. S. C.
scrum man took the ball at a twenty
five-yard lineout, and progressed as '
far as the five-yard line, when he was
downed by Helmus Andrews, who cov
ered the emergency line.
The Stanford squad follows:
Hall, Wines, Peck, Braden, Clover,
Watkins, Gard, Darsie, Blase, Ogden,
forwards; Erb, Tilton, half; Austin,
Davidson, Lachmund, five-eighths;
Carroll, center; Captain Thoburn,
Reeves, Urban, wings; Andrews, full.
Using the lineup that outplayed Cali
fornia two weeks ago, the Stanford
Varsity blanked the University of
Southern California with ten points on
Hovard Field Saturday, in a match
that kept the southerners on defence.,
Though the resistance of the oppon
ents 011 their home field was stubborn,
they seldom crossed the center line
into Stanford territory. Close playing
in the pinches, when the ball was
rushed at the U. S. C. goal line time
after time, held the Cardinal ruggers
to two tries.
Good ground surface made for fast
play on the dirt field. The smallness
of the playing space, and the fact that
it is banked at the ends by the sur
rounding cinder path proved a dis
advantage to the Stanford fifteen.
Considerable time was lost when kicks
to touch repeatedly sent the ball over
the side fences.
A good attendance of Stanford peo
ple from Southern California tempered
the cheering of the opposing rooters
with a spirit of support.
The strong work of the Cardinal rug
gers from the start was an indica
tion that the edge of the active rugby
season has not been worn off since
training was broken. Stanford was on
the offensive during most of both per
iods of the game, and repeated rushes
hammered the Southern California
danger limit.
Gard registered the first try for
Stanford by breaking the opposing
defence with a rush and crossing the
goal line unresisted. The chance to
score was the result of a free kick
made by Austin from the forty-yard
line, which was misjudged by Numan,
Southern California wing, on the fif
teen-yard mark. Numan's error al
lowed Gard to secure the ball with a
clear field ahead. Austin chalked up
an additional two points by I.b easy
conversion.
