To the Chronicler of the college year
the effort put forth by the trio of

speakers on Saturday
evening in the twenty
third annual intercol-

lcgiate debate with California may
mean but a mark in the column of vic
tories for Stanford. 13ut to the men
who labored through the long period
of preparation the unanimous decision
of the judges means much more. Few
activities require more earnest en
deavor and sacrifice than does the
neglected forensic art. This year an
added impetus has been given to de
bating by the attention given by the
public speaking courses and the grant
ing of credit to the men who devote
their entire time to this branch of
work. Improvement has been the aim
of the debating instructors. That this
has been accomplished is attested to by
the result of the debate on Saturday.
Stanford may look forward to more
success in this activity in the future.
