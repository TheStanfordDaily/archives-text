As a fitting finale to a season of
success on the Rugby turf, the 1913

football season has
been brought to a
culmination by a vic
tory over the best

team in Southern California. Stan
ford's varsity fifteen thus becomes the
Rugby champion of the state. Thrice
the Cardinal was victorious over the
Barbarian clubmen. The series with
the Winged 0 was taken by Stanford.
Then the University of California club
was defeated. In the intercollegiate
match with California a 13 to 8 score,
was sufficient evidence of the super
iority of the Stanford team. The north
now defeats the south. Seven Card
inal varsity players gained a place on
the All-Star Fifteen in the interna
tional game with the New Zealanders.
Small wonder that Stanford is proud
of the team, its leaders, coaches and
trainer.
