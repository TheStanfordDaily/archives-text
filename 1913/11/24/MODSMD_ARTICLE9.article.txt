# THANKSGIVING SPIRIT IS SUBJECT OF SERMON
## TIMELY THEME IS CHOSEN BY CHAPLAIN GARDNER Thankfulness is Religion of the Healthy-Minded and Ultimate Happiness is Spiritual. 
### 
"The Spirit of Thanksgiving" was
the theme of a most attractive thanks
giving sermon by Chaplain IJ. Charles
Gardner yesterday morning in Mem
orial church.
"Thanksgiving is the very essence ol'
religion, but it is often choked by the
modern tendency to measure our
thankfulness by our possessions. The
happiest people in the world are the
uneducated," said Rev. Gardner, and
then ho proceeded to show that the
educated man and woman, by virtue of
his fuller, richer life should be even
more thankful, for education points
out the relative values of things and
the mystery of nature.
"Thankfulness is the religion of the
healthy-minded. Beware of the pessi
mistical philosophy of Omar Khayyam
whose doctrine is self-indulgence, for
that which brings ultimate happiness
is spiritual. Salvation means moral
and spiritual good health.
"We should not only give thanks for
our creation, preservation, and all
the blessings of this life, but the
Christian spirit of thanksgiving rises
to nobler heightsâ€”the inestimable love
in the redemption of the world by our
Lord .Tesus Christ, the means of
grace, and the hope of glory."
Reverend "Wilbur T. Gresham will
talk to the members of the Young
Women's Christian Association, tomor
row afternoon, in the vestry of the
Memorial church, on the Episcopal
Cathedral of San Francisco. Rev. Wil
bur 1. Gresham is rlean of the Episco
pal Seminary of San Francisco, and
author of several books.
