The work of the San Francisco
Auxiliary represents a much needed
undertaking and is as yet but in its
inception. The Stanford Medical De
partment has sixty-four physicians
with a large corps of nurses and in
ternes who devote their time to at
tending the needy sick. An average
of 230 persons a day are treated.
Funds, however, do not permit the
proper care of convalescent hospital
patients after they are discharged.
To provide such care was the imme
diate purpose for the organization of
the auxiliary.
To co-operate with this organiza
tion in the raising of funds and in
personal social service work the Cam
pus Auxiliary to the Stanford Clinics
was recently organized. The officers
of this association are Miss Ileen
Everett, '14, president; W. H. Bloeser,
'14, vice-president; A. S. Flack, 'l.">,
treasurer, and Miss Alice Briggs, '14,
secretary.
