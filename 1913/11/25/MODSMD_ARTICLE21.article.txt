# RIVAL ROOTING SECTIONS TO CHEER ALL-STAR TEAMS
## Partisans of Northern and Southern Players Will Back Favorites From Bleechers. 
### 
It will be North versus South
in the bleachers at Stanford Field 011
Thanksgiving Day, as well as 011 the
turf. The large part of the Stanford
community that claim the southland
as home will rally to the support of
their preparatory school stars and
from the north side of the field will
attempt to drown the cheers of the
northern partisans in the regular
rooting section.
Competition as strenuous and
rivalry as keen as that 011 the rugby
turf will undoubtedly result from the
division of the football fans, and the
bleachers will claim part of the
crowd's attention for the last time this
season.
Assistant Yell Leaders Kuhl and
Nixon will be in charge of the South
ern section, on the far side of the
field, while Yell Leader Cass will
direct the Northern sympathizers. As
the rooters for the South have 110
familiar or suitable yells, an urgent
appeal lias been made to all interested
to give tlie respective leaders sugges
tions. Yells should be given to the
leaders before Thursday morning.
Rooting sections will depend to a
great extent upon the suggestions
that come to the men in charge.
