# SAYS RUGBY UNION FACES A CRISIS
## 
### 
The life or death of the California
Rugby Union rests on the acceptance
or rejection of the Union as a final
court of appeals by the two great uni
versities of the state, according to the
judgement of L. S. Reading, vice
president of the Rugby Union and
chairman of the board of referees. In
its present status, as a rule making
body not having power to enforce its
decisions. Reading considers the ef
forts of the Union to govern rugby
football in California abscurd. At
present the two universities have a
rugby agreement that is absolutely in
dependent. and in some ways at cross
purposes with the provisions of the
organization. Since the influence of
the universities in rugby at present
overshadows that of the elubs, the
Union can not be a successful law

maker and administrator unless it re
ceives the undivided support of the
universities.
Reading said in an interview this
afteronon:
"In my opinion the life of the Cali
fornia Rugby Union depends to a
large extent on the immediate action
of the two principal universities of the
state. The intercollegiate rules an<J
the Union rules do not harmonize. In
order to insure the life and value of
the Rugby Union, is must he recog
nized as a controlling power in foot
ball, and the universities must recog
nize the power of the Union to abso
lutely regulate all contests.
"The clubs that are at present play
ing rugby are not strong enough to
direct the Union in the face of oppo
sition. For that reason 1 am sure that
the refusal of the universities to throw
themselves behind the Union heart
and soul will cause its temporary
death. In time, the clubs will gain
power, and will then be able to con
trol the situation. The universities
will find themselves unable to cope
with the problems that arise if they do
not support the efforts of the Union
to control all rugby activities."
In making examples of cases in
which the intercollegiate agreement,
conflicts with the efforts of the Union,
Reading said:
"The Union is at present more or
less of a figure head. If a player is
ordered off the field for rough play, the
Union has no power to suspend him
from playing until lie has learned bet
ter. He may appear on the field the
next day. In other countries I have
known a player to be barred from the
field for life, by order of the Rugby
Union, the crime richly meriting the
penalty.
"In the recent discussion between
Stanford and California concerning
the use of four substitutes on one of
the teams, the Union was naturally
not consulted, it having been express
ly stipulated in the formation of the
rules of the Rugby Union that the
"Rig Game" should be excluded. T.9
take another point, the intercollegiate
rules allow a try if the player extends
the ball across their goal line, whereas
the rules expressly stipulated that "a
try is gained by the player who first

puts his hand on the ball on the
ground" in his opponents in goal.
"It is ridiculous to conceive of con
llicting rules of rugby in the state. It
is up to the universities to recognize
the Union as the paramount
power or otherwise establish some
other body whose power they must
recognize to regulate rugby. How
can it regulate rugby? Ry having
the granted power to do so. Why
hasn't it that power? Hecause the
universities have not granted it. The
present position of the "Big
Game" as the all-important rugby
event of the year is primarily respons
ible for the trouble, and secondly the
existence of paid coaches. The honor
of playing for one's country is surely
greater than that of playing for one's
university and should be recognized
so. A position on the All-Star team
should be more coveted than one 011
the college team. Yet, the New Xea
landers, after making a journey of six
thousand miles were met with second
teams because the coaches feared that
a man might be hurt on the eve of the
"Rig Game."
"The Union must, be accepted as a
court of final appeal for deciding all
questions concerning rugby in Cali
fornia. It should be composed of rep
resentatives from the universities,
clubs, and high schools. The interest
of rugby enthusiasts should lie a com
mon interest devoted to the welfai*?
and the cl.ean playxig of the game,
and a strict adherence to the observ
ance of those rules now recognized by
every other country playing rugby
football.
