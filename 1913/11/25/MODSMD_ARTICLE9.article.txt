Banding together to render service
by aiding the dependent sick in re
gaining health and self reliance after
the work of the doctor leaves off, a
group of Stanford graduates and
friends of the university are doing a
real work in San Francisco. Their
undertaking is a difficult one taxed by
demands of a complex, heavy and
varied nature. They have come face
to face with the problem of caring foi:
the indigent sick whose failing in
comes make them dependent upon
public charity or 0:1 the doctors who
give their services so freely in the
clinics and hospitals. They realize

the big ness of their work.
Those who live precar
ious lives as do the major
ity of the city's poor fre
quently find themselves in

the state ot' helplessness because of
illness. Humanity demands that they
be cared for. But how? It is this
problem that is interwoven through
the task which the Auxiliary to the
Stanford Clinics" has taken for its
work. As a beginning of a life of
usefullness and service to human suf
ferers the members of the Auxiliary
have provided funds to employ an ex
perienced social service worker. It
will be the business of the worker to
solve the difficulties which harass the
homeless, foodless and jobless poor
"up against it" through force of cir
cumstances. In their new work the
men and women who are interested in
the endeavor are expressing more
fully the broader functions of the
university toward the public.
