# RIVAL ROOTING SECTIONS WILL HAVE NEW "STUNTS"
## 
### 
Yell Leader Don Cass has received
an avalanche of suggestions in the
form of original "stunts" and yells to
lie featured by the rooting sections in
the Thanksgiving game. The South
ern rooters intend to utilize the
bleachers on the sunny side of the
field by forming a huge outlined "S"
to typify their partisanship. The
Northerners have not yet decided upon
their plans, but they will probably
select some of the clever ideas already
submitted.
An impromptu band will furnish the
special music for the afternoon.
Don Cass, '14, will lead the South
ern rooters, while C. F. Kuhl, '15 and
C. H. Nixon, '15, will have charge of
the Northern enthusiasts.
