# ECHO HARP AND CHIMES TO BE INSTALLED IN CHURCH
## New Features Will be Used in Conjunction With the Regular Organ. 
### 
Active work has been commenced
on the transference of the organ
from the chapel to the Memorial
Church. The body of the organ will
lie in the church by January !). The
echo organ and chimes will be in
stalled by May. A concert harp is
to form part of the echo organ. This
will be installed in the southwest
well, directly above the entrance from
the vestry and between the chancel
and the west gallery. The cathedral
chimes will not be in the form of a
peal of bells, but as an adjunct to
the organ. The action of the organ is
to be quickened by a decrease in the
exhaust of the outlet valves.
