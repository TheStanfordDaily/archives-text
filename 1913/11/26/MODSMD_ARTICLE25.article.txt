# CIVIL ENGINEERS PLAN TWO INTERESTING TRIPS
## Papers Read by Adams and Glass on Irrigation System and Road Work. 
### 
A trip to San Mateo dam, one of
the largest masonry dams in the
world, and to the San Andreas and
Pillarreitos dam, is planned for the
first Sunday after the Thanksgiving
vacation by the Civil Engineering
society. These huge structures are a
part of the Spring Valley water sys
tem which supplies the city of San
Francisco, and are easily reached
from the town of San Mateo. An
other important trip of like nature
is that to the Calaveras dam, now in
process of construction. This expe
dition is scheduled for the early part
of next semester.
These trips were decided upon at
last evening's meeting of the society.
Other features of the meeting were
the papers read by R. G. Adams, '14,
and W. W. Class, '14.
The paper of Glass concerned the
subject of mountain roads work in
the southern part of the state. De
tails of the work and cost data were
given.
