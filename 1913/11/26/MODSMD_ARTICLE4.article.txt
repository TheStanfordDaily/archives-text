The rugby teams that are to represent the football skill of Northern and
Southern California are awaiting the referee's whistle that will open the first
interscholastic match tomorrow at three o'clock.
Since their arrival yesterday, the high school stars have had two practice
periods, the first yesterday afternoon, and the second at four o'clock. Wines,
Carroll, Darsie, and Thoburn have assisted C. S. Morris, OS, in coaching the
Northerners, while Andrews, Reeves, Clover, Hall, Card and Schaupp have
< one the same service for the Southern squad. At the practice this afternoon,
captains will be elected by both teams, and uniforms, bearing their different
insignia will be distributed.
Two vacancies left in the Southern line by the failure of Creswell and
Nisbit, of Pomona, to come have been filled. Hess, of the Low Angeles Manual
Arts high school will replace Nisbit in the scrum, and Fishburne of Los
Angeles high school will take Creswell's position at wing. The two substi
tute players reached the campus this morning and are staying at the Zeta
Psi house and Cardinal Club respectively.
Advance interest in the contest of tomorrow has been wide spread and
the outcome of the match is a subject of keen discussion. Both teams are
composed of brilliant players, and will likely play to a close finish. The
added speed of the turf should be manifest in a great degree. In weight the
two teams balance each other, their weight being 163 pounds.
Details of management connected with the contest have been carefully
planned. W. P. Fuller, '10, who will referee is an experienced man, and
should give satisfaction. The touch judges, F. C. Brown, '11, and .T. O. Miller,
'08, are well qualified to handle the flags.

Angeles high school will take Creswell's position at wing. The two substi
tute players reached the campus this morning and are staying at the Zeta
Psi house and Cardinal Club respectively.
Advance interest in the contest of tomorrow has been wide spread and
the outcome of the match is a subject of keen discussion. Both teams are
composed of brilliant players, and will likely play to a close finish. The
added speed of the turf should be manifest in a great degree. In weight the
two teams balance each other, their weight being 163 pounds.
Details of management connected with the contest have been carefully
planned. W. P. Fuller, '10, who will referee is an experienced man, and
should give satisfaction. The touch judges, F. C. Brown, '11, and .T. O. Miller,
'08, are well qualified to handle the flags.
