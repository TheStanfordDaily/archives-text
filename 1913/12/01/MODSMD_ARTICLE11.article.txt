# But a Beginning

### 
Acting upon a proposal made by the
class of IS9(>, an impetus to the move
ment for a general reunion of the
men and women of Stanford Universi
ty in 1915 —the Exposition Year —has
been given by the active campaign
underway in the Southland through
the efforts of the Stanford Club of Los
Angeles. The greatest gathering of
former Stanford students ever held is
planned for the month of May, 1915.
It has been said that the hope of the
university lies in its alumni. Stanford
must still be classified as a young uni-

versity. Her sons and
daughters have just begun
to make their presence felt
among the forces beyond the
pale of university life. To

the alumni must the University look
for its future greatness. Stanford's
graduates are members of a growing
body. As the years roll by a deeper
significance will be attached to the
privilege of calling ones self aij
alumna or an alumnus of Stanford.
The spirit of loyalty to the University
will like old wine become mellowed
by time and trial, and this feeling of
reverence will in turn bring benefit to
the University. This first general re
union is but a beginning of the move
ment in which the alumni will play
their part in making Stanford what its
founders intended it to be "a univer
sity of high degree."
