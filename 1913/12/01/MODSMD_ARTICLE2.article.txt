Wide concrete walks are being built
to circle Memorial Church. It has
been found necessary to lay out thesa
walks owing to the fact that on rainy
days, the clay of the courts has been
tracked into the church, thus injuring
the cork floors. It will not long be
necessary for attendants to plough
through the mud in going from the
church proper to the vestry, as the
new walks will prevent the former in
convenience.
Two other walks are being con
structed. One is to lead from the
Engineering buildings to the Mathe
matics building and the other from the
Art building to the Mathematics build
ing.
