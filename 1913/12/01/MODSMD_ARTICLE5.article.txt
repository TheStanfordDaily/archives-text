# INTERSCHOLASTIC RUGBY FURNISHES HARD CONTEST
## NORTHERN STARS NOSE AHEAD BY THREE POINTS. Outcome of Match is a Problem Until Final Gun; South Struggles Bravely. 
### 
All Northern California outscored
the pick of rugby stars from south
of the Tehachapi last Thursday, by
virtue of a field goal in the second
half that placed the final result at
3-0. The two teams battled through
a close match, and until the second
half, the result threatened to be a tie.
Equal weight, and top notch play
ing of both fifteens kept both from
crossing the goal lines, and attested
the wisdom of the selection judges.
In the early part of the game, the su
perior scrum work of Southern Cali
fornia offset the efforts of their op
ponents. The Northern backs finally
got a chance to show their form and
displayed a number of pretty passing
rushes. Brooks and Oilman failed
to convert two penalty goals for
Southern California, and allowed the
final gun to declare a victory for the
Northern boys.
The field was in rather poor shape
on account of recent rains, and
chccked pretty open play that was
started many times. On a dry field
the interscholastic stars would have
staged a more spectacular contest.
Skull and Snakes society, which
managed the game, was fortunate in
matching two such equal teams in the
first annual contest. The new ven
ture was distinctly a success, and
brought the star players of high
school rugby together for the first
time in actual struggle.
First Mall'—Going down on Iteimer'3
kickoff for the North, his teammates
forced the Southern boys into close
territory. A dribbling rush swept the
ball across center into Northern
ground, but play was returned into
Southern territory by a passing rush
between Card and Wallace of Palo
Alto.
Captain Brooks of Los Angeles failed
to place a penalty kick from the
twenty-five yard line, where it was
carried by the Southern backs. The
work of the half showed little choice
between the two teams. Both showed
good combination in spite of short
practice together. Though the South
ern forwards had shown superior
strength, the Northern backs prom
iser to star on opportunity.
Second period—Soon after the be
ginning of the second period, M.
Forbes of Boone's placed a penalty
kick from the thirty-yard line, netting
the only score of the game.
Walker, of Lick, passed to Stafford,
of Trinity, on the Southern ten-yard
mark, who ran twenty yards before
passing to M. Forbes. Forbes shot the
ball to Waite, of Stockton, on the right
wing, who kicked. The return was
marked, and Forbes made the scoring
boot.
The Southern players came back
strong, and held the ball consistently
near their opponent's goal. Their last
chance at a score failed when Gilman
of Manual Arts sent a penalty kick
wide of the bars.
Final time ended the struggle, with
the play in northern ground.
