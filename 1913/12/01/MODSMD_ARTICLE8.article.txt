# THANKSGIVING SOCCER RESULTS IN TIE GAME
## BLUE AND GOLD EVENS SCORE IN LAST MINUTES. Higgins is Responsible for Stanford Score. Third Game to be Here on Washington's Birthday. 
### 
Tying the score in the last few min
utes of play Thorpe of California
saved the Blue and Gold from a sec
ond defeat at the hands of the Cardinal
soccerites on Thanksgiving day. Cap
tain Higgins scored a single tally in
the first half, which seemed to be a
safe lead until the opening late in the
game allowed a 1 to 1 score.
Stanford's score was made in the
middle of the first half when Stein
hart took a shot at goal from mid
field. Davidson trying to clear it was
i blocked by Higgins who then had a
i .straight kick to net. In the same half
Pellas endangered the Blue and Gold
net when he got away with a dribbling
1 rush and sent a straight kick at the
goal, which shot high and cleared the
' net.
During the first half the play was
very even, the ball going from one
j end of the field to the other. The ex
cellent work of Butcher before the
Cardinal goal averted several near
trys by the California forwards.
Neither side seemed to have an ad
vantage in the second period. A sec
ond score was prevented by the slip
pery condition of the field which
caused Higgins to fall with the ball
directly in front of a clear goal. It
was not till late in the period that
Thorpe of California took a shot at
goal which found an opening through
the Cardinal backs, and evened the
score.
The third game of the series for the
intercollegiate soccer championship
will he played at Stanford on Wash
ington's birthday. The standing of
the games is the same as last year,
with the first game a Stanford vic
tory, while both the Thanksgiving
games resulted in tie scores.
The Williamson Trophy Cup will be
i come the permanent possession of
Stanford by another soccer victory.
I Under the conditions imposed by the
donor, the cup was to be held from
year to year by the winner of the an
nual series, and to go permanently to
the leading university at the end of
ten games. Six intercollegiate
matches have been held, resulting in
four Stanford victories and two tie
J games. Another win would insure
j Stanford the trophy permanently.
