# BREAK GROUND FOR UNION TOMORROW WORK OF YEARS TO BECOME A REALITY
## 
### 
Actual construction work on the
Stanford Union and the Women's Club
House will begin tomorrow morning.
A force of men and teams will disturb
the morning stillness when they start
breaking ground for the Stanford
buildings so long proposed.
The Union is to be located near the
site of the shoe shop. It will lie 100
feet west of Lasuen street and
about <ii) feet south of the car tracks.
Ground near the postoffice will be
broken for the Women's Clubhouse.
It will be the same distance from
Lasuen as the Union, and will extend
back to the garages.
Monson Brothers, of San Francisco,
are contracting engineers in charge of
the work. Charles Haggans, an en
gineer in their employ, will have
actual charge of the construction.
John O. Miller, 'OS, will be superin
tendent.
The buildings will be laid out on
the lines of the general plan that will
some day be executed. When the final
work now proposed is completed, the
Union and the Clubhouse will be con
nected by a covered arcade, which will
extend along Lasuen street. An as
sembly hall will be built in the rear
of the Union and Clubhouse site and
will be connected by other arcades.
The arcades will form another Quad,

which will be of the same size as the
Memorial Court. This will bring the
Assembly Hall on the line of the pres
ent site of the forge shops.
No trees will be cut at the present
time, the buildings having been so lo
cated as to avoid the removal of any
buildings or trees on the site.
The contract price of the Union is
$32,370, while the Women's Clubhouse
will cost $16,400. The men's building
is to be about 65 by AG feet in size.
The other building is 55 by 95.
The lack of funds at this time pre
vents any work on the proposed
smaller Quad. The architecture of
this edifice will be similar to that
of the Memorial Court. It is planned
to have the interior of the Quad turfed
with lawns and dotted with trees and
shrubbery. The space between the
buildings and the Lasuen street side
walk will also be beautified by greens.
Work will proceed simultaneously
on the buildings. Haggans was on the
campus yesterday making the final ar
rangements for the beginning of con
struction. The force of men and teams
will be increased as the job proceeds.
The architecture of the new build
ings will be of Mosaic type and is
similar to the present Quad. It is
planned to have the buildings com
pleted by April, 1914.

The Union is to be located near the
site of the shoe shop. It will lie 100
feet west of Lasuen street and
about <ii) feet south of the car tracks.
Ground near the postoffice will be
broken for the Women's Clubhouse.
It will be the same distance from
Lasuen as the Union, and will extend
back to the garages.
Monson Brothers, of San Francisco,
are contracting engineers in charge of
the work. Charles Haggans, an en
gineer in their employ, will have
actual charge of the construction.
John O. Miller, 'OS, will be superin
tendent.
The buildings will be laid out on
the lines of the general plan that will
some day be executed. When the final
work now proposed is completed, the
Union and the Clubhouse will be con
nected by a covered arcade, which will
extend along Lasuen street. An as
sembly hall will be built in the rear
of the Union and Clubhouse site and
will be connected by other arcades.
The arcades will form another Quad,

which will be of the same size as the
Memorial Court. This will bring the
Assembly Hall on the line of the pres
ent site of the forge shops.
No trees will be cut at the present
time, the buildings having been so lo
cated as to avoid the removal of any
buildings or trees on the site.
The contract price of the Union is
$32,370, while the Women's Clubhouse
will cost $16,400. The men's building
is to be about 65 by AG feet in size.
The other building is 55 by 95.
The lack of funds at this time pre
vents any work on the proposed
smaller Quad. The architecture of
this edifice will be similar to that
of the Memorial Court. It is planned
to have the interior of the Quad turfed
with lawns and dotted with trees and
shrubbery. The space between the
buildings and the Lasuen street side
walk will also be beautified by greens.
Work will proceed simultaneously
on the buildings. Haggans was on the
campus yesterday making the final ar
rangements for the beginning of con
struction. The force of men and teams
will be increased as the job proceeds.
The architecture of the new build
ings will be of Mosaic type and is
similar to the present Quad. It is
planned to have the buildings com
pleted by April, 1914.
Actual construction work on the
Stanford Union and the Women's Club
House will begin tomorrow morning.
A force of men and teams will disturb
the morning stillness when they start
breaking ground for the Stanford
buildings so long proposed.
