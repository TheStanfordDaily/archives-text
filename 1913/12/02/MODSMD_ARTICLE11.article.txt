# A 						Reality
## 
### 
After five years of endeavor the
Stanford Union and Women's Club
house project is to become a reality.
Work will be begun tomorrow morning

when the grading -for the
buildings commences. The ac
tion of the building commit
tee in authorizing the imme-

diate construction of the structures
means that the officers of the Union
place their reliance on the subscribers
who have already pledged their sup
port for the money to meet the bills as
they come due. New pledges and
subscriptions will be sought for
among the undergraduates of the uni
versity.
