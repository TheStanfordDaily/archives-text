# OFFICIAL SAYS NEEDED MONEY FOR THE WORK WILL BE FORTHCOMING

### 
E. W. Smith, '99, the permanent sec
retary of the Stanford Union, makes
the following statement concerning
the beginning of construction work
on the Union:
"The officers of the Union have ae
ceeded to the assurances given them
011 every side that, once the building
was begun, the money would come in
promptly. To finish the building ac
cording to present plans, will require
roughly $.".,000 more than is in the
treasury now. Sines the building will
be finished in about five months, that
means that we must collect $1,000 a
month, if we are going to escape pay
ing interest on borrowed money. Such
interest would necessarily raise the
running expenses of the Union.
"There are a number of students
who have made pledges to the Union
and a number of others who intend
to contribute but have, so far, not
paid anything. The officers of the
Union count on the support of all
these men to help make it possible
for us to occupy the Union building,
free of debt, on Commencement Day."
