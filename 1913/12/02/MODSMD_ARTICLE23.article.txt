# ENGLISH CLUB TO SELL IRWIN-FIELD STORIES
## 
### 
The English Club will offer on sale
its edition of the popular "Stanford
Stories" of Will Irwin and Charlie
Field, 011 Thursday and Friday of this
week.
The volume is bound in Cardinal
cloth and bears on its cover a new
four-color reproduction of the East
Arch of the Inner Quad. The frontis
piece is a beautiful four-color half
tone in the same process, which is a
new one being introduced and used
by the Sunset Press. The whole ap
pearance and quality of the book have
been improved, and two stories and
several illustrations have been added.
The tales in this volume are perhaps
the most popular which have appeared
of life 011 the Stanford "Farm."
The books will be sold from one
thirty to four-thirty on both Thurs
day and Friday. Many students have
subscribed for copies, and these are
requested to call for their books as
they will be held responsible for the
number for which they applied.
Hooks may be had upon payment of
the sale price, $1.25.
It was not the intention of the Eng
lish Club to offer any copies for gen
eral sale at this time, but because of
the expense incurred in getting out
the edition, the price will be raised
to $1.50 after the sale, and all per
sons who wish to buy it this week will
therefore be given a chance to get it
at the original price of $1.25. The
general purchasers as well as the sub
scribers may secure copies between
the hours of one-thirty and four
thirty, Thursday and Friday, at the
Hank of Palo Alto booth in the Book
store.
