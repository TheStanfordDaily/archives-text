Herbert C. Hoover, a member of the
class of 1895 and now one of the Trus
tees of the University, first suggested
the Stanford Union idea. He gave the
first money toward the project and it
is largely through him that the Union
is to take its place as part of Stanford
life. Since the movement to gather
money was instituted the fund has
grown steadily by contributions,
mainly from the alumni. It is now
up to the undergraduates of Stanford
to finance the buildings to their com
pletion.
The actual conception of the Stan
ford Union dates from February 20,
1909, when H. C. Hoover, '93, organ
ized an Association with the following
officers: H. C. Hoover, President; C.

Recording Secretary; R. W. Barrett,
Permanent Secretary; E. D. Adams,
