## 
### 
"If rugby here sinks to a matter of
merely practice games and the big
intercollegiate contest, Stanford will
drop rugby as it did the American
game of football," was tlic startling
statement <Â»112 Professor Frank Antreil
of the Facility Athletics Committee of
Stanford Isist iriirlrt in San Francisco.
At the conclusion of the business
meeting of the California Rugby Union
at the Olympic Club, Dr. Angell was
asked for an explanation concerning
the football situation in California.
The above remark was a part of his
answer. lie also said: "Only a
strong rugby union can continue to
make rugby possible. The clubs
should not be a chopping block for the
university teams. Football contests
should not be merely practice games
leading up to the 'big game* between

the universities. \ think that the
governing body of rugby in this
country should become as strong as
the English boards."
The present ineffective control of
the rugby contests in California was
clearly attributed to weakness of the
Rugby Union. Dr. Angell's statement
came as a surprise to those present
at the meeting, and was offered with
out any mincing of terms. It was ac
cepted without comment last night,
and is now the basis oif discussion in
football circles.
When asked what means he would
suggest for the rugby union to ac
complish the desired results, Dr.
Angell said: "That is the business of
the Union."
Hy pointing to the incompetence of

sary for the erection of the building.
The idea of a union clubhouse had
been much talked of, and with this
definite start the proposition pro
gressed rapidly. Ten thousand dol
lars was pledged immediately by
Hoover and his associates. By the
energy of the organizers the fund was
swelled to $39,000 within the year.
This money was pledged largely by
alumni and the liberal support of the
faculty, and was to be entirely paid
in within two years.
The support of the Student Body
was assured at a meeting held Febru
ary 25, 1910, at which time student
subscriptions totalled $14,900. The
work among the undergraduates and
alumni barf been carried on systemat
ically with the present result that the
fund lacks but $5,000 of the specified
$50,000.
