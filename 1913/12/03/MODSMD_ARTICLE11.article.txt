When the Memorial Church waa
established by the Mother of the Uni
versity with the avowed intention oi
making it a non-denominational house
of worship, the wiser ones among the
theologians shook their heads. Utter
failure was predicted. Time has
proven the fallacy of this belief.
Stanford has been fortun-

ate in matters of sectar
ianism. Unlike the major
ity of the larger Eastern
universities there is no

compulsory chapel service. Neither is
there any church requirement. Cath
olicism Methodist, Unatarianist, Cal
vanist, Athiest or any other kind ot' re
ligious ist is unfettered as to church
dogma on the campus.
On alternate Sabbath days outside
preachers of various faiths have been
invited to the campus. This has kept
the university church free from any
tinge of any particular creed. In fur
therance of the new policy adopted
by the Trustees earlier in the semes
ter in which two eminent divines from
the East will be secured for the sec
ond semester of each year to deliver
a series of lectures, Dr. Francis (ireen
wood Peabody of Cambridge has been
secured to be the first speaker next
semester. The allegation has been
made that the Stanford student body
has become irreligious. The investiga
tors of the cause of the decline in
-church going have not yet found an
adequate explanation of the failure in
attendance at services. This combina
tion of a course of lectures with the
regular preaching in the Memorial
Church will disprove the assertion
that the preacher is invisible six days
out of the week and incomprehensible
on the seventh.
