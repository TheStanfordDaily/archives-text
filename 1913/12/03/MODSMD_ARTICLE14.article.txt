Editor of Daily Palo Alto:
I must confess to being somewhat
surprised at the inferences that have
been drawn from the few remarks I
made at the meeting of the Rugby
Union, Monday evening last. Infer
ences of an "attack on the Union"
and "Accusations of the Union's in
competence."
My own inferences are: first, that I
must have expressed myself very
clumsily; and second, that the sport
ing pages of the papers are probably
"hard up'' for material in the interval
between football and baseball. Cer
tainly it would be a silly thing to
draw up a general indictment of in
competence against an organization of
young men who have organized and
carried successfully through such a
complicated undertaking as the tour
of the New Zealanders.
What 1 urged or thought I urged
was firmer action in the matter of
match games vs. practice games. I
take it that the success of rugby foot
ball is going to depend on the number
and strength of the organizations
playing it. Further, r take it that the
development of such organizations will
depend largely on the fun and recre
ation the players get out of them. If
however, the club and smaller colleges
are to be regarded merely as anvils
for hammering out material for the
big universities, I should hardly con
sider the prospect of local football as
very roseate.
As regards Stanford it is pretty evi
dent that if rugby should decline here
to a matter of a few practice games
played merely for the sake of the
"Big Game" (possible but improb
able) the sport would be dropped off
the edge of the campus "like its prede
cessor, and for similar reasons.
In conclusion I hardly need say that
while realizing the "Big Game" is not
without its drawbacks, I am in favor
of it. But 1 certainly should not favor
it if it were to crowd the clubs and
smaller colleges to the wall. "Live
and let live" is a very good maxim for
sporting organizations.
