# WORTHY AND LEIB ARE ELECTED PRESIDENTS OF DEBATING SOCIETIES
## NESTORIA AND EUPHRONIA WILL BE LED BY TWO EXPERIENCED DEBATERS IN THEIR WORK OF COMING SPRING SMESTER. 
### 
K. E. Leib, '13, and E. T. Worthy, '14,
will serve Euphronia Debating Society
and Nestoria Literary Society, respect-

ively, as presidents
during the coming
semester. Leib is a
I former vice-presi
dent of the society
and one of its
oldest members.
Among his other
j debating honors
j are those of hav
ing been a mem
ber of this year's

intercollegiate trio and of the
1912 Carnot team. Worthy has been a
member of Nestoria for four years.
The other officers elected at the
meeting last evening are: Nestoria,

11. F. Downing, '15,
vice-president; J.
F. Eldon, 'H>, sec
retary; P. J. Mie
bach, '14, treas
urer and O. H.
Castle, '14, ser
geant-at-arms. For
Euphronia, A. F.
Coyla, '15, vice
president; A. J.
Hettinger, '16 sec-

retary-treasurer, and P. IX Nowell, '13,
sergeant-at-arms.
Preceeding the business meetings
the two societies met jointly in Eu
phronia's room and representatives of
the rival societies debated the ques
tion, "Resolved, That in cities of more
than r>,Ooo population, the municipality
should own and operate all moving pic
ture theaters." A. F. Coyle, ' 1 •"», of
Euphronia, led the debate for the af
firmative, and A. E. Worthy, '15, of
Nestoria, the negative. After their
talks there were a number of speeches
from the floor. As the debate was en
tirely extemporaneous no decision was
taken to decide the winner.
Neither of the societies will again
meet this semester, the next meeting
| being scheduled for the second Tues
day of the coming semester. Euphro
nia decided last evening on a new
policy of conducting the debates
which has been tried out and will be
formally inaugurated at their next
meeting. Instead of having two de
j haters on each side of the question to
conduct the debate entirely between
: themselves, one man will be appointed
on each side to lead the argument for
his team and every one present will
he expected to talk on one side of the
question, the discussion being after
the fashion of national assemblies.
Nestoria took definite action last
evening to decrease the number of in
active members on her rolls. By it
any member who has been absent
three meetings will be notified by the
secretary and then if not present at
the next meeting will be automatically
dropped from membership.
