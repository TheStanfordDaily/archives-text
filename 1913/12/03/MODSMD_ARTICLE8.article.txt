# INVITATIONS MAILED FOR NINTH ANNUAL INTERSCMOLASTIC MEET
## Track, Field and Tennis Events Set by Hoard of Governors for April 11, 1914. 
### 
April 11, 1914 is the date announced
by the Hoard of Governors for the
ninth annual Stanford Intel-scholastic
track and field meet. During the
Thanksgiving vacation invitations
were sent to the principals of all the
preparatory schools in California, Ari
zona, Nevada, Utah, Washington, Ore
gon and Idaho, to enter athletes in
Ihe largest interscholastic track meet
ever held on the Pacific Coast.
Active preparations have already
been started to insure the success of
the affair. Over 350 schools have been
invited to take part in a meet which is
primarily the competitors' own meet,
handled by a board of governors for
the students. Several new features
will be added to the annual gathering
next spring.
The annual Interscholastic tennis
tournament will be staged on the day
of the track meet and the preliminary
rounds will be played the day preceed
ing. This was necessitated last year

in the history of the annual gathering.
Trials in the short distances and in
the field events will take place on the
morning of April 11 according to cus

afternoon. As a conclusion to what
promises to be the most successful In
terscholastic meet ever held on the
Coast an informal entertainment will
be given where the preparatory
schools boys will receive their tro
phies and medals.
