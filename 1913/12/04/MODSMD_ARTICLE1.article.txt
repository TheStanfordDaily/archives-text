was recently received from Secretary

match with the University players,
and offering the railroad and hotel
expenses of fourteen men, including
a manager for the trip. The matter
was taken up by a committee com
posed of Trainer 11. W. Maloney, Cap
tain Higgins, and ex-Captain Bellas
who found it feasible for the first team
to make the trip. The final sanction
on the matter was received last even
ing when the executive committee ap
proved the plans for the holidays.

sports of San Diego, there being a
league of local soccer teams who
play regularly scheduled games. The
San Diego papers have already given
prominence to the proposed match be
tween the local club and the northern
university team. The Nomads are the
strongest aggregation among the four
regular soccer clubs of San Diego, and

team has gained much experience in
numerous games with teams from
