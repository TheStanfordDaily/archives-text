# PROFESSOR CAMPBELL GIVES SECOND LECTURE
## ”PHYTO-GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS” IS SUBJECT. Vegetation of Varying Regions Described in Botaaical Discussion This Afternoon. 
### 
Professor D. H. Campbell gave the
second of his series of three lectures
this afternoon. In discussing "The
Great Phyto-Geographical Areas," he
said in part: "The first great division
is the sub-Arctic. All around the
northern hemi-

sphere in both the
old and new
worlds, the vege
tation is very sim
ilar.
Going south, the
next area' is the
north temperate
zone, whose vege
tation, in both the
old and new
worlds, has much

in common. The north temperate
zone merges very rapidly into the
tropical zone, in which the flora in
both worlds is remarkably different.
The divergence here is most marked.
Practically all the palms of the new
world are different from those of the
old. The date is an old world palm,
while the royal is a new world type.
The pine-apple family and the cacti
are found ni ]y in the new world.
In the south hemisphere, there is
practically no vegetation in the great
antarctic territory.
South America, South Africa and
Australia are in the south temperate
zone. '1 hey have a good many points
in common with the north temperate
zone.
The 1 iehos vegetation in the world
is in the wet- regions comprising the
equatorial zone. Guinea and Trinidad
are example? of the wet tropics in the
new world, while .lava is an example
in the old world."
