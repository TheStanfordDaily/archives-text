# RUGBY VS. AMERICAN FOOTBALL
## 
### 
From the "Pasadena News" comes
the following editorial comment apro
pos of the recent discussion in the
southland regarding the abolition ol'
American football and the substitution
of rugby in some of the colleges and
preparatory schools:
"Under the auspices of the Skull
and Snakes Society of Stanford an
annual Rugby contest is planned on
the Cardinal field in which the crack
high school players north and south
are to pitted. It is a capital move to
stimulate interest in the game and
with so good material as we have at
home we shall hope to see Pasadena
get into training for this event by
next season. As it is our home school
is not properly represented in the
great rival games of the universities
and never will be so long as Amer
ican football is allowed to supplant
rugby. Why not join the procession?"
