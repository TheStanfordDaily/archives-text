# OLD STYLE PLUG-UGLY A THING OF THE PAST
## CONFERENCE WILL ADOPT NEW FORM OF RUSH. Resolution Adopted Eliminating Jectionable Features. Committee Will Propose Substitute. 
### 
The University Conference last
evening by definite action abolished
the Plug I'gly in its present form and
took steps toward the creation of a
new sort of upperclass rush. The work
of preparing preliminary plans for the
new method of manifesting friendly
Junior-Senior rivalry will be entrust
ed to a committee appointed by L. D.
Sunnnerlield, '1-, president of the Con
ference. The committee will make its
suggestions at the flrst Conference
meeting next semester.
The action taken by the Conference
was the adoption of a resolution that
"The Plug Ugly rush, which now in
cludes the farce and the pasting of
posters about the campus, be abol
ished, and a committee be appointed
to look up some method of substitu
tion to be reported to the Conference
at the flrst meeting next semester."
This leaves the Conference full
power to adopt an adequate test of
physical supremacy of the rival classes
minus the objectionable features of
the present rush.
The Plug Ugly in past years has
been a fruitful field for the growth
of evils which have been a source of
concern to those interested in the
success of Student Control. Attempts
at regulation having proved vain, total
eradication of the event seemed the
only remedy. Although this appeared
clearly at the last meeting of the Con
ference, action was postponed until
yesterday in the hope that some plan
might be devised to save the present
Plug Ugly. No such plan being sug
gested, and the fact being brought to
light that fresh complaints with ref
erence to the last Plug Ugly were be
ing made daily, the event, in its pres
ent shape was formally erased from
the list of campus affairs. A "bigger
and better" Plug Ugly will be its suc
cessor.
The committee to draw up plans for
the new style of rush will be com
posed of P. B. McKee, '14, chairman,
A. M. Standish, '14, and O. H.
Castle, '14.
