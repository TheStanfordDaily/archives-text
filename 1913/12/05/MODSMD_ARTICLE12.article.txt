# Requiescat in Pace

### 
The requiem has been sung for Junior Plug Ugly at Stanford. At
kast under their present plan they will be no more. This is the sub
stance of an edict passed by the University Conference. If another
form of uppcrclass amusement can be devised that will be suitable the
warring factions of the Junior and Senior classes .may again clash in
some sort of class ''scrap." This action comes as an aftermath of the
recent embroilment centering around the Plug Ugly.
When the Plug Ugly was in its infancy it had a purpose. I hit this
has long since passed into oblivion. The plug is no longer worn. Hence
there is no need of their christening. The poster and farce have ceased
to be humorous. Both have given rise to inexcusable breaches of good
conduct which would not occur under any other circumstances.
With its attendant dangerous features the Plug Ugly lias been a
constant source of trouble. It was a menace to student control. Other
than the argument that a healthy class rivalry was created there was no
justification for the Plug Ugly. Class spirit is an essential to a healthy
student body. 1 tut to justify the I'lug Ugly on this ground would be a
failure. For there are other means of generating this spirit than by
such occurances as have been attached to recent Plug Uglies. A rejuve
nation is necessary. The Plug Ugly has become a degenerate.
