# NOTED ENGINEER GIVES ILLUSTRATED ADDRESS
## Seventy-Five Slides Taken in General Electric Company's Factory Used in Explanation. 
### 
Illustrating his talk with a collec
tion of remarkable slides, E. O. Shreve,
turbine engineer of the General Elec
tric Company, last evening addressed
a well attended open meeting of the
Electrical Engineering Society on the
"Development of the Modern Turbine
Engine." The seventy-five slides used
in the address were taken in the fac
tory of the General Electric Company,
Schenectady, New York, which is per
haps the foremost concern of its kind.
The talk largely consisted of an expla
nation of these slides.
The various parts constituting the
modern turbine engine were shown in
introducing the subject. Then fol
lowed views picturing the assembling
of these parts in the assembling rooms
of the factory. A large number of
complete machines installed in var
ious power stations were also dis
played on the screen. These ranged
from the small twenty kilo-watt tur
bine in a baggage car to drive the
electric generators which supply the
current for lights and fans in the
Pullman cars, to the twenty thousand

i kilo-watt generators installed in the
I central power sations of great cities.
Ulne prints of two larger units are
i under construction at present, one
twenty-five thousand and the other
I thirty thousand kilo-watts rated capa
] city. The later is the greatest one
i now under process of construction,
j The speaker then showed the marve
lous development of the turbines, pre-
I dieting, in closing, the construction of
fifty thousand kilo-watt turbines in
the near future.
C. A .Binns, 'OS, now connected with
the General Electric Company as Gen
eral Agent in San Francisco, illus
trated the marvelous development of
the turbine by the statement that in
1910 he tested a fifty-five hundred kilo
watt turbine at the company's plant,
which was the greatest existent at the
time. This capacity has been in
creased sixfold in the latest machines.
