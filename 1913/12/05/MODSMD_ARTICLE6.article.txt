# SCENE OF BAND CONCERT WILL DEPEND ON WEATHER
## Encina Clubroom Will be Used on Sunday Afternoon in Case of Cold. 
### 
The prevailing cold weather will
probably result in the semester's Inst
band concert on next Sunday after
noon being held in Encina clubroom
instead of in the Inner Quad. Unless
Sunday is a warm, bright day the
public may expect the concert to he at
Encina and if a change of place is
made it will he announced on the bul
letin boards.
A euphonium solo by J. H. Wil
liams, '12, and cornet solos by W. M.
Bradford, '15, during the seventh num
ber, Lafranck's "Atlantis, the Lost
Continent," will lend variety to the
number.
