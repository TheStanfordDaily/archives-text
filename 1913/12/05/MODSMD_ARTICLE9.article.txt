# BABCOCK MAKES REPORT TO STANFORD ENGINEERS
## EXPLAINS ELECTRIFICATION OF TEHACHAPI. Plan Under Present Traffic Conditions Not Approved by Railway Expert. 
### 
A. H. Babcock, chief electrical engi
neer of the Southern Pacific Company,
spoke at the third assembly of the
series being given by the four engin
eering societies, yesterday afternoon,
lie took as the basis of his address
the report which he recently submit
ted to the vice-president of his com
pany as to the advisability of the
electrification of the Tehachapi,
which project he did not believe the
traffic conditions of the present time
warranted.
Mr. Babcock regretted the general
ignorance on the part of the student
engineers on the actual amount of
work required to gain accurate re
sults. The speaker went at length
into the exact methods used in report
investigations. The first step was a
personal investigation of the entire
line. Traffic conditions, physical con
ditions, profiles and weather condi
tions were consulted. Next came the
determination of the total freight and
passenger tonnage, segregated into
east and west bound traffic and sepa
rated into monthly statistics. These
were obtained Despatcher's
Train Register Sheets. Folowing this,
the highest days were selected. Loco
motive mileage, and the cost of loco
motive repairs were then considered.
The cost of fuel, water and the scale
of enginemen's wages were also
touched. The last figured on the op
position which the Brotherhood of
Locomotive Engineers would offer to
men being paid at the same rate
while driving two electric locomotives
as would be possible under the new
system. Train and load diagrams were
important factors in the determination
of the amount of power required, and
the locations of sub-stations and
power houses..
"You can't represent the actual con
ditions for a day," said Mr. Babcock.
"A locomotive will break down and
everything will be upset. Right there
comes the greatest opportunity for an
engineer to fudge. Gentlemen, I'll
just say flatly and plainly: 'Don't do
it.' Just get at the facts. If you don't,
hit it, just say to your chief that you
couldn't make it. Don't take oppor
tunity to smooth over the difficul
ties."
Comparison of electrical and steam
costs was made. On this division the
third rail system of power transfer
fance was found best. The speaker
touched upon the thesis required from
college students on such lines, lie
thought they were entirely too difficult
as they could not be made accurately
without a large quantity of both time
and money. lie advised a different
form of submitting estimates.
