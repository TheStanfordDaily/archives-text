Five members of last year's base
ball team are at present in college
and will be out for the first practice
to be called next semester. Second
base, cathcer, and right and canter
will have to be occupied by naw men.
Captain Z. A. Terry, '14, will be on
hand for his fourth season at short,

while A. G. Halm,
'14, left, will start
his third year. T.
E. Workman, '14,
first, R. C. Maple,
'14, pitcher, and
P. N. McCloskey,
'15, third, will all
be veterans for the
first time. Two
substitutes of last
year's team, A. S.

Hayes, '16, pitcher, and D. -M. Day, '10,
fielder, are both expected to report for
play.
If Maple can repeat as he did last
season and if Halm performs in the

box a3 we 11 as hS
did on the sum
mer's trip to the
Orient, the Card
inal team should
ba in a position to
again down the
California, Santa
Clara, and St.
Mary's teams.
Besides these
men an infusion of

baseball ability of Varsity caliber is
expected from the ranks of the Pea
nut League. The games played this

fall in that league
brought out much
material that will
have to be con
sidered in the
make-up of the
1914 Varsity. The
first practice will
be held about two
weeks after col
lege opens.
California will

also begin practice with a number of
veteran players in the ranks. Fall

under the direction of Captain Rubke.
