# Extravagance and Extravaganzas

Junior operas come and Junior operas become a theme for Quad
history but opera bills come regularly each month. At least this has
been the experience of the Junior class of last year. Thirteen hun
dred dollars is far too great a sum to expend for an evening's amuse
ment when the capacity of the theater can not exceed eleven hundred
dollars at the prevailing popular prices. T914 is still mediating over
this amount. Succeeding classes in their endeavor to produce an
opera which will overshadow all previous Junior shows, have added to
the burden which has taxed the class exchequer to a breaking point.
This occurred last spring. Last year the Juniors were unfortunate in
that a second performance was impossible because of other counter
attractions. But unforseeable happenings may reoccur.
In selecting an opera for next semester the 1915 committee may
well profit by the experience of older classes. Consider the opera's
adaptability as an opera of the type which meets the requirements of a
college audience. Then make the performance fit the purse.
