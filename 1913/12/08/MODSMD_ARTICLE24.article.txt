# CHAPLAIN MAKES STRONG PLEA FOR SOCIAL SERVICE
## DESCRIBES UNIVERSITY LIFE AS SOCIAL BUT SELFISH. "Boar Ye One Anothers Burdens" Proves Practical Lesson for College Students. 
### 
Chaplain l>. C harles Gardner gave
as the last sc-rnion of the semester in
Memorial Church yesterday morning,
a most powerful and vital talk on
social service, taking as his text
"Bear ye one another's burdens and
so fulfill the law of Christ."
"By Christ's teaching we learn that
social obligation rests upon the
'brotherhood of man.' Christ taught
duty to one's own kin and neighbor.
In Paul's words, 'God hath made of
one blood all nations of men' lies the
ethical doctrine of human brother
hood. Social service is done for the
sake of humanity, religious motives
and selfish motives.
"We are under all sorts of social ob
ligations. Our primary duty to so
ciety is to pay our debt. If we do not,
society suffers. Society is ultimately
taxed for every delinquency, not only
personal, but corporate debts. By not
paying our obligations, we make bur
dens for the weak to bear.
"Society gives us our status. In
the measure of our privilege lies our
obligations. 'Noblesse Oblige,' should
be our motto. We cannot go through
life thinking only of ourselves, our
ambitions and our riches. We should
at least learn to be sympathetic and
kind to all alike.
"University life is social, but selfish
and so we should strive to keep our
pity and sympathies fresh. 'Bear ye
one anothers burdens,' but be prac
tical, not extravagant and study the
conditions."
