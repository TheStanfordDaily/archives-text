# ENGINEERS VISIT DAMS.
## 
### 
The members of the Civil Engineer
ing society enjoyed an interesting trip
on last Friday, to the San Mateo,
San Andres and Pillirretos dams. The
party left Palo Alto on the 7: rÂ»9 train
for San Mateo, proceeded to walk to
the San Mateo dam, one of the largest
masonry dams in the world, and
thence to the other two structures,
which stand pre-eminent among earth
dams. An especial feature of the trip
was the courtesy of the Spring Valley
Water Company authorities who
showed the engineers the structures,
although usually there is absolutely
no admittance.
