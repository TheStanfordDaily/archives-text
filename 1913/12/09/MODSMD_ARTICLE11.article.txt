The purpose of the Bonnheim dis
sertation and discussion as defined
by the founder. Mr. Albert Bonnheim,
of Sacramento, is as follows: "It is
not so much desired to obtain new
facts or new truths in ethics as it is
to place the truth which we now have
before as many students as possible,
so that they will take greater interest
in questions dealing with ethical prob
lems.
Last year the general question was
"The Ethical Aspects of the Open
Shop." Premiums were awarded to A.
F. Coyle, '15, A. L. Johnson, '16. E. C.
