On account of the scarcity and poor
condition of the women's tennis courts
at Stanford, a committee has been ap
pointed by the Board of Directors of
the Women's Athletic Association to
look into the matter of procuring
new playing grounds. Laura Herron,
'14, and Beatrice Bingham, '14, com
pose the committee, which will inves
tigate the advisability of proceeding
immediately with the construction of
serviceable and fast tennis courts.
