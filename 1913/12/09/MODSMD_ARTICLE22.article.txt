# SLIGHT CHANGE MADE. IN MME. ZEISLER'S PROGRAM
## An Old College Sony: is Interwoven in Appropriate Number for Stanford Concert. 
### 
Since learning that she was to play
at Stanford University, Madame Fan
nie Bloomfleld Zeisler who appears
in the Assembly hall on Thursday
evening has expressed a desire to make
a change in the program that had been
arranged for her, playing in place of
a Beethoven suite a descriptive num
ber by Schuman, "Papillons." This
composition is a sort of miniature car
nival and has often been called "Dei-
Kleiner Karneval," being the por
trayal of various scenes during a cele
bration, ending with a ball and the
final hurried adieus as the clock
strikes six. Interwoven with this
number is an old college song of the
seventeenth century and this circum
stance led the artiste to select the
number for her Stanford program.
Madame Zeisler is recognized as the
greatest pianiste on the concert stage
and her record of "sold-out" houses
bears strong corroborative testimony
to the contention. In New York and
Chicago she only gives one recital a
year and it is looked upon as one of
the principal musical events in each
city. During the winter, Madame
Zeisler now tours Europe and the
United States, while her summers are
spent in Germany.
The subscription tickets for this
concert and the two remaining artist
recitals may be obtained at Wein
gartner's in Palo Alto until Thurs
day evening, the regular public sale
having opened there yesterday.
