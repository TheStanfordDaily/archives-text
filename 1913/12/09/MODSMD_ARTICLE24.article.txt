whom you all know, the gent who

an English professor, "Good evening
gentlemen, how do you mean? you lost
your dog?" is still on the campus.
Last evening Scotty gave an exhibi
tion of his rope defying powers In the
Encina club room before a large
audience. Per usual he got out of the

fresh fields.
