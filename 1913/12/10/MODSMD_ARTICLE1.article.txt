# CAP AND GOWN TO HOLD BIGGER PRE-PANAMA
## 
### 
Cap and Gown will again utilize the
Zoology Building, scene of last year's
pre-Panama, in a like entertainment,
only bigger and better than the two
traditional ones of former years. As
before, it will be given for the benefit
of the Women's Club House, and the
date set is January 2G.
The general scheme is to carry out
the idea of the exposition, and in order
to accomplish this, elaborate decora
tions will be used. The special fea
tures will be a port of entry, inspec
tion office, quarantine station, and a
street in San Francisco where every
sort of thing may be purchased in the
stores along its sides.
All of the women's organizations,
societies, and halls are helping with
the affair and many concessions have
already been given out under the di
rection of Ruth Price, concession man
ager.
Kappa Kappa Gamma will have
charge of the dancing, and it is said
that there will be professional demon
strations of the new dances. Enter
tainment will be amply supplied for
those who care for vaudeville. Four

big shows, each one absolutely differ
ent, will be presented. Langworthy
Club, Gamma Phi Beta, Alpha Omicron
Pi and Alpha Phi will all stand be
fore the footlights. Madrona has a
master hand working on a revival of
Alice in Wonderland, which promises
to be a scream.
There will also be a wonderful hall
of music, a veritable White Temple
where Schubert Club and other
musical talent will entertain. The
usual midway will be converted into
"The Canal" where Roble will con
duct, with plenty of fun and many new
ideas, a pike, together with a hall of
transportation, mechanics, agricul
ture, and arts. A moving picture show
will run a continuous performance of
several reels.
Kappa Alpha Theta will have charge
of a bowling alley and a checking de
partment for hats and coats. Eats
will be given in plenty and novel way,
for in addition to the facutly mem
bers of Cap and Gown with their deli
cious home-made eats, Mariposa will
serve ice cream and La Liana will
conduct a veritable dream of fancy
in their "Wizard of Oz Cafe."
There are other big features plan
ned, but not yet worked out. Watch
the advertisements which are in the
skillful hands of Margery Bailey.
