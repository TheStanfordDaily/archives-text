# IN MEMORIAM
## 
### 
Ruby M. Lynch, '13. Though
only a short time one of us, still
her sudden taking away has tilled
all our hearts with sorrow. Just
to express the utmost sympathy
for her family and intimate
friends do we here speak for the
campus community the depth ot'
our wish to console. To have
lost one from our Stanford
family, one who like Ruby had
endeared herself to all who had
known her in the short space of
one semester brings heartfelt
grief.
