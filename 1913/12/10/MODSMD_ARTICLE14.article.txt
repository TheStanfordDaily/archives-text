# ONE WORD MORE
## 
### 
It is Women's Day and we very nearly have "the last word." The adjoin
ing lot is the scene of great activity, pictured plans have already been dis
played. Perhaps "Club House" is too obvious a subject for comment. We
have sold song books, usurped the "movies," and "transformed the Inn" for
the benefit of Women's Club House this semester, but "the best is yet to
come." Pre-Panama time is at hand. With the beginning of next semester,
the women of the university will find vent for all vacation acquired pep, and
the excitement-loving public may disport itself gaily in true Post-Portola-
Pre-Panama fashion.
But there is another side to this question. Of course we aim to make

money, with the assurance of "a dollar's worth of fun per dollar"â€”yet aside
from the practical value, such an undertaking justifies itself in community
interest. Nothing has ever brought "the 500" so intimately together as did
last year's Pre-Panama. With fresh enthusiasm and new plans, the coming
.semester promises to open with enriched possibilities. It is such affairs,
with each unit of the student body working in co-operation for a single end,
but with just rivalry as to individual success, that develop the spirit of
democracy and unity upon which our university bases its claim to distinction.
This is what the Club House will concretely express, the harmonious blending
of all interests, and the more we work together to achieve it the more appre
ciative will we be when we have the actual building.
So here is next semester's watchword
