# AND THEN—

### 
Speaking of beginning the Club House reminds us that this year will have
a memorable commencement —and with the speedy disappearance of Senior
semesters it is not such a far cry to the end of the next one. Not only will
we have the Church once more, but the Union and Club House will stand in
reality. Will this not give sufficient cause for celebration? And shall we
again waste time and energy on the out-worn carnival? Are there not some
in the community who can offer plans for a form of entertainment befitting
the close of a triumphant year as well as of sufficient interest to attract
alumni?
