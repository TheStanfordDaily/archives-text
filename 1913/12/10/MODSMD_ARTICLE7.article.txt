# MASQUERS DECIDE UPON "QUALITY STREET," BY BARRIE, AS NEXT PLAY
## 
### 
Masquers will open next semester's
dramatic season with James Barrie's
charming four-act play "Quality
Street."
This play was originally written for
and successfully played by Miss Maude
Adams and is a winsome and charm
ing piece, especially suited to college
production.
The cast has not as yet been com-

pletely decided up
on but opportuni
ties are offered for
some extremely
l good character
work in many of
r tli o parts still
open. The cast is
composed of six
women's parts and
seven men. Final
decisions will be
made and parts as-

signed before Christmas vacation,
however, so rehearsals can lie com
menced without any delay at the be
ginning of the 1914 semester. The
play will be produced in Assembly
Hall on the night of February G.
The scene of action is laid in Eng
land during the Napoleonic wars, and
demands quaint and attractive cos
tuming and scenery.
One of the features of the play lies
in a school room scene in which eight
or nine aspirants of the local younger
set will have an opportunity to dis
play their histrionic ability.
Mr. Matthieu who will have charge
of the staging has pronounced this a
very good selection for a college
audience.
