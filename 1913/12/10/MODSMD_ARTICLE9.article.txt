# STANFORD ROUGHS WILL GREET PRETTY CHAPPITA
## 
### 
Contain thyself Oh son of the
Stanford Red! That co-edition of
Chappie for which yon have so
hungrily awaited, appears Friday.
For twenty-five cents, one quarter,
you will find out just what we think
of you. Cheer up!
Under the able direction of Editress
in-Chief Margery Bailey every kind of
treat is offered. Many of the contri
butions come from her versatile pen,
and her efforts to make the magazine
the best yet are successful.
A page on fashions by Miriam Har
rier may have some suggestions to
offer to the "rough," and a poem facing
it, the work of Dorothy Gunnel!, '14,
sets forth in the true Xmas spirit a
universal feminine desire for "Peace
on Earth, Good Will to Men.'
But boys! just wait till you read
those "Now Thats." The first one
dealing with Christmas Presents on
the Campus" deals delightfully with
a brand new subject in a brand new
way. Read and learn. The second,

(I shudder to soil this pure white
space), deals with that Plug Ugly.
A Dilettante by Gladys Briggs, '14,
appears under an attractive heading,
modeled after the style of Harrison
Fisher. Opposite the dilettante a full
page drawing by Miriam Harrier
strikes the key note of the issue. An
other full page drawing inspired by
roughneck corner where "every pros
pect pleases and only man is vile"
comes from the pen of Margaret Mer
rill, '14.
Then there's that take-off on the
Rams Head show. How could they
expect to escape? Even if the ham
mer does wear a pink bow it has lost
none of its weight.
Aside from these special features,
there will be a primer lesson for col
lege children and numerous short
jokes and small cuts. Among those
who have contributed are Evelyn
Trent, '15, Callie Smith, '14, Frances
Livengood, '13, Alice Rogers, '15, and
Mildred Gilbert, 13.
In connection with Annie Anderson,
(who was really awfully good about
cuts and stuff like that) the staff of
the journal is made up of Margery
Bailey, editress-in-chief, and "co-ed"'-
itors Constance Mader, Agnes Gray,
Miriam Harrier, Celesta Hobson,
Jacqueline Butler and Gladys Briggs.
