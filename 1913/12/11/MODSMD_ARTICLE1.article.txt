# DR. WILBUR EXPLAINS NATURE OF BOTULISM
## SLOW RECOVERY OF PATIENTS CONTINUES. Cases are Rare and Only Appeared Here by Chanceâ€”Disease is Not Contagions. 
### 
The condition of the students con
fined to the hospital as a result of food
poisoning known as botulism contin
ues to be favorable.
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur, head of the
Stanford Medical department, has
given personal attention to the disease,
and reports that the chances of its
further appearance here are very
remote, as it is a very rare malady
and is not contagious. It is not a
chemical poison. The botulinus is a
bacteria. However, ordinary cooking
or the process of canning usually de
stroys both the bacillus and the toxin,
so that its appearance is exceedingly
rare.
The source of the bacillus has not
been determined, and as yet cannot be
assigned to any particular food eaten.
The investigation will be as complete
as possible, but is somewhat hampered
by the lack of the actual food sources
for analysis.
