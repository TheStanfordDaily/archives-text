# Rejuvenate the Plug?

### 
Rejuvenate the Plug - Ugly. This is the task which has been given
over to a special committee from the University Conference. Officially
the Plug Ugly is dead. But like Hamlet's ghost it tarries behind. Re
construction along entirely different lines is a necessity. This is self
evident. Various plans have been tentatively suggested to take the
place of the old poster, show and rush. Most of them have been merely
substitutes for thought and when considered carefully have been found'
wanting. One of the most feasible plans offered is to omit the show
which belied the name, and stage the rush on the football turf. The two
upperclasses would be lined up on the opposite sides of the field. The
Juniors at a given signal would attempt to break through the Senior's
lines and distribute their posters —the latter being in charge of a com
mittee from the Student Council up to the time of the rush —among the
people 011 the bleachers. Once through the Senior's defence, the Juniors
are to be allowed to spread their posters without opposition. This
scheme proposes to allow a proper expurgation of the poster to be
made; will do away with the farce, and in placing the rush inside the
football field allow the Juniors to derive the revenue which they now
get from the show inside the track oval. The revival committee needs
suggestions. What have you to offer?
