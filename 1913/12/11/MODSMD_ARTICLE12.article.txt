# "A Twitch of the Switchâ€”That's All"

Vale, custodian of the lamp and lantern! Your days of usefulness
cndeth soon. It is the edict of progress. The old order changeth. Enter |
electricity. No longer will the flickering wick steeping in the midnight
supply of oil shed forth its rays to light the homeward journey of the j
student, exhausted from an evening of toil in the Library. No more will
the fickle flames guide the steps of the belated pedesterian meandering
Row ward from an evening's enjoyment in the gay metropolis. In placc
of the feeble glow of the oil lamp which has made the campus thorough
fares so dark that the fireflys have had to carry matches will burst forth
the radiance of electricity. It is the edict of the Trustees "Let there
be light" and light there shall be.
