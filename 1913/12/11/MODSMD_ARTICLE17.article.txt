# MIDNIGHT OIL TO BURN NO LONGER ON THE ROW
## 
### 
Modern methods are slowly, but
surely, replacing the old. The coal
oil lamps, which have dimly lighted I
the Stanford campus ever since the I
opening of the University, are to be J
replaced by new electric lights. The
Board of Trustees have authorized this
substitution.
The lights will be distributed on
Lasuen street, Alvarado Row, and '
along Salvatierra street as far as Ar- j
guello. There will be two lights at
the front of the Quad and several more j
will illuminate the county road at the
entrance to the Lasuen gate.
The familiar figure of the lamp
lighter who, in years past, has faith
fully attended to the lamps every |
evening, will no longer be seen mak
ing his rounds of the campus.
The work of installing the new elec-1
trie system will be begun immediately,
and the electric clusters will be in
place before the holidays.
