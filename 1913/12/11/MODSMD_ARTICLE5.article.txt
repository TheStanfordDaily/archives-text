# BROWN TO COACH SQUAD OF VETERANS
## 
### 
Coach Floyd Brown, '11, was appointed by the Executive Committee last
night to serve as instructor in rugby during the fall season of 1914. Brown
is a Four Star "S" man, having won a block letter in rugby four successive
seasons. His knowledge of football and ability to teach rugby tactics to the
candidates last season are responsible for the appointment. Last season
Brown got the 1913 Varsity in winning form for the contest with California,
having served an apprenticeship as assistant to the coaching committee in
1912.
With the three exceptions of Captain "Jimmy" Thoburn, "Stogie" Peck,
and "Bill" Darsie, Stanford's 1913 veteran rugby team will appear in suits
as a unit at the first football practice next fall. The other fifteen players
who opposed California last month have expressed their intention of return
ing to college, and all will be eligible for the 1914 Varsity. Besides the 1913
"S" men who will return, Captain-elect F. J. Card stated last night that
ten of the substitutes in the Big Game who did not get in the play expect to
report at he initial football rally. Present indications are that most of the
Freshmen who won their block "17 's" this season will also appear on the
turf.
Two new eligibles who will make strong claims for the Varsity next
season are Wylie, of New Zealand, the wonderful front ranker, and C. K.
King, '14, who was ineligible to try out for the Varsity this year, being a
transfer from Santa Clara. Wylie visited Stanford this year with the invinc
ible All-Blacks, and also played with the Waratahs of Australia, who came to
California last season. He is reckoned one of the best rugby players in the
world and is sure to add strength to the Cardinal scrum. King practiced con
sistently during the season, and showed unusual backfield ability. The one
year transfer restriction will not bar him from play next season.
Among the most recent "S" winners Watkins, Wines, Hall, Clover, Gard,
and Blase will be candidates for forward positions. Soper, Dubendorf, Braden,
Cgden, Knight and Pettingill, all substitute scrum men in the last intercol
legiate match, expect to enter he race with the benefit of veteran experience.
Backfield entries from the ranks of the "S" men will be Tilton, Reeves,
Austin, Lachmund, Carroll, Davidson, Andrews, Urban and Erb.
Veteran members of the 1913 squad who will bid for places in the back
field are Burns and Patterson.
The promise of such a list of tried veterans in fall practice insures com
petition of keen order, and shows a remarkable Stanford team in prospect.
With the annual drafting of good rugby players from the ranks of entering
students to count on, the struggle for berths on the Varsity line-up should
outclass that of any previous year.
Captain Thoburn, of the 1913 Varsity will return to college next fall, but
will be ineligible to play on account of the four year limit. Darsie will travel
between San Francisco and New York in the interests of an asparagus busi
ness in the Sacramento Valley. Peck will graduate from the Mechanical
Engineering Department this year.

Austin, Lachmund, Carroll, Davidson, Andrews, Urban and Erb.
Veteran members of the 1913 squad who will bid for places in the back
field are Burns and Patterson.
The promise of such a list of tried veterans in fall practice insures com
petition of keen order, and shows a remarkable Stanford team in prospect.
With the annual drafting of good rugby players from the ranks of entering
students to count on, the struggle for berths on the Varsity line-up should
outclass that of any previous year.
Captain Thoburn, of the 1913 Varsity will return to college next fall, but
will be ineligible to play on account of the four year limit. Darsie will travel
between San Francisco and New York in the interests of an asparagus busi
ness in the Sacramento Valley. Peck will graduate from the Mechanical
Engineering Department this year.

Coach Floyd Brown, '11, was appointed by the Executive Committee last
night to serve as instructor in rugby during the fall season of 1914. Brown
is a Four Star "S" man, having won a block letter in rugby four successive
seasons. His knowledge of football and ability to teach rugby tactics to the
candidates last season are responsible for the appointment. Last season
Brown got the 1913 Varsity in winning form for the contest with California,
having served an apprenticeship as assistant to the coaching committee in
1912.
With the three exceptions of Captain "Jimmy" Thoburn, "Stogie" Peck,
and "Bill" Darsie, Stanford's 1913 veteran rugby team will appear in suits
as a unit at the first football practice next fall. The other fifteen players
who opposed California last month have expressed their intention of return
ing to college, and all will be eligible for the 1914 Varsity. Besides the 1913
"S" men who will return, Captain-elect F. J. Card stated last night that
ten of the substitutes in the Big Game who did not get in the play expect to
report at he initial football rally. Present indications are that most of the
Freshmen who won their block "17 's" this season will also appear on the
turf.
Two new eligibles who will make strong claims for the Varsity next
season are Wylie, of New Zealand, the wonderful front ranker, and C. K.
King, '14, who was ineligible to try out for the Varsity this year, being a
transfer from Santa Clara. Wylie visited Stanford this year with the invinc
ible All-Blacks, and also played with the Waratahs of Australia, who came to
California last season. He is reckoned one of the best rugby players in the
world and is sure to add strength to the Cardinal scrum. King practiced con
sistently during the season, and showed unusual backfield ability. The one
year transfer restriction will not bar him from play next season.
Among the most recent "S" winners Watkins, Wines, Hall, Clover, Gard,
and Blase will be candidates for forward positions. Soper, Dubendorf, Braden,
Cgden, Knight and Pettingill, all substitute scrum men in the last intercol
legiate match, expect to enter he race with the benefit of veteran experience.
Backfield entries from the ranks of the "S" men will be Tilton, Reeves,
Austin, Lachmund, Carroll, Davidson, Andrews, Urban and Erb.
