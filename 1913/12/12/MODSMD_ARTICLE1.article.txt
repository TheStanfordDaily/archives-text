# J.L. DUFF, '13, EDITS HIS LAST ISSUE OF SEQUOIA
## W.H. OWENS, '14, WHITES INSIDE STORY ON DRAMATICS. Editorials Decry Attempts Being Made to Find Substitute for Tabooed Junior Plug Ugly. 
### 
A view of Stanford dramatics from
the inside, is given in the current
Sequoia in an article by W. B. Owens,
'14. It is entitled "Behind the
Scenes in Stanford Dramatics."
Owens has taken a prominent part in

college theatricals
and knows his sub
ject as well as any
man in college,
lie urges a better
representation of
students in the try
out squads, he sug
gests a system of
tryout plays and
also says the Soph
omore play should

be held during the first semester, in
stead of the second.
The Sequoia, of which Owens'
article is a feature, will be on sale
Monday. It is the last issue of the
year and marks the passing of J. L.
Duff, '13, as editor, and C. F. Paul, '13,
as manager. In the editorial columns
Duff says nothing of his departure.
Instead he decries any attempt to re
juvenate the Plug Ugly, claiming that,
no upperclass fight is better than a
fracas of any kind. The Stanford
spirit also serves as the motif for one
of Duff's last editorials. He claims
that the Cardinal spirit can be shown
every day in the year and points some
instances where its absence in campus
affairs has been noticed.
Sequoia announces the election of
H. C. Boyd, '13, Miss Sydnie Gardner,
'13, and W. P. Staniford, '16, to the
staff. Miss Dorothy Gunnel], '14, is to
succeed Duff as editor. Boyd will be
manager next semester.
The Sketch Book, a feature of the
Sequoias of several years ago, is in
cluded in the coming issue. The
Sketch Hook of this number contains
two short sketches. One is "The
House of Niles," by Miss Sydnie Gard
ner, and the other is "Mister Mills,
Detective," by G. Robinson, '17.
"The Last Laugh," a poetic soliloquy
of a suicide, which was written by
Miss Gladys Briggs, '14. is included
in this issue. "The Last Laugh" is an
admirable piece of work and is said
by critics to be one of the best pieces
of its kind ever written by a Stan
ford student.
Miss Margery Bailey, '14, has writ
ten a story, "The Love Charm." Her
work has been illustrated by herself.
"And He Saw a Face," a story by .T.
W. Bennett, '15, and a poem "The
Will of the Wisp," by Alice Rogers,
'15, complete the issue.


W. 11. Owens.
