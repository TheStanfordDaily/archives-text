# Before We Come Back No More
## 
### 
As we count our hours over, every one a part. Rosary like, while the
shadows of approaching examinations enshroud the typewriter and
make "hunting" on the keyboard difficult, we realize that our last oppor
tunity for "crabbing and criticizing" is well nigh at hand. Grinding in
our ears we hear the machinery of final "exes" as it steam rolls over all
opposition to work and worry. \\ e must hurry to our task.
Like the proverbial feline, "finals return to us with a regularity
that is appalling. Our only respite will be when "we come back no
more." Then why should we complain since they are inevitable. This
is it. We think the present system is wrong. As it is every department
in the University does not give finals or at least do not term them as
such. Of course, the work in some departments is of a different nature
than in others. A history student conducts his investigations along
different lines than does the man working in the drafting room or labo
ratory. l»ut this may be taken into consideration. We believe that in
many examinations the intent is to learn what a man does not know
rather than finding out what he has learned.
Six days shait man labor and the seventh shalt he rest. If this was
the motive which actuated the crowding of the final "exes" in the short
space allotted to them there has been an error in judgment. The present
plan is as up-to-date as the Russian calendar. The system now in vogue
could not be changed in a day but must come graduallyWe think the
subject is worthy of thought on the part of the Faculty. If final "exes"
like family relations are to be with us always then why not make the
burden as light as possible ?
