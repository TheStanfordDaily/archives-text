# EXPERIENCED MEN ARE NUCLEUS FOR 1914 VARSITY TRACK TEAM
## Pre-Season Prognostications Indicate Close Score in the Annual Intercollegiate Meet Although Many of the Veterans Will Report to Captain McKee. 
### 
"Whether Stanford wins or loses on
the cinder-path next semester de
pends on the scholarship standing jf
some of our athletes at the end of the
present semester. In any event it will
be a very close contest. The loss of
Don Dawson and "Ric" Templeton
means a loss of seven points or pos
sibly more. The present outlook in
the sprints is fairly good, as is that
in the half mile, mile, high and low
hurdles. From present prospects we
are not too strong in the 440 and two
mile events. There is a chance for
marked improvement in the weight
events, while there is good material
available for the pole vault and
broad jump. We cannot figure for

better than second in the high jump.
Again L wish to state that with the
iirst year possibilities and . everyone
coming through we stand a fighting
chance in the spring track meet with
California, but we are due for an
other close score."
"DAD" MOULTON.
Less than a point will separate vic
tory from defeat for the second suc
cessive time in the annual track
meet between Stanford and Califor
nia according to early season predic
tions. The entire issue of the Car
dinal prospects for next spring de
pends on the scholarship standing of
a number of track men. According to
"Dad," if every pupil of his comes
through Stanford again has a fighting
chance.
With a nucleus of thirteen varsity

"S" veteran track men ready to report
the first of next semester and the pos
sibility of developing many of the
first-year men into point winners the
prospects should be optimistic rather
than pessimistic. Of those who won
points for Stanford in the meet last
year, eleven are entered in college at
the present time, besides two other
veterans of former intercollegiate
contests. They are: Captain P. B. Mc-
Kee, '14; E. P. Campbell, '13; R. W.
Brown, '13; R. L. Murray, '13; F. J.
Gard, '14; J. W. Richdale, '14; E. M.
Bonnett, '15; G. W. Bedeau, '15; P. R.
Wilson, '1G; J. H. Whitted, '16; F. S.
Murray, '1G; J. M. Tufts, 'IG, and R.
Krohn, '16.
Stanford will lose two point win
ners this year in R. 11. Templeton,
'15, and D. Dawson, '15. Templeton
is a member of the American track
team which will tour the Antipodes
this winter and will not return in
time to compete on the Cardinal team,
while Dawson has decided'to continue
in business in Los Angeles. It is
probable that F. S. McClure, '15, will,
again register at the opening of the
semester and thus augment the
strength of the Cardinal in the 440-
yard dash.
In the sprints Stanford has some of
the best men on the Coast ready to
report for training at the annual
rally next semester. Captain McKee,
the runner who defeated "Fui" Wood
of California and thereby won the
meet for Stanford last spring can be
counted on in both the century and
220-yard dash. Both he and ex-Cap
tain Campbell hold the records of 10
seconds flat for the 100-yard dash, and
22 seconds flat for the furlong. R. W.
Brown can again be figured as a
strong contender for a place in the
220. Among the first year men who
have shown promise of good material
in the sprints are R. 11. Grant, W. A.
Lynn and O. G. Lachmund.
Campbell, Chace, Gard, Richdale
and Wolcott seem to be the best ma
terial in the 440-yard dash. Gard
placed third in this race in the Inter
collegiate contest last year, besides


Track Captain I'aul McKoe, '14.
running one lap in the relay race.
Chace and Campbell showed to ad
vantage in the Portola track meet
this fall and ran on last year's relay
team. Richdale won his varsity "S"
as a relay runner in 1912.
For two years Bonnett has shown
supremacy over all contestants in the
half mile run and should be counted
on to repeat again in 1914. With
"Lin" Murray as a teammate, the
chances for the Cardinal in this event
should be considered bright. E. T.
Worthy, '14, T. Angell, '15, and H. A.
Frye, '17, may he counted on for keen
competition.
P. R. Wilson who broke the Stan
ford-California mile record last sea
son will be the runner in whom "Dad"
places the most confidence for annex
ing first place. C. M. Irwin, '16, will
be a likely contender in the four-lap
event.
Prospects for the two-mile are
weaker than they have been for
several years. The strength of the
Cardinal in these events will lie
in the material developed in the cross
country training this semester.
According to "Dad," Stanford will
be stronger in the hurdles than in any
other event. With two varsity "S"
men, Whitted and Murray, again in
togs and J. K. Norton, '16, and .1. C.
Urban, '16, as a nucleus of men on
whom California will have to count as
point winners the confidence of the
trainer seems well founded.
Wealth of material makes it certain
that the pole vaulters will not be found
wanting in ability in the crucial test.
Krohn, Tufts, Macomber and Saylor
are all good for twelve feet. Krohn
and Tufts tied with Miller and Stev
ens of Stanford and Young of Cali
fornia for first place at 12 feet 1 inch
last season. J. S. Hutchinson, '16, is
another pole vaulter of ability.
C. W. Knight, '14, and O. G. Lach
mund, '17, both have records of over
22 feet 6 inches in the broad jump,
while Lachmund is a likely contender
in the high jump, having cleared 6 feet
2 inches while in preparatory school.
Z. B. West, '17, may also be counted
on in the high jump.
In the weights the present indica
tions are better than they have been
for two years. Bedeau and V. A.
Sheldon, '15, may be relied on in the
shot put, while I?. F. Drake, '16, V. L.
King, '16, and W. L. Miller, '17, give
promise of developing into available
point winners.

son will be the runner in whom "Dad"
places the most confidence for annex
ing first place. C. M. Irwin, '16, will
be a likely contender in the four-lap
event.
Prospects for the two-mile are
weaker than they have been for
several years. The strength of the
Cardinal in these events will lie
in the material developed in the cross
country training this semester.
According to "Dad," Stanford will
be stronger in the hurdles than in any
other event. With two varsity "S"
men, Whitted and Murray, again in
togs and J. K. Norton, '16, and .1. C.
Urban, '16, as a nucleus of men on
whom California will have to count as
point winners the confidence of the
trainer seems well founded.
Wealth of material makes it certain
that the pole vaulters will not be found
wanting in ability in the crucial test.
Krohn, Tufts, Macomber and Saylor
are all good for twelve feet. Krohn
and Tufts tied with Miller and Stev
ens of Stanford and Young of Cali
fornia for first place at 12 feet 1 inch
last season. J. S. Hutchinson, '16, is
another pole vaulter of ability.
C. W. Knight, '14, and O. G. Lach
mund, '17, both have records of over
22 feet 6 inches in the broad jump,
while Lachmund is a likely contender
in the high jump, having cleared 6 feet
2 inches while in preparatory school.
Z. B. West, '17, may also be counted
on in the high jump.
In the weights the present indica
tions are better than they have been
for two years. Bedeau and V. A.
Sheldon, '15, may be relied on in the
shot put, while I?. F. Drake, '16, V. L.
King, '16, and W. L. Miller, '17, give
promise of developing into available
point winners.
"Whether Stanford wins or loses on
the cinder-path next semester de
pends on the scholarship standing jf
some of our athletes at the end of the
present semester. In any event it will
be a very close contest. The loss of
Don Dawson and "Ric" Templeton
means a loss of seven points or pos
sibly more. The present outlook in
the sprints is fairly good, as is that
in the half mile, mile, high and low
hurdles. From present prospects we
are not too strong in the 440 and two
mile events. There is a chance for
marked improvement in the weight
events, while there is good material
available for the pole vault and
broad jump. We cannot figure for

better than second in the high jump.
Again L wish to state that with the
iirst year possibilities and . everyone
coming through we stand a fighting
chance in the spring track meet with
California, but we are due for an
other close score."
"DAD" MOULTON.
Less than a point will separate vic
tory from defeat for the second suc
cessive time in the annual track
meet between Stanford and Califor
nia according to early season predic
tions. The entire issue of the Car
dinal prospects for next spring de
pends on the scholarship standing of
a number of track men. According to
"Dad," if every pupil of his comes
through Stanford again has a fighting
chance.
With a nucleus of thirteen varsity

"S" veteran track men ready to report
the first of next semester and the pos
sibility of developing many of the
first-year men into point winners the
prospects should be optimistic rather
than pessimistic. Of those who won
points for Stanford in the meet last
year, eleven are entered in college at
the present time, besides two other
veterans of former intercollegiate
contests. They are: Captain P. B. Mc-
Kee, '14; E. P. Campbell, '13; R. W.
Brown, '13; R. L. Murray, '13; F. J.
Gard, '14; J. W. Richdale, '14; E. M.
Bonnett, '15; G. W. Bedeau, '15; P. R.
Wilson, '1G; J. H. Whitted, '16; F. S.
Murray, '1G; J. M. Tufts, 'IG, and R.
Krohn, '16.
Stanford will lose two point win
ners this year in R. 11. Templeton,
'15, and D. Dawson, '15. Templeton
is a member of the American track
team which will tour the Antipodes
this winter and will not return in
time to compete on the Cardinal team,
while Dawson has decided'to continue
in business in Los Angeles. It is
probable that F. S. McClure, '15, will,
again register at the opening of the
semester and thus augment the
strength of the Cardinal in the 440-
yard dash.
In the sprints Stanford has some of
the best men on the Coast ready to
report for training at the annual
rally next semester. Captain McKee,
the runner who defeated "Fui" Wood
of California and thereby won the
meet for Stanford last spring can be
counted on in both the century and
220-yard dash. Both he and ex-Cap
tain Campbell hold the records of 10
seconds flat for the 100-yard dash, and
22 seconds flat for the furlong. R. W.
Brown can again be figured as a
strong contender for a place in the
220. Among the first year men who
have shown promise of good material
in the sprints are R. 11. Grant, W. A.
Lynn and O. G. Lachmund.
Campbell, Chace, Gard, Richdale
and Wolcott seem to be the best ma
terial in the 440-yard dash. Gard
placed third in this race in the Inter
collegiate contest last year, besides


Track Captain I'aul McKoe, '14.
running one lap in the relay race.
Chace and Campbell showed to ad
vantage in the Portola track meet
this fall and ran on last year's relay
team. Richdale won his varsity "S"
as a relay runner in 1912.
For two years Bonnett has shown
supremacy over all contestants in the
half mile run and should be counted
on to repeat again in 1914. With
"Lin" Murray as a teammate, the
chances for the Cardinal in this event
should be considered bright. E. T.
Worthy, '14, T. Angell, '15, and H. A.
Frye, '17, may he counted on for keen
competition.
P. R. Wilson who broke the Stan

In the sprints Stanford has some of
the best men on the Coast ready to
report for training at the annual
rally next semester. Captain McKee,
the runner who defeated "Fui" Wood
of California and thereby won the
meet for Stanford last spring can be
counted on in both the century and
220-yard dash. Both he and ex-Cap
tain Campbell hold the records of 10
seconds flat for the 100-yard dash, and
22 seconds flat for the furlong. R. W.
Brown can again be figured as a
strong contender for a place in the
220. Among the first year men who
have shown promise of good material
in the sprints are R. 11. Grant, W. A.
Lynn and O. G. Lachmund.
Campbell, Chace, Gard, Richdale
and Wolcott seem to be the best ma
terial in the 440-yard dash. Gard
placed third in this race in the Inter
collegiate contest last year, besides


Track Captain I'aul McKoe, '14.
running one lap in the relay race.
Chace and Campbell showed to ad
vantage in the Portola track meet
this fall and ran on last year's relay
team. Richdale won his varsity "S"
as a relay runner in 1912.
For two years Bonnett has shown
supremacy over all contestants in the
half mile run and should be counted
on to repeat again in 1914. With
"Lin" Murray as a teammate, the
chances for the Cardinal in this event
should be considered bright. E. T.
Worthy, '14, T. Angell, '15, and H. A.
Frye, '17, may he counted on for keen
competition.
P. R. Wilson who broke the Stan
ford-California mile record last sea
son will be the runner in whom "Dad"
places the most confidence for annex
ing first place. C. M. Irwin, '16, will
be a likely contender in the four-lap
event.
Prospects for the two-mile are
weaker than they have been for
several years. The strength of the
Cardinal in these events will lie
in the material developed in the cross
country training this semester.
According to "Dad," Stanford will
be stronger in the hurdles than in any
other event. With two varsity "S"
men, Whitted and Murray, again in
togs and J. K. Norton, '16, and .1. C.
Urban, '16, as a nucleus of men on
whom California will have to count as
point winners the confidence of the
trainer seems well founded.
Wealth of material makes it certain
that the pole vaulters will not be found
wanting in ability in the crucial test.
Krohn, Tufts, Macomber and Saylor
are all good for twelve feet. Krohn
and Tufts tied with Miller and Stev
ens of Stanford and Young of Cali
fornia for first place at 12 feet 1 inch
last season. J. S. Hutchinson, '16, is
another pole vaulter of ability.
C. W. Knight, '14, and O. G. Lach
mund, '17, both have records of over
22 feet 6 inches in the broad jump,
while Lachmund is a likely contender
in the high jump, having cleared 6 feet
2 inches while in preparatory school.
Z. B. West, '17, may also be counted
on in the high jump.
In the weights the present indica
tions are better than they have been
for two years. Bedeau and V. A.
Sheldon, '15, may be relied on in the
shot put, while I?. F. Drake, '16, V. L.
King, '16, and W. L. Miller, '17, give
promise of developing into available
point winners.
"Whether Stanford wins or loses on
the cinder-path next semester de
pends on the scholarship standing jf
some of our athletes at the end of the
present semester. In any event it will
be a very close contest. The loss of
Don Dawson and "Ric" Templeton
means a loss of seven points or pos
sibly more. The present outlook in
the sprints is fairly good, as is that
in the half mile, mile, high and low
hurdles. From present prospects we
are not too strong in the 440 and two
mile events. There is a chance for
marked improvement in the weight
events, while there is good material
available for the pole vault and
broad jump. We cannot figure for

better than second in the high jump.
Again L wish to state that with the
iirst year possibilities and . everyone
coming through we stand a fighting
chance in the spring track meet with
California, but we are due for an
other close score."
"DAD" MOULTON.
Less than a point will separate vic
tory from defeat for the second suc
cessive time in the annual track
meet between Stanford and Califor
nia according to early season predic
tions. The entire issue of the Car
dinal prospects for next spring de
pends on the scholarship standing of
a number of track men. According to
"Dad," if every pupil of his comes
through Stanford again has a fighting
chance.
With a nucleus of thirteen varsity

"S" veteran track men ready to report
the first of next semester and the pos
sibility of developing many of the
first-year men into point winners the
prospects should be optimistic rather
than pessimistic. Of those who won
points for Stanford in the meet last
year, eleven are entered in college at
the present time, besides two other
veterans of former intercollegiate
contests. They are: Captain P. B. Mc-
Kee, '14; E. P. Campbell, '13; R. W.
Brown, '13; R. L. Murray, '13; F. J.
Gard, '14; J. W. Richdale, '14; E. M.

Wilson, '1G; J. H. Whitted, '16; F. S.
Murray, '1G; J. M. Tufts, 'IG, and R.
Krohn, '16.
Stanford will lose two point win
ners this year in R. 11. Templeton,
'15, and D. Dawson, '15. Templeton
is a member of the American track
team which will tour the Antipodes
this winter and will not return in
time to compete on the Cardinal team,
while Dawson has decided'to continue
in business in Los Angeles. It is
probable that F. S. McClure, '15, will,
again register at the opening of the
semester and thus augment the
strength of the Cardinal in the 440-
yard dash.
