# EXPERIENCED MEN ARE NUCLEUS FOR 1914 VARSITY TRACK TEAM
## Pre-Season Prognostications Indicate Close Score in the Annual Intercollegiate Meet Although Many of the Veterans Will Report to Captain McKee. 
### 
"Whether Stanford wins or loses on
the cinder-path next semester de
pends on the scholarship standing jf
some of our athletes at the end of the
present semester. In any event it will
be a very close contest. The loss of
Don Dawson and "Ric" Templeton
means a loss of seven points or pos
sibly more. The present outlook in
the sprints is fairly good, as is that
in the half mile, mile, high and low
hurdles. From present prospects we
are not too strong in the 440 and two
mile events. There is a chance for
marked improvement in the weight
events, while there is good material
available for the pole vault and
broad jump. We cannot figure for

better than second in the high jump.
Again L wish to state that with the
iirst year possibilities and . everyone
coming through we stand a fighting
chance in the spring track meet with
California, but we are due for an
other close score."
"DAD" MOULTON.
Less than a point will separate vic
tory from defeat for the second suc
cessive time in the annual track
meet between Stanford and Califor
nia according to early season predic
tions. The entire issue of the Car
dinal prospects for next spring de
pends on the scholarship standing of
a number of track men. According to
"Dad," if every pupil of his comes
through Stanford again has a fighting
chance.
With a nucleus of thirteen varsity

"S" veteran track men ready to report
the first of next semester and the pos
sibility of developing many of the
first-year men into point winners the
prospects should be optimistic rather
than pessimistic. Of those who won
points for Stanford in the meet last
year, eleven are entered in college at
the present time, besides two other
veterans of former intercollegiate
contests. They are: Captain P. B. Mc-
Kee, '14; E. P. Campbell, '13; R. W.
Brown, '13; R. L. Murray, '13; F. J.
Gard, '14; J. W. Richdale, '14; E. M.
Bonnett, '15; G. W. Bedeau, '15; P. R.
Wilson, '1G; J. H. Whitted, '16; F. S.
Murray, '1G; J. M. Tufts, 'IG, and R.
Krohn, '16.
Stanford will lose two point win
ners this year in R. 11. Templeton,
'15, and D. Dawson, '15. Templeton
is a member of the American track
team which will tour the Antipodes
this winter and will not return in
time to compete on the Cardinal team,
while Dawson has decided'to continue
in business in Los Angeles. It is
probable that F. S. McClure, '15, will,
again register at the opening of the
semester and thus augment the
strength of the Cardinal in the 440-
yard dash.
In the sprints Stanford has some of
the best men on the Coast ready to
report for training at the annual
rally next semester. Captain McKee,
the runner who defeated "Fui" Wood
of California and thereby won the
meet for Stanford last spring can be
counted on in both the century and
220-yard dash. Both he and ex-Cap
tain Campbell hold the records of 10
seconds flat for the 100-yard dash, and
22 seconds flat for the furlong. R. W.
Brown can again be figured as a
strong contender for a place in the
220. Among the first year men who
have shown promise of good material
in the sprints are R. 11. Grant, W. A.
Lynn and O. G. Lachmund.
Campbell, Chace, Gard, Richdale
and Wolcott seem to be the best ma
terial in the 440-yard dash. Gard
placed third in this race in the Inter
collegiate contest last year, besides


Track Captain I'aul McKoe, '14.
