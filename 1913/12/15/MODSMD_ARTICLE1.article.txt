### 
The Football Association of Eng
land celebrated the fiftieth anniver
sary of its founding on the day of the
Big Game here, by a great banquet in
London, at which all the men promi
nently identified with the sport in
England met for the golden jubilee.
Dr. Jordan has been following the
trend of the sport closely during his
sojourn in England, and recently
mailed friends on the campus an in
teresting clipping from a London
newspaper on "Fifty Years of Foot
ball."
If the founders of the Association
could have foreseen the future of the
game they would have been mightily
surprised. Not one of the men who
met in London, in October, ISG3,
realized that he was taking part in the
foundation of an association that
would rank as one of the greatest in
stitutions of this or any other age.
"As the game was founded in Lon
don, it is quite natural that the men
associated with it should belong to
London and the south of England.
In those days there were one or two
clubs in the north, but London was
really the center of all football, and
chited with schools and 'Old Boys' in
stitutions.
" Hacking' was a recognized fea
ture of the game, and when it waa
proposed to abolish hacking, or kick
ing, and tripping it was argued that
'all the pluck and courage of tha
game would be at an end.'
"A story is told that when the pres
ent head of the football association,
Lord Kin'iuird, met an old schoolmate
in an international match, the Presi
dent, then a vigorous youth, used his
feet so much on his opponent's legs
that the latter expostulated, and asked
whether they were playing football or
hacking."
"In I&C7 a number of Sheffield
players organized an association oi
their own and the game came to bo
played almost as much in the north
as in London. Inter-city matches be
gan at this time, and the players were
distinguished principally by the 'vigor
of their tactics.'
"The first international match was
played in 1572, between England and
Scotland, and immediately thereafter
numerous clubs sprang up all over the
country. Professionalism was legal
ized when it was seen that the pro
fessional player was inevitable in the
city clubs, and from that time the
game made great strides. The crowds'
at the final matches grew from thou
sands to tens of thousands, and every
town supported its team.
"In London at the present time there
are only a dozen professional clubs,
and along with them we see something
between thirty and forty thousand
amateurs playing the game every
Saturday afternoon. Wherever the
professional has made his way tlio
amateur has multiplied, and the game
has prospered exceedingly.
"The origin and growth of league
football has been a powerful stimulus
to the game. The Football Associa
tion has been assailed time and again,
but it has withstood the shocks and is
secure in the knowledge that the
league exists for all who love the
game."

would rank as one of the greatest in
