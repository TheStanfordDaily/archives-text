Applying business rules of efficiency to a scholastic institution the
Board of Trustees announced at the beginning of the year that a new
policy was to govern Stanford—a departure in educational fields. To
raise the standard of the old before any new departments; to spend 110
money 011 buildings except those which are absolutely necessary; to
encourage those who have a special aptitude fcr certain professions and
to attract students who are obliged to work their way through the
university, this in a nutshell was the new policy. Great bodies move
slowly. The Stanford Board of Trustees is no exception. Tentative
plans for a new library, a new gymnasium and additional buildings for
the Medical school, have been drawn up and we are gratified to see
sufficient evidence of the sincerity of the announcement of the radical
changes to lead us to believe that the improvements in the University
pre not too far in the future. l>efore another semester is indexed in the
great register of old Pater Temporis we should like to witness the
beginning of actual construction on the new Library and the new
gymnasium.
Since this is the season of holly and holidays suggestions for suit
able Christmas gifts are not amiss. For the campus we recommend a
better telephone service to take the place of the present modern incon
venience and a better fire protection. For the cinder path there is needed
an electric timing device to clock the performers in the track events.
The present semester has been one of construction. We have had
the pleasurable duty of recording the installation of a new president.
The four elements which make up the University have become better
acquainted and the benefits that will be reaped are to come in the future.
After years of effort, the Stanford Union and Women's Clubhouse
project has become a reality.
Athletically, Stanford has taken the honors on the rugby turf; her
players have met the best that New Zealand could send
across the sea and met them creditably; in soccer we have witnessed a
victory and a tie with California; a championship rugby match for the
preparatory school players has been instituted as an annual affair.
Debating activities have not been neglected and the annual intercollegiate
debate was placed on the credit side of the ledger.
