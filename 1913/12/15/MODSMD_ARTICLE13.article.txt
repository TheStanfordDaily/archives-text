As this last sheet of "copy" paper pressed against the platen of the
typewriter and we work to the accompaniment of the rythmic rumble

oi the presses out tn the composing 1 room, we come to the relinquish
ment of our editorial duties. The semester has had its pleasure and its
work. In passing' from the editorial control we are grateful to the
members of the staff for their splendid co-operation throughout the
semester.
Without the unselfish and ceaseless work of the men and women
who daily grind out the "news" in the little six-by-four office, so
crowded that it is almost necessary to paint the typewriters on the walls,
our efforts would be a failure. lit is an education in itself to attempt to
please the fickle public, to publish the paper on each college day and at
the same time carry on the side line known as "college work." With
this issue Volume 43 is brought to a close. To Otis 11. Castle, our
successor, we wish the best of luck.
