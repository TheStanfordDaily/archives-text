# EIGHT VETERANS ASSURE ANOTHER STRONG CREW
## EX-CAPTAIN DURYEA ALONE WILL BE MISSING. Men from 1916 Freshmen Shell Expect to Make Eight for Seats on Varsity Boat. 
### 
Stanford may reasonably expect a
winning crew next semester, as condi
ditons for a successful season are
more favorable than they have ever
been before in the annals of Cardinal
boating. Every member of the 1913
eight will be on hand for spring prac
tice except R. P. Duryea, '13, last
year's captain.
In Philip Petrie Clover, '14, the cap
tain, two years of active experience
are combined with an ability to di
rect a winning eight. Clover rowed
in the Poughkeepsie regatta in 1902,
and filled the position of No. 2 in the
boat which glided across the line in
front of California's shell last April.
Seven Juniors are back for their
second year at the oars. The list in
cludes J. S. Jeffers, '15, bow; F. E.
Rehm, '15, No. 3; G. E. Haggart, '15,
No. 4; G. C. Jacomini, '15, No. G; I. M.
Hulsman, '15, No. 7; F. O. Olmstead,
'15, stroke, and L. F. Reineman, '15,
coxswain. Two substitutes, R. R.
Blase ,'l4, and J. C. Branner, '13, must
also be reckoned with.
Last semester's victorious Fresh
man eight possesses several men who
will put up a strong fight for varsity
honors. There seems to be some doubt
as to whether Captain F. N. Worth will
return to college, but C. H. Orme, W
A. Green, C. W. Long, A. J. Oyster, J.
C. Wood, R. G. Hamaker and J. H.
Goodman will, from present indica
tions, report at the boathouse in the
spring.
Owing to the late ending of the
rugby season, and to the holding of
the post-season football series, no
general fall training was indulged in
by the crew candidates, but the men
have been keeping partial training
rules throughout the present semester,
and many individuals have been under
going daily workouts on the rowing
machines.
