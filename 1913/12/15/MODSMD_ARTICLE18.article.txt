# HOLIDAY STRAGGLERS TO TAKE ROLE OF "SANTA"
## 
### 
Students who are planning to spend
their vacation on the campus will be
given a chance to gladden the hearts
of a number of Mayfield children at a
Christmas party to be given during
the holidays.
The children are to write letters
stating their wishes for gifts and an
effort will be made to comply with
their requests. Every one who ex
pects to remain 011 the campus is
asked to take part.
Those in charge are very anxious
to secure several automobiles to
carry the youngsters . Anyone wish
ing to offer their machine may notify
either Miss M. Hunt, local 12G, or
Miss Agnes Taylor, Palo Alto.
