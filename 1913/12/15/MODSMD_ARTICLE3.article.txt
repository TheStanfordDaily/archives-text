# 1915 QUAD IS ALREADY IN WELL DEVELOPED STATE
## EDITOR WORTHY AND HIS STAFF HAVE MUCH MATERIAL Elimination of Chapter Roll Pages to Allow More Space for College Events. 
### 
The ned of the semester finds the
191 •"> Quad in a well developed stage.
Editor A. E. Worthy and his staff of
third year scribes and artists have

most of the avail
able material un
der way. No mat
ter will be set by
the printers, how
ever, until next
semester.
A change that
was suggested at
the time the book
appeared last se
mester is to be

made in the makeup of the coming
Quad. The blank page and the chap
ter roll, which has been a portion of
each fraternity's section of the book,
is to be eliminated. The elimination
of the waste blank pages and the use
of the chapter roll pages for other
matter, gives the editors more space
upon which to record the events of
the college year.
As this change cuts the fraternity
and sorority representations from
four to two pages, reduction has
been made in their assessment. A
standard price for both one and two
pages has been set to apply to all or
ganizations represented.
This change makes for a better and
fuller book. It has been agitated for
some time and the management this
year decided to attempt it, after an
expression of favorable opinion from
many concerned.
A large number of the college or
ganizations have already complied
with the request that pictures be
made ready this semester. The list
of Juniors who have had their pic
tures taken, however, is yet small.
