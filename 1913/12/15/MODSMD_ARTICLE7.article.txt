# CHANCELLOR JORDAN WRITES OF TRAVELS AND SENDS REGARDS
## 
### 
Chancellor Jordan is now lectur
ing in England in the crusade for
peace among the nations. In a de
layed letter dated at Venice, Novem
ber 2, he reviewed the results of a
visit in Germany.
He considers the attitude of the
younger German professors and pub
lic men favorable to the effort for less
armament. With the passing of the
old generation, Chancellor Jordan
writes, Bismarck's idea that the
empire should be held together by be
ing hated by its neighbors is losing
favor. The younger Germans consider
it better to have good neighbors, and
that neighborly friendship is the
cement that holds the world to
gether.
In a recent visit to Montenegro
and Albania he met some adventures,
"mostly pleasant," and is pleased
with the knowledge of local condi
tions that he gained.
Writing just before the time of the
Big Game, Chencellor Jordan ex
plained his neglect in sending a third
monthly report to the campus by de
claring more interest in happenings
at Stanford than in Europe.
