Plans for an extensive addition to
the Lane hospital of the Stanford
Medical school in San Francisco are
now completed except for minor de
tails. As soon as these are deter
mined upon the contract for con
struction wil lbe let. The plans show
that tlie present hospital building fac
ing on Clay street at the corner of
Webster will be extended in front
along Webster street, while a new
wing will extend from this portion
back through the present garden close
to the side of the Medica school build
ing which faces Sacramento street.
The building will be from five to
six stories in height with accommoda

patients. This will nearly double its
present capacity.
A new operating suite, complete
with latest scientific equipment, is

section. There are also X-Ray rooms
and a hydrotheraputic establishment
included in the plans of the new build
ing.
Upon the expansion into the new
department room will be allowed in
wicli to set up a cardiograph. This is
a very important apparatus for the
electrical recording of the heart beat
in studying heart diseases. The card
iograph has already arrived at San
Francisco but will not bo set up until
the erection of the addition.
A special building for the hospital
laundry is also planned. The design
has been settled upon, and actual
construction will commence within a
few days. The new laundry will be
modern and complete. It is situated
in the court between the hospital
buildings and the medical school.
