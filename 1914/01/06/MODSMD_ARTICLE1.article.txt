Diary <o be Used.
Much of the book
will be based on in
formation contained
in the dairy of
Charles Francis
Adams' father, of
the same name,

who was American
minister to England during the Civil
War. This author is the grandson of
John Quincy Adams, and great grand
son of John Adams, two early presi
dents of the United States. Though
Professor E. D. Adams and Charles
Francis Adams are both from early
New England families, and are inter
ested in the same work, they are not

Most of the material that will be
used in the book has been collected.
The parts of the dairy to be used
have been selected, and Professor
Adams has spent a great deal of time
in Washington, studying secret diplo
matic messages which will be dis
closed for the first time. He is also
acquainted with the British side of
the international relations during the
period from 1815 to 1855, leading up
to the Civil War period. This knowl
edge was gained through the permis
sion of the British foreign office to
enter the diplomatic archives.

Professor Adams gave the Yale lec
tures on "The Responsibilities of Cit
izenship" last year. These lectures
have been given in the past by William

Brewer and Hughes of the Supreme
Court, among others. The latest pub
lication by Professor Adams is "The
Power of Ideals in American History,"
printed at Yale University.
During the absence of Professor
Adams, A. M. Kline, a graduate of the
University of Michigan, and professor
of history at the College of the Pacific,
will lecture in history at Stanford.
He will be assisted by Miss Mary Wil
liams, '07, who received a master's
degreee in 1008, and is now studying

C. E. Adams and E. D. Adams Will
Write oil American-English Dela
tions During Period of Our Civil
War.
Professor E. D. Adams, of the His
tory department, left for Washington,
D. C., on January third, to collaborate
with Charles Francis Adams in pre
paring a book which will treat of the
relations between England and the
United States during the American
Civil War. The work will require
seven or eight months. Professor
Adams left for Washington after re-

ceiving ten days
notice. He was ac
companied by Mrs.
Adams.
Diary <o be Used.
Much of the book
will be based on in
formation contained
in the dairy of
Charles Francis
Adams' father, of
the same name,

who was American
minister to England during the Civil
War. This author is the grandson of
John Quincy Adams, and great grand
son of John Adams, two early presi
dents of the United States. Though
Professor E. D. Adams and Charles
Francis Adams are both from early
New England families, and are inter
ested in the same work, they are not
related.
Most of the material that will be
used in the book has been collected.
The parts of the dairy to be used
have been selected, and Professor
Adams has spent a great deal of time
in Washington, studying secret diplo
matic messages which will be dis
closed for the first time. He is also
acquainted with the British side of
the international relations during the
period from 1815 to 1855, leading up
to the Civil War period. This knowl
edge was gained through the permis
sion of the British foreign office to
enter the diplomatic archives.
Gives Famous Lectures.
Professor Adams gave the Yale lec
tures on "The Responsibilities of Cit
izenship" last year. These lectures
have been given in the past by William
Howard Taft, Elihu Root, and Justices
Brewer and Hughes of the Supreme
Court, among others. The latest pub
lication by Professor Adams is "The
Power of Ideals in American History,"
printed at Yale University.
During the absence of Professor
Adams, A. M. Kline, a graduate of the
University of Michigan, and professor
of history at the College of the Pacific,
will lecture in history at Stanford.
He will be assisted by Miss Mary Wil
liams, '07, who received a master's
degreee in 1008, and is now studying
for a doctor of philosophy's degree.
