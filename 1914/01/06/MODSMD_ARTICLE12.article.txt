# Normal Enrollment Includes Athletes New and Returned
## 
### 
Registration was still going on brisk
ly with many waiting in the office to be
enrolled at the time of going to press,
and from present indications the num
ber of students will be about the same
as last semester when 1,737 were en
rolled, although no statistics are yet
obtainable. About 1,350 students had
taken out study cards at half past
three o'clock and this alone almost
equals the registration of the second
semester last year. Approximately a
hundred students registered for grad
uate work yesterday but this number
should be doubled before the end of
registration tonight.
Among those registering is "Jim"
Wylie, middle ranker on both the
Waratah and All-Black teams. Wylie
registers in the Mining department.
His credentials are from one of the
preparatory schools of Auckland. One
of the surprises of the registration
was the return of L. F. Dent, '15, form
er catcher, after a semester's absence.
Word has come up from the south
that F. E. McClure, '15, will probably
also return although he will not re
gister until the end of the week. The
return of the 440-yard man will
counteract ineligibility of W. H.
Whitted, 'IG, holder of the Pacific
Coast high hurdles record.
