## FAVORABLE COMMENT GREETS CLUB ON TOUR Singers Royally Entertained by Stanford Alumni During Course of Trip to the North. 
### 
Twenty-four Cslee club rpau. arrived
on the campus today after completing
their two weeks tour ot the northwest
on which they twetoe concerts
and traveled nearly i#&nty-five hun
dred miles.
The smoothly rendered program
gained favorable newspaper comment
at all points visited. So much im
pressed with the concert was the man
ager of the theater at Aberdeen, Wash
ington, that he telegraphed to Olyni
pia, '"Boost the Stanford Glee Club as
much as you like for they are un
doubtedly the best aggregation of col
lege entertainers on the Coast." To
members of the club he said, "Your
program was received in a more en
thusiastic manner than any simmilar
; program ever before given in this city.
Explaining the

hearty reception of
the Stanford men all
along the line is the
fact that instead of
the customary cut and
dried concert given
Glee clubs, a lively
vaudeville show was
staged.
Beginning the con
cert was the usual
formal program. The
stronger part of the
entertainment came
after the intermission
when was given a
scene in a fraternity
house entitled, "As

We Live and Dress on the Stanford
Farm."

Adding life and humor to the pro
giam were the stunt men who were
enthusiastically received by all audi
ences. They included Shepherdson,
Patten, Paul, Morgan, and Melvin.
The mandolin and ukelele players
of the club gave variety to the pro
gram and were encored without excep
tion. The quartet made a good ap
pearance throughout the trip. Singing
of Stanford songs while slides of the
University were shown on a screen
ended the performance.
Stanford and University clubs in
almost every town made the tour of
the club one round of entertainment.
In Vancouver, B. C., the Stanford
alumni association, consisting of Dr.
F. J. Nicholson, '95, entertained the
club members royally, showing them
about the city in automobiles, treating
them to a skate on ice before the con
cert, and banqueting them in the
evening.
The home concert will be given on
the evening of Saturday, January 17.
The drawing for tickets will be held on
Monday, January 12.
