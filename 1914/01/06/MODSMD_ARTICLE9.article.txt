This issue of The Daily Palo Alto is Number One of Volume Forty
four. On like occasions other journals published in "farm" communities
have made it their custom to "crave the favor" of their readers. Web
ster states that "to crave" means "to beg humbly or submissively." To
do this we have not the faintest stirring of desire, sincerely as we hope
lor the approval and support of the University public.
No important changes in the composition or policy of The Daily
Palo Alto are to be announced at this time. With the beginning of every
new volume the.staff of this publication sincerely longs and labors to
bring about conditions which will make possible an increase in the size
of the paper, only to find when all is said and done that the stone wall
of purely financial limitations remains unsurmounted. Within the small
physical body of The Daily, then, we shall only hope to make felt the
same strong heart-beat of service to the University which has character
ized previous volumes. The Daily will endeavor to gather the news with
energy and to stand constantly loyal to the best interest of Stanford,
remembering always that loyalty may on occasion best be expressed bv
discriminatingly favoring progressive changes rather than by blind and
unquestioning acceptance of the established order.
In outlining this simple creed we have unwittingly stated the virtues
which in the large field of Stanford endeavor have made for success:
these three, loyalty, discrimination, and energy; and—to preach the
pure gospel of Results —the greatest of these is energy. Believing that
cultivation of these qualities will make the desire come true, we express
to Stanford and all its men and women our wish for a Happy New Year.
