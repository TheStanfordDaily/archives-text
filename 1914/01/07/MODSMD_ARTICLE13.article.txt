# APPEARANCES ARE DECEITFUL

The above caption is used by way of optimistic balm to the natrually
ruffled feelings of the Student Body management. At a late hour this
afternoon Graduate Manager Wilcox reports that approximately 700
Student Body tickets have been sold, as contrasted with 1,000 at the cor
responding time last semester. One conclusion possible from this condi
tion is that Stanford men and women are not loyal when it comes to
actual tangible support of student enterprises. Membership in the Asso
ciated Students is not only a duty, but a privilege, imposed upon, and
only upon those financially able to bear it. Realization of duty is not the
smallest lesson to be gleaned along the wayside of a college course.
Another deduction possible from the slack sale is that we do not know,
to use the vernacular, which side our bread is buttered on. The larger
sale last semester is accounted for by the fact that students believed that
they could then buy greater value for their money. The fallacy of this
view is demonstrated by an article in the news columns of this issue.
All this leads to the following syllogism, respectfully dedicated to the
class in logic: Those who are loyal and wise will buy Student Tickets.
We are loyal and wise. We will buy Student I ickcts.
Let's go to it.
