Activity in construction has caused
much new work on the campus. The
organ has been moved from the As
sembly Hall to the church and in all
probability the swell organ will be in
use on Sunday. Later in the year an
echo organ togeher with a concert
harp and cathedral chimes will be in
stalled near the west gallery.
The interior of the new Applied
Mathematics building awaits the
painter and will be completed as soon
as the desks and blackboards arrive
from the East.
Sidewalks connecting the various
buildings at the rear of the Quad
have been completed. Work on the
gutters and subgrade on Salvatierra
street has been finished and the road
stands ready for the surfacing.
Electric lights will be installed on
the roads of the campus as soon as
the ordered equipment arrives. Near
the Quad the lamp standards will
probably be of an ornamental type.
Those on the row will be less elab
orate.
Excavation for the foundation of
the Stanford Union has been com
pleted and forms for the concrete
work are fast being made. The ma
terials for the foundations are all on
hand and work can be started as soon
as the rain stops. During the holi
days rain filled the excavations caus
ing a small Lagunitas. Superintend
ent J. O. Miller, 'OS, drained the works
without damage being done.
Work on the High Voltage labora
tory has been completed and as soon
as the equipment can be moved and set
up and wires run to the building, the
laboratory will be ready for use.
