ment. Farm Superintendent Hewston,
in order to save this shock to the
student body, immediately put every
available man at his command to work
to remedy the damage, doubling the
force on the flume and giving his own
time. The present aspect of Lagunita
is the result of his labors.

uing rains the lake will be completely
