## PROFESSOR WOODWARD RESUMES DEPARTMENT WORK Trip to Balkans With Dr. Jordan Stopped by Cholera Epidemic; Meets Stanford People. 
### 
Professor Frederick Campbell
Woodward, dean of the Law depart
ment, returned to the campus last
Monday after an absence during the
past semester spent in England, Scot
land, and 011 the continent. "It's good
to be returning to the Farm with all
the others," said Professor Woodward
today, "although the entire trip has
been an enjoyable one." It was taken
chiefly as a vacation, though some of
the time in England and France was
spent in studying the legal and judi
cial proceedings of the English and
French systems. In France, where
the fall was spent, Mrs. Woodward
studied the piano. Some time was
also spent in Belgium and Holland.
Professor Woodward saw a great
deal of Chancellor Jordan while on
the trip. At Dr. Jordan's request he
had planned to accompany him to the
Balkans to study the effects of the
war on that territory. With the break
ing out of the cholera there the men
were advised against taking the trip
and in fact would have found it im
possible to go because the railway
companies had ceased to sell tickets
to the stricken district. Professor
Woodward states that the Chancellor
will not visit the Balkans at any time
during his present journey.
While in England he also saw Pro
fessor H. W. Stuart of the Philosophy
department and Mrs. Stuart, and Pro
fessor W. D. Briggs and Instructor
Van Wyck Brooks, both of the English
department. In London he visited at
the home of H. C. Hoover, '95, "Red
Gables" and it was here that he met
some of these Stanford people, and Dr.
and Mrs. Jordan.
During the fall months, which he
spent in Paris, Professor Woodward,
Miss Mary I. McCracken, assistant
professor of Entomology, and Profes
sor C. G. Allen of the Romanic Lan
guages department and Mrs. Allen.
Professor and Mrs. Woodward were
entertained by Miss Florence Hcy
wood, '02, who is a widely known
art critic and art lecturer 011 the con
tinent.
Just after his departure last sum
mer, Professor Woodward's case book
011 sales was published by the West
Publishing company as a part of
American Case Book Series. The
book was finished just before leaving.
The return to America was made
from Cherbourg, France, on an Amer
ican line ship. While in New York,
before taking (train for the West,
Professor Woodward talked with Pro
fessor Hans Zinsser of the Columbia
Medical School, who was formerly in
the faculty of Stanford.
Mrs. Woodward did not return at
the present time. She is visiting her
mother in Evanston, New York, and
will not be home for another month.
