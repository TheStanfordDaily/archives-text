# NEW YEAR'S "CHAPPIE" BRIMS WITH MERRIMENT
## SNAPPY COMIC WILL APPEAR ON "QUAD" TOMORROW The 						Next Issue Will be a "Ragging" Number, is the Announcement of the Editor. 
### 
Brimful of merry quips, lively patter
and sparkling verse, the New Years'
number of "Chappie" will appear on
the Quad tomorrow to wish its read
ers the greetings of the season. Com
plete in jokes and verse, this issue is
filled with the short, snappy material
which befits the holiday time and
which insures "Chappie" an unusually
good start for the New Year.
Three new men have been added to
the staff of the Chaparral and have
been given membership in the Ham
mer and Coffin society. They are F.
S. Murray, '16, whose clever art
work has been a feature of "Chappie"
for some time; H. V. Stewart, '16,
and G. A. Hughes, '16. Both have
been frequent contributors of jokes
and verse.
Davenport Girl Features
The art feature of the New Year's
number faces the front page poem. It
pictures a most attractive girl's head
and is the work of W. R. Davenport,
'04, in wash and crayon. Davenport
is one of the most prominent artists
among Stanford alumni and his work
is always of professional caliber.
Two other full-page drawings
grace this issue. One of the popular
Stanford songs has been illustrated
by F. S. Murray, '16, and a clever
"hunch" drawing, which is guaranteed
for a laugh, is the work of L. Mc-
Dermott, '17.
Apropos of New Years, J. L. Duff,
'13, the retiring art editor, has written
the front-page poem. The Dilettante,
by R. A. Griffin, '17, tells of a New
Years' resolution and how well it was
kept.
Other art work is contributed by .T.
L. Duff, '13, J. Olsen, '15, M. A. Oliver,
'15, R. N. Wenzel, *16, Miss M. Bailey,
'14, L. McDermott, '17, and H.
Ryan, '15.
U N<>Â» Thats" Are Timely
Editor L. D. Summerfield treats
many timely topics in his "Now
That's," some of which were suggested
by the New Year. He writes of things
done during the past semester and, of
things hoped for during the coming
term. He compliments the women
on the Women's Number of "Chap
pie," which they issued at Christmas
time so successfully; discusses the
athletic outlook of the present semes
ter; advocates making tennis a ma
jor sport; and announces the recent
elections to the staff.
