Among the experiences of life we recall not one affording' the
placid pleasure which comes from sitting on the baseball bleachers and
eating peanuts. As materials for a song yet unsung let some aspiring
bard take the warm Santa Clara Valley sun. the smooth diamond, the
green outfield, the darting figures of the players, the immortal peanut,
and the inevitable slivers on the seats. The average baseball game lasts
for one hour and three-quarters, and so, during this semester forty-five
and one-half hours of these varied joys may be enjoyed for the sum of
two dollars. Student body tickets are still obtainable at the Registrar's
office. A word to the wise.
