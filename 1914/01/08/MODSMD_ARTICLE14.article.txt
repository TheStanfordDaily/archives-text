ment. A clipping from the Portland
Oregonian, one of the chief papers of
the northern city follows:
"That the Stanford Glee club, heard
at the Grand theater last night, is the
best aggregation of its kind heard in
several seasons is the verdict given
by the audience, after listening to a
splendid repertoire of college songs
and heavier numbers. The club in
cludes 24 singers of ability, several of
whom have voices out of the ordinary,
and some of whom are 'stunt' men of
no mean ability. Particularly enjoy
able was a song dealing with the var
ious years of the college man. At its
conclusion members of the Stanford
alumni in the audience arose and sang
the alumni verse."
