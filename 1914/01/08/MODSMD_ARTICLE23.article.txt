# Tri-State Debate Question Decided by Universities
## 
### 
"Resolved that the executive depart
ment should he made responsible for
our national budget" is the question
which has been chosen by the Pacific
Coast Debating League i'or the sub
ject of this year's Tri-State debate.
This annual event between University
of Washington, University of Oregon
and Stanford will be held ou Friday,
March 13. On that evening Stanford
will meet Washington in the local As
sembly Hall and Oregon in Olympia,
Ore., the seat of the northern univer
sity.
The above question was submitted
by Oregon and it was finally accepted
when the secretary of the debating
league received the acquiescence
of Washington to this particular form
of the general subject of Cabinet re
sponsibility" which was decided on
some time ago.
This same question or one very sim
ilar to it will be the subject of the
oratorical contest between the Sopho
more and Freshman classes. The date
will be set by the Intersociety Debat
ing Committee at some time before the
Tri-State contest, probably near the
middle of February. The participants
in the class contest will then be given
a chance and can use the same prepa
ration for both.
The date of the tryouts has not yet
been set for either of the debates but
will be made public next week in or
der to give aspirants for places suf
ficient time to prepare for them.
