Squad Will he Divided
In the first game of the season, se>
for January 17, two nines will be used
by Stanford. The large number ol
candidates requires that the squad
should be divided, and in the earlj
games at least two sets of players?
will be sent on the diamond by Cap
tain Terry. The usual order of Wed
nesday and Saturday games through
out the spring will lead to the firs'
intercollegiate game on March 28.
All candidates will be given good
opportunity to show their ability in
the preliminary games. The number
of veterans returned and the quality
of ball served by the new men in fall
parctice indicate that a powerful
nine will represent Stanford this
spring.
