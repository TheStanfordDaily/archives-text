# RALLY IS POSTPONED TO TUESDAY EVENING
## Absence of Halm and Clover from Campus Causes Change From Friday Night. 
### 
Next Tuesday evening will be the
date of the Track, Crew and Baseball
rally. The date has definitely been
changed from Friday, the time origin
ally set for it as it was announced in
yesterday's Daily Palo Alto. This
change was neccessary because of the
inability of Crew Captain P. P. Clover,
'14, to be present tomorrow owing to
his illness, and to the difficulty of pre
paring for the rally by the executive
committee in the absence of President
A. G. Halm, '14, from the campus.
Halm is expected back by the begin
ning of next week.
