# PRE-PANAMA EXPOSITION TO BE HELD JANUARY 31
## Women Promise Many Surprises in Entertainment for the Fair This Spring. 
### 
Plans for the coming Pre-Panama
Exposition were discussed yesterday
afternoon at a meeting of the Cap and
Gown society. The fair will be con
ducted in the Zoology building January
31. It promises to be even a greater
success than that of last year.
The Panama atmosphere will be
effected by means of a wealth of local
color of the canal zone and many novel
features are planned.
Sororities, women's clubs and or
ganizations will all contribute their
share to the gay entertainment and
the women are already busy providing
surprises and original amusements for
all.
