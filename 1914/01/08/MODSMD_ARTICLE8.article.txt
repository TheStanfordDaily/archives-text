# GREAT PROGRESS MADE IN RESTORATION OF MOSAICS
## SIGNOR LORENZO ZAMPATO IS ARTIST IN CHARGE. Parts of Mural Work in Memorial Church Have Already Been Completed. 
### 
Work on the restoration of the mo
saic in the Memorial Church has
made visible progress. The large
mural scene at the back of the pulpit
has been completely renewed. The
upper half Is a large representation
of the "Lord's Supper." In the golden
mosaic beneath is the following in
scription: "Lord's Supper by Cosmo
Rosselli in the Sistine chapel of the
Vatican by order of the Pope Sisto IV.
Delia Revere." Throe smaller pic
tures appear on the wall of the room
portrayed. On these pictures within
the picture are represented the History
of the Passion.
At the time of the earthquake this
part of the mosaic suffered less than
the rest. Although it was somewhat
disfigured and seamed with cracks,
Signor Lorenzo Zampato, the Italian
artist of the original work who is now
engaged in its restoration, has em
ployed chips from the debris of the
former mosaic to restore the decora
tion to all its former beauty.
Ten cases of mosaic blocks have
been received in San Francisco from
the A. Salviati company of Venice.
These are to be put on the walls of
the vestibule at the back of the church
and in the apse. These walls have
been cleared and prepared for the new
mosaic. Probably three months will
be consumed in placing these pieces.
