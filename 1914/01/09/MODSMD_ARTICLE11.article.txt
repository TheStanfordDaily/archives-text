# COLLEGE HONORS VERSUS JOBS

### 
Through every volume of The Daily Palo Alto runs a sorry trail
which marks the course of many limping societies at Stanford. And
the sign by which you may know this trail is the heading "Meeting
Postponed Because of Small Attendance." Xo doubt the number of
clubs and societies in the University is large in proportion to the field
in which they operate. But the remedy is not in the arbitrary elimina
tion of a certain number of organizations. It will rather be found if
those invited to join societies will think before they leap. At this time
of the year various bodies such as debating societies and department
clubs are replenishing their ranks from the Freshman class. Let the
Freshman consider such membership, not as a College Honor, but as
a Job. Let him refuse to join those societies to which he does not feel
able to devote the time and energy which he will be morally bound to
give them. Thus the less deserving organizations will be automatically
determined and will die a natural death. Then—and most important
of all—once having joined his clubs, let the Freshman remember that
he owes them a duty of energy and loyalty, not for a few weeks, but
for the four years or more of his college career. There is no privilege
in this University without a corresponding obligation.
