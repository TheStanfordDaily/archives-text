# IMPORTANT CHANGES ARE MADE AT STANFORD OVAL
## 
### 
Changing the place of the hammer
throw cage, and the partitioning off
of an individual rubbing room in the
training house for the special use of
Trainer Maloney, are the most im
portant changes made at the Stanford
Oval over the vacation.
The cage has been changed from in
side of the circular track to a place
further from the bleachers alongside of
the 220-yard straightaway. The cage
faces away from the bleachers and
gives a much larger amount of ground
for the landing of the hammer with
out going into the track, although it
is now in a less advantageous position
for the onlookers.
In addition to these changes the
cinder path is being partially resur
faced to put it in good shape for the
beginning of practice which will be
next week.
