# SUCCESSFUL CREW SEASON IS ASSURED
## 
### 
Crew training will begin with a
vim on Wednesday afternoon, and
candidates for positions on the Varsity
and Freshman eights will undergo
rigid training until the day of final
competition with the Universities of
Washington and California. The
water in Lake Lagunita is sufficiently
high to allow a wide sweep for the
four-oared barge, the shell, and the
two pairs, which have been repaired
for preliminary practice. There are
three eight-oared shells available for
use at the estuary at Redwood, where
active operations will commence about
the middle of February.
Seven Veterans Return
Prospects are good for an eight that
will not only outdistance the Blue and
Gold craft, but also glide away from
the speedy shell from Washington.
Seven veteran oarsmen have returned
to college, besides Coxswain L. F.
Reinemann, '15. Captain P. P. Clover,
'14, will probably resume his former
position at No. 2, with J. S. Jeffers, '15,
at bow; F. E. Rehm, '15, No. 3; G. E.
Haggart, '15. No. 4; G. A. Jacomini,
'15, No. 6; I. O. Hulsman, '15, No.
7; and F. O. Olnistead, stroke. E. B.
Wolford, '15, who rowed No. 4 on his
Freshman crew and filled a place on
the eight that represented Stanford
in the Poughkeepsie regatta of June,
1912, has also registered this
semester.
F. N. Worth, '16, who captained last
year's successful Freshman eight, C.
11. Orme, '1('», and C. W. Long, '16, as
well as G. C. Branner, '13, and R. R.

Blase, '14, Varsity substitutes, are can
didates who should furnish lively com
petition with the veterans for the
doubtful places on the boat. Several
"dark horses" may also be discovered,
for many new aspirants to honors on
the water are expected to sign up at
the rally Tuesday evening.
Famous Coxswain Will Conch
F. L. Guerena, '11, the veteran cox
swain, has been secured as an ad
visory coach in the absence of a pro
fessional and will act in conjunction
with a coaching committee composed
of Captain Clover, F. 0. Olmstead, G.
A. Jacomini and L. F. Reinemann.
Guerena will personally superintend
the workouts during week-ends, and
his work will be supplemented by the
efforts of F. O. Olmstead, who will
handle the Varsity candidates, and
Captain Clover, who will have charge
of the first year men.
For the first few weeks, work on the
rowing machines, setting-up exercises,
cross country runs, and preliminary
practice on the lake will be indulged
in, as the Freshmen especially will re
quire much instruction before being
competent to row at Redwood.
Abstinence from the use of tobacco
and strong stimulants at present con
stitutes the only training regulation.
Strict rules will not be enforced until
the middle of February.
Captain Clover was released from
the Peninsula hospital yesterday
afternoon and will be able to assume
liis duties on the opening day of prac
tice.

Famous Coxswain Will Conch
F. L. Guerena, '11, the veteran cox
swain, has been secured as an ad
visory coach in the absence of a pro
fessional and will act in conjunction
with a coaching committee composed
of Captain Clover, F. 0. Olmstead, G.
A. Jacomini and L. F. Reinemann.
Guerena will personally superintend
the workouts during week-ends, and
his work will be supplemented by the
efforts of F. O. Olmstead, who will
handle the Varsity candidates, and
Captain Clover, who will have charge
of the first year men.
For the first few weeks, work on the
rowing machines, setting-up exercises,
cross country runs, and preliminary
practice on the lake will be indulged
in, as the Freshmen especially will re
quire much instruction before being
competent to row at Redwood.
Abstinence from the use of tobacco
and strong stimulants at present con
stitutes the only training regulation.
Strict rules will not be enforced until
the middle of February.
Captain Clover was released from
the Peninsula hospital yesterday
afternoon and will be able to assume
liis duties on the opening day of prac
tice.


Crew Captain Clover


Advisory Conch Guerena
Crew training will begin with a
vim on Wednesday afternoon, and
candidates for positions on the Varsity
and Freshman eights will undergo
rigid training until the day of final
competition with the Universities of
Washington and California. The
water in Lake Lagunita is sufficiently
high to allow a wide sweep for the
four-oared barge, the shell, and the
two pairs, which have been repaired
for preliminary practice. There are
three eight-oared shells available for
use at the estuary at Redwood, where
active operations will commence about
the middle of February.
Seven Veterans Return
Prospects are good for an eight that
will not only outdistance the Blue and
Gold craft, but also glide away from
the speedy shell from Washington.
Seven veteran oarsmen have returned
to college, besides Coxswain L. F.
Reinemann, '15. Captain P. P. Clover,
'14, will probably resume his former
position at No. 2, with J. S. Jeffers, '15,
at bow; F. E. Rehm, '15, No. 3; G. E.
