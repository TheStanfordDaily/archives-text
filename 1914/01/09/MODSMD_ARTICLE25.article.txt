# FIRST GLEE CLUB SHOW IS PRAISED BY OREGON PAPER
## 
### 
On the Christmas tour of the North
west, the Glee club concerts were the
subject of much newspaper comment.
A clipping from the Medford Sun, of
Medford, Oregon, where the first con
cert was given, follows:
"Even the college glee clubs are
cabaretized nowadays. The old style
concert has given place to stunt men,
fraternity scenes, rouge and calcium
effects, illustrated songs and all that
sort of thing.
"As a result the modern glee club j
entertainment, such as was presented I
at the Page last night by the Stanford
boys, is far more interesting to the
average non-partisan citizen than was
the college performance of a few years
ago.
"The best part of the entertainment
was the choruses by the Glee club, â€”
for pure melody, rich and satisfying, a
well trained chorus of young men's
voices is hard to equal."
The drawing for tickets to the con
cert in the Assembly Hall will be held
at the Bookstore on Wednesday.
