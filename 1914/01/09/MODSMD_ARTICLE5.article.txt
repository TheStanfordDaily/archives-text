# STANFORD GOLFERS ARE GIVEN FOUR LOVING CUPS
## 
### 
Defeat in the recent golf tourna
ment with California is not wholly
bitter to the four men who represented
Stanford on the links. Four handsome
silver loving cups, suitably engraved
have been presented to the losers by
the Wright & Ditson company. The
four golfers who received the cups are
F. L. Chaffee, '14, K. M. Davis, '16, E.
N. Wright, '10, and L. Sloss, '15.
The gifts are not in the nature of
"booby prizes," but are intended to
make the spirit of competition friend
ly. Manager McLeod of the Burlin
game Country Club suggested the
novel award to Wright & Ditson's rep
resentative.
