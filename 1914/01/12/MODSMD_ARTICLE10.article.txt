# REGULATIONS REVISED FOR ADMISSION OF WOMEN
## TRANSFERS NOT FAVORED OVER OTHER APPLICANTS. Freshman Classes Promise to Show Decided Gain in Number of Women Students. 
### 
Action of unusual importance to the
University and to the women who may
plan to register at Stanford in the
' future was taken by the Academic
Council Friday afternoon, when re
vised regulations governing the ad
mission of women were adopted. The
i changes, in brief, mean the placing
of the "transfer" on the plane of wo
men entering college for the first time,
the limiting of the privilege of regis
tering without formal application to
the graduate students of institutions
of recognized standing, the definite
statement of the right of t ie university
to give preference to candidates of
exceptionally high scholarship, and
the naming of dates for the opening
of numbered lists of applicants for the
fall and spring semesters.
The changes in the regulations for
admission were recommended by the
Executive committee and approved by
the Academic Council to correct sec
tions that seemed to ba working to
the detriment of university women and
especially to the detriment of women
who wish to enroll as freshmen. iiy
omitting a sentence reading "Formal
application is waived in the case of
candidates with full Junior stand
ing," the undergraduate woman stu
dent of other institutions is placed on
i the same footing with high school
l graduates in respect to the right of
registration.

Graduate students will be enabled
as before to enter the university with
out the filing of a formal application,
provided they are graduates of an in
stitution of recognized standing, ex
cept that credentials must be submit
ted not later than August 1"Â», for the
first semester and December 20 for the
second semester.
Under the new regulations, a fee of
ten dollars will be required from all
candidates at the time of the filing
of credentials. If the candidate enters
the university the fee is refunded, or
if the candidate decides not to enter
the university and notifies the regis
trar before July 10 or October 10,
the respective dates of making up tlie
numbered list for the succeeding sem
ester, the fee will be refunded.
Heretofore the rule required that
applications be renewed within ten
months of the dnte of matriculation.
Under the new plan, renewal must be
made v/ithin six months of matricula
tion.
Other sections of the regulations re
garding the admission of women have
not been changed. The revised rules
are in effect after January, 1911.
Women students at the university
have today expressed themselves as
gratified at the action of the faculty.
A petition looking to the same end was
last semester presented to the Aca
demic Council by representatives of
the Women's League.
