# A 						FORWARD STRIDE

"Misunderstanding" is one of the biggest and most pathetic words
on the page of history. Particularly has this been true hi Stanford
history, where misconception as to the intent or result of official action
lias time and again marred progressive moves. Last briday the faculty
of the University took a commendable and necessary step with regard
to the admission requirements for women. Surely the public cannot
misconstrue the evident and potent reasons for this action. Surely not,
we say, vet the capacity of some to misconstrue passeth understanding.
With no idea of selfishly excluding students of other institutions, was
the action taken, but solely with the purpose of taking women as they
first enter upon their University life, in order that, by our system of
"Freshman Training" they may be moulded into loyal Stanford women,
capable of grasping the unique classroom and extra-classroom stand
ards of this University. Experience has shown that the "transfer"
steeped in the atmosphere of another college, cannot become an integral
part of Stanford life. The action will result ultimately in a Wody of
women students of higher scholarship and a body of women alumni of
greater loyalty.
