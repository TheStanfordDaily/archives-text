# TEMPLETON TELLS OF RECEPTION IN NEW ZEALAND PORT
## 
### 
Writing from Wellington, New Zea
land, on December 5, R. R. Temple
ton, '15, tells enthusiastically of the
reception of the American field and
track athletes in the Island Dominion.
According to a newspaper schedule
which Templeton inclosed in his letter
to A. W. Ambrose, *13, the quartet of
athletes took part in a meet at Auck
land last Saturday, and will sail from
that city for Australia on January 1!).
The team of four visiting athletes
and their manager, E. M. Peixotto of
San Francisco, were met by a recep
tion committee outside the heads of
Wellington harbor. Since that time,
Templeton says that cordial welcome
has been extended from all sources.
Athletic, commercial travelers, uni
versity, and other clubs all conferred
honorary membership, and have pro
vided pass keys so that the visitors
might come and go to the club houses
at will.
Templeton writes, "These people
study to please, and are sending a
manager ahead to make all arrange
ments before we get to the next
place." In order to catch the mail
boat, a wireless operator sent Temple
ton's letter out to the steamer as it
lay in the harbor.
