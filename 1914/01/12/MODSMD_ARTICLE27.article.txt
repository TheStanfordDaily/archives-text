# CHAPLAIN ENJOINS SELF CONTROL IN NEW YEAR SERMON
## 
### 
Taking for his text "For their sakes
I consecrate myself," Chaplain D.
Charles Gardner gave a forceful ser
mon in the Memorial church yester
day morning. A hearty welcome to
| the students, new and old, and all
good wishes for the New Year were
his opening words.
In concluding, the Chaplain said:
"Our bodies are sacred. Eating
simple food, exercising, getting suffi
cient sleep,, and other such matters
should be considered as a duty. We
should have self-control along every
line, not only in habit but mentally,
morally, and physically for obvious
reasons. There is no need of being
sanctimonious, however, for there is
nothing quite so displeasing as ob
trusive piety. Exaggerated language
shows a limited vocabulary as well as
lack of refinement. The language of
the male of the species is inclined
to be more forceful than polite. We
should leave santity of mental and
moral nature. To be sacred, sound and
strong, is the task of life. Social
service is no longer a mere name, it
is a vital principle. The man who con
secrates his brain to his business for
the sake of others is sure to succeed.
Health of mind and body, wealth
of character and soul as well as of
purse, this leads to happiness. I3e
come what you ought for your loved
ones, your friends and above all your
self with the words of Christ before
you, "For their sakes I consecrate my
self."
"God is a spirit" was the anthem by
the choir.
