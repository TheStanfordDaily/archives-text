### 
Coaches for track and crew were ap- J

meeting of the executive committee
for the semester. E. P. Campbell, '13,!

team, was made coach for the season

out pay. This will allow him to com
pete in all intercollegiate meets. With
Captain McKee lie will have complete
charge of the squad.

of coach as a volunteer without rcc-

j ompense for his services will both al-i
S low him to again be a point winner [
!in the various intercollegiate meets
of the season, and will also secure his !
j valuable assistance to the squad in J
his offices as coach. Campbell is i
probably the best "allround" runneri

is amply fitted to assume the duties of
coach.
