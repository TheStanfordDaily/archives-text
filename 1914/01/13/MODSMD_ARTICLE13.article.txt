The play is a typical offering from
the pen of J. M. Barrie, one of Eng
land's foremost dramatists. The
action is made all the more gripping
by a pervasive atmosphere of simplic
ity and quiet and reflects in a charm
ing manner the formal and exagger
ated sentiment of the age of Napoleon
in Europe. "Quality Street" is inhab
ited by a select coterie of gossippy old
maids, and the love affairs of Phoebe
Throssel and Valentine Brown fur
nishes numerous appealing incidents,
conducted as it is amid a community
of jealous spinsters. Four acts serve
to bring the comedy to a satisfactory
ending, after a theme of endless com
plications and laughable situations.
The attractiveness of the play ex
ists in the quaintness of setting and
plot and represents a style of pro
duction which has not been attempted
heretofore upon the Stanford stage.
Miss Bullard who has already won
for herself a hearty circle of admirers
by her clever work in dramatics, will
assume the leading role. Miss
Borough is cast for a hardly less im
portant role as Susan Throssel. Val
entine Brown will be impersonated by
L. Clayton, '14, who created such a
favorable impression in the last foot
ball show.
F. L. Mathieu has been secured to
coach the production, and his name
alone is sufficient to insure the suc
cess of the play. Rehearsals start
this afternoon, and the various players
expect to work up to a satisfactory
climax by the evening of February 6.
