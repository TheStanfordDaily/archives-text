bursting forth into a flame of enthusiasm at this evening's rally. For
experiences which are in themselves unique and yet in a deeper sense
typical of Stanford, for events which will always endure as college
memories, for good old get-togethers when all the fellows meet on a
basis of common purpose and common enjoyment, show us the equal of
the rally. We feci no need to urge any individual to attend the rally
this evening. Should he not, his own is the greatest loss of all. Neither
need we urge that a large number "sign up" for the various teams. The
pleasant experiences, good fellowship, and physical development afforded
by Stanford athletics make such "signing up" a privilege. Yet in an
other aspect of the matter there is a duty, resting upon every man with
time and ability, to help us reach our goal of a triple athletic victory
this spring. The semester must see the solution or attempted solution of
many problems touching Student Control, and the closer cooperation of
the various elements of the Stanford family. The first and most import
ant step in this direction must be an active support of representative
Stanford activities —a support so single-hearted as to drive petty per
sonal desires and tribulations from the mind. It is more truly noble to
entertain a longing, for the sake of your University, to give the Berkeley
Bear the Stanford Axe, right in the neck., than it is to entertain a desire
to go off on a "little party" or to tar and feather a scared-to-death Fresh
man.
