# CANDIDATES SIGN UP AT SPRING RALLY
## WILL STRIVE FOR BANNER YEAR 
### 
290 Men »ill Try for Places on Crew,
Baseball, and Track Teams—Can
didates are I'rged by Speakers to
Stav Out All Season.

New Student Coaches, Captains, l)r.
Aligel 1, and Trainer Maloney Ad
dress Large and Enthusiastic Gath
ering Held in Encina llall Last
Evening.
"Come out and stay with it right
through to the end." With this slo
gan ringing in the ears of every
athlete who signed up at the rally last
evening, the spring season of sports
will start this afternoon. Track men
will report at the training house at
4:45 where plans for the coming sea
son will be discussed and the method
of training explained. At the same
time crew men will report at the lake
for work on the rowing machines and
baseball men at the diamond, weather
permitting.
Although the atmosphere was some
what damp on the outside of the En
cina Hall, the enthusiasm which broke
from the packed club room, did not
seem to be in the least affected by the
weather conditions. With nothing but
victory behind during the past season
and extremely bright prospects for the
present one, the pent up spirit of the
men caused 290 to sign up for crew,
baseball and track. Of this number
the crew will have 67 trying out for
the varsity and freshmen eights, base
ball 76, and track 147.
Not for several years has there been
such a wealth of material for the
varsity shell. Seven of the eight oars
men who held positions in the boat
last April, as well as Coxswain Reine
man, have reported for work, together
with six veterans of last season's
Freshman eight. In baseball six of
last year's championship team will
again don togs this spring.
The Stanford band appeared for the
first time in years at the opening rally
of the season and added impetus and
"pep" to the informal gathering. It
was the first rally in twelve years
at which "Dad" Moulton was not on
hand to urge the new men to come
out and to extend a greeting to all the
old athletes. Among the speakers
were Trainer Harry Maloney, Coach
E. P. Campbell, '13, Coach F. L. Guer
na, '1!. Dr. F. Angell, Crew Captain
P. P. Clover, '14, Track Captain P. B.
McKeo, '14, and Baseball Captain r A.
F. Terry, '14. The essence of all the
talks was the fact that all men phys
ically able should sign up for some
sport, and not only sign up, but stay
out during the season. A special ap
peal was made to the Freshmen with
the result that 57 signed for track, 43
for crew and 2S for baseball.
This will be a banner year in track
if we do our work." said Track Coach
Campbell. "The only way to make it
a banner year is to sign up and stay
out. The system of coaching will be
similar to that in vogue last year.
Assistant coaches will help in getting
a line on the new men and give indi
vidual attention to all who go out. 23
points were won by Freshmen in the
Intercollegiate meet last year, and
20 points by men who had never put
on a spike before coming to Stanford.
These men who came out with a de
termination to make good and work
hard.
"Husky" Guerena referred to the
trip to the Poughkeepsie regatta in
1912, showing that the Stanford men
have always been a group of fighters.
"The facilities are better than ever be
fore. A crew man goes out year after
year because be loves the sport. We
have a captain and leader that can't
be beat as an oarsman. More tban
facilities, more than a leader, more
than a crew, more than one that can
row, we want one that can fight. Bet
ter than a victory in crew alone, which
we have reason to hope for, we want
a clean sweep down the line, and 1
believe we are going to have it."
Dr. Angell said in part: "The stu
dents have done wisely in selecting
as good a man as Campbell to succeed
as good a man as Moulton. As re
gards baseball, 1 can give no advice
with such a capable man as captain
of the championship team as their own
coach. Best teams in early years of
Stanford history were run by cap
tains." In speaking of rowing, Dr.
Angell brought out the argument that
what makes the prestige and support
of a sport is not the financial back
ing but the spirit manifested by the
participants in the sports.
In the opening speech of the even
ing, Trainer Harry Maloney struck
the keynote of the rally when he said
that it was the desire of nil to make
this a banner year in athletics at Stan
ford. Continuing , Maloney said, "We
had in Encina Hall last semester the
most enthusiastic rally in the history
of the university. The result was a
victory in the Big Game due in a mea
sure to the number of men who re
mained out the whole season. After
looking over this crowd, I am sure a
record crowd will sign up tonight.
Each man owes it to himself as well
as to the university to go out for
some sport, if he is physically able.
Exercise is essential to good health,
good health to a healthy mind, a
healthy mind to good scholarship, and
good scholarship to whether you stay

in college. Get behind your captains
and their assistants and above all be
loyal to them."
The three captains in their talks
urged the men to come out, in great
numbers and with a determination t
make good.

New Student Coaches, Captains, l)r.
Aligel 1, and Trainer Maloney Ad
dress Large and Enthusiastic Gath
ering Held in Encina llall Last
Evening.
"Come out and stay with it right
through to the end." With this slo
gan ringing in the ears of every
athlete who signed up at the rally last
evening, the spring season of sports
will start this afternoon. Track men
will report at the training house at
4:45 where plans for the coming sea
son will be discussed and the method
of training explained. At the same
time crew men will report at the lake
for work on the rowing machines and
baseball men at the diamond, weather
permitting.
Although the atmosphere was some
what damp on the outside of the En
cina Hall, the enthusiasm which broke
from the packed club room, did not
seem to be in the least affected by the
weather conditions. With nothing but
victory behind during the past season
and extremely bright prospects for the
present one, the pent up spirit of the
men caused 290 to sign up for crew,
baseball and track. Of this number
the crew will have 67 trying out for
the varsity and freshmen eights, base
ball 76, and track 147.
Not for several years has there been
such a wealth of material for the
varsity shell. Seven of the eight oars
men who held positions in the boat
last April, as well as Coxswain Reine
man, have reported for work, together
with six veterans of last season's
Freshman eight. In baseball six of
last year's championship team will
again don togs this spring.
The Stanford band appeared for the
first time in years at the opening rally
of the season and added impetus and
"pep" to the informal gathering. It
was the first rally in twelve years
at which "Dad" Moulton was not on
hand to urge the new men to come
out and to extend a greeting to all the
old athletes. Among the speakers
were Trainer Harry Maloney, Coach
E. P. Campbell, '13, Coach F. L. Guer
na, '1!. Dr. F. Angell, Crew Captain
P. P. Clover, '14, Track Captain P. B.
McKeo, '14, and Baseball Captain r A.
F. Terry, '14. The essence of all the
talks was the fact that all men phys
ically able should sign up for some
sport, and not only sign up, but stay
out during the season. A special ap
peal was made to the Freshmen with
the result that 57 signed for track, 43
for crew and 2S for baseball.
This will be a banner year in track
if we do our work." said Track Coach
Campbell. "The only way to make it
a banner year is to sign up and stay
out. The system of coaching will be
similar to that in vogue last year.
Assistant coaches will help in getting
a line on the new men and give indi
vidual attention to all who go out. 23
points were won by Freshmen in the
Intercollegiate meet last year, and
20 points by men who had never put
on a spike before coming to Stanford.
These men who came out with a de
termination to make good and work
hard.
"Husky" Guerena referred to the
trip to the Poughkeepsie regatta in
1912, showing that the Stanford men
have always been a group of fighters.
"The facilities are better than ever be
fore. A crew man goes out year after
year because be loves the sport. We
have a captain and leader that can't
be beat as an oarsman. More tban
facilities, more than a leader, more
than a crew, more than one that can
row, we want one that can fight. Bet
ter than a victory in crew alone, which
we have reason to hope for, we want
a clean sweep down the line, and 1
believe we are going to have it."
Dr. Angell said in part: "The stu
dents have done wisely in selecting
as good a man as Campbell to succeed
as good a man as Moulton. As re
gards baseball, 1 can give no advice
with such a capable man as captain
of the championship team as their own
coach. Best teams in early years of
Stanford history were run by cap
tains." In speaking of rowing, Dr.
Angell brought out the argument that
what makes the prestige and support
of a sport is not the financial back
ing but the spirit manifested by the
participants in the sports.
In the opening speech of the even
ing, Trainer Harry Maloney struck
the keynote of the rally when he said
that it was the desire of nil to make
this a banner year in athletics at Stan
ford. Continuing , Maloney said, "We
had in Encina Hall last semester the
most enthusiastic rally in the history
of the university. The result was a
victory in the Big Game due in a mea
sure to the number of men who re
mained out the whole season. After
looking over this crowd, I am sure a
record crowd will sign up tonight.
Each man owes it to himself as well
as to the university to go out for
some sport, if he is physically able.
Exercise is essential to good health,
good health to a healthy mind, a
healthy mind to good scholarship, and
good scholarship to whether you stay

in college. Get behind your captains
and their assistants and above all be
loyal to them."
The three captains in their talks
urged the men to come out, in great
numbers and with a determination t
make good.

"Come out and stay with it right
through to the end." With this slo
gan ringing in the ears of every
athlete who signed up at the rally last
evening, the spring season of sports
will start this afternoon. Track men
will report at the training house at
4:45 where plans for the coming sea
son will be discussed and the method
of training explained. At the same
time crew men will report at the lake
for work on the rowing machines and
baseball men at the diamond, weather
permitting.
Although the atmosphere was some
what damp on the outside of the En
cina Hall, the enthusiasm which broke
from the packed club room, did not
seem to be in the least affected by the
weather conditions. With nothing but
victory behind during the past season
and extremely bright prospects for the
present one, the pent up spirit of the
men caused 290 to sign up for crew,
baseball and track. Of this number
the crew will have 67 trying out for
the varsity and freshmen eights, base
ball 76, and track 147.
Not for several years has there been
such a wealth of material for the
varsity shell. Seven of the eight oars
men who held positions in the boat
last April, as well as Coxswain Reine
man, have reported for work, together
with six veterans of last season's
Freshman eight. In baseball six of
last year's championship team will
again don togs this spring.
The Stanford band appeared for the
first time in years at the opening rally
of the season and added impetus and
"pep" to the informal gathering. It
was the first rally in twelve years
at which "Dad" Moulton was not on
hand to urge the new men to come
out and to extend a greeting to all the
old athletes. Among the speakers
were Trainer Harry Maloney, Coach
E. P. Campbell, '13, Coach F. L. Guer
na, '1!. Dr. F. Angell, Crew Captain
P. P. Clover, '14, Track Captain P. B.
McKeo, '14, and Baseball Captain r A.
F. Terry, '14. The essence of all the
talks was the fact that all men phys
ically able should sign up for some
sport, and not only sign up, but stay
out during the season. A special ap
peal was made to the Freshmen with
the result that 57 signed for track, 43
for crew and 2S for baseball.
This will be a banner year in track
if we do our work." said Track Coach
Campbell. "The only way to make it
a banner year is to sign up and stay
out. The system of coaching will be
similar to that in vogue last year.
Assistant coaches will help in getting
a line on the new men and give indi
vidual attention to all who go out. 23
points were won by Freshmen in the
Intercollegiate meet last year, and
20 points by men who had never put
on a spike before coming to Stanford.
These men who came out with a de
termination to make good and work
hard.
"Husky" Guerena referred to the
trip to the Poughkeepsie regatta in
1912, showing that the Stanford men
have always been a group of fighters.
"The facilities are better than ever be
fore. A crew man goes out year after
year because be loves the sport. We
have a captain and leader that can't
be beat as an oarsman. More tban
facilities, more than a leader, more
than a crew, more than one that can
row, we want one that can fight. Bet
ter than a victory in crew alone, which
we have reason to hope for, we want
a clean sweep down the line, and 1
believe we are going to have it."
Dr. Angell said in part: "The stu
dents have done wisely in selecting
as good a man as Campbell to succeed
as good a man as Moulton. As re
gards baseball, 1 can give no advice
with such a capable man as captain
of the championship team as their own
coach. Best teams in early years of
Stanford history were run by cap
tains." In speaking of rowing, Dr.
Angell brought out the argument that
what makes the prestige and support
of a sport is not the financial back
ing but the spirit manifested by the
participants in the sports.
In the opening speech of the even
ing, Trainer Harry Maloney struck
the keynote of the rally when he said
that it was the desire of nil to make
this a banner year in athletics at Stan
ford. Continuing , Maloney said, "We
had in Encina Hall last semester the
most enthusiastic rally in the history
of the university. The result was a
victory in the Big Game due in a mea
sure to the number of men who re
mained out the whole season. After
looking over this crowd, I am sure a
record crowd will sign up tonight.
Each man owes it to himself as well
as to the university to go out for
some sport, if he is physically able.
Exercise is essential to good health,
good health to a healthy mind, a
healthy mind to good scholarship, and
good scholarship to whether you stay

in college. Get behind your captains
and their assistants and above all be
loyal to them."
The three captains in their talks
urged the men to come out, in great
numbers and with a determination t
make good.

will report at the training house at
4:45 where plans for the coming sea
son will be discussed and the method
of training explained. At the same
time crew men will report at the lake
for work on the rowing machines and
baseball men at the diamond, weather
permitting.
Although the atmosphere was some
what damp on the outside of the En
cina Hall, the enthusiasm which broke
from the packed club room, did not
seem to be in the least affected by the
weather conditions. With nothing but
victory behind during the past season
and extremely bright prospects for the
present one, the pent up spirit of the
men caused 290 to sign up for crew,
baseball and track. Of this number
the crew will have 67 trying out for
the varsity and freshmen eights, base
ball 76, and track 147.
Not for several years has there been
such a wealth of material for the
varsity shell. Seven of the eight oars
men who held positions in the boat
last April, as well as Coxswain Reine
man, have reported for work, together
with six veterans of last season's
Freshman eight. In baseball six of
last year's championship team will
again don togs this spring.
The Stanford band appeared for the
first time in years at the opening rally
of the season and added impetus and
"pep" to the informal gathering. It
was the first rally in twelve years
at which "Dad" Moulton was not on
hand to urge the new men to come
out and to extend a greeting to all the
old athletes. Among the speakers
were Trainer Harry Maloney, Coach
E. P. Campbell, '13, Coach F. L. Guer
na, '1!. Dr. F. Angell, Crew Captain
P. P. Clover, '14, Track Captain P. B.
McKeo, '14, and Baseball Captain r A.
F. Terry, '14. The essence of all the
talks was the fact that all men phys
ically able should sign up for some
sport, and not only sign up, but stay
out during the season. A special ap
peal was made to the Freshmen with
the result that 57 signed for track, 43
for crew and 2S for baseball.
This will be a banner year in track
if we do our work." said Track Coach
Campbell. "The only way to make it
a banner year is to sign up and stay
out. The system of coaching will be
similar to that in vogue last year.
Assistant coaches will help in getting
a line on the new men and give indi
vidual attention to all who go out. 23
points were won by Freshmen in the
Intercollegiate meet last year, and
20 points by men who had never put
on a spike before coming to Stanford.
These men who came out with a de
termination to make good and work
hard.
"Husky" Guerena referred to the
trip to the Poughkeepsie regatta in
1912, showing that the Stanford men
have always been a group of fighters.
"The facilities are better than ever be
fore. A crew man goes out year after
year because be loves the sport. We
have a captain and leader that can't
be beat as an oarsman. More tban
facilities, more than a leader, more
than a crew, more than one that can
row, we want one that can fight. Bet
ter than a victory in crew alone, which
we have reason to hope for, we want
a clean sweep down the line, and 1
believe we are going to have it."
Dr. Angell said in part: "The stu
dents have done wisely in selecting
as good a man as Campbell to succeed
as good a man as Moulton. As re
gards baseball, 1 can give no advice
with such a capable man as captain
of the championship team as their own
coach. Best teams in early years of
Stanford history were run by cap
tains." In speaking of rowing, Dr.
Angell brought out the argument that
what makes the prestige and support
of a sport is not the financial back
ing but the spirit manifested by the
participants in the sports.
In the opening speech of the even
ing, Trainer Harry Maloney struck
the keynote of the rally when he said
that it was the desire of nil to make
this a banner year in athletics at Stan
ford. Continuing , Maloney said, "We
had in Encina Hall last semester the
most enthusiastic rally in the history
of the university. The result was a
victory in the Big Game due in a mea
sure to the number of men who re
mained out the whole season. After
looking over this crowd, I am sure a
record crowd will sign up tonight.
Each man owes it to himself as well
as to the university to go out for
some sport, if he is physically able.
Exercise is essential to good health,
good health to a healthy mind, a
healthy mind to good scholarship, and
good scholarship to whether you stay

in college. Get behind your captains
and their assistants and above all be
loyal to them."
The three captains in their talks
urged the men to come out, in great
numbers and with a determination t
make good.

for work on the rowing machines and
baseball men at the diamond, weather
permitting.
Although the atmosphere was some
what damp on the outside of the En
cina Hall, the enthusiasm which broke
from the packed club room, did not
seem to be in the least affected by the
weather conditions. With nothing but
victory behind during the past season
and extremely bright prospects for the
present one, the pent up spirit of the
men caused 290 to sign up for crew,
baseball and track. Of this number
the crew will have 67 trying out for
the varsity and freshmen eights, base
ball 76, and track 147.
Not for several years has there been
such a wealth of material for the
varsity shell. Seven of the eight oars
men who held positions in the boat
last April, as well as Coxswain Reine
man, have reported for work, together
with six veterans of last season's
Freshman eight. In baseball six of
last year's championship team will
again don togs this spring.
The Stanford band appeared for the
first time in years at the opening rally
of the season and added impetus and
"pep" to the informal gathering. It
was the first rally in twelve years
at which "Dad" Moulton was not on
hand to urge the new men to come
out and to extend a greeting to all the
old athletes. Among the speakers
were Trainer Harry Maloney, Coach
E. P. Campbell, '13, Coach F. L. Guer
na, '1!. Dr. F. Angell, Crew Captain
P. P. Clover, '14, Track Captain P. B.
McKeo, '14, and Baseball Captain r A.
F. Terry, '14. The essence of all the
talks was the fact that all men phys
ically able should sign up for some
sport, and not only sign up, but stay
out during the season. A special ap
peal was made to the Freshmen with
the result that 57 signed for track, 43
for crew and 2S for baseball.
This will be a banner year in track
if we do our work." said Track Coach
Campbell. "The only way to make it
a banner year is to sign up and stay
out. The system of coaching will be
similar to that in vogue last year.
Assistant coaches will help in getting
a line on the new men and give indi
vidual attention to all who go out. 23
points were won by Freshmen in the
Intercollegiate meet last year, and
20 points by men who had never put
on a spike before coming to Stanford.
These men who came out with a de
termination to make good and work
hard.
"Husky" Guerena referred to the
trip to the Poughkeepsie regatta in
1912, showing that the Stanford men
have always been a group of fighters.
"The facilities are better than ever be
fore. A crew man goes out year after
year because be loves the sport. We
have a captain and leader that can't
be beat as an oarsman. More tban
facilities, more than a leader, more
than a crew, more than one that can
row, we want one that can fight. Bet
ter than a victory in crew alone, which
we have reason to hope for, we want
a clean sweep down the line, and 1
believe we are going to have it."
Dr. Angell said in part: "The stu
dents have done wisely in selecting
as good a man as Campbell to succeed
as good a man as Moulton. As re
gards baseball, 1 can give no advice
with such a capable man as captain
of the championship team as their own
coach. Best teams in early years of
Stanford history were run by cap
tains." In speaking of rowing, Dr.
Angell brought out the argument that
what makes the prestige and support
of a sport is not the financial back
ing but the spirit manifested by the
participants in the sports.
In the opening speech of the even
ing, Trainer Harry Maloney struck
the keynote of the rally when he said
that it was the desire of nil to make
this a banner year in athletics at Stan
ford. Continuing , Maloney said, "We
had in Encina Hall last semester the
most enthusiastic rally in the history
of the university. The result was a
victory in the Big Game due in a mea
sure to the number of men who re
mained out the whole season. After
looking over this crowd, I am sure a
record crowd will sign up tonight.
Each man owes it to himself as well
as to the university to go out for
some sport, if he is physically able.
Exercise is essential to good health,
good health to a healthy mind, a
healthy mind to good scholarship, and
good scholarship to whether you stay

in college. Get behind your captains
and their assistants and above all be
loyal to them."
The three captains in their talks
urged the men to come out, in great
numbers and with a determination t
make good.

"Come out and stay with it right

athlete who signed up at the rally last

will start this afternoon. Track men
will report at the training house at

son will be discussed and the method
of training explained. At the same

from the packed club room, did not
seem to be in the least affected by the
weather conditions. With nothing but
victory behind during the past season
and extremely bright prospects for the
present one, the pent up spirit of the
men caused 290 to sign up for crew,
baseball and track. Of this number
the crew will have 67 trying out for
the varsity and freshmen eights, base
ball 76, and track 147.
Not for several years has there been
such a wealth of material for the
varsity shell. Seven of the eight oars
men who held positions in the boat
last April, as well as Coxswain Reine
man, have reported for work, together
with six veterans of last season's
Freshman eight. In baseball six of
last year's championship team will
again don togs this spring.
The Stanford band appeared for the
first time in years at the opening rally
of the season and added impetus and
"pep" to the informal gathering. It
was the first rally in twelve years
at which "Dad" Moulton was not on
hand to urge the new men to come
out and to extend a greeting to all the
old athletes. Among the speakers
were Trainer Harry Maloney, Coach
E. P. Campbell, '13, Coach F. L. Guer
na, '1!. Dr. F. Angell, Crew Captain
P. P. Clover, '14, Track Captain P. B.
McKeo, '14, and Baseball Captain r A.
F. Terry, '14. The essence of all the
talks was the fact that all men phys
ically able should sign up for some
sport, and not only sign up, but stay
out during the season. A special ap
peal was made to the Freshmen with
the result that 57 signed for track, 43
for crew and 2S for baseball.
This will be a banner year in track
if we do our work." said Track Coach
Campbell. "The only way to make it
a banner year is to sign up and stay
out. The system of coaching will be
similar to that in vogue last year.
Assistant coaches will help in getting
a line on the new men and give indi
vidual attention to all who go out. 23
points were won by Freshmen in the
Intercollegiate meet last year, and
20 points by men who had never put
on a spike before coming to Stanford.
These men who came out with a de
termination to make good and work
hard.
"Husky" Guerena referred to the
trip to the Poughkeepsie regatta in
1912, showing that the Stanford men
have always been a group of fighters.
"The facilities are better than ever be
fore. A crew man goes out year after
year because be loves the sport. We
have a captain and leader that can't
be beat as an oarsman. More tban
facilities, more than a leader, more
than a crew, more than one that can
row, we want one that can fight. Bet
ter than a victory in crew alone, which
we have reason to hope for, we want
a clean sweep down the line, and 1
believe we are going to have it."
Dr. Angell said in part: "The stu
dents have done wisely in selecting
as good a man as Campbell to succeed
as good a man as Moulton. As re
gards baseball, 1 can give no advice
with such a capable man as captain
of the championship team as their own
coach. Best teams in early years of
Stanford history were run by cap
tains." In speaking of rowing, Dr.
Angell brought out the argument that
what makes the prestige and support
of a sport is not the financial back
ing but the spirit manifested by the
participants in the sports.
In the opening speech of the even
ing, Trainer Harry Maloney struck
the keynote of the rally when he said
that it was the desire of nil to make
this a banner year in athletics at Stan
ford. Continuing , Maloney said, "We
had in Encina Hall last semester the
most enthusiastic rally in the history
of the university. The result was a
victory in the Big Game due in a mea
sure to the number of men who re
mained out the whole season. After
looking over this crowd, I am sure a
record crowd will sign up tonight.
Each man owes it to himself as well
as to the university to go out for
some sport, if he is physically able.
Exercise is essential to good health,
good health to a healthy mind, a
healthy mind to good scholarship, and
good scholarship to whether you stay

in college. Get behind your captains
and their assistants and above all be
loyal to them."
The three captains in their talks
urged the men to come out, in great
numbers and with a determination t
make good.

Evening.
"Come out and stay with it right
through to the end." With this slo
gan ringing in the ears of every
athlete who signed up at the rally last
evening, the spring season of sports
will start this afternoon. Track men
will report at the training house at
4:45 where plans for the coming sea
son will be discussed and the method
of training explained. At the same
time crew men will report at the lake
for work on the rowing machines and
baseball men at the diamond, weather
permitting.

present one, the pent up spirit of the
men caused 290 to sign up for crew,
baseball and track. Of this number
the crew will have 67 trying out for
the varsity and freshmen eights, base
ball 76, and track 147.
Not for several years has there been
such a wealth of material for the
varsity shell. Seven of the eight oars
men who held positions in the boat
last April, as well as Coxswain Reine
man, have reported for work, together
with six veterans of last season's
Freshman eight. In baseball six of
last year's championship team will
again don togs this spring.
The Stanford band appeared for the
first time in years at the opening rally
of the season and added impetus and
"pep" to the informal gathering. It
was the first rally in twelve years
at which "Dad" Moulton was not on
hand to urge the new men to come
out and to extend a greeting to all the
old athletes. Among the speakers
were Trainer Harry Maloney, Coach
E. P. Campbell, '13, Coach F. L. Guer
na, '1!. Dr. F. Angell, Crew Captain
P. P. Clover, '14, Track Captain P. B.
McKeo, '14, and Baseball Captain r A.
F. Terry, '14. The essence of all the
talks was the fact that all men phys
ically able should sign up for some
sport, and not only sign up, but stay
out during the season. A special ap
peal was made to the Freshmen with
the result that 57 signed for track, 43
for crew and 2S for baseball.
This will be a banner year in track
if we do our work." said Track Coach
Campbell. "The only way to make it
a banner year is to sign up and stay
out. The system of coaching will be
similar to that in vogue last year.
Assistant coaches will help in getting
a line on the new men and give indi
vidual attention to all who go out. 23
points were won by Freshmen in the
Intercollegiate meet last year, and
20 points by men who had never put
on a spike before coming to Stanford.
These men who came out with a de
termination to make good and work
hard.
"Husky" Guerena referred to the
trip to the Poughkeepsie regatta in
1912, showing that the Stanford men
have always been a group of fighters.
"The facilities are better than ever be
fore. A crew man goes out year after
year because be loves the sport. We
have a captain and leader that can't
be beat as an oarsman. More tban
facilities, more than a leader, more
than a crew, more than one that can
row, we want one that can fight. Bet
ter than a victory in crew alone, which
we have reason to hope for, we want
a clean sweep down the line, and 1
believe we are going to have it."
Dr. Angell said in part: "The stu
dents have done wisely in selecting
as good a man as Campbell to succeed
as good a man as Moulton. As re
gards baseball, 1 can give no advice
with such a capable man as captain
of the championship team as their own
coach. Best teams in early years of
Stanford history were run by cap
tains." In speaking of rowing, Dr.
Angell brought out the argument that
what makes the prestige and support
of a sport is not the financial back
ing but the spirit manifested by the
participants in the sports.
In the opening speech of the even
ing, Trainer Harry Maloney struck
the keynote of the rally when he said
that it was the desire of nil to make
this a banner year in athletics at Stan
ford. Continuing , Maloney said, "We
had in Encina Hall last semester the
most enthusiastic rally in the history
of the university. The result was a
victory in the Big Game due in a mea
sure to the number of men who re
mained out the whole season. After
looking over this crowd, I am sure a
record crowd will sign up tonight.
Each man owes it to himself as well
as to the university to go out for
some sport, if he is physically able.
Exercise is essential to good health,
good health to a healthy mind, a
healthy mind to good scholarship, and
good scholarship to whether you stay

in college. Get behind your captains
and their assistants and above all be
loyal to them."
The three captains in their talks
urged the men to come out, in great
numbers and with a determination t
make good.
