dress Large and Enthusiastic Gath
ering Held in Encina llall Last
Evening.
"Come out and stay with it right
through to the end." With this slo
gan ringing in the ears of every
athlete who signed up at the rally last
evening, the spring season of sports
will start this afternoon. Track men
will report at the training house at
4:45 where plans for the coming sea
son will be discussed and the method
of training explained. At the same
time crew men will report at the lake
for work on the rowing machines and
baseball men at the diamond, weather
permitting.
Although the atmosphere was some
what damp on the outside of the En
cina Hall, the enthusiasm which broke
from the packed club room, did not
seem to be in the least affected by the
weather conditions. With nothing but
victory behind during the past season
and extremely bright prospects for the
present one, the pent up spirit of the
men caused 290 to sign up for crew,
baseball and track. Of this number
the crew will have 67 trying out for
the varsity and freshmen eights, base
ball 76, and track 147.
Not for several years has there been
such a wealth of material for the
varsity shell. Seven of the eight oars
men who held positions in the boat
last April, as well as Coxswain Reine

Freshman eight. In baseball six of
last year's championship team will
again don togs this spring.
The Stanford band appeared for the
first time in years at the opening rally
of the season and added impetus and
"pep" to the informal gathering. It
was the first rally in twelve years
at which "Dad" Moulton was not on
hand to urge the new men to come
out and to extend a greeting to all the
old athletes. Among the speakers
were Trainer Harry Maloney, Coach
E. P. Campbell, '13, Coach F. L. Guer
na, '1!. Dr. F. Angell, Crew Captain
P. P. Clover, '14, Track Captain P. B.
McKeo, '14, and Baseball Captain r A.
F. Terry, '14. The essence of all the
talks was the fact that all men phys
ically able should sign up for some
sport, and not only sign up, but stay
out during the season. A special ap
peal was made to the Freshmen with
the result that 57 signed for track, 43
for crew and 2S for baseball.
This will be a banner year in track
if we do our work." said Track Coach
Campbell. "The only way to make it
a banner year is to sign up and stay
out. The system of coaching will be
similar to that in vogue last year.
Assistant coaches will help in getting
a line on the new men and give indi
