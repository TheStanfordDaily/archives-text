# FOREWARNED, FOREARMED

The Daily Palo Alto cannot presume to state a code for the conduct
of Stanford students, or to lay down tests upon the basis of which those
charged with the judicial functions of Student Control may determine the
cases brought before them. Any such statement must perforce bear the
coloring of individual opinion. Having at the outset made this confes
sion, we wish to present certain propositions which seem to us but the
exposition of the obvious.
The men of Stanford at times engage in certain harmless but de
cidedly primitive forms of amusement. 1 hese rough and tumble activ
ities are important elements in the sum total of the joy and color of
university life. With due deference to such sewing-circle philosophers
as would place the college man's sports on the plane of their own
emasculated pleasures, we submit that the Stanford man's love for his
Alma Mater would be subtly diminished should he be deprived of the
immemorial privilege of "stacking" his neighbor's room.
Yet somewhere a line must be drawn. The body of fair-minded
men of this university would consider themselves as deserving of dis
ciplinary action should they be guilty of any of the following classes
of acts. (i) Acts tending to bring disgrace upon the name of Stanford
before the outside world. (2) Acts entailing a reasonable possibility
of injury to the life or health of another. (3) Acts tending to embarass
the women of the university. (4) Acts expressly prohibited by the
Board of Trustees of this university.
In regard to acts falling under the fourth head, it is clear that the
officials of Student Government have no discretionary power. One
custom so prohibited is the hazing of freshmen. The only question in
this connection is as to what constitutes hazing. An invaluable feature
of Stanford life is our "Freshman Training," by which the cardinal
principles of right living are impressed upon the members of the young
est class by picturesque methods. This we believe should not be de
nominated "hazing." On the other hand, when these means of cor
rection are disgraceful, vulgar or dangerous to life or limb, or when
they are undertaken merely for amusement and not for needed correc
tion, they become in the fairest interpretation of the word "hazing," and
the Student Council is bound automatically to act. To secure a general
understanding of this simple point is the object if this editorial. "For
warned is forearmed."
