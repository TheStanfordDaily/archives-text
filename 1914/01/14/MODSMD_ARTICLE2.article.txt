# LAGUNITA WATERS THREATEN LEVEES BECAUSE OF RAINS
## 
### 
Lagunita is rising rapidly toward
the point of overflow in spite of pre
cautions that have been taken by J. E.
Hewston, the general superintendent.
The heavy storm that poured its water
into the lake and on the surrounding
hills during last night and this morn
ing has raised the high water mark to
within a few feet of the main outlet
pipe. If the top of the drain in front
of the boathouse is reached, the cam
pus will be threatened with flood
water.
When the heavy rains of the past
three weeks caused an unusual flow
of water at the San Francisquito dam,
Hewston arranged to check the
inlet to Lagunita. He has now closed
the flume and ditch which feed from
the dam, the natural source of the
lake's supply.
Small torrents that continue to
flow down the gullies from the satur
ated hills, and underground veins are
the remaining source of danger.
There is no way to check these inlets.
The season's rainfall has been 13.G3
inches to date. The fall during the
last twenty-four hours was .72 inches.
In case the heavy rainfall continues,
Hewston will have recourse to a drain
valve near the outlet ditch at the west
end of the lake. The use of this valvo
has seldom been needed. Further
measures to prevent the levees from
being overflowed will be to cut a
sluice. The drainage water would in
that case run along the regular route
to San Francisquito creek, near the
Stanford residence.
