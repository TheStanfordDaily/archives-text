Rain or shine, active training will
start on the track oval tomorrow
afternoon and continue every day, no
matter what the climatic conditions
are. This was the order given to th'i
men yesterday afternoon by Captain
P. B. McKee, '14. No active work was
engaged in yesterday, but the men
were instructed as to what is ex
pected of them and the committee
system of coaching was explained.
Trainer Harry Maloney will have
charge of the inside work and con
ditioning of the men, while Coach E
P. Campbell, '13, will devote his en
tire attention to the men on the track
and in the oval. He will be assisted
by a committee of varsity "S" men,
who will supervise the athletics in
individual events and assist them in
every way possible. This committee
consists of R. W. Brown, '13, sprints;
R. L. Murray, '13, and E. M. Bonnett,
'15, half mile; P. R. Wilson, '16, mile;
F. L. Foster, '13, and .T. B. Cox, '14,

ley, '12, weights, assisted by G. Be

Tufts, '16, pole vault.
One vital point was emphasized by
the captain and the coach in discus
sing what was expected of the men.
"If this year is to be successful and
we are to get pleasure out of our
woiÂ»k there must be absolute harmony
in the daily training. If any one has
any "crabbing" to do, don't noise it
about the university, but come to one
of us and we will try to straighten
things out. Above all, let us have a
mutual feeling of friendship."
No training rules will go into ef
fect for several weeks, but the dis
tance men have been requested to dis
continue the use of tobacco from now
on.
In order to keep a line on what each
man is doing and how faithfully he
trains, a system has been arranged
whereby each athlete will place a
check beside his name after each days
workout. This will aid both the cap
tain and the coach in handling over
150 men daily.
During the mid-semester recess fif
teen additional lockers have been add
ed to the training quarters.. Two
dressing rooms have been provided
this season, while the rubbing room
has been changed to the outside room
and partitioned oil" for the exclusive
use of the rubbers.
