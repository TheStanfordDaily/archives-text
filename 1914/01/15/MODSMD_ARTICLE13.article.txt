# THE 						POINT OF THE MATTER
## 
### 
"Editorials furnished with neatness and dispatch." This is the slogan
of college journalists. For our part, we will undertake to fill the aching
void of this column with airy nothings on any subject short of the
Fourth Dimension and Progressive Dancing. This last problem has been
solved by those who rightly should solve it, the women of the University;
and they have gone at it with commendable patience and sincerity of
purpose. They have made their decision after thoughtful consideration;
the Men's Council has announced its intention of supporting their action.
The point now is, not that the rest of us do or do not approve of the
result, but that as men and women working for the success of Student
Control, we are bound to accept the rule in spirit and in letter. This is
the only vital principle involved. To quarrel over dancing as such, with
no bigger question behind, is to raise a tempest in a teapot. To deny
Student Control as it stands on trial is worse than to miss all the dances
for which campus players may scrape a fiddle.
