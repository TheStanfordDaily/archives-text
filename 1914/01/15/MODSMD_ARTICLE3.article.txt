# R.L. MURRAY, '13, WILL COACH TENNIS PLAYERS
## FOUR VETERANS REGISTERED THIS SEMESTER. Considered That They Have Good Fighting Chance to Defeat California. 
### 
To win from California this season,
the Stanford tennis team has before it
one of the hardest fights in its history,
Although there are four veterans
back in college, California has some
Freshman stars attract cl there by the
block "C," who will greatly strength
en their team. The Stanford quartet
loses two men who competed against
the Blue and Gold last year. W. N. L.
Hutchinson, '15, is not at Stanford this
year, and Murray is ineligible to com
pete in tennis on account of the four
year rule.
The veterans to return are Captain
L. Sloss, '15, F. S. Pratt, '13, H. L.
Halm, '16, and V. L. Sheldon, '15. The
men feel that hard and faithful prac
tice will give them a fighting chance
but no more than that.
The only remaining tournament to
be held before the tryouts for the
team begin is the University doubles
championship. This will be contested
next week. Murray and Pratt, the
present title holders, will compete
again.
R. L. Murray, '13, will coach the
tennis players during the spring
semester. Murray is a veteran of four
intercollegiate tourrnments, as well
as a Varstiy "S" man in track. As
a player, Murray was ranked this year
among the five best in the state and is
well acquainted with all the fine points
of the game.
