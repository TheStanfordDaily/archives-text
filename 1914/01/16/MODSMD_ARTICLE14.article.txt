# A
						TRIBUTE DUE

### 
Most of the faults of Stanford men and women are of omission,
not of commission; of the head, not of the heart. It has remained for
an observing friend of Stanford to call attention to one of these. 1 heie
is no adequate picture of Mrs. Stanford, this friend says, in the Univer
sity, with the exception of old-fashioned ones secluded in the Museum.
Let'us think of this a moment. When Mrs. Stanford lost her son, our
predecessors, we ourselves, and our successors, became his substitute in
the receipt of her love and bounty. None regard themselves as senti
mentalists if they cherish pictures of their own mothers, yet we deny
to the Mother of Stanford this filial tribute. She hung her husband's
picture in the halls of Stanford, leaving opposite a vacant space, and the
silent slight of its continued emptiness hurt her. Copies of her last and
best likeness are still obtainable. Surely a picture of Mrs. Stanford will
hang in the Union and the Women's Club House ; but why not in Encina
amMvoble Halls; why not small views of Senator and Mrs. Stanford in
honored positions in our rooming and fraternity houses?
