# PROFESSOR EATON WILL LEAD CLUB AT CONCERT
## Seats for the Entertainment Have Sold Rapidly Since the Drawing. 
### 
Those starring for the Glee club
will be seen for the last time this
year on account of the campus ruling
of but one show per semester. The
concert should lie one of exceptional
quality for three reasons: Professor
Eaton, who dicl not go on the trip, will
direct the singing; the club gained
much experience on the tour; and, an
additional number of voices will add
volume.
Many congratulatory letters from
alumni in the cities visited are now
being received by Manager Claggett.
The club will probably go to San Jose
some time next week and to Sacra
mento and Stockton a fortnight later.
Since the drawing many seats have
been sold, both on the campus and
in Palo Alto, and the indications are
that a large house will greet the club
at the entertainment.
