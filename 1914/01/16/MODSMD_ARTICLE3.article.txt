# HEAVIEST RAINS CAN CAUSE NO DAMAGE TO LEVEES OF LAGUNITA
## 
### 
Recent developments show that
there is 110 danger of Lagunita forc
ing its levee even it' swollen by con
tinued heavy rains. Measurements
were taken yesterday afternoon under
the direction of Professor C. B. Wing
of the Structural Engineering depart
ment to determine the comparative
shore levels. The findings of the in
vestigation were that for a distance
of 150 yards near the inlet at the
western end the lake bank is 9.6
inches lower than any part of the re
straining levee.
Flood water would run off through
this drainage area before reaching the
levee top, and be carried through the
regular waste drain to San Francis
quito creek. The presence of the
stretch of low land is a safeguard
against any future cscape of lake
water toward the campus.
The water level of Lagunita has
not risen noticeably during the last
two clays, since the abatement of rain
fall.
