# Rapturous Sylph Flirts in Shadow of Question Mark
## 
### 
Kissed by a halo of mystery more
filmy than the one that man Raffles
led around in the heyday of his fame,
and enveloped in the combined charm
of three Gibson beauty contests, a
woman haunts the arcades of the
Quad. The shapely lines of her back,
draped in the folds of a white garment
is all that she has revealed to passers
by to date. The figure promises a
face that must combine the languish
ing attraction of the Mona Lisa and
the original of Kipling's Vampire.
From the palm-fronded verdure of
some tropical land, the Lady in White
has come to the campus, unannounced
and determined in her mission of con
quest. Conjecture runs high and wild
as to her antecedents, and her pur
pose. Mayhap she is a secret agent
of Huerta's government, or a million
dollar doll from some island city of
the south. There is a rumor abroad
that the lady will declare herself be
fore January 31. Until then, all who
court her favor must bask in the light
of her baffling silence.
The women of the university de
clare their willingness to be respons
ible for the conduct of the sylph when
she makes her formal debut. They
promise that she will cut a wide
swath in the affections of the campus
dwellers, and will sit in at the game
of hearts with a stacked deck.
Anyone with a deductive turn of
mind may answer the riddle for him
self if he watches the lady closely.
She's bound to break the silence soon.
