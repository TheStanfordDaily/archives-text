# DR. BARROWS ADDRESSES MEN ON MOHAMMEDANISM
## H.H BRONK, ‘15, GIVES VOCAL SOLO AT MEETING. Speaker Gives Impartial View of Moslem Religion—Shows Relation to Christianity. 
### 
"Mohamedanism" was the subject
of the first of the series of Sunday
evening lectures in Encina clubroom
for the men of the university. Dean
Barrows of the University of Califor
nia, and speaker of the evening be
came familiar with this subject during
nine year's service as chief of the
Bureau of Education in the Philippine
Islands.
"Contrary to popular belief," he de
clared, "Mohamedanism does not
spread itself by the conquest of the
sword. The teachings of the Koran
say 'Let there be no compulsion, for
no man will believe by force.' 'En
treat men by compelling words,' is
rather their precept. By preaching,
Mohamedanism has spread to be sec
ond only to Christianity in potence
among world religions.
"There are two kinds of religions,
the priestly and the prophetic. In
spite of the fact that Christ's example
was prophetic, Christianity has been
historically a priestly religion with
one class to minister between God and
the people. Mohamedanism is strict
ly prophetic, and any intelligent be
liever is competent to perform the
simple ceremonies and to preach. Na
tives of the Mohamedan islands of the
Philippine archepelago are notably
better educated than others.
"The debris of lost humanity so
conspicuous, especially in our larger
cities, is not so apparent in the
Mohamedan communities. The com
mon vices of drinking and gambling
are forbidden, and almsgiving is a
strong tenet.
"Mohamedanism also has its fail
ings. Fierce fanaticism occurs.
Slavery is tolerated, and the prophet
does not try to raise the prevalent
status of women. Mohamedanism was
of necessity a compromise between
self control and self indulgence.
"Christian influences are surely
changing and transforming the modern
Mohamedanism, as evinced in the
'Young Turk' movement, until the\
religions of the East and the West may
come to such an accord as to be in
telligent. to one another, and perhaps
symathetic."
H. H. Bronk, '15, sang "Ave Maria"
after the lecture.
