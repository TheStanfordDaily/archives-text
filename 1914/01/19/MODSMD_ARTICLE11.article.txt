# MUSICAL SKILL REVEALED IN GLEE CLUB CONTEST
## PATTEN SCORES HEAVILY IN HARRY LAUDER SONGS. Individual Members and Stunt Artists Supply Features of Interesting Program. 
### 
An innovation was introduced to the
Stanford stage at the Glee club concert
Saturday evening in the form of
"Scottish Favorites." From the num
ber of encores which the audience de
manded they were appreciated from
the start. J. L. Patten, '15, played the
part of the Scottish singer and almost
rivaled Harry Lauder in his rich
dialect and winning personality.
The program of the concert was di
vided into two parts. The first in
cluded a series of individual and com
bined productions by the members of
the Glee club, while the second was a
scene in a fraternity house: "As we
live and dress on the Stanford Farm."
D. E. Sheperdson, '17, charmed the
audience in the first part of the con
cert with a remarkable rendition on
the violin of Musin's "Mazurka de Con
cert." He seemed to make the instru
ment fairly talk and twice did he re
spond to the appeal for encores.
The Cilee club which made a tour as
far north as Vancouver during the
Christmas vacation sang three of their
favorite selections under the leader
ship of Director L. H. Eaton. "Two
Men and a Nut" was a vaudeville skit
presented by J. R. Morgan, 'IG, H. H.
Bronk, '15, and W. G. Paul, '15, pianist,
J. W. Bennett, '15, was heard in the
solo, "Allah Be With Us." "The
Rosary," sung by a quartet composed
of W. C. Lynch, '15, H. H. Bronk, *15,
C. M. Miller, '14, and J. W. Kaufman,
'16, completed the first part of the pro
gram.
"Roughneck" attire and the general
college atmosphere of a room in a
fraternity house scene made an at
tractive setting for the informal rendi
diton of musical selections in the sec
ond part.

took part in the concert were: first

ment fairly talk and twice did he re
spond to the appeal for encores.
The Cilee club which made a tour as
far north as Vancouver during the
Christmas vacation sang three of their
favorite selections under the leader
ship of Director L. H. Eaton. "Two
Men and a Nut" was a vaudeville skit
presented by J. R. Morgan, 'IG, H. H.
Bronk, '15, and W. G. Paul, '15, pianist,
J. W. Bennett, '15, was heard in the

Rosary," sung by a quartet composed
of W. C. Lynch, '15, H. H. Bronk, *15,
C. M. Miller, '14, and J. W. Kaufman,
'16, completed the first part of the pro
gram.
"Roughneck" attire and the general
college atmosphere of a room in a
fraternity house scene made an at
tractive setting for the informal rendi
diton of musical selections in the sec
ond part.
The members of the Glee club who
took part in the concert were: first
tenors, F. K. Roberts, '15, A. V. Pet
tit, '15, L. C. Lull, '13, J. D. Chace, '16,

An innovation was introduced to the
Stanford stage at the Glee club concert
Saturday evening in the form of
"Scottish Favorites." From the num
ber of encores which the audience de
manded they were appreciated from
the start. J. L. Patten, '15, played the
part of the Scottish singer and almost
rivaled Harry Lauder in his rich
dialect and winning personality.
The program of the concert was di
vided into two parts. The first in
cluded a series of individual and com
bined productions by the members of
the Glee club, while the second was a
scene in a fraternity house: "As we
live and dress on the Stanford Farm."
D. E. Sheperdson, '17, charmed the
audience in the first part of the con
cert with a remarkable rendition on
the violin of Musin's "Mazurka de Con
cert." He seemed to make the instru
ment fairly talk and twice did he re
spond to the appeal for encores.
