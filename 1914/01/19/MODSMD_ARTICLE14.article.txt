# PLACARDS, PLACARDS EVERYWHERE!
## 
### 
The sun is shining—almost—, the clouds are fading fast away—
maybe—, and we chortle in our joy. Soon the sky will he blue and the
grass will he green and Stanford will he dressed in her best bib and
tucker —nearly. The pessimistic qualification is due to the fact that our
University cannot look its best so long as every Quad window, post, and
fence-rail is adorned with a motley collection of placards. A thoughtful
management has provided us with bulletin-boards intended for the dis
play of the notices hereinbefore mentioned. Yet at this moment the
bulletin-hoard 011 Lastien at the car tracks bears but one sign. " A place
for everything and nothing in its place" is a poor motto to publicly dis
play adherence to. When the sun conies fairly out and Stanford starts
coquetting for the title of the Most Beautiful University, let's help her
out a hit. Fewer signs in the windows and more 011 the bulletin boards!
