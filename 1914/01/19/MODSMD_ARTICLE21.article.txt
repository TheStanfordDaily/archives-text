For once let the male play lady and
sign a postscript. Since we are self
i governing we have accepted without
a murmur the edict of the ladies —
J God bless them, it was ever thus—
I and will not do any of the questioned
dances, let us go one step further
I (two-step not tango) and say:
Whereas, Any jokes of a question
: able character, ( being jokes because
I of their questionable character), when
published in a magazine connected in
timately with Stanford, bring odium
| upon the name of the university and

therefore constitute a "menace to the
best welfare of Stanford," be it
Resolved, That we are of the mind,
that Chappie, being a gentleman and a
scholar, should abjure all such jokes,
and, remembering the fate of the Cor
nel] widow, which went rotting to its
grave, and swing his hammer lustily
as he sings:
"My strength is as 1 lie strength of ten
Because my jokes are pure."
