# COMPLETE RECOVERY IS IN SIGHT FOR J. B. SPEER.
## 
### 
The condition of J. B. Speer, the
graduate student who suffered a
breakdown during the Christmas vaca
tion, is much improved. He is now
convalescing at the Napa State hos
pital, where he is under the special
care of Dr. Hoisholt and Dr. Harnett,
both of whom have been associated
with the Stanford medical department.
The high fever, which Speer had two
weeks ago, has subsided and his as
thmatic trouble is also much better.
He will be confined to his bed for two
weeks more, however, as an attack of
bronchial pneumonia left him very
weak. These physical ailments played
an important part in the recent col
lapse.
The physicians in charge state that
the excitement of final examinations,
at the time of his asthmatic and bron
chial illness, probably caused his de
lirium during the latter part of the
holidays. No symptoms of this are
now noticeable. His conversation is
absolutely rational and it is very prob
able that he will completely recover
within a few months.
