# CHAPLAIN GIVES SUNDAY SERMON ON TEMPTATION
## CHOIR GIVES ANTHEM: ”OH, THOU WHOSE POWER.” "The Choice Between Good and Evil Braces the Boy, Refines the Girl.” 
### 
Chaplain D. Charles Gardner gave
a strong sermon in the Memorial
Church yesterday morning, choosing
for his text: "My son, if thou cometh
to serve the Lord, prepare thy soul for
temptation."
"As Christian men and women we
commit our lives to a great venture,"
he said. "There are some who can dis
cern in the history and the course of
nature no touch of the Divine. But
others gifted with spiritual imagina
tion believe that behind the changing
forms of life is a reality and that the
reality is God.
"One of the constant baffling exper
iences of the Christian life is tempta
tion. Drunkenness, lust, gluttony,
cruelty, murder are not pliant as
margoria of the religious mind. They
are the dreadful horrors which follow
when men and women yield to temp
tation. The wordly life is one of
frank self-indulgence. To 'give-in' to
temptation is to surrender to the trai
tor within the citadel of your own
soul.
"Alas! our moral struggle is not
confined to the subduing of the temp
tation of the flesh. Selfishness, pride,
envy, jealousy, ugly moods —what are
these but spiritual temptations?
"Contradictory as it may seem, I
must here admit that temptation is
good for us. The choice between good
and evil braces the boy, refines the
girl. If you cultivate the habit of
choosing the best, which is good, the
best becomes, with habit, the impera
tive"
The anthem was "Oh, Thou Whose
Power," a prayer from "Moses in!
Egypt."
