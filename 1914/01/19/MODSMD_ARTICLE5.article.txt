# STOPS THE RUNAWAY RESCUES THE CHILD GETS COAT CLEANED
## 
### 
Starting from the Row at 9:15 this
morning a runaway horse attached to
a Japanese cleaner's delivery wagon
passed down the Quad headed for the
Palm drive. In the seat was a child.
Several futile attempts were made to
stou the cart. As the carreening vehi
cle passed the History corner L. R.
Owen, '17, seized a wheel and quickly
started in pursuit. Overhauling the
runaway he placed his foot on the
step and leaped into the cart. Quickly
seizing the whip he fished up the
reins and slowly brought the horse to a
stop. When the driver arrived he
said, "Thank you, sir, I so frightened,
I clean your coat."
