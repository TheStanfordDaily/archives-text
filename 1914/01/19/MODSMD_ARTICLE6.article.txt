# ”KEWPIES” TO BE SOLD AT PRE-PANAMA EXPOSITION
## 
### 
One of the cleverest ideas yet at
tempted for the Pre-Panama Exposi
tion will he a "Kewpie" hooth gotten
up by the Kappa Kappa Gamma soror
ity. The plan is to sell "Kewpies" of
all sorts and sizes and in various cos
tumes. A large one dressed in a 'Var
sity sweater will he raffled during
the afternoon. There seems to he
such a demand for these new toys that
the hooth will unquestionably be a
great success.
