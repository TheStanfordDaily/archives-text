## HAS COMMENTS ON SEVEN HOOKS BY STANFORD PEOPLE. Professor C.D. Marx is Subject of Frontispiece and Featured Article. 
### 
The Stanford Alumnus, which will
be issued tomorrow, is very largely a
book-review number. It contains
seven articles about recent books by
Stanford people, which have been
written for Editor E. W. Smith, '99, by
other Stanford people who are familiar
with the subjects.
Chancellor Jordan's "War and
Waste" and "America's Conquest, of
Europe" are reviewed by Professor
V. L. Kellogg; the late Professor New
comer's "Memorial Ode and Other
Poems" is reviewed by Professor 15.
O. Foster, '95; "Ancient History,"
by Hutton Webster, '96, is reviewed
by Professor Arley B. Show; "Prob
lems of Education" by David S. Sned
den, '96, who is now Commissioner of
Education in Massachusetts, is re
viewed by Professor L. M. Terman;
"The Portland School Survey," by
Professor E. P. Cubberley, is reviewed
by Professor J. B. Scars; "The Power
of Ideals in American History," by
Professor E. D. Adams, is reviewed
by Professor P. J. Treat, Ph.D. '10;
and "Lanagan, Amateur Detective," by
Edward H. Hurlbut, ex-'O4, is reviewed
by F. E. Hill, '11.
Announcement is also made that
Hill, who was editor of a wide-awake
"Sequoia" in his senior year, and con
nected also with other Stanford pub
lications and who is now an instruc
tor and advanced student in the Eng
lish department, will be the book
review editor of the "Alumnus."
The frontispiece of the magazine is
a portrait of Professor C. D. Marx.
The first article in the magazine is an
appreciation of him as a man who has
a great influence upon the develop
ment of typical Stanford men through
the power of his personality. His ap
titude for making friends, and his
value as a man who has brought down
to the present day the spirit of the
pioneer days of the university, are
also remarked.
The rest of the magazine is con
cerned with news items that will in
terest the alumni, such as the Glee
club tour, the changes in the en
trance regulations for women, the
mid-year graduates, and the appoint
ment of Ambrose as student adviser.
A particularly interesting newt
item is the announcement that the
Lane library of the Medical depart
ment in San Francisco is receiving
gifts of books from physicians all
over the western part of the United
States. This is an indication that
these men regard the library, as the
university itself does, as an institu
tion that belongs to the entire Pacific
Coast.

item is the announcement that the
Lane library of the Medical depart
ment in San Francisco is receiving
gifts of books from physicians all
over the western part of the United
States. This is an indication that
these men regard the library, as the
university itself does, as an institu
tion that belongs to the entire Pacific
Coast.
The Stanford Alumnus, which will
be issued tomorrow, is very largely a
book-review number. It contains
seven articles about recent books by
Stanford people, which have been
written for Editor E. W. Smith, '99, by
other Stanford people who are familiar
with the subjects.
Chancellor Jordan's "War and
Waste" and "America's Conquest, of
Europe" are reviewed by Professor
V. L. Kellogg; the late Professor New
comer's "Memorial Ode and Other
Poems" is reviewed by Professor 15.
O. Foster, '95; "Ancient History,"
by Hutton Webster, '96, is reviewed
by Professor Arley B. Show; "Prob
lems of Education" by David S. Sned
den, '96, who is now Commissioner of
Education in Massachusetts, is re
viewed by Professor L. M. Terman;
"The Portland School Survey," by
Professor E. P. Cubberley, is reviewed
by Professor J. B. Scars; "The Power
of Ideals in American History," by
Professor E. D. Adams, is reviewed
by Professor P. J. Treat, Ph.D. '10;
and "Lanagan, Amateur Detective," by
Edward H. Hurlbut, ex-'O4, is reviewed
by F. E. Hill, '11.
Announcement is also made that
Hill, who was editor of a wide-awake
"Sequoia" in his senior year, and con
nected also with other Stanford pub
lications and who is now an instruc
tor and advanced student in the Eng
lish department, will be the book
review editor of the "Alumnus."
The frontispiece of the magazine is
a portrait of Professor C. D. Marx.
The first article in the magazine is an
appreciation of him as a man who has
a great influence upon the develop
ment of typical Stanford men through
the power of his personality. His ap
titude for making friends, and his
value as a man who has brought down
to the present day the spirit of the
pioneer days of the university, are
also remarked.
The rest of the magazine is con
cerned with news items that will in
terest the alumni, such as the Glee
club tour, the changes in the en
trance regulations for women, the
mid-year graduates, and the appoint
ment of Ambrose as student adviser.
A particularly interesting newt
item is the announcement that the
Lane library of the Medical depart
ment in San Francisco is receiving
gifts of books from physicians all
over the western part of the United
States. This is an indication that
these men regard the library, as the
university itself does, as an institu
tion that belongs to the entire Pacific
Coast.
