The electric railway service between Palo Alto and the Campus is
a blessing unmixed. Yet it's not as much of a blessing as it might be.
at that. When the announcement of the installation of the line was first
made, students longed for its coming as a deliverance from the weary
walk from the station to the Campus which was the lot of San Francisco
or San Jose theatergoers. For two or three all-too-short years the prom
ised relief was enjoyed. Once more, however, the dark and dreary walk
is the fate of student theater-train passengers. As an alternative
"privilege" one may, for the price of many carfares, pile into a "taxi"
with a dozen other ill-starred travelers. The retention of the theater
train cars is a convenience due in right and justice to the patrons of the
line. "The service will not be reinstated until 'there is sufficient
demand," said a Peninsula Railway representative today. The logical
solution of the difficulty, then, seems to be for those students, and there
are many, who desire this accomodation, to make the "demand" for it
heard in the proper quarter.
