## 
### 
Copies of the session laws of about
half the states of the union were re
ceived yesterday at the Law library.
Orders have been placed for a com
plete copy of these laws from all the
states, in pursuance of a recently
adopted policy to place all the im
portant legislation of this nature at â– 
the command of the law students. In |
addition, an expensive edition of C. I
B. Labatt's "Master and Servant" has |
been secured for use in Professor Hus- i
ton's course on Agency.
