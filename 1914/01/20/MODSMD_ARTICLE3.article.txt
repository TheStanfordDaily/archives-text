Roles in Winchell Smith's comedy
"The Fortune Hunter" were assigned
to nineteen of the 1916 class yesterday
afternoon by Dramatic Coach F. L.
Mathieu. The Sophomore venture will
be staged March 14, in the Assembly
Hall. The cast was chosen from a
field of 96 candidates at tryouts held
Saturday and yesterday. The commit
tee announces that it wishes to thank
those who showed an interest in the
try-outs for the cast.
"The Fortune Hunter" is a palate
tickling mixture of soft drinks, youth
ful enthusiasm, and a banker's daugh-

ter, which first met the approval of
Broadway several years ago. The title
role of the rural drugstore barkeeper
was created by Jack Barrymore. He
was succeeded on the road by Fred
Niblo, who dispensed the soda foun
tain romance on the Pacific Coast.
Like "The Traveling Salesman" and
"The Chorus Lady," the hero of the
present Smith comedy, introduces
numerous revelations that have be
come part of the American language.
The demands of the play with regard
to cast and setting are well suited to
campus production.
