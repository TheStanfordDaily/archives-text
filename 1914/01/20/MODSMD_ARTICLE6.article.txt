# PLACES FOR SINGERS ON THE GLEE CLUB TO BE OPEN FRIDAY
## 
### 
Tryouts for the Glee club will be
held in room 84 at 8:30 Friday even
ing. Professor Eaton will conduct
them and will be sole judge. In order
to obtain the best voices in the uni
versity provision will be made for
those unable to attend at the time
named if they will hand their names
to Manager Claggett.
Several vacancies have occurred in
the Glee club and these are now open
to competition. In addition to re
filling these regular places, two sub
stitutes are to be chosen for each
part. This is in accordance with the
vote last fall to keep the club down to
twenty-four and to put it strictly on
a competitive basis. Regular club
members who absent themselves un
necessarily will lose their places to
substitutes and will fall back into
j substitute positions.
The advisability of sending the club
to Los Angeles via the Sail Joaquin
valley during the spring vacation is
now being investigated. A trip to San
Jose is already decided upon, and an
other to Sacramento and Stockton will
j probably follow in the near future.
