# VARSITY NINE WILL PLAY IRELAND TEAM TOMORROW
## VISITORS TO ENTER FIRST GAME WITH STRONG LINE-UP. Captain Terry Bering Season With Six Members of Last Year's Team. 
### 
The Varsity baseball team will have
its first play with an outside team to
morrow afternoon when it faces Ire
land's Independents on the Stanford
diamond. Umpire Elmer Strickletll
will call the game at 4:15.
Ireland will be with his aggregation
posing or reposing, at the second base
position, and assisting his cohorts
with the usual line of blarney. He
will have the following players with
him to assist in the details of oppos
ing the Cardinal Varsity: Spencer,
third base; Tobin, left field; Duffy
Lewis, center field; Swain, right field;
Kennedy, first base; Fitzsimmons,
shortstop; Driscoll, Martinoni,
Schimpff, pitchers; Perkins, catcher.
The old veteran and his Independents
have come to be a feature of Stanford
baseball seasons. This team has
proved a very worthy opponent, and
is one of the strongest combinations
he has yet had together. It includes
a number of past diamond stars of
first magnitude.
Captain Terry will open tomorrow's
game with practically a veteran line
up, composed of six veterans and three
Varsity' substitutes of last spring.
Maple and Dent is the battery that
will probably start for the Varsity.
This is the same combination that
served throughout the victorious in
tercollegiate series a year ago. First
and third bases will again be occupied
by Workman and McCloskey, while
Terry will resume his position at
shortstop. Jacks, substitute infielder
last year, will appear at second.
Halm at left field is the only veteran
of the outfield. Center and left will
be covered by Day and Noonan re
spectively, both of whom have had ex
perience as Varsity substitutes.
Rainy weather has prevented ex
tensive practise on the diamond. The
field is now in proper condition for
tomorrow's game barring further pre
cipitation. If a change in the weather
causes the game to be postponed
notice will be given on the bulletin
boards at noon. The admission will
be twenty-five cents. Season tickets
will admit student holders, and they
will be on sale at the gates.
