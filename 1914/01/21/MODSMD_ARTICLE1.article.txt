# STANFORD MAN ENGAGED IN LEGAL INVESTIGATION
## CARNEGIE FOUNDATION EMPLOYS PROFESSOR HOHFELD. Will Make Report on Requirements for Admission to the Bar in Coast States. 
### 
As the representative of the Carne
gie Educational Foundation for the in
vestigation of Pacific Coast systems
for examination and admission to the
bar, Professor W. N. Hohfeld, of the
Law department, has just returned
from a three days' visit in Los Angeles,
at the District Court of Appeal of the
Second District of California.
The object of the trip was to study
the rules and methods pursued by this
court in examining applicants for ad
mission to the bar. The Court of Ap
peal for the First District, located in
San Francisco, and the Court of Ap
peal for the Third District, located in
Sacramento, have similar jurisdiction
to examine and admite candidates.
The investigation for the Third
Appellate was made previously by
Professor Hohfeld, and a similar
study will be made for the First
District in the coming April
when the first examinations will be
held.
The report to be made by Professor
Hohfeld for each of the districts in
California and also for Washington
and Oregon, will include, first, a
minute study of the constitutional and
statutory provisions and all judicial
decisions bearing on the qualifications
and requirements for examination and
admission to the bar; second, a study
of the methods actually employed by
the respective courts and examining
boards involved; third, a careful
statistical investigation extending
over the last ten years, to indicate, in
comparative way, the actual results of
the systems now in vogue in the var
ious states and districts concerned;
fourth, a consideration of the effects
of low standards for examination and
admission upon the legal profession m
each state and the general administra
tion of justice; and fifth, critical sug
gestions and recommendations looking
toward the improvement of each of the
systems under investigation.
Professor Hohfeld's investigation i:i
the states of Washington and Oregon
were made in October last. In th 3
following December, as an immediate
result of the nation-wide study being
conducted by the Carnegie Foundation,
a new set of rules and requirements
was promulgated for the latter state,
involving much higher standards both
as regards general and legal educa
tion and as to the methods of conduct
ing all future examinations to be held.
Similar investigations are being con
ducted for all the states of the union
and the Canadian Provinces, and the
final results will be embodied in a
comprehensive report to lie published
by the Carnegie Foundation, along
with a parallel report on the
equipment, the faculty and the educa
tional standards and requirements of
each of the different law schools of the
country.
