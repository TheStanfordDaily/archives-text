# MASOUERS TO PORTRAY [iligible] ANCE
## [iligible] STEET" IS OFFERING FOR FEBRUARY 6. Author of "Peter Pan" Draws Unusual Character in Attractive Play. 
### 
"Quality Street," Barie's quaint
stage story of old fashioned England
in the Napoleonic period is being pre
pared for production in the Assembly
Hall February G. T1 „ have
chosen a comedy from thq pen of the
man who wrote "Peter Pan," "The
Admirable Crichton," and many other
plays and stories that are dear to the
English speaking people.
Maude Adams has helped to make
the characters of the Scotch play
wright intimately known to the Amer
ican public. Barrie's people speak and
act things that leave a memory. They
have a knack of recalling to mind
folks one has loved in a humble sort
of way. For a few hours they become
the friends of real experience, and
long after meeting them one speaks of
them with a personal pride.
The dear old ladies who live in Qual
ity Street glance back many times
to the youth which must have held
many charms, and which we know held
sad disappointment. They try bravely
not to let one another know that youth
is lagging behind, and that time is
trying to burden them with the bit
terness of broken hopes, and many
"ifs" that were not realized. One can't
help glancing back with them, and
then noting with sorrow the brave
pretense at cheer. Throughout their
one unstolen birthright remains. It
is real "quality" of breeding.
There is also a girl in the story.
We see her standing in a beautiful
garden that faces Quality Street and
say goodbye to a dashing young sol
dier who is off to the wars. Ten years
pass, and try cruelly to resign the
girl to the lot of the "old maids," who
remember always that it might have
been, but was not.
Through the window of the blue and
white room we finally see the gay
soldiers come back from Waterloo.
The shimmer of bright dresses, laugh
ter, and the sounds of music from a
ball room come from the street. Then
the young soldier returns and "de
clares himself." Then the girl throws
off her prim cap, and shakes down her
curls.
A fragrance of lavender and mig
nonette pervades the four acts.
