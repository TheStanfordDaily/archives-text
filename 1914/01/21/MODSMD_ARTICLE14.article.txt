# THE 						SPIRIT, NOT THE LETTER
## 
### 
Complete cooperation and understanding- between .students and
officials of student government, coupled with the interpretation of
necessary rules in spirit rather than in letter â€”this in a nutshell is the
ideal of Student Control. An action in harmony with this conception
was taken by the Conference last evening. A necessary rule has been
in force prohibiting undergraduates from participating in more than one
musical or dramatic performance during a semester. The reason for
this rule was found in the loss of time and consequent detriment to
scholarship entailed by rehearsing not wisely but too well. The men of
the Glee Club, however, did the major part of their rehearsing last
semester, and the concert of Saturday caused them little more loss of
time than that experienced by any member of the audience. These con
siderations took this specific case entirely out of its original contempla
tion. In recognizing this the Conference incidentally did a bit of service
to a characteristic Stanford event, the Junior ()pera.
It is greatly to be hoped that in future cases of like nature there will
be further instances of liberal interpretation. This cannot be, however,
if the students abuse such concessions.
The moment they are made use of to avoid the intent and spirit
of a rule, a return to the policy of strict construction will be enforced.
So here's for that cooperation which will make for the minimum of
rules with the maximum of results.
