"Ragging" Was Subject of Spirited
Debate in Ncsloria—Eii|»liroiii>iits
Discuss Cabinet Government.
What was probably the most spirited
debate ot' the year was engaged in by
the members of Euphronia last night
when tlie question "Resolved, That
the United States should adopt a re
sponsible system of cabinet govern
ment" was warmly contested. The
support of the measure was led by C.
15. Weston, '15, while J. W. Kaufman,
'16, headed the opposition. All the mem
bers of the Senate took sides in the
discussion either for or against. No
linal decision was attained. After the
debate President A. I''. Coyle, '15, urged
that all who were able should try-out
for the Tri-State team. The subject
for discussion at the next meeting
was not announced, but will include
some phase of the Tri-State question.
"Resolved, That the French made a
mistake in passing the Three Year
Army Hill," a particular phase of the
general Carnot question, was the
theme for discussion at the meeting
of Nestoria last night. As there were
no regular speakers appointed an in
formal debate was held among all the
members present. No decision was an
nounced.
I3y far the most interesting part of
the meeting came with the debate on
the merits of the resolution on "rag
ging" handed down by the Women's
Conference. At the end of a period
of heated discussion those in favor of
permitting the new dances on the
campus won out. '
