# Cast of Glee Club Show Not Barred From Trying-Out
## 
### 
Men having parts in the Glee club
show of last Saturday evening w'il
not be disqualified from participating
in other productions this semester.
They will be allowed to appear in
the Junior Opera or any of the events
coming later in the season. Such is
the result of action taken last evening
by the University Conference.
Specific exception is made to the
"one play a semester" rule in the case
of this year's entertainment of the
Glee club. The rule was originally
laid down In order to remove the
necessity of any student having to re
hearse two plays, the reason being that
this requires too much time for one
semester.
All the practice for the Glee club
show was held last semester before
the northern trip was taken during
the Christmas holidays, and practic
ally all the time required since the re
turn was on the one night of the per
formance. For this reason the Con
ference decided that it is not, strictly
speaking, a this semester show, and
will not exclude its cast from trying
Out for other events.
