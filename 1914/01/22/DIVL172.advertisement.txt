You fellows know what that means!
We've been very successful in this
regard with F atima Cigarettes. By \ j
the way, these cigarettes were first
sold in the college towns —and you
agreed with us that they were good.
Then we put out for the big race,
to make Fatimas of nation-wide rep- p\
utation, and today more are sold than KJ^L
any other cigarette in this country. L
No purer, or more carefully chosen limIBW
tobacco grows than that in Fatimas.
We purposely put them in a plain -jr-% TlVl
inexpensive wrapper —in this way l||| /(/il l( V\
we can afford quality tobacco, and jf|jo I (n C |
twenty of the smokes for 1 5 cents. ■WW ■ ■ I
Now your college crew is of utmost Ip »
importance to you —so is a good
cigarette, and it's your aim in life iAf aJPjKm
to keep Fatimas in the lead —right Turkish rlf-kd
up to their good quality—right up CIGARETTES
to where you first found them, and yQ r r ie<j.
will always find them.
Success fellows! You started this rrmTTib
cigarette on its successful career —■
and you pull a strong oar all over
this country. /Jk
