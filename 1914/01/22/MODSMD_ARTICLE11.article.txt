# TRANSFORMATIONS
## 
### 
Within the memory of man is the day when the Stanford liand
was a frail craft, a poor old tub weathering - head winds of criticism and
tooting its way across a sea of disharmony. Today—allowing our meta
phor to sink in its own ocean—the band is a strong organization of
recognized musical ability and varied activities, some of which are rep
resented in the news columns of this issue. The self-sacrificing interest
of Professor E. W. Martin, the work of loyal student officers, and con
centration of energy on the part of the members, are among the elements
which have made for this notable success.
At present the Glee Club is undergoing a similar transformation and
bids fair to become an organization of permanent strength. From time
to time this phenomenon or rapid growth is noticed among Stanford
societies. It is usually due to a combination of circumstances, among
them always being the presence of The Man. For every man with
energy and ambition there is among the student activities of Stanford
one wherein he may display these qualities to the benefit of himself and of
the University. There is always another cause responsible for this
progress, a cause which has already been harped upon by this paper—
the elimination of divided interest. Let every student be in activities,
but let him be only in the one or two which from his point of view seem
most worthy and beneficial.
