Alter working with the list of two
hundred candidates until three o'clock
this morning, Coach W. F. Rochester
announces the cast of the 1914 Junior
Opera. He was assisted during the
try-outs by a committee composed of
Misses Miriam Bryan, Elizabeth Taff,
and W. B. Forbes, W. W. Thoburn, and
G. Heyneman.
The unusual number of students
who entered the contest for parts
made selection of a cast difficult, but
assures capable material. The prin
cipals made repeated tests of merit,
and members of the choruses showed
great skill in song and dance tests.
Most of the actors are from a field of
new talent.
The "College Prince" has catchy
music and a real plot. The greater
part of the musical scores are the

work of M. L. Blumenthal, '16. M. A.
Hagen, '15, wrote the libretto, lyrics
and several musicals numbers also.
Rehearsals will be commenced next
week. The date will be announced
later by the committee.
The women of the choruses are:
Misses McCord, Vaughn, Parker,
Peck, Beach, Seward, Madeline Turner,
Muriel Turner, Ledyard, Russell, Carr,
Neth, Forrest, Morse, Egbert, Sheldon,
Bryan, Vrang, Loder, Carus, Stone,
Dart, Locke, Judah, Brydolf, Moore,
Cuneo, Maxwell, Darrow, Sanford.
The chorus men follow: Rose,
Chappel, Steel, Griffin, Patterson, Mc-
Culloch, Lord, Fletcher, Evens, Dun
lap, Petterson, Claggett, McLaughlin,
Wuesthoff, Whiting, Kilgareth, Mc-
Clurg, McClellan, Dingley, Chapman.
Sheehy, Dievendorf.
