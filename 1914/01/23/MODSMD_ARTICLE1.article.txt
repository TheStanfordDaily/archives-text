# MASQUERS PLAY PICTURES TO BE SHOWN ON QUAD
## COSTUMES AND SCENERY ARE RICH BLEND OF COLORS. Triumph of Stagecraft Will be Garden Party Setting in Third Act. 
### 
The lirst photographs of the cast of
"Quality Street" will be taken in full
costume tomorrow morning at Davey's
studio in Palo Alto. The quaint post
ers of the delightful Barrie comedy,
which already illuminate many cor
ners of the Quad, are attracting a
great deal of attention. These old
fashioned color-prints are done in
the very spirit of the play and give
an excellent idea of the atmosphere
and costuming of the coming Mas
quers production, which is scheduled
for the evening of February 6.
Miss Billiard and Miss Borough,
bonnetted and becurled in the fashion
of old London in the Napoleonic
period, make charming pictures in the
blue and white room of the Tlirossel
sisters.
The military atmosphere will be
enhanced by the costumes of the men
of the cast. In their cut-away coats,
satin breeches, braided epaulets and
high boots, they promise to be either
gallant or comic figures, as their par
ticular character happens to warrant.
Scenic splendors of the comedy will
be given colorful expression in each
of the four acts. A gay ball scene
in the third act will be the mechanical
triumph of the production. Moonlight,
strolling couples, a shaded garden
music, and sight of damsels and gal
lants as they pass the door of the
tented ball room in the motions of the
quadrille and minuet will enter the
great picture.
The blue and white room of the
Misses Tlirossel, looking out on the
life and beauty of Quality Street is
the setting for the first and last acts.
In the second act, the room has been
metamorphosed to a "Most proper and
elegant school for young ladies and
gentlemen of quality."
New sets are now being built for the
comedy, and will soon be placed in the
Assembly Hall.
