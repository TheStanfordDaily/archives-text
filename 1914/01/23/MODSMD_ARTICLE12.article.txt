I lore's hoping that the cigarette will soon cease to droop from the
port side of a Freshman's month, and that the "cob" will glow where
first-year men congregate. The resolution adopted last evening bv Skull
and Snakes brims with common horse sense. While realizing that the
presence of traditions adds inestimably to the life of a college, many
have found it difficult properly to reverence these traditions when one
of them seemed to have no foundation in reason. Without attempting
a treatise on the subject of nicotine, we may safely say that as between
the corncob and the cigarette, the "hod" is the more democratic, econom
ical and healthful. It is greatly to be hoped that the classes and other
bodies to whom may be referred the Skull and Snakes recommendation
will take such action that they will have the pleasure of watching the
tradition of Freshmen cigarette smoking die an awful and agonizing
death.
