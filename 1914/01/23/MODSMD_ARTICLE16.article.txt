Editor Daily Palo Alto: â€”
We are accustomed to an annual
concert by the Combined Clubs. The
Mandolin club would have made the
recent concert longer and some of the
poorer stunts of the Gleers could
then have been left out, which would
have made the audience more gleeful.
We spent a whole semester joyfully
hoping that at last we were to fs.ee a
combined concert that would stack
up with the best in our glorious U. S.
A. Then again, the most successful
trip of the clubs was when they com
bined and went east on the Santa Fe
a few years ago. Most people tire of
singing alone. Though we, here on
the Farm, love our Glee club and our
Mandolin club, we showed by oui
scanty attendance 011 Saturday nkht
that we can not stand a whole evening
of Glee club songs and these socalled
stunts. Where were the combined
clubs?
AN ALUMNUS.
