# FRESHMAN CREW SQUAD IS GIVEN PRACTICE IN BARGE
## Varsity Men Balance Inexperience of New Candidates—Repairs Are Made on Float. 
### 
Freshman crew candidates are
gradually overcoming their awk
wardness upon the water, and the
coaching committee have planm d
work-outs for the first year men in the
four-oared barge, according to a time
schedule. Two men on the 'Varsity
s'liiad and an equal number of Fresh
men are given practice at the same
time. This system steadies the new
men and insures the safety of the
boat.
.Much needed repairs have been
made upon the float, which has been
in an unsound condition for the last
two weeks.
The boats at Redwood will probably
bo utilized during the week-end under
the supervision of Conch F. L».
Guerena, 'It.
