# STANFORD MEN TO ATTEND SAN ANSELMO CONFERENCE
## Fifteen Delegates Will Participate in Meeting of Christian Leadership Convention. 
### 
Stanford is to be represented at
the Christian Leadership Conference,
by a delegation of fifteen men, who
left this morning for San Anselnio
where the meeting will be held today
and tomorrow. Besides Secretary E.
H. Lockwood, of the local Y. M. C. A.,
the members of the delegation are P.
G. Krehbiel, '16, H. A. Frye, '17, N. L.
Lamb, '14, J. G. Howes, '14, R. Hirao,
R. C. Jensen, '16, A. J. Vail, '15, R. E.

Beanblossom, '14, A. P. Low, '14, A.
F. Coyle, '15, C. B. Hawks, '17, and J.

The conference sessions will be
crowded into twenty-four hours, and
the program planned will include
talks by several prominent men. Bis
hop E. H. Hughes, of the Methodist
church, will speak on the "Fundamen
tal Principles Underlying the Choice
of a Life Work," while Bishop J. 11.
Johnson, of the Episcopal church, has
chosen for his subject "The Place of
the Church in the Kingdom Enter
prise." Other topics deal with the un
precedented challenge of the present
day Christian Leaders. Time will also
be taken for Bible study, prayer and
general discussion and comments from
all the delegates, who will gather from
most of the bay schools.
Meetings of this kind have been
held biennially for some time, with the
difference that the need for ministers
of the gospel was urged before, in
stead of a general demand being made
for Christian Leadership.
