# WORLD HONOR BESTOWED ON HOOVERS
## 
### 
Herbert Clark Hoover, '9.">, and Mrs.
Lou Henry Hoover, '98, have jointly
been awarded the annual gold medal
of the Mining and Metallurgical So
ciety of America, "in recognition of

their distinguished contributions to
the literature of mining." The society
awarded the medal at its annual meet
ing on January 13. but since the

Hoovers were not present, it will bo
conferred upon them personally at a
latter meeting.
1 his is the first award of the medal
that has been made by the society.
Under the terms by which the society
established the medal, the honor is
to be conferred each year "for con
spicuous professional or public serv
ice for the advancement of the science
of Mining, of Metallurgy, or of Econ
omic Geology; for the betterment of
the conditions under which these in
dustries are carried on, for the pro
tection of mine investors, and especial
ly for the protection of the health
and safety of workmen in mines and
metallurgical establishments." Tlie
society in making the annual award
does not confine itself to the United
States, but canvasses the world field
in bestowing the honor.
The medal itself was designed by
Tiffany and is a beautiful piece of
work. On the face is a female figurf
breaking through a mass of rock.
This symbolizes science or knowledge
breaking through the rock of ignor
ance or prejudice. In her right hand
she holds a crystal, representing truth.
The obverse side bears a laurel
branch in relief, the names of the
society and of the recipients, and the
legend, "Awarded for distinguished
service," with the date.
The chief literary work in which the
Hoovers were collaborators last year
was the monumental translation of the
mediaeval Latin treatise on mining
and metallurgy, "De He Metallica," by
Georgius Agricola. A copy of this
work is in the Stanford Collection of
the University library. It is, like the
original, a large quarto, bound in
veMim. It is printed on special paper,
and with a special type face to re
semble the original work, and has
more than three hundred illustrations,
reproductions of the wood engravings
which illustrated Agricola's text, and
of other early pictures. The volume
contains nearly 700 pages.
"De Re Metallica" was published in
1556, and for nearly two centuries
was the standard work on geology and
mining. The translation was an im
mensely difficult task, since the orig
inal work was in the broken down
mediaeval Latin, made still more diffi
cult by the fact that Agricola coined
technical words where none existed.
The translation therefore required a
knowledge both of Latin and of geol
ogy and mining. All previous attempts
at translation had failed through a
lack of one or the other of these essen
tials, and even an effort made by a
group of Americans in 1901 was aband
oned after a time as impossible.
But the Hoovers have done more
than merely translate Agricola's work;
through copious footnotes they have
made their volume practically a his
tory of mining and metallurgy, at
least up to the time of the beginning of
modern science.
