# VARSITY AND ALL-STARS PLAY BALL TOMORROW
## GAME WILL START AT 3:15 IF WEATHER PERMITS. Little Practice Precedes First Game. "Doc" Moskiman Will Work With Squad. 
### 
Stanford fans have yet to see their
first baseball game of the liÂ»14 sea
son, and unless J. Pluvius changes
his present attitude "rain" will mark
the passing of the third listed event.
Tomorrow's game was scheduled
with the Olympic batsmen, but this
has been changed so that the Varsity
will meet the All-Stars, who were
originally scheduled to open the sea
son in a game last Saturday. This
team is an aggregation of former
ball players from various colleges,
and will provide plenty of opposition
j to Captain Terry's men.
The Stanford line-up has been some
; what changed from the previous an
| nouncements due to the illness of Mc
j Closkey, Varsity third baseman. Jack
and Wynne will alternate in this po
i sition. Stafford and Williman will
relieve each other at second.
The other infielders will remain the
same, with Maple and Dent constitut
ing the battery. Hayes, a substitute
on last spring's pitching staff, will also
be used in the box. Captain Terry at
short, and Workman at first, completes
the infield line-up.
The outfielders remain the same as
announce 1 for previous games. Prom
left to right they are: Halm, Day and
Noon an.
The soft condition of the ground has
prevented extensive practice so far.
Hatting and a little fielding has
constituted the light work this week.
Coach Moskiman will take charge of
the squad together with Captain Terry
as soon as the weather will allow two
teams to work on the diamond.

The game will start at 3:15. Elmer
Stricklett will officiate as umpire. Ad
mission is set at 2T> cents, or the pre
sentation of a season ticket. These
I tickets will also be on sale at the
gates. Positive notice of the game
will he posted on the bulletin board
at noon tomorrow.
