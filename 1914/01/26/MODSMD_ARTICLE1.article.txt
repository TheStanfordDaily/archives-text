# J.G. EMERSON, WINS IN BERWICK PEACE CONTEST
## DEFEATS FIELD OF SEVEN AFTER SPIRITED DEBATE. "America, and Peace in the Orient" Title of Scholarly Address. 
### 
J. G. Emerson, gr., won the annual
Edward Berwick Junior Peace Prize
of fifty dollars from a field of seven
competitors at the chapel last Friday
evening. In a forceful and logical
disputation he presented the theme
"America and Peace in the Orient." A
summary of this speech follows:
"The seat of all future international
wars lies in the Orient. It is inevitable
that the conflict should take place in
China. In anticipation of this fact,
Japan, the southern antagonist, is
taxing her citizens one-fourth of all
their net earnings. Russia on the
north through her Siberian railroad
is waiting for the opportunity to seize
a port on the Pacific. The whole
world in time will be involved in a
great international struggle. The
solution of this problem lies with the
United States, since she is so situated
as to be able to intervene in
Oriental politics."
Urges Realization of Peace
A. B. Aten, '16, the first speaker of
the evening, discussed "Stopping the
Engines of War." He argued that
peace was being rapidly secured
through advancing civilization, but
this fact had not been realized by the
people of today. The peace problem
could be solved, he said, if the recog
nition of the fact that peace now
actually existed could be secured.
Following him, A. L. Johnson, '16,
spoke on "Evolutionary Aspects of
International Arbitration." He traced
the growing movement for peace, be
ginning with the first Hague confer
ence, and maintained that peace would
only be an actuality when the people
were ready for it. By education of the
nations in the doctrines of peace and
by compulsory arbitration he claimed
the great problem would soon be
solved.
A. L. Morosco, '16, declared that "The
Economic Foundation of Peace" should
interest all peace makers. If the
world were combined into a great in
dustrial organization with representa
tives from all countries so as to form
a Hague conference upon an economic
basis. Morosco declared that war
would pass out of the future annals oi
history.
Dangers of Press Considered
"Journalism and International
Peace" was the subject of C. W. Ide's
address. His solution was the control
of the press. The war with Spain was
cited as an example of a newspaper
conflict. An international congress or
editors who would adopt a distinct
policy of peace would prevent future
warfare, he declared.
L. Clayton, '1.1, taking as his sub
ject. "War and Manhood," contrasted
the soldiers of former times with
those of today, showing that present
war degrades manhood. Through a
development of manhood by education
he argued that the problem would be
solved.
friendliness of the two student bodies
to dissatisfaction with the manner in
which athletic meets have been con
ducted both at Stanford and Los
Angeles, and to extreme partisan con
troversy in the press of northern
and southern California.
Wilcox made the following state
ment yesterday afternoon: "As long
as competition between the two uni
versities is not of a wholesome nature,
it is best to let it ride over for a
year. The sentiment in the student
body here is largely caused by undue
discussion in the papers, and a meet
ing at present would be more a fight
than a competition.

"So far as talk of calling off athletic
relations permanently goes, that is all
bosh. There never has been an ath
letic agreement between Stanford and
Southern California. An attempt has
been made to favor friendly competi
tion by going south. The competition
was friendly until last year at the time
of the track meet 011 Bovard Field.
The attitude next year will be bet
ter, and past differences will be over
looked. With regard to the present
season, Warren Bovard and I agree
that meetings should be suspended,
and his report to the board of control
convinced them."

Urges Realization of Peace
A. B. Aten, '16, the first speaker of
the evening, discussed "Stopping the
Engines of War." He argued that
peace was being rapidly secured
through advancing civilization, but
this fact had not been realized by the
people of today. The peace problem
could be solved, he said, if the recog
nition of the fact that peace now
actually existed could be secured.
Following him, A. L. Johnson, '16,
spoke on "Evolutionary Aspects of
International Arbitration." He traced
the growing movement for peace, be
ginning with the first Hague confer
ence, and maintained that peace would
only be an actuality when the people
were ready for it. By education of the
nations in the doctrines of peace and
by compulsory arbitration he claimed
the great problem would soon be
solved.
A. L. Morosco, '16, declared that "The
Economic Foundation of Peace" should
interest all peace makers. If the
world were combined into a great in
dustrial organization with representa
tives from all countries so as to form
a Hague conference upon an economic
basis. Morosco declared that war
would pass out of the future annals oi
history.
Dangers of Press Considered
"Journalism and International
Peace" was the subject of C. W. Ide's
address. His solution was the control
of the press. The war with Spain was
cited as an example of a newspaper
conflict. An international congress or
editors who would adopt a distinct
policy of peace would prevent future
warfare, he declared.
L. Clayton, '1.1, taking as his sub
ject. "War and Manhood," contrasted
the soldiers of former times with
those of today, showing that present
war degrades manhood. Through a
development of manhood by education
he argued that the problem would be
solved.

to dissatisfaction with the manner in
which athletic meets have been con

Angeles, and to extreme partisan con
troversy in the press of northern
and southern California.
Wilcox made the following state
ment yesterday afternoon: "As long
as competition between the two uni
versities is not of a wholesome nature,
it is best to let it ride over for a
year. The sentiment in the student
body here is largely caused by undue
discussion in the papers, and a meet
ing at present would be more a fight
than a competition.

"So far as talk of calling off athletic
relations permanently goes, that is all
bosh. There never has been an ath
letic agreement between Stanford and
Southern California. An attempt has
been made to favor friendly competi
tion by going south. The competition
was friendly until last year at the time
of the track meet 011 Bovard Field.
The attitude next year will be bet
ter, and past differences will be over
looked. With regard to the present
season, Warren Bovard and I agree
that meetings should be suspended,
and his report to the board of control
convinced them."
J. G. Emerson, gr., won the annual
Edward Berwick Junior Peace Prize
of fifty dollars from a field of seven
competitors at the chapel last Friday
evening. In a forceful and logical
disputation he presented the theme
"America and Peace in the Orient." A
summary of this speech follows:
"The seat of all future international
wars lies in the Orient. It is inevitable
that the conflict should take place in
China. In anticipation of this fact,
Japan, the southern antagonist, is
taxing her citizens one-fourth of all
their net earnings. Russia on the
north through her Siberian railroad
is waiting for the opportunity to seize
a port on the Pacific. The whole
world in time will be involved in a
great international struggle. The
solution of this problem lies with the
United States, since she is so situated
as to be able to intervene in
Oriental politics."
