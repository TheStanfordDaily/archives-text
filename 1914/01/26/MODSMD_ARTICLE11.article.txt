# BOOSTING FOR THE INTERSCHOLASTIC
## 
### 
It is with the deepest gratification that we note that the inter
scholastic board of governors lias announced a definite, tangible means
by which every one of us may aid in furthering the interests of the meet.
This event is one of such high standing and beneficial influence in the
field of preparatory school athletics that it is at once a pleasure and an
honor to have a hand in it even in the slightest degree. Again, loyal
Stanford men and women will put their hearts into boosting for the meet
because it is the most effective single means of recruiting for their alma
mater. The interscholastic board should be snowed under by a flood of
responses to the appeal published in the news columns of today's issue.
Is their any valid reason why our interest should stop there? When
we have dropped a line to our home town editor our work for the inter
schlastic is not necessarily done. Individual solicitation, individual
thought â€”all these will be in order until the last preparatory school pole
vaulter has hit the sawdust. No doubt the board of governors would
gladly accept the products of "individual thought" in the form of sug
gestions for the betterment of the meet. To start the ball a-rolling is
a suggestion that illustrated souvenir programs be provided for distri
bution among the athletes. These could be cheaply prepared by the use
of cuts in possession of this and other local publications. If adorned
with characteristic and beautiful scenes "on the Farm" they might well
become prized keepsakes which would put a little of the "Stanford
Spirit" in the hearts not only of our visitors but their friends at home.
