# JOHN L. McNAB SPEAKS TO AUDIENCE OF STANFORD MEN
## Second Sunday Evening Address for Men is Given in Encina Club Room. 
### 
"The Crusader of Common Life"
was the theme of John L. McNab's ad
| dress before the men of the university
Sunday evening. In his preliminary
remarks he drew a picture of the
chivalrous spirit of the crusades of
the middle ages. This served as a
background for the "Modern crusader
of common life."
"Life begins in the cradle and ends
in the grave," and between these two
extremes transpires what we call
career. Money may give a temporary
advantage, but character is the more
lasting credit. Character must not be
confused with reputation, which is
merely the character that people im
pute to us.
"For the one who dies a hero to
the music of the bugle and mourned
by the multitude, ten thousand heroes
go to solitary graves. Fathers and
mothers for their children, men and
women for their fellow beings, sacri
fice their lives and would be surprised
if they were called heroes. These are
the greatest heroes because they die
unheralded. It is their example that
adds something to the stature of
human life."
Several illustrations of such ex
amples were given by the speaker,
after which he continued:
"You hear that this world is going
to the bad. That is because we re
gard the notoriety that reaches the
papers as if it were the expression of
modern life. But it is not the true
course of human events. You never
read in the modern press of the man
who is paying his bills and raising his
children in respectability. That is too
much the common ordinary thing to
feature in a newspaper.
"Men of honor, men who will not
lie, men who have opinions and will
express them, men whom the lust of
office will not spoil, these are the de
mands that modern life- makes on the
crusader of common life."
A short musical program preceded
the address. J. W. Bennett, '15, gave
a vocal solo, "Oh, Promise Me."
"Sweet Miss Mary" was sung as an
encore. Two violin selections were
played by D. E. Shepherdson, ''17,
"Schon Rosmarin" and Abertross Ma
zurka by Wieniawski.
