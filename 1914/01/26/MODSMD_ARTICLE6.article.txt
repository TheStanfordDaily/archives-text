### 
Tentative plans for the new library,
as shown by Librarian G. T. Clark be
fore the Faculty Forum on Friday
evening, call for a two story building
similar in design to our present build
ings, which will form a part of the
proposed second quadrangle between
the Quad and Encina.
To secure the best lighting facilities
the reading room will be placed on the
second floor, and will be accessible
from the ground floor by two broad
stairways.
The plans call for eight tiers of
stacks, the second floor being oppo
site the fourth stack. Students of the
higher courses who make use of the
stacks on the first floor will have the
use of tables between them, and
seminar rooms will be arranged just
off the reference room.
Librarian Clark favors the general
library system and is opposed to the
department system now in use here.
In the standard library a room is set
aside for reference, and as all good
books are there, wise selection is stim
ulated. In the departmental system
books are easily lost, and the appor
tionment of funds to the departments
often works hardship to some of them.
