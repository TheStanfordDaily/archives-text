# INTEDSCH [iligible] TO BE GIVEN PUBLICITY
## NEW ADVERTISING SCHEME IS DEVISED BY GOVERNORS. Students Will be Asked to Secure Cooperation of Editors in Home Towns. 
### 
In order to make the ninth annual
interscholastic track and tennis meet
at Stanford the most successful that
has been held since the founding of
the event in 1906, the Board of Gov
ernors has devised a system of adver
tising that is calculated to attract a
larger number of high school athletes
than have ever entered into competi
tion here in past years.
The city newspapers of the coast
constitute the chief medium through
which such an enterprise may be pro
moted, and in order to secure cooper
ation from the daily papers in the
towns from which teams might be
entered, students registering from
such towns are requested to aid the
Board of Governors by writing a short,
energetic letter to the newspaper
editor of the town from which they
come, explaining the necessity of ad
vertising the meet, and asking him to
give prominence to the articles
which will be sent to him at ten-day
intervals from Stanford.
