# PRE-PANAMA TO PRESENT SCENE OF TROPICAL CITY
## EXPERT OFFICIALS WILL HAVE CHARGE OF ALIENS. kewpie Dolls are to Conduct Gay Booths Along the Street of Panama. 
### 
The new alien laws will go into
effect on Saturday, the thirty-first,
when the canal is opened at the Pre-
Panama Exposition. There will be a
chance to experience and criticize the
activity of Uncle Sam in enforcing
such laws as quarantine, customs and
immigration. It will be convenient to
have the ships arrive at the wharf
any time after three o'clock in the
afternoon. Only expert officials will
be on hand to arrange for landing so
that a very slight delay will be neces
sary before entering the city of Pan
ama.
All aliens and those wishing to
escape custom duties can land with
out trouble by checking their hats,
coats, and possibly umbrellas at the
station provided for that purpose
This is a new institution that will be
appreciated by all travellers and espe
cially by those who attended the expo
sition last year.
The street of Panama that leads
from the wharf to the canal is a mas
terpiece of tropical beauty. Little
shops line its sides where both neces
sities and luxuries may be found.
Pretty girls in fancy costumes will
supply all comers with popcorn, ser
pentines and such indispensibles
while the women of Panama will offer
such rare and delicious confections as
home made pies and cakes.
Kewpie dolls dressed in the latest
fashion as well as the earliest will
have a whole shop devoted to their
particular needs. The great signifi
cance of these little visitors is that
the Kewpie smile will be the one worn
during the whole exposition.
