# GOOD SPEAKERS AND MORE OF THEM

That which is purely "highbrow" does not appeal to the average
Stanford man. When an assembly hall speaker occupies the morning
hours in marshalling an array of subtle and metaphysical nothings he
invites the drooping eyelid and the half-concealed yawn. Vet the
Stanford man does appreciate a thoughtful and direct discussion of the
actualities of life. If this presentation be garbed in eloquence, so much
the better. Witness the consideration which has been accorded those
men whom the Y. M. C. A. has brought to Stanford in this and previous
years to discuss vital problems. Formerly the Cosmopolitan Club pur
sued a similar commendable policy. In more recent times the engineers
in their assemblies have carried out the principle. Now there are at
Stanford many societies which, though private in their form of organ
ization, may in the larger view be considered as "public service" or
''quasi public service" organizations. Such societies have the oppor
tunity and privilege of bringing to the campus from time to time men
who, in open addresses, can interest and instruct not only the members
of •the particular organization, but the students at large. To such
societies we commend the thought that no small measure of the value
and pleasure of a college course may be derived in an extra-curriculum
manner.
