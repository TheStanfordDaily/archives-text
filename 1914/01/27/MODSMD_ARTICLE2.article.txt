# SOPHOMORE CLASS FAVORS CORN COBS FOR FRESHMEN
## Nominations for the 1916 Class Officers Postponed Until Further Notice. 
### 
The suggestion of Skull and Snakes
society that Freshmen be permitted
to smoke corncob pipes on the campus
was ratified by the Sophomore class at
its meeting this afternoon.
Both the Junior and Sophomore
classes have passed favorably on the
suggestion and it remains now only
for the Senior class to endorse the
anti-cigarette sentiment.
The new ruling will probably go into
effect, if passed, next semester.
Nominations for 1916 class officers
were postponed for several weeks.
