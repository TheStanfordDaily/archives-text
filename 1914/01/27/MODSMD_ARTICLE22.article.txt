# BERWICK PEACE ORATION HAS EXCITED DISCUSSION
## HASTY CRITICISM MADE CONCERNING EMERSON'S ADDRESS. Winner of Berwiek Contest Presents Summary of Arguments Advanced. 
### 
The oration by J. (1. Emerson, gr.,
which won the Berwick Peace Prize
Contest Saturday evening has created
unusual discussion as it bears on mat
ters of particular interest to the Paci
fic Coast states. Since a hasty consid
eration of Emerson's address would
seem to convict him of "jingoism," a
fuller summary of the true purport of
his remarks is presented. Emerson's
title was "America and Peace in the
Orient."
This oration revealed the obvious
but much neglected fact that half the
world's population dwell upon the con
tinent of Asia; that the world peace
problem is, in a large degree, the
problem of peace in the Orient. The
gravity of the situation has been un
derestimated. Assurances of peace
have been accepted in lieu of conclu
sions suggested by the inherent diffi
culties of the problem. If one-half the
world's population, presenting funda
mental differences in race and creed,
already conflicting in their national
policies, can struggle upward side by
side, without friction, they will have
done something entirely unparalleled
in the history of the supposedly more
enlightened "other half."
The oration painted the dark side
of the picture because no plan for
world peace can be a proper plan
which does not comprehend the rea
sonable and even remote possibilities
of the situation. The possibilities of a
future war in Asia was therefore the
dominant note of the speech.
The plan presented concerned the
wisdom of granting Philippine inde
pendence. The oration was written in
view of this pending change in., our
Philippine policy. America's influence
in the Orient was pointed out, a note
worthy proof thereof being the preven
tion of the partitioning of China.
America has a mission in the Orient,
the accomplishment of which depends
in no small measure upon the position
of vantage which she holds in the
Philippines, was the conclusion.
