# MASQUERS COMEDY SCENES ARE DISPLAYED ON QUAD
## DAILY REHEARSALS ARE NOW IN PROGRESS. T.E. Workman, â€™14, Chosen to Portray Vagaries of Genial Sergeant. 
### 
Group pictures of the "Quality
Street" cast in costume, illustrating
numerous tableaus of humorous,
romantic and dramatic appeal have
been placed on the Quad. These, with
the quaint sketches of scenes and
people in the comedy already exhibited
give some indication of the fun, dash,
and whimsical pathos of the play.
The first rehearsal of the first act of
the comedy was held in the Assembly
Hall Saturday. Under the direction
of Coach Mathieu, daily rehearsals
will be held until February G The
members of the cast have their parts
letter perfect now, and each act will
be prepared separately until the
proper "business" and acquaintance
with the settings have been acquired.
The part of the "Recruiting
Sergeant," a man of the unusual pro
pensity for getting handouts from the
handsome kitchen maids of Quality
Street, has been assigned to T. E.
Workman, '14. This role of a bluster
ing recruiting officer in the Napoleonic
period is rich in farce comedy. Work
man's sister, Miss G. Workman, '12,
was prominent in Stanford dramatics.
