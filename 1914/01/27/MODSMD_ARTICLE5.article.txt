# STANFORD STUDENTS WILL HELP EXTERMINATE PESTS
## Campaign Against Hordes of Mosquitoes to be Waged to the Death. 
### 
Students in the Entomology depart
ment will take an active part in the
mosquito extermination campaign,
now being waged by San Mateo coun
ty. L. Whitney, manager of the Leslie
Salt Refining company, and in charge
of the control work, has arranged with
Professor R. W. Doane of the Ento
mology department and consulting ex
pert for the campaign, to have the stu
dents do the inspection work in reg
ular shifts.
San Mateo county carried on a cam
paign of this nature last year in San
Mateo and Burlingame with satisfac
tory results. This year the territory
will be extended so that it will in
clude the marshes as far as the county
line which extends below Palo Alto to
the Embarcadero road. The work has
a direct connection with Stanford, as
the hordes of insect posts, which
swarm about the Quad, come from the
region, covered by the work.
