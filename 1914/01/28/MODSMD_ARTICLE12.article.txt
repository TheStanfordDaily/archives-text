# TAKING A RECKONING
## 
### 
Having adopted the above nautical caption, we feel moved to borrow
from Daniel Webster his common-sense advice to mariners. When a
ship has for many days been tossed by wind and wave, said Webster,
it behooves its sailors to pause and take a reckoning. Two years ago
this semester the good ship Student Control was launched by the men of
Stanford. Able pilots have brought it on a successful voyage. Yet at
this time it would not be amiss for us to determine whereabouts we stand,
to cast a glance backwards and forwards, and to see if by any means we
may hold the ship more easily to its course.
The chief trouble with the men's Student Control, plainly stated, is
lack of cooperation. Lack of cooperation is caused bv lack of thorough
understanding between the officials of self-government and the students
at large. The men of the University do not perfectly realize just what
standard of conduct is expected of them in definite instances. They are
not aware of all the considerations which move the Conference and
Council to action. They do not fully appreciate the true significance of
these actions when they have been taken. This is not as it should be.
No form of government, no matter how restricted its field, can reach
its highest efficiency unless those who are governed are partners with
those whom they select to do the governing. The men of Stanford, if
treated with consideration, will in the long run act with consideration,
proving themselves patient and circumspect.
This condition should be squarely faced by a full attendance of
Conference members tomorrow evening. They should consider among
others, one definite question: Shall they, in accordance with a sugges
tion which has been made, urge the proper officials to call a men's
assembly? At this assembly, shall not some means be taken to put be
fore the men of the University a definite statement of the conduct ex
pected from them in various classes of cases—a statement which would
eliminate the "didn't know the rule" plea? Shall not the members of the
Conference and Council ask for suggestions for the handling of prob
lems which confront them? They may well ask for solutions of the
difficult but pressing question as to how the Council may give to the
Conference and to the University public fuller reports of its actions while
still, for the benefit of individuals disciplined, suppressing the names of
such persons.
This lis one important move which, it is to be hoped, will be con
sidered and favored by the Conference tomorrow evening. Other im
portant matters arc to be taken up. For example, a definite formulation
should be made of a policy regarding the question-mark which is faced
by "campus correspondents"—men who, in such cases as the recent one
when students were disciplined by the Council, stand between the devil
and the deep sea, being instructed by their newspapers to procure the
names of the offenders, and being instructed by the Conference for the
protection of such offenders to withhold the names. Such are the
difficulties which must be struggled with. To the Conference—
"Gogetem!"

Conference and Council ask for suggestions for the handling of prob
lems which confront them? They may well ask for solutions of the
difficult but pressing question as to how the Council may give to the
Conference and to the University public fuller reports of its actions while
still, for the benefit of individuals disciplined, suppressing the names of
such persons.
This lis one important move which, it is to be hoped, will be con
sidered and favored by the Conference tomorrow evening. Other im
portant matters arc to be taken up. For example, a definite formulation
should be made of a policy regarding the question-mark which is faced
by "campus correspondents"—men who, in such cases as the recent one
when students were disciplined by the Council, stand between the devil
and the deep sea, being instructed by their newspapers to procure the
names of the offenders, and being instructed by the Conference for the
protection of such offenders to withhold the names. Such are the
difficulties which must be struggled with. To the Conference—
"Gogetem!"
Having adopted the above nautical caption, we feel moved to borrow
from Daniel Webster his common-sense advice to mariners. When a
ship has for many days been tossed by wind and wave, said Webster,
it behooves its sailors to pause and take a reckoning. Two years ago
this semester the good ship Student Control was launched by the men of
Stanford. Able pilots have brought it on a successful voyage. Yet at
this time it would not be amiss for us to determine whereabouts we stand,
to cast a glance backwards and forwards, and to see if by any means we
may hold the ship more easily to its course.
The chief trouble with the men's Student Control, plainly stated, is
lack of cooperation. Lack of cooperation is caused bv lack of thorough
understanding between the officials of self-government and the students
at large. The men of the University do not perfectly realize just what
standard of conduct is expected of them in definite instances. They are
not aware of all the considerations which move the Conference and
Council to action. They do not fully appreciate the true significance of
these actions when they have been taken. This is not as it should be.
No form of government, no matter how restricted its field, can reach
its highest efficiency unless those who are governed are partners with
those whom they select to do the governing. The men of Stanford, if
treated with consideration, will in the long run act with consideration,
proving themselves patient and circumspect.
This condition should be squarely faced by a full attendance of
Conference members tomorrow evening. They should consider among
others, one definite question: Shall they, in accordance with a sugges
tion which has been made, urge the proper officials to call a men's
assembly? At this assembly, shall not some means be taken to put be
fore the men of the University a definite statement of the conduct ex
pected from them in various classes of cases—a statement which would
eliminate the "didn't know the rule" plea? Shall not the members of the
Conference and Council ask for suggestions for the handling of prob
lems which confront them? They may well ask for solutions of the
difficult but pressing question as to how the Council may give to the
Conference and to the University public fuller reports of its actions while
still, for the benefit of individuals disciplined, suppressing the names of
such persons.
