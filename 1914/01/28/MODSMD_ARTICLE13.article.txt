Editor, Daily Palo Alto,
Dear Sir: â€”
In reply to the communication in
last Friday's issue of the Daily Palo
Alto as to "Where Were the Com
bined Clubs" I would like to say in
justice to the members of the Mando
lin Club and myself, that the Mando
lin Club was never more able or will
ing to give a concert before the col
lege public than this year. A little
explanation as to why they did not
appear is therefore necessary.
Plans for a combined concert to be
held December 5, 1913, were made last
semester, but it was later found that

this date was too close to the final
examinations, and the concert was
postponed until this semester.
The next Mandolin Club heard of the
"combined" concert were the placards
on the Quad announcing the Glee Club
entertainment for January 17th. A
few years ago the two clubs worked
together, and took trips together, and
produced a diversity of musical enter
tainment that each, separately, could
not have carried out so successfully.
I, for one, would like to see the
"combined musical clubs" exist as a
reality once more just as much as the
"Alumnus."
"In unity there is Strength."
