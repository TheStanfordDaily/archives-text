# CHANGE MADE IN POLICY OF HARVARD SCHOLARSHP
## 
### 
A change in the method of choosing
from the candidates for the Harvard
Club Scholarship was announced to
day. The Harvard club of San Fran
cisco each year awards to a graduate
of either Stanford or California a five
hundred dollar scholarship for one
year to Harvard's graduate colleges.
For the past three years those wish
ing advanced professional work were
barred, but at the suggestion of Presi
dent Lowell of Harvard they will in
the future have an equal opportunity
with others.
