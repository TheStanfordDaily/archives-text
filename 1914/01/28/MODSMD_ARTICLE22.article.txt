"Resolved, That the Workingman's
Compensation Act should be extended
so as to include agricultural laborers."

G. C. Hoisholt, '14. A. E. Worthy, '15,
as critic of the debate, presented a

suspending twelve Sophomores ex
cited a heated discussion after the
regular debate was over.
The resolution that "The entire
budget system of the United States
should be placed in the hands of a
board of experts appointed by the
President for a long tenure" was de
bated by Euphronia. Senator D. P.

and Senator R. Hirao, '15, led the op
position. No decision was announced

actment of the Three Year Army Bill
