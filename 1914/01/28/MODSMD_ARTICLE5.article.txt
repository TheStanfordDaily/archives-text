# MASQUERS' ACTORS ARE PERFECTING THE ROLES "IN QUALITY STREET"
## 
### 
Tickets for the Masquer's play,
"Quality Street", will be put on sale
February 2. Preparations for the first
dramatic offering of the semester have
already reached a stage of comple
tion that is unusual. Because of the
short time allowed, both the mechan
ical and artistic work of production

Patty, the Irish maid in the home of
the Misses Phoebe "and Susan Throssel
on Quality Street, is a benevolant
tyrant. The foibles of her blarneying
disposition arc portrayed by Miss Mar
jorie Bailey, '14, with an enjoyment
that is contagious.


-Hiss Margery Bailey, '14
