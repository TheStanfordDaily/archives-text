# IRELAND'S TEAM WILL APPEAR HERE SATURDAY
## HARD PLAYING AGGREGATION TO MEET STANFORD Cardinal Line-up Has Not Been Announcedâ€”Substitutes Will be Freely Used. 
### 
Ireland's Independents will be Stan
ford's opponents in Saturday's base
ball game. The San Francisco club
was scheduled to appear here last
Wednesday, but was prevented by the
inclemency of the weather. .
The Stanford line-up has not yet
been decided upon. Doubtless it will
be changed several kimes, as in Wed
nesday's game, and Dent will
probably opening battery, with
Workman on first, McC'loskey on
third, Captain Terry at short and
Halm in center field.

Cliff Ireland will bring a strong
team down from San Francisco. Either
"Babe" Driscoll, Martinoni or Artie
Schimpff will pitch. Kennedy will
play first, Ireland himself will cover
second, Spencer will play third, Fitz
simmons will be on short and "Duffy"
Lewis, Tobin and Swain will scont in
the outfield. Perkins will catch. Ire
land's work on the keystone bag has
always been a feature of his games
and by Saturday he expects to be in
the pink of condition.
Saturday's game will start at 3:15.
Twenty-five cents or the season ticket
will admit.
No umpire has yet been named for
the coming game. Elmer Stricklett
may again officiate.


Pitcher Manic.
