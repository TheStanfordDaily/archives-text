# WOMEN OF UNDERCLASSES MEET IN ANNUAL CONFLICT
## 
### 
Beginning at a banquet in San Jose
and ending in a general encounter
aboard a home-bound owl car, some
scores of underclass women had their
annual "mixer" last evening.
A private carload of jubilant Fresh
men set out at an early hour to at
tend their elaborate spread at tho
Hotel Montgomery. An element of
unrest entered the party with the ad
vent of some Sophomore women, who
refused to be left behind.
The rival class members reached a
truce before University Junction was
passed, and tip-toed to their various
homes.
