# GOOD LUCK TO THE CIRCLE "S"
## 
### 
As sources of pleasurable exercise tennis and soccer are no mean
sports. At Stanford their devotees are not few in number nor lacking
in enthusiasm. In the past the authority of these enthusiasts to for
ward their favorite pastimes has been either lacking or divided. Stan
ford men and women will hear with gratification the news that they
have now banded together in a permanent society, and have by a
thoughtfully drawn plan made it possible for the Executive Committee
to grant them full power to advance the interests of the minor sports
while the committee still retains the financial supervision reposed solely
in it by the Associated Students. In the future tennis and soccer fans
may hope to see the tennis nets in at night and the tennis players out
in the daytime, and the Stanford soccer ball entangled with monotonous
regularity in the meshes of the other team's goal. The Circle "S"
society will be accorded a seat near the head at the family table of
Stanford organizations.
