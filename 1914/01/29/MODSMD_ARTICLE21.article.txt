Editor, Daily Palo Alto,
Dear Sir: —
In past years the Mandolin and Glet
clubs have given combined concerts
and tours. Last semester the Glee
Club was desirous of making a trip.
Little financial support could be gotten
from the student body, and none from
outsiders; but the Glee club persisted,
and financed itself on the Christmas
tour. The last concert was given at
Stanford in answer to the universal
demand to hear the program given on
the tour ,and to defray expenses not
covered by previous proceeds.
The Glee club is willing to com
bine with the Mandolin club in any
concert or tour in which the expenses
will be equally met.
