Editor, Daily Palo Alto,
Dear Sir:â€”
For every rule there is a reason
good or bad. Those rules for which
there is no reason sooner or later die
of enema. So let it be with Ceaser.
That Freshmen should be disciplined
is an axiom. That Sophomores must
be amused is an apparently unavoid
able circumstance. Hence Freshmen
are always given into the charge of
the second year lictors.
That a certain amount of night
work is necessary and greatly bene
ficial to the best welfare of the class,
and that it binds the single units to
gether in one inseparable matrix is an
indisputable fact.
In the Freshman year those classes
are lucky who must spend the night
watches about the bonfire. The Soph
omores have their posts. The Seniors
and Juniors once had the alarms and
excursions of poster night and the
orgy of the plug ugly.
These things have been banished
by the inordinate zeal of some men
who cannot drink of the wine of free
dom without intoxication.
And so with Freshmen tubbing.
The rule against the disciplining of
Freshmen would have died of inaction
if no cases of extraordinary violation
had come up for judgment.
However, series of petty acts culmi
nated in very noticeable contravention
of the ruling, and consequently the
council was bound to act.
Now far be it from the intention of
this article to defend the action of the
council, and incidentally Student Con
trol.
The only defense must be in the
suitability of the institution. If it
needs defense, it is not suitable and
must go. Each man will judge for
himself.
