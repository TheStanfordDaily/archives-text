# PRE-PANAMA POSSIBILITIES REACH SCALE OF GRANDEUR
## Coney Island Amusement Features Will be Set in Scenery of Canal Zone. 
### 
Advance agents for the shows to be
presented at the Pre-Panama Exposi
tion promise great things. Chief
among them, Milpetus Theater offers
Nelly, the Village Queen, or the Curse
of Beauty, with "Danny" Carroll play
ing the lead. This is Carroll's first
appearance on the American stage.
Miss Apply, whose title is so mis
leading that it might be either a lady
or a mistake, is a novelty singing and
dancing "stunt."
A clever dramatization of Alice in
Wonderland by Miss D. Gunnell, '14,
and Miss D. Hume, '17, will be pre
sented by local actors. Punch and
Judy promises to be entertaining, and
the movies are running a problem
play for the occasion.
Dancing is to be one of the fea
tures of the exposition, and will take
place downstairs in one of the large
rooms. Punch will be served in the
dance hall, and ice cream parlors are
just outside the door.
Scenery, accurately copied from
authentic pictures of the Canal, is now
being painted by Miss J. Butler, '13,
Miss S. Moore, '17, and Miss H. Las
key, '15. The canvas, if stretched out,
would be approximately one hundred
yards long. The views will include
the Culebra Cut, the Malaria hospital,
the Capital Building, the ruins of an
old French tower ,a railroad running
through a swamp, an entrance to a
Panama estate, and a wonderfully exe
cuted dredging scene.
"How to go through the exposition
without a guide," a cleverly written
Baedecker, quite essential to the full
enjoyment of the evening is about to
make its appearance. If it is possible
to get it off the press, it will be on
sale on the Quad tomorrow.
