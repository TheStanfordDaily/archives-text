# MINOR SPORTS CONTROL GIVEN CIRCLE-"S" MEN
## EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE GRANTS SOCIETY'S PETITION. Report on Northern Trip Heard from Glee Club Managerâ€”Varsity Debaters Get Medals. 
### 
Control of tennis and soccer, the
two minor sports of the University,
was granted to the newly formed
Circle "S" society last evening by the
Executive Committee. The organiza
tion was formed with the primary pur
pose of assuming the management of
these activities and their petition for
authority to do so was granted on its
presentation to the committee.
The ultimate control of the sports
still remains in the hands of the Exec
utive Committee and all financial mat
ters, such as the purchase of supplies,
will be regulated by it. Permission
of the Committee will also be necessary
for any teams to take trips away from
the campus.
The purpose of last night's action
is to remove the promoting and con
trol of these sports from individuals
alone and to give some official backing
to such activities. The Circle "S" so
ciety presented the following petition:
"The members of the Circle "S" so
ciety petition the Executive Commit
tee of Stanford University to grant to
said society the control of all soccer
and tennis affairs in the University.
"The society asks this for the pur
pose of having some definite well de
fined body whose purpose it shall be
to:
"Promote, regulate and control all
intercollegiate relations between Stan
ford and California relating to soccer
and tennis.
"2. Promote, regulate and control
all interclass, interfraternity and in
terclub games in both sports.
"3. Promote, negotiate and control
all relations appertaining to and con
cerning the minor sports of soccer and
tennis between Stanford and outside
clubs, associations and leagues.
"4. Promote and arouse interest in
soccer and tennis in high schools along
the coast.
"All the above duties will be per
formed under the direction of the
Graduate Manager of Stanford Uni
versity if he sees fit to use his power
as ex-officio member of the society's
executive committee, and furthermore
permission for all trips and such items
of expense must be granted by the
Executive Committee of the Associate
Students.
"The whole purpose of this petition
is to give tennis and soccer some
official backing instead of having both
sports run by individuals as before."
The Executive Committee heard the
general report of the trip taken by the
Glee club during Christmas vacation,
submitted by Manager S. V. Claggett,
'14, and after discussion all action was
deferred until a more detailed report
