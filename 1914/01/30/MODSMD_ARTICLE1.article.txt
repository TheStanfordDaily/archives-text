# CHAS. G. LATHROP RESIGNS OFFICE OF BUSINESS MANAGER
## 
### 
Charles G. Lathrop to
day resigned as business
manager of the Univer
sity. This he did through
the medium of a letter
presented to the Trus
tees late this afternoon
at the conclusion of their
regular meeting. The
resignation was accepted
with regret. The retir
ing Business Manager
will continue as Treas
urer of the University
and of course as a Life
Member of the Board of
Trustees.
11l health is the sole
cause of the resignation.
Treasurer Lathrop is a
sufferer from nephritis,
which almost incapaci
tates him from active
pursuits. Two years ago
he attempted to resign,
but continued in his po
sition as Business Man
ager at the urgent re
quest of the Board of
Trustees.
Charles Lathrop began
his services as Treasurer
of Stanford University
111 1892, upon the solici
tation of Senator and
Mrs. Stanford. Upon the
'death of his sister, Mrs.
Stanford, he was con
tinued in the capacity by
the Trustees, and has so
served to the present
date.
No action looking to
ward the choice of his
successor was taken at
the Board of Trustees

meeting this afternoon. The resigna
tion came as a decided surprise to
those on the campus most closely in
touch with the business affairs of the
University, and, it is believed, to all
concerned.
The loiter of resignation follows:
"Stanford University,
"January 150, 1914.
"The Board of Trustees,
"Leland Stanford Junior University.
"Gentlemen:
"In 1X92, after my brother's de
parture for the East. Governor Stan
ford placed me in charge of his busi
ness as Manager.
"In June, IS9IJ, the Governor sud
denly passed away, and my sister,
who according to his will acted as
executrix, honored me with the same
position.
"After Mrs. Stanford's death 1 was
asked by the Trustees to continue the
same work as Business Manager for
the University.
"During all these years 1 have tried
to serve the interests of the I'niver
sity faithfully and to discharge the
duties of the position to the best of
my ability.
"For the last two years, however,
I have felt that I have not been in a

'condition physically to give the work
the attention it. requires, and I there
fore desire to be relieved of the du
ties which I have been discharging
in my capacity as Business Manager
for the Hoard of Trustees. My with
drawal from this olllce would be a
relief to me, and I am sure would
serve the interests of all concerned.
"1 thank you all most sincerely for
the kind consideration you have
shown me during all these years.
"I remain.
"Very respectfully yours,
(Signed) "CHAS. G. LATHROP."

with an ntter disregard of his personal interests. The I'niversitv has
always been first and hi> private affairs second. I lis whole thought has
been for the I'niversitv and for carrying out his sister's plans and
desires. Po this work he has devoted himself with utter faithfulness
and integrity."â€”Statement by President Hopkins of the Hoard of
