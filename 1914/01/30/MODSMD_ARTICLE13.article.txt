# TRACK SEASON WILL OPEN WITH TWO RELAY RACES
## 
### 
Activity on the Stanford track will
be in full swing on Saturday morn
ing. 80 athletes will compete in two
relay races as the initial event of the
spring season. This plan was adopted
two years ago when runners were di
vided into teams for the purpose of
getting acquainted with each other in
competition and also in order that the
coaches might see the men together
in action.
There will be ten teams with eight
runners on a team. The athletes will
be divided into two classes, class A
and class B. The former division is
to include all sprinters and 440 men,
while the second division will be made
up of half-mile, mile and two mile
runners. Six teams will compete in
class A, each entry running a furlong,
while the distance athletes are to be
divided into four teams, each con
testant to run one lap around the
track.
No varsity men will compete. The
relay race is primarily for new men
and those who have never won their
letter. There will be no competition
between the athletes in field events
All who are training in the track
events are expected to report at the
oval not later than ten o'clock on
Saturday morning.
The members of the Coaching Com
mittee are requested to be at the
training house to act as officials. The
relay races will start at 10:15.
The wind of the early part of the
week and the sun of the last few days
has added materially in drying out the
track so that it will be in fairly good
condition tomorrow. At no time dur
ing the rainy season has it been neces
sary to stop daily work-outs. Although
soft at times, the excellent drainage
system has made regular training
possible.
