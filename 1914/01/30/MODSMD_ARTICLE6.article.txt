# CONFERENCE MAKES RULES ON SUSPENSION NOTICES
## DESIRE PUBLICITY FOR FACTS INSTEAD OF NAMES. Action Also Taken on Boating Regulations and Report from Bookstore Manager Heard. 
### 
Action to prevent all publication
ol' the names ol' students placed on
suspension or expelled from the Uni
versity by the Council but to allow
greater publicity to the facts of the
cases resulting in punishment was
taken yesterday by the University
Conference.
Student correspondents have not
been allowed to send in the names
of men on whom such punishment has
been inflicted to their newspapers, but
the publications have often obtained
the names from other sources and in
cluded them in their news stories,
it was to stop up these outside sources
of information that last evening's
rules were passed.
Hereafter the Council will be al
lowed to postpone all notice of ex
pulsion as long as it may see Jit to
do so. When the notice does appear
it will then he less easy to tell who
the man expelled was..
Deferring the notice of the suspen
sion will make it possible to publish
all the facts ol' the case short of ac
tual identification of the student, with
out the name becoming known. From
the details the public will be able to
see the work of the Conference in its
efforts to enforce student control at
Stanford. In case where several
students are being disciplined for the
same offense, the time of their sus
pension may be made to begin at dif
ferent dates, so that all the offenders
will not be absent from the campus
at the same time. This will also tend
to make it. difficult to determine the
men who have been affected by the
action.
Provision was made last evening
also for the drafting of new regula
tions to cover boating on the lake.

Action to prevent all publication
ol' the names ol' students placed on
suspension or expelled from the Uni
versity by the Council but to allow
greater publicity to the facts of the
cases resulting in punishment was
taken yesterday by the University
Conference.
Student correspondents have not
been allowed to send in the names
of men on whom such punishment has
been inflicted to their newspapers, but
the publications have often obtained
the names from other sources and in
cluded them in their news stories,
it was to stop up these outside sources
of information that last evening's
rules were passed.
Hereafter the Council will be al
lowed to postpone all notice of ex
pulsion as long as it may see Jit to
do so. When the notice does appear
it will then he less easy to tell who
the man expelled was..
Deferring the notice of the suspen
sion will make it possible to publish
all the facts ol' the case short of ac
tual identification of the student, with
out the name becoming known. From
the details the public will be able to
see the work of the Conference in its
efforts to enforce student control at
Stanford. In case where several
students are being disciplined for the
same offense, the time of their sus
pension may be made to begin at dif
ferent dates, so that all the offenders
will not be absent from the campus
at the same time. This will also tend
to make it. difficult to determine the
men who have been affected by the
action.
Provision was made last evening
also for the drafting of new regula
tions to cover boating on the lake.
