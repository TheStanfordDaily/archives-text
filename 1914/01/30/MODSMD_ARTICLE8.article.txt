# CHARLES G. LATHROP

It is with mingled feelings that we unlock the forms of this edition
after it is on the press to announce the resignation of Charles G. Lathrop
as Business Manager of the University. Air. Lathrop in his official
connection with the University has been the last living link to bind the
Stanford of today with that man of statesmanlike genius and that
woman of noble heart after whose son the University takes its name.
Yet the action of this afternoon does not require that we should sound
this mournful note too loud. Mr. Lathrop remains as Treasurer of the
University and a Life Member of 'its Board of I rustees.
The loyalty and integrity with which this man has rendered service
to the University could but with difficulty be overestimated. Of more
recent years his effectiveness has been impaired by poor health. In
recognizing this fact Treasurer Lathrop has demonstrated his self
sacrificing loyalty in a manner which we on the farm like to think is
typical of Stanford men and women, whether of the student body, fac
ulty or business management. A man who could not have done the
pioneer work accomplished by the resigning Business Manager may
yet have greater physical strength to cope with the hurly-burly of pro
gressive business of today. The Daily Palo Alto wishes to second the
sentiments of the Trustees in accepting the resignation with expres
sions of regret.
