# STANFORD ALUMNI PLAN UNIQUE ORGANIZATION
## "CHILDREN OK THE PIONEER CLASS" IS NAME. Graduates of '95 Will League Their Children for Benefiit of Alma Mater. 
### 
Plans are forming for a Stanford
organziation that will probably be
unique in the experience of American
colleges.
"Children of the Pioneer Class" is
to be the name of the society, and it
is to be recruited in Stanford only
from the sons and daughters of the
members of that venturing aggrega
tion of more than four hundred
strange freshmen who came from
many parts of the world in 1891 and
formed the initial student body at a
new university that was world-famous
even before it opened its doors Octo
ber first of that year.
The pioneers claim they already
have among them enough children
to furnish several score members to
the Stanford classes that will be grad
uating in the decade between 1920 and
1930.
The object of the society is to re
vive some of the associations that
made the old class of '95 —so Chancel
lor Jordan has said —the most re
markable class that ever entered an
American college, to recruit mutually
from pioneer stock, and to perpetuate
pioneer enthusiasms.
Already two children of Stanford's
pioneer class have entered the uni
versity. They are sisters and members
of the present freshman class of 1917,
Yaal Stark and Dare Stark. Although
they were born in South Africa, where
their father was a mining engineer, the
old loyalty to their parents resulted in
the spanning of thousands of miles to
attain a Stanford training. Both their
parents were members of the pioneer
class ,and they were married in their
senior year.
Girls seem to predominate, thus far,
among the children of the pioneer
class, though not so alarmingly as to
threaten the five hundred limit. Scott
Calhoun and Archie Rice, widowers,
and former editors of The Daily Palo
Alto, have little girls who expect some
day to be Stanford students; Jack
Sheehan, varsity baseball captain, and
his wife have two girls and a boy;
Jimmy Hollister and his wife, Dorothy
Steffens Hollister, both members of
the class of '95, have twin boys; Her
bert C. Hoover ,now a trustee, and his
Stanford wife have two boys, born in
England but now in Palo Alto, school
ing to be future Stanford students;
Lewis Smith lias a girl and a boy;
Sam Simmons and his Stanford wife
have a girl and a boy; and these are
but a few of the dozen that look for
ward to the time they too may go to
the Stanford of which their parents
talk. Even at the present time there
are several children of Stanford
pioneers but a few years from high
school graduation in Palo Alto.
A pin is to be designed to identify
the wearer as a Stanford matriculate,
one or both of whose parents had
membership in Stanford's first clans.

are several children of Stanford
pioneers but a few years from high
school graduation in Palo Alto.

Plans are forming for a Stanford
organziation that will probably be
unique in the experience of American
colleges.
"Children of the Pioneer Class" is
to be the name of the society, and it
is to be recruited in Stanford only
from the sons and daughters of the
members of that venturing aggrega
tion of more than four hundred
strange freshmen who came from
many parts of the world in 1891 and
formed the initial student body at a
new university that was world-famous
even before it opened its doors Octo
ber first of that year.
The pioneers claim they already
have among them enough children
to furnish several score members to
the Stanford classes that will be grad
uating in the decade between 1920 and
1930.
The object of the society is to re
vive some of the associations that
made the old class of '95 —so Chancel
lor Jordan has said —the most re
markable class that ever entered an
American college, to recruit mutually
from pioneer stock, and to perpetuate
pioneer enthusiasms.
Already two children of Stanford's
pioneer class have entered the uni
versity. They are sisters and members
of the present freshman class of 1917,
Yaal Stark and Dare Stark. Although
they were born in South Africa, where
their father was a mining engineer, the
old loyalty to their parents resulted in
the spanning of thousands of miles to
attain a Stanford training. Both their
parents were members of the pioneer
class ,and they were married in their
senior year.
Girls seem to predominate, thus far,
among the children of the pioneer
class, though not so alarmingly as to
threaten the five hundred limit. Scott
Calhoun and Archie Rice, widowers,
and former editors of The Daily Palo
Alto, have little girls who expect some
day to be Stanford students; Jack
Sheehan, varsity baseball captain, and
his wife have two girls and a boy;
Jimmy Hollister and his wife, Dorothy
Steffens Hollister, both members of
the class of '95, have twin boys; Her
bert C. Hoover ,now a trustee, and his
Stanford wife have two boys, born in
England but now in Palo Alto, school
ing to be future Stanford students;
Lewis Smith lias a girl and a boy;
Sam Simmons and his Stanford wife
have a girl and a boy; and these are
but a few of the dozen that look for
