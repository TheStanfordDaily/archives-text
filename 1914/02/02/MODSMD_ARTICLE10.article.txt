If two or more persons southeasterly bound should meet two or
more persons northwesterly bound upon the sidewalk which runs along
the Row, and all the parties of the first part and all the parties of the
second part should attempt to continue in their course without removing
their pedal extremities from the sidewalk, the net resultant would be
similar to the hypothetical calamity of the irresistible force and the im
movable object. There is room for nothing but criticism upon these side
walks which one man doth bestride like a Colossus. Yet we do not in
tend to criticise the powers that be for in due course the evil will presum
ably be remedied. For the present, while we are doomed to walk the
straight and narrow path, let us exercise a bit of that courtesy which
distinguishes America from those countries where the bored pedestrian
brushes the man of lesser dignity from the sidewalk. The spectacle of
two or three men walking abreast and forcing a passing woman to step
from the sidewalk makes us hot under the collar. Let's be gentlemen.
