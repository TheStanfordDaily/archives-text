It is not according to Hoylc to use a twelve-inch gun on a mosquito.
But this column, which in past years has hurled broadsides of invective
against domination, tyrany and rowdyism, must now descend to take a
pot-shot at the person who stole the electric light bulbs after the Pre-
Panama Saturday evening. If this individual does not like being called
a mosquito he will upon application be met by a select committee which
will call him several less complimentary thingsâ€”unless he brings the
bulbs along with him.
