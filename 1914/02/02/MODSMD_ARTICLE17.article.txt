on Friday, February 6. This contest
is open to all the men of Stanford,

been to match the successful con
testant against the winner of the pre
ceeding year, for possession of the
trophy. As L. D .Sweet, '13, who was
victorious in the last match, is not in
college this year, the belt will go by
default to the winner of the tourna
ment.
The trophy has changed hands
many times. Among the holders have
been W. F. Dunn ,'O4, three years, A.
B. Cox, '08, two years, J. H. Wiggins,
*10 .three years and V. L. Sheldon, '15,
one year.
