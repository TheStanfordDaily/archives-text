# CHAPLAIN GARDNER SHOWS WAY TO ATTAIN A HIGHER PLANE
## Prayer and Its Value is Sunday Topic of the University Rector. 
### 
Choosing for his text, "When Ye
Pray, say, 'Our Father,'" Rev. D.
Charles Gardner gave a stirring ser
mon in the Memorial Church yester
day. The communion service was fea
tured by appropriate music. A solo
by Miss D. Stillman, and "Praise Ye
the Father," by the choir, being
rendered.
"My critics tell me," said Dr. Gard
ner, "that recent sermons on self
consecration and temptation have left
a sense of inability to live up to such
a standard of character and conduc 1 12.
They ask why I have not emphasized
the helps to the Christian life and
especially they ask me the value ol
prayer."
"The psychological basis of prayer
is our sense of need and our instinc
tive sense of God," he went on.
"Children possess this sense to per
fection. To children it is perfectly
natural to talk to God. No self-con
sciousness or self-reproach hinders
their speech. Alas! too many of us
lost in youth this instinct and habit.
The upward push of new physical
powers, the strain and stress of men
tal and moral readjustments, the
claims of work and pleasure, and the
abundant satisfaction of mere living
seems to crowd out the habit and the
instinct of prayer. I admit that you
may be dutiful, happy, useful men
and women and yet not say your pray
ers. But 1 dare not tell you that the
prayerless life is the best sort of life.
"What ever may be your habits, this
is sure: It is the characteristic of
men to pray. History proves that.
The instinct of prayer is ancient and
universal. Men have always prayed.
It is not merely asking for things, it
is not merely the voicing of the soul's
needs, but it is an act of loving ador
ation to the majesty of God in praise
and thanksgiving. Prayer is the na
tural expression of our sense of har
mony with the spirit of the Universe,
our anxiety in the face of trouble, our
cry in the presence of distress.
"Christ's life and thought are
vibrant with the consciousness of
God, and the natural expression of
that consciousness is prayer. What
else do you know which better illu
mines "the solemn deeps of life" than
the Lord's prayer? Whatever will
help you in the spiritual growth of
struggle, repentance and aspiration,
help you to be true to your own best
self, true to the will of God as your
best self interprets that will, must be
good. After all prayer conducts us
into a realm of ideas and ideals in
troduced by man's philosophy. In
deed prayer is the only adequate ex
pression for some of the profound
moments of human life. Another thing
wrought by prayer is moral perspec
tive. Power is another result. If you
would find peace and poise of mind
amid the clatter of modern thought,
if you would prepare for sorrow and
suffering when it comes—lift up your
heart and voice to God. Tell Him,
your Father, and your Friend, all
your joys and hopes and aspirations."

and women and yet not say your pray
ers. But 1 dare not tell you that the
prayerless life is the best sort of life.
"What ever may be your habits, this
is sure: It is the characteristic of
men to pray. History proves that.
The instinct of prayer is ancient and
universal. Men have always prayed.
It is not merely asking for things, it
is not merely the voicing of the soul's
needs, but it is an act of loving ador
ation to the majesty of God in praise
and thanksgiving. Prayer is the na
tural expression of our sense of har
mony with the spirit of the Universe,
our anxiety in the face of trouble, our
cry in the presence of distress.
"Christ's life and thought are
vibrant with the consciousness of
God, and the natural expression of
that consciousness is prayer. What
else do you know which better illu
mines "the solemn deeps of life" than
the Lord's prayer? Whatever will
help you in the spiritual growth of
struggle, repentance and aspiration,
help you to be true to your own best
self, true to the will of God as your
best self interprets that will, must be
good. After all prayer conducts us
into a realm of ideas and ideals in
troduced by man's philosophy. In
deed prayer is the only adequate ex
pression for some of the profound
moments of human life. Another thing
wrought by prayer is moral perspec
tive. Power is another result. If you
would find peace and poise of mind
amid the clatter of modern thought,
if you would prepare for sorrow and
suffering when it comes—lift up your
heart and voice to God. Tell Him,
your Father, and your Friend, all
your joys and hopes and aspirations."
Choosing for his text, "When Ye
Pray, say, 'Our Father,'" Rev. D.
Charles Gardner gave a stirring ser
mon in the Memorial Church yester
day. The communion service was fea
tured by appropriate music. A solo
by Miss D. Stillman, and "Praise Ye
the Father," by the choir, being
rendered.
"My critics tell me," said Dr. Gard
ner, "that recent sermons on self
consecration and temptation have left
a sense of inability to live up to such
a standard of character and conduc 1 12.
They ask why I have not emphasized
the helps to the Christian life and
especially they ask me the value ol
prayer."
"The psychological basis of prayer
is our sense of need and our instinc
tive sense of God," he went on.
"Children possess this sense to per
fection. To children it is perfectly
natural to talk to God. No self-con
sciousness or self-reproach hinders
their speech. Alas! too many of us
lost in youth this instinct and habit.
The upward push of new physical
powers, the strain and stress of men
tal and moral readjustments, the
claims of work and pleasure, and the
abundant satisfaction of mere living
seems to crowd out the habit and the
instinct of prayer. I admit that you
may be dutiful, happy, useful men
and women and yet not say your pray
ers. But 1 dare not tell you that the
prayerless life is the best sort of life.
