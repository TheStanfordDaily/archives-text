# STANFORD GRADUATES FROM SIBERIA RETURN TO WORK
## Turner Meets a Vasherwisokaprevoshodietelswaâ€”Lanagan Goes to London. 
### 
From Siberia conies T. N. Turner,
'11, with talks of his work in that
country.
Turner was working with W. H.
Lanagan, '04, a fellow graduate of the
Geology and Mining department. Dr.
N. T. McArthur was also in the
country.
The Stanford men were working for
the Orsk Goldfields, Ltd., of London.
This firm is carrying on gold dredge
mining at Colchen.
The trip in occupied forty days.
From Japan they went to Vladivos
tock and from there over the Trans-
Siberian railroad to Habarovsk, then
700 miles to Nikolviesk on the Amor
and 60 miles to the mine. Nikolaviesk
is open four months in the summer.
Scott got his dogs from this port.
Turner tells of many experiences.
While at the mine the Vaseruwisoka
prevoshodiekelswa called upon them.
This gentleman is a representative of
the government.
Turner describes a particularly in
teresting method of making lanterns
A smoothe flaring bucket is filled with
water. This is allowed to freeze in
a thin layer on the sides, top ami
bottom. The water is then allowed
to pass out through a hole in the top.
The ice compartment is then removed
from the bucket, inverted and a candle
placed within. These last all winter,
the temperature ranging from 96 de
grees above zero to 40 below.
During the absence of Turner and
Lanagan from their house one time it
was set on fire and. all their posses
sions were lost. This was done, it
was thought, by the Hunhoosa, a tribe
of Chinese robber bandits. In order
to get some money at another time
two natives were killed. The method
of dispatch was to split their heads
with an axe while asleep.
On the trip out five days and five
nights were spent on a sled with but
an hour off for eating. Seven hundred
miles were covered thus. The meals
were prepared before hand and frozen.
Meat dumplings known as pilmyenas,
were prepared in the same manner.
During the trip the passport was
lost and 3 days elapsed at Vladivos
tock before a temporary one was pro
cured. This was seized on the
steamer and has not been returned
since.
Turner will register at Stanford
during this semester. Lanagan has
gone to London.
