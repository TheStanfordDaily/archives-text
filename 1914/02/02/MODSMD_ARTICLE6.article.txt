"Is Christianity Applicable to Every
Day Life?" was the topic dealt with
by the Hon. Horace Davis in his ad
dress last evening before a large
audience of University men assembled
in Encina Clubroom.
"Religion is not a temporary emo
tion, as for example the music which
constitutes some peoples' religion. It
I is not a creation of the mind as mathe
-5 matics. It is an atmosphere," he said.

"The object of religion is to put our
selves on friendly relations with
God. Religion must deal with every
day home drudgery.
"Attitude counts more than position.
When you are conscious of your sin
and turn your face toward the King
dom of Heaven, your religion is
justified.
"There is no stationary position in
religion, one is either going up or
down. It means work. Everything
worth while means work. It is often
a struggle to obey one's consciousness,
but if it is so this religion. 'He
who loses his life for conscience' sake
shall find it again."
"Christ has been pictured in many
ways, but as yet no one has pictured
him for us as brave, courageous,
brushing aside all attempts at safety,
giving his life for mankind. Enrole
yourself among the friends of Jesus
and co-workers of God.
"Religion, a growing sentiment
among students throughout the coun
try" was the subject of a short talk
by State Secretary Hill of the Y. M.
C. A.
L. E. Bassett, associate professor of
English, gave two readings, Burns'
"A Man's a Man for a' That."
and "Mulholland's Contract." Music
was furnished by the Mandolin Club.
