# IRELAND'S TEAM TIES STANFORD IN 0-0 GAME
## BATTLE GOES EXTRA INNING IRELAND ABSENT. Maple and Hayes Occupy Box for Varsity—Driscoll and Schimpff Twirl for Visitors. 
### 
Featureless play running into the
tenth inning without a score charac
terized Saturday's game between the
Varsity and Ireland's Independents.
The absence of Cliff Ireland accounts
in part for the lack of action.
Although Stanford outhit the visit
ors the scoring possibilities only once
became acute. When the home team
came to the bat in the last of the
ninth Halm started off with a single.
On a hit Halm was thrown out at sec
ond, Workman gaining first. Landers
advanced Workman to second, and
placed himself on first. Williman
made first on a fielder's choice, while
Landers beat the ball to second. A
throw from the pitcher to third re
tired Workman . Day, who had already
registered two of the six hits credited
to the cardinals, fanned at this point,
and retired the side.
The tenth inning was marked by
a pretty double play when Workman
gathered in a difficult foul tip off the
first base line, and threw to Williman
catching Abies off the base. In this
frame Stanford was retired in one,
two, three order, and the game was
called because of the late hour.
Maple and Hayes divided the time
in the box, both serving five innings.
Each retired three batsmen by the
strikeout route. The former allowed
four of his opponents walks to first.
Hayes showed better form in this re
spect, not giving a single base on
balls. The score follows:

SUMMARY
Two-base hit — Spencer. Stolen
bases —Swain. First base on called
balls—Off Maple, 4; off Driscoll, 1.
Struck out—By Maple, 3: by Hayes,
3; by Driscoll, 7: by Schimpff, 4.
double plays—Workman to Williman.
Umpire—Bob Colturn. Time of game
—Two hours an dten minutes.
Featureless play running into the
tenth inning without a score charac
terized Saturday's game between the
Varsity and Ireland's Independents.
The absence of Cliff Ireland accounts
in part for the lack of action.
Although Stanford outhit the visit
ors the scoring possibilities only once
became acute. When the home team
came to the bat in the last of the
ninth Halm started off with a single.
On a hit Halm was thrown out at sec
ond, Workman gaining first. Landers
advanced Workman to second, and
placed himself on first. Williman
made first on a fielder's choice, while
Landers beat the ball to second. A
throw from the pitcher to third re
tired Workman . Day, who had already
registered two of the six hits credited
to the cardinals, fanned at this point,
and retired the side.
The tenth inning was marked by
a pretty double play when Workman
gathered in a difficult foul tip off the
first base line, and threw to Williman
catching Abies off the base. In this
frame Stanford was retired in one,
two, three order, and the game was
called because of the late hour.
Maple and Hayes divided the time
in the box, both serving five innings.
Each retired three batsmen by the
strikeout route. The former allowed
four of his opponents walks to first.
Hayes showed better form in this re
spect, not giving a single base on
balls. The score follows:
