# ST. MARY'S NINE WILL BE OPPONENT OF VARSITY
## CARDINAL BATTERY HAS NOT BEEN ANNOUNCED. Visitors' Strength Unknownâ€”Few Veterans of Last Year's Series Appear in Catholic Line-up. 
### 
St. Mary's nine will appear on the
Stanford diamond tomorrow in its
first game with the varsity. The col
legians should provide a different
brand of ball than that witnessed at
the week-end exhibition which re
sulted in a scoreless tie.
Announcement ol' the battery to open
tomorrow's contest has been withheld,
hut it is probable that both the Maple-
Dent and Hayes-Landers combinations
will be used against the Catholics.
Workman at first, Stafford at second,
McCloskey at third, and Terry at short
will constitute the infield, while Halm,
Day, and Hover will take the outfield
from left to right in order.
Oscar and Byler will make up the
opposing battery. Guisto, first base;
Cowan, second; Maher, third; Childs,
short; Prentice, left field; Wilson,
center; Maloni, right, completes the
visitors' line-up.
Play will begin at 4:15. The usual
admission of twenty-five cents or a
season ticket will be required.
