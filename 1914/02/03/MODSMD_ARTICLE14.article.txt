# DEBATING

### 
In recent years interest in the art of debate and public speech has
flagged at Stanford. This we well know, for countless speakers and
writers have urged ns to "come out for the debating teams" and to rally
round our chosen forensic representatives. These appeals have proved a
waste of breath and ink. The conclusion is then forced upon those who
would forward debating interests at Stanford that they must accomp
lish this end by working from the inside. They must make the platform
activities so attractive and varied that they will compel attention from
the student body, and force upon the men and women of Stanford the
truth that debating is not only an important form of intercollegiate
activity but a valuable training for any commercial pursuit and an almost
indispensable discipline for success in the legal profession.
As a means to this end of achieving a wider appeal for forensic
work, the addition of events to the debating calendar has proved par
ticularly effective. Since the formation of the Pacific Coast Debating
League the "Tri-State" debates have interested a large number of
comparatively new speakers who have later become strong repre
sentatives of the Cardinal. None of the men chosen yesterday for this
debate have previously represented Stanford against other colleges. So
long as debating activities are not spread out over so wide an area as
to weaken them at all points, we believe that this policy of extension will
arouse increased forensic interest at Stanford.
