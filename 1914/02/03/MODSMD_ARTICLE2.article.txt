# Many Changes Put Stanford Oval in Splendid Shape
## 
### 
With the proposed improvements
having become established facts, the
Stanford oval now ranks with the
finest. The recent alterations in the
arrangement of the cages and stands
have rendered it more commodious
and at present it is well arranged
and cared for.
During the Christmas vacation,
several changes were made. The ham
mer cage was moved beyond the Oval
to allow more freedom of movement,
and was also enlarged. The shot put
ground was transferred to the site of
the old hammer stand.
Within the track house the lockers
were rearranged with an idea of con
venience, and new quarters for Trainer
11. W. Maloney installed. The location
of the trainer here enables him to give
personal supervision to the athletes.
The cinder path has dried out from
the recent rains and has been leveled
and dragged until it is in prime con
dition. It is now the idea to extend
the turf stretch, which at present is
only 220 yards long, to the full quarter
mile length. This stretch is admirably
adapted to early season training.
It is also phinncd to replace the old
wire fence that stood between the
track and bleachers with a modern
iron bar fence.
Around the outside of the track has
been planted a row of red geraniums,
and the inner rim has been lined with
a bank of purple myrtle. Under the
watchful care of "Sam," these are
thriving.
