# STANFORD MEN CONSTRUCT A GREAT ELECTRIC PLANT
## 
### 
The Lake Spaulding-Drum plant in
the Sierra Nevada mountains which
has recently been constructed to sup
ply electric power for the Exposition
in 1915 was in charge of western
engineers exclusively. Stanford was
represented in the project by five
alumni. The chief engineer, F. G.
Baum, '98, is a graduate of the Elec
trical Engineering department of Stan
ford. It was due to Baum's ability,
aud to the loyalty of the engineers un
der him that all records for construct
ing similar plants were broken.
Other Stanford men that worked on
the plant are P. M. Downing, '95, who
was chief engineer of the operation and
maintenance department, J. P. Jolly
man, '03, W. H. Harrelson, '95, and P.
B. Dawson, '04.
Rudolph Van Norden, '96, who in
spected the work, said that it is the
largest hydro-electric plant west of
the Mississippi river, and the only one
that has ever been constructed in
which the engineers were all western
men. The work was a good test for
the graduates of the universities of
the west and proved them to be on the
par with any in the east.
