# TRY-OUT TOURNAMENT OPENS TENNIS SEASON
## Former Method of Selecting Varsity Team is Revived by Captain and Coach. 
### 
Saturday will usher in the tennis
j season at Stanford, when the first of
I the five tournaments from which the
[ varsity team is selected is scheduled
to be played on Encina courts. Coach
R. L. Murray, '13, and Captain L. S.
Sloss, '15, decided to return to the
former plan of picking the team to
represent the Cardinal against Cali
fornia through a series of tournaments
rather than to use the challenge meth
od in vogue last spring.
While formerly it was the custom to
have but four tournaments, this year
the try-outs will be conducted through
five. The winners of the first four
tournaments become the varsity play
ers .while the victor in the fifth will
act as substitute or may probably be
a member of one of the doubles teams.
Beginning next Saturday morning
at nine o'clock, tournaments will be
held every week-end until the five have
been played. It is the desire of the
captain and the coach to complete the
try-out as quickly as possible that the
team may be chosen early in the sea
son, in order to give them plenty of
practice together. In order that the
men may play under condition of ac
tual competition, matches are being
arranged with players from various
colleges and high schools.
With four veteran racquet wielders
on the court and a number of other
strong players the Cardinal prospects
for victory over the blue and gold are
good. F. S .Pratt, *13, H. L, Hahn, '16,
ex-captain V. L. Sheldon, '15, and Cap
tain Sloss are the circle "S" men who
will be out again this spring. Coach
Murray is inelegible having already
competed four times.
Those who wish to try out should
give their names to Murray, Sloss or
K. B. Uhls, *16. Captain Sloss desires
all the men in the university who have
had experience at tennis to compete
in these tournaments.
So that the try-out tournaments can
be completed as soon as possible, the
interclass doubles championship will
not be played until the varsity team is
picked.
