Works by members of the Stanford
faculty have been numerous in recent
current magazines. They are also re
sponsible for many new books.
Two members of the Education de
partment have just had volumes pub
lished dealing with subjects connected
with their work in the University.
Professor E. P. Cubberley's book,
"Rural Life and Education" is an ex
tensive work on this subject. It is a
fundamental treatment of the rural
school problem, now receiving so
much attention by educators and
statesmen, and shows the function of
the school factor in the improvement
of the rural communities.
An article on the same general sub
ject by Professor Cubberley is found
in the January "Educational Review."
The title of it is "Politics and the
Country School Problem."
The other book is by Associate Pro
fessor L. M. Terman on "The Hygiene
of the School Child." Professor Ter
man is a member of the national soci
ety dealing with physical instruction
in the public schools and is a recog
nized authority on this subject. The
present work is a survey of the best
medical and scientific information re
garding physical development of the
child. Both books are published by
Houghton-Mifflin Company.
Chancellor Jordan's essay on "Par
ental Influences" appeared in the Jan
uary "Journal of Heredity." "Science"
has published the works of several
Stanford men. "The Fur Seal Census
for 1910," compiled by Librarian G. A.
Clark, appeared in the December num
ber. It also recently contained "Ecto
parasites of the Monkeys, Apes and
Men" by Professor V. L. Kellogg, of
the Entomology department, and
"Atomic lonization and Atomic
Charges" by Professor F. Sanford of
the Physics department. Sanford also
has an article on contact electrifica
tions in the November "Popular
Science Monthly."
Other articles are "Potassium Ani
monomagnezate" by Professor E. C.
Franklin in "American Chemical So
ciety Journal," and "Recent Manifes
tations of Sectionalism in America"
by Assistant E. E. Robinson, of the
History department in the "American
Journal of Sociology."
