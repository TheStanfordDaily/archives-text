## Benjamin Ide Wheeler Comments on the Emergence of Small States From Imperial Dominance. 
### 
Dr. Benjamin Ide Wheeler, President
of the University of California ad
dressed a general assembly this morn
ing, taking for his theme the
crumbling away of vast empire, and
the self-assertion of the smaller na
tions. A large audience of students
and faculty members enjoyed the lec

"Norway is attempting to establish
its own national language; Ireland
is establishing home rule, and there
is a feeling among the Irish that they
want a place where their language and
customs may stand under the national
name.
"Hungary would establish independ
ence of Austria but for fear that she
would be consumed by the Slavic peo
ple about her. The Bulgarians have
their own language. They can't under
stand the Servians.
"Language is the chief social in
strument given to man. People who
can talk together want to live under
one flag. On the twenty-fourth of
March last, Europe was within two
hours, 01 war. Sir Edward Gray and
