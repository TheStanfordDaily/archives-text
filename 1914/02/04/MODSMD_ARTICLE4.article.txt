# GREAT EDUCATOR PICTURES GROWTH OF NATIONALISM
## Benjamin Ide Wheeler Comments on the Emergence of Small States From Imperial Dominance. 
### 
Dr. Benjamin Ide Wheeler, President
of the University of California ad
dressed a general assembly this morn
ing, taking for his theme the
crumbling away of vast empire, and
the self-assertion of the smaller na
tions. A large audience of students
and faculty members enjoyed the lec
ture, which was based on observations
made by President Wheeler during a
six months' tour of Europe.
President J. C. Branner introduced
the speaker, who prefaced his address
with an acknowledgement of his
hearty welcome.
"I didn't fully realize that I was
back in California until welcomed by
Stanford. It is hard to believe that I
am at Stanford without Dr. Jordan
here to welcome me. But I feel at
home to be with the man who has been
put in the chair —a sturdy rock. It is
great to have somebody you can tie to,
—who tells you the truth, even when P
isn't agreeable to you or to himself.
"I have come to Stanford to make
a report on what I have seen and
learned during my absence. I went
across the middle of the map of
Europe, which is characterized by that
strong paper weight, the hand of the
Emperor of Germany.
"My trip to Egypt lead through

Italy and Greece. It is interesting to
see how modern tendencies are being
brought out by the small nations.
There was a time when Empire spread
itself out in a vasty manner, but now
there are coming through like peaks
under a fog, the tribes, the natural
nations of common language, common
faith, and common hopes.
"Norway is attempting to establish
its own national language; Ireland
is establishing home rule, and there
is a feeling among the Irish that they
want a place where their language and
customs may stand under the national
name.
"Hungary would establish independ
ence of Austria but for fear that she
would be consumed by the Slavic peo
ple about her. The Bulgarians have
their own language. They can't under
stand the Servians.
"Language is the chief social in
strument given to man. People who
can talk together want to live under
one flag. On the twenty-fourth of
March last, Europe was within two
hours, 01 war. Sir Edward Gray and
the German Emperor were able to
reach an agreement, and they created
the state called Albania. The people
of Albania, the Dalmatians, have been
known from the earliest classic times,
but they have no government. The
Albanian tongue and traditions are
taking form. Austria and Italy were
willing to see another new nation
grow on the shores of the Adriatic in
order that Servia might not get a foot
hold there.
"So the emergence of the little na
tions goes on, —that of Roumania, Bul
garia, Servia, Albania, and now
Greece. There were (>•">,000 American
Greeks who went home when Greece
was menaced. Their new faith and
beliefs have had a great influence on
the country. Greece was and is the
land of individualism, where every
movement the world knows toward
intellectualism had its home. The
Greeks are an intelligent, hospitable,
charming people. If they are not al
ways truthful, it is because language
is to them a means of expressing
hopes, faith and ambition for the
future.
"From little Greece I went to
Egypt, which has none of the marks
of individualism I have mentioned.
Egypt is a shoe-string nation which
follows the course of a great river,
and is stretched as far as possible
without breaking. On either side are
the lands of death. Into the river the
sands have blown through the ages,
and also many strange kinds of men.
You find among them opposite tend
encies to the emergence of smaller na
tions. This stretched-out land has
what we call the government of Egypt.
Egypt does play at self-government,
but England has charge of finances
and improvements. The people of the
country are content with the govern
ment of Lord Kitchener.
"English is becoming the language
of Egypt, slowly, but in fact. We can't
expect savagery, barbarism, and semi
civilization to maintain a crust on the
face of the globe. There is an un
scrambling of the old imperial idea,
and a wish of each nation to express
itself. The great powers are realiz
ing their obligations. England is do
ing a splendid work. The English
tongue is going as a language 'round
the world, and with it English justice.
The man who can use English effec
tively is a citizen of the world.
"There is an unscrambling of em
pire, and emergence of small peoples,
and an expression of duty of the great
nations. History is moving toward
a goal,—it is q far off goal toward
which the fate of the people tends.
"May the day come when God will
reign king of the nations as he has
always reigned king of the saints, and
may the will of God prevail."
Two selections by the Stanford Glee

Club preceded the address. The selec
tions were well given, and marked the
first appearance of the club at an as
sembly for a long time.
