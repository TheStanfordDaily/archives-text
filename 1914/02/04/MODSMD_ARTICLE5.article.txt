# SENIORS TO HONOR THE FOUNDERS
## 
### 
As a token of the reverence and
esteem in which the deceased founders
of Stanford University are held by the
Senior Class of 1914, President F. B.
Watkins today permits formal an
nouncement of his initial appointment, ,
raising Miss Betty Glover Funsten and
Frank J. Gard to the honorary trust
of Flower Committee.
The custom of placing weekly tribute
at the Mausoleum which contains the
remains of the Stanford family was
begun in 1905, after the death of Mrs.
Jane Lathrop Stanford, and Miss Fun
sten and Frank Gard will continue to
carry flowers to the grave every Sun
day in perpetuation of the time
honored precedent. Both of the ap
pointees have been instrumental in
raising the class of 1914 to an import
ant position in Stanford activity, and
will creditably represent the present

spirit of the University in this com
memorative connection with the past.
Miss Fnnsten registers in the His
tory department from San Francisco.
She served her class as Junior Secre
tary, and occupied a place on the
Junior Opera Committee. Her name
has appeared quite prominently in
Stanford dramatics, she having filled
parts in "The Girl and The Voice" and
"The Mojave Maid." Miss Funsten
holds the office of Finance Chairman
of the Y. \V. C. A., and is a member
of Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority.
Gard registers from Glendora and is
a Chemistry major. He has won his
"S" three times in football, and is
captain elect of the 1014 Varsity. He
was president of his Junior Class, and
holds membership in Quadrangle Club,
Skull and Snakes, Phi Gamma Delta
and Phi Lambda Upsilon.
