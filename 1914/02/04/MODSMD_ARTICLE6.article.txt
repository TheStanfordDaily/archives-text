# ST. MARY'S FATTENS STANFORD PERCENTAGE
## ONE TO NOTHING IS SCORE IN AFTERNOON BATTLE One Run on One Hit Is Stanford Record, While Visitors Score None on Six 
### 
One run measured Stanford's vic
tory over the St. Mary's nine this after
noon. But one hit was gleaned off
Oschger's delivery. This hit in the
opening frame gave the Cardinals the
lead which the Catholics were unable
to equal although they found the Var
sity twirlers for six singles.
The excellent support given the
Stanford batteries explains the visi
tors' six hits without a run.

occured when the Catholics had filled
the bases in the sixth. Stafford raked
down Byler's speedy drive and threw to
Terry at second, thus retiring the side
scoreless from the most crucial sit

across the pan in the opening frame,
Halm being credited with the tally.

ters in one, two, three order via the

One run measured Stanford's vic
tory over the St. Mary's nine this after
noon. But one hit was gleaned off
Oschger's delivery. This hit in the
opening frame gave the Cardinals the
lead which the Catholics were unable
to equal although they found the Var
sity twirlers for six singles.
The excellent support given the
Stanford batteries explains the visi
tors' six hits without a run.
The feature play of the afternoon
occured when the Catholics had filled
the bases in the sixth. Stafford raked
down Byler's speedy drive and threw to
Terry at second, thus retiring the side
scoreless from the most crucial sit
uation of the afternoon.
Dent drove Stanford's first run
across the pan in the opening frame,
Halm being credited with the tally.
Halm walked, went to second on
Workman's single, annexed third on
a wild pitch, and came home when
Dent went out at first.
Unaided, Hayes pulled himself out
of a bad hole in the second inning.
Dyler and Cowan both singled. Osch
eger advanced each a base by going
out at first, Hayes to Workman. With
two down, Cuhna popped a fly to the
Stanford pitcher, retiring the side.
Oscheger retired the Stanford bat
ters in one, two, three order via the
strikeout route in the third frame.
Anderson replaced Hayes in the
fourth.
St. Mary's threatened to score in the
sixth, but was prevented by a pretty
double in which Stafford and Terry
figured. Wilson, the first man up,
walked, and went to second on Terry's
error, which also let Maroni take first.
Guisto advanced both by sacrificing.
Then with one down and second and
third filled, Byler knocked a hard one
over second. Stafford climbed into
the air, caught the ball, and threw to
Terry, retiring the side.
Oschegar allowed but one hit and
annoyed ten Stanfod men to the
strikeout point with his delivery. He
walked one. Hayes and Anderson
achieved no strikeouts. Hayes allow
ed four hits, while Anderson gave two,
with one free passage to first.
