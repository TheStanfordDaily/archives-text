# WE GIVE THANKS
## 
### 
The assembly of this morning furnishes material for several stanzas
of a little song of thanksgiving. Primarily, we are thankful for the op
portunity to see and hear Benjamin Ide Wheeler, the beloved and elo
quent president of our sister I niversity. \\ e are thankful for the good
natured manner in which he entered into our somewhat thoughtless ex
change of intercollegiate amenities. We are yet more thankful for a
glimpse of present-day Europe through the eyes of a thoughtful and
broad-minded traveler, and to have added to our mental stock-in-trade
the phrase "the emergence of natural units into expression"—a signifi
cant thought which we believe can be applied to some of our local prob
lems as well as to affairs of state.
For some other details we are thankful. It was good actually to
hear the Stanford Glee Club without cost, and to note that it has made
some progress in the musical line. It was fine to sing "Mail, Stanford.
Hail" again, even if there was no proper official there to start it; and
it was particularly gratifying not to have the climax shattered by a lusty
cheer, apparently in approbation of our own doubtful efforts at harmony.
Best of all was the fact that a large attendance maintained an attitude of
courtesy throughout, and that verily and in truth the front rows were
filled up. Now that we have found that it is not too painful to sit up
front, may we not, as we grow a little more hardened to it, gradually
establish a tradition that the Seniors shall sit there in a body? Such a
sensible custom as this would be a fit addition to that body of traditions
which make so greatly for the richness of Stanford life.
