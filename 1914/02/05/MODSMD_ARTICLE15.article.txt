ing will be expected to compete in
their respective events. Although

track events. All 100 and 120 yard
sprinters will compete in a 75-yard
dash. The 440 men are to run 300
yards while the half milers are slated
for the 600 yard distance. Instead of
four laps around the track the milers
will run 880 yards and the men who
are out for the two mile will compete
in the 1540 yard run or a distance of
three and one-half laps.
All field events will be on the cal
endar including the broad jump, high
jump, pole vault, shot put and the
hammer throw.
The first training rule goes into
effect Saturday. All athletes who are
registered at the training house must
report on Saturday for competition,
according to orders of Captain P. B.
McKee, '14, at ten o'clock. Any who
are not able to run should report to
McKee or Coach E. P. Campbell, '13,
