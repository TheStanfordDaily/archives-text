# DEMOCRACY

### 
Democracy at Stanford is a fact, and not a name. It is our most
priceless social treasure, and the characteristic which gives Stanford a
personality of its own. These statements are not made in measured
terms because they are sincerely believed to require no qualification.
Strange to say, our positive democracy arises from a negative quality—
the entire absence of the thought that there can be an essential distinction
between two men because of wealth, parentage or place of residence. A
man's a Stanford man for a' that. Our democracy is of the heart, not of
the hand —that is to say, it consists in entertaining a deep-seated respect
for the other fellow, rather than in giving him a slap between the
shoulder-blades.
Yet occasionally one wonders if a little more outward expression of
this Stanford democracy would not add to the joy of life for all con
cerned, and if in the act of expressing this quality we would not uncon
sciously be strengthening it within us. In keeping our democracy too
much to ourselves most of us do err, and no one of us who assumes to
criticize can fairly say he practices that which he preaches.
When the members of the present Senior class first put foot upon
the Quad one circumstance was pleasantly and indelibly impressed upon
them —the fact that every Stanford man seemed to sing out to every
other Stanford man a hearty "hello." lias this custom somewhat
languished, or is it just that first impressions exceeded the reality? In
some colleges this rule of speaking to every student of your sex whom
you may meet is rigidly adhered to. To make such the case at Stanford
would require slight though a general effort, and would result in a pleas
ant exhibition of our very real democracy.
