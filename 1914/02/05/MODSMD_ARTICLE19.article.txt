# Charlie Adams, '95.
## 
### 
The great seventy-by-seventy-foot
assembly room in Stanford's Encina
Club is girdled by a wide zone of
framed pictures of the University's
athletic teams.
In the first varsity baseball group
is a tall man with a fierce black mous
tache, suggesting two sewer rats re
treating into his nostrils.
He happened to be my first room
mate in Encina, even before the Uni
versity was opened, and also he was
the first president of the pioneer class.
So I knew him well.
Charles C. Adams, '95, from Stock
ton, California, is the formal desig
nation ,but everybody in his year at
Stanford always called him "Charlie
Adams."

He was about 23 years of age when
he entered as a freshman, was close
to six feet, and weighed in track cos
tume 190 pounds. He had the should
ers and arms of a Hercules, and a
beautifully tapering, lean build that
went from narrowed hips down to
small ankles. Potentially he was the
greatest undeveloped natural athlete
I have seen in twenty-three years of
athletic writing.
His only previous experience was in
baseball, and he easily made third
base and the captaincy of Stanford's
first and victorious varsity. The way
he would scoop grounders on the run
and drive the ball across to first sug
gested terrific power.
The first big football game with
California was played one Saturday in
March of 1892. Wednesday of that
week Charlie Adams was finally
coaxed into coming out. He had de
rided football as a bone-breaker. The
inexperienced varsity line needed
some powerful opposition. Knowing
no signals, ignorant of the principles
of play, he tore the middle of the line
to pieces. Then Adams simply had to
play on the team! The next night he
appeared in a suit as varsity left
guard. Charlie Adams sat up in his
room all through Thursday night
reading Walter Camp's book on foot-
ball, studying the rules and commit
ting to memory the complicated code
of secret signals. Friday there was
110 practice. He had made the team.
We all felt expectantly that Charlie
Adams would create a sensation if lie
ever got loose in the big game. Mm
because of his strangeness to the sport
itself hut one signal was given for
■ Adams to carry the ball. In a quick
swirl the big fellow dropped back and
received the pass. Mut an avalanche
of frenzied Berkeley backs burst
through the hole and bore him to
earth. So we never knew what might
have been.
In Stanford's first field-day that
spring, Charlie Adams, novice, won
j several of the fourteen events, taking
I first in the maiden hundred, in the
; regular hundred, in both weight
I events, in both jumps, and in throwing
tlic baseball, lie was awarded seven
gold medals. In some of the events he
had no mean competitors, one of them
being an all-round athlete who was
at that time bolder of a national
amateur championship.
Adams was a Zeta Psi. He lives in
1 Alameda now.

went from narrowed hips down to
small ankles. Potentially he was the
greatest undeveloped natural athlete
I have seen in twenty-three years of
athletic writing.
His only previous experience was in
baseball, and he easily made third
base and the captaincy of Stanford's
first and victorious varsity. The way
he would scoop grounders on the run
and drive the ball across to first sug
gested terrific power.
The first big football game with
California was played one Saturday in
March of 1892. Wednesday of that
week Charlie Adams was finally
coaxed into coming out. He had de
rided football as a bone-breaker. The
inexperienced varsity line needed
some powerful opposition. Knowing
no signals, ignorant of the principles
of play, he tore the middle of the line
to pieces. Then Adams simply had to
play on the team! The next night he
appeared in a suit as varsity left
guard. Charlie Adams sat up in his
room all through Thursday night
reading Walter Camp's book on foot-
ball, studying the rules and commit
ting to memory the complicated code
of secret signals. Friday there was
110 practice. He had made the team.
We all felt expectantly that Charlie
Adams would create a sensation if lie
ever got loose in the big game. Mm
because of his strangeness to the sport
itself hut one signal was given for
■ Adams to carry the ball. In a quick
swirl the big fellow dropped back and
received the pass. Mut an avalanche
of frenzied Berkeley backs burst
through the hole and bore him to
earth. So we never knew what might
have been.
In Stanford's first field-day that
spring, Charlie Adams, novice, won
j several of the fourteen events, taking
I first in the maiden hundred, in the
; regular hundred, in both weight
I events, in both jumps, and in throwing
tlic baseball, lie was awarded seven
gold medals. In some of the events he
had no mean competitors, one of them
being an all-round athlete who was
at that time bolder of a national
amateur championship.
Adams was a Zeta Psi. He lives in
1 Alameda now.

The great seventy-by-seventy-foot
assembly room in Stanford's Encina
Club is girdled by a wide zone of
framed pictures of the University's
athletic teams.
In the first varsity baseball group
is a tall man with a fierce black mous
tache, suggesting two sewer rats re
treating into his nostrils.
He happened to be my first room
mate in Encina, even before the Uni
versity was opened, and also he was
the first president of the pioneer class.
So I knew him well.
Charles C. Adams, '95, from Stock
ton, California, is the formal desig
nation ,but everybody in his year at
Stanford always called him "Charlie
Adams."

He was about 23 years of age when
he entered as a freshman, was close
to six feet, and weighed in track cos
tume 190 pounds. He had the should
ers and arms of a Hercules, and a
beautifully tapering, lean build that
went from narrowed hips down to
small ankles. Potentially he was the
