## 
### 
"Quality Street" is ready for the
curtain to rise tomorrow evening and
disclose the blue and white "front
room" of the Misses Throssel, where
the first act of one of the most fetch
ing comedies which have been played
at Stanford is to transpire.
The cast is ready for the services of
the make-up man with his paints and
greases. Each character in "Quality
Street" is a type, whose individual
oddities and charms assert themselves
in a decided way. There are no sup
ernumeraries. The business of pre
senting the story has been well dis
tributed, and the people in the cast
play their parts as though they enjoy
them.
The spectacle scene is reserved for
the third act. A great tented dancing
pavilion is set in the foreground of a
lantern-strewn garden. Bright party
dresses and brilliant military regalia
of the time of Napoleon mingle in the
attractive color scheme.
Captain Valentine Brown, as por
trayed by L. Clayton, '14, has a re
markable character, which combines
solid worth, a thorough going philos
ophy of life and a good amount of
humor. He reveals unusual dash when
pitted against the rivalries of younger
suitors for the favor of Phoebe Thros
sel (Miss H. T. Billiard, *14). Brown
is the sort of person that makes you
entirely glad when he comes in first at
the finish.
