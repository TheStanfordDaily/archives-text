1411; special, S2. Forty-two states,
three territories, one district, and
eleven foreign countries are repre
sented, Japan leading the alien regis
tration with 18.
Figures on major subjects give the
Economics department the lead with
189. The divisions of the Law de
partment follow with 154 in Pre-Legal
and 142 in pure Law. Civil Engineer
ing is third with 146.
In the matter of names, Clark leads
