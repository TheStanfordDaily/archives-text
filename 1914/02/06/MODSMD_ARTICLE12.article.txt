When it conies to works of charity Stanford men and women a*
a rule prefer to hide their light under a bushel. They entertain a secret
fondness for doing good deeds but gruffly plead not guilty to any accu
sation that they possess charitable dispositions. The Campus Auxiliary
to the Stanford Clinics has provided ample means for the gratification
of this passion for doing good secretly. On Tuesday—Stanford Clinics
Day — boxes will be placed in the Library and the Bookstore. In these
boxes one may furtively and unobserved slip his contribution to a cause
of real merit.
For it is a cause of real merit. A moment's contemplation will
remove the last lingering doubt of this proposition. The work of the
Stanford Clinics is one to appeal to practical-minded men and women.
The society is not engaged in experimenting with sociological theories
or in teaching washerwomen Browning for their souls. It is simply
employing a trained social worker among the families of the desperately
poor patients who come to Lane Hospital for attention. These cases are
thoroughly investigated, and all proper ones are reported to the Associ
ated Charities for attention. This prevents the giving of unnecessary
charity. Every cent contributed by Stanford students will be expended
among the families of the very sick and very poor who can in no other
way obtain assistance.
In our pleasant, happy-go-lucky existence on the every one
of us has at times a thought for the the less fortunate. Here's a chance
to send this thought in tangible form into the homes of the needy.
