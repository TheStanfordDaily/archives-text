# AID OF STUDENTS NEEDED IN WORK OF FREE CLINIC
## 
### 
The Auxiliary Clinic Society of Lane
hospital has set aside Tuesday, Feb
ruary 10, for the "Stanford Clinic's
Day". The object of the society is to
raise $500 to assist Mrs. Barnett of
San Francisco in aiding orphans and
needy sick people who come to the at
tention of the medical and surgical
clinic at Lane hospital. Boxes for
subscriptions will be placed in the
Bookstore and the Library. The fact
that the Lane clinic is conducted by
the university makes support of the
well directed charity work appropri
ate for Stanford students and alumni.
Last evening Dr. Stanley Stillman
of the hospital staff spoke to repre
sentatives of the Stanford auxiliary
society concerning the work. Part of
his remarks were:
"There is a great distinction be
tween charity and social service. One
is merely money which will undoubt
edly be immediately absorbed, while
the other is something lasting. So
cial service represents the help we
give others to help themselves. It is
the aid we can offer to assist the
needy to get on their feet again.
"Our hospitals need charity, and the
associated charities can help us, but
they also need the assistance from the
social worker. The worker is needed
in various lines; to assist the unem
ployed, the orphans, deformed, etc.
