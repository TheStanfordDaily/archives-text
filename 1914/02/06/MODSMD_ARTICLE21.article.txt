# BRAZIL IS THEME OF ILLUSTRATED LECTURE
## PROFESSOR MARTIN TELLS OF TRIP IN SOUTH. Large Audience Hears of Great Progress Made by South American Republic. 
### 
Assistant Professor P. A. Martin, of
the History department, gave an in
teresting account of his investigations
last summer in South America and
particularly iti Brazil, in a lecture be
fore a large audience in the chapel
last evening.
"The people of North America,"he
said, "are astonishingly ignorant of
conditions in South America. It is a
common belief that Brazil is a Span
ish-American country, when in fact
the people, language and customs are
Portuguese. Brazil, unlike her sister
republics, has advanced in orderly
strides, with only three revolutions
during her entire history, these hing
ing on principles, not personalities.
Although the country is in the period
of formation, it is not new and raw,
for the population is large and its in
stitutions are well developed. The
people are progressive, and though
somewhat indolent, are not greatly
given to the use of the word
"manana." Slavery was abolished in
1888, and the prejudice against the
negroes is slight."
Using slides of maps and pictures,
Professor Martin took his audience
through Bahia, the capital of North
ern Brazil, and thence to the federal
capital, Rio de Janeiro, where he
showed pictures of the harbour, build
ings and parks. Leaving the coast,
the great mining state of Minas Ger
aes and the coffee state of Sao
Paulo were visited, and a glimpse of
their industries was presented.
Professor Martin has great faith
in the future of Brazil, and looks for
the more effective development of its
great natural resources in the years
to come.
