# CHARACTERS WILL TREAD QUALITY STREET TONIGHT
## MASQUERâ€™ COMEDY PROMISES TO BE GREAT SUCCESS. Experienced Actors and Classic Play Should Furnish Many Thrills to Large Audience. 
### 
Barrie's rich story of a delightful
old English community in its most
attractive mood is slated for produc
tion at the Assembly Hall this even
| ing. Masquers' dramatic society has
! selected a comedy whose appeal is
! certain, and will present a cast of

actors whose ability has been shown
in previous performances and during
stage setting of unusual charm, and
details of management have been stu
died carefully.
The action of "Quality Street" be
gins with a pretty romance in the
j home of Miss Phoebe Throssel (Miss
H. T. Bullard, '14). Valentine Brown
(L. Clayton. '14) enlists to go to the
I Napoleonic wars without declaring
jliis love, and Phoebe is left alone in
! the blue room of her home to live in
! company with her elder sister Susan
(Miss R. M. Borough, '14), and her
maiden friends.
In the second act the Misses Thros
sel have met financial reverses, which
forced them to change the blue room
|to a genteel school for misses and
young gentlemen, Then the victor
ions armies return from Waterloo, and
with them Valentine Brown in a Can
tain's uniform.
A gay ball scene and garden party
forms a beautiful picture in the third
act. I'lioebe comes in her pretty


.Miss Helen Billiard, '14.
gown to have the fun which has been
denied her during the days of school
teaching.
Humorous bits of plotting and in
trigue during the third and fourth
acts give opportunity for comical by
play, in the way of gossip and
shocked respectability.

portunity for "upstage" superiority
on the part of a few actors. Many
people are required to tell the story,
and to furnish the laughs, smiles, and
feelings of sympathy that creep in
so often while the action proceds.
Musical selections have been chosen
which will blend well with the spirit
of the play. The program to be rend
ered by the University Orchestra fol
lows:
1. Patrol, Kilauea Stewart
2. Overture, The Lion's Bride
