## MAPLE AND HAYES ARE WORKED IN PITCHER'S BOX. Billy Orr Lines Out Triple in First Inning But Fails to Make Score. 
### 
Stanford baseball fans rejoiced in
the early season form displayed by the
Varsity in downing Ireland's Inde
pendents by a four to one score in Sat
urday's contest on the diamond.
The game opened with Maple on the
mound and Dent behind the plate. The
first two opponents were disposed of
on short infield hits. Billy Orr then
connected with the ball for an easy
three-bagger. Swain, who followed
him to the bat, flew out to Halm, leav
ing Orr on third. Terry started the
scoring for Stanford in the same inn
ing when he made first on Orr's error
and came home on Workman's clout
to left.
Stanford's second score came in the
third. With two outs, Driscoll allowed
Halm to walk. He was advanced on
Workman's hit. Abies fumbled, allow
ing Halm to complete the circuit.
Cliff Ireland made the only sacrifice
hit of the game in the fourth frame.
The visitors' lone tally came in the
fifth. Tobin gleaned a hit and stole
second. Orr made first on Williman's
muff, while Tobin reached third.
Swain's walk filled the bases. Abies
hit to Hayes who threw him out at
first, allowing Tobin to score. Stan
ford balanced the inning by scoring in
her half. Day walked, and took sec
ond while O'Neil was thrown out at
first. Jack's hit brought Day home.
The eighth session saw Orr, ex
utility infiehler of the Philadelphia
Americans caught napping off first.
After making the bag on a clean hit,
Orr was assuming a generous take-off
towards second, when Hayes pegged to
Workman and the deed was done.
Forker, former twirler for the Cali
fornia Varsity, took the mound in the
eighth. He began by passing Landers
on balls. Kennedy's error allowed
Williman to arrive safely at the initial
sack, while Landers gained third. A
wild pitch was the means of scoring
