# K.E. LEIB, '14, WINNER OF BONNHEIM DISCUSSION
## SUCCESSFUL SPEAKER RECIPIENT OF FIFTY DOLLAR PRIZE. Forceful and Logical Disputations Delivered on Workmen's Compensation Act by Four Contestants. 
### 
The Bonnheim dissertation which
took place last Friday evening in the
chapel, was won by K. E. Leib, '14,
from a field of four speakers. The
judges awarding the decision were
Professor \V. H. Carruth of the Eng
lish department, Associate Professor
G. H. Sabine of the Department of
Philosophy, and Associate Professor
M. M. Skinner of the German depart
ment. Professor F. C. Woodward, of
the Law department, acting as pre
siding officer, presented a prize of
fifty dollars to the winning orator.
Leib's speach in part was as follows:
Justified by Social Good
"The ethical justification of work
men's compensation depends upon dis
tributing its cost fairly upon society,
since its object is the protection of so
ciety from two dangers, poverty and
economic loss. Under the California
system of mere compulsory compensa
tion, there is not an equitable distri
bution of the cost, as agriculture is
exempted, the expense falls unevenly
on the manufacturers, and the rate of
insurance with private companies is
uncertain if not unreasonable. Thus
to equitably distribute the cost there
must be both compulsory compensa
tion for. all classes and compulsory
state insurance."
Negligence Demands Reparation
A. F. Coyle, '15, speaking on the
ethical liability of society for work
men's compensation, stated, that the
carelessness of American manufac
turers as to the preventing of acci
dents is such that careful estimate
shows the number of workmen killed
or injured to be over a half million a
year. Negligence and lack of respons
ibility on the part of the employer was
proved to be the cause. In conclud
ing he said, "Workmen's compensa
tion has made good, and should be
adopted since it is based on the high
est ethical principles."
J. D. Adams, '15, dwelt on the fail
ure of the laisser-faire policy and the
evil conditions existing under fellow
servant rule. He showed that only
one-fifth of all laborers were recip
ients of some compensation under
past laws. In summing up his views,
he stated, "The Workmen's compensa
tion has met all legitimate demands
that could be imposed upon it, and is
ethically justified."
G. C. Hodges, '16, the fourth
speaker, in his discussion was strong
in his support of the Compensation
Act. He gave examples of the old
methods of settlement, and also advo
cated that industry as a whole be made
to bear the cost of compensating work
men's injuries. Whatever the action,
the compensation should be sufficient,
sure and steady. The California Act
meets all these requirements and
hence is ethicaly justified.
