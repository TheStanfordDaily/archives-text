# Doctor Branner Discovers Radium in Brazilian Ore
## 
### 
While testing rocks sent him from
South America, President J. C. Bran
ner recently discovered in a minute
pocket of a specimen, a greenish-yel
low pocket which proved to he carno
i titem, the chief source of radium.
The specimens are from the state of
Cerea in Brazil. If more specimens
are found, Brazil will become the
fourth radium hearing district on the
globe. At present the largest depos
; its of radium bearing ore are found in
i Utah and Colorado.
Figures from the United States Bu
reau of Mines show that in 1012 $792,-
000 worth of radium was mined from
carbonite and that over half was ex
ported. From the carbonite ore is
obtained uranium oxide, which con
| tains radium. Uranium oxide, how
ever, is but a minute portion of the
carbonate ore. But one part in 2,940,-
000 of the oxide is radium. Radium is
worth $90,000 per gram.
Two Stanford men, H. L. Small, '11,
I and R. H. Soper, ex-'l2, now in the em
j ploy of the Brazilian government, will
in all probability aid in any investiga
| tion which may follow.
