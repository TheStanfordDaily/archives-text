# BARRIE PLAY IS STAGED TASTEFULLY BY MASQUERS
## "QUALITY STREET" PROVES TO BE ATTRACTIVE COMEDY. Balance of Comic and Dramatic Values Not Fully Achieved by Student Actors. 
### W.P. Staniford, '16 
The dames and beaus of "Quality
Street" have made their last curtsies
and stepped back into the history of
local dramatics. Most of us who went
Friday evening to see the Masquers
cast in the first play of the season
were bountifully entertained by the
performance of Barrie's comedy.
By this time the first glamour of the
footlights, music, and make-up has
fallen away, and impetuous enthu
siasm has had time to cool. It is
easier now to decide whether the resi
dents of "Quality Street" have given
us something to think about until the
next campus performance holds the
boards, or if they afforded amusement
merely for an evening.
Laughable Situations Occur
More than a few laughs were won
by the actors in numerous comical sit
uations. The audience had a good
time when the rascally recruiting ser
geant stood 011 the carpet before Miss
Phoebe, and brazenly took a repri
mand and a bite to eat from her at the
same time, knowing she was in mortal
terror of him. On other occasions the
aristocratic "haw!" of disgust of En
sign Blades upon reference to his
pink and white complexion was a
treat. The removal of the fictitious
Miss Livvy from the Throssel home
under the scandalized eyes of the old
maids of the street kept the house in
a prolongued chuckle during much of
the last act. Such bits of comedy as
those and several others were very
funny, and we liked them. But —.
There comes the rub.
Humor Upsets Balance
Tn a few words the complete suc
cess of "Quality Street" as the Stan
ford public saw it presented was fore
stalled by the fact that the more deli
cate charm was weighted down by ob
vious comedy. The actors couldn't
recover from their rib tickling antics
soon enough to convince the house
that the real undercurrent of pathetic
sweetness, sacrifice, and happiness
was moving again. That is a sticky
mire to bog in—the balance of comic
and dramatic elements is hard to
maintain.
Barrie must have intended the
gentler charm of Phoebe Throssel and
her sister, and the sweetness of the
story to overshadow the humorous in
cidents. The student actors didn't
emphasize the romance sufficiently
through the characters themselves.
Out and out comedies of action,
which rest their appeal on action
alone offer a more open field for ama
teur talent than those which like
"Quality Street" have a more evasive
charm. Unusual art is needed to keep
the bugbear of drag in the back
ground.
Any criticism which is at all ad
verse is too likely to appear uncom
promising. The performance in the
Assembly Hall was not wholly dis
appointing, by a long measure. It was
worth seeing, but it failed to realize
some possibilities.
Management, 's Effective
Everyone must have liked the way
tlic stage was set for the comedy. The
first and last acts, located in the blur
and white living room of the Misses
Throssel gave a gratifying picture of
quiet elegance and "quality." The
effect of tasteful primness which we

associate with the "old maid" was car
ried out by Miss Susan to the extent
of blue ribbon bows on the chair less.
Our hopes to see a spectacle in the
garden scone of the third act were
rather smothered in a great expanse
of white canopy. It is a pleasure to
say that the women of Masquers so
ciety, with the help of Sword and San
dals maintained the former standard
of stage management.
Women Score
Miss R. M. Borough, '14, as Susan
Throssel should be granted enviable
laurels for her portrayal of the sweet
character who lived to help her sister
find the love and happiness she her
self had lost. Miss Borough lived a
part with charm, and in her Miss
Susan we saw an "old maid," sure
enough, but one made more loveable ;
by the clinging beauty of a dead
romance. Her action and speech, and
something less tangible, herself de
manded admiration.
In the role of Phoebe, the attrac
tive heroine, Miss H. T. Bullard, '14,
was pleasing. The manner in which she '
got her "business across" was a de
light, and won appreciation. At times, !
such as the end of the first act, when
she bravely hid her sorrow behind j
a proud smile on learning that Valen- j

tine Brown had not conic to "declare
himself" to her, her success was won
derful.
Miss Margery Bailey, '14, made a de
liciously terrifying angel of goodness
of Patty, the Irish maid. Her pres
ence on the stage was always effective
and welcome.
Lawrence Clayton, '14, was a very
well-liked Captain Brown by the end
of the third act. Earlier in the play
he failed to give his best to the lines
of his character. His work became
more convincing as the action devel
oped, and raised the first impression
of commonplace ability to a much
higher level.
Henrietta Turnbull, as conceived by
Miss A. Iv. Gray, '15, was a whimsical
young lady of rich attraction. Miss
Willoughby and her sister Fanny were
successfully proper and respectable
ladies as portrayed by Misses N. N.
Choate, '17. and E. S. Taff, '15.
As the foppish Ensign Blades, a
1 comical overdrawn dandy, W. .T. Cross,
j '16, achieved approval with his nasal
' arrogance of speech and clever bits
of action.
The recruiting sergeant, acted by T.
; E. Workman, '14, was amusing in his
i brass garnished costume and conipla
j cent presence.
