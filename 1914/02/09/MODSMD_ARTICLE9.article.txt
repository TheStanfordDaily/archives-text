# BARRIE PLAY IS STAGED TASTEFULLY BY MASQUERS
## "QUALITY STREET" PROVES TO BE ATTRACTIVE COMEDY. Balance of Comic and Dramatic Values Not Fully Achieved by Student Actors. 
### W.P. Staniford, '16 
The dames and beaus of "Quality
Street" have made their last curtsies
and stepped back into the history of
local dramatics. Most of us who went
Friday evening to see the Masquers
cast in the first play of the season
were bountifully entertained by the
performance of Barrie's comedy.
By this time the first glamour of the
footlights, music, and make-up has
fallen away, and impetuous enthu
siasm has had time to cool. It is
easier now to decide whether the resi
dents of "Quality Street" have given
us something to think about until the
next campus performance holds the
boards, or if they afforded amusement
merely for an evening.
Laughable Situations Occur
More than a few laughs were won
by the actors in numerous comical sit
uations. The audience had a good
time when the rascally recruiting ser
geant stood 011 the carpet before Miss
Phoebe, and brazenly took a repri
mand and a bite to eat from her at the
same time, knowing she was in mortal
terror of him. On other occasions the
aristocratic "haw!" of disgust of En
sign Blades upon reference to his
pink and white complexion was a
treat. The removal of the fictitious
Miss Livvy from the Throssel home
under the scandalized eyes of the old
maids of the street kept the house in
a prolongued chuckle during much of
the last act. Such bits of comedy as
those and several others were very
funny, and we liked them. But —.
There comes the rub.
Humor Upsets Balance
Tn a few words the complete suc
cess of "Quality Street" as the Stan
ford public saw it presented was fore
stalled by the fact that the more deli
cate charm was weighted down by ob
vious comedy. The actors couldn't
recover from their rib tickling antics
soon enough to convince the house
that the real undercurrent of pathetic
sweetness, sacrifice, and happiness
was moving again. That is a sticky
mire to bog in—the balance of comic
and dramatic elements is hard to
maintain.
Barrie must have intended the
gentler charm of Phoebe Throssel and
her sister, and the sweetness of the
story to overshadow the humorous in
cidents. The student actors didn't
emphasize the romance sufficiently
through the characters themselves.
