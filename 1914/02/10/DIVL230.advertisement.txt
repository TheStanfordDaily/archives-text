" Keeping in Front"
You fellows know what that means!
We've been very successful in this I
regard with F atima Cigarettes. By \ / \
the way, these cigarettes were first
sold in the college towns —and you
agreed with us that they were good.
Then we put out for the big race,
to make Fatimas of nation-wide rep- es
utation, and today more are sold than Jj
any other cigarette in this country.
No purer, or more carefully chosen
tobacco grows than that in Fatimas.
We purposely put them in a plain "in? np C*]Vl
inexpensive wrapper —in this way j|v| HI jf ||ll
we can afford quality tobacco, and 3\l/ V / ( W
twenty of the smokes for 1 5 cents. |)| II ■ j
Now your college crew is of utmost US G»U3 »
importance to you —so is a good
cigarette, and it's your aim in pAI I Ja
to keep Fatimas in the lead —right % Turkish blend
up to their good quality—right up CIGARETTES
to where you first found them, and -yr\ ic*
will always find them. ' l ->
Success fellows! You started this
cigarette on its successful career —
and you pull a strong oar all over &W
this country. Lg,
