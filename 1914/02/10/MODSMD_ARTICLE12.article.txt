Friend of Senator Stanford for Many
Years Will Give Personal Peiuinis
eenee of the Public Services of the
University's Founder.

Arrangements have been completed
by which Hon. William W. Morrow will
deliver the address of the day at the
exercises for the observance of Found
ers' Day 011 Monday, March 9, Senator
Stanford's eighty-ninth birthday anni
versary. As usual the day will be a
University holiday.
Judge Morrow is a member of the
United States Circuit Court of Ap
peals, and one of the most eminent
jurists of the Pacific Coast. He was a
member of the House of Representa
tives during the latter part of Senator
Stanford's term in the Senate and the
two men were intimate friends for
twenty-five years. Morrow's address
will be in the nature of personal
reminiscences of the public services
of his friend, and in this connection
he will be able to discuss incidents
in the career of one of the founders
of the University which have not been
generally referred to. The commit
tee on public exercises has stated that
it considers itself very fortunate to
secure the consent of Judge Morrow
to deliver an address of this nature
which should be of interest to all
Stanford people.
Action will probably be taken by the
Senior class at their meeting tomor
row toward making some plans for the
other exercises of Founders' Day. A
musical program is being arranged
under the direction of Professor E. W.
Martin, of the Greek department, and
L. H .Eaton.
