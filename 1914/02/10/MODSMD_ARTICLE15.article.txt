The strength of appeal and depth of meaning' of the life of a college
to the students is indicated by the interest which the erstwhile students,
now become alumni, take in their alma mater. This obvious principle
also 'has a reverse action. The appeal of a college to its students is in an
indescribable manner increased by the knowledge of those students that
the hearts of the alumni are harking back to the old campus. When
Stanford men and women consider the attitude of the alumni toward
the University, they may flick their handkerchiefs after the manner in
which the now-celebrated Ensign Blades was wont to show pleasure, and
indulge in his explosive "Haw!" with an inflection of delight. Stan
ford's body of alumni is small but wonderfully loyal. Since the Univer
sity is but an infant as such institutions go a small but rapidly increasing
number of its graduates have achieved distinguished material success or
become plentifully endowed with this world's goods. But when these
men and women do gain success or wealth they are not hesitant about
attributing that success to influences on the Farm, and about applying
that money to the interests of Stanford. Everywhere Stanford gradu
ates are banding together in clubs bearing the name of their University.
Today's issue tells of the work of the San Francisco alumni along this
line. Now the purpose of this is to assure these graduates, should this
come to their notice, that their loyalty is appreciated on the campus and
is making the privilege of attendance at Stanford felt more keenly by
the students. And we that are now undergraduates, cannot we here and
now form a determination, so unalterable that the frosts of the cold
vctkl carnot freeze it out of us, that we will be forever loyal to
Stanford?
