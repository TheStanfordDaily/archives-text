# Stanford's Most Remarkable Athletes
## WILBUR EDWARDS, '93. 
### 
In 1912 some Stanford seniors were
in a group at the athletic fields. One
of them had a bicycle.
Innocently I inquired, "What's the
best Stanford has done in a bicycle
race ?"
"Stanford's never had any bicycle
races; never timed any body on a
wheel."
"Oh," I observed meekly.
Those eight years in the '90's be
tween the opening of Stanford and
the opening of the Spanish war marked
the zenith of the craze for bicycle rac
ing in America.
In the first five Stanford-California
field-days Stanford cyclists regularly
swept the field. Then California
wished the event abolished. Her wish
came true, with a little coaxing.
The state of California had pro
duced some wonderful riders for the
racing game. Every spring between
five and seven of the biggest cycling
clubs in California contested in the
classic hundred-mile relay race from
San Francisco round the bay, over a
horse-shoe-shaped course, through
San Jose to Oakland.
Rough riders took the first ten
mile relay from the city hall in San
Francisco through street traffic and
out over the hills.
Pure speeders were generally as
signed to the level relay past Stan
ford.

As the race was always ridden Sun
day about ten thousand spectators
generally formed almost a continuous
knotted line along the roadside. Prac
tically the whole Stanford student,
body would be rail birds.
The fastest ten-mile relay ever rid
den over the course stands to the
credit of .lack Alexander, '95. He
made it on the section from Menlo to
Mountain View.
With Jack Alexander, riding swiftly
to college every morning the eighteen
miles and then that same distance
back to their homes in San .lose in the
afternoon, was Wilbur J. Edwards, '93.
Wilbur Edwards was short, dark,
powerfully built, about 5 feet 7,
weighed about 150, and was quiet and
studious.
So great had become his prowess
as an amateur race rider that in 1595
special preparations were made for
him to establish a new world's record
for the mile. A straightaway course
was surveyed near Hayward, Cali
fornia.
The motorcycle was not known in
those days. But in developing pace
setters the tandem bicycle was sup
planted by the quad, with four riders.
Later the sextette appeared, with six
riders furnishing the power for one
pair of wheels.
The sporting world just then was
athrill. An eastern cyclist had done a
mile in 1:35 4-5, surpassing the best
performance of any race horse. With
in a few days a horse ran a mile in
1:35 3-5, and horsemen were jubilant.
A few days later Wilbur Edwards, '93,
paced by a quad ridden by four of the
best racers in the west, almost flew
along that Hayward straightaway. His
time, still a world's record, was
1:35 2-5.
