# WIDE INTEREST SHOWN IN COMING MUSICALE
## Advance Seat Sale for Butt-Rumford Concert in Assembly Hall Heavy. 
### 
Practically all of the seats have
been sold for the concert to be given
in the Assembly Hall tomorrow night
under the direction of the Peninsula
Musical Association. The few remain
ing tickets will be left on sale to
morrow morning and afternoon at
Weingartner's, and at the Assembly
Hall in the evening.

The heavy advance sale is due to the
reputation of the artists. Clara Butt
and Kennerly Rumford are without
doubt among the leading vocalists of
today.
The program chosen is an interest
ing one. Brahms, Debussy, Beethoven,
Rossini and Verdi are among the bet
ter known authors, while Madame
Butt's singing of several old folk
songs and airs should please her
hearers.
