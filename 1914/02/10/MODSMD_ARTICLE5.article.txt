# FIVE MEMBERS ARE CHOSEN FOR GLEE CLUB
## Strict Competitive Basis is Being Adopted in Selection of New Material. 
### 
As a result of the recent Glee Club
j try-outs, three have made regular
places and two associate memberships.
O. J. Gilliland, '16, and J. F. Hurlbut,
'17, have been chosen to fill vacancies
in the first tenor section. H. H.
Bronk, '15, who has been singing
in the first tenor section, has
! been changed to the second tenor
division. F. W. Dolbow, '17, has
been made an associate first tenor.
No vacancies have occurred among
the regular basses. F. E. Keast, '16,
I has been selected for the associate
first bass, and the corresponding
place in the lower bass is yet to be
filled.
In accordance with the decision of
the club last fall, there shall never
be more than six men in each part.
However, substitutes will be chosen to
sing with the club, and may become
regular members when they show more
i ability than those in the club, or when
I regulars lose interest. The substitute
: place is thus a stepping stone to the
; club, and a part of the competitive
i system which is to strengthen the

organization.
Application has been made for the
Santa Fe trip to Chicago this sum
mer. It is thought that Stanford has
a good opportunity to land it becauso
of the reputation gained on the Christ
mas tour. The trip is of two weeks
duration and all expenses are paid by
the railway company.
Most arrangements have been made
for the week-end trip to San Jose on
February 20. The club will sing at
the high school in the afternoon, and
at the Normal school in the evening.
A number of short trips will be taken
later in the semester.
