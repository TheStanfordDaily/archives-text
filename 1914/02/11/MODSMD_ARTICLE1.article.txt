## DATE NOT SET BY UNIVERSITY CONFERENCE. New Boating Regulations Necessitate Passing of Swimming Test for All Who Use Canoes. 
### 
A general non-faculty " osuu> j
bly in the near" "" be the
result of action bj aie Univer
sity Conference yesterday. The pur
pose for which the assembly will be
called is the discussion of current
problems of Student Control. No date
has been set yet, but it is understood
that the meeting will be called at the
first convenient time.
The Conference also heard and ac-!
cepted the report of the committee on
boating regulations at its meeting last
evening. While the new rules are
modeled after those of last year they j
differ in certain important details, i
Contrary to the custom of the past a
man who has passed the required test'
will not be allowed to take a |
woman out in a canoe with him unless J
she has also passed the test. No one ;
will be allowed on the lake in a canoe j
who has not passed the test.
The distance which people must:
swim in order to satisfy the regula
tions remain the same. A canoe {
must be taken out twenty-five yards,
overturned and the person taking the j
test must then swim to shore. Aruadd- j
ed requirement this year is that the
feat be accomplished with no aid from
the boat, such as pushing it along in
front to make swimming easier.
The following are the University
Conference rules for regulating the
use of canoes on Lagunita:
The test shall be passed before any
person is eligible to take out a canoe
whether it is owned by himself or not.
The test shall consist in taking a
canoe twenty-five yards from shore, I
tipping it over and returning to shore
without the canoe.
While taking the test men shall wear
shoes, a bathing suit and overalls or
the equivalent. The women shall wear
shoes, bathing suit and a long skirt
or the equivalent.
On passing the test a tiling card is
to be signed by the person taking the |
test and by the supervisor, these cards ;
to be kept by the boatman. Each time ,
a canoe is taken out the boatman will
satisfy himself either from his per
sonal acquaintance with the party or
by requiring a signature to the card
that the person using the canoe has
passed the test.
Any person not complying with
these regulations will be denied the
the use of the lake.
These rules do not apply to the
users of the rowboats, but must be ob
served by all users of canoes. A man
who has passed the test cannot take
a woman out unless she also has
passed the test.
Signed by the Committee.
