# O'SHAUGHNESSY TELLS OF SAN DIEGO WATER SYSTEM
## Engineers Assembly Addressed by the Constructor of the Present Source of Supply. 
### 
M. M. O'Shaughnessy, city engineer
of San Francisco, spoke before the en
gineer's assembly yesterday. His ad-
I dress consisted of a review of the
water conditions of San Diego from
the days of the mission fathers to the
present. The same subject matter, In
a more technical form, recently won
for him the lirst award of the James
Laurie prize.
The speaker began with the trouble
which Junipero Serra and the early
fathers had in securing water. To
obviate this, a brick and lime mortar
dam was constructed six miles above
the mission on the San Diego river.
From this an open conduit led to the
mission, Parts of this early work
were declared by O'Shaughnessy to be
in a good state of preservation.
In ISB6 both the San Diego Flume
company and the Sweetwater Water
company were organized, but both
were hampered by water scarcity.
The former company constructed a
dam controlling some ten and a half
square miles of watershed. By build
ing the dam lower down the company
might have increased its watershed
to more than two hundred square
miles.
In 1896 the Marino dam was started
by Babcock and the Spreckels broth
ers. In 1907 O'Shaughnessy was re
tained as consulting engineer. In 1909
he was placed in charge of the con
struction, and in June, 1912, the dam
was finished. The Dulzura conduit
was then built with a capacity of forty
million feet of water every twenty
four hours. It has a fall of four feet
in every thousand, and includes two
miles of granite tunnel. Sandtraps
at the intakes keep the water pure.
A roof for the entire conduit will
probably be built. By filtration, sedi
mentation and aireation the water is
kept absolutely pure.
