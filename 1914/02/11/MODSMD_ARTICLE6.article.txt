# Hollman to Join Chancellor Jordan As His Secretary
## 
### 
Emil F. Hollman, '11, has accepted
the position of secretary to Chancel
lor David Starr Jordan during part of
his travels through Europe and will
leave Stanford sometime the forepart
of May to join the great promoter of
peace at Constantinople. A few days
ago Hollmann received a letter from
Dr. Jordan asking him to assume the
responsibilities of the office during the
latter .part of the trip. At first the
desire to finish his semester's work
here was a strong deterrent, but on
second consideration the decision was
made to accept the unusual oppor
tunity.
After meeting Dr. Jordan at Con
stantinople the two will journey
through the Balkans and Bulgaria,
thence to Germany, and will end the
itinerary in England. Special work
will be done by the Stanford execu
tive during this special trip in com
piling facts on the results of the re
cent Balkan war, to use in furthering
the work of the International Peace
movement.
Dr. Jordan is now on his way to
Australia where he will deliver a ser
ies of lectures. Instead of returning
consider the project of giving a track
show C. C. Close, chairman, Miss
Helen Bullard, A G. Halm, and T. H.
Claussen were selected. To serve as
ushers in the Memorial Church next
Sunday, when Dr. Francis Peabody
will deliver his first sermon, Watkins
named A. G. Halm, P. B. McKee, A. C.
Sandstrom, R. C. Maple, O. H. Castle,
and S. J. Sharp.
Upon motion unanimously passed
by the Seniors at this meeting the sec
retary, Miss J. J. Garver, has issued a
general invitation to all graduates and
"hold-overs" to affiliate with the class.
A motion was passed to the effect
that the Seniors make a practice of at
tending the Memorial Church, such
practice to be regarded as a prece
dent. In this way the class not only
took advantage of the opportunity
which is its as the first privileged to
attend the restored Memorial Church,
but adopted a novel means of coming
together at regular intervals. The
Seniors voted that the men will sit in
the front seats at University Assem
blies, and that the class will allow a
large panoramic picture of itself to
be taken at an appropriate spot on or
near the Quad.
