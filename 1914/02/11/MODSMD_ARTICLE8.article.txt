# Crew Activities Hampered by Low Water at Redwood
## 
### 
Crew practice will be seriously
handicapped this season by tlie change
which has , taken place since last
spring in the tide conditions at the
Redwood estuary. Last Sunday a
squad of twenty-eight men made the
trip up to the boathouse on the bay
but the low tide made it impossible for
the oarsmen to launch the shells.
The inlet in which preparations
were made for last year's contest with
California has been largely filled up
by debris from the nearby tannery and
other establishments fronting on the
bay, and the coaching committee has
been making every effort to secure
a better location for preliminary prac
tice, but so far no suitable place has
been found. The landing at the foot
of Embarcadero street was investi
gated but the inlet there would be in
adequate for the needs of the Stanford
crew squad.
A schedule issued by the United
States Weather Bureau on the occur
rence of tides has been procured by
the Coaching Committee and all future
trips to Redwood will be governed by
tide conditions. Such an arrange
ment is the best that can be made at
the present time.
