# THE 						FOUNDERS' DAY BANQUET
## 
### 
In former times undergraduate interest in the Founders Day
banquet has been largely confined to an impartial of the
controversey between a few boosters who vote with a loud Aye that it
is going to be a five dollar banquet for two dollars, and a squad of "crab
bers" who maintain that it will be a twenty-five cent lunch for two dol
lars. And only too often, they say, the noes have it. Ibis )eai
there is to be 110 room for controversy. The cooperation of Skull and'
Snakes and Cap and Gown with the officials of the Alumni Association
and other interested workers will insure patrons of the banquet more
than their money's worth of enjoyment.
But it seems that in confining attention to this purely material
phase of the banquet we have all been missing the point of the whole
matter. The object of the Founders' Day banquet is not that we may
eat, but that we may give concrete expression to the regard which wc
should and do have in our hearts for the Founders' of this University.
Moreover, judging from attractive plans now laid, this years banquet
may see in reality the big "get-together" of the four elements of Stan
torcl life —fat ill Iv, trustees, sturlent.s mid alumm tor winch wc long
have waited. Ihe conccption of an ideal 1* oundeis l)a\ banquet is big
and fine. May this year see the realization of that ideal! Moreover,
may each one of us now plan to set aside a few hours and a few a very
•fgyy—pennies for the cause of the founders Day banquet 011 the
evening of March ninth.
