of college athletes the world has ever
known was the Dole family of River
side, California. There were eight
brothers and three sisters.
Refore Stanford opened the two
eldest brothers went to Cornell. Roth

of the class of 1894. One was a half

with Charles S. Dole, who entered
in September, 1894, and did not end
till Kenneth Dole left Stanford in
1912, —a period of nineteen consecu
tive years of Dole brothers as Stan
ford varsity athletes. One of them,
Norman Dole, '04, was world's cham
pion pole-vaulter.

All the Doles were the finest type
of college men and amateur athletes,
modest, agreeable, likeable, good
scholars; never a boozer or cigarett
ist among them nor one that caused
the scholarship committee a moment's
trouble.
During his four years as a Stanford
varsity athlete Charlie Dole scored
the unapproached total of 3G field-day
points against California. He was
track captain in 1897. Also he was
halfback on the varsity football

his best in competition when the best
was most needed.

all-round amateur athletes of Amer
ica, and took third place in the na
tional championships, which included
sprinting, running, jumping, vault

ing, walking, and performances with
tlie weights.

weighed about 175, was a blond with
rather an erect carriage.
Several years after his graduation
and after he had become a star polo
player in Honolulu he was frightfull>
injured when his pony fell in rough
lava. Charlie's skull was so crushed
that a large section had to be cut out
and a silver plate introduced.

In latter years Charlie Dole has
been a subordinate judge on one of
the Hawaiian islands, where he also
edits a periodical.
All the Stanford Dole athletes were

ford varsity athletes. One of them,
Norman Dole, '04, was world's cham
pion pole-vaulter.

All the Doles were the finest type
of college men and amateur athletes,
modest, agreeable, likeable, good
scholars; never a boozer or cigarett
ist among them nor one that caused
the scholarship committee a moment's
trouble.
