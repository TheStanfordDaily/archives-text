Editor, The Daily Palo Alto,
Dear Sir: —
Senior class after Senior class has
tried to spring into the world. Senior
class after Senior class has merely
slid out into that maelstrom in an un
hoinogeneous mass, there to be caught
up and scattered to the four corners
of the globe by all the centrifugal
forces which have separated friends
since time immemorial on this whirl
ing sphere we call "world."
Now these centrifugal forces are
bound to work, so our friendships
must be as strong springs, attached
to binded memories, so that when the
machines cease to run as hard, we
are back to our loved haunts.
To temper these springs we must
have the heats of active frays, and to
bind them, the loved memory of dear
places and friends.
The former is only obtained by the
watches around the football fire, the
rushes, and the jousts of the Ugly
Plug. The latter can often be ac
complished through misty smoke at
those feasts of words, around the scat
tered food.
For the latter purpose, let it be sug
gested that there be a senior steak
supper, and a senior smoker.
