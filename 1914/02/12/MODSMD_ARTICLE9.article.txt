# REHEARSALS COMMENCED FOR SOPHOMORE COMEDY
## Big Drug Store Scene in Third Act of "Fortune Hunter" is Feature Display. 
### 
Rehearsals for the Sophomore play
"The Fortune Hunter" were started
in earnest yesterday afternoon. From
now until the time of production on
March 14, regular practice will be con
ducted by Coach F. L. Mathieu.
Pop Graham's durgstore in the
"small town," the scene of the third
act, has already been built in a San
Francisco studio, and is now on the
campus. With regard both to the
action which transpires and to scenic
effect the third act of the comedy is
the one destined to "go big." During
that period the Fortune Hunter be
gins to explore new fields after shak
ing the weight of his college popu
larity and the dismal hunger of a
job hunt in "N' Yawk." Grub staked
by a friend gets a position as soft
drink dispenser in the small town,
joins the church, ceases to chew,
smoke, drink or swear, and courts the
favor of the village banker's daugh
ter. Before the end of the act he is
well started on his way to success,
and has little difficulty in marrying
the heiress to the local band roll and
j buying a half interest in the drugstore
before the last curtain.
Many things happen in the other
portions of the play, but surprises
run riot while the Fortune Hunter
! stands behind the soda counter. The
scenery, which has been built for the
third act provides a well-stocked
store, supplied with drug bottles, sta
tionery, cigars, chewing gum, and
soda fountain.
