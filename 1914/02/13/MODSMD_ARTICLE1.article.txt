### 
With a wealth ot' bright stories,
clever verse and pointed editorials, the
February number of the Sequoia will
make its appearance ou the Quad
Monday.
A feature story entitled "The Man
and the Manicure" is told in lively
fashion by J. W. Bennett, 15. He has
treated his subject matter in a clever
style which is suggestive of O. Henry.
The posthumous works of the myster
ious "Daniel Bond," who was a o
quent contributor to the early editions
of the Sequoia, have furnished this
issue with a delightful personal sketch
entitled "The Confession of a Timid
Man."
A story-poem of romance named
"Nanje" is from the pen of G. A.
Hughes, '10. The spirit of the Missions
predominates throughout the verses,
which are fittingly illustrated by R. N,
Wenzel, '16. An attractive poem en
titled "Doris" is the work of Miss L.
J. Culver, '9G, of Palo Alto, a former
contributor to the Sequoia. An inter
esting psychological romance, "Blur
red Borders," is contributed by Miss
B. J. Bingham, '14.
"Trail Mates in the Sierras" is the
caption of a charming bit of verse by
Miss D. Stark, '17. "The Wish" by It.
V. Higgins, '16, and a "Sonnet" by G.
Robinson, '17, completes the list of
poems.
In the Sketch Book is found an
other surprise story by E. H. Ford, '14,
entitled "The Separation." Miss H.
B. Ledyard, '17, has also told a story
of wedding-gift complications in this
department.
In her editorials, Miss Gunnell dis
cusses several timely topics. She
questions the ethical aspect of the
fashion our youth seem to cultivate of
standing on the corners and passing
"rough-neck" comments on the women
passing by. She also voices a plea for
the development of individualism and
deplores the growing tendency to "fol
low the leader."
In a spirited article entitled "Pub
licity," H. C. Boyd, '13, and F. J. Car
mody, '15, point out the folly of trying
to suppress news of action taken by
the Student Council, in cases of stu
dent-suspension, in the metropolitan
papers.
Several of the cuts for this issue
were spoiled in engraving, too late to
be done over again, so that the list of
illustrations is shorter than usual;
but the lack will not be felt with the
unusual attractions of the number.
The Sequoia announces that J. W.
Bennett, '15, has been added to the
staff and that G. G. Hoisholt, '14, who
has re-entered Stanford, will take his
former place among the Sequoia con
tributors.
