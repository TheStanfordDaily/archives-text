# Pugilists to Box at Many Weights Monday Evening
## 
### 
The annual boxing tournament
which is held each year at Stanford
to determine the best man of each
weight in the University will be held
Monday evening at the Encina gymna
sium. This year's tournament will be
the first one held since 1911. Gold
medals will be presented to the win
ners of each division, and this has
stimulated interest in the event.
The bouts will be principally be
tween men who are contesting for
the first time at Stanford, but who
nevertheless have shown considerable
ability in practice. Most of the vet
erans have left college. There are
eighteen entries this year. Those of
the feather weight division (128 or
under) are N. S. Espanola, '17, L. .T.
Barton, '17, G. P. Ross, '14, P. V.
Adams, '17, A. M. Smith, '17. Light
weight (138 or under) J. D. Flint, '15,
R. M. Good, '14, G. J. Howard, '15, C
Moore, '16. Welterweight (147 or
under) F. E. Single, '14, F. Rlackinton,
'17, L. S. Argall, '15, W. H. Rockman,
'14. Middle weight (160 or under) Z.
B. West, '17, F. G. Hampton, '17, W.
R. Wheatly, '17, T. F. Wasson, '15. The
heavyweight division has been elimi
nated because of lack of entries. The
contestants will be required to weigh
in at ringside Monday evening at the
gymnasium. The bouts will be com
posed of three two minute rounds with
a one minute intermission between
each round. L. 11. Reynolds, '15, E. R.
Scott, '13, and H. W. Maloney will
judge the bouts.
The champions of two years ago
were: featherweight, G. P. Ross, '14;
lightweight, R. M. Good, '14, welter
weight, C. Boulware, '14; and heavy
weight, C. O. Isakson, '14.
The first contest will start promptly
at 8 o'clock in Encina gymnasium, in
order that the tournament may be
completed by 10:30. Seats will be
provided for women on the upper bal
cony. No admission will be charged.
