# CONFERENCE RESCINDS STRINGENT NEWS RULE
## SMITH ADVISES CO-OPERATION WITH NEWSPAPERS. Action of Women's Conference on on Progressive Dancing Upheld at Last Night's Meeting. 
### 
Further revision of the rules gov
erning the giving out by campus news
paper correspondents of the names in
volved in suspension cases was taken
last evening by the University Con
ference. The action was taken after
protracted discussion during the
course of which the attitude of an ex
perienced newspaperman toward the
matter was presented by Assistant
Professor R. W. Smith of the English
department. It is believed that a new
ruling will result in adequate protec
tion from publicity to students disci
plined through cooperating with news
paper editors whereas the present
method results in antagonizing these
newspapers.
While the Council will still make
every effort possible to keep such mat
ters from becoming known the rule
was rescinded which prevents the cor
respondents from sending in the names
of suspended students to their pub
lications if the names become public
property. The Council will give
names to the papers in no cases and
the correspondents send them in at
their own risk, while another rule
adopted subjects anyone to action of
the Council who sends out untrue in
formation about the University. Smith
stated that in his dealings with the
newspapers in the work of his de
partment, he has found that when their
cooperation is sought they could be
depended upon to publish nothing det
rimental unless the facts were pre
viously let out through other chan
nels.
Under the new ruling the student
correspondents acting in cooperation
with Professor Smith as a representa
tive of the University will bear the
responsibility of securing a fair, truth
ful, and non-sensational treatment of
Stanford news.
