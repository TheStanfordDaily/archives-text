# THE 						HONOR SYSTEM
## 
### 
The "honor system" for examinations should be adopted through
out Stanford. This statement is not made as a mere space-filler to lie
for a fleeting day in the terra incognita of an editorial column, hut as
a subject for serious consideration among students and in the incoming
student body meeting. It is not made to achieve sensationalism at the
expense of common sense, but as remedy for an evil which is observable
in this as in all similar institutions. From time to time during examina
tons one may sec the furtive glance at the note-book oi the neighboi s
paper or hear the whispered question and reply. At the risk of seeming
to defend those who display the weakness let us say that a cei tain amount
of cheating is to be expected under our present system of conducting
test. , . 11-
From the very attitude of an instructor as he sits eagle-eyed on Ins
dais one may, if so minded, read an invitation to "slip one over if you
dare." And who wouldn't take a dare? This is a true if terribly prac
tical explanation of some cheating; it amounts to saying that the cul
prit's sense of honor is overcome by the characteristic American joy in
doing successful battle. _
This condition could be remedied by the adoption of the honor
system." Witness the Law department. There the "honor system pre
vails and we tremble to think of the consequences to a man seen cheat
ing by his fellows. The unanimous testimony of students of the depart
ment'is that the system there is an unqualified success. The Stanford
student is the most wholesome type of individual on earth, and a sense of
honor is his fundamental characteristic. But this sense will inevitably
weaken if it be attempted to replace it by a paternalistic instructor of
watchful mien; while if it be brought into action by the "honor system
it will be as hard exercise to a good right arm.
