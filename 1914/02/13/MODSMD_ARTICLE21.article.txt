# German Band Plays Purses Open
## 
### 
Clara Butt and Kennerley Rumford
may delight the ears of the Penin
sula music lovers. The Clinics may
collect small sums of money from im
pecunious students. But none other
than a little German band combined
both ends. The staunch little troupe
of bandsmen appeared on the campus
this morning and edified the roughs.
Tonight they will play at Encina Hall.
