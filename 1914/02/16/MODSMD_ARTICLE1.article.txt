# SUNDAY SERMON OFFERS MUCH FOOD FOR THOUGHT
## REV. PEABODY CHOOSED TEXT FROM OLD COMPARISON. First Subject of Noted Divine in Memorial Church is Effectively Expounded. 
### 
Rev. F. G. Peabody gave his first
sermon yesterday in the Memorial
Church, choosing for his text "How
much better, then, is a man than a
sheep?" "This ancient question was
never meant to be a commercial com
parison," said Dr. Peabody. "But
when Jesus was questioned after heal
ing the sick on the Sabbath day he
asked if, when a sheep had fallen to
the bottom of a pit, they would not
take it up. The obvious answer led
to a question that has been discussed
and rediscussed for centuries. Is a
man any better? If so, in what re
spect? What is the difference, we
ask. Verily it is better to be mere
mutton and wool than prodigal, base
and wicked, dragging down the name
of man."
"People are inclined to be very like
sheep," he continued. "They flock to
gether, flee in a panic at the least
alarm and follow a leader with blind
exactitude. Did not the ancient
psalmist say, "The Lord is my
shepherd;" showing that this compari
son is no new or medern idea?"
"There is very little choice between
the lot of a man and that of a sheep.
Tn many ways a cheep is' better off.
It has its fold, it food, and constant
attention, with no care of the world
and and nothing to worry about. No
thought of social evolution, troubles
its carefree way. This thought came
to me with such force when long ago
I visited a large sheep ranch and on
returning several years later I found
instead of the grassy meadows and
pastures neat rows of fruit trees,
acres of orchard. But accepting all
situations, man is the better of the
two. Sheep are just sheep and man
can not be satisfied with that. He
must put three issues before him, the
first, the discovery of himself.
He must have originality, he must be
individual, of a strong will, full of
character and not merely part of the
machine in the factory of life. He may
be satiated with culture and still not a
man. This is one of the first prob
lems of industry, of commerce, of
politics. One of the chief dangers in
the wide reforms that are spreading
through the country is the loss of in
dividuality by systematising to such
a vast extent.
The second issue before man must
be his discovery of others. A sheep
is merely a member of the flock but
a man can not be just one of his com
munity. To live in a mass of self
centered people is one of the most
narrowing influences known. It may
be all very well to mind ones own
business and indeed this is an easy
rule to follow but the lesson of broth
erhood, of compassion, of sympathy
and cooperation is the Christ spirit
in our busy modern times. Are we
merely grazing—and fattening too—
on the pasture of life? Are we a
flock or a family? The socialization
of consciousness is one of the first
problems to solve. Can we bury our
heads in our own pastures with op
portunity, advancement, mental, moral
and physical growth calling us on to
better things?
"The third issue is not only the dis
covery of ones self and of others but
the call of the ideal—the light, of
God, the incentive of reason. The

chief physical difference between the
man and the sheep is that the sheep
must look down and the man up. The
man has the attitude of reverence, of
aspiration. He cultivates the habit of
prayer. Many differ on this point,
saying that man must look down in
contrition, in patience and penitence.
But world-wide as these may be who
consider religion very good In its
place—there, the words of the Bible
again tell us that 'Blessed is the man
who sittetli not in the seat of the
scornful.' There is a coming to one's
self, a glorious awakening, a new de
mand for the upward look now in
business, in politics and in every
vital question. The world is panting
for the breath of refined influence,
saying that refinement is the mark of
humanity. Look up! It is the pas
ture of a man!
Through elementary decisions are
left for us. We must ask ourselves.
'Am I of the herd or am I myself?
I (Am I good but good for nothing?) Am
I self-centered, seeking my own ends,
or do I consider my community, those
about me? Do I look down or up?
I Have I the habit of looking at the
| mud or at the sky? Truly it is far bet
| ter to be a man but in order to truly
answer this name 'Know thyself.' "
The choir rendered Bennett's "God
is a Spirit."

Rev. F. G. Peabody gave his first
sermon yesterday in the Memorial
Church, choosing for his text "How
much better, then, is a man than a
sheep?" "This ancient question was
never meant to be a commercial com
parison," said Dr. Peabody. "But
when Jesus was questioned after heal
ing the sick on the Sabbath day he
asked if, when a sheep had fallen to
the bottom of a pit, they would not
take it up. The obvious answer led
to a question that has been discussed
and rediscussed for centuries. Is a
man any better? If so, in what re
spect? What is the difference, we
ask. Verily it is better to be mere
mutton and wool than prodigal, base
and wicked, dragging down the name
of man."
"People are inclined to be very like
sheep," he continued. "They flock to
gether, flee in a panic at the least
alarm and follow a leader with blind
exactitude. Did not the ancient
psalmist say, "The Lord is my
shepherd;" showing that this compari
son is no new or medern idea?"
"There is very little choice between
the lot of a man and that of a sheep.
Tn many ways a cheep is' better off.
It has its fold, it food, and constant
attention, with no care of the world
and and nothing to worry about. No
thought of social evolution, troubles
its carefree way. This thought came
to me with such force when long ago
I visited a large sheep ranch and on
returning several years later I found
instead of the grassy meadows and
pastures neat rows of fruit trees,
acres of orchard. But accepting all
situations, man is the better of the
two. Sheep are just sheep and man
can not be satisfied with that. He
must put three issues before him, the
first, the discovery of himself.
He must have originality, he must be
individual, of a strong will, full of
character and not merely part of the
machine in the factory of life. He may
be satiated with culture and still not a
man. This is one of the first prob
lems of industry, of commerce, of
politics. One of the chief dangers in
the wide reforms that are spreading
through the country is the loss of in
dividuality by systematising to such
a vast extent.
The second issue before man must
be his discovery of others. A sheep
is merely a member of the flock but
a man can not be just one of his com
munity. To live in a mass of self
centered people is one of the most
narrowing influences known. It may
be all very well to mind ones own
business and indeed this is an easy
rule to follow but the lesson of broth
erhood, of compassion, of sympathy
and cooperation is the Christ spirit
in our busy modern times. Are we
merely grazing—and fattening too—
on the pasture of life? Are we a
flock or a family? The socialization
of consciousness is one of the first
problems to solve. Can we bury our
heads in our own pastures with op
portunity, advancement, mental, moral
and physical growth calling us on to
better things?
"The third issue is not only the dis
covery of ones self and of others but
the call of the ideal—the light, of
God, the incentive of reason. The

chief physical difference between the
man and the sheep is that the sheep
must look down and the man up. The
man has the attitude of reverence, of
aspiration. He cultivates the habit of
prayer. Many differ on this point,
saying that man must look down in
contrition, in patience and penitence.
But world-wide as these may be who
consider religion very good In its
place—there, the words of the Bible
again tell us that 'Blessed is the man
