# Basketball Game is Postponed.
## 
### 
Owing to the fact that the entire
College of the Pacific basketball team
was forced to be vaccinated during
the past week, because of the quar
antine at that college, the game which
was to be played Friday evening was
called off. One more game with the
Garden City five is scheduled this
season. This will be played some time
in March.
