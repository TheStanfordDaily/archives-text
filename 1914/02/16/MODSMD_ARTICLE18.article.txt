# GENEROUS FUN PROVIDED BY THE FORTUNE HUNTER
## RAPID FIRE ARRAY OF EVENTS GIVES SNAP TO COMEDY. Epic of Modern Jason Shows Better Money Making Scheme Than Wallingford's. 
### 
In the choice of Winchell Smith's
effervescent comedy. "The Fortune
Hunter," the Sophomore play commit
tee has secured an attraction of note
for campus production. The elements
of simon-pure fun and romantic senti
ment run a nip and tuck race through
many appealing situations.
The story itself is entertaining, but
decorated with a stream of rapid-fire
dialogue, it becomes irresistible
There is the snap in the lines which
characterizes "The Chorus Lady," and
"The Traveling Salesman." The ac
tion moves along with energy, so that
a surprising number of events chase
each other on and off the stage.
This particular comedy is confess
edly a laugh, writ large. In the begin
ning, grub staked by a friend, Nat
Duncan sets out to find the golden
fleece in the person of the opulent
banker's daughter in Radville, Penn
sylvania. In order to make her pro
pose matrimoney to him, the Fortune
Hunter transports the styles ami
manners of Broadway to the soda
counter of the village drug store, and
dispenses soft drinks and city talk
for the pleasure of fair customers.
He also becomes a worker in the
church, abstains from the weed and
flowing bowl, and is pointed to by the
cracker box politicians as the model
of young manhood. Incidentally he
puts a dilapidated drug store on a
paying basis, and sends the owner's
daughter to a finishing school.
The banker's daughter proposes to
him, and be rejects her and her mil
lion in disgust at the success of his
plan. He tries to down three fingers
of whiskey for consolation but gags
on it, lights a cigar and throws it
away, attempts to swear, and learns
he has forgotten how. Then be goes
up to the church in the quiet of the
night to meditate. Finally he marries
the druggist's daughter.
No morals are attached to the story.
It is intended to make audiences
chuckle, and it is well equipped for the
task.
The cast which will play "The For
tune Hunter" on March 14 has the
lines letter perfect. Attention is now
being turned to details of action, and
fine inflection.
