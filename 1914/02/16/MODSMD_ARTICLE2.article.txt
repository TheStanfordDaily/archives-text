Shortened distances in all events
marked Saturday's track meet. Even
a larger percentage of the entrants
were novices than was the case in the
try-out a week ago. Former Varsity
track men were entered in only a
couple of events. The meet furnished
close and interesting competition.

run rather than the 1540 yard run of
the first meet. A summary of the re
