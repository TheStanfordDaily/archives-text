# TRUSTEES DECIDE TO BUILD NEW GYMNASIUM
## TO BE ATHLETIC HEADQUARTERS 
### 
New Sandstone Building Will be Con
structed on Lines to Promote De
velopment of Outdoor Sports, and
will Include Swimming Pool and
Other Features.

Trustees Hill Support Any Project of
Associated Students Toward the
Construction of a Concrete Athletic
Stadium by Loaning' Necessary
Funds.
A new sandstone gymnasium near
the athletic grounds and equipped with
all the most modern improvements is
to be erected as soon as satisfactory
plans can be drawn up.
This piece of constructive activity is
planned by the Hoard of Trustees and
is intended by them to fill a want of
long standing on the Stanford campus.
In addition to this, the Trustees have
announced their determination to sup
port any project of the Associated
Students looking toward the con
struction of a concrete athletic sta
dium. This aid will be given by the
Trustees in the form of a loan of the
necessary funds.
The new gymnasium is to be of a
type suitable for the development of
outdoor sports. In this respect it
will be typically Californian, and will
include a swimming pool and many
unique features.
H. C. Hoover, '9u, member of the
Board of Trustees and "Father of
the "Stanford Union" today out
lined the newly reorganized plans of
the Trustees for The Daily Palo Alto.
Trustee Hoover has been living on
the campus this semester with his
family in order to recuperate and also
that he may devote more of his time to
the interests of the University. In
speaking of the new gymnasium he
said:
"The Trustees decidcd last May to
erect a new gymnasium and they are
now about to secure plans for it. It
is proposed to ask the Engineering de
partment of the University to draw
up the preliminary plans. Although
the matter is not as yet definitely
settled, the general proposal is to put
up an L-shaped building, one story
high, and to enclose the other two
sides of the area with a high wall with
a court in the interior, the court to be
used for setting-up exercises in good
weather, and for handball, and to in
clude a swimming tank. The build
ing will contain in the main, shower
baths with adequate locker facilities
and a moderate-sized gymnasium
room. The proposal is that this build
ing should be erected adjacent to the
athletic fields so as to form a sort of
athletic headquarters and to become
an adjunct to athletic activities
rather than a formal gymnasium.
"None of the details have yet been
worked out and there is very little to
say about it until the site and plans
have been settled. The feeling is,
however, that California is an outdoor
country with an average of only five
weeks indoor weather in the year,
and that therefore the climatic con
ditions do not warrant a gymnasium
on traditional lines of elaborate in
door machinery. On the other hand
if outdoor exercise is to be stimulated,
it can best be done by lending the
construction of the gymnasium to this
purpose. Incidentally the project
would relieve pressure 011 the pres
ent training house."
When asked about the proposed new
stadium, Hoover said:
"The matter of the new stadium is
to be left entirely in the hands of the
Student Body. The Trustees are dis
posed to be helpful by way of loan
ing the necessary money, but they do
not consider that the paraphernalia of
games lies within the province of
their expenditure budget otherwise
than in advances to be returned in
some form of annual payments with
interest—not a difficult task when
taking into consideration the Big
Game receipts and some economy. If
anything is to be done in this matter,
however, before the 1915 game, it
would need be started immediately."

interest—not a difficult task when

Game receipts and some economy. If
anything is to be done in this matter,

Trustees Hill Support Any Project of
Associated Students Toward the
Construction of a Concrete Athletic
Stadium by Loaning' Necessary
Funds.
A new sandstone gymnasium near
the athletic grounds and equipped with
all the most modern improvements is
to be erected as soon as satisfactory
plans can be drawn up.
This piece of constructive activity is
planned by the Hoard of Trustees and
is intended by them to fill a want of
long standing on the Stanford campus.
In addition to this, the Trustees have
announced their determination to sup
port any project of the Associated
Students looking toward the con
struction of a concrete athletic sta
dium. This aid will be given by the
Trustees in the form of a loan of the
necessary funds.
The new gymnasium is to be of a
type suitable for the development of
outdoor sports. In this respect it
will be typically Californian, and will
include a swimming pool and many
unique features.
H. C. Hoover, '9u, member of the
Board of Trustees and "Father of
the "Stanford Union" today out
lined the newly reorganized plans of
the Trustees for The Daily Palo Alto.
Trustee Hoover has been living on
the campus this semester with his
family in order to recuperate and also
that he may devote more of his time to
the interests of the University. In
speaking of the new gymnasium he
said:
"The Trustees decidcd last May to
erect a new gymnasium and they are
now about to secure plans for it. It
is proposed to ask the Engineering de
partment of the University to draw
up the preliminary plans. Although
the matter is not as yet definitely
settled, the general proposal is to put
up an L-shaped building, one story
high, and to enclose the other two
sides of the area with a high wall with
a court in the interior, the court to be
used for setting-up exercises in good
weather, and for handball, and to in
clude a swimming tank. The build
ing will contain in the main, shower
baths with adequate locker facilities
and a moderate-sized gymnasium
room. The proposal is that this build
ing should be erected adjacent to the
athletic fields so as to form a sort of
athletic headquarters and to become
an adjunct to athletic activities
rather than a formal gymnasium.
"None of the details have yet been
worked out and there is very little to
say about it until the site and plans
have been settled. The feeling is,
however, that California is an outdoor
country with an average of only five
weeks indoor weather in the year,
and that therefore the climatic con
ditions do not warrant a gymnasium
on traditional lines of elaborate in
door machinery. On the other hand
if outdoor exercise is to be stimulated,
it can best be done by lending the
construction of the gymnasium to this
purpose. Incidentally the project
would relieve pressure 011 the pres
ent training house."
When asked about the proposed new
stadium, Hoover said:
