# WE CHORTLE IN OUR JOY

### 
Stanford is going to have a sure 'nuf gymnasium! For five minutes
we have been beating a triumphant tattoo on one typewriter key—the
dollar mark, appropriately —trying to calm down sufficiently to express
our joy in dignified English. Honestly, it's the best news in many a
moon. The one jarring note in the well-balanced symphony of Stan
ford's material equipment has been that little wooden Temple of the
Horrors where a few square feet of floor space are at once handball
court, basketball court and apparatus room and where one takes a Sears
ville shower by means of a hose. From the bottom of their several
hearts the students thank the Trustees who have come to their rescue and
are to build a twentieth century athletic headquarters with scientific
equipment and a swimming tank —yum yum! We particularly compli
ment them on their recognition of the fact that the best physical training
does not come from disagreeable set exercises, but from pleasurable
sport in the open air.
While not forgetting the splendid work accomplished against heavy
odds in the old gymnasium, we look forward to the completion of the
new building as marking a new era —a day when the last vestige of an
excuse for neglecting a college man's possibilities for maintaining
physical condition will be taken away, and the last disgruntled fireside
loafer will be out in the good fresh air.
