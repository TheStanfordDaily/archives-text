# The
						Honor System.

Editor, The Daily Palo Alto,
Dear Sir:
What added advantage has the Law
department? Do we need policemen
where they do not? I as an American
citizen object to being imprisoned and
spied upon for one hour while taking
an examination. True, this is the
statement of an idealist, but i believe
greater honesty could be secured as
it has been secured by the Law de
parment. Under the present system
of spies and guards I would not
think of reporting my neighbor who
was employing unfair means, for he
would he successfully meeting the
challenge ,as before stated. But un
der the honor system 1 would not hesi
tate an instant to warn one who
would be so base, so disloyal to de
mocracy, as to cheat.
Are the lawyers more honest —in
college—than the rest of us who are
also struggling in other departments?
We desire to be considered as favor
ably as any other students, and re
sent any insinuations as to our hon
esty and integrity. Thanks for such
an opening. Here's for equality of
regard as to honesty.
One of the Suspected.
