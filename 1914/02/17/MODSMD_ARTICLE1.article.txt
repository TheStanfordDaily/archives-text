# TRUSTEES REVISE SYSTEM OF CAMPUS LAND LEASES
## CONSTRUCTION OF UNIVERSITY HOMES IS ENCOURAGED No Restriction Will be Put on Sale of Houses in the Future. 
### 
The Stanford Board of Trustees has
revised the forms of lease under which
houses may he built by University
members on University land. This
revision has been made in a desire to
encourage the construction of homes
for the Faculty and other University
people upon the campus. Trustee H.
C. Hoover, *95, explained this action in
the manner following:
"As is well known, the University
cannot alienate the title to any of the
Campus lands and it is therefore
posed instead of the present ten-year
lease, to give a lease for twenty years
with the optional right on the part of
the lessee to renewal at the end of
each period of twenty years up to
eighty years. It costs the University
something like $000 to $1,000 per
building lot to install roads and
sewers and, generally, to improve
these building tracts, and further than
this, the University has the annual
expense of maintaining these utilities.
The Trustees feel that these items of
original cost of improvements and
their maintenance are of the same, na
ture as the taxes which would be im
posed on any liome-builder in any lo
cality and should in some manner be
borne by the lessee. Aside from this,
a home-builder off the campus would
have to pay the purchase price of a
plot off the Campus, and even were
the public utilities provided, they
would be represented by a portion of
the purchase price. The Trustees do
not seek for any return for the value
of the land, but have devised a de
ferred method of returning to the
University at least part of the out-of
pocket expenses. Instead, therefore,
of lumping down the original cost of
improvements of a plot on the lessee
in the first instance, it has been de
cided to defer the redemption of this
cost until after the expiration of the
first twenty-year period of the lease,
and this is to be accomplished in the
following manner: The leases re
quire a ground rent during the first
twenty years of approximately $100
per plot per annum, this being esti
mated as the cost of maintaining
roads, sewerage, etc. During the sec
ond twenty years, however, the lease
rent is to be advanced by 50 per cent.,
and so on for each subsequent period
of twenty years. Furthermore, and
part of this new lease scheme, the
Trustees are prepared to loan up to
75 per cent of the cost of any house
built by the Faculty on the Campus at
a reasonable rate of interest, the cap
ital to be repaid to the University
over a long period of annual install
ments. The anticipation that most
houses would be built on this install
ment plan is one reason for throwing
the redemption of development cost
onto a period later than the first
twenty-year period.
"Other important conditions of the
lease are that the University will not
oblige itself to buy back any of the
houses built but, on the other hand,
I comparison between Palo Alto and the
Campus. It it were desired to build
a $5,000 house in Palo Alto, a plot of
ground of similar dimensions would
! cost from $3,000 to $5,000, but we may
! take the former figure or a total out
lay of $8,000. if an arrangement were
'made with a building and loan asso
-1 ciation it would loan 75 per cent, of
the cost of the house and lot, or
$0,000. This sum, repayable over
twelve years, with their rate of in
i terest, would entail payments of
$780 per annum. If we assume inter
-1 est on the $-,000 of preliminary capi
tal required to be worth $120 per an
num and town taxes and special as
sessments, not payable on the Campus,
to average $<J0 per annum, we arrive
puts no restriction on the sale of the
houses from one member of the Uni
versity to another and, with the ap
proval of the Trustees, they may be
sold to outsiders. No live stock is
to be allowed on the Campus, but
automobile garages are no longer
banned. Altogether, the reconstructed
lease is proposed in the genuine hope
that it will meet the desires of the
Faculty and at some deferred time do
some measure of justice for the out
lay thrust upon the University. What
this plan really means in money can
be best indicated by making a direct
at a total of $900 per annum outlay
for twelve years and at the end of
the period the property would be paid
for. At the average rate of deprecia
tion, the house would be worth say
$3,500 and the lot, say $3,000 or a total
of $6,500. Lots in the University neigh
borhood are not likely to appre
ciate very much over present prices
for many reasons not necessary to go
into here.
"Take now the case of the same
house built upon the Campus. The
University will loan 75 per cent, of
the $5,000 cost or $3,750 and thus the
initial capital required is $1,250. In
terest on this $1,250 of initial capital
comes to $75.00 per annum, and if the
Trustees spread repayment of loan
with interest evenly over twelve years
at their usual rate of interest, the an
nual charge will be about $450 per an
num, the ground rent of $100 added
makes a total of $025 per annum cost
to the builder. In other words, the
Campus house will have cost $335 per
annum less than the Palo Alto house.
Now if this $335 per annum for twelve
years be laid out at 6 per cent, com
pound interest it will have amounted
at the end of the twelve-year period,
to $5,500. So that the Campus builder
for the same outlay could have his
house worth say $3,500 and the above
sum, or about $9,300 of property
against the Palo Alto builders possess
ions of $6,500. This gain of $2,800 if
put out at interest would pay the
ground rent for good, and the usual
town maintainence taxes saved. To
state it another way, the Faculty
member could better afford to build
on the Campus if he sold the house
and lease at the end of the twelve
years for only $1,000. If the Univer
sity member wished to make the posi
tion of his family absolutely secure
as to payments in case of death he
could devote a portion of the saving
over Palo Alto to life insurance."
Asked about the probability of open
the Lagunitos tract, Hoover said that
it has not yet been decided by the
Trustees what further areas will be
opened and they would be glad to
learn how many of the University peo
ple are likely to take advantage of the

new lease and where they would pre
fer to build.
