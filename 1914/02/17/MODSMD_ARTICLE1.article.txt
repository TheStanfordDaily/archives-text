# TRUSTEES REVISE SYSTEM OF CAMPUS LAND LEASES
## CONSTRUCTION OF UNIVERSITY HOMES IS ENCOURAGED No Restriction Will be Put on Sale of Houses in the Future. 
### 
The Stanford Board of Trustees has
revised the forms of lease under which
houses may he built by University
members on University land. This
revision has been made in a desire to
encourage the construction of homes
for the Faculty and other University
people upon the campus. Trustee H.
C. Hoover, *95, explained this action in
the manner following:
"As is well known, the University
cannot alienate the title to any of the
Campus lands and it is therefore
posed instead of the present ten-year
lease, to give a lease for twenty years
with the optional right on the part of
the lessee to renewal at the end of
each period of twenty years up to
eighty years. It costs the University
something like $000 to $1,000 per
building lot to install roads and
sewers and, generally, to improve
these building tracts, and further than
this, the University has the annual
expense of maintaining these utilities.
The Trustees feel that these items of
original cost of improvements and
their maintenance are of the same, na
ture as the taxes which would be im
posed on any liome-builder in any lo
cality and should in some manner be
borne by the lessee. Aside from this,
a home-builder off the campus would
have to pay the purchase price of a
plot off the Campus, and even were
the public utilities provided, they
would be represented by a portion of
the purchase price. The Trustees do
not seek for any return for the value
of the land, but have devised a de
ferred method of returning to the
University at least part of the out-of
pocket expenses. Instead, therefore,
of lumping down the original cost of
improvements of a plot on the lessee
in the first instance, it has been de
cided to defer the redemption of this
cost until after the expiration of the
first twenty-year period of the lease,
and this is to be accomplished in the
following manner: The leases re
quire a ground rent during the first
twenty years of approximately $100
per plot per annum, this being esti
mated as the cost of maintaining
roads, sewerage, etc. During the sec
ond twenty years, however, the lease
rent is to be advanced by 50 per cent.,
and so on for each subsequent period
of twenty years. Furthermore, and
part of this new lease scheme, the
Trustees are prepared to loan up to
75 per cent of the cost of any house
built by the Faculty on the Campus at
a reasonable rate of interest, the cap
ital to be repaid to the University
over a long period of annual install
ments. The anticipation that most
houses would be built on this install
ment plan is one reason for throwing
the redemption of development cost
onto a period later than the first
twenty-year period.
"Other important conditions of the
lease are that the University will not
oblige itself to buy back any of the
houses built but, on the other hand,
