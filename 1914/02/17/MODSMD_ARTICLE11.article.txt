# SENIORS AND JUNIORS TO JOLLY-UP TOGETHER
## 
### 
Instead of the Junior and Senior
classes holding separate jolly-ups this
semester the two upper classes will
join in the semi-annual "get-together"
in the very near future. Action was
taken in this matter at the Junior
class meeting this afternoon. The
idea of an upperclass jolly-up was
suggested by the Senior class and has
received the recommendation of the
Juniors. President G. A. Jacomini,
'15, will confer with President F. B.
Watkins of the Senior class in re
gard to a date and final arrangements.
Treasurer H. J. Ling reported a bal
ance of $114.72 in the treasury.
