# Road to be Closed.
## 
### 
Construction work on the Stanford
Union will necessitate the closing of
the road to the north and west of the
postoffice after tomorrow. Superin
tendent .T. O. Miller, '08, states that
deep grading operations will almost
wipe it out of existence. This road is
the one leading from Lasuen to the
automobile garage and other build
ings.
