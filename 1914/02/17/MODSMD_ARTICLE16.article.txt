# CALIFORNIAN FORECASTS STANFORD TRACK VICTORY
## Trainer Christie of Blue and Gold Squad Expects Repetition of Last Year's Result. 
### 
Trainer Christie of the University of
California recently gave out an inter
esting forecast on the coining inter
collegiate track meet. Taking last
year's track meet as the basis of his
reasoning, he figured that Stanford
will again come out on the long end
of the score in the annual California-
Stanford contest. He totals the Card
inal's points to the mark of G1 and
California to 56. In this calculation
he does not include the relay. It will
be noted in the statistics presented
by Christie below, the great majority
of Stanford's points come from the
track events and not the field events.
A summary of the California trainer's
estimate is as follows:
Event Stanford California
100 yards 8 1
200 yards 8 1
440 yards 4 5
880 yards 6 3
Mile run 5 4
Two mile run 1 8
120-yard hurdles 5 4
220-yard hurdles 5 4
Shot put 9 0
Hammer throw 1 8
Broad jump 3 6
High jump 1 8
Pole vault 5 4
Totals <31 56
