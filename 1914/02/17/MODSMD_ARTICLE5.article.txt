# RING TITLES WON AFTER FAST BOXING EXHIBITIONS
## ROSS, GOOD, ROCKMAN AND WEST WIN COVETED LAURELS. Three Hundred and Fifty Fight Fans Witness Close and Clever Contests. 
### 
The boxing championships of the
University were decided last evening
at the annual boxing tournament held
at Encina Gymnasium. About three
hundred and fifty fight fans who were
present were treated to an excellent
exhibition of the art. G. P. Ross, '14,
successfully defended his title of
featherweight champion against all
claimants. R. M. Good, '14, held his
place as champion of the lightweight
division, and W. H. Rockman, '14,
battled his way to the welterweight
title. The middleweight laurels were
awarded to Z. B. West, '17. These
men will be awarded gold medals.
No Loss of Time
The bouts were run off in excellent
manner, a round of one contest being
staged while the boxers of a pre
vious contest were resting. In this
way considerable time was saved and
there were no long waits between
bouts. The rounds were two minutes
long, with a two minute rest. Most
of the contests were full of action
and the contestants were for the most
part evenly matched, furnishing good
exhibitions. Considerable ability was
di'-'laycd on the part of the new ma
terial.
Probably the bout that received
most applause and furnished the best
action was between G. P. Ross, '14,
and P. V. Adams, '17, in the final con
test. for the featherweight champion
ship. Adams drew a bye in this divi
sion and went against Ross in the
finals for the first time. In the fact
that he was fighting an experienced
man and that he himself was com
paratively inexperienced, Adams
should be commended for the way in
which lie handled himself. He dis
played spirit and gameness through
out.
W. IT. Rockman, '14, and L. S. Argall,
'15, treated the audience with the most
scientific exhibition of the evening.
Both men showed themselves efficient
in all departments and Rockman espe
cially demonstrated his ability to use
a right swing.
Extra Rounds Decide
Two contests were draws at the
close of the designated time, and re
quired extra rounds to decide them.
The bout between G. G. Howard, '15,
and C. D. Moore, '16, went five rounds
before Howard was declared winner.
The final battle for the middleweight
title between W. R. Wheatly, '17, and
Z. B. West, '17, was decided in a
fourth round in favor of West.
In the preliminaries of the feather
weights Ross eliminated N. S. Espan
ola, '17; R. V. Adams, '17, drew a bye.
For the lightweights Good won his
bout from J. D. Flint, '15, and Howard
defeated Moore in five rounds. In the
welterweight, division S. E. Pingree,
'15, disposed of F. S. Blackinton, '17,
in a whirlwind manner, and L. S. Ar
gall, '15, was beaten by W. H .Rock
man, '14. The middleweight honors
were decided when West defeated F.
G. Hampton, '17, and Wheatly was
awarded his contest when T. F. Was
son, '15, was declared overweight, al
though these men boxed an exhibition
bout.
In the final round, Ross won the
championship from Adams in a game
fight. Good gained the lightweight
title over Howard. Rockman and
Pingree fought a fast contest, which
was awarded to Rockman. An excel
lent go was staged between Wheatly
and West for the middleweight cham
pionship. At the end of the third
round, it was declared a draw, but
in the fourth round West came back
strong and proved his right to the
title.
E. T. Scott, '13, and H. W. Maloney
acted as referees and judges, and L. R.
Reynolds, '15, also served as a judge.
