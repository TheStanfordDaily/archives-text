# SIGNS OF THE TIMES AT INDIANA
## 
### 
"Indiana is soon to install the honor system." Items of this nature
appear again and again among the "college notes" on file in this office.
The honor system is not an experiment; and there never was offered a
finer field for its successful operation than right here at Stanford. This
subject is brought to the attention of the students once more in order
that they may think seriously of it, and may discuss it in their assembly.
Then, should it be the consensus of opinion of the student body that the
honor system is highly desirable at Stanford, beyond doubt this point of
view will be received and considered in open-minded fashion by those in
authority.
First the plan must be talked over. The sentiment of the entire
student body should be obtained. If the decision is favorable to the new
system, it must then be "talked up," and "talked up" without end.
"Carthage must be destroyed" said Cato again and again; and Car
thage was destroyed. The walls of Jericho fell because someone made a
loud noise. The Daily Palo Alto is willing to shout itself hoarse in favor

of the honor system
