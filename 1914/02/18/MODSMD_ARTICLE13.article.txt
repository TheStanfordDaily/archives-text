# THE 						RULES OF THE BULLETIN BOARDS
## 
### 
Student sentiment finds vigorous expression in the cause of further
beautification of the campus; yet we realize that to make this demand
with force we must do our own duty towards improving the appearance
of the Stanford grounds. This duty requires among other things that
we should place promiscuously scattered signs and placards in their
proper place on the bulletin boards. In this respect there is evidence
lately of some improvement. There are more cards on the bulletin boards ;
but, evidently, many of them were tacked there at midnight in the dark
o' the moon; for they neatly cover other announcements of equal im
portance. That placards have been thus carelessly placed, witness the
present condition of the bulletin boards; that the act of placing them
so was merely carelessness we know, for to deliberately cover up an
other's announcement is a piece of selfishness not characteristic of Stan
ford men. Such carelessness should be avoided. Ihe rules of the bulle
tin boards are simple. No cards should be pasted upon them; and no
cards should be tacked over "live" announcements.
