# Stanford's Most Remarkable Athletes
## BERT KERRIGAN. 
### 
In the Memorial Court at Stanford,
on a bronze tablet, is the name H. M.
Kerrigan, one of the university's vol
unteer soldiers in the war with Spain.
Herbert M. Kerrigan, ex-'Ol, fought
in the with the Second
Oregon infantry. He was only a
Freshman when he went to the front.
President James E. Sullivan of the
Amateur Athletic Union of America,
himself a noted authority on amateur
athletes, has said: "The world has
known but three really great high
jumpers—Page, Sweeney, and Bert
Kerrigan."
To appreciate the full significance
of Bert Kerrigan's athletic achieve
ments one must picture his diminu
tive stature. In all the years of his
wonderful athletic performances, Bert
Kerrigan measured but 5 feet 4*4
inches high and weighed only 140
pounds.
Yet here are some of the things he
did:
As a youth only fifteen years of age
he competed at Chicago in the world s
international turner contests, and he
took third place against boys? no,—
against the best mature gymnasium
athletes in the world.
During a period of twelve years of
regular athletic participation he never
once failed in competition to jump at
least six feet in height.
His records are: high jump, 6 feet
4 inches; broad jump, 22 feet W2
inches; pole vault, 11 feet 1 inch;
16-pound shot-put, 36 feet 7 inches.
He also holds two world's records
running high dive, 6 feet 2% inches;
and running broad dive 15 feet 9V£
inches.

During all the years that he was
captain and volunteer trainer of the
admirably amateur Multnomah Ath
letic Club of Portland, that organiza
tion never once failed to win a field
meet against college or club teams.
In addition to his all-around track
and field work, Bert Kerrigan was a
gymnastic expert, a boxer and a
wrestler, and about the best quarter
back Multnomah ever had. Also, he
was a wonderful waterman on the
Willamette river, and one summer
paddled alone in a canoe eighteen
hundred miles through untraversed
waterways of Alaska.
When the American team was
selected for the Olympic games at
Athens in 1906 Bert Kerrigan went,
the first Stanford man to attain that
honor. He was entered for the high
jump and as a possibility for the
sprints. But on the trip across the
Atlantic the steamer was swept by
a tidal wave that smashed lifeboats.
Bert Kerrigan alone of the team was
injured, and bled internally. Despite
his hurts, he contested for the starred
shield at Athens in the high jump.
He was beaten, for the first and only
time in his life. That ended field-days
for him.
His high-jump form has never been
equaled. In practice he always made
a few perfect jumps every day in
the year, but never once higher than
5 feet 9 inches. Using a run of but
thirty-five feet for either high or broad
jump, he took off close to the bar, rose
with all his power concentrated upon
one leg spring, and cleared with his
chest carried high. Such control had
he over muscles and nerves that he
repeatedly in exhibitions jumped over
the head of a six-foot man and would
three times out of four brush a match
off the cross bar with his hip while
clearing the six feet.
In all his athletic career, Bert Ker
rigan has stood as a model of fairness
and sportsmanship, and has never yet
used liquor or tobacco, has never had
a rubdown, and has never failed of
being in the fittest condition always.
Yet when little, modest, smiling,
likeable Bert Kerrigan comes to Stan
ford occasionally as an official no
onlooking student knows who he is or
that there stands one of Stanford's
greatest and the world's most remark
able real athletes.
Bert Kerrigan will probably be one
of the officials of this year's inter
scholastic meet at Stanford.

rigan has stood as a model of fairness
and sportsmanship, and has never yet
used liquor or tobacco, has never had
a rubdown, and has never failed of
being in the fittest condition always.
Yet when little, modest, smiling,
likeable Bert Kerrigan comes to Stan
ford occasionally as an official no
onlooking student knows who he is or
that there stands one of Stanford's
greatest and the world's most remark
able real athletes.
Bert Kerrigan will probably be one

Archie Rice, '95.
In the Memorial Court at Stanford,
on a bronze tablet, is the name H. M.
Kerrigan, one of the university's vol
unteer soldiers in the war with Spain.
Herbert M. Kerrigan, ex-'Ol, fought
in the with the Second
Oregon infantry. He was only a
Freshman when he went to the front.
President James E. Sullivan of the
Amateur Athletic Union of America,
himself a noted authority on amateur
athletes, has said: "The world has
known but three really great high
jumpers—Page, Sweeney, and Bert
Kerrigan."
To appreciate the full significance
of Bert Kerrigan's athletic achieve
ments one must picture his diminu
tive stature. In all the years of his
wonderful athletic performances, Bert
Kerrigan measured but 5 feet 4*4
inches high and weighed only 140
pounds.
Yet here are some of the things he
did:
As a youth only fifteen years of age
he competed at Chicago in the world s
international turner contests, and he
took third place against boys? no,—
against the best mature gymnasium
athletes in the world.
During a period of twelve years of
regular athletic participation he never
once failed in competition to jump at
least six feet in height.
His records are: high jump, 6 feet
4 inches; broad jump, 22 feet W2
inches; pole vault, 11 feet 1 inch;
16-pound shot-put, 36 feet 7 inches.
He also holds two world's records
running high dive, 6 feet 2% inches;
and running broad dive 15 feet 9V£
inches.

During all the years that he was
captain and volunteer trainer of the
admirably amateur Multnomah Ath
letic Club of Portland, that organiza
tion never once failed to win a field
meet against college or club teams.
In addition to his all-around track
and field work, Bert Kerrigan was a
gymnastic expert, a boxer and a
wrestler, and about the best quarter
back Multnomah ever had. Also, he
was a wonderful waterman on the
Willamette river, and one summer
paddled alone in a canoe eighteen
hundred miles through untraversed
waterways of Alaska.
When the American team was
selected for the Olympic games at
Athens in 1906 Bert Kerrigan went,
the first Stanford man to attain that
honor. He was entered for the high
jump and as a possibility for the
sprints. But on the trip across the
Atlantic the steamer was swept by
a tidal wave that smashed lifeboats.
Bert Kerrigan alone of the team was
injured, and bled internally. Despite
his hurts, he contested for the starred
shield at Athens in the high jump.
He was beaten, for the first and only
time in his life. That ended field-days
for him.
His high-jump form has never been
equaled. In practice he always made
a few perfect jumps every day in
the year, but never once higher than
5 feet 9 inches. Using a run of but
thirty-five feet for either high or broad
jump, he took off close to the bar, rose
with all his power concentrated upon
one leg spring, and cleared with his
chest carried high. Such control had
he over muscles and nerves that he
repeatedly in exhibitions jumped over
the head of a six-foot man and would
three times out of four brush a match
off the cross bar with his hip while
clearing the six feet.
In all his athletic career, Bert Ker
rigan has stood as a model of fairness
and sportsmanship, and has never yet
used liquor or tobacco, has never had
a rubdown, and has never failed of
being in the fittest condition always.
