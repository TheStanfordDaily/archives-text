# HANDS ACROSS THE SEA

### 
A couple of years ago the chorus of the Junior Opera remarked
tunefully to the general effect that the folks of all the races are
a-running round the bases in the greatest game of all the nations. Of
course it was superfluous to add that this game was "old baseball. And
truthfully did they sing. Of late, we are told, the hrench and other
European peoples have taken up baseball. Last year the Stanford varsity
was furnished keen competition by Chinese, Japanese, and Hawaiians.
Among the best sportsmen were the Keio University ball players. Stan
ford fans will be pleased with the decision to invite this team for a series
of games here this spring.
Aside from the larger significance of the trip as a factor in promot
ing the fellowship of nations, and aside from the more selfish reason
that it promises some mighty good ball, there are other considerations
which make us glad of the decision to bring Keio to Stanford during this
particular year. In the first place, Stanford, by sending its team last
ear to partake of the splendid hospilatity of the Japanese, placed itself
under a moral obligation, understood at the time as between gentlemen,
to return this courtesy. Now in future years the personnel of the Var
sity nine and student executive force may be so changed that this gentle
men's obligation may be disregarded. As Chancellor Jordan repeats,
"It pays for a nation to be a gentleman, so we say, ' It pays for a univer
sity to be a gentleman." This year there are in Stanford seven men who
made the trip to Keio and who will put heart and soul into entertaining
the visitors, whereas next year the number will probably he reduced to
two or three. Graduate Manager Wilcox, moreover, has announced his
intention of personally accompanying the Japanese team on its tour
through the state, bending every effort to make it a financial success for
the Stanford hosts and managers. In future years the Graduate Man
ager might not have time or inclination to do this. So from the dollars
and cents as well as from every other viewpoint this is the ideal year to
bring the Keio boys to Stanford. And we will be right glad to see them.
