Editor, The Daily Palo Alto,
I have followed with growing inter
est the discussion in your paper con
cerning the advisability of establish
ing the honor system in Stanford.
There seems to be among the stu
dents a feeling that to admit that such
a thing is desirable throws a reflec
tion upon Stanford honor. Let us not
be oversensitive, let us be frank to
gether. We all know that cheating is
going on in examinations. In some
cases this is perhaps due in part to the
very presence of the inspecting eye
of the instructor. As you indicated in
one of your editorials an instructor
on police duty is a constant invitation
to the keen minds "to put one over."
"Rut we all know that ever in those
cases where the instructor left the
class, putting the men plainly on their
honor, things were no better.
Supervision is degrading to instruct
ors and students alike. Tt serves to
widen the gap between faculty and
students by making their interests ap
pear as antagonistic.
We have student government in
other matters. Why delegate the care
of our honesty to others?
I am therefore heartily in favor of a
change. The question is to let it be a
change fo? the better. You suggest
that other universities have honor

j systems. I personally know of the
i system in the University of Virginia.
| The system with which I am acquaint
| ed, however, replaces the police duty
I of the instructor by the police duty of
'every student over his fellows.
May I suggest that we may attain
! our aim without a "System?" I have a
'dislike for systems; they ultimately
become as tyrannical as the conditions
they are supposed to displace.
Need we organize definitely into a
j mutual detective association? Would
it not be sufficient if the students
! through their representatives request
ed the faculty from now on to abandon
the method of supervision? Then have
a mass meeting in which these same
I representatives may report upon their
' work and explain to all men and wo
' men that they will no longer be in-
I suited by supervision.
We have no written law to prevent
I smoking on the Quad; every one re
| spects it as a sacred custom. Tf it is
I violated ever, it is through ignorance,
not through design. Can we then not
make the honesty of Stanford men
and women into a tradition even more
sacred? I think we can, by persuading
j our instructors to put us on our own
' responsibility and by making it a
I custom among the upper class men
to explain to the new members of the
