# BROADER INTERPRETATION OE THE BIBLE ADVOCATED
## Dr. Peabody Pictures a Sane Religion Consistent With Modern Ideals and Conditions. 
### 
Dr. F. G. Peabody gave his first lec
ture last night in the chapel, the sub
ject being "The Practicability of the
Christian Life."
"The sober, righteous and Godly life
was applicable in the time of Christ
but as times changed can we expect
this same rule to hold good? Can we
live in the modern world and do this?
And can there be a truly Christian
family in our modern society? Sim
plicity toward Christ is urged but on
the whole is the Christian religion
practical? It is a difficult matter to
adjust. The modern man gives nine
tenths of his waking hours to the
making of a living but if he turns to
the Bible he finds this pursuit con
trary to its teaching. One must choose
between the idealism of the Bible and
the Unitarianism of our every day
life. Obviously the Christian Life ha?
become impratical. We must now de
cide whether contemporary life or
Christianity should rule; it is the
vital question of the day. It may be
all very well to sigh for a beautiful
past but we must live in the present
"The critics of Christianiy consider
it incompatible with modern life, the
apologists of Christianity seek an al
ternative. 'None of us are Christians
but we all know we ought to be,' is
the cry. This is official Christianity
but it could scarcely lie called real.
Social revolutionists say the same
thing. The progress of humanity is
the death of religion. To force an
issue between religion and modern
life is herioc in one sense but it only
emphasizes the pathetic sense of im
practicability in the question. Chris
tianity and the modern man are fai
apart as yet for the core of the faith
does not lie in the sayings or writ
ings of Christ but in bis spirit lived
on earth now by men. If this is im
practical the testament is all upside
down for we cannot substitute devo
tion for the church. More frequently
it is the personal object in question.
Do we live the life of Christ- Verily
the ideals taught are more reverenced
than realized in most cases. Creed?
and church are but figureheads in the
modern society. Men are not Christian
if they partake of gambling, divorce,
and vulgar entertainment in theii
own homes. If religion is morbid,
cloistered and mysterious the average
man will naturally say, "Not for me'
but we need not fiee from others to
save ourselves. The sentimental ap
proval of a faith that cannot be prac
tical is of little value. One would be
inclined to be a 'looker on.' as it were
and to sanctify merely such events
as birth, death, or marriage leaving
religion entirely out of the rest of
life.
"Many people have dropped reli
gion for science, art. or play due to
the reserve of science or the occupa
tion of business. 'Unreal ethics,' they
say. But the intellectual indifference
of the rich, the numbers not ever
critical whose minds turn another way
are what makes the cause unsafe. II
is a noble unfrequented ruin, without
loyalty. The sober, righteous and
godly life is incompatible, the Testa
ment is confused and interpreted un
historically, without prospective, and
yvith facts distorted, while the im
portance should be laid on the real
ism of fact. The gospel teaches un
worldliness, restraint, cal r but

we should not mistake occasionalism
for universalism. Jesus was a prophet
of social revolution, a producer of
goodness, not goods. He did not con
vert things but men.
"The Christian Life is a larger
thing than the literalist supposes. The
gospel should be considered as a
whole since it becomes inconsistent if
detached. It is easy to die for an
idea if you have but one. There is
sanity and poise in the teachings only
when we penetrate to the underlying
principle. True Christianity is a liv
ing spirit and on this conclusion de
pends the practicability of the Chris
tian life. Power and life are the key
words to the gospel, expansion and
growth. To save life is to lose it, to
restrict power is to weaken it. Chris
tian ethics is the science of Spiritual
Dinamics and this leads to but one
conclusion: To live as Christ would
have approved. Transform the ab
stract into the concrete. Have per
sonal relationship with ideals. Devel
op supreme concern for the individual
and the response of the individual to
a master. There must be a teacher
behind the teaching. The machinery
may often be renewed but the power
that moves it is the same eternally."
