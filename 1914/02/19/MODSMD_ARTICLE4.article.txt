# FINAL PLANS ANNOUNCED FOR WOMEN'S CLUBHOUSE
## New Building Will be Constructed of Concrete in Most Substantial Fashion. 
### 
The recent breaking of ground for
the Women's Clubhouse coincides
with the announcement of the final
plans for this unique structure. Sup
erintendent of Construction John (.>.
Miller, '08, today gave an outline of
the appearance and floor spacing of
the building.
As announced previously, the Wo
! men's Clubhouse will be joined to the
Stanford Union by a large patio or
court. This will be decorated with
flowering plants and shrubbery, and
will conform admirably to the simple j
type of mission architecture.
The exterior of the new building |
will be two stories in height, and will j
be constructed of concrete in the most!
substantial fashion. It is the inten
tion of the Stanford women to make
the building first class in every par
ticular, and, if necessary, they will
sacrifice beauty of interior finish for
| a period, in order to have an edifice
I that will stand for all time.
Superintendent Miller commented
on this intention. "They are proceed
ing in the right manner," he said. "It
is easy to add the little frills of inter
ior decoration, but you can't change
a poor wall to a good one."
The ground floor of the clubhousei
will provide the women with a place
where they can enjoy their leisure.
It will contain a cafe, with everything
necessary to efficient service, locker
rooms, parlours, lounging rooms, and
a music room.
The second floor will provide a
place for the many entertainments of
the women's organizations, and will
have a large stage at the east end of
the building. The main lobby will be
; thirty-six by fifty feet square, and will
have a hardwood floor as will the en
tire second floor. Connected to the
j lobby, will be the main dancing floor,
I fifty-five by thirty-five feet square.
| Opening off these two rooms will be
| parlors and a reading room, so ar
ranged by connecting door that they
can be thrown into use as parts of the
| dancing room. This arrangement will
. make the entire second floor available
for dancing purposes.
The work on the new structure will
proceed as weather conditions and
j financial matters direct. With the
j sum now at hand, and with the
regular amounts accruing to the wo
i men from their various entertain
| ments, it seems certain that the con-
I struction will proceed without a halt,
land that the dreams of many years
1 will be realized in the shortest pos-
I sible time.
