# THE 						PLUG UGLY
## 
### 
On December 4, 1913. the University Conference resolved "That
the Plug Ugly rush, which now includes the farce and the pasting of
posters about the campus, be abolished, and a committee be appointed
to look up some method of substitution." The report of this commit
tee must soon be submitted. Now it seems but logical that in a matter
so closely touching the student body as a whole, the opinion of the stu
dent body as a whole should be expressed and considered.
The article printed below shows that the whole object and spirit of
the Plug Ugly as originally conceived has been lost sight of. Something
radical must be done. The Daily Palo Alto does not wish to express
at this time an opinion as to what this step should be, but merely to
call the attention of the men of the University to tlie necessity of deter
mining, in the first place, whether they wish to continue the Plug Ugly
in any form. This should be done by thorough discussion and even by
straw votes in the various organizations and rooming houses, and by
further discussion in the promised student body assembly. If the de
cison is favorable to the continuance of the Plug I'gly, both the com
mittee of the Conference and this ppper will welcome suggestions as to
a new form of plug-christener.
With sentiment thus crystallized, the Conference and its commit*
tee may take action with a thorough understanding of the wishes of the
students. And thus in this case, as we fervently hope in every other
case, representative government at Stanford will be a reality.
