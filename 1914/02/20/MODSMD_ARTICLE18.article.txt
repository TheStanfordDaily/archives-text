# History of the Plug Ugly

[Note: It is the desire of the com mit
tee on revising the Plug Ugly that the
history of the I'lug Ugly be familiar to
the students in order that intelligent
discussion as to the advisability of a
substitute may be had. In line with
this policy the Daily Palo Alto prints be
low an article on the subject from the
pen of an alumnus thoroughly in touch
with the situation. While the article
deals with facts and not opinions, the
alumnus presents the conclusions drawn
from his study thus: "The committee

abolishing the custom. With our social
and athletic schedule overcrowded there
is not the need ot the Plug Ugly as an

that has bothered all Junior classes
since 1901—for the "Plug Ugly" did j

not accomplish its second purpose,
that of encouraging the male contin

out the year;" and now after a period
of fifteen years a committee is seeking
In 1898 college activities were not
numerous; dramatics were confined
to the Junior and Senior plays; jolly
ups were unknown; Encina Club held
no dances; the fraternities were fewer
in number and very seldom gave
formal dances. The promoters of the
"Plug Ugly" had in mind the estab
lishment of a college custom that
would, in time at least, attain high
rank. There was no intention of hav
ing a class rush, or of smashing hats,
but rather the idea of an amusing and
proper dedication of the plugs. The
best literary talent in the class wrote
the production, usually following the
idea of the Gridiron Club of Washing
ton, and availing themselves of the
"live issues of the day," to hit off the
local celebrites, especially members
of the Senior class.
