The first "Plug Ugly," given Octo
ber 1898, by the class of 1900, was for ;
the purpose, as stated in The Daily
Palo Alto, "of arousing class enthu- j
siasm and attempting by means of this
ceremony not only to revive the cus
tom of the Junior Plugs, hut to en
courage members to wear them
throughout the year."
The class of 1901 apparently faced
the same problem that bothers the
Junior class of the present day—and
that has bothered all Junior classes
since 1901—for the "Plug Ugly" did j

not accomplish its second purpose,
that of encouraging the male contin
gent to wear the headgear ''through
out the year;" and now after a period
of fifteen years a committee is seeking
In 1898 college activities were not
numerous; dramatics were confined
to the Junior and Senior plays; jolly
ups were unknown; Encina Club held
no dances; the fraternities were fewer
in number and very seldom gave
formal dances. The promoters of the
"Plug Ugly" had in mind the estab
lishment of a college custom that
would, in time at least, attain high
rank. There was no intention of hav
ing a class rush, or of smashing hats,
but rather the idea of an amusing and
proper dedication of the plugs. The
best literary talent in the class wrote
the production, usually following the
idea of the Gridiron Club of Washing
ton, and availing themselves of the
"live issues of the day," to hit off the
local celebrites, especially members
of the Senior class.
of the Senior class. An artistically
printed program, a souvenir of the
occasion, was sold for five cents to
defray the expenses of the entertain-
ment. The Daily reviewed the play
as follows: "The dedication of the
Junior Plug Ugly was an unqualified
success. An appreciative crowd made
the most of every opportunity to ap
plaud, yet in no case did they inter
fere with the speakers." Three col
umns were devoted to the review—
many of the original songs and verses
being published.
The class of 1901 continued the cus
tom, striving of course to attain a
higher standard than 1900, and The
Daily Palo Alto editorially compli
mented th.e class as follows:
"The Plug Ugly promises to be a
highly successful affair and will be
one of the most ambitious attempts at
class ceremony yet given, being far
more elaborate in plot and staging
than the very successful one of last
year. The class is highly commended
for its action in thus continuing the
ceremony which promises, if made
permanent, to be one of the most pleas
ing features of the college year."
For this production an attractive pro
gram printed by Stanley Tapler Com
pany of San Francisco was sold to defray
the expenses, and in giving an account
of the dress rehearsal The Daily Palo
Alto said, "The dress rehearsal was en
tirely satisfactory. The parts were well
learned and ably sustained, and those
who attended the ceremonies will be
well repaid. The costumes, furnished
by Goldstein & Company anr unique and
add much to the effectiveness of the per
formance." Reviewing the play it was
stated "The celebration was a distinct
success, and it. will, no doubt, become
an established custom."
The class of 1!»02 apparently had no
literary talent and was criticized for
"going outside of the class ' for an au
thor. Another radical deparure was
the charging of an admission fee of ten
cents "due to the considerable ax
pense incurred in addition to costumes."
An attendance of 1400 people was re
corded.
The custom of a poster was started by
the class of 1903, and the Sophomores at
a class meeting voted that they "would
not smash plugs, nor pay the admission
fee."
Referring to the play the Daily said,
"After the show some good natured
smashing took place on the Quad, Soph
omores adhering surprisingly well to
their resolution not to smash, most of it
being done by the Seniors."
The class of 1904 had 1800 in attend
ance and quoting from the Daily, "Th«
play was a conspicuous success. The
use of the Hand was a novelty. After
the play the Seniors rushed from the
bleachers and tried to smash the plugs.
The long line of Juniors wound its way
about the Campus into the Quad, fol
lowed by the Seniors and the two under
classes. The combats between the up
per classes continued for about an
hour."
The idea of offering a prize for the
best production originated with the
class of 1905 and a musical extrava
ganza, "The Fall of a Star," was se
lected, and the admission fee raised to
fifteen cents.
The next year, 1906, raised the admis
sion fee to twenty-live cents, and met
with a storm of protest from the stu
dents and editorially from the Daily.
The reason given for the increase in
price was "the larger expense incurred
with the production, which will be more
elaborate than heretofore."
The Seniors in class meeting voted to
jump the fence, and going to the show
in a body refused to pay the admission
fee. The attendance which had in pre
vious vears increased to 1800 and 2000

was reduced to 1500. In a very brief
mention of the affair the Daily said
"The play was not as good as last year,
but the struggle was the best that lias
taken place." Properly interpreted this
means that the rush and the smashing
of plugs had at last become the main
feature of the Plug Ugly celebration.
The original idea as explained before,
was an amusing and proper dedication
of the plugs. Later the more ambitious
had hopes of developing the custom of
an outdoor ceremony that would take
high rank in college theatricals, some
even daring to predict the development
of a historical pageant. For two or
three years the high standard was main
tained, but with the introduction of the
poster, the gradual development of the
rush, the increase in admission, and the

general rough-house attitude of tlie rival
classes, the play became of slight im
portance and little or 110 thought given
to its production, and the hope of the
ambitious has been rudely shattered.

The class of 1901 continued the cus
tom, striving of course to attain a
higher standard than 1900, and The
Daily Palo Alto editorially compli
mented th.e class as follows:
"The Plug Ugly promises to be a
highly successful affair and will be
one of the most ambitious attempts at
class ceremony yet given, being far
more elaborate in plot and staging
than the very successful one of last
year. The class is highly commended
for its action in thus continuing the
ceremony which promises, if made
permanent, to be one of the most pleas
ing features of the college year."
For this production an attractive pro
gram printed by Stanley Tapler Com
pany of San Francisco was sold to defray
the expenses, and in giving an account
of the dress rehearsal The Daily Palo
Alto said, "The dress rehearsal was en
tirely satisfactory. The parts were well
learned and ably sustained, and those
who attended the ceremonies will be
well repaid. The costumes, furnished
by Goldstein & Company anr unique and
add much to the effectiveness of the per
formance." Reviewing the play it was
stated "The celebration was a distinct
success, and it. will, no doubt, become
an established custom."
The class of 1!»02 apparently had no
literary talent and was criticized for
"going outside of the class ' for an au
thor. Another radical deparure was
the charging of an admission fee of ten
cents "due to the considerable ax
pense incurred in addition to costumes."
An attendance of 1400 people was re
corded.
The custom of a poster was started by
the class of 1903, and the Sophomores at
a class meeting voted that they "would
not smash plugs, nor pay the admission
fee."
Referring to the play the Daily said,
"After the show some good natured
smashing took place on the Quad, Soph
omores adhering surprisingly well to
their resolution not to smash, most of it
being done by the Seniors."
The class of 1904 had 1800 in attend
ance and quoting from the Daily, "Th«
play was a conspicuous success. The
use of the Hand was a novelty. After
the play the Seniors rushed from the
bleachers and tried to smash the plugs.
The long line of Juniors wound its way
about the Campus into the Quad, fol
lowed by the Seniors and the two under
classes. The combats between the up
per classes continued for about an
hour."
The idea of offering a prize for the
best production originated with the
class of 1905 and a musical extrava
ganza, "The Fall of a Star," was se
lected, and the admission fee raised to
fifteen cents.
The next year, 1906, raised the admis
sion fee to twenty-live cents, and met
with a storm of protest from the stu
dents and editorially from the Daily.
The reason given for the increase in
price was "the larger expense incurred
with the production, which will be more
elaborate than heretofore."
The Seniors in class meeting voted to
jump the fence, and going to the show
in a body refused to pay the admission
fee. The attendance which had in pre
vious vears increased to 1800 and 2000

was reduced to 1500. In a very brief
mention of the affair the Daily said
"The play was not as good as last year,
but the struggle was the best that lias
taken place." Properly interpreted this
means that the rush and the smashing
of plugs had at last become the main
feature of the Plug Ugly celebration.
The original idea as explained before,
was an amusing and proper dedication
of the plugs. Later the more ambitious
had hopes of developing the custom of
an outdoor ceremony that would take
high rank in college theatricals, some
even daring to predict the development
of a historical pageant. For two or
three years the high standard was main
tained, but with the introduction of the
poster, the gradual development of the
rush, the increase in admission, and the

general rough-house attitude of tlie rival
classes, the play became of slight im
portance and little or 110 thought given
to its production, and the hope of the
ambitious has been rudely shattered.

The first "Plug Ugly," given Octo
ber 1898, by the class of 1900, was for ;
the purpose, as stated in The Daily
Palo Alto, "of arousing class enthu- j
siasm and attempting by means of this
ceremony not only to revive the cus
tom of the Junior Plugs, hut to en
courage members to wear them
throughout the year."
The class of 1901 apparently faced
the same problem that bothers the
Junior class of the present day—and
that has bothered all Junior classes
since 1901—for the "Plug Ugly" did j

not accomplish its second purpose,
that of encouraging the male contin
gent to wear the headgear ''through
out the year;" and now after a period
of fifteen years a committee is seeking
In 1898 college activities were not
numerous; dramatics were confined
to the Junior and Senior plays; jolly
ups were unknown; Encina Club held
no dances; the fraternities were fewer
in number and very seldom gave
formal dances. The promoters of the
"Plug Ugly" had in mind the estab
lishment of a college custom that
would, in time at least, attain high
rank. There was no intention of hav
ing a class rush, or of smashing hats,
but rather the idea of an amusing and
proper dedication of the plugs. The
best literary talent in the class wrote
the production, usually following the
idea of the Gridiron Club of Washing
ton, and availing themselves of the
"live issues of the day," to hit off the
local celebrites, especially members
of the Senior class.
of the Senior class. An artistically
printed program, a souvenir of the
occasion, was sold for five cents to
defray the expenses of the entertain-
ment. The Daily reviewed the play
as follows: "The dedication of the
Junior Plug Ugly was an unqualified
success. An appreciative crowd made
the most of every opportunity to ap
plaud, yet in no case did they inter
fere with the speakers." Three col
umns were devoted to the review—
many of the original songs and verses
being published.
The class of 1901 continued the cus
tom, striving of course to attain a
higher standard than 1900, and The
Daily Palo Alto editorially compli
mented th.e class as follows:
"The Plug Ugly promises to be a
highly successful affair and will be
one of the most ambitious attempts at
class ceremony yet given, being far
more elaborate in plot and staging
than the very successful one of last
year. The class is highly commended
for its action in thus continuing the
ceremony which promises, if made
permanent, to be one of the most pleas
ing features of the college year."
For this production an attractive pro
gram printed by Stanley Tapler Com
pany of San Francisco was sold to defray
the expenses, and in giving an account
of the dress rehearsal The Daily Palo
Alto said, "The dress rehearsal was en
tirely satisfactory. The parts were well
learned and ably sustained, and those
who attended the ceremonies will be
well repaid. The costumes, furnished
by Goldstein & Company anr unique and
add much to the effectiveness of the per
formance." Reviewing the play it was
stated "The celebration was a distinct
success, and it. will, no doubt, become
an established custom."
The class of 1!»02 apparently had no
literary talent and was criticized for
"going outside of the class ' for an au
thor. Another radical deparure was
the charging of an admission fee of ten
cents "due to the considerable ax
pense incurred in addition to costumes."
An attendance of 1400 people was re
corded.
The custom of a poster was started by
the class of 1903, and the Sophomores at
a class meeting voted that they "would
not smash plugs, nor pay the admission
fee."
Referring to the play the Daily said,
"After the show some good natured
smashing took place on the Quad, Soph
omores adhering surprisingly well to
their resolution not to smash, most of it
being done by the Seniors."
The class of 1904 had 1800 in attend
ance and quoting from the Daily, "Th«
play was a conspicuous success. The
use of the Hand was a novelty. After
the play the Seniors rushed from the
bleachers and tried to smash the plugs.
The long line of Juniors wound its way
about the Campus into the Quad, fol
lowed by the Seniors and the two under
classes. The combats between the up
per classes continued for about an
hour."
The idea of offering a prize for the
best production originated with the
class of 1905 and a musical extrava
ganza, "The Fall of a Star," was se
lected, and the admission fee raised to
fifteen cents.
The next year, 1906, raised the admis
sion fee to twenty-live cents, and met
with a storm of protest from the stu
dents and editorially from the Daily.
The reason given for the increase in
price was "the larger expense incurred
with the production, which will be more
