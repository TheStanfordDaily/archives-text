# TRACK MEN TO RUN TOMORROW
## 
### 
A track meet will be held tomorrow
morning at 10:30 on the Stanford oval
providing a blinding rain does not
make competition impossible. Every
man who is out for track is expected
to report rain or sunshine. Those
who officiated at last Saturday's try
out are also asked to be present.
