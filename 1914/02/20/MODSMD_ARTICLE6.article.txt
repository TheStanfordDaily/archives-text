# DR. JORDAN TELLS EUROPE WHAT HE THINKS OF WAR
## WELL RECEIVED BY ENGLISH UNIVERSITIES Writes Interesting Letter on Tour Through Europeâ€”Will Reach Campus In August 
### 
The following letter has been received
from Chancellor David Starr Jordan,
dated January 20, and mailed from the
"Kleist," Nord Deutscher Lloyd Bre
men, "Over against the mouths of the
Nile."
Since we Stanford folks met at
the Redhouse in Kensington to cele
brate the football victory I have been
mostly engaged in telling the war
system of Europe what I think of it,
and hope Europe ought to get out of
it. The way out is through education
and travel, to learn each other's lan
guages, to find out what each nation is
thinking about and how human and
peaceful everybody of any conse
quence is anyhow. A German once
told me of his surprise when a young
'conscript,' to see a French conscript
kiss his mother and pat her shoulders,
when leaving for the barracks. He sup
posed that all Frenchmen were savage
beasts, without feeling. And there are
a good many in England and France
who tliink the same of the Germans.
Our problem is to teach the world
that no nation can gain anything by
war, and that war is a most uncertain
and ruinous menace to any end and that
if we have no evil designs on any other
nation, that other nations harbor no
evil designs against us."
Accompanied by Dr. John Metz of
Fried burg, the president-elect of the
Cosmopolitan Clubs, "Corda tratres,
of the world, I made a tour of the uni
versities and chief towns of England and
Scotland, making thirty-six speeches to
good audiences and without encounter
ing a pheasant, a rutabaga or a suffra
gette. I was especially well received in
London, Manchester and in the Scottish
universities. Afterwards I spoke in a
language I have been taught to call Ger
man in Frankfort, Wiesbaden, Stutt
gart, Mannheim and Munich. I was
made welcome in all those cities, espe"
cially in Munich, when the Stanford
delegation, Dr. Barkan, Professor Stu
art, J)r. Koclier and others formed a
friendly and useful "claque."
For a month afterward 1 was on the
Riviera of France, writing an article on
"America as Europe Sees Us," interest
ing to me, at least. Finally the Kleist
came into Genoa, and 1 got on board,
bound for Colombo and Melbourne,
leaving Mrs. Jordan at the Villa Santa
Rosa in Cannes.
I hope to be back in Bulgaria in April.
The nation is now open to visitors, a bit
disfigured, I am told, but still "in the
ring."
1 hope to reach Palo Alto the last of
August, with some new stories of fish, of
war and of peace. " Wenn jemand eine
Reise thut, so kann er was erzahlen."
Faithfully yours,
DAVID STARR JORDAN.
