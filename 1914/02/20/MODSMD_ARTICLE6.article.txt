# DR. JORDAN TELLS EUROPE WHAT HE THINKS OF WAR
## WELL RECEIVED BY ENGLISH UNIVERSITIES Writes Interesting Letter on Tour Through Europeâ€”Will Reach Campus In August

if we have no evil designs on any other
nation, that other nations harbor no
evil designs against us."

Scotland, making thirty-six speeches to

ing a pheasant, a rutabaga or a suffra

London, Manchester and in the Scottish
