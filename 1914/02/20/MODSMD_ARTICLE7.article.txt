# RAIN THREATENS FIRST OFF-CAMPUS BASEBALL
## TWELVE MEN IN SCHEDULE TO GO TO ST. MARY'S Men Will Take Opportunity To Be Measured For Suits At Spaulding's Store 
### 
Chances begin to look pretty damp
for 1 lie Varsitv's trip to Oakland, where
they are scheduled to meet St. Mary's
nine Saturday. But if the floods abate
twelve Cardinal batsmen will journey
across the bay for their lirst game on a
foreign diamond this year.
The players for the off-campus game
include two batteries. Maple and Dent
are to be used in the opening innings,
while Hayes and Landers will relieve
them at the end of the fifth inning.
The regular infield, consisting of Work
man, Stafford and McCloskey on the
bases, with Captain Terry in the short
stop position, will have Stevens as an
alternate. Ilalnt, Day and Noonan, out
fielders, complete the list scheduled to
make the journey.
The team will leave Palo Alto on the
11:36 train Saturday morning, which
will allow Manager Wilcox ample time
to have the men measured for suits at
Spalding's San Francisco store. This
is the most convenient opportunity to
have the men measured for suits to be
used in the intercollegiate series. These
measurements will be kept on file by
the firm, to be available for orders later
in the season when the liiial composi
tion of the team has been determined.
Three o'clock is the time set for play
to begin on the St. Mary's diamond.
This" is the only game of the season
scheduled with the Oaklanders on their
home grounds.
