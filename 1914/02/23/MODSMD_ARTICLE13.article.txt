Editor, The Daily Palo Alto:
Having just read the communi
cation by "Alumnus," in yours of Feb
ruary 16, I am tempted to ask Alum
nus the following questions:
Are laws made and enforced for the
protection of the honest or dishonest
members of a community?
Does the vigilant eye of the detec
tive incite the criminal to commit
crimes?
Does the honest bookkeeper feel de
graded by having his accounts au
dited?
Does the clean football player or
the dirty, tricky player dread the keen
eye of the referee?
Does any system that tends to
eliminate fraud reflect on tlve honesty
of the square man?
Are University students other than
human?
"An Oustider."
