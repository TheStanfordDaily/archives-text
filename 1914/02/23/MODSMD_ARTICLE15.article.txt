## 
### 
Professor J. A. Schumpeter, ex
change professor from Austria to the
United States for tlie year 1913-14,
lectured this morning in room 214 on
the subject of "Austrian Railroads."
Mr. Schumpeter is the head of the
Department of Economics at the Uni
versity of Gratz, Austria. For the
past few months he has been touring
the United States visiting the various
universities of the country.
His remarks in part were as fol
lows:
"At present the Austrian govern
ment owns all the railroads except
one short line which will not pay.
The history of the control and organ
ization of these roads has been a var
ied one. in 1536 the innovation of
the railroad began with the awarding
of a charter to a private company.
"After the alliance with Germany
and Italy, and the change of the cur
rency policy, Austria rapidly gained
strength. A system of guarantees
was introduced, which assured all pri
vate companies that would undertake
the management of railroads a min
imum return. The result was a con
tinual loss to the government, and an
other change of policy.
"Whether private or government
ownership is the best after numerous
experiments is still a question. Nei
ther system has been satisfactory. Big
problems such as geographic difficul
ties and scarcity of traffic have made
the task of railroad regulation an ar
duous one. In considering the ques
tion it should be remembered that not
only the financial side must he consid
ered but also the excellence of service.
Private roads with good opportunities
have surpassed the government in
this respect. No signs of political cor
ruption are noticeable in state lines.
"The United States and England are
very good instances of efficient rail
roads under private control. In those
countries they experience great ad
vantages. In Austria there are no
wonderful possibilities. Government
ownership has remedied none of the
evils that existed under private con
trol of railroads.
