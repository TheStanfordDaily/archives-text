# TICKETS ARE READY FOR FOUNDERS' DAY DINNER
## REASONABLE PRICE IS SET BY COMMITTEE IN CHARGE Faculty, Alumni, Former Students and Undergraduates Will "Get-Together" In Informal Affair 
### 
Preliminary arrangements are now
under way for the celebration of the
fourth annual Founders' Day Dinner,
to be held in Encina clubroom at 6:30
o'clock on the evening of Founders'
Day, Monday, March 9.
A joint committee from the Skull
and Snakes and Cap and Gown soci
eties have issued one thousand invi
tations to Stanford graduates in San
Francisco, Oakland, Berkeley, San
.lose, and nearby coast towns, bidding
them to share in the informal "get
together" on the campus. This gen
eral committee is composed of C. W.
Knight, '14. E. L. Peck, '13, and F. E.
Rehm, '15, and three representatives of
Cap and Gown, whose names ha ,r e not
yet been announced.
It is particularly desired that
former students who did not graduate
be also notified of the dinner. As
there is no list of their names, the
fraternities and sororities are request
ed to inform their non-graduate mem
bers to this effect.
The price of the dinner has been
fixed at $1.25 in order to keep the
affair within the reach of every under
graduate. This dinner will therefore
cost only one-half the amount of
former affairs, while there will be a
menu of equal, if not superior, at
tractiveness. The details of the din
ner are being arranged by several
subcommittees composed of both
alumni and undergraduates, who are
uniting to insure the success of the
great reunion.
The Publicity committee is composed
of the Misses Callie Smith, '14, Mar
gery Bailey, '14, and Bornice Jame
son, '15, and the Messrs. O. H. Castle,
