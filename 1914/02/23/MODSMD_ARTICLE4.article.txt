### 
Feminine basketball honors fell to
the Stanford women who met the
University of Nevada team on Satur
day morning at Encina gymnasium,
when the visitors were defeated with
a score of 28 to 12.
Plentiful amusement and excitement
was afforded the spectators during the
contest. The play on both sides was
lively and consistent, the Stanford

ient, because of the limitations of an
indoor court, and the play on the
whole was confined to the usual field
tactics. Miss Sameth, of Nevada,
acted as referee and Miss Burrell, of
Stanford, as umpire.
