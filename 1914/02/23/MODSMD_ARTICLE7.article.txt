# Interscholastic Winners Will Be Given Watches
## 
### 
Watches will replace gold medals
as trophies for first places in the
Stanford interscholastic track and
field meet this year. This was the de
cision reached by the board of gov
ernors on Saturday afternoon. Never
before has such an innovation been in
troduced on the Pacific Coast in prep
aratory school meets, but it is some
thing which has gained great com
mendation in the Eastern interschol
astic meets.
The winner of each event will re
ceive a watch of standard quality and
workmanship inclosed in a gold filled
case. Timepieces will also be award
ed to the members of the winning re
lay team and to the winners of the
singles and doubles championship in
tennis.
In making this change from a gold
medal to a watch the board believes
that they are awarding the contest
ing athletes something more useful
and something that will be prized more
highly than a medal. The watches
will be of special design and en
graved. As yet the contract for these
watches has not been placed. Details
in regard to the make, number of
jewels, and kind of case will be decid
ed this week.
Besides giving watches for first
place, second and third place men will
receive silver and bronze medals, re
spectively as heretofore, attached to
best pigskin leather with buckles to
match the medals.
Bids were received and opened on
Saturday for furnishing both watches
and medals, but the awarding of the
contract was deferred until a latter
date.
Souvenir medals, which allow the
athletes entrance to the different
events going on that week which they
are here, were given lust year for the
first time to every contesting athlete.
The medals were so unique and so
well liked by the "prep" school boys
that the board has decided to continue
this scheme and will award every
entry on arrival at the campus a
souvenir medal, similar to the one
used last year, only with a different
shaped S. These medals are brass
with German silver coating and bear
the inscription "Stanford Interschol
astic 1914."
On account of the rain no track meet
was held on Saturday. The cinder
path has dried out very rapidly, how
ever, and the athletes will be in togs
again this afternoon.
