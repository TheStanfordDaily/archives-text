Not all of us are privileged to study the theory of education in
Stanford's admirable Department of Education. Yet it requires not
so much a knowledge of theory as the possession of a little elementary
common sense to arrive at the conclusion that the ideal University grad
uate is not the man of narrow point of view, supreme though he may be
in some live or dead branch of learning; but the man of intelligent inter
est in many things—the man of "culture." The best education is not
always that which we "pursue" in the classroom but that which we
come upon without pursuit. With all respect to the faculty of this insti
tution. we believe we will get more education out of an hour with Ivreis
ler next Monday evening than out of the same length of time in any
classroom. Sincerely we thank the faculty members for their endeavors
to give us this musical treat, and urge a hearty cooperation on the part of
the (University public in order that the proposed concert may be a success
and the forerunner of a series of similar events. And to this end—may
Tuesday be not an open season for examinations!
