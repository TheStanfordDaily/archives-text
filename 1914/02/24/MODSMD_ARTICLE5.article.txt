# TRACK SQUAD ENGAGED IN SPRING PREPARATION
## QUARTER MILE LEADS OTHER EVENTS IN POPULARITY. Majority of Candidates Prefer Races on Oval te Competition in the Field. 
### 
Now that track work is in full
'swing and the big meet loss than two
months away a brief survey may lie
taken of the work of the men who
| are striving on the oval. To date, a
hundred and seventy candidates have
signed up for track, and most of them
are training regularly under the di
rection of the assistant coaches. The
Saturday meets have brought the men
into competition and promising new
material has been discovered in several
events.
In point of popularity among the
events, the quarter mile has 37 up
holders. leading the half milers by
nine. Captain P. B. McKee, '14, attri
butes this popularity to the fact that
| most inexperienced men believe them
selves fitted for this race because they
have neither the speed for the sprints
nor the endurance for the greater dis
tances. This is not generally true, as
quarter milers require both of these
[ qualities.
Next to the 880 men, who number
28, the sprinters rank third with 23.
Following in rank of numbers comes
the two mile with 17, the mile with
15, broad jump with 13, pole vault
with 10, hurdles and high jump with
8 apiece, shot put with 7 and hammer
throw with 6. Twelve men are cred
ited with "no event." It will be seen
that the races on the oval are the
most popular. The cinder path claims
128 of the 177, and the field events
but sfi. Several of the candidates are
signed up for more than one event
which accounts for the discrepancy
in the total.
