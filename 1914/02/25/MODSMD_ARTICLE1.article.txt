# CLARK STATES THAT FUR SEAL POLICY IS BLUNDER
## ACADEMIC SECRETARY SCORES RECENT TREATY. Submits Formal Statement at Washington Pointing Out Mistake of Prohibiting Land Sealing. 
### 
Mr. G. A. Clark, academic secretary
of Stanford University, is now in
Washington, D. C., where he is testi
fying on Pribylof island fur sealing
before the House Committee on Ex
penditures in the Department of Com
merce. He has presented to that com
mittee a formal statement setting forth
his claim that the present policy of the
Government in prohibiting a land sea
son is a blunder.
A bill introduced in the House Feb
ruary 11, 1912, which has since be
come a law, is the cause of the present
closed season in Alaska, as it gives
effect to certain provisions of the
treaty of July 7, 1911. This treaty,
which was finally ratified after long
continued effort, obtained for the
United States the cooperation of Great
Britain, Russia and Japan in abolish
ing pelagic sealing for fifteen years.
The United States and Russia, as
owners of the principal fur seal herds,
agreed in this treaty to pay to Great
Britain and Japan 15 per cent each of
the product of their land sealing oper
ations. This treaty went into effect
with the season of 1912, and as a re
sult the number of breeding females
has increased on the Pribylof islands.
No land killing is permitted from 1913
to 1917, although a small and limited
number of seals may be killed for food
for the natives on the islands.
Secretary Clark told the commit
tee that he thought this policy of pro
hibiting land sealing a mistake, as it
was detrimental to the herd, besides
causing financial loss to the Govern
ment. He believes that land killing
confined to the superfluous male seals
will not endanger the life of the seal
herd.
"Government management of the
fur-seal herd has been marked by one
compensative defect —lack of persist
ent, intelligent, trained oversight,"
says Secretary Clark's statement.
"The present suspension of land kill
ing is a clumsy and wasteful way of
accomplishing a certain end, the guar
anteeing to the herd of an adequate
supply of breeding males. This is a
very important problem, but it should
have a sane solution. To overstock
the herd at one time and then let it go
indefinitely without attention is not
the proper way to deal with it. A
definite plan of maintaining an annual
increment of breeding males should
be wrought out and put in operation
with a scheme for permanently mark
ing the animals. To make the killing
grounds safe there should be devel
loped a water system with water
available. Killing fields could be
established wherever needed."

the product of their land sealing oper
ations. This treaty went into effect
with the season of 1912, and as a re
sult the number of breeding females
has increased on the Pribylof islands.
No land killing is permitted from 1913
to 1917, although a small and limited
number of seals may be killed for food
for the natives on the islands.
Secretary Clark told the commit
tee that he thought this policy of pro
hibiting land sealing a mistake, as it
was detrimental to the herd, besides
causing financial loss to the Govern
ment. He believes that land killing
confined to the superfluous male seals
will not endanger the life of the seal
herd.
"Government management of the
fur-seal herd has been marked by one
compensative defect —lack of persist
ent, intelligent, trained oversight,"
says Secretary Clark's statement.
"The present suspension of land kill
ing is a clumsy and wasteful way of
accomplishing a certain end, the guar
anteeing to the herd of an adequate
supply of breeding males. This is a
very important problem, but it should
have a sane solution. To overstock
the herd at one time and then let it go
indefinitely without attention is not
the proper way to deal with it. A
definite plan of maintaining an annual
increment of breeding males should
be wrought out and put in operation
with a scheme for permanently mark
ing the animals. To make the killing
grounds safe there should be devel
loped a water system with water
available. Killing fields could be
established wherever needed."
