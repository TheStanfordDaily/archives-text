# CLARK STATES THAT FUR SEAL POLICY IS BLUNDER
## ACADEMIC SECRETARY SCORES RECENT TREATY. Submits Formal Statement at Washington Pointing Out Mistake of Prohibiting Land Sealing. 
### 
Mr. G. A. Clark, academic secretary
of Stanford University, is now in
Washington, D. C., where he is testi
fying on Pribylof island fur sealing
before the House Committee on Ex
penditures in the Department of Com
merce. He has presented to that com
mittee a formal statement setting forth
his claim that the present policy of the
Government in prohibiting a land sea
son is a blunder.
A bill introduced in the House Feb
ruary 11, 1912, which has since be
come a law, is the cause of the present
closed season in Alaska, as it gives
effect to certain provisions of the
treaty of July 7, 1911. This treaty,
which was finally ratified after long
continued effort, obtained for the
United States the cooperation of Great
Britain, Russia and Japan in abolish
ing pelagic sealing for fifteen years.
The United States and Russia, as
owners of the principal fur seal herds,
agreed in this treaty to pay to Great
Britain and Japan 15 per cent each of
the product of their land sealing oper
ations. This treaty went into effect
with the season of 1912, and as a re
sult the number of breeding females
has increased on the Pribylof islands.
