# SENIOR WEEK
## 
### 
The first gun has been fired in the battle for a bigger and better
Senior Week. The enemies in the fight are going to be those tough
and tried veterans, Lack of Time 'and Procrastination. No doubt the
conscientious men and women whom President Watkins has appointed
on his Senior committees realize that their remaining days on this
pleasant Farm are numbered and that if they would celebrate the climax
of four years by a fitting Senior week it will only be by dint of ceaseless
preparation. The weeks left in the semester will lie checked off with
unbelievable rapidity on Stanford's overcrowded calendar, and only this
unremitting effort will prevent those arranging for Fourteen'* Senior
Week from facing Final Examination torment with preparations for
the many events only half laid. So we urge these Seniors to look on
their committee memberships, not as "honors," but as good stiff jobs.
For Senior Week, Stanford's most characteristic merrymaking, has yet
undeveloped possibilities for a rousing reunion of the Four Elements of
Stanford life while carnival drives care from every nook and corner of
the sunshiny Quad.
