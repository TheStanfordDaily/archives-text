# Eddy Will Speak To Student Body In Next Assembly
## 
### 
Sherwood Eddy, secretary for Asia
of the Young Men's Christian Associa
tion, will speak to the student body at
an assembly to be held on Tuesday,
March 3, at 11:15. The subject of his
address will be "The Renaissance of
Asia," and he will describe the great
progressive movements which are at
the present time sweeping over China,
Japan and India. The past few years
have witnessed the destruction of the
Manchu dynasty in China, the rapid
growth of popular opinion in Japan,
and a general spirit of unrest in In
dia, and in all of these movements the
students of Asia as well as the re
turned students from America and
Europe, are taking the most promi
nent parts.
Secretary Eddy is especially quali
fied to speak on such a subject. A
graduate of Yale, and holder of an
advanced degree from Princeton, he
spent fifteen years as a self-sustaining
missionary in India, and from that
work entered the Young Men's Chris
tian Association. As the general di
rector of the association's work in
Asia, which is largely concerned with
students, he has traveled widely
through China, Korea. Japan, India
and the near East, and has come in
contact with the leaders of opinion
in the Orient. His familiarity with
the great intellectual, moral, and
material developments which are in
process there, will unquestionably
make his address one of great inter
est to an American student body.
