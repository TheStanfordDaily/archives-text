# Spirited Debates Feature Forensic Society Sessions
## 
### 
Euphronia and Nestoria discussed
topics of political concern at their
regular weekly meetings yesterday
evening. Each debating organization
held a session of unusual interest and
spirit.
Nestoria resolved itself into the
form of the United States Senate for
the discussion of the bill "Resolved,
That all postmasters should be elected
directly by the people." The purpose
was to educate the members in the
principles of parliamentary govern
ment. There were several chairmen,
each one being ousted when making
some executive error. The bill was
introduced by It. F. Downing, '15,
while J. D. Adams, '15, led the opposi
tion. After several amendments to the
measure, it was finally put on the
table.
"Resolved, That the maximum limit
on parcel post packages be increased
on January 1, 1915 ,to one hundred
pounds," was the question open for
debate by Euphronia. \V. A. Clark,
'15, introduced the resolution, while
the opposition to the measure was led
by R. C. Jensen, '10. No decision was
awarded in favor of either side, since
the whole house entered actively into
the discussion. After the regular de
bate, the advisability of forming a
Stanford Debating Union was discus
sed in impromptu fashion.
Next week the regular sessions of
the societies will be postponed owing
to the lectures which will be given by
Sherwood Eddy throughout the week.
