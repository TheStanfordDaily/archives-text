## NEED ADDITIONAL $5,000 TO COMPLETE STRUCTURE Committee of Thirty-three Appointed To Raise Part of Sum Among Students. 
### 
An active campaign will be waged
immediately among the undergradu
ates of the University through, the
medium of a committee of thirty-three
appointed by the Executive Committee
last evening to raise the sum neces
sary for the completion of the Stan
ford Union. Approximately $5,000 re
mains to be collected of the $32,000
which will be necessary to complete
the structure. E. \V. Smith, '99, per
manent secretary of the Stanford
Union and E. C .Behrens, '14, campus
secretary, are uniting to raise this
sum immediately among the alumni
and undergraduates.
Although the alumni can be depend
ed on to give a part of the sum re
quired ,the fact that nearly all of the
money now in the treasury of the
Union has been raised among them,
is given as a reason why the remaind
er should largely come from the now
enrolled students.
The starting of construction on the
Union makes it imperative that the
entire cost of the structure be raised
at once in order to meet bills as they
come due. The object of the present
campaign is to have the entire amount
raised and all money pledged to the
Union in by the end of the semester
when building will be finished.
The committee of thirty-three which
is given below is comprised of one
member from each fraternity and club,
who will look after the collecting in
