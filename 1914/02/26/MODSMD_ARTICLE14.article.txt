# STAFF TRYOUT
## 
### 
Numerous inquiries have been received as to whether there will be
further try-outs for the staff of The Daily Palo Alto this semester. In
response we would state that the staff of this paper is already as large as
can be comfortably handled. There is always a place, however, for the
man who proves himself too good to be left off. For the benefit of any
who wish to take advantage of this fighting chance to show exceptional
ability an informal try-out will be conducted for the remainder of the
semester. Those who desire to try out may report at this office at i:30
o'clock any afternoon up to and including next Thursday.
