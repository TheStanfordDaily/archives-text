Editor, Daily Palo Alto;
Dear Sir: —
In last Monday's issue of The Dail>
Palo Alto, there appeared a communi
cation signed "An Outsider," which
sharply critized a recent article writ
ten by "An Alumnus" advocating the
adoption of the Honor System at Stan
ford. To my mind this "Outsider" de
serves nothing but censure for put
ting into print such a grossly mislead
ing and fallacious composition. His
communication consisted of a series
of questions, which are as follows:
First, "Are laws made and enforced
for the protection of the honest or
dishonest members of a community?"
It is irrefutable that certain laws are
enacted for the safeguarding of the
better class. But, if this law, name
ly the present system of carrying on
honest examinations, does not protect
the honest nor impede the dishonest
from cheating, would it not be far
wiser to place the care of these dis
honest in the hands of the students,
and enforce the ruling as has been
done in the Law department?
Again it is asked, "Does the vigilant
eye of the detective incite the criminal
to commit crimes?" Such an analogy
is extremely offensive to Stanford.
F'rst the faculty are spoken of as de
tectives, which is an insult, and fur
thermore those cheating students —
every one has many misguided friends
who do so —are termed as criminals!
A detective is a drawback to the crim
inal. But in the case of the professor
watching over the students, there is
rather an incentive to cheat.
A third question asked by this

"Alumnus" is "Does any system that
tends to eliminate fraud reflect on the
honesty of the square man?" We ad
mit, certainly not. But does the pres
ent system tend to eliminate fraud?
It is undeniable that it does not do
so. Every day cheating is some
where going on in an examination.
"Are University students other than
human? This last assumption is the
only correct one made by the "Out
sider." Having shown the fallacies
of the previous questions, it now has
no bearing on the present argument.
I believe that it is the earnest de
sire of the majority of students at
Stanford to see the Honor System in
stalled. Let a Student Body meeting
be called for the discussion of this
important issue. If carried, as it un
doubtedly will be, the whole moral
standard of the University will be
raised to the goal where it should
now stand.
