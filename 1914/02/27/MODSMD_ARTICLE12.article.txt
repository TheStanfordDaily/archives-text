A university without peculiarities would be about as interesting as
a man without a personality. One of our peculiarities here at Stanford is
that we prefer to celebrate the day set apart for the big-hearted, very
human Founders of the University by making merry for a while and
then sitting down all together right here on the Farm and eating and
talking and maybe thinking a bit, rather than by sending a chosen few
up to the city to spend a dull evening in mournful clothes carrying out
the general color scheme set by "the long tables and the small black
coffee." The historical sketch of the Founders' Day celebration in to
day's issue shows that the progress of the event has been from formality
to informality. We congratulate the committees in charge on having
arranged for this year the most informal, the most attractive, and the
most brimful of meaning of all the programs.
The subject is brought up at this time because we want to urge,
before anyone plans to spend March 9 away from the campus, that no
such plans be made. Every Stanford student should be present, at thi>
most important Stanford affair 011 the calendar. It is his one big oppor
tunity to show gratitude and respect to those who have made possible his
University; and lie should seize it even at some sacrifice to himself. Not
that we think it will be a sacrifice. Quite the contrary, what with the
various exercises and sports and the informal dinnerâ€”informal even if
we are to eat fromage and crabes. After all, what's in a name?
