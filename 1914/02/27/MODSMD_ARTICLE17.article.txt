# WITHOUT THE GARLIC THAT FRENCHY MENU MEANS ROAST TURKEY
## 
### 
The menu a la Francaise printed in
yesterday's Daily Palo Alto has
aroused wide-spread interest on the
campus. There remains, however, in
certain rough-neck centers distress
ing ignorance as to the meaning of
certain highly significant items in the
list of nourriture et do Doisson—as
one says in French when one speaks
of things to eat and drink at an in
formal dinner. And since it was evi
dently the object of the committee in
charge to attract people to the din
ner by means of this bill of fare, the
Daily Palo Alto lends its further as
sistance today.
While it is possible, by remembering
the meaning of most of the terms by
reading phonetically,—"crabes" for in
stance presumptively being French for
"crabs," "chese" French for "cheese,"
(fromage being evidently an alterna
tive form) and while such gimcracks
as olives, pickles and butter seemingly
are the same in French as in English,
there remain two unsolved mysteries,
which it turns out upon investigation
are really the most important of all.
We are glad, therefor, to be able to
announce authoritatively that "Huit
res au Kari" is really "creamed oys
ters," and "Dinde rotie" is actually
"roast turkey." Moreover, we are as
sured that the caterer's disguise of
these two extends no further than in
the naming of them and that he will
produce them in man-sized portions
and not in the diminutive samples that
are frequently indicated by French
nomenclature.
