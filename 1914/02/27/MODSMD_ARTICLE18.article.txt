# MYSTERY SHROUDS CALLING OF TRACK MEN TOGETHER
## 
### 
Orders have been posted in ithe
training house by Captain P. B. Mc-
Ivee, '14, that every man who is out for
track, and there are over 175, must re
port to him on the cinder path at six
o'clock on Tuesday evening-. This is
after the athletes have completed their
daily workout. When asked what this
was for he said that it was enough for
him to post the order and that it was
of the utmost importance that every
man be on hand at the appointed time.
Next week is the first of March and
whether or not this has anything to do
with calling the men together remains
a mystery. Intimations are that it is
advisable for everyone to be there.
Questions are in order, but hard to
answer.
