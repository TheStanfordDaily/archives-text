# DEPARTMENT OF HISTORY PROVIDES NEW LIBRARY
## President Branner Donates Valuable Brazilian Collection for Use in Reading Room. 
### 
Reading rooms and a special library
for history students will occupy
rooms 229 and 230 of the History
building which are now being made
over for that purpose. The new quar
ters will be finished by the first of
next week and the new facilities for
the members of the department will
be moved in immediately.
Room 229 will house the valuable
collection of works on Brazil and
Latin America, which has been
donated to the University by President
Branner. This collection consists of
nearly a thousand books and pamph
lets, containing a great deal of very
valuable material on the history of
Latin America and especially of Bra
zil. One set of lu2 volumes, compris
ing a complete series of the laws of
Brazil from 180S to 1906, is extremely
rare and probably the only collection
of the kind in the United States.
Other sets are the Revisto Do Instituto
Historico, the leading Brazilian His
torical Review; the Correio Brazil
iense, a political and literary review
containing invaluable material for the
history of Brazil during the period
from 1808 to 1816: 14 volumes of doc
uments dealing with Portuguese colon
ial activity in Africa, Asia and Brazil.
Valuable copies of two periodicals,
the O Novo Mundo and the Rio News,
which contain data on the important
periods when Brazil abolished slavery
and established the Republic also
form a part of the collection. Beside
these, there is a large number of val
uable government documents, stand
ard treaties on Brazilian history,
travels and memoirs, some of which
were secured by Assistant Professor
P. A. Martin, during his recent trip in
Brazil.
Room 230 is to be used as a reading
room for students taking courses in
the History department, and dupli
cates of the works in the general
library are to put at their disposal.
The purpose of this room is to relieve
the congestion in the general library,
and to provide a convenient place of
study for history students. It will
be equipped with tables, chairs and
shelving adequate for approximately a
thousand books.
A plan for the management of the
reading room has been drawn up and
will be announced when the library is
opened to students.
