# CHANGES IN COMEDY CAST ARE MADE BY SOPHOMORES
## LELAND WILL PORTRAY PERSON OF VILLAGE DRUGGIST. Roles of Wall Street Promoter and Plunder Taken by Wakefield and Wenzel. 
### 
Several important changes have been
made In the cast of "The Fortune
Hunter," the Sophomore comedy which
will be played in the Assembly Hall
March 14. With the new personell
finally determined, rehearsals have
reached a good stage of completion.
The role of Sam Graham, the coun
try druggist in Radville has been as
signed to P. E. Leland. J. M. Fitz
hugh, who was first cast for the part
has withdrawn from the performance
on account of other work. Graham
is one of the most likeable people in
the play. He is pictured as an easy
going man with an inventive genius,
which finds expression through the
help of the Fortune Hunter, who
comes to clerk in his store.
C. R. Wakefield has replaced F. S.
Hollister as James Long, a young Wall
street plunger who figures pri
marily in the first act.
George Burnham, a live New York
promoter who misses an opportunity
to buy up Graham's gas manufactur
ing light for a song will be played by
R. N. Wenzel. Leland was origin
ally picked for the part of Burnham.
Much of the value of "The Fortune
Hunter" depends on the spontaneous
flow of action and humor which keeps
the story moving rapidly throughout.
Rehearsals to date have accomplish
ed good speaking acquaintance of the
cast with all the parts. Original and
prescribed business are being rapidly
learned, and the play is taking on well
rounded attractiveness.
