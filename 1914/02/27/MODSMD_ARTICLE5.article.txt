# SENIOR WOMEN REVIVE. OLD WEEKLY SONGEEST
## 
### 
An ancient custom which has been
allowed to slip into oblivion since the
university has out-grown its early
childhood was revived last night at a
meeting of the women of the class of
1014. This custom is the weekly song
fest. in the Inner Quad, which in other
days served the purpose of bringing
together the Senior women for a few
moments every week. Choosing
Founders' Day as an opportune time to
revive the singing, the women decided
to proceed to the Inner Quad immed
iately after the banquet, and on all
other Monday evenings will meet at
9:45 for a half hour of song.
