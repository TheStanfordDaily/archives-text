Development Traced
It is of interest to note the devel
opment of Founders' Day and its mean
ing to the University. The day has
been celebrated almost since the
founding of the institution in memory
of the birth of Senator Stanford.
Several years ago the custom of hold
ing a banquet was introduced and held
in San Francisco. It was a most form
al, exclusive affair with only graduate
men in attendance. The following
year women were invited and last
year the place of holding the banquet
was changed to the campus. It was
made an affair for the undergraduates
as well as the alumni and the formal
ity of the occasion was done away
with. Founders' Day is a time when
the graduates and undergraduates
come together to discuss the purposes
of the founders of the University and
I to talk over the progress which the in
situation has made compared with
i other educational centers.
Founders' Day was instituted in
1894, the year after the death of Sen
ator Stanford, and has been observed
ever since. Mrs. Stanford is known as
having- expressed the wish that all ob
servances of this sort should be settled
011 March 9, the anniversary of Sena
tor Stanford's birth. This day is the
logical time for recalling the history
and achievements of the University
and its founders.
Encina Gymnasium was the scene of
the first celebration of Founders' Day
in 1894. It marked the first time that
the entire university community had
gathered together. The Honorable
Horace Davis, as speaker of the day,
expressed himself as follows:
"It is a happy suggestion to set
apart one day in the year to commem
orate the wisdom and generosity of the
founders of this great institution."
After the address, extracts were read
from eulogies of the late Senator Stan
ford, which had been delivered before
the United States Congress in Wash
ington a short time before. Mr. Da
vis then read Newcomer's "Memorial
Ode."
Student Celebration Urged
In 1895, The Daily Palo Alto com
mented editorially as follows:
"It is not enough for the students
to meet and listen to a program pre
sented by members of the faculty;
there should be a student celebration
as well â€”a general observance of a
day set apart for showing loyalty to
alma mater and her traditions."
Tn the evenino-, exercises were held
in the Chapel. A feature of the occa
sion was the singing of the Founders'
Day Hymn, entitled "The Wind of
Freedom," written by Professor A. W.
Smith, author of "Hail, Stanford, Hail."
University Holiday Declared
In 1896, Founders' Day occurred on a
Monday and a University holiday was
declared. Exercises were again held
in the Chapel in the evening. The Glee
Club sang the "Founders' Day Hymn"
and Mr. John S. Hittell, of San Fran
cisco, gave interesting reminiscences
of his friendship with Senator Stan
ford.
Vice-President J. M. Stillman, of
Stanford University, was the speaker
in 1897, and the Honorable Francis E.
Spencer, who was then president of
the Board of Trustees, in 1898.
A University holiday was declared on
Founders' Day in 1899. President
Martin Kellogg, of the University of
California, gave the address. In 1900,
Bishop Nichols was the speaker and in
1901 Charles F. Lummis, of Los
Angeles, spoke in the Assembly Hall.
Rev. James T. Jenness. '92, deliver
ed the sermon in 1902, Founders' Day
occurring on a Sunday in that year.

The following year, 1903, a holiday
was declared on Monday and on Sun
day, Rev. Heber Newton, the Univer
sity preacher, delivered the sermon in
Memorial Church.
Mr. John P. Irish made a plea for
Founders' Day in the Assembly Hall
in 1904, urging that the holiday should
be considered less lightly in the fu
ture. In 1905, Ilev. Robert J. Bur
dette delivered a sermon in Memorial
Chapel, the holiday occurring on a
Thursday. Mrs. Stanford had died less
than two weeks before, hence the cele
bration was now officially termed
"Founders' Day" instead of "Founder's
Day," as it had been called previously
in order to refer to Senator Stanford
alone.
The Assembly Hall was the scene of
the exercises in 1906 and the speak
ers were Dean Hodges, Chaplain Gard
ner, Professor M. 13. Anderson and
William James, the philosopher.
In 1907 a Sunday sermon was held
and in 1908 an assembly. In 1909, a
general assembly was called and Dr.
Jordan and Professor A. C. Miller,
of the University of California, were
the speakers. After the session, Presi
dent. Roth of the Student Body, called
a meeting of the men students for the
initial formation of a University Con
ference.
President J. A. B. Sherer, of the
Throop Polytechnic Institute of Pasa
dena, addressed the 1910 assembly.
Mr. James A. Mac Donald, editor of the
Toronto Globe, spoke in 1911. This
year marked the celebration of the
first banquet in honor of Founders'
Day. It was held in the Palace Hotel
in San Francisco.
The Honorable Horace Davis, of the
Board of Trustees, delivered the ad
dress at the exercises in the Assembly
Hall in 1912. Dr. Henry Van Dyke,
of Princeton University, delivered the
Sunday morning sermon in the As
sembly Hall in 1913. The Daily Palo
Alto commented editorially on the sec
ond Alumni banquet as follows:
"The Alumni banquet on Saturday
was a success. The holding of this an
niversary affair on the campus was a
step in the right direction and we hope
to see it continued. While there was
not as large a representation from the
Student Body as there should have
been, the fact that this was the first
event of the nature to be held here
must be taken into account. With the
permanent establishment of this event
on the campus, counter attractions can
be eliminated and the gathering will
assume its proper place in the eyes of
the students."
