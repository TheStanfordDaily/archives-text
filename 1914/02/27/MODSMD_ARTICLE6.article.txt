Development Traced
It is of interest to note the devel
opment of Founders' Day and its mean
ing to the University. The day has
been celebrated almost since the
founding of the institution in memory
of the birth of Senator Stanford.
Several years ago the custom of hold
ing a banquet was introduced and held
in San Francisco. It was a most form
al, exclusive affair with only graduate
men in attendance. The following
year women were invited and last
year the place of holding the banquet
was changed to the campus. It was
made an affair for the undergraduates
as well as the alumni and the formal
ity of the occasion was done away
with. Founders' Day is a time when
the graduates and undergraduates
come together to discuss the purposes
of the founders of the University and
I to talk over the progress which the in
situation has made compared with
i other educational centers.
