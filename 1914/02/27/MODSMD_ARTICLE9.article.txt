# INFORMAL TRACK MEET INCLUDES FULL PROGRAM
## DISTANCES WILL BE SHORTENED IN EVERY EVENT. All Candidates are Requested to Report Before 10:30 at Training House Unless Excused. 
### 
With ideal spring weather tomorrow,
similar to that of the past three days,
the track athletes will probably show
great improvement over previous early
season competition. The meet is
scheduled to start promptly at 10:30.
Both contestants and officials are
asked to be 011 hand prior to this time
in order that there will be no delay
in running off the events.
The sprints, distance runs, and hur
dles will be shortened as in former
workouts of the season. These early
season meets are primarily to give the
new men an opportunity to show what
they can do and to remedy defects in
their running. For this reason it is
very important that all athletes who
have signed up compete tomorrow
morning. The first training rule which
was posted some three weeks past will
hold throughout the season, it is to
the effect that only those who have
been excused by the trainer, captain
or coach will be permitted to stay out
of the competition.
Competition will not only include
all the track events but also the five
field events. It is possible that the
entire schedule will conclude with a
half-mile relay race.
