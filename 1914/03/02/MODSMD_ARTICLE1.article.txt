# PRESLEY'S PLAYERS LOSE FIRST GAME TO VARSITY
## TERRY'S MEN SHOW STRENGTH IN FIELDING Weak Hitting Makes Slow Game—Seitz Strikes Out Twelve Cardinal Batsmen. 
### 
Stanford returned a 4 to 1 victory
over Presley's All-Star aggregation on
Saturday. The remarkable pitching of
Seitz for the visitors was responsible
for slow and featureless play until
the Cardinals began to connect with
his delivery in the seventh, and again
in the eighth, when the varsity bats
ment instituted a regular hit fest which
netted three runs. Maple and Hayes
worked in the box for Stanford. Both
varsity twirlers kept the hits few and
scattered and were backed by a high
order of fielding. The sensation of the
afternoon came with Terry's somer
sault catch in the sixth.
Halm started the scoring when he
was allowed a walk in the seventh in
ning. A passed ball put the runner on
second. Workman then lined out the
needed hit, allowing Halm to complete
the circuit. The All Star twirler came
back by retiring the side with two
strikeouts and an infield grounder.
Again in the eighth Cardinal run
ners started a processional of the
bases. Hoever led off with a hit.
Jacks duplicated it, while Hayes sac
rificed. leaving Hoever on third and
Jacks on the second bag. Terry's
bingle advanced everything one cog,
registering Hoever. Elrod's error >t
first completed the havoc, allowing
Noonan to tally from third, while Ter
ry reached home from second for the
fourth and last score of the game.
With Halm on second Seitz again
demonstrated his pitching calibre by
fanning the next two batsmen.
