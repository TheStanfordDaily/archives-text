# "GO TO CHURCH SUNDAY"
## 
### 
"The strength of any University depends on the perpetuation of
traditions —accumulated and perpetuated ideals." As Dr. Peabody so
spoke yesterday in the well-filled Memorial C hurch he may unconsciously
have been witnessing 1 an infant tradition destined to strengthen the sin
ews of this University. The custom of going to church bids fair
become one of our "perpetual ideals."
The Daily Palo Alto office is not a monastery and its inmates are
little imps who exist to peddle misinformation and play weird typograph
ical jokes—ask anybody if we ain't?—so no one of them, though tem
porarily endowed with an editorial typewriter, is in a poston to urge
his fellows to attend church on religious and moral grounds. Especially
is he barred if he believes that a Sunday morning trip to the green and
sunny hills may often bring one closer to the vital spark of all religion
and morality than a dutiful church-going. These words are rather de
signed to be a testimonial to the beauty of the Memorial Church serv
ices. The vast spaces, the quiet and beauty, the music which lifts one
out. of himself, all create an atmosphere from which one goes out re
laxed and invigorated. This atmosphere is a real and not imaginative;
it affects all alike; and he who pretends to be insensible to it is insincere.
We have no patience with such a poser, or with the man who says he
doesn't go to church because he isn't religious. Consistency is a jewel;
but such consistency is a glass diamond. The church, as has been said, is
not a place for saints, but for sinners.
The Memorial Church service is an undergraduate affair. A stu
dent choir makes the music; the Senior Class has voted to support it;
and representatives of the students act as ushers. For this reason your
attendance is called for; and for the added reason that the music is splen
did and that Chaplain Gardner, never weary of well-doing, has arranged
to bring to us the most eloquent of preachers, among whom we are
glad to liave had Dr. Peabody.
