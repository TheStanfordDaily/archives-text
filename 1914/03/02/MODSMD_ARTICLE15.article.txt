### 
Tickets for the Founders' Day ban
quet have been selling rapidly and
those who wish to attend the dinner
are warned to speak for them at once.
No tickets will be sold after Friday
afternoon, as the caterer must be no
tified by that time as to the number
of guests to expect.

All track men have been ordered to
report to Captain P. B. McKee, '14,
tomorrow afternoon at G o'clock al
ter the regular workout. Since this
order was issued on Thursday after
noon numerous suggestions have been
offered as to what it all means and
the general opinion is that something
is going to "drop."
