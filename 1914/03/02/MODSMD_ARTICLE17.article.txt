# 1913 VARSITY RUGGERS RECEIVE FOOTBALL FOBS
## 
### 
Members of Stanford's victorious
Rugby team have been rewarded for
the first time in four years by the
gift of the small gold football fobs
given to players in winning intercol
legiate games. No members of the
last team have won the emblem be
fore.
The little ovals have been received
by Graduate Manager Wilcox and may
be obtained from him at his office.
The fobs are of solid gold and in
the shape of a miniature football.
Engraved on each is the player's
name, his position and the score â€”
Stanford 13, California 8.
