# SOPHOMORES ARE VICTORS IN UNDERCLASS DEBATE
## CONTROL OF NATIONAL BUDGET IS MOOTED TOPIC. Recently Established Precedent Is Broken by Winning of Close Decision by 1916 Trio. 
### 
By winning the annual underclass
debate last Friday evening in the
chapel the Sophomore trio broke the
triple string of victories of Freshman
classes. The contest throughout was
close. The judges after some discus
sion awarded a two to one decision in
favor of 191 G.
The question for debate was "Re
solved, That the executive department
should be made responsible for our
national budget." The Sophomore de
bating team, composed of J. W. Kauf
man, H. M. Winans, and J. F. Elden,
supported the negative. They main
tained their position by excellent refu
tation of their opponents' argument,
and by the offering of committees as
a substitute for the executive depart
ment to be responsible for the nation's
budget. The Freshmen trio consisted
of R. L. Mott, W. L. Miller, and P. L.
Williams.
Those who acted as judges were
Assistant Professor D. F. Grass of the
Department of Economics, E. E. Tin
cher, '12, and P. D. Nowell, '13, former
intercollegiate debaters. R. J. Miller,
instructor in the English department,
was the presiding officer. A. F. Coyle,
'15, acted as timekeeper.
