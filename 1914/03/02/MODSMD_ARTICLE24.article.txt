# SPECIAL SERVICES ARE HELD FOR MRS. STANFORD
## Dr. Peabody Preaches Sermon on the Ninth Anniversary of Death of Founder. 
### 
In commemoration of the ninth an
niversary of Mrs. Stanford's death
special services were held yesterday.
Choosing for his text the verses from
the Epistle to the Hebrews, "Salute all
them that have the rule over you and
all the saints. Grace be with you all,
amen," Dr. F. G. Peabody gave a strong
sermon.
"The philosophy of history," he said,
"the law of evolution links the present
with the past. In the relation of reci
procity the present looks back to the
past.
"Nowhere, however, is reciprocity
more conspicuous than in a university.
The shifting relationships, the passing
classes, all point in that one direction,
but fundamentally it remains identical.
The eddies of the surface may pass,
but the stream remains the same, and
the foundation grows firmer and more
compelling with increasing years. Ex
ternal changes make the place seem
different, but it is not so at heart, for
the spiritual reciprocity of an aca
demic institution is very marked.
"The strength of any university de
pends on the perpetuation of traditions
â€”accumulated and perpetuated ideals.
This creates an atmosphere of ideal
ism, it strengthens and steadies the
ideas of life. A university is the
home of idealism. The material ad
vantages hold an important place, but
often in the end there is nothing left
but tradition.
"Yesterday was the ninth anniver
sary of the death of Mrs. Stanford.
Her career and the trials which she
encountered may appeal even to a
stranger, though I shall not venture to
go into detail. This church, the center
of her affection, is a most impressive
manifestation of the character of this
remarkable woman. Her life is one of
the most distinguished instances in
American history of parental affection
and charity which believed all things,
hoped all things and never failed. But
the more appealing and dramatic fig
ure is that of the boy of sixteen dying
and giving his name to this university.
Here we see represented the life of a
little child and the love of his par
ents. It goes deeper than the surface,
for the full chord was sounded in the
boy's life and in the parents' love. In
ancient times it was the highest privi
lege for the children to reverence the
parents, but here we see manifest the
reverence of the parents to the mem
ory of a child whose life had scarce
begun to be.
"The university without tradition is
like the body without the soul. Here
the Memorial Church, a symbol of spir
itual devotion, an act of love, trans
mits its love to us across the years.
Mrs. Stanford was the head and hand
of the university. The fulfillment of
her ideals is the greatest aspect in the
fulness of tradition. In the name of
her son she adopted the sons and
daughters of California.
"This service of commemoration,
therefore, becomes a service of conse
cration. The momentum with which the
university began should carry us far.
For in the spirit of love twenty-threo
years ago it was founded with sacred
hope waiting with parental expectancy
for us."
A solo, "I Know That Mv Redeemer
Liveth," was beautifully rendered by
Mrs. L. W .Ely. The choir sang "To
Thee, O Lord, I Yield My Spirit," "Out
of Darkness," and "Crossing the Bar."
