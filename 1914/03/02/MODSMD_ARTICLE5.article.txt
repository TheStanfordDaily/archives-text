# CLOSE FINISHES MARK COMPETITION ON OVAL
## PRIME CONDITION IS SHOWN BY TRACK MEN SATURDAY Finish of Nearly All Events Finds the Runners Bunched at the Tape. 
### 
The track men were in their prime
on Saturday morning and consistent
performing among all the competi
tors was the result. No remarkable
times were made in any of the events,
but in most of the races the athletes
were bunched at the finish. This
made competition more interesting to
the spectators than in any previous
meet this season.
With the exception of F. S. Mur
ray, '16, and R. Krohn, '16, no varsi
ty men competed. It was primarily a
meet of novice men. In the pole

at 11 feet 10 inches, while in the mile
run after a game fight for the lead in
the fourth lap F. L. Foster, '13, took
the pole from E. N. Wright, '16, and
