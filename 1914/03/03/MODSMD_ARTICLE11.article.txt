# HAIL, STANFORD, HAIL!
## 
### 
After listening to the eloquent address of the dynamic George
Sherwood Eddy and observing the general decorous behavior at the
assembly this morning, a subject for fault-finding is seen with difficulty.
One fact, however, is painfully evidenced by each succeeding assembly.
We do not sing "Hail, Stanford, Hail!" as it was intended to be sung
or as it should be sung to make it an inspiring expression of University
loyalty. Moreover, we resist all attempts, whether by the organist, the
Glee Club, the yell leaders, or outsiders, to make us sing it correctlv.
Absolutely distinctive and beautiful in words and music, this song is
priceless to Stanford. The members of the Glee Club, singing it on
their Christmas trip as its author and composer meant it should be sung,
found that with each repetition they took a new delight in rendering it
and saw in it a new meaning.
What can we do about it? Would it not be possible to have the
Glee Club sing the song for us frequently at assemblies and other gath
erings, then to repeat it ourselves with the Glee Club and organ leading?
After a few lessons of this sort the musically talented in each group of
men and women would acquire the approved style of rendering the song
and could teach it to their fellows. Then we would have a hymn of joy
and not a mournful, even though beautiful, dirge of sorrow.
