Editor, The Daily Palo Alto:
Dear Sir: In those piping clays of
purity, the self conscious men anil
maidens arc adapting the intensive
style of queening to a much greater
extent than of yore (so we are told).
However it may be, the college public
is decidedly losing that spirit of bon
homie usually observed in small com
munities. The more pretentious fra
ternity and sorority interests are, the
greater is the segregation; or the dif
ferent troubles may have developed
this clicqueishness. "Too much mus
tard" may have a great deal to do with
it. There are perhaps too many who
are afraid to make asses of themselves
for the good of the community, these
same being the greatest asses of them
all.
All this being true, it is with joy
that we hear of the resolution of the
women to pass through the Quad on
the way home from the Founders' Day
banquet. The custom was formerly to
carry out this program after all genial
meetings. Twelve and ten-thirty
o'clock house rules and other more
or less parental restrictions have
cramped the life on the Farm. Al
though usually old customs cannot be
satisfactorily "revived" without a re
version to former conditions, here's
how to the ladies and here's asking,
"May we come too?"
A MERE MAN.
