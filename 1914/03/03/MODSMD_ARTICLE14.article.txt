# HOW ABOUT JOLLY-UP? ASK TRANSFERS; FROSH REPLY, "O.K., GIRLS"
## 
### 
The question discussed in the cor
respondence below is one which has of
ten fluttered feminine hearts and
aroused ire in masculine bosoms. The
letters are therefore printed in full.
To the Freshman Jolly-up Commit
tee, —
May we trespass on your patience
to ask an impertinent question, or
rather to place an impertinent request?
We have heard it noised around, that
the "transfers," being strangers in a
new land, as well as the much ma
ligned Frosh are allowed to go to the
latters' jolly-up. Do we qualify suffi
ciently to buy in? If so kindly put a
little note in The Daily Palo Alto.
There are only a few of us, and we
are not such a bad lot either. Besides
many of the girls are "transfers" and
not such poor candidates for a "jolly"
evening "up or down." Of course we
feel as little acquainted as some of
the seventeeners, but hope you won't
feel so virtuously superior as to deny
us this little favor. Anyway, "girls
and money" are what you desire. Ain't
it? We'll gladly drop our little mite in
the collection box for the evening's
entertainment. Of course, we believe
in letting "every gent kill his own
snakes," but thought this might ap
peal to you as a solution of the "girl
and money" problem. There is no law
against it,(and, really, we hear pre
cedent for it) so please invite us. We
feel more like Freshmen than any
thing else. This note may be the
"sublimation of the unexpected" to
you, but we hope your "theology" will
tolerate these views. Hoping to see
the glad tidings in a future Daily Palo
Alto, we remain, as ever, your "sober
and sociable" friends,
(Signed), "The Transfers."
To our "sober and sociable" transfer
sisters, —
In answer to your request, self
styled "impertinent," we wish to say
that we are strangers all in this new
land; our cause is common; and the
adversities of the newcomer weigh
but "superiority" we cannot claim.
You say "Girls and money are what
you desire. Ain't it?" Agreed. Wel
come, girls! Thrice welcome!
Signed,
Freshman Jolly-up Comimttee.
