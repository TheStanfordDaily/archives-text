# NOTED MAN IS PORTRYED IN FEBRUARY "ALUMNUS"
## 
### 
The February "Alumnus" which is
now out, contains a picture of
Dr. John Adams Colliver, '90, and an
account of his highly important work
in connection with children's courts
and the reformation of incorrigible
children. The "Alumnus" also deals
with the coming Founders' Day cele
bration and with the movement which
has been taken up by the Alumni Asso
ciation looking towards a big reunion
on the campus in 1915.
