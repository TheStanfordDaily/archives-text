day that a picture of the Seniors and
Holdovers was to be taken today at
1:10. The picture-taking was in fact
confined to the Civil Engineering Sen
iors and Holdovers alone. The Senior
picture will he taken 011 the morning
of Founders' Day, when the class is
gathered in a body and preliminary to
marching to the Assembly Hail. A
site has been chosen which will give
as a background to the members of the
class a panorama showing much of the
front of the Quad.
