Fritz Kreisler, violinist, playing last
evening under the auspices of the fac
ulty committee of public entertain- ;
ments, received perhaps the most en- i
thusiastic ovation ever accorded to |
any artist by a Stanford audience.
Mr. Kreisler's playing displayed al
most incredible technical attainments
and the fullest insight into the spirit
and depth of bis selections. His
hearers were completely won by his
masterful sanity and sincerity of in
terpretation.
Handel's Sonata in D major opened j
the program, and was followed by the
Bach Adagio and Fugue in C minor, j
Under Kreisler's fingers the violin
gave forth the rich tones of a many
stringed instrument. Mendelssohn's
Concerto in E minor was understand- |
ingly rendered by the master, and j
though the absence of the orchestra
background was felt at times, Mr.
Lamson's sympathetic piano accompa
niment was remarkably satisfactory.
The sparkling group of short num
bers following was warmly received.
Mr. Kreisler repeated Couperin's "La
Precieuse" and gave "La Chasse" by
Cartier as an encore to the brilliant
Tartini Fugue. The audience demand
ed a repetition of the favorite "Ca
price Viennois," of which the violin'st
himself was the composer, ihe pro-|
gram was completed by Paganini's
"Three Caprices," but the hall was not |
vacated until the artist had rendered j
Schubert's dainty "Moment Musical"
and the ever-welcome "Humoresque."
In addition to the unbounded thanks
of the large audience the faculty com
mittee on entertainment was reward
ed by the financial succes.
