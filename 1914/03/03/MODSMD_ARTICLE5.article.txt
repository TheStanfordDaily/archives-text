# PROFESSOR MARTIN IS HONORED BY HISTORIANS
## 
### 
Word has been received here of the
election of Professor P. A. Martin
of the History Department, to mem
bership in the Societe D' liistoire de
L'Amerique Latin. Professor Martin
is one of the very few Americans who
have been thus honored. His mem
bership in this society will accrue to
the direct advantage of Stanford Uni
versity in that it places him in direct
contact with the leading historians
of Europe who make a specialty of
Latin America.
