# NEW CULTURE IN ORIENT IS LECTURER'S THEME
## CHRISTIAN WORKER FROM ASIA SPEAKS AT ASSEMBLY. Sherwood Eddy Points Out Growth of New Culture in Interesting Way. 
### 
An address on the awakening of
! western culture in Asia by George
Sherwood Eddy, traveler, student, and
teacher among the peoples of the Ori
ent, held the interest of a general as
sembly this morning. His arguments
were illustrated with bits of personal
narrative which added live interest.
The speaker pictured the wave of
intellectual, political, industrial, relig
ious, and moral progress which has
swept over India, China, and Japan.
| Though the renaissance was shown to
I apply to all three of the great eastern
countries, the wonderful strides made
by China served as the prime exam
l pie.
After being introduced by Vice Pres
ident Stillman, Mr. Eddy spoke in part
as follows:
"Since ancient times the conditions
of civilization are reversed. The caU
now comes from the needy East to the
opulent West. We are today facing a
great awakening in Asia, which is out
doing in intensity that which swept
Europe five centuries ago.
"Indian, Japanese, and Chinese stu
dents are returning with western cul
ture, to found schools in their home
lands. The search tor the new learn
ing in the East is far greater than that
which existed in Europe during the re
vival of learning.
"There is also a great economic and
industrial awakening in progress in
the East. Trade with India, China,
the Philippines, and Japan is rapidly
increasing. China is developing great,
industries. Her own steel mills are
turning out steel rails, for China will
build more railroads during the twen
tieth century than any other country.
"With America China's nearest
neighbor, why should we let any other
country lead in that great opening of
trade? I believe that the republic in
China has come to stay, and that the
nation which has seen the rise of ev
ery other nation is rising strong with
a great future before her.
"Right through the East there has
been evidence of a great political, so
cial, and religious awakening. A new
day is dawning. A sense of social re
sponsibility is spreading among the
students of India, China, and Japan.
"In that great continent of Asia we
face the cradle of civilization, the
birthplace of western culture, and the
mother of all the learning of the
world."
