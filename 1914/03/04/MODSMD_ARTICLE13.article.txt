# GENTLEMEN, YOUR VERDICT

### 
"One of the Suspected," "An Alumnus," "An Outsider," "A Stu
dent," and "Also a Student" have aired their views on the Honor Sys
tem in fair-minded and temperate fashion. Society debates and informal
discussion are aiding to crystallize sentiment. It was with the hope of
arousing such thorough discussion that the subject was first opened;
and opinions contra are as welcome as those pro. Nothing is so little
desired by the friends of the plan as to see it adopted without the well
considered and enthusiastic support of the great majority of the stu
dents. So to install it would mean disaster.
If the majority sentiment is strongly for the system, however, its
advocates still believe that its adoption would result not only in success
but in brilliant success. True, expected criticism has met the argument
that the element of contest introduced by faculty supervision of exam
inations conduces to cheating. Those who advance this contention
realize that it is open to objection on theoretical grounds, and that it
does not savor so strongly of lofty ethics as may be wished in a con
sideration of an ethical subject. We are not defending the human
weakness manifested by those who are tempted to use underhand meth
ods by this concentration of attention on the danger of getting caught
at cheating rather than on the dishonor of cheating itself. We simply
present the indisputable fact that this is an important cause of dishonesty.
The case for the Honor System rests upon the logical conclusion
to be drawn from the statements of fact which follow: (i) In the de
partments at Stanford which have not the Honor System cheating is
present in an unpleasant degree. (2) In the Law department, which
has the system, and in those portions of the Engineering departments
which have it, cheating has been reduced to a minimum. (3) A study
of the Honor System in 125 colleges, printed today, shows tint in eight
institutions the system has not been violated since installation, while
the majority report but from one to four cases a year.
