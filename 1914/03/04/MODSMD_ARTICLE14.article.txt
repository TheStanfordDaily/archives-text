Editor Daily Palo Alto,
Dear Sir:
Tn spite of editorials and tlie reso
lution of the Senior Class it is sur
prising to learn that there are Seniors
and other undergraduates who have
entirely lost sight of the significance
of the Founders' Day exercises in the
Assembly Hall on Monday morning.
This is the one great day of the
year which is set apart to do honor
to tlie great-hearted man and the in
domitable woman who made this
University possible. It is a privilege
to meet for such a purpose. After
graduation the Alumni are wide-scat
tered, but their sense of obligation
increases until there are thousands
who would be glad to come back «.o
the Farm and unite in such a service
of honor and deep-felt esteem. But
the men and women who are now liv
ing on the Campus and who are en
joying all these good things should
allow no indifference or thoughtless
ness to rob them of a privilege which
will soon be beyond their reach.
