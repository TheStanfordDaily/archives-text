# EXCUSING DISHONESTY?

Dear Sir:
Much as I would like to hymn with
the chorus in praise of the honor sys
tem, I cannot bring myself into har
mony with their song. They probably
mean well. Indeed, I'm sure they do,
and so far they have not greatly in
jured the cause they advocate. But
for the future let Heaven protect this
poor waif of a system from its friends.
Let's see .iust how these friontfs
make out their case. We hear them
choiring in unison, "Faculty supervi
sion increases cheating." Why? For
sooth, because "it's an excuse for
cheating." Now if it is true that su
pervision constitutes a challenge 10,
and an excuse for cheating, by all
means let's rid ourselves of this
challenge. And at the same time let's
sew up every sort of legal supervision
in a single sack and throw the whole
business overboard at once. Police
man and professors go together, and
nothing is loft but a feeling of relief.
