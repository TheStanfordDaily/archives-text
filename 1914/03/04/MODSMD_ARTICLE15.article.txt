# EXCUSING DISHONESTY?

Dear Sir:
Much as I would like to hymn with
the chorus in praise of the honor sys
tem, I cannot bring myself into har
mony with their song. They probably
mean well. Indeed, I'm sure they do,
and so far they have not greatly in
jured the cause they advocate. But
for the future let Heaven protect this
poor waif of a system from its friends.
Let's see .iust how these friontfs
make out their case. We hear them
choiring in unison, "Faculty supervi
sion increases cheating." Why? For
sooth, because "it's an excuse for
cheating." Now if it is true that su
pervision constitutes a challenge 10,
and an excuse for cheating, by all
means let's rid ourselves of this
challenge. And at the same time let's
sew up every sort of legal supervision
in a single sack and throw the whole
business overboard at once. Police
man and professors go together, and
nothing is loft but a feeling of relief.
For are we not now rid of all excuse
for dishonor, and so of dishonor's
self?
Sorrowfully, no! Dishonor is still
"among our midst," not to lie long
concealed either, but to come quickly
forth in a brand new whitewash of
excuses. Even in fresh raiment it
looks quite as ugly as before, and
really it seems that no amount of
the odor of sanctity can altogether
hide the smell of brimstone. The fact
of the matter is that neither supervi
sion, nor any other temptation, will
serve as an excuse for dishonesty.
Blaming systems for the weakness
of individuals is bad business â€”for the
individuals. If the abolishment of
faculty supervision will deprive some
of these people of what has been of
fered as an excuse for their dishon
esty, and will bring to them a feeling
of personal responsibility, such as
should be theirs in any case, then the
move will be a wise one. Tf there is
present with us a supposed excuse for
dishonesty, let us get rid of this ex
cuse; not because it is a real excuse,
but because its general acceptance as
such has a deplorable effect upon the
Stanford code of honor.
"ALSO A STUDENT."
