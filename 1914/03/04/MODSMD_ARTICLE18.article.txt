The following article by Bird T.
Baldwin of Swarthmore College, en
titled "The Present Status of the Hon
or System in American Colleges and
Universities," and printed in the
Journal of Educational Psychology
for January, 1914, is an abstract of a
paper read before Section L, Ameri
can Association for the Advancement
of Science, at Atlanta, Georgia, Jan
uary 1, 1914. It is printed in full:
This summary gives the status of
the honor system in American col
leges and universities. It is based on
personal replies to twelve questions
from 425 presidents or their repre
sentatives. The results show that
125 institutions, or 29.4 per cent, now
have the honor system; of these 49,
or 32.2 per cent, are situated east of
the Mississippi and south of the Ma
son and Dixon line; 7, or 5.6 per cent,
are in New England; 37, or 19.6 per
cent, are for men only; 10, or 8 per
cent, for women, and 78, or 63.2 per
cent, are co-educational. Of these in
stitutions 97 have the honor system
in all departments, 25 have it in some
departments, and 3 did not reply
to this question. In addition to the
125 institutions included, 43 others
claim to have the system in spirit, but
not in form, and 31 are considering
its adoption in the near future.
Three southern institutions claim
the credit of developing or formulat
ing the system of student direction
and student control in examinations.
A resolution requiring the signing of
a pledge for honor students passed
the faculty of the University of Vir
ginia on a motion of Judge Tucker
in 1542. Chaplain Flinn, in the
chapel of South Carolina College, in
1805, referred to an informal reliance
on honor. President Tyler vigorously
claims it was in vogue informally in
William and Mary College in 1779.
The Virginia resolution is undoubted
ly authentic and definitely fixes the
date for the formal adoption of the
organized system as a system. Our
data shows that in 53 institutions a
formal honor system was the result
of the initiative of the students, and
in 45 of the initiative from the fac
ulty. There are five institutions that
have given up the practice, but the
others find it holding its own and
growing in favor. An authority from
Princeton says:"I do not know any
thing in the history of the University
which has had more extensive or
more gratifying results, or which has

been less open to criticism in its op
eration.
It is interesting to note that of the
85 institutions requiring a pledge 30
require the double obligation to re
port on other students. In scope the
different pledges include examina
tions, written reports, reserve books
in the library, conduct, recitations,
paying debts, stealing, sub-rosa frat
ernities, and in one institution gam
bling, drunkenness, or drinking in
public places. The administrative
councils are usually composed of stu
dents and in 20 institutions these
councils have final jurisdiction. In
only 2(5 institutions is the instructor
required to be present during the ex
amination, while in others he is re
quired not to be present or it is op
tional with him. In 8 institutions
I here has been no violation since in
stallation, and the others, with few
exceptions, report from 1 to 4 casss
per year.
The code of collegiate honor in
American colleges and universities is
superior to that generally accredited.

The following article by Bird T.
Baldwin of Swarthmore College, en
titled "The Present Status of the Hon
or System in American Colleges and
Universities," and printed in the
Journal of Educational Psychology
for January, 1914, is an abstract of a
paper read before Section L, Ameri
can Association for the Advancement
of Science, at Atlanta, Georgia, Jan
uary 1, 1914. It is printed in full:
This summary gives the status of
the honor system in American col
leges and universities. It is based on
personal replies to twelve questions
from 425 presidents or their repre
sentatives. The results show that
125 institutions, or 29.4 per cent, now
have the honor system; of these 49,
or 32.2 per cent, are situated east of
the Mississippi and south of the Ma
son and Dixon line; 7, or 5.6 per cent,
are in New England; 37, or 19.6 per
cent, are for men only; 10, or 8 per
cent, for women, and 78, or 63.2 per
cent, are co-educational. Of these in
stitutions 97 have the honor system
in all departments, 25 have it in some
departments, and 3 did not reply
to this question. In addition to the
125 institutions included, 43 others
claim to have the system in spirit, but
not in form, and 31 are considering
its adoption in the near future.
Three southern institutions claim
the credit of developing or formulat
ing the system of student direction
and student control in examinations.
A resolution requiring the signing of
a pledge for honor students passed
the faculty of the University of Vir
ginia on a motion of Judge Tucker
in 1542. Chaplain Flinn, in the
chapel of South Carolina College, in
1805, referred to an informal reliance
on honor. President Tyler vigorously
claims it was in vogue informally in
William and Mary College in 1779.
The Virginia resolution is undoubted
ly authentic and definitely fixes the
date for the formal adoption of the
organized system as a system. Our
data shows that in 53 institutions a
formal honor system was the result
of the initiative of the students, and
in 45 of the initiative from the fac
ulty. There are five institutions that
have given up the practice, but the
others find it holding its own and
growing in favor. An authority from
Princeton says:"I do not know any
thing in the history of the University
which has had more extensive or
more gratifying results, or which has

been less open to criticism in its op
eration.
It is interesting to note that of the
85 institutions requiring a pledge 30
require the double obligation to re
port on other students. In scope the
different pledges include examina
tions, written reports, reserve books
in the library, conduct, recitations,
paying debts, stealing, sub-rosa frat
ernities, and in one institution gam
bling, drunkenness, or drinking in
public places. The administrative
councils are usually composed of stu
dents and in 20 institutions these
councils have final jurisdiction. In
