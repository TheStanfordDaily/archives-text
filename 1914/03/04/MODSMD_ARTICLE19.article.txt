# HISTORIC POWER MODELS ARE GIVEN TO STANFORD
## Material Illustrates Art and Construction of Impulse Water Wheel Design and Construction. 
### 
The department of Mechanical En
gineering has recently received
from Mr. E. W. Eckart of San
Francisco, father of Professor W.
R. Eckart, Jr., of the University, a
valuable collection of material illus
trating the art and advancement of im
pulse water wheel design and con
struction. This material extends over
the past thirty years to the early min
ing days in California when the
"Ilurdy Curdy" wheel was the only
one in use.
Among the various forms of buckets
are some as first made by L. A. Pel
ton in ISSO, also buckets with nozzles
and testing device as used by Cha
vanne in ISBS and ISSfi, with needle
nozzles used in Nevada in 18S8.
Mr. Eckart was closely identified
with these developments, and is him
self the inventor of important im
provements in this field of engineer
ing work. The Pacific Coast is pe
culiarly the home of this type of hy
draulic power equipment, and Stan
ford University is fortunate in being
able to obtain through the generosity
of the donor this interesting and im
portant collection of historical ma
terial.
