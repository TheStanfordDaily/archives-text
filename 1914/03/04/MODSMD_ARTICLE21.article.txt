Members of the Stanford Art Club
met Wednesday afternoon in the Art
building and decided then to take
a full page in the 1915 Quad to tell
of the activities of the society as was
done in the last annual.
A committee composed of M. A.
Oliver, '15, chairman; E. Schnell, '11,
Miss Edna Lewis, '15, and Miss Mil
dred C'arr, '14, was appointed to
look into the matter of securing pins
for the club.
It was urgently requested that all
Art Club members see Treasurer M.
A. Oliver at once about settling up for
this semester's dues.
