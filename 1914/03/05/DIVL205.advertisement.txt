America is the land of self
made men. It is characteristic
j of Americans to rely on their own efforts —to
! do things for themselves. The millions of "Bull" hi
1 Durham smokers are of this energetic, self-reliant, S
American type in all walks of life. These men : i
like to make their own cigarettes, to their liking,
from ripe, mellow, "Bull" Durham tobacco—
prefer these cigarettes, made by their own hands,
to any ready-made kind they can buy.
