# TICKET SALE FOR DINNER WILL CLOSE TOMORROW
## COMMITTEE ANNOUNCES THAT “EENING” IS IN ORDER Crew Training Table Dispensed With in Honor of founders’ Day Information Affair 
### 
Tomorrow will be absolutely the
last clay that tickets may be pur
chased for the Founders' Day Dinner,
which will he held in Encina Hall,
Monday evening, March !). The com
mittee in charge of the dinner reports
that many students have not yet pur
chased tickets.
A member of the committee in
speaking of the situation said, "This
lack of interest on the part of the un
dergraduates is difficult to account
for. Evidently many students fail to
appreciate the significance of a gen
eral university gathering for mutual
congratulation on the founding and
progress of Stanford. Those in charge
of the affair have felt that if the din
ner were successfully carried out this
year, a precedent would be estab
lished which would increase in im
portance in future years. This is of
interest to the Seniors. Many stu
dents seem to be still under the mis
apprehension that this dinner, in spite
of all that has been said of its infor
mality, is to be like the usual banquet
—a solemn occasion, with the people
uncomfortably seated at long tables,
listening politely to lengthy addresses.
As a matter of fact, President Bran
ner is the only one who has been
urged to talk at any length."
The tables have been arranged in
order that groups may sit together
and the committee hopes that all who
attend the dinner will do so with the
idea of enjoying themselves in their
own way. It is announced that
"queening" is decidedly in order for
those who wish to indulge, and that
an informal dance will probably be
held following the dinner.
