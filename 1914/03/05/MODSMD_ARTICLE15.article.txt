# Stanford’s Most Notable Athletes
## 
### 
Art Bumiller, ",)7.
Experienced professional players,
amateurs, fans, used to agree in this:
"Kid Bumiller's the greatest kid ball
player that ever lived."
He lirst attracted general attention
as a little boy, a very little boy, not
yet in his teens, in those days he
used to catch a big pitcher who
weighed 190 pounds. And that was
long before the pitcher's box was
moved back to sixty feet from the fifty
foot range. He was so little and light
that he used to put a large slab of
sheet lead in his mitt to brace him for
receiving cannon-ball delivery.
He entered Stanford in 1893 as a
freshman with the class of '97.
Arthur W. Bumiller, of Los Angeles,
had a reputation as a freshman.
Little, quiet, popular, and the best
dressed man in his class, lie was
swept into office as the first president
of '97.
He was the recognized tennis cham
pion of southern California, the pool
champion of southern California, and
a baseball marvel. So they said.
They spoke advisedly. He was all
that.
He became pool and billiard cham
pion of Stanford as a freshman. He
was varsity tennis champion and
Stanford's representative in both
singles and doubles that one year he
was in college. He played two varsity
games against California as a fresh
man, scoring two runs, three hits, and
six stolen bases, and for one of these
two games he went directly from the
intercollegiate tennis match without
luncheon to his place at second base.
But wait a moment. Get this: Art
Bumiller was only 5 feet 6 inches
tall, and he never weighed more than
130 pounds. Well, what of it?

This: Art Bumiller, '97, is the
greatest second baseman Stanford has
ever had, —bar none, —and the third
best varsity catcher that has back
stopped for the Cardinal. He covered
his territory with ease and that little
natty touch that seemed almost like
doing baseball tricks. And he could
bat and get around the bases too.
| During Stanford's famous northern
conquest in 1894 he caught McLaine,
i Campbell, and Weldon, all having un
usual speed. McLaine still stands as
Stanford's one great pitcher.
You who know Los Angeles may re
call the Bumiller Block. That is one
of the Bumiller properties. Art him
self is in the electric suburban express
business.
I think I have never known a more
likeable Stanford personality than Art
Bumiller's.
He was a Phi Gamma Delta and later
a Sigma Rho Eta, the local society
that evolved into Delta Kappa Epsilon.
