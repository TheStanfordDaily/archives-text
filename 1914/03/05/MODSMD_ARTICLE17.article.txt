Editor, The Daily Palo Alto.
Dear Sir:
The Daily Palo Alto has opened it3
columns to the University public for
the purpose of having a free discus
sion of the honor system.
We have had to spend considerable
time aud thought in trying to ligure
out what some of the communicators
are trying to bring out.
Some of us are convinced that the
columns could be devoted to better
purposes than giving space to some
of the communications.
It seems that all of us know what
the system is. Let us have an as
sembly and decide whether or not we
are willing, as a unified body, to sup
port this system.
If the Stanford Student Body gives
its word that it will see a thing
through, the faculty is 110 doubt will
ing to leave it to us.
Why not take up this thing and
make it go, and not spend so much
time talking about it?
ALUMNUS.
