# “OUR DOUBTS” IS THEME OF EDDY’S SECOND TALK
## Noted Traveller Speaks on Serious Problems of Every Man’s Life. 
### 
"Our Doubts, and Mow to Deal With
Them," was the subject of George
Sherwood Eddy's second address to
Stanford men, in the Assembly ilall
last evening*.
"Doubt," lie said, "is a doorway
leading out to the open sunshine of a
larger and surer faith, ft is health
ful and normal in man, who craves
assurance in religion as well as in
science. Just as in science we test
nature's reliability by the fivefold
method of observation, hypothesis, ex
periment, correction and verification,
so may we apply this inductive meth
od to religion. Faith is a scientific
venture in action, by which a man
tries to transfer a reasonable proba
bility into a certainty of his own ex
perience. In religion also the test is
by a fivefold method. We know that
we exist, that there is a difference be
tween right and wrong, that there are
imperative reasons for doing right,
that thousands of men have found
God by doing right, and that we
should follow our consciences and
test the hypothesis of God to prove
that it is true. Tf a man will do, he
shall know, but if he will not do, be
shall not know. Obedience is the con
dition of knowledge. The Bible will
bear a test just as well as a scien
tific text book, for though there may
be technical flaws in it, the great lov
ing message it carries will withstand
any trial. Doubt may spring from
misunderstanding, neglect, or what
ever source, but at the root of all
doubt may be found the seed of sin."
The lecture was preceded by the
rendition of two selections by the Y.
M. C. A. quartet.
The subject of this evening's talk
will be "The Greatest Question Be
fore the Modern Mind."
