basketball team will clash with Cali
fornia in the first game of tiie series
for intercollegiate supremacy. Stan
ford will have an opportunity to
avenge its defeat of last year at the

California team, which won two suc

contest. The local quintet has met
with only one setback this year, a 34

departments of the game, winning
most of its contests with comparative
ease . The team is composed prac
tically of veterans from last year's
five.
