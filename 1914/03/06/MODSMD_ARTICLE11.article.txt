# HAVE A THOUGHT ON IT

### 
To attend all the exercises on Founders' Day is for every Stanford
man and woman at once a duty, a privilege, and a pleasure. If this
truism is not by this time fully realized it is a knockout blow to our
esteem both for the value of publicity and for the powers of perception
of the people of the campus. The whole argument works out in this
way: We owe a duty to the founders of this University to join together
to give ourselves a good time and thus eloquently express the fact that
our memory of Senator and ]\1 rs. Stanford is still green and that our
gratitude to them is no whit lowered in degree. There is this year an
added reason for realizing this duty to participate in the events of the
day. For the first time, the undergraduates by official action of their
various organizations have made themselves responsible for the success
of Founders' Day. It has never been a charactistic of this student body
to enjoy falling down on the job.
Because classes are suspended on Monday does not mean that the
day has been set apart for a general exodus from the campus. It is
sincerely hoped that none will be so selfish as to look at the matter in
this light. May a visitor in the Assembly Hall Monday morning and
at the banquet in the evening find every one of us there, and there in
every sense of the word. If any of us do stay away, may we have the
decency to be ashamed of it and to stay under cover. And may there
be no ball games on fraternity lawns during the ceremonies of the
day. O, Heaven forbid !
