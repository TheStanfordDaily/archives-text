tomorrow for the intercollegiate soc
cer championship in the final game of
the series. The game promises to be
close, with odds favoring the Cardinal,
which won a close victory of 1-0 in
the first game of the series, played on
November 8. The second game of the
series, played on Thanksgiving Day,
resulted in a 1-1 score. If California
wins tomorrow's game a replay will
be necessary.
