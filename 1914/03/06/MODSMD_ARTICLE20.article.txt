# SHERWOOD EDDY DELIVERS LAST MESSAGE TO MEN
## Takes "The Greatest Question Before the Modern Mind" for Subject 
### 
George Sherwood Eddy delivered
his last message to the men of Stan
ford in the Assembly Hall last even
ing, taking as his theme "The Ques
tion Before the Modern Mind."
He said, "There are many questions
before the modern mind, but most of
them do not touch the very center of
our lives. The problems of science,
business and philosophy are not of
the greatest importance to us. Rus
kin's three questions, 'Whence came
I, why am I here, and whither am I
going?' have a more personal touch,
and still more vital is the question
asked by Jesus, 'Whom say ye that. 1
am?' and his own answer, 'I am the
way, the truth and the life.'
"Still there is a deeper question,
not addressed merely to the mind, but
groping under the very will of man.
If we admit that Jesus is the way, the
truth and the life, what shall we do
with him? To follow the way, is the
first natural course; second, be a
learner of the truth and a disciple of
Jesus; and third, receive him and bis
life. Spiritual life is the correspon
dence to the environment of the soul,
to know God and Jesus Christ.
"No matter with what doubts we
start, we can break from the evil past
and get right with ourselves, our fel
lowmen and with God, by becoming
honest investigators of Christianity
and Jesus Christ."
The Y. M. C. A. quartet sang two
selections before the lecture.
