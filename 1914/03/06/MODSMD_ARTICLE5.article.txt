## FORTUNE HUNTER SEEKS GOLD ON QUAD Cast to Hold Three Dress Rehearsals Next Week.â€”Village Characters Demand Laughs. 
### 
Sale of tickets for the Sophomore
comedy, "The Fortune Hunter," will
be held at the Bookstore and at Wein
gartner's in Palo Alto Tuesday after
noon at 1:10. The reputation of the
J play as a laugh-provoking assortment
of fun, and as a lesson in high finance
has been firmly established. As a
drawing card, the coming "marry
wisely and get rich" classic of Win
cliell Smith's has had few equals
among the latter-day comedies.
Some members of "The Fortune
Hunter" cast introduced the title
character of the play to the campus
this morning in a wild search for
wealth by the pick and shovel meth
od. The wealth seeker is going to
hit on a less strenuous means of gain
ing riches during the performance
next Saturday evening at the Assem
bly Hall.
Rehearsals of the comedy in full
costume and with the stage complete
ly set will be held Monday, Tuesday,
and Wednesday of next week. At
each trial performance the entire
course of action will be gone through.
Since the beginning of the semester
the cast of "The Fortune Hunter" has
been held to steady work in prepai i
tion of the comedy by Coach W. F.
Mathieu. Besides training the cast 'is
a whole in the task of presenting the
story of the play properly, he has de
voted a great deal of time to coaching
individuals in character work.
In "The Fortune Hunter" the author
presents the diversified typos of a re
motely rural community which have
long been a source of amusement on
the stage. All the people who go to
make up a back country village are
shown, from the constable to the
bank owner. The types are not bur
lesqued, but are pictured in such a
way that the value of realness is add
ed to that of humor.
