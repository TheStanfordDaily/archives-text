# VARSITY WILL PLAY OFF CAMPUS FOR FIRST TIME
## STANFORD MEETS MISSION NINE AT SANTA CLARA College Alumni Team and Presley's All-Stars Will Be Attraction on Local Diamond. 
### 
Two baseball games are on the
boards for Saturday. While the Col
lege Alumni team makes its first ap
pearance on the campus playing
against Presley's All-Stars, Captain
Terry will lead the Varsity in a re
turn contest with the Missionites on
the Santa Clara diamond.
Twelve members of the Varsity
squad will be taken for the off-campus
engagement. Maple and Hayes will
be on the firing line, while Dent and
Landers will be on the receiving end.
Workman, Stafford, McCloskey, Terry,
Halm, Day, and Noonan will occupy
their regular positions. Advisory
Coach Moskiman and substitute play
ers will accompany the team.
Stanford fans will witness two visit
ing nines on the home diamond to
morrow. The result of the Alumni's
play against Presley's men, who lost
a 4 to 0 game to Stanford a week ago,
will forecast the character of the
Founders' Day game, when the South
erners will play the Varsity for the
first time.
Seitz, who won his letter at George
town University, will again serve in
the box for the All-Stars. This speedy
southpaw retired twelve Cardinal
batsmen on his last appearance here.
He will be opposed on the mound by
Marshall or Hunter, former twirlers
at the University of Illinois. Presley
will catch for his team, while O'Con
ner, of the University of Southern
California, is slated as the backstop
for the College Alumni nine.
