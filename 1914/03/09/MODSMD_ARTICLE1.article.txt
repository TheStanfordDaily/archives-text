Exercises in commemoration of the
birth of Leland Stanford, and the
death of Jane Lathrop Stanford, the
founders of the University were held
in the Assembly Hall this morning.
The program observed the traditions
which have grown to regulate the an
nual memorial tribute, combining a
spirit of reverence to the parents of
the institution, with joy in the
achievements of Stanford in the past,
and bright hopes for the future.
A throng of alumni, faculty mem
bers, and undergraduates filled the
lower tloor and balcony of the audi
torium to take part in the services.
From the time the men and women
of the Senior class entered the hall
in double column and took the seats
reserved in front, until the strains of
Losey's "Gloria" were played by the
band as the closing march, a feeling
of reverence settled over the assem-
Mage. The order of the program was
simple and impressive, and was an
expression of the sincerity which is
called characteristic of Stanford
spirit.
The address of the morning, deliv
ered by Judge William W. Morrow,
concerned "The Founders of the Uni
versity," and took the form of a his
torical narrative of Senator Staf
ford's public life. In that it presented
a picture of Leland Stanford in a
more intimate, and more complete
way than any speaker has probably
done before, the faculty committee on
addresses deserves particular credit.
The musical program was well
chosen, and rendered in a pleasing
fashion. In addition to five selections
by the Stanford band, a chorus of
one hundred voices sang Gounod's
"Praise Ye the Father," accompanied
by the band.
After leaving the Assembly Hall,
the members of the Senior class
marched to the Mausoleum to do
honor before the tomb of the Foun
ders, the women wearing caps and
gowns. The flower committee, con
sisting of Miss Betty Funston and
F. J. Gard, placed flowers inside the
Mausoleum. After singing the Stan
ford hymn, the Seniors disbanded.
This evening the Banquet will be
held at Encina Hall at six-thirty.
The tickets sold already number well
over four hundred. Further applica
tions will be met as far as possible.
A. G. Halm, '14, will lie the first
speaker, introducing the toastmaster,
President Branner. L. D. Summer
field. '12, president of the University
Conference, will speak for the Stu
dents of the University. Melville
Best. Anderson, Emeritus Professor of
English Literature, will represent the
Faculty; O. M. Bradley, '01. will
speak for the Alumni; W. M. New
hall will represent the Trustees.
