# MONMANZ IS WITNESS TO PAST RACE TRACK FAME
## Spirited Stallion Is Sole Survivor of Stanford Horses Which Made Santa Clara Famous. 
### 
A spirited stallion, Monmanz, sired
by Monbells out of Manzanita, and
driven about tlie campus occasionally
by Superintendent J. E. Hewston is
today the last witness of the world
wide fame once attained by the Stan
ford racing stables. The average
Stanford student of today, unless his
attention has been caught by the few
weather-beaten tombstoues which
mark the graves of a dozen or more
famous horses 011 the old stock farm,
does not know that the Santa Clara
valley first gained prominence, not
from sugar prunes, but from race
horses.
It was in 1876 that Governor Stan
ford started the racing stables here
011 his farm. In IS7B Fred Crocker,
a two-year-old, negotiated the mile
in 2:25, wihcli marked a new world's
record. From then until the stables
were closed out, a little over ten
years ago, the years were few when
the Stanford stables did not bring
home at least one world's record. In
1891 Stanford horses won nearly ev
ery world's record for trotters. At
the time of Senator Stanford's death
the inventory called for 1,463 horses,
all of them pure bred.
The most famous of the Stanford
horses was Electioneer, probably the
greatest stallion the world has ever
seen. He was the sire of more record
breakers than any other horse in the
world, lie was purchased by Senator
Stanford in the early days for $15,000
from a New York horseman. He was
the sire of Arion, who sold to .J. Mal
colm Forbes of Boston for $125,000, a
price which still stands as a record
for a pure trotter; he also sired Su
-1101, who brought $41,000, and many
more fast horses, worth from $10,000
to $25,000. His skeleton, strung 011
wire, is in the museum now.
Two other famous horses raised
here were Palo Alto, holder of the
world's trotting record at 2:08 3-4,
and Azote, holder of the record at
2:04 3-4. Senator Stanford never
allowed a pacer 011 the place.
George Wood of Palo Alto and O.
H. Reynolds, watchman of the auto
mobile drive near the Faculty Club,
were formerly employed in the Stan
ford stables. Reynolds first came io
the farm in 1878, and his fondest
memories are woven about the re
nown of Electioneer, Monaco, Beauti
ful Belles and others of the famous
Stanford horses. He quit the stables
some time after Senator Stanford's
death. Wood did not leave until 1911,
and remembers when. Monmanz, the
last of the breed to remain 011 the
"farm," was foaled in 1904.

George Wood of Palo Alto and O.
H. Reynolds, watchman of the auto
mobile drive near the Faculty Club,
were formerly employed in the Stan
ford stables. Reynolds first came io
the farm in 1878, and his fondest
memories are woven about the re
nown of Electioneer, Monaco, Beauti
ful Belles and others of the famous
Stanford horses. He quit the stables
some time after Senator Stanford's
death. Wood did not leave until 1911,
and remembers when. Monmanz, the
last of the breed to remain 011 the
"farm," was foaled in 1904.
A spirited stallion, Monmanz, sired
by Monbells out of Manzanita, and
driven about tlie campus occasionally
by Superintendent J. E. Hewston is
today the last witness of the world
wide fame once attained by the Stan
ford racing stables. The average
Stanford student of today, unless his
attention has been caught by the few
weather-beaten tombstoues which
mark the graves of a dozen or more
famous horses 011 the old stock farm,
does not know that the Santa Clara
valley first gained prominence, not
from sugar prunes, but from race
horses.
It was in 1876 that Governor Stan
ford started the racing stables here
011 his farm. In IS7B Fred Crocker,
a two-year-old, negotiated the mile
in 2:25, wihcli marked a new world's
record. From then until the stables
were closed out, a little over ten
years ago, the years were few when
the Stanford stables did not bring
home at least one world's record. In
1891 Stanford horses won nearly ev
ery world's record for trotters. At
the time of Senator Stanford's death
the inventory called for 1,463 horses,
all of them pure bred.
The most famous of the Stanford
horses was Electioneer, probably the
greatest stallion the world has ever
seen. He was the sire of more record
breakers than any other horse in the
world, lie was purchased by Senator
Stanford in the early days for $15,000
from a New York horseman. He was
the sire of Arion, who sold to .J. Mal
colm Forbes of Boston for $125,000, a
price which still stands as a record
for a pure trotter; he also sired Su
-1101, who brought $41,000, and many
more fast horses, worth from $10,000
to $25,000. His skeleton, strung 011
wire, is in the museum now.
Two other famous horses raised
here were Palo Alto, holder of the
world's trotting record at 2:08 3-4,
and Azote, holder of the record at
2:04 3-4. Senator Stanford never
allowed a pacer 011 the place.
