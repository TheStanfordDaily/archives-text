# JUDGE MORROW RECALLS MEMORIES OF FOUNDERS
## INTIMATE TRIBUTE OF FRIEND STIRS ASSEMBLAGE Address Presents Impressions of Le-land Stanford Gathered During Thirty Years 
### 
The Founders' Day address deliv
ered this morning by Judge William
W. Morrow conies from an especially
authentic source, and constitutes the
j most elaborate memorial to Senator
Stanford yet attempted. For this
reason a desire has been expressed
that it be preserved in permanent
| form, and it is accordingly printed
almost in full.
The invitation I had the pleasure
|of receiving from the Faculty Com
: inittee to deliver the Founders' Day
address on this occasion came with
the suggestion that I should speak
from my personal knowledge of the

life and public services of Senator
Leland Stanford. The suggestion
was most acceptable, since it required
nothing more serious or exacting than
the recalling of events in the general
order of a narrative. This effort has
had a personal interest, and has
brought to my mind many interesting
associations connected with the pub
lic affairs of this state and nation, in
which Senator Stanford was a promi
nent figure, and which 1 think illus
trate in a marked degree his original
ity, courage and strength of char
acter.
My acquaintance with Leland Stan
ford covered a period of more than
thirty years, and during part of that
time my relations with him were of
such a nature that phases of his char
acter were brought under my obser
vation that made me know him as a
most unique, independent and com
manding personality.


Judge William \\. Morrow
