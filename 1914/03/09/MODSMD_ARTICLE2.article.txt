# JUDGE MORROW RECALLS MEMORIES OF FOUNDERS
## INTIMATE TRIBUTE OF FRIEND STIRS ASSEMBLAGE Address Presents Impressions of Le-land Stanford Gathered During Thirty Years 
### 
The Founders' Day address deliv
ered this morning by Judge William
W. Morrow conies from an especially
authentic source, and constitutes the
j most elaborate memorial to Senator
Stanford yet attempted. For this
reason a desire has been expressed
that it be preserved in permanent
| form, and it is accordingly printed
almost in full.
The invitation I had the pleasure
|of receiving from the Faculty Com
: inittee to deliver the Founders' Day
address on this occasion came with
the suggestion that I should speak
from my personal knowledge of the

life and public services of Senator
Leland Stanford. The suggestion
was most acceptable, since it required
nothing more serious or exacting than
the recalling of events in the general
order of a narrative. This effort has
had a personal interest, and has
brought to my mind many interesting
associations connected with the pub
lic affairs of this state and nation, in
which Senator Stanford was a promi
nent figure, and which 1 think illus
trate in a marked degree his original
ity, courage and strength of char
acter.
My acquaintance with Leland Stan
ford covered a period of more than
thirty years, and during part of that
time my relations with him were of
such a nature that phases of his char
acter were brought under my obser
vation that made me know him as a
most unique, independent and com
manding personality.


Judge William \\. Morrow
He was born at Watervliet, New York, on March 9th, 1824 â€”ninety years
ago to-day. Watervliet is about eight miles above Albany, on the Hudson
River. Ilis father was of English stock, with Irish blood in his veins. This
was a combination from which we might expect an individual possessed of
vigorous Qualities of mind and body, coupled with courage and sound judg
ment, and balanced with a strain of quaint, happy humor. These qualities
do in fact appear to have been inherited in full vigor by the sou. The father
was a farmer, and for a time at least a railroad contractor. These parental
occupations must have given the son an early practical view of the affairs
of life and a habit of constant sell' reliance that would be likely to grow into
marked independence of judgment and will.
We start then with heredity, environment and an early experience favora
ble to the future efficiency and independence of the son, who had, moreover,
the advantage of a good, practical education. He studied law and was ad
mitted to the bar in IS4B. In that year lie yielded to the spirit of the day
and moved west to Port Washington, Wisconsin, where he practiced law. He
visited his New York home in 1850 and was there married to Miss .lane La
throp, and returned with his wife to Port Washington. In 1552 a fire de
stroyed his law library and household effects. This misfortune caused him
to consider the advantage of going still further west, and as a result he came
to California. He left his wife with her father in Albany, New York, and
reached California in July, 1552. He visited his brothers who were engaged
in a general merchandise business in Sacramento, and soon after he entered
into the same business for himself at Cold Springs, in Eldorado County. In
1853 he opened a store at Michigan Bluffs, in Placer County,a very prosperous
mining section, and lie also engaged in mining and was highly successlul.
In 1855 he purchased the business of his brothers in Sacramento and the
same year returned cast and brought Mrs. Stanford to California and estab
lished his home at Sacramento.
An Original Republican.
He was an original Republican, and with a few others organized the
Republican Party in Sacramento in 1556. All Republicans were progressives
in those days, and correspondingly fearless. Senator Cole, in his memoirs,
speaking of the Republican Party in Sacramento at that time, says: "The
party at its inception was extremely limited in numbers"; that beside him
self there were "Leland Stanford, C. P. Huntington, Mark Hopkins, Edwin B.
and Charles Crocker, and that besides these there were not for some time as
many as could be counted on one's fingers." But this small party does not
appear to have been ignored by others in the community because of its lack
of numbers. Its members were denounced as agitators, disturbers of the
peace and traitors to the country. Violence against them was resorted to
occasionally, and efforts of intimidation often. Senator Colo gives the copy
of a public notice, printed in large type and posted about the City of Sacra
mento on May 13th, 1856. It was headed, "To Arms," and called upon "all
good citizens to attend a public meeting" at a place named "to devise means
to protect the public welfare by appointing a committee to hang all the leaders
and as many of the attaches of said traitors as may be deemed necessary
to restore the public quiet and put a stop to such treasonable practices."
This notice was understood to be directed against Mr. Stanford and his asso
ciates. It was probably nothing more than a species of intimidation; but
whatever its object it could not have been highly pleasant reading for those
to whom it referred. The historian fails to give us any further information
concerning the meeting. Nobody appears to have been hung; but we are leit
to infer that this little band of agitators followed Franklin's wise advice
given to the signers of the Declaration of Indpendence. They hung together
and thus escaped being hanged separately.
I do not mention these matters to recall ancient animosities, long since
forgiven and forgotten. Mr. Stanford was himself among the first to forgive
and forget, save the humor of some of the situations, to which he sometimes
referred; but T mention these incidents to show you the man in action under
circumstances and conditions calculated to test the strength of his physical
and moral fiber, and his ability to meet the passions and turbulence of a new
community fearlessly and with perfect equanimity.
In 1857 Mr. Stanford was the Republican candidate for state treasurer;
but the party was of such recent origin that its nominations were merely
matters of form to maintain the party organization. In 1859 he was the
nominee of his party for Governor. The Democratic Party was divided. One
wing, being known as the Lecompton Party, nominated a ticket with Mr.
Latham as candidate for Governor, and the other wing, or Anti-Lecompton
Party, nominated a ticket with Judge John Curry for that office. There was
a natural tendency for the latter party to unite with the Republican Party,
as it subsequently did; but at this time there were influences at work in
favor of the Republican Party withdrawing from the field. Horace Greeley,
the editor of the New York Tribune, a man of distinction, and the foremost
Republican in the United States, arrived in California in the summer of 1559.
lie was everywhere received with the greatest enthusiasm and accorded every
consideration. Tie made a number of speeches in the state, and, regarding
himself as entitled by his position to advise Republicans as to their duty, he
proposed that they should withdraw their ticket and support the Anti-Le
compton Party.
The proposition was submitted to Mr. Stanford. His reply was charac
teristic of the man. He declined to withdraw, maintaining with firmness that
it was the duty of the Republican Party to stand by its principles whatever
the result. He preferred to go down to defeat rather than to surrender to
an opposing party the standard placed in his hands by his political friends
and supporters. He was not a mere office seeker. He was charged with the
duty of preserving the integrity of a party organization, and he would per
form that duty. Like Mr. Lincoln he would not be the last to desert. He
would not desert at all. He was defeated at the polls, but be demonstrated
to the people of the state that he was not a weak or an uncertain leader.
He was again nominated for Governor in 1861, and it was in this cam
paign that 1 first became acquainted with him. T was then located at Santa
Rosa. I was anxious to hear him, although I was not then a voter. I had
come to California two years before from the state of Illinois, where political
questions occupied the public mind to the exclusion of almost every other
subject. I had heard such public speakers as Lincoln, Douglass, Trumbull,
Browning and many others of their type. These were all rugged men of dis
tinguished ability, combined with great force of character. Coming here
from such a field of political discussion, my first impression of California
speakers was a disappointment. They seemed to me to be lacking in force
and in an understanding of national questions. I inquired for the joint de

bates between candidates, with which I had been familiar, and the keen dis
cussion of such national questions as the Missouri Compromise, the Dred
Scott decision, and the Leconipton Constitution. In Illinois the discussion
of political questions was about the only diversion the people had, and they
were accustomed to hear public speakers gifted with the force of persuasive
eloquence. It seemed to me that the California speakers did not measure up
to the standard we had in Illinois; but I was told to be patient until I heard
such speakers as Colonel E. D. Baker, Frederick P. Tracy, Thomas Starr
King, Thomas Fitch, Henry Edgerton, and other orators of repute. I soon
heard these speakers, and while they had culture of a high order, they lacked
the plain homely frontier character of the middle west. But I soon became
convinced that there were political orators in California as well as in Illinois.
Incidentally it may be said that Colonel Baker, the greatest orator of modern
times, was from Illinois and had been an associate of Mr. Lincoln. He had
been trained in the Illinois school of political discussion, and was a master
of the art. He was a soldier, orator and statesman.
While I was in this state of curiosity about the public speakers of the
state, Mr. Stanford was advertised to speak in Santa Rosa on the issues of
the day. lie was a leader of the new party, based upon a new and an untried
platform of principles. The political sentiment of that place at that time
was decidedly unfriendly to the new party and its candidates. Mr. Stanford
was received respectfully, but not enthusiastically. His personal appearance
was impressive. He was then thirty-seven years of age, large of frame, with
a swarthy complexion and something of the plain rugged features of the
frontiersman. He was dignified in manner, with a peculiarly attractive com
posure. His voice was melodious and pleasant; his language clear and ex
pressive. He was listened to by a large audience with respectful interest.
He wasted no time on immaterial questions but went directly into the issues
of the campaign. The platform of the party had declared in favor of the com
mon school system, and insisted that it should be sustained in all of its es
sential features, and its benefits and efficiency extended. The platform also
declared in favor of distributing the public lands of the United States to
homestead settlers, and pledged the party to aid the immediate construction
of a transcontinental railroad. The platform declared further that the Re
publicans of California pledged themselves, and all they had, to sustain the
national administration at Washington. Mr. Lincoln had been elected in the
previous November, and on the fourth of March had been inaugurated Presi
dent. Mr. Stanford had been a delegate from California to the National Re
publican Convention that had placed Mr. Lincoln in nomination, and had ad
vocated his election. He was the President's friend and adviser, and the two
men had much that was in common.
In Mr. Stanford's speech on the occasion to which I refer, he discussed
the platform of the party and declared his adherence to its principles. He
spoke with the eloquence of an honest conviction. He believed that the public
school system was at the very foundation of our form of government; that
the public domain should be given freely to actual settlers for the building
of homes; that the Pacific Railroad should be built at the earliest possible
moment that the people of the Pacific Coast might have quick and ample com
munication with the east. He declared that he was doing and would continue
to do what he could to further the project; and in concluding he paid a
splendid and feeling tribute to the high character and patriotism of Mr. Lin
coln, and his administration, and its purpose to maintain the perpetuity of
the Union.
Elected Governor of California.
It is difficult now to understand how any of these questions could have
ever been a subject of serious discussion; but they were, and the discussions
were vigorous, sometimes violent. Mr. Stanford presented them in an able
and fearless manner in all of the principal localities of the state. He gained
the confidence of the people by his plain, straightforward speech and man
ner, and was elected by a large plurality. His term of office was for two
years. Having become president of the Central Pacific Railroad, then in
course of construction, he declined a renomination. During his term of
office as governor he gave the state a wise and an efficient administration
and was counted one of the "War Governors" of the nation, taking a place in
support of the national cause along side of such governors as Andrews of
Massachusetts, Washburn of Maine, Morgan of New York, Curtin of Penn
sylvania, Morton of Indiana, Yates of Illinois and Kirkwood of lowa.
In June, 1861, and ten days after Mr. Stanford had been nominated for
Governor, he and a few other citizens of Sacramento organized and incor
porated the Central Pacific Railroad Company, under the laws of the State
of California, with Mr. Stanford as the president of the corporation. Con
gress had not then passed the act to aid in the construction of the railroad
and telegraph line from the Missouri River to the Pacific Ocean. That act
was not passed until July Ist, 1562. It organized the Union Pacific Railroad
Company with an imposing array of stockholders, to build a railroad west
from the Missouri River to a connection with the Central Pacific Railroad of
California. Mr. Stanford's associates were not so conspicuous, but they were
men of ability and character. Among them were Theodore D. .ludah, a dis
tinguished engineer, C. P. Huntington, Mark Hopkins and Charles Crocker,
merchants of Sacramento. There were a few others, but these were the men
who afterwards became known in the construction of the road, and in the
affairs of the state and nation in connection with this enterprise.
The object of the corporation which these men formed was to construct
a railroad from Sacramento eastward on the line of the proposed transcon
tinental railroad, and on January Bth, 1563, Governor Stanford turned the
first spadeful of earth in Sacramento for its construction. At that time the
only railroads in the state were a short line from Sacramento to Polsom, a
distance of about twenty miles, and a partly constructed railroad from San
Francisco to San Jose. The construction of these two short lines had been
very-expensive, and were in fact a warning against the prosecution of an
other such enterprise at that time. Railroad iron, locomotives and other
rolling stock had to be brought from the east around the Horn in sailing
vessels; and the cost of all kinds of material was very high, and labor dear
and scarce.
Judge Morrow at this point eloquently told the graphic narrative of the
building of the Central Pacific railroad, showing the indomitable will with
which its construction was pushed forward. He discussed the incorporation
of the Southern Pacific and threatened competition from the Atlantic and
Pacific and Texas and Pacific roads, and continued:
In this way Governor Stanford and his associates met and blocked these
two roads coming from the east at the boundary line of the state, one tempo
rarily and the other permanently. The Atlantic and Pacific subsequently
purchased the Southern Pacific line from Mohave to the Needles, and the
Santa Fe, its successor, finally reached the Bay of San Francisco by an inde
pendent terminal at Point Richmond. The Texas Pacific railroad never
reached the Colorado River, but the Southern Pacific, building eastward from
Yuma, pushed on across Arizona and New Mexico, and met the Texas Pacific
at the Rio Grande, near El Paso, in the State of Texas.
Under another act of Congress passed in 1566, the Central Pacific rail
road, under the name of the California and Oregon railroad, was authorized
to build northward toward the Oregon lino to connect with another railroad
coming south from Portland, Oregon. This line was built and a road opened
to Portland.
Governor Stanford and his associates also acquired control of short lines
by which they reached the Bay of San Francisco from the Sacramento and
San Joaquin Valleys. They also built a line down the coast; and with all
these lines, connections and terminals they secured substantial control of
the transportation facilities of the state, and in 1885 they merged all of these
railroads under the control of the Southern Pacific Company.
I mention these matters to show with what determination, force and
ability these men pushed forward against formidable opposition, and in the
fact of difficulties obtained the substantial control of the transportation facili
ties of the state. It has been said that others could have done the same thing
with the same assistance in national bonds, land grants and other contribu
tions. The fact remains that others, with like opportunities, did not make
the effort, and that others failed, with the same opportunities, to carry to
successful completion, corresponding enterprises. Every transcontinental
railroad coming westward toward the coast, and with which the Central Pa
cific railroad or the Southern Pacific railroad was authorized to connect,
failed at one time or another to meet their financial obligations, and were
placed by the courts in the hands of receivers. Comparisons are odious, and
however tempting this one may be, it will not be carried further.
But it is a fair question to ask: What have been the financial operations
of the corporations involved in the Southern Pacific System? Have any of
these failed to meet their obligations? Have any of them been in the hands
of receivers? AVe find 110 such records. They appear to have paid their debts
at maturity, including the bonded debt and interest due to the United States
by the Central Pacific. Perhaps some credit may be due to Governor Stan
ford and his associates for so having managed these properties that all the
corporations under their control have maintained their financial integrity
from the first spadeful of earth turned 011 the Bth day of January, 1863, down
to the present time.
During all this time of construction, Governor Stanford continued at the
head of the corporations incorporated into this one controlling system. The
people and press of the state protested, and charged that a grasping monop
oly had been formed to appropriate the transportation facilities of the state.
It was insisted that competitive transcontinental lines should be admitted
into tlie state and competition in freight and passen&ei lates seemed.
Governor Stanford and his associates proceeded upon the theory that
whatever monopoly there was in the Southern Pacific system was for the
best interests of the state; that what the state needed was the development
of its extensive and valuable resources, and that to do this it was impera
tive that railroad transportation be extended to all points of the state where
business would justify it, either presently or prospectively; that one cor
poration or one system, witli its connecting lines and terminals, could do
this better and cheaper than several; that additional transcontinental lines
would not be competitive, and would not confer the benefits that were ex
pected by the public.
During the time Governor Stanford and his associates continued in con
trol of the Southern Pacific System they never wavered in their adherence
to this policy Neither did the press nor the public, until very recently,
abandon their opposition to that policy. The Santa Pc came into the state as
a competing road for business, but not with respect to rates foi fi eight and
fares, which now became matters for the Interstate Commerce Commission
and the State Railroad Commission.
This question of railroad competition now comes up 111 a legal aspect.
The Federal Government had submitted to the courts the question whether
the merging of the Central Pacific and its terminals, into the Southern Pa
cific System, is a monopoly in restraint of trade and commerce in violation
of the Sherman Anti-trust Law. This action 011 the part of the government
is now being vigorously resisted by substantially the entiic business inteiesls
of the state, upon the ground that the merging of these connecting lines and
terminal facilities twenty-nine years ago was for the best interests of the
people of this state, and is so now. The farseeing policy that constructed
this system is now approved by the public, and the policy ot Goveinoi Stan
ford and his associates in extending and developing the Southern Pacific
System from ISGS to 18S5 is now the declared policy of the people of the state
of California in dealing with this transcontinental transportation question.
Upon the legal question I express no opinion, but upon the question of policy
I have the opinion of a citizen that the present situation should not be
disturbed.
All Advocnte of Educational Legislation.
I come now to a period of a very different character, when my relations
with Governor Stanford became official, personal and in some respects quite
intimate. In January, ISBS, Governor Stanford was elected by the legislature
of the state to the United States Senate for the term of six years commencing
on March 4, 18S5. I had been elected in November, 18S4, to the House of
Representatives from the San Francisco District, for the term of two years
commencing also 011 March 4, 1885. By reelection I served six years in the
House of Representatives, from 1885 to 1891.
During this time it was customary for Senator Stanford to have frequent
conferences at his house with the California members of the House of Repre
sentatives concerning California matters. These conferences were nearly
always interesting, and sometimes amusing,â€”interesting because they either
related to some matter of legislation before Congress, or something pending
before one or more of the departments in which important interests of the
state were concerned, â€”amusing because of the extraordinary demands made
upon the Senators and members of Congress by their constituents, â€”from
turnip seeds and popcorn to patents for nutmeg graters and flying machines.
We speak of public officials as public servants, but we never use that term
with so much accuracy and feeling as when we apply it to Senators or Repre
sentatives in Congress. They are public servants, practically as well as
theoretically, with only one substantial privilege at their service,â€”and that
is to make speeches in the Congressional Record and send them free through
the mail to their constituents. Senator Stanford never availed himself of
this privilege. He was an efficient, conscientious public servant, performing
all his duties faithfully and cheerfully. He never complained of the burden
of small and often trifling demands.
One of the first subjects of national importance to engage his attention
was that of education, in which he was deeply interested. A bill had been
introduced in Congress by Senator Blair of New Hampshire to aid in the
establishment and temporary support of the common schools. The bill pro
vided for the distribution of seventy-seven millions of dollars among the
several states and territories in proportion to the illiteracy in each state or
territory. The distribution was to be in installments covering a period of
eight years. The bill was fully discussed by the leading senators. In the
course of the debate, on February 25, 1890, Senator Stanford delivered a
speech in support of the bill in which he said some pertinent things about
education: â€”
"In my opinion." said he, "our government can have no higher object
than to secure to the people a high degree of intelligence, thereby assisting
them to the attainment of the possibilities of humanity. Those possibilities
and the beneficence of the Creator to man on earth are one and the same,
for it is obvious that there could be no beneficence in the unattainable. Had
we been given reasonable wants without the means of gratifying them, the
Creator's beneficence would be a failure.
"But when we look around at the sources of supply for our wants,
whether physical or intellectual, we find them inexhaustibly supplied in the
soil, waters, forests, mines and quarries. The raw material is everywhere
within our reach, requiring only the intelligent application of labor and the
control of the forces of nature. How this labor is to be supplied, and this
control obtained, is what education will teach."
He believed in education of the masses, and he particularly favored the

bill then under consideration because it provided for the education of both
sexes alike for their respective callings. He believed in the early education
of the child for the moral influence it would have in forming his character
and in laying the foundation for his future efficiency. He believed in educat
ing all classes for the active duties of life, and for the deeper insight it gave
into nature, and the greater knowledge of her wonderful forces, which, being
understood, developed and brought under control, would enable humanity to
realize the glorious destiny marked out for it by the Creator.
The bill which he was then supporting was defeated, mainly, as I recall,
on constitutional grounds. But he supported other educational bills which
became laws, notably bills in aid of state agricultural colleges, providing for
experimental stations, and a more thorough training in agricultural pursuits.
He was himself an agriculturalist on a large scale, and with his extensive
land holdings he naturally took a practical interest in the industry. But his
interest was much more than personal. He viewed the production of the soil
from the standpoint of the nation's welfare, and believed that the nation might
increase its wealth enormously by the introduction of intelligent, economical
methods.
A Pioneer Advocate of Land Loan Laws.
He accordingly proposed a scheme for government loans on real estate,
which should have the double purpose of furnishing the country with an
elastic currency of sufficient volume to meet its requirements, and at the
same time supply the farmer with money at a low rate of interest to meet
the necessities of his calling, and make agriculture profitable and attractive.
The scheme was a bold one, but it was one in which Senator Stanford had the
utmost confidence, and he was astonished that it did not receive general ap
proval. I think the greatest disappointment he suffered during his senatorial
career was his failure to secure any general support for this bill.
In view of recent legislation, it would seem that his failure was due
mainly to the fact that he was at least twenty years in advance of the times.
Senator Stanford was essentially a progressive, and he was generally a
pioneer in whatever he undertook, whether it was the formation of a political
party, building a railroad, developing some new industry, or founding a Uni
versity. He could see well into the future, and he usually saw his efforts
successful; but in this instance lie did not see his scheme adopted. Now,
I am not going to discuss this financial question in any great detail. Mr.
Gladstone is reported to have said in a debate in the British House of Com
mons concerning some financial measure before it, that there were two roads
rÂ»ilroad timetable, and the other was the study of the principles of banking
and currency. For your sakes as well as for my own, I shall touch but lightly
upon this financial question.
But a few words of explanation are necessary to understand the full
scope and purposes of Senator Stanford's scheme: â€”
The speaker now explained the scope and purpose of Senator Stanford's
scheme, and the financial situation preceding the panic of 1893.
While this financial storm was brewing, Senator Stanford brought for
ward his land loan scheme. He first introduced a resolution in the Senate,
on March 10th, 1890, instructing the finance committee of that body to report
what relief might be provided by the United States government for the strin
gency in the money market, and particularly whether loans might be made
by the government upon mortgages. This resolution failed to receive any
consideration. On May 20th, IS9O, he introduced a bill entitled, "A bill to
provide the government with means sufficient to supply the national govern
ment with a sound circulating medium." This bill provided that the treasurer
of the United States should cause to be printed notes of the United States
to the amount of one hundred millions of dollars, and such additional amounts
from time to time as should be necessary to meet the requirements of the
act. These notes were to be a legal tender for all private and certain public
debts, and were to be loaned on unincumbered agricultural land upon interest
at the rate of two per cent per annum. A loan was not to exceed one half
of the assessed value of the land and for a term of not to exceed twenty
years. No loan was to be for a sum less than $250. The bill provided for a
bureau in the treasury department to administer the provisions of the act.
A few days after the introduction of this bill Senator Stanford made a
speech in its support in which he explained its provisions, and contended
that the plan of loaning money upon land at two per cent, with the privilege
to the borrower of returning it when he had no use for it, would create a
money system that would meet financial expansions and contractions as they
might occur. He did not claim, however, that his bill had been perfected in
detail. What he did claim was that the principle of loaning the credit of
the nation upon sufficient security, to those who needed it, should be ex
tended to the farmers on the security of real estate as had already been done
to the national banks on the security of United States bonds, and that the
financial condition of the country urgently required legislation to that end.
The bill was referred to the Senate Committee on Finance. That committee,
composed it must be said, of able and experienced statesmen, reported on
tfc bill adversely, classifying the proposed scheme with a number of others in
this country and elsewhere that had operated disastrously. The committee
held the bill to be bad in substance, and unconstitutional. Upon this report
the bill was indefinitely postponed.
In January, 1891, Senator Stanford was re-elected to the Senate for a
second term of six years, and be again introduced his land loan bill with
another bill placing the scheme squarely upon a gold basis. In January, 1892,
he made another and more elaborate speech in its support, at the same time
replying to the adverse report of the Finance Committee made in the previous
Congress. He was now thoroughly aroused and defended bis scheme with
great force. A Kansas Senator came to his support, and it looked as though
the bill was about to be considered on its merits, and amended so as to pro
vide against the possibility of an inflated currency. The bill was pending
in the Senate at the time of Senator Stanford's death on June 21st, 1593.
Senator Stanford Eulogized.
At the memorial exercises in the United States Senate on September 16,
1593, and in the House of Representatives on February 12, 1894, the members
of both houses paid feeling tributes to the life and character of Senator Stan
ford. The address of Senator Daniel of Virginia, in particular, was very im
pressive by reason of the eloquent and feeling personality of his remarks.
He referred to the land loan bill in terms that corresponded so nearly with
my own experience that I venture to repeat them here:â€”
"He (Senator Stanford) had some ideas which he was never able to im
press upon his associates as being practicable, among them liis idea of lend
ing vast amounts of money upon land. I have talked with him for hours and
hours upon repeated occasions on that theme, and he often urged me to adopt
his views and advocate them. I could neever see that they were practicable,
and with all my respect for him and desire to meet his wishes T could not,
of course, comply with his request. Yet let me say that beneath the difficul
ties which present themselves to such an idea as he had formed, there are
in it germs of truth and wisdom such as are found in the first evolutions of
invention, which, in a later and riper day of the world's history, may be de
veloped into much that is attainable and good. ... As the world's pop
ulation shall increase, and as financial refinements and facilities shall be
developed, there will be found in this idea much to build upon, and in the
end probably some ripe consummation."
How gracious and candid this was: This was twenty years ago. We have
experienced some squally financial times since then. The period commenced
with the panic of 1893 and included the panic of 1907: but the country has
made substantial progress in its financial system during this time, and in
the direction of Senator Stanford's scheme. This progress will be found in
the recent act of December 23, 1913, providing for reserve banks and an
elastic currency, with gold as the standard of values. Mr. Horace White,
the well known editor and financial expert, writing of this act in the North
American Review, says: â€”
"Twenty years was required to prepare public opinion, including that of
bankers and congressmen, for the adoption of asset currency in the place of
bond currency."
Judge Morrow proceeded to show that present financial legislation rests
upon the basic principle of Senator Stanford's land loan bill.
The Founding of Stanford University.
We come now to the last and most impressive and important act of Sen
ator Stanford's remarkable career, â€”the founding of this great university,
when he said, "The children of California shall be my children." In this act
we associate the name of that true and faithful companion and devoted wife,
Jane Lathrop Stanford. The founding of this university was the blending of
the pride and glory of both of their lives, in a vision of higher needs and
deeper realities. For thirty-five years they had been co-workers in all of
the affairs of life, reaching out to noble works and generous deeds. But now,
in memory of their idolized son, they lovingly united in founding this institu
tion as a perpetual memorial to his youthful ambition to better the world by
education.
In January, 1885, Senator Stanford submitted to the legislature of this
state an act to advance learning, and the arts and sciences, by providing for
the foundation and endowment within the state of universities and other
institutions of learning. This act passed both houses of the legislature and
was approved by the Governor on March 9th, 1885, â€”twenty-nine years ago
to-day. This act was general in its terms in accordance with the constitu
tional requirement, but was intended to be and was in fact the foundation
of this university. It is a happy coincidence that we commemorate the birth
of the founder, Leland Stanford, and the foundation act, on the same day.
Selection of the First President.
The seection of the first president for this university was a matter of
very serious concern with Senator and Mrs. Stanford. Their ideal of a presi
dent was as exceptional and as exalted as their ideal of the institution they
were founding; and accordingly the whole field of eligible persons was thor
oughly canvassed, and the qualifications of each carefully weighed with re
spect to the immediate work of organization, as well as ability to project the
lines of future development. It was from such a process of weighing and
sifting that the selection fell upon that distinguished scientist and able
executive, David Starr Jordan.
Senator and Mrs. Stanford were very earnest and very laborious in the
effort to frame the outline of an institution whose teachings would be of the
highest character. They believed in the value of present knowledge, but they
also believed in the value of work expended in the discovery of new truths.
They believed in teaching the student how to thread his way through the
known regions of knowledge, but they also believed in extending the boun
daries of knowledge into the unexplored; that humanity might know and
possess its inheritance. An institution to correspond to such a plan must
necessarily be a growth, the result of the slow process of evolution.
"Every true man," says Emerson, "is a cause, a country and an age;
requires infinite spaces and numbers and time fully to accomplish his design."
We look upon this university in that light, and behold it in the process
of development reflecting the spirit and purpose of its founders. We see
now the university taking its place as a force in the march of progress, ad
vancing the standards of skill and efficiency, and equipping explorers for new
fields of knowledge in the search for truth. We see it working out its des
tiny in promoting "the public welfare by exercising an influence in behalf
of humanity and civilization, teaching the blessings of liberty regulated by
law, inculcating love and reverence for the great principles of government
as derived from the inalienable rights of man to life, liberty and the pursuit
of. happiness."
We assemble here to-day to recall these works, revive the prophetic
vision of the founders; and pay our tribute of respect to the genius of the
builders who, building as they knew, built for all time.
The Founders' Day address deliv
ered this morning by Judge William
W. Morrow conies from an especially
authentic source, and constitutes the
j most elaborate memorial to Senator
Stanford yet attempted. For this
reason a desire has been expressed
that it be preserved in permanent
| form, and it is accordingly printed
almost in full.
The invitation I had the pleasure
|of receiving from the Faculty Com
: inittee to deliver the Founders' Day
address on this occasion came with
the suggestion that I should speak
from my personal knowledge of the

life and public services of Senator
Leland Stanford. The suggestion
was most acceptable, since it required
nothing more serious or exacting than
the recalling of events in the general
order of a narrative. This effort has
had a personal interest, and has
brought to my mind many interesting
associations connected with the pub
lic affairs of this state and nation, in
which Senator Stanford was a promi
nent figure, and which 1 think illus
trate in a marked degree his original
ity, courage and strength of char
acter.
My acquaintance with Leland Stan
ford covered a period of more than
thirty years, and during part of that
time my relations with him were of
such a nature that phases of his char
acter were brought under my obser
vation that made me know him as a
most unique, independent and com
manding personality.


Judge William \\. Morrow
He was born at Watervliet, New York, on March 9th, 1824 â€”ninety years
ago to-day. Watervliet is about eight miles above Albany, on the Hudson
River. Ilis father was of English stock, with Irish blood in his veins. This
was a combination from which we might expect an individual possessed of
vigorous Qualities of mind and body, coupled with courage and sound judg
ment, and balanced with a strain of quaint, happy humor. These qualities
do in fact appear to have been inherited in full vigor by the sou. The father
was a farmer, and for a time at least a railroad contractor. These parental
occupations must have given the son an early practical view of the affairs
of life and a habit of constant sell' reliance that would be likely to grow into
marked independence of judgment and will.
We start then with heredity, environment and an early experience favora
ble to the future efficiency and independence of the son, who had, moreover,
the advantage of a good, practical education. He studied law and was ad
mitted to the bar in IS4B. In that year lie yielded to the spirit of the day
and moved west to Port Washington, Wisconsin, where he practiced law. He
visited his New York home in 1850 and was there married to Miss .lane La
throp, and returned with his wife to Port Washington. In 1552 a fire de
stroyed his law library and household effects. This misfortune caused him
to consider the advantage of going still further west, and as a result he came
to California. He left his wife with her father in Albany, New York, and
reached California in July, 1552. He visited his brothers who were engaged
in a general merchandise business in Sacramento, and soon after he entered
into the same business for himself at Cold Springs, in Eldorado County. In
1853 he opened a store at Michigan Bluffs, in Placer County,a very prosperous
mining section, and lie also engaged in mining and was highly successlul.
In 1855 he purchased the business of his brothers in Sacramento and the
same year returned cast and brought Mrs. Stanford to California and estab
lished his home at Sacramento.
An Original Republican.
He was an original Republican, and with a few others organized the
Republican Party in Sacramento in 1556. All Republicans were progressives
in those days, and correspondingly fearless. Senator Cole, in his memoirs,
speaking of the Republican Party in Sacramento at that time, says: "The
party at its inception was extremely limited in numbers"; that beside him
self there were "Leland Stanford, C. P. Huntington, Mark Hopkins, Edwin B.
and Charles Crocker, and that besides these there were not for some time as
many as could be counted on one's fingers." But this small party does not
appear to have been ignored by others in the community because of its lack
of numbers. Its members were denounced as agitators, disturbers of the
peace and traitors to the country. Violence against them was resorted to
occasionally, and efforts of intimidation often. Senator Colo gives the copy
of a public notice, printed in large type and posted about the City of Sacra
mento on May 13th, 1856. It was headed, "To Arms," and called upon "all
good citizens to attend a public meeting" at a place named "to devise means
to protect the public welfare by appointing a committee to hang all the leaders
and as many of the attaches of said traitors as may be deemed necessary
to restore the public quiet and put a stop to such treasonable practices."
This notice was understood to be directed against Mr. Stanford and his asso
ciates. It was probably nothing more than a species of intimidation; but
whatever its object it could not have been highly pleasant reading for those
to whom it referred. The historian fails to give us any further information
concerning the meeting. Nobody appears to have been hung; but we are leit
to infer that this little band of agitators followed Franklin's wise advice
given to the signers of the Declaration of Indpendence. They hung together
and thus escaped being hanged separately.
I do not mention these matters to recall ancient animosities, long since
forgiven and forgotten. Mr. Stanford was himself among the first to forgive
and forget, save the humor of some of the situations, to which he sometimes
referred; but T mention these incidents to show you the man in action under
circumstances and conditions calculated to test the strength of his physical
and moral fiber, and his ability to meet the passions and turbulence of a new
community fearlessly and with perfect equanimity.
In 1857 Mr. Stanford was the Republican candidate for state treasurer;
but the party was of such recent origin that its nominations were merely
matters of form to maintain the party organization. In 1859 he was the
nominee of his party for Governor. The Democratic Party was divided. One
wing, being known as the Lecompton Party, nominated a ticket with Mr.
Latham as candidate for Governor, and the other wing, or Anti-Lecompton
Party, nominated a ticket with Judge John Curry for that office. There was
a natural tendency for the latter party to unite with the Republican Party,
as it subsequently did; but at this time there were influences at work in
favor of the Republican Party withdrawing from the field. Horace Greeley,
the editor of the New York Tribune, a man of distinction, and the foremost
Republican in the United States, arrived in California in the summer of 1559.
lie was everywhere received with the greatest enthusiasm and accorded every
consideration. Tie made a number of speeches in the state, and, regarding
himself as entitled by his position to advise Republicans as to their duty, he
proposed that they should withdraw their ticket and support the Anti-Le
compton Party.
The proposition was submitted to Mr. Stanford. His reply was charac
teristic of the man. He declined to withdraw, maintaining with firmness that
it was the duty of the Republican Party to stand by its principles whatever
the result. He preferred to go down to defeat rather than to surrender to
an opposing party the standard placed in his hands by his political friends
and supporters. He was not a mere office seeker. He was charged with the
duty of preserving the integrity of a party organization, and he would per
form that duty. Like Mr. Lincoln he would not be the last to desert. He
would not desert at all. He was defeated at the polls, but be demonstrated
to the people of the state that he was not a weak or an uncertain leader.
He was again nominated for Governor in 1861, and it was in this cam
paign that 1 first became acquainted with him. T was then located at Santa
Rosa. I was anxious to hear him, although I was not then a voter. I had
come to California two years before from the state of Illinois, where political
questions occupied the public mind to the exclusion of almost every other
subject. I had heard such public speakers as Lincoln, Douglass, Trumbull,
Browning and many others of their type. These were all rugged men of dis
tinguished ability, combined with great force of character. Coming here
from such a field of political discussion, my first impression of California
speakers was a disappointment. They seemed to me to be lacking in force
and in an understanding of national questions. I inquired for the joint de

bates between candidates, with which I had been familiar, and the keen dis
cussion of such national questions as the Missouri Compromise, the Dred
Scott decision, and the Leconipton Constitution. In Illinois the discussion
of political questions was about the only diversion the people had, and they
were accustomed to hear public speakers gifted with the force of persuasive
eloquence. It seemed to me that the California speakers did not measure up
to the standard we had in Illinois; but I was told to be patient until I heard
such speakers as Colonel E. D. Baker, Frederick P. Tracy, Thomas Starr
King, Thomas Fitch, Henry Edgerton, and other orators of repute. I soon
heard these speakers, and while they had culture of a high order, they lacked
the plain homely frontier character of the middle west. But I soon became
convinced that there were political orators in California as well as in Illinois.
Incidentally it may be said that Colonel Baker, the greatest orator of modern
times, was from Illinois and had been an associate of Mr. Lincoln. He had
been trained in the Illinois school of political discussion, and was a master
of the art. He was a soldier, orator and statesman.
While I was in this state of curiosity about the public speakers of the
state, Mr. Stanford was advertised to speak in Santa Rosa on the issues of
the day. lie was a leader of the new party, based upon a new and an untried
platform of principles. The political sentiment of that place at that time
was decidedly unfriendly to the new party and its candidates. Mr. Stanford
was received respectfully, but not enthusiastically. His personal appearance
was impressive. He was then thirty-seven years of age, large of frame, with
a swarthy complexion and something of the plain rugged features of the
frontiersman. He was dignified in manner, with a peculiarly attractive com
posure. His voice was melodious and pleasant; his language clear and ex
pressive. He was listened to by a large audience with respectful interest.
He wasted no time on immaterial questions but went directly into the issues
of the campaign. The platform of the party had declared in favor of the com
mon school system, and insisted that it should be sustained in all of its es
sential features, and its benefits and efficiency extended. The platform also
declared in favor of distributing the public lands of the United States to
homestead settlers, and pledged the party to aid the immediate construction
of a transcontinental railroad. The platform declared further that the Re
publicans of California pledged themselves, and all they had, to sustain the
national administration at Washington. Mr. Lincoln had been elected in the
previous November, and on the fourth of March had been inaugurated Presi
dent. Mr. Stanford had been a delegate from California to the National Re
publican Convention that had placed Mr. Lincoln in nomination, and had ad
vocated his election. He was the President's friend and adviser, and the two
men had much that was in common.
In Mr. Stanford's speech on the occasion to which I refer, he discussed
the platform of the party and declared his adherence to its principles. He
spoke with the eloquence of an honest conviction. He believed that the public
school system was at the very foundation of our form of government; that
the public domain should be given freely to actual settlers for the building
of homes; that the Pacific Railroad should be built at the earliest possible
moment that the people of the Pacific Coast might have quick and ample com
munication with the east. He declared that he was doing and would continue
to do what he could to further the project; and in concluding he paid a
splendid and feeling tribute to the high character and patriotism of Mr. Lin
coln, and his administration, and its purpose to maintain the perpetuity of
the Union.
Elected Governor of California.
It is difficult now to understand how any of these questions could have
ever been a subject of serious discussion; but they were, and the discussions
were vigorous, sometimes violent. Mr. Stanford presented them in an able
and fearless manner in all of the principal localities of the state. He gained
the confidence of the people by his plain, straightforward speech and man
ner, and was elected by a large plurality. His term of office was for two
years. Having become president of the Central Pacific Railroad, then in
course of construction, he declined a renomination. During his term of
office as governor he gave the state a wise and an efficient administration
and was counted one of the "War Governors" of the nation, taking a place in
support of the national cause along side of such governors as Andrews of
Massachusetts, Washburn of Maine, Morgan of New York, Curtin of Penn
sylvania, Morton of Indiana, Yates of Illinois and Kirkwood of lowa.
In June, 1861, and ten days after Mr. Stanford had been nominated for
Governor, he and a few other citizens of Sacramento organized and incor
porated the Central Pacific Railroad Company, under the laws of the State
of California, with Mr. Stanford as the president of the corporation. Con
gress had not then passed the act to aid in the construction of the railroad
and telegraph line from the Missouri River to the Pacific Ocean. That act
was not passed until July Ist, 1562. It organized the Union Pacific Railroad
Company with an imposing array of stockholders, to build a railroad west
from the Missouri River to a connection with the Central Pacific Railroad of
California. Mr. Stanford's associates were not so conspicuous, but they were
men of ability and character. Among them were Theodore D. .ludah, a dis
tinguished engineer, C. P. Huntington, Mark Hopkins and Charles Crocker,
merchants of Sacramento. There were a few others, but these were the men
who afterwards became known in the construction of the road, and in the
affairs of the state and nation in connection with this enterprise.
The object of the corporation which these men formed was to construct
a railroad from Sacramento eastward on the line of the proposed transcon
tinental railroad, and on January Bth, 1563, Governor Stanford turned the
first spadeful of earth in Sacramento for its construction. At that time the
only railroads in the state were a short line from Sacramento to Polsom, a
distance of about twenty miles, and a partly constructed railroad from San
Francisco to San Jose. The construction of these two short lines had been
very-expensive, and were in fact a warning against the prosecution of an
other such enterprise at that time. Railroad iron, locomotives and other
rolling stock had to be brought from the east around the Horn in sailing
vessels; and the cost of all kinds of material was very high, and labor dear
and scarce.
Judge Morrow at this point eloquently told the graphic narrative of the
building of the Central Pacific railroad, showing the indomitable will with
which its construction was pushed forward. He discussed the incorporation
of the Southern Pacific and threatened competition from the Atlantic and
Pacific and Texas and Pacific roads, and continued:
In this way Governor Stanford and his associates met and blocked these
two roads coming from the east at the boundary line of the state, one tempo
rarily and the other permanently. The Atlantic and Pacific subsequently
purchased the Southern Pacific line from Mohave to the Needles, and the
Santa Fe, its successor, finally reached the Bay of San Francisco by an inde
pendent terminal at Point Richmond. The Texas Pacific railroad never
reached the Colorado River, but the Southern Pacific, building eastward from
Yuma, pushed on across Arizona and New Mexico, and met the Texas Pacific
at the Rio Grande, near El Paso, in the State of Texas.
Under another act of Congress passed in 1566, the Central Pacific rail
road, under the name of the California and Oregon railroad, was authorized
to build northward toward the Oregon lino to connect with another railroad
coming south from Portland, Oregon. This line was built and a road opened
to Portland.
Governor Stanford and his associates also acquired control of short lines
by which they reached the Bay of San Francisco from the Sacramento and
San Joaquin Valleys. They also built a line down the coast; and with all
these lines, connections and terminals they secured substantial control of
the transportation facilities of the state, and in 1885 they merged all of these
railroads under the control of the Southern Pacific Company.
I mention these matters to show with what determination, force and
ability these men pushed forward against formidable opposition, and in the
fact of difficulties obtained the substantial control of the transportation facili
ties of the state. It has been said that others could have done the same thing
with the same assistance in national bonds, land grants and other contribu
tions. The fact remains that others, with like opportunities, did not make
the effort, and that others failed, with the same opportunities, to carry to
successful completion, corresponding enterprises. Every transcontinental
railroad coming westward toward the coast, and with which the Central Pa
cific railroad or the Southern Pacific railroad was authorized to connect,
failed at one time or another to meet their financial obligations, and were
placed by the courts in the hands of receivers. Comparisons are odious, and
however tempting this one may be, it will not be carried further.
But it is a fair question to ask: What have been the financial operations
of the corporations involved in the Southern Pacific System? Have any of
these failed to meet their obligations? Have any of them been in the hands
of receivers? AVe find 110 such records. They appear to have paid their debts
at maturity, including the bonded debt and interest due to the United States
by the Central Pacific. Perhaps some credit may be due to Governor Stan
ford and his associates for so having managed these properties that all the
corporations under their control have maintained their financial integrity
from the first spadeful of earth turned 011 the Bth day of January, 1863, down
to the present time.
During all this time of construction, Governor Stanford continued at the
head of the corporations incorporated into this one controlling system. The
people and press of the state protested, and charged that a grasping monop
oly had been formed to appropriate the transportation facilities of the state.
It was insisted that competitive transcontinental lines should be admitted
into tlie state and competition in freight and passen&ei lates seemed.
Governor Stanford and his associates proceeded upon the theory that
whatever monopoly there was in the Southern Pacific system was for the
best interests of the state; that what the state needed was the development
of its extensive and valuable resources, and that to do this it was impera
tive that railroad transportation be extended to all points of the state where
business would justify it, either presently or prospectively; that one cor
poration or one system, witli its connecting lines and terminals, could do
this better and cheaper than several; that additional transcontinental lines
would not be competitive, and would not confer the benefits that were ex
pected by the public.
During the time Governor Stanford and his associates continued in con
trol of the Southern Pacific System they never wavered in their adherence
to this policy Neither did the press nor the public, until very recently,
abandon their opposition to that policy. The Santa Pc came into the state as
a competing road for business, but not with respect to rates foi fi eight and
fares, which now became matters for the Interstate Commerce Commission
and the State Railroad Commission.
This question of railroad competition now comes up 111 a legal aspect.
The Federal Government had submitted to the courts the question whether
the merging of the Central Pacific and its terminals, into the Southern Pa
cific System, is a monopoly in restraint of trade and commerce in violation
of the Sherman Anti-trust Law. This action 011 the part of the government
is now being vigorously resisted by substantially the entiic business inteiesls
of the state, upon the ground that the merging of these connecting lines and
terminal facilities twenty-nine years ago was for the best interests of the
people of this state, and is so now. The farseeing policy that constructed
this system is now approved by the public, and the policy ot Goveinoi Stan
ford and his associates in extending and developing the Southern Pacific
System from ISGS to 18S5 is now the declared policy of the people of the state
of California in dealing with this transcontinental transportation question.
Upon the legal question I express no opinion, but upon the question of policy
I have the opinion of a citizen that the present situation should not be
disturbed.
All Advocnte of Educational Legislation.
I come now to a period of a very different character, when my relations
with Governor Stanford became official, personal and in some respects quite
intimate. In January, ISBS, Governor Stanford was elected by the legislature
of the state to the United States Senate for the term of six years commencing
on March 4, 18S5. I had been elected in November, 18S4, to the House of
Representatives from the San Francisco District, for the term of two years
commencing also 011 March 4, 1885. By reelection I served six years in the
House of Representatives, from 1885 to 1891.
During this time it was customary for Senator Stanford to have frequent
conferences at his house with the California members of the House of Repre
sentatives concerning California matters. These conferences were nearly
always interesting, and sometimes amusing,â€”interesting because they either
related to some matter of legislation before Congress, or something pending
before one or more of the departments in which important interests of the
state were concerned, â€”amusing because of the extraordinary demands made
upon the Senators and members of Congress by their constituents, â€”from
turnip seeds and popcorn to patents for nutmeg graters and flying machines.
We speak of public officials as public servants, but we never use that term
with so much accuracy and feeling as when we apply it to Senators or Repre
sentatives in Congress. They are public servants, practically as well as
theoretically, with only one substantial privilege at their service,â€”and that
is to make speeches in the Congressional Record and send them free through
the mail to their constituents. Senator Stanford never availed himself of
this privilege. He was an efficient, conscientious public servant, performing
all his duties faithfully and cheerfully. He never complained of the burden
of small and often trifling demands.
One of the first subjects of national importance to engage his attention
was that of education, in which he was deeply interested. A bill had been
introduced in Congress by Senator Blair of New Hampshire to aid in the
establishment and temporary support of the common schools. The bill pro
vided for the distribution of seventy-seven millions of dollars among the
several states and territories in proportion to the illiteracy in each state or
territory. The distribution was to be in installments covering a period of
eight years. The bill was fully discussed by the leading senators. In the
course of the debate, on February 25, 1890, Senator Stanford delivered a
speech in support of the bill in which he said some pertinent things about
education: â€”
"In my opinion." said he, "our government can have no higher object
than to secure to the people a high degree of intelligence, thereby assisting
them to the attainment of the possibilities of humanity. Those possibilities
and the beneficence of the Creator to man on earth are one and the same,
for it is obvious that there could be no beneficence in the unattainable. Had
we been given reasonable wants without the means of gratifying them, the
Creator's beneficence would be a failure.
"But when we look around at the sources of supply for our wants,
whether physical or intellectual, we find them inexhaustibly supplied in the
soil, waters, forests, mines and quarries. The raw material is everywhere
within our reach, requiring only the intelligent application of labor and the
control of the forces of nature. How this labor is to be supplied, and this
control obtained, is what education will teach."
He believed in education of the masses, and he particularly favored the

bill then under consideration because it provided for the education of both
sexes alike for their respective callings. He believed in the early education
of the child for the moral influence it would have in forming his character
and in laying the foundation for his future efficiency. He believed in educat
ing all classes for the active duties of life, and for the deeper insight it gave
into nature, and the greater knowledge of her wonderful forces, which, being
understood, developed and brought under control, would enable humanity to
realize the glorious destiny marked out for it by the Creator.
The bill which he was then supporting was defeated, mainly, as I recall,
on constitutional grounds. But he supported other educational bills which
became laws, notably bills in aid of state agricultural colleges, providing for
experimental stations, and a more thorough training in agricultural pursuits.
He was himself an agriculturalist on a large scale, and with his extensive
land holdings he naturally took a practical interest in the industry. But his
interest was much more than personal. He viewed the production of the soil
from the standpoint of the nation's welfare, and believed that the nation might
increase its wealth enormously by the introduction of intelligent, economical
methods.
A Pioneer Advocate of Land Loan Laws.
He accordingly proposed a scheme for government loans on real estate,
which should have the double purpose of furnishing the country with an
elastic currency of sufficient volume to meet its requirements, and at the
same time supply the farmer with money at a low rate of interest to meet
the necessities of his calling, and make agriculture profitable and attractive.
The scheme was a bold one, but it was one in which Senator Stanford had the
utmost confidence, and he was astonished that it did not receive general ap
proval. I think the greatest disappointment he suffered during his senatorial
career was his failure to secure any general support for this bill.
In view of recent legislation, it would seem that his failure was due
mainly to the fact that he was at least twenty years in advance of the times.
Senator Stanford was essentially a progressive, and he was generally a
pioneer in whatever he undertook, whether it was the formation of a political
party, building a railroad, developing some new industry, or founding a Uni
versity. He could see well into the future, and he usually saw his efforts
successful; but in this instance lie did not see his scheme adopted. Now,
I am not going to discuss this financial question in any great detail. Mr.
Gladstone is reported to have said in a debate in the British House of Com
mons concerning some financial measure before it, that there were two roads
rÂ»ilroad timetable, and the other was the study of the principles of banking
and currency. For your sakes as well as for my own, I shall touch but lightly
upon this financial question.
But a few words of explanation are necessary to understand the full
scope and purposes of Senator Stanford's scheme: â€”
The speaker now explained the scope and purpose of Senator Stanford's
scheme, and the financial situation preceding the panic of 1893.
While this financial storm was brewing, Senator Stanford brought for
ward his land loan scheme. He first introduced a resolution in the Senate,
on March 10th, 1890, instructing the finance committee of that body to report
what relief might be provided by the United States government for the strin
gency in the money market, and particularly whether loans might be made
by the government upon mortgages. This resolution failed to receive any
consideration. On May 20th, IS9O, he introduced a bill entitled, "A bill to
provide the government with means sufficient to supply the national govern
ment with a sound circulating medium." This bill provided that the treasurer
of the United States should cause to be printed notes of the United States
to the amount of one hundred millions of dollars, and such additional amounts
from time to time as should be necessary to meet the requirements of the
act. These notes were to be a legal tender for all private and certain public
debts, and were to be loaned on unincumbered agricultural land upon interest
at the rate of two per cent per annum. A loan was not to exceed one half
of the assessed value of the land and for a term of not to exceed twenty
years. No loan was to be for a sum less than $250. The bill provided for a
bureau in the treasury department to administer the provisions of the act.
A few days after the introduction of this bill Senator Stanford made a
speech in its support in which he explained its provisions, and contended
that the plan of loaning money upon land at two per cent, with the privilege
to the borrower of returning it when he had no use for it, would create a
money system that would meet financial expansions and contractions as they
might occur. He did not claim, however, that his bill had been perfected in
detail. What he did claim was that the principle of loaning the credit of
the nation upon sufficient security, to those who needed it, should be ex
tended to the farmers on the security of real estate as had already been done
to the national banks on the security of United States bonds, and that the
financial condition of the country urgently required legislation to that end.
The bill was referred to the Senate Committee on Finance. That committee,
composed it must be said, of able and experienced statesmen, reported on
tfc bill adversely, classifying the proposed scheme with a number of others in
this country and elsewhere that had operated disastrously. The committee
held the bill to be bad in substance, and unconstitutional. Upon this report
the bill was indefinitely postponed.
In January, 1891, Senator Stanford was re-elected to the Senate for a
second term of six years, and be again introduced his land loan bill with
another bill placing the scheme squarely upon a gold basis. In January, 1892,
he made another and more elaborate speech in its support, at the same time
replying to the adverse report of the Finance Committee made in the previous
Congress. He was now thoroughly aroused and defended bis scheme with
great force. A Kansas Senator came to his support, and it looked as though
the bill was about to be considered on its merits, and amended so as to pro
vide against the possibility of an inflated currency. The bill was pending
in the Senate at the time of Senator Stanford's death on June 21st, 1593.
Senator Stanford Eulogized.
At the memorial exercises in the United States Senate on September 16,
1593, and in the House of Representatives on February 12, 1894, the members
of both houses paid feeling tributes to the life and character of Senator Stan
ford. The address of Senator Daniel of Virginia, in particular, was very im
pressive by reason of the eloquent and feeling personality of his remarks.
He referred to the land loan bill in terms that corresponded so nearly with
my own experience that I venture to repeat them here:â€”
"He (Senator Stanford) had some ideas which he was never able to im
press upon his associates as being practicable, among them liis idea of lend
ing vast amounts of money upon land. I have talked with him for hours and
hours upon repeated occasions on that theme, and he often urged me to adopt
his views and advocate them. I could neever see that they were practicable,
and with all my respect for him and desire to meet his wishes T could not,
of course, comply with his request. Yet let me say that beneath the difficul
ties which present themselves to such an idea as he had formed, there are
in it germs of truth and wisdom such as are found in the first evolutions of
invention, which, in a later and riper day of the world's history, may be de
veloped into much that is attainable and good. ... As the world's pop
ulation shall increase, and as financial refinements and facilities shall be
developed, there will be found in this idea much to build upon, and in the
end probably some ripe consummation."
How gracious and candid this was: This was twenty years ago. We have
experienced some squally financial times since then. The period commenced
with the panic of 1893 and included the panic of 1907: but the country has
made substantial progress in its financial system during this time, and in
the direction of Senator Stanford's scheme. This progress will be found in
the recent act of December 23, 1913, providing for reserve banks and an
elastic currency, with gold as the standard of values. Mr. Horace White,
the well known editor and financial expert, writing of this act in the North
American Review, says: â€”
"Twenty years was required to prepare public opinion, including that of
bankers and congressmen, for the adoption of asset currency in the place of
bond currency."
Judge Morrow proceeded to show that present financial legislation rests
upon the basic principle of Senator Stanford's land loan bill.
The Founding of Stanford University.
We come now to the last and most impressive and important act of Sen
ator Stanford's remarkable career, â€”the founding of this great university,
when he said, "The children of California shall be my children." In this act
we associate the name of that true and faithful companion and devoted wife,
Jane Lathrop Stanford. The founding of this university was the blending of
the pride and glory of both of their lives, in a vision of higher needs and
deeper realities. For thirty-five years they had been co-workers in all of
the affairs of life, reaching out to noble works and generous deeds. But now,
in memory of their idolized son, they lovingly united in founding this institu
tion as a perpetual memorial to his youthful ambition to better the world by
education.
In January, 1885, Senator Stanford submitted to the legislature of this
state an act to advance learning, and the arts and sciences, by providing for
the foundation and endowment within the state of universities and other
institutions of learning. This act passed both houses of the legislature and
was approved by the Governor on March 9th, 1885, â€”twenty-nine years ago
to-day. This act was general in its terms in accordance with the constitu
tional requirement, but was intended to be and was in fact the foundation
of this university. It is a happy coincidence that we commemorate the birth
of the founder, Leland Stanford, and the foundation act, on the same day.
Selection of the First President.
The seection of the first president for this university was a matter of
very serious concern with Senator and Mrs. Stanford. Their ideal of a presi
dent was as exceptional and as exalted as their ideal of the institution they
were founding; and accordingly the whole field of eligible persons was thor
oughly canvassed, and the qualifications of each carefully weighed with re
spect to the immediate work of organization, as well as ability to project the
lines of future development. It was from such a process of weighing and
sifting that the selection fell upon that distinguished scientist and able
executive, David Starr Jordan.
Senator and Mrs. Stanford were very earnest and very laborious in the
effort to frame the outline of an institution whose teachings would be of the
highest character. They believed in the value of present knowledge, but they
also believed in the value of work expended in the discovery of new truths.
They believed in teaching the student how to thread his way through the
known regions of knowledge, but they also believed in extending the boun
daries of knowledge into the unexplored; that humanity might know and
possess its inheritance. An institution to correspond to such a plan must
necessarily be a growth, the result of the slow process of evolution.
"Every true man," says Emerson, "is a cause, a country and an age;
requires infinite spaces and numbers and time fully to accomplish his design."
We look upon this university in that light, and behold it in the process
of development reflecting the spirit and purpose of its founders. We see
now the university taking its place as a force in the march of progress, ad
vancing the standards of skill and efficiency, and equipping explorers for new
fields of knowledge in the search for truth. We see it working out its des
tiny in promoting "the public welfare by exercising an influence in behalf
of humanity and civilization, teaching the blessings of liberty regulated by
law, inculcating love and reverence for the great principles of government
as derived from the inalienable rights of man to life, liberty and the pursuit
of. happiness."
We assemble here to-day to recall these works, revive the prophetic
vision of the founders; and pay our tribute of respect to the genius of the
builders who, building as they knew, built for all time.
The Founders' Day address deliv
ered this morning by Judge William
W. Morrow conies from an especially
authentic source, and constitutes the
j most elaborate memorial to Senator
Stanford yet attempted. For this
reason a desire has been expressed
that it be preserved in permanent
| form, and it is accordingly printed
almost in full.
The invitation I had the pleasure
|of receiving from the Faculty Com
: inittee to deliver the Founders' Day
address on this occasion came with
the suggestion that I should speak
from my personal knowledge of the

life and public services of Senator
Leland Stanford. The suggestion
was most acceptable, since it required
nothing more serious or exacting than
the recalling of events in the general
order of a narrative. This effort has
had a personal interest, and has
brought to my mind many interesting
associations connected with the pub
lic affairs of this state and nation, in
which Senator Stanford was a promi
nent figure, and which 1 think illus
trate in a marked degree his original
ity, courage and strength of char
acter.
My acquaintance with Leland Stan
ford covered a period of more than
thirty years, and during part of that
time my relations with him were of
such a nature that phases of his char
acter were brought under my obser
vation that made me know him as a
most unique, independent and com
manding personality.


Judge William \\. Morrow
He was born at Watervliet, New York, on March 9th, 1824 â€”ninety years
ago to-day. Watervliet is about eight miles above Albany, on the Hudson
River. Ilis father was of English stock, with Irish blood in his veins. This
was a combination from which we might expect an individual possessed of
vigorous Qualities of mind and body, coupled with courage and sound judg
ment, and balanced with a strain of quaint, happy humor. These qualities
do in fact appear to have been inherited in full vigor by the sou. The father
was a farmer, and for a time at least a railroad contractor. These parental
occupations must have given the son an early practical view of the affairs
of life and a habit of constant sell' reliance that would be likely to grow into
marked independence of judgment and will.
We start then with heredity, environment and an early experience favora
ble to the future efficiency and independence of the son, who had, moreover,
the advantage of a good, practical education. He studied law and was ad
mitted to the bar in IS4B. In that year lie yielded to the spirit of the day
and moved west to Port Washington, Wisconsin, where he practiced law. He
visited his New York home in 1850 and was there married to Miss .lane La
throp, and returned with his wife to Port Washington. In 1552 a fire de
stroyed his law library and household effects. This misfortune caused him
to consider the advantage of going still further west, and as a result he came
to California. He left his wife with her father in Albany, New York, and
reached California in July, 1552. He visited his brothers who were engaged
in a general merchandise business in Sacramento, and soon after he entered
into the same business for himself at Cold Springs, in Eldorado County. In
1853 he opened a store at Michigan Bluffs, in Placer County,a very prosperous
mining section, and lie also engaged in mining and was highly successlul.
In 1855 he purchased the business of his brothers in Sacramento and the
same year returned cast and brought Mrs. Stanford to California and estab
lished his home at Sacramento.
An Original Republican.
He was an original Republican, and with a few others organized the
Republican Party in Sacramento in 1556. All Republicans were progressives
in those days, and correspondingly fearless. Senator Cole, in his memoirs,
speaking of the Republican Party in Sacramento at that time, says: "The
party at its inception was extremely limited in numbers"; that beside him
self there were "Leland Stanford, C. P. Huntington, Mark Hopkins, Edwin B.
and Charles Crocker, and that besides these there were not for some time as
many as could be counted on one's fingers." But this small party does not
appear to have been ignored by others in the community because of its lack
of numbers. Its members were denounced as agitators, disturbers of the
peace and traitors to the country. Violence against them was resorted to
occasionally, and efforts of intimidation often. Senator Colo gives the copy
of a public notice, printed in large type and posted about the City of Sacra
mento on May 13th, 1856. It was headed, "To Arms," and called upon "all
good citizens to attend a public meeting" at a place named "to devise means
to protect the public welfare by appointing a committee to hang all the leaders
and as many of the attaches of said traitors as may be deemed necessary
to restore the public quiet and put a stop to such treasonable practices."
This notice was understood to be directed against Mr. Stanford and his asso
ciates. It was probably nothing more than a species of intimidation; but
whatever its object it could not have been highly pleasant reading for those
to whom it referred. The historian fails to give us any further information
concerning the meeting. Nobody appears to have been hung; but we are leit
to infer that this little band of agitators followed Franklin's wise advice
given to the signers of the Declaration of Indpendence. They hung together
and thus escaped being hanged separately.
I do not mention these matters to recall ancient animosities, long since
forgiven and forgotten. Mr. Stanford was himself among the first to forgive
and forget, save the humor of some of the situations, to which he sometimes
referred; but T mention these incidents to show you the man in action under
circumstances and conditions calculated to test the strength of his physical
and moral fiber, and his ability to meet the passions and turbulence of a new
community fearlessly and with perfect equanimity.
In 1857 Mr. Stanford was the Republican candidate for state treasurer;
but the party was of such recent origin that its nominations were merely
matters of form to maintain the party organization. In 1859 he was the
nominee of his party for Governor. The Democratic Party was divided. One
wing, being known as the Lecompton Party, nominated a ticket with Mr.
Latham as candidate for Governor, and the other wing, or Anti-Lecompton
Party, nominated a ticket with Judge John Curry for that office. There was
a natural tendency for the latter party to unite with the Republican Party,
as it subsequently did; but at this time there were influences at work in
favor of the Republican Party withdrawing from the field. Horace Greeley,
the editor of the New York Tribune, a man of distinction, and the foremost
Republican in the United States, arrived in California in the summer of 1559.
lie was everywhere received with the greatest enthusiasm and accorded every
consideration. Tie made a number of speeches in the state, and, regarding
himself as entitled by his position to advise Republicans as to their duty, he
proposed that they should withdraw their ticket and support the Anti-Le
compton Party.
The proposition was submitted to Mr. Stanford. His reply was charac
teristic of the man. He declined to withdraw, maintaining with firmness that
it was the duty of the Republican Party to stand by its principles whatever
the result. He preferred to go down to defeat rather than to surrender to
an opposing party the standard placed in his hands by his political friends
and supporters. He was not a mere office seeker. He was charged with the
duty of preserving the integrity of a party organization, and he would per
form that duty. Like Mr. Lincoln he would not be the last to desert. He
would not desert at all. He was defeated at the polls, but be demonstrated
to the people of the state that he was not a weak or an uncertain leader.
He was again nominated for Governor in 1861, and it was in this cam
paign that 1 first became acquainted with him. T was then located at Santa
Rosa. I was anxious to hear him, although I was not then a voter. I had
come to California two years before from the state of Illinois, where political
questions occupied the public mind to the exclusion of almost every other
subject. I had heard such public speakers as Lincoln, Douglass, Trumbull,
Browning and many others of their type. These were all rugged men of dis
tinguished ability, combined with great force of character. Coming here
from such a field of political discussion, my first impression of California
speakers was a disappointment. They seemed to me to be lacking in force
and in an understanding of national questions. I inquired for the joint de

bates between candidates, with which I had been familiar, and the keen dis
cussion of such national questions as the Missouri Compromise, the Dred
Scott decision, and the Leconipton Constitution. In Illinois the discussion
of political questions was about the only diversion the people had, and they
were accustomed to hear public speakers gifted with the force of persuasive
eloquence. It seemed to me that the California speakers did not measure up
to the standard we had in Illinois; but I was told to be patient until I heard
such speakers as Colonel E. D. Baker, Frederick P. Tracy, Thomas Starr
King, Thomas Fitch, Henry Edgerton, and other orators of repute. I soon
heard these speakers, and while they had culture of a high order, they lacked
the plain homely frontier character of the middle west. But I soon became
convinced that there were political orators in California as well as in Illinois.
Incidentally it may be said that Colonel Baker, the greatest orator of modern
times, was from Illinois and had been an associate of Mr. Lincoln. He had
been trained in the Illinois school of political discussion, and was a master
of the art. He was a soldier, orator and statesman.
While I was in this state of curiosity about the public speakers of the
state, Mr. Stanford was advertised to speak in Santa Rosa on the issues of
the day. lie was a leader of the new party, based upon a new and an untried
platform of principles. The political sentiment of that place at that time
was decidedly unfriendly to the new party and its candidates. Mr. Stanford
was received respectfully, but not enthusiastically. His personal appearance
was impressive. He was then thirty-seven years of age, large of frame, with
a swarthy complexion and something of the plain rugged features of the
frontiersman. He was dignified in manner, with a peculiarly attractive com
posure. His voice was melodious and pleasant; his language clear and ex
pressive. He was listened to by a large audience with respectful interest.
He wasted no time on immaterial questions but went directly into the issues
of the campaign. The platform of the party had declared in favor of the com
mon school system, and insisted that it should be sustained in all of its es
sential features, and its benefits and efficiency extended. The platform also
declared in favor of distributing the public lands of the United States to
homestead settlers, and pledged the party to aid the immediate construction
of a transcontinental railroad. The platform declared further that the Re
publicans of California pledged themselves, and all they had, to sustain the
national administration at Washington. Mr. Lincoln had been elected in the
previous November, and on the fourth of March had been inaugurated Presi
dent. Mr. Stanford had been a delegate from California to the National Re
publican Convention that had placed Mr. Lincoln in nomination, and had ad
vocated his election. He was the President's friend and adviser, and the two
men had much that was in common.
In Mr. Stanford's speech on the occasion to which I refer, he discussed
the platform of the party and declared his adherence to its principles. He
spoke with the eloquence of an honest conviction. He believed that the public
school system was at the very foundation of our form of government; that
the public domain should be given freely to actual settlers for the building
of homes; that the Pacific Railroad should be built at the earliest possible
moment that the people of the Pacific Coast might have quick and ample com
munication with the east. He declared that he was doing and would continue
to do what he could to further the project; and in concluding he paid a
splendid and feeling tribute to the high character and patriotism of Mr. Lin
coln, and his administration, and its purpose to maintain the perpetuity of
the Union.
Elected Governor of California.
It is difficult now to understand how any of these questions could have
ever been a subject of serious discussion; but they were, and the discussions
were vigorous, sometimes violent. Mr. Stanford presented them in an able
and fearless manner in all of the principal localities of the state. He gained
the confidence of the people by his plain, straightforward speech and man
ner, and was elected by a large plurality. His term of office was for two
years. Having become president of the Central Pacific Railroad, then in
course of construction, he declined a renomination. During his term of
office as governor he gave the state a wise and an efficient administration
and was counted one of the "War Governors" of the nation, taking a place in
support of the national cause along side of such governors as Andrews of
Massachusetts, Washburn of Maine, Morgan of New York, Curtin of Penn
sylvania, Morton of Indiana, Yates of Illinois and Kirkwood of lowa.
In June, 1861, and ten days after Mr. Stanford had been nominated for
Governor, he and a few other citizens of Sacramento organized and incor
porated the Central Pacific Railroad Company, under the laws of the State
of California, with Mr. Stanford as the president of the corporation. Con
gress had not then passed the act to aid in the construction of the railroad
and telegraph line from the Missouri River to the Pacific Ocean. That act
was not passed until July Ist, 1562. It organized the Union Pacific Railroad
Company with an imposing array of stockholders, to build a railroad west
from the Missouri River to a connection with the Central Pacific Railroad of
California. Mr. Stanford's associates were not so conspicuous, but they were
men of ability and character. Among them were Theodore D. .ludah, a dis
tinguished engineer, C. P. Huntington, Mark Hopkins and Charles Crocker,
merchants of Sacramento. There were a few others, but these were the men
who afterwards became known in the construction of the road, and in the
affairs of the state and nation in connection with this enterprise.
The object of the corporation which these men formed was to construct
a railroad from Sacramento eastward on the line of the proposed transcon
tinental railroad, and on January Bth, 1563, Governor Stanford turned the
first spadeful of earth in Sacramento for its construction. At that time the
only railroads in the state were a short line from Sacramento to Polsom, a
distance of about twenty miles, and a partly constructed railroad from San
Francisco to San Jose. The construction of these two short lines had been
very-expensive, and were in fact a warning against the prosecution of an
other such enterprise at that time. Railroad iron, locomotives and other
rolling stock had to be brought from the east around the Horn in sailing
vessels; and the cost of all kinds of material was very high, and labor dear
and scarce.
Judge Morrow at this point eloquently told the graphic narrative of the
building of the Central Pacific railroad, showing the indomitable will with
which its construction was pushed forward. He discussed the incorporation
of the Southern Pacific and threatened competition from the Atlantic and
Pacific and Texas and Pacific roads, and continued:
In this way Governor Stanford and his associates met and blocked these
two roads coming from the east at the boundary line of the state, one tempo
rarily and the other permanently. The Atlantic and Pacific subsequently
purchased the Southern Pacific line from Mohave to the Needles, and the
Santa Fe, its successor, finally reached the Bay of San Francisco by an inde
pendent terminal at Point Richmond. The Texas Pacific railroad never
reached the Colorado River, but the Southern Pacific, building eastward from
Yuma, pushed on across Arizona and New Mexico, and met the Texas Pacific
at the Rio Grande, near El Paso, in the State of Texas.
Under another act of Congress passed in 1566, the Central Pacific rail
road, under the name of the California and Oregon railroad, was authorized
to build northward toward the Oregon lino to connect with another railroad
coming south from Portland, Oregon. This line was built and a road opened
to Portland.
Governor Stanford and his associates also acquired control of short lines
by which they reached the Bay of San Francisco from the Sacramento and
San Joaquin Valleys. They also built a line down the coast; and with all
these lines, connections and terminals they secured substantial control of
the transportation facilities of the state, and in 1885 they merged all of these
railroads under the control of the Southern Pacific Company.
I mention these matters to show with what determination, force and
ability these men pushed forward against formidable opposition, and in the
fact of difficulties obtained the substantial control of the transportation facili
ties of the state. It has been said that others could have done the same thing
with the same assistance in national bonds, land grants and other contribu
tions. The fact remains that others, with like opportunities, did not make
the effort, and that others failed, with the same opportunities, to carry to
successful completion, corresponding enterprises. Every transcontinental
railroad coming westward toward the coast, and with which the Central Pa
cific railroad or the Southern Pacific railroad was authorized to connect,
failed at one time or another to meet their financial obligations, and were
placed by the courts in the hands of receivers. Comparisons are odious, and
however tempting this one may be, it will not be carried further.
But it is a fair question to ask: What have been the financial operations
of the corporations involved in the Southern Pacific System? Have any of
these failed to meet their obligations? Have any of them been in the hands
of receivers? AVe find 110 such records. They appear to have paid their debts
at maturity, including the bonded debt and interest due to the United States
by the Central Pacific. Perhaps some credit may be due to Governor Stan
ford and his associates for so having managed these properties that all the
corporations under their control have maintained their financial integrity
from the first spadeful of earth turned 011 the Bth day of January, 1863, down
to the present time.
During all this time of construction, Governor Stanford continued at the
head of the corporations incorporated into this one controlling system. The
people and press of the state protested, and charged that a grasping monop
oly had been formed to appropriate the transportation facilities of the state.
It was insisted that competitive transcontinental lines should be admitted
into tlie state and competition in freight and passen&ei lates seemed.
Governor Stanford and his associates proceeded upon the theory that
whatever monopoly there was in the Southern Pacific system was for the
best interests of the state; that what the state needed was the development
of its extensive and valuable resources, and that to do this it was impera
tive that railroad transportation be extended to all points of the state where
business would justify it, either presently or prospectively; that one cor
poration or one system, witli its connecting lines and terminals, could do
this better and cheaper than several; that additional transcontinental lines
would not be competitive, and would not confer the benefits that were ex
pected by the public.
During the time Governor Stanford and his associates continued in con
trol of the Southern Pacific System they never wavered in their adherence
to this policy Neither did the press nor the public, until very recently,
abandon their opposition to that policy. The Santa Pc came into the state as
a competing road for business, but not with respect to rates foi fi eight and
fares, which now became matters for the Interstate Commerce Commission
and the State Railroad Commission.
This question of railroad competition now comes up 111 a legal aspect.
The Federal Government had submitted to the courts the question whether
the merging of the Central Pacific and its terminals, into the Southern Pa
cific System, is a monopoly in restraint of trade and commerce in violation
of the Sherman Anti-trust Law. This action 011 the part of the government
is now being vigorously resisted by substantially the entiic business inteiesls
of the state, upon the ground that the merging of these connecting lines and
terminal facilities twenty-nine years ago was for the best interests of the
people of this state, and is so now. The farseeing policy that constructed
this system is now approved by the public, and the policy ot Goveinoi Stan
ford and his associates in extending and developing the Southern Pacific
System from ISGS to 18S5 is now the declared policy of the people of the state
of California in dealing with this transcontinental transportation question.
Upon the legal question I express no opinion, but upon the question of policy
I have the opinion of a citizen that the present situation should not be
disturbed.
All Advocnte of Educational Legislation.
I come now to a period of a very different character, when my relations
with Governor Stanford became official, personal and in some respects quite
intimate. In January, ISBS, Governor Stanford was elected by the legislature
of the state to the United States Senate for the term of six years commencing
on March 4, 18S5. I had been elected in November, 18S4, to the House of
Representatives from the San Francisco District, for the term of two years
commencing also 011 March 4, 1885. By reelection I served six years in the
House of Representatives, from 1885 to 1891.
During this time it was customary for Senator Stanford to have frequent
conferences at his house with the California members of the House of Repre
sentatives concerning California matters. These conferences were nearly
always interesting, and sometimes amusing,â€”interesting because they either
related to some matter of legislation before Congress, or something pending
before one or more of the departments in which important interests of the
state were concerned, â€”amusing because of the extraordinary demands made
upon the Senators and members of Congress by their constituents, â€”from
turnip seeds and popcorn to patents for nutmeg graters and flying machines.
We speak of public officials as public servants, but we never use that term
with so much accuracy and feeling as when we apply it to Senators or Repre
sentatives in Congress. They are public servants, practically as well as
theoretically, with only one substantial privilege at their service,â€”and that
is to make speeches in the Congressional Record and send them free through
the mail to their constituents. Senator Stanford never availed himself of
this privilege. He was an efficient, conscientious public servant, performing
all his duties faithfully and cheerfully. He never complained of the burden
of small and often trifling demands.
One of the first subjects of national importance to engage his attention
was that of education, in which he was deeply interested. A bill had been
introduced in Congress by Senator Blair of New Hampshire to aid in the
establishment and temporary support of the common schools. The bill pro
vided for the distribution of seventy-seven millions of dollars among the
several states and territories in proportion to the illiteracy in each state or
territory. The distribution was to be in installments covering a period of
eight years. The bill was fully discussed by the leading senators. In the
course of the debate, on February 25, 1890, Senator Stanford delivered a
speech in support of the bill in which he said some pertinent things about
education: â€”
"In my opinion." said he, "our government can have no higher object
than to secure to the people a high degree of intelligence, thereby assisting
them to the attainment of the possibilities of humanity. Those possibilities
and the beneficence of the Creator to man on earth are one and the same,
for it is obvious that there could be no beneficence in the unattainable. Had
we been given reasonable wants without the means of gratifying them, the
Creator's beneficence would be a failure.
"But when we look around at the sources of supply for our wants,
whether physical or intellectual, we find them inexhaustibly supplied in the
soil, waters, forests, mines and quarries. The raw material is everywhere
within our reach, requiring only the intelligent application of labor and the
control of the forces of nature. How this labor is to be supplied, and this
control obtained, is what education will teach."
He believed in education of the masses, and he particularly favored the

bill then under consideration because it provided for the education of both
sexes alike for their respective callings. He believed in the early education
of the child for the moral influence it would have in forming his character
and in laying the foundation for his future efficiency. He believed in educat
ing all classes for the active duties of life, and for the deeper insight it gave
into nature, and the greater knowledge of her wonderful forces, which, being
understood, developed and brought under control, would enable humanity to
realize the glorious destiny marked out for it by the Creator.
The bill which he was then supporting was defeated, mainly, as I recall,
on constitutional grounds. But he supported other educational bills which
became laws, notably bills in aid of state agricultural colleges, providing for
experimental stations, and a more thorough training in agricultural pursuits.
He was himself an agriculturalist on a large scale, and with his extensive
land holdings he naturally took a practical interest in the industry. But his
interest was much more than personal. He viewed the production of the soil
from the standpoint of the nation's welfare, and believed that the nation might
increase its wealth enormously by the introduction of intelligent, economical
methods.
A Pioneer Advocate of Land Loan Laws.
He accordingly proposed a scheme for government loans on real estate,
which should have the double purpose of furnishing the country with an
elastic currency of sufficient volume to meet its requirements, and at the
same time supply the farmer with money at a low rate of interest to meet
the necessities of his calling, and make agriculture profitable and attractive.
The scheme was a bold one, but it was one in which Senator Stanford had the
utmost confidence, and he was astonished that it did not receive general ap
proval. I think the greatest disappointment he suffered during his senatorial
career was his failure to secure any general support for this bill.
In view of recent legislation, it would seem that his failure was due
mainly to the fact that he was at least twenty years in advance of the times.
Senator Stanford was essentially a progressive, and he was generally a
pioneer in whatever he undertook, whether it was the formation of a political
party, building a railroad, developing some new industry, or founding a Uni
versity. He could see well into the future, and he usually saw his efforts
successful; but in this instance lie did not see his scheme adopted. Now,
I am not going to discuss this financial question in any great detail. Mr.
Gladstone is reported to have said in a debate in the British House of Com
mons concerning some financial measure before it, that there were two roads
rÂ»ilroad timetable, and the other was the study of the principles of banking
and currency. For your sakes as well as for my own, I shall touch but lightly
upon this financial question.
But a few words of explanation are necessary to understand the full
scope and purposes of Senator Stanford's scheme: â€”
The speaker now explained the scope and purpose of Senator Stanford's
scheme, and the financial situation preceding the panic of 1893.
While this financial storm was brewing, Senator Stanford brought for
ward his land loan scheme. He first introduced a resolution in the Senate,
on March 10th, 1890, instructing the finance committee of that body to report
what relief might be provided by the United States government for the strin
gency in the money market, and particularly whether loans might be made
by the government upon mortgages. This resolution failed to receive any
consideration. On May 20th, IS9O, he introduced a bill entitled, "A bill to
provide the government with means sufficient to supply the national govern
ment with a sound circulating medium." This bill provided that the treasurer
of the United States should cause to be printed notes of the United States
to the amount of one hundred millions of dollars, and such additional amounts
from time to time as should be necessary to meet the requirements of the
act. These notes were to be a legal tender for all private and certain public
debts, and were to be loaned on unincumbered agricultural land upon interest
at the rate of two per cent per annum. A loan was not to exceed one half
of the assessed value of the land and for a term of not to exceed twenty
years. No loan was to be for a sum less than $250. The bill provided for a
bureau in the treasury department to administer the provisions of the act.
A few days after the introduction of this bill Senator Stanford made a
speech in its support in which he explained its provisions, and contended
that the plan of loaning money upon land at two per cent, with the privilege
to the borrower of returning it when he had no use for it, would create a
money system that would meet financial expansions and contractions as they
might occur. He did not claim, however, that his bill had been perfected in
detail. What he did claim was that the principle of loaning the credit of
the nation upon sufficient security, to those who needed it, should be ex
tended to the farmers on the security of real estate as had already been done
to the national banks on the security of United States bonds, and that the
financial condition of the country urgently required legislation to that end.
The bill was referred to the Senate Committee on Finance. That committee,
composed it must be said, of able and experienced statesmen, reported on
tfc bill adversely, classifying the proposed scheme with a number of others in
this country and elsewhere that had operated disastrously. The committee
held the bill to be bad in substance, and unconstitutional. Upon this report
the bill was indefinitely postponed.
In January, 1891, Senator Stanford was re-elected to the Senate for a
second term of six years, and be again introduced his land loan bill with
another bill placing the scheme squarely upon a gold basis. In January, 1892,
he made another and more elaborate speech in its support, at the same time
replying to the adverse report of the Finance Committee made in the previous
Congress. He was now thoroughly aroused and defended bis scheme with
great force. A Kansas Senator came to his support, and it looked as though
the bill was about to be considered on its merits, and amended so as to pro
vide against the possibility of an inflated currency. The bill was pending
in the Senate at the time of Senator Stanford's death on June 21st, 1593.
Senator Stanford Eulogized.
At the memorial exercises in the United States Senate on September 16,
1593, and in the House of Representatives on February 12, 1894, the members
of both houses paid feeling tributes to the life and character of Senator Stan
ford. The address of Senator Daniel of Virginia, in particular, was very im
pressive by reason of the eloquent and feeling personality of his remarks.
He referred to the land loan bill in terms that corresponded so nearly with
my own experience that I venture to repeat them here:â€”
"He (Senator Stanford) had some ideas which he was never able to im
press upon his associates as being practicable, among them liis idea of lend
ing vast amounts of money upon land. I have talked with him for hours and
hours upon repeated occasions on that theme, and he often urged me to adopt
his views and advocate them. I could neever see that they were practicable,
and with all my respect for him and desire to meet his wishes T could not,
of course, comply with his request. Yet let me say that beneath the difficul
ties which present themselves to such an idea as he had formed, there are
in it germs of truth and wisdom such as are found in the first evolutions of
invention, which, in a later and riper day of the world's history, may be de
veloped into much that is attainable and good. ... As the world's pop
ulation shall increase, and as financial refinements and facilities shall be
developed, there will be found in this idea much to build upon, and in the
end probably some ripe consummation."
How gracious and candid this was: This was twenty years ago. We have
experienced some squally financial times since then. The period commenced
with the panic of 1893 and included the panic of 1907: but the country has
made substantial progress in its financial system during this time, and in
the direction of Senator Stanford's scheme. This progress will be found in
the recent act of December 23, 1913, providing for reserve banks and an
elastic currency, with gold as the standard of values. Mr. Horace White,
the well known editor and financial expert, writing of this act in the North
American Review, says: â€”
"Twenty years was required to prepare public opinion, including that of
bankers and congressmen, for the adoption of asset currency in the place of
bond currency."
Judge Morrow proceeded to show that present financial legislation rests
upon the basic principle of Senator Stanford's land loan bill.
The Founding of Stanford University.
We come now to the last and most impressive and important act of Sen
ator Stanford's remarkable career, â€”the founding of this great university,
when he said, "The children of California shall be my children." In this act
we associate the name of that true and faithful companion and devoted wife,
Jane Lathrop Stanford. The founding of this university was the blending of
the pride and glory of both of their lives, in a vision of higher needs and
deeper realities. For thirty-five years they had been co-workers in all of
the affairs of life, reaching out to noble works and generous deeds. But now,
in memory of their idolized son, they lovingly united in founding this institu
tion as a perpetual memorial to his youthful ambition to better the world by
education.
In January, 1885, Senator Stanford submitted to the legislature of this
state an act to advance learning, and the arts and sciences, by providing for
the foundation and endowment within the state of universities and other
institutions of learning. This act passed both houses of the legislature and
was approved by the Governor on March 9th, 1885, â€”twenty-nine years ago
to-day. This act was general in its terms in accordance with the constitu
tional requirement, but was intended to be and was in fact the foundation
of this university. It is a happy coincidence that we commemorate the birth
of the founder, Leland Stanford, and the foundation act, on the same day.
Selection of the First President.
The seection of the first president for this university was a matter of
very serious concern with Senator and Mrs. Stanford. Their ideal of a presi
dent was as exceptional and as exalted as their ideal of the institution they
were founding; and accordingly the whole field of eligible persons was thor
oughly canvassed, and the qualifications of each carefully weighed with re
spect to the immediate work of organization, as well as ability to project the
lines of future development. It was from such a process of weighing and
sifting that the selection fell upon that distinguished scientist and able
executive, David Starr Jordan.
Senator and Mrs. Stanford were very earnest and very laborious in the
effort to frame the outline of an institution whose teachings would be of the
highest character. They believed in the value of present knowledge, but they
also believed in the value of work expended in the discovery of new truths.
They believed in teaching the student how to thread his way through the
known regions of knowledge, but they also believed in extending the boun
daries of knowledge into the unexplored; that humanity might know and
possess its inheritance. An institution to correspond to such a plan must
necessarily be a growth, the result of the slow process of evolution.
"Every true man," says Emerson, "is a cause, a country and an age;
requires infinite spaces and numbers and time fully to accomplish his design."
We look upon this university in that light, and behold it in the process
of development reflecting the spirit and purpose of its founders. We see
now the university taking its place as a force in the march of progress, ad
vancing the standards of skill and efficiency, and equipping explorers for new
fields of knowledge in the search for truth. We see it working out its des
tiny in promoting "the public welfare by exercising an influence in behalf
of humanity and civilization, teaching the blessings of liberty regulated by
law, inculcating love and reverence for the great principles of government
as derived from the inalienable rights of man to life, liberty and the pursuit
of. happiness."
We assemble here to-day to recall these works, revive the prophetic
vision of the founders; and pay our tribute of respect to the genius of the
builders who, building as they knew, built for all time.
The Founders' Day address deliv
ered this morning by Judge William
W. Morrow conies from an especially
authentic source, and constitutes the
j most elaborate memorial to Senator
Stanford yet attempted. For this
reason a desire has been expressed
that it be preserved in permanent
| form, and it is accordingly printed
almost in full.
The invitation I had the pleasure
|of receiving from the Faculty Com
: inittee to deliver the Founders' Day
address on this occasion came with
the suggestion that I should speak
from my personal knowledge of the

life and public services of Senator
Leland Stanford. The suggestion
was most acceptable, since it required
nothing more serious or exacting than
the recalling of events in the general
order of a narrative. This effort has
had a personal interest, and has
brought to my mind many interesting
associations connected with the pub
lic affairs of this state and nation, in
which Senator Stanford was a promi
nent figure, and which 1 think illus
trate in a marked degree his original
ity, courage and strength of char
acter.
My acquaintance with Leland Stan
ford covered a period of more than
thirty years, and during part of that
time my relations with him were of
such a nature that phases of his char
acter were brought under my obser
vation that made me know him as a
most unique, independent and com
manding personality.


Judge William \\. Morrow
He was born at Watervliet, New York, on March 9th, 1824 â€”ninety years
ago to-day. Watervliet is about eight miles above Albany, on the Hudson
River. Ilis father was of English stock, with Irish blood in his veins. This
was a combination from which we might expect an individual possessed of
vigorous Qualities of mind and body, coupled with courage and sound judg
ment, and balanced with a strain of quaint, happy humor. These qualities
do in fact appear to have been inherited in full vigor by the sou. The father
was a farmer, and for a time at least a railroad contractor. These parental
occupations must have given the son an early practical view of the affairs
of life and a habit of constant sell' reliance that would be likely to grow into
marked independence of judgment and will.
We start then with heredity, environment and an early experience favora
ble to the future efficiency and independence of the son, who had, moreover,
the advantage of a good, practical education. He studied law and was ad
mitted to the bar in IS4B. In that year lie yielded to the spirit of the day
and moved west to Port Washington, Wisconsin, where he practiced law. He
visited his New York home in 1850 and was there married to Miss .lane La
throp, and returned with his wife to Port Washington. In 1552 a fire de
stroyed his law library and household effects. This misfortune caused him
to consider the advantage of going still further west, and as a result he came
to California. He left his wife with her father in Albany, New York, and
reached California in July, 1552. He visited his brothers who were engaged
in a general merchandise business in Sacramento, and soon after he entered
into the same business for himself at Cold Springs, in Eldorado County. In
1853 he opened a store at Michigan Bluffs, in Placer County,a very prosperous
mining section, and lie also engaged in mining and was highly successlul.
In 1855 he purchased the business of his brothers in Sacramento and the
same year returned cast and brought Mrs. Stanford to California and estab
lished his home at Sacramento.
An Original Republican.
He was an original Republican, and with a few others organized the
Republican Party in Sacramento in 1556. All Republicans were progressives
in those days, and correspondingly fearless. Senator Cole, in his memoirs,
speaking of the Republican Party in Sacramento at that time, says: "The
party at its inception was extremely limited in numbers"; that beside him
self there were "Leland Stanford, C. P. Huntington, Mark Hopkins, Edwin B.
and Charles Crocker, and that besides these there were not for some time as
many as could be counted on one's fingers." But this small party does not
appear to have been ignored by others in the community because of its lack
of numbers. Its members were denounced as agitators, disturbers of the
peace and traitors to the country. Violence against them was resorted to
occasionally, and efforts of intimidation often. Senator Colo gives the copy
of a public notice, printed in large type and posted about the City of Sacra
mento on May 13th, 1856. It was headed, "To Arms," and called upon "all
good citizens to attend a public meeting" at a place named "to devise means
to protect the public welfare by appointing a committee to hang all the leaders
and as many of the attaches of said traitors as may be deemed necessary
to restore the public quiet and put a stop to such treasonable practices."
This notice was understood to be directed against Mr. Stanford and his asso
ciates. It was probably nothing more than a species of intimidation; but
whatever its object it could not have been highly pleasant reading for those
to whom it referred. The historian fails to give us any further information
concerning the meeting. Nobody appears to have been hung; but we are leit
to infer that this little band of agitators followed Franklin's wise advice
given to the signers of the Declaration of Indpendence. They hung together
and thus escaped being hanged separately.
I do not mention these matters to recall ancient animosities, long since
forgiven and forgotten. Mr. Stanford was himself among the first to forgive
and forget, save the humor of some of the situations, to which he sometimes
referred; but T mention these incidents to show you the man in action under
circumstances and conditions calculated to test the strength of his physical
and moral fiber, and his ability to meet the passions and turbulence of a new
community fearlessly and with perfect equanimity.
In 1857 Mr. Stanford was the Republican candidate for state treasurer;
but the party was of such recent origin that its nominations were merely
matters of form to maintain the party organization. In 1859 he was the
nominee of his party for Governor. The Democratic Party was divided. One
wing, being known as the Lecompton Party, nominated a ticket with Mr.
Latham as candidate for Governor, and the other wing, or Anti-Lecompton
Party, nominated a ticket with Judge John Curry for that office. There was
a natural tendency for the latter party to unite with the Republican Party,
as it subsequently did; but at this time there were influences at work in
favor of the Republican Party withdrawing from the field. Horace Greeley,
the editor of the New York Tribune, a man of distinction, and the foremost
Republican in the United States, arrived in California in the summer of 1559.
lie was everywhere received with the greatest enthusiasm and accorded every
consideration. Tie made a number of speeches in the state, and, regarding
himself as entitled by his position to advise Republicans as to their duty, he
proposed that they should withdraw their ticket and support the Anti-Le
compton Party.
The proposition was submitted to Mr. Stanford. His reply was charac
teristic of the man. He declined to withdraw, maintaining with firmness that
it was the duty of the Republican Party to stand by its principles whatever
the result. He preferred to go down to defeat rather than to surrender to
an opposing party the standard placed in his hands by his political friends
and supporters. He was not a mere office seeker. He was charged with the
duty of preserving the integrity of a party organization, and he would per
form that duty. Like Mr. Lincoln he would not be the last to desert. He
would not desert at all. He was defeated at the polls, but be demonstrated
to the people of the state that he was not a weak or an uncertain leader.
He was again nominated for Governor in 1861, and it was in this cam
paign that 1 first became acquainted with him. T was then located at Santa
Rosa. I was anxious to hear him, although I was not then a voter. I had
come to California two years before from the state of Illinois, where political
questions occupied the public mind to the exclusion of almost every other
subject. I had heard such public speakers as Lincoln, Douglass, Trumbull,
Browning and many others of their type. These were all rugged men of dis
tinguished ability, combined with great force of character. Coming here
from such a field of political discussion, my first impression of California
speakers was a disappointment. They seemed to me to be lacking in force
and in an understanding of national questions. I inquired for the joint de

bates between candidates, with which I had been familiar, and the keen dis
cussion of such national questions as the Missouri Compromise, the Dred
Scott decision, and the Leconipton Constitution. In Illinois the discussion
of political questions was about the only diversion the people had, and they
were accustomed to hear public speakers gifted with the force of persuasive
eloquence. It seemed to me that the California speakers did not measure up
to the standard we had in Illinois; but I was told to be patient until I heard
such speakers as Colonel E. D. Baker, Frederick P. Tracy, Thomas Starr
King, Thomas Fitch, Henry Edgerton, and other orators of repute. I soon
heard these speakers, and while they had culture of a high order, they lacked
the plain homely frontier character of the middle west. But I soon became
convinced that there were political orators in California as well as in Illinois.
Incidentally it may be said that Colonel Baker, the greatest orator of modern
times, was from Illinois and had been an associate of Mr. Lincoln. He had
been trained in the Illinois school of political discussion, and was a master
of the art. He was a soldier, orator and statesman.
While I was in this state of curiosity about the public speakers of the
state, Mr. Stanford was advertised to speak in Santa Rosa on the issues of
the day. lie was a leader of the new party, based upon a new and an untried
platform of principles. The political sentiment of that place at that time
was decidedly unfriendly to the new party and its candidates. Mr. Stanford
was received respectfully, but not enthusiastically. His personal appearance
was impressive. He was then thirty-seven years of age, large of frame, with
a swarthy complexion and something of the plain rugged features of the
frontiersman. He was dignified in manner, with a peculiarly attractive com
posure. His voice was melodious and pleasant; his language clear and ex
pressive. He was listened to by a large audience with respectful interest.
He wasted no time on immaterial questions but went directly into the issues
of the campaign. The platform of the party had declared in favor of the com
mon school system, and insisted that it should be sustained in all of its es
sential features, and its benefits and efficiency extended. The platform also
declared in favor of distributing the public lands of the United States to
homestead settlers, and pledged the party to aid the immediate construction
of a transcontinental railroad. The platform declared further that the Re
publicans of California pledged themselves, and all they had, to sustain the
national administration at Washington. Mr. Lincoln had been elected in the
previous November, and on the fourth of March had been inaugurated Presi
dent. Mr. Stanford had been a delegate from California to the National Re
publican Convention that had placed Mr. Lincoln in nomination, and had ad
vocated his election. He was the President's friend and adviser, and the two
men had much that was in common.
In Mr. Stanford's speech on the occasion to which I refer, he discussed
the platform of the party and declared his adherence to its principles. He
spoke with the eloquence of an honest conviction. He believed that the public
school system was at the very foundation of our form of government; that
the public domain should be given freely to actual settlers for the building
of homes; that the Pacific Railroad should be built at the earliest possible
moment that the people of the Pacific Coast might have quick and ample com
munication with the east. He declared that he was doing and would continue
to do what he could to further the project; and in concluding he paid a
splendid and feeling tribute to the high character and patriotism of Mr. Lin
coln, and his administration, and its purpose to maintain the perpetuity of
the Union.
Elected Governor of California.
It is difficult now to understand how any of these questions could have
ever been a subject of serious discussion; but they were, and the discussions
were vigorous, sometimes violent. Mr. Stanford presented them in an able
and fearless manner in all of the principal localities of the state. He gained
the confidence of the people by his plain, straightforward speech and man
ner, and was elected by a large plurality. His term of office was for two
years. Having become president of the Central Pacific Railroad, then in
course of construction, he declined a renomination. During his term of
office as governor he gave the state a wise and an efficient administration
and was counted one of the "War Governors" of the nation, taking a place in
support of the national cause along side of such governors as Andrews of
Massachusetts, Washburn of Maine, Morgan of New York, Curtin of Penn
sylvania, Morton of Indiana, Yates of Illinois and Kirkwood of lowa.
In June, 1861, and ten days after Mr. Stanford had been nominated for
Governor, he and a few other citizens of Sacramento organized and incor
porated the Central Pacific Railroad Company, under the laws of the State
of California, with Mr. Stanford as the president of the corporation. Con
gress had not then passed the act to aid in the construction of the railroad
and telegraph line from the Missouri River to the Pacific Ocean. That act
was not passed until July Ist, 1562. It organized the Union Pacific Railroad
Company with an imposing array of stockholders, to build a railroad west
from the Missouri River to a connection with the Central Pacific Railroad of
California. Mr. Stanford's associates were not so conspicuous, but they were
men of ability and character. Among them were Theodore D. .ludah, a dis
tinguished engineer, C. P. Huntington, Mark Hopkins and Charles Crocker,
merchants of Sacramento. There were a few others, but these were the men
who afterwards became known in the construction of the road, and in the
affairs of the state and nation in connection with this enterprise.
The object of the corporation which these men formed was to construct
a railroad from Sacramento eastward on the line of the proposed transcon
tinental railroad, and on January Bth, 1563, Governor Stanford turned the
first spadeful of earth in Sacramento for its construction. At that time the
only railroads in the state were a short line from Sacramento to Polsom, a
distance of about twenty miles, and a partly constructed railroad from San
Francisco to San Jose. The construction of these two short lines had been
very-expensive, and were in fact a warning against the prosecution of an
other such enterprise at that time. Railroad iron, locomotives and other
rolling stock had to be brought from the east around the Horn in sailing
vessels; and the cost of all kinds of material was very high, and labor dear
and scarce.
Judge Morrow at this point eloquently told the graphic narrative of the
building of the Central Pacific railroad, showing the indomitable will with
which its construction was pushed forward. He discussed the incorporation
of the Southern Pacific and threatened competition from the Atlantic and
Pacific and Texas and Pacific roads, and continued:
In this way Governor Stanford and his associates met and blocked these
two roads coming from the east at the boundary line of the state, one tempo
rarily and the other permanently. The Atlantic and Pacific subsequently
purchased the Southern Pacific line from Mohave to the Needles, and the
Santa Fe, its successor, finally reached the Bay of San Francisco by an inde
pendent terminal at Point Richmond. The Texas Pacific railroad never
reached the Colorado River, but the Southern Pacific, building eastward from
Yuma, pushed on across Arizona and New Mexico, and met the Texas Pacific
at the Rio Grande, near El Paso, in the State of Texas.
Under another act of Congress passed in 1566, the Central Pacific rail
road, under the name of the California and Oregon railroad, was authorized
to build northward toward the Oregon lino to connect with another railroad
coming south from Portland, Oregon. This line was built and a road opened
to Portland.
Governor Stanford and his associates also acquired control of short lines
by which they reached the Bay of San Francisco from the Sacramento and
San Joaquin Valleys. They also built a line down the coast; and with all
these lines, connections and terminals they secured substantial control of
the transportation facilities of the state, and in 1885 they merged all of these
railroads under the control of the Southern Pacific Company.
I mention these matters to show with what determination, force and
ability these men pushed forward against formidable opposition, and in the
fact of difficulties obtained the substantial control of the transportation facili
ties of the state. It has been said that others could have done the same thing
with the same assistance in national bonds, land grants and other contribu
tions. The fact remains that others, with like opportunities, did not make
the effort, and that others failed, with the same opportunities, to carry to
successful completion, corresponding enterprises. Every transcontinental
railroad coming westward toward the coast, and with which the Central Pa
cific railroad or the Southern Pacific railroad was authorized to connect,
failed at one time or another to meet their financial obligations, and were
placed by the courts in the hands of receivers. Comparisons are odious, and
however tempting this one may be, it will not be carried further.
But it is a fair question to ask: What have been the financial operations
of the corporations involved in the Southern Pacific System? Have any of
these failed to meet their obligations? Have any of them been in the hands
of receivers? AVe find 110 such records. They appear to have paid their debts
at maturity, including the bonded debt and interest due to the United States
by the Central Pacific. Perhaps some credit may be due to Governor Stan
ford and his associates for so having managed these properties that all the
corporations under their control have maintained their financial integrity
from the first spadeful of earth turned 011 the Bth day of January, 1863, down
to the present time.
During all this time of construction, Governor Stanford continued at the
head of the corporations incorporated into this one controlling system. The
people and press of the state protested, and charged that a grasping monop
oly had been formed to appropriate the transportation facilities of the state.
It was insisted that competitive transcontinental lines should be admitted
into tlie state and competition in freight and passen&ei lates seemed.
Governor Stanford and his associates proceeded upon the theory that
whatever monopoly there was in the Southern Pacific system was for the
best interests of the state; that what the state needed was the development
of its extensive and valuable resources, and that to do this it was impera
tive that railroad transportation be extended to all points of the state where
business would justify it, either presently or prospectively; that one cor
poration or one system, witli its connecting lines and terminals, could do
this better and cheaper than several; that additional transcontinental lines
would not be competitive, and would not confer the benefits that were ex
pected by the public.
During the time Governor Stanford and his associates continued in con
trol of the Southern Pacific System they never wavered in their adherence
to this policy Neither did the press nor the public, until very recently,
abandon their opposition to that policy. The Santa Pc came into the state as
a competing road for business, but not with respect to rates foi fi eight and
fares, which now became matters for the Interstate Commerce Commission
and the State Railroad Commission.
This question of railroad competition now comes up 111 a legal aspect.
The Federal Government had submitted to the courts the question whether
the merging of the Central Pacific and its terminals, into the Southern Pa
cific System, is a monopoly in restraint of trade and commerce in violation
of the Sherman Anti-trust Law. This action 011 the part of the government
is now being vigorously resisted by substantially the entiic business inteiesls
of the state, upon the ground that the merging of these connecting lines and
terminal facilities twenty-nine years ago was for the best interests of the
people of this state, and is so now. The farseeing policy that constructed
this system is now approved by the public, and the policy ot Goveinoi Stan
ford and his associates in extending and developing the Southern Pacific
System from ISGS to 18S5 is now the declared policy of the people of the state
of California in dealing with this transcontinental transportation question.
Upon the legal question I express no opinion, but upon the question of policy
I have the opinion of a citizen that the present situation should not be
disturbed.
All Advocnte of Educational Legislation.
I come now to a period of a very different character, when my relations
with Governor Stanford became official, personal and in some respects quite
intimate. In January, ISBS, Governor Stanford was elected by the legislature
of the state to the United States Senate for the term of six years commencing
on March 4, 18S5. I had been elected in November, 18S4, to the House of
Representatives from the San Francisco District, for the term of two years
commencing also 011 March 4, 1885. By reelection I served six years in the
House of Representatives, from 1885 to 1891.
During this time it was customary for Senator Stanford to have frequent
conferences at his house with the California members of the House of Repre
sentatives concerning California matters. These conferences were nearly
always interesting, and sometimes amusing,â€”interesting because they either
related to some matter of legislation before Congress, or something pending
before one or more of the departments in which important interests of the
state were concerned, â€”amusing because of the extraordinary demands made
upon the Senators and members of Congress by their constituents, â€”from
turnip seeds and popcorn to patents for nutmeg graters and flying machines.
We speak of public officials as public servants, but we never use that term
with so much accuracy and feeling as when we apply it to Senators or Repre
sentatives in Congress. They are public servants, practically as well as
theoretically, with only one substantial privilege at their service,â€”and that
is to make speeches in the Congressional Record and send them free through
the mail to their constituents. Senator Stanford never availed himself of
this privilege. He was an efficient, conscientious public servant, performing
all his duties faithfully and cheerfully. He never complained of the burden
of small and often trifling demands.
One of the first subjects of national importance to engage his attention
was that of education, in which he was deeply interested. A bill had been
introduced in Congress by Senator Blair of New Hampshire to aid in the
establishment and temporary support of the common schools. The bill pro
vided for the distribution of seventy-seven millions of dollars among the
several states and territories in proportion to the illiteracy in each state or
territory. The distribution was to be in installments covering a period of
eight years. The bill was fully discussed by the leading senators. In the
course of the debate, on February 25, 1890, Senator Stanford delivered a
speech in support of the bill in which he said some pertinent things about
education: â€”
"In my opinion." said he, "our government can have no higher object
than to secure to the people a high degree of intelligence, thereby assisting
them to the attainment of the possibilities of humanity. Those possibilities
and the beneficence of the Creator to man on earth are one and the same,
for it is obvious that there could be no beneficence in the unattainable. Had
we been given reasonable wants without the means of gratifying them, the
Creator's beneficence would be a failure.
"But when we look around at the sources of supply for our wants,
whether physical or intellectual, we find them inexhaustibly supplied in the
soil, waters, forests, mines and quarries. The raw material is everywhere
within our reach, requiring only the intelligent application of labor and the
control of the forces of nature. How this labor is to be supplied, and this
control obtained, is what education will teach."
He believed in education of the masses, and he particularly favored the

bill then under consideration because it provided for the education of both
sexes alike for their respective callings. He believed in the early education
of the child for the moral influence it would have in forming his character
and in laying the foundation for his future efficiency. He believed in educat
ing all classes for the active duties of life, and for the deeper insight it gave
into nature, and the greater knowledge of her wonderful forces, which, being
understood, developed and brought under control, would enable humanity to
realize the glorious destiny marked out for it by the Creator.
The bill which he was then supporting was defeated, mainly, as I recall,
on constitutional grounds. But he supported other educational bills which
became laws, notably bills in aid of state agricultural colleges, providing for
experimental stations, and a more thorough training in agricultural pursuits.
He was himself an agriculturalist on a large scale, and with his extensive
land holdings he naturally took a practical interest in the industry. But his
interest was much more than personal. He viewed the production of the soil
from the standpoint of the nation's welfare, and believed that the nation might
increase its wealth enormously by the introduction of intelligent, economical
methods.
A Pioneer Advocate of Land Loan Laws.
He accordingly proposed a scheme for government loans on real estate,
which should have the double purpose of furnishing the country with an
elastic currency of sufficient volume to meet its requirements, and at the
same time supply the farmer with money at a low rate of interest to meet
the necessities of his calling, and make agriculture profitable and attractive.
The scheme was a bold one, but it was one in which Senator Stanford had the
utmost confidence, and he was astonished that it did not receive general ap
proval. I think the greatest disappointment he suffered during his senatorial
career was his failure to secure any general support for this bill.
In view of recent legislation, it would seem that his failure was due
mainly to the fact that he was at least twenty years in advance of the times.
Senator Stanford was essentially a progressive, and he was generally a
pioneer in whatever he undertook, whether it was the formation of a political
party, building a railroad, developing some new industry, or founding a Uni
versity. He could see well into the future, and he usually saw his efforts
successful; but in this instance lie did not see his scheme adopted. Now,
I am not going to discuss this financial question in any great detail. Mr.
Gladstone is reported to have said in a debate in the British House of Com
mons concerning some financial measure before it, that there were two roads
rÂ»ilroad timetable, and the other was the study of the principles of banking
and currency. For your sakes as well as for my own, I shall touch but lightly
upon this financial question.
But a few words of explanation are necessary to understand the full
scope and purposes of Senator Stanford's scheme: â€”
The speaker now explained the scope and purpose of Senator Stanford's
scheme, and the financial situation preceding the panic of 1893.
While this financial storm was brewing, Senator Stanford brought for
ward his land loan scheme. He first introduced a resolution in the Senate,
on March 10th, 1890, instructing the finance committee of that body to report
what relief might be provided by the United States government for the strin
gency in the money market, and particularly whether loans might be made
by the government upon mortgages. This resolution failed to receive any
consideration. On May 20th, IS9O, he introduced a bill entitled, "A bill to
provide the government with means sufficient to supply the national govern
ment with a sound circulating medium." This bill provided that the treasurer
of the United States should cause to be printed notes of the United States
to the amount of one hundred millions of dollars, and such additional amounts
from time to time as should be necessary to meet the requirements of the
act. These notes were to be a legal tender for all private and certain public
debts, and were to be loaned on unincumbered agricultural land upon interest
at the rate of two per cent per annum. A loan was not to exceed one half
of the assessed value of the land and for a term of not to exceed twenty
years. No loan was to be for a sum less than $250. The bill provided for a
bureau in the treasury department to administer the provisions of the act.
A few days after the introduction of this bill Senator Stanford made a
speech in its support in which he explained its provisions, and contended
that the plan of loaning money upon land at two per cent, with the privilege
to the borrower of returning it when he had no use for it, would create a
money system that would meet financial expansions and contractions as they
might occur. He did not claim, however, that his bill had been perfected in
detail. What he did claim was that the principle of loaning the credit of
the nation upon sufficient security, to those who needed it, should be ex
tended to the farmers on the security of real estate as had already been done
to the national banks on the security of United States bonds, and that the
financial condition of the country urgently required legislation to that end.
The bill was referred to the Senate Committee on Finance. That committee,
composed it must be said, of able and experienced statesmen, reported on
tfc bill adversely, classifying the proposed scheme with a number of others in
this country and elsewhere that had operated disastrously. The committee
held the bill to be bad in substance, and unconstitutional. Upon this report
the bill was indefinitely postponed.
In January, 1891, Senator Stanford was re-elected to the Senate for a
second term of six years, and be again introduced his land loan bill with
another bill placing the scheme squarely upon a gold basis. In January, 1892,
he made another and more elaborate speech in its support, at the same time
replying to the adverse report of the Finance Committee made in the previous
Congress. He was now thoroughly aroused and defended bis scheme with
great force. A Kansas Senator came to his support, and it looked as though
the bill was about to be considered on its merits, and amended so as to pro
vide against the possibility of an inflated currency. The bill was pending
in the Senate at the time of Senator Stanford's death on June 21st, 1593.
Senator Stanford Eulogized.
At the memorial exercises in the United States Senate on September 16,
1593, and in the House of Representatives on February 12, 1894, the members
of both houses paid feeling tributes to the life and character of Senator Stan
ford. The address of Senator Daniel of Virginia, in particular, was very im
pressive by reason of the eloquent and feeling personality of his remarks.
He referred to the land loan bill in terms that corresponded so nearly with
my own experience that I venture to repeat them here:â€”
"He (Senator Stanford) had some ideas which he was never able to im
press upon his associates as being practicable, among them liis idea of lend
ing vast amounts of money upon land. I have talked with him for hours and
hours upon repeated occasions on that theme, and he often urged me to adopt
his views and advocate them. I could neever see that they were practicable,
and with all my respect for him and desire to meet his wishes T could not,
of course, comply with his request. Yet let me say that beneath the difficul
ties which present themselves to such an idea as he had formed, there are
in it germs of truth and wisdom such as are found in the first evolutions of
invention, which, in a later and riper day of the world's history, may be de
veloped into much that is attainable and good. ... As the world's pop
ulation shall increase, and as financial refinements and facilities shall be
developed, there will be found in this idea much to build upon, and in the
end probably some ripe consummation."
How gracious and candid this was: This was twenty years ago. We have
experienced some squally financial times since then. The period commenced
with the panic of 1893 and included the panic of 1907: but the country has
made substantial progress in its financial system during this time, and in
the direction of Senator Stanford's scheme. This progress will be found in
the recent act of December 23, 1913, providing for reserve banks and an
elastic currency, with gold as the standard of values. Mr. Horace White,
the well known editor and financial expert, writing of this act in the North
American Review, says: â€”
"Twenty years was required to prepare public opinion, including that of
bankers and congressmen, for the adoption of asset currency in the place of
bond currency."
Judge Morrow proceeded to show that present financial legislation rests
upon the basic principle of Senator Stanford's land loan bill.
The Founding of Stanford University.
We come now to the last and most impressive and important act of Sen
ator Stanford's remarkable career, â€”the founding of this great university,
when he said, "The children of California shall be my children." In this act
we associate the name of that true and faithful companion and devoted wife,
Jane Lathrop Stanford. The founding of this university was the blending of
the pride and glory of both of their lives, in a vision of higher needs and
deeper realities. For thirty-five years they had been co-workers in all of
the affairs of life, reaching out to noble works and generous deeds. But now,
in memory of their idolized son, they lovingly united in founding this institu
tion as a perpetual memorial to his youthful ambition to better the world by
education.
In January, 1885, Senator Stanford submitted to the legislature of this
state an act to advance learning, and the arts and sciences, by providing for
the foundation and endowment within the state of universities and other
institutions of learning. This act passed both houses of the legislature and
was approved by the Governor on March 9th, 1885, â€”twenty-nine years ago
to-day. This act was general in its terms in accordance with the constitu
tional requirement, but was intended to be and was in fact the foundation
of this university. It is a happy coincidence that we commemorate the birth
of the founder, Leland Stanford, and the foundation act, on the same day.
Selection of the First President.
The seection of the first president for this university was a matter of
very serious concern with Senator and Mrs. Stanford. Their ideal of a presi
dent was as exceptional and as exalted as their ideal of the institution they
were founding; and accordingly the whole field of eligible persons was thor
oughly canvassed, and the qualifications of each carefully weighed with re
spect to the immediate work of organization, as well as ability to project the
lines of future development. It was from such a process of weighing and
sifting that the selection fell upon that distinguished scientist and able
executive, David Starr Jordan.
Senator and Mrs. Stanford were very earnest and very laborious in the
effort to frame the outline of an institution whose teachings would be of the
highest character. They believed in the value of present knowledge, but they
also believed in the value of work expended in the discovery of new truths.
They believed in teaching the student how to thread his way through the
known regions of knowledge, but they also believed in extending the boun
daries of knowledge into the unexplored; that humanity might know and
possess its inheritance. An institution to correspond to such a plan must
necessarily be a growth, the result of the slow process of evolution.
"Every true man," says Emerson, "is a cause, a country and an age;
requires infinite spaces and numbers and time fully to accomplish his design."
We look upon this university in that light, and behold it in the process
of development reflecting the spirit and purpose of its founders. We see
now the university taking its place as a force in the march of progress, ad
vancing the standards of skill and efficiency, and equipping explorers for new
fields of knowledge in the search for truth. We see it working out its des
tiny in promoting "the public welfare by exercising an influence in behalf
of humanity and civilization, teaching the blessings of liberty regulated by
law, inculcating love and reverence for the great principles of government
as derived from the inalienable rights of man to life, liberty and the pursuit
of. happiness."
We assemble here to-day to recall these works, revive the prophetic
vision of the founders; and pay our tribute of respect to the genius of the
builders who, building as they knew, built for all time.
The Founders' Day address deliv
ered this morning by Judge William
W. Morrow conies from an especially
authentic source, and constitutes the
j most elaborate memorial to Senator
Stanford yet attempted. For this
reason a desire has been expressed
that it be preserved in permanent
| form, and it is accordingly printed
almost in full.
The invitation I had the pleasure
|of receiving from the Faculty Com
: inittee to deliver the Founders' Day
address on this occasion came with
the suggestion that I should speak
from my personal knowledge of the

life and public services of Senator
Leland Stanford. The suggestion
was most acceptable, since it required
nothing more serious or exacting than
the recalling of events in the general
order of a narrative. This effort has
had a personal interest, and has
brought to my mind many interesting
associations connected with the pub
lic affairs of this state and nation, in
which Senator Stanford was a promi
nent figure, and which 1 think illus
trate in a marked degree his original
ity, courage and strength of char
acter.
My acquaintance with Leland Stan
ford covered a period of more than
thirty years, and during part of that
time my relations with him were of
such a nature that phases of his char
acter were brought under my obser
vation that made me know him as a
most unique, independent and com
manding personality.


Judge William \\. Morrow
He was born at Watervliet, New York, on March 9th, 1824 â€”ninety years
ago to-day. Watervliet is about eight miles above Albany, on the Hudson
River. Ilis father was of English stock, with Irish blood in his veins. This
was a combination from which we might expect an individual possessed of
vigorous Qualities of mind and body, coupled with courage and sound judg
ment, and balanced with a strain of quaint, happy humor. These qualities
do in fact appear to have been inherited in full vigor by the sou. The father
was a farmer, and for a time at least a railroad contractor. These parental
occupations must have given the son an early practical view of the affairs
of life and a habit of constant sell' reliance that would be likely to grow into
marked independence of judgment and will.
We start then with heredity, environment and an early experience favora
ble to the future efficiency and independence of the son, who had, moreover,
the advantage of a good, practical education. He studied law and was ad
mitted to the bar in IS4B. In that year lie yielded to the spirit of the day
and moved west to Port Washington, Wisconsin, where he practiced law. He
visited his New York home in 1850 and was there married to Miss .lane La
throp, and returned with his wife to Port Washington. In 1552 a fire de
stroyed his law library and household effects. This misfortune caused him
to consider the advantage of going still further west, and as a result he came
to California. He left his wife with her father in Albany, New York, and
reached California in July, 1552. He visited his brothers who were engaged
in a general merchandise business in Sacramento, and soon after he entered
into the same business for himself at Cold Springs, in Eldorado County. In
1853 he opened a store at Michigan Bluffs, in Placer County,a very prosperous
mining section, and lie also engaged in mining and was highly successlul.
In 1855 he purchased the business of his brothers in Sacramento and the
same year returned cast and brought Mrs. Stanford to California and estab
lished his home at Sacramento.
An Original Republican.
He was an original Republican, and with a few others organized the
Republican Party in Sacramento in 1556. All Republicans were progressives
in those days, and correspondingly fearless. Senator Cole, in his memoirs,
speaking of the Republican Party in Sacramento at that time, says: "The
party at its inception was extremely limited in numbers"; that beside him
self there were "Leland Stanford, C. P. Huntington, Mark Hopkins, Edwin B.
and Charles Crocker, and that besides these there were not for some time as
many as could be counted on one's fingers." But this small party does not
appear to have been ignored by others in the community because of its lack
of numbers. Its members were denounced as agitators, disturbers of the
peace and traitors to the country. Violence against them was resorted to
occasionally, and efforts of intimidation often. Senator Colo gives the copy
of a public notice, printed in large type and posted about the City of Sacra
mento on May 13th, 1856. It was headed, "To Arms," and called upon "all
good citizens to attend a public meeting" at a place named "to devise means
to protect the public welfare by appointing a committee to hang all the leaders
and as many of the attaches of said traitors as may be deemed necessary
to restore the public quiet and put a stop to such treasonable practices."
This notice was understood to be directed against Mr. Stanford and his asso
ciates. It was probably nothing more than a species of intimidation; but
whatever its object it could not have been highly pleasant reading for those
to whom it referred. The historian fails to give us any further information
concerning the meeting. Nobody appears to have been hung; but we are leit
to infer that this little band of agitators followed Franklin's wise advice
given to the signers of the Declaration of Indpendence. They hung together
and thus escaped being hanged separately.
I do not mention these matters to recall ancient animosities, long since
forgiven and forgotten. Mr. Stanford was himself among the first to forgive
and forget, save the humor of some of the situations, to which he sometimes
referred; but T mention these incidents to show you the man in action under
circumstances and conditions calculated to test the strength of his physical
and moral fiber, and his ability to meet the passions and turbulence of a new
community fearlessly and with perfect equanimity.
In 1857 Mr. Stanford was the Republican candidate for state treasurer;
but the party was of such recent origin that its nominations were merely
matters of form to maintain the party organization. In 1859 he was the
nominee of his party for Governor. The Democratic Party was divided. One
wing, being known as the Lecompton Party, nominated a ticket with Mr.
Latham as candidate for Governor, and the other wing, or Anti-Lecompton
Party, nominated a ticket with Judge John Curry for that office. There was
a natural tendency for the latter party to unite with the Republican Party,
as it subsequently did; but at this time there were influences at work in
favor of the Republican Party withdrawing from the field. Horace Greeley,
the editor of the New York Tribune, a man of distinction, and the foremost
Republican in the United States, arrived in California in the summer of 1559.
lie was everywhere received with the greatest enthusiasm and accorded every
consideration. Tie made a number of speeches in the state, and, regarding
himself as entitled by his position to advise Republicans as to their duty, he
proposed that they should withdraw their ticket and support the Anti-Le
compton Party.
The proposition was submitted to Mr. Stanford. His reply was charac
teristic of the man. He declined to withdraw, maintaining with firmness that
it was the duty of the Republican Party to stand by its principles whatever
the result. He preferred to go down to defeat rather than to surrender to
an opposing party the standard placed in his hands by his political friends
and supporters. He was not a mere office seeker. He was charged with the
duty of preserving the integrity of a party organization, and he would per
form that duty. Like Mr. Lincoln he would not be the last to desert. He
would not desert at all. He was defeated at the polls, but be demonstrated
to the people of the state that he was not a weak or an uncertain leader.
He was again nominated for Governor in 1861, and it was in this cam
paign that 1 first became acquainted with him. T was then located at Santa
Rosa. I was anxious to hear him, although I was not then a voter. I had
come to California two years before from the state of Illinois, where political
questions occupied the public mind to the exclusion of almost every other
subject. I had heard such public speakers as Lincoln, Douglass, Trumbull,
Browning and many others of their type. These were all rugged men of dis
tinguished ability, combined with great force of character. Coming here
from such a field of political discussion, my first impression of California
speakers was a disappointment. They seemed to me to be lacking in force
and in an understanding of national questions. I inquired for the joint de

bates between candidates, with which I had been familiar, and the keen dis
cussion of such national questions as the Missouri Compromise, the Dred
Scott decision, and the Leconipton Constitution. In Illinois the discussion
of political questions was about the only diversion the people had, and they
were accustomed to hear public speakers gifted with the force of persuasive
eloquence. It seemed to me that the California speakers did not measure up
to the standard we had in Illinois; but I was told to be patient until I heard
such speakers as Colonel E. D. Baker, Frederick P. Tracy, Thomas Starr
King, Thomas Fitch, Henry Edgerton, and other orators of repute. I soon
heard these speakers, and while they had culture of a high order, they lacked
the plain homely frontier character of the middle west. But I soon became
convinced that there were political orators in California as well as in Illinois.
Incidentally it may be said that Colonel Baker, the greatest orator of modern
times, was from Illinois and had been an associate of Mr. Lincoln. He had
been trained in the Illinois school of political discussion, and was a master
of the art. He was a soldier, orator and statesman.
While I was in this state of curiosity about the public speakers of the
state, Mr. Stanford was advertised to speak in Santa Rosa on the issues of
the day. lie was a leader of the new party, based upon a new and an untried
platform of principles. The political sentiment of that place at that time
was decidedly unfriendly to the new party and its candidates. Mr. Stanford
was received respectfully, but not enthusiastically. His personal appearance
was impressive. He was then thirty-seven years of age, large of frame, with
a swarthy complexion and something of the plain rugged features of the
frontiersman. He was dignified in manner, with a peculiarly attractive com
posure. His voice was melodious and pleasant; his language clear and ex
pressive. He was listened to by a large audience with respectful interest.
He wasted no time on immaterial questions but went directly into the issues
of the campaign. The platform of the party had declared in favor of the com
mon school system, and insisted that it should be sustained in all of its es
sential features, and its benefits and efficiency extended. The platform also
declared in favor of distributing the public lands of the United States to
homestead settlers, and pledged the party to aid the immediate construction
of a transcontinental railroad. The platform declared further that the Re
publicans of California pledged themselves, and all they had, to sustain the
national administration at Washington. Mr. Lincoln had been elected in the
previous November, and on the fourth of March had been inaugurated Presi
dent. Mr. Stanford had been a delegate from California to the National Re
publican Convention that had placed Mr. Lincoln in nomination, and had ad
vocated his election. He was the President's friend and adviser, and the two
men had much that was in common.
In Mr. Stanford's speech on the occasion to which I refer, he discussed
the platform of the party and declared his adherence to its principles. He
spoke with the eloquence of an honest conviction. He believed that the public
school system was at the very foundation of our form of government; that
the public domain should be given freely to actual settlers for the building
of homes; that the Pacific Railroad should be built at the earliest possible
moment that the people of the Pacific Coast might have quick and ample com
munication with the east. He declared that he was doing and would continue
to do what he could to further the project; and in concluding he paid a
splendid and feeling tribute to the high character and patriotism of Mr. Lin
coln, and his administration, and its purpose to maintain the perpetuity of
the Union.
Elected Governor of California.
It is difficult now to understand how any of these questions could have
ever been a subject of serious discussion; but they were, and the discussions
were vigorous, sometimes violent. Mr. Stanford presented them in an able
and fearless manner in all of the principal localities of the state. He gained
the confidence of the people by his plain, straightforward speech and man
ner, and was elected by a large plurality. His term of office was for two
years. Having become president of the Central Pacific Railroad, then in
course of construction, he declined a renomination. During his term of
office as governor he gave the state a wise and an efficient administration
and was counted one of the "War Governors" of the nation, taking a place in
support of the national cause along side of such governors as Andrews of
Massachusetts, Washburn of Maine, Morgan of New York, Curtin of Penn
sylvania, Morton of Indiana, Yates of Illinois and Kirkwood of lowa.
In June, 1861, and ten days after Mr. Stanford had been nominated for
Governor, he and a few other citizens of Sacramento organized and incor
porated the Central Pacific Railroad Company, under the laws of the State
of California, with Mr. Stanford as the president of the corporation. Con
gress had not then passed the act to aid in the construction of the railroad
and telegraph line from the Missouri River to the Pacific Ocean. That act
was not passed until July Ist, 1562. It organized the Union Pacific Railroad
Company with an imposing array of stockholders, to build a railroad west
from the Missouri River to a connection with the Central Pacific Railroad of
California. Mr. Stanford's associates were not so conspicuous, but they were
men of ability and character. Among them were Theodore D. .ludah, a dis
tinguished engineer, C. P. Huntington, Mark Hopkins and Charles Crocker,
merchants of Sacramento. There were a few others, but these were the men
who afterwards became known in the construction of the road, and in the
affairs of the state and nation in connection with this enterprise.
The object of the corporation which these men formed was to construct
a railroad from Sacramento eastward on the line of the proposed transcon
tinental railroad, and on January Bth, 1563, Governor Stanford turned the
first spadeful of earth in Sacramento for its construction. At that time the
only railroads in the state were a short line from Sacramento to Polsom, a
distance of about twenty miles, and a partly constructed railroad from San
Francisco to San Jose. The construction of these two short lines had been
very-expensive, and were in fact a warning against the prosecution of an
other such enterprise at that time. Railroad iron, locomotives and other
rolling stock had to be brought from the east around the Horn in sailing
vessels; and the cost of all kinds of material was very high, and labor dear
and scarce.
Judge Morrow at this point eloquently told the graphic narrative of the
building of the Central Pacific railroad, showing the indomitable will with
which its construction was pushed forward. He discussed the incorporation
of the Southern Pacific and threatened competition from the Atlantic and
Pacific and Texas and Pacific roads, and continued:
In this way Governor Stanford and his associates met and blocked these
two roads coming from the east at the boundary line of the state, one tempo
rarily and the other permanently. The Atlantic and Pacific subsequently
purchased the Southern Pacific line from Mohave to the Needles, and the
Santa Fe, its successor, finally reached the Bay of San Francisco by an inde
pendent terminal at Point Richmond. The Texas Pacific railroad never
reached the Colorado River, but the Southern Pacific, building eastward from
Yuma, pushed on across Arizona and New Mexico, and met the Texas Pacific
at the Rio Grande, near El Paso, in the State of Texas.
Under another act of Congress passed in 1566, the Central Pacific rail
road, under the name of the California and Oregon railroad, was authorized
to build northward toward the Oregon lino to connect with another railroad
coming south from Portland, Oregon. This line was built and a road opened
to Portland.
Governor Stanford and his associates also acquired control of short lines
by which they reached the Bay of San Francisco from the Sacramento and
San Joaquin Valleys. They also built a line down the coast; and with all
these lines, connections and terminals they secured substantial control of
the transportation facilities of the state, and in 1885 they merged all of these
railroads under the control of the Southern Pacific Company.
I mention these matters to show with what determination, force and
ability these men pushed forward against formidable opposition, and in the
fact of difficulties obtained the substantial control of the transportation facili
ties of the state. It has been said that others could have done the same thing
with the same assistance in national bonds, land grants and other contribu
tions. The fact remains that others, with like opportunities, did not make
the effort, and that others failed, with the same opportunities, to carry to
successful completion, corresponding enterprises. Every transcontinental
railroad coming westward toward the coast, and with which the Central Pa
cific railroad or the Southern Pacific railroad was authorized to connect,
failed at one time or another to meet their financial obligations, and were
placed by the courts in the hands of receivers. Comparisons are odious, and
however tempting this one may be, it will not be carried further.
But it is a fair question to ask: What have been the financial operations
of the corporations involved in the Southern Pacific System? Have any of
these failed to meet their obligations? Have any of them been in the hands
of receivers? AVe find 110 such records. They appear to have paid their debts
at maturity, including the bonded debt and interest due to the United States
by the Central Pacific. Perhaps some credit may be due to Governor Stan
ford and his associates for so having managed these properties that all the
corporations under their control have maintained their financial integrity
from the first spadeful of earth turned 011 the Bth day of January, 1863, down
to the present time.
During all this time of construction, Governor Stanford continued at the
head of the corporations incorporated into this one controlling system. The
people and press of the state protested, and charged that a grasping monop
oly had been formed to appropriate the transportation facilities of the state.
It was insisted that competitive transcontinental lines should be admitted
into tlie state and competition in freight and passen&ei lates seemed.
Governor Stanford and his associates proceeded upon the theory that
whatever monopoly there was in the Southern Pacific system was for the
best interests of the state; that what the state needed was the development
of its extensive and valuable resources, and that to do this it was impera
tive that railroad transportation be extended to all points of the state where
business would justify it, either presently or prospectively; that one cor
poration or one system, witli its connecting lines and terminals, could do
this better and cheaper than several; that additional transcontinental lines
would not be competitive, and would not confer the benefits that were ex
pected by the public.
During the time Governor Stanford and his associates continued in con
trol of the Southern Pacific System they never wavered in their adherence
to this policy Neither did the press nor the public, until very recently,
abandon their opposition to that policy. The Santa Pc came into the state as
a competing road for business, but not with respect to rates foi fi eight and
fares, which now became matters for the Interstate Commerce Commission
and the State Railroad Commission.
This question of railroad competition now comes up 111 a legal aspect.
The Federal Government had submitted to the courts the question whether
the merging of the Central Pacific and its terminals, into the Southern Pa
cific System, is a monopoly in restraint of trade and commerce in violation
of the Sherman Anti-trust Law. This action 011 the part of the government
is now being vigorously resisted by substantially the entiic business inteiesls
of the state, upon the ground that the merging of these connecting lines and
terminal facilities twenty-nine years ago was for the best interests of the
people of this state, and is so now. The farseeing policy that constructed
this system is now approved by the public, and the policy ot Goveinoi Stan
ford and his associates in extending and developing the Southern Pacific
System from ISGS to 18S5 is now the declared policy of the people of the state
of California in dealing with this transcontinental transportation question.
Upon the legal question I express no opinion, but upon the question of policy
I have the opinion of a citizen that the present situation should not be
disturbed.
All Advocnte of Educational Legislation.
I come now to a period of a very different character, when my relations
with Governor Stanford became official, personal and in some respects quite
intimate. In January, ISBS, Governor Stanford was elected by the legislature
of the state to the United States Senate for the term of six years commencing
on March 4, 18S5. I had been elected in November, 18S4, to the House of
Representatives from the San Francisco District, for the term of two years
commencing also 011 March 4, 1885. By reelection I served six years in the
House of Representatives, from 1885 to 1891.
During this time it was customary for Senator Stanford to have frequent
conferences at his house with the California members of the House of Repre
sentatives concerning California matters. These conferences were nearly
always interesting, and sometimes amusing,â€”interesting because they either
related to some matter of legislation before Congress, or something pending
before one or more of the departments in which important interests of the
state were concerned, â€”amusing because of the extraordinary demands made
upon the Senators and members of Congress by their constituents, â€”from
turnip seeds and popcorn to patents for nutmeg graters and flying machines.
We speak of public officials as public servants, but we never use that term
with so much accuracy and feeling as when we apply it to Senators or Repre
sentatives in Congress. They are public servants, practically as well as
theoretically, with only one substantial privilege at their service,â€”and that
is to make speeches in the Congressional Record and send them free through
the mail to their constituents. Senator Stanford never availed himself of
this privilege. He was an efficient, conscientious public servant, performing
all his duties faithfully and cheerfully. He never complained of the burden
of small and often trifling demands.
One of the first subjects of national importance to engage his attention
was that of education, in which he was deeply interested. A bill had been
introduced in Congress by Senator Blair of New Hampshire to aid in the
establishment and temporary support of the common schools. The bill pro
vided for the distribution of seventy-seven millions of dollars among the
several states and territories in proportion to the illiteracy in each state or
territory. The distribution was to be in installments covering a period of
eight years. The bill was fully discussed by the leading senators. In the
course of the debate, on February 25, 1890, Senator Stanford delivered a
speech in support of the bill in which he said some pertinent things about
education: â€”
"In my opinion." said he, "our government can have no higher object
than to secure to the people a high degree of intelligence, thereby assisting
them to the attainment of the possibilities of humanity. Those possibilities
and the beneficence of the Creator to man on earth are one and the same,
for it is obvious that there could be no beneficence in the unattainable. Had
we been given reasonable wants without the means of gratifying them, the
Creator's beneficence would be a failure.
"But when we look around at the sources of supply for our wants,
whether physical or intellectual, we find them inexhaustibly supplied in the
soil, waters, forests, mines and quarries. The raw material is everywhere
within our reach, requiring only the intelligent application of labor and the
control of the forces of nature. How this labor is to be supplied, and this
control obtained, is what education will teach."
He believed in education of the masses, and he particularly favored the

bill then under consideration because it provided for the education of both
sexes alike for their respective callings. He believed in the early education
of the child for the moral influence it would have in forming his character
and in laying the foundation for his future efficiency. He believed in educat
ing all classes for the active duties of life, and for the deeper insight it gave
into nature, and the greater knowledge of her wonderful forces, which, being
understood, developed and brought under control, would enable humanity to
realize the glorious destiny marked out for it by the Creator.
The bill which he was then supporting was defeated, mainly, as I recall,
on constitutional grounds. But he supported other educational bills which
became laws, notably bills in aid of state agricultural colleges, providing for
experimental stations, and a more thorough training in agricultural pursuits.
He was himself an agriculturalist on a large scale, and with his extensive
land holdings he naturally took a practical interest in the industry. But his
interest was much more than personal. He viewed the production of the soil
from the standpoint of the nation's welfare, and believed that the nation might
increase its wealth enormously by the introduction of intelligent, economical
methods.
A Pioneer Advocate of Land Loan Laws.
He accordingly proposed a scheme for government loans on real estate,
which should have the double purpose of furnishing the country with an
elastic currency of sufficient volume to meet its requirements, and at the
same time supply the farmer with money at a low rate of interest to meet
the necessities of his calling, and make agriculture profitable and attractive.
The scheme was a bold one, but it was one in which Senator Stanford had the
utmost confidence, and he was astonished that it did not receive general ap
proval. I think the greatest disappointment he suffered during his senatorial
career was his failure to secure any general support for this bill.
In view of recent legislation, it would seem that his failure was due
mainly to the fact that he was at least twenty years in advance of the times.
Senator Stanford was essentially a progressive, and he was generally a
pioneer in whatever he undertook, whether it was the formation of a political
party, building a railroad, developing some new industry, or founding a Uni
versity. He could see well into the future, and he usually saw his efforts
successful; but in this instance lie did not see his scheme adopted. Now,
I am not going to discuss this financial question in any great detail. Mr.
Gladstone is reported to have said in a debate in the British House of Com
mons concerning some financial measure before it, that there were two roads
rÂ»ilroad timetable, and the other was the study of the principles of banking
and currency. For your sakes as well as for my own, I shall touch but lightly
upon this financial question.
But a few words of explanation are necessary to understand the full
scope and purposes of Senator Stanford's scheme: â€”
The speaker now explained the scope and purpose of Senator Stanford's
scheme, and the financial situation preceding the panic of 1893.
While this financial storm was brewing, Senator Stanford brought for
ward his land loan scheme. He first introduced a resolution in the Senate,
on March 10th, 1890, instructing the finance committee of that body to report
what relief might be provided by the United States government for the strin
gency in the money market, and particularly whether loans might be made
by the government upon mortgages. This resolution failed to receive any
consideration. On May 20th, IS9O, he introduced a bill entitled, "A bill to
provide the government with means sufficient to supply the national govern
ment with a sound circulating medium." This bill provided that the treasurer
of the United States should cause to be printed notes of the United States
to the amount of one hundred millions of dollars, and such additional amounts
from time to time as should be necessary to meet the requirements of the
act. These notes were to be a legal tender for all private and certain public
debts, and were to be loaned on unincumbered agricultural land upon interest
at the rate of two per cent per annum. A loan was not to exceed one half
of the assessed value of the land and for a term of not to exceed twenty
years. No loan was to be for a sum less than $250. The bill provided for a
bureau in the treasury department to administer the provisions of the act.
A few days after the introduction of this bill Senator Stanford made a
speech in its support in which he explained its provisions, and contended
that the plan of loaning money upon land at two per cent, with the privilege
to the borrower of returning it when he had no use for it, would create a
money system that would meet financial expansions and contractions as they
might occur. He did not claim, however, that his bill had been perfected in
detail. What he did claim was that the principle of loaning the credit of
the nation upon sufficient security, to those who needed it, should be ex
tended to the farmers on the security of real estate as had already been done
to the national banks on the security of United States bonds, and that the
financial condition of the country urgently required legislation to that end.
The bill was referred to the Senate Committee on Finance. That committee,
composed it must be said, of able and experienced statesmen, reported on
tfc bill adversely, classifying the proposed scheme with a number of others in
this country and elsewhere that had operated disastrously. The committee
held the bill to be bad in substance, and unconstitutional. Upon this report
the bill was indefinitely postponed.
In January, 1891, Senator Stanford was re-elected to the Senate for a
second term of six years, and be again introduced his land loan bill with
another bill placing the scheme squarely upon a gold basis. In January, 1892,
he made another and more elaborate speech in its support, at the same time
replying to the adverse report of the Finance Committee made in the previous
Congress. He was now thoroughly aroused and defended bis scheme with
great force. A Kansas Senator came to his support, and it looked as though
the bill was about to be considered on its merits, and amended so as to pro
vide against the possibility of an inflated currency. The bill was pending
in the Senate at the time of Senator Stanford's death on June 21st, 1593.
Senator Stanford Eulogized.
At the memorial exercises in the United States Senate on September 16,
1593, and in the House of Representatives on February 12, 1894, the members
of both houses paid feeling tributes to the life and character of Senator Stan
ford. The address of Senator Daniel of Virginia, in particular, was very im
pressive by reason of the eloquent and feeling personality of his remarks.
He referred to the land loan bill in terms that corresponded so nearly with
my own experience that I venture to repeat them here:â€”
"He (Senator Stanford) had some ideas which he was never able to im
press upon his associates as being practicable, among them liis idea of lend
ing vast amounts of money upon land. I have talked with him for hours and
hours upon repeated occasions on that theme, and he often urged me to adopt
his views and advocate them. I could neever see that they were practicable,
and with all my respect for him and desire to meet his wishes T could not,
of course, comply with his request. Yet let me say that beneath the difficul
ties which present themselves to such an idea as he had formed, there are
in it germs of truth and wisdom such as are found in the first evolutions of
invention, which, in a later and riper day of the world's history, may be de
veloped into much that is attainable and good. ... As the world's pop
ulation shall increase, and as financial refinements and facilities shall be
developed, there will be found in this idea much to build upon, and in the
end probably some ripe consummation."
How gracious and candid this was: This was twenty years ago. We have
experienced some squally financial times since then. The period commenced
with the panic of 1893 and included the panic of 1907: but the country has
made substantial progress in its financial system during this time, and in
the direction of Senator Stanford's scheme. This progress will be found in
the recent act of December 23, 1913, providing for reserve banks and an
elastic currency, with gold as the standard of values. Mr. Horace White,
the well known editor and financial expert, writing of this act in the North
American Review, says: â€”
"Twenty years was required to prepare public opinion, including that of
bankers and congressmen, for the adoption of asset currency in the place of
bond currency."
Judge Morrow proceeded to show that present financial legislation rests
upon the basic principle of Senator Stanford's land loan bill.
The Founding of Stanford University.
We come now to the last and most impressive and important act of Sen
ator Stanford's remarkable career, â€”the founding of this great university,
when he said, "The children of California shall be my children." In this act
we associate the name of that true and faithful companion and devoted wife,
Jane Lathrop Stanford. The founding of this university was the blending of
the pride and glory of both of their lives, in a vision of higher needs and
deeper realities. For thirty-five years they had been co-workers in all of
the affairs of life, reaching out to noble works and generous deeds. But now,
in memory of their idolized son, they lovingly united in founding this institu
tion as a perpetual memorial to his youthful ambition to better the world by
education.
In January, 1885, Senator Stanford submitted to the legislature of this
state an act to advance learning, and the arts and sciences, by providing for
the foundation and endowment within the state of universities and other
institutions of learning. This act passed both houses of the legislature and
was approved by the Governor on March 9th, 1885, â€”twenty-nine years ago
to-day. This act was general in its terms in accordance with the constitu
tional requirement, but was intended to be and was in fact the foundation
of this university. It is a happy coincidence that we commemorate the birth
of the founder, Leland Stanford, and the foundation act, on the same day.
Selection of the First President.
The seection of the first president for this university was a matter of
very serious concern with Senator and Mrs. Stanford. Their ideal of a presi
dent was as exceptional and as exalted as their ideal of the institution they
were founding; and accordingly the whole field of eligible persons was thor
oughly canvassed, and the qualifications of each carefully weighed with re
spect to the immediate work of organization, as well as ability to project the
lines of future development. It was from such a process of weighing and
sifting that the selection fell upon that distinguished scientist and able
executive, David Starr Jordan.
Senator and Mrs. Stanford were very earnest and very laborious in the
effort to frame the outline of an institution whose teachings would be of the
highest character. They believed in the value of present knowledge, but they
also believed in the value of work expended in the discovery of new truths.
They believed in teaching the student how to thread his way through the
known regions of knowledge, but they also believed in extending the boun
daries of knowledge into the unexplored; that humanity might know and
possess its inheritance. An institution to correspond to such a plan must
necessarily be a growth, the result of the slow process of evolution.
"Every true man," says Emerson, "is a cause, a country and an age;
requires infinite spaces and numbers and time fully to accomplish his design."
We look upon this university in that light, and behold it in the process
of development reflecting the spirit and purpose of its founders. We see
now the university taking its place as a force in the march of progress, ad
vancing the standards of skill and efficiency, and equipping explorers for new
fields of knowledge in the search for truth. We see it working out its des
tiny in promoting "the public welfare by exercising an influence in behalf
of humanity and civilization, teaching the blessings of liberty regulated by
law, inculcating love and reverence for the great principles of government
as derived from the inalienable rights of man to life, liberty and the pursuit
of. happiness."
We assemble here to-day to recall these works, revive the prophetic
vision of the founders; and pay our tribute of respect to the genius of the
builders who, building as they knew, built for all time.
The Founders' Day address deliv
ered this morning by Judge William
W. Morrow conies from an especially
authentic source, and constitutes the
j most elaborate memorial to Senator
Stanford yet attempted. For this
reason a desire has been expressed
that it be preserved in permanent
| form, and it is accordingly printed
almost in full.
The invitation I had the pleasure
|of receiving from the Faculty Com
: inittee to deliver the Founders' Day
address on this occasion came with
the suggestion that I should speak
from my personal knowledge of the

life and public services of Senator
Leland Stanford. The suggestion
was most acceptable, since it required
nothing more serious or exacting than
the recalling of events in the general
order of a narrative. This effort has
had a personal interest, and has
brought to my mind many interesting
associations connected with the pub
lic affairs of this state and nation, in
which Senator Stanford was a promi
nent figure, and which 1 think illus
trate in a marked degree his original
ity, courage and strength of char
acter.
My acquaintance with Leland Stan
ford covered a period of more than
thirty years, and during part of that
time my relations with him were of
such a nature that phases of his char
acter were brought under my obser
vation that made me know him as a
most unique, independent and com
manding personality.


Judge William \\. Morrow
He was born at Watervliet, New York, on March 9th, 1824 â€”ninety years
ago to-day. Watervliet is about eight miles above Albany, on the Hudson
River. Ilis father was of English stock, with Irish blood in his veins. This
was a combination from which we might expect an individual possessed of
vigorous Qualities of mind and body, coupled with courage and sound judg
ment, and balanced with a strain of quaint, happy humor. These qualities
do in fact appear to have been inherited in full vigor by the sou. The father
was a farmer, and for a time at least a railroad contractor. These parental
occupations must have given the son an early practical view of the affairs
of life and a habit of constant sell' reliance that would be likely to grow into
marked independence of judgment and will.
We start then with heredity, environment and an early experience favora
ble to the future efficiency and independence of the son, who had, moreover,
the advantage of a good, practical education. He studied law and was ad
mitted to the bar in IS4B. In that year lie yielded to the spirit of the day
and moved west to Port Washington, Wisconsin, where he practiced law. He
visited his New York home in 1850 and was there married to Miss .lane La
throp, and returned with his wife to Port Washington. In 1552 a fire de
stroyed his law library and household effects. This misfortune caused him
to consider the advantage of going still further west, and as a result he came
to California. He left his wife with her father in Albany, New York, and
reached California in July, 1552. He visited his brothers who were engaged
in a general merchandise business in Sacramento, and soon after he entered
into the same business for himself at Cold Springs, in Eldorado County. In
1853 he opened a store at Michigan Bluffs, in Placer County,a very prosperous
mining section, and lie also engaged in mining and was highly successlul.
In 1855 he purchased the business of his brothers in Sacramento and the
same year returned cast and brought Mrs. Stanford to California and estab
lished his home at Sacramento.
An Original Republican.
He was an original Republican, and with a few others organized the
Republican Party in Sacramento in 1556. All Republicans were progressives
in those days, and correspondingly fearless. Senator Cole, in his memoirs,
speaking of the Republican Party in Sacramento at that time, says: "The
party at its inception was extremely limited in numbers"; that beside him
self there were "Leland Stanford, C. P. Huntington, Mark Hopkins, Edwin B.
and Charles Crocker, and that besides these there were not for some time as
many as could be counted on one's fingers." But this small party does not
appear to have been ignored by others in the community because of its lack
of numbers. Its members were denounced as agitators, disturbers of the
peace and traitors to the country. Violence against them was resorted to
occasionally, and efforts of intimidation often. Senator Colo gives the copy
of a public notice, printed in large type and posted about the City of Sacra
mento on May 13th, 1856. It was headed, "To Arms," and called upon "all
good citizens to attend a public meeting" at a place named "to devise means
to protect the public welfare by appointing a committee to hang all the leaders
and as many of the attaches of said traitors as may be deemed necessary
to restore the public quiet and put a stop to such treasonable practices."
This notice was understood to be directed against Mr. Stanford and his asso
ciates. It was probably nothing more than a species of intimidation; but
whatever its object it could not have been highly pleasant reading for those
to whom it referred. The historian fails to give us any further information
concerning the meeting. Nobody appears to have been hung; but we are leit
to infer that this little band of agitators followed Franklin's wise advice
given to the signers of the Declaration of Indpendence. They hung together
and thus escaped being hanged separately.
I do not mention these matters to recall ancient animosities, long since
forgiven and forgotten. Mr. Stanford was himself among the first to forgive
and forget, save the humor of some of the situations, to which he sometimes
referred; but T mention these incidents to show you the man in action under
circumstances and conditions calculated to test the strength of his physical
and moral fiber, and his ability to meet the passions and turbulence of a new
community fearlessly and with perfect equanimity.
In 1857 Mr. Stanford was the Republican candidate for state treasurer;
but the party was of such recent origin that its nominations were merely
matters of form to maintain the party organization. In 1859 he was the
nominee of his party for Governor. The Democratic Party was divided. One
wing, being known as the Lecompton Party, nominated a ticket with Mr.
Latham as candidate for Governor, and the other wing, or Anti-Lecompton
Party, nominated a ticket with Judge John Curry for that office. There was
a natural tendency for the latter party to unite with the Republican Party,
as it subsequently did; but at this time there were influences at work in
favor of the Republican Party withdrawing from the field. Horace Greeley,
the editor of the New York Tribune, a man of distinction, and the foremost
Republican in the United States, arrived in California in the summer of 1559.
lie was everywhere received with the greatest enthusiasm and accorded every
consideration. Tie made a number of speeches in the state, and, regarding
himself as entitled by his position to advise Republicans as to their duty, he
proposed that they should withdraw their ticket and support the Anti-Le
compton Party.
The proposition was submitted to Mr. Stanford. His reply was charac
teristic of the man. He declined to withdraw, maintaining with firmness that
it was the duty of the Republican Party to stand by its principles whatever
the result. He preferred to go down to defeat rather than to surrender to
an opposing party the standard placed in his hands by his political friends
and supporters. He was not a mere office seeker. He was charged with the
duty of preserving the integrity of a party organization, and he would per
form that duty. Like Mr. Lincoln he would not be the last to desert. He
would not desert at all. He was defeated at the polls, but be demonstrated
to the people of the state that he was not a weak or an uncertain leader.
He was again nominated for Governor in 1861, and it was in this cam
paign that 1 first became acquainted with him. T was then located at Santa
Rosa. I was anxious to hear him, although I was not then a voter. I had
come to California two years before from the state of Illinois, where political
questions occupied the public mind to the exclusion of almost every other
subject. I had heard such public speakers as Lincoln, Douglass, Trumbull,
Browning and many others of their type. These were all rugged men of dis
tinguished ability, combined with great force of character. Coming here
from such a field of political discussion, my first impression of California
speakers was a disappointment. They seemed to me to be lacking in force
and in an understanding of national questions. I inquired for the joint de

bates between candidates, with which I had been familiar, and the keen dis
cussion of such national questions as the Missouri Compromise, the Dred
Scott decision, and the Leconipton Constitution. In Illinois the discussion
of political questions was about the only diversion the people had, and they
were accustomed to hear public speakers gifted with the force of persuasive
eloquence. It seemed to me that the California speakers did not measure up
to the standard we had in Illinois; but I was told to be patient until I heard
such speakers as Colonel E. D. Baker, Frederick P. Tracy, Thomas Starr
King, Thomas Fitch, Henry Edgerton, and other orators of repute. I soon
heard these speakers, and while they had culture of a high order, they lacked
the plain homely frontier character of the middle west. But I soon became
convinced that there were political orators in California as well as in Illinois.
Incidentally it may be said that Colonel Baker, the greatest orator of modern
times, was from Illinois and had been an associate of Mr. Lincoln. He had
been trained in the Illinois school of political discussion, and was a master
of the art. He was a soldier, orator and statesman.
While I was in this state of curiosity about the public speakers of the
state, Mr. Stanford was advertised to speak in Santa Rosa on the issues of
the day. lie was a leader of the new party, based upon a new and an untried
platform of principles. The political sentiment of that place at that time
was decidedly unfriendly to the new party and its candidates. Mr. Stanford
was received respectfully, but not enthusiastically. His personal appearance
was impressive. He was then thirty-seven years of age, large of frame, with
a swarthy complexion and something of the plain rugged features of the
frontiersman. He was dignified in manner, with a peculiarly attractive com
posure. His voice was melodious and pleasant; his language clear and ex
pressive. He was listened to by a large audience with respectful interest.
He wasted no time on immaterial questions but went directly into the issues
of the campaign. The platform of the party had declared in favor of the com
mon school system, and insisted that it should be sustained in all of its es
sential features, and its benefits and efficiency extended. The platform also
declared in favor of distributing the public lands of the United States to
homestead settlers, and pledged the party to aid the immediate construction
of a transcontinental railroad. The platform declared further that the Re
publicans of California pledged themselves, and all they had, to sustain the
national administration at Washington. Mr. Lincoln had been elected in the
previous November, and on the fourth of March had been inaugurated Presi
dent. Mr. Stanford had been a delegate from California to the National Re
publican Convention that had placed Mr. Lincoln in nomination, and had ad
vocated his election. He was the President's friend and adviser, and the two
men had much that was in common.
In Mr. Stanford's speech on the occasion to which I refer, he discussed
the platform of the party and declared his adherence to its principles. He
spoke with the eloquence of an honest conviction. He believed that the public
school system was at the very foundation of our form of government; that
the public domain should be given freely to actual settlers for the building
of homes; that the Pacific Railroad should be built at the earliest possible
moment that the people of the Pacific Coast might have quick and ample com
munication with the east. He declared that he was doing and would continue
to do what he could to further the project; and in concluding he paid a
splendid and feeling tribute to the high character and patriotism of Mr. Lin
coln, and his administration, and its purpose to maintain the perpetuity of
the Union.
Elected Governor of California.
It is difficult now to understand how any of these questions could have
ever been a subject of serious discussion; but they were, and the discussions
were vigorous, sometimes violent. Mr. Stanford presented them in an able
and fearless manner in all of the principal localities of the state. He gained
the confidence of the people by his plain, straightforward speech and man
ner, and was elected by a large plurality. His term of office was for two
years. Having become president of the Central Pacific Railroad, then in
course of construction, he declined a renomination. During his term of
office as governor he gave the state a wise and an efficient administration
and was counted one of the "War Governors" of the nation, taking a place in
support of the national cause along side of such governors as Andrews of
Massachusetts, Washburn of Maine, Morgan of New York, Curtin of Penn
sylvania, Morton of Indiana, Yates of Illinois and Kirkwood of lowa.
In June, 1861, and ten days after Mr. Stanford had been nominated for
Governor, he and a few other citizens of Sacramento organized and incor
porated the Central Pacific Railroad Company, under the laws of the State
of California, with Mr. Stanford as the president of the corporation. Con
gress had not then passed the act to aid in the construction of the railroad
and telegraph line from the Missouri River to the Pacific Ocean. That act
was not passed until July Ist, 1562. It organized the Union Pacific Railroad
Company with an imposing array of stockholders, to build a railroad west
from the Missouri River to a connection with the Central Pacific Railroad of
California. Mr. Stanford's associates were not so conspicuous, but they were
men of ability and character. Among them were Theodore D. .ludah, a dis
tinguished engineer, C. P. Huntington, Mark Hopkins and Charles Crocker,
merchants of Sacramento. There were a few others, but these were the men
who afterwards became known in the construction of the road, and in the
affairs of the state and nation in connection with this enterprise.
The object of the corporation which these men formed was to construct
a railroad from Sacramento eastward on the line of the proposed transcon
tinental railroad, and on January Bth, 1563, Governor Stanford turned the
first spadeful of earth in Sacramento for its construction. At that time the
only railroads in the state were a short line from Sacramento to Polsom, a
distance of about twenty miles, and a partly constructed railroad from San
Francisco to San Jose. The construction of these two short lines had been
very-expensive, and were in fact a warning against the prosecution of an
other such enterprise at that time. Railroad iron, locomotives and other
rolling stock had to be brought from the east around the Horn in sailing
vessels; and the cost of all kinds of material was very high, and labor dear
and scarce.
Judge Morrow at this point eloquently told the graphic narrative of the
building of the Central Pacific railroad, showing the indomitable will with
which its construction was pushed forward. He discussed the incorporation
of the Southern Pacific and threatened competition from the Atlantic and
Pacific and Texas and Pacific roads, and continued:
In this way Governor Stanford and his associates met and blocked these
two roads coming from the east at the boundary line of the state, one tempo
rarily and the other permanently. The Atlantic and Pacific subsequently
purchased the Southern Pacific line from Mohave to the Needles, and the
Santa Fe, its successor, finally reached the Bay of San Francisco by an inde
pendent terminal at Point Richmond. The Texas Pacific railroad never
reached the Colorado River, but the Southern Pacific, building eastward from
Yuma, pushed on across Arizona and New Mexico, and met the Texas Pacific
at the Rio Grande, near El Paso, in the State of Texas.
Under another act of Congress passed in 1566, the Central Pacific rail
road, under the name of the California and Oregon railroad, was authorized
to build northward toward the Oregon lino to connect with another railroad
coming south from Portland, Oregon. This line was built and a road opened
to Portland.
Governor Stanford and his associates also acquired control of short lines
by which they reached the Bay of San Francisco from the Sacramento and
San Joaquin Valleys. They also built a line down the coast; and with all
these lines, connections and terminals they secured substantial control of
the transportation facilities of the state, and in 1885 they merged all of these
railroads under the control of the Southern Pacific Company.
I mention these matters to show with what determination, force and
ability these men pushed forward against formidable opposition, and in the
fact of difficulties obtained the substantial control of the transportation facili
ties of the state. It has been said that others could have done the same thing
with the same assistance in national bonds, land grants and other contribu
tions. The fact remains that others, with like opportunities, did not make
the effort, and that others failed, with the same opportunities, to carry to
successful completion, corresponding enterprises. Every transcontinental
railroad coming westward toward the coast, and with which the Central Pa
cific railroad or the Southern Pacific railroad was authorized to connect,
failed at one time or another to meet their financial obligations, and were
placed by the courts in the hands of receivers. Comparisons are odious, and
however tempting this one may be, it will not be carried further.
But it is a fair question to ask: What have been the financial operations
of the corporations involved in the Southern Pacific System? Have any of
these failed to meet their obligations? Have any of them been in the hands
of receivers? AVe find 110 such records. They appear to have paid their debts
at maturity, including the bonded debt and interest due to the United States
by the Central Pacific. Perhaps some credit may be due to Governor Stan
ford and his associates for so having managed these properties that all the
corporations under their control have maintained their financial integrity
from the first spadeful of earth turned 011 the Bth day of January, 1863, down
to the present time.
During all this time of construction, Governor Stanford continued at the
head of the corporations incorporated into this one controlling system. The
people and press of the state protested, and charged that a grasping monop
oly had been formed to appropriate the transportation facilities of the state.
It was insisted that competitive transcontinental lines should be admitted
into tlie state and competition in freight and passen&ei lates seemed.
Governor Stanford and his associates proceeded upon the theory that
whatever monopoly there was in the Southern Pacific system was for the
best interests of the state; that what the state needed was the development
of its extensive and valuable resources, and that to do this it was impera
tive that railroad transportation be extended to all points of the state where
business would justify it, either presently or prospectively; that one cor
poration or one system, witli its connecting lines and terminals, could do
this better and cheaper than several; that additional transcontinental lines
would not be competitive, and would not confer the benefits that were ex
pected by the public.
During the time Governor Stanford and his associates continued in con
trol of the Southern Pacific System they never wavered in their adherence
to this policy Neither did the press nor the public, until very recently,
abandon their opposition to that policy. The Santa Pc came into the state as
a competing road for business, but not with respect to rates foi fi eight and
fares, which now became matters for the Interstate Commerce Commission
and the State Railroad Commission.
This question of railroad competition now comes up 111 a legal aspect.
The Federal Government had submitted to the courts the question whether
the merging of the Central Pacific and its terminals, into the Southern Pa
cific System, is a monopoly in restraint of trade and commerce in violation
of the Sherman Anti-trust Law. This action 011 the part of the government
is now being vigorously resisted by substantially the entiic business inteiesls
of the state, upon the ground that the merging of these connecting lines and
terminal facilities twenty-nine years ago was for the best interests of the
people of this state, and is so now. The farseeing policy that constructed
this system is now approved by the public, and the policy ot Goveinoi Stan
ford and his associates in extending and developing the Southern Pacific
System from ISGS to 18S5 is now the declared policy of the people of the state
of California in dealing with this transcontinental transportation question.
Upon the legal question I express no opinion, but upon the question of policy
I have the opinion of a citizen that the present situation should not be
disturbed.
All Advocnte of Educational Legislation.
I come now to a period of a very different character, when my relations
with Governor Stanford became official, personal and in some respects quite
intimate. In January, ISBS, Governor Stanford was elected by the legislature
of the state to the United States Senate for the term of six years commencing
on March 4, 18S5. I had been elected in November, 18S4, to the House of
Representatives from the San Francisco District, for the term of two years
commencing also 011 March 4, 1885. By reelection I served six years in the
House of Representatives, from 1885 to 1891.
During this time it was customary for Senator Stanford to have frequent
conferences at his house with the California members of the House of Repre
sentatives concerning California matters. These conferences were nearly
always interesting, and sometimes amusing,â€”interesting because they either
related to some matter of legislation before Congress, or something pending
before one or more of the departments in which important interests of the
state were concerned, â€”amusing because of the extraordinary demands made
upon the Senators and members of Congress by their constituents, â€”from
turnip seeds and popcorn to patents for nutmeg graters and flying machines.
We speak of public officials as public servants, but we never use that term
with so much accuracy and feeling as when we apply it to Senators or Repre
sentatives in Congress. They are public servants, practically as well as
theoretically, with only one substantial privilege at their service,â€”and that
is to make speeches in the Congressional Record and send them free through
the mail to their constituents. Senator Stanford never availed himself of
this privilege. He was an efficient, conscientious public servant, performing
all his duties faithfully and cheerfully. He never complained of the burden
of small and often trifling demands.
One of the first subjects of national importance to engage his attention
was that of education, in which he was deeply interested. A bill had been
introduced in Congress by Senator Blair of New Hampshire to aid in the
establishment and temporary support of the common schools. The bill pro
vided for the distribution of seventy-seven millions of dollars among the
several states and territories in proportion to the illiteracy in each state or
territory. The distribution was to be in installments covering a period of
eight years. The bill was fully discussed by the leading senators. In the
course of the debate, on February 25, 1890, Senator Stanford delivered a
speech in support of the bill in which he said some pertinent things about
education: â€”
"In my opinion." said he, "our government can have no higher object
than to secure to the people a high degree of intelligence, thereby assisting
them to the attainment of the possibilities of humanity. Those possibilities
and the beneficence of the Creator to man on earth are one and the same,
for it is obvious that there could be no beneficence in the unattainable. Had
we been given reasonable wants without the means of gratifying them, the
Creator's beneficence would be a failure.
"But when we look around at the sources of supply for our wants,
whether physical or intellectual, we find them inexhaustibly supplied in the
soil, waters, forests, mines and quarries. The raw material is everywhere
within our reach, requiring only the intelligent application of labor and the
control of the forces of nature. How this labor is to be supplied, and this
control obtained, is what education will teach."
He believed in education of the masses, and he particularly favored the

bill then under consideration because it provided for the education of both
sexes alike for their respective callings. He believed in the early education
of the child for the moral influence it would have in forming his character
and in laying the foundation for his future efficiency. He believed in educat
ing all classes for the active duties of life, and for the deeper insight it gave
into nature, and the greater knowledge of her wonderful forces, which, being
understood, developed and brought under control, would enable humanity to
realize the glorious destiny marked out for it by the Creator.
The bill which he was then supporting was defeated, mainly, as I recall,
on constitutional grounds. But he supported other educational bills which
became laws, notably bills in aid of state agricultural colleges, providing for
experimental stations, and a more thorough training in agricultural pursuits.
He was himself an agriculturalist on a large scale, and with his extensive
land holdings he naturally took a practical interest in the industry. But his
interest was much more than personal. He viewed the production of the soil
from the standpoint of the nation's welfare, and believed that the nation might
increase its wealth enormously by the introduction of intelligent, economical
methods.
A Pioneer Advocate of Land Loan Laws.
He accordingly proposed a scheme for government loans on real estate,
which should have the double purpose of furnishing the country with an
elastic currency of sufficient volume to meet its requirements, and at the
same time supply the farmer with money at a low rate of interest to meet
the necessities of his calling, and make agriculture profitable and attractive.
The scheme was a bold one, but it was one in which Senator Stanford had the
utmost confidence, and he was astonished that it did not receive general ap
proval. I think the greatest disappointment he suffered during his senatorial
career was his failure to secure any general support for this bill.
In view of recent legislation, it would seem that his failure was due
mainly to the fact that he was at least twenty years in advance of the times.
Senator Stanford was essentially a progressive, and he was generally a
pioneer in whatever he undertook, whether it was the formation of a political
party, building a railroad, developing some new industry, or founding a Uni
versity. He could see well into the future, and he usually saw his efforts
successful; but in this instance lie did not see his scheme adopted. Now,
I am not going to discuss this financial question in any great detail. Mr.
Gladstone is reported to have said in a debate in the British House of Com
mons concerning some financial measure before it, that there were two roads
rÂ»ilroad timetable, and the other was the study of the principles of banking
and currency. For your sakes as well as for my own, I shall touch but lightly
upon this financial question.
But a few words of explanation are necessary to understand the full
scope and purposes of Senator Stanford's scheme: â€”
The speaker now explained the scope and purpose of Senator Stanford's
scheme, and the financial situation preceding the panic of 1893.
While this financial storm was brewing, Senator Stanford brought for
ward his land loan scheme. He first introduced a resolution in the Senate,
on March 10th, 1890, instructing the finance committee of that body to report
what relief might be provided by the United States government for the strin
gency in the money market, and particularly whether loans might be made
by the government upon mortgages. This resolution failed to receive any
consideration. On May 20th, IS9O, he introduced a bill entitled, "A bill to
provide the government with means sufficient to supply the national govern
ment with a sound circulating medium." This bill provided that the treasurer
of the United States should cause to be printed notes of the United States
to the amount of one hundred millions of dollars, and such additional amounts
from time to time as should be necessary to meet the requirements of the
act. These notes were to be a legal tender for all private and certain public
debts, and were to be loaned on unincumbered agricultural land upon interest
at the rate of two per cent per annum. A loan was not to exceed one half
of the assessed value of the land and for a term of not to exceed twenty
years. No loan was to be for a sum less than $250. The bill provided for a
bureau in the treasury department to administer the provisions of the act.
A few days after the introduction of this bill Senator Stanford made a
speech in its support in which he explained its provisions, and contended
that the plan of loaning money upon land at two per cent, with the privilege
to the borrower of returning it when he had no use for it, would create a
money system that would meet financial expansions and contractions as they
might occur. He did not claim, however, that his bill had been perfected in
detail. What he did claim was that the principle of loaning the credit of
the nation upon sufficient security, to those who needed it, should be ex
tended to the farmers on the security of real estate as had already been done
to the national banks on the security of United States bonds, and that the
financial condition of the country urgently required legislation to that end.
The bill was referred to the Senate Committee on Finance. That committee,
composed it must be said, of able and experienced statesmen, reported on
tfc bill adversely, classifying the proposed scheme with a number of others in
this country and elsewhere that had operated disastrously. The committee
held the bill to be bad in substance, and unconstitutional. Upon this report
the bill was indefinitely postponed.
In January, 1891, Senator Stanford was re-elected to the Senate for a
second term of six years, and be again introduced his land loan bill with
another bill placing the scheme squarely upon a gold basis. In January, 1892,
he made another and more elaborate speech in its support, at the same time
replying to the adverse report of the Finance Committee made in the previous
Congress. He was now thoroughly aroused and defended bis scheme with
great force. A Kansas Senator came to his support, and it looked as though
the bill was about to be considered on its merits, and amended so as to pro
vide against the possibility of an inflated currency. The bill was pending
in the Senate at the time of Senator Stanford's death on June 21st, 1593.
Senator Stanford Eulogized.
At the memorial exercises in the United States Senate on September 16,
1593, and in the House of Representatives on February 12, 1894, the members
of both houses paid feeling tributes to the life and character of Senator Stan
ford. The address of Senator Daniel of Virginia, in particular, was very im
pressive by reason of the eloquent and feeling personality of his remarks.
He referred to the land loan bill in terms that corresponded so nearly with
my own experience that I venture to repeat them here:â€”
"He (Senator Stanford) had some ideas which he was never able to im
press upon his associates as being practicable, among them liis idea of lend
ing vast amounts of money upon land. I have talked with him for hours and
hours upon repeated occasions on that theme, and he often urged me to adopt
his views and advocate them. I could neever see that they were practicable,
and with all my respect for him and desire to meet his wishes T could not,
of course, comply with his request. Yet let me say that beneath the difficul
ties which present themselves to such an idea as he had formed, there are
in it germs of truth and wisdom such as are found in the first evolutions of
invention, which, in a later and riper day of the world's history, may be de
veloped into much that is attainable and good. ... As the world's pop
ulation shall increase, and as financial refinements and facilities shall be
developed, there will be found in this idea much to build upon, and in the
end probably some ripe consummation."
How gracious and candid this was: This was twenty years ago. We have
experienced some squally financial times since then. The period commenced
with the panic of 1893 and included the panic of 1907: but the country has
made substantial progress in its financial system during this time, and in
the direction of Senator Stanford's scheme. This progress will be found in
the recent act of December 23, 1913, providing for reserve banks and an
elastic currency, with gold as the standard of values. Mr. Horace White,
the well known editor and financial expert, writing of this act in the North
American Review, says: â€”
"Twenty years was required to prepare public opinion, including that of
bankers and congressmen, for the adoption of asset currency in the place of
bond currency."
Judge Morrow proceeded to show that present financial legislation rests
upon the basic principle of Senator Stanford's land loan bill.
The Founding of Stanford University.
We come now to the last and most impressive and important act of Sen
ator Stanford's remarkable career, â€”the founding of this great university,
when he said, "The children of California shall be my children." In this act
we associate the name of that true and faithful companion and devoted wife,
Jane Lathrop Stanford. The founding of this university was the blending of
the pride and glory of both of their lives, in a vision of higher needs and
deeper realities. For thirty-five years they had been co-workers in all of
the affairs of life, reaching out to noble works and generous deeds. But now,
in memory of their idolized son, they lovingly united in founding this institu
tion as a perpetual memorial to his youthful ambition to better the world by
education.
In January, 1885, Senator Stanford submitted to the legislature of this
state an act to advance learning, and the arts and sciences, by providing for
the foundation and endowment within the state of universities and other
institutions of learning. This act passed both houses of the legislature and
was approved by the Governor on March 9th, 1885, â€”twenty-nine years ago
to-day. This act was general in its terms in accordance with the constitu
tional requirement, but was intended to be and was in fact the foundation
of this university. It is a happy coincidence that we commemorate the birth
of the founder, Leland Stanford, and the foundation act, on the same day.
Selection of the First President.
The seection of the first president for this university was a matter of
very serious concern with Senator and Mrs. Stanford. Their ideal of a presi
dent was as exceptional and as exalted as their ideal of the institution they
were founding; and accordingly the whole field of eligible persons was thor
oughly canvassed, and the qualifications of each carefully weighed with re
spect to the immediate work of organization, as well as ability to project the
lines of future development. It was from such a process of weighing and
sifting that the selection fell upon that distinguished scientist and able
executive, David Starr Jordan.
Senator and Mrs. Stanford were very earnest and very laborious in the
effort to frame the outline of an institution whose teachings would be of the
highest character. They believed in the value of present knowledge, but they
also believed in the value of work expended in the discovery of new truths.
They believed in teaching the student how to thread his way through the
known regions of knowledge, but they also believed in extending the boun
daries of knowledge into the unexplored; that humanity might know and
possess its inheritance. An institution to correspond to such a plan must
necessarily be a growth, the result of the slow process of evolution.
"Every true man," says Emerson, "is a cause, a country and an age;
requires infinite spaces and numbers and time fully to accomplish his design."
We look upon this university in that light, and behold it in the process
of development reflecting the spirit and purpose of its founders. We see
now the university taking its place as a force in the march of progress, ad
vancing the standards of skill and efficiency, and equipping explorers for new
fields of knowledge in the search for truth. We see it working out its des
tiny in promoting "the public welfare by exercising an influence in behalf
of humanity and civilization, teaching the blessings of liberty regulated by
law, inculcating love and reverence for the great principles of government
as derived from the inalienable rights of man to life, liberty and the pursuit
of. happiness."
We assemble here to-day to recall these works, revive the prophetic
vision of the founders; and pay our tribute of respect to the genius of the
builders who, building as they knew, built for all time.
The Founders' Day address deliv
ered this morning by Judge William
W. Morrow conies from an especially
authentic source, and constitutes the
j most elaborate memorial to Senator
Stanford yet attempted. For this
reason a desire has been expressed
that it be preserved in permanent
| form, and it is accordingly printed
almost in full.
The invitation I had the pleasure
|of receiving from the Faculty Com
: inittee to deliver the Founders' Day
address on this occasion came with
the suggestion that I should speak
from my personal knowledge of the

life and public services of Senator
Leland Stanford. The suggestion
was most acceptable, since it required
nothing more serious or exacting than
the recalling of events in the general
order of a narrative. This effort has
had a personal interest, and has
brought to my mind many interesting
associations connected with the pub
lic affairs of this state and nation, in
which Senator Stanford was a promi
nent figure, and which 1 think illus
trate in a marked degree his original
ity, courage and strength of char
acter.
My acquaintance with Leland Stan
ford covered a period of more than
thirty years, and during part of that
time my relations with him were of
such a nature that phases of his char
acter were brought under my obser
vation that made me know him as a
most unique, independent and com
manding personality.


Judge William \\. Morrow
He was born at Watervliet, New York, on March 9th, 1824 â€”ninety years
ago to-day. Watervliet is about eight miles above Albany, on the Hudson
River. Ilis father was of English stock, with Irish blood in his veins. This
was a combination from which we might expect an individual possessed of
vigorous Qualities of mind and body, coupled with courage and sound judg
ment, and balanced with a strain of quaint, happy humor. These qualities
do in fact appear to have been inherited in full vigor by the sou. The father
was a farmer, and for a time at least a railroad contractor. These parental
occupations must have given the son an early practical view of the affairs
of life and a habit of constant sell' reliance that would be likely to grow into
marked independence of judgment and will.
We start then with heredity, environment and an early experience favora
ble to the future efficiency and independence of the son, who had, moreover,
the advantage of a good, practical education. He studied law and was ad
mitted to the bar in IS4B. In that year lie yielded to the spirit of the day
and moved west to Port Washington, Wisconsin, where he practiced law. He
visited his New York home in 1850 and was there married to Miss .lane La
throp, and returned with his wife to Port Washington. In 1552 a fire de
stroyed his law library and household effects. This misfortune caused him
to consider the advantage of going still further west, and as a result he came
to California. He left his wife with her father in Albany, New York, and
reached California in July, 1552. He visited his brothers who were engaged
in a general merchandise business in Sacramento, and soon after he entered
into the same business for himself at Cold Springs, in Eldorado County. In
1853 he opened a store at Michigan Bluffs, in Placer County,a very prosperous
mining section, and lie also engaged in mining and was highly successlul.
In 1855 he purchased the business of his brothers in Sacramento and the
same year returned cast and brought Mrs. Stanford to California and estab
lished his home at Sacramento.
An Original Republican.
He was an original Republican, and with a few others organized the
Republican Party in Sacramento in 1556. All Republicans were progressives
in those days, and correspondingly fearless. Senator Cole, in his memoirs,
speaking of the Republican Party in Sacramento at that time, says: "The
party at its inception was extremely limited in numbers"; that beside him
self there were "Leland Stanford, C. P. Huntington, Mark Hopkins, Edwin B.
and Charles Crocker, and that besides these there were not for some time as
many as could be counted on one's fingers." But this small party does not
appear to have been ignored by others in the community because of its lack
of numbers. Its members were denounced as agitators, disturbers of the
peace and traitors to the country. Violence against them was resorted to
occasionally, and efforts of intimidation often. Senator Colo gives the copy
of a public notice, printed in large type and posted about the City of Sacra
mento on May 13th, 1856. It was headed, "To Arms," and called upon "all
good citizens to attend a public meeting" at a place named "to devise means
to protect the public welfare by appointing a committee to hang all the leaders
and as many of the attaches of said traitors as may be deemed necessary
to restore the public quiet and put a stop to such treasonable practices."
This notice was understood to be directed against Mr. Stanford and his asso
ciates. It was probably nothing more than a species of intimidation; but
whatever its object it could not have been highly pleasant reading for those
to whom it referred. The historian fails to give us any further information
concerning the meeting. Nobody appears to have been hung; but we are leit
to infer that this little band of agitators followed Franklin's wise advice
given to the signers of the Declaration of Indpendence. They hung together
and thus escaped being hanged separately.
I do not mention these matters to recall ancient animosities, long since
forgiven and forgotten. Mr. Stanford was himself among the first to forgive
and forget, save the humor of some of the situations, to which he sometimes
referred; but T mention these incidents to show you the man in action under
circumstances and conditions calculated to test the strength of his physical
and moral fiber, and his ability to meet the passions and turbulence of a new
community fearlessly and with perfect equanimity.
In 1857 Mr. Stanford was the Republican candidate for state treasurer;
but the party was of such recent origin that its nominations were merely
matters of form to maintain the party organization. In 1859 he was the
nominee of his party for Governor. The Democratic Party was divided. One
wing, being known as the Lecompton Party, nominated a ticket with Mr.
Latham as candidate for Governor, and the other wing, or Anti-Lecompton
Party, nominated a ticket with Judge John Curry for that office. There was
a natural tendency for the latter party to unite with the Republican Party,
as it subsequently did; but at this time there were influences at work in
favor of the Republican Party withdrawing from the field. Horace Greeley,
the editor of the New York Tribune, a man of distinction, and the foremost
Republican in the United States, arrived in California in the summer of 1559.
lie was everywhere received with the greatest enthusiasm and accorded every
consideration. Tie made a number of speeches in the state, and, regarding
himself as entitled by his position to advise Republicans as to their duty, he
proposed that they should withdraw their ticket and support the Anti-Le
compton Party.
The proposition was submitted to Mr. Stanford. His reply was charac
teristic of the man. He declined to withdraw, maintaining with firmness that
it was the duty of the Republican Party to stand by its principles whatever
the result. He preferred to go down to defeat rather than to surrender to
an opposing party the standard placed in his hands by his political friends
and supporters. He was not a mere office seeker. He was charged with the
duty of preserving the integrity of a party organization, and he would per
form that duty. Like Mr. Lincoln he would not be the last to desert. He
would not desert at all. He was defeated at the polls, but be demonstrated
to the people of the state that he was not a weak or an uncertain leader.
He was again nominated for Governor in 1861, and it was in this cam
paign that 1 first became acquainted with him. T was then located at Santa
Rosa. I was anxious to hear him, although I was not then a voter. I had
come to California two years before from the state of Illinois, where political
questions occupied the public mind to the exclusion of almost every other
subject. I had heard such public speakers as Lincoln, Douglass, Trumbull,
Browning and many others of their type. These were all rugged men of dis
tinguished ability, combined with great force of character. Coming here
from such a field of political discussion, my first impression of California
speakers was a disappointment. They seemed to me to be lacking in force
and in an understanding of national questions. I inquired for the joint de

bates between candidates, with which I had been familiar, and the keen dis
cussion of such national questions as the Missouri Compromise, the Dred
Scott decision, and the Leconipton Constitution. In Illinois the discussion
of political questions was about the only diversion the people had, and they
were accustomed to hear public speakers gifted with the force of persuasive
eloquence. It seemed to me that the California speakers did not measure up
to the standard we had in Illinois; but I was told to be patient until I heard
such speakers as Colonel E. D. Baker, Frederick P. Tracy, Thomas Starr
King, Thomas Fitch, Henry Edgerton, and other orators of repute. I soon
heard these speakers, and while they had culture of a high order, they lacked
the plain homely frontier character of the middle west. But I soon became
convinced that there were political orators in California as well as in Illinois.
Incidentally it may be said that Colonel Baker, the greatest orator of modern
times, was from Illinois and had been an associate of Mr. Lincoln. He had
been trained in the Illinois school of political discussion, and was a master
of the art. He was a soldier, orator and statesman.
While I was in this state of curiosity about the public speakers of the
state, Mr. Stanford was advertised to speak in Santa Rosa on the issues of
the day. lie was a leader of the new party, based upon a new and an untried
platform of principles. The political sentiment of that place at that time
was decidedly unfriendly to the new party and its candidates. Mr. Stanford
was received respectfully, but not enthusiastically. His personal appearance
was impressive. He was then thirty-seven years of age, large of frame, with
a swarthy complexion and something of the plain rugged features of the
frontiersman. He was dignified in manner, with a peculiarly attractive com
posure. His voice was melodious and pleasant; his language clear and ex
pressive. He was listened to by a large audience with respectful interest.
He wasted no time on immaterial questions but went directly into the issues
of the campaign. The platform of the party had declared in favor of the com
mon school system, and insisted that it should be sustained in all of its es
sential features, and its benefits and efficiency extended. The platform also
declared in favor of distributing the public lands of the United States to
homestead settlers, and pledged the party to aid the immediate construction
of a transcontinental railroad. The platform declared further that the Re
publicans of California pledged themselves, and all they had, to sustain the
national administration at Washington. Mr. Lincoln had been elected in the
previous November, and on the fourth of March had been inaugurated Presi
dent. Mr. Stanford had been a delegate from California to the National Re
publican Convention that had placed Mr. Lincoln in nomination, and had ad
vocated his election. He was the President's friend and adviser, and the two
men had much that was in common.
In Mr. Stanford's speech on the occasion to which I refer, he discussed
the platform of the party and declared his adherence to its principles. He
spoke with the eloquence of an honest conviction. He believed that the public
school system was at the very foundation of our form of government; that
the public domain should be given freely to actual settlers for the building
of homes; that the Pacific Railroad should be built at the earliest possible
moment that the people of the Pacific Coast might have quick and ample com
munication with the east. He declared that he was doing and would continue
to do what he could to further the project; and in concluding he paid a
splendid and feeling tribute to the high character and patriotism of Mr. Lin
coln, and his administration, and its purpose to maintain the perpetuity of
the Union.
Elected Governor of California.
It is difficult now to understand how any of these questions could have
ever been a subject of serious discussion; but they were, and the discussions
were vigorous, sometimes violent. Mr. Stanford presented them in an able
and fearless manner in all of the principal localities of the state. He gained
the confidence of the people by his plain, straightforward speech and man
ner, and was elected by a large plurality. His term of office was for two
years. Having become president of the Central Pacific Railroad, then in
course of construction, he declined a renomination. During his term of
office as governor he gave the state a wise and an efficient administration
and was counted one of the "War Governors" of the nation, taking a place in
support of the national cause along side of such governors as Andrews of
Massachusetts, Washburn of Maine, Morgan of New York, Curtin of Penn
sylvania, Morton of Indiana, Yates of Illinois and Kirkwood of lowa.
In June, 1861, and ten days after Mr. Stanford had been nominated for
Governor, he and a few other citizens of Sacramento organized and incor
porated the Central Pacific Railroad Company, under the laws of the State
of California, with Mr. Stanford as the president of the corporation. Con
gress had not then passed the act to aid in the construction of the railroad
and telegraph line from the Missouri River to the Pacific Ocean. That act
was not passed until July Ist, 1562. It organized the Union Pacific Railroad
Company with an imposing array of stockholders, to build a railroad west
from the Missouri River to a connection with the Central Pacific Railroad of
California. Mr. Stanford's associates were not so conspicuous, but they were
men of ability and character. Among them were Theodore D. .ludah, a dis
tinguished engineer, C. P. Huntington, Mark Hopkins and Charles Crocker,
merchants of Sacramento. There were a few others, but these were the men
who afterwards became known in the construction of the road, and in the
affairs of the state and nation in connection with this enterprise.
The object of the corporation which these men formed was to construct
a railroad from Sacramento eastward on the line of the proposed transcon
tinental railroad, and on January Bth, 1563, Governor Stanford turned the
first spadeful of earth in Sacramento for its construction. At that time the
only railroads in the state were a short line from Sacramento to Polsom, a
distance of about twenty miles, and a partly constructed railroad from San
Francisco to San Jose. The construction of these two short lines had been
very-expensive, and were in fact a warning against the prosecution of an
other such enterprise at that time. Railroad iron, locomotives and other
rolling stock had to be brought from the east around the Horn in sailing
vessels; and the cost of all kinds of material was very high, and labor dear
and scarce.
Judge Morrow at this point eloquently told the graphic narrative of the
building of the Central Pacific railroad, showing the indomitable will with
which its construction was pushed forward. He discussed the incorporation
of the Southern Pacific and threatened competition from the Atlantic and
Pacific and Texas and Pacific roads, and continued:
In this way Governor Stanford and his associates met and blocked these
two roads coming from the east at the boundary line of the state, one tempo
rarily and the other permanently. The Atlantic and Pacific subsequently
purchased the Southern Pacific line from Mohave to the Needles, and the
Santa Fe, its successor, finally reached the Bay of San Francisco by an inde
pendent terminal at Point Richmond. The Texas Pacific railroad never
reached the Colorado River, but the Southern Pacific, building eastward from
Yuma, pushed on across Arizona and New Mexico, and met the Texas Pacific
at the Rio Grande, near El Paso, in the State of Texas.
Under another act of Congress passed in 1566, the Central Pacific rail
road, under the name of the California and Oregon railroad, was authorized
to build northward toward the Oregon lino to connect with another railroad
coming south from Portland, Oregon. This line was built and a road opened
to Portland.
Governor Stanford and his associates also acquired control of short lines
by which they reached the Bay of San Francisco from the Sacramento and
San Joaquin Valleys. They also built a line down the coast; and with all
these lines, connections and terminals they secured substantial control of
the transportation facilities of the state, and in 1885 they merged all of these
railroads under the control of the Southern Pacific Company.
I mention these matters to show with what determination, force and
ability these men pushed forward against formidable opposition, and in the
fact of difficulties obtained the substantial control of the transportation facili
ties of the state. It has been said that others could have done the same thing
with the same assistance in national bonds, land grants and other contribu
tions. The fact remains that others, with like opportunities, did not make
the effort, and that others failed, with the same opportunities, to carry to
successful completion, corresponding enterprises. Every transcontinental
railroad coming westward toward the coast, and with which the Central Pa
cific railroad or the Southern Pacific railroad was authorized to connect,
failed at one time or another to meet their financial obligations, and were
placed by the courts in the hands of receivers. Comparisons are odious, and
however tempting this one may be, it will not be carried further.
But it is a fair question to ask: What have been the financial operations
of the corporations involved in the Southern Pacific System? Have any of
these failed to meet their obligations? Have any of them been in the hands
of receivers? AVe find 110 such records. They appear to have paid their debts
at maturity, including the bonded debt and interest due to the United States
by the Central Pacific. Perhaps some credit may be due to Governor Stan
ford and his associates for so having managed these properties that all the
corporations under their control have maintained their financial integrity
from the first spadeful of earth turned 011 the Bth day of January, 1863, down
to the present time.
During all this time of construction, Governor Stanford continued at the
head of the corporations incorporated into this one controlling system. The
people and press of the state protested, and charged that a grasping monop
oly had been formed to appropriate the transportation facilities of the state.
It was insisted that competitive transcontinental lines should be admitted
into tlie state and competition in freight and passen&ei lates seemed.
Governor Stanford and his associates proceeded upon the theory that
whatever monopoly there was in the Southern Pacific system was for the
best interests of the state; that what the state needed was the development
of its extensive and valuable resources, and that to do this it was impera
tive that railroad transportation be extended to all points of the state where
business would justify it, either presently or prospectively; that one cor
poration or one system, witli its connecting lines and terminals, could do
this better and cheaper than several; that additional transcontinental lines
would not be competitive, and would not confer the benefits that were ex
pected by the public.
During the time Governor Stanford and his associates continued in con
trol of the Southern Pacific System they never wavered in their adherence
to this policy Neither did the press nor the public, until very recently,
abandon their opposition to that policy. The Santa Pc came into the state as
a competing road for business, but not with respect to rates foi fi eight and
fares, which now became matters for the Interstate Commerce Commission
and the State Railroad Commission.
This question of railroad competition now comes up 111 a legal aspect.
The Federal Government had submitted to the courts the question whether
the merging of the Central Pacific and its terminals, into the Southern Pa
cific System, is a monopoly in restraint of trade and commerce in violation
of the Sherman Anti-trust Law. This action 011 the part of the government
is now being vigorously resisted by substantially the entiic business inteiesls
of the state, upon the ground that the merging of these connecting lines and
terminal facilities twenty-nine years ago was for the best interests of the
people of this state, and is so now. The farseeing policy that constructed
this system is now approved by the public, and the policy ot Goveinoi Stan
ford and his associates in extending and developing the Southern Pacific
System from ISGS to 18S5 is now the declared policy of the people of the state
of California in dealing with this transcontinental transportation question.
Upon the legal question I express no opinion, but upon the question of policy
I have the opinion of a citizen that the present situation should not be
disturbed.
All Advocnte of Educational Legislation.
I come now to a period of a very different character, when my relations
with Governor Stanford became official, personal and in some respects quite
intimate. In January, ISBS, Governor Stanford was elected by the legislature
of the state to the United States Senate for the term of six years commencing
on March 4, 18S5. I had been elected in November, 18S4, to the House of
Representatives from the San Francisco District, for the term of two years
commencing also 011 March 4, 1885. By reelection I served six years in the
House of Representatives, from 1885 to 1891.
During this time it was customary for Senator Stanford to have frequent
conferences at his house with the California members of the House of Repre
sentatives concerning California matters. These conferences were nearly
always interesting, and sometimes amusing,â€”interesting because they either
related to some matter of legislation before Congress, or something pending
before one or more of the departments in which important interests of the
state were concerned, â€”amusing because of the extraordinary demands made
upon the Senators and members of Congress by their constituents, â€”from
turnip seeds and popcorn to patents for nutmeg graters and flying machines.
We speak of public officials as public servants, but we never use that term
with so much accuracy and feeling as when we apply it to Senators or Repre
sentatives in Congress. They are public servants, practically as well as
theoretically, with only one substantial privilege at their service,â€”and that
is to make speeches in the Congressional Record and send them free through
the mail to their constituents. Senator Stanford never availed himself of
this privilege. He was an efficient, conscientious public servant, performing
all his duties faithfully and cheerfully. He never complained of the burden
of small and often trifling demands.
One of the first subjects of national importance to engage his attention
was that of education, in which he was deeply interested. A bill had been
introduced in Congress by Senator Blair of New Hampshire to aid in the
establishment and temporary support of the common schools. The bill pro
vided for the distribution of seventy-seven millions of dollars among the
several states and territories in proportion to the illiteracy in each state or
territory. The distribution was to be in installments covering a period of
eight years. The bill was fully discussed by the leading senators. In the
course of the debate, on February 25, 1890, Senator Stanford delivered a
speech in support of the bill in which he said some pertinent things about
education: â€”
"In my opinion." said he, "our government can have no higher object
than to secure to the people a high degree of intelligence, thereby assisting
them to the attainment of the possibilities of humanity. Those possibilities
and the beneficence of the Creator to man on earth are one and the same,
for it is obvious that there could be no beneficence in the unattainable. Had
we been given reasonable wants without the means of gratifying them, the
Creator's beneficence would be a failure.
"But when we look around at the sources of supply for our wants,
whether physical or intellectual, we find them inexhaustibly supplied in the
soil, waters, forests, mines and quarries. The raw material is everywhere
within our reach, requiring only the intelligent application of labor and the
control of the forces of nature. How this labor is to be supplied, and this
control obtained, is what education will teach."
He believed in education of the masses, and he particularly favored the

bill then under consideration because it provided for the education of both
sexes alike for their respective callings. He believed in the early education
of the child for the moral influence it would have in forming his character
and in laying the foundation for his future efficiency. He believed in educat
ing all classes for the active duties of life, and for the deeper insight it gave
into nature, and the greater knowledge of her wonderful forces, which, being
understood, developed and brought under control, would enable humanity to
realize the glorious destiny marked out for it by the Creator.
The bill which he was then supporting was defeated, mainly, as I recall,
on constitutional grounds. But he supported other educational bills which
became laws, notably bills in aid of state agricultural colleges, providing for
experimental stations, and a more thorough training in agricultural pursuits.
He was himself an agriculturalist on a large scale, and with his extensive
land holdings he naturally took a practical interest in the industry. But his
interest was much more than personal. He viewed the production of the soil
from the standpoint of the nation's welfare, and believed that the nation might
increase its wealth enormously by the introduction of intelligent, economical
methods.
A Pioneer Advocate of Land Loan Laws.
He accordingly proposed a scheme for government loans on real estate,
which should have the double purpose of furnishing the country with an
elastic currency of sufficient volume to meet its requirements, and at the
same time supply the farmer with money at a low rate of interest to meet
the necessities of his calling, and make agriculture profitable and attractive.
The scheme was a bold one, but it was one in which Senator Stanford had the
utmost confidence, and he was astonished that it did not receive general ap
proval. I think the greatest disappointment he suffered during his senatorial
career was his failure to secure any general support for this bill.
In view of recent legislation, it would seem that his failure was due
mainly to the fact that he was at least twenty years in advance of the times.
Senator Stanford was essentially a progressive, and he was generally a
pioneer in whatever he undertook, whether it was the formation of a political
party, building a railroad, developing some new industry, or founding a Uni
versity. He could see well into the future, and he usually saw his efforts
successful; but in this instance lie did not see his scheme adopted. Now,
I am not going to discuss this financial question in any great detail. Mr.
Gladstone is reported to have said in a debate in the British House of Com
mons concerning some financial measure before it, that there were two roads
rÂ»ilroad timetable, and the other was the study of the principles of banking
and currency. For your sakes as well as for my own, I shall touch but lightly
upon this financial question.
But a few words of explanation are necessary to understand the full
scope and purposes of Senator Stanford's scheme: â€”
The speaker now explained the scope and purpose of Senator Stanford's
scheme, and the financial situation preceding the panic of 1893.
While this financial storm was brewing, Senator Stanford brought for
ward his land loan scheme. He first introduced a resolution in the Senate,
on March 10th, 1890, instructing the finance committee of that body to report
what relief might be provided by the United States government for the strin
gency in the money market, and particularly whether loans might be made
by the government upon mortgages. This resolution failed to receive any
consideration. On May 20th, IS9O, he introduced a bill entitled, "A bill to
provide the government with means sufficient to supply the national govern
ment with a sound circulating medium." This bill provided that the treasurer
of the United States should cause to be printed notes of the United States
to the amount of one hundred millions of dollars, and such additional amounts
from time to time as should be necessary to meet the requirements of the
act. These notes were to be a legal tender for all private and certain public
debts, and were to be loaned on unincumbered agricultural land upon interest
at the rate of two per cent per annum. A loan was not to exceed one half
of the assessed value of the land and for a term of not to exceed twenty
years. No loan was to be for a sum less than $250. The bill provided for a
bureau in the treasury department to administer the provisions of the act.
A few days after the introduction of this bill Senator Stanford made a
speech in its support in which he explained its provisions, and contended
that the plan of loaning money upon land at two per cent, with the privilege
to the borrower of returning it when he had no use for it, would create a
money system that would meet financial expansions and contractions as they
might occur. He did not claim, however, that his bill had been perfected in
detail. What he did claim was that the principle of loaning the credit of
the nation upon sufficient security, to those who needed it, should be ex
tended to the farmers on the security of real estate as had already been done
to the national banks on the security of United States bonds, and that the
financial condition of the country urgently required legislation to that end.
The bill was referred to the Senate Committee on Finance. That committee,
composed it must be said, of able and experienced statesmen, reported on
tfc bill adversely, classifying the proposed scheme with a number of others in
this country and elsewhere that had operated disastrously. The committee
held the bill to be bad in substance, and unconstitutional. Upon this report
the bill was indefinitely postponed.
In January, 1891, Senator Stanford was re-elected to the Senate for a
second term of six years, and be again introduced his land loan bill with
another bill placing the scheme squarely upon a gold basis. In January, 1892,
he made another and more elaborate speech in its support, at the same time
replying to the adverse report of the Finance Committee made in the previous
Congress. He was now thoroughly aroused and defended bis scheme with
great force. A Kansas Senator came to his support, and it looked as though
the bill was about to be considered on its merits, and amended so as to pro
vide against the possibility of an inflated currency. The bill was pending
in the Senate at the time of Senator Stanford's death on June 21st, 1593.
Senator Stanford Eulogized.
At the memorial exercises in the United States Senate on September 16,
1593, and in the House of Representatives on February 12, 1894, the members
of both houses paid feeling tributes to the life and character of Senator Stan
ford. The address of Senator Daniel of Virginia, in particular, was very im
pressive by reason of the eloquent and feeling personality of his remarks.
He referred to the land loan bill in terms that corresponded so nearly with
my own experience that I venture to repeat them here:â€”
"He (Senator Stanford) had some ideas which he was never able to im
press upon his associates as being practicable, among them liis idea of lend
ing vast amounts of money upon land. I have talked with him for hours and
hours upon repeated occasions on that theme, and he often urged me to adopt
his views and advocate them. I could neever see that they were practicable,
and with all my respect for him and desire to meet his wishes T could not,
of course, comply with his request. Yet let me say that beneath the difficul
ties which present themselves to such an idea as he had formed, there are
in it germs of truth and wisdom such as are found in the first evolutions of
invention, which, in a later and riper day of the world's history, may be de
veloped into much that is attainable and good. ... As the world's pop
ulation shall increase, and as financial refinements and facilities shall be
developed, there will be found in this idea much to build upon, and in the
end probably some ripe consummation."
How gracious and candid this was: This was twenty years ago. We have
experienced some squally financial times since then. The period commenced
with the panic of 1893 and included the panic of 1907: but the country has
made substantial progress in its financial system during this time, and in
the direction of Senator Stanford's scheme. This progress will be found in
the recent act of December 23, 1913, providing for reserve banks and an
elastic currency, with gold as the standard of values. Mr. Horace White,
the well known editor and financial expert, writing of this act in the North
American Review, says: â€”
"Twenty years was required to prepare public opinion, including that of
bankers and congressmen, for the adoption of asset currency in the place of
bond currency."
Judge Morrow proceeded to show that present financial legislation rests
upon the basic principle of Senator Stanford's land loan bill.
The Founding of Stanford University.
We come now to the last and most impressive and important act of Sen
ator Stanford's remarkable career, â€”the founding of this great university,
when he said, "The children of California shall be my children." In this act
we associate the name of that true and faithful companion and devoted wife,
Jane Lathrop Stanford. The founding of this university was the blending of
the pride and glory of both of their lives, in a vision of higher needs and
deeper realities. For thirty-five years they had been co-workers in all of
the affairs of life, reaching out to noble works and generous deeds. But now,
in memory of their idolized son, they lovingly united in founding this institu
tion as a perpetual memorial to his youthful ambition to better the world by
education.
In January, 1885, Senator Stanford submitted to the legislature of this
state an act to advance learning, and the arts and sciences, by providing for
the foundation and endowment within the state of universities and other
institutions of learning. This act passed both houses of the legislature and
was approved by the Governor on March 9th, 1885, â€”twenty-nine years ago
to-day. This act was general in its terms in accordance with the constitu
tional requirement, but was intended to be and was in fact the foundation
of this university. It is a happy coincidence that we commemorate the birth
of the founder, Leland Stanford, and the foundation act, on the same day.
Selection of the First President.
The seection of the first president for this university was a matter of
very serious concern with Senator and Mrs. Stanford. Their ideal of a presi
dent was as exceptional and as exalted as their ideal of the institution they
were founding; and accordingly the whole field of eligible persons was thor
oughly canvassed, and the qualifications of each carefully weighed with re
spect to the immediate work of organization, as well as ability to project the
lines of future development. It was from such a process of weighing and
sifting that the selection fell upon that distinguished scientist and able
executive, David Starr Jordan.
Senator and Mrs. Stanford were very earnest and very laborious in the
effort to frame the outline of an institution whose teachings would be of the
highest character. They believed in the value of present knowledge, but they
also believed in the value of work expended in the discovery of new truths.
They believed in teaching the student how to thread his way through the
known regions of knowledge, but they also believed in extending the boun
daries of knowledge into the unexplored; that humanity might know and
possess its inheritance. An institution to correspond to such a plan must
necessarily be a growth, the result of the slow process of evolution.
"Every true man," says Emerson, "is a cause, a country and an age;
requires infinite spaces and numbers and time fully to accomplish his design."
We look upon this university in that light, and behold it in the process
of development reflecting the spirit and purpose of its founders. We see
now the university taking its place as a force in the march of progress, ad
vancing the standards of skill and efficiency, and equipping explorers for new
fields of knowledge in the search for truth. We see it working out its des
tiny in promoting "the public welfare by exercising an influence in behalf
of humanity and civilization, teaching the blessings of liberty regulated by
law, inculcating love and reverence for the great principles of government
as derived from the inalienable rights of man to life, liberty and the pursuit
of. happiness."
We assemble here to-day to recall these works, revive the prophetic
vision of the founders; and pay our tribute of respect to the genius of the
builders who, building as they knew, built for all time.
The Founders' Day address deliv
ered this morning by Judge William
W. Morrow conies from an especially
authentic source, and constitutes the
j most elaborate memorial to Senator
Stanford yet attempted. For this
reason a desire has been expressed
that it be preserved in permanent
| form, and it is accordingly printed
almost in full.
The invitation I had the pleasure
|of receiving from the Faculty Com
: inittee to deliver the Founders' Day
address on this occasion came with
the suggestion that I should speak
from my personal knowledge of the

life and public services of Senator
Leland Stanford. The suggestion
was most acceptable, since it required
nothing more serious or exacting than
the recalling of events in the general
order of a narrative. This effort has
had a personal interest, and has
brought to my mind many interesting
associations connected with the pub
lic affairs of this state and nation, in
which Senator Stanford was a promi
nent figure, and which 1 think illus
trate in a marked degree his original
ity, courage and strength of char
acter.
My acquaintance with Leland Stan
ford covered a period of more than
thirty years, and during part of that
time my relations with him were of
such a nature that phases of his char
acter were brought under my obser
vation that made me know him as a
most unique, independent and com
manding personality.


Judge William \\. Morrow
He was born at Watervliet, New York, on March 9th, 1824 â€”ninety years
ago to-day. Watervliet is about eight miles above Albany, on the Hudson
River. Ilis father was of English stock, with Irish blood in his veins. This
was a combination from which we might expect an individual possessed of
vigorous Qualities of mind and body, coupled with courage and sound judg
ment, and balanced with a strain of quaint, happy humor. These qualities
do in fact appear to have been inherited in full vigor by the sou. The father
was a farmer, and for a time at least a railroad contractor. These parental
occupations must have given the son an early practical view of the affairs
of life and a habit of constant sell' reliance that would be likely to grow into
marked independence of judgment and will.
We start then with heredity, environment and an early experience favora
ble to the future efficiency and independence of the son, who had, moreover,
the advantage of a good, practical education. He studied law and was ad
mitted to the bar in IS4B. In that year lie yielded to the spirit of the day
and moved west to Port Washington, Wisconsin, where he practiced law. He
visited his New York home in 1850 and was there married to Miss .lane La
throp, and returned with his wife to Port Washington. In 1552 a fire de
stroyed his law library and household effects. This misfortune caused him
to consider the advantage of going still further west, and as a result he came
to California. He left his wife with her father in Albany, New York, and
reached California in July, 1552. He visited his brothers who were engaged
in a general merchandise business in Sacramento, and soon after he entered
into the same business for himself at Cold Springs, in Eldorado County. In
1853 he opened a store at Michigan Bluffs, in Placer County,a very prosperous
mining section, and lie also engaged in mining and was highly successlul.
In 1855 he purchased the business of his brothers in Sacramento and the
same year returned cast and brought Mrs. Stanford to California and estab
lished his home at Sacramento.
An Original Republican.
He was an original Republican, and with a few others organized the
Republican Party in Sacramento in 1556. All Republicans were progressives
in those days, and correspondingly fearless. Senator Cole, in his memoirs,
speaking of the Republican Party in Sacramento at that time, says: "The
party at its inception was extremely limited in numbers"; that beside him
self there were "Leland Stanford, C. P. Huntington, Mark Hopkins, Edwin B.
and Charles Crocker, and that besides these there were not for some time as
many as could be counted on one's fingers." But this small party does not
appear to have been ignored by others in the community because of its lack
of numbers. Its members were denounced as agitators, disturbers of the
peace and traitors to the country. Violence against them was resorted to
occasionally, and efforts of intimidation often. Senator Colo gives the copy
of a public notice, printed in large type and posted about the City of Sacra
mento on May 13th, 1856. It was headed, "To Arms," and called upon "all
good citizens to attend a public meeting" at a place named "to devise means
to protect the public welfare by appointing a committee to hang all the leaders
and as many of the attaches of said traitors as may be deemed necessary
to restore the public quiet and put a stop to such treasonable practices."
This notice was understood to be directed against Mr. Stanford and his asso
ciates. It was probably nothing more than a species of intimidation; but
whatever its object it could not have been highly pleasant reading for those
to whom it referred. The historian fails to give us any further information
concerning the meeting. Nobody appears to have been hung; but we are leit
to infer that this little band of agitators followed Franklin's wise advice
given to the signers of the Declaration of Indpendence. They hung together
and thus escaped being hanged separately.
I do not mention these matters to recall ancient animosities, long since
forgiven and forgotten. Mr. Stanford was himself among the first to forgive
and forget, save the humor of some of the situations, to which he sometimes
referred; but T mention these incidents to show you the man in action under
circumstances and conditions calculated to test the strength of his physical
and moral fiber, and his ability to meet the passions and turbulence of a new
community fearlessly and with perfect equanimity.
In 1857 Mr. Stanford was the Republican candidate for state treasurer;
but the party was of such recent origin that its nominations were merely
matters of form to maintain the party organization. In 1859 he was the
nominee of his party for Governor. The Democratic Party was divided. One
wing, being known as the Lecompton Party, nominated a ticket with Mr.
Latham as candidate for Governor, and the other wing, or Anti-Lecompton
Party, nominated a ticket with Judge John Curry for that office. There was
a natural tendency for the latter party to unite with the Republican Party,
as it subsequently did; but at this time there were influences at work in
favor of the Republican Party withdrawing from the field. Horace Greeley,
the editor of the New York Tribune, a man of distinction, and the foremost
Republican in the United States, arrived in California in the summer of 1559.
lie was everywhere received with the greatest enthusiasm and accorded every
consideration. Tie made a number of speeches in the state, and, regarding
himself as entitled by his position to advise Republicans as to their duty, he
proposed that they should withdraw their ticket and support the Anti-Le
compton Party.
The proposition was submitted to Mr. Stanford. His reply was charac
teristic of the man. He declined to withdraw, maintaining with firmness that
it was the duty of the Republican Party to stand by its principles whatever
the result. He preferred to go down to defeat rather than to surrender to
an opposing party the standard placed in his hands by his political friends
and supporters. He was not a mere office seeker. He was charged with the
duty of preserving the integrity of a party organization, and he would per
form that duty. Like Mr. Lincoln he would not be the last to desert. He
would not desert at all. He was defeated at the polls, but be demonstrated
to the people of the state that he was not a weak or an uncertain leader.
He was again nominated for Governor in 1861, and it was in this cam
paign that 1 first became acquainted with him. T was then located at Santa
Rosa. I was anxious to hear him, although I was not then a voter. I had
come to California two years before from the state of Illinois, where political
questions occupied the public mind to the exclusion of almost every other
subject. I had heard such public speakers as Lincoln, Douglass, Trumbull,
Browning and many others of their type. These were all rugged men of dis
tinguished ability, combined with great force of character. Coming here
from such a field of political discussion, my first impression of California
speakers was a disappointment. They seemed to me to be lacking in force
and in an understanding of national questions. I inquired for the joint de

bates between candidates, with which I had been familiar, and the keen dis
cussion of such national questions as the Missouri Compromise, the Dred
Scott decision, and the Leconipton Constitution. In Illinois the discussion
of political questions was about the only diversion the people had, and they
were accustomed to hear public speakers gifted with the force of persuasive
eloquence. It seemed to me that the California speakers did not measure up
to the standard we had in Illinois; but I was told to be patient until I heard
such speakers as Colonel E. D. Baker, Frederick P. Tracy, Thomas Starr
King, Thomas Fitch, Henry Edgerton, and other orators of repute. I soon
heard these speakers, and while they had culture of a high order, they lacked
the plain homely frontier character of the middle west. But I soon became
convinced that there were political orators in California as well as in Illinois.
Incidentally it may be said that Colonel Baker, the greatest orator of modern
times, was from Illinois and had been an associate of Mr. Lincoln. He had
been trained in the Illinois school of political discussion, and was a master
of the art. He was a soldier, orator and statesman.
While I was in this state of curiosity about the public speakers of the
state, Mr. Stanford was advertised to speak in Santa Rosa on the issues of
the day. lie was a leader of the new party, based upon a new and an untried
platform of principles. The political sentiment of that place at that time
was decidedly unfriendly to the new party and its candidates. Mr. Stanford
was received respectfully, but not enthusiastically. His personal appearance
was impressive. He was then thirty-seven years of age, large of frame, with
a swarthy complexion and something of the plain rugged features of the
frontiersman. He was dignified in manner, with a peculiarly attractive com
posure. His voice was melodious and pleasant; his language clear and ex
pressive. He was listened to by a large audience with respectful interest.
He wasted no time on immaterial questions but went directly into the issues
of the campaign. The platform of the party had declared in favor of the com
mon school system, and insisted that it should be sustained in all of its es
sential features, and its benefits and efficiency extended. The platform also
declared in favor of distributing the public lands of the United States to
homestead settlers, and pledged the party to aid the immediate construction
of a transcontinental railroad. The platform declared further that the Re
publicans of California pledged themselves, and all they had, to sustain the
national administration at Washington. Mr. Lincoln had been elected in the
previous November, and on the fourth of March had been inaugurated Presi
dent. Mr. Stanford had been a delegate from California to the National Re
publican Convention that had placed Mr. Lincoln in nomination, and had ad
vocated his election. He was the President's friend and adviser, and the two
men had much that was in common.
In Mr. Stanford's speech on the occasion to which I refer, he discussed
the platform of the party and declared his adherence to its principles. He
spoke with the eloquence of an honest conviction. He believed that the public
school system was at the very foundation of our form of government; that
the public domain should be given freely to actual settlers for the building
of homes; that the Pacific Railroad should be built at the earliest possible
moment that the people of the Pacific Coast might have quick and ample com
munication with the east. He declared that he was doing and would continue
to do what he could to further the project; and in concluding he paid a
splendid and feeling tribute to the high character and patriotism of Mr. Lin
coln, and his administration, and its purpose to maintain the perpetuity of
the Union.
Elected Governor of California.
It is difficult now to understand how any of these questions could have
ever been a subject of serious discussion; but they were, and the discussions
were vigorous, sometimes violent. Mr. Stanford presented them in an able
and fearless manner in all of the principal localities of the state. He gained
the confidence of the people by his plain, straightforward speech and man
ner, and was elected by a large plurality. His term of office was for two
years. Having become president of the Central Pacific Railroad, then in
course of construction, he declined a renomination. During his term of
office as governor he gave the state a wise and an efficient administration
and was counted one of the "War Governors" of the nation, taking a place in
support of the national cause along side of such governors as Andrews of
Massachusetts, Washburn of Maine, Morgan of New York, Curtin of Penn
sylvania, Morton of Indiana, Yates of Illinois and Kirkwood of lowa.
In June, 1861, and ten days after Mr. Stanford had been nominated for
Governor, he and a few other citizens of Sacramento organized and incor
porated the Central Pacific Railroad Company, under the laws of the State
of California, with Mr. Stanford as the president of the corporation. Con
gress had not then passed the act to aid in the construction of the railroad
and telegraph line from the Missouri River to the Pacific Ocean. That act
was not passed until July Ist, 1562. It organized the Union Pacific Railroad
Company with an imposing array of stockholders, to build a railroad west
from the Missouri River to a connection with the Central Pacific Railroad of
California. Mr. Stanford's associates were not so conspicuous, but they were
men of ability and character. Among them were Theodore D. .ludah, a dis
tinguished engineer, C. P. Huntington, Mark Hopkins and Charles Crocker,
merchants of Sacramento. There were a few others, but these were the men
who afterwards became known in the construction of the road, and in the
affairs of the state and nation in connection with this enterprise.
The object of the corporation which these men formed was to construct
a railroad from Sacramento eastward on the line of the proposed transcon
tinental railroad, and on January Bth, 1563, Governor Stanford turned the
first spadeful of earth in Sacramento for its construction. At that time the
only railroads in the state were a short line from Sacramento to Polsom, a
distance of about twenty miles, and a partly constructed railroad from San
Francisco to San Jose. The construction of these two short lines had been
very-expensive, and were in fact a warning against the prosecution of an
other such enterprise at that time. Railroad iron, locomotives and other
rolling stock had to be brought from the east around the Horn in sailing
vessels; and the cost of all kinds of material was very high, and labor dear
and scarce.
Judge Morrow at this point eloquently told the graphic narrative of the
building of the Central Pacific railroad, showing the indomitable will with
which its construction was pushed forward. He discussed the incorporation
of the Southern Pacific and threatened competition from the Atlantic and
Pacific and Texas and Pacific roads, and continued:
In this way Governor Stanford and his associates met and blocked these
two roads coming from the east at the boundary line of the state, one tempo
rarily and the other permanently. The Atlantic and Pacific subsequently
purchased the Southern Pacific line from Mohave to the Needles, and the
Santa Fe, its successor, finally reached the Bay of San Francisco by an inde
pendent terminal at Point Richmond. The Texas Pacific railroad never
reached the Colorado River, but the Southern Pacific, building eastward from
Yuma, pushed on across Arizona and New Mexico, and met the Texas Pacific
at the Rio Grande, near El Paso, in the State of Texas.
Under another act of Congress passed in 1566, the Central Pacific rail
road, under the name of the California and Oregon railroad, was authorized
to build northward toward the Oregon lino to connect with another railroad
coming south from Portland, Oregon. This line was built and a road opened
to Portland.
Governor Stanford and his associates also acquired control of short lines
by which they reached the Bay of San Francisco from the Sacramento and
San Joaquin Valleys. They also built a line down the coast; and with all
these lines, connections and terminals they secured substantial control of
the transportation facilities of the state, and in 1885 they merged all of these
railroads under the control of the Southern Pacific Company.
I mention these matters to show with what determination, force and
ability these men pushed forward against formidable opposition, and in the
fact of difficulties obtained the substantial control of the transportation facili
ties of the state. It has been said that others could have done the same thing
with the same assistance in national bonds, land grants and other contribu
tions. The fact remains that others, with like opportunities, did not make
the effort, and that others failed, with the same opportunities, to carry to
successful completion, corresponding enterprises. Every transcontinental
railroad coming westward toward the coast, and with which the Central Pa
cific railroad or the Southern Pacific railroad was authorized to connect,
failed at one time or another to meet their financial obligations, and were
placed by the courts in the hands of receivers. Comparisons are odious, and
however tempting this one may be, it will not be carried further.
But it is a fair question to ask: What have been the financial operations
of the corporations involved in the Southern Pacific System? Have any of
these failed to meet their obligations? Have any of them been in the hands
of receivers? AVe find 110 such records. They appear to have paid their debts
at maturity, including the bonded debt and interest due to the United States
by the Central Pacific. Perhaps some credit may be due to Governor Stan
ford and his associates for so having managed these properties that all the
corporations under their control have maintained their financial integrity
from the first spadeful of earth turned 011 the Bth day of January, 1863, down
to the present time.
During all this time of construction, Governor Stanford continued at the
head of the corporations incorporated into this one controlling system. The
people and press of the state protested, and charged that a grasping monop
oly had been formed to appropriate the transportation facilities of the state.
It was insisted that competitive transcontinental lines should be admitted
into tlie state and competition in freight and passen&ei lates seemed.
Governor Stanford and his associates proceeded upon the theory that
whatever monopoly there was in the Southern Pacific system was for the
best interests of the state; that what the state needed was the development
of its extensive and valuable resources, and that to do this it was impera
tive that railroad transportation be extended to all points of the state where
business would justify it, either presently or prospectively; that one cor
poration or one system, witli its connecting lines and terminals, could do
this better and cheaper than several; that additional transcontinental lines
would not be competitive, and would not confer the benefits that were ex
pected by the public.
During the time Governor Stanford and his associates continued in con
trol of the Southern Pacific System they never wavered in their adherence
to this policy Neither did the press nor the public, until very recently,
abandon their opposition to that policy. The Santa Pc came into the state as
a competing road for business, but not with respect to rates foi fi eight and
fares, which now became matters for the Interstate Commerce Commission
and the State Railroad Commission.
This question of railroad competition now comes up 111 a legal aspect.
The Federal Government had submitted to the courts the question whether
the merging of the Central Pacific and its terminals, into the Southern Pa
cific System, is a monopoly in restraint of trade and commerce in violation
of the Sherman Anti-trust Law. This action 011 the part of the government
is now being vigorously resisted by substantially the entiic business inteiesls
of the state, upon the ground that the merging of these connecting lines and
terminal facilities twenty-nine years ago was for the best interests of the
people of this state, and is so now. The farseeing policy that constructed
this system is now approved by the public, and the policy ot Goveinoi Stan
ford and his associates in extending and developing the Southern Pacific
System from ISGS to 18S5 is now the declared policy of the people of the state
of California in dealing with this transcontinental transportation question.
Upon the legal question I express no opinion, but upon the question of policy
I have the opinion of a citizen that the present situation should not be
disturbed.
All Advocnte of Educational Legislation.
I come now to a period of a very different character, when my relations
with Governor Stanford became official, personal and in some respects quite
intimate. In January, ISBS, Governor Stanford was elected by the legislature
of the state to the United States Senate for the term of six years commencing
on March 4, 18S5. I had been elected in November, 18S4, to the House of
Representatives from the San Francisco District, for the term of two years
commencing also 011 March 4, 1885. By reelection I served six years in the
House of Representatives, from 1885 to 1891.
During this time it was customary for Senator Stanford to have frequent
conferences at his house with the California members of the House of Repre
sentatives concerning California matters. These conferences were nearly
always interesting, and sometimes amusing,â€”interesting because they either
related to some matter of legislation before Congress, or something pending
before one or more of the departments in which important interests of the
state were concerned, â€”amusing because of the extraordinary demands made
upon the Senators and members of Congress by their constituents, â€”from
turnip seeds and popcorn to patents for nutmeg graters and flying machines.
We speak of public officials as public servants, but we never use that term
with so much accuracy and feeling as when we apply it to Senators or Repre
sentatives in Congress. They are public servants, practically as well as
theoretically, with only one substantial privilege at their service,â€”and that
is to make speeches in the Congressional Record and send them free through
the mail to their constituents. Senator Stanford never availed himself of
this privilege. He was an efficient, conscientious public servant, performing
all his duties faithfully and cheerfully. He never complained of the burden
of small and often trifling demands.
One of the first subjects of national importance to engage his attention
was that of education, in which he was deeply interested. A bill had been
introduced in Congress by Senator Blair of New Hampshire to aid in the
establishment and temporary support of the common schools. The bill pro
vided for the distribution of seventy-seven millions of dollars among the
several states and territories in proportion to the illiteracy in each state or
territory. The distribution was to be in installments covering a period of
eight years. The bill was fully discussed by the leading senators. In the
course of the debate, on February 25, 1890, Senator Stanford delivered a
speech in support of the bill in which he said some pertinent things about
education: â€”
"In my opinion." said he, "our government can have no higher object
than to secure to the people a high degree of intelligence, thereby assisting
them to the attainment of the possibilities of humanity. Those possibilities
and the beneficence of the Creator to man on earth are one and the same,
for it is obvious that there could be no beneficence in the unattainable. Had
we been given reasonable wants without the means of gratifying them, the
Creator's beneficence would be a failure.
"But when we look around at the sources of supply for our wants,
whether physical or intellectual, we find them inexhaustibly supplied in the
soil, waters, forests, mines and quarries. The raw material is everywhere
within our reach, requiring only the intelligent application of labor and the
control of the forces of nature. How this labor is to be supplied, and this
control obtained, is what education will teach."
He believed in education of the masses, and he particularly favored the

bill then under consideration because it provided for the education of both
sexes alike for their respective callings. He believed in the early education
of the child for the moral influence it would have in forming his character
and in laying the foundation for his future efficiency. He believed in educat
ing all classes for the active duties of life, and for the deeper insight it gave
into nature, and the greater knowledge of her wonderful forces, which, being
understood, developed and brought under control, would enable humanity to
realize the glorious destiny marked out for it by the Creator.
The bill which he was then supporting was defeated, mainly, as I recall,
on constitutional grounds. But he supported other educational bills which
became laws, notably bills in aid of state agricultural colleges, providing for
experimental stations, and a more thorough training in agricultural pursuits.
He was himself an agriculturalist on a large scale, and with his extensive
land holdings he naturally took a practical interest in the industry. But his
interest was much more than personal. He viewed the production of the soil
from the standpoint of the nation's welfare, and believed that the nation might
increase its wealth enormously by the introduction of intelligent, economical
methods.
A Pioneer Advocate of Land Loan Laws.
He accordingly proposed a scheme for government loans on real estate,
which should have the double purpose of furnishing the country with an
elastic currency of sufficient volume to meet its requirements, and at the
same time supply the farmer with money at a low rate of interest to meet
the necessities of his calling, and make agriculture profitable and attractive.
The scheme was a bold one, but it was one in which Senator Stanford had the
utmost confidence, and he was astonished that it did not receive general ap
proval. I think the greatest disappointment he suffered during his senatorial
career was his failure to secure any general support for this bill.
In view of recent legislation, it would seem that his failure was due
mainly to the fact that he was at least twenty years in advance of the times.
Senator Stanford was essentially a progressive, and he was generally a
pioneer in whatever he undertook, whether it was the formation of a political
party, building a railroad, developing some new industry, or founding a Uni
versity. He could see well into the future, and he usually saw his efforts
successful; but in this instance lie did not see his scheme adopted. Now,
I am not going to discuss this financial question in any great detail. Mr.
Gladstone is reported to have said in a debate in the British House of Com
mons concerning some financial measure before it, that there were two roads
rÂ»ilroad timetable, and the other was the study of the principles of banking
and currency. For your sakes as well as for my own, I shall touch but lightly
upon this financial question.
But a few words of explanation are necessary to understand the full
scope and purposes of Senator Stanford's scheme: â€”
The speaker now explained the scope and purpose of Senator Stanford's
scheme, and the financial situation preceding the panic of 1893.
While this financial storm was brewing, Senator Stanford brought for
ward his land loan scheme. He first introduced a resolution in the Senate,
on March 10th, 1890, instructing the finance committee of that body to report
what relief might be provided by the United States government for the strin
gency in the money market, and particularly whether loans might be made
by the government upon mortgages. This resolution failed to receive any
consideration. On May 20th, IS9O, he introduced a bill entitled, "A bill to
provide the government with means sufficient to supply the national govern
ment with a sound circulating medium." This bill provided that the treasurer
of the United States should cause to be printed notes of the United States
to the amount of one hundred millions of dollars, and such additional amounts
from time to time as should be necessary to meet the requirements of the
act. These notes were to be a legal tender for all private and certain public
debts, and were to be loaned on unincumbered agricultural land upon interest
at the rate of two per cent per annum. A loan was not to exceed one half
of the assessed value of the land and for a term of not to exceed twenty
years. No loan was to be for a sum less than $250. The bill provided for a
bureau in the treasury department to administer the provisions of the act.
A few days after the introduction of this bill Senator Stanford made a
speech in its support in which he explained its provisions, and contended
that the plan of loaning money upon land at two per cent, with the privilege
to the borrower of returning it when he had no use for it, would create a
money system that would meet financial expansions and contractions as they
might occur. He did not claim, however, that his bill had been perfected in
detail. What he did claim was that the principle of loaning the credit of
the nation upon sufficient security, to those who needed it, should be ex
tended to the farmers on the security of real estate as had already been done
to the national banks on the security of United States bonds, and that the
financial condition of the country urgently required legislation to that end.
The bill was referred to the Senate Committee on Finance. That committee,
composed it must be said, of able and experienced statesmen, reported on
tfc bill adversely, classifying the proposed scheme with a number of others in
this country and elsewhere that had operated disastrously. The committee
held the bill to be bad in substance, and unconstitutional. Upon this report
the bill was indefinitely postponed.
In January, 1891, Senator Stanford was re-elected to the Senate for a
second term of six years, and be again introduced his land loan bill with
another bill placing the scheme squarely upon a gold basis. In January, 1892,
he made another and more elaborate speech in its support, at the same time
replying to the adverse report of the Finance Committee made in the previous
Congress. He was now thoroughly aroused and defended bis scheme with
great force. A Kansas Senator came to his support, and it looked as though
the bill was about to be considered on its merits, and amended so as to pro
vide against the possibility of an inflated currency. The bill was pending
in the Senate at the time of Senator Stanford's death on June 21st, 1593.
Senator Stanford Eulogized.
At the memorial exercises in the United States Senate on September 16,
1593, and in the House of Representatives on February 12, 1894, the members
of both houses paid feeling tributes to the life and character of Senator Stan
ford. The address of Senator Daniel of Virginia, in particular, was very im
pressive by reason of the eloquent and feeling personality of his remarks.
He referred to the land loan bill in terms that corresponded so nearly with
my own experience that I venture to repeat them here:â€”
"He (Senator Stanford) had some ideas which he was never able to im
press upon his associates as being practicable, among them liis idea of lend
ing vast amounts of money upon land. I have talked with him for hours and
hours upon repeated occasions on that theme, and he often urged me to adopt
his views and advocate them. I could neever see that they were practicable,
and with all my respect for him and desire to meet his wishes T could not,
of course, comply with his request. Yet let me say that beneath the difficul
ties which present themselves to such an idea as he had formed, there are
in it germs of truth and wisdom such as are found in the first evolutions of
invention, which, in a later and riper day of the world's history, may be de
veloped into much that is attainable and good. ... As the world's pop
ulation shall increase, and as financial refinements and facilities shall be
developed, there will be found in this idea much to build upon, and in the
end probably some ripe consummation."
How gracious and candid this was: This was twenty years ago. We have
experienced some squally financial times since then. The period commenced
with the panic of 1893 and included the panic of 1907: but the country has
made substantial progress in its financial system during this time, and in
the direction of Senator Stanford's scheme. This progress will be found in
the recent act of December 23, 1913, providing for reserve banks and an
elastic currency, with gold as the standard of values. Mr. Horace White,
the well known editor and financial expert, writing of this act in the North
American Review, says: â€”
"Twenty years was required to prepare public opinion, including that of
bankers and congressmen, for the adoption of asset currency in the place of
bond currency."
Judge Morrow proceeded to show that present financial legislation rests
upon the basic principle of Senator Stanford's land loan bill.
The Founding of Stanford University.
We come now to the last and most impressive and important act of Sen
ator Stanford's remarkable career, â€”the founding of this great university,
when he said, "The children of California shall be my children." In this act
we associate the name of that true and faithful companion and devoted wife,
Jane Lathrop Stanford. The founding of this university was the blending of
the pride and glory of both of their lives, in a vision of higher needs and
deeper realities. For thirty-five years they had been co-workers in all of
the affairs of life, reaching out to noble works and generous deeds. But now,
in memory of their idolized son, they lovingly united in founding this institu
tion as a perpetual memorial to his youthful ambition to better the world by
education.
In January, 1885, Senator Stanford submitted to the legislature of this
state an act to advance learning, and the arts and sciences, by providing for
the foundation and endowment within the state of universities and other
institutions of learning. This act passed both houses of the legislature and
was approved by the Governor on March 9th, 1885, â€”twenty-nine years ago
to-day. This act was general in its terms in accordance with the constitu
tional requirement, but was intended to be and was in fact the foundation
of this university. It is a happy coincidence that we commemorate the birth
of the founder, Leland Stanford, and the foundation act, on the same day.
Selection of the First President.
The seection of the first president for this university was a matter of
very serious concern with Senator and Mrs. Stanford. Their ideal of a presi
dent was as exceptional and as exalted as their ideal of the institution they
were founding; and accordingly the whole field of eligible persons was thor
oughly canvassed, and the qualifications of each carefully weighed with re
spect to the immediate work of organization, as well as ability to project the
lines of future development. It was from such a process of weighing and
sifting that the selection fell upon that distinguished scientist and able
executive, David Starr Jordan.
Senator and Mrs. Stanford were very earnest and very laborious in the
effort to frame the outline of an institution whose teachings would be of the
highest character. They believed in the value of present knowledge, but they
also believed in the value of work expended in the discovery of new truths.
They believed in teaching the student how to thread his way through the
known regions of knowledge, but they also believed in extending the boun
daries of knowledge into the unexplored; that humanity might know and
possess its inheritance. An institution to correspond to such a plan must
necessarily be a growth, the result of the slow process of evolution.
"Every true man," says Emerson, "is a cause, a country and an age;
requires infinite spaces and numbers and time fully to accomplish his design."
We look upon this university in that light, and behold it in the process
of development reflecting the spirit and purpose of its founders. We see
now the university taking its place as a force in the march of progress, ad
vancing the standards of skill and efficiency, and equipping explorers for new
fields of knowledge in the search for truth. We see it working out its des
tiny in promoting "the public welfare by exercising an influence in behalf
of humanity and civilization, teaching the blessings of liberty regulated by
law, inculcating love and reverence for the great principles of government
as derived from the inalienable rights of man to life, liberty and the pursuit
of. happiness."
We assemble here to-day to recall these works, revive the prophetic
vision of the founders; and pay our tribute of respect to the genius of the
builders who, building as they knew, built for all time.
The Founders' Day address deliv
ered this morning by Judge William
W. Morrow conies from an especially
authentic source, and constitutes the
j most elaborate memorial to Senator
Stanford yet attempted. For this
reason a desire has been expressed
that it be preserved in permanent
| form, and it is accordingly printed
almost in full.
The invitation I had the pleasure
|of receiving from the Faculty Com
: inittee to deliver the Founders' Day
address on this occasion came with
the suggestion that I should speak
from my personal knowledge of the

life and public services of Senator
Leland Stanford. The suggestion
was most acceptable, since it required
nothing more serious or exacting than
the recalling of events in the general
order of a narrative. This effort has
had a personal interest, and has
brought to my mind many interesting
associations connected with the pub
lic affairs of this state and nation, in
which Senator Stanford was a promi
nent figure, and which 1 think illus
trate in a marked degree his original
ity, courage and strength of char
acter.
My acquaintance with Leland Stan
ford covered a period of more than
thirty years, and during part of that
time my relations with him were of
such a nature that phases of his char
acter were brought under my obser
vation that made me know him as a
most unique, independent and com
manding personality.


Judge William \\. Morrow
He was born at Watervliet, New York, on March 9th, 1824 â€”ninety years
ago to-day. Watervliet is about eight miles above Albany, on the Hudson
River. Ilis father was of English stock, with Irish blood in his veins. This
was a combination from which we might expect an individual possessed of
vigorous Qualities of mind and body, coupled with courage and sound judg
ment, and balanced with a strain of quaint, happy humor. These qualities
do in fact appear to have been inherited in full vigor by the sou. The father
was a farmer, and for a time at least a railroad contractor. These parental
occupations must have given the son an early practical view of the affairs
of life and a habit of constant sell' reliance that would be likely to grow into
marked independence of judgment and will.
We start then with heredity, environment and an early experience favora
ble to the future efficiency and independence of the son, who had, moreover,
the advantage of a good, practical education. He studied law and was ad
mitted to the bar in IS4B. In that year lie yielded to the spirit of the day
and moved west to Port Washington, Wisconsin, where he practiced law. He
visited his New York home in 1850 and was there married to Miss .lane La
throp, and returned with his wife to Port Washington. In 1552 a fire de
stroyed his law library and household effects. This misfortune caused him
to consider the advantage of going still further west, and as a result he came
to California. He left his wife with her father in Albany, New York, and
reached California in July, 1552. He visited his brothers who were engaged
in a general merchandise business in Sacramento, and soon after he entered
into the same business for himself at Cold Springs, in Eldorado County. In
1853 he opened a store at Michigan Bluffs, in Placer County,a very prosperous
mining section, and lie also engaged in mining and was highly successlul.
In 1855 he purchased the business of his brothers in Sacramento and the
same year returned cast and brought Mrs. Stanford to California and estab
lished his home at Sacramento.
An Original Republican.
He was an original Republican, and with a few others organized the
Republican Party in Sacramento in 1556. All Republicans were progressives
in those days, and correspondingly fearless. Senator Cole, in his memoirs,
speaking of the Republican Party in Sacramento at that time, says: "The
party at its inception was extremely limited in numbers"; that beside him
self there were "Leland Stanford, C. P. Huntington, Mark Hopkins, Edwin B.
and Charles Crocker, and that besides these there were not for some time as
many as could be counted on one's fingers." But this small party does not
appear to have been ignored by others in the community because of its lack
of numbers. Its members were denounced as agitators, disturbers of the
peace and traitors to the country. Violence against them was resorted to
occasionally, and efforts of intimidation often. Senator Colo gives the copy
of a public notice, printed in large type and posted about the City of Sacra
mento on May 13th, 1856. It was headed, "To Arms," and called upon "all
good citizens to attend a public meeting" at a place named "to devise means
to protect the public welfare by appointing a committee to hang all the leaders
and as many of the attaches of said traitors as may be deemed necessary
to restore the public quiet and put a stop to such treasonable practices."
This notice was understood to be directed against Mr. Stanford and his asso
ciates. It was probably nothing more than a species of intimidation; but
whatever its object it could not have been highly pleasant reading for those
to whom it referred. The historian fails to give us any further information
concerning the meeting. Nobody appears to have been hung; but we are leit
to infer that this little band of agitators followed Franklin's wise advice
given to the signers of the Declaration of Indpendence. They hung together
and thus escaped being hanged separately.
I do not mention these matters to recall ancient animosities, long since
forgiven and forgotten. Mr. Stanford was himself among the first to forgive
and forget, save the humor of some of the situations, to which he sometimes
referred; but T mention these incidents to show you the man in action under
circumstances and conditions calculated to test the strength of his physical
and moral fiber, and his ability to meet the passions and turbulence of a new
community fearlessly and with perfect equanimity.
In 1857 Mr. Stanford was the Republican candidate for state treasurer;
but the party was of such recent origin that its nominations were merely
matters of form to maintain the party organization. In 1859 he was the
nominee of his party for Governor. The Democratic Party was divided. One
wing, being known as the Lecompton Party, nominated a ticket with Mr.
Latham as candidate for Governor, and the other wing, or Anti-Lecompton
Party, nominated a ticket with Judge John Curry for that office. There was
a natural tendency for the latter party to unite with the Republican Party,
as it subsequently did; but at this time there were influences at work in
favor of the Republican Party withdrawing from the field. Horace Greeley,
the editor of the New York Tribune, a man of distinction, and the foremost
Republican in the United States, arrived in California in the summer of 1559.
lie was everywhere received with the greatest enthusiasm and accorded every
consideration. Tie made a number of speeches in the state, and, regarding
himself as entitled by his position to advise Republicans as to their duty, he
proposed that they should withdraw their ticket and support the Anti-Le
compton Party.
The proposition was submitted to Mr. Stanford. His reply was charac
teristic of the man. He declined to withdraw, maintaining with firmness that
it was the duty of the Republican Party to stand by its principles whatever
the result. He preferred to go down to defeat rather than to surrender to
an opposing party the standard placed in his hands by his political friends
and supporters. He was not a mere office seeker. He was charged with the
duty of preserving the integrity of a party organization, and he would per
form that duty. Like Mr. Lincoln he would not be the last to desert. He
would not desert at all. He was defeated at the polls, but be demonstrated
to the people of the state that he was not a weak or an uncertain leader.
He was again nominated for Governor in 1861, and it was in this cam
paign that 1 first became acquainted with him. T was then located at Santa
Rosa. I was anxious to hear him, although I was not then a voter. I had
come to California two years before from the state of Illinois, where political
questions occupied the public mind to the exclusion of almost every other
subject. I had heard such public speakers as Lincoln, Douglass, Trumbull,
Browning and many others of their type. These were all rugged men of dis
tinguished ability, combined with great force of character. Coming here
from such a field of political discussion, my first impression of California
speakers was a disappointment. They seemed to me to be lacking in force
and in an understanding of national questions. I inquired for the joint de

bates between candidates, with which I had been familiar, and the keen dis
cussion of such national questions as the Missouri Compromise, the Dred
Scott decision, and the Leconipton Constitution. In Illinois the discussion
of political questions was about the only diversion the people had, and they
were accustomed to hear public speakers gifted with the force of persuasive
eloquence. It seemed to me that the California speakers did not measure up
to the standard we had in Illinois; but I was told to be patient until I heard
such speakers as Colonel E. D. Baker, Frederick P. Tracy, Thomas Starr
King, Thomas Fitch, Henry Edgerton, and other orators of repute. I soon
heard these speakers, and while they had culture of a high order, they lacked
the plain homely frontier character of the middle west. But I soon became
convinced that there were political orators in California as well as in Illinois.
Incidentally it may be said that Colonel Baker, the greatest orator of modern
times, was from Illinois and had been an associate of Mr. Lincoln. He had
been trained in the Illinois school of political discussion, and was a master
of the art. He was a soldier, orator and statesman.
While I was in this state of curiosity about the public speakers of the
state, Mr. Stanford was advertised to speak in Santa Rosa on the issues of
the day. lie was a leader of the new party, based upon a new and an untried
platform of principles. The political sentiment of that place at that time
was decidedly unfriendly to the new party and its candidates. Mr. Stanford
was received respectfully, but not enthusiastically. His personal appearance
was impressive. He was then thirty-seven years of age, large of frame, with
a swarthy complexion and something of the plain rugged features of the
frontiersman. He was dignified in manner, with a peculiarly attractive com
posure. His voice was melodious and pleasant; his language clear and ex
pressive. He was listened to by a large audience with respectful interest.
He wasted no time on immaterial questions but went directly into the issues
of the campaign. The platform of the party had declared in favor of the com
mon school system, and insisted that it should be sustained in all of its es
sential features, and its benefits and efficiency extended. The platform also
declared in favor of distributing the public lands of the United States to
homestead settlers, and pledged the party to aid the immediate construction
of a transcontinental railroad. The platform declared further that the Re
publicans of California pledged themselves, and all they had, to sustain the
national administration at Washington. Mr. Lincoln had been elected in the
previous November, and on the fourth of March had been inaugurated Presi
dent. Mr. Stanford had been a delegate from California to the National Re
publican Convention that had placed Mr. Lincoln in nomination, and had ad
vocated his election. He was the President's friend and adviser, and the two
men had much that was in common.
In Mr. Stanford's speech on the occasion to which I refer, he discussed
the platform of the party and declared his adherence to its principles. He
spoke with the eloquence of an honest conviction. He believed that the public
school system was at the very foundation of our form of government; that
the public domain should be given freely to actual settlers for the building
of homes; that the Pacific Railroad should be built at the earliest possible
moment that the people of the Pacific Coast might have quick and ample com
munication with the east. He declared that he was doing and would continue
to do what he could to further the project; and in concluding he paid a
splendid and feeling tribute to the high character and patriotism of Mr. Lin
coln, and his administration, and its purpose to maintain the perpetuity of
the Union.
Elected Governor of California.
It is difficult now to understand how any of these questions could have
ever been a subject of serious discussion; but they were, and the discussions
were vigorous, sometimes violent. Mr. Stanford presented them in an able
and fearless manner in all of the principal localities of the state. He gained
the confidence of the people by his plain, straightforward speech and man
ner, and was elected by a large plurality. His term of office was for two
years. Having become president of the Central Pacific Railroad, then in
course of construction, he declined a renomination. During his term of
office as governor he gave the state a wise and an efficient administration
and was counted one of the "War Governors" of the nation, taking a place in
support of the national cause along side of such governors as Andrews of
Massachusetts, Washburn of Maine, Morgan of New York, Curtin of Penn
sylvania, Morton of Indiana, Yates of Illinois and Kirkwood of lowa.
In June, 1861, and ten days after Mr. Stanford had been nominated for
Governor, he and a few other citizens of Sacramento organized and incor
porated the Central Pacific Railroad Company, under the laws of the State
of California, with Mr. Stanford as the president of the corporation. Con
gress had not then passed the act to aid in the construction of the railroad
and telegraph line from the Missouri River to the Pacific Ocean. That act
was not passed until July Ist, 1562. It organized the Union Pacific Railroad
Company with an imposing array of stockholders, to build a railroad west
from the Missouri River to a connection with the Central Pacific Railroad of
California. Mr. Stanford's associates were not so conspicuous, but they were
men of ability and character. Among them were Theodore D. .ludah, a dis
tinguished engineer, C. P. Huntington, Mark Hopkins and Charles Crocker,
merchants of Sacramento. There were a few others, but these were the men
who afterwards became known in the construction of the road, and in the
affairs of the state and nation in connection with this enterprise.
The object of the corporation which these men formed was to construct
a railroad from Sacramento eastward on the line of the proposed transcon
tinental railroad, and on January Bth, 1563, Governor Stanford turned the
first spadeful of earth in Sacramento for its construction. At that time the
only railroads in the state were a short line from Sacramento to Polsom, a
distance of about twenty miles, and a partly constructed railroad from San
Francisco to San Jose. The construction of these two short lines had been
very-expensive, and were in fact a warning against the prosecution of an
other such enterprise at that time. Railroad iron, locomotives and other
rolling stock had to be brought from the east around the Horn in sailing
vessels; and the cost of all kinds of material was very high, and labor dear
and scarce.
Judge Morrow at this point eloquently told the graphic narrative of the
building of the Central Pacific railroad, showing the indomitable will with
which its construction was pushed forward. He discussed the incorporation
of the Southern Pacific and threatened competition from the Atlantic and
Pacific and Texas and Pacific roads, and continued:
In this way Governor Stanford and his associates met and blocked these
two roads coming from the east at the boundary line of the state, one tempo
rarily and the other permanently. The Atlantic and Pacific subsequently
purchased the Southern Pacific line from Mohave to the Needles, and the
Santa Fe, its successor, finally reached the Bay of San Francisco by an inde
pendent terminal at Point Richmond. The Texas Pacific railroad never
reached the Colorado River, but the Southern Pacific, building eastward from
Yuma, pushed on across Arizona and New Mexico, and met the Texas Pacific
at the Rio Grande, near El Paso, in the State of Texas.
Under another act of Congress passed in 1566, the Central Pacific rail
road, under the name of the California and Oregon railroad, was authorized
to build northward toward the Oregon lino to connect with another railroad
coming south from Portland, Oregon. This line was built and a road opened
to Portland.
Governor Stanford and his associates also acquired control of short lines
by which they reached the Bay of San Francisco from the Sacramento and
San Joaquin Valleys. They also built a line down the coast; and with all
these lines, connections and terminals they secured substantial control of
the transportation facilities of the state, and in 1885 they merged all of these
railroads under the control of the Southern Pacific Company.
I mention these matters to show with what determination, force and
ability these men pushed forward against formidable opposition, and in the
fact of difficulties obtained the substantial control of the transportation facili
ties of the state. It has been said that others could have done the same thing
with the same assistance in national bonds, land grants and other contribu
tions. The fact remains that others, with like opportunities, did not make
the effort, and that others failed, with the same opportunities, to carry to
successful completion, corresponding enterprises. Every transcontinental
railroad coming westward toward the coast, and with which the Central Pa
cific railroad or the Southern Pacific railroad was authorized to connect,
failed at one time or another to meet their financial obligations, and were
placed by the courts in the hands of receivers. Comparisons are odious, and
however tempting this one may be, it will not be carried further.
But it is a fair question to ask: What have been the financial operations
of the corporations involved in the Southern Pacific System? Have any of
these failed to meet their obligations? Have any of them been in the hands
of receivers? AVe find 110 such records. They appear to have paid their debts
at maturity, including the bonded debt and interest due to the United States
by the Central Pacific. Perhaps some credit may be due to Governor Stan
ford and his associates for so having managed these properties that all the
corporations under their control have maintained their financial integrity
from the first spadeful of earth turned 011 the Bth day of January, 1863, down
to the present time.
During all this time of construction, Governor Stanford continued at the
head of the corporations incorporated into this one controlling system. The
people and press of the state protested, and charged that a grasping monop
oly had been formed to appropriate the transportation facilities of the state.
It was insisted that competitive transcontinental lines should be admitted
into tlie state and competition in freight and passen&ei lates seemed.
Governor Stanford and his associates proceeded upon the theory that
whatever monopoly there was in the Southern Pacific system was for the
best interests of the state; that what the state needed was the development
of its extensive and valuable resources, and that to do this it was impera
tive that railroad transportation be extended to all points of the state where
business would justify it, either presently or prospectively; that one cor
poration or one system, witli its connecting lines and terminals, could do
this better and cheaper than several; that additional transcontinental lines
would not be competitive, and would not confer the benefits that were ex
pected by the public.
During the time Governor Stanford and his associates continued in con
trol of the Southern Pacific System they never wavered in their adherence
to this policy Neither did the press nor the public, until very recently,
abandon their opposition to that policy. The Santa Pc came into the state as
a competing road for business, but not with respect to rates foi fi eight and
fares, which now became matters for the Interstate Commerce Commission
and the State Railroad Commission.
This question of railroad competition now comes up 111 a legal aspect.
The Federal Government had submitted to the courts the question whether
the merging of the Central Pacific and its terminals, into the Southern Pa
cific System, is a monopoly in restraint of trade and commerce in violation
of the Sherman Anti-trust Law. This action 011 the part of the government
is now being vigorously resisted by substantially the entiic business inteiesls
of the state, upon the ground that the merging of these connecting lines and
terminal facilities twenty-nine years ago was for the best interests of the
people of this state, and is so now. The farseeing policy that constructed
this system is now approved by the public, and the policy ot Goveinoi Stan
ford and his associates in extending and developing the Southern Pacific
System from ISGS to 18S5 is now the declared policy of the people of the state
of California in dealing with this transcontinental transportation question.
Upon the legal question I express no opinion, but upon the question of policy
I have the opinion of a citizen that the present situation should not be
disturbed.
All Advocnte of Educational Legislation.
I come now to a period of a very different character, when my relations
with Governor Stanford became official, personal and in some respects quite
intimate. In January, ISBS, Governor Stanford was elected by the legislature
of the state to the United States Senate for the term of six years commencing
on March 4, 18S5. I had been elected in November, 18S4, to the House of
Representatives from the San Francisco District, for the term of two years
commencing also 011 March 4, 1885. By reelection I served six years in the
House of Representatives, from 1885 to 1891.
During this time it was customary for Senator Stanford to have frequent
conferences at his house with the California members of the House of Repre
sentatives concerning California matters. These conferences were nearly
always interesting, and sometimes amusing,â€”interesting because they either
related to some matter of legislation before Congress, or something pending
before one or more of the departments in which important interests of the
state were concerned, â€”amusing because of the extraordinary demands made
upon the Senators and members of Congress by their constituents, â€”from
turnip seeds and popcorn to patents for nutmeg graters and flying machines.
We speak of public officials as public servants, but we never use that term
with so much accuracy and feeling as when we apply it to Senators or Repre
sentatives in Congress. They are public servants, practically as well as
theoretically, with only one substantial privilege at their service,â€”and that
is to make speeches in the Congressional Record and send them free through
the mail to their constituents. Senator Stanford never availed himself of
this privilege. He was an efficient, conscientious public servant, performing
all his duties faithfully and cheerfully. He never complained of the burden
of small and often trifling demands.
One of the first subjects of national importance to engage his attention
was that of education, in which he was deeply interested. A bill had been
introduced in Congress by Senator Blair of New Hampshire to aid in the
establishment and temporary support of the common schools. The bill pro
vided for the distribution of seventy-seven millions of dollars among the
several states and territories in proportion to the illiteracy in each state or
territory. The distribution was to be in installments covering a period of
eight years. The bill was fully discussed by the leading senators. In the
course of the debate, on February 25, 1890, Senator Stanford delivered a
speech in support of the bill in which he said some pertinent things about
education: â€”
"In my opinion." said he, "our government can have no higher object
than to secure to the people a high degree of intelligence, thereby assisting
them to the attainment of the possibilities of humanity. Those possibilities
and the beneficence of the Creator to man on earth are one and the same,
for it is obvious that there could be no beneficence in the unattainable. Had
we been given reasonable wants without the means of gratifying them, the
Creator's beneficence would be a failure.
"But when we look around at the sources of supply for our wants,
whether physical or intellectual, we find them inexhaustibly supplied in the
soil, waters, forests, mines and quarries. The raw material is everywhere
within our reach, requiring only the intelligent application of labor and the
control of the forces of nature. How this labor is to be supplied, and this
control obtained, is what education will teach."
He believed in education of the masses, and he particularly favored the

bill then under consideration because it provided for the education of both
sexes alike for their respective callings. He believed in the early education
of the child for the moral influence it would have in forming his character
and in laying the foundation for his future efficiency. He believed in educat
ing all classes for the active duties of life, and for the deeper insight it gave
into nature, and the greater knowledge of her wonderful forces, which, being
understood, developed and brought under control, would enable humanity to
realize the glorious destiny marked out for it by the Creator.
The bill which he was then supporting was defeated, mainly, as I recall,
on constitutional grounds. But he supported other educational bills which
became laws, notably bills in aid of state agricultural colleges, providing for
experimental stations, and a more thorough training in agricultural pursuits.
He was himself an agriculturalist on a large scale, and with his extensive
land holdings he naturally took a practical interest in the industry. But his
interest was much more than personal. He viewed the production of the soil
from the standpoint of the nation's welfare, and believed that the nation might
increase its wealth enormously by the introduction of intelligent, economical
methods.
A Pioneer Advocate of Land Loan Laws.
He accordingly proposed a scheme for government loans on real estate,
which should have the double purpose of furnishing the country with an
elastic currency of sufficient volume to meet its requirements, and at the
same time supply the farmer with money at a low rate of interest to meet
the necessities of his calling, and make agriculture profitable and attractive.
The scheme was a bold one, but it was one in which Senator Stanford had the
utmost confidence, and he was astonished that it did not receive general ap
proval. I think the greatest disappointment he suffered during his senatorial
career was his failure to secure any general support for this bill.
In view of recent legislation, it would seem that his failure was due
mainly to the fact that he was at least twenty years in advance of the times.
Senator Stanford was essentially a progressive, and he was generally a
pioneer in whatever he undertook, whether it was the formation of a political
party, building a railroad, developing some new industry, or founding a Uni
versity. He could see well into the future, and he usually saw his efforts
successful; but in this instance lie did not see his scheme adopted. Now,
I am not going to discuss this financial question in any great detail. Mr.
Gladstone is reported to have said in a debate in the British House of Com
mons concerning some financial measure before it, that there were two roads
rÂ»ilroad timetable, and the other was the study of the principles of banking
and currency. For your sakes as well as for my own, I shall touch but lightly
upon this financial question.
But a few words of explanation are necessary to understand the full
scope and purposes of Senator Stanford's scheme: â€”
The speaker now explained the scope and purpose of Senator Stanford's
scheme, and the financial situation preceding the panic of 1893.
While this financial storm was brewing, Senator Stanford brought for
ward his land loan scheme. He first introduced a resolution in the Senate,
on March 10th, 1890, instructing the finance committee of that body to report
what relief might be provided by the United States government for the strin
gency in the money market, and particularly whether loans might be made
by the government upon mortgages. This resolution failed to receive any
consideration. On May 20th, IS9O, he introduced a bill entitled, "A bill to
provide the government with means sufficient to supply the national govern
ment with a sound circulating medium." This bill provided that the treasurer
of the United States should cause to be printed notes of the United States
to the amount of one hundred millions of dollars, and such additional amounts
from time to time as should be necessary to meet the requirements of the
act. These notes were to be a legal tender for all private and certain public
debts, and were to be loaned on unincumbered agricultural land upon interest
at the rate of two per cent per annum. A loan was not to exceed one half
of the assessed value of the land and for a term of not to exceed twenty
years. No loan was to be for a sum less than $250. The bill provided for a
bureau in the treasury department to administer the provisions of the act.
A few days after the introduction of this bill Senator Stanford made a
speech in its support in which he explained its provisions, and contended
that the plan of loaning money upon land at two per cent, with the privilege
to the borrower of returning it when he had no use for it, would create a
money system that would meet financial expansions and contractions as they
might occur. He did not claim, however, that his bill had been perfected in
detail. What he did claim was that the principle of loaning the credit of
the nation upon sufficient security, to those who needed it, should be ex
tended to the farmers on the security of real estate as had already been done
to the national banks on the security of United States bonds, and that the
financial condition of the country urgently required legislation to that end.
The bill was referred to the Senate Committee on Finance. That committee,
composed it must be said, of able and experienced statesmen, reported on
tfc bill adversely, classifying the proposed scheme with a number of others in
this country and elsewhere that had operated disastrously. The committee
held the bill to be bad in substance, and unconstitutional. Upon this report
the bill was indefinitely postponed.
In January, 1891, Senator Stanford was re-elected to the Senate for a
second term of six years, and be again introduced his land loan bill with
another bill placing the scheme squarely upon a gold basis. In January, 1892,
he made another and more elaborate speech in its support, at the same time
replying to the adverse report of the Finance Committee made in the previous
Congress. He was now thoroughly aroused and defended bis scheme with
great force. A Kansas Senator came to his support, and it looked as though
the bill was about to be considered on its merits, and amended so as to pro
vide against the possibility of an inflated currency. The bill was pending
in the Senate at the time of Senator Stanford's death on June 21st, 1593.
Senator Stanford Eulogized.
At the memorial exercises in the United States Senate on September 16,
1593, and in the House of Representatives on February 12, 1894, the members
of both houses paid feeling tributes to the life and character of Senator Stan
ford. The address of Senator Daniel of Virginia, in particular, was very im
pressive by reason of the eloquent and feeling personality of his remarks.
He referred to the land loan bill in terms that corresponded so nearly with
my own experience that I venture to repeat them here:â€”
"He (Senator Stanford) had some ideas which he was never able to im
press upon his associates as being practicable, among them liis idea of lend
ing vast amounts of money upon land. I have talked with him for hours and
hours upon repeated occasions on that theme, and he often urged me to adopt
his views and advocate them. I could neever see that they were practicable,
and with all my respect for him and desire to meet his wishes T could not,
of course, comply with his request. Yet let me say that beneath the difficul
ties which present themselves to such an idea as he had formed, there are
in it germs of truth and wisdom such as are found in the first evolutions of
invention, which, in a later and riper day of the world's history, may be de
veloped into much that is attainable and good. ... As the world's pop
ulation shall increase, and as financial refinements and facilities shall be
developed, there will be found in this idea much to build upon, and in the
end probably some ripe consummation."
How gracious and candid this was: This was twenty years ago. We have
experienced some squally financial times since then. The period commenced
with the panic of 1893 and included the panic of 1907: but the country has
made substantial progress in its financial system during this time, and in
the direction of Senator Stanford's scheme. This progress will be found in
the recent act of December 23, 1913, providing for reserve banks and an
elastic currency, with gold as the standard of values. Mr. Horace White,
the well known editor and financial expert, writing of this act in the North
American Review, says: â€”
"Twenty years was required to prepare public opinion, including that of
bankers and congressmen, for the adoption of asset currency in the place of
bond currency."
Judge Morrow proceeded to show that present financial legislation rests
upon the basic principle of Senator Stanford's land loan bill.
The Founding of Stanford University.
We come now to the last and most impressive and important act of Sen
ator Stanford's remarkable career, â€”the founding of this great university,
when he said, "The children of California shall be my children." In this act
we associate the name of that true and faithful companion and devoted wife,
Jane Lathrop Stanford. The founding of this university was the blending of
the pride and glory of both of their lives, in a vision of higher needs and
deeper realities. For thirty-five years they had been co-workers in all of
the affairs of life, reaching out to noble works and generous deeds. But now,
in memory of their idolized son, they lovingly united in founding this institu
tion as a perpetual memorial to his youthful ambition to better the world by
education.
In January, 1885, Senator Stanford submitted to the legislature of this
state an act to advance learning, and the arts and sciences, by providing for
the foundation and endowment within the state of universities and other
institutions of learning. This act passed both houses of the legislature and
was approved by the Governor on March 9th, 1885, â€”twenty-nine years ago
to-day. This act was general in its terms in accordance with the constitu
tional requirement, but was intended to be and was in fact the foundation
of this university. It is a happy coincidence that we commemorate the birth
of the founder, Leland Stanford, and the foundation act, on the same day.
Selection of the First President.
The seection of the first president for this university was a matter of
very serious concern with Senator and Mrs. Stanford. Their ideal of a presi
dent was as exceptional and as exalted as their ideal of the institution they
were founding; and accordingly the whole field of eligible persons was thor
oughly canvassed, and the qualifications of each carefully weighed with re
spect to the immediate work of organization, as well as ability to project the
lines of future development. It was from such a process of weighing and
sifting that the selection fell upon that distinguished scientist and able
executive, David Starr Jordan.
Senator and Mrs. Stanford were very earnest and very laborious in the
effort to frame the outline of an institution whose teachings would be of the
highest character. They believed in the value of present knowledge, but they
also believed in the value of work expended in the discovery of new truths.
They believed in teaching the student how to thread his way through the
known regions of knowledge, but they also believed in extending the boun
daries of knowledge into the unexplored; that humanity might know and
possess its inheritance. An institution to correspond to such a plan must
necessarily be a growth, the result of the slow process of evolution.
"Every true man," says Emerson, "is a cause, a country and an age;
requires infinite spaces and numbers and time fully to accomplish his design."
We look upon this university in that light, and behold it in the process
of development reflecting the spirit and purpose of its founders. We see
now the university taking its place as a force in the march of progress, ad
vancing the standards of skill and efficiency, and equipping explorers for new
fields of knowledge in the search for truth. We see it working out its des
tiny in promoting "the public welfare by exercising an influence in behalf
of humanity and civilization, teaching the blessings of liberty regulated by
law, inculcating love and reverence for the great principles of government
as derived from the inalienable rights of man to life, liberty and the pursuit
of. happiness."
We assemble here to-day to recall these works, revive the prophetic
vision of the founders; and pay our tribute of respect to the genius of the
builders who, building as they knew, built for all time.
The Founders' Day address deliv
ered this morning by Judge William
W. Morrow conies from an especially
authentic source, and constitutes the
j most elaborate memorial to Senator
Stanford yet attempted. For this
reason a desire has been expressed
that it be preserved in permanent
| form, and it is accordingly printed
almost in full.
The invitation I had the pleasure
|of receiving from the Faculty Com
: inittee to deliver the Founders' Day
address on this occasion came with
the suggestion that I should speak
from my personal knowledge of the

life and public services of Senator
Leland Stanford. The suggestion
was most acceptable, since it required
nothing more serious or exacting than
the recalling of events in the general
order of a narrative. This effort has
had a personal interest, and has
brought to my mind many interesting
associations connected with the pub
lic affairs of this state and nation, in
which Senator Stanford was a promi
nent figure, and which 1 think illus
trate in a marked degree his original
ity, courage and strength of char
acter.
My acquaintance with Leland Stan
ford covered a period of more than
thirty years, and during part of that
time my relations with him were of
such a nature that phases of his char
acter were brought under my obser
vation that made me know him as a
most unique, independent and com
manding personality.


Judge William \\. Morrow
He was born at Watervliet, New York, on March 9th, 1824 â€”ninety years
ago to-day. Watervliet is about eight miles above Albany, on the Hudson
River. Ilis father was of English stock, with Irish blood in his veins. This
was a combination from which we might expect an individual possessed of
vigorous Qualities of mind and body, coupled with courage and sound judg
ment, and balanced with a strain of quaint, happy humor. These qualities
do in fact appear to have been inherited in full vigor by the sou. The father
was a farmer, and for a time at least a railroad contractor. These parental
occupations must have given the son an early practical view of the affairs
of life and a habit of constant sell' reliance that would be likely to grow into
marked independence of judgment and will.
We start then with heredity, environment and an early experience favora
ble to the future efficiency and independence of the son, who had, moreover,
the advantage of a good, practical education. He studied law and was ad
mitted to the bar in IS4B. In that year lie yielded to the spirit of the day
and moved west to Port Washington, Wisconsin, where he practiced law. He
visited his New York home in 1850 and was there married to Miss .lane La
throp, and returned with his wife to Port Washington. In 1552 a fire de
stroyed his law library and household effects. This misfortune caused him
to consider the advantage of going still further west, and as a result he came
to California. He left his wife with her father in Albany, New York, and
reached California in July, 1552. He visited his brothers who were engaged
in a general merchandise business in Sacramento, and soon after he entered
into the same business for himself at Cold Springs, in Eldorado County. In
1853 he opened a store at Michigan Bluffs, in Placer County,a very prosperous
mining section, and lie also engaged in mining and was highly successlul.
In 1855 he purchased the business of his brothers in Sacramento and the
same year returned cast and brought Mrs. Stanford to California and estab
lished his home at Sacramento.
An Original Republican.
He was an original Republican, and with a few others organized the
Republican Party in Sacramento in 1556. All Republicans were progressives
in those days, and correspondingly fearless. Senator Cole, in his memoirs,
speaking of the Republican Party in Sacramento at that time, says: "The
party at its inception was extremely limited in numbers"; that beside him
self there were "Leland Stanford, C. P. Huntington, Mark Hopkins, Edwin B.
and Charles Crocker, and that besides these there were not for some time as
many as could be counted on one's fingers." But this small party does not
appear to have been ignored by others in the community because of its lack
of numbers. Its members were denounced as agitators, disturbers of the
peace and traitors to the country. Violence against them was resorted to
occasionally, and efforts of intimidation often. Senator Colo gives the copy
of a public notice, printed in large type and posted about the City of Sacra
mento on May 13th, 1856. It was headed, "To Arms," and called upon "all
good citizens to attend a public meeting" at a place named "to devise means
to protect the public welfare by appointing a committee to hang all the leaders
and as many of the attaches of said traitors as may be deemed necessary
to restore the public quiet and put a stop to such treasonable practices."
This notice was understood to be directed against Mr. Stanford and his asso
ciates. It was probably nothing more than a species of intimidation; but
whatever its object it could not have been highly pleasant reading for those
to whom it referred. The historian fails to give us any further information
concerning the meeting. Nobody appears to have been hung; but we are leit
to infer that this little band of agitators followed Franklin's wise advice
given to the signers of the Declaration of Indpendence. They hung together
and thus escaped being hanged separately.
I do not mention these matters to recall ancient animosities, long since
forgiven and forgotten. Mr. Stanford was himself among the first to forgive
and forget, save the humor of some of the situations, to which he sometimes
referred; but T mention these incidents to show you the man in action under
circumstances and conditions calculated to test the strength of his physical
and moral fiber, and his ability to meet the passions and turbulence of a new
community fearlessly and with perfect equanimity.
In 1857 Mr. Stanford was the Republican candidate for state treasurer;
but the party was of such recent origin that its nominations were merely
matters of form to maintain the party organization. In 1859 he was the
nominee of his party for Governor. The Democratic Party was divided. One
wing, being known as the Lecompton Party, nominated a ticket with Mr.
Latham as candidate for Governor, and the other wing, or Anti-Lecompton
Party, nominated a ticket with Judge John Curry for that office. There was
a natural tendency for the latter party to unite with the Republican Party,
as it subsequently did; but at this time there were influences at work in
favor of the Republican Party withdrawing from the field. Horace Greeley,
the editor of the New York Tribune, a man of distinction, and the foremost
Republican in the United States, arrived in California in the summer of 1559.
lie was everywhere received with the greatest enthusiasm and accorded every
consideration. Tie made a number of speeches in the state, and, regarding
himself as entitled by his position to advise Republicans as to their duty, he
proposed that they should withdraw their ticket and support the Anti-Le
compton Party.
The proposition was submitted to Mr. Stanford. His reply was charac
teristic of the man. He declined to withdraw, maintaining with firmness that
it was the duty of the Republican Party to stand by its principles whatever
the result. He preferred to go down to defeat rather than to surrender to
an opposing party the standard placed in his hands by his political friends
and supporters. He was not a mere office seeker. He was charged with the
duty of preserving the integrity of a party organization, and he would per
form that duty. Like Mr. Lincoln he would not be the last to desert. He
would not desert at all. He was defeated at the polls, but be demonstrated
to the people of the state that he was not a weak or an uncertain leader.
He was again nominated for Governor in 1861, and it was in this cam
paign that 1 first became acquainted with him. T was then located at Santa
Rosa. I was anxious to hear him, although I was not then a voter. I had
come to California two years before from the state of Illinois, where political
questions occupied the public mind to the exclusion of almost every other
subject. I had heard such public speakers as Lincoln, Douglass, Trumbull,
Browning and many others of their type. These were all rugged men of dis
tinguished ability, combined with great force of character. Coming here
from such a field of political discussion, my first impression of California
speakers was a disappointment. They seemed to me to be lacking in force
and in an understanding of national questions. I inquired for the joint de

bates between candidates, with which I had been familiar, and the keen dis
cussion of such national questions as the Missouri Compromise, the Dred
Scott decision, and the Leconipton Constitution. In Illinois the discussion
of political questions was about the only diversion the people had, and they
were accustomed to hear public speakers gifted with the force of persuasive
eloquence. It seemed to me that the California speakers did not measure up
to the standard we had in Illinois; but I was told to be patient until I heard
such speakers as Colonel E. D. Baker, Frederick P. Tracy, Thomas Starr
King, Thomas Fitch, Henry Edgerton, and other orators of repute. I soon
heard these speakers, and while they had culture of a high order, they lacked
the plain homely frontier character of the middle west. But I soon became
convinced that there were political orators in California as well as in Illinois.
Incidentally it may be said that Colonel Baker, the greatest orator of modern
times, was from Illinois and had been an associate of Mr. Lincoln. He had
been trained in the Illinois school of political discussion, and was a master
of the art. He was a soldier, orator and statesman.
While I was in this state of curiosity about the public speakers of the
state, Mr. Stanford was advertised to speak in Santa Rosa on the issues of
the day. lie was a leader of the new party, based upon a new and an untried
platform of principles. The political sentiment of that place at that time
was decidedly unfriendly to the new party and its candidates. Mr. Stanford
was received respectfully, but not enthusiastically. His personal appearance
was impressive. He was then thirty-seven years of age, large of frame, with
a swarthy complexion and something of the plain rugged features of the
frontiersman. He was dignified in manner, with a peculiarly attractive com
posure. His voice was melodious and pleasant; his language clear and ex
pressive. He was listened to by a large audience with respectful interest.
He wasted no time on immaterial questions but went directly into the issues
of the campaign. The platform of the party had declared in favor of the com
mon school system, and insisted that it should be sustained in all of its es
sential features, and its benefits and efficiency extended. The platform also
declared in favor of distributing the public lands of the United States to
homestead settlers, and pledged the party to aid the immediate construction
of a transcontinental railroad. The platform declared further that the Re
publicans of California pledged themselves, and all they had, to sustain the
national administration at Washington. Mr. Lincoln had been elected in the
previous November, and on the fourth of March had been inaugurated Presi
dent. Mr. Stanford had been a delegate from California to the National Re
publican Convention that had placed Mr. Lincoln in nomination, and had ad
vocated his election. He was the President's friend and adviser, and the two
men had much that was in common.
In Mr. Stanford's speech on the occasion to which I refer, he discussed
the platform of the party and declared his adherence to its principles. He
spoke with the eloquence of an honest conviction. He believed that the public
school system was at the very foundation of our form of government; that
the public domain should be given freely to actual settlers for the building
of homes; that the Pacific Railroad should be built at the earliest possible
moment that the people of the Pacific Coast might have quick and ample com
munication with the east. He declared that he was doing and would continue
to do what he could to further the project; and in concluding he paid a
splendid and feeling tribute to the high character and patriotism of Mr. Lin
coln, and his administration, and its purpose to maintain the perpetuity of
the Union.
Elected Governor of California.
It is difficult now to understand how any of these questions could have
ever been a subject of serious discussion; but they were, and the discussions
were vigorous, sometimes violent. Mr. Stanford presented them in an able
and fearless manner in all of the principal localities of the state. He gained
the confidence of the people by his plain, straightforward speech and man
ner, and was elected by a large plurality. His term of office was for two
years. Having become president of the Central Pacific Railroad, then in
course of construction, he declined a renomination. During his term of
office as governor he gave the state a wise and an efficient administration
and was counted one of the "War Governors" of the nation, taking a place in
support of the national cause along side of such governors as Andrews of
Massachusetts, Washburn of Maine, Morgan of New York, Curtin of Penn
sylvania, Morton of Indiana, Yates of Illinois and Kirkwood of lowa.
In June, 1861, and ten days after Mr. Stanford had been nominated for
Governor, he and a few other citizens of Sacramento organized and incor
porated the Central Pacific Railroad Company, under the laws of the State
of California, with Mr. Stanford as the president of the corporation. Con
gress had not then passed the act to aid in the construction of the railroad
and telegraph line from the Missouri River to the Pacific Ocean. That act
was not passed until July Ist, 1562. It organized the Union Pacific Railroad
Company with an imposing array of stockholders, to build a railroad west
from the Missouri River to a connection with the Central Pacific Railroad of
California. Mr. Stanford's associates were not so conspicuous, but they were
men of ability and character. Among them were Theodore D. .ludah, a dis
tinguished engineer, C. P. Huntington, Mark Hopkins and Charles Crocker,
merchants of Sacramento. There were a few others, but these were the men
who afterwards became known in the construction of the road, and in the
affairs of the state and nation in connection with this enterprise.
The object of the corporation which these men formed was to construct
a railroad from Sacramento eastward on the line of the proposed transcon
tinental railroad, and on January Bth, 1563, Governor Stanford turned the
first spadeful of earth in Sacramento for its construction. At that time the
only railroads in the state were a short line from Sacramento to Polsom, a
distance of about twenty miles, and a partly constructed railroad from San
Francisco to San Jose. The construction of these two short lines had been
very-expensive, and were in fact a warning against the prosecution of an
other such enterprise at that time. Railroad iron, locomotives and other
rolling stock had to be brought from the east around the Horn in sailing
vessels; and the cost of all kinds of material was very high, and labor dear
and scarce.
Judge Morrow at this point eloquently told the graphic narrative of the
building of the Central Pacific railroad, showing the indomitable will with
which its construction was pushed forward. He discussed the incorporation
of the Southern Pacific and threatened competition from the Atlantic and
Pacific and Texas and Pacific roads, and continued:
In this way Governor Stanford and his associates met and blocked these
two roads coming from the east at the boundary line of the state, one tempo
rarily and the other permanently. The Atlantic and Pacific subsequently
purchased the Southern Pacific line from Mohave to the Needles, and the
Santa Fe, its successor, finally reached the Bay of San Francisco by an inde
pendent terminal at Point Richmond. The Texas Pacific railroad never
reached the Colorado River, but the Southern Pacific, building eastward from
Yuma, pushed on across Arizona and New Mexico, and met the Texas Pacific
at the Rio Grande, near El Paso, in the State of Texas.
Under another act of Congress passed in 1566, the Central Pacific rail
road, under the name of the California and Oregon railroad, was authorized
to build northward toward the Oregon lino to connect with another railroad
coming south from Portland, Oregon. This line was built and a road opened
to Portland.
Governor Stanford and his associates also acquired control of short lines
by which they reached the Bay of San Francisco from the Sacramento and
San Joaquin Valleys. They also built a line down the coast; and with all
these lines, connections and terminals they secured substantial control of
the transportation facilities of the state, and in 1885 they merged all of these
railroads under the control of the Southern Pacific Company.
I mention these matters to show with what determination, force and
ability these men pushed forward against formidable opposition, and in the
fact of difficulties obtained the substantial control of the transportation facili
ties of the state. It has been said that others could have done the same thing
with the same assistance in national bonds, land grants and other contribu
tions. The fact remains that others, with like opportunities, did not make
the effort, and that others failed, with the same opportunities, to carry to
successful completion, corresponding enterprises. Every transcontinental
railroad coming westward toward the coast, and with which the Central Pa
cific railroad or the Southern Pacific railroad was authorized to connect,
failed at one time or another to meet their financial obligations, and were
placed by the courts in the hands of receivers. Comparisons are odious, and
however tempting this one may be, it will not be carried further.
But it is a fair question to ask: What have been the financial operations
of the corporations involved in the Southern Pacific System? Have any of
these failed to meet their obligations? Have any of them been in the hands
of receivers? AVe find 110 such records. They appear to have paid their debts
at maturity, including the bonded debt and interest due to the United States
by the Central Pacific. Perhaps some credit may be due to Governor Stan
ford and his associates for so having managed these properties that all the
corporations under their control have maintained their financial integrity
from the first spadeful of earth turned 011 the Bth day of January, 1863, down
to the present time.
During all this time of construction, Governor Stanford continued at the
head of the corporations incorporated into this one controlling system. The
people and press of the state protested, and charged that a grasping monop
oly had been formed to appropriate the transportation facilities of the state.
It was insisted that competitive transcontinental lines should be admitted
into tlie state and competition in freight and passen&ei lates seemed.
Governor Stanford and his associates proceeded upon the theory that
whatever monopoly there was in the Southern Pacific system was for the
best interests of the state; that what the state needed was the development
of its extensive and valuable resources, and that to do this it was impera
tive that railroad transportation be extended to all points of the state where
business would justify it, either presently or prospectively; that one cor
poration or one system, witli its connecting lines and terminals, could do
this better and cheaper than several; that additional transcontinental lines
would not be competitive, and would not confer the benefits that were ex
pected by the public.
During the time Governor Stanford and his associates continued in con
trol of the Southern Pacific System they never wavered in their adherence
to this policy Neither did the press nor the public, until very recently,
abandon their opposition to that policy. The Santa Pc came into the state as
a competing road for business, but not with respect to rates foi fi eight and
fares, which now became matters for the Interstate Commerce Commission
and the State Railroad Commission.
This question of railroad competition now comes up 111 a legal aspect.
The Federal Government had submitted to the courts the question whether
the merging of the Central Pacific and its terminals, into the Southern Pa
cific System, is a monopoly in restraint of trade and commerce in violation
of the Sherman Anti-trust Law. This action 011 the part of the government
is now being vigorously resisted by substantially the entiic business inteiesls
of the state, upon the ground that the merging of these connecting lines and
terminal facilities twenty-nine years ago was for the best interests of the
people of this state, and is so now. The farseeing policy that constructed
this system is now approved by the public, and the policy ot Goveinoi Stan
ford and his associates in extending and developing the Southern Pacific
System from ISGS to 18S5 is now the declared policy of the people of the state
of California in dealing with this transcontinental transportation question.
Upon the legal question I express no opinion, but upon the question of policy
I have the opinion of a citizen that the present situation should not be
disturbed.
All Advocnte of Educational Legislation.
I come now to a period of a very different character, when my relations
with Governor Stanford became official, personal and in some respects quite
intimate. In January, ISBS, Governor Stanford was elected by the legislature
of the state to the United States Senate for the term of six years commencing
on March 4, 18S5. I had been elected in November, 18S4, to the House of
Representatives from the San Francisco District, for the term of two years
commencing also 011 March 4, 1885. By reelection I served six years in the
House of Representatives, from 1885 to 1891.
During this time it was customary for Senator Stanford to have frequent
conferences at his house with the California members of the House of Repre
sentatives concerning California matters. These conferences were nearly
always interesting, and sometimes amusing,â€”interesting because they either
related to some matter of legislation before Congress, or something pending
before one or more of the departments in which important interests of the
state were concerned, â€”amusing because of the extraordinary demands made
upon the Senators and members of Congress by their constituents, â€”from
turnip seeds and popcorn to patents for nutmeg graters and flying machines.
We speak of public officials as public servants, but we never use that term
with so much accuracy and feeling as when we apply it to Senators or Repre
sentatives in Congress. They are public servants, practically as well as
theoretically, with only one substantial privilege at their service,â€”and that
is to make speeches in the Congressional Record and send them free through
the mail to their constituents. Senator Stanford never availed himself of
this privilege. He was an efficient, conscientious public servant, performing
all his duties faithfully and cheerfully. He never complained of the burden
of small and often trifling demands.
One of the first subjects of national importance to engage his attention
was that of education, in which he was deeply interested. A bill had been
introduced in Congress by Senator Blair of New Hampshire to aid in the
establishment and temporary support of the common schools. The bill pro
vided for the distribution of seventy-seven millions of dollars among the
several states and territories in proportion to the illiteracy in each state or
territory. The distribution was to be in installments covering a period of
eight years. The bill was fully discussed by the leading senators. In the
course of the debate, on February 25, 1890, Senator Stanford delivered a
speech in support of the bill in which he said some pertinent things about
education: â€”
"In my opinion." said he, "our government can have no higher object
than to secure to the people a high degree of intelligence, thereby assisting
them to the attainment of the possibilities of humanity. Those possibilities
and the beneficence of the Creator to man on earth are one and the same,
for it is obvious that there could be no beneficence in the unattainable. Had
we been given reasonable wants without the means of gratifying them, the
Creator's beneficence would be a failure.
"But when we look around at the sources of supply for our wants,
whether physical or intellectual, we find them inexhaustibly supplied in the
soil, waters, forests, mines and quarries. The raw material is everywhere
within our reach, requiring only the intelligent application of labor and the
control of the forces of nature. How this labor is to be supplied, and this
control obtained, is what education will teach."
He believed in education of the masses, and he particularly favored the

bill then under consideration because it provided for the education of both
sexes alike for their respective callings. He believed in the early education
of the child for the moral influence it would have in forming his character
and in laying the foundation for his future efficiency. He believed in educat
ing all classes for the active duties of life, and for the deeper insight it gave
into nature, and the greater knowledge of her wonderful forces, which, being
understood, developed and brought under control, would enable humanity to
realize the glorious destiny marked out for it by the Creator.
The bill which he was then supporting was defeated, mainly, as I recall,
on constitutional grounds. But he supported other educational bills which
became laws, notably bills in aid of state agricultural colleges, providing for
experimental stations, and a more thorough training in agricultural pursuits.
He was himself an agriculturalist on a large scale, and with his extensive
land holdings he naturally took a practical interest in the industry. But his
interest was much more than personal. He viewed the production of the soil
from the standpoint of the nation's welfare, and believed that the nation might
increase its wealth enormously by the introduction of intelligent, economical
methods.
A Pioneer Advocate of Land Loan Laws.
He accordingly proposed a scheme for government loans on real estate,
which should have the double purpose of furnishing the country with an
elastic currency of sufficient volume to meet its requirements, and at the
same time supply the farmer with money at a low rate of interest to meet
the necessities of his calling, and make agriculture profitable and attractive.
The scheme was a bold one, but it was one in which Senator Stanford had the
utmost confidence, and he was astonished that it did not receive general ap
proval. I think the greatest disappointment he suffered during his senatorial
career was his failure to secure any general support for this bill.
In view of recent legislation, it would seem that his failure was due
mainly to the fact that he was at least twenty years in advance of the times.
Senator Stanford was essentially a progressive, and he was generally a
pioneer in whatever he undertook, whether it was the formation of a political
party, building a railroad, developing some new industry, or founding a Uni
versity. He could see well into the future, and he usually saw his efforts
successful; but in this instance lie did not see his scheme adopted. Now,
I am not going to discuss this financial question in any great detail. Mr.
Gladstone is reported to have said in a debate in the British House of Com
mons concerning some financial measure before it, that there were two roads
rÂ»ilroad timetable, and the other was the study of the principles of banking
and currency. For your sakes as well as for my own, I shall touch but lightly
upon this financial question.
But a few words of explanation are necessary to understand the full
scope and purposes of Senator Stanford's scheme: â€”
The speaker now explained the scope and purpose of Senator Stanford's
scheme, and the financial situation preceding the panic of 1893.
While this financial storm was brewing, Senator Stanford brought for
ward his land loan scheme. He first introduced a resolution in the Senate,
on March 10th, 1890, instructing the finance committee of that body to report
what relief might be provided by the United States government for the strin
gency in the money market, and particularly whether loans might be made
by the government upon mortgages. This resolution failed to receive any
consideration. On May 20th, IS9O, he introduced a bill entitled, "A bill to
provide the government with means sufficient to supply the national govern
ment with a sound circulating medium." This bill provided that the treasurer
of the United States should cause to be printed notes of the United States
to the amount of one hundred millions of dollars, and such additional amounts
from time to time as should be necessary to meet the requirements of the
act. These notes were to be a legal tender for all private and certain public
debts, and were to be loaned on unincumbered agricultural land upon interest
at the rate of two per cent per annum. A loan was not to exceed one half
of the assessed value of the land and for a term of not to exceed twenty
years. No loan was to be for a sum less than $250. The bill provided for a
bureau in the treasury department to administer the provisions of the act.
A few days after the introduction of this bill Senator Stanford made a
speech in its support in which he explained its provisions, and contended
that the plan of loaning money upon land at two per cent, with the privilege
to the borrower of returning it when he had no use for it, would create a
money system that would meet financial expansions and contractions as they
might occur. He did not claim, however, that his bill had been perfected in
detail. What he did claim was that the principle of loaning the credit of
the nation upon sufficient security, to those who needed it, should be ex
tended to the farmers on the security of real estate as had already been done
to the national banks on the security of United States bonds, and that the
financial condition of the country urgently required legislation to that end.
The bill was referred to the Senate Committee on Finance. That committee,
composed it must be said, of able and experienced statesmen, reported on
tfc bill adversely, classifying the proposed scheme with a number of others in
this country and elsewhere that had operated disastrously. The committee
held the bill to be bad in substance, and unconstitutional. Upon this report
the bill was indefinitely postponed.
In January, 1891, Senator Stanford was re-elected to the Senate for a
second term of six years, and be again introduced his land loan bill with
another bill placing the scheme squarely upon a gold basis. In January, 1892,
he made another and more elaborate speech in its support, at the same time
replying to the adverse report of the Finance Committee made in the previous
Congress. He was now thoroughly aroused and defended bis scheme with
great force. A Kansas Senator came to his support, and it looked as though
the bill was about to be considered on its merits, and amended so as to pro
vide against the possibility of an inflated currency. The bill was pending
in the Senate at the time of Senator Stanford's death on June 21st, 1593.
Senator Stanford Eulogized.
At the memorial exercises in the United States Senate on September 16,
1593, and in the House of Representatives on February 12, 1894, the members
of both houses paid feeling tributes to the life and character of Senator Stan
ford. The address of Senator Daniel of Virginia, in particular, was very im
pressive by reason of the eloquent and feeling personality of his remarks.
He referred to the land loan bill in terms that corresponded so nearly with
my own experience that I venture to repeat them here:â€”
"He (Senator Stanford) had some ideas which he was never able to im
press upon his associates as being practicable, among them liis idea of lend
ing vast amounts of money upon land. I have talked with him for hours and
hours upon repeated occasions on that theme, and he often urged me to adopt
his views and advocate them. I could neever see that they were practicable,
and with all my respect for him and desire to meet his wishes T could not,
of course, comply with his request. Yet let me say that beneath the difficul
ties which present themselves to such an idea as he had formed, there are
in it germs of truth and wisdom such as are found in the first evolutions of
invention, which, in a later and riper day of the world's history, may be de
veloped into much that is attainable and good. ... As the world's pop
ulation shall increase, and as financial refinements and facilities shall be
developed, there will be found in this idea much to build upon, and in the
end probably some ripe consummation."
How gracious and candid this was: This was twenty years ago. We have
experienced some squally financial times since then. The period commenced
with the panic of 1893 and included the panic of 1907: but the country has
made substantial progress in its financial system during this time, and in
the direction of Senator Stanford's scheme. This progress will be found in
the recent act of December 23, 1913, providing for reserve banks and an
elastic currency, with gold as the standard of values. Mr. Horace White,
the well known editor and financial expert, writing of this act in the North
American Review, says: â€”
"Twenty years was required to prepare public opinion, including that of
bankers and congressmen, for the adoption of asset currency in the place of
bond currency."
Judge Morrow proceeded to show that present financial legislation rests
upon the basic principle of Senator Stanford's land loan bill.
The Founding of Stanford University.
We come now to the last and most impressive and important act of Sen
ator Stanford's remarkable career, â€”the founding of this great university,
when he said, "The children of California shall be my children." In this act
we associate the name of that true and faithful companion and devoted wife,
Jane Lathrop Stanford. The founding of this university was the blending of
the pride and glory of both of their lives, in a vision of higher needs and
deeper realities. For thirty-five years they had been co-workers in all of
the affairs of life, reaching out to noble works and generous deeds. But now,
in memory of their idolized son, they lovingly united in founding this institu
tion as a perpetual memorial to his youthful ambition to better the world by
education.
In January, 1885, Senator Stanford submitted to the legislature of this
state an act to advance learning, and the arts and sciences, by providing for
the foundation and endowment within the state of universities and other
institutions of learning. This act passed both houses of the legislature and
was approved by the Governor on March 9th, 1885, â€”twenty-nine years ago
to-day. This act was general in its terms in accordance with the constitu
tional requirement, but was intended to be and was in fact the foundation
of this university. It is a happy coincidence that we commemorate the birth
of the founder, Leland Stanford, and the foundation act, on the same day.
Selection of the First President.
The seection of the first president for this university was a matter of
very serious concern with Senator and Mrs. Stanford. Their ideal of a presi
dent was as exceptional and as exalted as their ideal of the institution they
were founding; and accordingly the whole field of eligible persons was thor
oughly canvassed, and the qualifications of each carefully weighed with re
spect to the immediate work of organization, as well as ability to project the
lines of future development. It was from such a process of weighing and
sifting that the selection fell upon that distinguished scientist and able
executive, David Starr Jordan.
Senator and Mrs. Stanford were very earnest and very laborious in the
effort to frame the outline of an institution whose teachings would be of the
highest character. They believed in the value of present knowledge, but they
also believed in the value of work expended in the discovery of new truths.
They believed in teaching the student how to thread his way through the
known regions of knowledge, but they also believed in extending the boun
daries of knowledge into the unexplored; that humanity might know and
possess its inheritance. An institution to correspond to such a plan must
necessarily be a growth, the result of the slow process of evolution.
"Every true man," says Emerson, "is a cause, a country and an age;
requires infinite spaces and numbers and time fully to accomplish his design."
We look upon this university in that light, and behold it in the process
of development reflecting the spirit and purpose of its founders. We see
now the university taking its place as a force in the march of progress, ad
vancing the standards of skill and efficiency, and equipping explorers for new
fields of knowledge in the search for truth. We see it working out its des
tiny in promoting "the public welfare by exercising an influence in behalf
of humanity and civilization, teaching the blessings of liberty regulated by
law, inculcating love and reverence for the great principles of government
as derived from the inalienable rights of man to life, liberty and the pursuit
of. happiness."
We assemble here to-day to recall these works, revive the prophetic
vision of the founders; and pay our tribute of respect to the genius of the
builders who, building as they knew, built for all time.
The Founders' Day address deliv
ered this morning by Judge William
W. Morrow conies from an especially
authentic source, and constitutes the
j most elaborate memorial to Senator
Stanford yet attempted. For this
reason a desire has been expressed
that it be preserved in permanent
| form, and it is accordingly printed
almost in full.
The invitation I had the pleasure
|of receiving from the Faculty Com
: inittee to deliver the Founders' Day
address on this occasion came with
the suggestion that I should speak
from my personal knowledge of the

life and public services of Senator
Leland Stanford. The suggestion
was most acceptable, since it required
nothing more serious or exacting than
the recalling of events in the general
order of a narrative. This effort has
had a personal interest, and has
brought to my mind many interesting
associations connected with the pub
lic affairs of this state and nation, in
which Senator Stanford was a promi
nent figure, and which 1 think illus
trate in a marked degree his original
ity, courage and strength of char
acter.
My acquaintance with Leland Stan
ford covered a period of more than
thirty years, and during part of that
time my relations with him were of
such a nature that phases of his char
acter were brought under my obser
vation that made me know him as a
most unique, independent and com
manding personality.


Judge William \\. Morrow
He was born at Watervliet, New York, on March 9th, 1824 â€”ninety years
ago to-day. Watervliet is about eight miles above Albany, on the Hudson
River. Ilis father was of English stock, with Irish blood in his veins. This
was a combination from which we might expect an individual possessed of
vigorous Qualities of mind and body, coupled with courage and sound judg
ment, and balanced with a strain of quaint, happy humor. These qualities
do in fact appear to have been inherited in full vigor by the sou. The father
was a farmer, and for a time at least a railroad contractor. These parental
occupations must have given the son an early practical view of the affairs
of life and a habit of constant sell' reliance that would be likely to grow into
marked independence of judgment and will.
We start then with heredity, environment and an early experience favora
ble to the future efficiency and independence of the son, who had, moreover,
the advantage of a good, practical education. He studied law and was ad
mitted to the bar in IS4B. In that year lie yielded to the spirit of the day
and moved west to Port Washington, Wisconsin, where he practiced law. He
visited his New York home in 1850 and was there married to Miss .lane La
throp, and returned with his wife to Port Washington. In 1552 a fire de
stroyed his law library and household effects. This misfortune caused him
to consider the advantage of going still further west, and as a result he came
to California. He left his wife with her father in Albany, New York, and
reached California in July, 1552. He visited his brothers who were engaged
in a general merchandise business in Sacramento, and soon after he entered
into the same business for himself at Cold Springs, in Eldorado County. In
1853 he opened a store at Michigan Bluffs, in Placer County,a very prosperous
mining section, and lie also engaged in mining and was highly successlul.
In 1855 he purchased the business of his brothers in Sacramento and the
same year returned cast and brought Mrs. Stanford to California and estab
lished his home at Sacramento.
An Original Republican.
He was an original Republican, and with a few others organized the
Republican Party in Sacramento in 1556. All Republicans were progressives
in those days, and correspondingly fearless. Senator Cole, in his memoirs,
speaking of the Republican Party in Sacramento at that time, says: "The
party at its inception was extremely limited in numbers"; that beside him
self there were "Leland Stanford, C. P. Huntington, Mark Hopkins, Edwin B.
and Charles Crocker, and that besides these there were not for some time as
many as could be counted on one's fingers." But this small party does not
appear to have been ignored by others in the community because of its lack
of numbers. Its members were denounced as agitators, disturbers of the
peace and traitors to the country. Violence against them was resorted to
occasionally, and efforts of intimidation often. Senator Colo gives the copy
of a public notice, printed in large type and posted about the City of Sacra
mento on May 13th, 1856. It was headed, "To Arms," and called upon "all
good citizens to attend a public meeting" at a place named "to devise means
to protect the public welfare by appointing a committee to hang all the leaders
and as many of the attaches of said traitors as may be deemed necessary
to restore the public quiet and put a stop to such treasonable practices."
This notice was understood to be directed against Mr. Stanford and his asso
ciates. It was probably nothing more than a species of intimidation; but
whatever its object it could not have been highly pleasant reading for those
to whom it referred. The historian fails to give us any further information
concerning the meeting. Nobody appears to have been hung; but we are leit
to infer that this little band of agitators followed Franklin's wise advice
given to the signers of the Declaration of Indpendence. They hung together
and thus escaped being hanged separately.
I do not mention these matters to recall ancient animosities, long since
forgiven and forgotten. Mr. Stanford was himself among the first to forgive
and forget, save the humor of some of the situations, to which he sometimes
referred; but T mention these incidents to show you the man in action under
circumstances and conditions calculated to test the strength of his physical
and moral fiber, and his ability to meet the passions and turbulence of a new
community fearlessly and with perfect equanimity.
In 1857 Mr. Stanford was the Republican candidate for state treasurer;
but the party was of such recent origin that its nominations were merely
matters of form to maintain the party organization. In 1859 he was the
nominee of his party for Governor. The Democratic Party was divided. One
wing, being known as the Lecompton Party, nominated a ticket with Mr.
Latham as candidate for Governor, and the other wing, or Anti-Lecompton
Party, nominated a ticket with Judge John Curry for that office. There was
a natural tendency for the latter party to unite with the Republican Party,
as it subsequently did; but at this time there were influences at work in
favor of the Republican Party withdrawing from the field. Horace Greeley,
the editor of the New York Tribune, a man of distinction, and the foremost
Republican in the United States, arrived in California in the summer of 1559.
lie was everywhere received with the greatest enthusiasm and accorded every
consideration. Tie made a number of speeches in the state, and, regarding
himself as entitled by his position to advise Republicans as to their duty, he
proposed that they should withdraw their ticket and support the Anti-Le
compton Party.
The proposition was submitted to Mr. Stanford. His reply was charac
teristic of the man. He declined to withdraw, maintaining with firmness that
it was the duty of the Republican Party to stand by its principles whatever
the result. He preferred to go down to defeat rather than to surrender to
an opposing party the standard placed in his hands by his political friends
and supporters. He was not a mere office seeker. He was charged with the
duty of preserving the integrity of a party organization, and he would per
form that duty. Like Mr. Lincoln he would not be the last to desert. He
would not desert at all. He was defeated at the polls, but be demonstrated
to the people of the state that he was not a weak or an uncertain leader.
He was again nominated for Governor in 1861, and it was in this cam
paign that 1 first became acquainted with him. T was then located at Santa
Rosa. I was anxious to hear him, although I was not then a voter. I had
come to California two years before from the state of Illinois, where political
questions occupied the public mind to the exclusion of almost every other
subject. I had heard such public speakers as Lincoln, Douglass, Trumbull,
Browning and many others of their type. These were all rugged men of dis
tinguished ability, combined with great force of character. Coming here
from such a field of political discussion, my first impression of California
speakers was a disappointment. They seemed to me to be lacking in force
and in an understanding of national questions. I inquired for the joint de

bates between candidates, with which I had been familiar, and the keen dis
cussion of such national questions as the Missouri Compromise, the Dred
Scott decision, and the Leconipton Constitution. In Illinois the discussion
of political questions was about the only diversion the people had, and they
were accustomed to hear public speakers gifted with the force of persuasive
eloquence. It seemed to me that the California speakers did not measure up
to the standard we had in Illinois; but I was told to be patient until I heard
such speakers as Colonel E. D. Baker, Frederick P. Tracy, Thomas Starr
King, Thomas Fitch, Henry Edgerton, and other orators of repute. I soon
heard these speakers, and while they had culture of a high order, they lacked
the plain homely frontier character of the middle west. But I soon became
convinced that there were political orators in California as well as in Illinois.
Incidentally it may be said that Colonel Baker, the greatest orator of modern
times, was from Illinois and had been an associate of Mr. Lincoln. He had
been trained in the Illinois school of political discussion, and was a master
of the art. He was a soldier, orator and statesman.
While I was in this state of curiosity about the public speakers of the
state, Mr. Stanford was advertised to speak in Santa Rosa on the issues of
the day. lie was a leader of the new party, based upon a new and an untried
platform of principles. The political sentiment of that place at that time
was decidedly unfriendly to the new party and its candidates. Mr. Stanford
was received respectfully, but not enthusiastically. His personal appearance
was impressive. He was then thirty-seven years of age, large of frame, with
a swarthy complexion and something of the plain rugged features of the
frontiersman. He was dignified in manner, with a peculiarly attractive com
posure. His voice was melodious and pleasant; his language clear and ex
pressive. He was listened to by a large audience with respectful interest.
He wasted no time on immaterial questions but went directly into the issues
of the campaign. The platform of the party had declared in favor of the com
mon school system, and insisted that it should be sustained in all of its es
sential features, and its benefits and efficiency extended. The platform also
declared in favor of distributing the public lands of the United States to
homestead settlers, and pledged the party to aid the immediate construction
of a transcontinental railroad. The platform declared further that the Re
publicans of California pledged themselves, and all they had, to sustain the
national administration at Washington. Mr. Lincoln had been elected in the
previous November, and on the fourth of March had been inaugurated Presi
dent. Mr. Stanford had been a delegate from California to the National Re
publican Convention that had placed Mr. Lincoln in nomination, and had ad
vocated his election. He was the President's friend and adviser, and the two
men had much that was in common.
In Mr. Stanford's speech on the occasion to which I refer, he discussed
the platform of the party and declared his adherence to its principles. He
spoke with the eloquence of an honest conviction. He believed that the public
school system was at the very foundation of our form of government; that
the public domain should be given freely to actual settlers for the building
of homes; that the Pacific Railroad should be built at the earliest possible
moment that the people of the Pacific Coast might have quick and ample com
munication with the east. He declared that he was doing and would continue
to do what he could to further the project; and in concluding he paid a
splendid and feeling tribute to the high character and patriotism of Mr. Lin
coln, and his administration, and its purpose to maintain the perpetuity of
the Union.
Elected Governor of California.
It is difficult now to understand how any of these questions could have
ever been a subject of serious discussion; but they were, and the discussions
were vigorous, sometimes violent. Mr. Stanford presented them in an able
and fearless manner in all of the principal localities of the state. He gained
the confidence of the people by his plain, straightforward speech and man
ner, and was elected by a large plurality. His term of office was for two
years. Having become president of the Central Pacific Railroad, then in
course of construction, he declined a renomination. During his term of
office as governor he gave the state a wise and an efficient administration
and was counted one of the "War Governors" of the nation, taking a place in
support of the national cause along side of such governors as Andrews of
Massachusetts, Washburn of Maine, Morgan of New York, Curtin of Penn
sylvania, Morton of Indiana, Yates of Illinois and Kirkwood of lowa.
In June, 1861, and ten days after Mr. Stanford had been nominated for
Governor, he and a few other citizens of Sacramento organized and incor
porated the Central Pacific Railroad Company, under the laws of the State
of California, with Mr. Stanford as the president of the corporation. Con
gress had not then passed the act to aid in the construction of the railroad
and telegraph line from the Missouri River to the Pacific Ocean. That act
was not passed until July Ist, 1562. It organized the Union Pacific Railroad
Company with an imposing array of stockholders, to build a railroad west
from the Missouri River to a connection with the Central Pacific Railroad of
California. Mr. Stanford's associates were not so conspicuous, but they were
men of ability and character. Among them were Theodore D. .ludah, a dis
tinguished engineer, C. P. Huntington, Mark Hopkins and Charles Crocker,
merchants of Sacramento. There were a few others, but these were the men
who afterwards became known in the construction of the road, and in the
affairs of the state and nation in connection with this enterprise.
The object of the corporation which these men formed was to construct
a railroad from Sacramento eastward on the line of the proposed transcon
tinental railroad, and on January Bth, 1563, Governor Stanford turned the
first spadeful of earth in Sacramento for its construction. At that time the
only railroads in the state were a short line from Sacramento to Polsom, a
distance of about twenty miles, and a partly constructed railroad from San
Francisco to San Jose. The construction of these two short lines had been
very-expensive, and were in fact a warning against the prosecution of an
other such enterprise at that time. Railroad iron, locomotives and other
rolling stock had to be brought from the east around the Horn in sailing
vessels; and the cost of all kinds of material was very high, and labor dear
and scarce.
Judge Morrow at this point eloquently told the graphic narrative of the
building of the Central Pacific railroad, showing the indomitable will with
which its construction was pushed forward. He discussed the incorporation
of the Southern Pacific and threatened competition from the Atlantic and
Pacific and Texas and Pacific roads, and continued:
In this way Governor Stanford and his associates met and blocked these
two roads coming from the east at the boundary line of the state, one tempo
rarily and the other permanently. The Atlantic and Pacific subsequently
purchased the Southern Pacific line from Mohave to the Needles, and the
Santa Fe, its successor, finally reached the Bay of San Francisco by an inde
pendent terminal at Point Richmond. The Texas Pacific railroad never
reached the Colorado River, but the Southern Pacific, building eastward from
Yuma, pushed on across Arizona and New Mexico, and met the Texas Pacific
at the Rio Grande, near El Paso, in the State of Texas.
Under another act of Congress passed in 1566, the Central Pacific rail
road, under the name of the California and Oregon railroad, was authorized
to build northward toward the Oregon lino to connect with another railroad
coming south from Portland, Oregon. This line was built and a road opened
to Portland.
Governor Stanford and his associates also acquired control of short lines
by which they reached the Bay of San Francisco from the Sacramento and
San Joaquin Valleys. They also built a line down the coast; and with all
these lines, connections and terminals they secured substantial control of
the transportation facilities of the state, and in 1885 they merged all of these
railroads under the control of the Southern Pacific Company.
I mention these matters to show with what determination, force and
ability these men pushed forward against formidable opposition, and in the
fact of difficulties obtained the substantial control of the transportation facili
ties of the state. It has been said that others could have done the same thing
with the same assistance in national bonds, land grants and other contribu
tions. The fact remains that others, with like opportunities, did not make
the effort, and that others failed, with the same opportunities, to carry to
successful completion, corresponding enterprises. Every transcontinental
railroad coming westward toward the coast, and with which the Central Pa
cific railroad or the Southern Pacific railroad was authorized to connect,
failed at one time or another to meet their financial obligations, and were
placed by the courts in the hands of receivers. Comparisons are odious, and
however tempting this one may be, it will not be carried further.
But it is a fair question to ask: What have been the financial operations
of the corporations involved in the Southern Pacific System? Have any of
these failed to meet their obligations? Have any of them been in the hands
of receivers? AVe find 110 such records. They appear to have paid their debts
at maturity, including the bonded debt and interest due to the United States
by the Central Pacific. Perhaps some credit may be due to Governor Stan
ford and his associates for so having managed these properties that all the
corporations under their control have maintained their financial integrity
from the first spadeful of earth turned 011 the Bth day of January, 1863, down
to the present time.
During all this time of construction, Governor Stanford continued at the
head of the corporations incorporated into this one controlling system. The
people and press of the state protested, and charged that a grasping monop
oly had been formed to appropriate the transportation facilities of the state.
It was insisted that competitive transcontinental lines should be admitted
into tlie state and competition in freight and passen&ei lates seemed.
Governor Stanford and his associates proceeded upon the theory that
whatever monopoly there was in the Southern Pacific system was for the
best interests of the state; that what the state needed was the development
of its extensive and valuable resources, and that to do this it was impera
tive that railroad transportation be extended to all points of the state where
business would justify it, either presently or prospectively; that one cor
poration or one system, witli its connecting lines and terminals, could do
this better and cheaper than several; that additional transcontinental lines
would not be competitive, and would not confer the benefits that were ex
pected by the public.
During the time Governor Stanford and his associates continued in con
trol of the Southern Pacific System they never wavered in their adherence
to this policy Neither did the press nor the public, until very recently,
abandon their opposition to that policy. The Santa Pc came into the state as
a competing road for business, but not with respect to rates foi fi eight and
fares, which now became matters for the Interstate Commerce Commission
and the State Railroad Commission.
This question of railroad competition now comes up 111 a legal aspect.
The Federal Government had submitted to the courts the question whether
the merging of the Central Pacific and its terminals, into the Southern Pa
cific System, is a monopoly in restraint of trade and commerce in violation
of the Sherman Anti-trust Law. This action 011 the part of the government
is now being vigorously resisted by substantially the entiic business inteiesls
of the state, upon the ground that the merging of these connecting lines and
terminal facilities twenty-nine years ago was for the best interests of the
people of this state, and is so now. The farseeing policy that constructed
this system is now approved by the public, and the policy ot Goveinoi Stan
ford and his associates in extending and developing the Southern Pacific
System from ISGS to 18S5 is now the declared policy of the people of the state
of California in dealing with this transcontinental transportation question.
Upon the legal question I express no opinion, but upon the question of policy
I have the opinion of a citizen that the present situation should not be
disturbed.
All Advocnte of Educational Legislation.
I come now to a period of a very different character, when my relations
with Governor Stanford became official, personal and in some respects quite
intimate. In January, ISBS, Governor Stanford was elected by the legislature
of the state to the United States Senate for the term of six years commencing
on March 4, 18S5. I had been elected in November, 18S4, to the House of
Representatives from the San Francisco District, for the term of two years
commencing also 011 March 4, 1885. By reelection I served six years in the
House of Representatives, from 1885 to 1891.
During this time it was customary for Senator Stanford to have frequent
conferences at his house with the California members of the House of Repre
sentatives concerning California matters. These conferences were nearly
always interesting, and sometimes amusing,â€”interesting because they either
related to some matter of legislation before Congress, or something pending
before one or more of the departments in which important interests of the
state were concerned, â€”amusing because of the extraordinary demands made
upon the Senators and members of Congress by their constituents, â€”from
turnip seeds and popcorn to patents for nutmeg graters and flying machines.
We speak of public officials as public servants, but we never use that term
with so much accuracy and feeling as when we apply it to Senators or Repre
sentatives in Congress. They are public servants, practically as well as
theoretically, with only one substantial privilege at their service,â€”and that
is to make speeches in the Congressional Record and send them free through
the mail to their constituents. Senator Stanford never availed himself of
this privilege. He was an efficient, conscientious public servant, performing
all his duties faithfully and cheerfully. He never complained of the burden
of small and often trifling demands.
One of the first subjects of national importance to engage his attention
was that of education, in which he was deeply interested. A bill had been
introduced in Congress by Senator Blair of New Hampshire to aid in the
establishment and temporary support of the common schools. The bill pro
vided for the distribution of seventy-seven millions of dollars among the
several states and territories in proportion to the illiteracy in each state or
territory. The distribution was to be in installments covering a period of
eight years. The bill was fully discussed by the leading senators. In the
course of the debate, on February 25, 1890, Senator Stanford delivered a
speech in support of the bill in which he said some pertinent things about
education: â€”
"In my opinion." said he, "our government can have no higher object
than to secure to the people a high degree of intelligence, thereby assisting
them to the attainment of the possibilities of humanity. Those possibilities
and the beneficence of the Creator to man on earth are one and the same,
for it is obvious that there could be no beneficence in the unattainable. Had
we been given reasonable wants without the means of gratifying them, the
Creator's beneficence would be a failure.
"But when we look around at the sources of supply for our wants,
whether physical or intellectual, we find them inexhaustibly supplied in the
soil, waters, forests, mines and quarries. The raw material is everywhere
within our reach, requiring only the intelligent application of labor and the
control of the forces of nature. How this labor is to be supplied, and this
control obtained, is what education will teach."
He believed in education of the masses, and he particularly favored the

bill then under consideration because it provided for the education of both
sexes alike for their respective callings. He believed in the early education
of the child for the moral influence it would have in forming his character
and in laying the foundation for his future efficiency. He believed in educat
ing all classes for the active duties of life, and for the deeper insight it gave
into nature, and the greater knowledge of her wonderful forces, which, being
understood, developed and brought under control, would enable humanity to
realize the glorious destiny marked out for it by the Creator.
The bill which he was then supporting was defeated, mainly, as I recall,
on constitutional grounds. But he supported other educational bills which
became laws, notably bills in aid of state agricultural colleges, providing for
experimental stations, and a more thorough training in agricultural pursuits.
He was himself an agriculturalist on a large scale, and with his extensive
land holdings he naturally took a practical interest in the industry. But his
interest was much more than personal. He viewed the production of the soil
from the standpoint of the nation's welfare, and believed that the nation might
increase its wealth enormously by the introduction of intelligent, economical
methods.
A Pioneer Advocate of Land Loan Laws.
He accordingly proposed a scheme for government loans on real estate,
which should have the double purpose of furnishing the country with an
elastic currency of sufficient volume to meet its requirements, and at the
same time supply the farmer with money at a low rate of interest to meet
the necessities of his calling, and make agriculture profitable and attractive.
The scheme was a bold one, but it was one in which Senator Stanford had the
utmost confidence, and he was astonished that it did not receive general ap
proval. I think the greatest disappointment he suffered during his senatorial
career was his failure to secure any general support for this bill.
In view of recent legislation, it would seem that his failure was due
mainly to the fact that he was at least twenty years in advance of the times.
Senator Stanford was essentially a progressive, and he was generally a
pioneer in whatever he undertook, whether it was the formation of a political
party, building a railroad, developing some new industry, or founding a Uni
versity. He could see well into the future, and he usually saw his efforts
successful; but in this instance lie did not see his scheme adopted. Now,
I am not going to discuss this financial question in any great detail. Mr.
Gladstone is reported to have said in a debate in the British House of Com
mons concerning some financial measure before it, that there were two roads
rÂ»ilroad timetable, and the other was the study of the principles of banking
and currency. For your sakes as well as for my own, I shall touch but lightly
upon this financial question.
But a few words of explanation are necessary to understand the full
scope and purposes of Senator Stanford's scheme: â€”
The speaker now explained the scope and purpose of Senator Stanford's
scheme, and the financial situation preceding the panic of 1893.
While this financial storm was brewing, Senator Stanford brought for
ward his land loan scheme. He first introduced a resolution in the Senate,
on March 10th, 1890, instructing the finance committee of that body to report
what relief might be provided by the United States government for the strin
gency in the money market, and particularly whether loans might be made
by the government upon mortgages. This resolution failed to receive any
consideration. On May 20th, IS9O, he introduced a bill entitled, "A bill to
provide the government with means sufficient to supply the national govern
ment with a sound circulating medium." This bill provided that the treasurer
of the United States should cause to be printed notes of the United States
to the amount of one hundred millions of dollars, and such additional amounts
from time to time as should be necessary to meet the requirements of the
act. These notes were to be a legal tender for all private and certain public
debts, and were to be loaned on unincumbered agricultural land upon interest
at the rate of two per cent per annum. A loan was not to exceed one half
of the assessed value of the land and for a term of not to exceed twenty
years. No loan was to be for a sum less than $250. The bill provided for a
bureau in the treasury department to administer the provisions of the act.
A few days after the introduction of this bill Senator Stanford made a
speech in its support in which he explained its provisions, and contended
that the plan of loaning money upon land at two per cent, with the privilege
to the borrower of returning it when he had no use for it, would create a
money system that would meet financial expansions and contractions as they
might occur. He did not claim, however, that his bill had been perfected in
detail. What he did claim was that the principle of loaning the credit of
the nation upon sufficient security, to those who needed it, should be ex
tended to the farmers on the security of real estate as had already been done
to the national banks on the security of United States bonds, and that the
financial condition of the country urgently required legislation to that end.
The bill was referred to the Senate Committee on Finance. That committee,
composed it must be said, of able and experienced statesmen, reported on
tfc bill adversely, classifying the proposed scheme with a number of others in
this country and elsewhere that had operated disastrously. The committee
held the bill to be bad in substance, and unconstitutional. Upon this report
the bill was indefinitely postponed.
In January, 1891, Senator Stanford was re-elected to the Senate for a
second term of six years, and be again introduced his land loan bill with
another bill placing the scheme squarely upon a gold basis. In January, 1892,
he made another and more elaborate speech in its support, at the same time
replying to the adverse report of the Finance Committee made in the previous
Congress. He was now thoroughly aroused and defended bis scheme with
great force. A Kansas Senator came to his support, and it looked as though
the bill was about to be considered on its merits, and amended so as to pro
vide against the possibility of an inflated currency. The bill was pending
in the Senate at the time of Senator Stanford's death on June 21st, 1593.
Senator Stanford Eulogized.
At the memorial exercises in the United States Senate on September 16,
1593, and in the House of Representatives on February 12, 1894, the members
of both houses paid feeling tributes to the life and character of Senator Stan
ford. The address of Senator Daniel of Virginia, in particular, was very im
pressive by reason of the eloquent and feeling personality of his remarks.
He referred to the land loan bill in terms that corresponded so nearly with
my own experience that I venture to repeat them here:â€”
"He (Senator Stanford) had some ideas which he was never able to im
press upon his associates as being practicable, among them liis idea of lend
ing vast amounts of money upon land. I have talked with him for hours and
hours upon repeated occasions on that theme, and he often urged me to adopt
his views and advocate them. I could neever see that they were practicable,
and with all my respect for him and desire to meet his wishes T could not,
of course, comply with his request. Yet let me say that beneath the difficul
ties which present themselves to such an idea as he had formed, there are
in it germs of truth and wisdom such as are found in the first evolutions of
invention, which, in a later and riper day of the world's history, may be de
veloped into much that is attainable and good. ... As the world's pop
ulation shall increase, and as financial refinements and facilities shall be
developed, there will be found in this idea much to build upon, and in the
end probably some ripe consummation."
How gracious and candid this was: This was twenty years ago. We have
experienced some squally financial times since then. The period commenced
with the panic of 1893 and included the panic of 1907: but the country has
made substantial progress in its financial system during this time, and in
the direction of Senator Stanford's scheme. This progress will be found in
the recent act of December 23, 1913, providing for reserve banks and an
elastic currency, with gold as the standard of values. Mr. Horace White,
the well known editor and financial expert, writing of this act in the North
American Review, says: â€”
"Twenty years was required to prepare public opinion, including that of
bankers and congressmen, for the adoption of asset currency in the place of
bond currency."
Judge Morrow proceeded to show that present financial legislation rests
upon the basic principle of Senator Stanford's land loan bill.
The Founding of Stanford University.
We come now to the last and most impressive and important act of Sen
ator Stanford's remarkable career, â€”the founding of this great university,
when he said, "The children of California shall be my children." In this act
we associate the name of that true and faithful companion and devoted wife,
Jane Lathrop Stanford. The founding of this university was the blending of
the pride and glory of both of their lives, in a vision of higher needs and
deeper realities. For thirty-five years they had been co-workers in all of
the affairs of life, reaching out to noble works and generous deeds. But now,
in memory of their idolized son, they lovingly united in founding this institu
tion as a perpetual memorial to his youthful ambition to better the world by
education.
In January, 1885, Senator Stanford submitted to the legislature of this
state an act to advance learning, and the arts and sciences, by providing for
the foundation and endowment within the state of universities and other
institutions of learning. This act passed both houses of the legislature and
was approved by the Governor on March 9th, 1885, â€”twenty-nine years ago
to-day. This act was general in its terms in accordance with the constitu
tional requirement, but was intended to be and was in fact the foundation
of this university. It is a happy coincidence that we commemorate the birth
of the founder, Leland Stanford, and the foundation act, on the same day.
Selection of the First President.
The seection of the first president for this university was a matter of
very serious concern with Senator and Mrs. Stanford. Their ideal of a presi
dent was as exceptional and as exalted as their ideal of the institution they
were founding; and accordingly the whole field of eligible persons was thor
oughly canvassed, and the qualifications of each carefully weighed with re
spect to the immediate work of organization, as well as ability to project the
lines of future development. It was from such a process of weighing and
sifting that the selection fell upon that distinguished scientist and able
executive, David Starr Jordan.
Senator and Mrs. Stanford were very earnest and very laborious in the
effort to frame the outline of an institution whose teachings would be of the
highest character. They believed in the value of present knowledge, but they
also believed in the value of work expended in the discovery of new truths.
They believed in teaching the student how to thread his way through the
known regions of knowledge, but they also believed in extending the boun
daries of knowledge into the unexplored; that humanity might know and
possess its inheritance. An institution to correspond to such a plan must
necessarily be a growth, the result of the slow process of evolution.
"Every true man," says Emerson, "is a cause, a country and an age;
requires infinite spaces and numbers and time fully to accomplish his design."
We look upon this university in that light, and behold it in the process
of development reflecting the spirit and purpose of its founders. We see
now the university taking its place as a force in the march of progress, ad
vancing the standards of skill and efficiency, and equipping explorers for new
fields of knowledge in the search for truth. We see it working out its des
tiny in promoting "the public welfare by exercising an influence in behalf
of humanity and civilization, teaching the blessings of liberty regulated by
law, inculcating love and reverence for the great principles of government
as derived from the inalienable rights of man to life, liberty and the pursuit
of. happiness."
We assemble here to-day to recall these works, revive the prophetic
vision of the founders; and pay our tribute of respect to the genius of the
builders who, building as they knew, built for all time.
The Founders' Day address deliv
ered this morning by Judge William
W. Morrow conies from an especially
authentic source, and constitutes the
j most elaborate memorial to Senator
Stanford yet attempted. For this
reason a desire has been expressed
that it be preserved in permanent
| form, and it is accordingly printed
almost in full.
The invitation I had the pleasure
|of receiving from the Faculty Com
: inittee to deliver the Founders' Day
address on this occasion came with
the suggestion that I should speak
from my personal knowledge of the

life and public services of Senator
Leland Stanford. The suggestion
was most acceptable, since it required
nothing more serious or exacting than
the recalling of events in the general
order of a narrative. This effort has
had a personal interest, and has
brought to my mind many interesting
associations connected with the pub
lic affairs of this state and nation, in
which Senator Stanford was a promi
nent figure, and which 1 think illus
trate in a marked degree his original
ity, courage and strength of char
acter.
My acquaintance with Leland Stan
ford covered a period of more than
thirty years, and during part of that
time my relations with him were of
such a nature that phases of his char
acter were brought under my obser
vation that made me know him as a
most unique, independent and com
manding personality.


Judge William \\. Morrow
He was born at Watervliet, New York, on March 9th, 1824 â€”ninety years
ago to-day. Watervliet is about eight miles above Albany, on the Hudson
River. Ilis father was of English stock, with Irish blood in his veins. This
was a combination from which we might expect an individual possessed of
vigorous Qualities of mind and body, coupled with courage and sound judg
ment, and balanced with a strain of quaint, happy humor. These qualities
do in fact appear to have been inherited in full vigor by the sou. The father
was a farmer, and for a time at least a railroad contractor. These parental
occupations must have given the son an early practical view of the affairs
of life and a habit of constant sell' reliance that would be likely to grow into
marked independence of judgment and will.
We start then with heredity, environment and an early experience favora
ble to the future efficiency and independence of the son, who had, moreover,
the advantage of a good, practical education. He studied law and was ad
mitted to the bar in IS4B. In that year lie yielded to the spirit of the day
and moved west to Port Washington, Wisconsin, where he practiced law. He
visited his New York home in 1850 and was there married to Miss .lane La
throp, and returned with his wife to Port Washington. In 1552 a fire de
stroyed his law library and household effects. This misfortune caused him
to consider the advantage of going still further west, and as a result he came
to California. He left his wife with her father in Albany, New York, and
reached California in July, 1552. He visited his brothers who were engaged
in a general merchandise business in Sacramento, and soon after he entered
into the same business for himself at Cold Springs, in Eldorado County. In
1853 he opened a store at Michigan Bluffs, in Placer County,a very prosperous
mining section, and lie also engaged in mining and was highly successlul.
In 1855 he purchased the business of his brothers in Sacramento and the
same year returned cast and brought Mrs. Stanford to California and estab
lished his home at Sacramento.
An Original Republican.
He was an original Republican, and with a few others organized the
Republican Party in Sacramento in 1556. All Republicans were progressives
in those days, and correspondingly fearless. Senator Cole, in his memoirs,
speaking of the Republican Party in Sacramento at that time, says: "The
party at its inception was extremely limited in numbers"; that beside him
self there were "Leland Stanford, C. P. Huntington, Mark Hopkins, Edwin B.
and Charles Crocker, and that besides these there were not for some time as
many as could be counted on one's fingers." But this small party does not
appear to have been ignored by others in the community because of its lack
of numbers. Its members were denounced as agitators, disturbers of the
peace and traitors to the country. Violence against them was resorted to
occasionally, and efforts of intimidation often. Senator Colo gives the copy
of a public notice, printed in large type and posted about the City of Sacra
mento on May 13th, 1856. It was headed, "To Arms," and called upon "all
good citizens to attend a public meeting" at a place named "to devise means
to protect the public welfare by appointing a committee to hang all the leaders
and as many of the attaches of said traitors as may be deemed necessary
to restore the public quiet and put a stop to such treasonable practices."
This notice was understood to be directed against Mr. Stanford and his asso
ciates. It was probably nothing more than a species of intimidation; but
whatever its object it could not have been highly pleasant reading for those
to whom it referred. The historian fails to give us any further information
concerning the meeting. Nobody appears to have been hung; but we are leit
to infer that this little band of agitators followed Franklin's wise advice
given to the signers of the Declaration of Indpendence. They hung together
and thus escaped being hanged separately.
I do not mention these matters to recall ancient animosities, long since
forgiven and forgotten. Mr. Stanford was himself among the first to forgive
and forget, save the humor of some of the situations, to which he sometimes
referred; but T mention these incidents to show you the man in action under
circumstances and conditions calculated to test the strength of his physical
and moral fiber, and his ability to meet the passions and turbulence of a new
community fearlessly and with perfect equanimity.
In 1857 Mr. Stanford was the Republican candidate for state treasurer;
but the party was of such recent origin that its nominations were merely
matters of form to maintain the party organization. In 1859 he was the
nominee of his party for Governor. The Democratic Party was divided. One
wing, being known as the Lecompton Party, nominated a ticket with Mr.
Latham as candidate for Governor, and the other wing, or Anti-Lecompton
Party, nominated a ticket with Judge John Curry for that office. There was
a natural tendency for the latter party to unite with the Republican Party,
as it subsequently did; but at this time there were influences at work in
favor of the Republican Party withdrawing from the field. Horace Greeley,
the editor of the New York Tribune, a man of distinction, and the foremost
Republican in the United States, arrived in California in the summer of 1559.
lie was everywhere received with the greatest enthusiasm and accorded every
consideration. Tie made a number of speeches in the state, and, regarding
himself as entitled by his position to advise Republicans as to their duty, he
proposed that they should withdraw their ticket and support the Anti-Le
compton Party.
The proposition was submitted to Mr. Stanford. His reply was charac
teristic of the man. He declined to withdraw, maintaining with firmness that
it was the duty of the Republican Party to stand by its principles whatever
the result. He preferred to go down to defeat rather than to surrender to
an opposing party the standard placed in his hands by his political friends
and supporters. He was not a mere office seeker. He was charged with the
duty of preserving the integrity of a party organization, and he would per
form that duty. Like Mr. Lincoln he would not be the last to desert. He
would not desert at all. He was defeated at the polls, but be demonstrated
to the people of the state that he was not a weak or an uncertain leader.
He was again nominated for Governor in 1861, and it was in this cam
paign that 1 first became acquainted with him. T was then located at Santa
Rosa. I was anxious to hear him, although I was not then a voter. I had
come to California two years before from the state of Illinois, where political
questions occupied the public mind to the exclusion of almost every other
subject. I had heard such public speakers as Lincoln, Douglass, Trumbull,
Browning and many others of their type. These were all rugged men of dis
tinguished ability, combined with great force of character. Coming here
from such a field of political discussion, my first impression of California
speakers was a disappointment. They seemed to me to be lacking in force
and in an understanding of national questions. I inquired for the joint de

bates between candidates, with which I had been familiar, and the keen dis
cussion of such national questions as the Missouri Compromise, the Dred
Scott decision, and the Leconipton Constitution. In Illinois the discussion
of political questions was about the only diversion the people had, and they
were accustomed to hear public speakers gifted with the force of persuasive
eloquence. It seemed to me that the California speakers did not measure up
to the standard we had in Illinois; but I was told to be patient until I heard
such speakers as Colonel E. D. Baker, Frederick P. Tracy, Thomas Starr
King, Thomas Fitch, Henry Edgerton, and other orators of repute. I soon
heard these speakers, and while they had culture of a high order, they lacked
the plain homely frontier character of the middle west. But I soon became
convinced that there were political orators in California as well as in Illinois.
Incidentally it may be said that Colonel Baker, the greatest orator of modern
times, was from Illinois and had been an associate of Mr. Lincoln. He had
been trained in the Illinois school of political discussion, and was a master
of the art. He was a soldier, orator and statesman.
While I was in this state of curiosity about the public speakers of the
state, Mr. Stanford was advertised to speak in Santa Rosa on the issues of
the day. lie was a leader of the new party, based upon a new and an untried
platform of principles. The political sentiment of that place at that time
was decidedly unfriendly to the new party and its candidates. Mr. Stanford
was received respectfully, but not enthusiastically. His personal appearance
was impressive. He was then thirty-seven years of age, large of frame, with
a swarthy complexion and something of the plain rugged features of the
frontiersman. He was dignified in manner, with a peculiarly attractive com
posure. His voice was melodious and pleasant; his language clear and ex
pressive. He was listened to by a large audience with respectful interest.
He wasted no time on immaterial questions but went directly into the issues
of the campaign. The platform of the party had declared in favor of the com
mon school system, and insisted that it should be sustained in all of its es
sential features, and its benefits and efficiency extended. The platform also
declared in favor of distributing the public lands of the United States to
homestead settlers, and pledged the party to aid the immediate construction
of a transcontinental railroad. The platform declared further that the Re
publicans of California pledged themselves, and all they had, to sustain the
national administration at Washington. Mr. Lincoln had been elected in the
previous November, and on the fourth of March had been inaugurated Presi
dent. Mr. Stanford had been a delegate from California to the National Re
publican Convention that had placed Mr. Lincoln in nomination, and had ad
vocated his election. He was the President's friend and adviser, and the two
men had much that was in common.
In Mr. Stanford's speech on the occasion to which I refer, he discussed
the platform of the party and declared his adherence to its principles. He
spoke with the eloquence of an honest conviction. He believed that the public
school system was at the very foundation of our form of government; that
the public domain should be given freely to actual settlers for the building
of homes; that the Pacific Railroad should be built at the earliest possible
moment that the people of the Pacific Coast might have quick and ample com
munication with the east. He declared that he was doing and would continue
to do what he could to further the project; and in concluding he paid a
splendid and feeling tribute to the high character and patriotism of Mr. Lin
coln, and his administration, and its purpose to maintain the perpetuity of
the Union.
Elected Governor of California.
It is difficult now to understand how any of these questions could have
ever been a subject of serious discussion; but they were, and the discussions
were vigorous, sometimes violent. Mr. Stanford presented them in an able
and fearless manner in all of the principal localities of the state. He gained
the confidence of the people by his plain, straightforward speech and man
ner, and was elected by a large plurality. His term of office was for two
years. Having become president of the Central Pacific Railroad, then in
course of construction, he declined a renomination. During his term of
office as governor he gave the state a wise and an efficient administration
and was counted one of the "War Governors" of the nation, taking a place in
support of the national cause along side of such governors as Andrews of
Massachusetts, Washburn of Maine, Morgan of New York, Curtin of Penn
sylvania, Morton of Indiana, Yates of Illinois and Kirkwood of lowa.
In June, 1861, and ten days after Mr. Stanford had been nominated for
Governor, he and a few other citizens of Sacramento organized and incor
porated the Central Pacific Railroad Company, under the laws of the State
of California, with Mr. Stanford as the president of the corporation. Con
gress had not then passed the act to aid in the construction of the railroad
and telegraph line from the Missouri River to the Pacific Ocean. That act
was not passed until July Ist, 1562. It organized the Union Pacific Railroad
Company with an imposing array of stockholders, to build a railroad west
from the Missouri River to a connection with the Central Pacific Railroad of
California. Mr. Stanford's associates were not so conspicuous, but they were
men of ability and character. Among them were Theodore D. .ludah, a dis
tinguished engineer, C. P. Huntington, Mark Hopkins and Charles Crocker,
merchants of Sacramento. There were a few others, but these were the men
who afterwards became known in the construction of the road, and in the
affairs of the state and nation in connection with this enterprise.
The object of the corporation which these men formed was to construct
a railroad from Sacramento eastward on the line of the proposed transcon
tinental railroad, and on January Bth, 1563, Governor Stanford turned the
first spadeful of earth in Sacramento for its construction. At that time the
only railroads in the state were a short line from Sacramento to Polsom, a
distance of about twenty miles, and a partly constructed railroad from San
Francisco to San Jose. The construction of these two short lines had been
very-expensive, and were in fact a warning against the prosecution of an
other such enterprise at that time. Railroad iron, locomotives and other
rolling stock had to be brought from the east around the Horn in sailing
vessels; and the cost of all kinds of material was very high, and labor dear
and scarce.
Judge Morrow at this point eloquently told the graphic narrative of the
building of the Central Pacific railroad, showing the indomitable will with
which its construction was pushed forward. He discussed the incorporation
of the Southern Pacific and threatened competition from the Atlantic and
Pacific and Texas and Pacific roads, and continued:
In this way Governor Stanford and his associates met and blocked these
two roads coming from the east at the boundary line of the state, one tempo
rarily and the other permanently. The Atlantic and Pacific subsequently
purchased the Southern Pacific line from Mohave to the Needles, and the
Santa Fe, its successor, finally reached the Bay of San Francisco by an inde
pendent terminal at Point Richmond. The Texas Pacific railroad never
reached the Colorado River, but the Southern Pacific, building eastward from
Yuma, pushed on across Arizona and New Mexico, and met the Texas Pacific
at the Rio Grande, near El Paso, in the State of Texas.
Under another act of Congress passed in 1566, the Central Pacific rail
road, under the name of the California and Oregon railroad, was authorized
to build northward toward the Oregon lino to connect with another railroad
coming south from Portland, Oregon. This line was built and a road opened
to Portland.
Governor Stanford and his associates also acquired control of short lines
by which they reached the Bay of San Francisco from the Sacramento and
San Joaquin Valleys. They also built a line down the coast; and with all
these lines, connections and terminals they secured substantial control of
the transportation facilities of the state, and in 1885 they merged all of these
railroads under the control of the Southern Pacific Company.
I mention these matters to show with what determination, force and
ability these men pushed forward against formidable opposition, and in the
fact of difficulties obtained the substantial control of the transportation facili
ties of the state. It has been said that others could have done the same thing
with the same assistance in national bonds, land grants and other contribu
tions. The fact remains that others, with like opportunities, did not make
the effort, and that others failed, with the same opportunities, to carry to
successful completion, corresponding enterprises. Every transcontinental
railroad coming westward toward the coast, and with which the Central Pa
cific railroad or the Southern Pacific railroad was authorized to connect,
failed at one time or another to meet their financial obligations, and were
placed by the courts in the hands of receivers. Comparisons are odious, and
however tempting this one may be, it will not be carried further.
But it is a fair question to ask: What have been the financial operations
of the corporations involved in the Southern Pacific System? Have any of
these failed to meet their obligations? Have any of them been in the hands
of receivers? AVe find 110 such records. They appear to have paid their debts
at maturity, including the bonded debt and interest due to the United States
by the Central Pacific. Perhaps some credit may be due to Governor Stan
ford and his associates for so having managed these properties that all the
corporations under their control have maintained their financial integrity
from the first spadeful of earth turned 011 the Bth day of January, 1863, down
to the present time.
During all this time of construction, Governor Stanford continued at the
head of the corporations incorporated into this one controlling system. The
people and press of the state protested, and charged that a grasping monop
oly had been formed to appropriate the transportation facilities of the state.
It was insisted that competitive transcontinental lines should be admitted
into tlie state and competition in freight and passen&ei lates seemed.
Governor Stanford and his associates proceeded upon the theory that
whatever monopoly there was in the Southern Pacific system was for the
best interests of the state; that what the state needed was the development
of its extensive and valuable resources, and that to do this it was impera
tive that railroad transportation be extended to all points of the state where
business would justify it, either presently or prospectively; that one cor
poration or one system, witli its connecting lines and terminals, could do
this better and cheaper than several; that additional transcontinental lines
would not be competitive, and would not confer the benefits that were ex
pected by the public.
During the time Governor Stanford and his associates continued in con
trol of the Southern Pacific System they never wavered in their adherence
to this policy Neither did the press nor the public, until very recently,
abandon their opposition to that policy. The Santa Pc came into the state as
a competing road for business, but not with respect to rates foi fi eight and
fares, which now became matters for the Interstate Commerce Commission
and the State Railroad Commission.
This question of railroad competition now comes up 111 a legal aspect.
The Federal Government had submitted to the courts the question whether
the merging of the Central Pacific and its terminals, into the Southern Pa
cific System, is a monopoly in restraint of trade and commerce in violation
of the Sherman Anti-trust Law. This action 011 the part of the government
is now being vigorously resisted by substantially the entiic business inteiesls
of the state, upon the ground that the merging of these connecting lines and
terminal facilities twenty-nine years ago was for the best interests of the
people of this state, and is so now. The farseeing policy that constructed
this system is now approved by the public, and the policy ot Goveinoi Stan
ford and his associates in extending and developing the Southern Pacific
System from ISGS to 18S5 is now the declared policy of the people of the state
of California in dealing with this transcontinental transportation question.
Upon the legal question I express no opinion, but upon the question of policy
I have the opinion of a citizen that the present situation should not be
disturbed.
All Advocnte of Educational Legislation.
I come now to a period of a very different character, when my relations
with Governor Stanford became official, personal and in some respects quite
intimate. In January, ISBS, Governor Stanford was elected by the legislature
of the state to the United States Senate for the term of six years commencing
on March 4, 18S5. I had been elected in November, 18S4, to the House of
Representatives from the San Francisco District, for the term of two years
commencing also 011 March 4, 1885. By reelection I served six years in the
House of Representatives, from 1885 to 1891.
During this time it was customary for Senator Stanford to have frequent
conferences at his house with the California members of the House of Repre
sentatives concerning California matters. These conferences were nearly
always interesting, and sometimes amusing,â€”interesting because they either
related to some matter of legislation before Congress, or something pending
before one or more of the departments in which important interests of the
state were concerned, â€”amusing because of the extraordinary demands made
upon the Senators and members of Congress by their constituents, â€”from
turnip seeds and popcorn to patents for nutmeg graters and flying machines.
We speak of public officials as public servants, but we never use that term
with so much accuracy and feeling as when we apply it to Senators or Repre
sentatives in Congress. They are public servants, practically as well as
theoretically, with only one substantial privilege at their service,â€”and that
is to make speeches in the Congressional Record and send them free through
the mail to their constituents. Senator Stanford never availed himself of
this privilege. He was an efficient, conscientious public servant, performing
all his duties faithfully and cheerfully. He never complained of the burden
of small and often trifling demands.
One of the first subjects of national importance to engage his attention
was that of education, in which he was deeply interested. A bill had been
introduced in Congress by Senator Blair of New Hampshire to aid in the
establishment and temporary support of the common schools. The bill pro
vided for the distribution of seventy-seven millions of dollars among the
several states and territories in proportion to the illiteracy in each state or
territory. The distribution was to be in installments covering a period of
eight years. The bill was fully discussed by the leading senators. In the
course of the debate, on February 25, 1890, Senator Stanford delivered a
speech in support of the bill in which he said some pertinent things about
education: â€”
"In my opinion." said he, "our government can have no higher object
than to secure to the people a high degree of intelligence, thereby assisting
them to the attainment of the possibilities of humanity. Those possibilities
and the beneficence of the Creator to man on earth are one and the same,
for it is obvious that there could be no beneficence in the unattainable. Had
we been given reasonable wants without the means of gratifying them, the
Creator's beneficence would be a failure.
"But when we look around at the sources of supply for our wants,
whether physical or intellectual, we find them inexhaustibly supplied in the
soil, waters, forests, mines and quarries. The raw material is everywhere
within our reach, requiring only the intelligent application of labor and the
control of the forces of nature. How this labor is to be supplied, and this
control obtained, is what education will teach."
He believed in education of the masses, and he particularly favored the

bill then under consideration because it provided for the education of both
sexes alike for their respective callings. He believed in the early education
of the child for the moral influence it would have in forming his character
and in laying the foundation for his future efficiency. He believed in educat
ing all classes for the active duties of life, and for the deeper insight it gave
into nature, and the greater knowledge of her wonderful forces, which, being
understood, developed and brought under control, would enable humanity to
realize the glorious destiny marked out for it by the Creator.
The bill which he was then supporting was defeated, mainly, as I recall,
on constitutional grounds. But he supported other educational bills which
became laws, notably bills in aid of state agricultural colleges, providing for
experimental stations, and a more thorough training in agricultural pursuits.
He was himself an agriculturalist on a large scale, and with his extensive
land holdings he naturally took a practical interest in the industry. But his
interest was much more than personal. He viewed the production of the soil
from the standpoint of the nation's welfare, and believed that the nation might
increase its wealth enormously by the introduction of intelligent, economical
methods.
A Pioneer Advocate of Land Loan Laws.
He accordingly proposed a scheme for government loans on real estate,
which should have the double purpose of furnishing the country with an
elastic currency of sufficient volume to meet its requirements, and at the
same time supply the farmer with money at a low rate of interest to meet
the necessities of his calling, and make agriculture profitable and attractive.
The scheme was a bold one, but it was one in which Senator Stanford had the
utmost confidence, and he was astonished that it did not receive general ap
proval. I think the greatest disappointment he suffered during his senatorial
career was his failure to secure any general support for this bill.
In view of recent legislation, it would seem that his failure was due
mainly to the fact that he was at least twenty years in advance of the times.
Senator Stanford was essentially a progressive, and he was generally a
pioneer in whatever he undertook, whether it was the formation of a political
party, building a railroad, developing some new industry, or founding a Uni
versity. He could see well into the future, and he usually saw his efforts
successful; but in this instance lie did not see his scheme adopted. Now,
I am not going to discuss this financial question in any great detail. Mr.
Gladstone is reported to have said in a debate in the British House of Com
mons concerning some financial measure before it, that there were two roads
rÂ»ilroad timetable, and the other was the study of the principles of banking
and currency. For your sakes as well as for my own, I shall touch but lightly
upon this financial question.
But a few words of explanation are necessary to understand the full
scope and purposes of Senator Stanford's scheme: â€”
The speaker now explained the scope and purpose of Senator Stanford's
scheme, and the financial situation preceding the panic of 1893.
While this financial storm was brewing, Senator Stanford brought for
ward his land loan scheme. He first introduced a resolution in the Senate,
on March 10th, 1890, instructing the finance committee of that body to report
what relief might be provided by the United States government for the strin
gency in the money market, and particularly whether loans might be made
by the government upon mortgages. This resolution failed to receive any
consideration. On May 20th, IS9O, he introduced a bill entitled, "A bill to
provide the government with means sufficient to supply the national govern
ment with a sound circulating medium." This bill provided that the treasurer
of the United States should cause to be printed notes of the United States
to the amount of one hundred millions of dollars, and such additional amounts
from time to time as should be necessary to meet the requirements of the
act. These notes were to be a legal tender for all private and certain public
debts, and were to be loaned on unincumbered agricultural land upon interest
at the rate of two per cent per annum. A loan was not to exceed one half
of the assessed value of the land and for a term of not to exceed twenty
years. No loan was to be for a sum less than $250. The bill provided for a
bureau in the treasury department to administer the provisions of the act.
A few days after the introduction of this bill Senator Stanford made a
speech in its support in which he explained its provisions, and contended
that the plan of loaning money upon land at two per cent, with the privilege
to the borrower of returning it when he had no use for it, would create a
money system that would meet financial expansions and contractions as they
might occur. He did not claim, however, that his bill had been perfected in
detail. What he did claim was that the principle of loaning the credit of
the nation upon sufficient security, to those who needed it, should be ex
tended to the farmers on the security of real estate as had already been done
to the national banks on the security of United States bonds, and that the
financial condition of the country urgently required legislation to that end.
The bill was referred to the Senate Committee on Finance. That committee,
composed it must be said, of able and experienced statesmen, reported on
tfc bill adversely, classifying the proposed scheme with a number of others in
this country and elsewhere that had operated disastrously. The committee
held the bill to be bad in substance, and unconstitutional. Upon this report
the bill was indefinitely postponed.
In January, 1891, Senator Stanford was re-elected to the Senate for a
second term of six years, and be again introduced his land loan bill with
another bill placing the scheme squarely upon a gold basis. In January, 1892,
he made another and more elaborate speech in its support, at the same time
replying to the adverse report of the Finance Committee made in the previous
Congress. He was now thoroughly aroused and defended bis scheme with
great force. A Kansas Senator came to his support, and it looked as though
the bill was about to be considered on its merits, and amended so as to pro
vide against the possibility of an inflated currency. The bill was pending
in the Senate at the time of Senator Stanford's death on June 21st, 1593.
Senator Stanford Eulogized.
At the memorial exercises in the United States Senate on September 16,
1593, and in the House of Representatives on February 12, 1894, the members
of both houses paid feeling tributes to the life and character of Senator Stan
ford. The address of Senator Daniel of Virginia, in particular, was very im
pressive by reason of the eloquent and feeling personality of his remarks.
He referred to the land loan bill in terms that corresponded so nearly with
my own experience that I venture to repeat them here:â€”
"He (Senator Stanford) had some ideas which he was never able to im
press upon his associates as being practicable, among them liis idea of lend
ing vast amounts of money upon land. I have talked with him for hours and
hours upon repeated occasions on that theme, and he often urged me to adopt
his views and advocate them. I could neever see that they were practicable,
and with all my respect for him and desire to meet his wishes T could not,
of course, comply with his request. Yet let me say that beneath the difficul
ties which present themselves to such an idea as he had formed, there are
in it germs of truth and wisdom such as are found in the first evolutions of
invention, which, in a later and riper day of the world's history, may be de
veloped into much that is attainable and good. ... As the world's pop
ulation shall increase, and as financial refinements and facilities shall be
developed, there will be found in this idea much to build upon, and in the
end probably some ripe consummation."
How gracious and candid this was: This was twenty years ago. We have
experienced some squally financial times since then. The period commenced
with the panic of 1893 and included the panic of 1907: but the country has
made substantial progress in its financial system during this time, and in
the direction of Senator Stanford's scheme. This progress will be found in
the recent act of December 23, 1913, providing for reserve banks and an
elastic currency, with gold as the standard of values. Mr. Horace White,
the well known editor and financial expert, writing of this act in the North
American Review, says: â€”
"Twenty years was required to prepare public opinion, including that of
bankers and congressmen, for the adoption of asset currency in the place of
bond currency."
Judge Morrow proceeded to show that present financial legislation rests
upon the basic principle of Senator Stanford's land loan bill.
The Founding of Stanford University.
We come now to the last and most impressive and important act of Sen
ator Stanford's remarkable career, â€”the founding of this great university,
when he said, "The children of California shall be my children." In this act
we associate the name of that true and faithful companion and devoted wife,
Jane Lathrop Stanford. The founding of this university was the blending of
the pride and glory of both of their lives, in a vision of higher needs and
deeper realities. For thirty-five years they had been co-workers in all of
the affairs of life, reaching out to noble works and generous deeds. But now,
in memory of their idolized son, they lovingly united in founding this institu
tion as a perpetual memorial to his youthful ambition to better the world by
education.
In January, 1885, Senator Stanford submitted to the legislature of this
state an act to advance learning, and the arts and sciences, by providing for
the foundation and endowment within the state of universities and other
institutions of learning. This act passed both houses of the legislature and
was approved by the Governor on March 9th, 1885, â€”twenty-nine years ago
to-day. This act was general in its terms in accordance with the constitu
tional requirement, but was intended to be and was in fact the foundation
of this university. It is a happy coincidence that we commemorate the birth
of the founder, Leland Stanford, and the foundation act, on the same day.
Selection of the First President.
The seection of the first president for this university was a matter of
very serious concern with Senator and Mrs. Stanford. Their ideal of a presi
dent was as exceptional and as exalted as their ideal of the institution they
were founding; and accordingly the whole field of eligible persons was thor
oughly canvassed, and the qualifications of each carefully weighed with re
spect to the immediate work of organization, as well as ability to project the
lines of future development. It was from such a process of weighing and
sifting that the selection fell upon that distinguished scientist and able
executive, David Starr Jordan.
Senator and Mrs. Stanford were very earnest and very laborious in the
effort to frame the outline of an institution whose teachings would be of the
highest character. They believed in the value of present knowledge, but they
also believed in the value of work expended in the discovery of new truths.
They believed in teaching the student how to thread his way through the
known regions of knowledge, but they also believed in extending the boun
daries of knowledge into the unexplored; that humanity might know and
possess its inheritance. An institution to correspond to such a plan must
necessarily be a growth, the result of the slow process of evolution.
"Every true man," says Emerson, "is a cause, a country and an age;
requires infinite spaces and numbers and time fully to accomplish his design."
We look upon this university in that light, and behold it in the process
of development reflecting the spirit and purpose of its founders. We see
now the university taking its place as a force in the march of progress, ad
vancing the standards of skill and efficiency, and equipping explorers for new
fields of knowledge in the search for truth. We see it working out its des
tiny in promoting "the public welfare by exercising an influence in behalf
of humanity and civilization, teaching the blessings of liberty regulated by
law, inculcating love and reverence for the great principles of government
as derived from the inalienable rights of man to life, liberty and the pursuit
of. happiness."
We assemble here to-day to recall these works, revive the prophetic
vision of the founders; and pay our tribute of respect to the genius of the
builders who, building as they knew, built for all time.
The Founders' Day address deliv
ered this morning by Judge William
W. Morrow conies from an especially
authentic source, and constitutes the
j most elaborate memorial to Senator
Stanford yet attempted. For this
reason a desire has been expressed
that it be preserved in permanent
| form, and it is accordingly printed
almost in full.
The invitation I had the pleasure
|of receiving from the Faculty Com
: inittee to deliver the Founders' Day
address on this occasion came with
the suggestion that I should speak
from my personal knowledge of the

life and public services of Senator
Leland Stanford. The suggestion
was most acceptable, since it required
nothing more serious or exacting than
the recalling of events in the general
order of a narrative. This effort has
had a personal interest, and has
brought to my mind many interesting
associations connected with the pub
lic affairs of this state and nation, in
which Senator Stanford was a promi
nent figure, and which 1 think illus
trate in a marked degree his original
ity, courage and strength of char
acter.
My acquaintance with Leland Stan
ford covered a period of more than
thirty years, and during part of that
time my relations with him were of
such a nature that phases of his char
acter were brought under my obser
vation that made me know him as a
most unique, independent and com
manding personality.


Judge William \\. Morrow
He was born at Watervliet, New York, on March 9th, 1824 â€”ninety years
ago to-day. Watervliet is about eight miles above Albany, on the Hudson
River. Ilis father was of English stock, with Irish blood in his veins. This
was a combination from which we might expect an individual possessed of
vigorous Qualities of mind and body, coupled with courage and sound judg
ment, and balanced with a strain of quaint, happy humor. These qualities
do in fact appear to have been inherited in full vigor by the sou. The father
was a farmer, and for a time at least a railroad contractor. These parental
occupations must have given the son an early practical view of the affairs
of life and a habit of constant sell' reliance that would be likely to grow into
marked independence of judgment and will.
We start then with heredity, environment and an early experience favora
ble to the future efficiency and independence of the son, who had, moreover,
the advantage of a good, practical education. He studied law and was ad
mitted to the bar in IS4B. In that year lie yielded to the spirit of the day
and moved west to Port Washington, Wisconsin, where he practiced law. He
visited his New York home in 1850 and was there married to Miss .lane La
throp, and returned with his wife to Port Washington. In 1552 a fire de
stroyed his law library and household effects. This misfortune caused him
to consider the advantage of going still further west, and as a result he came
to California. He left his wife with her father in Albany, New York, and
reached California in July, 1552. He visited his brothers who were engaged
in a general merchandise business in Sacramento, and soon after he entered
into the same business for himself at Cold Springs, in Eldorado County. In
1853 he opened a store at Michigan Bluffs, in Placer County,a very prosperous
mining section, and lie also engaged in mining and was highly successlul.
In 1855 he purchased the business of his brothers in Sacramento and the
same year returned cast and brought Mrs. Stanford to California and estab
lished his home at Sacramento.
An Original Republican.
He was an original Republican, and with a few others organized the
Republican Party in Sacramento in 1556. All Republicans were progressives
in those days, and correspondingly fearless. Senator Cole, in his memoirs,
speaking of the Republican Party in Sacramento at that time, says: "The
party at its inception was extremely limited in numbers"; that beside him
self there were "Leland Stanford, C. P. Huntington, Mark Hopkins, Edwin B.
and Charles Crocker, and that besides these there were not for some time as
many as could be counted on one's fingers." But this small party does not
appear to have been ignored by others in the community because of its lack
of numbers. Its members were denounced as agitators, disturbers of the
peace and traitors to the country. Violence against them was resorted to
occasionally, and efforts of intimidation often. Senator Colo gives the copy
of a public notice, printed in large type and posted about the City of Sacra
mento on May 13th, 1856. It was headed, "To Arms," and called upon "all
good citizens to attend a public meeting" at a place named "to devise means
to protect the public welfare by appointing a committee to hang all the leaders
and as many of the attaches of said traitors as may be deemed necessary
to restore the public quiet and put a stop to such treasonable practices."
This notice was understood to be directed against Mr. Stanford and his asso
ciates. It was probably nothing more than a species of intimidation; but
whatever its object it could not have been highly pleasant reading for those
to whom it referred. The historian fails to give us any further information
concerning the meeting. Nobody appears to have been hung; but we are leit
to infer that this little band of agitators followed Franklin's wise advice
given to the signers of the Declaration of Indpendence. They hung together
and thus escaped being hanged separately.
I do not mention these matters to recall ancient animosities, long since
forgiven and forgotten. Mr. Stanford was himself among the first to forgive
and forget, save the humor of some of the situations, to which he sometimes
referred; but T mention these incidents to show you the man in action under
circumstances and conditions calculated to test the strength of his physical
and moral fiber, and his ability to meet the passions and turbulence of a new
community fearlessly and with perfect equanimity.
In 1857 Mr. Stanford was the Republican candidate for state treasurer;
but the party was of such recent origin that its nominations were merely
matters of form to maintain the party organization. In 1859 he was the
nominee of his party for Governor. The Democratic Party was divided. One
wing, being known as the Lecompton Party, nominated a ticket with Mr.
Latham as candidate for Governor, and the other wing, or Anti-Lecompton
Party, nominated a ticket with Judge John Curry for that office. There was
a natural tendency for the latter party to unite with the Republican Party,
as it subsequently did; but at this time there were influences at work in
favor of the Republican Party withdrawing from the field. Horace Greeley,
the editor of the New York Tribune, a man of distinction, and the foremost
Republican in the United States, arrived in California in the summer of 1559.
lie was everywhere received with the greatest enthusiasm and accorded every
consideration. Tie made a number of speeches in the state, and, regarding
himself as entitled by his position to advise Republicans as to their duty, he
proposed that they should withdraw their ticket and support the Anti-Le
compton Party.
The proposition was submitted to Mr. Stanford. His reply was charac
teristic of the man. He declined to withdraw, maintaining with firmness that
it was the duty of the Republican Party to stand by its principles whatever
the result. He preferred to go down to defeat rather than to surrender to
an opposing party the standard placed in his hands by his political friends
and supporters. He was not a mere office seeker. He was charged with the
duty of preserving the integrity of a party organization, and he would per
form that duty. Like Mr. Lincoln he would not be the last to desert. He
would not desert at all. He was defeated at the polls, but be demonstrated
to the people of the state that he was not a weak or an uncertain leader.
He was again nominated for Governor in 1861, and it was in this cam
paign that 1 first became acquainted with him. T was then located at Santa
Rosa. I was anxious to hear him, although I was not then a voter. I had
come to California two years before from the state of Illinois, where political
questions occupied the public mind to the exclusion of almost every other
subject. I had heard such public speakers as Lincoln, Douglass, Trumbull,
Browning and many others of their type. These were all rugged men of dis
tinguished ability, combined with great force of character. Coming here
from such a field of political discussion, my first impression of California
speakers was a disappointment. They seemed to me to be lacking in force
and in an understanding of national questions. I inquired for the joint de

bates between candidates, with which I had been familiar, and the keen dis
cussion of such national questions as the Missouri Compromise, the Dred
Scott decision, and the Leconipton Constitution. In Illinois the discussion
of political questions was about the only diversion the people had, and they
were accustomed to hear public speakers gifted with the force of persuasive
eloquence. It seemed to me that the California speakers did not measure up
to the standard we had in Illinois; but I was told to be patient until I heard
such speakers as Colonel E. D. Baker, Frederick P. Tracy, Thomas Starr
King, Thomas Fitch, Henry Edgerton, and other orators of repute. I soon
heard these speakers, and while they had culture of a high order, they lacked
the plain homely frontier character of the middle west. But I soon became
convinced that there were political orators in California as well as in Illinois.
Incidentally it may be said that Colonel Baker, the greatest orator of modern
times, was from Illinois and had been an associate of Mr. Lincoln. He had
been trained in the Illinois school of political discussion, and was a master
of the art. He was a soldier, orator and statesman.
While I was in this state of curiosity about the public speakers of the
state, Mr. Stanford was advertised to speak in Santa Rosa on the issues of
the day. lie was a leader of the new party, based upon a new and an untried
platform of principles. The political sentiment of that place at that time
was decidedly unfriendly to the new party and its candidates. Mr. Stanford
was received respectfully, but not enthusiastically. His personal appearance
was impressive. He was then thirty-seven years of age, large of frame, with
a swarthy complexion and something of the plain rugged features of the
frontiersman. He was dignified in manner, with a peculiarly attractive com
posure. His voice was melodious and pleasant; his language clear and ex
pressive. He was listened to by a large audience with respectful interest.
He wasted no time on immaterial questions but went directly into the issues
of the campaign. The platform of the party had declared in favor of the com
mon school system, and insisted that it should be sustained in all of its es
sential features, and its benefits and efficiency extended. The platform also
declared in favor of distributing the public lands of the United States to
homestead settlers, and pledged the party to aid the immediate construction
of a transcontinental railroad. The platform declared further that the Re
publicans of California pledged themselves, and all they had, to sustain the
national administration at Washington. Mr. Lincoln had been elected in the
previous November, and on the fourth of March had been inaugurated Presi
dent. Mr. Stanford had been a delegate from California to the National Re
publican Convention that had placed Mr. Lincoln in nomination, and had ad
vocated his election. He was the President's friend and adviser, and the two
men had much that was in common.
In Mr. Stanford's speech on the occasion to which I refer, he discussed
the platform of the party and declared his adherence to its principles. He
spoke with the eloquence of an honest conviction. He believed that the public
school system was at the very foundation of our form of government; that
the public domain should be given freely to actual settlers for the building
of homes; that the Pacific Railroad should be built at the earliest possible
moment that the people of the Pacific Coast might have quick and ample com
munication with the east. He declared that he was doing and would continue
to do what he could to further the project; and in concluding he paid a
splendid and feeling tribute to the high character and patriotism of Mr. Lin
coln, and his administration, and its purpose to maintain the perpetuity of
the Union.
Elected Governor of California.
It is difficult now to understand how any of these questions could have
ever been a subject of serious discussion; but they were, and the discussions
were vigorous, sometimes violent. Mr. Stanford presented them in an able
and fearless manner in all of the principal localities of the state. He gained
the confidence of the people by his plain, straightforward speech and man
ner, and was elected by a large plurality. His term of office was for two
years. Having become president of the Central Pacific Railroad, then in
course of construction, he declined a renomination. During his term of
office as governor he gave the state a wise and an efficient administration
and was counted one of the "War Governors" of the nation, taking a place in
support of the national cause along side of such governors as Andrews of
Massachusetts, Washburn of Maine, Morgan of New York, Curtin of Penn
sylvania, Morton of Indiana, Yates of Illinois and Kirkwood of lowa.
In June, 1861, and ten days after Mr. Stanford had been nominated for
Governor, he and a few other citizens of Sacramento organized and incor
porated the Central Pacific Railroad Company, under the laws of the State
of California, with Mr. Stanford as the president of the corporation. Con
gress had not then passed the act to aid in the construction of the railroad
and telegraph line from the Missouri River to the Pacific Ocean. That act
was not passed until July Ist, 1562. It organized the Union Pacific Railroad
Company with an imposing array of stockholders, to build a railroad west
from the Missouri River to a connection with the Central Pacific Railroad of
California. Mr. Stanford's associates were not so conspicuous, but they were
men of ability and character. Among them were Theodore D. .ludah, a dis
tinguished engineer, C. P. Huntington, Mark Hopkins and Charles Crocker,
merchants of Sacramento. There were a few others, but these were the men
who afterwards became known in the construction of the road, and in the
affairs of the state and nation in connection with this enterprise.
The object of the corporation which these men formed was to construct
a railroad from Sacramento eastward on the line of the proposed transcon
tinental railroad, and on January Bth, 1563, Governor Stanford turned the
first spadeful of earth in Sacramento for its construction. At that time the
only railroads in the state were a short line from Sacramento to Polsom, a
distance of about twenty miles, and a partly constructed railroad from San
Francisco to San Jose. The construction of these two short lines had been
very-expensive, and were in fact a warning against the prosecution of an
other such enterprise at that time. Railroad iron, locomotives and other
rolling stock had to be brought from the east around the Horn in sailing
vessels; and the cost of all kinds of material was very high, and labor dear
and scarce.
Judge Morrow at this point eloquently told the graphic narrative of the
building of the Central Pacific railroad, showing the indomitable will with
which its construction was pushed forward. He discussed the incorporation
of the Southern Pacific and threatened competition from the Atlantic and
Pacific and Texas and Pacific roads, and continued:
In this way Governor Stanford and his associates met and blocked these
two roads coming from the east at the boundary line of the state, one tempo
rarily and the other permanently. The Atlantic and Pacific subsequently
purchased the Southern Pacific line from Mohave to the Needles, and the
Santa Fe, its successor, finally reached the Bay of San Francisco by an inde
pendent terminal at Point Richmond. The Texas Pacific railroad never
reached the Colorado River, but the Southern Pacific, building eastward from
Yuma, pushed on across Arizona and New Mexico, and met the Texas Pacific
at the Rio Grande, near El Paso, in the State of Texas.
Under another act of Congress passed in 1566, the Central Pacific rail
road, under the name of the California and Oregon railroad, was authorized
to build northward toward the Oregon lino to connect with another railroad
coming south from Portland, Oregon. This line was built and a road opened
to Portland.
Governor Stanford and his associates also acquired control of short lines
by which they reached the Bay of San Francisco from the Sacramento and
San Joaquin Valleys. They also built a line down the coast; and with all
these lines, connections and terminals they secured substantial control of
the transportation facilities of the state, and in 1885 they merged all of these
railroads under the control of the Southern Pacific Company.
I mention these matters to show with what determination, force and
ability these men pushed forward against formidable opposition, and in the
fact of difficulties obtained the substantial control of the transportation facili
ties of the state. It has been said that others could have done the same thing
with the same assistance in national bonds, land grants and other contribu
tions. The fact remains that others, with like opportunities, did not make
the effort, and that others failed, with the same opportunities, to carry to
successful completion, corresponding enterprises. Every transcontinental
railroad coming westward toward the coast, and with which the Central Pa
cific railroad or the Southern Pacific railroad was authorized to connect,
failed at one time or another to meet their financial obligations, and were
placed by the courts in the hands of receivers. Comparisons are odious, and
however tempting this one may be, it will not be carried further.
But it is a fair question to ask: What have been the financial operations
of the corporations involved in the Southern Pacific System? Have any of
these failed to meet their obligations? Have any of them been in the hands
of receivers? AVe find 110 such records. They appear to have paid their debts
at maturity, including the bonded debt and interest due to the United States
by the Central Pacific. Perhaps some credit may be due to Governor Stan
ford and his associates for so having managed these properties that all the
corporations under their control have maintained their financial integrity
from the first spadeful of earth turned 011 the Bth day of January, 1863, down
to the present time.
During all this time of construction, Governor Stanford continued at the
head of the corporations incorporated into this one controlling system. The
people and press of the state protested, and charged that a grasping monop
oly had been formed to appropriate the transportation facilities of the state.
It was insisted that competitive transcontinental lines should be admitted
into tlie state and competition in freight and passen&ei lates seemed.
Governor Stanford and his associates proceeded upon the theory that
whatever monopoly there was in the Southern Pacific system was for the
best interests of the state; that what the state needed was the development
of its extensive and valuable resources, and that to do this it was impera
tive that railroad transportation be extended to all points of the state where
business would justify it, either presently or prospectively; that one cor
poration or one system, witli its connecting lines and terminals, could do
this better and cheaper than several; that additional transcontinental lines
would not be competitive, and would not confer the benefits that were ex
pected by the public.
During the time Governor Stanford and his associates continued in con
trol of the Southern Pacific System they never wavered in their adherence
to this policy Neither did the press nor the public, until very recently,
abandon their opposition to that policy. The Santa Pc came into the state as
a competing road for business, but not with respect to rates foi fi eight and
fares, which now became matters for the Interstate Commerce Commission
and the State Railroad Commission.
This question of railroad competition now comes up 111 a legal aspect.
The Federal Government had submitted to the courts the question whether
the merging of the Central Pacific and its terminals, into the Southern Pa
cific System, is a monopoly in restraint of trade and commerce in violation
of the Sherman Anti-trust Law. This action 011 the part of the government
is now being vigorously resisted by substantially the entiic business inteiesls
of the state, upon the ground that the merging of these connecting lines and
terminal facilities twenty-nine years ago was for the best interests of the
people of this state, and is so now. The farseeing policy that constructed
this system is now approved by the public, and the policy ot Goveinoi Stan
ford and his associates in extending and developing the Southern Pacific
System from ISGS to 18S5 is now the declared policy of the people of the state
of California in dealing with this transcontinental transportation question.
Upon the legal question I express no opinion, but upon the question of policy
I have the opinion of a citizen that the present situation should not be
disturbed.
All Advocnte of Educational Legislation.
I come now to a period of a very different character, when my relations
with Governor Stanford became official, personal and in some respects quite
intimate. In January, ISBS, Governor Stanford was elected by the legislature
of the state to the United States Senate for the term of six years commencing
on March 4, 18S5. I had been elected in November, 18S4, to the House of
Representatives from the San Francisco District, for the term of two years
commencing also 011 March 4, 1885. By reelection I served six years in the
House of Representatives, from 1885 to 1891.
During this time it was customary for Senator Stanford to have frequent
conferences at his house with the California members of the House of Repre
sentatives concerning California matters. These conferences were nearly
always interesting, and sometimes amusing,â€”interesting because they either
related to some matter of legislation before Congress, or something pending
before one or more of the departments in which important interests of the
state were concerned, â€”amusing because of the extraordinary demands made
upon the Senators and members of Congress by their constituents, â€”from
turnip seeds and popcorn to patents for nutmeg graters and flying machines.
We speak of public officials as public servants, but we never use that term
with so much accuracy and feeling as when we apply it to Senators or Repre
sentatives in Congress. They are public servants, practically as well as
theoretically, with only one substantial privilege at their service,â€”and that
is to make speeches in the Congressional Record and send them free through
the mail to their constituents. Senator Stanford never availed himself of
this privilege. He was an efficient, conscientious public servant, performing
all his duties faithfully and cheerfully. He never complained of the burden
of small and often trifling demands.
One of the first subjects of national importance to engage his attention
was that of education, in which he was deeply interested. A bill had been
introduced in Congress by Senator Blair of New Hampshire to aid in the
establishment and temporary support of the common schools. The bill pro
vided for the distribution of seventy-seven millions of dollars among the
several states and territories in proportion to the illiteracy in each state or
territory. The distribution was to be in installments covering a period of
eight years. The bill was fully discussed by the leading senators. In the
course of the debate, on February 25, 1890, Senator Stanford delivered a
speech in support of the bill in which he said some pertinent things about
education: â€”
"In my opinion." said he, "our government can have no higher object
than to secure to the people a high degree of intelligence, thereby assisting
them to the attainment of the possibilities of humanity. Those possibilities
and the beneficence of the Creator to man on earth are one and the same,
for it is obvious that there could be no beneficence in the unattainable. Had
we been given reasonable wants without the means of gratifying them, the
Creator's beneficence would be a failure.
"But when we look around at the sources of supply for our wants,
whether physical or intellectual, we find them inexhaustibly supplied in the
soil, waters, forests, mines and quarries. The raw material is everywhere
within our reach, requiring only the intelligent application of labor and the
control of the forces of nature. How this labor is to be supplied, and this
control obtained, is what education will teach."
He believed in education of the masses, and he particularly favored the

bill then under consideration because it provided for the education of both
sexes alike for their respective callings. He believed in the early education
of the child for the moral influence it would have in forming his character
and in laying the foundation for his future efficiency. He believed in educat
ing all classes for the active duties of life, and for the deeper insight it gave
into nature, and the greater knowledge of her wonderful forces, which, being
understood, developed and brought under control, would enable humanity to
realize the glorious destiny marked out for it by the Creator.
The bill which he was then supporting was defeated, mainly, as I recall,
on constitutional grounds. But he supported other educational bills which
became laws, notably bills in aid of state agricultural colleges, providing for
experimental stations, and a more thorough training in agricultural pursuits.
He was himself an agriculturalist on a large scale, and with his extensive
land holdings he naturally took a practical interest in the industry. But his
interest was much more than personal. He viewed the production of the soil
from the standpoint of the nation's welfare, and believed that the nation might
increase its wealth enormously by the introduction of intelligent, economical
methods.
A Pioneer Advocate of Land Loan Laws.
He accordingly proposed a scheme for government loans on real estate,
which should have the double purpose of furnishing the country with an
elastic currency of sufficient volume to meet its requirements, and at the
same time supply the farmer with money at a low rate of interest to meet
the necessities of his calling, and make agriculture profitable and attractive.
The scheme was a bold one, but it was one in which Senator Stanford had the
utmost confidence, and he was astonished that it did not receive general ap
proval. I think the greatest disappointment he suffered during his senatorial
career was his failure to secure any general support for this bill.
In view of recent legislation, it would seem that his failure was due
mainly to the fact that he was at least twenty years in advance of the times.
Senator Stanford was essentially a progressive, and he was generally a
pioneer in whatever he undertook, whether it was the formation of a political
party, building a railroad, developing some new industry, or founding a Uni
versity. He could see well into the future, and he usually saw his efforts
successful; but in this instance lie did not see his scheme adopted. Now,
I am not going to discuss this financial question in any great detail. Mr.
Gladstone is reported to have said in a debate in the British House of Com
mons concerning some financial measure before it, that there were two roads
rÂ»ilroad timetable, and the other was the study of the principles of banking
and currency. For your sakes as well as for my own, I shall touch but lightly
upon this financial question.
But a few words of explanation are necessary to understand the full
scope and purposes of Senator Stanford's scheme: â€”
The speaker now explained the scope and purpose of Senator Stanford's
scheme, and the financial situation preceding the panic of 1893.
While this financial storm was brewing, Senator Stanford brought for
ward his land loan scheme. He first introduced a resolution in the Senate,
on March 10th, 1890, instructing the finance committee of that body to report
what relief might be provided by the United States government for the strin
gency in the money market, and particularly whether loans might be made
by the government upon mortgages. This resolution failed to receive any
consideration. On May 20th, IS9O, he introduced a bill entitled, "A bill to
provide the government with means sufficient to supply the national govern
ment with a sound circulating medium." This bill provided that the treasurer
of the United States should cause to be printed notes of the United States
to the amount of one hundred millions of dollars, and such additional amounts
from time to time as should be necessary to meet the requirements of the
act. These notes were to be a legal tender for all private and certain public
debts, and were to be loaned on unincumbered agricultural land upon interest
at the rate of two per cent per annum. A loan was not to exceed one half
of the assessed value of the land and for a term of not to exceed twenty
years. No loan was to be for a sum less than $250. The bill provided for a
bureau in the treasury department to administer the provisions of the act.
A few days after the introduction of this bill Senator Stanford made a
speech in its support in which he explained its provisions, and contended
that the plan of loaning money upon land at two per cent, with the privilege
to the borrower of returning it when he had no use for it, would create a
money system that would meet financial expansions and contractions as they
might occur. He did not claim, however, that his bill had been perfected in
detail. What he did claim was that the principle of loaning the credit of
the nation upon sufficient security, to those who needed it, should be ex
tended to the farmers on the security of real estate as had already been done
to the national banks on the security of United States bonds, and that the
financial condition of the country urgently required legislation to that end.
The bill was referred to the Senate Committee on Finance. That committee,
composed it must be said, of able and experienced statesmen, reported on
tfc bill adversely, classifying the proposed scheme with a number of others in
this country and elsewhere that had operated disastrously. The committee
held the bill to be bad in substance, and unconstitutional. Upon this report
the bill was indefinitely postponed.
In January, 1891, Senator Stanford was re-elected to the Senate for a
second term of six years, and be again introduced his land loan bill with
another bill placing the scheme squarely upon a gold basis. In January, 1892,
he made another and more elaborate speech in its support, at the same time
replying to the adverse report of the Finance Committee made in the previous
Congress. He was now thoroughly aroused and defended bis scheme with
great force. A Kansas Senator came to his support, and it looked as though
the bill was about to be considered on its merits, and amended so as to pro
vide against the possibility of an inflated currency. The bill was pending
in the Senate at the time of Senator Stanford's death on June 21st, 1593.
Senator Stanford Eulogized.
At the memorial exercises in the United States Senate on September 16,
1593, and in the House of Representatives on February 12, 1894, the members
of both houses paid feeling tributes to the life and character of Senator Stan
ford. The address of Senator Daniel of Virginia, in particular, was very im
pressive by reason of the eloquent and feeling personality of his remarks.
He referred to the land loan bill in terms that corresponded so nearly with
my own experience that I venture to repeat them here:â€”
"He (Senator Stanford) had some ideas which he was never able to im
press upon his associates as being practicable, among them liis idea of lend
ing vast amounts of money upon land. I have talked with him for hours and
hours upon repeated occasions on that theme, and he often urged me to adopt
his views and advocate them. I could neever see that they were practicable,
and with all my respect for him and desire to meet his wishes T could not,
of course, comply with his request. Yet let me say that beneath the difficul
ties which present themselves to such an idea as he had formed, there are
in it germs of truth and wisdom such as are found in the first evolutions of
invention, which, in a later and riper day of the world's history, may be de
veloped into much that is attainable and good. ... As the world's pop
ulation shall increase, and as financial refinements and facilities shall be
developed, there will be found in this idea much to build upon, and in the
end probably some ripe consummation."
How gracious and candid this was: This was twenty years ago. We have
experienced some squally financial times since then. The period commenced
with the panic of 1893 and included the panic of 1907: but the country has
made substantial progress in its financial system during this time, and in
the direction of Senator Stanford's scheme. This progress will be found in
the recent act of December 23, 1913, providing for reserve banks and an
elastic currency, with gold as the standard of values. Mr. Horace White,
the well known editor and financial expert, writing of this act in the North
American Review, says: â€”
"Twenty years was required to prepare public opinion, including that of
bankers and congressmen, for the adoption of asset currency in the place of
bond currency."
Judge Morrow proceeded to show that present financial legislation rests
upon the basic principle of Senator Stanford's land loan bill.
The Founding of Stanford University.
We come now to the last and most impressive and important act of Sen
ator Stanford's remarkable career, â€”the founding of this great university,
when he said, "The children of California shall be my children." In this act
we associate the name of that true and faithful companion and devoted wife,
Jane Lathrop Stanford. The founding of this university was the blending of
the pride and glory of both of their lives, in a vision of higher needs and
deeper realities. For thirty-five years they had been co-workers in all of
the affairs of life, reaching out to noble works and generous deeds. But now,
in memory of their idolized son, they lovingly united in founding this institu
tion as a perpetual memorial to his youthful ambition to better the world by
education.
In January, 1885, Senator Stanford submitted to the legislature of this
state an act to advance learning, and the arts and sciences, by providing for
the foundation and endowment within the state of universities and other
institutions of learning. This act passed both houses of the legislature and
was approved by the Governor on March 9th, 1885, â€”twenty-nine years ago
to-day. This act was general in its terms in accordance with the constitu
tional requirement, but was intended to be and was in fact the foundation
of this university. It is a happy coincidence that we commemorate the birth
of the founder, Leland Stanford, and the foundation act, on the same day.
Selection of the First President.
The seection of the first president for this university was a matter of
very serious concern with Senator and Mrs. Stanford. Their ideal of a presi
dent was as exceptional and as exalted as their ideal of the institution they
were founding; and accordingly the whole field of eligible persons was thor
oughly canvassed, and the qualifications of each carefully weighed with re
spect to the immediate work of organization, as well as ability to project the
lines of future development. It was from such a process of weighing and
sifting that the selection fell upon that distinguished scientist and able
executive, David Starr Jordan.
Senator and Mrs. Stanford were very earnest and very laborious in the
effort to frame the outline of an institution whose teachings would be of the
highest character. They believed in the value of present knowledge, but they
also believed in the value of work expended in the discovery of new truths.
They believed in teaching the student how to thread his way through the
known regions of knowledge, but they also believed in extending the boun
daries of knowledge into the unexplored; that humanity might know and
possess its inheritance. An institution to correspond to such a plan must
necessarily be a growth, the result of the slow process of evolution.
"Every true man," says Emerson, "is a cause, a country and an age;
requires infinite spaces and numbers and time fully to accomplish his design."
We look upon this university in that light, and behold it in the process
of development reflecting the spirit and purpose of its founders. We see
now the university taking its place as a force in the march of progress, ad
vancing the standards of skill and efficiency, and equipping explorers for new
fields of knowledge in the search for truth. We see it working out its des
tiny in promoting "the public welfare by exercising an influence in behalf
of humanity and civilization, teaching the blessings of liberty regulated by
law, inculcating love and reverence for the great principles of government
as derived from the inalienable rights of man to life, liberty and the pursuit
of. happiness."
We assemble here to-day to recall these works, revive the prophetic
vision of the founders; and pay our tribute of respect to the genius of the
builders who, building as they knew, built for all time.
