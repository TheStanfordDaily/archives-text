## HOLIDAY EXHIBITION MARKED BY LACK OF FEATURES Errors by Shafer and Stanley in Opening Frame Are Costly to Graduates And Cardinal Applies Whitewash 
### 
College ballplayers and former col
lege ballplayers, some of them from
the I3ig Leagues, played rather fea
tureless ball on. the Stanford diamond
this afternoon. One to nothing meas
ured Stanford's advantage in the con
test. Hayes and Stanley worked In
the box for the rival teams, and
pitched good ball. Stanford scored
its lonely tally in the first on errors
chalked up against Shafer and Stan
ley. The visitors outbatted the Cardi
nal players to the extent of eight hits
to five.
After Terry's men had retired the
visitors in one-two-three order, Work
man scored in Stanford's half of the
first. The first sacker got on through
Shafer's error, second on Dent's field
er's choice, and crossed the plate on
Stanley's error.
Dent and Workman ended the next,
session by catching Mow Mitchell
neatly off first, and the second frame
was scoreless on both sides, as were
the third and fourth.
The game in the fifth was also
featureless, Terry alone coming -o
the with a pretty scoop and peg.
In the seventh, with Stanley on basas,
Mars singled, but was caught return
ing to second after Bricker's hit to
center, the ball being handled by Day,
Hayes, and Storey, lioeckel retired
the side by striking out. In Stan
ford's half Dooling singled, and Mc-
Closkey sacrificed him to second, but
lie was caught en route to third on
Hayes' hit. Hayes was caught off
first 011 a hidden ball skit.

Art Shafer in an attempt to pilfer

bunt, and Story filled the bases, only
to have Day fly out to Bricker.
