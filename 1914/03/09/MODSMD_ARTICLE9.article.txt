# A 						PIONEER MEMORY

" 'When we were quiet again, the Senator talked to us informally,
as though we were in reality his children as he had said we were to he.
It was an earnest talk, about his ideals of what the University was yet
to be, and his hope for their fulfillment; of economy and judicious
living; and of endeavor to be of use in the world. It was a privilege
to stand there listening. He appealed to each one of us individually.
We could not know then how few more such opportunities we were
to have. When he had finished, the dining-room doors slid back—it
was all a put-up job. that serenade —and it was Mrs. Stanford's turn.
After the supper, we gathered for a little personal talk with both of
them, then we had some more mandolin music, and Baker sang 'Su
wanee River' to Capron's accompaniment.
" 'That evening brought the Founders pretty close to the crowd.
It was a good thing to have happen, it began things right. Then, you
know, lie died suddenly, in vacation. I was in Yosemitc. When term
opened, it was hard to get used to seeing her driving around the cam
pus alone. I don't think any of the people who came after those early
days can ever be so loyal to the Founders, to the person of one and
the memory of the other, as we are. I'm sure none of us who went
over serenading that night will ever forget it. It's one of the pioneer
memories.' " —From "Two Pioneers and an Audience," in Field and
Irwin, "Stanford Stories,'' at pp. 130-131.
