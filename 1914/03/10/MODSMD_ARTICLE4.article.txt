# OLD VARSITY ATHLETES MAY BE ASSEMBLED HERE
## NEW IDEA IS TO PERSONALLY AWARD “S” CARDS 450 Stanford Men Have Earned Block Letters and Will Receive Certificates as Proof. 
### 
So great is the interest developing
|in the idea of conferring certificates
upon all Stanford's old varsity ath
j lotos that it is now suggested that, in
i stead of sending them through the
mail, the certificates be formally is
sued as an interesting feature of this
year's Commencement Week, to at
tract a great convocation of old var
sity men.
About 450 former Stanford athletes
have qualified for the varsity trophy.
To each of these will be awarded the
beautiful little engraved form, having
a large embossed cardinal block "S"
at the center and being specially let
tered with the individual's name and
the years of his varsity standing in
each sport.
Additional distinction will be given
to all those who have ever scored var
sity points or won four stars for four
years of varsity rating in any one
sport.
For example, the certificate of diet
Murphy, '00. winner of nine varsity
"S's," will be inscribed in one corner:
"Points—football 10, baseball 12, track
I 2," and in tiie other corner "Four-star
in football and baseball."
The executive committee has now
in its possession a completed record
of all Stanford's varsity point-winners
j from the beginning. They are ar
i ranged in sequence by classes and
j with the points in different sport col
umns. Of four-star men there are
about thirty.
There are 242 old varsity point
winners and 23 who are still in col
lege. These 265 men have scored all
the points Stanford has ever made
against California in football, base
ball, and track.
The compilation shows at a glance
the point-winning prowess of each
class. The average for four years for
a class is 13 point-men, 3 varsity cap
tains, 1 four-star man, 9 football
points, 15 baseball runs, 47 track
points, 1 win at tennis, and a total of
72 points.
Of the classes now in college, with
other opportunities to increase their
points, '14 has 51 9-14 points, 'lo has
12 points, '10 has 29 3-5 points, and
17 has the unprecedented first-semes
ter total to 13 points, which promises
well for ultimate high standing
among Stanford's greatest point-scor
ing classes.
Four classes have exceeded 100
points. The class of '95 stands first
in total of points, 139; first in num
ber of four-star men, 5; first in num
ber of varsity captains, 6; first in
number of baseball runs, 79; second
in number of tennis wins, 5; sixth in
number of football points, 14, and
eleventh in number of track points,
41.
'OS is second in total points with
122 17-00, second in track points with
83 47-CO, first in football points with
32.
'9S is third in total points with
119 1-2, first in tennis wins with 7
victories, second in football with 24
points.
'03 is fourth in total points with
110 1-6.
'04 is sixth with 90 1-4 points, but
first in track with S4 3-4.
The class of '13 made 67 281-420
points, and is in eleventh place, but
stands a chance of increasing its total.
The smallest class total is that of
'06, with 16 points.
The classes of '06, '07, '08, and '09
had but three field-days, because of
the earthquake, and the class of '95
had none till its Sophomore year.
Otherwise the scores of these five
classes might have been greater.
The peculiar fractions are due to
multiple tying for third place in some
events. For instance, the certificates
of Poake, '12, and Bui ware, '14, would
each show but 1-7 of a varsity point.
That of Verne Stevens, '13, would
show 1 64-105 points.
The compilation of point-men is so
arranged that home-towns will proba
bly be appended, and then a list made
of the twenty or more towns that have
given Stanford the most points and
point-winners. Interest will center in
the comparative standing of San
Francisco, Angeles, Riverside,
and Pasadena, as the big leaders, and
Ukiah, Portland, Denver, and some
other towns, as lesser Stanford-point
centers.
