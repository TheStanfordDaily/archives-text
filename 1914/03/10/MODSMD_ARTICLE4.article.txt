# OLD VARSITY ATHLETES MAY BE ASSEMBLED HERE
## NEW IDEA IS TO PERSONALLY AWARD “S” CARDS 450 Stanford Men Have Earned Block Letters and Will Receive Certificates as Proof. 
### 
So great is the interest developing
|in the idea of conferring certificates
upon all Stanford's old varsity ath
j lotos that it is now suggested that, in
i stead of sending them through the
mail, the certificates be formally is
sued as an interesting feature of this
year's Commencement Week, to at
tract a great convocation of old var
sity men.
About 450 former Stanford athletes
have qualified for the varsity trophy.
To each of these will be awarded the
beautiful little engraved form, having
a large embossed cardinal block "S"
at the center and being specially let
tered with the individual's name and
the years of his varsity standing in
each sport.
Additional distinction will be given
to all those who have ever scored var
sity points or won four stars for four
years of varsity rating in any one
sport.
For example, the certificate of diet
Murphy, '00. winner of nine varsity
"S's," will be inscribed in one corner:
"Points—football 10, baseball 12, track
I 2," and in tiie other corner "Four-star
in football and baseball."
The executive committee has now
in its possession a completed record
of all Stanford's varsity point-winners
j from the beginning. They are ar
i ranged in sequence by classes and
j with the points in different sport col
umns. Of four-star men there are
about thirty.
There are 242 old varsity point
winners and 23 who are still in col
lege. These 265 men have scored all
the points Stanford has ever made
against California in football, base
ball, and track.
The compilation shows at a glance
the point-winning prowess of each
class. The average for four years for
a class is 13 point-men, 3 varsity cap
tains, 1 four-star man, 9 football
points, 15 baseball runs, 47 track
