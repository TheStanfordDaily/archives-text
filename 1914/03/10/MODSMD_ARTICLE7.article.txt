# MORE WORLDS TO CONQUER!
## 
### 
Founders' Day is now a memory; but it is a bright one. llesides
affording numerous and varied pleasures, the day indicated two things.
First, the celebration has found itself. It has been worked out 011 the
right lines and in the right spirit. Those who attended the ceremonies
and banquet of yesterday hope that undergraduates, alumni and faculty,
as March ninth draws near in next and future years, will remember
that Founders' Day, KJI4. was a distinguished success; and with this
for inspiration and example will proceed to build up an annual celebra
tion increasing in meaning with the years.
Yesterday's program also stands for the truth that if the general
and united interest of the undergraduates can be aroused in a good
cause they will produce results. The hearty and active cooperation of
the Student I'.ody was a material factor making for the splendid success
of the Founders' Day Banquet. We have found our power to do actual
constructive work, and the pleasure to be derived from doing such
work. "More worlds to conquer!" is now our cry. When we have
found new objects, in the attainment of which we may bend our united
efforts for the good of Stanford, yesterday's achievement will serve to
indicate the results possible through the unbeatable combinationâ€”energy
and cooperation.
