# BASEBALL TOGS WILL BE CHAPPIE’S NEXT COSTUME
## SNAPPY COMIC HAS WEALTH OF “VARSITY” MATERIAL Full-Page Drawings, Feature Story, Appropriate Verse and Jokes Distinguish Tomorrow’s Issue. 
### 
With an abundance of the so-called
"pep" that always distinguishes the
national game, the Baseball number
of "Chappie" will appear on the Quad
tomorrow morning. This issue is
dedicated to "Cliff" Ireland, and con
tains a great supply of baseball ma
terial.
The first full-page drawing is en
titled "Revenue Cutters," and is the
work of J. Olsen, '15. A picture of
Cliff Ireland accompanied by the dedi
cation occupies the first page. A full
page drawing of a girl illustrates a
verse by Miss Margery Bailey, '14,
who has also contributed the sketch.
These appropriate lines depict one
phase of baseball. "College Romance
in Five Spasms" is the title of a
snappy series of five pictures with a
local background by L. McDermott,
*17.
The feature of the number is a
story entitled "Obviating the Obsta
cles," which was unintentionally
omitted by the English Club in its
volume of "Stanford Stories." It is a
parenthetical yarn by R. A. Griffin,
'17, illustrated by M. A. Oliver, '15,
