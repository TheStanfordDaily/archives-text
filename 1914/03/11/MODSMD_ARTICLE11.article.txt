# THE 						IRISH MARATHON

### 
Enough athletics for everybody, and not too much athletics for the
few. This is the recognized happy medium between the two extremes
n our colleges, the "All work and no play," and the "All play and no
work" factions. Any project tending to bring about more general par
ticipation in sports is a welcome addition to the list of Stanford fixtures.
An apparently declining interest in post-season rugby and Peanut
League baseball has been a regrettable feature of this college year. It
is possible that this condition is due to negligence on the part of those
appointed to conduct these games. If so, all who are interested in pro
moting good sport, good health and good nature among Stanford men
call upon them to discharge their duty. If the condition is due to a gen
eral refusal to participate in the contests, nothing can be done save to
bring about a realization of opportunities lost.
At present we are confronted with such an opportunity, which,
judging from the number of committees being appointed and the gen
eral student body interest, will not be lost. This opportunity is afforded
by the Irish Marathon. Nothing in our athletic calendar furnishes
more good fun; and the light training required is wonderfully bene
ficial. No one, no matter if he never came within speaking distance of
a pair of spikes, has an excuse on ground of inexperience for not try
ing out for his interclass relay team. "Full many a gem" capable of
negotiating the quarter under :60, hides behind a pair of spectacles and
a bashful grin.
