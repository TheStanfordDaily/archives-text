# JUDGE LINDLEY LECTURES BEFORE MEETING OF COIF
## Honorary Law Society Initiates Four Highest Candidates for Juris Doctor Degree. 
### 
Judge Curtis H. Lindley, the great
expert on American mining law, took
the subject of "Legal Ethics" for his
talk at the annual open meeting of
the Order of the Coif this afternoon.
A short extract from his speech
follows:
"While the practice of law ought
not to be inspired merely by the de
sire to make money, still it must pay,
or other professions will be sought.
The field of profit, education and ex
perience has been greatly reduced in
the last few years. Law has become
impersonal, and the interests of cli
ents have been commercialized.
"Still there is always room for a
purposeful lawyer, who will help to
raise the standard for the bar. The
individual struggle for a living has
overshadowed the more serious pur
pose of the profession, and has
brought it under suspicion. To rem
edy tliis condition we must start with
the lawyer himself. There are plenty
of brains and enough physical energy
in the profession, but the ethical
spirit—common morality and honesty
—is what is needed."
Judge Lindley concluded his talk
with a few suggestions to the individ
ual, in regard to his line of action
when he first becomes a lawyer, and
his relations to the courts and his
brother lawyers.
Formal announcement was made of
the election of C'. W. Dooling, '13, R. J.
Miller, '11, C. L. Coffin, '13, and U. A.
Scmtheimer, '12, to the Order of the
Coif, and they were initiated at a pri
vate meeting held immediately after
Judge Lindley's speech.
