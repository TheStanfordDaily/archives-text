given the comedy fit a final dress re
hearsal, and the cast will he pro
nounced ready to present one of the
most enjoyable dramatic attractions
which has been seen on the local
stage.
Both on the campus and in Palo
Alto, the advance sale of tickets con
tinues to lead the box office records
of the year. The elaborate produc
tion of Winch ell Smith's most suc
cessful comedy-romance is promised a
large audience.
In nature, the play chosen by the
Sophomores differs widely from recent
campus offerings. The appeal of I lie
Fortune Hunter" depends on a breath
less succession of events, which are
introduced and disposed of enthusias
tically. Nat Duncan, the Fortune
Hunter, is busy with some part of his
million dollar scheme from first to
last, and he figures out most of his
problems before the footlights, where
they can be followed.
Betty Graham, the daughter of the
village druggist, will be portrayed
with the charm intended for her b>
Miss Inn a Rayburn. The role de
mands most of the qualities in the
category of fetching femininity, and
filled by Miss Rayburn it is played
with interest.
