## ELIGIBLES INCLUDE ALUMNI AND NON-VARSITY PLAYERS New Aggregation Will Replace University of California Club Team of Last Year. 
### 
A California-Stanford Alumni Rug

Club aggregation of last year. The
team will be composed of alumni and
ex-students of both California and
Stanford, as well as students who are
attending the two universities but arc
not eligible to play or are not play
ing with their respective varsity
teams. Last year, the University of
California Club put out a rugby team
which was composed of alumni and
former players of Stanford and Cali
fornia. Probably by reason of its
name, the team became more identi
fied with California than with Stan
ford. "While it made an excellent rec
ord throughout the season, it did not
serve one of its main purposes, name
ly to bring about a closer feeling of
co-operation and harmony in the ath
letic relations between the two uni
versities.
In order to completely remedy this,
it was decided to change the name of
the team. To have its objects and
purposes thoroughly understood, a
Governing Hoard has been appointed
by a committee representing the Uni
versity of California Club, with abso
lute power and complete discretion in
the management and running of the
team. The officers, with the excep
tion of the captain for the season of
1914 are as follows: Commissioner,
Jack Glasscock, Stanford '09; Direc
tor, J. O. Miller, Stanford '08; Man
ager, E. C. Wynne, Staal'ord ex-'O9,
California '11.
The captain for the year 1914 will
be selected at the beginning of the
rugby season by the commissioner,
the director and the manager, but
after this year he will be selected by
the members of the team at the con
clusion of the rugby season. The
duties of the director are to select
the players on the day of the game,
to have power to remove any player
from the game at any time, and to
give such aid and advice to the play
ers as he may see fit. The duties of
the football commissioner are to
represent the team at all meetings
of the Rugby Union, of which the
California-Stanford team is a mem
ber, and to assist the rugby director
in the selection and running of the
team.
The manager will act as treasurer
of the board, and will collect all
money due the team and make all
necessary disbursements. He will be
responsible at all times to the Gov
erning Board.
The University of California Club
has presented to the California-Stan
ford Alumni rugby team the sum of
$70, as a basis for the expenses of
the 1914 season. All privileges of
the University of California Club in
San Francisco will be extended to the
members of the team.
The football uniforms of the mem
bers will consist of a light blue
sweater upon which will be the let
ters "C," "A"and "S" interlocked,
white duck trousers, and royal blue
socks with white band. If the con
sent of the athletic committees of the
student bodies of the two universities
can be obtained, the letters "C," ' A
and "S" will be blocked and inter
locked. the letter "C" being in gold,
the letter "S" in red.
The object of the team is above all
to promote a greater spirit of co
operation and harmony, and to fur
ther the highest ideals of clean
sportsmanship and earnest competi
tion between the two universities in
their athletic relations.
The team will regard itself as but
a practice organization for the two

varsities, and in no way as a con
tender for clul) championships, and
the games will be played in such man
ner as the captains of the two varsi
ties deem may best benefit the uni
versity teams.
The earnest co-operation and aid of
all California and Stanford men,
whether alumni or active students is
requested by the Governing Board,
which has asked for suggestions and
criticisms from all Stanford and
California men who may be interested.

ord throughout the season, it did not
serve one of its main purposes, name
ly to bring about a closer feeling of
co-operation and harmony in the ath
letic relations between the two uni
versities.
In order to completely remedy this,
it was decided to change the name of
the team. To have its objects and
purposes thoroughly understood, a
Governing Hoard has been appointed
by a committee representing the Uni

to have power to remove any player
from the game at any time, and to
give such aid and advice to the play
ers as he may see fit. The duties of
the football commissioner are to
represent the team at all meetings
of the Rugby Union, of which the

student bodies of the two universities
can be obtained, the letters "C," ' A
and "S" will be blocked and inter

The object of the team is above all
to promote a greater spirit of co
operation and harmony, and to fur
ther the highest ideals of clean
sportsmanship and earnest competi

their athletic relations.
The team will regard itself as but
a practice organization for the two
