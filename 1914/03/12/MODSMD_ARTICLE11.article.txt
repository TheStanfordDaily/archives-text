# "SAIL ON, O SHIP OF STATE"
## 
### 
Two vain attempts have been made to hold an election of a Univer
sity Conference member from the Economics Department. The first
failure apparently occurred because the serious-minded students of
American self-government in this department could not arouse sufficient
interest in Stanford self-government to attend the election. The second
fiasco, it is said, was due to the fact that no proper representative of the
University Conference was on hand to conduct the balloting.
A body of earnest men launched Student Control at Stanford, and
a good staunch craft it has proved to be. Nothing will so quickly take
the wind out of the ship's sails as general lack of interest in its affairs.
But even more discouraging than this negligence on the part of the
students at large to discharge their functions under Student Control is
the failure of those charged with active duties under it to carry out
these duties. We have no means nor desire to fix the responsibility for
the non-election in the Economics department yesterday. Nor is it in
itself serious. Should instances of this nature continue to occur fre
quently, however, they would indicate a condition inevitably fatal to
self-government at Stanford. Neither Student Control nor any project
of like nature can succeed without realization of responsibility.
