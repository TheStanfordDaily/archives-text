# SHAFER SAYS BRAW JOHN'S OFFERS WON'T TEMPT HIM
## STANFORD MAN BUSY DODGING BIG LEAGUE CONTRACTS Former Student Declares He Is Through With Baseball; Will Enter Business With Father. 
### 
Art Shafer, ex-'l4, the star third
baseman of the New York Giants, who
is on the campus with the Southern
Alumni team, stated definitely this
afternoon that he will continue to
turn a deaf ear to the fancy offers of
a contract which John McGraw or any
other of the major league managers
may insist on advancing. "I have had
my look-in on the game," Shafer de
clared, "and am through for good."
When asked what reply he would
give President Hempstead of the New
York Nationals, who will start for
California tomorrow in an attempt to

swing him back into line, lie said:
"Hempstead will insist on my re
turn to baseball, and will probably
decorate the propositions which have
already been mado. No kind of in


Art SlittiYr
ducement can persuade me to go back.
I have had my look-in on the game,
and am thorugh for good.
"Before I left New York I tried to
convince the Giant officials that my
mind was made up, and that I
wouldn't be tempted. Evidently, from
indications I have received and read
in the papers, they still think they
can persuade me. Two weeks ago I
got two telegrams from Hempstead in
rapid succession, asking me to change
my plans. I didn't think it necessary
to answer.
"Tuesday a wire came from Me-
Graw, renewing the bids. I replied
that I would stick to my first state
ment."
In reply to a question concerning
other offers from the managers, Sha
fer said: "I am a member of the New
York club, and am not open to offers
from other sources. The Federal
League wouldn't hold the least at
traction for me anyway."
Shafer said regarding his plans for
the future: "I am going to Los An
geles Friday, and will enter the real
estate business with my father there.
Later I expect to take up farming with
my cousin, Tom Workman, when he
finishes here."
During his stay on the campus
Shafer has made his home at the Beta
Theta Pi house, of which fraternity he
is a member.
