# Cheese It, the Cop!

Several students narrowly evaded
the hand of justice this morning
when caught by the watchman on the
Quad in the act of placing a well
known Hupmobile out of its natural
element on the raised portion in front
of the library. The mischief-makers
escaped through various doors in the
Economics and Zoology buildings.
