# TRI-CORNERED FORENSIC CLASH IS WAGED TONIGHT
## KAUFMAN, WILLIAMS, WESTON AND IDE UPHOLD CARDINAL Teams From Oregon, Washington and Stanford Will Argue Question of National Budget. 
### 
Tonight the annual Tri-State foren
sic clashes will take place between
the teams of Washington, Oregon, and
Stanford. Four speakers of each uni
versity will contend in debate on the
question, "Resolved, That the execu
tive department should be made re
sponsible for our national budget."
The subject for discussion is of such
an ambiguous nature that many in
ferences may be drawn as to its cor
rect meaning. In view of the fact,
some clever word battles may be an
ticipated.
.T. W. Kaufman, '16, and P. L. Will
iams, '17, who remain at home, will
argue the affirmative of the question
against the Washington debaters, G.
F. Younger and G. Fairbach, who ar
rived yesterday on the campus from
the north. The scene of the contest
will be the Chapel, and it commences
promptly at. eight o'clock.
Those who have been selected to act
as judges are Honorable Frank H.
Carrigan, judge in the First District
Court of Appeals, and Thomas H. Sel
