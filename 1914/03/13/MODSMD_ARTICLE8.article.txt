## REPLACES SCHEDULED CONTEST WITH PASTIME CLUB Coast Athletes and Former Stanford Men to Compete in First Meet of Season. 
### 
The schedule for the track season
has been changed and the first meet
will not take place with the Pastime
Club tomorrow, but instead an all-star
aggregation of track men will meet the
Stanford team in the initial dual con
test of the season. From the inability
of the Pastime manager to gather a
strong enough team to bring down
the peninsula tomorrow, at the last
minute it was found necessary to call
the engagement off. Last Saturday
the club was defeated by an over
whelming score by the University of
California and the object of the meet
was not fulfilled, namely, that of giv
ing practice to the college men.
"Pop" Taylor's invincible Yannigans
will be on hand at 1:30 tomorrow
to give a good account of themselves.
This team will consist of former Stan
ford track men and runners from
around the bay district. The opposi
tion looks fairly formidable, and if
the men are in any kind of condition
should give the Stanford runners a
good workout.
The visitors have included in the
list of entries as posted by Manager
Taylor today the following men: Gates
of the Pastime Club, W. A. Lynn, '17,
Art Shafer, ex-'l4, and B. Dill, gr., for
the sprints; J. E. Wool ley, '12, anr*.
"Babe" Crawford, '09, weights; "Jum
bo" Morris, '08, 'Gene Kern, '13, and
J. H. Whitted, ex-'IG, in the hurdles;
John O. Miller, '08, Clark of Palo Alto
high school and Meredith Cramer, '11,
half mile; H. Tt. Stoltz, '09, Hoenisli of
Pastime Club and C. F. Robb, ex-'l4,
in the 440; G. L. Horine, ex-'l3, and
Taylor, '11, high jump; "Mow" Mitch
ell, '10, broad jump; Kingman of Po
mona. pole vault; and Bonneson of the
Pastime Club for the mile. The invin
cibles will be represented in every
event with the exception of the two
mile.
The Stanford team will be made up
mostly of the new men with a few
varsity athletes entered in several of
the field events. Whether or not many
of the "S" men compete will depend
on their condition after the workout
today, but it is probable that several
will be added to the list which was
posted in the training house yesterday
afternoon. The more experienced run
ners have been given workouts during
the week and will probably limber up
tomorrow morning before deciding
about taking part in the afternoon
competition.
Tn meets with outside teams as
many Stanford men as possible will
be entered against the visiting team.
The rest of the runners will compete
in separate heats. This makes it im
perative that, every man who is out
for track be in togs tomorrow at. 1:30.
Every man on the entry list, which is
posted at the training house, is ex
pected to compete, unless excused.
