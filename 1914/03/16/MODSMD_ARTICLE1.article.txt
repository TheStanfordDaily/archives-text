# HISTRIONIC HONORS FALL TO NINETEEN-SIXTEEN
## SOPHOMORE ACTORS SHOW HIGH STANDARD OF TALENT Clever Underclass Interpretation of “The Fortune Hunter” Entertains Audience at Assembly Hall. Miss Marjorie Tisdale 
### 
The Sophomore play as a mirth
provoker and at 't new talent
surpassed tradition on ao, utday night
at the Assembly Hall when the ad
mirable comedy, "The Fortune Hunt
er," was presented by the class of
1916. Sophomore actors are often
diamonds in the rough, and it was a
very great surprise to find two char
acter actors, P. E. Leland as "Sam
Graham" and F. V. Campbell as "Tra
cy Tanner," whose work was profes
sional in quality, adequate leads in
the persons of Miss Irma Rayburn
and Buford Williams, and an entire
cast which played within the correct
conception of the comedy. The play
presents a lively picture of that un
failing source of amusement, rural
America, and the audience was
wreathed in smiles from the breezy
entrance of "Larry" and "Jim" to the
final downpour upon the oblivious
lovers.
Mr. Leland as the kindly, lovable,
old gentleman "Sam Graham" pre
sented one of the best bits of charac
ter portrayal which has been seen at
Stanford for many years. The pathos
as well as the humor of the sweet
child-like old man were appreciated
by Mr. Leland and blended with a con
sistency rare in an amateur. The real
well-modulated voice. No greater trib
ute could have been paid to the "Sam"
of the second-year production than that
during the embraces between father
and daughter the audience forgot to
emit the peculiar noises which usual
ly greet a stage kiss—an almost in
credible omission.
F. V. Campbell in the role of "Tra
cy," -who survives "workin' in his
father's livery-stable and bein' fat"
and delights the audience unto the
end, was almost equally successful.
The opportunities for comedy in the
delineation of the young Tracy are
many, and were not overlooked. The
youth was a thing of joy to the be
holder, and Mr. Campbell's acting lost
nothing by comparison with the Tra
cy" of the professional performance.
The conventional woman's lead,
which does not give a large oppor
tunity for originality was successful.\
handled by Miss Irma Rayburn, who
effected the change from the petulant
country maiden to the charming
young lady in a very winsome man
ner. Mr. Buford Williams was a very
good, and at times a very clever "Nat
Duncan," and in addition to an effec
tive conception of his role added a
use of facial expression which is
most difficult to achieve.
Misses Terese Dorroh and Florence
Stewart were true to type, and re
minded residents of the small town
of some of their acquaintances. H. V.
Stewart increased this impression
with his blatant, self-satisfied "Roland
Barnett," and "Pete Willing." the
sheriff (G. A. Hughes), and "Hi" and
"Watty," local solons (Messrs. Phil
lips iincl Gunn) perfected the local
color. C. D. Moore used facial ex
pression to excellent advantage in the
second act during the negotiations of
"Lockwood" (Mr. Moore), with "Nat"
across the counter of the Radville
drugstore.
L. A. Dayton gave the impression
in the first, act that ;is "Harry Kel
logg" he was going to be very, very
good, and the impression was borne
ont whenever he appeared. The jo
viality of the group of friends who I
struck ihe keynote in the same scene j
added an effective contrast to the re- j
mainder of the story. "George Burn-1
hame" (R. N. Wenzel) reappeared to j
good advantage in an effort to carry |
out his villainous designs. The mi- j
nor parts were acceptably filled.

handled by Miss Irma Rayburn, who
effected the change from the petulant
country maiden to the charming
young lady in a very winsome man
ner. Mr. Buford Williams was a very
good, and at times a very clever "Nat
Duncan," and in addition to an effec
tive conception of his role added a
use of facial expression which is
most difficult to achieve.
Misses Terese Dorroh and Florence
Stewart were true to type, and re
minded residents of the small town
of some of their acquaintances. H. V.
Stewart increased this impression
with his blatant, self-satisfied "Roland
Barnett," and "Pete Willing." the
sheriff (G. A. Hughes), and "Hi" and
"Watty," local solons (Messrs. Phil
lips iincl Gunn) perfected the local
color. C. D. Moore used facial ex
pression to excellent advantage in the
second act during the negotiations of
"Lockwood" (Mr. Moore), with "Nat"
across the counter of the Radville
drugstore.
L. A. Dayton gave the impression
in the first, act that ;is "Harry Kel
logg" he was going to be very, very
good, and the impression was borne
ont whenever he appeared. The jo
viality of the group of friends who I
struck ihe keynote in the same scene j
added an effective contrast to the re- j
mainder of the story. "George Burn-1
hame" (R. N. Wenzel) reappeared to j
good advantage in an effort to carry |
out his villainous designs. The mi- j
nor parts were acceptably filled.
The Sophomore play as a mirth
provoker and at 't new talent
surpassed tradition on ao, utday night
at the Assembly Hall when the ad
mirable comedy, "The Fortune Hunt
er," was presented by the class of
1916. Sophomore actors are often
diamonds in the rough, and it was a
very great surprise to find two char
acter actors, P. E. Leland as "Sam
Graham" and F. V. Campbell as "Tra
cy Tanner," whose work was profes
sional in quality, adequate leads in
the persons of Miss Irma Rayburn
and Buford Williams, and an entire
cast which played within the correct
conception of the comedy. The play
presents a lively picture of that un
failing source of amusement, rural
America, and the audience was
wreathed in smiles from the breezy
entrance of "Larry" and "Jim" to the
final downpour upon the oblivious
lovers.
Mr. Leland as the kindly, lovable,
old gentleman "Sam Graham" pre
sented one of the best bits of charac
ter portrayal which has been seen at
Stanford for many years. The pathos
as well as the humor of the sweet
child-like old man were appreciated
by Mr. Leland and blended with a con
sistency rare in an amateur. The real
well-modulated voice. No greater trib
ute could have been paid to the "Sam"
of the second-year production than that
during the embraces between father
and daughter the audience forgot to
emit the peculiar noises which usual
ly greet a stage kiss—an almost in
credible omission.
F. V. Campbell in the role of "Tra
cy," -who survives "workin' in his
father's livery-stable and bein' fat"
and delights the audience unto the
end, was almost equally successful.
The opportunities for comedy in the
delineation of the young Tracy are
many, and were not overlooked. The
youth was a thing of joy to the be
holder, and Mr. Campbell's acting lost
nothing by comparison with the Tra
cy" of the professional performance.
The conventional woman's lead,
which does not give a large oppor
tunity for originality was successful.\
