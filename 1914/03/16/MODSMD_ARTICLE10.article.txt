# THE 						POINT SYSTEM
## 
### 
Our little custom here at Stanford of piling- all the college honors
and, incidentally, all the college duties 011 one or two of our fellow stu
dents and making them them drudges whose health and happiness are
seriously endangered has reached a point where a solution of the problem
must be found. If it is necessary, plenty of material will come to light
to fill the offices which are now heaped upon the shoulders of the few.
Last year at a mass meeting of the women of the University the
Point System was brought to a vote and defeated. This year the
Women's Conference will again offer this system as the best solution of
the difficulty. Under this scheme the different offices in women's ac
tivities will count a certain number of points, and only a certain number
of points will be allowed to fall to one person. In this way the work
will be divided, and instead of overworking the few we will develop the
executive powers of the many, and strike a balance in the college honors.
This is the sane and workable solution of our problem and calls for
the support of all of us.
