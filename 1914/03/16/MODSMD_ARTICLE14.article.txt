# Rabbi Meyer Speaks Convincingly.

### 
A very strong sermon was given by
I Rabbi Meyer of the Temple Emanuel
â– in the Memorial Church yesterday
morning. Choosing for his subject
'"Good and Goods," Rabbi Meyer said:
"The apparent reason of being, in
, the course of nations and in the con
j duct of individuals seems primarily
, goods; that is to say the pursuit of
: materialistic benefit. The man on the
street, our type of old-time economic
i conditions and activities, is frankly,
| brutally materialistic, considering only
jgoods and not good.
"It is passing strange," he con
! tinned, "that this frankly materialis
tic socialism lias been able to acquire
j any element at all of good.
"Rut our age lias begun to realize
j the spiritual life side by side with the
material existence. We see this 1:1
lour art, in our literature; we hear it
j in our politics.
"The problem of the spirit is to in
j terpret life n terms of good, not.
.goods. Far better would it lie to have
no church at all than a dead church
I with radical principles. There'is but
I a vision of mankind with a perfect
I self-knowledge, self-discipline and
self-respect through which we learn
Ito express our spiritual selves in
I larger service to our fellows."
The choir rendered the anthem
"Seek Ye the Lord," with the solo by
J. W. Bennett, '16.
