"The College Prince" is a unique
play in that it is really operatic. Re
hearsals indicate that it is an opera
of the professional type and although
it has plenty of local color, it does
not depend absolutely upon it for its
complications.
Coach W. F. Rochester, said to be
the foremost coach in the west, has
trained the choruses in steps which
are very different from the usual
chorus dances. Many of them are of
his own invention, and are very clev
er. One of the biggest song and dance
features will be "My Palo Alto Pal.'
Photographs and posters of "The
College Prince" were put up this
morning. They are very catchy, and

known campus artists. One which is
on exhibition at the Engineering cor
ner—the work of It. Wenzel, '10 —is
