# TRUSTEES ISSUE REPORT TO PUBLIC OF UNIVERSITY FINANCES FOR FIRST TIME
## 
### 
For the 111-t time the university ac
counts were published for the scrutiny
< " the public in the March Alumnus.
They disclose a condition highly-grat
ifying to all who are interested in the
welfare of Stanford. The figures
show not only capable and sound
management of the institution but a
growing support from outside quar
ters.
The trustees do not take into the
balance sheet the campus lands, uni
versity buildings, general and labora
tory equipment, museums, dormitories,
medical school buildings, Lane Hospi
tal, land on which the medical school
stands nor other items which, like
them, are not considered by the trus
tees as assets since they are not rev
enue producers. They have been
paid for out of income or by original
gift, and represent an expenditure
of $6,1T5,058.14 up to July 31, the date
of this statement.
Of the seventeen special funds
shown by the statement, twelve have
been established in connection with the
recently-created Medical department.
This shows how immediately and ef
fectively that branch of the univer
sity work has met with popular sym
pathy and support. A capital sum of
nearly $.10,000 has been added to the
university resources on account of the
Medical department within the last
two years, and this is quite aside from
the original endowments transferred

from the Cooper Medical College.
Since the closing of this balance,
two funds have been established by
outside sources for the benefit of the
Stanford students, the William Bur
ton Barber Loan Fund, established by
Mrs. Anna M. Barber in memory of
her son, a student; and the W. J. Dick
ey scholarship, established by the
estate of the late W. J. Dickey. The
university paid to the state of Cali
fornia last year $46,594.25 in taxes.
That the university is an institution
of free education is proved by the fact
that not an item of receipt from stu
dents is shown in the income account.
The university expends $16,000 a year
more,however, on these accounts than
it receives from students consuming
the materials.
The trustees have by their manage
ment of the estate added $1,761,670 to
the permanent endowment of the uni
versity. Assuming that this sum
brings in an average of five per cent,
the university has already had its in
come increased by $88,000 a year
through the trustees' efforts. It has
been announced that the bulk of the
increase for next year will be devoted
to increases in salaries of the present
teaching staff, in the meantime plans
are progressing for the erection or a
number of new buildings including a
new library, a men's gymnasium and
several other important though less
extensive structures.
