###

University, has presented fifty dollars
to the Student Body for the purchase
of a silver trophy for the intercol
legiate Freshmen crew. Mr. Lathrop
has manifested keen interest in this
branch of major athletics ever since
its institution, and his newest dona
tion will contribute an added inter
est to first-year rivalry on the water
between Stanford and California.

donor, the C. G. Lathrop Cup will be
come the permanent possession of the
University whose Freshman crew first
succeeds in winning it three times.

University should see fit to pro
vide a third contestant, the northern
crew, if successful, would be entitled
to possession of the trophy.
Premature accounts have been cir
culated in other newspapers, but final

ing, and this statement is the first
authorized announcement.
The Varsity crews will compete as
usual for the Scliwabacher trophy,
