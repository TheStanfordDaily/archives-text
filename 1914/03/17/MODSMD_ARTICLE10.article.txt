Chairman W. P. Darsie, '14, of the
Quadrangle Club committee in charge
of the event, today announced the
final arrangements for the big athletic
carnival, along with the choice of
judges and other officials. All mem
bers of either the varsity squad or the
Peanut League are eligible to com
pete, and with the undoubted success
of last year's Field Day as a model,
a large entry list is expected. Com

on the diamond.
The following list of events will be
contested by the cardinal balltossers:
long distance throwing, throwing for
accuracy, fungo hitting, bunt and run
to first base, fifty yard dash, circling
the bases.
Points in each event will be scored,
five going to the first place man, three
to the second, and one to the third
place winner. A beautiful bronze
shield, somewhat similar in design to
last year's trophy, will go to the lead
er in the total score. It is expected
that this will be on exhibition either
today or tomorrow on the campus.
In addition to these features, an iu
terclass relay will be staged around
the bases. Four-men teams will be
entered by each class, and a man will
be stationed at each of the bags. The
first group will run from the home
plate to first, and touch the mem
bers of their respective teams, who
will then proceed to second base. The
men stationed there will run to the
third station, where the waiting wn
testants will start the final dash for
home. The various class relay squads
have not been chosen yet, but it is ex
pected that the captains will make
their selections soon.
