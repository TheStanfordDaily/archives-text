# JOLLY-UP OF FIRST YEAR CLASS SET FOR FRIDAY
## 
### 
The Freshman jolly-up is set for
next Friday evening at the Armory in
Palo Alto. Plans for the first year
informal are rapidly being brought to
a close by the committee in charge.
Several unique and surprising stunts,
with good cats and rollicking dances
arc on the program, but will not be
announced until a later date. To
swell the number of women present
the men will be permitted to ask any
partner they choose to attend the
function, whether they are first year
students or not.
