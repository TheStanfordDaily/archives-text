# THE 						FINANCIAL STATEMENT
## 
### 
If Stanford is going to regard itself as a public-service corporation
and obtain support from the public it must take the public into its con
fidence. In this connection the first release of a financial statement of
the University is of momentous significance. It indicates moreover a
growing tendency on the part of the Trustees to take the other three
elements of the University community into their confidence; and in so
doing to they remove a ground for infinite misunderstanding, jealousy,
moving in the dark and unintelligent criticism —unintelligent to he sure;
but how can criticism be intelligent when the information necessary to
make it so is not available?
Among other illuminating conclusions to be drawn from the
financial statement are the truths that fees which we pay do not go
to the profit account, but make up only a portion of the funds for de
partmental supplies; that business methods have actually stretched the
endowment of the University and made possible the recently announced
increases in appropriations; and that the next step must be to obtain
from the state the tax exemptions which Stanford earns by virtue of
services rendered.
Not only does the statement remove all ground for unnecessary
criticism, but it affords a basis for intelligent, helpful criticism. Such
and such a bidding is in poor repair; such and such a plot of ground
needs grass seed. Students observe these things, but oftentimes fail
to call attention to them, feeling that the University funds will not
afford a remedy. Oftentimes, again, we "crab" about conditions among
ourselves, or cry for articles of fierce denunciation in campus publica
tions. Such methods will not make the grass grow green in waste spots,
but will only tie the hands of those who labor for improvement. The
attitude of the Trustees in publishing this statement indicates that they
will receive well-meant, constructive suggestions. We thank them most
heartily for the statement and for the attitude it represents; we will
take advantage 01 it; and like Oliver Twist we wiii cry tor more!
