# CONVENTION OF STUDENTS ATTRACTS STANFORD MEN
## Interscholastic Athletic Contests Will Be Featured at Pacific Grove Gathering. 
### 
A large delegation of Stanford men
is expected to attend the Pacific Grove
student conference, which will be held
during the spring vacation, under the
direction of the International Com
mittee of the Young Men's Christian
Association I'. S. Gillespie, '16, has
been appointed to head the Stanford
representation, and information re
garding the convention may be ob
tained either from him or through
the local Y. M. C. A. office.
The convention will have its head
quarters at Asilomar Beach, where
excellent opportunities for all kinds
of athletic contests are afforded. A
baseball game between the Stanford
and California delegates has been
planned. There will be a track meet

in which the students of Arizona, Ne
vada and California will participate.
Aside from the privilege of coming in
contact with some of the big men in
the Christian Leadership movement,
a good time is assured everyone.
