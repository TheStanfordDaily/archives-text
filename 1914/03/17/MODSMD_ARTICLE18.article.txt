# FRESHMEN GET MOST RUNS BUT 1916 GETS ONLY BALL
## 1917 Scores Seven to Six Victory Over Second Year Opponents in Interclass Game. 
### 
Freshmen and Sophomores divided
honors in the baseball game and fight
for possession of the sphere yesterday
afternoon. Nineteen Seventeen gath
ered in one more run than the sec
ond-year opponents in the annual in
terclass match. A. B. Aten, of the
Sophomore army, beat a quiet retreat
with the coveted horsehide tucked
away safely in his pocket.
The result of the game was in doubt
until Umpire McCloskey broke up the
contest in the middle of the fifth by
throwing the "little white thing" into
the air, giving the Freshmen a 7 to G
victory. And then the real match was
on.
Mattei, pitching for the Freshmen,
allowed his opponents but three hits,
while his teammates got five off Smith,
Young and O'Neil, the three Sopho
more twirlers.
