# ELECTRIC LINE MAY JOIN PALO ALTO AND THE CITY
## 
### 
Stanford students may soon be able
to reaeh San Francisco by an electric
line. Fred A. Stokes, a promoter, of
San Francisco, announced yesterday
that if the San Mateo County Develop
ment Board can procure a right of
way between San Mateo and Palo Alto
an electric extension will be made
from San Mateo. Stokes claims to
have the necessary capital in hand
for the work. It is also stated that
the millionaire landowners at San
Mateo will donate most of the right of
way. Stokes declared that the new
lines will force a material reduction
in passenger rates by the Southern
Pacific for all Peninsula commuters.
