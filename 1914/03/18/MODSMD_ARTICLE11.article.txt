# SPRING POEMS AND OTHER TROUBLES
## 
### 
As the warm weather conies, bringing mosquitoes and poems on
Spring in its trail, another little annoyance becomes the subject of vo
ciferous comment. The average college student loves a little learning,
and for fifty minutes will absorb knowledge like a sponge. At the end
of this time he suddenly and invariably reaches his point of saturation,
and instead of a docile sponge becomes a very peevish young person
longing for his lunch, or his smoke, or his ten minutes in the fresh air.
We do not pretend to defend on logical grounds the horror felt by the
average student at being held over the hour in a classroom. We merely
state it as a fact and ask the members of the faculty to accept it as a
fact. This in the interests of harmony. All progress based on coopera
tion between two elements must come by means of mutual concessions.
If the instructor will refrain from beginning on a new topic or greatly
expanding an old one after the bell lias rung, the students will so ap
preciate this attitude toward them that they will gladly permit him to
bring his immediate thought to a decent conclusion, and will come to his
class day by day with pleasanter anticipation and greater readiness for
work. The evil of holding classes over is not serious, though from
reports it seems to be a growing one. Yet it is one of those little things
the ultimate results of which are out of all proportion to their size.
