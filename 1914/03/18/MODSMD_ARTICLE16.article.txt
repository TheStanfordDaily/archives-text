# RACKET WIELDERS PLAY LOWELL TEAM SATURDAY
## 
### 
Stanford tennis players will meet
the Lowell high school quartet from
San Francisco Saturday. The matches
are scheduled as practice contests for
the tournament with California next
month. By playing outside teams of
recognized ability it is thought that
the Varsity candidates will play sub
ject to conditions nearly similar to
those under which they meet Califor
nia, and that the racket wiclders will
gain the experience that comes only
from tournament competition.
Lowell will send four young play
ers who have already won coastwise
fame for their tennis ability. Henry
Johns, Roland Roberts, Fred Prich
ard and Leon Strauss compose the
strongest high school team in the
state. Albert Bull, winner of last

I year's Stanford interscholastic singles
championship, is just recovering from
an illness, or he would be numbered
among the visiting players.
H. L. Hahn, *16. will meet Johns,
while .T. S. Hutchinson, '16, will prob
lably be matched against Roberts.
Captain L. Sloss, '15, will play Prich
ard, and K. H. Uhls, 'l(i, is pitted
| against Strauss. In the doubles
j Johns and Roberts will be opposed by
j Hahn and Sloss, and Prichard and
j Strauss will face Hutchinson and
! Uhls.
In the round robin tournament in
which the places of the Varsity men
are to be decided, Captain Sloss de
feated Phis. 6-4, yesterday after
noon. The match scheduled between
;F. S. Pratt, '13, and S. Chapman, '16,
to select the fifth man eligible to en
ter the round robin will be contested
this afternoon instead of yesterday as
was first announced.
