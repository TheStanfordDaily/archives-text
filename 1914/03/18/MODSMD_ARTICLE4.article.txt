### 
I Dance numbers in "The College
| Prince" will include airy-footed steps
j from many strange nooks of the four
! points of the compass. The terpsi
' chorean antics of the Japanese, Nnid
rofstanese, Marsovian, and Andaleu
tian festivals have been collected, and
are being carefully practiced.
The opening and closing choruses
of both acts of the 1915 opera repre
sent the best achievement of the com-

posers and lyric writers. They are
being put on at rehearsals with an
artistic flourish which makes sport of
the intricate mazes of the dances.
Sale of tickets for the 1915 Junior
Opera, "The College Prince," will be
held tomorrow afternoon at the Hook
store, and at Weingartners' in Palo
Alto, at 1:10.
