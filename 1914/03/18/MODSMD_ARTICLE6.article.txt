# RAILROADS LOWER RATES FOR INTERSCHOLASTIC
## ENTRANTS WILL TRAVEL FOR A FARE AND A THIRD Larger Number of Athletes Will Come to Meet as Result of Special Concession. 
### 
Special reduced railroad rates have
' been obtained for the athletes attend
ing the Stanford interscholastic track
meet and tennis tournament on April
jlO and 11. Word lias been received
from the Southern Pacific Company
and the Atchison, Topeka and Santa
Fe Railway Company that they have
named from all staitons on their re
spective lines in California special
rates on the basis of one and one-third
fares on the receipt certificate plan.
It is important that the preparatory
school athletes and all others who at
tend the meet take a receipt when pur
chasing their tickets at the regular
one-way rate to Palo Alto, and have
the same signed by the interscholastic
secretary here, in order to obtain the
benefit of the one-third fare returning.
If the certificates are not obtained no
reduced rates can be allowed.
This special dispensation of the rail
roads in favor of the interscholastic
gathering makes it possible for many
athletes to attend who would other
| wise be barred on account of the
heavy expense. For this reason it is
probi.jle that many more school boys
will be the guests of the student body
this year than ever before.
Stopover privileges will tie allowed
on the going trip, provided the ath
letes and visitors to the campus ask
the ticket agent at the initial point, for
ticket allowing such privilege, and pay
the regular published stopover fare.
The tickets will be on sale for the
going trip from April 1 to 11, inclu
sive. and certificates will lie honored
for return April 11 to 16, inclusive.
