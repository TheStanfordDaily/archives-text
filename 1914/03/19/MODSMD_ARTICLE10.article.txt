The drawing for choice of scats for the Junior Opera was held this
afternoon. At an early stage of the game the available numbers and
the patience of the waiting line were both exhausted. I lie tickets were
exhausted before the patience, and many got not so much as a chance
to draw. Reports had it that men of a certain type, acting on the prin
ciple of "To him that hath shall be given," were remaining within the
Bookstore and sneaking into the line again and again, thus depriving
their less canny fellows of a fair chance to draw. Loath to believe this,
The Daily Palo Alto this afternoon inquired in various quarters, and
found the reports to be unanimously confirmed.
Many hoped and believed at the beginning of this year that external
conditions were now so favorable and the type of Stanford man so high
that a period of constructive progress was at hand. Cardinal athletic
teams and the systems of athletic coaching and training were to be
strengthened; dramatic, journalistic and musical activities were to be
brought to a yet higher plane; student executive and legislative bodies
were to be more effectively organized ; and such definite forward moves
as the revision of the Plug I gly and the adoption of an Honor System
were to be considered. But the students cannot ask for more power or
launch a progressive campaign if a considerable element among them is
of such a narrow-minded and selfish type as to steal other men s places
in the ticket line. Fortunately this is not the case: but in the eyes of
outsiders such actions by a few blacken the name of the whole student
body. If the use of these tactics increases, our orderly ticket line will
become, not a line, but a mob, every man for himself. It you 're
peaters" in the ticket line do your repeating to be funny, Heaven
send you a sense of humor; if you do it from thoughtlessness, have a
thought!
