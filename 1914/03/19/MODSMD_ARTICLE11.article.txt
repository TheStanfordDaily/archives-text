### 
Plans for the Freshman jolly-up in
tlio Palo Alto Armory Friday evening
are practically completed. The Fresh
man orchestra, composed of W. A.
Lynn, T. E. Swigart and M. M.
Barnes, which played at the Sopho
more jolly-up last Friday, has been
secured.
Besides the regular robber dances
there will be a number of straight
dances. The committee has decided
to add a little variety by means of
several women's tag dances.
The transfer women are invited to
be present; and to make their own
jolly-up a success all Freshmen are
urged by the committee to attend.
