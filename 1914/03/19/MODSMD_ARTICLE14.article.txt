# WINGED “O” WILL BEING FAST TEAM TO STANFORD Many Former Cardinal Athletes Will Oppose Varsity on the Oval Saturday.
## 
### 
Stanford versus the Olympic Club
is the schedule for the cinder path on
Saturday afternoon. Each year the
track athletes of the University and
the Club men meet on the local oval
■ for one of the most interesting dual
j contests of the season. The reason
for this interest is that most of the
spectators personally know the men
who run under the colors of the
"Winged O," and who include many
I of the former Stanford track men.
The aggregation which the city club
will bring to the campus on Saturday
will include a fast list of contestants.
They will probably enter men in every
I event with the exception of the pole
(vault. Here are some of the runners
and held men who are likely to ap
j pear on the Stanford track in togs
on Saturday: Jack Nelson and Gisin
in the sprints; John O. Miller, '08, and
Meredith Cramer, '11, half mile; 01 i
|ver Millard and Bobby Vlught for the
mile and two-mile; Beeson in the hur
dles; Stoltz, '09, and Reed, broad
jump; G. L. Horine, ex-'l3, and Hee
son in the high jump. It is probable
that Karl Shattuck will lie on hand
