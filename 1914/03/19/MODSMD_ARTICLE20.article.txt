# SAM WILL SHOW STUDENTS THAT PIGS IS NOT PIGS ALTHOUGH PORK IS PORK
## 
### 
"Pigs is pigs," the books say, but
Sam McDonald, guardian of the Stan
ford athletic properties, has proved
that there is a distinction in brands
of pigs. Sam demonstrated the fact
that he is a connoisseur on the var
ious varieties of the pork producing
animal last evening. The darkness of
the night had nothing to do with the
case. Sam was commissioned by the
Quadrangle Club to select the porker
which is to be the motif for the an
nual greased pig festivity on March
28, when the Irish Marathon and
stunt carnival is staged. He jour
neyed to Portola last evening and
this is the result of his bargaining:
One pig, weight 85 pounds; ugly dis
position; razor-backed; fleet of foot,
and with a disinclination to be ca
ressed. Along with the pig Sam se
cured a guarantee that if the animal
is properly shaven and greased the
former owners will return the pur
chase price if the pig is captured by
any Stanford student. On the theory
that the spoils should go to the vic
tor the Quadrangle Club has decided
that it will do its share in reducing
the high cost of living by granting
the porker to its captor.
The greased pig chase is to be but
one of the many features which are
being arranged for the Junior week
celebration of Irish Marathon day.
Other novelties which are to be
staged will be announced later by
the committee in charge.
