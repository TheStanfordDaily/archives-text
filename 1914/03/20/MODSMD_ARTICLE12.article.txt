# DELTA SIGMA RHO ACTS UNDER CHANGED POLICY
## Elects Close, Kaufman and Hettinger, Three Tri-State Debaters, to Membership 
### 
Delta Sigma Rho, honorary debating
fraternity, made a decided change of
policy in the election of members at
a recent meeting. A plan to admit
tri-state speakers into the organiza
tion was passed. In view of the fact
three new members were voted into
the society. These are C. C. Close, '14,
J. W. Kaufman, 'lfi, and A. J. Hettin
ger, '16. Each of these students has
represented Stanford on a tri-state
team and placed on his class team in
the Sophomore-Freshman debate.
Heretofore it has been the policy of
Delta Sigma Rho to include in its
membership only debaters who have
upheld Stanford against California in
the intercollegiate contest. Now it is
the plan of the national forensic so
ciety to extend the field to those who
debated in the tri-state contest. The
purpose is to bolster up this tri-cor
nered debate and to reward the
speakers for their efforts.
