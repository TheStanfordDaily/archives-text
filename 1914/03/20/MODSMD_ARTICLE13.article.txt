# BROKEN MOSAICS USED FOR PRACTICAL PURPOSES
## 
### 
Rare Venetian mosaics, which for
merly contributed to the artistic beau
ty of the Stanford Memorial Chapel,
are now being used to fill in mud
holes and build roads on the cam
pus. At one time works of art, these
mosaics have lain in heaps since the
destruction of the old chapel several
years ago. They are now mingled
with the stones used in the roadbeds,
in order that they may be put to prac
tical use. In the meantime, Signor
Zampato of Venice is replacing them
in the Chapel with all the art which he
revealed in his first work.
