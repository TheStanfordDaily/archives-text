# No Anonymous Communications

### 
Several anonymous communications
for publication have been received at
this office. The rule in regard to com
munications has frequently been
stated, and is that the name of the
writer of such letters must be made
known to the Editor of the Daily
Palo Alto, although a fictitious signa
ture may be used for printing.
