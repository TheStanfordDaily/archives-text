# ENTRY LISTS ARE OPENED FOR JUNIOR DAY SPORTS
## Spectacular Swimming, Canoeing, and Tilting Feats Will Entertain Audience at Lake Lagunita. 
### 
Entry lists are now open for the
Junior Day sports, which will be held
at Lake Lagunita on Friday morning,
March 27. A very extensive program
of aquatic events is being prepared by
the Junior Week committee, and in
cludes an interesting list of swimming
and canoeing contests.
Such a celebration will be of partic
ular interest to the present Sophomore
and Freshman classes, as none of the
underclassmen have previously had an
opportunity to witness the sports at
the lake while in college, owing to the
lack of water in Lagunita. Crack
swimmers will start the program in a
fast 50-yard dash. Following this will
come the exciting class relay race.
Each class will enter a team of six
of its best swimmers, who will choose
their own captain for the day. Each
man will probably swim fifty yards.
A lively race in canoes is scheduled
to follow. Tilting contests will fur
nish the most unique attraction of the
morning. Each canoe will contain a
crew of two veteran paddlers, while
the third member of the boat company
will hazard his skill against the op
posing craft. The contestants are pro
vided with long poles, padded at the
ends, and as the two canoes make for
each other at full speed, threatening
a head-on collision, the two men,
standing upright in the boat, endeavor
to dislodge each other with swift
strokes of their poles. Surprise fea
tures calculated to add a spicy enjoy
ment to the regular program will be
interspersed with the main events.
Valuable prizes have been offered for
winners of first, second and third
place honors in the scheduled events
and a complete list of these trophies
will be published in the Daily Palo
Alto on Monday. The prizes will be
on exhibition in Palo Alto during the
early part of next week.
Any who may wish to enter the ca
noeing and tilting contests should hand
their names immediately to L. F. Dent
and D. I. Seymour. Those who make
the first applications will receive the
choice of canoes, and as the supply is
limited, quick response is desirable.
Swimming entries must be handed to
A. L. Erb, M. D. Barton or S. S. Si
monsou.
Tickets for the Junior Prom have
been placed on sale at the Bookstore.
The number of tickets has been re
stricted to 125 and the usual charge of
$5 per couple is being made.
