# J.A. CODE WILL REFEREE INTERSCHOLASTIC TENNIS
## LOVING CUPS TO BE AWARDED SUCCESSFUL CONTESTANTS Ten Courts Have Been Secured to Accommodate Large Number of Racket Wielders. 
### 
James A. Code, father of lawn ten
nis on the Pacific Coast, will referee
the Stanford interscholastic tennis
tournaments to be held on April 10
and 11. The securing of the services
of one of the most experienced tennis
authorities in this vicinity assures the
preparatory school athletes that the
matches will be conducted in the most
up to date and efficient manner.
There is to be an umpire for every
single match and linesmen for the
most important matches, while the
varsity tennis team will act as assist
ants to the referee.
Two silver loving cups to be award
ed to the winners of the doubles tour-i
nament have been donated to the in
terscholastic by Spalding & Co. of San
Francisco. The winner of the sin
gles tournament will also be award
ed a cup, although the donor has not
been announced as yet. In addition to
this the winners will also receive the
regulation gold watches and the run
ners up in both singles and doubles
will be awarded silver medals and the
semi-finalists, bronze medals.
Spaulding's special hard court ten
nis balls will be used in the matches.
This is the first time that they have
been selected for the intorscholastic
match and are especially adapted to
the asphalt courts, being made ex
pressly for use in California.
It is expected that ten courts will
be at the disposal of the committee
and this will assure the rapid running
off of the matches. With twice the
number of courts in use this year as
were available last April, and the
starting of the matches on Friday
morning instead of the afternoon, the
tournaments will be concluded before
the interscholastic track meet starts.
