Stanford track men will meet the
Olympic Club cinder path athletes in
the annual dual contest on the oval

The time has been changed from the
original hour of two in order that
more of the Winged "O" runners may
be on hand to compete when Danny
Carroll starts the men in the mile

will assure a more even division of
the spoils in regard to the number
of points accredited to each team in
the final count.

in togs tomorrow for the first time.
All of the men in training will be ex
pected to compete in the meet. It
will be impossible for all of them to

be run in order that all of the run
ners may have the experience of com
petition.
