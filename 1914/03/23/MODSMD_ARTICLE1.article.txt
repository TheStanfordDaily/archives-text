# ONLY THREE WEEKS LEFT FOR CREW PREPARATIONS
## VARSITY, PEANUT AND FRESHMEN EIGHTS WORK DAILY Three Men Are Fighting to Make Their Respective Positions in Several Cases. 
### 
Three crews, the Varsity, the Pea
nut, anil the Freshman, are practicing
daily at Redwood. Only three weeks
remain in which to prepare the Stan
ford eights for the most important
match of the year, and Coach F. L.
Guerena, '11, is devoting all of his
spare time to improving the stroke
of his men.
Yesterday's workout proved conclu
sively that Stanford possesses two
crews, either of which would be per
fectly able to meet California and
Washington on the day of the big
race. In the final sprint of the long
nine-mile grind, the Peanut shell, in
which not a former Varsity man was
rowing, forged steadily ahead of the
Varsity boat, and the first year craft
was well able to take care of itself
in the competition. All of the places
are greatly in doubt, and as many as
three candidates are still being con
sidered for a single position.
Besides the two coxswains, L. F.
Reinemann, '15, and J. H. Goodman,
'16, eleven men seem to be monopo
lizing the fight for Varsity honors.
These men are E. B. Wolford, '15, F.
O. Olmstead, '15, F. N. Worth, 'IG, I.
Hulsman, '15, Captain P. P. Clover,
'14, F. E. Rehm, '15, J. S. Jeffers, '15,
G. E. Haggart, '15, C. H. Orme, 'IG,
W. A. Green, '16, and G. A. Jacomini,
'15. it seems reasonably certain that
the final crew will be picked from
this list.
The Freshmen are putting a pow
erful drive behind their stroke, but
the time and the blade work are still
open to a great deal of improvement.
Only three first year coxswains re
main in the running, H. J. Cooper, L.
W. Waller, and H. TI. Skinner. Very
little difference is noticeable in their
work at the rudder, and final selec
tion will rest upon their ability to
"talk it up to the men." Twelve
Freshmen are contesting for the seats
in the baby shell—R. Maurer, F. P.
Andrews, A. H. McEiien, H. S. Pet
tingill, J. H. Russell, G. K. Scovel,
J. G. Day, G. A. Hammon, -T. S. Hig-
ley, L. C. Rogers, H. W. McNulty, and
E. C. Kester.
Berkeley "dopesters" are placing
implicit confidence in the much
touted Stephenson stroke, which is
very different from the one employed
by Coach Guerena. Both emphasize
a slow, even recovery, but Guerena's
method lacks the sharp, jerky finish
of the Berkeley stroke, which reminds
one of the system used several years
ago by Dan Murphy, a former Stan
ford coach.

little difference is noticeable in their
work at the rudder, and final selec
tion will rest upon their ability to
"talk it up to the men." Twelve
Freshmen are contesting for the seats
in the baby shell—R. Maurer, F. P.
Andrews, A. H. McEiien, H. S. Pet
tingill, J. H. Russell, G. K. Scovel,
J. G. Day, G. A. Hammon, -T. S. Hig-
ley, L. C. Rogers, H. W. McNulty, and
E. C. Kester.
Berkeley "dopesters" are placing
implicit confidence in the much
touted Stephenson stroke, which is
very different from the one employed
by Coach Guerena. Both emphasize
a slow, even recovery, but Guerena's
method lacks the sharp, jerky finish
of the Berkeley stroke, which reminds
one of the system used several years
ago by Dan Murphy, a former Stan
ford coach.
Three crews, the Varsity, the Pea
nut, anil the Freshman, are practicing
daily at Redwood. Only three weeks
remain in which to prepare the Stan
ford eights for the most important
match of the year, and Coach F. L.
Guerena, '11, is devoting all of his
spare time to improving the stroke
of his men.
Yesterday's workout proved conclu
sively that Stanford possesses two
crews, either of which would be per
fectly able to meet California and
Washington on the day of the big
race. In the final sprint of the long
nine-mile grind, the Peanut shell, in
which not a former Varsity man was
rowing, forged steadily ahead of the
Varsity boat, and the first year craft
was well able to take care of itself
in the competition. All of the places
are greatly in doubt, and as many as
three candidates are still being con
sidered for a single position.
Besides the two coxswains, L. F.
Reinemann, '15, and J. H. Goodman,
'16, eleven men seem to be monopo
lizing the fight for Varsity honors.
These men are E. B. Wolford, '15, F.
O. Olmstead, '15, F. N. Worth, 'IG, I.
Hulsman, '15, Captain P. P. Clover,
'14, F. E. Rehm, '15, J. S. Jeffers, '15,
G. E. Haggart, '15, C. H. Orme, 'IG,
W. A. Green, '16, and G. A. Jacomini,
'15. it seems reasonably certain that
the final crew will be picked from
this list.
The Freshmen are putting a pow
erful drive behind their stroke, but
the time and the blade work are still
open to a great deal of improvement.
Only three first year coxswains re
main in the running, H. J. Cooper, L.
W. Waller, and H. TI. Skinner. Very
little difference is noticeable in their
work at the rudder, and final selec
tion will rest upon their ability to
"talk it up to the men." Twelve
