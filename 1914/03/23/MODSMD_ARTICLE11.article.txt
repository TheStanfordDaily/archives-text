# KILL THE UMPIRE!

### 
Here is one of the things that distinguishes a university from a
prep-school: Jn one's high school days the greatest work one can think
of to do for the institution is to "rattle the pitcher" of the opposing ball
team, and to call the attention of the world to the peculiarities and
physical shortcomings of the rival players. At Stanford we bleacher
ites have realized that the finest thing we can do for 'the name and fame
of the University is to cheer our own team and at the same time treat
'the visiting players as gentlemen should treat gentlemen. This is the
sort of thing that makes the Stanford campus a place where athletic
teams like to play.
The present semester has seen a tendency to depart from that fine
tradition whicih says that Stanford men are not to hoot nor harry, kid
nor kidnap opposing ballplayers. Such trilling attentions are not so bad
when aimed at members of our own student body. But when we fling
barbed witticisms at visiting players, howl whenever the umpire awards
them a close decision, and, as in Saturday's game, go to the crude ex
tremity of making sport of their religious beliefs, the time has come to
call a halt.
It is the inalienable right of the fan at professional baseball games
to crab at the umpire. It is not only a right, it is a duty and it is a
pleasure. The point is that Stanford is not a part of a professional
league. Tt is a university which has achieved an enviable reputation by
adherence to definite ideals One of these ideals is sportsmanlike treat
ment from the bleachers of visiting teams. May we perpetuate our
reputation by remembering our ideals!
