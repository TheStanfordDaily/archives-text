## Varsity Takes Both Doubles, But Wins Only One of Four Singles Matches. 
### 
Stanford and Lowell High School
broke even in the tennis tournament
on Saturday, each team winning
three matches. The Varsity players
captured both doubles contests, but
gained a victory in only one of the
four singles matches.
H. L. Hahn, '16, scored the one
singles victory for Stanford, defeat
ing H. Van Dyke Johns, Lowell's first
player, in straight sets. Johns
pressed Hahn in the first set, forcing
the match to 10-8 before acknowledg
ing defeat. Striking his gait in the
second set, Hahan won six out of
seven games, losing only the fifth.
In the other singles matches, Ro
land Roberts vanquished J. S. Hutch
inson, Captain L. Sloss, '15, lost to
Robert Kinsey, and T. Roberts de
feated I\. B. Uhls, '16.
The elder Roberts scored over
Hutchinson in straight sets, while
Captain Sloss and Uhls forced their
opponents to three-set matches.

closer, and developed tennis of a
higher class than the singles. In the
first doubles, Sloss and Hahn won
from Johns and Roberts, but only
after two deuce sets, in both of which
the Lowell pair were within a point
of taking the set. Thirty-four games
were necessary to decide the victor,
the final scores being 11-9, 8-6.
Three sets, two of which went to
deuce, were played before the second
doubles match was won by Hutchin
son and F. S. Pratt, '13. By playing
steady tennis they defeated their op
ponents, T. Roberts and Kinsey, 7-5,
5-7, 6-4.

Johns, 10-S, 6-1; R. Roberts defeated
