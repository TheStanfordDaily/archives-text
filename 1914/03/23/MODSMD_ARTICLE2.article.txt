### 
The Junior baseball team, which
won the interclass championship by
defeating the Freshmen 011 Friday,
were today granted class sweaters by
the class. Other business to be
transacted at the 1915 meeting was
the assessing each member of the
class fifty cents to defray the ex
penses of fireworks for Wednesday
evening, and the urging of all men
who can run, but think that they can
not, to try-out for the Junior Irish
Marathon team. The Junior Prom
will be held in Encina Hall this year,
and all the classmen have been asked
to report in the club room on Thurs
day afternoon and Friday to aid in
decorating.
