# ST. IGNATIUS SUCCUMBS TO VARSITY BATSMEN, 7-1
## MAPLE AND HALM HOLD VISITORS DOWN TO TWO HITS Four Pitchers for the Opposing Team Are Easy Marks for the Cardinal Hitters. 
### 
"Hit 'n run" was the Varsity slogan
in Saturday's game in which the Card
inals circled the liases seven times in
seven innings, while the visitors suc
ceeded in crossing the plate for one
lone tally.
Only a couple of hits were gleaned
by the opposing batsmen, one off Ma
ple during the first six innings, and a
second off Halm in the last frame,
while all "the boys" fattened their
averages at the expense of the four
twirlers presented by St. Ignatius.
The scoring began in the opening
inning when three hits netted two
runs. Again in the fourth frame an
other tally was chalked up as the re
sult of a pair of bingles. In the clos
ing periods four more liits added an
equal number of runs, bringing the
total up to seven runs and nine hits,
one of which was a three-bagger.
Halm was first to score. He made
first while Terry was being thrown
out at the keystone sack and reached
second on O'Neill's out at first base.
Dent's bingle brought the runner
home. Stafford followed with a safe
ty, putting Dent at third. Dent com
pleted the circuit on a single by Day.
In t'ae fourth frame McCloskey hit
and went to second on a passed ball.
Maple's single advanced the runner to
the third bag, and another hit by
Halm registered the player at home.
Terry's men held another hit-fest
in the last inning when the visitors
put Borland in the box. He started
off by allowing McCloskey to walk
to first. Maple sacrificed, and Terry,
Halm, O'Neill, and Dent hit out safe
ties in rapid succession, the net re
sult being to score McCloskey, Terry,
Halm, and O'Neill, and to retire Dor
land from the mound in favor of Pohl
man who succeeded in finishing the
half without allowing any more dam
age.
In their half of the seventh St. Tg
natius tried to "come back," and so
far succeeded as to get their only
score for the afternoon. V. Brown,
the first man up, hit out a safety. A
fielding error allowed him to make
second. He was then brought home
on the plays of Van Dyne and Burns.
The summary follows:
Three-base hit—O'Neill. Sacrifice
hit—Maple. Stolen bases—Terry,
Halm, Dent, Stafford. Double play—
McCloskey to O'Neill. Struck out —
By Maple 2, by Halm 2, by Hickey 4,
