# RECORDS SMASHED AND EQUALED IN DUAL MEET
## STANFORD TRACK TEAM DOWNS OLYMPICS 61-43 Lyn. Murray Runs 880 in 1:57:1.—F. A. Murray Negotiates High Sticks in :15:1. 
### 
One Pacific Association record bet
tered, one Stanford record equalled,
a victory for the Cardinal track team,
and several good performances sums
up the history of the dual meet with
the Olympic Club on Saturday. 11. L.
Murray, '13, gratified the cinder path
enthusiasts when he negotiated the
half-mile run in 1:57:1, establishing a
P. A. record in the state and better
ing the record held by Dowd of Cali
fornia of 1:58:1.
The Stanford record of 1:57:1 was
made by John O. Miller, 'OS, in a dual
track meet held at Berkeley against
the Olympic Club in 1909 when he
outdistanced Callendar of the Winged
"O" team. For some reason this
mark was never accredited on the
books of the Pacific Association, but
has stood as a Stanford mark in the
SBO. Murray's record will stand, pro
viding the official statement is accept
ed by the P. A. committee.
Along with the fact that Murray
broke the record in the half-mile
comes the news that he will be un
able to compete in the Intercollegiate
meet this year. According to the
agreement between Stanford and Cali
fornia an athlete may compete not
| more than four springs or four falls
in Intercollegiate sports, and in this
agreement is included the sport of
tennis. Murray has competed four
years as a racket wielder, and al
though Stanford does not rank ten
| nis as a major sport, the ruling holds
in his case.
Running the low hurdles in : 15:1,
F. S. Murray, '16, equalled the Stan
ford record for the high timber-top
ping event held by 11. .T. Whitted, ex
'l6. He also scored another five
points when he cleared the low sticks
in :25:2.
Stanford won the meet by the wide
margin of fil points to 43 points
scored by the visitors. The Olympic
Club did not have any entries in the
hammer throw and shot put, and for
this reason it was agreed upon before
the meet that the points in these
events would not count in the total
score. The Cardinal runners took
seven first places as against five firsts
totaled by the Winged "O" athletes.
George L. Horine, ex-'l3, showed
that he has not lost any of his old
time form in the high jump when he
cleared the bar at 6 feet 4 5-8 inches.
His former rival, Eddie Beeson, jump
ing as his teammate, cleared the same
mark, and then the two jumpers de
cided to call it quits.
In the shot put G. Bedeau, '15,
heaved the shot to a new mark for
the season with a distance of 44 feet
3 1-2 inches. In several of the events
two heats were run, the second heat
including only novice Stanford run
ners.
