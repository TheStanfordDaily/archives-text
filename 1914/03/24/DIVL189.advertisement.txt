yfflllpy A REAL timber-topper this Vel
vet! It has hung from the
m^ers ie warehouse for ovef
two years. This is to get rid o(
the leaf harshness —only time and
paticncc can annihilate the "bite" in to
' bacco. Velvet is perfect mellowness —
a fl avor delightfully good — superbly
smooth. It's only by comparison that
Velvet is the smoothest.
