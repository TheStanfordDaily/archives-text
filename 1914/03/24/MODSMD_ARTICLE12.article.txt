111 the course of his wonderfully instructive and inspiring address,
in itself no mean item in a liberal education, Norman Angell this morn
ing" dropped by the wayside a thought over which we may ponder a bit.
Stanford, he said, has taken the lead in offering practical courses which
give that knowledge of world affairs upon which alone national and
international progress can be based.
True enough, 110 doubt, and gratifying; but if the average man
of a college other than Stanford has as little real grasp of momentous
political concerns of the present day as the average Stanford man, may
God pity him and reform his college! We know that there is a "situa
tion" in Mexico; but who among us can analyze that situation in even
the most superficial manner? We are for or against President Wilson;
but how many of us base our attitude upon any source of knowledge
more fundamental than an occasional headline or cartoon? Which of
11s does not dread to go home and attempt to talk current events with
his father or non-collegiate friends? "Aha!" says Mr. Foureyes, "You
say you are deficient in such matters because your college pursuits do
not leave you time to inform yourselves on them; but if you really are
as anxious to learn as you pretend to be, you will make time for them
by cutting out your silly games and meets." Thank you, Mr. Four
eyes ; but we love our games and meets, and do not want to grow old
before our time; neither do we want to lengthen our already over
crowded day by rising ere light to read The Independent and The
Literary Digest.
May we suggest another practical course, to be offered perhaps by
the History department and to be called, say, Current History? Let
important current events be studied and analyzed by means of definite
facts of history, economics and political science. Thus the course would
constitute a vivid review and practical application of all these subjects.
The Mexican trouble and Canal tolls controversy, for example, would
be studied against a background of English, American, French and
Spanish history, and in the light of principles such as the Monroe Doc
trine. We do not ask for a "pipe": the course would be popular
enough if it were hard..
