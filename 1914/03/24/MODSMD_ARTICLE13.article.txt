(Hi! Consistency; Thou Art ;i Jewel!
Editor of The Daily Palo Alto:
Dear Sir: â€”Parity, like other things,
may become a base thins. The
soul of man is so constructed that he
seeks the proverbial peek of dirt. Too
much purity grates upon the soul and
he who walks the very straight and j
particularly narrow path is either in- I
tsnsely uninteresting or else abhor- j
rently hypocritical. The pleasant,
genial fellow "smokes his pipe
and takes his pot" and the world wags
the more merrily for his presence.
.Just, so with a college community.
The heaven-on-earth type of univer
sity smacks too much of smug self
satisfaction and greasy hypocrisy. A
certain feeling of suspicion assails the j
normal human being as he gazos upon j
such an abnormal condition of affairs, j
Now we are in danger of losing our
Plug Ugly. We have abjured the shud
dering tango and lost nothing. The
Plug Ugly, however, is a different
proposition.
To begin with, there are three things
which go to make up the feast, of the
Ugly Plug. The poster pasting, the .
show and the rush. The advantages of
the last two are negligible. The first, ,
however, is of great importance. Dur-

ing the stilly night Seniors and Jun-
J iors meet in many interesting melees,
i New friendships arc cemented, old
j ones are tested, class spirit is
; strengthened, do-you-remember-whens
lof the most absorbing character are
made for future reference. That good,
j whole-hearted, spirited, hail-fellow-
I well-met spirit of camaraderie is in
stilled into the hearts and souls of
I the participants.
And what are the objections? These:
The poster may be forced and unhu
morous, it may even descend to man's
lowest sense of wit in order to cause
pseudo-mirth (disgust). Well and
good. If the poster is expurgated by
a conscientious committee in suitable
time, not the night before the rush,
the objectionable features can be cut
i out and humor substituted.
Stanford seems to be the home -if
I the good poster, imitation being the
sincerest flattery. Why not let it stay
so?
The second objection is that some
'slight, amount of booze is consumed,
j Shocking! The amount consumed is
negligible.
The third is that some of the bi
valves on the row are awakened from
time to time during this one night in
! the year. It seems a very slight con
sideration to weigh against so bene

ficial an institution as the poster
pasting night.
Let freedom rule! Where the reins
of government are held too tightly,
there will be either rebellion or jelly
like. hypocritical submission. Let us
concentrate on the poster night to
carry the feast of the Ugly Plug. Give
us our grain of dirt. "Die Luft der
Freiheit weht." T. H. C.
