# FIRST STEPS TAKEN FOR BETTER FIRE CONDITIONS
## New Whistle System and Quicker Communication Facilities Will Be Installed Soon. 
### 
The first step toward the improve
ment of fire conditions on the Stan
ford campus has been taken by Su
perintendent J. E. Hewston. A new
system of fire whistles has been com
piled. Hereafter in case of fire a di
rect wire to the University power
house may be secured simply by re
questing the telephone operator for
the desired connection. Both the
name of the house and the number
indicated on ttie newly compiled fire
card should be given, in order to indi
cate the exact location of the fire.
Cards, explaining the newly ar
ranged list of fire whistle numbers
and stations, will be distributed on
Wednesday. They should be posted
at every telephone on the campus. The
