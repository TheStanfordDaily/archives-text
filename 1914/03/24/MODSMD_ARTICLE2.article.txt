# HOLDOVERS PLAN SURPRISE FOR IRISH MARATHON RACE
## 
### 
Next Saturday morning promises *o
be a gala time, when the runners of
the four respective classes will strive
against each other in the annual Mar
athon race. The Stanford holdovers
this year also have something star
tling in wait for the bleacherites.
Under the direction of their wily
chiefs, Les Summerfield, M. L. Ward
and C. T. Keefer, some side-spitting
and hair-raising stunts are being
planned. There remains, however, a
strange mystery and secrecy envel
oped about, their intended schemes. At
any rate this year's holdover "per
formance promises to be the very best
ever enacted on the Stanford oval.
Sam McDonald wishes that it be
announced that a newly-shaven, fat
and ferocious pig is now rather
anxiously awaiting his race for life,
along with a number of starved and
lively chickens.
All four classes still desire further
entries in the Marathon race teams.
The Juniors especially have called
for more entrants, since they are the
hosts of Junior week, and desire to
make an excellent exhibition.
