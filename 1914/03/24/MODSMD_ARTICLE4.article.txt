# VARSITY EIGHT WILL MEET SOUTH END ROWING CLUB
## Experienced Oarsmen of Bay Cities Will Furnish Lively Competition For Stanford Shell. 
### 
Stanford oarsmen will meet a shell
' representing the South End Rowing
Club Saturday, April 4, over the Oak
land Estuary course. Many of the
best oarsmen around the bay are en
-1 rolled in this organization and the
| Varsity crew men will be obliged to
extend themselves to capture first
j honors in the race.
This is the first season that mem
jbers of the South End Club have prac
ticed in shells, previous training hav
' ing been limited to barge work, but
I
this year the crews make three or
i
four trips weekly across the bay in
order to get in trim for the matches
with California and Stanford.
California has manifested a friendly
spirit by loaning the Stanford eight
one of the Blue and Gold shells for
the occasion. The expense of shipping
a Stanford shell from Redwood to
Oakland and back would make it diffi
cult to hold the meet, and besides all
of the three boats at the estuary must
of necessity be kept there for daily
practice.
A California crew will oppose the
South End Rowing Club on March 2S.
The outcome of this contest and the
result of that a week later will give
dopesters a good opportunity to com
pare the strength and weaknesses of
the two rival eights.
