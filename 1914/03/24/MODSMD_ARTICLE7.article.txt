# GENIAL CHAPPIE DRESSED IN GAY JUNIOR WEEK GARB
## Special Number Will Appear Tomorrow in an Entirely New and Appropriate Garb. 
### 
The Junior Week number of "Chap
pie," up-to-date and appropriately
'garbed in an entirely new suit, will
I
appear on the Quad tomorrow morn
| ing. This is the biggest number of
| the ye;\r and the largest Junior Week
issue ever put out here on the Farm,
| consisting of eighteen pages of live
"dope," verse, prose and special
features, profusely illustrated with
.clever cuts. The usual cover gives
way this time to one peculiarly in
keeping with the spirit of the issue.
Both the initial full-page cuts are
from the pen of M. A. Oliver, '15, the
first being in pen and ink and entitled
"Grand Stand Play," taken from a
novel viewpoint, and the second, "An
j Invitation of Junior Week," a study
in wash of a girl whom the veriest
rough on the campus would be will
ing to pawn his belongings to queen,
j This is the best piece of half-tone
! work that has been done by a student
since Virge Bellows, '09, was in col
-1 lege, and Chappie expects to feature
' this work from now on.
F. S. Murray, '16, is responsible for
a double page cut titled "The
Junior's Bay," which gives a bird's
eye view of the Lake during the holi
day stunts.
j The front-page poem, "Meditations,"
is by G. A. Hughes, '10, and tells a
ragtime romance in a charming bit
of verse.
The Bilettante, by M. A. Hagen, '15,
is an account of the sordid reason
for the hero's queening, and tells
how he was exposed by his own care
lessness.
A double page of verse, appropriate
ly illustrated, is another feature of
the issue. "The Apotheosis of Sunny
McVeigh" is the title, and it relates
of how one rough-neck was respon
sible for the origination of the Jolly-
Up at Stanford.
"Now That's" deal with Junior
jWeek and its incidents; boost the
opera; give a word to the bleachers
concerning the first intercollegiate
baseball game; and comment upon
the spring vacation.
Other contributions are from F. E.
