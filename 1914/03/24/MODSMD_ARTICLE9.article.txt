# FIGHT AGAINST WARFARE ADVOCATED AT ASSEMBLY
## NORMAN ANGELL MAKES POWERFUL PLEA FOR PEACE Renowned Figure in Arbitration Crusade Decries Bloodshed as Poor Business Method. 
### 
Norman Angell advocated world
I peace in the Assembly Hall this
| morning, in one of the most compell
ing addresses which have been heard
by present generations at Stanford.
With his knowledge as a dominant
figure in the attack against war as
an economic and social drain, lie
urged a great World State which
would supplant gunpowder as a
j means of national protection.
The logical place for the capital of
such an international government he
declared to be the United States,
"which is about to make of the Pa
cific what the Mediterranean was in
the heyday of Greece and Rome."
Limits of time prevented Mr. Angell
from proposing the actual working
machinery of such a universal gov
ernment. His remarks were directed
to show his audience that war is not
good "dollar business," and handi
caps the engaging peoples socially
and economically.
The financial development of our
I country was said to depend on Euro
pean capital, and the price at which
this can be obtained to be governed
by the amount of "free capital" in
the old world. More than half of
1 European capital is wasted. The
source of financial embarassment is
war. Quoting Mr. Angell directly for
a moment: "A European banker as
sured me that except for the war sys
-1 leni the price of capital throughout
the world would be cut in half."
With regard to a cooperative inter
national government, the speaker
stated that beginnings have already
| been made, as witnessed to by the
'postal alliance, and various marine,
commercial, manufacturing, and other
j congresses.
The potence of war in promoting
welfare was described as a "vast mis
conception." Illustrations to show
that armed conflict saps the strength
of nations and is ineffective included
the Boer war.
"Public opinion," said Mr. Angell,
"is the only force which can give us
security in political and social rela
tions. The complex machinery of a
World State cannot be operated until
its members have gained knowledge
of economics, history, and interna
tional law."
The possibility of Japan "dropping"
a conquering force in California was
discredited with humorous skill.
In conclusion, clamors for Ameri
can intervention in Mexico were de
plored.
