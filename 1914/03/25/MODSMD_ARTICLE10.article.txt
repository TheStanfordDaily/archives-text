### 
The Cardinal players who will meet
California in the intercollegiate ten
nis tournament on April 3 and 4 were
announced last evening by the coach
ing committee. The first doubles
team will be composed of Captain L.
Sloss, '15, and H. L. Halin, '16, while
F. S. Pratt, '13, and J. S. Hutchinson,
'16, form the second doubles duo. In
the singles Halin, Sloss, and K. 13.
Uhls, '16, will represent the Univer
sity.
Having defeated the winners of all
live tryout tournaments in the round
robin, llahn will play first singles.
He will probably be pitted against
Willis Davis, California's crack racket
wielder. Hahn was a substitute on
last year's team, and filled the place
of V. L. Sheldon, '15, who sprained
his wrist just previous to the tourna
ment.
in the past season the Sophomore
has shown a greater development
than any other player in college, per
fecting his game until he stands first
among the Cardinal men eligible to
participate in the intercollegiate con
test.

(Jhls, the second singles player, will
enter his lirst intercollegiate game
this year. He is a consistent if not a
brilliant player. In third singles
Stanford nas another votcrar.
tain Sloss, who was a member of the
second doubles team last spring.
While he has not displayed his best
form thus far this season, the nine
days' practice remaining before the
opening of the tournament will give
him an opportunity to perfect his
play.
Working together in the doubles
Sloss and Haiin rank higher than they
do in singles. They will probably
face "Vic" Breeden and Breck across
the net.
The second doubles team will be
steadied by the presence of Pratt,: a
veteran of the 1911 intercollegiate
tournament. Pratt, although not a
strong singles player, makes a hard
man to beat in the doubles. Hutchin
son, entered for the first time against
California, is a brilliant player, but
is inclined to be erratic at times.
The second doubles duo will in all
probability meet Davis and Lipman,
while Breck and Lipman will repre
sent California in the second and
third singles. With the exception of
Breck, who takes Rogers' place, the
Blue and Gold quartet is the same
that faced the Cardinal racket wield
ers last year, and is one of the most
formidable teams that California has
placed on the courts since the days
of the Long brothers.
The tournament will be held at the
State University, on April 3 and 4.
The doubles will probably be played
on Friday afternoon and the singles
on Saturday morning.

Sloss and Haiin rank higher than they
do in singles. They will probably
face "Vic" Breeden and Breck across
the net.
The second doubles team will be
steadied by the presence of Pratt,: a
veteran of the 1911 intercollegiate
tournament. Pratt, although not a
strong singles player, makes a hard
man to beat in the doubles. Hutchin
son, entered for the first time against
California, is a brilliant player, but
is inclined to be erratic at times.
The second doubles duo will in all
probability meet Davis and Lipman,
while Breck and Lipman will repre
sent California in the second and
third singles. With the exception of
Breck, who takes Rogers' place, the
Blue and Gold quartet is the same
that faced the Cardinal racket wield
ers last year, and is one of the most
formidable teams that California has
placed on the courts since the days
of the Long brothers.

on Friday afternoon and the singles
on Saturday morning.
