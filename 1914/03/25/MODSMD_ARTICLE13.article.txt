With the near approach of the first of Stanford's two great annual
festive seasons, The Daily L'alo Alto hopes that everyone will enjoy the
best Junior Week of them all. Since Stanford men and women fortu
nately need 110 instruction in the fine art of enjoying themselves, and
since the Juniors have prepared a celebration which ought to make a
clam happy, and since we have a grand little ball team prepared to end
the week in a burst of glory, we are not going to offer any advice rela
tive to this period of pleasure. We cannot, however, refrain from urg
ing, in the interests of Stanford democracy, that the oft-repeated man
date, "No carriages and flowers at the Prom," be observed by one
and all.
