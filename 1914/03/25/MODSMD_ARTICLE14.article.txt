# Stanford's Most Notable Athletes
## KENNY DOLE, â€™11. 
### 
Stanford has had six Dole brothers
prominently identified with athletics.
There was Charlie Dole, '98, track
captain in 1897, halfback, pole-vaulter,
jumper, hurdler, sprinter, four-star
track man, and winner of 36 varsity
track points against California.
There was "Guiby" Dole, '01, who
graduated with '03 because he was a
volunteer soldier in the Philippiae
war. As a Freshman, though email,
he was put in as guard on the Fresh
man eleven necause ot ins pluck to
try to stop the mighty Guiberson of
California, who weighed 236 pounds
and was very tall. He completely dis
counted the giant.
There was Norman Dole, '03, high
jumper and pole-vaulter, whose de
veloped perfection of vaulting form
first took the world's record four
inches above twelve feet, and won a
Stanford field-day. He Scored a total
of 16 5-6 points at track.
There was "Savage" Dole, '05, var
sity crew captain in 1905, winner of
2 1-2 varsity points in field-days as a
relay runner, and varsity halfback.
There was George Dole, '07, half
back, who scored two points by kick
ing two goals in Stanford's last big
American game.
And yet there came a sixth Dole,
greater than any of these! When he
was yet a little boy, six or seven
years old, he gave such promise of
size and development that even then
his brother Charlie told me one day
that his kid brother Kenneth down
home in Riverside would be the great
est athlete of the whole family. And
at that time there had already been
two older brothers varsity crew and
track men at Cornell, where the
youngest brother of the family is now
a varsity oarsman.
Kenneth L. Dole was captain of his
Freshman eight in 1907, and it won
by eighty yards. He was on the var
sity fifteen four years and captained

it in 1910, and he was one of Stan
ford's three greatest Rugby forwards.
He was a stalwart on the varsity
crew three years. And he took sec
ond place in the shot-put in a field
day. Altogether he won eight varsity
"S's," second only to Chet Murphy's
nine. Physically, he was tall and big,
an idealized type of what artists con
ceive the ancient Saxon warrior
looked like; and he was quiet, like
able, and in athletics, like all the
Doles, most reliable in the pinches..
The five varsity Doles combined
scored 60 1-3 points for Stanford. All
of them were members of Beta Theta
Pi.
The second greatest Stanford family
of athletic brothers were the three
Lanagans from Denver: "Jimmy," '00,
varsity pitcher, who made 2 runs;
Harry, '05, pole-vaulter, who scored
16 track points; and Fred, '08, var
sity track captain, hurdler, and scorer
of 6 1-3 track points. The family total
was 24 1-3 points.

Lanagans from Denver: "Jimmy," '00,
varsity pitcher, who made 2 runs;
Harry, '05, pole-vaulter, who scored
16 track points; and Fred, '08, var
sity track captain, hurdler, and scorer
of 6 1-3 track points. The family total
was 24 1-3 points.
ARCHIE RICE, '95.
Stanford has had six Dole brothers
prominently identified with athletics.
There was Charlie Dole, '98, track
captain in 1897, halfback, pole-vaulter,
jumper, hurdler, sprinter, four-star
track man, and winner of 36 varsity
track points against California.
There was "Guiby" Dole, '01, who
graduated with '03 because he was a
volunteer soldier in the Philippiae
war. As a Freshman, though email,
he was put in as guard on the Fresh
man eleven necause ot ins pluck to
try to stop the mighty Guiberson of
California, who weighed 236 pounds
and was very tall. He completely dis
counted the giant.
There was Norman Dole, '03, high
jumper and pole-vaulter, whose de
veloped perfection of vaulting form
first took the world's record four
inches above twelve feet, and won a
Stanford field-day. He Scored a total
of 16 5-6 points at track.
There was "Savage" Dole, '05, var
sity crew captain in 1905, winner of
2 1-2 varsity points in field-days as a
relay runner, and varsity halfback.
There was George Dole, '07, half
back, who scored two points by kick
ing two goals in Stanford's last big
American game.
And yet there came a sixth Dole,
greater than any of these! When he
was yet a little boy, six or seven
years old, he gave such promise of
size and development that even then
his brother Charlie told me one day
that his kid brother Kenneth down
home in Riverside would be the great
est athlete of the whole family. And
at that time there had already been
two older brothers varsity crew and
track men at Cornell, where the
youngest brother of the family is now
a varsity oarsman.
Kenneth L. Dole was captain of his
Freshman eight in 1907, and it won
by eighty yards. He was on the var
sity fifteen four years and captained

it in 1910, and he was one of Stan
ford's three greatest Rugby forwards.
He was a stalwart on the varsity
crew three years. And he took sec
ond place in the shot-put in a field
day. Altogether he won eight varsity
"S's," second only to Chet Murphy's
nine. Physically, he was tall and big,
an idealized type of what artists con
ceive the ancient Saxon warrior
looked like; and he was quiet, like
able, and in athletics, like all the
Doles, most reliable in the pinches..
The five varsity Doles combined
scored 60 1-3 points for Stanford. All
of them were members of Beta Theta
Pi.
The second greatest Stanford family
of athletic brothers were the three
Lanagans from Denver: "Jimmy," '00,
varsity pitcher, who made 2 runs;
Harry, '05, pole-vaulter, who scored
16 track points; and Fred, '08, var
sity track captain, hurdler, and scorer
