Still another event is to be recorded

mona College will compete against
the Stanford track team on Friday af
ternoon on the university oval. This
is the first dual meet between the two
institutions for several years. Last
season a combined team from Occi
dental and Pomona was defeated in
one of the interesting meets of the
season, while this spring Graduate
Manager R. W. Wilcox, '13, is bring
ing both colleges to the campus, but
lor separate meets.
Last Saturday Pomona defeated Oc
cidental in the annual dual meet be
tween the two southern rivals by the
slight margain of eleven points. The
score was GO to 55. The meet hinged on
the relay race, which was won by Po
mona, giving the Claremont College
athletes a double victory by wiuuihg
one event. Track dopesters will be
able to get a line on the probable re
sult in the Stanford-Occidental meet
from the final count in the Stanford-
Pomona meet.
The southerners will arrive on the
campus tomorrow morning on the
Lark, which will stop at Palo Alto,
bringing with them a well balanced
contingent of fifteen or sixteen men.
Gillette is the mainstay of the visit
ors in the sprints, negotiating the cen
tury in 10 seconds Hat and the 220-
yard dash in 23 seconds. With Gil
lette and G. Green, Pomona has two
men who can run the 440 in 51 sec
onds. The Claremont team has sev
eral distance men who will give the
Stanford athletes keen competition,
while in the 'hurdles they will rely on

will even things up in the high jump
and broad jump with a strong list of
entries.
The list of Stanford entries will not
be made known until tomorrow, de
