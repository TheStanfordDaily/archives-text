# OPERA REHEARSAL IS TUNEFUL REVEL
## 
### 
The last practice performance of
"The College Prince" last evening
promises a multi-colored success for
the tuneful songs, musical plot and
many other attractions which go to
make up the 1915 opera. The chorus-

ters and bright stars danced and sang
with jovial grace, and drew the last
bit of melodious charm from the crea
tion of Blumenthal and Hagen.
A strain of really and truly operatic
quality skips through the libretto and
songs. Everything goes with a gay
rush from the first ensemble onward.
A bewildering eeries cf dance steps.

pretty songs and sprightly dialogue
are in store for the audience tomorrow
evening.
Multi-colored costumes of iridescent
beauty have been provided. As a spec
tacle of vivid color "The College

Prince will reach the high mark in
Stanford productions.
The management will have books,
containing the musical hits of the op
era, on sale between acts and after
the performance.
A small number of seats are still
left at Weingartner's in Palo Alto and
at the bookstore.
