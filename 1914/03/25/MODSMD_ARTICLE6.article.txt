# DELEGATES TO PACIFIC GROVE LEAVE SATURDAY
## Stanford Will Be Well Represented at Y.M.C.A. Student Convention Next Week. 
### 
Some nineteen Stanford men will
leave the campus Saturday, bound for
the Pacific Grove student convention,
which is to be held next week at Asil
omar Beach. There are many students
who are considering taking the trip,
but are as yet undecided and it is
hoped that the delegation will finally
number thirty members. They will
leave Palo Alto for San Jose on the
2:27 train, where they will take the
Del Monte express for their destina
tion.
The serious purpose of the conven
tion is to enlist and train men in the
work of Christian leadership. Among
the leaders in this work are Hugh Mo
ran, a graduate of Stanford and the
first Rhodes scholar from California;
Arthur Arlet, a business man and so
cial worker from Oakland; Bishop Ed
win H. Hughes, of San Francisco, and
E. H. Lockwood, secretary of the local
Y. M. C. A. There are many other
capable and interesting leaders with
whom it will be the privilege of the
delegates to associate daily, and it
expected that much will be accom
plished for the cause of Christian lead
ership.
