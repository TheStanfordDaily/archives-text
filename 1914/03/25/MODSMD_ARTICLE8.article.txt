Arrangements have been made by
the Glee Club to secure for Stanford
a concert by the great violoncellist,
Frederick Preston Search, accompa
nied by Robert Raymond Lippitt, emi
nent concert pianist, on April 15.
Professor Search is regarded by
European and American critics as one
of the greatest artists to have mas
tered the cello. He is an honorary
graduate of the Leipzig Conservatory;
also a post-graduate of that school by
first mention. He has played under
the leadership of the great conductor
Arthur Nikisch, and associated with
such great masters as Klengel, Re

Rogovoy.
The various musical organizations
of the Peninsula have greeted the ef

To bring such a great artist to
Stanford is an undertaking involving
considerable expense and tbe Glee
Club will circulate a subscription li3t
