# IMMIGRATION OFFICERS ARREST HINDU SAVANT
## 
### 
Har Dyal, formerly a lecturer on
Hindu philosophy at Stanford, was
arrested last night by United States
immigration authorities in San Fran
cisco, and is facing charges of incit
ing sedition against British rule in
India. Har Dyal is one of many edu
cated Brahmans in America who are
suspected of urging a Hindu revolt
against all Europeans which would
repeat, the massacres of the Sepoy
mutiny.
