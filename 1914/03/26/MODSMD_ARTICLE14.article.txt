# FROLICSOME FUZZ IS FORCIBLY FAKED FOR FASTIDIOUS FRIENDS
## BULLETIN

The live defendants charged with
unsolicited tonsoriul services by .1. ('.
Ray, '07, were arraigned before .lus
lice S. W. Charles at 8:80 in Palo
Alto. Counsel for tin* defense failed
to appear, and the case was set for
ward to Tuesday, April 7, at 8 o'clock,
for preliminary hearing.
Five "college cutups" in the depart
ment of Geology and Mining decided
impulsively yesterday afternoon to be
come professional barbers. Armed
with a razor that would have done
credit to a real tonsorial artist, the
big "shavers" forced their services
upon a fellow student whose strug
gling beard had long displeased their
aesthetic senses. (Even G. and M.
majors often have a sensitive appre
ciation of the beautiful.)
In spite of the protestations of their
victim and his insistent refusal to dis
pose of the ill-fated crop of "spinach"
himself, the beauty-loving quintet
wheedled him into a classroom, where
four held his hands and feet while the
accomplished fifth whacked away half
of the stubborn bristles. Impressed
with (he difficulties which are liable to
beset impromptu barbers, they decided
that half a "trimming" was better
then none at all, and soon freed their
demi-bearded classmate.
The latter, anxious to complete the
job, hastened to Palo Alto, where he
hunted up Chief of Police Noble and
charged the ambitious five with bat
tery. The defendants were released on
the payment of a $100 bond, which
must have taxed them sorely, as it is
understood that they received abso
lutely no tip from their first customer
The prosecutor is J. C. Ray, '07, of
Palo Alto, who has been continuing his
studies on the campus recently. Tha
defendants are H. Stone, gr., W. G.
Cooper, '13, H. B. Hannibal, gr., E. B,
Hall, '14, and J. B. Hunley, '14. The
arraignment has been set for this af
ternoon at 3:30 o'clock in the court of
Justice Charles in Palo Alto.
Friends of the unlucky quintet state
that they are singing the popular re
frain, "I should worry like a tree and
have somebody 'trimming' me," with
hitherto unheard of enthusiasm.
