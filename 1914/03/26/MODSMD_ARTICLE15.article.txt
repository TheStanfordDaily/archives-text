# MARATHON MEN WILL SHOW SPEED
## Twenty Six-Men Teams to Represent Classes in Relay Race. 
### 
The annual Irish Marathon race,
the grind which comes but once a
year, will be the all-important feature
of the funfest on Saturday morning,
from the standpoint of interclass
competition. For the past two weeks
a wealth of material which has been
dormant heretofore has come to light
in the form of one hundred or more
440 yard runners. Little urging has
been necessary to get a host of ath
letes to try out for honors on thuir
respective class teams.
Each team will consist of twenty
six runners, each runner covering a
quarter of a mile. For the first time
in some years a holdover class will
enter a team. Nineteen-thirteen has
an overstock of track men and prom
ises to put up a hard race for the
honors in the six-mile grind.
For the best time among Varsity
and novice runners gold medals will
be awarded by Quadrangle Club. The
athletes securing the next best times
in both divisions will be awarded sil
ver medals.
Holdovers have planned a big sur
prise in the way of entertainment
which promises to surpass the hu
morous episodes of previous years.
So far their plans have been kept
dark, but secrecy usually assures
success.
Early forecasts pick the teams rep
resenting 1917, 1916 and 1913 as the
most formidable aggregations. The
Freshmen have the strongest team on
paper. It is reported that every man
can do better than 57 seconds in the
440.
