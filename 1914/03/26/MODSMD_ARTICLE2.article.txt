# POMONA RUNNERS ARRIVE FOR MEET
## Southern Athletes to Meet Cardinal Men on Oval Tomorrow. 
### 
With a party of 25 men, includ
ing Graduate Manager Hankey, the Po
mona track and baseball teams arrived
on the campus this morning. The track
men will get a workout this afternoon
in order to accustom themselves r.o
the local cinder path before the meet
tomorrow afternoon. The dual contest
between Stanford and Pomona will
commence at 2 o'clock with the start
of the mile run.
The Cardinal will be represented in
the field with the strongest team of the
season. Most of the Varsity men and
those who are competing on the local
track for the first fime this year will
be included in the entries. It is prob
able that P. R. Wilson, '16, will not
compete for another week on account
of shin splints. Unless weather con
ditions change materially Captain Mc-
Kee and Coach Campbell will also be
out of the running tomorrow.
Results in the meet tomorrow will
probably be materially one-sided. The
southerners will rely for first places
on the 100, 220 and 410 yard dashes,
with Gillette as their mainstay. If
Campbell and Mckee do not compete
it is probable that the phenomenal
Claremont sprinter will take all
three first places. In the other track
events the Sturgis brothers should
give a good account of themselves in
the distance races.
Tn order that the meet may be run
off with as little friction as possible
it has been requested that all spec
tators other than officials keep off |
the oval and track. Adherence to
this request will be appreciated by '
officials.
The time of the meet has been j
changed to 2 o'clock in order that
the competition may be finished early
in the afternoon. An admission of
25 cents will be charged or the pre
sentation of the season tickets is re
quired.
