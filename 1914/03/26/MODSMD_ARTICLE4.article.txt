# Six Veterans Included in Varsity Nine That Will Meet California on Saturdayâ€”Lineup Announced This Afternoon Contains No Surprises.
## 
### 
A veteran combination has been
named by Captain Terry to take the
field against California in the opening
game of the series on Saturday. With
six of last year's victorious Varsity
players to form the bulk of the nine,
Cardinal followers are hoping for a
repetition of the last intercollegiate
series when Stanford triumphed in
two straight victories.
With the exception of second base
the infield is identically that of a year
ago. Maple and Dent will constitute
the veteran battery. Maple has been
worked but little in the box during the
latter part of the season in order to
save his arm, which received a slight
strain in one of the earlier games. But
all doubts as to his condition were re
moved by his performance in the last
two games, when an opposing runner
was not allowed to score during his
time in the box. He is batting at .200.
Dent's consistent work behind the bat
has left no doubt as to his right to
wear the mask again. Three out of the
six doubles gleaned by the Varsity
batsmen during the season are credited
to him, while he has maintained a
batting average of .209.
Workman will be iia his position at
first base. A badly sprained ankle
threatened to keep the veteran out
to keep the veteran first baseman out
of Saturday's play, but it has so far
recovered that, barring further injury,
he will be able to serve throughout
the game. His batting average is .262.
Stafford has been selected to cover the
second bag. This is the only infield
position not covered by a veteran of
last year's series. Stafford is a Christ
mas Freshman. Last spring he played
with the Olympic Club nine, which
played the Varsity in three pre-season
games. He batted .181 for the season.
McCloskey will serve his second year
as third baseman. Starting the sea
son with an illness, he has steadily
worked back to his usual form and
has now a batting average of .233.

field. During the pre-season games he
not only acted in the field but has
served a number of times in the pitch
er's box. Halm leads the batters with
an average of .293. Day, who will
cover the center garden, was last sea
son's substitute fielder and this year
lias proven himself both reliable and
iast in the field and has attained a bat
ting average of .279. Noonan has been
chosen for the right fielder. He was a
member of the Varsity squad a year
ago and this year has won his place on
the team by consistent playing
throughout the season. His batting
shows .174. The four Varsity substi
tutes named for Saturday's contest are
Hayes, pitcher; Landers, catcher; Ste
vens, infielder; Dooling, outfielder.
The record of the team for this
year shows nine victories from a total
of fifteen games played, with three de
feats and three tie games. 48 runs
have been registered by the Cardinal
players as compared with 29 by their
opponents. 101 hits are credited to the
Varsity and 85 to their opponents. Very
little heavy hitting has been evinced
this season, no home runs being re
corded, and but two triples and six
doubles. This compares rather unfa
vorably with last year, although the
team average is now .235 as compared
with .226 a year ago.
The series with Santa Clara was lost
in the last game, although this may
be accounted for by the fact that the
Missionites have a stronger aggrega
tion than last, spring, when Stanford
took the series. The Cardinal has won
out in its games with St. Mary's, St.
Ignatius, the Independents, and the
College Alumni.
The fielding has been of a high or
der, as shown by the comparatively
small number of runs made against
the Varsity together with the fact that
fewer strikeouts have been made than
usual. One disconcerting feature is
that more of the errors have occurred
in the later games than in the forepart
of the season. In respect to hitting
the later games have brought a marked
improvement.
The intercollegiate baseball record
shows that Stanford has won on nine
years while the State University
claims twelve victories. One game
was a tie.
Saturday's game will be called at 3
o'clock, 50 cents admission being
charged. The Stanford rooters will oc
cupy the north bleachers, while the
Blue and Clold contingent will occupy
the west side.
At the time of going to press the
California line-up had not been an
nounced, but a message from a good
authority across the Ray stated that
it would in all probability be that
printed in today's issue. Three of
the California players are veterans.
The name of Captain Rubke does not
appear on the line-up.
