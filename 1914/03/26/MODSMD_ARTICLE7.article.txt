To the Cardinal's splendid ball team which will cover the diamond
on Saturday every Stanford man is giving his last ounce of loyalty and
enthusiasm. The Daily Palo Alto wishes to take this opportunity to

them to be a team of grand, hard-fighting, clean-playing ball-players;
and we are with them every minute, win or lose.
