# "COLLEGE PRINCE" SINGS AND DANCES TO SUCCESS
## 1915 JUNIOR OPERA REFLECTS UNDERGRADUATE SKILL Lilting Melody, Facile Lyries and Art of Principals and Chorus Win Triumph. 
### J.C. Cross, '17 
"The College Prince," surrounded
by the rest of Iris royal family and
the numerous entourage of a musical
production, held a reception on the
boards ol' the As.-'.mbly Hall last
evening in a melange that defies clas
sification according to any ordinary
code. It may most safely be called a
Junior Opera. Everybody at Stan
ford, and a few of the illuminati be
yond these borders, will understand
what that means, and to others it
doesn't matter. According to the liat
of the genial first-nighters the 1915
presentation is a splendid success.
The plot is as fragile as a cobweb,
a mere incident, which excuses a con
siderable amount of music and bad
inage, and therefore serves its pur
pose.
The score of the opera, by M. A.
Ulu men thai, MG, and M. A. Hagen,
'15, is a matter for congratulation.
Its very simplicity, its freshness, its
variety, j. piayfu iits;- strike one
like a i-reath of undergraduate geix
iu . Add to;"that the statement that
the fiu'ile lyrics of Mr. Hagen abso
lutely fit the music, and you have ex
plained the supremacy of "The Col
lege Prince" without making it one
whit easier to imitate successfully.
The lilting son;; "Blue Eyes" is
vastly alluring, while better' numbers
than "I'd Live or I Would Die for
You" and the limpid duet, "We Do,"
sung by Miss Rowlands and Mr. Mil
ler in the first act, do not grow on
every operatic bush. Cleverness
stamps many of the other songs such
as "My Palo Alto Pal," "My Hello
Girl," and "That. Stanford Hag/' all
of which were full of gayety and en
cored so vigorously that one number
can hardly be said to have surpassed
the others in popularity.
Brilliant costumes, artistically de
signed and well assembled, added no
small amount of effectiveness. They
are really very tasteful in a gorg
eous way. bright colors being utilized
/in plain expanses without the aim
■less kaleidoscopic futility that some
times is indicted on spectators.
The cast appears to have been very
carefully chosen. Miss Irene How
lands, '16, played "Anne Hudson"
with < qui.ite charm, and in addition
to singing her share of the score ar
tistically, she had many moments In
which she displayed decided acting
ability. She was always in the pic
ture, whether on the Stanford cam
pus or in the court of Nnidrofstan.
in her " Mirror Mine" song she
nroved that she had mastered the dif-
ficult art of establishing just the right
flirtatious relationship with the audi
ence. Miss Rowlands possesses the
most valuable of all stage assets —
magnetism—which with her beautiful,
clear soprano and dramatic intolli
enc.e accounts for her complete suc
cess.
An especially delightful perform
ance was that, of Miss Esther Liver
sidge, '17, as "Minna." She revealed
a most winsome personality, which in
appearance suggests KVitzi Scheff, a
remarkably beautiful and mellow con
tralto, and real histrionic gifts. She
sings easily and clearly, with self
possession which enhances her vocal
achievements. In her "Hello Girl"
dance duet with Mr. Stroliauer in the
second act, Miss Liversidge gave fur
ther illustration of her versatility,
capturing the most enthusiastic ap
plause of the evening.
0. M. Miller, '14, made "Jack Bur
ton" a manly figure. Tn quality and
quantity, bis baritone is decidedly
pipasing avid sufficient, because of its
lyric sweetness.

it. Krohn, '10, made a palpable hit
with A 1 > Paii) Mto I'm!." i <>r he was
thoroughly imbued with the vigor
that characterizes the modern pop
ular song, lie danced with bis cus
tomary agility and grace, and his ex
uberant good nature created n big
contingent of admirers. Moreover, he
has an agreeable voice and sings with
assurance that pleases. Krohn scored
one of the distinct successes of the
evening.
As a ludicrous German, W. (!. Paul,
extracts a bizarre humor from
many lines which in less experienced
hands would wilt inanely. The audi
ence followed him with delight, for
lie played in a characteristic style of
eccentric comedy.
Miss Christabel Elliott, '16, as
"Dot Walton," displayed a charming
soprano voice of excellent quality ami
flexibility. Her greatest opportunity
came in the second act solo, "In the
Garden of Dreams With You." which
she sang with delightful purity and
sure.ty of tone.
One could not ask for a more pleas
ing picture of light and airy grace
than that provided by the entr'acte
dance of .Miss Mary (laid. 'IFi, and

Miss Marbry Penning, '14. They
wafted themselves liitlier and thither
like black and white butterflies an I
completely captured their audience.
E. T. Duttou, applied a favorite
vaudeville method in bis amusing
solo, "Mazie," which aided him ma
terially to win success. J, A. Gibb,
'1."), scored one of the individual bits
of the evening as "Terry McGovern."
a droll character which he played in
a manner to disarm criticism.
.Miss Marjorie Landers, '14, as
"Miss Originality," had a very diffi
cult burlesque role which she handled
with proper appreciation of comedy
values.
Three old cronies were humorously
sketched by .1. M. Patten. 0. E.
Wolcott, 'Jo. and H. M. Stanley, '17.
This comedy trio exhibited pleasing
voices, nimble feci; and a dramatic
enthusiasm that was refreshing. W.
E. Dunlap. '11, and P. Strohauer, 'I t.
Were auiusiag whether as undertak
ers or diplomatists.
