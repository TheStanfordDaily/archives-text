# "COLLEGE PRINCE" SINGS AND DANCES TO SUCCESS
## 1915 JUNIOR OPERA REFLECTS UNDERGRADUATE SKILL Lilting Melody, Facile Lyries and Art of Principals and Chorus Win Triumph.

"The College Prince," surrounded
by the rest of Iris royal family and
the numerous entourage of a musical
production, held a reception on the
boards ol' the As.-'.mbly Hall last
evening in a melange that defies clas
sification according to any ordinary
code. It may most safely be called a
Junior Opera. Everybody at Stan
ford, and a few of the illuminati be
yond these borders, will understand
what that means, and to others it
doesn't matter. According to the liat
of the genial first-nighters the 1915
presentation is a splendid success.
The plot is as fragile as a cobweb,
a mere incident, which excuses a con
siderable amount of music and bad
inage, and therefore serves its pur
pose.
The score of the opera, by M. A.
Ulu men thai, MG, and M. A. Hagen,
'15, is a matter for congratulation.
Its very simplicity, its freshness, its
variety, j. piayfu iits;- strike one
like a i-reath of undergraduate geix
iu . Add to;"that the statement that
the fiu'ile lyrics of Mr. Hagen abso
lutely fit the music, and you have ex
plained the supremacy of "The Col
lege Prince" without making it one
whit easier to imitate successfully.
The lilting son;; "Blue Eyes" is
vastly alluring, while better' numbers
than "I'd Live or I Would Die for
You" and the limpid duet, "We Do,"
sung by Miss Rowlands and Mr. Mil
ler in the first act, do not grow on
every operatic bush. Cleverness
stamps many of the other songs such
as "My Palo Alto Pal," "My Hello
Girl," and "That. Stanford Hag/' all
of which were full of gayety and en
cored so vigorously that one number
can hardly be said to have surpassed
the others in popularity.
Brilliant costumes, artistically de
signed and well assembled, added no
small amount of effectiveness. They
are really very tasteful in a gorg
eous way. bright colors being utilized
/in plain expanses without the aim
â– less kaleidoscopic futility that some
times is indicted on spectators.
The cast appears to have been very
carefully chosen. Miss Irene How
lands, '16, played "Anne Hudson"
with < qui.ite charm, and in addition
to singing her share of the score ar
tistically, she had many moments In
which she displayed decided acting
ability. She was always in the pic
ture, whether on the Stanford cam
pus or in the court of Nnidrofstan.
in her " Mirror Mine" song she
