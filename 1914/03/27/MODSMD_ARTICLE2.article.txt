# FIVE TEAMS WILL ENTER IRISH MARATHON RACE
## HOLDOVERS HAVE HARDY GROUP OF VETERANS Greased Pig Contest and Obstacle Race Will Furnish Merry Diversion. 
### 
The sixth annual Irish Marathon
relit;, rat will bead tomorrow's pro
gram as one of the features of Junior
Week. Under the auspices of the
Quadrangle Club's committee of J. H.
Tliwlitirn, '18, It. W. Wilcox, '1'!, and
E. C. Beltrens, '14, the events of the
morning have been made particularly
elaborate, and many side-splitting
surprises are promised the spectators.
The Holdovers and their commit
tee, L. D. Summerfield, '12, M. L.
Ward, '12, and C. D. Keefer, '13, have
spent much time and thought upon
them. The veteran students guaran
tee a treat ill the way of take-offs on
the current events of the college
year. A ferocious porker has been
imported by Sam from , the wilds
Portola and when well greased will
lead a merry chase for the sturdy
athletes who attempt its capture. A
real old-fashioned obstacle race Will
also entangle many entrants. The
'chief feature of the morning howeveA
.will, be the "Pursuit of the Seanda
hoovian Goof" which is tliC nam' giv
en by the committee to one of its
mysterious surprises. The holdovers
are endeavoring to put on stunts that
will surpass any that, have ever go?ie
| before.
Fiye teams will enter the race this
year. The same number has usually
entered before, but the Holdover team
has generally resorted to bicycles,
wheelbarrows, and cutting across the
i oval to maintain their lead, and has
! not been seriously considered at the
finish. This year, however, the 191 M
men have a superfluity of track ma
terial and in their role of Marathon
Champions they regard it their duty
to defend the title. They have en
tered a strong team and will be serl
oit.-: competitors. No forecast can bo
1 made as to the result of the race as
the strength of the others teams is
| not known. All seem to be fairly well
'balanced and evenly matched.
Thebes: performers will be re
'
i Quadrav Â£Ie Club. The three men who
t negotiate their laps in the fastest
timet will receive them. In addition
! to these there will be special awards
| for the best varsity and the best non
i varsity contestants.
