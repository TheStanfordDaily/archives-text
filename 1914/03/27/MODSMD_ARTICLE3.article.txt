# JUNIORS WILL BE HOSTS AT ATTRACTIVE DANCE
## 
### 
All is ready for the Junior Prom,
and at 8:15 this evening one hundred
and twenty-five Stanford couples will
trip merrily to the first strains of
McDonald's orchestra. No pains have
been spared to make the dance a
great success.
The club room in Encina has
taken on gala attire for the occasion,
with a lowered ceiling of ivy, smilax
and wistaria, interspersed with lilacs
;and hung on strings of colored elec
triec bulbs. Illumined class numerals
will occupy a conspicuous place in
the great hall. The corridors are
strung with vines, and the effect
throughout is charming.
The programs are of white leather,
decorated in gold, and the dances
have been arranged in novel and
unique style. Each number occupies
one page, with the order and music
(of the dance at the top and a.n ap
propriate verse and space for "metu
ories" at the bottom.
Several pieces from the Junior
opera score will be played, among
which are "My Palo Alto Pal." "Hel
lo Girl," "The Stanford Rag," and
"College Prince Waltzes." Other
equally melodious and rhythmic num
bers will not be lacking to inspire
the dancers.
